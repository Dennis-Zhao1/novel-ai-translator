**Chapter 57: Delivering Lunch to My Sister**

Sometimes, I just can’t understand why some people are blessed by fate with a chance to start over, yet they don’t put in the effort. Instead, they look for shortcuts, relying on others or external circumstances to achieve success. Why can’t they just strive through their own hard work?

After finishing a compulsory class at school, Yu Zhu Yi glanced at her phone and noticed it was already past nine, approaching ten o'clock. A thought struck her—she could bring lunch to her sister at the office today.

She quickly opened WeChat and typed a message to her sister.

**[Cute One]: Are you still working, sis?**  
**[Cute One]: I just finished my class!**  
**[Cute One]: I’d like to come visit you at your office for lunch, is that okay?**  
**[Cute One]: I have no classes this morning ◑▂◑**  
**[Cute One]: I miss you!**  
**[Cute One]: You say that a day apart feels like three autumns. We’ve only been apart for a morning, and I already miss you so much.**

When Yan Xin Fei saw the flurry of messages, she had just wrapped up a meeting and returned to her office, settling down to tackle a few documents. Upon reading Yu Zhu Yi’s enthusiastic texts, she couldn’t help but feel a mix of exasperation and fondness.

Sure enough, her little sister was as clingy as ever.

**[Sister Mine]: Sure, I’d love that!**  
**[Cute One]: ~\(≧▽≦)/~**  
**[Cute One]: So, does that mean you miss me too?**  
**[Cute One]: I knew you did!**  
**[Cute One]: I won’t disturb your work anymore.**  
**[Cute One]: I’ll come to your office around lunchtime!**  
**[Cute One]: How do I get in when I arrive? Do I need to make an appointment?**

**[Sister Mine]: No need. I’ll inform the front desk. Just come up directly when you get here.**  
**[Cute One]: Okay! Have a good day at work! (Heart ❤)**

After reading her sister's messages, Yan Xin Fei decided not to reply further. She put her phone aside and focused on the documents in front of her.

After getting her sister’s approval, Yu Zhu Yi stood up and prepared to leave the classroom when Zhao Min, quick on his feet, intercepted her.

“Hey, Yu, where are you rushing off to? It’s not even noon yet!”

“I’m going to deliver lunch to my girlfriend,” Yu Zhu Yi emphasized the words “my girlfriend” with a hint of pride. “Of course, I have to go early to prepare lunch for her! Not like you single dogs can understand.”

Zhao Min stumbled over his words, “But what’s wrong with being single? We’re proud of it!”

While saying this, he threw an arm around his friend Chao Yi Xiu’s shoulders. “Right, Yi Xiu? What’s so great about dating?”

As soon as Zhao Min wrapped his arm around Chao Yi Xiu, he felt a rush of blood to his face, heat creeping up his neck. 

Yu Zhu Yi couldn’t help but smirk at the sight. 

“Who would’ve thought…” she mused.

Zhao Min, oblivious to the awkward tension, looked at her puzzled. “What are you talking about, Yu?”

Yu Zhu Yi gave him a look typically reserved for someone a bit dense. “I didn’t think you’d be such a fool. Anyway, I’m off to deliver lunch to my girlfriend.”

With that, she left behind a bewildered Zhao Min and a blushing Chao Yi Xiu.

Zhao Min, watching Yu Zhu Yi walk away, couldn’t help but mutter, “Why does Yu call me a fool? I didn’t do anything foolish… or maybe I just never do anything foolish? Hey, Yi Xiu! Why is your face so red? Are you sick?”

As he said this, Zhao Min reached out to check Chao Yi Xiu’s forehead, trying to gauge his temperature.

“You don’t feel too hot. So why’s your face so flushed? Is it too warm in here?”

Chao Yi Xiu took a step back, his eyes avoiding Zhao Min’s gaze. “It’s hot. I’m just red because of the heat.”

“Oh, I see! So that’s it! Yu’s going out for lunch by herself again, leaving us two to fend for ourselves. What are we going to eat? Spicy crayfish? Ugh, I’m so hungry just thinking about it!”

Once Chao Yi Xiu felt cooler, he turned to Zhao Min, his voice soft and warm. “I’m fine with anything. Just tell me what you want for lunch, and we can go eat it.”

“Sounds good! You’re the best, Yi Xiu!”

Not far from them, Lin Yun Yan’s expression twisted in frustration. Did she just hear Yu Zhu Yi say she was going to deliver lunch to her girlfriend? How could he do this? He was supposed to be hers! How could he be with someone else?

A dark glimmer passed through her eyes as she stormed off.

It baffled Lin Yun Yan that she could even feel this way. They had no real connection. Yu Zhu Yi had only shared a meal or two with her father, and she just happened to be there. He didn’t even remember her name.
