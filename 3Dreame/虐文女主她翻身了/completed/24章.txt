Kiss

As they drove along, Jade Yu couldn’t help but steal glances at the blushing smile on Yvette Yan’s face. Yvette looked calm on the outside, but inside she was a flurry of emotions: Oh my gosh, why is this adorable guy staring at me like that?

Could it be that he’s so happy to be with me that he’s gone a little daft? 

Ugh, unlike me—I could never be that carefree. He’s just naturally charming. I can’t help but want to devour him whole. 

A flicker of dark red glimmered in Yvette’s eyes as her hands heated up, feeling almost feverish with anticipation.

Before long, they arrived at their destination. After getting into the car, Yvette slid into the driver's seat, while Jade took his place in the passenger seat.

You might be wondering why the CEO of the Yan family doesn’t have a chauffeur. Well, Yvette had dismissed the driver long before, thinking, why keep him around? To be a third wheel? Not a chance.

Bending over to fasten her seatbelt, Yvette unintentionally sent Jade’s heart racing. He thought she was leaning in for a kiss, so he shut his eyes tight. His heartbeat thundered in his ears, as if it wanted to leap out of his throat.

But after a moment of waiting, he felt nothing and opened his eyes to a playful gaze from Yvette.

“What? Did you think I was going to…?” she teased, her lips curling into a smirk.

Jade’s cheeks flushed with indignation, “No, I—”

Before he could finish, Yvette’s lips crashed against his in a sudden kiss that felt like a tempest, leaving him utterly bewildered and unable to react. It was overwhelming; he felt as though he was being devoured, and every breath became increasingly difficult. His face turned a deeper shade of crimson, and the heat in the car felt stifling.

Just when Jade thought he might suffocate from the kiss, Yvette pulled away, her voice laced with desire as she murmured in his ear, “You really are as delicious as I imagined.” She playfully ruffled his hair and chuckled, “Little cutie, remember to breathe next time.”

Jade’s face was still flushed, his expression one of pure shock, as if he hadn’t yet fully processed what had just happened.

Yvette helped him straighten out, rolled down the window to let in the cool breeze, and slowly began to calm her own racing heart as she focused on driving.

Meanwhile, Jade felt like he was experiencing a social disaster. How could he be so clueless as to forget to breathe? It was utterly embarrassing! Determined, he vowed to find videos to learn from before returning home so he wouldn’t make such a fool of himself in front of his sister again.

Yvette noticed the slightly dazed look on his face and couldn’t help but chuckle to herself.

Before long, they arrived at a cozy restaurant.

Once inside, Yvette took his hand, intertwining their fingers, feeling the warmth and connection between them.

As they entered, Jade looked around and noticed that most of the patrons seemed to be couples, and the tables were nearly all occupied, with only one spot left by the window. 

Unbeknownst to him, Yvette had deliberately brought him to a couple’s restaurant, but Jade thought it was just a lucky coincidence.

She led him to the window seat, and soon a waiter approached them. “Hello, what would you like to order?”

Jade looked around, not seeing his sister, and said, “Where’s my sister? You can just order for us.”

Yvette smiled, “Alright then, we’ll have two couple’s sets and two cups of the house special coffee with seven sugars, please.”

“Sure, please wait a moment.”

“Yvette, how did you end up here? Did you know this was…” Jade feigned ignorance, looking puzzled.

Yvette shot him a playful smirk, “Oh, I knew. I brought you here on purpose. Don’t tell me you don’t like it?”

Jade shook his head vigorously, “No, not at all!”

The dishes soon arrived, and their impeccable manners dictated that they ate in silence, each bite reflecting their elegance.

Even though Yvette and Jade didn’t converse while eating, the atmosphere around them sparkled with a rosy hue, making it nearly impossible for anyone else to intrude upon their bubble.
