What? Is there something wrong?
Chao Yixiu smiled at them, then leaned in closer to Zhao Min and whispered, "You better stop talking; Yu Ge’s face is turning black. Do you miss getting punched by him that much?"

Zhao Min recalled the fierce way he used to hit people and immediately shivered. He quickly shut his mouth and obediently stood there, no longer speaking.

Yu Zhuyi shot a cold glare at Zhao Min for a few moments, as if to say, "At least you know your place."

In the next second, he turned around with a smile and began speaking to Yan Xinfeng. The lively scene before them was a perfect demonstration of what it meant to change expressions in a split second.

Zhao Min cursed inwardly, realizing that Yu Zhuyi was just another guy who forgot his friends when faced with a pretty face.

"Hey, sis, come over here," Yu Zhuyi called, taking Yan Xinfeng’s hand and leading her to their seats, then pulling the chair out for her.

Zhao Min shook his head while quietly muttering to himself, and he and Chao Yixiu walked over.

Yu Zhuyi called the waiter over, picked up the menu, and handed it to his sister. "You go ahead and pick first, sis."

Yan Xinfeng took the menu and looked at Zhao Min and Chao Yixiu. "What do you guys want to order?"

"I’m fine with anything," Zhao Min and Chao Yixiu replied in unison.

They exchanged a glance, and an unspoken tension filled the air around them. Yu Zhuyi looked at the two of them teasingly.

Yan Xinfeng nodded and then began to focus on choosing her dishes.

After about half an hour, nearly all the dishes had been served. Zhao Min glanced at the table, feeling overwhelmed by the abundance of food.

Most of the dishes Yan Xinfeng had ordered were Yu Zhuyi’s favorites. Thankfully, they weren’t picky eaters.

Initially, everyone ate quietly. But somehow, halfway through the meal, it transformed into Yu Zhuyi happily enjoying his food while Yan Xinfeng served him dishes and peeled shrimp for him.

On the other side, Chao Yixiu was earnestly feeding Zhao Min.

From a distance, it was clear that two pairs of lovebirds were sitting together, clearly not wanting anyone to interrupt their moment.

By the end of the meal, it was evident that Yu Ge and Yan Xinfeng were both interested in each other. Yan Xinfeng had ordered all of Yu Ge’s favorite dishes, and she had even taken the time to serve him food and peel shrimp.

After finishing their meal, they all went their separate ways.

In the hospital room.

Lu Xiuming anxiously asked the doctor, "How is she? Why did she suddenly faint?"

"The patient has a congenital heart condition. Emotional fluctuations or excessive fatigue can increase the burden on her heart, leading to temporary blood supply insufficiency, which can cause short-term fainting. You need to keep an eye on her emotional state moving forward."

"A congenital heart condition? How could this happen? How is that possible?" Lu Xiuming's face was filled with shock as he took a few steps back.

"Can’t she just get a heart transplant?"

"Theoretically, yes. However, finding a matching heart is quite difficult. It’s best to find a compatible heart as soon as possible; you have at most six months. If you can’t find one by then, I’m afraid…"

After giving a few more warnings, the doctor left the room.

Just then, Wen Qingzhi woke up.

"I’m a bit thirsty, Xiuming Ge, can you help me get a glass of water?"

Lu Xiuming snapped back to reality, his heart aching as he turned pale and went to get her some water.

"You should lie still and not move around. I’ll get you some water," he said gently.

After pouring the water, he carefully helped Wen Qingzhi sit up, supporting her as she leaned against the hospital bed.

Wen Qingzhi took the glass from him and sipped slowly.

As she lowered her head to drink, she didn’t notice his slightly trembling hands.

Once she finished drinking, she looked at Lu Xiuming, who seemed troubled.

"Xiuming Ge, what’s wrong with you?"

"It’s nothing. How could anything be wrong? The doctor said it’s just that you’ve been overworking yourself. You just need to rest and keep your emotions in check."

"Oh, I see. But why do you look…"

"I just have some company matters to deal with. I’ll call someone to take care of you. I… I need to head back to the office now."

In a moment of panic, Lu Xiuming could only come up with that excuse. He was terrified that if he stayed any longer, he might accidentally reveal her condition.

He had to find a heart that matched hers—yes, that was it! If only he could find a compatible heart, then…

Hope ignited within him as he hurriedly left the hospital room.

Wen Qingzhi watched his hurried figure leave, feeling a pang of dissatisfaction.

Look at that—men! Even when you’re sick, they won’t stay to keep you company but rush back to work instead.

She scoffed dryly, a bitter smile on her lips.
