Chapter 54: He Finally Returned

Yan Xinfei drove straight back to the company. 

Once she arrived, she immediately started tackling the pile of documents that had accumulated over the past few days. She lost track of time, and by the time she looked up, it was already past nine o'clock when her assistant came in to inform her about a meeting. After finishing the meeting, which lasted over an hour, she returned to her office and continued working through the remaining files.

——————————————————————————

As Yu Zhuyi entered the school, his cheeks slightly flushed, he walked along a small path. Suddenly, Zhao Min popped up behind him and playfully punched him on the shoulder. Yu Zhuyi jumped a little in surprise, but as Zhao Min stepped in front of him, he playfully retaliated with a light punch of his own.

Ah, some people's daily interactions are just like this.

Yu Zhuyi raised an eyebrow, glancing at Zhao Min and Chao Yixiu standing in front of him. Their expressions clearly conveyed that they had something to discuss.

Zhao Min couldn’t help but tease, “Hey, Yu, you’re not being fair! You run off to have fun while we’re stuck here in school, covering for you and handling your business at the company!”

His tone was filled with mock grievance, though there was a hint of curiosity about where Yu Zhuyi had actually gone.

Picking up on Zhao Min's curiosity, Yu Zhuyi chose not to answer. Instead, he let out a scoff, “Are you the one handling company affairs, or is it Yixiu?”

Upon hearing Yu Zhuyi’s teasing remark, Zhao Min couldn’t help but retort, “Hey, Yu, you can’t think of me like that! I can be useful too! I spent an entire afternoon at the company yesterday!”

Chao Yixiu, standing beside Zhao Min, looked at him with a fond smile and added, “What Zhao Min said is true; he really did spend the whole afternoon at the company yesterday.”

Of course, he conveniently omitted the fact that Zhao Min had spent that time playing games instead.

The truth was, Zhao Min hadn’t even wanted to go to the company in the first place. It was Chao Yixiu who insisted he go, threatening to tell Yu Zhuyi if he didn't show up.

Yu Zhuyi wasn’t sure whether to believe it or not. He simply gave Zhao Min a half-smile, watching as the latter began to feel a bit awkward under his gaze. Finally, he turned to Chao Yixiu and said, “Thanks for your help yesterday.”

Chao Yixiu habitually adjusted his glasses and shook his head, replying, “It’s no problem. After all, we’re part of the company too.”

Indeed, Yu Zhuyi’s company had them as stakeholders. When Yu Zhuyi founded the company, they had invested some money. However, the day-to-day management had mostly fallen to Yu Zhuyi and Chao Yixiu, while Zhao Min just wanted to put in some cash and later receive a share of the profits.

Ah, but what could he do? He just didn’t have the knack for it.

Fortunately, no one minded whether he could manage the company affairs or not. After all, during the company’s early struggles, it was Zhao Min's investment that had helped them through a tough period. Without that money, even if they had eventually founded the company, it wouldn’t have been as smooth sailing, and they would have taken much longer to reach their current success.

Unable to contain his curiosity, Zhao Min directly asked, “Hey, Yu, where did you go yesterday? You rarely disappear for an entire day. The last time you did, it was because you had a fight with your old man and ended up at an internet café all night playing games.”

He scratched his head, smiling sheepishly. 

Although that incident had happened quite some time ago, Zhao Min and the others had spent countless hours searching for him, only to discover he was just gaming. It had become a running joke, and they still remembered it vividly.

Chao Yixiu looked at Yu Zhuyi with a serious expression. If it weren’t for the curiosity in his eyes, one might not have guessed he wanted to know where Yu Zhuyi had been.

They had known each other for a long time and were the best of friends, so it wouldn't hurt to share.

Yu Zhuyi had originally planned to find an appropriate time to tell them. He had envisioned introducing his sister to his friends face-to-face, not like this.

But it was fine; they had already guessed his relationship with her.

Yu Zhuyi slowly spoke up, “Oh, you want to know where I went yesterday?”

Zhao Min nodded enthusiastically, “Yes, yes! Hurry up and tell us!”

When Yu Zhuyi didn’t answer right away, Zhao Min urged him on, “C’mon, don’t keep us in suspense!”

Yu Zhuyi paused, a teasing smile on his face as he looked at Zhao Min.

Zhao Min, feeling the pressure, exclaimed, “Yu, if you don’t want to say it, you don’t have to! Don’t look at me like that; it’s scary!”

Chao Yixiu instinctively stepped forward to block Yu Zhuyi's gaze toward Zhao Min.

Yu Zhuyi looked slightly taken aback, then smiled softly at Chao Yixiu. 

Understanding the situation, Chao Yixiu’s face turned beet red.

Meanwhile, Zhao Min continued to complain, “Hey, Yixiu, why did you block me?”

While pushing Chao Yixiu aside, he remained oblivious to the tension.

Yu Zhuyi shook his head, thinking to himself, “Ah, Yixiu has a long way to go. Unlike me, who’s already with my sister.”

Yu Zhuyi turned back to Zhao Min, “Oh, about yesterday, I went to pick up my girlfriend.”

“What?! Wait, did I hear that right? Your girlfriend? When did you start dating? You’re not luring in minors, are you? Don’t do anything stupid!” Zhao Min exclaimed, panic written all over his face.

Suppressing the urge to smack him, Yu Zhuyi replied, “What? Do you really think I’m that kind of person? Of course I have a girlfriend! You’ve met her before, haven’t you?”

“Met? When did we… Wait, it can’t be Yan Xinfei, can it?” 

Yu Zhuyi nodded proudly.

Chao Yixiu, now back to normal, felt it was only natural. After all, back when Yan Xinfei came to their school to give a lecture, Yu Zhuyi had been unusually focused on her.

If he didn’t know Yu Zhuyi well, he might have thought he was some sort of stalker.

And so the story continued…
