**Chapter Sixty-Eight: Like a Kitten Still Weaned**

Suddenly, the little cutie remembered that he seemed to have something he wanted to ask his sister today. 

After contemplating for a moment, he finally spoke up. With an expectant look on his face, his eyes sparkled with a mesmerizing brilliance, mysterious and captivating, evoking an irresistible desire to get lost in them.

"Sister, do you have time tonight? Do you have any work to do?"

Yan Xinfeng gazed into those eyes that made her feel entranced, but for some reason, she felt a playful urge to tease the little one in front of her. 

She pretended to be a bit troubled as she said, "Tonight, it seems like..."

Yan Xinfeng hesitated, leaving her sentence hanging.

Yu Zhuyi lowered his head, a mix of urgency and disappointment washing over him.

When Yan Xinfeng saw the sparkle in his eyes dim, she slowly continued, completing her thought, "Tonight, it seems I don't have any work scheduled. What's up?"

Meanwhile, at the company, Assistant Liu was working hard and suddenly sneezed. 

Liu Lin rubbed her slightly itchy nose and muttered softly, "Weird, why did I suddenly sneeze? I hope I’m not catching a cold. Ugh, when will the president come back to the office? She has a meeting to attend tonight."

Hearing his sister say she had no work tonight, Yu Zhuyi's eyes lit up once again.

With joy, he said, "Sister, here’s the thing. I want to take you back to the old house tonight, and I’d like you to meet my grandfather. Is that okay?"

After he spoke, he looked at Yan Xinfeng with a pair of doe-like eyes, full of a desperate yet adorable innocence.

If any ordinary girl had seen this, her heart would have melted, and she would have agreed without hesitation. 

Unfortunately for him, Yan Xinfeng was not just any girl; she was a straight-talking, no-nonsense woman, as direct as they come. 

She didn’t agree immediately but instead watched the little expressions flit across his face with genuine interest.

"Sister, please? Come with me to see Grandpa," Yu Zhuyi pouted and spoiled a little.

"Alright, since you want me to go, I’ll go," Yan Xinfeng said, pretending to be reluctant.

Thus, she was honored to witness the excited expression blooming on the little cutie's face.

Yan Xinfeng thought to herself: Not bad, not bad. This is how it should be. Hmm, quite interesting.

She casually asked the little cutie, "What does Grandpa like to do in his spare time?"

Without hesitation, the little cutie replied, "What can that old man like? Just his calligraphy and paintings, you know, brushes, ink, paper, and inkstones. Oh, by the way, why are you asking this, sister?"

"Oh, nothing. Just a casual question. By the way, where did you get your breakfast today? It was pretty good."

Yan Xinfeng clearly wanted to change the subject, but the little cutie didn’t notice. He thought his sister was genuinely curious about where he had bought his breakfast.

With a proud look on his face, he replied, "Sister, I got it from that popular breakfast spot over there! I waited in line for over half an hour to get it. How could it not be good? I bought it myself!"

Yan Xinfeng nodded in agreement, "Oh, so it’s from that place? Right, right, it must taste even better since you bought it."

Initially, Yu Zhuyi felt quite pleased hearing his sister say this. However, she added, “But, you know, it’s the chef who makes breakfast taste good, isn’t it? So...”

Yan Xinfeng couldn’t quite understand why she felt compelled to voice her confusion.

When Yu Zhuyi heard this, his expression almost cracked in half. Which girlfriend would say something like that? Well, while he was clueless about how other couples interacted, he knew it certainly wasn’t like this. His sister was just too straightforward. If he weren’t able to take it, oh boy...

At that moment, Yan Xinfeng added, "Why does your smile look so strange? If you don’t want to smile, then don’t. It’s kind of scary. Oh, it’s okay here in front of me, but just don’t do it outside."

Now, Yu Zhuyi couldn’t even muster a smile. His face fell, and he looked at his sister with a hint of melancholy in his eyes.

But he realized that his sister was completely unaware of the iron-clad directness of her words.

With a resigned sigh, he shifted the topic, "Hey sister, can we go to the amusement park today?"

He had read online that couples often went to amusement parks for dates.

Yan Xinfeng looked at the little cutie with a somewhat bewildered expression.

The amusement park? Isn’t that a place for kids?

She glanced at the little cutie before her and secretly nodded in her mind. Hmm, he does still seem a bit like a kid, with that look as if he hasn’t quite weaned off yet.

Since the little cutie was excited about it, why not?

Yan Xinfeng nodded, "Sure, we can go."

"Great! Let’s head out now!" Yu Zhuyi exclaimed with joy, his face beaming with delight.
