Date

After finishing her breakfast, Yvonne Xinfay decided not to go to the office. As the company's president, she knew that no one would dare to say anything about her absence. 

"Sigh, it's nice to be in this position. Having money and status means I don't have to scavenge for food like in the apocalypse. And with so many people working for me, even if I'm absent for a few days, everything will run smoothly," Yvonne reflected, a sense of satisfaction washing over her.

Before long, it was noon, and she received a message from her cute little brother.

Cute Little Brother: Sis, are you there?

Sis, mine: ?

Cute Little Brother: *shy emoji* Sis, um, I just wanted to ask if you're free for lunch?

Sis, mine: I'm free. Want to grab lunch together?

Yvonne's younger brother, Ethan Zhu, stared at the message in disbelief, rubbing his eyes to make sure he wasn't imagining things. He checked the message multiple times, confirming that his sister had indeed invited him out for lunch. Excitement bubbled within him, and he quickly replied.

Cute Little Brother: Is that okay? I don't want to disturb your work!

Sis, mine: No problem, it won't disturb me.

Cute Little Brother: Should I come to your office then?

Sis, mine: No need. I’ll come pick you up.

Cute Little Brother: I’ll wait for you at Di Yun University.

Sis, mine: Sounds good.

After putting her phone down, Yvonne hopped into her car to get ready to pick him up.

Ethan couldn't stop smiling as he looked at their chat history. His friend, Marcus Zhao, noticed and leaned over, curious to see who had Ethan grinning like a fool. However, Ethan quickly covered his screen, blocking Marcus's view. 

Marcus teased, "Hey, dude, who are you chatting with? You look so smitten! You’re way too impatient when you chat with us. Don’t tell me you’re actually dating someone now?"

Ethan pushed Marcus away. "Get lost, or do you want a beating? My family has never had such demands."

He paused for dramatic effect before adding, "Not dating yet. But I won’t be joining you guys for lunch. I have plans."

Marcus raised an eyebrow, surprised by Ethan's words. He looked around as if expecting it to be raining red outside, wondering how Ethan could say something so out of character.

Ignoring Marcus, Ethan got ready for his lunch date, knowing it was his first outing with his sister. He wanted to make a good impression.

Marcus turned to another friend, Ryan Chao, and asked, "Do you think he’s got a crush on someone? Should we sneak out and spy on him during lunch?"

Ryan lightly tapped Marcus on the head. "Don’t be stupid. If you want a beating, go ahead. When they get together, Ethan will definitely introduce her to us."

Marcus mumbled, "I’m just curious! It’s not like we’ve seen Ethan show interest in anyone before. I want to know who’s got him all flustered. She’s gotta be someone impressive. I respect her already."

……

Yvonne parked her car at the entrance of Di Yun University, waiting for Ethan. She sent him a message to let him know she had arrived.

Sis, mine: I’m at the school entrance in a black car. The license plate number is ××××.

Cute Little Brother: I’ll be there soon!

Before long, Ethan hurried out of the school. The girls around him blushed, wanting to ask for his WeChat. But they were taken aback when they saw him dash towards a black car.

Breathing heavily, he reached the vehicle, and Yvonne rolled down the window. The onlookers gasped, taking in her stunning appearance and whispering among themselves, realizing that the campus heartthrob had a girlfriend.

Someone captured the moment on their phone and posted it on the school forum with the caption, "Heartbroken. I just saw the campus heartthrob with a mysterious girl."

The photo quickly spread like wildfire on the forum.

Ethan, looking slightly embarrassed, said, "Sorry, Sis, I’m late."

"Not at all. I just got here," Yvonne replied, opening the passenger door for him.

Once Ethan climbed in, Yvonne leaned over to fasten his seatbelt. The sweet scent of her perfume wafted through the car, making Ethan’s face heat up. He swallowed hard and stammered, "Th-thank you, Sis."

He thought he heard her let out a soft laugh.

When he glanced over, he saw her focusing intently on the road ahead.

Letting out a sigh of relief, Ethan chastised himself for being so easily flustered. He thought about how things might escalate if they held hands or kissed in the future... It only made his cheeks burn hotter.

As he lost himself in these thoughts, he felt a wave of nervous excitement wash over him.
