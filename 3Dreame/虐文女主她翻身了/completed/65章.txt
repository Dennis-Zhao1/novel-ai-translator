Chapter 65: How Could She Know What He Was Thinking?

He had made a promise to his sister, which was one thing, but what he truly thought in his heart was another matter entirely. He could sneak some snacks without her noticing, and as long as he stayed quiet about it, she would remain blissfully unaware. He felt quite clever for figuring that out.

However, it was clear that his plan was flawed; Yan Xinfei had a knack for reading his thoughts. Just as he was reveling in his secret, he received a message from his sister that made his face fall and his expression turn a bit mournful as he stared at his phone.

[My Sister]: Don’t think that just because you ate everything and didn’t tell me, I wouldn’t know.

In his heart, Yu Zhuyi chanted, "I can't see it, I can't see it; I didn’t see anything." 

Not listening, not listening—just like the saying goes, “the turtle recites the scriptures.” 

He was about to finish that thought when he suddenly remembered, “Ugh, my sister is definitely no turtle!”

In the next moment, another message from his sister pinged in.

[My Sister]: Don’t pretend you didn’t see my message.

The adorable Yu Zhuyi hesitated for a few seconds before picking up his phone to reply to her.

[Little Cutie]: Where? I was just drinking water!

[Little Cutie]: How could I pretend not to see your message? ∗︎˚(* ˃̤൬˂̤ *)˚∗︎

[My Sister]: Oh, that’s good.

[Little Cutie]: Okay, thank you! I’ll eat less, I promise.

[My Sister]: It’s getting late; you should go to bed.

[My Sister]: Goodnight.

[Little Cutie]: Goodnight, Sister (๑❛ᴗ❛๑)

After sending that message, Yu Zhuyi picked up his hairdryer and started drying his hair. 

Fifteen minutes later, his phone, which he had left on the bed, buzzed. 

He was a bit puzzled—who could be calling him at this hour? He grabbed the phone and saw that it was his grandfather. He quickly pressed the answer button.

“Hello? Grandpa, why are you calling me so late? Is something wrong?”

Through the speaker came his grandfather's boisterous voice, “You little rascal! Do you think I can’t call you unless I have something important? Now that you’re grown up, I hardly see you calling to check on your old grandpa. I’m all alone at the old house, and it’s so boring! Nobody keeps me company, and you never come over to spend time with me.”

As his grandfather spoke, Yu Zhuyi had already moved the phone away from his ear to shield himself from the booming voice.

Once his grandfather finished, he returned the phone to his ear and replied, “Grandpa, that’s not fair! I came back to the old house to keep you company just last month! And I even helped you at the charity auction last time.”

On the other end, he could hear his grandfather’s slightly annoyed voice, “Was that really keeping me company? You were just here to pick up my favorite calligraphy tools…”

Yu Zhuyi seized the opportunity to interrupt before his grandfather could dwell on old grievances. “Grandpa, don’t be so grumpy! Watch your heart; take care of yourself. By the way, is there a reason you called me?”

Only then did the old man remember the reason for his call. 

“Oh, I called to invite you to dinner at the old house tomorrow. Make sure you come! Oh, and your uncle will be there too. Just handle it however you want, you little rascal, hmph!”

Hearing his grandfather's childish tone made Yu Zhuyi feel a mix of exasperation and warmth. “Alright, Grandpa, I’ll be there tomorrow. But I might bring someone with me to meet you.”

His grandfather asked with curiosity, “Bring someone? Who are you bringing? Don’t cause any trouble; your uncle will be there. I don’t want him to find something to pin on you!”

Mention of his uncle made Yu Zhuyi’s expression cool slightly, and he replied sarcastically, “Trouble? Isn’t it always him causing a scene?”

The old man’s voice suddenly sounded much older. “Sigh, I know it’s been tough for you. Don’t worry; Grandpa is on your side. It’s time your uncle learned to stand on his own two feet; he should face the consequences of his actions.”

Hearing his grandfather say that put a bittersweet feeling in Yu Zhuyi’s heart. 

“Don’t worry, Grandpa. I won’t cause any trouble; I just want to introduce someone to you.”

“You’ve grown up, huh? If it’s someone you like, they must have good character. Bring them over so Grandpa can take a look.”

“Just remember, Grandpa, you can’t make things difficult for her.”

“Do you really not trust your grandpa? Would I make things hard for a junior?”

“Well, you never know.”

“Feeling cheeky, are we?”

“Grandpa, my signal is bad, so I’ll hang up now, okay? Bye!” Yu Zhuyi quickly cut off the call before his grandfather could finish, not wanting to endure an hour of his nagging.

After hanging up, Yu Zhuyi lay on his bed, pondering how to bring up the idea of introducing his sister to his grandfather the next day. Lost in thought, he soon drifted off to sleep.
