### Chapter 27: Taking Statements

The atmosphere grew increasingly tense.

Yen Xinfei pushed through the crowd, stopping a short distance from the man holding a knife. With a calm demeanor, she addressed him, "Maybe we can talk this out. There's no need to be so impulsive."

He scoffed, "Talk? What’s there to talk about? This worthless girl wants to break up with me and is out chasing after some pretty boy." The more he thought about it, the more agitated he became, his hand gripping the knife shaking with his anger.

Meanwhile, the girl who was being held hostage was crying profusely, pleading with him.

Yen Xinfei maintained her composed expression and spoke in a soothing voice, "Could there be a misunderstanding here? After all..."

Her words carried a calming energy that seemed to ease the tension in the air.

From a distance, Yu Zhuoyi spotted Yen Xinfei stepping forward to engage with the armed man and was immediately alarmed. He rushed toward her.

The knife-wielding man began to appear less agitated, a subtle shift that Yen Xinfei noticed. She attempted to keep the conversation going with him, hoping to divert his focus while searching for an opportunity to subdue him.

At that moment, Yu Zhuoyi arrived at her side. She quickly silenced him, positioning him safely behind her.

The man with the knife seemed lost in thought, his grip on the weapon loosening as it drifted away from the girl's neck. He looked like he was about to speak.

Suddenly, Yen Xinfei kicked the knife from his hand and swiftly restrained his arms, bringing him under control.

Just then, the police arrived on the scene, handcuffing the man.

Unbeknownst to Yen Xinfei, Yu Zhuoyi had already called the police earlier.

Without hesitation, Yu Zhuoyi rushed forward and embraced Yen Xinfei, breathlessly saying, "You scared me to death, sister! I was really terrified! You have no idea how scared I was for you. Promise me, next time you encounter something dangerous, don’t rush in like that. What would I do if something happened to you?"

He choked on his words.

Yen Xinfei comforted the little one in her arms, replying with a hint of exasperation, "You need to trust me. I can take care of myself. He wouldn't have been able to hurt me."

Ignoring her reassurances, he continued to cling to her. Finally, she relented, "Fine, fine! I promise, next time I won't jump in."

But she knew that making a promise was one thing; keeping it was another entirely. Yen Xinfei internally acknowledged her own decision.

Nearby, the police officers felt a bit awkward witnessing the exchange, a pang of bittersweetness hitting them as they were inadvertently served a dose of 'dog food' – a term for witnessing a display of affection.

After a while, Yu Zhuoyi finally released her from his grip. A police officer stepped forward, a bit embarrassed, and said, "I've heard from those around that you managed to subdue the knife-wielding man. Young lady, you’re incredibly brave and quite skilled! But remember, your safety comes first in dangerous situations. I need you to cooperate and come with us to the station to give a statement."

Yen Xinfei was puzzled by why everyone seemed to think of her as weak; she was a powerful figure, after all! Why wouldn’t she step in?

But she could only nod in agreement and took Yu Zhuoyi with her to the police station to provide their statements.

Once there, she learned the backstory of the incident. It turned out that the man had relentlessly pursued the girl, and out of frustration from his persistent advances, she had reluctantly agreed to date him. However, as time went on, he grew increasingly suspicious and even violent, leading her to end the relationship. He refused to accept her decision, forcing her to leave without his consent.

Somehow, he found out where she was and saw her having lunch with a male colleague. In reality, the colleague was just a coworker whom she wanted to thank for helping her with a work-related issue just days before; their lunch had no romantic undertones.

The man followed her throughout the day, and later in the evening, when he confronted her about getting back together and was met with rejection, he resorted to threatening her with a knife, leading to the earlier scene.

After finishing their statements, it was already 11:30 PM.

Yen Xinfei looked at the cute little guy beside her, visibly exhausted. "Let’s go, I’ll drive you home."

Noticing her fatigue, Yu Zhuoyi said, "I’ll drive!" He offered immediately.

Yen Xinfei nodded, not insisting otherwise.

When they finally returned home, it was past midnight. After saying goodnight to Yu Zhuoyi, she fell into bed, ready to sleep.
