**Chapter 33: The Surge of Dark Springs**

In the warm glow of the afternoon sun, Wen Qingzhi's eyes sparkled with joy and gratitude. “Thank you, Brother Song Lin!” she exclaimed, her voice sweet and melodic.

Song Lin, a bit clumsy and bashful, scratched the back of his head and replied, “No need to mention it!” 

For a fleeting moment, he wondered if he was being overly sensitive. After all, Wen Qingzhi was such a polite and gentle person. Why had he thought otherwise just moments ago? 

If there were a tea connoisseur present, they would surely say, “Wake up! She's just pretending to be delicate to fool you, you big fool.” 

Song “Big Fool” Lin was currently floating on cloud nine.

Thus, Wen Qingzhi and her companions walked in the opposite direction of Yan Xinfeng and her crew. 

The entire journey, Wen Qingzhi stayed close to Song Lin, who felt like a deer caught in headlights, his heart racing as if he were gliding through the air.

Gu Zihan, unable to bear the sight, averted his eyes, opting for blissful ignorance.

Twenty minutes later, with her feet beginning to ache painfully, Wen Qingzhi halted and, with a sweet, delicate tone, said to Song Lin, “Brother Song Lin, I’m really tired. My feet are about to give out. Can we take a break?”

Song Lin felt pleased to hear this, his heart swelling with a sense of purpose. Just as he was about to agree, Gu Zihan interrupted.

“It's already past ten o'clock. If we don’t hurry, we won’t find anyone willing to offer us lunch. What are we eating for lunch?” Gu Zihan remarked, his tone devoid of sympathy.

Wen Qingzhi pouted, reaching out with her left hand to tug at the hem of Song Lin's shirt. “But can’t we just rest for a bit? I'm really exhausted.”

Song Lin felt torn, but he couldn't bear to see Wen Qingzhi upset. He raised his voice to Gu Zihan, “You’re a big guy; can’t you wait for her a minute? What’s the big deal if we skip a meal? She’s just a girl, and she’s tired. Isn’t it okay to let her rest a bit?”

Song Lin's outburst left Gu Zihan stunned. He hadn’t expected this…

Gu Zihan felt a wave of disappointment wash over him, while Zhou Cong tugged at Song Lin's sleeve.

Realizing his mistake, Song Lin felt a twinge of regret. Yet somehow, he steeled himself and turned around to check on Wen Qingzhi.

*Ding! Faith value -1, Acting skill -1.*

*Warning! Warning! Please pay attention to earning faith value!*

In her mind, Wen Qingzhi's system kept sending alerts. She blinked rapidly, forcing a brave smile. “How about I don’t rest? I just have a blister; I can still walk.”

“No way!” Song Lin firmly rejected her suggestion. “There’s a public bench over there. Let me help you sit and rest for a bit.” He paused, looking back at the others. “You guys can go ahead first.”

Gu Zihan’s face turned a shade darker, but he ultimately chose to stay put.

*“Not loving Wen Qingzhi is like courting death!”*: Seeing Sister Qingzhi walk so far, my heart aches for her.

*“Wen Qingzhi’s loyal fan”:* Exactly! Director, how could you make Sister Qingzhi walk this long?

*“For my wife, Wen Qingzhi”:* Wife, I’m heartbroken; I can’t take it anymore!

*“I still like Qingzhi”:* Seriously, if a little girl is this tired, what’s the harm in letting her rest? You three big guys can wait a bit!

*“Sister Qingzhi’s true love fan”:* +1, my heart aches for Sister Qingzhi.

*“Ruined steps”:* What’s with you guys? Didn’t you hear Gu Zihan say we’re almost at noon? We need to find lunch ourselves!

*“Zhuang Zhou buying fish”:* Same here, we're getting delayed because of Wen Qingzhi.

*“Little Sweet Cheese”:* Those defending Wen Qingzhi are obviously her fans. Let’s just leave this livestream for Yan Xinfeng’s side.

*“A Cat and a Dog”:* I’m out!

*“Listening to the Beauty of the Morning Sun”:* Same.

…

On the other side, Yan Xinfeng seemed to wander aimlessly, yet she was secretly observing the design of the small town.

The direction she chose was wealthier, evidenced by the distinct architecture. Surprisingly, there were even a few villas here.

This indicated a strong possibility of finding someone willing to provide them with lunch.

Of course, Yan Xinfeng wouldn’t take advantage of others; she planned to offer something in return for the meal, as compensation for their hospitality.

“Sister Xinfeng, how do you know Wen Qingzhi?” Xu Xiaoxiao asked, curiously. “I feel like…”

At this point, she hesitated, unsure of how to finish her thought.

“Hm? Just like she said, why? Don’t you believe me?” Yan Xinfeng replied, raising an eyebrow.

“I just think her words sound a bit insincere. I’m not saying she’s bad; it’s just that the person she described doesn’t seem like you.” Xu Xiaoxiao finished with a playful stick-out tongue.

Yan Xinfeng reached out to pat her head. “Well, you’re not entirely wrong.”

Xu Xiaoxiao smiled shyly in response.

Meanwhile, the livestream chat exploded with activity.

*“Little Sweet Cheese”:* What just happened? I come in and see a head-patting moment!

*“I’m the Clown”:* Let go of that woman’s head! Yan Jie, come pat me too! My hair is washed and ready for your royal touch.

*“A Cat and a Dog”:* There are pink bubbles here, while over there, dark springs are surging.

*“Want to Get Rich Overnight”:* Is Wen Qingzhi’s livestream not entertaining?

*“Listening to the Beauty of the Morning Sun”:* Just came from there; don’t go, trust me. That girl’s causing a ruckus over there!

*“I’ll Kill You on the Spot”:* I can feel the fierce vibe from that side, even through the screen.

*“Fish with a Hat”:* Ahhh, I brought the civil affairs bureau here—please get married on the spot!

*“Listening to the Beauty of the Morning Sun”:* Please get married on the spot!

*“Just Being Depressed”:* Lock this couple in!

And so, the narrative flows, showcasing the contrasting dynamics between Wen Qingzhi and Song Lin, and Yan Xinfeng as they navigate their days in the small town.
