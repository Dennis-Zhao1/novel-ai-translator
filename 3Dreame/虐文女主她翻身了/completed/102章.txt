Was it really that simple of a decision?

As he gazed at the adorable girl with a look that conformed perfectly to his aesthetic, he felt increasingly satisfied. After encountering something disgusting, one must cleanse their eyes with something beautiful. Just like...

The moment Adam Song caught sight of Serena Zhou, an inexplicable sense of nervousness washed over him.

For some reason, he felt a rush of anxiety coursing through him. Serena, teasing him, began drawing circles on his palm, sending tingles up his arm. Adam felt a mix of excitement and the urge to pull away, but that wasn’t an option. His sister had already taken hold of his wrist with her other hand.

He shot her a pleading glance, one that screamed for understanding.

“Serena, you’re not going to leave me, right? We won’t be separated, will we? We’ll always be together, right?” His voice wavered slightly.

Serena was taken aback by the urgency in his tone. Truth be told, she didn't know whether she would leave this place. After all, she had just woken up to find herself here. In the apocalypse, she hadn’t died. Yet, she was uncertain if she would return to that bleak world again. But, surely not, right? She mused uncertainly.

The few seconds that Serena spent contemplating the answer felt like an eternity for Adam. Even though they were together now, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that everything was surreal, like a mirage. Deep down, he feared that any moment could shatter this illusion, revealing it all as just a dream. Even more frightening was the thought of Serena leaving him.

Honestly, these concerns shouldn’t even exist, yet he couldn’t help but worry. Forgive him for being overly anxious, but he had felt a ripple in the air just moments ago, and it had made his heart race.

With a self-deprecating smile, he thought it amusing that he would fret over something that hadn’t even happened yet. Perhaps it was the nature of those in love to feel this way, perpetually testing the waters of their partner's affections, yearning for reassurance and commitment.

Serena stopped drawing on his hand and intertwined her fingers with his. “Don’t worry, I won’t leave you. I’ll never be the one to walk away. How about we go get our marriage license early?”

Her gentle tone caught him off guard. “G-get a marriage license, Serena?” Adam stuttered, still grappling with his unease.

He was left speechless, stumbling over his words as he struggled to keep up with her train of thought. “Isn’t that a bit too soon? I haven’t even met your parents yet…” he mumbled, his face burning red.

He had completely forgotten his earlier anxiety, not realizing that while Serena had promised not to leave, she hadn’t guaranteed she wouldn’t leave passively. Had he known that earlier, things might have turned out differently...

“Oh, so you mean we can get the license, but we need to meet the parents first?” Serena teased him, her eyes sparkling. “I get it now. You want me to go to your house and propose, right? That’s doable.”

“W-wait, you’re going to propose?” Adam stammered, feeling even more flustered.

“Of course! Isn’t that how it’s supposed to be?” she replied, her brow furrowing in innocent confusion.

She clearly forgot that traditionally, it was usually the guy who proposed to the girl. But Serena was no ordinary girl.

Adam’s cheeks flushed a deep crimson as he awkwardly protested, “B-but... you’re a girl. I’m the boy here; it’s not right for a girl to propose!”

Serena’s eyes lit up with realization. “Oh, so that’s what you were worried about! No problem, then you can propose to me instead!”

“Alright... alright! Don’t worry, I’ll treat you well from now on!” Adam promised, silently vowing to shower her with affection, spend all his money on her, and make sure she was well-fed and happy.

“Don’t worry about it. Just focus on being beautiful, while I handle the earning. Spend my money however you like; I’ll make sure you’re healthy and happy,” Serena replied with a wave of her hand, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

Hearing her promise left Adam feeling deeply touched. There was a familiarity in her words that he couldn’t quite place at that moment, but it warmed his heart nonetheless. And just like that, their life-changing decision was made so simply.

———————————Scene Break———————————

At the same moment, in a bar called Nightshade...

The half-open door of the bar let in a mysterious glow, illuminating the swirling haze of smoke and the scent of liquor that permeated the air. Sounds of laughter, chatter, and music blended into a chaotic yet familiar symphony.

The dimly lit bar had an alluring atmosphere, where light trickled down into colorful glasses filled with various drinks, creating a mesmerizing visual that seemed to pull one deeper into its embrace.

In one of the quieter booths, a striking figure sat on a leather sofa, exuding an aura of beauty reminiscent of a flower blooming at dawn. With sharp, captivating eyes and a slight pout that hinted at mischief, they appeared lost in thought, swirling a glass of red wine gently as if contemplating a complex riddle.

Though their demeanor seemed rebellious, those clear eyes held an innocent charm. To some, this image was irresistibly enticing, sparking a desire to draw closer, to color those bright eyes with passion and life.

“Ugh…” Zhao Min sighed once more.

Ever since he returned from an outing at the amusement park with his best friend, Chao Yixiu, he had felt something shift within him. He realized that seeing Chao made his heart race, and any casual contact left him blushing, feelings stirring inside him that he never expected.

In the past, he would never have reacted this way. What was happening to him? Was he really lacking female companionship? Could it be that he was finally of the age to seek out a girlfriend?

Otherwise, why would he entertain such impure thoughts about his best friend?

Zhao Min found himself berating his own feelings. To escape the tension, he had deliberately avoided Chao and decided to come to the bar alone, hoping to find a girlfriend instead.

---————————Mini Scene————————---

Zhao Min: How did I end up like this, developing feelings for my best friend?

Chao Yixiu: (('▽`)/ Wow~ Love you!

Zhao Min: No way, I need to find a woman outside!

Chao Yixiu: (His smile falters, frozen in disbelief) No, I won’t allow you to look for someone else!!!
