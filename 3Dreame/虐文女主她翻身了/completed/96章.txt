**Chapter 96: A Sense of Wariness**

Yvonne smiled gently as she introduced her adorable friend to the others, but she couldn't shake off the feeling of malicious gazes directed at her. She paused slightly, not needing to turn around to know exactly where the hostility was coming from. It wasn’t that she had some extraordinary insight; rather, she was all too familiar with that piercing glare. She had felt it many times before, especially from the dog-like male lead and his shining star.

On the surface, she maintained her composure, continuing to engage in light conversation with those around her, but internally, she had begun to build up her defenses.

As soon as Yvonne entered the banquet, Mr. Xu had already taken notice of her. He initially planned to approach her right away, but he found himself surrounded by several seasoned business moguls, caught up in a web of flattery and mutual praise that he couldn’t escape. Pretending to be deeply engaged in conversation, his thoughts, however, had already drifted over to Yvonne. 

He had always wanted to cultivate a good relationship with her—not just for personal gain, but because he genuinely respected her sharp business acumen and impressive skills, which, frankly, often surpassed his own. Deep down, he admired her, perhaps even idolized her.

Finally, he spotted the late-arriving Xu Xiaoxiao. This was his chance. He called out to her as she strolled over, "Xiaoxiao, come here. I want to introduce you to someone." With a tone that hinted at an apology to his business partners, he added, "Sorry, I need to take Xiaoxiao to meet someone of her age."

The business associates could only watch as he led Xu Xiaoxiao away. They all understood that it was rare for Mr. Xu’s daughter to appear at such events, so it was only natural that he would want her to meet people in the industry.

Xu Xiaoxiao followed her father reluctantly. She despised these kinds of gatherings, where everyone seemed to be scheming to benefit themselves at her expense. Why did they target her? Because they couldn’t get close to her father, they turned to her instead. 

She remembered a time in her childhood when she had a close friend, believing their bond was genuine, only to realize later that her friend was merely using her to gain access to her father's company. Ever since that experience, she had grown to loathe these events, finding everyone around her to be insufferably hypocritical. 

This aversion had led to her being almost completely unknown as Mr. Xu’s daughter in her everyday life. She never volunteered that information and was rather pleased to keep that layer of her identity hidden, for it allowed her to...

Mr. Xu finally extricated himself from the clutches of the old foxes and let out a sigh of relief. He glanced back at his daughter, who was trailing behind him with a lackluster expression, and felt a pang of sympathy. He knew that childhood friendship had left her with some emotional scars, but there was little he could do about it. 

Watching her compare unfavorably to other girls her age—lacking the playful spirit of childhood and surrounded by no real friends—only deepened his concerns. He felt that his daughter was far too lonely. Who would have thought that the malice he had encountered would find its way to his daughter, exploiting her innocence instead?

As he sighed heavily at the thought, Xu Xiaoxiao's boredom was suddenly interrupted when her eyes lit up, spotting a familiar figure. She tugged at her father’s sleeve and whispered eagerly, “Who’s that?”

Mr. Xu, taken aback by the sparkle in her eyes, followed her gaze and was surprised to see Yvonne. Curiosity piqued, he asked, “What’s going on here?”

Ignoring her father’s astonished expression, Xu Xiaoxiao exclaimed, “She’s the wonderful sister I met on the reality show I auditioned for!” 

With that, she eagerly pulled her father towards Yvonne to greet her.
