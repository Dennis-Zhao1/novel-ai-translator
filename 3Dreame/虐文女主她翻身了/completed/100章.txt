She couldn’t understand…

Yan Xinfei looked toward the source of that strange power.

She knew it had to be Wen Qingzhi.

It had been a long time since she had seen this character bouncing around in front of her. She was almost starting to forget that such a person existed.

But now it seemed that Wen Qingzhi appeared to be a bit weak. After just a small counterattack against that force, her face turned pale.

Someone who didn’t know better might think that Yan Xinfei had bullied Wen Qingzhi.

Where did she get the confidence to attack others so casually?

One could only assume that this time, Wen Qingzhi had learned her lesson and would quiet down for a bit.

Just then, Xu Zhengwei's opening remarks for the banquet had come to an end.

After a while, Wen Qingzhi finally felt less weak and managed to straighten her body with some effort.

She glared at the curvaceous figure of Yan Xinfei.

Desperately, she called out to the system in her mind.

【System, system, what just happened? Why was there a force that stopped me from attacking Yan Xinfei? Where did that power come from? How could this be…】

【…Apologies… apologies… Host… that power seemed to have originated from the one you attempted to attack… …bzzt… sorry, the system you called has entered sleep mode… bzzt…】

Hearing that the power had actually come from Yan Xinfei made Wen Qingzhi's anger outweigh her surprise.

She couldn't understand why Yan Xinfei had…

After all, she was the protagonist of this world, wasn’t she?

If she wasn’t the female lead of this world, then how could she possess the protagonist’s halo and be reborn?

She naturally believed that, since she was the female lead, everyone else should…

The warm crystal chandeliers in the banquet hall slowly blossomed in her heart like sunflowers. The black-and-white checkered tablecloth was adorned with transparent goblets filled with red liquid. A gentle shake sent ripples spreading out, while the purple curtains fluttered in the wind. The walls, with their mosaic design of black and white, exuded a deep and noble elegance.

Surrounded by the hustle and bustle, the lights twinkled brightly, glasses clinked in celebration, and the fragrant aroma of wine wafted from the clinking glasses, mingling in the lively crowd.

Soft and melodious music floated through the air, gently drifting in the spacious, deep banquet hall. The fragrance of flowers mingled with the glamour of the guests, an assembly of the elite and the wealthy.

Elegant businessmen held glasses of wine, chatting in groups of three or five, their smiles bright and inviting. Laughter filled the air, their faces adorned with sweet smiles, while the men stood tall and the women exuded charm, weaving through the crowd, their gazes captivating and dazzling.

This should have been a scene filled with joy and warmth, but she felt nothing…

All she experienced was an overwhelming sense of panic.

Deep down, a voice whispered that if she continued to let Yan Xinfei exist without destroying her, she would never surpass Yan Xinfei, and she would always be overshadowed by her.

That was something she couldn’t allow.

She believed that in this primitive and backward world, she should stand above others. How could she allow anyone to be better than her?

However, she also understood that now was not the time to eliminate Yan Xinfei; she needed to plan carefully. She refused to believe she couldn’t defeat the people in this lowly world.

A flash of determination crossed Wen Qingzhi's eyes.
