Chapter 37: She Actually Did That, Leaving Everyone Stunned

Xu Xiaoxiao rubbed her round belly with a contented look on her face. There was no helping it; the food was just too delicious. Even though she was already full, she simply couldn’t stop herself from eating more a moment ago.

Everyone around her praised Yan Xinfai’s cooking skills.

**[I Love Sour and Spicy Noodles]**: Wow, these dishes look so good; they seem delicious just by appearance!

**[Sweet and Sour Ribs]**: I hope these dishes aren't just pretty to look at. Seriously, if they taste as good as they look, what’s the point of living?

**[Little Bunny]**: The previous commenter is going to be disappointed. Just look at how satisfied they are after eating; you can tell it’s incredible!

**[Red Date Pastry Chef]**: I can’t believe they invited the staff to eat with them too.

**[Thank Goodness]**: So envious! I wish I could be part of the crew just to taste the food made by Sister Yan.

**[Little Mouse Pad]**: Staff, put down your chopsticks; let me take over!

At that moment, another group of people arrived at the grandmother’s villa, delayed by Wen Qingzhi because they hadn’t had lunch yet. They approached the half-open door, and without knocking, Wen Qingzhi pushed the door open and walked in, with Song Lin following closely behind.

Gu Zihan hesitated to follow them inside. He felt it was rude to enter someone else's home without the owner's permission. Zhou Cong also paused his steps.

Unable to hold back, they reminded, “Aren’t you going to knock and ask the owner for permission before entering?”

Wen Qingzhi looked at him disdainfully. “Did you not see that the door is already open? If it’s open, it means we can go in. I’m starving right now.”

Song Lin, slightly impatient, added, “If you guys don’t want to go in, then we’ll just go ourselves.” Without waiting for their response, he grabbed Wen Qingzhi’s hand and walked in.

Gu Zihan’s face turned pale, standing still without following them.

Zhou Cong took a couple of steps forward but then returned to Gu Zihan’s side.

Gu Zihan glanced at him with a raised eyebrow but said nothing.

After a moment of silence, Zhou Cong finally couldn’t hold back and asked, “What should we do? Should we follow them?”

“Do you want to go in?” Gu Zihan asked coldly.

Zhou Cong scratched his head, feeling embarrassed. “I don’t want to, but they’ve already gone in, right? Even if I’m usually not reliable and my brain isn’t always sharp, I know that entering someone’s yard without the owner’s permission is trespassing.”

“Just wait,” Gu Zihan replied icily.

Xu Xiaoxiao looked puzzled as she turned to Yan Xinfai beside her. “Sister Xinfai, did you hear any noises? I think I heard Wen Qingzhi’s voice.”

Yan Xinfai nodded. She had heard them very clearly while they stood at the door.

She was taken aback that the male lead’s so-called “white moonlight” could be so thoughtless, barging into someone else’s yard right in front of so many viewers in the live broadcast.

However, she couldn’t help but appreciate the two dimwits standing at the door.

Yan Xinfai stood up and apologized to the grandmother. “I’m sorry, Grandma. It seems some of our fellow participants from the variety show have come in uninvited. I’ll go check it out.”

Yan Xinfai walked toward the yard, and Xu Xiaoxiao hurried to follow.

Realizing that someone had entered without permission, the grandmother felt slightly displeased and also made her way toward the newcomers.

**[The Monk Can’t Resist Temptation]**: Wen Qingzhi and the others are pitiful; they haven’t eaten yet and it’s already so late!

**[The Lunch Box Raider]**: Wen Qingzhi is being so rude (disdainful).

**[Early Love Boosts IQ]**: Compared to Sister Xinfai, Wen Qingzhi’s upbringing seems to have been eaten by a dog.

**[Retired Contrarian Auntie]**: Wen Qingzhi and her group are just really hungry, that’s why they went in directly.

**[Cuihua on the Run from the Village]**: If that’s the case, then Zhou Cong and his group must be really hungry too, yet they’re standing at the door waiting. Isn’t that right?

**[Flying Pig Spirit]**: The previous commenter is right; even Zhou Cong, that dimwit, knows it’s rude to enter without the owner's permission.

**[Cheese is Power]**: I’m laughing so hard; Zhou Cong is such a fool!

As Wen Qingzhi and Song Lin walked along the path, they observed the design of the yard.

Wen Qingzhi noted that, in this remote little town, the villa's yard looked quite luxurious, not at all inferior to those in the capital.

She felt a sense of indignation, thinking it was unfair that people could live so lavishly even in such a remote area.

Yan Xinfai raised an eyebrow, observing the jealousy that flashed across Wen Qingzhi’s face, feeling utterly speechless.
