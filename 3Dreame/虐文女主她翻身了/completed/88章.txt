**Together With You...**

After a long while, the restless energy in the air finally began to fade away.

Yu Zhuyi gently nudged the charming Yan Xinfai, who was still holding him close. At first, Yan Xinfai didn’t respond, but after a moment, he slowly loosened his grip just a little.

“Hmm~ Why are you still like this?” Yan Xinfai teased.

Yu Zhuyi blushed, mumbling a retort, “It’s all because you’re too amazing, sister.”

Deep down, he thought to himself: My lung capacity is just fine; it’s not that I’m weak—it’s just that my sister is too strong...

Yan Xinfai let out a light laugh and changed the subject. “I have a banquet to attend tonight.”

Upon hearing that his sister would be going to a banquet, Yu Zhuyi felt a twinge of disappointment. It meant that he couldn’t see her tonight, and she hadn’t mentioned taking him along either. His mood dimmed a little.

He mumbled in response, “Mm.”

Yan Xinfai reached out and pinched his cheek. She didn’t hold back, but when she released her grip, she noticed two red marks on his face. Feeling a bit guilty, she withdrew her hand, reminding herself that the little cutie couldn’t see her expression right now.

“What’s wrong? You look a bit down,” she asked, concerned.

“Nothing...” Yu Zhuyi lowered his gaze.

In the next moment, Yan Xinfai loosened her embrace. Yu Zhuyi felt a pang of anxiety and quickly looked up, fearing that he had upset her with his words.

“Sister, I’m sorry…”

In truth, Yan Xinfai only wanted to change to a more comfortable position because the current one made it hard to see the cute expressions on his face.

“What’s with the sudden apology?” she asked, reaching out to gently rub the corner of his eye with her fingertip.

When she noticed a hint of redness forming at the corner of his eye, she pulled her hand back, a mischievous thought creeping into her mind. She wanted to see the little cutie cry, to beg for mercy—ideally while...

She suppressed her playful intentions and ended up pulling him back into her embrace again. 

“Talk to me, okay~?”

The last syllable made his cheeks flush bright red.

“You’re going to the banquet tonight, so does that mean you need to find a male companion?” he asked.

As soon as Yan Xinfai heard his words, she understood where his feelings of discontent were coming from and couldn’t help but chuckle. She pretended to ponder thoughtfully, but in reality, she wanted to tease him a bit.

“Well, that’s true,” she confirmed.

Hearing her acknowledgment, Yu Zhuyi’s eyes began to redden.

Yan Xinfai tucked away her thoughts and comforted him. “It’s true that I need a male companion for the banquet. I hadn’t brought one before, and tonight I intended to ask you... but it seems like you don’t really want to go?”

Yu Zhuyi didn’t catch the teasing tone in her voice and hurriedly explained, “No, sister, I do want to go, really!”

“Alright, alright, I believe you,” she replied.

“Then will you let me go as your male companion tonight?” Yu Zhuyi asked, though his tone had a hint of inevitability.

“Of course!” 

Upon hearing his sister’s affirmative answer, he let out a sigh of relief, feeling a swell of happiness. How wonderful it was that she agreed to let him be her male companion! Tonight, everyone would know he was her date, and soon enough, everyone would realize he was her boyfriend.

The more he thought about it, the happier he became, a smile spreading across his face, his eyes sparkling with joy like stars in the night sky, captivating anyone who looked.

“Hmm~ Are you that happy?” she teased.

“Of course!” 

Just as he finished speaking, a loud grumble erupted from his stomach, breaking the moment of bliss and instantly filling the air with awkwardness. Yu Zhuyi’s face turned beet red in embarrassment.

Yan Xinfai paused, then burst into bright laughter. “It’s getting late. Should we eat?”

“Mm.” Yu Zhuyi nodded, his demeanor drooping like a wilting flower.

Heavens could bear witness; she genuinely hadn’t intended to laugh at him, only found his flustered expression too adorable.

Yan Xinfai recognized his embarrassment and straightened her face. Swiftly, she opened the takeout box that the little cutie had brought.
