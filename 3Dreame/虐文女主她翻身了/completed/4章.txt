In a classy private room, the table was covered with an array of colorful, expensive wines. Three handsome men were gathered there, enjoying their drinks, laughter, and lively conversation.

One of the more flamboyant men, with a slight smirk on his face, raised his glass and said, "Hey, Adam, what’s your secret? We’re all university students here, but you seem to shine brighter than the rest of us. You started your own company without relying on your family’s money or connections, and look at how successful it is! My dad keeps saying if only I had even a fraction of your talent..."

His bragging filled the room, but just as he was riding the wave of his own praise, a cool, detached voice cut through the air, "You talk too much, like a fly buzzing in my ear."

Ethan Zhou blinked in confusion, his brow furrowing as he turned to Adam. "What does that mean?"

He seemed like a naive, good-natured guy, easily baffled by the sarcasm. 

A third man, wearing elegant gold-rimmed glasses, chuckled at Ethan's expense. "What Adam means is that you’re being annoying, just like a fly buzzing around. Seriously, we all received nine years of compulsory education; why can't you understand that?"

Adam let out a scoff, "Maybe he slipped through the cracks?"

Ethan, now visibly frustrated, retorted, "You guys are ganging up on me again! Why do you always pick on me?"

Adam shot him a sharp glance with his dark eyes, and Ethan fell silent, the air thick with unspoken tension. Adam had cast a long shadow over Ethan ever since they were kids, and in their circle, no one dared to challenge him.

"By the way, did you hear the latest gossip? That girl who always follows Lu Xiuming around, the one who’s practically his lapdog—Yvonne Yan—she actually cursed him out recently! Can you believe it? Do you guys think she really doesn’t like Lu Xiuming anymore, or is she just trying a different tactic to get his attention?" 

Chao Yixiu raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "How do you know that?"

"Don't worry about it; I just know," Ethan replied, leaning back with a conspiratorial grin. "I mean, wasn't Yvonne head over heels for Lu Xiuming? She followed him around like a lost puppy, and now suddenly she’s flipping the script? I say it’s a good thing if she’s finally seen through that jerk. Lu Xiuming pretends to hate her while he’s still using the benefits she brings him. Honestly, he's just a scumbag—playing with her feelings while keeping her on the hook. I really don’t get why Yvonne would even like that cold-hearted guy."

Ethan shook his head, tsking in disbelief. "I swear, women in love can be so clueless."

Noticing that no one was paying attention to him, Ethan nudged Adam. "Hey, come on, say something."

Adam ignored him, taking another sip of his drink, clearly uninterested in the gossip.

Chao Yixiu adjusted his glasses and chimed in, “If you’re that curious, why don’t you just ask Yvonne directly?”

Ethan pouted, "Yeah, right! I’d be too scared. She’s the head of the Yan family, and my dad constantly talks about her entrepreneurial skills and management tactics. I’m already intimidated by her just hearing about her! There’s no way I’d dare ask her that in person; I’d just be asking for a beating!"

As he spoke, the conversation shifted again, and Ethan heard Adam say, "And yet, you still talk about others behind their backs? It’s all just rumors in this circle; who knows what’s true?"

With that, Adam stood up, grabbed his sleek black coat from the sofa, and made his exit, leaving a mix of confusion and intrigue lingering in the air.
