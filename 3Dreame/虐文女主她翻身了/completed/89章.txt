The affection in his eyes was unmistakable.

A rich, aromatic scent wafted through the air, enveloping them in warmth. The dishes in the lunch box looked appealing, their fragrance filling the room. Compared to the first meal she had prepared, it was clear that the cook had put in a lot of heart into this one.

Even though Adam had initially insisted that Clara shouldn’t cook for her, she still longed to make meals for her sister. After all, there was something incredibly fulfilling about sharing a meal that you had made yourself with someone you cherished.

At first, Adam had discouraged Clara from cooking for her, believing those delicate hands shouldn’t be sullied in the kitchen. Yet, Clara’s eagerness to prepare food for her sister was impossible to deny. In the end, Adam relented but set rules: Clara could only prepare one or two dishes at a time, and she had to be careful not to hurt herself. If she did, Adam would refuse to let her cook for her again.

Today's menu consisted of simple home-cooked dishes: sautéed mushrooms and sweet and sour ribs.

They adhered to the principle of silence during meals, a quiet reverence for the food they shared. But even amidst this peaceful atmosphere, the surrounding air buzzed with the tranquility of a beautiful day.

It was noon, and the bright sunlight danced through the window, chasing away the shadows of the office and bathing the room in a golden glow, filling it with the warmth of the sun. Sitting together on the office sofa, the two of them looked like a stunning mural—perfect and enviable.

As was customary, after finishing their meal, Adam would return to work while Clara would rest in the office lounge for a while before Adam would take her to school. However, today was different; Clara didn’t have to return to school in the afternoon. Being a senior, most of her classes were already completed. There were occasional exceptions where the school required attendance for certain lectures.

Knowing Clara didn’t need to go back, Adam decided to let her sleep a little longer today, allowing her to rest undisturbed in the lounge while she continued her work.

As evening approached, the sky was painted with fiery hues of sunset, the clouds glowing a radiant orange, clustering together in a breathtaking display. Gradually, the sunset transformed into little flames, growing larger, the upper part fading while the lower half deepened into a blood-red hue. The vibrant red reflected beautifully against Adam’s silhouette.

Clara awoke and pushed open the door to the lounge, only to be greeted by this mesmerizing scene that made her heart race. She halted mid-motion, captivated by the picturesque moment unfolding before her.

Adam had noticed the moment Clara walked in, especially when she caught her with that… well, a gaze that could only be described as burning with affection.

With a smile in her eyes, Adam lifted her head and beckoned Clara closer with a delicate curl of her finger, softly saying, “Come here.”

At those words, Clara instinctively moved towards her sister. As Clara approached, Adam reached out with her left arm, pulling her into a warm embrace, while her right hand gently tousled Clara’s hair, which had become a bit messy from her long nap.

“Hmm~ What’s wrong? What were you thinking about?” Adam asked playfully.

Once nestled in her sister’s arms, Clara finally registered Adam’s question. Feeling a wave of shyness wash over her, she buried her face against Adam’s collarbone, her ears turning a light shade of pink.

“Nothing… I wasn’t thinking about anything. By the way, why didn’t you wake me up again?” Clara stammered.

“Hmm, I thought you looked tired and wanted to let you sleep a bit longer. What, you don’t want to sleep here with me? Or do you want me to join you?” Adam teased, a playful glint in her eye.

“Adam!” Clara’s face flushed bright red at her sister’s words, and she instinctively hid her face deeper into Adam’s shoulder.

“Hmm~?” Adam leaned in closer, her warm breath tickling Clara’s sensitive ear, watching as Clara’s ear turned a shade so red it seemed like it might bleed.

Feeling the heat radiating from her sister’s playful actions, Clara shivered involuntarily.

Noticing Clara’s reaction, Adam decided to stop teasing her. “Alright, are you coming down yet? We need to head to the banquet soon. Or do you want me to carry you?”

Clara quickly released her hold on Adam. “No, I can walk by myself. Let’s go right now!”

With that, she stood up, pulling Adam along with her as they prepared to leave.
