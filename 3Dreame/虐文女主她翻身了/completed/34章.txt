**Chapter 34: The Exchange of the Jade Pendant**

Yan Xinfei and Lucy Xu stumbled upon a charming villa designed with a blend of traditional Chinese and European styles. The villa's exterior featured gray-white walls adorned with dark tiles, intricate window grilles, and small, scenic openings that exuded a rich classical charm. The gate was elegantly crafted and harmoniously matched the overall architecture, subtly revealing the mysterious allure of old-world China.

Standing before the ornate entrance, Yan Xinfei extended her soft, fair right hand and knocked firmly on the half-open door, calling out, “Excuse me, is anyone home?”

After a brief pause, a strong voice replied from within, “What can I do for you?” The sound of footsteps echoed, approaching steadily.

An elderly woman, over fifty, appeared. Her weathered face bore the marks of time, with deep-set, bright eyes that sparkled with life. Her hair was neatly styled, and she wore a vintage Zhongshan suit, walking with a straight back, unhurried yet purposeful.

Yan Xinfei politely asked, “Hello, ma’am. We’re here for a variety show, and I was wondering if I could trade you this jade pendant for a lunch?”

As she spoke, she produced a warm, lustrous jade pendant from her pocket, its translucent quality and superior texture clearly visible as she offered it to the grandmother.

Standing beside her, Lucy's eyes sparkled as she gazed at the pendant. Although she wasn't particularly fond of jade, she could tell this was a piece of Hetian jade, which easily fetched a market price of at least $5,000. Hetian jade was typically found in high-altitude, uninhabited areas, making it quite rare. To see it offered for just a meal was bewildering—truly, the world of the wealthy was beyond her understanding.

As Yan Xinfei spoke, the elderly woman nodded to herself, thinking: These two girls are quite nice, polite even. They are nothing like those who came before to film; those people didn’t even greet her, treating her like a servant, demanding her to cater to their needs.

Since then, the elderly woman had developed a dislike for the show’s crew. However, these two girls clearly pleased her.

The old lady’s eyes lit up with appreciation at the sight of the jade pendant, though she kept a stern expression as she curiously inquired, “Do you know what this is, young lady?”

“Of course! This is a token of appreciation for providing us lunch. Please accept it,” Yan Xinfei said, gently placing the pendant into the old woman’s rough, calloused hand.

The grandmother's face broke into a radiant smile, reminiscent of a blooming chrysanthemum.

This jade pendant was precisely what the old lady had been searching for but couldn’t acquire, even after trying to buy it through others.

Without further hesitation, she decided to gift Yan Xinfei a set of prayer beads she had treasured for many years.

“Come in, girls,” the old lady said warmly.

Lucy took a quick glance at the grandmother leading the way and then whispered to Yan Xinfei, “Sis Xinfei, how do you carry Hetian jade with you? Aren’t you afraid of losing it?”

Yan Xinfei assumed Lucy was simply enamored with the pendant, having noticed her eager stare moments earlier. With a smile, she produced another Hetian jade pendant from her bag and offered it to Lucy. “If you like it, I have more for you.”

Yan Xinfei found Lucy to be an adorable girl, and the pendant held little value for her—she had plenty more in her storage space.

That’s right; these pendants were just some of the less conspicuous ones she had taken from her storage. In this post-apocalyptic world, such items were practically worthless, even less than a single pack of instant noodles.

The filming crew, observing the increasing viewership in the live comments, noted the surge in engagement.

[**Activating Death Wish Mode**]: Am I seeing this right? I can’t believe this is the world of the wealthy! Just giving away a jade pendant like that?

[**Wen Xiaoyu Huange**]: +1, I don't get it either.

[**Imposter Lady**]: The key point is, it was just to trade for a simple lunch in town.

[**Cool and Comedic**]: So what if it’s just a jade pendant?

[**I Have Chains**]: It must not be worth much.

[**Dandelion Floats Away**]: I think so too, I really do.

[**Look at This Season's Withered Flowers**]: The previous comments are hilarious. What do you mean “just a jade pendant”? If you can, go ahead and grab one yourself!

[**Jade Expert**]: I can appraise jade. If I’m not mistaken, that’s Hetian jade. Even though it’s worth around $5,000, finding Hetian jade is challenging, and it’s not something you can easily buy even with money.

[**Unforgettable Yet Unseen**]: Those saying jade is worthless just got slapped in the face, haha!

Lucy, nervously cradling the jade pendant in her hands, protested, “No, this is too precious; I can’t accept it!” She attempted to return it to Yan Xinfei.

With a slight frown, Yan Xinfei offered a troubled yet gentle smile. “Once I give something away, I don't take it back. Just keep the pendant; it’s yours now.”

Gratefully, Lucy held the pendant close and sincerely thanked her. She carefully placed it into the inner pocket of her bag, checking to ensure it wouldn't fall out, breathing a sigh of relief as she did—worried about damaging or losing such a precious item.
