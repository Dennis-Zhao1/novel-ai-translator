### Chapter 42: Another Skill of Sister Yan

As they watched, the others struggled a bit, producing only brown pottery, much of it containing iron, which wasn’t very valuable. But for their first attempt at making ceramics, they felt quite pleased with themselves, as the pieces at least looked decent.

The owner was so excited that his hands trembled, and he asked Yan Xinfei, “Have you studied this before?”

“I studied for a week, but I had to stop for certain reasons,” she replied casually.

“You have a talent! You know, even masters who have studied for years might not be able to fire pottery as well as you. Are you interested in working here? I can offer you a high salary,” he said, his enthusiasm growing.

Yan Xinfei hesitated and said, “I’m sorry, but I’m not interested at the moment.”

The owner looked disappointed but was reluctant to give up. He handed her a business card, saying, “If you ever change your mind, feel free to contact me anytime.”

Yan Xinfei accepted the card with polite acknowledgment. Then she reminded the owner, “We’d like to work here for an afternoon, if that’s alright…”

“Sure! I’ll pay you each 100 yuan per hour. Does that work?” he agreed immediately.

“Sounds good, thank you!” 

Xu Xiaoxiao understood that the owner only allowed them to work for the afternoon because of Yan Xinfei's presence. After all, the things they made were hardly sellable; if it weren’t for Yan Xinfei, the owner would never have agreed to let them work there.

Wen Qingzhi’s face twisted with jealousy as she glared at Yan Xinfei, wishing she could…

[VIP Patient in the Mental Hospital]: Wow, Sister Yan is truly versatile; she can even do ceramics!

[I Have Spicy Strips; Will You Come with Me?]: So impressive, thank you (｡･ω･｡)ﾉ♡

[Long Hair to the Waist, Half Cute, Half Flirty]: She even taught the people next to her!

[Fierce Ugly Monster]: Wen Xiaobai is really not in the same league.

[Just Because I’m a Spicy Strip Youth]: There’s no comparison at all; one’s in the sky, and the other’s on the ground. Of course, Sister Yan is in the sky.

[Fairy Descends to Earth, Face Down]: You can always trust Sister Yan.

[I’m Fat Because I’m Fortunate]: As expected, there’s nothing Sister Yan can’t do.

[Beep Beep Beep, Faith Value Dropping Seriously; Please Respond Immediately][Please Respond Immediately; Please Respond Immediately]

Yan Xinfei felt a surge of power that was noticeably stronger than before, and she secretly used her mental energy to counter it.

Suddenly, Wen Qingzhi felt a sharp pain in her head, and the system’s voice disappeared.

Her face turned pale, and despite the pain, she immediately tried to respond to the system.

[Sorry, the system you’re trying to reach is currently upgrading.]

Realizing the system was still there, she sighed in relief. Although she found the situation strange, she brushed it aside. In her eyes, the system was useless, and she was the main character of this world, so nothing unexpected would ever happen.

Four hours later, they had earned a total of 600 yuan. Though it wasn't a lot, it was enough to buy ingredients for a decent dinner in this small town.

They then headed to the local market, where they once again witnessed Yan Xinfei's bargaining skills. She was just as fierce as the housewives who had been haggling for decades.

In the end, they bought some fresh fish and pork ribs, spending only a bit over 400 yuan. With the remaining money, they planned to buy some beer and peanuts.

By the time they returned to the accommodation arranged by the production team, it was almost dinner time.

Wen Qingzhi knew that Yan Xinfei could cook, so she boldly went up to her, insisting she should make dinner for everyone.

Even though Yan Xinfei had already intended to cook, being ordered around like this didn’t sit well with her…

Yan Xinfei remained silent, her gaze growing cold.

Gu Zihan and Xu Xiaoxiao’s impressions of Wen Qingzhi worsened.

Xu Xiaoxiao couldn’t hold back her frustration, “Don’t you have hands and feet? Why are you making Sister Yan cook for you?”

“Isn’t she the only one here who can cook? If she doesn’t do it, who will?” Wen Qingzhi replied as if it were the most natural thing.

Zhou Cong stepped in, “I’ll do it,” and rolled up his sleeves, heading for the kitchen.

“Hey, I’ll go too!” Gu Zihan followed him inside.

Worried about the meal they might mess up, especially since she didn’t want to go hungry that night, Yan Xinfei decided to join them.

Seeing Yan Xinfei go in, Xu Xiaoxiao followed to help.

With everyone gone, Wen Qingzhi pouted, refusing to enter the kitchen, and instead sat down on the sofa with Song Lin to watch TV.

[Grab the Tail of Hard Work]: I’m furious! Why is Wen Xiaobai like this?

[Exceeding One’s Limits ↙]: Seriously, you called her Wen Xiaobai; that’s just how she is.

[Eyes Wide Open, Ready to Compete]: This has opened my eyes. Just because someone else can do it, Wen Qingzhi thinks it’s okay to make them do all the work?

[Drunken Laughter for Three Thousand Years]: Oh, my god.

[Winds Rise, Those Fleeting Memories]: My heart aches for Sister Yan.

[The Large Chrysanthemum Blooms Red]: What’s the big deal? It’s just asking Sister Yan to cook; what’s wrong with Wen Qingzhi?

[Under the Moon, A Glass of Fragrant Wine]: It sounds like you’re one of Wen Qingzhi's die-hard fans.

[What if Ultraman Can’t Beat the Little Monster]: I think Wen Qingzhi did nothing wrong. She’s just a bit spoiled; she hasn’t done anything terrible.

[You’re Sick]: Seriously.

The viewers in the live chat were engaged in heated debates.

In the end, Yan Xinfei cooked while the others helped with simpler tasks like washing and prepping the ingredients.

After preparing the meal, Xu Xiaoxiao and the others helped bring the dishes to the dining table, constantly praising Yan Xinfei’s cooking skills.

Wen Qingzhi scoffed dismissively, “What’s so impressive about it? It’s just cooking.”

Xu Xiaoxiao retorted, “If you think it’s so easy, why don’t you do it? If you look down on it, you don’t have to eat!”

Wen Qingzhi’s face turned red with anger, “Fine, I won’t eat! You think I care?”

She threw down her chopsticks and stormed out.

Song Lin, feeling a bit reluctant, hurriedly ate a few bites before chasing after her.

Yan Xinfei curiously asked Xu Xiaoxiao, “Why did you confront her on camera? Aren’t you worried about her fans attacking you?”

She stuck out her tongue playfully, “Of course I’m worried! But you’re here, right?”

“Yeah.”

The rest of the group weren’t concerned about Wen Qingzhi; after all, she was always surrounded by staff, and Song Lin had gone after her.

They chatted happily, filling the dining table with laughter and joy.

Meanwhile, Wen Qingzhi stood outside, feeling particularly lonely. She hadn’t eaten enough, and the more she thought about it, the more aggrieved she felt, leading her to tears.

Song Lin comforted her a bit at the start but then fell silent, standing beside her.

After finishing dinner, they opened the beers they had bought, snacking on peanuts while playing games.

Yan Xinfei didn’t join in the games; instead, she leisurely sipped her drink.

Oh, and you might wonder why they didn’t invite Yan Xinfei to play with them.

It’s simple: the games they were playing were so childish. She was an expert; experts should enjoy their own beauty.
