**Chapter 26: In the Movie Theater**

As soon as they entered, the movie quickly began to play.

The opening scenes weren’t particularly terrifying. It felt just like any ordinary film, and as the movie reached its halfway point, the audience was deeply immersed in the story.

Suddenly, a figure appeared on the screen—a ghostly woman with long, unkempt hair, her eyes wide and haunting, and her complexion pale with a sickly hue. Dressed in a flowing red wedding gown, she hung her arms limply at her sides, her left hand smeared with a vivid red substance that looked like blood. 

Screams erupted from the crowd, echoing through the theater. Yan Xinfei couldn’t help but feel a bit exasperated. The special effects in this movie were laughable; the ghost's hair looked unrealistic, the red dress was more silly than scary, and the blood on her hands? It was obviously just chicken blood.

Turning to voice her thoughts to her companion, she was startled to find that he seemed to be trembling. His hands were stiff, and his face was pale.

"Wait, what?" she thought, puzzled. How could he be scared of horror movies when he had willingly bought a ticket?

She took his cold, slightly trembling hand in her warm grip, pulling him close. Leaning down to whisper in his ear, she said, “Don’t be afraid! It’s all fake!”

After several moments of comforting him, she noticed his body gradually relaxing.

“Maybe we should just leave?” she suggested, glancing at him.

“No way! We have to finish it,” Yu Zhuyi replied, clutching her sleeve and shaking his head resolutely.

Yan Xinfei was taken aback by his determination, but she decided to let him have his way. She thought he must really enjoy horror films.

In reality, Yu Zhuyi felt that this was their first date watching a movie together, and he didn’t want to spoil the moment just because he felt uneasy.

Fortunately, the film wrapped up quickly.

As they stepped out of the cinema, Yan Xinfei half-embraced Yu Zhuyi, while he clutched her clothing tightly, clearly reluctant to let go.

“How about I take you home now?” she offered after a moment’s thought.

Upon hearing her suggestion, he pulled away from her embrace, shaking his head vigorously like a bobblehead. In a soft, playful tone, he said, “Sister, no! Don’t go home so fast!”

“Okay, then let’s go for a stroll,” she decided.

“Sure!”

Yan Xinfei pulled him close again, their fingers intertwined as they walked, feeling a hint of shyness from him as he stayed by her side.

But just then, a sharp, raucous sound interrupted her thoughts. 

The source of the commotion was right across from where they stood.

A man, looking rather ordinary yet deceptively calm, brandished a knife against the neck of a sweet-looking girl who appeared utterly terrified. She trembled, her face drained of color as she pleaded, “Please, just calm down. Whatever you want, I’ll give it to you.”

Hearing her words only made the man’s expression more savage. “You little slut! You dare to go out to dinner with other men? Just watch what I’ll do…” He lightly tapped the cold blade against her cheek before pressing it firmly against her neck again.

The girl shook even more violently.

The onlookers were paralyzed with fear, not daring to intervene, worried that the man might lose control and harm someone innocent.

Yan Xinfei’s expression darkened as she turned to Yu Zhuyi. “Stay here for a moment, okay? I’ll be back quickly.” With that, she strode toward the scene of the hostage situation.

(You might wonder why Yan Xinfei didn’t use her powers here like she did when she first encountered the dog-like male lead. The truth is, this world is one devoid of supernatural abilities. Introducing such unnatural forces could disrupt the delicate balance of peace here. Moreover, since arriving, she had to cultivate her energy to access her powers. In this world, aside from her spatial abilities, she could only use her other powers when her life was in imminent danger.)
