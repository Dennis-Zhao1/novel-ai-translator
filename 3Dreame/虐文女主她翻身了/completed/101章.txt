She actually let her see...

Meanwhile, the dormant system had no idea about its host's hidden calculations. If it had known, it would definitely have stopped Wen Qingzhi from engaging in such reckless behavior.

As Wen Qingzhi straightened her body, Lu Qiuming didn’t immediately withdraw his hand, continuing to support her lightly. He asked with a hint of concern, “How are you feeling now?”

“I’m feeling much better,” Wen Qingzhi replied weakly.

Lu Qiuming scrutinized her face, which had been pale but now showed a hint of color returning. Seeing that she seemed to be recovering, he finally relaxed.

“That's good to hear. But why did you suddenly...?” he asked, his tone a mix of curiosity and concern.

“It’s probably because I worked too hard last night,” Wen Qingzhi replied, her eyes dodging his gaze.

Lu Qiuming immediately sensed that she wasn’t being truthful, especially with how she was avoiding his eyes. It was clear that what she had said wasn’t the whole story. However, he attributed her evasiveness to some unspoken difficulties, and instead of pressing her, he felt a surge of tenderness for her.

“Then you shouldn’t overwork yourself like that. You might wear yourself out, and I would be worried,” he said softly.

“I don’t want to make you worry, Qiuming. But my job is like this… I need to work hard to earn better opportunities to improve myself, so that I’ll be worthy of you,” Wen Qingzhi said earnestly.

Only she knew how much of that statement was sincere.

As expected, Lu Qiuming, who always had a strong sense of masculinity, puffed up with pride upon hearing her words. His brain fired up, and he blurted, “It doesn’t matter whether you’re worthy or not! Even if you’re not, as long as you’re with me, who dares to say anything? Don’t worry, I’ll take care of you in the future.”

Wen Qingzhi hesitated for a moment, saying, “But… but they’ll say I’m being kept by a sugar daddy…”

Lu Qiuming pulled her into his embrace, wrapping her up securely in his arms. He leaned down, his warm breath brushing against her ear as he whispered in a husky voice, “Hah, a sugar daddy? Have you ever seen someone like me? They’re just jealous of you. But when we’re... you can call me that if you want.”

Wen Qingzhi felt her face heat up, her eyes slightly glazed. She gently punched his arm, “You’re so annoying!”

She looked like a ripe fruit ready to be picked, and that little cat-like punch made his heart race with excitement. At the same time, it sent a wave of heat coursing through him, making him want...

His gaze shifted, and he rubbed her waist, asking suggestively, “Are we going to your place tonight or mine? Hmm?”

The implication was thick in the air. Wen Qingzhi, noticing the change in him as she leaned in closer, couldn’t help but roll her eyes internally, thinking, oh, men…

But on the surface, she feigned shyness, saying, “I’ll listen to you, Qiuming.”

“You’re so obedient,” he replied, unable to hold back any longer. He quickly scanned their surroundings and, seeing no one around, gently cradled the back of her head and leaned in to kiss her. His other hand slid along her soft waist, exploring upward...

In a rather impatient manner.

Meanwhile, someone far away had been watching, expecting to see whether Wen Qingzhi would pull any more tricks, only to be greeted by a sight that made her feel nauseous.

Internally, she scoffed: Is the male lead a frisky teddy bear? Can’t he keep it together...

The atmosphere just now was undeniably suggestive. She couldn’t help but feel that if not for the formal event they were at, the male lead would’ve pounced on her long ago.

No way, she needed to help her cute friend clean her eyes.

Yu Zhuyi: You’re not dirty; just think of them as two little mice.

Lu Qiuming: Excuse me, is this polite?

Yu Zhuyi: (ˉ▽￣～) Tch~~
