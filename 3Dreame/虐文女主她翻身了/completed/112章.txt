In the soft glow of morning light, he attempted to move his hand, hoping to free himself from the grip of Chao Yixiu. But it seemed his efforts were in vain. Forget it, forget it—he decided to let it go for now.

Instead, he found himself fixated on Chao Yixiu's sleeping face, an involuntary shiver running through him. He could hear the steady thump of his own heart, a frantic rhythm that felt as if it might leap from his chest at any moment.

As he was lost in these thoughts, he noticed Chao Yixiu beginning to stir awake. Quickly, he shut his eyes, pretending to still be asleep. Chao Yixiu blinked, his eyes heavy with sleep, and instinctively squeezed the soft flesh in his arms, a satisfied smile spreading across his face as he gazed at Zhao Min.

Without his glasses, those phoenix-like eyes shone with a deep affection. Eventually, he refrained from any further movements, opting instead to gently place a kiss on Zhao Min's forehead, a sweet gesture that sent a jolt through Zhao Min's body. He froze, unsure if he was feeling more scared or shy.

At that moment, he realized he had feelings for Chao Yixiu. And, it seemed, the feeling was mutual. Hmm… if that’s the case, should he make a move now?

With that thought in mind, he opened his eyes to find Chao Yixiu grinning at him. Zhao Min's face flushed bright red. “You… you… you…”

He stammered, unable to form a coherent sentence, caught off guard by the intensity of the moment. “Hmm… what’s wrong?” Chao Yixiu replied, his voice still carrying a hint of morning rasp that was oddly charming.

“You actually stole a kiss from me!” Zhao Min exclaimed, suddenly feeling emboldened as if he’d found a solid argument against Chao Yixiu’s “misdeed.”

Chao Yixiu noticed that Zhao Min didn’t seem to mind it too much, and understanding flashed in his eyes. “How about I kiss you back?” he teased, a playful glimmer in his gaze.

“Not a chance!” Zhao Min retorted, feigning anger. 

Then, a thought struck him, and he carefully asked, “Do you… do you like me?” Although framed as a question, his tone was more assertive than uncertain.

“Hmm, yes, I like you. What about you?” Chao Yixiu replied confidently, revealing a truth he had previously kept guarded out of fear that Zhao Min might not feel the same way. But now, with a hopeful expression, he turned the question back on Zhao Min.

Zhao Min's face remained calm, but the flush of his ears betrayed his feelings. “Hmm…”

“Hmm, what?” Chao Yixiu leaned in closer, his breath warm against Zhao Min’s neck. 

Zhao Min squirmed, feeling the heat of the moment. He wanted to dodge the question, but Chao Yixiu’s gaze was far too penetrating, making it seem like he couldn’t escape until he answered. Finally, he surrendered to the moment and confessed, “I… like you.”

“Good boy! Then let’s be together. This is your reward,” Chao Yixiu said, and without hesitation, he leaned in and captured Zhao Min's lips with his own.

The kiss was fervent, like a starving wolf finally catching its prey. Time seemed to stretch endlessly as they lost themselves in the moment.

Eventually, Chao Yixiu pulled away, leaving Zhao Min breathless and wide-eyed. He looked at Chao Yixiu in disbelief. “You… you…”

Zhao Min struggled to push away the warm figure beside him, feeling overwhelmed. To his surprise, Chao Yixiu let out a soft grunt. “Hmm… don’t move. Let me hold you for a bit,” he murmured with a husky voice.

Zhao Min froze, suddenly aware of how closely their bodies were pressed together. He felt every little reaction as if it was magnified.

——————————小剧场————————————
One day, Zhao Min woke up to find himself shrunk down to a tiny size. 

“Chirp… chirp…” Huh? What am I saying? Why does my voice sound like this? 

Startled, Zhao Min scrambled to find a nearby river. 

Looking into the water, he gasped, “I…!” 

He had turned into a small, fluffy black rabbit. 

Feeling utterly unattractive, he whimpered in despair. 

Then he realized he might not be able to turn back. 

So, he happily made friends with the surrounding animals. 

A few days later, while out searching for food, he was suddenly spotted by a hungry wolf. The wolf picked him up and carried him back to its den.

Thinking he was doomed, he was surprised to find that the wolf cared for him, even grooming him each day. 

Thus, Zhao Min willingly embraced his new life as a pampered bunny, enjoying the perks of being fed and taken care of.
