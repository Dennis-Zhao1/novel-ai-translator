**Chapter 123**

She rushed over, her heart burning with increased fury toward the person who had kidnapped her precious little one. She could vaguely guess that this incident was somehow connected to those two individuals—there was no way it could be anyone else.

Moreover, it seemed their target was herself, and the adorable one had fallen victim because of her.

Quickly, she grabbed a check and a bank card, her mind racing as she struggled to comprehend how thirty million in cash could even be transported. Even with her space abilities, it was…

As she drove, Yan Xinfei dialed the police, all while speeding down the road. What would have taken thirty minutes, she managed to cut down to a mere seventeen.

Upon arriving at the designated location, Yan Xinfei began her search.

After Hei Zi sent the video to Yan Xinfei, Zhao Hui looked at Lu Xiuming and asked, “Are you sure she would risk everything for a man?” 

“Of course, she cherishes that person deeply,” Lu Xiuming replied, though a hint of uncertainty lingered in his heart. Nevertheless, with the situation escalating, he steeled himself and spoke with conviction.

Zhao Hui nodded, choosing not to press further. Lu Xiuming let out a sigh of relief, but his eyes darkened as he glanced at Yu Zhuyi, who lay on the ground.

“Brother Hui, since Yan Xinfei is coming prepared with money, can I teach him a lesson?” Lu Xiuming suggested with a malicious grin.

Zhao Hui glanced at the crumpled figure of Yu Zhuyi and subtly shook his head; what a shame. He waved a hand dismissively, granting silent approval before leaving, leaving only Lu Xiuming and Yu Zhuyi behind.

“Who would have thought Yu Zhuyi would end up in such a pathetic state?” Lu Xiuming chuckled, relishing the moment.

Yu Zhuyi lifted an eyelid to glance at him but remained silent.

Seeing Yu Zhuyi's lack of response, Lu Xiuming continued unabated. “You probably didn’t realize you were dragged down by Yan Xinfei, did you?”

But Yu Zhuyi’s expression remained as unyielding as stone, showing no sign of reaction.

Noticing his attempt to provoke failing, Lu Xiuming decided to add fuel to the fire. “Oh, I forgot to mention, my initial target was always Yan Xinfei. What I wanted was her heart.”

He said it casually, seemingly indifferent to the implications of his words.

At his declaration, a storm surged in Yu Zhuyi’s heart, and his expression finally shifted. He had thought that once he secured the money, he would be free. But it turned out that Lu Xiuming wanted…

A fierce glint flashed in Yu Zhuyi’s eyes, like a lone, powerless wolf.

Sensing his satisfaction, Lu Xiuming pulled out a small knife, its blade gleaming coldly. He slowly tapped the knife against Yu Zhuyi’s delicate face. “You used this face to charm Yan Xinfei, didn’t you? She used to like me; all of this is your fault. Your existence has cost me everything. Otherwise, I would have already secured shares in the Yan Corporation.”

“Why do you think she would like you? Do you think she would prefer a fickle person like you, or someone cowardly, or someone who merely eyes her wealth?” Yu Zhuyi retorted sarcastically.

At these words, Lu Xiuming fell deeper into his obsession. “No, she likes me. You don’t know what she was like before…”

His words tumbled out chaotically.

While he rambled on, Yu Zhuyi discreetly began to untie his bonds. Three minutes passed, and he was almost free.

“But it doesn’t matter. Even if she doesn’t like me, as long as I can transfer her heart to Qing Zhi, it’s fine. If I can’t have her, you won’t get her either,” Lu Xiuming said with a sinister tone.

Just as he prepared to slash at Yu Zhuyi’s face, the door was suddenly kicked open with a loud bang.

The knife in Lu Xiuming’s hand vanished in the chaos.

Seeing Yu Zhuyi sprawled helplessly on the ground and Lu Xiuming poised to strike, Yan Xinfei felt a surge of fear and anger. Channeling her wind abilities, she knocked the knife from his grip.

With a swift kick, she sent him flying several meters away.

Two minutes later, Yan Xinfei cradled Yu Zhuyi as they made their escape, leaving Lu Xiuming lying on the ground, uncertain of his fate.
