**Chapter 38: Is She Really Asking for It?**

As Yan Xinfei stepped out from inside, her confidence radiated as she confronted Yan Xinfei, "You found lunch and didn’t even call us?"

Yan Xinfei couldn't help but laugh in disbelief. Xu Xiaoxiao, eyes wide with indignation, shot back, "Why should I call you? Didn’t you go out to find it yourself? Besides, you didn’t even team up with us!"

Even Song Lin, who stood nearby, felt a bit awkward.

"We all came here to film the same variety show, shouldn’t we look out for each other?" she insisted.

"Isn't it you who didn’t want to be with us? Now that we’ve found food, you come over here to question us? Talk about having a big face! Do your parents know about this? From what I see, it’s just that you lack the ability to find someone to provide lunch for you. I didn’t expect your skills to be so low that your IQ has dropped too—tsk tsk, I feel sorry for your fans," she said, shaking her head with an exaggerated expression of pity.

Wen Qingzhi clenched her hands tightly, trembling slightly as her chest rose and fell with agitation.

She pointed at the elderly woman who had just emerged and said imperiously, "You, cook for us."

Yan Xinfei's expression changed gradually, her brows furrowing together as sharp, piercing glares shot from her eyes, directed right at Wen Qingzhi.

Wen Qingzhi felt that searing gaze like a tangible knife, sending a chill down her spine. She shivered but reassured herself that Yan Xinfei wouldn’t dare to act out on camera.

Before anyone could react, Yan Xinfei stepped forward and pushed Wen Qingzhi’s hand that was pointing at the old lady away. 

"Is this what you call upbringing, Miss Wen? You entered someone else's yard without permission and dare to order the owner to cook for you, acting as if it’s your right to eat for free? Your upbringing is quite impressive," she said sarcastically.

Xu Xiaoxiao added fuel to the fire, "She probably crawled out from some mountain cave!"

Wen Qingzhi took a few steps back, her silver teeth clenching audibly as an uncontrollable rage flickered in her eyes, fixated on Yan Xinfei and Xu Xiaoxiao.

Song Lin couldn’t bear it any longer and stepped in front of her, his face darkening as he said, "We’re all artists here for the same show; there’s no need to make this so tense. Besides, Qingzhi hasn’t done anything wrong—she just asked you to provide one meal, and the host hasn’t said anything yet."

Just as he finished speaking, the old lady's slightly angry voice rang out, "You all can leave. I won’t cook for someone so rude."

Wen Qingzhi panicked, pleading with tears in her eyes, "Grandma, I can pay you, just please provide us a meal."

The old lady's eyes flashed with disdain, her anger growing as she shouted, "Who cares about your filthy money? You reek of copper!"

For a moment, Wen Qingzhi’s usually gentle and delicate face twisted in anguish.

Unable to bear the humiliation any longer, tears brimming in her eyes, she ran out. 

Song Lin chased after her.

Yan Xinfei turned to the old lady and apologized, who waved her hand dismissively, indicating it was no problem.

After a moment of contemplation, Yan Xinfei asked the old lady, "Grandma, it seems there are two silly boys still waiting out front with me for this variety show. Can they…?"

The old lady readily agreed, "Sure, I just have a natural dislike for rude people. I believe those who can make you speak up must have trustworthy qualities."

Meanwhile, Zhou Cong and Gu Zihan were still waiting at the entrance.

Seeing them come out, they looked back inside in confusion, only to notice Xu Xiaoxiao bouncing out behind them.

Xu Xiaoxiao cheerfully approached them. 

Zhou Cong, curious, asked, "What happened?"

"Oh, it’s nothing much. Wen Qingzhi ordered the grandma to cook for her, and when she refused, she threw a fit and cried. Anyway, the grandma asked me to invite you inside; she can provide the ingredients, but Yan Xinfei said you guys have to cook yourselves, so don’t bother the old lady."

Zhou Cong’s eyes lit up with excitement, "Really? Why would the grandma let us in but not Wen Qingzhi?"

Gu Zihan looked equally intrigued.

"Well, what else could it be? Because you’re polite and didn’t barge into someone else's yard like certain people did."

Their responses were unexpected, but upon reflection, they found it made perfect sense.

Relief washed over them as they silently thanked their stars for not following Wen Qingzhi inside just moments before.
