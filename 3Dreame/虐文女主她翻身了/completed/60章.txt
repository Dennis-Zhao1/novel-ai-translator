**Chapter 60: Dining in the Company Cafeteria**

"Is it good?" Yu Zhuoyi looked eagerly at her sister.

"It's okay," Yan Xinfan replied, giving a fair assessment under the adorable gaze of her younger sibling.

"Sis, you’re the best! I’ll cook for you again next time!" Yu Zhuoyi said shyly.

"No need," Yan Xinfan directly refused.

"Why not? Do you think my cooking isn't good?" Yu Zhuoyi stared at her with wide eyes.

"No, no, how could that be?" Yan Xinfan hurriedly denied it three times.

"Then why won't you let me cook for you again?"

"I'm just thinking of you. I want to spare you from getting hurt again while cooking next time, so it's better if I do it," she explained.

Just then, a soft growl echoed from Yu Zhuoyi's stomach.

Yan Xinfan looked at her younger sibling, whose face was slightly flushed, in surprise. "Haven't you eaten yet?"

Yu Zhuoyi whispered, "No... I went shopping for groceries right after class to make you dinner."

He said the last part with a sense of pride.

"Then let’s go get you something to eat now," Yan Xinfan replied.

"Sis, can we go to your company’s cafeteria? I want to see it," Yu Zhuoyi asked, his eyes sparkling with curiosity.

Yan Xinfan checked the time on her phone and realized the cafeteria was still open for meals, so she nodded in agreement.

Hand in hand, they made their way down the stairs toward the company cafeteria.

As they walked through the company, employees greeted the president, surprised to see her with a young boy.

Yu Zhuoyi felt a bit shy under their gazes.

The cafeteria was luxurious, with round tables and sofa-like chairs that rivaled a five-star hotel restaurant.

The employees were astonished to see their president dining there, but when they noticed the young boy beside her, they quickly understood—she was just enjoying a meal with her little boyfriend.

Yu Zhuoyi sensed many eyes on him and felt nervous and uneasy, wanting to pull his hand away from his sister’s grasp.

Yan Xinfan held his hand tightly, not allowing him to pull away.

She shot a cold glance at the surrounding employees, causing them to quickly avert their eyes, no longer daring to stare at Yu Zhuoyi.

Once he felt the attention shift, Yu Zhuoyi sighed in relief.

Yan Xinfan led her little sibling to a table on the second floor of the cafeteria and went to order food for him.

She ordered his favorite sweet and sour ribs and sweet and sour fish.

Sitting across from him, she watched as he ate.

By the time Yu Zhuoyi finished, it was already past one o’clock. Yan Xinfan took him back to her office.

Yu Zhuoyi settled onto the sofa without interrupting Yan Xinfan, knowing she had many documents to handle.

As he waited, he eventually drifted off to sleep.

Yan Xinfan focused on her paperwork, and when she remembered her little sibling, half an hour had already passed. She looked up and saw him sleeping soundly.

Yan Xinfan rose and walked over to him, gently kissing his forehead, then brushing her lips softly against his closed eyelids, his petite nose, and finally, his rosy lips.

In his dreams, Yu Zhuoyi felt as if a little dog was licking his face.

He instinctively reached out to push Yan Xinfan away.

She let out a light laugh, then leaned in for another kiss.

The temperature in the office gradually rose.

Finally, noticing that Yu Zhuoyi seemed to be waking up, she stopped her affectionate actions.

Feeling the annoying motion cease, he fell deeper into sleep.

Fearing he might catch a chill from sleeping there, Yan Xinfan carefully carried him to the resting room adjacent to her office.

She laid him on the bed, took off his shoes, covered him with a blanket, and couldn’t help but bend down for another gentle kiss on his still-dreaming face.

Then she returned to her work.

Sitting at her desk, Yan Xinfan diligently processed documents, and by the time she nearly finished everything, four hours had passed.

She looked out the window at the darkening sky, hesitating on whether to wake up her little sibling now.

Just then, the door to the resting room opened, and a sleepy Yu Zhuoyi rubbed his eyes as he walked out.

"Sis, what time is it?" he asked, his voice soft and sleepy.

"Almost seven," Yan Xinfan replied with a smile.

"Ah, why didn’t you wake me up? I slept for so long," Yu Zhuoyi said, slightly pouting in a feigned complaint.

Yan Xinfan beckoned him over, and he obediently walked to her.

When he reached her, she pulled him down onto her lap.

From a distance, it looked as if she was holding him tightly.

She then playfully ruffled his slightly curly hair.

Yu Zhuoyi tried to escape her grasp, but his strength was no match for Yan Xinfan’s. He couldn’t help but doubt if he was truly that weak.

In reality, Yu Zhuoyi was quite strong—strong enough to compete with other adult men, even perhaps stronger.

But Yan Xinfan was no ordinary woman.

"Alright, it’s my fault. Next time, I promise I’ll wake you up, okay?" Yan Xinfan said patiently.

Yu Zhuoyi pouted again, "Fine, but you have to remember to wake me up next time."

Yan Xinfan pinched his chin, forcing him to look up at her.

Then she kissed him firmly on the lips.

Yu Zhuoyi instinctively wrapped his arms around her neck, unable to resist responding to Yan Xinfan.

In a daze, he thought he heard her giggle softly.

Twenty minutes later, Yan Xinfan released the dreamy-eyed boy.

She raised her hand to cover his eyes, whispering in his ear, "Let’s go get dinner now."

Her warm breath tingled against Yu Zhuoyi’s sensitive earlobe, making him shiver slightly.
