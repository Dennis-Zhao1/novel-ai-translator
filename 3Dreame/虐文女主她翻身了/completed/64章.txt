**Chapter 64: They Look Down on the Previous President's Crush**

Not long after Yan Xinfei left, Assistant Liu arrived at Yu Zhuyi's apartment building, carrying the snacks she had picked up. 

She quickly sent a text to the president.  
**[Assistant Liu]: President, should I just bring the snacks up or...**  
**[President]: Just knock on the door.**

As Yu Zhuyi settled onto the couch, ready to check her phone and see if her sister had returned home, she heard a knock at the door. Feeling a bit puzzled, she got up and walked over to check the door camera. 

To her surprise, it was her sister's assistant. She remembered her sister mentioning that the snacks were on their way. 

With that thought in mind, Yu Zhuyi opened the door. 

Assistant Liu stood there, a bit nervous; after all, this was the president's boyfriend. She instinctively put on a professional smile. 

Yu Zhuyi politely asked, "Is there something you need?" 

Liu Lin steadied herself, smiling a bit too eagerly, "Oh, President's wife, I was sent to deliver these snacks to you." 

As she spoke, she extended her hand with the snacks towards Yu Zhuyi. 

Yu Zhuyi carefully avoided contact with her hand, gently taking the snacks from her grasp. Liu Assistant felt his cautiousness and was momentarily taken aback, then she realized her mistake. 

Ugh, it was her fault for being so eager to please the future president's wife that she forgot to maintain some distance. 

So, she instinctively took a step back from the president's wife. 

Yu Zhuyi nodded politely, saying, "Thank you for your trouble." 

Liu Lin was flustered and quickly waved her hands, indicating it was no trouble at all. 

After collecting the snacks, Yu Zhuyi turned and closed the door. 

Liu Lin observed how polite the president's wife was and noted her ability to keep a respectful distance from other men. She felt a sense of satisfaction; this was the kind of person worthy of their president. 

Although she wasn't entirely sure about Yu Zhuyi's background, it didn't matter. With the president around, he wouldn't agree to a family-arranged marriage with someone he didn't love. 

Besides, even if the president's wife wasn't from a prestigious family, that was fine. As subordinates, they would support the president's decision. 

And while the apartment might not be luxurious, it was still indicative of someone from a wealthy family. 

Honestly, as long as the president's wife genuinely cared for him, they would wholeheartedly bless their union. 

After all, they were still seething about how their president had chased after Lu Xiuming. 

Even though Lu Xiuming had outwardly rejected their president, he had shamelessly accepted all the kindness the president showed him. It was utterly infuriating. 

When they found out, they were incredibly upset, but what could they do? Their president was smitten. 

The more she thought about it, the more she felt that the current president's wife and their president were a perfect match. 

Lost in her thoughts, she drove away from the apartment. 

Ah, where was she going? Oh, she was just heading home to sleep since it was getting late. 

After Yu Zhuyi closed the door, she placed the snacks in the fridge and picked up her phone, unlocking it to open WeChat. She sent a message to her sister.  
**[Little Cutie]: Did you get home?**  
**[Little Cutie]: I received the snacks you sent!**  
**[Little Cutie]: Thanks, sis!ヾ(≧O≦)〃** 

After waiting for quite a while without a reply, she eventually sighed and set her phone down, grabbing her clothes to head to the bathroom for a shower. 

By the time Yan Xinfei got home, twenty minutes had passed, and she noticed multiple messages from her little cutie.  
**[Sister, mine]: Just got back, no need to thank me.**  
After a moment of thought, she sent another message.  
**[Sister, mine]: If you aren't hungry later, don't eat too many snacks. Too much can upset your stomach.** 

Yu Zhuyi finished her shower just in time to see her sister's message pop up on her phone. 

She didn't even bother to dry her hair, quickly grabbing a towel to dab at her wet locks before replying.  
**[Little Cutie]: Got it, sis! I won't overdo it, don't worry! ☺**
