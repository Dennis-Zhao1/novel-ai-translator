**Sweet Yet Painful Torment**

On the other side, Yan Xinfey had just finished replying to a message from her little cutie before settling down to meditate as usual. After about an hour of practice, she decided it was time for a shower and then off to bed.

——————————————

The next morning, Yu Zhuyi had set an alarm for 6:20 AM the night before. So today, he woke up right on time, eager to prepare breakfast for his sister. Since he had no classes that day, and with it being his senior year, he knew that most of his time would be spent on internships, with very few actual lessons—except for some special cases.

You might wonder why he didn’t just cook breakfast himself? Yu Zhuyi would chuckle at that thought. If he were to make breakfast, it would already be nearly 8 AM by the time he finished, and his sister would have left for her day. Who would he be delivering breakfast to then?

He was quite aware of his own limitations.

So, after getting ready, Yu Zhuyi headed out, driving to a popular breakfast spot. The steamed buns and soy milk there were famous, and he was sure his sister would love them.

However, the line was long, and all he could do was wait. It took nearly half an hour before he finally got his order.

The shop owner was a kind-hearted woman, and when she saw the handsome young man in front of her buying two servings of breakfast, she smiled and said, “Young man, are you buying this for your girlfriend? You must be very much in love!”

Yu Zhuyi was taken aback by her comment. 

“Really? How did you know?” he asked, bewildered.

The woman chuckled, “I’ve been running this place for over ten years. The people who come here for breakfast are mostly couples or busy folks heading to work. But since it’s usually crowded, office workers rarely have time to wait in line. So, it’s mostly couples buying breakfast together.”

Realizing this, Yu Zhuyi nodded in understanding. “I see!”

“Alright, here’s your breakfast. Take care!” the woman said, handing him the two bags.

After paying and thanking her, he hurried out. Checking his phone, he noticed it was just a few minutes shy of 7 AM. He knew his sister usually woke up at exactly 7:00, then went to brush her teeth and wash her face. It would take him about five or six minutes to get to her place from where he was.

Timing should be perfect.

Six minutes later, it was exactly 7:01.

Instead of knocking immediately, Yu Zhuyi stood at the door, waiting a couple of minutes. He knew his sister was already up and was likely brushing her teeth.

After ten minutes, he finally knocked on the door.

As expected, his sister came down just in time. He was quite the clever little guy.

Yan Xinfey had just finished brushing her teeth when she heard someone knock. Curious, she wondered who would come to see her so early. 

When she opened the door, she was surprised to see her little cutie standing there. Normally, she thought he wouldn’t wake up until after 7:00 AM. If she remembered correctly, it was barely past 7 AM now. 

Considering the travel time from his home to hers, it should take at least ten more minutes. Did he wake up as early as 6 AM?

She stepped aside to let him in, but Yu Zhuyi hesitated, his gaze fixed on Yan Xinfey.

Still carrying the remnants of sleep, she radiated a lazy aura, her usually cold demeanor now softened. Her eyes sparkled, and her cheeks were slightly flushed, enhancing her allure.

Dressed in a spaghetti strap nightgown, she stood just at his chest height. Yu Zhuyi dared not look directly; a slight tilt of his head revealed the soft curves of her collarbone.

Swallowing hard, he managed to say, “Sister, I bought breakfast for you.” 

In a flurry, he handed her the bags and then bent down to change his shoes.

But in that moment, he accidentally caught a glimpse of her delicate collarbone.

His ears turned crimson, and he quickly averted his gaze, yet his mind betrayed him, yearning to sneak another look. For several moments, he scolded himself internally, but his heart raced with confusion and excitement.

Yan Xinfey accepted the breakfast from Yu Zhuyi, noticing his ears were as red as blood. Curiosity piqued, she reached out to touch them.

Caught off guard, Yu Zhuyi nearly lost his balance as her gentle fingers grazed his earlobe.

Yan Xinfey, focused on his blush, didn’t notice anything unusual about him. She found his blushing ears amusing and, playfully, returned the breakfast to his hands before using both of hers to pinch his ears.

Given their height difference, Yu Zhuyi had to lean down slightly.

This proximity forced his gaze to linger on her chest.

It looked soft and inviting, and he couldn’t help but think about it. An overwhelming heat surged within him, as if all his blood was rushing downward.

No more! He couldn’t afford to look any longer. He forced himself to shift his eyes elsewhere.

Meanwhile, Yan Xinfey remained blissfully unaware of his inner turmoil.

A few minutes later, Yu Zhuyi could no longer withstand this sweet yet torturous scenario. He wanted to escape her grasp but forgot that her strength was not that of an ordinary girl.

What followed was an awkward scene: as he tried to pull away, she yanked him back with surprising force, causing him to bury his face right into her chest.

His first reaction was to rub against her. 

Inwardly, he couldn’t help but marvel, as it felt just as he had imagined.

Yan Xinfey finally realized what had happened and firmly lifted his head. 

She caught sight of his darting eyes and the deep blush spreading across his face, even reaching his neck.

Yu Zhuyi, realizing the situation, spoke in a pitiful tone, “Sister, don’t blame me; I’m just so weak…”

Yan Xinfey raised an eyebrow with a smile. “Not blame you? So, does that mean you’re blaming me? What do you mean you’re weak? Do you think I’m stronger than you?”

Seeing her smile made Yu Zhuyi feel even hotter. 

Although he wanted to nod in agreement, his instinct for self-preservation kicked in. 

“I don’t blame you at all! How could I blame you? It’s all my fault. Come on, let’s eat breakfast!” he quickly changed the subject.

Yan Xinfey noticed his attempt to divert the conversation but didn’t press further. Continuing down this path would only lead to more embarrassment. 

Relieved that she dropped the matter, Yu Zhuyi slowly began to calm the heat rising within him.

Thus, the atmosphere during breakfast was surprisingly quiet. They didn’t discuss anything else and simply enjoyed their meal in peace.
