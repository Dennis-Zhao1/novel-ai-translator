The old man couldn't stand it any longer.

Yan Xinfei noticed this and slipped on a pair of disposable gloves, typically used for peeling small crayfish. She was elegantly peeling the shell off a crayfish for her little darling when, out of nowhere, Mo Ziqiao threw a sarcastic remark at her husband, Yu Boming, who was sitting next to her. "Honey, how could anyone not serve food to someone they like?"

At first, Yu Boming was puzzled by her words, feeling a bit lost. It took him a moment to realize who she was referring to. He didn't stop her, though; instead, he replied casually, "Maybe it’s because they don’t like others."

When Mo Ziqiao heard her husband echo her sentiment, she felt supported and ramped up her teasing. "Xinfei, do you actually not like our Yu Zhuyi?" she questioned loudly, directly confronting Yan Xinfei at the table, completely disregarding the old man's increasingly displeased expression.

Yan Xinfei raised an eyebrow, a cold glint flickering in her eyes. Instead of answering directly, she placed the crayfish she was peeling in front of her little darling and slowly turned to face Mo Ziqiao. "What? Auntie, are you trying to say something? Or do you want to express that my relationship with your little darling is just a game? Or are you suggesting it's all just an act?"

For a moment, Mo Ziqiao didn’t grasp who Yan Xinfei was referring to when she mentioned "little darling." It took her a second to realize, and a wave of discomfort washed over her. How could such a tall and strong man be called "little darling" by a woman? Glancing at her nephew, who was indeed quite tall and robust, made her feel even more uneasy.

As she thought about it, her gaze turned to Yu Zhuyi with a hint of disdain before she caught the way Yan Xinfei had addressed her. Suddenly, her anger ignited, and she pointed at Yan Xinfei, demanding, "Auntie? You actually called me Auntie?"

A cold smile crept onto Yan Xinfei's lips as she noticed the disgust in Mo Ziqiao's eyes directed at her little darling. For a moment, she considered leaving with him right then and there, but she remembered how close he was to his grandfather, so she refrained from such a hasty exit.

"Shouldn't I call you Auntie? After all, you are of that age, and you certainly fit the bill. Oh, I get it, perhaps I shouldn’t call you Auntie. Should I call you Old Auntie instead?"

Little Darling tugged at his sister's skirt in concern, fearing she might feel slighted. However, Yan Xinfei interpreted this gesture as a plea for her not to argue with Mo Ziqiao.

Taking a deep breath to calm her simmering anger, Yan Xinfei chose to ignore Mo Ziqiao’s darkening expression and continued peeling crayfish for her little darling.

Meanwhile, Mo Ziqiao's complexion shifted from pale to green, her eyes wide with fury, making her otherwise charming face look terrifying. She was about to unleash a torrent of insults at Yan Xinfei when Yu Zhuyi interrupted her, his voice low and firm. 

"Dad’s sister, isn’t there something you’re getting wrong? You’re old enough to be called Auntie, so what’s the problem? Should I be calling you ‘Old Lady’ instead? If that’s the case, I’ll have my sister call you ‘Old Lady’ from now on!"

Yu Zhuyi’s words were merciless, striking right at the heart of Mo Ziqiao’s insecurities. Yan Xinfei was taken aback by how fiercely he defended her; it was unexpected from someone who seemed so soft and gentle.

Mo Ziqiao’s eyes flashed with hatred, her brows knitted tightly, even the veins on her arms were visible with tension. "You…"

At that moment, the old man slammed his chopsticks down on the table with a loud "bang," effectively silencing everyone. "Enough! What are you all arguing about? Can’t you keep your mouths shut while eating? If you don’t want to eat, just leave!"

Though his words were directed at everyone at the table, it was clear to all present that they were primarily aimed at Mo Ziqiao. Her face turned crimson as she glanced at her husband, but to her surprise, Yu Boming didn’t defend her. Instead, he gestured for her to eat quietly and not to say anything further.

Mo Ziqiao pouted, feeling resentful that the old man favored Yu Zhuyi and his crowd. She shot a glance at her husband, feeling like she had lost face in front of the younger generation. Wanting to leave immediately, she hesitated, knowing the old man was right there, so she suppressed her anger and quietly continued eating.

Although the old man didn’t speak up again, he discreetly observed Yan Xinfei and his grandson’s every move. When he saw Yan Xinfei peel the crayfish and hand it over to Yu Zhuyi, he felt a wave of relief. After all, not many in their social circle would stoop to peeling crayfish for someone else at the dinner table, especially not in front of a crowd.

Yu Zhuyi, noticing his aunt getting scolded by his grandfather, felt a surge of satisfaction—serves her right for picking on his sister. He turned his attention back to his meal, stuffing his cheeks full, resembling a greedy little squirrel, utterly adorable.

About half an hour passed, and Yu Zhuyi continued to enjoy Yan Xinfei's dedicated service. The old man watched this unfold, feeling somewhat uneasy. Although he felt a twinge of jealousy at his grandson being taken away, it was clear that Yan Xinfei was indulging Yu Zhuyi, much to the old man’s surprise.

He noted how Yan Xinfei was entirely focused on peeling crayfish for Yu Zhuyi, not having eaten anything herself. He had been watching closely and could tell she had barely touched her food. Given Yu Zhuyi’s nature, even if someone did take him away, he would happily follow along.

Worry crept into the old man’s mind. Would Yan Xinfei grow upset after peeling for so long? But to his astonishment, she didn’t seem irritated at all; in fact, she appeared genuinely happy while serving Yu Zhuyi.

In that moment, the old man felt as though he had eaten his fill, stuffed with the sweetness of young love, the scent of affection hanging thick in the air. He couldn’t help but cough a few times, directing a glare at Yu Zhuyi. 

However, Yu Zhuyi was too engrossed in his meal to notice his grandfather’s attempts to communicate through his gaze. The old man’s expression was clear: "You little rascal, don’t make Yan Xinfei keep peeling crayfish for you any longer!"

But alas, this was merely the old man’s one-man show, while Yu Zhuyi savored every moment of his meal with unabashed delight!
