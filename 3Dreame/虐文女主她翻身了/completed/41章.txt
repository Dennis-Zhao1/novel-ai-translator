## Chapter 41: Can Yvonne Make Ceramics?

As the afternoon unfolded, the group expanded to six members. 

Yvonne, having learned a lesson earlier, was unusually quiet, choosing to stay to the side and observe the others. In contrast, Lucy chattered away like a lively little bird, her energy infectious. Yvonne didn't mind her incessant talking; although she didn't answer every question, her attentive expressions made it clear she was listening intently, occasionally responding with a thoughtful comment. The overall atmosphere was quite harmonious.

Half an hour later, they arrived at a place called the Imperial Kiln Workshop.

"Are we really here? What do they do here?" David and Leo asked, their curiosity piqued.

Lucy, puffing her cheeks in annoyance, lightly tapped David on the head. "Come on, you silly! It’s obviously a place for making ceramics!"

It wasn't that they were ignorant; it was just that the name was unfamiliar to them. Lucy felt a sense of pride upon learning they were at a ceramics studio, as she had once had the privilege of learning how to make ceramics herself. With her head held high, like a victorious rooster, she dashed into the workshop, eager to explore.

Yvonne paid no mind to the still-sulking Yvonne, understanding that some people were destined to occupy higher positions while others constantly proved their worth through actions. They strolled leisurely behind Lucy as she led the way.

As Yvonne walked through the workshop, her keen eyes scanned the various ceramic styles on display. When they reached the owner, she didn’t rush to inquire about anything.

In a slightly impatient tone, Lucy asked the owner, "Are you hiring ceramic makers?"

The owner raised an eyebrow, taking in Lucy’s eager demeanor. "Well, that depends on what skills you have in ceramic making."

Lucy’s proud smile faltered momentarily. However, she mustered her courage and replied, "I’ve learned how to make ceramics before."

The owner nodded, saying, "Then let’s see you make one right here for me."

His words were clearly directed at everyone present, which made Lucy feel a little annoyed. After all, she was the one who had approached him first, yet he expected all of them to participate.

With a distressed expression, Lucy tugged at Yvonne's sleeve. "Help me! I don’t know how to do this!"

The reason Lucy turned to Yvonne for help was simple: in her eyes, Yvonne was capable of everything.

"Okay, I’ll teach you," Yvonne replied calmly.

Standing behind them, Leo and David quickly chimed in, pleading for Yvonne to teach them as well.

"Alright, I’ll demonstrate first, and you can all watch me," Yvonne confirmed.

The owner guided them to the tools for making ceramics, allowing them to unleash their creativity. 

Yvonne began kneading the clay, and soon others were attempting to follow her lead. Although kneading seemed easy, it was an essential technique in ceramic art and the first step in shaping the clay. The purpose of kneading was to eliminate air bubbles from the clay, making it denser. Skipping this step could lead to cracks and deformities during drying and firing.

Next came the second step: forming the clay body. Yvonne’s craftsmanship was exquisite, while the others’ attempts appeared awkward and crooked. She carefully placed her finished rough piece aside, letting it air dry naturally.

Meanwhile, the ceramic piece in David’s hands cracked, prompting him to step back and watch from the sidelines.

Once the rough pieces were ready, they moved on to the third step: imprinting the clay. After allowing her handmade piece to dry slightly, Yvonne placed it on a clay mold and pressed it down to ensure it was evenly shaped.

Her movements were smooth and fluid, reminiscent of a seasoned ceramic master with decades of experience. The owner, watching from a distance, nodded in approval at Yvonne’s skill while shaking his head at the less-than-pleasing attempts of the others.

As Yvonne’s impressive piece took shape, Lucy felt increasingly frustrated, her own efforts slipping out of her control. Suddenly, her clay body cracked apart, and she could only retreat in embarrassment.

Yvonne, however, seamlessly transitioned to the fourth step: refining the piece.

...

With a steady pace, Yvonne moved through each step, multitasking as she guided Lucy and the others along the way. At last, Yvonne successfully produced a beautiful piece of white porcelain, a rare gem in the world of ceramics.

The owner couldn’t help but reach out to touch the exquisite porcelain, but he halted just before his fingers made contact, clearly impressed. 

The iron content in the glaze was less than 0.63%, resulting in a stunningly white finish. The lower the iron content, the purer the glaze would appear.

It was evident that the white porcelain she had created was of exceptional quality.
