She was so angry that her liver felt like it was hurting. 

Suddenly, an idea seemed to strike her…

A professional fake smile crept onto her lips. She linked her arm with Leo Sterling's and approached Serena Zhou, eager to establish a connection.

With an overly sweet smile, she said, “Serena, I didn’t realize you were the heiress of the Xu family! How have you been lately?”

Serena pouted, clearly unimpressed. “Who are you? Why should I talk to you?”

Wen Qingzhi's smile faltered, caught off guard by the unexpected cold shoulder. She suddenly found herself at a loss for words. 

Leo, equally perplexed, glanced at Wen Qingzhi, silently questioning what was going on. 

Wen Qingzhi pretended not to notice, offering an innocent smile. With tears welling in her eyes, she looked at Serena. “Serena, weren't we artists together during that variety show? I thought we were friends now…”

She sighed dramatically, “But I guess, people like me… only Heartfelt Sister would want to be friends with you…”

Her expression was one of muted sorrow, almost tragic.

Leo, who had initially felt a tinge of irritation towards Wen Qingzhi, now found himself feeling a pang of sympathy for her. In an instant, all his earlier annoyance faded away, replaced by a growing dislike for Serena.

Deep down, he had always perceived those from the upper echelons of society as looking down on people like him. Even though he had carved out a place for himself among the elite, he still felt like an outsider. 

So, hearing that Serena disdained someone like Wen Qingzhi struck a nerve, making him even angrier, as if she were belittling him directly.

Yen Xinfeng watched the situation unfold with a bemused expression, thinking, wow, just moments ago… and now, she still hasn't learned her lesson. She couldn’t help but wonder how this seemingly sweet girl would handle the situation. But judging by her instincts, it seemed like Wen Qingzhi might not come out on top.

Sure enough, Serena shot back with a disdainful look. “What are you calling me? Oh, so when you said you were on the variety show with me, it turns out you didn’t even want to acknowledge me?”

After a brief pause, she feigned realization, “Oh, I see! Now that you know my identity, you want to get close to me?”

Wen Qingzhi felt the sting of those words like a slap to the face. She was both flustered and angry, nearly losing control of her expression.

But she hurriedly tried to explain, “You… are you insulting me? I… I didn’t mean it like that! I really…”

However, no amount of explanation would suffice. Xu Zhengwei saw through her facade instantly.

He felt disgusted by her behavior, recalling how his daughter had been used by people like her since childhood, left with no real friends. 

Xu Zhengwei had no patience for her theatrics. Maintaining a facade of politeness, he turned to Yen Xinfeng and Leo. “Excuse me, I need to step away for a moment.”

Yen nodded, not minding the interruption. Leo was a bit confused, wondering why Xu was leaving so suddenly. But given the man's status, he didn’t dare question it and could only manage a tight smile. “No problem, Mr. Xu. Please go ahead.”

As Xu Zhengwei led Serena away, Leo shot a frustrated glance at Wen Qingzhi, but when he saw her pitiful expression, he swallowed his anger. 

He then shifted his gaze to the calm and collected Yen, redirecting his frustration elsewhere.

Serena: “What are you calling me?”

Wen Qingzhi: “Calling? Why does that sound like you’re talking about an animal?”

Serena: “…”

Wen Qingzhi: “Are you insulting me?”

Serena looked innocent. “No, I’m not.”

Wen Qingzhi: ( ´◔‸◔`)
