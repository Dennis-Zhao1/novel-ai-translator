Chapter 40: She Actually Agreed?

After finishing their meal, the girls bid farewell to the old lady. Although they had only spent a few hours together, there was a lingering sense of reluctance to leave. 

The old lady kindly reminded them, “Whenever you have time, feel free to come and visit me. I’m all alone here, and I would love to chat with you.”

“Of course, Grandma! I’ll visit you whenever I can, as long as you don’t mind," said Lucy, flashing a cheeky grin.

Once they departed from the old lady's villa, they returned to the accommodations arranged by the variety show crew. Shortly after, Serena and Leo rejoined them.

Serena put on a façade of nonchalance, greeting them as if nothing had happened. 

Lucy couldn’t help but think to herself that some people had an incredible capacity to endure; their thick skin was truly impressive.

No one paid much attention to Serena, and the smile on her face was almost slipping away.

Just then, the director popped up out of nowhere, grinning as he announced, “Congratulations on having a pleasant morning! This afternoon, you’ll be helping out the townsfolk with some tasks in exchange for rewards. And by the way, you’ll use your earnings to buy ingredients for dinner.”

“Director, you’re such a scammer!” “Do you really think we’re the type to work?” “We’ve already exhausted ourselves this morning—can’t we have a break?”

They pouted, trying to elicit some sympathy from the director.

Ignoring their lamentations, he responded with a mischievous grin, “That’s entirely up to you! You can earn your rewards however you want.”

And with that, he vanished again.

Lucy immediately ran over to Serena and asked, “Can I team up with you this afternoon?”

Max and David joined in, curious as well.

“Sure!” 

Hearing Serena’s affirmation, Lucy grabbed her hand and leaned her head on her shoulder, playfully declaring, “Sister Serena, you’re the best!”

Meanwhile, at school, Julia watched with envy as Lucy held hands with Serena, a cold chill radiating from her.

“Hey, why does it feel a bit chilly today?” Zhaomin said, rubbing his hands together.

“Just wear another layer,” said Chao with a hint of affection in his eyes.

[You’re squishing my leg hair]: I heard the collective moans of the crowd.

[The Little Match Girl]: If it weren’t for the timing, I think they would all want to pretend to cry.

[Type your text here]: The director wore a cold expression: I can’t see, I can’t see, I can’t see. Keep pretending; do you think I don’t know what you’re thinking?

[National Protected Animal]: Ahhh, Sister Serena is so assertive!

[When I Sleep, I’m Not Tired]: Sister Serena looked at Lucy with so much affection.

[Blue Sky Mental Hospital]: I’m so jealous!!!!!

[Cute Cute Cute Girl]: I can’t wait to see how they’ll earn their rewards this afternoon.

[Trying to Be Cool While Not Covering My Belly]: Same here.

[Little Two, bring me a plate of goosebumps]: Sister Serena is radiating dominance, while Lucy is the little darling.

[Ugly and Broke with No Charm]: Only Sister Serena remains calm.

[Shine Too Brightly and I’ll Pull Your Plug]: Ugh, I’m full. I just had a serving of dog food.

After weighing the pros and cons, Serena instructed Leo to find Lucy and let her know they also wanted to join their team in the afternoon.

Lucy wasn’t too thrilled and glanced at Serena.

The others also looked at Serena, clearly understanding she was the backbone of the team.

With a slight nod, Serena indicated her agreement.

Seeing that Serena had already consented, Lucy didn’t say anything further; she knew Serena had her own plans.

They were a bit surprised, considering what had happened that morning. Normally, one wouldn’t agree to team up with someone like Serena.

At the same time, they were reflecting on whether they were being too narrow-minded as men. 

In truth, they were overthinking it; Serena wasn’t a saint.

She hadn’t considered all that deeply; she simply thought that keeping Serena close would make it easier to uncover that faint, unknown force she sensed.
