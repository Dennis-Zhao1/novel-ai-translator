**Chapter 20: Work**

In this world, Wen Qingzhi discovered that becoming an artist allowed her to quickly earn trust points, which in turn enhanced her acting skills. In other words, the improvement in her acting skills meant that whatever she said, others would believe without question.

When she first reincarnated into this world, she hadn’t yet met Lu Qiuming. It was only through the hints provided by the acting system that she learned what type of girl Lu Qiuming preferred. With careful planning, she orchestrated a chance encounter that made him like her at first sight.

The acting system had indicated that Lu Qiuming was an opportunity she couldn’t afford to lose. Wen Qingzhi agreed; it was indeed a great opportunity, especially since this body was impoverished. The original Wen Qingzhi had to work part-time jobs just to scrape together tuition for university. After realizing she was the female lead in this world, she felt it was beneath her to earn her tuition through such menial work.

Initially, her relationship with Lu Qiuming was thriving. He was more than willing to provide her with everything she desired, without any complaints. 

But then an unexpected incident occurred in the year leading up to Wen Qingzhi's departure abroad. At that time, Lu Qiuming’s mother approached her, and for reasons unknown, the system failed to work in her favor. Lu Qiuming’s mother threatened Wen Qingzhi, insisting she leave him. She even stated that if Wen Qingzhi didn’t break up with Lu Qiuming, all his cards would be frozen, cutting off any financial support he had.

In essence, if Wen Qingzhi chose not to go abroad at that moment, she wouldn’t be able to gain anything from her relationship with him in the future. Thus, she had no choice but to break up with Lu Qiuming, claiming it was for their better future that she would leave for overseas studies. This way, she could secure her own bright future while ensuring that Lu Qiuming would continue to love her, leaving a good impression of her as a shining memory in his heart.

After Yan Xinfei hurried back to the company, she immediately called for a meeting. Once the meeting concluded, she began sifting through documents. To her dismay, she discovered that the previous owner of her body had fallen deeply for Lu Qiuming, and regardless of whether the contracts with his company resulted in profit or loss for hers, she had pursued the collaboration.

Yan Xinfei couldn’t help but curse under her breath, calling the previous owner a love-struck fool. With such reckless choices, how could the original owner expect to avoid bankruptcy? Although she had terminated all collaborations with Lu’s company, the projects they had previously worked on had already incurred significant losses. All she could do was swallow her frustration, as those were the messes left by the original owner.

At most, Yan Xinfei could find ways to reclaim the benefits that Lu’s company had unjustly absorbed. While this wouldn’t be difficult for her, it was still a hassle, especially since it was the original owner’s mess. The lost funds weren’t a significant concern for Yan Xinfei, but the burden of dealing with the fallout was frustrating.

She worked late into the night, handling documents. During that time, her younger brother, Yu Zhuo, sent her numerous messages. Being too busy to respond, she didn’t have the chance to reply in a timely manner.

**(In the afternoon)**  
Little Cutie: Sister, sister, are you back from your business trip?  
Little Cutie: Sister, have you eaten yet?  
Little Cutie: (๑❛ᴗ❛๑)

**(At 9 PM)**  
Little Cutie: Sister, are you asleep?  
Little Cutie: Sister, are you very busy?  

**(At 11 PM)**  
Little Cutie: Then you should rest early, sister. Girls shouldn’t stay up late; it’s bad for your health.  
Little Cutie: Goodnight! ฅ(⌯͒• ɪ •⌯͒)ฅ  

Yu Zhuo kept sending messages but noticed that it had been a long time without any response from his sister. Yawning, he muttered, “Sigh! My sister hasn’t replied yet. Does she have another dog now?” He stared at the message window with his sister’s name, bobbing his little head slightly, a tuft of fluffy hair sticking up adorably. Eventually, unable to stay awake any longer, he drifted off to sleep.

Seeing how late it was, Yan Xinfei decided to respond to Yu Zhuo’s messages.  
Sister, mine: I’m back.  
Sister, mine: I’ve eaten.  
Sister, mine: Uh, I’m a bit busy.  
Sister, mine: I’ll sleep soon.

When Yan Xinfei typed that she had eaten, a twinge of guilt washed over her. She had been so swamped that she hadn’t had a moment to grab a meal, but convincing herself that her little brother didn’t need to know, she replied confidently. She believed that maintaining a strong presence was crucial.

Returning to her apartment, Yan Xinfei quickly grabbed a few bites to eat before heading to the shower and then off to bed.
