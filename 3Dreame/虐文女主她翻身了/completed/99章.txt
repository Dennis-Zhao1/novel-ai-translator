**Backlash**

“...This is our girl, Lucy Xu…” 

As Xu Zhengwei introduced her, he gently pulled Lucy back from her daydreaming state. 

Lucy rolled her eyes discreetly, but as she faced the crowd, she plastered on a fake smile. After all, if she didn’t put on that smile, she’d have to endure her father’s incessant lecturing when they got home later. 

She hid her reluctance so well that no one could see the forced nature of her enthusiasm. 

Long before this event, people had already cast curious glances at Lucy Xu, wondering which companion Xu Zhengwei had brought along. Little did they expect… 

It wasn’t their fault for being confused; they had only seen Lucy when she was a child, and it was perfectly normal for them not to recognize her as an adult. Typically, at such gatherings, one appeared with either a male or female partner. 

Meanwhile, Wen Qingzhi stared incredulously at Lucy standing by Xu Zhengwei's side. 

How could this be? Before the audition for the variety show, she had meticulously reviewed the backgrounds of all the contestants, and clearly… 

But now, how did this happen? 

If she had known Lucy was Xu Zhengwei's daughter, she would have treated her differently on the show. 

It was all Lucy’s fault; why hide her identity? 

Wen Qingzhi lamented that she should have been more sincere in befriending Lucy back then. 

On the other side, Lu Qiuming looked at Wen Qingzhi with eager eyes. “Qingzhi, can you do me a favor?” 

“What?” Wen Qingzhi blinked, surprised by the question. 

“Can you get close to Xu Zhengwei's daughter? If you do that… then collaborating with Xu Zhengwei’s company will be a piece of cake for me!” 

Hearing his request, Wen Qingzhi felt a wave of panic rise in her chest. 

Lu Qiuming, seeing she didn’t answer immediately, mistook it for her reluctance to help. Frustration flared in him, and he almost lost his temper. 

“Brother Qiuming, I’ll do my best,” she managed to force a smile. 

“Thank you, that really helps.” 

Once Lu Qiuming heard her acquiescence, his earlier anger seemed to evaporate, and a softer demeanor took over. 

Wen Qingzhi felt a little stifled, her gaze darting around anxiously. 

Suddenly, she caught sight of Yan Xinfei and Yu Zhuyi engaged in an intimate interaction, which soured her mood even more. 

She hadn’t planned to be here… 

But then again, she thought, it might not be so bad; after all… 

Quietly, she chanted a spell, sending a subtle force toward Yan Xinfei. 

Wen Qingzhi envisioned a scenario where Yan Xinfei would embarrass herself, her strapless dress slipping down in front of everyone. 

That would surely make the headlines tomorrow, and it would be far more malicious than merely causing Yan Xinfei physical harm. 

Yan Xinfei was busy playing with a cute little toy, thoroughly enjoying herself. 

Suddenly, she felt a force approaching her, and it was unmistakably aimed at her. 

Reacting instinctively, she used her psychic ability to counter that energy. 

“Ah…” 

Just as Wen Qingzhi was about to break into a victorious smile, she felt a sudden, sharp pain in her head. 

Though it lasted only a few seconds, it left her pale, her lips devoid of color, and her face contorted in agony as beads of sweat trickled down her forehead. 

In an instant, her body weakened, and she leaned against Lu Qiuming for support. 

Lu Qiuming, lost in thoughts of how he would secure a collaboration with Xu Zhengwei, suddenly found himself with a collapsing Wen Qingzhi in his arms. 

His heart raced, and he was about to ask when he noticed her unusual pallor. 

“What’s wrong? Are you feeling unwell?” 

“It’s nothing, just let me lean for a moment,” Wen Qingzhi replied weakly. 

“Are you sure? Should I take you to the hospital?” 

Deep down, he still cared for Wen Qingzhi, despite his ambitions. 

“No need, just let me rest for a bit.” 

Although Yan Xinfei had merely countered the force, she was unaware that Wen Qingzhi had faced a backlash from her own spell.
