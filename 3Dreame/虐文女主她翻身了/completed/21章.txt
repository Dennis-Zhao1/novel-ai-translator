**Chapter 21: The Lecture**

In the days that followed, Yvonne did not meet with her little cutie again; their only interactions were through WeChat. However, her responses were sporadic, which meant they hadn’t had many conversations lately. 

For Yu Zhu Yi, this behavior from Yvonne felt like a warning sign, an indication of an impending crisis. Yet, he found himself helpless, as he was merely a friend of her sister and nothing more.

“Yvonne, the president of Di Yun University has invited you back to your alma mater to give a financial lecture for the students. Do you want to accept the invitation or decline it?” Assistant Liu inquired, looking at her expectantly.

Indeed, the original Yvonne was an alumna of Di Yun University, where she had excelled as a student. Each year, she would arrange for her company to invest in the university, and now Yvonne was the largest shareholder there. To say she was outstanding would be an understatement; she had scored full marks in every subject during her studies and had won numerous national scholarships. Even the president continued to praise her long after her graduation, and the faculty often mentioned her achievements to students.

“Di Yun University?” Yvonne mused, recalling that her little cutie was also a student there, and it had been a while since they had last seen each other. Perhaps she could catch a glimpse of him at the lecture. With a calm nod, she replied, “Sure, let’s do it this afternoon.”

“Got it,” Assistant Liu said, moving to make the arrangements.

“Hey, Yu, have you heard? A legendary figure is coming to our school to give a lecture! I can’t wait to find out who it is. I heard she’s someone the president praises, and even that stiff Professor Yan has acknowledged her. I’m so looking forward to her arrival…” Zhao Min chattered animatedly, only to realize that Yu Zhu Yi wasn’t paying attention.

Frustrated, Zhao Min turned away from him and addressed Chao Yi Xiu instead. “Yi Xiu, I heard the speaker is really beautiful. Do you think I should try to get her number? How should I approach her?”

Chao Yi Xiu adjusted his glasses and replied in a refined manner, “It’s still daytime,” implying that Zhao Min should stop daydreaming.

Yu Zhu Yi scoffed lightly and ignored him, thinking to himself: No one could compare to my sister’s beauty. Lost in thought, he casually pulled out his phone and dove into a mobile game.

Noticing Yu Zhu Yi was engrossed in a game, Zhao Min thought, As expected of Yu, he’s still got time to play games. 

Yu Zhu Yi immersed himself in the game, but then he felt a gaze piercing through him, aggressive and intense. He furrowed his brow but didn’t look up.

Then, he heard the voice he had yearned for over the past few days, the voice that had haunted his dreams. “Hello, students. I’m your senior, and the president has invited me to introduce some financial knowledge to you. Next…”

Yu Zhu Yi shot his head up, staring at the source of the voice in disbelief. It was the person he had been missing, the one who had appeared in his dreams every night.

His character in the game was defeated, and his teammates cursed him, but he paid them no mind. He blacked out the screen and feigned the demeanor of a diligent student, fully focused on Yvonne’s every move, lost in thought: My sister is truly impressive; her voice is so pleasant to listen to...

Zhao Min turned around inadvertently and was shocked to see Yu Zhu Yi actually paying attention to the lecture. His eyes widened as he exclaimed, “What the…!”

Around them, students were whispering, “She’s so beautiful!” “Does she have a boyfriend? I want to pursue her!” “Look at those legs, that figure—wow…” “I’d die just to be close to her…” and various other comments echoed in the air.

Yu Zhu Yi’s expression darkened instantly, a flicker of rage igniting in his eyes. His clenched fist revealed the tension in his muscles as he said coolly, “Do you want me to send you to the underworld right now?” He paused, his gaze sweeping menacingly across the crowd. “Quiet down.”

The surrounding students froze, not daring to move for fear of incurring his wrath. They surely could not afford the consequences of angering him. Zhao Min remained silent, glancing between Yu Zhu Yi and the speaker at the podium. He nudged Chao Yi Xiu beside him, whispering, “Yi Xiu, what’s going on with Yu?”

“Yeah, just what you think,” Chao Yi Xiu replied knowingly.

Zhao Min felt a wave of disbelief wash over him, only to remember that he had mentioned wanting to pursue the speaker just moments ago. He silently prayed that Yu Zhu Yi hadn’t been listening.
