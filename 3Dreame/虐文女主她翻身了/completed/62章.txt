**A Night at the Snack Street**

Yan Xinfai followed the route provided by her little companion, heading towards the bustling snack street. As they stepped out of the car, the lively atmosphere enveloped them, filled with the enticing scents of street food wafting through the air.

Even before they entered the snack street, the aroma of delicious food greeted them from a distance. Strolling along the vibrant night market, an array of snacks dazzled their eyes: there were savory stinky tofu, refreshing green bean desserts, steaming noodle soups, and colorful rice rolls, each more tempting than the last!

Upon arriving, Yan Xinfai felt a warmth envelop her, a sense of belonging amidst the everyday joys of life. Yu Zhuyi, her little brother, tugged eagerly at her hand, his eyes sparkling as he led her towards a nearby food stall.

With enthusiasm, their little companion stood in front of the stall, carefully selecting his snacks. He hesitated, caught in a dilemma over whether to order a medium portion of stinky tofu or a small one. There were just so many options that he worried about overindulging and not being able to enjoy the other treats waiting ahead.

Yan Xinfai quickly noticed the conflicting expression on his face. Without missing a beat, she turned to the stall owner and said, "Excuse me, can we have a medium portion of stinky tofu, please?"

The owner responded with a cheerful, "Sure thing!" He deftly prepared the order and handed the steaming stinky tofu over to them.

“Here you go! If you enjoy it, feel free to come back next time!” he added with a smile. Yan Xinfai paid for the snack, replying, “Thank you!” before turning to see Yu Zhuyi eagerly munching on the tofu.

With his mouth full, he exclaimed, “Sister, this is so good!” but his words came out in a garbled rush.

Yan Xinfai chuckled, realizing he meant to say it was delicious. “If you like it, eat as much as you want! If it’s not enough, we can always buy more later.”

Yu Zhuyi, perhaps realizing he was speaking too fast with his mouth full, fell silent. Once he swallowed, he looked up at her again. “Sister, this is really delicious! Do you want to try some?” He offered the remaining piece of stinky tofu towards her.

Yan Xinfai hesitated. To be honest, she had never tried stinky tofu before. Back before the apocalypse, she was a busy corporate executive, with little time to indulge in street food. Her first visit to a snack street had been in middle school, where she watched enviously as her classmates enjoyed their outings, while she had to rush home for various training classes due to family obligations.

Growing up, she had few friends, often seen as the perfect student in others' eyes. But deep down, she was just a curious kid filled with the desire to make friends. She had tried to reach out to others, only to find that many were either looking to elevate their own status by associating with her or treating her as a trophy friend to show off. After a series of disappointments, she stopped trying to make friends, settling for superficial acquaintances.

However, over time, she learned to appreciate her solitude. After the world changed, snacks like stinky tofu became a rarity. So standing there, facing Yu Zhuyi’s eager offer, she felt a twinge of hesitation. But just as he thought she wouldn’t take it back, she leaned down and took a bite of the stinky tofu he held out.

To her surprise, while the smell was indeed strong, the taste was utterly delightful. “This is really good,” she admitted, beaming at him.

After taking a bite himself, Yu Zhuyi decided he should save some room for all the other treats still to come. But what to do with the remaining tofu in his hand? Yan Xinfai could read the conflict on his face and, without a second thought, took the remaining tofu from him, finishing it off with a satisfied smile.

Yu Zhuyi blushed a little, watching his sister devour the last bit. “Alright, now we can go buy other snacks! You can pick whatever you want, and if you can’t finish it, I’ll help you out. No need to worry about wasting food.”

“Sister, you’re so nice to me!” he exclaimed, his face lighting up with gratitude.

The scene that followed was heartwarming: a strikingly beautiful woman quietly following behind a charming young boy. He eagerly dashed to grab any snack that caught his eye, while Yan Xinfai stayed close behind, covering the costs.

Each time Yu Zhuyi tasted a new treat, he would take a bite and then pass the rest to Yan Xinfai, who graciously accepted and finished what he couldn’t. Although her expression remained cool and composed, her eyes sparkled with affection, evident to anyone who happened to glance their way.

The atmosphere was intimate, a world of their own, making it clear that others around them—mostly couples enjoying the night—could only watch in admiration. Many girls gazed enviously at the connection between Yan Xinfai and Yu Zhuyi, momentarily forgetting about their own boyfriends and snacks.

There was no denying it—the dynamic between them radiated chemistry, embodying the classic trope of a powerful woman and her adorable younger partner.
