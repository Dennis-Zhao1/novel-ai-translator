### Chapter 17: Discussing Cooperation

After Yan Xinfeng returned home, her company secretary called her.

"Ms. Yan, we need to be in Country M tomorrow to discuss a 200 million contract with our partners. We're set to depart tonight, and I've made all the arrangements."

Yan Xinfeng rubbed her temples, suppressing her irritation. "Wasn't someone else already scheduled to go and negotiate?"

"Yes, but the partners expressed dissatisfaction with our representative. They specifically requested you to handle the discussions. They said if you don't attend, it shows we don't value them. They want to see our company's sincerity."

She sighed heavily. "Fine, we'll leave tonight then."

Checking her phone, she hesitated to open the chat with her friend, Adam. She felt there was no need to involve him in this matter; their relationship wasn’t close enough yet for that level of sharing. So, she opted not to look at her messages and instead drove to the airport.

Before long, she boarded the flight with her assistant. 

Meanwhile, Adam was anxiously waiting for a response from her. His phone buzzed with her messages:

Adam: Did you eat dinner yet?  
Adam: Still working?  
Adam: ………  

After a long silence without a reply, he felt a pang of unease, his fingers drumming impatiently on his phone screen. In reality, Yan Xinfeng had simply missed his messages due to the rush of her departure.

When Yan Xinfeng and her team arrived at the hotel in Country M, it was already 1 AM. Assuming Adam was asleep, especially since she had a meeting in the morning, she decided not to check WeChat and went straight to bed.

It wasn't until the next day that she finally saw Adam's messages.

Adam: Sorry, I was on a flight last night and had my phone off, so I didn't see your messages.  

Almost instantly, she received a reply.

Adam: It’s okay, Ms. Yan. Your work is important.  
Adam: But make sure to take care of yourself too!  
Adam: 【Caring for you】♬︎*(๑ºั╰︎╯︎ºั๑)♡︎  

Yan Xinfeng: Got it!

At the Bunuolin restaurant, named after the Moonlit Forest, she arrived to find the representative from Country M already waiting for her. This was a significant figure in M's business world, known for playing both sides of the market.

In the original storyline, this character was supposed to meet with her earlier, but the male lead had pushed back the deal, leading to his absence. Thus, he was unsure if the cooperation would actually succeed. It was also mentioned previously that the male lead's dream girl had somehow managed to secure this deal, elevating his status to rival that of the original protagonist. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to easily push the original protagonist aside later.

A man with a cold demeanor and an air of detachment extended his hand and greeted her in the local language, "Nice to meet you, Ms. Yan. I've heard so much about your capabilities. As the saying goes in your country..."

Another M national chimed in, "Hearing a hundred times is not as good as seeing once."

"Ah, that’s right! Ms. Yan, your reputation truly precedes you. The presence you exude is beyond that of ordinary people."

Yan Xinfeng smiled politely, shaking his hand for a few seconds without saying a word. 

The aloof man continued, "I look forward to the cooperation proposal you will present."

Half an hour later, Yan Xinfeng had thoroughly impressed the M national with her skills, prompting him to exclaim, "Ms. Yan, you are so young yet so talented! I have no doubt you will achieve greatness in the future. I feel very comfortable working with you."

And so, the cooperation with Country M was easily secured by Yan Xinfeng.

After bidding farewell to the representatives, she instructed her assistant to book return tickets to China. They would board the flight back that very evening.
