**Chapter 35: The Questions of Grandma**

As they stepped through the grand entrance, a cobblestone path unfolded before them, bordered by rows of stone benches adorned with various potted flowers and bonsai. It was immediately clear that the owner of this courtyard possessed a refined taste.

At the end of the path, a vintage mahogany door beckoned to the left. Pushing it open led them into the living room.

Upon entering, all the chaos of the outside world seemed to fade away, leaving only a serene tranquility that enveloped the moment. The living room featured a grey-blue vintage cabinet that harmonized beautifully with the white decorative bricks, while the floor was laid with deep green antique tiles. 

The blend of traditional Chinese aesthetics with Western influences exuded a simple yet elegant charm. Grandma invited them to sit on the plush sofa, encouraging them to take a moment to rest before pouring them some West Lake Dragon Well tea.

Yen Xinfei picked up her teacup, took a sip, and exclaimed, “This is good tea.”

Hearing her compliment, Grandma’s eyes brightened. “You know tea, young lady?”

Xu Xiaoxiao also took a sip. While she could tell it was high-quality tea, she wasn’t sure what made it so special.

Yen Xinfei humbly replied, “I know a little.”

“Not many young people today appreciate tea,” Grandma said, her tone tinged with a hint of nostalgia. “Can you share your thoughts on tea with me?”

[SmartOne]: She can’t possibly be pretending she understands, right?

[FairyLady]: Chill, the fairy hasn’t even spoken yet.

[NotSoFunny]: Look, look! She’s struggling to answer.

[LoveCocoa]: Shut up! Can’t you see the fairy is deep in thought?

[AlmostABeauty]: If the fairy says she understands, then she does!

[MoreHonestThanIdeals]: It’s perfectly normal for the fairy not to have an answer. At least she knows how to appreciate tea.

[YouCanLeaveNow]: Just admit it; she doesn’t understand.

Yen Xinfei pondered for a moment before replying, “For tea classifications, there are six types: green tea, black tea, yellow tea, oolong tea, white tea, and dark tea. Additionally, there are specialty teas like Pu-erh and processed teas such as jasmine tea. Then there are substitute teas like chrysanthemum tea and rose tea, among others.”

After a brief pause, she continued, “I personally believe that green tea is the finest. Among the top six varieties of green tea, we have: West Lake Dragon Well, Biluochun, Anji White Tea, Taiping Houkui, Huangshan Maofeng, and Liu'an Guapian. The tea we’re enjoying right now is West Lake Dragon Well.”

“To determine whether a tea is truly good, we can evaluate it based on five criteria: First, the clarity of the tea's color—this is a direct standard for judging good tea. Second, there’s an old saying: ‘If it’s not bitter or astringent, it’s not good tea.’ Bitterness and astringency are inherent qualities of tea; however, if the bitterness lingers in the mouth, it can’t be considered good tea. Good tea should have a slight bitterness that gives way to a refreshing sweetness.”

She paused again, contemplating, before continuing, “Third…”

As Yen Xinfei shared her thoughts on tea, Grandma could only express her admiration with repeated praises of “Good! Good! Good!” 

Beside her, Xu Xiaoxiao looked up at her in awe, practically worshiping her.

[DisneyEscapee]: That’s a slap in the face, huh? 

[JustAGirl]: I checked online and found that everything she said is correct.

[IWantADeliciousBeating]: The fairy is truly all-knowing. How impressive!

[SummerFriend]: 666666666666

[AccountDeleted]: Look at Xu Xiaoxiao beside her! ♬︎*(๑ºั╰︎╯︎ºั๑)♡︎

[IHaveBeenTranscended]: Xu Xiaoxiao looked completely bewildered: Such professional knowledge! I don’t understand, but that doesn’t stop me from admiring the expert.

[ItIsSaturday]: Knowing that Xu Xiaoxiao doesn’t get it puts me at ease.

[ExplodingInPlace]: I thought I was the only one who didn’t understand.

“Hey, Yu Ge, wanna see something cool?” Zhao Min asked mischievously, holding up her phone to Yu Zhuyi.

“Get lost. Don’t bother me,” he replied curtly.

Zhao Min feigned disappointment, “What a shame! I just wanted to show you Yen Xinfei. Since…”

Upon hearing the name Yen Xinfei, Yu Zhuyi immediately grabbed Zhao Min’s arm, asking urgently, “Where?”

“In the livestream room! You didn’t know? You really didn’t know?” Zhao Min said in exaggerated disbelief.

Yu Zhuyi snatched the phone from her, quickly understanding the situation before tossing it back into her hands.

Zhao Min carefully cradled her new phone, complaining, “Be careful, Yu Ge! Don’t break it; it’s brand new.”

Ignoring her, he focused on his phone, searching for the livestream where Yen Xinfei was broadcasting.
