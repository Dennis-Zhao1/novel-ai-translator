She felt a twinge of jealousy.

Wen Qingzhi had been caught up in the joy of regaining her magical powers for several days and hadn’t immediately thought about earning faith points.

Lu Qiuming had gotten kicked by Yan Xinfeng at the amusement park, and when he returned home that night, he quietly began to execute the plan he had been nursing in his heart.

---

Since that night when Yan Xinfeng had dinner at her old home with her adorable boyfriend and met her grandfather, she had been busy for several days, dealing with company documents and attending meetings nonstop.

However, her boyfriend made it a point to bring her lunch every day at noon and constantly messaged her on WeChat. 

Even though they didn’t see each other often, and Yan Xinfeng couldn’t always reply to his messages right away, their relationship was gradually warming up. 

After starting to date, life didn’t change much; the only difference was that she had someone to care about her—a person who would worry about her well-being. 

Life had to carry on; she couldn’t let romance consume her entire existence. She still needed to work hard because only by doing so could she balance love and bread—after all, in reality, it was impossible to survive on love alone!

Her boyfriend had been bringing her lunch for several days now, and soon everyone at the company recognized him. 

Employees had learned that their president was dating a university student who was two years younger than her.

The days flowed by peacefully and uneventfully.

One day, wearing gold-rimmed glasses and a well-fitted professional outfit, Secretary Yu Xiaoli knocked on the door of the president's office.

“Come in,” a cool voice from inside replied.

Yu Xiaoli pushed the door open and stepped inside, immediately spotting Yan Xinfeng with her head down, focused on the documents spread out on her desk.

Yu Xiaoli couldn’t help but admire the figure of the woman before her. Even though the president wore a stern expression, she radiated charm and elegance.

Yan Xinfeng sensed her presence but didn’t hear any words from the secretary, feeling a strange gaze lingering on her.

Slowly, she raised her head, casting a curious glance at the secretary in front of her.

As soon as Yu Xiaoli met Yan Xinfeng’s gaze, she panicked and quickly averted her eyes, afraid of revealing what was on her mind.

“What’s wrong?” Yan Xinfeng asked, slightly furrowing her brows.

“President… We have a dinner to attend tonight at the Xu Group,” Yu Xiaoli stammered in response.

“The Xu Group? Where is it?” 

“At the Aerial Hotel.”

“Got it.” With that, Yan Xinfeng returned her attention to the work in front of her.

But after a few minutes, she noticed that Yu Xiaoli hadn’t left yet.

“Is there anything else?”

“No… nothing…” 

“Then go back to work.”

“Okay… sure.” Yu Xiaoli slowly walked to the door, stealing glances at the striking figure seated at the desk. However, she noticed that the president was engrossed in her work, completely unaware of her presence, which left her feeling a bit disheartened.

After Yu Xiaoli left, Yan Xinfeng didn’t think much of it. That fleeting glance had felt a bit odd, but she assumed it was just her cold demeanor making her employees feel uneasy. After all, she never imagined any woman would feel that way about her…

After leaving the president’s office, Yu Xiaoli ran into Yu Zhuqi, who was bringing a lunch box for the president.

Yu Xiaoli forced a smile as she greeted Yu Zhuqi, who nodded in response before heading inside to find Yan Xinfeng.

As Yu Xiaoli lowered her gaze, she tried to conceal the jealousy and resentment flickering in her eyes.
