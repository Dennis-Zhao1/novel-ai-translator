**Chapter 48: The Gift Prepared by the Original Owner**

The little darling breathed softly, his chest rising and falling gently with each breath. His eyes were tightly shut, and his long, slender eyelashes cast delicate shadows on his cheeks, resembling tiny fans. A faint smile curved his lips, as if he were dreaming of something joyful.

Yin Xinfei stared intently at his rosy lips. In his slumber, the little darling seemed to sense some lurking danger and gently furrowed his brow.

Suddenly, Yin Xinfei leaned down and lightly pecked his forehead, then brushed against his tightly closed eyes and finally landed on his lips. 

At first, the little darling’s mouth remained closed, but as Yin Xinfei pulled back, he pinched his nose playfully. The little darling, feeling a bit breathless, instinctively opened his mouth. In that fleeting moment, Yin Xinfei seized the opportunity and swiftly sealed his lips once more.

In his dream, Yu Zhuyi felt something licking at his face, finally settling at his mouth. He felt a bit short of breath and frowned, as if he were trying to open his eyes.

Realizing this, Yin Xinfei halted his actions, releasing the little darling’s lips, and began to pepper soft kisses along his neck and collarbone.

After a long while, Yin Xinfei held him tightly, burying his head in the crook of his neck. 

Once their breathing steadied, Yin Xinfei gently carried him into the guest room next door. 

Although she longed to cuddle with the little darling while sleeping, feeling him soft and plush like a human-shaped pillow, she figured that doing so might cause him to wake up in a flurry. 

To avoid such a scenario, she decided against it. After all, there would be plenty of time in the future to hold him while they slept. There was no need to rush.

Yin Xinfei laid the little darling down on the bed in the guest room, tucking him in securely to ensure he wouldn’t catch a chill before leaving.

She then went downstairs to turn off the lights and returned to her own room to absorb the natural energy of the moon and sun. 

The energy absorbed here couldn’t compare to that from the zombie cores during the apocalypse, but nighttime was the best time to absorb energy nonetheless.

She sat quietly in meditation for about an hour before finishing. 

Afterward, she went in for a shower, preparing for bed.

Half an hour later, she emerged from the bathroom, her hair damp, and began to blow-dry it when a sudden thought struck her — she had forgotten that the little darling hadn’t showered before falling asleep.

What to do? Yin Xinfei felt a bit anxious, but the little darling was already deep in slumber.

As she dried her hair to about half-dry, she turned off the hairdryer, hesitating over whether to wake him up for a shower.

Just then, a knock echoed through the room.

Here, aside from herself, there was only the little darling.

“Just come in directly,” Yin Xinfei called out to the little darling outside the door.

With a soft click, Yu Zhuyi pushed the door open and stepped inside.

His face was slightly flushed, and he shuffled awkwardly to a spot not far from Yin Xinfei, stammering, “Sister, I… I’m sorry. I just… I…”

Seeing the little darling stammer for so long without finishing a single sentence, she cut to the chase: “You should go take a shower now. I’ll get your clothes for you in a bit.”

Upon hearing this, Yu Zhuyi’s ears turned crimson, as if they might bleed. 

He shyly mumbled, “Okay, thank you, Sister,” and with that, he shuffled awkwardly toward the door. His retreating figure looked almost like he was fleeing in embarrassment.

Yin Xinfei found it strange, puzzled by his sudden shyness.

She shook her head, pushing aside her thoughts and delving into the memories of the original owner. She recalled that there was a set of clothes the original owner had bought for the male lead. 

Initially meant as a gift for him, the clothes had remained untouched because the male lead had harshly remarked, “I don’t like anything that comes from the original owner.” 

Thus, the clothes had been left to collect dust, but now they might finally serve a purpose. 

Though intended for the male lead, the clothes were brand new and fairly expensive; many would-be buyers would find it hard to get their hands on them.

What a shame that only the male lead couldn’t appreciate them.

Following her memory, she made her way to the guest room to retrieve that set of clothes.
