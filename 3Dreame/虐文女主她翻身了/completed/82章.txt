He really wanted to pry open his head and see what he was thinking.

The old man glanced at his grandson, growing more and more displeased. 

"Girls are definitely better," he mused. "Even if my grandson can’t marry her in the future, I can still adopt her as my goddaughter."

Unbeknownst to Yu Zhuo, his grandfather had already planned a future where, if he and his sister ever broke up, he would end up with an additional sister figure.

Yu Zhuo stood there, lost in thought, and when he finally snapped out of it, he noticed that his grandfather and sister were already deep in conversation as they headed upstairs to the study.

A wave of worry washed over him. While they seemed to be getting along well on the surface, wasn't it always the case in dramas that a couple in love faced obstacles from their elders? They often had to part ways, only to endure hardships before reuniting happily. But he didn’t want to be separated from his sister!

If Yan Xinfay knew what was going through Yu Zhuo's mind, she would surely say, "Kid, this isn't a drama. Stop watching so much melodramatic stuff."

In reality, the topics of conversation between Yan Xinfay and the old man were entirely different from Yu Zhuo's anxieties.

Once they reached the study, the old man and Yan Xinfay sat down at the desk, diving into discussions about business matters. It was a classic case of the old man asking questions and Yan Xinfay answering confidently.

Seeing her articulate thoughts on complex business issues, the old man couldn’t help but feel optimistic about the future. This young woman would surely achieve great things. He silently resolved that even if his grandson and she were to part ways someday, he wouldn’t let any bad blood form between them. Even if they couldn’t be friends, they shouldn’t end up as enemies, or else…

The harmonious atmosphere in the study was in stark contrast to Yu Zhuo’s anxious waiting outside.

Finally, Yu Zhuo imagined the old man acting like a villainous mother-in-law from a drama, waving a check to send his sister away, just as the two of them came down, laughing and chatting.

"Why is it so strange? This isn’t at all what I imagined!" Yu Zhuo exclaimed internally.

As Yan Xinfay descended the stairs, she spotted the adorably perplexed figure of Yu Zhuo waiting at the bottom. 

She cast a glance at him before turning to her grandfather. "It's getting late, Grandpa. I’ll head back now."

The old man looked at the clock on the wall, realizing it was already past ten. 

"Alright, be careful!" he said, then turned to Yu Zhuo. "You should drive her home."

Upon hearing her grandfather’s words, Yan Xinfay immediately refused, "There’s no need to trouble him. I can go back on my own."

She thought it was unlikely for someone of her status to need someone else to drive her, and besides, Yu Zhuo looked so delicate; it wouldn’t be safe for a boy to be out alone.

The old man gave Yu Zhuo a knowing look.

Finally, in a moment of shared understanding, Yu Zhuo brushed aside his sister's objections and pulled Yan Xinfay toward the door.

Reluctantly, she followed, thinking to herself that she could just drop him back off later. Yes, that was the plan!

Once they got into the car, even though it was supposed to be Yu Zhuo driving her home, she took the wheel herself. 

She believed firmly that since he was such a cute boy, it was her duty as a girl to protect him. 

In her memories, she recalled how her mother used to look after her father in the same way when her parents were still around.
