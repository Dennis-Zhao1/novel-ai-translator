He had ordered this kind of service.  
Now, he just needed to find a woman to verify things...  
If it really was time to find a girlfriend, then he'd go ahead and look for one.  
He couldn’t believe he was having these thoughts about his good buddy.  
Surely, he wasn't that much of a beast, right?  
He sighed heavily, feeling a mix of confusion and frustration.  
Besides, he was straight—straight! He was definitely straight…  
He downed the last of his red wine in one go, feeling the warmth spread through him.  
Then he called over the bar manager.  
The manager was a well-dressed man in his thirties, exuding a polished, sophisticated air.  
"How can I help you today, Mr. Zhao?" he asked respectfully, standing beside him.  
"Get me a few pretty girls, around my age... um..."  
Zhao Min trailed off, unsure of how to finish his request.  
Even though he was a regular here, he usually came to quietly sip his drinks, never having ordered any special services before.  
After all, this was his first time and he had no idea what to expect...  
"Mr. Zhao, are you looking for one of our princesses?"  
The manager’s eyes lit up with understanding, recognizing the hesitance in Zhao Min’s voice.  
He knew Zhao Min well, having seen him frequent the place, but he had never seen him request such services before.  
Curiosity getting the better of him, the manager asked, “Are you really sure you want to order a princess? You’ve never…”  
“Enough chit-chat! If I say I want it, then I want it. Why do you need to know so much?” Zhao Min snapped, irritation creeping into his tone.  
He couldn't exactly tell the manager that he had feelings for his best friend, could he?  
There was no way he could say that out loud! He still had some pride left!  
Seeing Zhao Min’s frustration, the manager wisely decided not to pry further and quickly went off to arrange the service.  
A few minutes later, he returned with three of the most popular “princesses” in tow, leading them toward Zhao Min’s private room.  
Just a few steps away from the door, they encountered the senior manager.  
The senior manager was dressed similarly to the regular manager in a sleek black suit, his neatly groomed brown hair and sharp eyebrows giving him an air of authority. His bright, sparkling eyes exuded a refined charm, making him seem both approachable and distinguished.  
“Good day, Lin,” the manager greeted him.  
Lin nodded in acknowledgment, but his expression shifted to one of confusion as he noticed the three “princesses” following closely behind.  
“Who ordered them?” Lin asked, a hint of suspicion in his voice.  
Although it was clear they were headed to Zhao Min’s usual room, he still wanted to confirm.  
“They were ordered by Mr. Zhao.”  
“Mr. Zhao personally ordered this service?” Lin asked, puzzled.  
“Yes,” the manager nodded.  
“Alright, I see,” Lin said, his expression turning serious as he turned to leave.  
The manager was left bewildered, watching Lin walk away without any further explanation.  
But since he couldn’t figure it out, he decided not to dwell on it.  
Turning back to the three “princesses,” he said, “Inside is Mr. Zhao. Make sure you take good care of him. Try your best to fulfill all his requests; if he’s happy, you all understand what that means, right?”  
The moment the three “princesses” heard it was Mr. Zhao, their eyes sparkled with excitement.  
After all, he was a legend around here! They had heard his name countless times during their time working at the bar. If they could get close to him…  
Even if they couldn't fully win him over, just spending a night with him would be more than enough.  
Their enthusiasm surged even before they met the guest.
