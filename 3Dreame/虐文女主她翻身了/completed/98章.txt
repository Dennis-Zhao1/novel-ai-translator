He actually wants to compete with a girl?

Everyone watched as Xu Zhengwei chatted happily with his companion, all murmuring in surprise. Some were puzzled about who Yan Xinfang's male companion was, especially since he had caught Xu's attention. If Xu Zhengwei knew what was going through their minds, he would surely scoff. What did they mean about Yan Zhu Yi catching his eye? It was clearly he who was...

After a while...

"It's getting late; I have other matters to attend to. Excuse me, and I hope you all have fun," Xu Zhengwei said with an apologetic smile.

"Alright, we won't keep you, Xu," they replied. 

With that, Xu Zhengwei took hold of Xu Xiaoxiao, who was still clinging to Yan Xinfang, and they made their exit. Xu Xiaoxiao turned back three times, reluctant to leave.

Once they were gone, Yan Zhu Yi puffed up her cheeks and asked Yan Xinfang, “Sister, what do you think of Xu Xiaoxiao?”

Yan Xinfang seemed a bit puzzled. “She’s really nice—a very cute girl.”

Hearing her sister’s praise, Yan Zhu Yi felt a twinge of jealousy. With a slightly sour tone, she asked, “So... sister, compared to her, who’s cuter?”

Upon hearing this, Yan Xinfang fell silent, her head filled with three big question marks. To Yan Zhu Yi, this silence clearly meant that her sister thought Xu Xiaoxiao was cuter, putting her in a difficult position.

“It’s okay, sister. I know she’s cuter than me. Really, it’s fine,” she said, trying to dismiss her feelings.

When Yan Xinfang heard the little darling say this, she quickly forgot her earlier confusion and reassured her, “Of course, you’re the cutest! Don’t worry, sister likes you the most.”

Upon hearing her sister say she was cuter than Xu Xiaoxiao, Yan Zhu Yi’s eyes lit up with joy, clearly in a great mood.

“Do you smell something?” she asked suddenly.

“Nope,” Yan Zhu Yi replied, sniffing like a little puppy, seriousness etched on her face.

“Really? Because I smell something sour,” Yan Xinfang teased.

“Sour? Then how could I—Sister, I’m not jealous!” Yan Zhu Yi retorted, blushing as realization dawned on her.

“Okay, okay, you’re not jealous. It’s my mistake,” Yan Xinfang said, her tone full of affection.

Just then, the host of the evening’s gathering finally took the stage.

“Ladies and gentlemen, good evening! In this beautiful harvest season, under the clear autumn sky...”

The mundane opening speeches followed the same old routine. Yan Xinfang found it utterly boring. While she pretended to listen intently, her hand was sneakily playing with Yan Zhu Yi’s soft, delicate fingers beneath the table.

Yan Zhu Yi tried to pull his hand away but found he couldn’t.

“Sister,” he whispered, lowering his voice.

“Don’t worry; no one will notice,” Yan Xinfang reassured him.

Feeling like a thief, Yan Zhu Yi glanced around to see if anyone was watching them. After confirming no one was paying attention to their little antics, he relaxed. He desperately wanted to assert his claim, but he was also too shy!

————————————Little Theater————————

Yan Zhu Yi: Sister, quickly tell me, am I cuter or is she?

Yan Xinfang: A boy comparing cuteness with a girl?

(ー_ー)!!

Yan Zhu Yi: So you think she’s cuter than me. How could you, sister? It seems like your love for me is gone! Boohoo...

Yan Xinfang: (headache) You’re cute, alright? Is that enough?

Yan Zhu Yi: You’re just brushing me off. You really don’t love me anymore…
