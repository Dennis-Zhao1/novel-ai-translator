He and his sister were surprisingly dressed in matching outfits.

Although it was the cute little one who initially took Yanshin Fei's hand, in the end, it was Yanshin Fei who proactively held the little one's hand and led him along.

Yanshin Fei first drove the little one to her private makeup studio, where she usually got her styling done. From the outside, the studio looked rather ordinary, but stepping inside revealed a treasure trove of high-end equipment and products.

Let’s not even mention that the stylist here was someone so sought after that even the wealthy couldn't easily hire her. Just the makeup products alone were from renowned brands. A single lipstick here could easily cost over a hundred thousand, at the very least, given what Yu Zhuyi had seen. And that's not even taking into account the other makeup items scattered throughout—it's a world of wealth that one could hardly fathom.

This studio's expenses likely exceeded a million just for makeup alone.

When the stylist saw Yanshin Fei suddenly bring a young boy along, they were a bit taken aback. To them, Yu Zhuyi was just a young boy, as he appeared quite youthful. However, their surprise didn’t hinder their professionalism; after all, they wouldn’t pry into their employer's personal affairs, especially since…

Yanshin Fei instructed the stylist to start working on the little one's look while she settled down nearby to wait.

The styling process, while not overly long, certainly took a good amount of time—around forty minutes, to be precise. The stylist noticed that Yanshin Fei was patiently waiting, with no hint of impatience on her face. This surprised her, considering that Yanshin Fei gave off an air of superiority, not one to usually wait on others.

It was clear that the boy was someone significant to Yanshin Fei, and she quietly marveled at this. She had heard whispers about the connection between the young CEO and Lu Xiuming, after all. Yet, she had never seen Yanshin Fei bring anyone like him here for styling before.

Her previous assumptions about the rumors circulating in their circle now seemed unfounded.

But all of this was just her speculation. Fortunately, the male lead hadn’t previously agreed to come here for styling with the original owner of this body. Otherwise, everything would have been difficult to explain. After all, Yanshin Fei couldn’t just claim she wasn't the original owner, nor could she admit that she ever liked the male lead, since she truly hadn’t. The one who had liked the male lead was the original owner.

The original owner had genuinely been infatuated with that male lead, but he had ignored her. The male lead had merely accepted the benefits she offered without reciprocating, and he had rejected any attempts to draw closer to her.

Once the stylist finished Yu Zhuyi's look and makeup, it turned out that not much was needed; after all, Yu Zhuyi had great skin. A simple touch-up had transformed him significantly, making him appear much more mature—no longer resembling a college student on the verge of graduation.

As the little one neared the end of his styling, Yanshin Fei sought out another stylist for her own look.

About half an hour later, Yu Zhuyi was already dressed in the blue suit prepared by his sister, waiting for her.

If before the styling, he was an adorable little puppy, now he resembled a little prince stepping out of a fairy tale—noble and elegant beyond words.

Suddenly, Yu Zhuyi's eyes lit up. The stylist working on him couldn't help but glance over, curious about what had captured his attention.

What she saw took her breath away.

Yanshin Fei glided toward them in a blue starry gown, reminiscent of the night sky. The dress accentuated her fair skin, making her look even more radiant. Even without an expression on her face, she was astonishingly beautiful—like an ethereal fairy who had momentarily descended to earth, captivating everyone who beheld her.

In fact, the little one was mesmerized by Yanshin Fei's beauty, feeling an undeniable flutter in his heart for her.

Yanshin Fei slowly approached Yu Zhuyi, gently taking his dazed hand in hers.

With a smile, she teased, “What’s wrong? Am I that stunning that you’re speechless?”

“Uh-huh, you’re so beautiful…” 

It was only after uttering those words that he realized what he had just said, and his face turned a deep shade of crimson.

Shyly, he averted his gaze, trying not to stare at his sister, though he couldn’t resist sneaking glances at her out of the corner of his eye.

“Let’s go, my noble little prince.” 

Yanshin Fei led the little one toward the door.

Yu Zhuyi fell slightly behind and noticed, for the first time, that his sister's gown matched his outfit perfectly—they were, in essence, a couple's ensemble.

He was thrilled, as this meant that everyone at the party would recognize that he and his sister were dressed as a couple. It was as if they were subtly announcing to the world that he was her boyfriend.

He grinned foolishly, dazedly following his sister out.

Yanshin Fei undoubtedly noticed the change in his mood. Without looking back, she maintained a smile that shone like a sky full of stars—bright and dazzling.

【Just to clarify, lipsticks can range from inexpensive to exorbitantly priced. For example, H. Couture Beauty has a lipstick set that is known to be the most expensive in the world, priced at around $14 million. So, it’s perfectly reasonable for a lipstick mentioned in the story to cost tens of thousands!｡◕‿◕｡】
