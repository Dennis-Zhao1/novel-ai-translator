**A Short Story**

This short story has nothing to do with the main text...

"I regret it, but you no longer look back." — Qin Shifeng  
"Since it’s your choice, please don’t regret it in the future." — Yun Shu

Yun Shu and Qin Shifeng were university alumni.

From the moment he was born, Qin Shifeng was destined to be the heir of one of the three prominent families—the Qin family. Certainly, he excelled in his studies from a young age, and his family had high expectations for him.

Yun Shu met Qin Shifeng in their sophomore year. He was the campus heartthrob, while she was merely one of the volunteers in the Hongyu Club.  

Ordinarily, Yun Shu and Qin Shifeng wouldn’t have crossed paths, as they belonged to different worlds. Their encounter was reminiscent of the romantic tropes found in novels.

However, a dramatic moment unfolded for Yun Shu.

That day was like any picturesque scene described in a novel: the sun was warm, and fluffy white clouds drifted lazily across the sky. Yun Shu remembered it was a club activity, and with so many people around, everyone was busy. For the first time, she felt out of her depth.

If she hadn’t always followed the upperclassmen to club events since her freshman year, she wouldn’t have felt so inexperienced. But from the moment she joined, she had mostly been coasting along.

That day, Yun Shu hurriedly rushed to her destination, not paying attention to the path ahead, and collided into someone with a delightful scent of vanilla.

"I'm so sorry! I didn’t mean to!" she exclaimed, flustered.

A deep, magnetic voice replied, "Are you okay, classmate?"

Yun Shu was taken aback by the charm in his voice. She looked up to see the handsome figure before her—his features were sharply defined, as if carved from stone. Just that one look made her heart flutter in a way she hadn’t felt in a long time.

Flushing like a girl in love, she stammered, "I... I’m fine."

Before she could say anything more, their club leader called her over. She could only smile apologetically before hurriedly leaving.

After that day, she didn’t see the boy again for a long time, but Yun Shu had already fallen head over heels.

Yes, just from that one encounter, she was smitten—love at first sight. Although it seemed unbelievable, that was the truth.

Yun Shu tirelessly sought out his name, and it didn’t take long to discover it—Qin Shifeng, the campus heartthrob and the president of the basketball club.

Though Qin Shifeng was well-known, Yun Shu had never paid attention to such matters, which made their first meeting all the more special.

Using various means, she tried to learn everything about him and sought ways to create opportunities for accidental meetings.

Her relentless efforts eventually caught his attention.

By their junior year, Yun Shu and Qin Shifeng were together.

If the trajectory of their relationship continued, everything seemed perfect—they planned to marry after graduating, which was their shared dream.

However, on the night of their graduation, at the graduation party, Qin Shifeng encountered Su Ying while heading to the restroom.

Su Ying was a stunning woman who immediately recognized Qin Shifeng as her childhood neighbor.

One night was enough to change everything. Su Ying orchestrated a chance encounter, pretending to be drunk, leading others to misunderstand their relationship.

Yun Shu, feeling insecure about her own worth, mistakenly believed the rumors. She felt inferior to Su Ying due to her background, status, and talents.

Yun Shu was aware of Su Ying, the beauty from the neighboring school, who was both talented and attractive, and the heir of one of the three powerful families—the Su family.

Although Yun Shu knew nothing had happened between Qin Shifeng and Su Ying, the two were set to represent their schools in a competition together. The event would last a week, and once Qin Shifeng returned, Yun Shu noticed an increasing frequency of his contact with Su Ying.

She often saw intimate photos of them circulating on the school forum, and during that time, Qin Shifeng no longer spent as much time with her as before.

After several incidents, Yun Shu finally exploded. She confronted him, demanding to know if he chose her or Su Ying.

He replied, "Don’t make a scene. She’s just my childhood neighbor."

Disappointed, Yun Shu walked away, feeling his impatience was answer enough. It seemed he had made his choice.

The next time she heard of him, it was the news of his marriage to Su Ying.

At that moment, she felt dazed, unable to comprehend how it had come to this.

Yet, they had once been the envy of others, a couple admired by many.

Ultimately, she decided to leave.

After Yun Shu departed, although Qin Shifeng married Su Ying, he soon realized that she was not what he had imagined.

He began to reminisce about the little moments he shared with Yun Shu. When he tried to reach out, he found that all her contact information had been blocked, and none of their university friends had her new details.

Three years later, Yun Shu crossed paths with Qin Shifeng again. By this time, she had met the man she wished to spend her life with—Mu Bai, a gentle and polite person.

Yun Shu stood hand in hand with Mu Bai, intimately side by side when they encountered Qin Shifeng. He tried to say something, but Yun Shu pretended not to know him and pulled Mu Bai away.

Only Qin Shifeng was left standing there, filled with regret.

Yun Shu felt that since they had already parted ways, and since he hadn’t chosen her, the ideal ex should fade away. Mutual silence was the best way forward.
