**Causing a Stir**

Upon hearing Wen Qingzhi's words, Yan Xinfai gave her a half-smile that barely reached his eyes, his gaze cold and piercing. 

**[Xia Zuo]**: Ahhh, I’m all in! Just look at that charming bad-boy expression—I'm officially a fan. So cool, I love it!

**[Well Oh]**: Same here, totally drawn in by the looks…

Wen Qingzhi felt a pang of fear, but she also believed she hadn’t said anything wrong. She straightened her back and looked at Yan Xinfai with innocent defiance.

Yan Xinfai scoffed and shot back, “Him? Oh, I remember now. You mean that scumbag? Isn’t it true he’s been stringing me along while he’s with you?”

Wen Qingzhi’s face flushed crimson, a cold sweat forming in her palms. Yet, she quickly regained her composure, feigning ignorance. “How could that be? Gege Qiuming must care about you deep down…”

Yan Xinfai fell silent, merely staring coldly at her.

Feeling guilty, Wen Qingzhi lowered her head, her lashes fluttering like a curtain to hide her fierce emotions. With a voice that trembled slightly, she said, “I… I’m sorry. It’s my fault; I shouldn’t have said that…” Tears welled up in her eyes, threatening to spill over yet held back.

This scene tugged at the heartstrings of some male celebrities present.

One of them, a smitten artist named Zhou Cong, spoke up in a questioning tone, “She’s already apologized. What more do you want?” He then gently comforted Wen Qingzhi.

Yan Xinfai sneered, “What, are you trying to play the hero for her? What did I say? I’m just stating a simple fact.”

Another female artist who joined the variety show, Xu Xiaoxiao, looked down on Wen Qingzhi’s behavior. Angrily, she replied to Zhou Cong, “Exactly! No one has said anything to her. Didn’t she say it was fine? Are you just going to invest in her guilt?”

Xu Xiaoxiao knew through her assistant that Yan Xinfai was the biggest investor in the show. Setting aside Yan Xinfai’s status, she admired her. Wen Qingzhi’s actions disgusted her; she detested people who played both sides.

In the live chatroom:
**[Thousand Paper Cranes]**: I feel for Wen Qingzhi, sending hugs.

**[Little Cat’s Wen Qingzhi]**: Yeah, Sister Qingzhi just misspoke! Does Yan Xinfai need to be so serious? Ugh (rolls eyes).

**[Only Love Qingzhi]**: +1, I feel for Sister Qingzhi.

**[How Laughing Words]**: The ones above clearly are fans of Wen Qingzhi, just spouting nonsense. Can’t you think critically?

**[I Forgot]**: Exactly! Wen Qingzhi is obviously putting on an act, such a green tea girl.

**[Forget Old Difficulties]**: Same here, everyone should learn to spot a green tea girl!

**[Heart Thief]**: Isn’t she just relying on the fact that Yan Xinfai doesn’t have as many fans as her?

**[Blank Hole]**: Hasn’t anyone noticed those words "biggest investor"? (surprised)

**[Dreaming of the Eiffel Tower]**: Does that mean Yan Xinfai is the biggest investor? Wow, I can’t even!

**[Changsha Girl Loves Xingbao]**: You’re not the only one thinking that!

…

Zhou Cong asked directly, “What ‘biggest investor’?” He knew that the biggest investor was the Yan Corporation, but he didn’t know who was behind it. Yan Corporation—could it be…

Suddenly, Zhou Cong’s expression changed, and he stumbled back a few steps in shock.

He looked at Wen Qingzhi in disbelief, noting her evasive expression. Realization hit him, and he felt a bit embarrassed, but he held back from saying anything further.

At this moment, the director stepped in to ease the tension. (For the director, controversy was a good thing—it was a hot topic.)

The director spoke with a serious tone, “From here on out, you’ll need to find families in the town willing to provide you lunch.”

At that, a chorus of complaints erupted. “Find our own? How do we do that?”

“The variety show doesn’t even provide food?” “What kind of arrangement is that?”

“Our phones, wallets, and bank cards have all been taken away! We’re broke here, come on!”

Only Yan Xinfai stood there, unfazed.

Song Lin turned to Gu Zihan, puzzled. “Hey, why isn’t Yan Xinfai worried at all?”

Gu Zihan shook his head, indicating he didn’t know.

Meanwhile, Wen Qingzhi, filled with jealousy, muttered under her breath, “Maybe she’s already known about the show’s arrangements and prepared in advance…”
