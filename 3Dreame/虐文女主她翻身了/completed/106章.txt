That’s because you’ve fallen for someone else.

But for some reason, Zhao Min felt like something was missing. Sure, the girls around him were beautiful, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that they lacked something essential. He couldn’t help but compare them to Chao Yixiu in his mind...

He found himself unable to stop thinking: if it were him feeding her wine, then...

Ugh, what the hell was he thinking? 

He forcibly redirected his attention to the beautiful women and the fine drinks surrounding him. 

Yet, he couldn't calm his racing thoughts.

“Damn it,” Zhao Min muttered in frustration.

Then, a flash of inspiration struck him. 

“Hey, hey, hey! Whoever can answer my question gets a thousand bucks!” Zhao Min announced to the group.

The girls perked up at the mention of money. They couldn't help but click their tongues in surprise. In their line of work as bar hostesses, they typically made about a thousand to two thousand a night. And now, just for answering a single question...

This made Xiao Yu acutely aware of the wealth disparity, fueling her desire to climb the social ladder and be with someone rich.

Xiao Yao and Xiao Tian halted their previous activities and stepped in front of Zhao Min, effectively blocking Xiao Yu, who had just been pouring Zhao Min’s drink.

Xiao Yu’s eyes sparkled with cunning as she quickly added something to Zhao Min’s drink. She swirled the glass until whatever she had put in disappeared, then handed the drink to Zhao Min.

“Zhao, drink up!” 

Zhao Min casually took the glass without noticing the oddly amused expression on Xiao Yu's face. 

Xiao Yu watched him eagerly, but he didn’t immediately down the drink. Instead, he set it down on the table in front of him.

Seeing him not drink it, Xiao Yu felt a pang of disappointment.

“Alright, my first question is: if you see someone and can’t help but feel your heart race, what does that mean?” 

“Uh... Isn’t that a heart condition?” Xiao Tian blurted out without thinking.

“...No, it’s not a heart condition or any kind of illness. You’re perfectly healthy,” Zhao Min replied, somewhat exasperated.

Xiao Yao covered her mouth and giggled. “May I ask, is it because when you’re not seeing that person, she’s constantly on your mind? Like you’re always wondering what she’s up to?”

“Exactly!” Zhao Min said, his mood lifting.

“That means you’ve got a crush on her!” Xiao Yao said playfully.

“How… how could that be?” Zhao Min exclaimed, shocked.

“Don’t be scared; if you like her, just go after her. While you’re still young, if you wait too long, she might run off with someone else, and you’ll regret it,” Xiao Yao teased.

Zhao Min pulled out a stack of hundreds from his wallet and handed it to Xiao Yao. “This should be around four thousand. Consider it payment for answering my questions and a tip.”

He paused for a moment. “You all can leave now.”

Xiao Yao accepted the money, a bit confused, but obediently led the others away.

Xiao Yu followed them, somewhat absent-minded. 

As she reached the door, she caught a glimpse of Zhao Min, lost in thought, finishing the drink she poured for him. 

Her eyes lit up as she walked for about half a minute before saying, “Oh no, Yao Jie! I think I ate something wrong; my stomach hurts a bit. You guys go ahead.”

Bending over and clutching her stomach, she looked pained.

“Do you need us to take you to the hospital?” Xiao Tian asked with concern.

“No, no, I just need to visit the restroom,” Xiao Yu said dismissively. 

What a joke! If she went to the hospital, how would she... 

“Well, okay. If you need anything, just let us know,” Xiao Tian said.

“Sure, sure!” 

Then, she quickly headed towards the restroom.

Xiao Yao could tell she was faking it, but she couldn’t figure out why Xiao Yu would pretend to have a stomach ache. Perhaps she was plotting something? 

Forget it. 

“Yao Jie, why do you think Xiao Yu suddenly ate something wrong?” Xiao Tian asked, completely oblivious to the ruse.

“She probably mistakenly swallowed a calculator or something,” Xiao Yao replied nonchalantly.

But seeing Xiao Tian’s innocent look, she shook her head and turned to leave.

“A calculator? But Yao Jie is always right!” 

Once she walked away, Xiao Tian hurried to catch up.
