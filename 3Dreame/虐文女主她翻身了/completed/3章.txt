**The Return of the White Moonlight**

In the Lu Corporation, Lu Xiuming sat in a state of frustration, trying to comprehend why Yan Xinfei had suddenly changed her attitude toward him. The people in their circle all knew that Yan Xinfei would go to great lengths to please Lu Xiuming; it was evident to anyone that she had feelings for him.

It wasn't an exaggeration to say that if Lu Xiuming asked for the stars, Yan Xinfei would find a way to get them for him. If he wanted the moon, she’d get him that too. Yet, despite her unwavering affection, Lu Xiuming couldn't bring himself to reciprocate her feelings. In fact, he found her advances rather off-putting. 

People in their social circle often looked down on Yan Xinfei's behavior towards Lu Xiuming, given her wealth and status. With her resources, she could have any handsome man she desired. Besides, her looks were top-notch within their community—she was beautiful and capable. 

What baffled everyone was her fixation on someone who clearly did not return her affection. Despite this, many envied Lu Xiuming, as he was connected to the Yan family, a powerful lineage. 

Calling for his secretary, Lu Xiuming instructed them to investigate what had happened recently with Yan Xinfei. However, when he reviewed the findings on her life and work, he found nothing had changed; her life was as it always was. 

Confused, he asked his secretary why Yan Xinfei had undergone such a drastic shift. With a disdainful look, the secretary replied, "Could it be that she’s playing hard to get? After all, her feelings for you are well-known in our circle. How can she just stop liking you? Why not ignore her for a few days, President?"

Nodding, Lu Xiuming agreed with his secretary's assessment. A smirk crept onto his face as he said, "If that's the case, then I'll wait for Yan Xinfei to come to me. When she does, I’ll make sure to double the humiliation she’s put me through today. By the way, how’s Qingzhi doing lately?"

Mentioning Qingzhi softened his tone considerably. 

The secretary handed Lu Xiuming a file. "Miss Wen has completed her studies and will be returning to the country soon, likely next Wednesday." 

Lu Xiuming opened the file, revealing several photos of his so-called "White Moonlight." The girl in the pictures, Wen Qingzhi, appeared pure and gentle, dressed elegantly and looking harmless. While she might not be classically beautiful, her delicate features were captivating, and her eyes often glistened with a hint of vulnerability, evoking a sense of longing.

A closer look at Wen Qingzhi’s eyes revealed a slight resemblance to Yan Xinfei's, yet Yan Xinfei’s gaze was commanding and alluring. The two women represented different types of beauty: one was fierce and assertive, while the other was soft and demure. 

For reasons unknown, Lu Xiuming stubbornly insisted that Yan Xinfei and Wen Qingzhi bore some similarities. 

"Good, she’s finally coming back. Arrange for a pickup; I’ll go to the airport to welcome her next Wednesday." 

The mere thought of Qingzhi made Lu Xiuming forget his anger toward Yan Xinfei. After all, Wen Qingzhi was his White Moonlight, his first love. They had been together for three years until she decided to study abroad to further her career. 

She had insisted that it was a necessary step for her to grow and that once she completed her studies, they could stand side by side without his mother opposing their relationship. So when she suggested they break up, Lu Xiuming had felt a mix of anger and helplessness. He had cared for her deeply, understood her ambitions, and promised he would wait for her.

Now, all of that was about to pay off, and this time he wouldn’t let her go again.
