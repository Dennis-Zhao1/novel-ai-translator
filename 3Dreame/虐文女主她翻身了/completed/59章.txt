**Chapter Fifty-Nine: Seeing the Blister on His Hand**

As Yu Zhu Yi pressed the elevator button, she sent a message to her sister.  
【Cutie】: Sis, I've arrived at your company and I'm taking the elevator up!  
【Sister】: Okay!  

Shortly after, Yan Xin Fei called Assistant Liu, instructing her to wait by the top floor elevator to bring Yu Zhu Yi over. Liu Lin felt a rush of excitement; she had seen the messages in their group chat. She knew a guy was coming to see the president today, and now she had the chance to witness firsthand who this mysterious young man was.

Assistant Liu walked briskly toward the top floor elevator, her heart racing as she anticipated the meeting. Finally, with a cheerful "ding," the elevator doors slid open. 

Out stepped a young man who looked like he was barely in his twenties. He stood over six feet tall, with striking features that exuded a charmingly youthful aura, reminiscent of the trendy "little puppy" style that was so popular these days. 

Liu Lin couldn’t help but think, *So the president likes younger guys, huh? And this one even brought a lunch box—he must be here to deliver lunch to the president. How sweet! But is it a bit too much?*

Not wanting to waste time, she approached Yu Zhu Yi as he exited the elevator. "Hi there! Are you the guy the president mentioned? She asked me to take you to her office."

Yu Zhu Yi recognized her as Yan Xin Fei's assistant and nodded, following her closely. A few minutes later, Liu Lin led him to the door of Yan Xin Fei's office. She paused outside, turned to him, and said, "The president wants you to go in by yourself."

With that, she returned to her own desk. Although she wished she could stay to see how the president interacted with this young man, she knew better than to intrude. After all, the president was not just her idol; she was also her boss, and Liu Lin didn't want to overstep her boundaries.

Once back at her desk, she quickly pulled out her phone to update the group chat.  
【President's Assistant — Liu Lin】: I just personally escorted the president's new boyfriend to her office. He’s pretty handsome, I guess he’s a decent match for our president.  

After sending the message, she ignored the ensuing chaos in the chat and focused on her work.

Yu Zhu Yi knocked on the door and waited for his sister's voice to beckon him inside before he pushed the door open. The moment he entered, he found Yan Xin Fei seriously engrossed in her work, poring over documents spread across her desk.

Without looking up, she instructed, "Go sit on the sofa for a bit; I'll be done shortly." 

Yu Zhu Yi complied and settled himself on the sofa. He placed the insulated lunch box on the table in front of him and began to take in his sister's office. It was decorated in cool tones, with a sofa, a desk, and a green potted plant that added a hint of life to the otherwise professional setting. Piles of company files cluttered one side, and he noticed a door that probably led to a break room.

Sitting there, Yu Zhu Yi didn’t feel bored at all. Instead, he stole glances at Yan Xin Fei, admiring how focused and beautiful she looked while working. *My sister is so stunning! She shines even brighter when she’s serious. People who put their heart into their work really do sparkle.*

Sensing his gaze, Yan Xin Fei quickly wrapped up a few tasks and looked up at him. When their eyes met, Yu Zhu Yi felt a jolt of panic and quickly diverted his gaze.

With a teasing smile, Yan Xin Fei asked, "Do you think I'm pretty?"

Yu Zhu Yi stammered, "Y-yeah... you look amazing, Sis."

Then, suddenly reminded of the lunch he had prepared, he exclaimed, "Sis, I made you lunch! Come eat!"

Yan Xin Fei raised an eyebrow in surprise. "You made it? But I thought you couldn't cook?"

Feeling a bit shy, Yu Zhu Yi replied, "I just learned today! Come on, give it a try."

She stood up and walked over, settling onto the sofa beside him. As she did, she noticed a blister forming on his hand and immediately took it in her own, a hint of concern in her voice. "How careless! You burned yourself while cooking? Does it hurt?"

Yu Zhu Yi hadn’t even noticed until she mentioned it. He had gotten a blister while cooking, and just as he was about to downplay it—saying it didn’t hurt at all—he caught the worried look in her eyes. A mischievous thought crossed his mind, and he feigned pain. "Sis, it really hurts! You have to kiss it better!"

Though he was joking, he couldn't help but feel a flicker of hope.

Without missing a beat, Yan Xin Fei leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss on his hand. 

Yu Zhu Yi felt warmth wash over him, a tingling sensation in his hand. He almost pulled away but found that she held on tightly, not letting him escape.

"Stop fooling around; I’ll get the first-aid kit to take care of this," she said in a serious tone, not waiting for his response as she got up to fetch it.

Yan Xin Fei rummaged through the office until she found an old first-aid kit and returned, sitting next to him once more to treat his blister. As she examined his delicate skin, she was struck by how unsightly the blister looked, her heart aching for him. 

At that moment, Yu Zhu Yi let out a soft gasp. "Sis, that hurts!"

"See? I told you to be careful while cooking. Pain is a good reminder. Next time, don’t go into the kitchen; I can’t stand seeing you hurt," she chided gently.

Hearing her words made Yu Zhu Yi blush slightly as he nodded.

Once she finished dressing the wound, he opened the lunch box and placed it in front of her. "Sis, try it while it’s still hot! Let me know how it is!" His eyes sparkled with anticipation as he watched her.

Yan Xin Fei glanced at the braised pork ribs that looked decent enough; she was uncertain about the taste. Hesitantly, she picked up a piece and chewed thoughtfully, her expression unreadable.

Yu Zhu Yi, sitting beside her, grew anxious. "So? How is it? Is it good?"

Yan Xin Fei nodded slowly, taking another piece. 

Seeing her nod and continue eating, Yu Zhu Yi's heart soared. Even though his sister maintained a poker face, the fact that she was eating with such enthusiasm meant it had to be good, right? 

Encouraged, he kept urging her to eat more. 

Yan Xin Fei, enjoying the rice and ribs he had prepared, quickly polished off her meal. It was only after she finished that she finally set her chopsticks down.
