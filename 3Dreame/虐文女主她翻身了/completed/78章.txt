It turned out to be her.

Yuzhu Yi was eager to ask what had really happened between them. 

The old man immediately turned to Yan Xinfei and asked, “I forgot to ask you earlier, what’s your name? What do you do for a living? How many people are in your family?”

“Yan Xinfei, CEO of the Yan Corporation.” She paused for a moment before adding, “I live alone.”

Yan Xinfei answered each of the old man’s questions one by one.

The old man continued, “A few days ago, didn’t you perform first aid on an elderly person during a flight?”

Yan Xinfei felt a bit puzzled; she didn’t understand why he was asking such questions.

“Yes, that’s true,” she replied.

“Can I ask why you chose to help that elderly man? Weren’t you scared?” He thought that performing first aid in public could lead to trouble.

“There’s nothing to be afraid of. I have some medical knowledge, and when I encounter a patient, I feel it’s my duty to help. That’s the essence of being a medical professional.”

The old man nodded in approval, his face lighting up with appreciation. “Well said! You truly embody the principle of a medical professional: to help those in need. It’s clear that Yuzhu has good taste. To be honest, the elderly man you helped on that plane was me. If you hadn’t come to my aid, the doctors said the outcome could have been dire. You are my savior.”

“I don’t deserve the title. I just happened to be there. I would have done the same for anyone,” Yan Xinfei said simply, believing wholeheartedly in her statement.

Everyone present thought of Yan Xinfei as compassionate and kind-hearted, further increasing their admiration for her.

Before long, Uncle and Aunt arrived.

At the door appeared a middle-aged man in his forties and a heavily made-up woman. Just one glance revealed their shrewdness and cunning, making them quite off-putting.

The woman, swaying her hips and using a shrill voice, shouted from a distance, “Grandpa, why do I have to come all this way to eat with you?”

Her tone was full of complaints.

The man beside her wore a look of impatience.

Indeed, the adorable Uncle was named Yu Boming, and his father was Yu Bochuan. 

The meanings behind their names were quite admirable. 

The character “博” (Bo) signifies wisdom and knowledge. 
“川” (Chuan) conveys beauty and grandeur. 
“明” (Ming) implies brightness and clarity. 

Unfortunately, the younger son, Yu Bochuan, was indeed gifted and knowledgeable, capable of handling significant responsibilities at a young age, yet he often felt distant and emotionally disconnected from the family.

Compared to his younger brother, the elder son, Yu Boming, seemed to fall short. Perhaps because he sensed the gap between himself and his brother, he had become increasingly rebellious and reckless since high school.

In recent years, his actions had frustrated the old man and disappointed the rest of the family.

Hearing the woman’s complaint, the old man’s anger flared up, and he shouted at his elder son, “What? Is it too much to ask for you to come back to the old house for a meal? I’m still alive, and you don’t even respect me anymore?”

Yu Boming, sensing his father’s anger, hastily grabbed the woman beside him, warning her not to provoke the old man further. 

It wasn’t that he was afraid of his father’s wrath; rather, he was more concerned about the repercussions of angering him, especially regarding his stake in the family business—something Yu Boming could never allow.

He then carefully said to the old man, “Grandpa, don’t misunderstand. Ziqiao didn’t mean anything by it. It’s a great honor for us to come back to the old house for a meal.”

The old man snorted coldly, choosing not to respond, while Yu Boming awkwardly smiled.

At that moment, the younger son, Yu Bochuan, arrived.

Yu Bochuan appeared to be a man in his thirties, sharing a striking resemblance with the adorable boy, unmistakably father and son. 

He was impeccably dressed in an expensive suit, his hair neatly slicked back, and wearing gold-rimmed glasses, exuding an aura of sophistication and elegance.

Upon entering the hall, he greeted the old man and Uncle Zhang, then Yu Boming, and finally Yuzhu Yi.

Yuzhu Yi showed no special reaction upon seeing Yu Bochuan, merely responding to him with indifference.

“Xiao Yi, how have you been lately? How’s the company doing?” 

“Everything’s great,” she replied.

Yu Bochuan showed no reaction to Yuzhu Yi’s cold demeanor, turning to glance at Yan Xinfei beside her.

Their conversation felt almost mechanical, as if they were merely going through the motions.

Yuzhu Yi took the initiative to introduce Yan Xinfei to Yu Bochuan, “This is my girlfriend. Sister, this is my father.”

The last part was clearly directed at Yan Xinfei.

Yu Bochuan was surprised that his son would take the initiative to introduce this woman to him, realizing that Yuzhu Yi must hold her in high regard. After all, throughout his life, Yuzhu Yi had always been aloof and indifferent to everyone except his wife and the old man.

Curiosity piqued, Yu Bochuan wondered what kind of woman could thaw his son’s icy demeanor.

Yan Xinfei politely greeted him, “Hello, Uncle.”

Yu Bochuan chuckled at this, watching his son’s anxious reaction, expecting Yan Xinfei to address him as “Dad.”

However, looking at Yan Xinfei's face, he felt a sense of familiarity.

Unable to resist, he asked, “What’s your name?”

“Yan Xinfei.”

Upon hearing the name, he felt it rang a bell, but he couldn’t place where he had heard it before.

Standing quietly beside them, Mo Ziqiao couldn’t help but interject, “Oh, I knew someone had hooked up with our nephew! Turns out it’s Yan Xinfei, the one who used to follow that guy around every day!”

Yu Bochuan regarded her with confusion, asking, “What do you mean by that?”

“What else could it mean? It’s just that some person was following that guy Lu Xiuming around like a lost puppy! Everyone in the circle knows that Yan Xinfei had a crush on Lu Xiuming!” Mo Ziqiao’s tone dripped with malicious glee. “Oh, you busy man, I guess you wouldn’t know, huh? But it’s not surprising; after all, you’re not often free to care about such matters!”

Yu Bochuan’s face darkened at her words, and he snapped, “Stop talking nonsense! The girl hasn’t said anything!”

While he spoke sternly, who knows what he was thinking inside?

Yuzhu Yi felt his aunt’s hurtful words hit her like a slap, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment as she reached out to hold Yan Xinfei’s hand, silently offering comfort.

She then retorted loudly, “Aunt, are your ears and brain not working? You believe everything you hear! How could my sister possibly like that scum? You seem overly concerned with this matter; could it be that you fancy Lu Xiuming yourself?”

With that, he pretended to look shocked at Mo Ziqiao.

Mo Ziqiao’s face twisted in anger at Yuzhu Yi’s words. “What are you saying? You—”

Before she could finish, the old man interrupted her.

“Enough! What’s all this shouting about? Yan Xinfei isn’t just the CEO of the Yan Corporation and the head of the Yan family; she’s also my lifesaver! You shouldn’t be gossiping here! And as elders, you should have some decorum when the younger generation brings their girlfriend back!”

His booming voice echoed through the hall.

Mo Ziqiao suddenly felt as if someone had clamped a hand around her throat, her face turning red and then pale as she lowered her head, too intimidated to speak.

Yu Boming stood silently beside her, not daring to challenge the old man’s authority, though a fierce expression flitted across his face.

Yan Xinfei remained silent throughout, feeling no need to explain herself, but now...

“Grandpa, let me clarify something. I’ve never liked anyone before, and now and in the future, I will only love Yuzhu.” She said confidently.

Hearing this, the old man nodded in satisfaction.

Yu Bochuan visibly relaxed, having known of the previous rumors himself.

Yuzhu Yi felt his cheeks heat up; after all, his sister really did like him!

“Alright, alright! Uncle Zhang, go tell the kitchen to bring out dinner. It’s time for us to eat in the living room.”
