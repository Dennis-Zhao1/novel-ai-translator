**Chapter 63: She’s Just a Gopher**

Of course, there were quite a few people who pulled out their phones, eager to sneak a photo and share their gossip about the fierce female CEO and her cute sidekick. However, despite their attempts at being discreet, Yan Xinfei had a keen sense of awareness.

Just as they pressed the shutter buttons on their phones, she caught wind of their intentions. Telling her adorable companion to wait in place, she strode over to the group of sneaky photographers.

In her mind, one of the girls was internally screaming like a gopher: "Ahhhh! The fierce-looking sister is walking towards me!" But soon enough, confusion set in—why was she coming over? Oh, maybe she was just looking for someone.

When Yan Xinfei reached her, the girl was visibly flustered. She struggled to contain her starry-eyed grin and shyly asked, "Is something wrong, sister?"

The cool, composed woman in front of her replied in a husky voice, "Could you please delete the photo you just took of us? My boyfriend doesn’t like it when too many people stare at him."

The girl thought, "Her voice is so beautiful! It really does have the power to make one's heart flutter." Stammering slightly, she managed to say, "O-okay…" Then, realizing the implications of her actions, she quickly added, "I’m so sorry, sister! I didn’t mean to! I just couldn’t help myself because you look so fierce!"

"It’s alright." 

Once the girl deleted the photos, Yan Xinfei returned to her cute companion, leaving the girl in a daze as she watched Yan Xinfei walk away. It took her a moment to process everything that happened. "I was just so mesmerized by her stunning beauty that I forgot to ask for her contact information!" 

Even though Yan Xinfei had returned to her boyfriend's side, she hesitated to approach them for a number. After all, it felt a bit rude to interrupt a couple in the middle of their date. With a sigh of regret, she let the opportunity slip away.

Upon Yan Xinfei’s return, Yu Zhuo asked with concern, "Sister, is everything okay?"

"Yeah, it’s nothing serious. Just someone took our picture, but don’t worry—I had her delete it."

"Oh, so that’s it."

Relieved, Yu Zhuo happily munched on the snacks he was holding. 

Half an hour later, they had wandered from one end of the food street to the other. With just a few hours left, Yu Zhuo intended to try every last delicacy. However, after patting his bulging belly, he felt a bit uncomfortable and realized he couldn’t eat anymore, yet he was reluctant to stop.

Turning around, he tugged at his sister's shirt, playfully pouting, "Sister, I can’t eat anymore."

"Then should we go?" Yan Xinfei asked, puzzled.

"No, I still haven’t finished!" Yu Zhuo protested with a frown.

Yan Xinfei thought for a moment and suggested, "How about we get some packed to take home for later?"

Hearing this, Yu Zhuo’s face brightened again. "That sounds great! But right now, my stomach feels so stuffed!"

Yan Xinfei took his hand and led him back to the car, where she settled him into the passenger seat. Gently, she began massaging his tummy.

Yu Zhuo let out a soft hum, his expression one of pure contentment, like a pampered little kitten, happily snuggled after a hearty meal.

While soothing him, Yan Xinfei fished out her phone with one hand and sent a message to her assistant. 

**[CEO]: Can you come here and pack some snacks for me? The last few stalls at the food street.**

After sending the message, she followed up with the address.

Liu Lin, the assistant, was momentarily stunned upon receiving the request. “Wait, the CEO wants me to go there to pack snacks? If I remember correctly, she’s never eaten at those stalls since I started working here.” 

It was clear—this was for the CEO’s little boyfriend. 

"Ah, love really does change a person," she thought with a smirk.

**[Assistant Liu]: Got it, CEO.**

With a resigned sigh, she headed to the address provided by her boss to buy the snacks and deliver them.

Yan Xinfei asked her cute companion, “Should I take you home now?”

"Okay! But what about my snacks?" Yu Zhuo inquired, looking concerned.

"I had Assistant Liu go buy them for you and bring them to your house."

Yan Xinfei sent another message to her assistant.

**[CEO]: Please deliver the snacks to this address.**

**[Assistant Liu]: Understood, CEO.**

Continuing to massage Yu Zhuo’s belly until he felt better, Yan Xinfei eventually drove him home. 

While on the road, she spotted a pharmacy and parked the car. She dashed inside to buy a box of digestive tablets and handed them to Yu Zhuo. 

With some bottled water available in the car, she opened it for him.

After taking the tablets, Yu Zhuo felt considerably better. Once they reached his home, Yan Xinfei kissed him for a few minutes, reminding him to get to bed early and take care of himself before she departed.
