**Chapter 92: Stunning Everyone**

Lu Qiuming held Wen Qingzhi in his arms as he walked to the center of the banquet. He had just exchanged greetings with a partner who frequently collaborated with his company when he heard a chorus of gasps around him.

Confused, Lu Qiuming glanced around, wondering who could possibly evoke such a reaction from so many people. Before he turned fully, he initially thought it might be some dignitary entering the room. The thought of potentially ingratiating himself with a powerful figure, and the possibilities that could come with that, flickered through his mind.

But when he finally turned to see the entrance of the banquet hall, the smile on his face faltered. 

No way. How could it possibly be her?

Yan Xinfey stepped through the doors, adorned in a stunning blue starry gown that hugged her curves perfectly, accentuating her alluring collarbone. A matching blue starry necklace hung delicately around her neck, the contrast of her fair skin against the deep blue of the gown creating a breathtaking visual. 

Even with a stoic expression, her beauty radiated like a siren in the night, captivating everyone around her. 

To describe her in sixteen characters: "As graceful as floating clouds, as fierce as a startled dragon. A face like smooth cream, eyes like polished lacquer."

Beside her stood Yu Zhuyi, clad in a blue suit that complemented Yan Xinfey’s attire. Under the glimmering lights, he appeared as an otherworldly prince, embodying a mix of maturity and youthfulness. His noble aura made hearts race, igniting a frenzy of admiration among the guests.

This dazzling pair had left everyone in attendance speechless.

Indeed, the source of their astonishment was Yan Xinfey and Yu Zhuyi.

Their surprise stemmed not only from Yan Xinfey bringing a male companion but also from the undeniable intimacy shared between the two. They had previously heard rumors of Yan Xinfey's infatuation with Lu Qiuming, and when those whispers first surfaced, many had been skeptical. After all, Yan Xinfey was a name spoken of with reverence by the elite families in the capital.

Despite her young age, she had achieved remarkable feats, leaving them feeling envious of her accomplishments. 

In their eyes, Lu Qiuming was merely an ordinary man; how could someone like him ever capture Yan Xinfey’s attention?

Yet now, it seemed clear that Yan Xinfey’s affections did not lie with Lu Qiuming at all, but rather with the man beside her.

Lu Qiuming felt the stares of the crowd boring into him, filled with judgment and speculation. He couldn’t help but feel a surge of anxiety and anger. 

These people were nothing but opportunistic sycophants. When they learned of his connection with Yan Xinfey, they had fawned over him. But now…

The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. He clenched his fist, forgetting that he was still holding Wen Qingzhi’s hand. His sudden grip made her gasp softly.

That sound snapped Lu Qiuming back to reality, and he quickly released his hold. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt you,” he said gently.

Wen Qingzhi suppressed her irritation and smiled, “It’s okay, Qiuming brother. I know it must be hard for you to see Sister Xinfey here with a guy, especially since they seem so close. You must be feeling upset.”

Lu Qiuming thought to himself: At least this person understands me and is considerate, unlike…

“I’m not upset. What does Yan Xinfey’s business have to do with me?” he replied, a hint of indignation in his tone.

“But Sister Xinfey liked you so much before; how could she change her mind so quickly? It can’t be…” Wen Qingzhi teased, her voice dripping with implications.

At her words, Lu Qiuming's anger flared even more, his eyes blazing with irritation.

Wen Qingzhi noticed his anger and felt a swell of satisfaction. 

Hmph! Let’s see how you try to compete with me!!!
