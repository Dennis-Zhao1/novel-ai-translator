**Chapter 44: The Fans Are Going Crazy**

The next morning, at seven o'clock sharp, Yvette Chen woke up following her usual biological clock. 

She quickly washed up and headed downstairs. To her surprise, she was the first one to arrive. 

In the dining area, the director was already waiting for her with a cheerful smile. “Not bad, not bad! You’re up early and didn’t sleep in. By the way, breakfast will be served according to when you wake up. You can go and grab the breakfast that the staff has prepared for you, and of course, take whatever you like and as much as you want.” 

Oh, so the director had set a little trap early this morning! Those who woke up early would enjoy the breakfast bought by the crew, while the ones who slept in would have to settle for whatever was left. If nothing was left, they might end up with nothing at all. 

Thinking of this, Yvette couldn't help but feel a twinge of sympathy for the others, silently wishing them good luck. With that, she happily went to feast on the breakfast waiting for her.

Just as Yvette was almost finished, the second person finally came down—none other than Lily Xu. Who would have thought that after getting completely wasted last night, Lily would be the second to wake up today?

Rubbing her head a little groggily, Lily lumbered over. “Good morning, Yvette! How come you’re up so early?” 

“Morning! I’m just used to it. The staff bought breakfast, come eat!” 

“Don’t we have to wait for the others?” Lily asked, a puzzled expression on her face. 

“Nope!” 

“Wait a minute, could it be…” Lily said with a gleeful smirk. 

“Yeah, it’s exactly what you’re thinking.” 

Lily’s eyes lit up with relief. “Thank goodness I woke up early, or I wouldn’t have had breakfast at all! The director is definitely a trickster!” 

“The director said we can head upstairs to pack after we finish eating.” 

Seeing that Yvette was nearly done, Lily stuffed her mouth with food, saying, “Wait for me! I’ll be done in a sec, then we can go up together.” 

“No rush, take your time,” Yvette replied. While Lily devoured her bread, she quickly finished her milk. 

“Alright! I’m ready, Yvette!” 

The two of them headed upstairs together. 

“Yvette, were you the one who helped me back to my room last night?” 

“Yeah.” 

“Did I do anything embarrassing?” 

“Hmm... not really, just that you all danced like wildlings the entire night.” 

“!!!!!! Ahhh, did anyone see?” Lily asked, her eyes wide with anticipation. 

“Not really; it was just the few of us there.” 

“Phew, that’s a relief! You scared me to death!” She patted her chest in relief. 

“But now, quite a few people probably know about it,” Yvette said with a smile, gesturing to the already active camera. 

“Ahhh, you guys didn’t hear anything, right? You didn’t hear anything!” Lily said dramatically to the camera, her expression one of utter despair. 

By the time they reached the second floor, they each retreated to their rooms to start packing their things. 

The live-stream viewers were having a field day. 

**[Dreamy☆Angel]:** Waking up early to see Yvette’s stunning face is the best!  
**[Reaching for the Stars]:** Yvette didn’t even put on makeup!  
**[Dancing for Who]:** Yvette looks so serene without makeup; she’s beautiful!  
**[Lost Fish in Deep Sea]:** Of course, even a fairy looks good without makeup; I wish I could say the same for myself…  
**[Global Girl Boss]:** I’m dying of laughter...  
**[Gentler than Your Mom]:** The director set a trap early this morning for them to jump into.  
**[Still Cute as Ever]:** I can see Lily’s despairing expression!  
**[Foggy Love Eyes]:** Poor girl.  
**[Plum Blossoms on Clear Water]:** Lily: If nobody knew, I could have kept it a secret! Now everyone knows, all because I had to ask.  
**[Mushroom-Picking Cutie]:** Yvette: Not my fault, you silly goose!  
**[If You Don’t Cherish Me, I Won’t Love You]:** ||o(*°▽°*)o|Ю  
**[Returning to Fairytales]:** I’ve learned my lesson; I should keep my mouth shut next time.  
**[Ice Girl]:** Same here.  

As time passed, the others began to wake up and come downstairs for breakfast. Some early risers were enjoying their favorite meals, while Wen Qingzhi was the last one to come down. By that time, only a few fried dough sticks remained on the table—all the other food had been devoured. 

In fact, those dough sticks were left specifically for Wen Qingzhi by the staff, who noticed she hadn’t come down for breakfast. Other artists thought they were the last ones, so they cleaned up the spread. 

Seeing only a few sticks left, Wen Qingzhi couldn’t help but complain, but unfortunately, nobody paid her any mind.
