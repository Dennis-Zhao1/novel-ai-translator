But thinking of collaborating with President Xu's company, he managed to suppress the anger boiling inside him. Or at least, he thought he had.

“What did you discuss with President Xu just now, Yan Xinfei?” Lu Qiuming asked in a sharp tone, his eyes narrowing with suspicion.

Yan Xinfei couldn’t help but think that Lu Qiuming must have lost his mind. Why else would he ask such a ridiculous question? She didn’t even spare him a glance, fully focused on the adorable little creature in front of her.

Lu Qiuming felt a flicker of irritation. Was he being ignored right now? 

Wen Qingzhi, witnessing the scene, felt a wave of anxiety crash over her. She could still recall the way Lu Qiuming had looked at Yan Xinfei earlier, utterly captivated, as though her presence had stolen the very air from his lungs. If he was still getting opportunities to collaborate with President Xu through her, what would that mean for her?

With a shocked expression, she spoke up, “Brother Qiuming, you don’t think Xinfei and President Xu…”

She trailed off, her unfinished thought hanging in the air, enticing curiosity and speculation.

Yan Xinfei felt that anyone with even a hint of common sense could see that President Xu’s displeasure stemmed from Wen Qingzhi’s earlier actions—completely disregarding others before she learned of Xu Xiaoxiao’s true identity, only to try to ingratiate herself with her after discovering who she was.

Yet, there would always be those who lacked common sense. And here stood the male lead, believing Wen Qingzhi's words were worth considering.

Just as expected, Lu Qiuming's expression darkened, his face turning an even deeper shade of anger. “Yan Xinfei, you’re something else! If you can’t have me, you want to ruin me—”

Yan Xinfei shot him a cold glance, not rushing to retort. After all, what was the point? It was like a dog biting your leg; you couldn’t just bite back, could you?

Seeing her lack of immediate rebuttal, Lu Qiuming became increasingly animated, as if he had found some kind of leverage against her. Beside them, Yu Zhuo couldn’t hold back any longer; she had never encountered someone so brazen.

“Are you out of your mind? Xinfei has already said it has nothing to do with you, yet here you are barking like a dog in front of others! It’s disgusting!” 

Yu Zhuo exclaimed, her bright eyes sparkling as she looked at Yan Xinfei, seeking approval.

Yan Xinfei couldn’t help but laugh. “You’re so good, well done!” 

Upon hearing his sister’s praise, Yu Zhuo beamed even more brightly.

Meanwhile, Lu Qiuming was fuming, especially after this little brat had the audacity to call him a dog. He pointed at Yu Zhuo, glaring at Yan Xinfei. “Is this who you’re associating with?” His tone dripped with disdain.

Yan Xinfei could easily catch the contempt in his voice, and her smile faded. “What does it matter who he is to you, Mr. Lu? Are you dreaming at night or something? How else could you come up with such unrealistic ideas? Do I owe you an explanation about my collaboration with President Xu?”

As she continued, she caught sight of Wen Qingzhi standing next to Lu Qiuming. “You should really keep an eye on the women around you. Otherwise, if you provoke someone you shouldn’t, it’ll be her…”

Without waiting for their reactions, she took the adorable little creature by the hand and stepped away from the banquet.

Lu Qiuming’s eyes flashed with rage, his gaze fixed on her retreating figure like a wildfire. 

Those around them had also noticed the tension brewing, casting subtle glances at Lu Qiuming, their expressions a mix of curiosity and intrigue.

Wen Qingzhi felt a wave of embarrassment wash over her as she stood beside him. Yet, she gently tugged at his sleeve. “Brother Qiuming, don’t be angry. It’s not worth it to upset yourself; I’ll worry about you.” 

Hearing her concern, Lu Qiuming snapped back to reality. He noticed the gazes of those around them, gripping her hand tightly as he hurriedly led her away from the scene.
