The doctor finished speaking and left, leaving Zhao Min lying on the hospital bed. Hearing that there was nothing seriously wrong, he finally relaxed, like a tightly wound spring that had been set free. 

He felt a mix of anger and fear. He was angry at Zhao Min for his reckless behavior, but he was also terrified that something might truly happen during the night. After all, he had guarded this treasure for so many years, and it had almost slipped away from him...

At that moment, he made a silent vow to always stay close to Zhao Min from now on.

Looking at Zhao Min, who was peacefully asleep, a mischievous thought flashed through his mind. He couldn’t help but admire Zhao Min’s rosy lips, feeling a sudden heat rise within him. His mouth went dry, and before he knew it, he found himself leaning in, gently stroking Zhao Min’s lips until they turned a deep crimson, as if they might bleed.

Suddenly, he bent down and lightly pressed his lips against Zhao Min's forehead, then his brows, cheek, and finally, his lips. Zhao Min, half-awake, felt an odd sensation, like a small puppy licking his face, finally landing on his lips, stealing his breath away.

Unable to hold back, Zhao Min let out a soft, “Mmm—” and turned his head to evade the unexpected kiss. Seeing Zhao Min's rejecting gesture, Chao Yixiu couldn't help but chuckle softly. 

He decided not to tease him any further and left Zhao Min’s lips alone. Satisfied, he licked his own lips, then slipped off his shoes and snugly wrapped his arms around Zhao Min, settling down to sleep beside him. 

The bed was meant for one, so there was some space left, but the two of them had to huddle closely together to fit. Holding the person he had longed for, Chao Yixiu fell asleep, still tightly embracing Zhao Min. Even in slumber, a smile lingered at the corners of his mouth, unmistakably happy—as if he had finally claimed a treasure he had coveted for so long.

Morning sunlight peeked shyly from behind the clouds, like a bashful girl revealing her rosy cheeks. Soon after, she grew bold, stepping fully into view and dancing among the leaves. The golden sunlight streamed through the window, casting warm patches on the floor.

The person sleeping in the bed stirred, their fan-like eyelashes fluttering. Zhao Min felt as if a large dog was hugging him, making it hard for him to breathe, which caused him to frown slightly. Something felt off.

In the next moment, he lazily opened his eyes and tilted his head. When he saw the person beside him, his eyes widened in shock. Wasn't he drinking at the bar last night? Then... he remembered seeing Chao Yixiu dressed in women's clothing...

What happened next? He recalled that it was not Chao Yixiu dressed as a woman, but rather...

I almost lost my virginity! Thank goodness he showed up in time.

But what was going on now? Why was he sleeping with his arms around him?

Zhao Min was utterly perplexed.

——————————小剧场——————————
Zhao Min: I can’t believe I’m sharing a bed with you! (◔◡◔)
Chao Yixiu: Don’t worry, I’ll take responsibility.
Zhao Min: Have you been plotting against me all along?
Chao Yixiu: What nonsense are you talking? (◍•ᴗ•◍)
Zhao Min, feeling smug: Oh~ I see, you’ve wanted to make a move on me for a while.
Meanwhile, he thought to himself: I really didn’t see this coming. He’s actually making a pass at his good buddy. But luckily, I’m not losing out here.
Chao Yixiu ignored Zhao Min’s teasing, pinning him down and leaning in to kiss him.
Zhao Min cursed inwardly: You... you’re not playing fair! You’re ambushing me!
