### Chapter 67: Who Knew You Could Choke on Soy Milk

As Yu Zhuyi was finishing his breakfast, Yan Xinfang had already cleared her plate. She quietly watched the adorable figure across from her, who was absentmindedly nibbling at his food. 

Sigh. Just as expected, the little darling was indeed a little darling—so delicate and dainty, taking his sweet time with each bite. Yan Xinfang observed him as he sat there, head bowed, his plate of bread completely empty, yet he still lingered over the now-empty dish, lost in thought.

She couldn’t help but smile, finding it amusing that he seemed completely oblivious to his surroundings. Yu Zhuyi continued to eat his breakfast, his mind drifting back to the earlier moments, replaying the sensations from before. 

His plate was empty, yet he remained unaware. Yan Xinfang couldn’t watch any longer and decided to gently prompt him. 

“Hey, little darling, what are you thinking about?”

“Huh? What? Did you say something, sis?” Yu Zhuyi looked up at her, confused. 

Yan Xinfang gestured toward his empty plate, and upon realizing, Yu Zhuyi felt a wave of embarrassment wash over him. He wished he could dig a hole and hide in it. How had he managed to finish his breakfast without even realizing it? Now he was sitting in front of an empty plate, feeling utterly flustered.

His face flushed as he quickly reached for the soy milk beside him to take a sip. In his rush, he accidentally choked on it.

“Cough, cough, cough…” His face turned a bright shade of red, and he kept coughing uncontrollably.

Seeing him choke on soy milk was hard for Yan Xinfang to take seriously, and she couldn’t help but stifle a laugh. However, she rushed over to pat his back and handed him a glass of warm water.

“Take your time, little darling,” she said, her tone gentle and concerned. “Drink slowly; don’t rush it, or it can affect your breathing.”

After a few moments and several sips of warm water, Yu Zhuyi finally started to feel better. 

“How are you feeling now? Any discomfort?” Yan Xinfang asked with a hint of worry in her voice.

“I’m fine now; really, I’m okay,” he assured her.

“Are you sure? Does your throat hurt at all? Maybe we should go see a doctor just in case,” she pressed, recalling a news report she had seen. It was about a child who choked on soy milk, and no one noticed until it was too late, leading to severe bronchial damage and ongoing throat pain that required nebulization treatment. Though the child recovered, it still left lasting effects on their health, which made her particularly anxious about Yu Zhuyi’s situation.

Feeling a bit shy, Yu Zhuyi responded, “Sis, I really am fine. My throat doesn’t hurt at all.”

Yan Xinfang then recounted the news story to him. 

After hearing it, Yu Zhuyi was left in disbelief. He looked at her with a hint of accusation. “But sis, that was a child! I’m 22 now; I’m an adult!”

Yan Xinfang pondered for a moment, considering his logic, but then a thought struck her. 

“Yeah, but you’re an adult who just choked on soy milk!” 

Yu Zhuyi’s ears turned a fiery red, and he glared at her, indignantly calling out, “Sis!” signaling for her to stop.

Seeing his flustered reaction was amusing to Yan Xinfang, but she knew better than to tease him further; she didn’t want to provoke him into actually scratching her, even if she wouldn’t be afraid.

“Alright, alright. But are you sure you don’t want to get checked out? I just can’t help but worry,” she said, her tone softening.

The mention of a doctor only made Yu Zhuyi’s neck flush with embarrassment. 

“No, really, it’s not necessary! I’m fine, sis!” he insisted, his voice buzzing with urgency.

“Okay then,” Yan Xinfang replied with a hint of reluctance, though a fleeting look of disappointment crossed her face.

Yu Zhuyi caught a glimpse of that expression and couldn’t believe his eyes. Did he really see regret on his sister’s face? Surely not—she was just being caring. How could she feel regret?

But he was mistaken in thinking he had misread her expression. Yan Xinfang had indeed felt a moment of regret because she truly wanted Yu Zhuyi to see a doctor, to hear what they might say about choking on soy milk, curious about the underlying causes. After all, some people had a peculiar taste for mischief that manifested in different ways.
