He never expected that…

As Yan Xinfei drove along the road, she noticed her cute little companion looking at her, seemingly hesitating to say something. 

While keeping her eyes on the road, she asked, “What’s up?”

Yu Zhuqi finally mustered the courage to speak, “Sister, what were you and Grandpa talking about in the study just now? Did he make things difficult for you?”

Upon hearing this, Yan Xinfei’s expression turned complicated. How could this little cutie think that way? Did she really seem like someone who could be bullied?

“Oh, it was just some business talk.”

After saying that, she couldn’t help but ask, “Do I look like someone who would let others push me around?”

“That’s good then. Sister, that’s not what I meant! You know how in dramas, couples meet the parents, and then the boyfriend’s mom throws money at the girlfriend to make her leave?”

“What? Am I that short on cash?”

“No…” Yu Zhuqi explained, a bit anxious.

“Alright, I get it.” 

With that, Yan Xinfei decided not to dwell on the matter, focusing instead on driving. She certainly didn’t want to get distracted and cause an accident.

Twenty minutes later, they arrived in front of Yan Xinfei’s apartment. 

After parking, she unbuckled her seatbelt and suddenly leaned over, lifting Yu Zhuqi’s chin with her slightly cold fingers, kissing him urgently.

Yu Zhuqi was taken aback. Why did she suddenly kiss him? 

But soon, he found himself lost in the intensity of her kiss.

It felt like ages before Yan Xinfei finally pulled away. 

“I’ll take you home.”

She said this to the still-breathless Yu Zhuqi. 

He nodded, still dazed, clearly not having processed what had just happened.

It was only when they were almost back to his place that he finally realized. 

He blinked, dumbfounded. “Sister, how come…?”

“I’m taking you home.”

“No, shouldn’t it be the other way around? Why are you the one driving me home?”

Yan Xinfei looked at him quizzically. “Didn’t you just drive me home? What’s wrong with me taking you home now? It’s late, and isn’t it normal for a girlfriend to take her boyfriend home?”

Yu Zhuqi was momentarily speechless. “N-no problem, but Sister, it’s usually the boy who takes the girl home! Where did you hear that it’s the girlfriend’s job to drive the boyfriend?”

“Isn’t it like that? Come on, get out, would you?” 

Yan Xinfei didn’t want to get caught up in this discussion. Should she really tell him that she learned it from watching her parents interact? She quickly urged him out of the car.

With a puzzled expression, Yu Zhuqi exited the car, and after he entered the apartment, Yan Xinfei drove away.

As soon as Yu Zhuqi stepped inside, his grandfather called him.

“Xiao Yu, you took Xiao Yan home, right?”

Hearing his grandfather’s question made him feel a bit guilty. 

“Yeah, I did.”

He thought that should count since he had taken his sister home, even if she ended up taking him back afterward.

“Good, you need to treat Xiao Yan well. By the way, how did you two end up together? You didn’t trick her into being with you, did you?”

Yu Zhuqi felt a bit helpless at his grandfather’s skepticism. “Of course not! Sister and I are in a serious relationship.”

“Oh, I see.”

He detected a hint of disappointment in his grandfather’s tone.

“Grandpa, what are you thinking? I’m pretty great too, you know?”

“You… great? Forget it, Xiao Yan is the one who’s truly exceptional. You have no idea…”

“Hey, hey, Grandpa, the signal here is bad. I can’t hear you. I gotta go now, talk later!”

Yu Zhuqi really didn’t want to listen to his grandfather’s long lecture.

“You little rascal, just try hanging up on me…”

As soon as the old man heard Yu Zhuqi’s words, he knew he was trying to cut the call.

After hanging up, Yu Zhuqi sent a message to his sister as usual.

【Little Cutie】: Sister, are you home yet?

【Little Cutie】: Sister, make sure to get some rest!

Yan Xinfei had just returned to her apartment when she saw the messages.

【Sister】: Just got back. You too, goodnight!

【Little Cutie】: Mhm, sister, goodnight!

【Little Cutie】: ~\(≧▽≦)/~

After replying to her cute little companion, Yan Xinfei took a moment to meditate and absorb some of the essence of the day, then headed off to shower and sleep.

Meanwhile…

Zhao Min pulled Chao Yixiu into the amusement park, excitedly rushing to buy tickets, eager to try every single ride.

Unfortunately, when they reached the roller coaster, Zhao Min couldn’t handle it any longer and turned pale.

After exiting the ride, he ran to the side and bent over, throwing up.

Chao Yixiu, being attentive, handed him a bottle of water.

Seeing Zhao Min’s pale face and how miserable he looked, Chao Yixiu felt a pang of pity. 

“Maybe we should just go home?”

“No way! We promised to come to the amusement park together. We can’t just leave halfway through; that would be such a bummer!” Zhao Min immediately rejected Chao Yixiu’s suggestion.

“Alright.” Chao Yixiu knew Zhao Min’s stubborn nature and reluctantly agreed.

Still, he silently resolved to take good care of him and not let him push himself too hard.

Feeling a bit better after a while, Zhao Min decided to try out the other rides, which thankfully weren’t as intense.

Gradually, his complexion improved, and a bright smile returned to his face.

Chao Yixiu watched Zhao Min’s radiant smile; his expression was stoic, but his eyes held warmth.

Before long, they had nearly tried all the attractions, with only two left: the haunted house and the Ferris wheel.

As soon as Zhao Min entered the haunted house, he felt a little scared. When a staff member jumped out to scare him, he screamed and jumped into Chao Yixiu’s arms, holding onto him tightly.

Chao Yixiu was slightly taken aback. He hadn’t expected Zhao Min to be afraid of ghosts. But with his crush embracing him, he couldn’t possibly push him away. 

His body temperature began to rise…

Zhao Min didn’t notice Chao Yixiu’s reaction and continued to cling to him.

The surrounding staff members wore expressions of delight, doing their utmost to scare Zhao Min further.

Chao Yixiu noticed this and couldn’t help but smile.

Not bad, not bad, this staff member is doing a great job.

Poor Zhao Min was continuously frightened, burying himself deeper into Chao Yixiu’s embrace.

Eventually, they exited the haunted house.

Zhao Min took a moment to regain his composure, realizing that he had been tightly clinging to Chao Yixiu, feeling a bit embarrassed as he released his hold.

“I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to…”

Feeling the warmth leave his arms, Chao Yixiu felt a twinge of disappointment.

“It’s alright. Are we still going to play?”

“What else is left? Oh right, there’s the Ferris wheel.”

At this, Zhao Min hesitated. “Maybe we should skip the Ferris wheel? It’s getting late; let’s go eat instead. I’m really hungry.” 

He patted his stomach to emphasize his point.

Chao Yixiu understood what Zhao Min was really thinking. Although he felt a bit regretful, he also knew that letting Zhao Min spend a long time at the amusement park was a significant step forward. Other things couldn’t be rushed; after all, they had plenty of time.

“Okay, let’s go eat first.”

When Zhao Min heard that they wouldn’t be riding the Ferris wheel and would be going to eat instead, he visibly sighed in relief.
