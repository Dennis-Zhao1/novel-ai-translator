**Encountering a Little Puppy**

After working for a few days, Yan Xinfei, with the help of the original owner's memories, remembered that she could find some natural trinkets in the antique street. She thought about going there to look for items that could provide energy for her supernatural abilities. After all, without a zombie core in this world, she could only rely on absorbing other forms of energy, such as the essence of nature. 

She had tried using the forces of the natural world to cultivate her powers before. Although the progress was slow, it was not entirely fruitless. With these thoughts swirling in her mind, she got into her car and drove toward the antique street from the original owner's memories.

Soon, she arrived at the bustling antique street. The narrow alley was lined with old houses, their walls weathered and peeling, showcasing unique architectural styles that hinted at a rich, storied past. It was clear that these structures had witnessed the passage of time, their charm steeped in history. People buzzed about the alley, many browsing the stalls, while the vendors energetically promoted their wares to anyone who would listen.

“Old Zhang, you’ve been here for ages, yet I’ve never seen you recommend your stall to anyone!” a middle-aged man, around forty or fifty, remarked to a scruffy-looking old man.

“Buying from me is all about fate; if there's no fate, I won’t sell,” the old man chuckled dismissively.

“Isn’t everyone here to make money? You’re so stubborn! Why not take a chance on the rich folks? Even if they get scammed, they won’t miss a few bucks. With your attitude, who’s going to buy from you?” The middle-aged man continued to plead with the seemingly grumpy old man, but he was met with silence, as the old man kept his head down, eyes closed in meditation. With a resigned sigh, the man turned away.

Just then, a striking figure stopped in front of Old Zhang's stall. However, Old Zhang didn’t make an effort to introduce his items to Yan Xinfei. Ignoring him, she reached out with her delicate fingers, brushing away the dust from an ancient stone that caught her eye. 

“I’ll take this. How much?” she asked, her tone steady.

Old Zhang’s eyes lit up; he finally lifted his gaze to scrutinize her. “Two hundred thousand!” he stated flatly.

The middle-aged man nearly choked at the price. Who would spend that much on a piece of worn-out stone? It was absurd! But before he could voice his disbelief, he watched as Yan Xinfei casually pulled out a card and said, “Deal. This card has exactly 200,000 on it, no password.”

With that, she took the stone and walked off, leaving the middle-aged man in shock. It was only when he saw Old Zhang packing up that he hurriedly asked, “Hey, why are you closing up? What’s your secret? You sold a stone for 200,000! I’ve been here forever and never made that much!”

But Old Zhang ignored him and walked away. 

As Yan Xinfei exited the antique street, she heard a somewhat ethereal voice. Turning towards the source, her gaze locked onto a handsome figure. They held each other's gaze for a few seconds before she looked away and continued on her way.

Yu Zhuyi’s eyes followed Yan Xinfei’s silhouette as she moved. He placed a hand over his racing heart, cursing himself, “Why can’t you just behave?” 

Yes, in that fleeting moment of eye contact, he felt a rush of emotions. Though he didn’t want to admit it, it was undeniable; just seeing Yan Xinfei made his heart flutter, and he couldn’t shake the feeling that she was the one he had been searching for all along.

Back in her car, Yan Xinfei replayed the handsome face she had just encountered. He was strikingly beautiful, with features that seemed to be chiseled from marble. His angular face was exceptionally handsome, and while he had an air of nonchalance, the spark in his eyes held a depth that was hard to overlook.

His thick, jet-black hair framed his face, and beneath his sharp brows lay a pair of charming, elongated peach blossom eyes, brimming with emotion. A high nose and moderately full lips curled into a dazzling smile that seemed to dazzle her.

In that brief moment of connection, she felt captivated by his beauty. She had seen many handsome men before, but this one resonated with her aesthetic preferences. She mused to herself, *The male lead's looks shouldn’t be the standard; it should be this guy.* After all, the male lead truly looked like a dog.
