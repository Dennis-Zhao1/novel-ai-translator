**Chapter 91: The More They Get Angry, The Happier She Becomes**

This time, it wasn't Yan Xinfey driving; it was her original driver behind the wheel. 

Why hadn’t she used the original driver before? Well, back when she first arrived in this world, she felt it unnecessary to have someone else intruding on her space. After all, she had grown used to being independent and driving herself before the apocalypse. But today, dressed in a formal gown, it was simply inconvenient for her to drive, so she decided to let the original driver take over.

Now, as she sat in the back seat, Yan Xinfey realized having a driver was actually quite nice. She made a mental note to keep the driver on hand in the future—definitely a pleasant decision.

In the back seat, Yan Xinfey shared the space with the adorable little one. The dim lighting caressed her sister's face, revealing her stunning beauty in soft shadows. Yan Xinfey glanced at Yu Zhuyi, who was completely mesmerized by her sister’s enchanting eyes, his heart racing with hormones.

Next to him, Yan Xinfey's other sister, Yan Xinfey, couldn’t help but notice the growing tension in the air. A smirk tugged at her vibrant red lips as she subtly changed her posture, shifting one hand casually to rest on her knee while the other reached out to gently squeeze the soft hand of the adorable little one beside her.

Yu Zhuyi, already enchanted by Yan Xinfey’s beauty, was utterly shocked by this unexpected gesture. He widened his eyes, silently accusing her of teasing him. He felt a rush of anxiety; what if things got out of hand in the car? If it were any other time, he wouldn’t mind, but tonight he had gone all out with his styling—he couldn’t let anything ruin it.

However, to Yan Xinfey, Yu Zhuyi’s wide-eyed look seemed like the adorable little one was gazing at her with a flirty sparkle. Internally, she cursed under her breath, thinking, "This is just too much!"

Soon enough, Yan Xinfey and the adorable little one arrived at the venue for the party. The Ariel Hotel, nestled in the bustling heart of the city, didn’t look like a typical five-star hotel at first glance, but its opulent decor and ambiance spoke volumes. The international dishes served here were exquisite, especially the grilled meats, which had a unique flair.

Guests flowed in continuously, and the hotel entrance was lined with cars in every color imaginable.

Just five minutes before their arrival, Lu Xiuming and Wen Qingzhi had made their grand entrance at the party, hand in hand. Lu Xiuming was dressed in a sharp white suit, his dark hair impeccably styled, giving him a polished look that was undeniably handsome. The women in attendance couldn’t help but blush at his presence.

Then there was Wen Qingzhi, who appeared to be wearing a matching outfit with Lu Xiuming—a stunning white strapless gown. She looked like a delicate white lotus, pure and seemingly unable to fend for herself.

The women in the vicinity felt a wave of jealousy and resentment as they watched the couple. Even the most oblivious of them, Wen Qingzhi, sensed the prickly gazes directed her way. Realizing the source of the hostility, she straightened her back in pride, resembling a victorious rooster strutting about.

Those envious glances bore into her, and the women would have gladly torn her to pieces if looks could kill. 

Wen Qingzhi, sensing the growing anger and envy, found herself feeling happier and prouder by the moment. The more they fumed, the more it fueled her joy.
