### Chapter 71: The Dog Boyfriend Got Kicked

After that, they nearly tried every attraction in the amusement park. Now, the only two things left were the haunted house and the Ferris wheel.

Yan Xinfei bought tickets and headed over to the haunted house with her adorable companion. Just as they were about to enter, they unexpectedly ran into two familiar faces at the entrance.

Yan Xinfei raised an eyebrow, eyeing the pair before her. Yu Zhuqi felt a bit uneasy upon seeing the two; he had heard rumors that his sister once had feelings for the guy in front of him. Although he had never believed those gossiping whispers before, things were different now that he was in love with his sister. Naturally, he began to pay attention to every little detail about her past.

His deep affection for her made him sensitive to such matters. Even though they were officially together now, he often felt a sense of unreality, as if he might wake up one day to find it all had been a dream. If that ever happened, he feared he might lose his mind. It's a feeling that comes from knowing you once had something precious that you ultimately lost—a feeling of overwhelming despair.

Yu Zhuqi unconsciously tightened his grip on his sister's hand.

Yan Xinfei felt the pressure of his grip, which was starting to hurt. It wasn't that she couldn't handle a bit of discomfort, but it was just a bit too tight for her liking. She attempted to wiggle her hand free, hoping to ease his grip. However, her slight struggle only seemed to tighten it further. Resigned, she decided to ignore the little pain.

Lu Qiuming felt uneasy under Yan Xinfei's icy gaze, which made him feel like a stranger. Unable to hold back, he stepped forward and asked, "How have you been lately? I noticed you haven’t come to see me."

Upon hearing this, Yan Xinfei's eyes turned even colder, and a sarcastic laugh echoed in her mind. 

Yu Zhuqi glared at Lu Qiuming with anger, resembling a cub whose territory had been invaded. 

Wen Qingzhi, standing nearby, felt a mix of heartache and anxiety at the scene unfolding. She was scared… 

She tried to re-link her arm with Lu Qiuming’s, but his step backward made it seem like he was dodging her. Frustrated, she could only shoot daggers at Yan Xinfei from the side.

Seeing Yu Zhuqi glare at him, Lu Qiuming felt a surge of satisfaction. Not bothering to wait for Yan Xinfei's response, he smugly continued, "I know you must be jealous. Believe me, there’s nothing between me and her. You know we’re just college classmates."

The "her" he referred to was glaring daggers at Yan Xinfei from behind him.

If Yan Xinfei hadn't reviewed the original host's memories and the tragic fate of the previous owner of this body, she might have been fooled by this hypocritical dog boyfriend. After all, who would expect him to look so decent on the outside while being so… rotten inside?

This was a classic case of "golden on the outside, rotten on the inside."

Yan Xinfei couldn't bear to watch anymore; the dog boyfriend was putting on a one-man show. 

In a cold voice, she interrupted him, "You think I’d seek you out? Who do you think you are? Why would I want to find you? What right do you have to demand that of me? And are you sure there's nothing going on between you and Wen Qingzhi?"

By the end of her statement, she couldn’t help but let a bit of malice seep into her tone, wanting to see how the dog boyfriend would react.

Lu Qiuming felt a flash of anger at Yan Xinfei’s words, but when he heard her last question, he mistakenly thought she was just playing hard to get.

Suppressing his inner fury, he forced a gentle expression and replied, "Xinfei, there’s really nothing between us."

Unbeknownst to him, the person behind him swayed slightly.

"Is that so? Then how can you prove it?" Yan Xinfei pressed.

Hastily, Lu Qiuming sought to regain her favor, "Really, there's nothing at all! Just trust me..."

Yu Zhuqi, listening to their conversation, felt a dull ache in his heart and an overwhelming sense of disappointment.

Noticing the dejected expression on Yu Zhuqi's face, Yan Xinfei suddenly found this whole scene rather dull. She cut off the dog boyfriend mid-sentence, "Forget it, you don’t need to explain. Go and explain it to your white moonlight instead. Just don’t show up in front of me again."

With that, she grabbed Yu Zhuqi’s hand and headed into the haunted house.

Lu Qiuming was left awkwardly sprawled on the ground.

Wen Qingzhi looked at Lu Qiuming with disgust as he lay there, feeling a mix of resentment toward his recent choices. Although she wasn’t the original owner of this body, she had developed feelings for him through their interactions. It stung to see him so easily choose someone else in a situation like this.

She wanted to leave but was reluctant to part with the benefits he brought her. So, she plastered on a worried expression and approached to help him up.

"Brother Qiuming, are you okay? Are you hurt?" she asked, feigning concern, her eyes brimming with faux tears.

Despite feeling embarrassed by his current state, he couldn’t deny that she was genuinely worried about him, and now she was the only one left by his side.

"I'm fine. The reason I didn’t choose you earlier was just that I wanted to secure some shares from the Yan family. You know, the one I truly love is you," he said softly.

Wen Qingzhi looked into his deeply affectionate eyes, feeling a twinge of distance but forced herself to act touched. She lowered her head and replied gently, "I understand, Qiuming. Even if you don’t choose me, I won't hold it against you."

"You really are the best, Qingzhi." 

Lu Qiuming’s heart melted at her words, feeling an overwhelming wave of emotion wash over him. 

But whether she truly believed in his sincerity—only she knew in her heart.

In the end, she helped him up and the two left the scene. Thankfully, not many people had witnessed this moment; only a few bystanders had taken notice.

————————————

Yan Xinfei looked at her adorable companion, who seemed downcast. She playfully nudged his hand, coaxing him, "What’s wrong? Little buddy, why do you look so gloomy?"

Yu Zhuqi, irritated by his sister's carefree demeanor, abruptly pulled away from her grasp. His tone was icy, "It's nothing. You should focus on that dog guy instead."

Finally realizing that Yu Zhuqi was sulking because of this incident, Yan Xinfei couldn’t help but chuckle. 

Yu Zhuqi mistook her laughter for mockery, and the air around him darkened, as if clouds were gathering.

Yan Xinfei reached out to take his hand again, only to find him trying to pull away. Using a bit more force, she entwined their fingers tightly. 

Yu Zhuqi quickly found himself unable to escape her grip and averted his gaze, scanning the surroundings instead.

"Alright, alright, don’t be upset. I really don’t have anything going on with that dog… I mean, Lu Qiuming. Besides, I never liked him in the first place. Don’t let his nonsense mess with our relationship, okay?"

Yan Xinfei nearly slipped and called him "dog boyfriend," but thankfully she caught herself just in time. 

However, Yu Zhuqi thought she was merely cursing him, which eased his anger a bit. 

Truthfully, he hadn't been that mad at his sister; he was more frustrated with himself for not realizing his feelings for her sooner.

So, he softened his expression and replied, "I’m not angry."

"Good, good, you’re not angry! So, shall we head to the haunted house now?"

Hearing her talk to him like a child made his cheeks flush.

"Mm."
