**Chapter 30: Recording in Progress**

Yen Xinfei caught sight of the malicious gaze directed at her and couldn’t help but exclaim, “Oh, what a surprise! It’s a familiar face.” However, she chose not to engage with Wen Qingzhi.

After her remark, she confidently stepped forward to greet the other artists who had already arrived. The camera panned to Yen Xinfei, and the viewer count in the livestream skyrocketed as if it had exploded.

**[Little Painting]**: Where did this goddess come from?

**[Bunny]**: I declare, she’s my new crush!

**[Rich Young Master]**: Someone get me her info! I’ll give you three minutes!

**[☆Heart]**: The CEO vibe is strong here! Back off, she’s my wife!

**[@]**: Same here, she’s mine!

The comments flooded the screen, filled with declarations of love for Yen Xinfei, calling her “wife” and “new crush.”

The staff informed the director of the lively atmosphere in the livestream, and he smiled, instructing the crew to keep the camera focused on Yen Xinfei as much as possible. He sensed that this variety show was going to be a hit.

Wen Qingzhi was well aware of Yen Xinfei, especially given the buzz surrounding her and Lu Xiuming’s relationship. Initially, she felt a pang of unease, worried that Yen Xinfei might steal Lu Xiuming away from her. 

But as time passed, she learned that Lu Xiuming actually disliked Yen Xinfei, even feeling repulsed by her. That revelation eased Wen Qingzhi’s worries, shifting her feelings towards Yen Xinfei from apprehension to a smidge of sympathy, mixed with a larger dose of disdain.

Wen Qingzhi looked down on Yen Xinfei, believing that despite her wealth, power, and beauty, it didn’t matter—her own crush was still pursuing her so eagerly. 

She hadn’t expected to bump into Yen Xinfei here. Taking a moment to compose herself, she pretended to be familiar with Yan Xibei and approached with a soft tone. “Sister Yen, long time no see! I didn’t expect you to be here for this variety show too.”

Yen Xinfei looked puzzled and asked, “Who are you…?”

At that moment, another female artist couldn’t help but burst out laughing. Embarrassed, she scratched her head and said, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to laugh; that was just too funny!”

Wen Qingzhi’s smile became a bit stiff. She bit her lip, regained her composure, and forced her smile to be even sweeter. “It’s okay! It’s normal for you not to remember me, especially since your eyes are always on him…” As she spoke, she abruptly covered her mouth in a feigned gesture of having accidentally misspoken.

**[Blood on Mosquito]**: Oh my gosh, does she mean…?

What a juicy scoop!

**[☆Your White Moonlight]**: No way, no way! Just found a goddess, and she’s already taken?

**[Xinxin]**: What’s with this girl? Why does she look like such a scheming white lotus?

**[My Wen Qingzhi]**: If you don’t know how to talk, just stay quiet. Sister Qingzhi is no white lotus; she just misspoke!

**[❤Wen Qingzhi]**: Exactly! Sister Qingzhi only said one little thing!

**[Love Wen Sister]**: @ [Xinxin] Back off! Don’t badmouth our Sister Qingzhi. We’ve known her since before her debut; she’s always been so gentle and kind.

**[Bystander A]**: I’m not a fan of anyone, but let me be objective: that goddess just said she’s not familiar with Wen Qingzhi, right? And yet, Wen Qingzhi acts like they’re best friends and goes up to her.

The goddess didn’t respond warmly to Wen Qingzhi, and she kept putting on a show.

**[Bystander B]**: I agree with the previous comment. You shouldn’t have to act chummy with someone you barely know. The goddess didn’t ignore Wen Qingzhi; she just asked who she was. Her expression didn’t even change! And Wen Qingzhi is over here pretending to have made a mistake? Who is she trying to fool?

**[Green Leaf Safe]**: Exactly.

...

The comments in the livestream were sharply divided, with some defending Yen Xinfei and others standing up for Wen Qingzhi.
