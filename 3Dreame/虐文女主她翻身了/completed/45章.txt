**Chapter 45: Finally Going Home**

As they packed their things and made their way downstairs, they found Wen Qingzhi still enjoying her breakfast.

Everyone felt a bit bewildered—how could she still be eating at such a late hour, without even starting to pack? They glanced at the wall clock: 9:35 AM. 

Wen Qingzhi hadn’t noticed they had already gathered their luggage and come down; she was still dawdling, munching on a fried dough stick. 

Zhou Cong could no longer hold back. His voice came out tinged with frustration, “Can you eat a bit faster? Can’t you see everyone’s waiting for you?!”

Wen Qingzhi jumped at the sudden outburst, completely oblivious to her own wrongdoing. Feeling wronged, she replied, “I’m eating, aren’t I? Why rush me?” 

Then, she went back to her leisurely breakfast.

The reason Wen Qingzhi was taking her time was that she had been complaining about the few fried dough sticks for a long while. As soon as she started eating, they had already begun descending.

Yan Xinfei didn’t want to engage with her any longer; some people simply couldn’t be reasoned with. She grabbed her luggage and walked out. Xu Xiaoxiao and the others saw this and followed suit.

Only Song Lin remained behind, sitting on the sofa with his luggage, waiting for Wen Qingzhi. 

Sitting in the car waiting was definitely better than waiting here, at least they wouldn’t have to witness Wen Qingzhi’s dawdling.

Once they reached the car, Yan Xinfei opened her laptop and started handling company documents. 

Xu Xiaoxiao sat beside her, impressed by her dedication. “Wow, Sister Xinfei, you’re so amazing, and you still work so seriously.”

Knowing Yan Xinfei was busy, nobody in the car spoke; they all focused on their phones.

Finally, just as Yan Xinfei was finishing up the documents, Wen Qingzhi made her tardy entrance.

She carried only a small bag, while Song Lin was lugging both his and Wen Qingzhi’s luggage.

After Wen Qingzhi settled into the car, they headed back.

Throughout the ride, Yan Xinfei dozed off, Xu Xiaoxiao was glued to her phone, and Zhou Cong and the others stared out the window.

Nobody paid any attention to Wen Qingzhi.

Well, there was Song Lin, but Wen Qingzhi didn’t want to talk to him. 

In her eyes, Song Lin was just a loyal follower.

**[Honesty Under the Sun]**: Wen Qingzhi is at it again.  
**[Passing Through Your Time]**: At least she has something to eat, and she still complains.  
**[Longing Transformed into the Sea]**: Sister Qingzhi didn’t say she was complaining, okay?  
**[Outsider]**: She dawdled for so long while everyone else was packed and ready—she was the last one.  
**[Fossil]**: Sister Qingzhi just isn’t used to eating fast.  
**[Dreaming]**: Song Lin really is something, treating her so well.  
**[No One Asks]**: Could it be that Wen Qingzhi has something going on with him?  
**[No Way]**: How is that possible? My sister Qingzhi could never like him!  
**[Mocking Smile]**: He just helped her carry her luggage and assisted her during the variety show, there was no intimate contact.  
**[Fish Charm]**: But no other male artists help Wen Qingzhi like that.

...

An hour and a half later, they returned to the original location where they had been waiting to record the variety show.

All the artists' assistants were already there, waiting in their cars.

“Sister Xinfei, I’m going to miss you,” Xu Xiaoxiao said reluctantly. “Can I add you on WeChat?”

“Sure,” Yan Xinfei replied, opening her phone to show her WeChat QR code for Xu Xiaoxiao to scan.

Zhou Cong and the others noticed and also crowded around to scan Yan Xinfei’s WeChat QR code.

Under the assistant's urging, they gradually started to leave.

Yan Xinfei stood there for a moment, just as she was about to walk toward the assistant’s car, when she noticed a familiar vehicle pulling up in front of her.

The window rolled down, revealing the male lead of their show.

“Do you want me to give you a ride home, Yan Xinfei?”

Yan Xinfei glanced at Wen Qingzhi sitting in the passenger seat, raising an eyebrow with a smile. “No need, take your white moonlight home instead.”

Lu Qiuming thought Yan Xinfei was being jealous. “Yan Xinfei, know your limits; don’t make me dislike you.”

“Can’t you understand human language? I already said no.”

“You don’t want—”

At that moment, Yu Zhuyi walked over, wrapping her arm around Yan Xinfei’s waist, provocatively saying, “Sister already said no, and she has me to take her home, right? Sister?”

“Mm-hmm.”

“Good for you.” Lu Qiuming drove off, his face dark with anger.

“Sister, will you be mad at me? Did I disturb you?” he whispered in her ear.

Though he spoke words of apology, his hands tightened around Yan Xinfei’s waist. It seemed if she said she was upset with him, he would…

A classic case of saying one thing and doing another.

“No, you didn’t disturb me. Let’s go,” Yan Xinfei said, pulling his hand away from her waist and instead holding onto his hand.

Once inside the car, Yan Xinfei leaned over him, lifted his chin with her hand, and kissed him.

His eyes sparkled, his fair arms wrapped around Yan Xinfei’s neck; his slender neck tilted slightly, welcoming her kiss. The warm kiss landed softly on his face, and his body melted against hers.

After the kiss, Yan Xinfei started the car and drove away.
