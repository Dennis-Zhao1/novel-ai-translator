**Chapter 49: The Agreed Time**

After finding the clothes, Yanshin handed them over to Little Cutie in the guest room. She noticed that Little Cutie was still in the shower, and the sound of the water made her feel a bit flustered. 

Holding the clothes in one hand, Yanshin knocked on the bathroom door. 

"What's up?" Little Cutie's voice came from within, sounding a bit startled.

Yanshin heard the voice and gritted her teeth, "Open the door a bit; I’m just passing you the clothes."

Little Cutie replied with a slightly muffled tone, "No need, sister! Just leave them at the door, I’ll grab them later."

After saying this, he realized there was no more sound from outside and assumed that his sister had already left. 

As he opened the door to retrieve the clothes, he was startled to see a figure standing there. 

"Sister? You’re still here?" Little Cutie blinked at Yanshin.

"I'll leave once you take the clothes inside." 

With no choice, Little Cutie cautiously extended his fair right hand to take the clothes from Yanshin. 

Yanshin lightly brushed her fingertips against his outstretched hand, handing over the clothes to Little Cutie. 

Once he had the clothes, he quickly closed the door. 

Just now, he felt as if his sister had intentionally touched his hand; he wasn’t sure if it was just his imagination. 

He shook his head, dismissing the thought. He didn’t believe his sister would do something like that. 

Watching Little Cutie close the door, Yanshin felt a twinge of regret as she stood at the door. She waited until the sound of water resumed inside, then faded away, followed by the rustling sound of clothing being put on. Only then did she return to her own room. 

When Little Cutie came out dressed, he found that his sister was no longer there. He let out a sigh of relief, tinged with a hint of disappointment. 

Realizing he felt a bit let down, he couldn’t help but mentally scold himself: What are you thinking, Yuzhu? 

Once in bed, the more he thought about it, the hotter his face felt. Eventually, he surrendered to his thoughts and buried his head into the pillow. 

Suddenly, he remembered: the outfit his sister had given him—where did it come from? 

It clearly didn’t fit him well, suggesting it wasn’t meant for him. So, who was it intended for? 

It couldn't have been delivered just now, right? 

But then he considered that his sister hadn’t had any other men visiting. 

Never mind, he thought, he couldn’t figure it out. He’d just ask his sister when he had the chance. 

Lost in these thoughts, his eyelids grew heavy, and soon he drifted off to sleep. 

Meanwhile, in the next room, Yanshin was clearly not able to fall asleep as quickly. The image of the scene at the bathroom door kept replaying in her mind. 

The more she thought, the more irritable she felt, so she decided to sit up and meditate. 

After managing to calm her restless feelings, it was already deep into the night. 

Lying in bed, she focused on controlling herself, trying to fall asleep as quickly as possible.

Lu Xiuming arrived at the agreed place—Night Queen Bar—at the designated time. 

Upon entering, the blaring music in the bar made him feel a bit on edge, but he had to endure it. 

Lu Xiuming found a man named Heizi, explained his purpose, and asked him to take him to find Brother Hui. 

Heizi was a towering figure, at least six foot three, standing straight like a pine tree, with broad and powerful shoulders, and bulging muscles on his arms. His deep-set eyes and slanted brows gave him an intimidating appearance, and his lips were pressed into a straight line, making him look fierce at first glance. 

Standing next to him, Lu Xiuming felt like a fragile chick, certain that a single punch from Heizi could send him sprawling. 

Heizi walked ahead, leading the way, while Lu Xiuming followed closely, keeping a respectful distance.
