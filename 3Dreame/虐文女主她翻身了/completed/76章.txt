**Chapter 76: Preparing to Meet the Parents**

On the other side, Wen Qingzhi carefully supported Lu Xiuming as they exited the amusement park. 

As they walked, Lu Xiuming couldn't shake the feeling that people were casting strange glances at him. Once they got back to the car, his anger simmered as he recalled how Yan Xinfei used to treat him with such affection, like a precious treasure held delicately in hand, as if afraid it might break or melt away. 

No matter how outrageous his behavior had been, Yan Xinfei would merely listen quietly, never uttering a harsh word. Instead, she would shower him with precious gifts in hopes of winning his forgiveness. But now, she no longer trailed behind him, her eyes seemingly devoid of him, as if her previous affection had been nothing but a joke. 

Now, Yan Xinfei stood beside someone else, and the way she looked at Yu Zhuyi mirrored how she used to gaze at him. 

The more he thought about it, the hotter his anger burned. If that was how it was going to be, then he had to expedite his plans. Initially, he wanted her to come back to him willingly, to disregard her past actions, but now he was losing patience.

If Yan Xinfei could hear Lu Xiuming's thoughts, she would surely slap him hard across the face, waking him from his delusions. When the original owner of this body liked him and followed him around, he had treated that affection with disdain—perhaps he saw the original owner as nothing more than a lapdog, there to serve him at his beck and call.

He felt a flicker of ruthlessness in his eyes. Just then, he glanced at Wen Qingzhi sitting in the passenger seat, and his heart softened a bit. It was clear: she was the only one by his side, never judging him or abandoning him. 

Looking at Wen Qingzhi’s beautiful face, a flash of desire crossed his mind. He leaned closer, his voice dripping with longing as he asked, "Can I kiss you?" 

Wen Qingzhi suppressed her disgust and pretended to shyly lower her head, softly responding, "Okay." 

In a rush, Lu Xiuming captured Wen Qingzhi’s lips with his own. The temperature inside the car soared as his hands grew restless...

Meanwhile, as Yu Zhuyi finally calmed the heat on his face, he realized they were on a route he didn't recognize. Confused, he looked at his sister.

Yan Xinfei noticed his puzzled expression but didn't respond immediately. It was only when they stopped at a red light that she turned to him and asked, "What's wrong, little cutie?"

Hearing his sister call him that made Yu Zhuyi feel inexplicably embarrassed. "Sister, why do you call me 'little cutie'?"

"Because you look so adorable," she replied, a teasing smile on her face.

Adorable? If his friends heard that, they would surely laugh and say it was because she hadn’t seen him in a brawl, where he fought like a little wolf cub, leaving opponents bloodied and bruised. 

Yu Zhuyi quickly decided he couldn't let his sister know he was a fighter. He needed to protect his little secret. So, he swiftly changed the subject. "Sister, why are you driving today?"

"Oh, it's because we're going to meet Grandpa tonight, right? I thought I'd take you home to change clothes first," Yan Xinfei explained.

Yu Zhuyi suddenly remembered, almost forgetting that they were supposed to have dinner with their grandfather that evening. Growing up, he had always felt closer to his grandfather than to his parents, who hardly mattered to him. 

His father and mother had married for family interests, a business alliance. His mother believed that even without feelings at first, love would blossom over time, just as it had for their parents. But she was mistaken; their marriage was cold as ice, with the couple treating each other with formality.

A year later, his mother became pregnant and gave birth to him, thinking that having a child would bring them closer. But instead, their relationship remained unchanged. After a while, his mother gave up hope and poured all her energy into raising him.

He felt a semblance of familial love from his mother, but that was only in his early years. Tragically, she became unhappy after childbirth and passed away due to her emotional struggles just a few years later. Although his father never remarried after her death, he also showed little interest in his son, spending most of his days at work and offering only the briefest of greetings when they crossed paths.

In truth, he and his father shared no bond, and only his grandfather genuinely cared for him. So, even if he disliked his uncle and father, he would still return home for his grandfather’s sake.

"Oh, I see. Alright," Yu Zhuyi nodded at Yan Xinfei. Just then, the green light turned on, and he reminded her it was time to drive again.

Yan Xinfei stopped teasing the little cutie and focused on the road. A short while later, they arrived at her apartment. 

She opened the car door for Yu Zhuyi, protecting his head as he got out. "Come on, let's go inside together."

"Okay!" Hearing his sister invite him in, Yu Zhuyi was more than happy to oblige. Moments later, while Yan Xinfei went upstairs to change, Yu Zhuyi waited in the living room.

Ten minutes later, Yan Xinfei descended from the second floor. When Yu Zhuyi heard the sound and looked up, his eyes lit up in astonishment. 

His sister had changed into a simple yet elegant white outfit, a sight he rarely saw her wear. It made her appear even more dignified and graceful, but also alluring and enchanting. 

Dressed in white, with her long hair cascading down, she looked like a fairy, delicate and exquisite, as if she were carved from fine jade, a true beauty of winter.

Although her expression was cool, she embodied the essence of an ice queen. Yu Zhuyi felt a surge of possessiveness; he liked his sister more and more. 

He thought that such a beautiful sister should only be seen by him. He didn’t want anyone else to admire her in that lovely outfit. Even though she wore it for their visit to their grandfather, he still felt a twinge of jealousy. 

Deep down, he knew there was nothing he could do about it. Even if he asked her to change, it would be pointless; after all, his sister was stunning, and anything she wore would attract attention. 

He buried his jealousy deep within, forcing a smile. "Sister, you look so beautiful."

Yan Xinfei accepted the compliment with a smile and then gently nudged him to change into the clothes she had prepared for him.

Five minutes later, Yu Zhuyi emerged in a crisp white suit, resembling a little prince. His outfit perfectly matched his sister’s, creating a couple’s look.

He felt joyful; it was evident to anyone that he and his sister were a couple, which made him so happy. 

Then, Yan Xinfei handed him a purple sandalwood box containing the inkstone they were gifting their grandfather, asking him to hold it for her since she couldn’t carry it in her dress. It would seem odd if she took it out when they arrived at Grandpa's house.

Yan Xinfei glanced at Yu Zhuyi, satisfied that he looked good in the clothes she had chosen. "This is a gift for Grandpa, right?" 

Yu Zhuyi gazed at the box in his hands, unable to suppress his curiosity about why his sister had never gifted him anything. 

With a pout, he said, "Sister, you’re already preparing gifts for Grandpa before you even meet him, but I’ve become your boyfriend, and you’ve never given me a gift!" 

Yan Xinfei felt a twinge of guilt. "Of course, I’ve prepared a gift for you! How could I forget about you? I’m just planning a surprise for you. You’ll get it soon!" 

She hurriedly changed the subject. "Alright, enough chit-chat. It's getting late; we should head out now."

Yu Zhuyi, still gleeful that his sister had prepared a gift for him, didn’t notice her attempt to divert the conversation. 

"Okay, sister!" 

Seeing the trusting look in Yu Zhuyi's eyes, Yan Xinfei finally let out a sigh of relief. Thankfully, she was quick-witted; otherwise, things could have turned awkward. But it was fine—she had plenty of gifts in her space and could easily pick one for him later.

With her decision made, they set off in the car towards Grandpa's house.
