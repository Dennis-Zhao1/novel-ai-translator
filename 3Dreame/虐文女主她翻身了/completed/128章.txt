She was just about to sit up slowly and say something when Yu Zhu Yi walked in with a stern expression. If it weren't for the slightly disheveled footsteps and the subtle tremor in his hanging hands, it would be hard to tell that he was unsettled inside.

Due to not having sat up for a long time, she felt weak and couldn’t manage to lift herself. Yu Zhu Yi carefully helped her up, placing a pillow behind her for support, as if she were a fragile treasure. Then, he poured a glass of warm water and gently fed it to her.

During this time, he didn't say a word, just stared intensely at her. Yan Xin Fei felt a mix of helplessness and heartache. As she sipped the water slowly, she couldn’t help but sneak glances at him. Even after seeing him many times, she was still captivated by his presence. 

Now that he had matured significantly, she felt her heart flutter uncontrollably. Once she finished the glass of water and set it down on the nearby table, she was about to speak when he suddenly pulled her into a tight embrace. 

She instinctively wanted to struggle, feeling taken aback. “Don’t move, just let me hold you for a moment,” he said. In the next second, Yan Xin Fei felt a dampness on her neck and realized that he was crying. 

She froze, not daring to move, maintaining the position he preferred. “Sister, you have no idea how scared I was. Thank goodness, thank goodness you’re awake now,” Yu Zhu Yi’s voice was filled with relief.

Yan Xin Fei patted his back with both hands, reassuring him, “I won’t, I promised I wouldn’t leave you.” 

“I can protect you now,” he asserted with sincerity. 

“Okay, okay, good boy,” she replied softly.

Time passed, and when he finally released her, half an hour had already gone by. Ever since she woke up, he had stayed by her side, never leaving her. On the day she regained consciousness, everyone learned about it and came to visit.

——————————— Separation Line ———————————

After waking, she stayed in the hospital for nearly a month, a duration she had to negotiate hard to achieve. Though she felt much better, her cute companion insisted she remain hospitalized, and she had no choice but to comply with his wishes.

Eventually, she grew tired of being there and had to find ways to convince him to arrange her discharge. Once she was out, she discovered that after her fainting spell, Wen Qing Zhi and her accomplices had been imprisoned. Zhao Min and Chao Yi Xiu had also come out as a couple, legally recognized in another country.

Her cute companion's business continued to flourish, and under his management, her own company was thriving as well. Oh, and by the way, the dog-like male lead's company had long since gone bankrupt.

A week after her discharge, her adorable companion proposed to her. Although she was a bit surprised, what could she do? She had to accept it; after all, he made her heart race. So, under his plans, they quickly obtained their marriage certificate.

A month later, Yan Xin Fei and Yu Zhu Yi held an extravagant wedding. 

“Miss Yan Xin Fei… do you take Yu Zhu Yi to be your lawfully wedded husband?” 

Yan Xin Fei beamed, “I do.” 

“And you, Mr. Yu Zhu Yi… do you take Yan Xin Fei to be your lawfully wedded wife?” 

Yu Zhu Yi could hardly contain himself, “I do!” 

Then, in front of all their loved ones, they exchanged rings. The happiness radiating from Yu Zhu Yi and Yan Xin Fei was palpable. 

It felt incredible; they were finally together, married.
