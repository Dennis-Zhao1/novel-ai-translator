**Chapter Seventy-Five: Are They Here Too?**

On the other side of the amusement park, Zhao Min and Chao Yixiu had just arrived when they caught sight of a figure in the distance that looked strikingly like their friend Yu. 

Zhao Min nudged Chao Yixiu, uncertainty flickering in his eyes as he asked, "Yixiu, do you think that’s Yu over there? It kinda looks like him. Should we go say hi?" He didn’t mention the part about wanting to hang out with Yu’s girlfriend, Zhu Yi.

Chao Yixiu immediately sensed the gears turning in Zhao Min's mind. He didn’t call him out on it directly; instead, a knowing smile danced in his eyes as he adjusted his glasses. "It's not him. Yu wouldn’t come here. Have you ever seen him at an amusement park?"

Chao Yixiu’s tone was overly serious, and though it was a blatant lie, he had already spotted Zhu Yi and Yan Xinfei nearby—they seemed to be enjoying a date. But this was Zhao Min’s and his first "date" at the amusement park, and there was no way he was going to let anyone else intrude on that, not even their close friends.

Even if this was a fabricated date, it didn’t matter to him; as long as they were together, he was content. He figured that as long as he said it wasn’t Zhu Yi, this big idiot would never catch on.

Zhao Min, however, wasn't entirely convinced by Chao Yixiu's words. But in the end, he was easily swayed by Chao Yixiu's playful persuasion, and the topic was dropped. As he surveyed the bustling amusement park, Zhao Min's reluctance was palpable.

Alright, he was really not thrilled about being there. Deep down, he felt that amusement parks were meant for little kids or couples on dates, not for two grown men like them. After all, they were university students, and it felt a bit embarrassing to be there.

Chao Yixiu could see the hesitation and regret swirling in Zhao Min's expression. Instead of pressuring him directly, he decided to play the victim card. 

"Zhao Min, you don’t want to go in, do you? But you promised me! You said if I helped you talk to Yu about your work at the company, you’d agree to a request of mine. I tried to keep it simple, but if it’s too much for you, maybe you should just leave?" 

With that, he turned away, pretending to be heartbroken. However, where Zhao Min couldn’t see, Chao Yixiu’s expression was anything but sad; it was filled with determination.

Zhao Min felt a twinge of guilt. After all, he had asked Chao Yixiu to lie for him, and he had been the one who offered to grant a request. It was troubling for someone like him, who prided himself on being honest, to find himself in this position.

Chao Yixiu, the ever-moral person, noticed the wavering in Zhao Min's resolve and decided to stoke the flames further. He feigned a downcast look, his voice tinged with a subtle plea. “It’s okay if you can’t agree to my request. I understand it might be too much for you, but I won’t hold it against you. I just wanted to fulfill a childhood dream of mine since I never got to enjoy an amusement park growing up.”

While it was true Chao Yixiu hadn’t visited an amusement park as a child, that was by his own choice—he had always thought it was childish, and even when his parents wanted to take him, he had refused. Now, he was playing this card to manipulate Zhao Min, who was none the wiser.

Upon hearing Chao Yixiu's sad words, Zhao Min’s sense of justice surged, and he eagerly replied, “Alright, then let’s go!”

Zhao Min hooked his arm around Chao Yixiu's neck, and since Chao Yixiu was a few inches taller, it made for a comical scene. Zhao Min's enthusiastic gesture nearly caused Chao Yixiu to stumble.

As they walked, the height difference forced Chao Yixiu to bend slightly towards Zhao Min. In a fortuitous twist of fate, Chao Yixiu's cool lips brushed against Zhao Min's delicate earlobe, sending an unexpected thrill through him. 

Chao Yixiu felt a rush of heat fill his cheeks, his heart racing as he became momentarily flustered. Meanwhile, Zhao Min was blissfully unaware, only noticing a slight chill against his ear without understanding its implications.

Not satisfied with such a brief encounter, Chao Yixiu casually leaned closer to Zhao Min's neck, his voice dropping to a husky whisper. "Slow down, I’m kind of tired; let me lean on you for a moment."

The warm breath against his sensitive earlobe made Zhao Min’s skin flush a bright shade of red.

Chao Yixiu’s eyes glimmered with mischief. Zhao Min, oblivious to the shift in their dynamic, pushed gently at Chao Yixiu, feeling a bit awkward. "It feels a bit strange for you to lean on me like this."

Chao Yixiu raised an eyebrow, his voice low and teasing. "Why? We're both grown men; what's wrong with leaning on each other?"

Zhao Min pondered the question and realized there wasn't really anything wrong with it. In fact, he wouldn’t have suspected that there could be more to this kind of closeness.

Little did he know that one day, he would reflect on this and wish he had understood sooner.

Nearby, a few excited girls walked past, stealing glances at the two of them, their expressions filled with the kind of starstruck admiration one might reserve for an idol.

Zhao Min, completely oblivious to the attention, continued to walk on. Chao Yixiu, however, noticed the lingering gazes and couldn’t help but smirk to himself, amused by the situation.

In a sudden move, Chao Yixiu leaned most of his weight against Zhao Min, who grunted in surprise. “Whoa, Yixiu, you’re heavy!”

Zhao Min complained, his face scrunching up as he struggled to maintain his balance. 

Chao Yixiu lightened his grip, easing up a bit on the pressure.

---

Chao Yixiu felt a mix of relief and disappointment. On one hand, he was glad Zhao Min believed him, but on the other, it highlighted that this big fool still hadn’t caught on. The road to winning his heart was going to be long and winding.

He pushed aside his momentary sadness, standing straight again, no longer leaning on Zhao Min. 

Noticing the shift in Chao Yixiu's demeanor, Zhao Min assumed his friend was just feeling unwell from their earlier antics. He was determined to lift Chao Yixiu’s spirits and thought that maybe some fun at the amusement park would do the trick.

Seeing Zhao Min’s enthusiasm, Chao Yixiu felt a smile return to his face, brushing aside his previous gloom. He knew that love couldn’t be forced; for now, he was content just being by Zhao Min’s side, waiting for the day his heart would finally catch up.
