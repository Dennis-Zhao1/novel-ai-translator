**Chapter 56: She Was Actually Daydreaming**

In a clean and elegant room, a plush double bed sits at the center, draped with a pristine white bedspread embroidered with tiny flowers. To the left, there are a pair of delicate little sofas alongside a bedside table, which holds a small lamp made from stacked seashells. To the right, a light green refrigerator stands adorned with a set of intricately carved glass water cups.

Suspended in the middle of the room is a large, colorful photograph, while the walls are decorated with curtains embroidered with hunting scenes, skillfully stitched with threads of gold, silver, and various colors. The bed is covered with a lavish silk bedspread, surrounded by short, purple curtains that add a touch of luxury. The chairs have colorful covers, and one of them is particularly tall, featuring a lace-carved ivory footstool in front.

From a distance, a pure-looking girl sits on the bed. If one were to ignore the expression on her face, everything seems to be quite beautiful.

Since returning from filming a variety show, Ava Wen has been restless. Yesterday, when she got back, her assistant informed her that many people online were scolding her. Ava was furious, cursing those who didn’t know their place. Now, she had become quite popular, though it was the kind of fame that was more blacklisted than celebrated. She had even made it to the trending topics for all the wrong reasons.

Normally, Ava would call Lucas Liao and whine, eliciting his sympathy to help get her name off the trending list. But now, she hesitated to reach out to him for help. After all, yesterday, when Lucas picked her up after the show, he had seen a girl named Yvonne Yan, and he had even considered letting her ride in his car.

Though Yvonne ultimately didn’t get in, Ava witnessed that moment and was terrified that Lucas might still have lingering feelings for Yvonne. It was well-known in their circle that Yvonne liked Lucas and often followed him around. But now that Yvonne had lost interest, who’s to say Lucas wouldn’t reminisce about the good times they had? After all, the allure of the unattainable was a common weakness among men.

The more Ava thought about it, the more she wished Yvonne would just disappear. Her anger twisted her features into a furious lion's snarl, a stark contrast to her usually refined demeanor. Her hands clenched the bedspread tightly, her nails digging into the fabric, ripping a hole in it.

Ava couldn't help but fantasize about having her old powers from her past life. Though those abilities were hardly impressive back then, in this world where no one else wielded such power, having them would put her at an advantage...

It seemed some people just wanted to reap rewards without effort. The universe had granted her a chance at rebirth, yet she was intent on sabotaging herself. Did she really think she could recklessly use powers that didn’t belong to this world without attracting attention from the cosmos?

Clearly, some people were determined to self-destruct, no matter how many obstacles appeared in their path.

Ava repeatedly called out to the system in her mind, "System! Are you there? I want to exchange my belief points for the powers I had in my previous life!"

“System is upgrading...”

“System is upgrading...”

No matter how hard Ava called, the system only displayed that it was upgrading. She felt a bit puzzled but brushed it off; she believed that an upgraded system would be more powerful.

However, Ava was resolute in her determination to use her belief points to reclaim the abilities of her past life.

The story continues with Ava navigating her emotions, her relationships, and the mysteries of her newfound existence. With each turn, she faces the challenges that come with her aspirations and the weight of her past.
