Amidst the darkness, in a rundown room, the night was pitch black, with the cold wind howling outside, creating an eerie atmosphere. 

Yu Zhuyi slowly opened his eyes, the dim yellow light casting an enigmatic glow on his exquisite features. He glanced around the empty space, spotting only a few battered chairs scattered about. Realization struck him as he found himself bound to one of those chairs, the ropes digging into his wrists. He struggled, attempting to free himself, but it was a futile effort. Frustration welled up within him as he ultimately surrendered to his predicament. The knots were too tight; he needed to think of another way out.

He remembered that he was supposed to surprise his sister at her office. But then… he recalled following her secretary to find her, only to black out halfway there. It seemed he had been drugged. But why? No one had approached him… 

A fleeting moment of clarity flashed through his mind: he had drunk from a glass of water that the secretary had poured for him. So that was it…

Yu Zhuyi's expression turned grave, worry gnawing at him as he hoped this wouldn’t implicate his sister. 

Lost in thought, the door creaked open, and two unfamiliar figures entered the room. However, the last figure sent a ripple of recognition through him. It was Lu Qiuming.

He should have guessed it was him.

Even in this dire situation, Lu Qiuming’s face remained impassive, void of panic, his delicate features exuding an air of coldness. But inside, he was seething with rage. 

“You probably never imagined you’d end up in my hands, did you? But it serves you right. Who told you to be her boyfriend?!” Lu Qiuming sneered.

Yu Zhuyi remained silent, his calm gaze meeting Lu Qiuming’s eyes. This only stoked the flames of Lu Qiuming’s anger.

With a furious stride, Lu Qiuming lunged forward and kicked Yu Zhuyi hard. Bound to the chair, Yu Zhuyi fell to the ground, his previously tidy clothes now adding a sense of disarray to his appearance.

Lu Qiuming was ready to strike again when he was stopped by a man beside him, Heizi. Confused, Lu Qiuming turned to Zhao Hui, who stood near Heizi, seeking an explanation with his eyes.

“We can’t hurt him anymore right now; we still need him to draw out…” Zhao Hui’s voice trailed off, but Lu Qiuming understood what he meant.

Realizing the purpose behind their actions, Lu Qiuming reluctantly halted his aggression. 

Yu Zhuyi, whose expression had been emotionless until that point, felt a flicker of unease cross his face at Zhao Hui’s words. He could only pray that it wouldn’t be as bad as he feared. 

But fate had other plans.

Lu Qiuming instructed Heizi to make a call. 

“Yu Zhuyi is in my hands. Bring thirty million to the West District building in half an hour, or you’ll face the consequences. Remember, you can only come alone. If you alert the police, then…” 

Heizi’s voice dripped with unmistakable threats. 

On the other end of the line, silence followed Heizi’s words for a few seconds. Then came a voice that Yu Zhuyi had been yearning to hear.

“Why should I trust you? Unless you let me see him first.” Yan Xinfei’s voice was eerily calm, seemingly unfazed by the news of Yu Zhuyi's predicament.

But only Yan Xinfei knew how much she wanted to reach through the phone and eliminate the person holding her Yu Zhuyi captive.

Heizi glanced at Zhao Hui, who nodded. Immediately, Heizi recorded a video and sent it to Yan Xinfei.

As she watched Yu Zhuyi, bound and lying helplessly on the floor, her heart ached for him, unable to suppress the surge of compassion flooding her chest.
