**Malice**

**Chapter 22: Malice**

Lin Yunyun had been keeping a close watch on Yu Zhuyi’s every move. Seeing him so protective of Yan Xinfeng filled her with deep jealousy. She fixed her gaze on the figure at the podium, convinced that she and Yu Zhuyi were meant to be together. Now, this new person had appeared to steal his attention away from her.

Lin Yunyun knew who Yan Xinfeng was; after all, everyone in their circle had heard the rumors about her crush on Lu Xiuming. This only made Lin Yunyun feel more disdainful and bitter. 

In reality, Yu Zhuyi had never paid Lin Yunyun any attention; to him, she was just a stranger. Yet, she fancied herself special in his eyes.

Yan Xinfeng noticed the malicious gaze directed at her. It was impossible to ignore; the intensity of it was palpable. She casually glanced toward the source of the hostility and spotted a sweet-looking girl. If it hadn't been for the intensity of that gaze, she wouldn’t have realized just how much malice the girl held against her. In that moment, she also noticed the way the girl looked at the adorable Yu Zhuyi, filled with affection.

Yan Xinfeng paused for a moment, pretending to be unfazed, thinking to herself: “So it’s true what they say about beautiful women being a source of trouble.” She continued her lecture.

Yu Zhuyi, catching her gaze, immediately broke into a charming smile.

The two-hour lecture wrapped up quickly, leaving many feeling enlightened. A number of boys, blushing, clutched their phones, eager to ask Yan Xinfeng for her contact information.

Seeing this, Yu Zhuyi dashed over, blocking the boys’ advances. “Sister, what are you doing here? You’ve been talking for so long; you must be thirsty! Let me take you for some milk tea,” he said sweetly, grabbing Yan Xinfeng’s hand and leading her out of the classroom.

The boys were left exchanging glances, regretfully putting their phones away. While they had hoped to ask Yan Xinfeng for her number, they hesitated. After all, not only was she stunning, but she also held a prominent status in the capital. Who knew? If they caught her interest, their own family status might soar.

But with Yu Zhuyi blocking their way, they dared not approach.

Zhao Min watched with a pained expression as Yu Zhuyi led Yan Xinfeng away, leaving the two of them behind. He sighed, “He’s really a guy who prioritizes romance over friendship.”

Chao Yixiu chimed in, “Absolutely.”

Yu Zhuyi tugged Yan Xinfeng along, completely ignoring the odd looks from those around them, until they reached a secluded corner away from prying eyes.

Yan Xinfeng curiously watched as Yu Zhuyi held her hand.

Feeling her gaze, Yu Zhuyi’s ears turned crimson, as if he had been scalded, and he quickly let go of her hand. 

“Sorry…sorry… I didn’t mean to, Sister. There were just too many people earlier. Please don’t be angry, okay?” He lowered his head, his hand fidgeting behind him, missing the warmth of her touch.

“It's fine, I’m not angry,” Yan Xinfeng replied, her tone laced with a hint of regret.

His eyes lit up, a flicker of surprise flashing across his face. That brief look didn’t escape her keen observation.

She chuckled softly, thinking to herself: “He’s so easily satisfied.”

“Then, Sister, let me take you for some milk tea.” His true desire was to spend more time with her, having not seen her in a long while.

Outside the school, at the milk tea shop, Yan Xinfeng settled down. “You sit here for a moment; I’ll go buy us some milk tea.”

“Okay.” The shop wasn’t crowded at that time, and Yu Zhuyi quickly made his purchase.

“Here you go, Sister, three parts sugar,” he said, looking at her expectantly. “Do you like it?”

Yan Xinfeng couldn’t help but think he resembled a little puppy waiting for its owner’s praise.

Seeing the anticipation in his eyes, she smiled and replied, “Yes, I like it.” Then she added, “As long as it’s from you, I’ll like it.”

He shyly bowed his head, murmuring, “As long as you like it, that’s enough for me.”
