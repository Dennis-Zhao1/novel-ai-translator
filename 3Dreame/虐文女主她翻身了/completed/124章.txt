Yu Zhuyi lay in her sister’s embrace, initially struggling to break free, but when she realized it was futile, she settled into acceptance. She comforted herself internally: It’s okay, no one saw. After all, no one witnessed this, so it’s fine to let my sister hold me.

Suddenly, a troubling thought crept into her mind. "Sister, you didn’t come alone, did you? Are you hurt?" 

"Mm, no," Yan Xinfeng replied coolly, nodding her head. 

If one overlooked the slight tremor in her sister’s arms as they held her tightly, it would be nearly impossible to tell how much Yan cared for her.

"That’s good to hear. Just don’t put yourself in danger for me again."

"There won’t be a next time." There won’t be another chance for you to get hurt, and I will never leave your side.

Yu Zhuyi didn’t grasp the meaning behind her sister's words; she thought it simply meant there wouldn’t be another risky situation.

Once they exited the room, Yu Zhuyi was taken aback by the sight of several men lying outside, their faces bruised and swollen from the beating they had received. She hadn’t expected her sister to possess such impressive fighting skills.

After leaving the building, the police arrived promptly. A police officer, in his thirties, stepped in front of them.

"Excuse me, are you the one who called the police?"

"Yes, please step aside. This is the victim, and the kidnappers are inside. I’m taking him to the hospital."

The officer paused for a moment before murmuring an apology. 

Yan Xinfeng ignored the police, cradling her little darling as she hurried away. 

They rushed to the hospital, and the officer, observing her anxious demeanor, understood that she was worried about the victim. He would handle the kidnappers inside before heading to the hospital to take their statements.

Upon entering the room, the officer was momentarily speechless. Just moments ago, they had seen a frail girl, and now it seemed she had subdued several burly men. Impressive!

Are girls these days really this strong? He shook his head and led the injured away.

——————————————————————————

After ensuring her little darling was checked by the doctors, Yan Xinfeng was relieved to find he wasn’t seriously hurt, just a few minor injuries. Still, she insisted on keeping him in the hospital for observation.

Yu Zhuyi had no choice but to comply with her sister’s wishes. Thus, Yan Xinfeng stayed by her side in the hospital for two days.

On the first day of Yu Zhuyi’s hospitalization, Officer Liu, who was in charge of the case, had already come to take their statements. 

Once Yu Zhuyi was discharged, Officer Liu informed them that the mastermind behind the kidnapping was Lu Qiuming. He had been desperate because his girlfriend needed a heart transplant and had learned through some channel that Yan Xinfeng’s heart was a match.

It turned out Lu Qiuming initially intended to kidnap Yan Xinfeng, but when that proved difficult, he set his sights on those around her.

Using her connections, Yan Xinfeng anonymously submitted all the evidence of their criminal activities to the police. After all, she was a model citizen, unlike certain people who were clueless about the law.

Did he not know that kidnapping is illegal? And how dare he presume to decide the fate of others and attempt to swap their hearts for someone else’s?

In the end, Lu Qiuming was sentenced to eight years in prison, while the other kidnappers received lighter sentences of six years.

Meanwhile, they also investigated Wen Qingzhi, but due to a lack of direct evidence against her and someone taking the blame on her behalf, she remained unharmed.

Yes, the person who committed the crime for Wen Qingzhi was someone who liked her, and for reasons unknown, he voluntarily took on all the guilt.

Yan Xinfeng couldn’t help but feel a bit dissatisfied with the outcome, but it was the best resolution they could manage.

Her secretary also lost her job for drugging Yu Zhuyi and was considered an accomplice, resulting in a significant loss for her.

It was only later that Yan Xinfeng learned her secretary had drugged Yu Zhuyi out of jealousy, coveting the affection she received from her sister.

This left Yan Xinfeng feeling speechless and a little creeped out. 

She had no issue with homosexuality; in fact, she respected it immensely. Love is a matter of two souls and has nothing to do with gender. 

However, her secretary—oh no, she should be referred to by her name—Yu Xiaoli, didn’t genuinely like her, let alone love her. 

After all, how could someone who truly cares for another hurt the one they love?

Following this incident, Yan Xinfeng treated her little darling even better, sticking close to her side every day, wishing she could shrink him down and keep him in her pocket.
