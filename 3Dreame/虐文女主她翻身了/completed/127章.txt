Zhao Min and Chao Yi Xiu, who entered behind him, paused outside the hospital room, not daring to step inside. They knew that at this moment, Yu Ge didn’t want them to see him like this.

Meanwhile, the old man had also arrived after receiving the news. 

“Hello, Grandpa,” Zhao Min greeted him sweetly, his eyes bright with innocence.

The old man nodded in acknowledgment, his expression serious. 

“How is she?” he asked, concern etched on his face.

“She’s out of life-threatening danger, but she’s still unconscious. It’s possible...” Zhao Min’s voice trailed off, the implication hanging heavily in the air. Everyone present understood the unspoken words behind his hesitation.

The old man couldn’t help but sigh. “Xiao Yi finally found someone to share her life with, and now….”

They watched as the old man stepped into the room. When he came out again, it was unclear what he had said to Yu Zhu Yi.

When Yu Zhu Yi eventually emerged from the hospital room, she seemed to be her usual self. But that calmness was unnervingly unsettling.

Even so, they didn’t dare to ask her anything. They could only quietly keep tabs on her condition from a distance. 

Since that day, Zhao Min and the others had noticed that Yu Zhu Yi was working even harder than before. But one thing remained unchanged: every day, he would visit the room to see Yan Xin Fei.

————————————————

On the other side, Yan Xin Fei jolted awake from her dream, sitting up abruptly. 

She looked around in confusion at the familiar surroundings—this was undeniably her room in the apocalypse. 

How could this be? She distinctly remembered…

Was it all just a dream?

But it felt so real. 

Suddenly, her hand brushed against the ring she had planned to propose with. She grasped it tightly, examining it closely. 

It was exactly the same; the very one she had designed herself. 

So, she really had traveled back in time. 

She recalled being hit by a car and seeing the panicked expression of her beloved just before she lost consciousness. 

If that were the case, how heartbroken must he be now? 

Her heart ached for him. 

Suddenly, she remembered something. 

With slightly disordered steps, she made her way toward the door. 

“Bang!” She collided with someone.

“Yan Jie, where are you off to?” a stylish girl with a commanding presence asked.

Yan Xin Fei didn’t answer her question. Instead, she asked, “Is it still two years into the apocalypse?”

“Yeah, Yan Jie. Are you okay? Did you come back too tired after gathering supplies yesterday?” 

“It’s nothing.” 

With that, Yan Xin Fei brushed past her, drifting back to her room in a daze. 

It turned out she had spent nearly half a year in the book, while only one night had passed here. 

In other words, twelve hours here equated to about six months in the story. 

A few minutes later, she made a decision. 

She wanted to find a way back to her beloved. 

In the following two days, her teammates in the same group noticed that Yan Xin Fei had become extremely busy. 

It seemed as though she had been holed up in the laboratory for nearly two days straight. 

Yan Xin Fei didn’t pay attention to the outside world; while she had powers here, she was not indispensable. 

But her beloved needed her. 

In this world, she had no one to miss. Once she left, it wouldn’t…

…… 

Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, two days had passed. 

Finally, Yan Xin Fei broke into a joyous smile. 

“I did it.” 

She pressed a button and activated her abilities. 

With a flash of white light, the laboratory was suddenly empty. 

And so, there was one less person in this world. 

———————————

In the white hospital room lay a beauty who seemed to be merely sleeping. 

Suddenly, her fingers moved ever so slightly. 

The next moment, she slowly opened her eyes. 

Her gaze locked onto Yu Zhu Yi, who had just pushed the door open and stepped inside. 

Yu Zhu Yi froze, halting his movements, standing there in a daze, his eyes filled with disbelief and joy. 

Yan Xin Fei looked at the young man in a suit standing at the door, noticing how much he had matured. 

She watched him for nearly a minute, but he merely stood there, seemingly unable to step inside. 

She blinked and looked at him with confusion.
