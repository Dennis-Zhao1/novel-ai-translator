**A Tangled Tale**

Once upon a time in a distant land, there was a young girl named Lily, around twelve or thirteen, who was known for her striking beauty. Not long ago, she became one of the guards stationed in a towering castle, tasked alongside her fellow guard, James, with overseeing the highest locked chamber of the fortress where a mysterious prisoner was kept.

Lily had no memories of a life before she woke up in this castle. All she remembered was her name, Lily, and a vague sense of searching for someone important. During her three months in the castle, she had explored every nook and cranny, getting to know everyone, except for the person locked away at the top of the tower. Despite being responsible for the security of that individual, she had never laid eyes on them. If it weren't for the castle lord's persistent reminders to watch over the captive, she might have thought there was no one inside at all.

Deep down, she felt that meeting the person in that chamber would reveal everything she was longing to know.

Lily waited patiently.

One fateful day, everything changed. James, the right guard, unexpectedly revolted, overthrowing the lord and leaving him bleeding on the floor. But that had nothing to do with Lily. James had made her an offer: if she covered for him and claimed the lord had passed his title to him, he would give her the key to the locked chamber.

Lily had little interest in the lordship, so she readily agreed to the deal. Just like that, she effortlessly obtained the key.

Heart racing with a mix of anxiety and excitement, she ascended to the top of the castle. With a soft click, she unlocked the door.

To her astonishment, inside stood a gentle-looking boy, around fourteen or fifteen years old. His presence took her by surprise.

"You're here," he said softly. "I know what you seek."

For reasons she couldn't explain, Lily found herself trusting everything he said.

"I will return to my true form. Come, touch my petals," he urged.

In an instant, the boy transformed into an exquisite flower, pure and flawless, of a type Lily had never seen before. The sight of the flower filled her with warmth, yet she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Why was this boy not human? Why was he locked away?

Tentatively, she reached out, her hand brushing against a delicate petal. The flower quivered slightly at her touch, and suddenly, visions flooded her mind. She saw herself as a noble girl living in the North City, desperately searching for her younger brother, who was just four years old.

Life had once been comfortable for them, with doting parents and a wealthy household. But then, an unfamiliar aunt had appeared, quickly ingratiating herself with her parents, who naively trusted her to care for Lily and her brother.

Unbeknownst to them, this seemingly kind aunt had sinister plans. She intended to have Lily replace her own daughter, sending her to marry a simpleton in the countryside. The aunt, unwilling to part with her own child, set her sights on Lily instead.

Under the guise of a fun outing, she lured them away, using a drug to incapacitate both Lily and her brother. The aunt left bruises on Lily's delicate face, and soon, Lily was taken away, while her brother was abducted by a middle-aged woman.

Tears streamed down Lily's face as she came back to reality.

The boy had returned to human form, gently wiping away her tears with his thumb. He conjured a petal, "Don't cry. I’ll take you back."

Lily wanted to say something, but before she could, darkness enveloped her.

Pain coursed through her body as she struggled to open her eyes. She found herself lying on a cart, alone and vulnerable. Realizing that the drug had been strong enough to keep her unconscious, she had to act quickly.

With no time to waste, she stumbled out of the cart, her heart racing. After running for what felt like an eternity, she spotted her brother, still unconscious, beside the same middle-aged woman.

Carefully, Lily scooped her brother into her arms and fled.

She ran toward the deep mountains, unaware that she was venturing into a remote and uninhabited wilderness…
