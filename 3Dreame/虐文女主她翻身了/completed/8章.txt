Charity Auction

At Di Yun University, three handsome young men strolled through the campus, side by side.

“Hey, Yu!” Zhaomin chuckled, glancing sideways. “What’s up with you lately? You look all spaced out, like you’re in love or something. Have you got your eye on some beautiful girl behind our backs? But that doesn’t make sense since we hang out every day. Wait, what if it’s not a girl but a guy? No way, Yu! You can’t be into guys, can you?”

Yu looked at Zhaomin with indifference, his mind drifting to the captivating girl he had met on Antique Street. After a moment, he replied, “It’s not a guy.”

Zhaomin let out a sigh of relief, patting his chest. “Oh, thank goodness! So, you have someone you like? How is that possible? You’ve been single forever! Don’t run away, Yu!”

Ignoring the fool, Yu turned away and continued walking, leaving Zhaomin bewildered.

Zhaomin nudged the quieter member of their group, Chaoyixiu, and asked, “Hey, do you know who Yu likes? I can’t believe he finally has a crush!”

Chaoyixiu glanced at Zhaomin, a serious expression on his face. “Maybe he met someone in a dream.”

Zhaomin’s eyes lit up with understanding. “Oh, that’s it! I thought Yu had finally found someone. Turns out he’s just dreaming!”

Chaoyixiu shook his head, placing a hand on Zhaomin's shoulder as he guided him away. He thought to himself that while Zhaomin might be silly, it was best not to dwell on his foolishness.

Meanwhile, Yu received a message from his grandfather along with an invitation to the charity auction hosted that evening. Although he despised events filled with socializing, he couldn’t refuse his beloved grandfather’s request. Even if he didn’t want to go, he would attend, treating it like a task to complete.

At the same time, Yan Xinfai also received her invitation to the auction. This charity event was quite renowned, attracting prominent families and influential figures from the capital. Participants would bid on items, and the proceeds would go to charity. In other words, attending this auction was akin to donating money for a good cause.

In previous years, the original owner of the body would use the name of a certain scummy male lead to donate. But this year was different. Yan Xinfai was not the original owner, and there was no way she would spend her money for a jerk. She wasn’t that foolish.

As she entered the venue, she noted that her seat was not far from the auction items. The seating arrangement was based on each family's wealth and status, and being seated in the front row clearly indicated her high standing. 

Once seated, Yan Xinfai noticed that right next to her was the striking man she had encountered on Antique Street. She raised an eyebrow but chose not to speak.

Those around her couldn’t help but feel surprised at the change in her demeanor. It was as if Yan Xinfai had become a more formidable presence. 

After all, it made sense—having come from a post-apocalyptic world where she fought zombies daily, she naturally exuded an aura of authority and resilience.

Yu also spotted the enchanting woman from Antique Street. Through whispered conversations around him, he learned that she was indeed Yan Xinfai. He pondered how to greet her and, after a moment, decided to flash a charming smile and approach her with a soft voice. “Yan Xinfai, what a coincidence! It’s nice to see you again!”

Yan Xinfai nodded in acknowledgment. “It is quite a coincidence.”

Seeing her actually respond made Yu’s heart race with excitement. Blushing, he continued, “I’m here on behalf of my grandfather. Since we seem to have such a connection, can I call you ‘sister’?” 

Yan Xinfai didn’t respond immediately. 

Worried that he might come off as frivolous, Yu quickly added, “Please don’t misunderstand! I don’t mean anything else. I just think it doesn’t suit you to be called ‘Ms. Yan’—it sounds too formal. ‘Sister’ feels more youthful. Is that okay?” His voice turned pitiful as he pleaded.

Yan Xinfai looked at him with interest, sensing his innocent charm. She thought it would be amusing to color him with her own essence. With a light laugh, she replied, “Sure, that sounds fine. After all, you’re quite adorable.”

Those around them were stunned to witness such a warm interaction. Just days ago, Yan Xinfai had been entangled with Lu Xiuming, and now she was treating another man with such kindness. 

Even the notorious troublemaker from the capital was speaking so gently to Yan Xinfai. Yes, gentle—everyone felt as if they were in a dream.
