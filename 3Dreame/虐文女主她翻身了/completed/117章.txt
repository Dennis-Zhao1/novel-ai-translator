**All Blame on Her**

After leaving the banquet, Lily Yu looked a bit worried and asked, “Sister, is it really okay for us to leave like this?”

Eva Yan pinched his cheek playfully. “Don’t worry! The main purpose of today’s banquet was to meet with Mr. Xu and discuss the collaboration between our companies. We’ve already wrapped that up, so we can leave anytime.”

Lily sighed in relief. “That’s good to hear.”

In stark contrast to the warm and harmonious atmosphere on their side, another scene was brewing elsewhere.

As Lucian Liu quickly led Claire Wen away from the banquet, they returned to his car. His face was stormy, and the more he thought about it, the angrier he became. He slammed his fist down on the steering wheel in frustration.

It was all Eva Yan’s fault for making him lose face at the banquet. He dreaded the thought that from this night on, he would become the butt of everyone’s jokes.

Sitting beside him, Claire quietly rubbed her wrist where he had gripped her tightly, leaving a bruise. It hurt like hell, but she didn’t dare complain. After all, Lucian was still fuming, and she definitely didn’t want to provoke him further.

Glancing at Claire, who sat in the passenger seat, Lucian felt a headache coming on. He asked, his tone laden with accusation, “Aren’t you supposed to know Mr. Xu’s daughter? What was that all about? She clearly treated you like a stranger!”

Claire’s heart raced, her face turning pale as she spoke with a quivering voice, “Lucian, I really don’t know what happened. When I first got selected for the reality show, I had a pretty good relationship with Xu Xiaoxiao, but… but…”

She hesitated, looking as if she wanted to say something but was too scared to continue. 

That was exactly what Lucian was waiting for. His curiosity was piqued as he pressed her, “But what? Just say it!”

“Ever since Sister Eva came along, Xu Xiaoxiao stopped talking to me. I don’t know if it’s because of her… no, no, I didn’t say anything!” Claire quickly covered her mouth, panic flashing in her eyes.

“Eva again, I knew it!” Lucian exclaimed, frustration brewing within him.

“But why would Eva do that? She’s already got a new boyfriend now. Even though she used to…” Claire trailed off, her voice fading as she realized she had touched a nerve.

Hearing her mention that, Lucian couldn’t help but feel anger toward Eva. What was she saying about always liking him? It hadn’t been long since she had given up! Now, she had already moved on to someone else.

He scoffed, feeling a mix of relief and resentment. How could she not even hold on for a little while longer? He had thought Eva was different from the others.

And now, the thought that if Eva got married someday, all her assets would go to someone else made him uneasy. He had to do something about it.

As he contemplated this, he noticed Claire beside him. He quickly flashed a gentle smile and reached out to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear. 

“I knew you were too kind-hearted. I won’t blame you for what happened tonight. Don’t be sad, okay?”

“Lucian, you’re so sweet…” Claire responded, her voice softening.

As they exchanged glances, Lucian’s masculine energy surged; he slowly leaned closer to Claire’s rosy lips.

“Hmm~ don’t, someone might see us,” she murmured, pressing against his chest.

“No one will…” Lucian insisted, a hint of impatience in his tone.

Before long, the temperature inside the car began to rise, while the moon above shyly hid behind a layer of clouds.

…&£$&%◆☆@↔☆$£&##€…..

If anyone had been nearby, they would have noticed a luxurious car parked by the roadside.

About an hour later, the moon cautiously peeked out again. Moments later, the luxury vehicle sped away.

【~ Dear readers, don’t get too hung up on where the car is parked; it’s just a plot device for the story ('▽`)/ Wow~】

———————Mini Scene—————————

Claire: Could it be that Eva and Xu Xiaoxiao said something? No way, Sister Eva wouldn’t do that! She really likes Lucian!

Lucian: As expected, my charm is boundless.

Eva: (rolls eyes) Seriously, what a disaster.
