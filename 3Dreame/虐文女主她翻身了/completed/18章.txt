**Saving a Life**

That evening, she boarded a flight back to China. As soon as she settled into her seat, she closed her eyes to rest.

Meanwhile, an amiable elderly man was engaged in conversation with a middle-aged man in his forties. The old man sat upright, his white hair and beard framing a face that bore the marks of a long life, with deep-set wrinkles that told stories of joy and sorrow. His eyes sparkled with vitality, and his voice, deep and resonant, radiated a commanding presence that garnered respect from those around him.

He was the kind of elder whose warmth and kindness were palpable, instantly putting others at ease.

With a hint of frustration in his tone, he lamented, “Look at that rascal back home! He’s always out gallivanting and never comes to see this old man. Claims he’s too busy with work and has no time at the company.”

The middle-aged man sighed in response. “Sir, it’s not that he doesn’t have time for you. Just the other day, he was here at the old house to keep you company. You’ve been visiting old friends, and it’s only today that you’ve returned to China. He just couldn’t find you.”

He continued, “Sir, the young master is working harder than ever. He started his own company during his sophomore year, and it’s thriving! It’s now on par with your own business.”

Though the old man spoke with a note of complaint, pride seeped through his words. “Ah, that rascal has achieved so much at such a young age. I remember when I was his age; I didn’t have such rapid success in building my own company or elevating it to such heights.”

Suddenly, the old man felt a sharp pain in his chest. He clutched at his heart, his complexion paling as cold sweat broke out on his forehead. “Medicine… medicine…” he gasped, before collapsing.

The middle-aged man was taken aback, scrambling to find the old man’s medication, only to discover that it had run out the night before.

In a panic, he pressed the emergency button on the flight and shouted, “Is there a doctor on board? My father has passed out! Please, I need help!”

The commotion and noise echoed around Yan Xinfeng, who turned to see what was happening. Realizing someone had collapsed, she instinctively pushed through the crowd, hoping to lend her assistance.

Upon reaching the elderly man, she quickly assessed the situation. It was critical; without immediate and effective first aid, his condition could worsen dramatically.

“Please, everyone, step back and allow some air!” she called out calmly, stepping forward to perform the emergency procedures.

The middle-aged man, noticing her poise and confidence, felt an inexplicable trust in her abilities. He stepped aside, allowing her to take charge of the situation.

With practiced skill, Yan Xinfeng worked on the elderly man, and soon enough, he began to regain consciousness. After ensuring he was stable and free from serious harm, she quietly slipped away, returning to her seat.

Before long, the flight’s medical personnel arrived. After examining the elderly man, they confirmed that he had stabilized.

“The first aid he received was effective,” one of the medics reported. “The technique used by the person who helped him was remarkably proficient—on par with that of international doctors. If he hadn’t received timely care, his condition could have turned critical. Even if we had arrived later, the chances of a successful recovery would have been significantly lower.” They provided a few follow-up recommendations before departing.

After resting for a moment, the old man asked, “Who was it that helped me?”

The middle-aged man, slightly embarrassed, replied, “It was a young girl who performed the first aid. Things were so urgent at the time that I didn’t think to ask for her name.”
