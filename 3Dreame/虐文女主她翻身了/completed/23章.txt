**Chapter 23: Together**

Little Cutie slurped his milk tea enthusiastically, a blissful smile lighting up his face. As he drank, he stole glances at his sister from the corner of his eye.

Yan Xinfei had noticed his furtive looks from the very beginning, but to spare Little Cutie any embarrassment, she pretended not to see and continued sipping her drink.

After a while, perhaps feeling the heavy silence, Yu Zhuyi mustered the courage to speak, “Sister, um, it’s just that… tonight…”

“Hmm?” Yan Xinfei thought to herself: Little Cutie is way too shy; just asking a question makes him fidget like a bashful little bride. Sigh, only he could be so endearing!

With tears welling in his eyes, he looked up at Yan Xinfei and softly asked, “Can we have dinner and watch a movie together tonight?”

Yan Xinfei didn’t respond right away, considering pretending to refuse just to tease him. But after a moment of silence, she noticed he was silently crying, and it tugged at her heart.

She quickly shook off her thoughts, stood up, and reached out to wipe his tears. 

But to her surprise, the moment he saw her get up, his reaction was intense; a shadow flickered across his eyes, and dark thoughts surged within him: He should lock his sister away, chain her up, so no one could take her away. She would be his forever…

In just a few seconds, countless gloomy thoughts raced through his mind. 

Then, everything halted as Yan Xinfei actually came over to wipe his tears and pulled him into her embrace. 

The sight of a silently crying beauty was heart-wrenching, and Yan Xinfei felt a pang of sympathy at his tears. She only had one thought: Comfort him, don’t let him cry.

Holding him close, she gently wiped his tears and cooed, “What’s wrong? Why are you crying, Little Cutie?”

In her embrace, he sobbed, then suddenly let out a big burp, which made Yan Xinfei chuckle softly.

He sniffled and protested, “I… burp… don’t laugh! I’m not a Little Cutie; I’m a boy!”

“But to me, you will always be my Little Cutie,” Yan Xinfei paused, her voice dropping to a husky whisper as she leaned in closer to Yu Zhuyi, “You are *my* Little Cutie.” She emphasized the word “my” with intention.

In an instant, Yu Zhuyi forgot all about crying, staring at her in disbelief.

He stupidly asked, “Your…?”

“Isn’t it obvious? Am I not making it clear enough?” 

His face lit up with joy as he asked, “Sister, do you like me?” He gazed intently at Yan Xinfei, not daring to blink, afraid he might miss a single expression on her face.

Yan Xinfei affectionately pinched his nose, a fond smile on her face. “Yes, I like you. Don’t you like me?”

Upon hearing her affirmation, Little Cutie's face flushed bright red, like a boiled crab. The more he looked at her, the more he liked her, wishing he could just devour her whole.

He quickly retorted, “I like you, I like my sister!” As he spoke, he felt shy, lowering his voice.

If it weren’t for Yan Xinfei’s keen hearing and their proximity, she would have missed the last few words.

Then, he quickly added, “So now we’re officially boyfriend and girlfriend, right?” His small stature radiated a sense of urgency, as if afraid Yan Xinfei might change her mind.

“Well then, may I ask if my little boyfriend has finished his drink?” 

“Uh-huh, I’m done!” he replied eagerly.

With that, Yan Xinfei took Yu Zhuyi's soft, small hand and led him away.
