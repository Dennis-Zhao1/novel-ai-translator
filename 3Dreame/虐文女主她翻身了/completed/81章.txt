**Playing Chess with Grandpa**

A few minutes later, the old man noticed that his grandson was having the time of his life, completely engrossed in his food and not even glancing in his direction. However, the girl next to Yu Zhuyi, Yan Xinfai, kept looking over, her expression carrying a hint of curiosity.

Yan Xinfai had always been sensitive to the gazes of others. When she sensed the old man’s eyes on Yu Zhuyi, she picked up on it immediately. But since there was no malice in that gaze, she didn't look over right away. Yet, as the old man continued to watch for quite some time, she couldn't help but steal a few glances at him. She found him squinting and making strange faces, which piqued her interest.

Yan Xinfai thought to herself: Grandpa can’t possibly want to eat the little crayfish I peeled for the little cutie, can he? That wouldn’t do at all! I only peel them for him! Besides, the little cutie is so stingy. If I gave the crayfish to Grandpa, wouldn’t the little cutie get upset? Then I’d have to coax him back, and that just won't work!

Her inner monologue was rich and vivid.

Unable to hold back any longer, the old man spoke up, “Little Yi, aren’t you eating a bit too much? I mean, are you overindulging in those crayfish? You know, I’m just worried that too many might not be good for you.”

Upon hearing Grandpa's comment about eating too much, Yu Zhuyi instinctively patted his full, round belly and looked longingly at the few crayfish left on his plate.

“But Grandpa, I usually eat more than this! You never said anything before! I remember you even encouraged me to eat more!” Yu Zhuyi replied, puzzled, as he looked at his grandfather.

The old man's smile faltered, and he couldn't help but sigh inwardly: This brat, who is this all for? Isn’t it for your lifelong happiness? What if your girl thinks you're too high-maintenance because of this? When that happens, who will you cry to? It’s such a worry, even now that he’s grown up. But what can I do? He’s still my grandson.

The old man composed himself and smiled gently at Yu Zhuyi. “Oh, it’s just that I’m worried about little Yan here. She’s been peeling crayfish for you for so long. Little Yi, she hasn’t even eaten enough herself!”

Hearing Grandpa mention Little Yan, Yu Zhuyi and Yan Xinfai both took a moment to register who he was talking about. Realizing it, Yu Zhuyi instinctively turned to Yan Xinfai, a hint of guilt in his voice, “Sister, it’s all my fault. You should eat too!”

Seeing the little cutie’s guilty expression, Yan Xinfai shot a glare at the old man sitting at the head of the table.

The old man was taken aback, a mix of disbelief and amusement washing over him. He hadn’t expected the girl to care so much for his grandson, even at the expense of her own comfort... Knowing this, he felt relieved. It was clear that Yan Xinfai liked Yu Zhuyi, and he could hardly bear to watch them flaunt their affection.

If you were to ask him how he could tell, he’d chuckle and say, “Seriously? It’s obvious! My grandson is clearly the pampered one. Just look at how she takes care of him even after such a short time together. Love is all in the eyes—it’s impossible to fake that kind of warmth. The way Yan Xinfai looks at Yu Zhuyi is undeniably filled with fondness.”

Yan Xinfai softly said, “It’s fine, I’m full. Do you still want to eat more crayfish?”

Her tone implied that if the little cutie did want more, she would immediately peel some for him.

Upon hearing his sister say she was full, Yu Zhuyi felt a wave of relief. He loved the crayfish but was already feeling a bit stuffed. With a hint of regret, he said to Yan Xinfai, “Sister, it’s okay. I’m full; I just haven’t finished what’s on my plate…”

Understanding his dilemma, Yan Xinfai nodded, “I’ll help you, but you owe me a reward.”

Her eyes were fixed on Yu Zhuyi's glossy lips, and what she meant by reward was quite obvious.

Yu Zhuyi’s face flushed red, and he nodded shyly.

Just moments ago, he claimed not to be hungry, but now he was devouring the remaining crayfish on his plate at lightning speed.

Even the old man sitting at the head of the table was left gaping in astonishment.

This kid truly has feelings for his grandson!

Before long, dinner came to an end.

Mo Ziqiao pulled Yu Boming to say goodbye to the old man. “Dad, we have some business at the company, so we’ll be leaving now. We’ll come visit you again when we have time,” Mo Ziqiao said with a smile.

Yu Boming chimed in, “Right, Dad, we’ll be off first.”

The old man didn’t even look at them, merely nodding dismissively to indicate they could leave.

With the cold reception from Grandpa, the forced smiles on Mo Ziqiao and Yu Boming’s faces quickly vanished. Grateful for the old man’s tacit permission, they hurriedly left to avoid further embarrassment.

Just as they turned to leave, they heard the old man, all smiles, say to Yan Xinfai, “Little Yan, do you know how to play chess? Let’s play a few rounds!”

Indeed, the old man not only had a fondness for collecting inkstones and brushes but also enjoyed playing Chinese chess. He often dragged Yu Zhuyi into matches, but whenever Yu Zhuyi was on the brink of winning, he’d conveniently call it quits—classic cheating.

Even with Yu Zhuyi’s good temperament, he couldn’t tolerate such antics. Upon hearing that his grandfather wanted to play chess with Yan Xinfai, he silently lit a candle for his sister in his heart.

“I know how to play. Sure,” Yan Xinfai replied succinctly to the old man.

Thus, the grandfather and Yan Xinfai sat down in the living room to play chess, leaving Yu Zhuyi staring in confusion.

He couldn’t help but smile helplessly.

Twenty minutes later, Yu Zhuyi was astonished to hear nothing but laughter resonating from the living room.

His sister could make Grandpa so happy!

Curiosity piqued, he couldn’t help but walk over to see what was happening.

He watched as Grandpa’s eyes lit up with delight as he made a move, capturing Yan Xinfai’s piece.

Yan Xinfai, unfazed, simply smiled and moved a pawn.

Grandpa chuckled, shifting his cannon’s position.

Yan Xinfai appeared to ponder for a moment before capturing Grandpa’s piece with her knight.

Yu Zhuyi, observing quietly, thought about how the old man was at a disadvantage. It was clear to him—the old man was about to lose this game.

And soon enough, it came to pass.

“Ha ha, Little Yan, you’re amazing! You really know how to play chess!” Grandpa exclaimed.

Yu Zhuyi was surprised to see Grandpa lose but surprisingly didn’t feel angry at all.

Yan Xinfai humbly smiled, “I only know a bit.”

She genuinely felt her chess skills weren’t that great, but to the old man, her modesty made him like her even more. Meanwhile, he grew increasingly dissatisfied with his grandson, convinced that Yu Zhuyi didn’t deserve someone as wonderful as her. He couldn’t fathom what others saw in his “brat.”

If Yu Zhuyi could hear his grandfather’s thoughts, he would definitely question whether he was truly the old man’s grandson!
