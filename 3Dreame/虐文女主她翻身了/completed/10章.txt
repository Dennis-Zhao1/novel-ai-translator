**Feeling a Little Down**

Yvonne Heart had saved Yuki Zhu as "Little Cutie" in her WeChat contacts. When she returned home around 11 PM, she received a message from Yuki.

"(*＾ワ＾*) Did you get home, Sister?"

"Sister, I bet you’re back already."

"Sister, don’t forget to eat and get some rest."

"Sister…"

Yvonne glanced at her phone and, after a moment of hesitation, replied, "Yeah, I’m home. I ate. You too."

"Sister, you finally replied to me…" Yuki hugged his phone, his face flushed with excitement and shyness. But then he recalled the gossip circulating in their circle—how "Yvonne Heart" had a crush on Luke Xiuming, always chasing after him, while Luke had made it clear he wasn't interested in Yvonne. Yet, Yvonne seemed willing to play the role of his devoted admirer.

But Yuki refused to believe his sister was that kind of person. Surely, she wouldn’t fall for someone like Luke; if she were to like anyone, it should be someone like him. But doubts crept in—what if she really did like that type? After all, Luke had a way of charming young girls. Was it possible that his sister had fallen for his tricks? The more he thought about it, the more logical it seemed. Yvonne was such a smart person; if she had uncovered Luke's true nature, how could she still like him? Yuki wanted to ask her about it, but he felt he didn’t have the right to inquire, especially since he had only just officially met her today. He spent the entire evening feeling frustrated and conflicted.

On the other hand, Yvonne noticed Yuki had stopped messaging her and decided to focus on her training, absorbing the essence of nature to enhance her abilities. By the time she finished, it was already 1 AM, so she headed to bed.

The next morning, Yuki woke up early and sent Yvonne a message: "Sister, good morning!"

"Sister, are you up yet?"

After a long wait without a response, he sent another message: "Sister, don't forget to have breakfast!"

But still, there was no reply.

He felt a twinge of disappointment… but quickly shook it off. He believed that as long as he persisted and gradually integrated himself into his sister's life, she would eventually come to like him.

Around 9 AM, Yvonne finally woke up, lingering in bed for a bit before picking up her phone to check for any important messages. To her surprise, she saw the early messages from Yuki. As she read them, she imagined how cute he must have looked while typing and found it quite amusing.

After replying to him, Yvonne went to brush her teeth and wash her face before preparing a simple breakfast. After all, Little Cutie had reminded her to eat. She didn’t want to disregard his thoughtful gesture. She felt that if she didn’t, he might end up crying, looking so obedient and fragile. But, she thought, he’d probably look adorable when he cried, especially when…

The more Yvonne thought about it, the more her heart raced. Indeed, Little Cutie was exactly her type.

Meanwhile, Luke Xiuming, having noticed Yvonne’s lack of contact, spent these days with his heart’s white moonlight—though it felt a bit odd without her around. He arrogantly believed that Yvonne couldn't do without him.

He received a work report from his secretary, Cheng, stating that Yvonne hadn’t participated in the charity auction under his name the previous night. Shocked, he felt a sudden fear of losing something important and thought about reaching out to Yvonne. Just then, he received a call from Wen Qingzhi.

"Xiuming Ge, I’m sick. Can you come see me?"

Upon hearing this, Luke immediately asked which hospital she was in and rushed over, putting aside his earlier thoughts.
