She didn’t really believe it.

Yan Xinfei was pretending to listen seriously to the little cutie speaking, but deep down, she was wondering what she could find in the space to give to her grandfather tonight. She focused her consciousness into the space, scanning through the little items piled up in the corner.

Suddenly, she spotted a dusty Duan inkstone in the corner of the space. 

Perfect! She would give this inkstone to her grandfather.

The Duan inkstone was one of the four great famous inkstones from this world, with a history dating back over a thousand three hundred years. Renowned for its solid stone quality, smoothness, and delicacy, the Duan inkstone was a favorite among scholars. When ground with ink, it flowed easily, producing a fine ink that didn’t damage the brush, and the color remained vivid over time. No matter the season, whether in the sweltering summer or the biting winter, the inkstone would remain cool to the touch, the ink green and blue, retaining moisture for a long time. 

Thus, she felt that gifting the Duan inkstone to her grandfather was the most suitable choice.

The author of this book must be from the same country as her, as many cultural elements within the story aligned with those from her own world. This familiarity made it easier for her to select gifts without worrying that the items she chose wouldn’t exist in this universe.

Having settled on a gift for her grandfather, she still needed to find something to wrap the inkstone in. She continued to search with her consciousness and soon discovered a seemingly plain yet truly valuable rosewood box.

This will do perfectly to hold the inkstone! It would serve as a wonderful first meeting gift for the little cutie's grandfather. Although it might not be the most precious item, it would at least show that she put thought into it.

Once she packed everything neatly, she placed it back in the space, planning to take it out when she met her grandfather later.

When she finally tuned back into her surroundings, she realized that she and the little cutie were already seated in the car.

Yan Xinfei turned to ask, “Have you decided which amusement park we’re going to?”

Yu Zhuyi looked at her with a puzzled expression. “Sister, didn’t I just tell you which amusement park we’re going to? And you nodded and said it sounded good! Did you not listen to me at all?” His tone grew increasingly aggrieved towards the end.

On the surface, Yan Xinfei appeared calm, but inwardly she was a bundle of nerves. 

“No, I didn’t! How could I not?” she quickly denied, adding a serious expression, “I’m just asking you again. I obviously remember which amusement park you mentioned earlier.”

She thought to herself: Stay calm. As long as I don’t say anything, the little cutie won’t realize I wasn’t paying attention to him earlier.

Yu Zhuyi nodded in understanding. “Oh, I see now, sister.”

Yan Xinfei suddenly switched topics. “By the way, I’m feeling a bit tired. How about you drive today?”

There was no way around it; she truly had no idea which amusement park the little cutie had mentioned. She couldn’t just randomly drive to one; that would expose her.

As she pondered, she switched seats with Yu Zhuyi, taking the passenger seat. 

Though he felt a bit puzzled, Yu Zhuyi didn’t dwell on it. After all, he was thrilled to finally have the chance to drive and let his sister sit in the passenger seat.

He was so excited he could hardly contain himself, barely noticing anything else.

“Hey, sister, how are you feeling? Should we skip the amusement park today and just rest at home instead?” he asked with genuine concern.

Hearing the little cutie’s worry made her feel a bit guilty, but she maintained a deadpan expression. “I’m fine, really! I just didn’t feel like driving. Now, let’s go! Time to set off.”

Surprisingly, Yu Zhuyi didn’t notice her obvious attempt to change the subject, which was a relief for her.

As Yan Xinfei watched the little cutie drive, she was taken aback when they arrived at an amusement park owned by her company.

She looked at him in astonishment.

“What’s wrong, sister? This is one of the hottest amusement parks around! I heard it was just built not long ago!” he exclaimed, completely unaware.

While planning, he had seen many recommendations for this amusement park online.

The little cutie probably didn’t realize this was actually her park, she thought. She remembered this amusement park was originally a project initiated by the original host to please her dog-like male lead. If the project had followed the original host's plan, it would have been a guaranteed loss because she was more interested in winning the male lead’s favor than making money.

However, when she first took over the original host, the project was only halfway completed, so she immediately revised it. With just a few adjustments to the later plans, she transformed what would have been a money-losing venture into a profitable one.

“It’s nothing. I just think this amusement park is quite nice.”

“Oh, really? I think the person who built this park must have a great sense of childlike wonder!” Yu Zhuyi replied earnestly.

Yan Xinfei couldn’t help but ponder: How did he come to that conclusion? 

“Where did you get the idea that the person who built this amusement park is childlike?” she asked, genuinely curious.

Yu Zhuyi answered matter-of-factly, “Of course, because they built an amusement park! Doesn’t that mean they must be a very whimsical person?”

Yan Xinfei couldn’t resist correcting him. “Don’t you think they built the amusement park to make money?”

Yu Zhuyi looked unconvinced. “It doesn’t seem like it. Can amusement parks really make that much money?”

Suddenly, Yan Xinfei fell silent, her mind racing with thoughts. What if the little cutie discovered that she was the one behind this amusement park? That would be a disaster.

She had to maintain her composure.

Casually, she redirected the conversation, “So, what attractions do you want to try out later?”

Sure enough, as soon as she asked that, the little cutie’s attention shifted completely.

“I want to ride the roller coaster, the carousel, the pirate ship, the trampoline… oh, and I definitely want to go on the Ferris wheel! I heard that when couples kiss at the top, they can be together forever.”

“Really?” Yan Xinfei asked, her straightforwardness making her curiosity evident.

Thus, the little cutie began to share the legends surrounding the Ferris wheel.

According to legend, the Ferris wheel was meant for couples. Each time it made a complete rotation, a pair of lovers on Earth would kiss. Every compartment of the Ferris wheel was filled with happiness. The wheel existed so that people could soar into the sky with their loved ones. When the Ferris wheel reached its highest point, if two lovers shared a sincere kiss, the gods would hear their wishes and grant them, allowing them to be together forever.

Yan Xinfei couldn’t help but scoff inwardly. Gods? If they truly existed, then why did no one come to the rescue of those praying for salvation as they faced death?

Why wouldn’t the gods extend their mercy to help the world she was in?

Unaware of her thoughts, Yu Zhuyi noticed only that her expression had turned cold, assuming she simply wasn’t interested in such matters. 

Therefore, he quickly changed the subject. “Sister, do you want some water? I can go buy you a bottle.” He started to stand up.

Realizing her expression had alarmed the little cutie, she grabbed his wrist gently, softening her demeanor. “No need to buy anything.”

Pausing, she added, “Let’s go ride the Ferris wheel later.”

Yu Zhuyi understood her intention. Although his face didn’t show much change, his eyes sparkled with excitement.

“Okay, sister.” 

And so, the adventure began...
