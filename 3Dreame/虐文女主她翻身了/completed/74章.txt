**Chapter 74: All Kissed Up!!!**

Yana gently ruffled the soft hair of her adorable little companion. With a smile in her eyes, she said, "Let’s go ride the Ferris wheel now; I’ve already bought the tickets."

"Mm-hmm, sounds good!" Yu Zhi eagerly nodded like a little chick pecking at rice.

They arrived at the ticketing area for the Ferris wheel. Towering high above them, the Ferris wheel was adorned with transparent glass cabins, each capable of holding a few guests. It was said that anyone who looked up at the Ferris wheel was gazing at happiness.

Yana and Yu Zhi stepped into one of the cabins together. As the Ferris wheel slowly ascended, Yu Zhi marveled at how the ground was becoming further away, allowing them to overlook the scenic views below. The sensation was quite subtle.

Yana, somewhat distracted, watched the shrinking scenery outside the window. She noticed the people on the ground becoming smaller and smaller, realizing how insignificant humans could be in this vast world, yet simultaneously how magnificent they were.

In her ear, Yu Zhi excitedly shouted, "Sister, sister, look how beautiful it is!" He pointed at the fireworks that had unexpectedly burst into bloom in the distance.

Yana gazed at the dazzling fireworks sparkling in the night sky, reminiscent of a fairy descending to dance gracefully, gathering flowers in a basket; plucking vibrant blooms while strumming a pipa as the sound of firecrackers shattered the night’s tranquility, painting the sky in breathtaking beauty. Yet, no matter how brilliant the fireworks were, they would eventually fade into tiny stars scattered across the sky, soon to be forgotten.

She softly replied, "Yeah, it’s beautiful." In her heart, she noted that her little companion loved fireworks.

Minutes later, the Ferris wheel finally reached its peak. Yana hadn’t quite processed the moment when Yu Zhi unexpectedly leaned in, wrapping his arm around her neck and kissed her.

His kiss was shy and innocent, filled more with tenderness than the fervor that Yana displayed. It felt like a sweet puppy licking her lips, utterly endearing.

Just as Yu Zhi was about to pull away, Yana snapped back to reality and swiftly reached out, cradling his head in her hand and pressing him firmly against her lips. The motion was tinged with urgency and intensity.

Yu Zhi let out a soft, "Mm~," but the sound was quickly smothered by Yana's kiss. His eyes looked up at her with a mix of bewilderment and desire, slowly responding to her cool, soft lips.

As their kiss deepened, Yu Zhi felt a flush creeping up his cheeks and neck, the warmth escalating around them, punctuated by the crackling sounds of fireworks in the distance. 

After a long while, as they finally broke apart, Yu Zhi was left breathless, his cheeks flushed, eyes glistening with unshed tears, reflecting the springtime warmth. Meanwhile, Yana felt an insatiable yearning, her gaze fixated on the tantalizing softness of his lips.

However, seeing Yu Zhi's sweet, startled expression made her restrain herself. She reached out to smooth out his slightly disheveled clothes, while also taking a moment to steady her own breath and quell the thrill within her.

Soon enough, the Ferris wheel completed its rotation, and as the cabin doors opened, Yana wrapped her arm around the slightly wobbly Yu Zhi and guided him outside. 

Leaning down, her lips hovered tantalizingly close to his ear. "Shall we head back now?" Her warm breath brushed against his ear, making him want to shy away, but there was no place to hide.

Feeling bashful, he replied softly, "Mm."

A light laugh escaped Yana’s lips, and Yu Zhi buried his face in her embrace. 

As they walked, she half-hugged him, noting how soft his waist felt against her. Once they reached the parking area and got into the car, Yana bent down, lifted Yu Zhi's chin, and suddenly kissed him fiercely.

The unexpected kiss hit Yu Zhi like a storm, leaving him momentarily stunned. (Feel free to imagine the scene ●▽●)

Unable to resist, Yu Zhi closed his eyes, wrapping his delicate left hand around Yana’s neck in response, while his right hand rested gently on her collarbone.

Initially, Yana’s hands were timidly caressing the soft flesh at his waist, but gradually, they grew bolder, slipping beneath the hem of his shirt.

Yu Zhi was lost in the sweetness of her kiss, but when Yana’s cool fingertips brushed against his warm skin, he snapped back to reality, pushing her away gently as a clear signal of refusal.

Understanding his hesitation, Yana immediately withdrew her hand, settling it back on his waist, believing she was behaving appropriately. Yet, Yu Zhi could still feel her hands grazing the soft flesh at his sides, igniting a wave of shyness within him.

After about fifteen minutes, noticing that Yu Zhi was reaching his limit, Yana finally released him. She fastened his seatbelt, rolled down the window to let in some cool air, and started the car to drive away.

Yu Zhi touched his slightly swollen lips, shooting her a look filled with accusation. 

Sensing his reproach, Yana felt a twinge of guilt, but quickly dismissed it. Why should she feel guilty? Wasn’t he her boyfriend? Wasn’t kissing normal for couples?

The more she thought about it, the more justified she felt. But for now, she needed to soothe her little companion. 

"Come on, I promise I won’t do it again next time."

"Hmph! You dare say that again? Sister, look how swollen my lips are! We still have to go back to the old house tonight for dinner with grandpa!"

"I misspoke; I swear there won’t be a next time! Don’t worry; grandpa won’t notice at all."

"Hmph!"

After saying this, Yu Zhi turned his head to look out the window, ignoring her. 

Yana noticed that he didn’t seem as angry anymore and focused on driving. 

It was said that every cabin on the Ferris wheel was filled with happiness. When we gaze up at the Ferris wheel, we’re looking at happiness itself. The higher the Ferris wheel goes, the higher happiness is. After the rain washes the Ferris wheel, it carries a sacred aura; couples riding it can enjoy a lifetime of sweetness. As it moves, the droplets of water from the wheel fall down, splashing onto the romantic passersby below, bringing them happiness. The Ferris wheel itself is a beacon of joy, and the rain is an angel sent from above. Together, they create a blend of happiness, don’t you think? — From "Rainy Love."
