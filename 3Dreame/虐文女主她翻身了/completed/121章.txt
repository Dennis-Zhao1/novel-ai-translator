Wen Qingzhi kept her head down, her expression unreadable. After a long pause, as if she had made a decision, she slowly reached for her phone resting on the nearby table. 

Dialing a number, she said, "Hello, it's me."

"Whoa, a rare caller! I thought you’d never call me in your life!" the voice on the other end responded cheerfully. 

"I need you to do me a favor. You can set any conditions you want..." 

…………………………&#♦&#√&€~#☆€………… 

At that moment, Wen Qingzhi was consumed by a haze of anger, completely forgetting the events that had just transpired at the banquet. The conversation continued, and whatever was said on the other end seemed to cast a shadow over her eyes. 

"Alright, I need you to do this for me, and don’t let me down." 

……

Later that evening, Yan Xinfeng found herself being followed again as she strolled through the antique street. A cold glint flashed in her eyes; she didn’t even need to guess who had sent these people after her. 

She had no intention of engaging with them and quickly made her way toward a dark, deserted alley. The followers exchanged glances, their faces lighting up with excitement; she was truly asking for trouble. They quickly followed her in. 

Once in the alley, one scruffy-looking man cursed, "Where the hell did she go?"

"I don't know, she definitely walked in here just now," another man beside him replied, equally confused. 

Just then, a clear, ethereal voice broke through the darkness. "Are you looking for me?"

They jumped back, startled. "How did she get behind us?"

"How should I know?" the man who had been cursing snapped back at his companion. 

"Let me guess who sent you," Yan Xinfeng continued, indifferent to their confusion. "Was it Wen Qingzhi or Lu Xiuming?" 

"Cut the crap. Are you going to surrender quietly or..." 

Or what? It was obvious what they meant. 

"Since that’s the case, why don’t you all come at me together?" 

"Come at you together?" 

They exchanged glances, a glint of depravity in their eyes as they realized just how naive she was. 

The next moment, half a minute later, the alley was filled with two bruised figures lying on the ground, completely out of it. 

"Tsk tsk tsk, you really can’t handle a beating," Yan Xinfeng shook her head, turning to leave. 

Back at her car, she dialed a number. "I want to report a crime. There are people here..." 

Fifteen minutes later, those men were honorably taken away by the police. 

"Who called in the report?" one of the officers inquired. 

Yan Xinfeng had just stepped out of her car and stood waiting as the police arrived. 

"It was me." 

The officer glanced at her, surprised. He hadn’t expected the caller to be her. After all, she appeared far too composed, not at all like someone who had just encountered trouble. 

"Alright, please come with us to give a statement." 

"Sure." 

So, Yan Xinfeng followed them. 

When she finally walked out of the police station an hour later, the scene was quite different. 

————————小剧场———————— 

The officer remarked, "Wow, you’re incredible!" with an expression of admiration. 

Yu Zhuyi chimed in, "Get lost! Who gave you the right to call her that? She’s my sister!" 

Then Yu Zhuyi jumped into Yan Xinfeng’s arms, exclaiming, "Sister, you’re mine!" 

The officer could only shake his head, thinking, "What a mess! I've just been forced to swallow a whole bowl of dog food."
