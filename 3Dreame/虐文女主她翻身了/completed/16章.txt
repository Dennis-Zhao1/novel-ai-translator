### Chapter 16: The School Forum

As Yu Zhuo walked along the tree-lined path of the school, he couldn't help but reflect on the little moments he shared with his sister earlier that day. A smile unconsciously spread across his face, warm and genuine.

Suddenly, he was blocked by a sweet-looking girl. He frowned and chose to ignore her. Lin Yuyan, noticing that Yu Zhuo was completely disregarding her, raised her voice in frustration. "Zhuo Ge, the photos on the school forum must be someone’s rumors, right?"

Yu Zhuo replied impatiently, "First, I'm not that familiar with you, so please don’t call me that. Also, I don’t have a sister. Second, whether it’s true or not is none of your business. Move aside and stop blocking my way!" With that, he walked away without looking back.

Lin Yuyan’s face twisted in anger, her hands balled into fists, digging her nails into her palms, but she felt no pain. She thought of herself as the school belle, convinced that there was no one more beautiful than her in this school, and that no one had the right to stand beside him but her. Based on her observations, he kept a distance from all girls, which only fueled her determination.

Moreover, her father had business dealings with his company. She believed that this connection would earn her some favor in his eyes, and she planned to slowly win him over. She was confident that he would eventually see her as more than just a classmate. 

Yet, she hadn’t anticipated the sudden emergence of a rival. It was clear to anyone that his attitude toward that woman was different. A sense of panic washed over her; she knew she had to do something.

With a dark glint in her eyes, she thought, "If it’s going to be like this, then don’t blame me." Fuming, she stormed off.

Later, Yu Zhuo returned to the classroom, only to be greeted by Zhao Min, who playfully punched him on the shoulder. Yu Zhuo shot him a cold glare, causing Zhao Min to freeze momentarily before retracting his hand and scratching his head. "Hey, bro, I’m just happy for you! The school forum says you have a girlfriend now. When are you going to bring her around to introduce her to us? She’s not from our school, is she? Or…"

Yu Zhuo’s voice dripped with sarcasm as he replied, "What, are you eager to meet her? Do you like her?"

Sensing the threat in his tone, Zhao Min quickly defended himself. "Come on, Yu! You know me! I’m just curious about who could possibly capture your attention." He added with a grin, "Let’s talk again once you two are officially together."

Zhao Min’s eyes widened in disbelief. "Wait, are you telling me there’s actually someone out there who doesn’t like you?"

In their school, it seemed like as long as Yu Zhuo was around, no one else mattered, for all the girls’ eyes were on him.

Yu Zhuo chose to ignore him, while Chao Yixiu nudged Zhao Min, signaling him to stop hopping around on the edge of Yu Zhuo’s temper—he didn’t want to get punched.

Yu Zhuo took a seat far from the lecture podium, with Zhao Min and Chao Yixiu sitting beside him. He opened the school forum on his phone and immediately spotted a photo from lunch with his sister earlier. It featured him getting into her car, although her face was somewhat obscured, only a silhouette visible. Yet, it was enough to showcase her stunning beauty.

His own face was captured clearly, the joy radiating from him unmistakable. He didn’t mind at all; in fact, he wished the whole world would believe he and his sister were in a romantic relationship.

Not wanting to dwell on it any longer, he exited the forum and opened WeChat to message his sister.

*Little Cutie*: "Sister, I’m back."

*Sister Mine*: "I’m glad you had fun. If you liked it, we can go out to eat again next time."

*Little Cutie*: "Really? Can we? Then I’ll thank you in advance!"

*Sister Mine*: "Mm."

*Little Cutie*: "('`)/ Wow~"

Yu Zhuo had been waiting for that response, which meant they’d have another chance to meet, providing them with ample reasons to see each other again.

And through their interactions, he found himself liking her even more. He believed she wouldn’t be interested in someone like Lu Xiuming. After all, he was better than Lu Xiuming in every way—wealthier, kinder, and even younger. He was confident he could make his sister’s heart flutter.
