**Transformed into the Female Lead of a Tragic Novel**

“CEO, Mr. Lu wants to see you.” 

A slim-faced woman with gold-rimmed glasses, dressed in a professional outfit, asked the striking woman sitting in the president's office. 

The CEO was an exceptionally tall and slender beauty, exuding an air of cold elegance. Even when she remained expressionless, just reading the documents in her hand, one could sense her natural authority. 

She glanced at her secretary, her voice frosty, “Lu Qiuming? No way! Next time he comes to the company, stop him at the door. Don’t let him upstairs.” 

With that, she returned to studying the document. 

The secretary was momentarily captivated by her beauty: raven-black hair, skin as smooth as jade, and enchanting eyes that sparkled with intelligence. Every movement she made seemed to radiate an indescribable charm. 

Then she heard, “Hmm? Is there something else?” 

That alluring voice sent a shiver of excitement through the secretary, igniting a feeling of infatuation deep within her. 

It was evident that the CEO was the dream woman of all the employees at the company. Her disdain for Mr. Lu only made her more commanding. 

The secretary stammered, “But, but you canceled two important meetings today just to have dinner with him…” 

Yan Xinfai rubbed her temples, frustrated. So this was the mess left by the original owner—sacrificing her company’s interests for that scoundrel. With a resigned sigh, she said, “Reschedule those two meetings.” 

“Understood, CEO.” 

The secretary hurried out of the office. 

Yan Xinfai slowly closed her eyes, realizing this was no dream. 

Yes, just last night she had been in a post-apocalyptic world, but upon waking, she found herself transmigrated into a novel she had read—a tragic story bearing her same name. A friend had recommended it to her after noticing the coincidental name match. 

While reading, she had felt anger toward the original character for everything she had done for the scummy male lead. 

In this tragic novel, the character also named Yan was the head of the Yan family, gifted with talent and beauty. Yet, she was blinded by her infatuation with the male lead, pursuing him relentlessly, only to be betrayed. This resulted in her company going bankrupt and her ending up on the streets. 

In a cruel twist, she even had to sacrifice her heart for the male lead’s first love, dying on the operating table without anyone to claim her body. 

In reality, the male lead never truly loved her; he was merely reminded of his first love by her. Throughout their interactions, he found her increasingly repulsive despite taking advantage of her feelings and her family’s wealth, ultimately stealing confidential information from her company, leading to her downfall. 

After her bankruptcy, the male lead learned that the original character’s heart was a match for his first love, who needed a transplant. He kidnapped her to use her heart for that purpose, leaving her to die in surgery. After her death, he claimed to have developed feelings for her, but ultimately returned to his first love, justifying their relationship by saying that since Yan was dead, they should continue living well. 

Yan Xinfai had crossed over from two years into the apocalypse, where she possessed spatial powers, mental abilities, and wind manipulation. Among the supernatural, she was a standout. 

Yet, in the apocalypse, food was scarce, water was nearly nonexistent, and societal order had crumbled, revealing the darker side of humanity. 

Being the female lead in a tragic novel at least meant she could solve her basic needs and no longer worry about food. 

But why had she woken up as this tragic character? 

Well, since she was here, she might as well make the best of it. She would not let the original character's unfortunate fate unfold in her life.
