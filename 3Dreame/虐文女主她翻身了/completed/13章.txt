Eating

Yann Xinfei looked at him with a teasing smile and asked, “Are you feeling hot? Should I lower the air conditioning even more?”

The adorable boy was so startled that he couldn’t meet her gaze, his eyes darting around nervously. “N-no… I’m not hot. Just a little warm, no need to adjust the AC.”

Yann Xinfei feigned regret, saying, “Oh, alright then.” She focused back on driving, her thoughts racing. This little cutie really couldn’t handle being flirted with; if he got too shy and ran away, it wouldn’t be nearly as fun.

Seeing her intent on the road, he let out a silent sigh of relief, forcing himself to look out the window at the passing scenery, trying to shake off the awkwardness from earlier. Gradually, the heat on his face subsided, though if one looked closely, they would still notice that his earlobes were a deep shade of red.

In reality, through the rearview mirror, Yann Xinfei could clearly see his expressions and movements. He thought she wasn’t watching him, but she was.

Before long, he recognized the road and asked, “Sister, where are we going to eat?”

Yann Xinfei replied, “To the Cloud Pavilion. Do you like it? I think you’ll enjoy it.” She almost added that he looked delicious and was a perfect fit for that place, but thought better of it, fearing it might embarrass him.

The two fell into a comfortable silence as they continued on their way, the atmosphere exceptionally harmonious, as if no one dared to interrupt.

“Miss Yann, is it the usual today?” The receptionist greeted with a professional smile.

Yann Xinfei nodded and pulled out her black membership card from the esteemed establishment. This black card wasn’t something anyone could get just by having money; one needed a certain status and a history of significant spending at the restaurant before they could purchase one.

For instance, Lu Qiuming only had an ordinary membership card and wasn’t qualified for the black card.

Those holding a black card could dine in soundproof private rooms, while ordinary members were limited to regular dining areas.

Her smile grew brighter as she led Yann Xinfei, saying, “Please follow me.”

The boy’s face lit up with surprise. “Sister, you actually have a black membership card here…”

Yann Xinfei replied playfully, “Do you like this place? I could get you one if you want. Then you can come here often.”

“No, no, it’s fine! Thanks, but it wouldn’t be fun to come here alone,” he said, secretly wishing he could often enjoy meals with her.

Yann Xinfei took his words at face value, interpreting it as, “You can bring your friends here often.”

He forced a smile, reluctantly agreeing.

Yann Xinfei, perceptive as she was, noted that his enthusiasm seemed low, but didn’t pry further, assuming he wasn’t used to such upscale places and felt out of place.

In truth, the Cloud Pavilion was merely one of the Yu family’s businesses. He didn’t frequent the place enough for people to recognize him.

Lu Qiuming had also arrived at the restaurant with some business partners, seated in a regular private room directly across from where Yann Xinfei was.

They had arrived a bit earlier than her.

When Yann Xinfei entered her room, Lu Qiuming thought he saw a familiar figure, but by the time he focused, she had already disappeared inside. All he caught was a glimpse of the man following her and instinctively dismissed the thought of it being Yann Xinfei; she wouldn’t be dining with another man.

His business partner noticed Lu Qiuming's distraction and asked, “What are you looking at, Lu?”

He turned his gaze back, realizing there was nothing to see. “Sorry, I thought I spotted someone I knew. Let’s get back to our discussion.”

“Sure… then you look at this…”

“Alright…”

Yann Xinfei entered her room and began ordering. She handed the menu to the boy, but he didn’t take it, saying, “Sister, you can just order.”

Yann Xinfei asked, “Do you have any dislikes?”

Yuzhu Yi replied, “None, as long as it’s what you choose.”

Yann Xinfei didn’t press further but instinctively avoided ordering anything spicy, believing he wouldn’t be able to handle it.

Before long, the dishes were ordered, and a few minutes later, they began arriving one by one.

She didn’t miss the spark of surprise in the boy’s eyes when he saw the food.

“Sister, you’re amazing! You ordered all my favorites!”

Yann Xinfei smiled softly, not saying much, but her eyes gleamed with affection.
