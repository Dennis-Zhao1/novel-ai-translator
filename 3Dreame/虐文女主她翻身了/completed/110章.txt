Xiao Yu collapsed to the ground, enduring the pain coursing through her body. She could hardly believe that Zhao Shao would actually say something like that, and the man who barged in had the audacity to take action.

Chao Yixiu felt the throbbing at his temples, his heart racing with a mix of anger and concern. He cast a fleeting glance at Lin, the manager, who stood nervously at the side, too afraid to speak up.

"You know how this should be handled!" he snapped.

"Y-yes... I will definitely give you a satisfactory answer," Lin replied, his voice trembling with fear.

Then, he turned to Xiao Yu, who was barely managing to get back on her feet. "From now on, you don’t need to come back to work here."

Xiao Yu's heart sank. "Manager Lin, I—"

Before she could plead her case, Lin ruthlessly interrupted her. "You don’t need to say more. This is the lightest punishment for you."

She looked at him in disbelief. What did it mean to be given the lightest punishment? Being let go from this job would ruin her chances of finding work elsewhere; no other bar would hire someone who had been dismissed from here. All she had done was serve Zhao Shao a drink that had been spiked; she hadn’t even done anything with him!

She was still clinging to her illusions. Little did she know, if something had actually happened between her and Zhao Shao, she wouldn’t be facing mere dismissal.

While Lin’s punishment wasn’t the harshest, it was enough to somewhat satisfy Chao Yixiu. He chose to ignore the expressions of everyone else in the room.

He bent down and scooped Zhao Min into his arms, cradling him as he made his way out. Once they were gone, Lin let out a sigh of relief. He had been terrified that Chao Yixiu would be dissatisfied; he certainly didn’t want to offend him.

With a mix of disappointment and frustration, Lin looked at the still-dazed Xiao Yu. "Starting tonight, you don’t need to come to work. And don’t try to explain yourself. Regardless of whether Zhao Shao was willing or not, what you did was wrong. My advice to you is to stay grounded and stop dreaming about things that don’t concern you. Take care of yourself."

With that, Lin stormed out, his anger palpable. If it weren’t for the profits Xiao Yu had brought to the bar in the past, he wouldn’t have bothered with her at all. After all, she had almost gotten him into trouble just now.

Xiao Yu stood there, feeling as if the ground was slipping away beneath her.

On the other side, after his initial anger subsided, Chao Yixiu couldn’t help but notice something was off with Zhao Min. His face was unusually flushed, making Chao Yixiu want to bite into it like a ripe fruit.

He steadied his mind and gently bumped his forehead against Zhao Min’s to check his temperature. Realizing he wasn’t running a fever added to his growing concern—what if Zhao Min had consumed something harmful?

In a rush, he carried Zhao Min to his parked car, placing him in the passenger seat before quickly buckling his seatbelt. He started the engine and sped towards the nearest hospital.

Once at the hospital, he hurriedly carried Zhao Min inside, seeking out the nearest doctor. After a series of examinations, he anxiously bombarded the attending physician with questions.

"Doctor, is he okay? What’s wrong with him? Why is he like this?"

The barrage of questions left the doctor a bit overwhelmed, but he answered patiently, "He’s physically fine. He just drank some party drinks, and on top of that, he consumed a lot of high-proof alcohol, which caused him to faint. He just needs to wait for his body to metabolize the alcohol."

Sorry, as the author, I'm not quite sure what kind of doctor should be treating him... ( •̥́ ˍ •̀ू ) 

Oh, just to clarify, Chao Yixiu is able to unlock the private room door because Lin has the key.
