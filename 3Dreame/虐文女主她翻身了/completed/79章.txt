He actually couldn't get in.

On the other side, after a cozy moment between Lucian and Clara, they also arrived at the Sky Pavilion for a meal. However, when Lucian presented his regular card, the staff member on duty politely informed him, "I'm sorry, but your card can no longer be used here."

As the staff handed the card back to him, Lucian felt a wave of confusion wash over him. He immediately questioned the staff, "Why can't I use my card here? Isn’t it enough to have a regular card to dine here?"

The staff maintained a professional smile in response to Lucian's inquiry. "I’m sorry, but your card is no longer valid for use here."

Believing there was an issue with his card, Lucian was about to seek clarification from a higher authority when he noticed another diner presenting an identical regular card, only to be allowed in without hesitation.

Instantly, Lucian felt slighted, thinking the staff was looking down on him. Enraged, he pointed at the staff and shouted, "What do you think you are? Why can that person go in while I can’t? I demand to speak with your manager and file a complaint against you!"

The staff, clearly new and overwhelmed by the confrontation, felt awkward but maintained a high level of professionalism despite the uncomfortable situation. The commotion soon attracted the attention of the manager.

A kind-looking middle-aged man approached, his demeanor warm and inviting. He gently asked the staff what had transpired. The staff recounted the incident in detail.

Upon hearing the situation, the manager quickly understood what was happening and waved the staff off. Turning to Lucian, he smiled gently, "Sir, may I please see your card?"

Feeling that this man had the authority to resolve the issue, Lucian seized the opportunity to elaborate on the situation, adding embellishments to his story. The manager listened carefully, but he noticed the exaggeration in Lucian’s account and felt a flicker of annoyance, though he kept his expression neutral.

When the manager glanced at the name on the card, realization dawned on him, and he returned it to Lucian. "I apologize, sir, but my young master has stipulated that you are not allowed to dine here."

"My young master? Who is that? How can this be?" Lucian was incredulous. When had he offended anyone associated with the Sky Pavilion? After all, everyone knew that if you were barred from dining here, no matter how much money or status you had, you'd be looked down upon in this circle.

Trying to suppress his rising panic, he pressed the manager, "Can you tell me the surname of your young master?"

Though he was disgusted by his own impolite behavior, Lucian realized that if he didn’t pry the information out of the manager, he would be stuck in this predicament. The manager’s smile faded, and he coldly replied, "My young master’s surname is Yu."

With that, the manager turned and walked away, leaving Lucian in stunned silence. Now, the manager understood why the young master had issued such a decree against Lucian—it was clear that even he wouldn’t allow someone like Lucian into his establishment.

Initially, Lucian found it hard to believe that someone with that surname could have any impact on him since he didn't know anyone by that name. Beside him, Clara, with a pale face, softly tried to console him. Finally, she hesitated before saying, "The man next to Yan Xinfei seems to have the surname Yu. Could it be...?"

Hearing this, Lucian felt a spark of recognition. It’s her again, that Yan Xinfei! I will not let her off the hook this time. He could almost feel the judgmental stares of those around him, looking at his embarrassment. Lowering his head, a shadow crossed his eyes, vowing that one day he would make her pay...

Clara, noticing his distress, couldn't help but secretly smile. Lucian felt the weight of the humiliation wash over him, his face burning red. Yet, when he realized that Clara bore him no disdain, he quickly took her hand and led her to the nearest restaurant.

In the living room, people were gradually taking their seats. The table was laden with a variety of exquisite dishes. Here, they adhered to the custom of "no talking while eating," and the atmosphere was silent, filled only with the sound of cutlery clinking against plates.

Among the spread, there was a dish that particularly delighted one guest—a delightful serving of crayfish. Yu Zhu Yi adored crayfish but was put off by the thought of peeling them. He found it messy and troublesome, even with gloves. After a moment of contemplation, he decided against having any.

Despite his decision, his eyes remained glued to the crayfish, clearly betraying his affection for them. He stared longingly at the dish while absentmindedly picking at other food on the table.
