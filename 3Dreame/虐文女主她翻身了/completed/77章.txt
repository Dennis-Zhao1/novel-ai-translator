**Chapter 77: She Looks Familiar**

This time, the one driving was Yu Zhuyi, as Yan Xinfeng didn’t know the way.

Throughout the journey, Yan Xinfeng kept his burning gaze fixed on Yu Zhuyi, like a hungry wolf eyeing its prey. The intensity of his stare put Yu Zhuyi under immense pressure; he instinctively straightened his back, his palms gripping the steering wheel so tightly they began to sweat, his ears flushed red.

Of course, Yan Xinfeng noticed the little cutie's nervousness, but she found it amusing. So, she simply turned her head and stared directly at him. Her gaze felt almost tangible, hot enough to make him feel flushed, sending a shiver down his spine.

As they neared his grandfather's house, Yan Xinfeng finally shifted her gaze away. Yu Zhuyi felt the heat lift from him and let out a subconscious sigh of relief. It was genuinely overwhelming; he felt utterly defenseless under his sister’s intense gaze. It was as if he were standing before her bare, eliciting an inexplicable sense of shame.

Soon, they arrived at the old residence. After getting out of the car, a middle-aged man in his forties approached them with a warm smile and said to Yu Zhuyi, “Young Master, you’re finally back! The old master has been waiting for you for quite some time. You have no idea how much he’s missed you while you were away. He talks about you every day, you know? Oh, Young Master, you really should come back more often to keep him company. It would certainly make him less bored.”

Hearing this, Yu Zhuyi felt a pang of guilt. “I understand, Uncle Zhang. I promise to visit Grandpa more often. And of course, I’ll make time to chat with you too! By the way, Uncle Zhang, after all these years, why haven’t you found a suitable partner yet?”

Uncle Zhang chuckled, “You little rascal, how dare you tease me? I thought you’d changed, but you’re still the same little brat.” He paused, then noticing Yan Xinfeng standing beside him, he asked earnestly, “Young Master, who is this?”

“Ah, I was just waiting for you to ask that! This is, of course, my girlfriend! Look, I’ve brought my girlfriend to meet the family. Uncle Zhang, why are you still single?” Yu Zhuyi beamed with pride. Although he was boasting about having a girlfriend, he genuinely cared for Uncle Zhang, who had watched him grow up.

Yu Zhuyi treated Uncle Zhang like a family elder, and hearing his words made Uncle Zhang beam with delight, forgetting the earlier teasing.

“Great! You finally brought a girlfriend home! Your grandfather will surely be happy. As for your father… well, never mind that. Let’s go inside; the old master has been waiting for you.”

Yan Xinfeng smiled gently, presenting herself gracefully as she greeted Uncle Zhang, “Hello, Uncle Zhang!”

Uncle Zhang studied Yan Xinfeng for a moment, unable to shake the feeling that her face seemed somewhat familiar. He didn’t delve deeper, reasoning that they might have crossed paths in their circles, and it wasn’t surprising not to know everyone.

Yu Zhuyi held Yan Xinfeng’s hand as they walked ahead, with Uncle Zhang following behind. Watching the young couple display their affection, Uncle Zhang felt a sense of satisfaction, finally seeing Yu Zhuyi ready to settle down.

As a senior, he had witnessed Yu Zhuyi’s hard work and intelligence propel him to his current status at such a young age. Now, he was on the verge of starting his own family.

Soon, they reached the main hall, where an elderly man sat by the door. He had a straight posture, white hair and beard, his face lined with age but his eyes sharp and spirited. He exuded an air of authority, hinting at a past where he once commanded respect in the business world.

The old man smiled at Yu Zhuyi before assessing Yan Xinfeng standing beside him. He feigned a pout, his tone slightly playful, “Well, well, if I hadn’t called you, would you have forgotten to come back and see me? Poor me, at my age, no one comes to keep me company…”

“Grandpa, how could that be? How could anyone not want to keep you company? After all, there’s Uncle Zhang here, and even the servants! There’s no way you’d be lonely! Besides, I’m here trying to find a daughter-in-law for you,” Yu Zhuyi replied in a familiar tone, clearly not trying to appease the elder.

At the end of his speech, he introduced Yan Xinfeng to his grandfather.

The old man snorted, visibly displeased. His grandson returned, and already he was…

Yan Xinfeng gracefully curtsied, “Grandpa, this is a gift I prepared for you. I hope you like it.” She handed over her carefully chosen present.

Seeing her polite demeanor made the old man’s irritation lessen slightly. He accepted the gift from her hands and, upon inspecting it closely, discovered it was a simple yet precious-looking zitan wood box. 

Opening the box, he found an ancient-looking Duan inkstone inside. His hands trembled with excitement as he carefully examined it. After a few moments, he confirmed that this was indeed the inkstone he had long sought—a priceless treasure!

Not only was it one of a kind, but his fondness for it made it worth more than any price. He looked at Yan Xinfeng with bright eyes, “Are you truly giving this to me?” His tone was filled with disbelief.

Yan Xinfeng found the question odd; after all, she thought gifts were meant to be given sincerely. Why would he ask such a thing? However, remembering his status as Yu Zhuyi's grandfather, she patiently responded, “Yes, I know you’d like it; I chose it especially for you.”

Yu Zhuyi watched as his grandfather’s mood visibly brightened, a beaming smile spreading across his face. He even sensed a hint of flattery creeping into the old man’s expression. Confused, he wondered if he was imagining things.

The old man gazed at Yan Xinfeng with eagerness, making it seem as if she were his granddaughter instead. Yu Zhuyi felt relieved that his grandfather took a liking to her; it meant he wouldn’t have to worry about their interactions.

While they enjoyed their lively conversation, Uncle Zhang finally recalled why Yan Xinfeng looked familiar; she was the one who had saved the old man on the plane a few days ago. Excitedly, he whispered a few words to the old man.

Upon realizing this, the old man’s gaze toward Yan Xinfeng became even warmer, as if she were a life-saving benefactor.
