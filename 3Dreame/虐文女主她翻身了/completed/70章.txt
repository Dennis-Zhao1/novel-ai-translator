**Chapter 70: Roller Coaster Ride**

Well, well, since the little cutie is happy, it’s not too much to indulge her a bit.

Yan Xinfey thought to herself silently.

"Let’s head over now," Yan Xinfey said, taking the little cutie's hand.

"Okay, sure thing, sister!" Yu Zhu Yi replied cheerfully.

As they entered the amusement park, they noticed quite a few people around—mostly kids, but there were also some couples who looked like they were enjoying a date.

The duo of Yan Xinfey and Yu Zhu Yi was a head-turner, attracting the attention of many nearby. Although Yan Xinfey noticed the stares, she glanced at the beaming little cutie beside her and decided to ignore the gazes. After all, if she acted as if she didn’t see them, then it was like they didn’t exist.

"Sister, let’s go ride the roller coaster first!" Yu Zhu Yi exclaimed, her eyes sparkling as she pointed toward the nearby ride.

"Sure, I’m good with that. You wait here for me, I’ll go buy the tickets," Yan Xinfey replied.

After saying that, she joined the line to get tickets. At that moment, the crowd for the roller coaster wasn't too heavy, so she only had to wait about ten minutes before she got her tickets.

Nearby, a group of high school girls were watching Yan Xinfey with wide eyes. One of them leaned over to her friend and whispered, "Oh my gosh, she looks so cool!"

The girl next to her nodded vigorously, adding, "Right? She's got such powerful girlfriend vibes!"

"Look at the way she looks at her boyfriend with those adoring eyes," another girl chimed in.

"I’m so jealous of her boyfriend!" someone else said.

"Her boyfriend looks like such a cute puppy!" another girl retorted.

"Not just looks like one; he is a cute puppy!" another girl corrected her.

"Hey, don’t you think her boyfriend is probably waiting at the bottom while she’s up here?" one girl suggested, and her friend nodded enthusiastically in agreement.

Yan Xinfey had excellent hearing and caught every word they said. At first, she thought it was normal, but then it started to feel a bit skewed. She couldn’t help but think about how the younger girls had such... well, unique perspectives.

However, the two girls seemed oblivious to the fact that the subjects of their discussion could hear them. They continued their excited chatter, and Yan Xinfey, unable to bear it any longer, quickly stepped away to find some peace.

Although she could have confronted them about their comments, they weren’t being malicious; they were just expressing admiration. If she interrupted them, it would make her seem petty, and she didn’t have the heart to stop their innocent chatter.

If anyone who knew Yan Xinfey were nearby, they would have widened their eyes in disbelief, saying something like, "What do you mean you can’t bear to interrupt? You just want to hear compliments about yourself and the little cutie!"

Returning to her little cutie, Yan Xinfey found her sweetly waiting for her to come back.

For a brief moment, she felt grateful to have someone who cared for her, someone who loved her.

"Sister, thank you for your hard work," Yu Zhu Yi said.

"It’s nothing. Now let’s go line up for the roller coaster," Yan Xinfey replied.

They approached the ticket checkpoint, finding themselves behind a couple and in front of a mother with her child.

They overheard the little boy behind them ask his mother in a voice full of childish wonder, "Mommy, why are the sister and brother in front going on the roller coaster too?"

The mother felt a bit embarrassed by her child's question and cautiously glanced at Yan Xinfey and Yu Zhu Yi. Seeing that they didn’t react, she quietly reassured her child, "Well, don’t you love coming to the amusement park? Do you like riding roller coasters, too?"

The boy nodded eagerly and then declared with a lightbulb moment, "Mommy, Mommy, does that mean the brother and sister also love playing here and riding roller coasters?"

His mother gently affirmed, "Yes, that’s right! You’re so smart!"

She assumed that Yan Xinfey and Yu Zhu Yi hadn’t heard their conversation since they remained unresponsive.

Unbeknownst to her, both Yan Xinfey and Yu Zhu Yi had heard everything. They just felt there was no need to explain their presence at the amusement park to a child, and Yu Zhu Yi was a bit shy about explaining that it was because he thought couples should visit amusement parks together.

Fortunately, it was soon their turn to check tickets. Once inside, they took their seats on the roller coaster.

The staff instructed them to fasten their safety belts, and only after passing the safety checks were they ready to start the ride.

Yan Xinfey and Yu Zhu Yi sat in the third row, relatively close to the front. In front of them was the couple they had seen earlier, and behind them were the mother and child.

Yu Zhu Yi gripped her sister’s hand with excitement, while Yan Xinfey appeared calm and composed.

As the roller coaster began to move, it started slowly, and Yu Zhu Yi didn’t feel much at first. But once the ride suddenly sped up, shooting upward, and then flipped through five consecutive 360-degree loops, she was terrified and squeezed her eyes shut, her face turning pale and her lips white.

Yan Xinfey thought to herself, Is that it? This isn’t even that scary.

Listening to the screams around her, she felt a bit irritated. Why are they so easily frightened? Even the little cutie beside her wasn’t screaming!

But the next moment, when she turned to check on her little cutie, she found his face as pale as a sheet of paper.

Instantly, her irritation transformed into concern. She instinctively held Yu Zhu Yi’s hand, trying to transfer her warmth to him, silently soothing him.

Finally, the ride came to an end. Once the roller coaster halted, Yu Zhu Yi unbuckled her safety belt and dashed to the railing, doubling over to vomit.

Yan Xinfey quickly rushed to buy a bottle of water, returning to Yu Zhu Yi’s side to pat her back while opening the water bottle and offering it to her.

Yu Zhu Yi took the water and used it to rinse her mouth.

From her pocket, Yan Xinfey pulled out some tissues to help wipe the sweat off her forehead.

With a hint of concern, she said, "You can’t handle roller coasters, let’s skip them next time. Should we head back now?"

Upon hearing her sister's suggestion, Yu Zhu Yi immediately objected.

"No way! I still want to play!"

How could they come to the amusement park for the first time and only ride the roller coaster?

Seeing Yu Zhu Yi’s determined expression, Yan Xinfey could only relent.
