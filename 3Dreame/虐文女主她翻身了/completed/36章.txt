### Chapter 36: She Wants to Cook

Yu Zhuo Yi clicked into the live stream where Yan Xin Fei was hosting, and soon realized she was auditioning for a variety show. He watched her intently, feeling a twinge of jealousy—she hadn’t even told him about this! Browsing through the comments online, he noticed many fans calling her “my wife.” 

He thought to himself, “I haven’t even had a chance to say that yet.”

Lin Yun Yan cast a shy glance at Yu Zhuo Yi, inching closer to him to see what he was watching. She caught sight of Yan Xin Fei and felt a pang of jealousy. It was clear that Yu Zhuo Yi had genuinely developed feelings for Yan Xin Fei. The look on his face mirrored her own when she was with him—a joyful, almost euphoric expression. The realization made her heart ache, feeling a bitter sting of discomfort.

Quietly, she slipped away.

Yu Zhuo Yi, oblivious to her departure, was completely focused on his sister, leaving no room for distractions.

Then, Grandma turned and walked over to a locked cabinet. She opened it and pulled out a string of red prayer beads and a string of blue ones. 

As she approached, she handed the red beads to Yan Xin Fei and the blue ones to Xu Xiao Xiao, a smile playing at the corners of her lips. “Girls, I don’t have many gifts to offer, but these are my treasured prayer beads. I hope you like them as a token of our meeting.”

Xu Xiao Xiao looked at Yan Xin Fei, unsure if she should accept the gift or refuse it. 

Yan Xin Fei nodded at Xu Xiao Xiao, recognizing that it was Grandma's heartfelt gesture. Refusing would only hurt her feelings. 

With a warm smile, Yan Xin Fei said, “Thank you! I really like them.” 

Xu Xiao Xiao smiled shyly, “Thank you, Grandma! I like them too.” 

“Good, good! As long as you like them,” Grandma beamed and then headed into the kitchen. 

Noticing this, Yan Xin Fei took the initiative to help. “Grandma, let me cook. You should relax outside for a bit.” 

“I can handle it,” Grandma insisted gently. 

“Please, just let me do it. I want you all to taste my cooking,” Yan Xin Fei said, ushering Grandma out of the kitchen as she spoke. 

“Alright, alright,” Grandma chuckled in agreement. 

Xu Xiao Xiao stepped forward to help as well, though she wasn’t very skilled in the kitchen. 

Compared to Yan Xin Fei’s confident movements, Xu Xiao Xiao’s actions appeared clumsy and unsure. 

Yan Xin Fei skillfully sliced potatoes into thin strips, instructing Xu Xiao Xiao, “You wash those vegetables. I’ll take care of the rest.” 

[Did Sister Yan really know how to cook? She seems so experienced!] 

[That knife skill shows she’s been cooking for years.] 

[I agree, my mom has been cutting vegetables for so long and still can’t match her skill!] 

[Who would’ve thought rich people could cook for themselves?] 

[Am I the only one who saw Yan Xin Fei giving Xu Xiao Xiao a look of disdain while directing her to wash the vegetables?] 

[Nope, I saw it too!] 

[Sister Yan can manage both the social scene and the kitchen—she’s a real catch!] 

[Hey, that’s my wife you’re talking about!] 

[Shut up, she’s clearly mine!] 

[You’re all delusional. I have a marriage certificate with her; she’s my wife.] 

[I’m Yan Xin Fei’s boyfriend, so everyone else should stop claiming her.] 

[Laughing so hard, there’s no way! I could claim I’m the son of a billionaire too.] 

[If you’re her boyfriend, does that mean I’m the billionaire’s wife?] 

Yu Zhuo Yi felt his anger boiling. How could these people not believe he was Yan Xin Fei’s boyfriend and even mock him? The more he thought about it, the angrier he got.

Yan Xin Fei prepared several dishes: spicy and sour shredded potatoes, braised spare ribs with preserved vegetables, garlic chicken wings, sweet and sour spare ribs, stir-fried mushrooms with bok choy, scrambled eggs with tomatoes, stir-fried meat with mushrooms, and hand-torn cabbage. 

She also decided to make a comforting fish head tofu soup for Grandma to enjoy after the meal.

An hour later, Yan Xin Fei and Xu Xiao Xiao proudly presented a colorful array of dishes. 

Grandma praised, “You girls did an amazing job!” 

“Oh no, Grandma, it was all Xin Fei. I just helped a bit,” Xu Xiao Xiao said bashfully. 

“Grandma, would you like to try?” Yan Xin Fei suggested, gesturing for the staff to join them at the table. 

The staff felt a bit overwhelmed by the attention. 

They took a bite of the dishes and were pleasantly surprised by how delicious everything was. 

The table fell into a comfortable silence, with everyone absorbed in their meal, except for Yan Xin Fei who continued to engage with them. 

Half an hour later, the food Yan Xin Fei had prepared was all but gone. 

Seeing her dishes enjoyed so thoroughly brought a smile to Yan Xin Fei’s face. After all, who wouldn’t feel happy when their cooking was savored by others?
