**Chapter Fifteen: Encountering the Dog Man After Dinner**

Yuan Xinfei and Yu Zhuyi walked side by side, leaving the private room. Just as they stepped out the door, Lu Xiuming arrived not far from where Yuan Xinfei had just been.

He had indeed not been mistaken; the figure he had seen earlier was unmistakably Yuan Xinfei. Initially, he had intended to pretend not to recognize her, especially since he felt a growing annoyance at her persistent entanglement in his life. However, when he tried to look away, he caught sight of the man beside her, and a wave of anger surged within him. He forced himself to suppress his rage and bid farewell to his business partners before storming toward Yuan Xinfei.

"Yuan Xinfei, how could you let yourself go like this? Are you really here on a date with him? Are you still mad at me? Come on, I know you still like me," he exclaimed, his voice filled with accusation. The way he confronted Yuan Xinfei was akin to someone whose partner had cheated on them, leaving him wearing a proverbial green hat.

Little did he know, he was the one engaging in such disloyalty, harboring love for another while stringing along the original owner of his affections. He was nothing but a scoundrel.

Yu Zhuyi stepped forward, positioning himself protectively in front of Yuan Xinfei. In stark contrast to Lu Xiuming's aggressive demeanor, Yuan Xinfei remained remarkably calm and unbothered.

Seeing this, Lu Xiuming's anger boiled over, and he pointed a finger at Yu Zhuyi. "You can't seriously have feelings for this gigolo, can you? What happened to you? You've changed so much!"

Yuan Xinfei stepped forward, brushing his hand aside and meeting his glare with steely composure. "A gentleman uses words, not violence. Your behavior is more akin to that of a petty person. Moreover, I already told you at the company that we have no relationship anymore. Was my message unclear? Or has your brain become so muddled that you can't even understand plain speech?"

Lu Xiuming’s face darkened in frustration. He wanted to retort but found himself cowed under her pressure, taking a few steps back instead. At this, Yu Zhuyi couldn’t help but chuckle softly.

Lu Xiuming, realizing how he must have appeared, straightened his back and took a step forward, attempting to regain his lost momentum. But to the onlookers, he resembled nothing more than a clown putting on a show.

Seeing Lu Xiuming’s ridiculous display, Yu Zhuyi felt a surge of relief. Through his interactions with his sister, he had grown confident that she wouldn’t fall for a spineless man like him.

"Since you can't seem to understand, let me make it crystal clear one last time: I have never liked you. You were merely a distraction during my moments of boredom. Don’t take yourself too seriously. If you dare to bother me again, the consequences won’t be to your liking," she declared, not waiting for Lu Xiuming’s reaction as she took Yu Zhuyi's hand and walked away.

"Does that mean you really don’t like Lu Xiuming, sis?" Yu Zhuyi asked, glancing up at her.

"Never liked him," Yuan Xinfei replied firmly.

"Got it, I believe you," he said, lowering his head in thought. He resolved to use a bit of his authority to ensure Lu Xiuming would be banned from entering the Shangyun Loft in the future. As the heir of the Yu family, he had that much power.

Of course, Lu Xiuming was completely unaware of this. If he had known that his meddling would lead to his permanent exclusion from the Shangyun Loft, he would undoubtedly regret his actions.

After dropping Yu Zhuyi off at school, Yuan Xinfei drove away, leaving him to watch her car fade into the distance. It was a sight that made him feel as though he were a lovesick stone, yearning for his beloved.

Yu Zhuyi thought to himself that today had been a fruitful day. His relationship with his sister had progressed further; they were now friends. If he kept at it, he felt certain that one day he would become her boyfriend. As he pondered this, a wave of determination surged through him, filling him with energy.
