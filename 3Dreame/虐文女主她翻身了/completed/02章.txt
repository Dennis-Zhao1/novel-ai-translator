**Chapter 2: A Charming Encounter**

Bai Xiaoyou was a 22-year-old girl living in a small town. This year, she had just graduated from college and hadn’t yet found a job, so she spent her days cooped up at home, sending out countless resumes in search of employment.

Today, she was heading to a relative's house to attend a banquet. It was her distant cousin’s wedding, and she’d heard that he was tying the knot today.

Since her parents were working far away and couldn’t make it back home, they called Bai Xiaoyou to ask her to attend the wedding on their behalf. 

Early in the morning, Bai Xiaoyou rose with excitement. After brushing her teeth and washing her face, she savored her breakfast before diving into her makeup routine. Finally, she slipped into a beautiful strapless princess dress that accentuated her figure.

Bai Xiaoyou was naturally beautiful, even without makeup, but she often looked younger than her actual age, making it hard for others to believe she had just graduated from college.

Two hours later, as she admired her bright eyes and radiant smile in the mirror, she couldn’t help but exclaim, “Gorgeous! I’m definitely going to be the most dazzling person here today.”

With a determined smile, she drove to the venue.

Thirty minutes later, she arrived at the banquet hall. After handing her car keys to the valet, she gracefully walked inside, invitation in hand. 

Her efforts in getting ready paid off; once inside the hotel, Bai Xiaoyou caught the attention of many guests. She reveled in the admiration, embracing the moment wholeheartedly.

The wedding was indeed a beautiful affair. A casual glance at the bride and groom confirmed their compatibility. The bride was enchanting, embodying a blend of traditional grace and modern intelligence, while the groom was handsome, young, and promising—a true catch in every sense.

Listening to the whispers that praised the couple, Bai Xiaoyou couldn’t help but feel a tinge of envy. Would she also transform into such a remarkable person by the time her own wedding day came around?

A sense of dullness suddenly washed over her. After nibbling on a few dishes at the banquet, she smiled politely at the elders and decided to step away from the festivities. Instead of heading home, she wandered slowly around the venue.

Out of nowhere, she bumped into an old high school friend, Xuan Liu. It was unexpected; after graduating, Bai Xiaoyou had changed her phone number and lost touch with everyone from that time.

What a coincidence to meet someone she once knew here!

Xuan Liu greeted Bai Xiaoyou with warm enthusiasm, as if no years had passed between them. Bai Xiaoyou managed a smile, feeling slightly uneasy about the unexpected reunion.

“I’m here with some friends,” Xuan Liu explained. “What about you, Xiaoyou?”

“I came to attend a wedding from my relatives,” Bai Xiaoyou replied.

“By the way, how have you been these past few years? You really should have told me when you changed your number! I couldn’t find you at all!” Xuan Liu playfully chided.

Bai Xiaoyou felt a wave of discomfort; she had grown unused to people asking about her life, even if it was an old friend. But she forced herself to respond, “Sorry, it was a complicated time back then.”

Xuan Liu didn’t press further, though she looked a bit puzzled. Instead, she linked her arm with Bai Xiaoyou’s and led her into the gathering.

As they entered, laughter erupted from the group.

“Xuan Liu, how could you not tell us about such a gorgeous friend!” one of the guys exclaimed.

“Seriously! You’ve known me for years, and I’m still single! Why haven’t you introduced me?” another chimed in.

Xuan Liu playfully reprimanded them, then turned to comfort Bai Xiaoyou, encouraging her to feel at home.

“Okay,” Bai Xiaoyou replied, her heart racing a little.

She glanced around the room, taking in the familiar and unfamiliar faces, but just as she was about to look away, her gaze fell upon a quiet young man in the corner.

He looked about eighteen, with short hair and a white shirt that was slightly unbuttoned at the collar. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, revealing healthy, tanned skin. His high nose and thin lips gave him an air of quiet confidence.

Bai Xiaoyou recalled hearing that people with thin lips could be quite aloof. She wondered if he was the same.

Xuan Liu began introducing her to the people around, but Bai Xiaoyou was only half-listening. When they reached the young man, she perked up attentively.

His name was Xuan Zhexi, Xuan Liu's distant cousin, a second-year college student. 

Bai Xiaoyou couldn’t help but ask, “Isn’t he a bit young?”

Xuan Liu looked surprised. “Young? He may look it, but he’s actually twenty. My cousin can be a bit hard to deal with; it’s best if you keep your distance.”

When Bai Xiaoyou heard that he was twenty, she felt relieved. That didn’t make her a cradle snatcher, after all.

Indeed, she felt a spark of attraction the moment she laid eyes on him—could it be love at first sight? She thought about pursuing him.

Before long, the gathering came to an end, and Bai Xiaoyou successfully obtained Xuan Zhexi’s contact information.

[What happens next? What adventures await them? That’s for you to imagine! Let your creativity run wild!]
