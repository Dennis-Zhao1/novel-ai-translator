**Chapter 50: Reaching a Cooperation**

Soon, a man named Heizi stopped outside a door and knocked, calling out, “Bro Hui, someone’s here to see you.”

From inside, a slightly raspy and uncomfortable voice replied, “Let him come in.”

With that, Heizi turned and walked away, leaving Lu Xiuming standing there alone. Taking a deep breath, he pushed the door open. Inside, he found a middle-aged man, around thirty, lounging in the center of a plush sofa facing the entrance. Flanking him were two alluring women—one half-sitting and half-embracing him, while the other leaned softly against his chest.

The man used his left hand to caress the waist of the woman leaning against him, while simultaneously kissing the other one.

Zhao Hui, the man on the couch, glanced at Lu Xiuming as he entered and signaled for the woman who was half-sitting with him to attend to Lu Xiuming.

The woman’s eyes sparkled with a hint of excitement as she caught sight of Lu Xiuming’s handsome features. After all, he wasn’t hard on the eyes, and serving him was a perk.

She swayed her curvy hips and made her way toward Lu Xiuming. However, before she could reach him, he took a few steps back, a frown creasing his brow as he prepared to decline.

Zhao Hui, noticing his reaction, frowned slightly and said, “What’s wrong? Don’t you like the woman I offered you?”

It was as if Lu Xiuming’s refusal was an affront to Zhao Hui. Reluctantly, Lu Xiuming swallowed his pride and stepped forward to embrace the woman.

Seeing Lu Xiuming finally take a seat with the woman, Zhao Hui chuckled, “That’s more like it! When we talk business, beauty and good wine are a must, right?”

“When do we start discussing…” Lu Xiuming asked, a hint of urgency in his voice.

“No rush. Let’s drink first,” Zhao Hui replied, gesturing for the woman beside Lu Xiuming to pour him a drink.

With a sigh, Lu Xiuming reluctantly swallowed the drink poured into his glass, hoping that after this, Zhao Hui would finally get down to business. 

But he was too naive. After finishing one glass, Zhao Hui had someone refill it again. Lu Xiuming could only down shot after shot.

Zhao Hui watched him with delight. Had it been anyone else, he would have started discussing the cooperation as soon as they stepped in. But Lu Xiuming, who often looked down on him, was different. Zhao Hui knew that if it weren’t for his current needs, Lu Xiuming wouldn’t be groveling for cooperation now.

Finally, after Lu Xiuming had nearly polished off two bottles of alcohol, Zhao Hui signaled for the two women to leave. Though Zhao Hui harbored intentions of revenge against Lu Xiuming, he also knew they were meeting for business. He didn’t want their cooperation to collapse before it even began because Lu Xiuming was too drunk.

The two women, though disappointed, had no choice but to comply. In this line of work, no one wanted to cross someone with a bit of influence, especially not someone like Zhao Hui.

Once the door closed behind them, Zhao Hui spoke up, deliberately emphasizing the word "cooperation." “Let’s talk about your proposal.”

“I want you to help me imprison Yan Xinfeng, and in return, I’ll give you two percent of Lu’s shares,” Lu Xiuming proposed.

Zhao Hui chuckled at this. “Two percent? That’s way too little. You think I’d risk so much to hold the Yan family head? Are you crazy or am I?”

Hearing Zhao Hui’s rejection, Lu Xiuming felt a surge of anger and considered storming out. But he could only restrain himself and take a deep breath. “How about three percent? Don’t push your luck.”

Zhao Hui showed no fear. “Not enough. At least this amount.” He held up five fingers. “You can refuse, but once you walk out that door, who knows what people will make of your little proposal?”

Fuming, Lu Xiuming held back his frustration. “Fine, but you better handle your end of the deal. I’ll provide the time and place for her appearance, and the rest is up to you.”

Zhao Hui smiled. “Of course, now that I’ve accepted your offer, I’ll definitely take care of it.”

With Zhao Hui’s agreement, Lu Xiuming had no reason to linger. He turned and left, though the resentment bubbled inside him, growing with each step. 

He couldn’t help but think: this was all Yan Xinfeng’s fault. If she hadn’t treated him this way, he wouldn’t have to beg others for help. And Zhao Hui, taking five percent of Lu’s shares from him—he’d better pray that it didn’t end up in Lu Xiuming’s hands, or else…

If Yan Xinfeng knew what was happening now, she’d definitely give him a piece of her mind, slapping him back to reality and telling him to stop dreaming.

Yet here he was, trying to use Yan’s stock for his own benefit, all the while pretending to be so noble. How ridiculous!
