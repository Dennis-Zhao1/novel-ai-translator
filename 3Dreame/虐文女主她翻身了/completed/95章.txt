**Chapter 95: She Still Has the Same Mind as Before**

Wen Qingzhi felt a pang of resentment in her heart as she noticed that Lu Qiuming seemed oblivious to her words. Instead, he was fixated on Yan Xinfai, and with each passing moment, her anger simmered hotter.

*“Come on, can’t you see? He’s not looking at her with admiration; it’s pure hatred!”* she thought, frustration bubbling within her. 

An idea suddenly struck her—she could use her recently regained magical abilities to…

She was certain that if she wielded her powers, no one would…

As she glanced at the radiant Yan Xinfai, who was smiling brightly in the distance, and then back at Lu Qiuming, whose gaze remained locked on Yan, the darkness within her began to surface. She could hardly contain the urge to humiliate Yan Xinfai right then and there.

Seeing Yan Xinfai brought back memories of the so-called "true disciples" she had encountered in the sect before her rebirth. Those individuals always wore expressions of aloofness, as though they were graced with a profound compassion that made them kind to everyone—a quality that felt utterly hypocritical to her.

At the same time, it invoked a deep sense of inferiority within her. Why was it that all of them could bask in the glory of being inner disciples while she, just because she was an outer disciple, was looked down upon?

After all the effort she had put into entering the sect, she found herself unable to become an inner disciple due to her mediocre talents, leading her to settle for life as an outer disciple. Each time she saw those inner disciples, her heart burned with resentment.

Deep down, she believed their achievements were merely a product of their favorable circumstances. If she had been able to cultivate from a young age, she was sure she could have become one of them, perhaps even surpass them…

This very mindset had led her to neglect her training when she first became an outer disciple. Instead of dedicating herself to her studies, she spent her days consumed by trivial thoughts.

In comparison to her fellow outer disciples, her magical skills lagged significantly behind. While they tirelessly practiced their spells day in and day out, she barely managed to grasp the basics even after countless hours of study. In moments of frustration, she even found herself resenting the outer sect elders who were supposed to teach them.

This negligence had dire consequences; when faced with danger, she found herself ill-prepared to escape.

The humiliation she faced as an outer disciple was a memory she could never forget. However, in truth, that humiliation was largely self-imposed—her entry into the outer sect was, in itself, a blessing. She had managed to join the ranks of the outer disciples thanks to the compassion of an elder who, upon seeing her distressed expression, had relented and accepted her.

Who would have thought that instead of gratitude, she would harbor resentment towards that elder? In her heart, she believed that if it weren’t for that elder’s choice, she would have surely been an inner disciple—how could she not blame him?

She had never taken the time to reflect on her own shortcomings.

Now, witnessing the dazzling Yan Xinfai, who seemed to radiate light, jealousy surged within her. She despised anyone who surpassed her, especially those who were favored by fate.

It never crossed her mind that the accomplishments of those favored individuals were not easily attained. They worked tirelessly day and night, dedicating themselves to their pursuits, while she wasted her time wallowing in envy instead of focusing on her own growth. The hardships they endured were beyond her imagination.

*“People only feel envy when they harbor insecurities. A truly exceptional person wouldn’t waste energy on trivial matters; they appreciate others and recognize their strengths rather than fixating on their flaws,”* she mused.

Though Wen Qingzhi had been reborn and possessed a new body, her soul remained the same, and her mindset had not changed. She was trapped in a vicious cycle.

Now, her thoughts were consumed with plotting how to embarrass others, how to scheme against them, and how to seize their possessions, never considering the possibility of improving her own abilities.

The dark thoughts and choices she made now would inevitably lead to her tragic future. If only she knew what awaited her, she surely wouldn’t have acted so recklessly…

But sadly, no one possesses the ability to foresee the future.

In that moment, her focus was solely on how to bring Yan Xinfai down a peg in front of everyone. She was determined to make Yan Xinfai suffer embarrassment before all.
