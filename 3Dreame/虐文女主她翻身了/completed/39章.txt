**Chapter 39: The Netizens Are So Ridiculous**

**[My Assignment Is Well-Taken Care Of]**: What the heck, is that our delicate flower, Wendy? She’s being so rude!

**[My Assignment Did It For Me]**: She actually went and questioned Sister Xinfei in such a nasty tone! Why would Sister Xinfei, who worked hard for her lunch, want to eat with Wendy Qingzhi? ╮(﹀_﹀”)╭

**[Stepping on a Coffin to Watch the Sunset]**: Even if Sister Xinfei invited Wendy to join her, with Wendy’s attitude just now, do you really think she’d go? She’d probably think it was charity or something.

**[Sleeping Back to Childhood]**: There are so many weirdos this year; Wendy Qingzhi is the weirdest of them all! (||๐_๐)

**[Steamed with a Breath]**: I can’t even stand it from behind the screen. Wendy has the guts to ask someone as old as my grandma to cook for her! If I did that, my parents would definitely chase me around the house with a stick.

**[Running Away from Village]**: Wendy really thinks too highly of herself. (*´◐∀◐`*) What a fool!

**[Drunk on Soy Sauce]**: Xu Xiaoxiao is so cute, bouncing around like a little bunny.

**[This Account Has Been Disabled]**: Yan Jie was probably talking about those two dummies, right? Right, right?

**[This Name Really Has Ten Characters]**: Yan Xinfei: Oops, almost let it slip! No panic, as long as I stay calm, no one will notice.

**[Hand-Drawn Pancakes]**: Hahaha. <{=．．．．(Gah~ Gah~ Gah~)

**[Silly and Adorable, I'm a Goofball]**: Wow, I actually saw Zhou Cong and the others breathe a sigh of relief when they found out they could go in and cook lunch.

**[I Want to Go Back to Kindergarten for Further Studies]**: I also saw their expressions of pure relief when they realized it was because they didn't follow us inside and were waiting outside. Excuse me????

**[School is a Breathing Pain]**: Silly, silly, silly!

Inside, Zhou Cong and Gu Zihan politely greeted Grandma and thanked her. 

Only after getting Grandma’s permission did they step into the kitchen to start cooking.

The two big guys looked a bit helpless while trying to cook. 

Yan Xinfei noticed their awkwardness and stepped in to guide them on how to prepare the dishes. 

Under her guidance, they managed to whip up three plates of not-so-great-looking food. 

While it wasn’t anything gourmet, it was still edible. 

No one cared anymore that Wendy and the others had run out without lunch; after all, that was their own doing. 

Oh, if someone asked them about Song Lin, would they care about him? 

They would disdainfully reply that it wasn’t their problem; he chose to run off, didn’t he? He’s a grown man in his twenties, with hands and feet—he won’t starve! 

After Wendy dashed out, she heard Xu Xiaoxiao actually telling Zhou Cong and the others to go in and cook. She was so angry she cried.

Seeing Wendy's innocent tears, Song Lin patiently comforted her.

In Wendy’s mind, the system’s cold, electronic voice kept ringing out, **[Faith Value -1] [Faith Value -3] [Faith Value -5] [Host, warning! Warning! Your faith value is dropping rapidly. Please find a way to earn it back. If you cannot increase your faith value, I will automatically leave.]**

Hearing the system say it would leave made Wendy’s heart race: If the system abandoned her, what would she do? She absolutely could not let that happen.

After comforting Wendy, Song Lin felt a bit foolish. Why did he follow her out here and starve? But looking at her pure expression, he couldn’t help but feel his heart flutter.

In the end, he told Wendy to wait in the shade while he went to find food. Somehow, he managed to get a meal from a family that didn’t seem very well-off. 

Even the bowl was something the staff had to fetch for him. 

It wasn’t that others didn’t want to help him; it was just that his attitude was so terrible, and they all knew what had happened earlier—after all, in such a small town, everyone knows each other.

When Song Lin brought the food back to Wendy, she immediately made a face of disgust. 

She pretended to be cheerful, saying, “Brother Song, you’re amazing! You actually found food! Thank you for your hard work!”

Hearing her praise made Song Lin feel good.

Wendy forced herself to eat a small bite of the food she found distasteful, pretending she was full, and told Brother Song to finish the rest. If he couldn’t, he could let the nearby staff eat it.

There was nothing he could do; the food he had was too much for just the two of them, but since Wendy only took a little, he had to offer it to the staff filming nearby as well.

**[Sexy Pig Trotters]**: Sister Xinfei is really great! They couldn’t cook, and she was right there guiding them.

**[Bear Bear is Spicy No More]**: It looks like just average home-cooked dishes.

**[Red Apricot Out of the Wall]**: Their dishes look decent, way better than what Wendy’s group had.

**[Waiting for Red Apricot Outside the Wall]**: I just came from there; did you know? I saw Wendy resting while Song Lin went off to find food!

**[Eating Chicken with Good Looks]**: Wendy’s actions really leave me dumbfounded, 66666!

**[Good People Live a Life of Flat Chests]**: Isn’t Wendy Qingzhi’s character supposed to be weak and unable to take care of herself?

**[Zombie Ate Jumping Candy]**: In this episode, it seems Wendy’s character has completely flopped.

**[Eyes That Can Kill Elementary Students]**: To the one above, be more confident and just drop the “seems”!

**[Relying on Age to Speak Recklessly]**: Hahaha!
