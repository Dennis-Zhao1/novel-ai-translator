**Chapter 120:**

As she was lost in thought, her assistant, who had just stepped out of the hospital room, returned.

"Hey, Wen, how are you feeling? You need to take better care of yourself. You've been working too hard. Look at you now..." The assistant approached with concern.

"Uh-huh," Wen Qingzhi replied, her tone dismissive. "By the way, did the doctor say what’s wrong?"

"Um... Wen, I was out for a bit, so I didn't catch what the doctor said. Should I go ask now?" 

"Forget it, no need to ask. Where did you go just now?"

"The company called me. It was... about you," the assistant said carefully.

"About me?" Wen Qingzhi asked, her curiosity piqued.

"Well... it’s about the last time you participated in that variety show. The feedback wasn't great, so the company wants you to take some time off to rest until you’re back in shape," the assistant blurted out.

In truth, saying the feedback wasn’t great was a kind way of putting it. To be blunt, she had strayed far from the image she had initially cultivated.

Time off? Getting back in shape? 

Wen Qingzhi let out a cold laugh. By the time she returned to the public eye, everyone would have probably forgotten about her.

"Did something happen recently?" Wen Qingzhi suppressed her growing dissatisfaction.

"I heard… that during the last variety show, you used your connections to take someone else's spot, and when it came time for filming, your character fell apart too severely..." 

The assistant's voice trailed off as she dared not continue, trembling slightly at the terrifying expression on Wen Qingzhi's face, twisted with barely concealed rage.

She felt a rush of fear; she had never seen Wen Qingzhi look so frightening before.

Noticing the assistant's pale complexion, Wen Qingzhi reined in her anger slightly and forced a smile that was sweet yet false. "Did I scare you? I was just in a bad mood earlier, sorry about that."

Hearing her apology and seeing her gentle demeanor, the assistant's fear dissipated. She thought Wen Qingzhi was probably just stressed from work and the illness.

"It’s okay, Wen," she replied, trying to reassure her.

"You can go ahead and handle your tasks. I need to rest a bit," Wen Qingzhi said, feigning exhaustion.

"Alright, Wen. I'll leave you to it. Take care of yourself." 

Once the assistant left, Wen Qingzhi's suppressed rage bubbled to the surface.

The fire in her eyes blazed like a series of small explosions. She felt like she could jump three feet in the air, her face contorted in anger, resembling a thunderstorm about to break. The skin around her eyes pulled tight, as if it might crack, and her round eyes looked ready to burst.

What had once been a delicate face was now twisted with fury, giving her an unnerving appearance, strikingly devoid of beauty.

"It’s all her fault. If she hadn’t been so selfish on the variety show, I wouldn’t be drowning in negative press now. If only she could still follow Qiuming like a devoted fan, I wouldn’t be left alone while I’m sick... Ahhh, it’s all her fault... Yan Xinfey..."

Wen Qingzhi gripped the white bedsheet tightly, as if it were a person she wanted to strangle. 

When she finally released it, the sheet was in tatters, a testament to her inner turmoil.
