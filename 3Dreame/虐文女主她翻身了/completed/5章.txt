**The Abilities Still Exist**

The male lead was fuming, unaware that the incident from today had already spread throughout the industry like wildfire. Even if he did know, it wouldn't bother him. 

Of course, the main reason was that he made too much noise every time he visited the Yan Corporation, flaunting his supposed superiority and belittling their president at every turn. The employees had long since grown tired of Lu Xiuming's antics, toying with their president's emotions while he pranced around like he owned the place. 

To them, their president was a dreamboat—someone worthy of admiration and respect. The audacity of Lu Xiuming to not cherish such an exceptional person was infuriating. But now, things were changing, and their president was finally seeing the light.

Honestly, Lu Xiuming was completely unworthy of their esteemed president. When they first learned that their beloved leader had a crush on that pretty boy Lu Xiuming, it had shattered the hearts of countless young men and women alike. They couldn't help but view Lu Xiuming as nothing more than a gold digger, living off their president's hard work. How shameless!

Thus, news of today's events quickly circulated within their circles. After Lu Xiuming left, Yan Xinfei didn’t take the male lead's words to heart. After all, she wasn’t the naive, love-struck original host; she was merely a soul from a post-apocalyptic world, now navigating a new existence.

Once everything was settled, she promptly banned Lu Xiuming from entering the company. She began to review all collaborations with the Lu Corporation and ordered her staff to halt any ongoing partnerships.

Yan Xinfei adapted to managing the company swiftly, considering she had been a president herself before the apocalypse. 

Standing in her office on the twentieth floor, she gazed down at the throngs of people below—tiny black dots swarming like ants. In the vastness of the universe, humanity truly seemed insignificant. The view from the president's office was stunning, offering a breathtaking panorama of the city. It was no wonder so many people aspired to climb the corporate ladder.

As she sat in her office chair, an intriguing thought struck her: Could her abilities have come along with her into this new narrative? After all, just moments ago, when Lu Xiuming had attempted to push Secretary Yu aside, she had instinctively unleashed her wind-based powers.

She closed her eyes, focusing her energy to sense her abilities. Moments later, she opened them again, realizing that her powers had indeed followed her into this world.

This was wonderful! Here, there was an abundance of food and a stable order—no need to worry about zombie attacks. Even though she had no family in this world, she was okay with that. She had grown accustomed to it, and without the original host's family around, she felt even more at ease. 

Why? Because without them, there was no risk of her true identity being discovered. If she had to live with someone familiar with the original host's family, it would be easy for them to notice the differences in her behavior. After all, they were two distinct individuals, and their habits would inevitably differ. It was better this way—no family meant no risk of exposure.

She quickly tackled the backlog of work that the original host had left behind in her pursuit of the male lead. Despite her speed, it still took her nearly three hours to sort through a mountain of documents.

Rubbing her throbbing temples, she realized it was almost one in the morning. With a wry smile, she grabbed her coat and headed out.

The original host had a small apartment near the company, just a ten-minute drive away. As she entered the underground parking garage and slipped into her sleek black Maserati, she began to contemplate what to eat for dinner.

The apartment’s fridge was regularly stocked and cleaned by a housekeeper, ensuring there were always fresh ingredients. After some deliberation, she decided to whip up a bowl of noodles. After all, today had been exhausting.
