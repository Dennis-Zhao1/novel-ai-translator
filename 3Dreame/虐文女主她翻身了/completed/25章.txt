**Chapter 25: Movie Night**

Half an hour later, Yanshin Fei had finished her meal and was now watching the little cutie eat with keen interest.

After a while, the little cutie looked up with a pitiful expression and whined, "Sister, sister, I'm full, but I can't finish all this."

Yanshin Fei glanced at the half-eaten plate in front of him, her gaze piercing yet playful. With a soft smile, she replied, "If you can't eat anymore, it's okay. I can help you, but you need to..."

Hearing this, the little cutie felt a wave of panic wash over him, as if he were being stalked by a wolf. Oh yes, Yanshin Fei was indeed that wolf, and Yu Zhu Yi was the little white rabbit in her sights.

He nervously asked, "What do I need to do?"

Yanshin Fei fixed her deep gaze on his lips, saying nothing.

Yu Zhu Yi felt the heat of her stare and looked back at her with wide, pleading eyes. Yanshin Fei was simply waiting for him to make a move.

With no other choice, the little cutie stood up and quickly planted a kiss on her cheek. Afterward, he glanced around, half-expecting someone to have seen him, and sighed in relief when he confirmed no one had.

Yanshin Fei merely said, "You owe me," before swiftly helping him finish the rest of his food.

Yu Zhu Yi thought he must have misheard and didn't dwell on it. 

Once they were done eating, Yanshin Fei quickly pulled out a card to pay the bill. After settling up, she grabbed the little cutie and rushed toward the car.

Feeling confused, the little cutie noticed Yanshin Fei seemed rather anxious, leading him to believe something important was about to happen. So, he followed her with a serious expression.

Once they were in the car, Yanshin Fei cupped the back of his head and leaned down to kiss him fervently. The intensity caught the little cutie off guard, leaving him dazed. It dawned on him that he hadn’t misheard anything back at the restaurant.

In a moment of instinct, he wrapped his arms around her.

After the kiss ended, they pulled away, and the little cutie was left breathless, while Yanshin Fei appeared calm, though her eyes sparkled with deep affection.

Feeling as if he had just been pulled from the depths of a swimming pool, Yu Zhu Yi touched his lips and realized they were swollen from the kiss. He was about to complain to Yanshin Fei when he noticed her dark gaze still fixed on his lips. Suddenly, he took a step back, his hands covering his mouth in defense, staring at her with an expression that screamed betrayal.

Yanshin Fei licked her lips, a teasing smile playing on her face.

Yu Zhu Yi’s heart raced like a wild deer.

Seeing his reaction, Yanshin Fei decided to lighten the mood and asked, "So, shall we go watch a movie next?"

"Sure, sister, whatever you plan," he replied, still flustered.

Yanshin Fei drove them to a nearby cinema. She instructed the little cutie to pick a movie he wanted to see while she went off to buy popcorn.

Approaching the popcorn counter, Yanshin Fei confidently said, "I'll have a bucket of popcorn, please."

The attendant's heart raced as she recognized Yanshin Fei, feeling a rush of excitement. "Oh no, it's that heart-fluttering feeling."

Yanshin Fei noticed her flustered demeanor and asked with concern, "Are you okay?"

The attendant quickly waved her hands, swallowing nervously. "I'm fine, really."

Inside, the attendant's heart was bursting with joy: Ahh, her voice is so beautiful, and she even cares about me!

Blushing bright red, she lowered her gaze and hurriedly handed Yanshin Fei the popcorn, along with a notebook and a pen. "Sister, can I get your autograph?"

Yanshin Fei paid for the popcorn, still puzzled. "But I’m not a celebrity. Is that really necessary?"

The attendant eagerly nodded. "It’s fine! I really like you, and I want your signature."

With a nod, Yanshin Fei signed the notebook before heading back to the little cutie.

The attendant watched Yanshin Fei leave, her eyes sparkling as she spotted her walk over to a cute guy nearby. She sighed enviously, "How lucky to be her boyfriend!"

Yanshin Fei returned to the little cutie, her serious demeanor melting away like ice in spring.

She noticed he had already bought tickets and was surprised to see they were for a horror movie. Curiously, she asked, "You... like this kind of film?" Her expression was one of bemusement.

In her eyes, Yu Zhu Yi was still a delicate little cutie who needed protection; she couldn't believe he actually wanted to watch a horror film.

Yu Zhu Yi's heart tightened, but he pretended to be calm and nodded.

Truthfully, he had ulterior motives; he had read online that couples often went to see horror films on dates.

Netizens had said that when a couple watched a horror movie, the girlfriend would get scared and jump into her boyfriend's arms. He wanted that moment with Yanshin Fei, and just thinking about it made his heart race.

Yanshin Fei raised an eyebrow. "Alright, let's go in. Here, this is the popcorn I got for you." She handed the popcorn over to Yu Zhu Yi, a playful smile spreading across her face.
