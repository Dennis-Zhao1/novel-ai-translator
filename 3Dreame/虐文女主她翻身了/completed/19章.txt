**Chapter 19: The Unexpected Golden Finger**

The old man shot him a look, saying, "I’m not blaming you. I just want to know who performed first aid for me. I’d like to express my gratitude."

"Oh, that young lady is sitting right in front of us. We can thank her after we get off the plane," the middle-aged man replied.

The elder nodded. "Young people these days are becoming more and more capable."

However, once they disembarked from the plane, the middle-aged man couldn't find Yan Xinfeng anywhere. She had to rush off to a meeting scheduled for half an hour later.

——— Divider Line ——— I’m the adorable divider line ———

Xu Limei, Wen Qingzhi's assistant, rushed over with a beaming smile, clutching her phone. "Qingzhi! Qingzhi! The head of that variety show just called. He specifically requested you! Just a few days ago, he was scoffing at the idea of you participating in this show. Now, after you finally land a spot, it's being snatched away, and they’re begging you to join!"

Wen Qingzhi put on a demure facade, saying, "Sister Xu, don’t say it like that. Others have money and connections. It’s only natural that they snatched my spot. I can only blame myself..." As she spoke, her gaze fell, briefly shadowed by a tinge of gloom. A fleeting smirk crossed her lips, unnoticed by anyone around her.

Xu Limei pointed at her head, exclaiming, "You’re too kind! They’ve taken away your chance at the variety show, and you’re not even mad? If it were me, I would have..."

She continued, "Besides, you have President Lu backing you. You should take those people to task and show them who they can mess with and who they can’t! They’ve already bullied you, and you’re still like this. No wonder..."

She sighed, "What would you do without me around?" After a few more words of encouragement, Xu Limei hurried off to prepare for Wen Qingzhi’s participation in the variety show.

“Ding! Your Faith Points +1.”

“Ding! Your Acting Skills +1.” An electronic voice echoed in Wen Qingzhi's mind.

Wen Qingzhi wasn’t originally from this world; she had crossed over after dying in the cultivation realm. Upon her rebirth here, she discovered a performance system in her mind. As long as she gained others’ faith points, her acting skills would improve.

Wen Qingzhi felt like the heroine of this world, especially since the heavens had allowed her to be reborn here and even granted her a "golden finger"—wasn’t that the treatment of a protagonist?

In her previous life in the cultivation realm, she was just an average disciple, lacking any extraordinary talent. However, she happened to stumble upon the once-in-a-century forbidden secret realm, a necessary trial for new disciples.

Usually, this trial could yield a lot of treasures, and it was understood that there wouldn’t be any life-threatening creatures inside, as the dangerous beings had already been cleared away by the celestial realm.

Unfortunately, she encountered a corrupted celestial beast during her trial. The group of disciples bravely charged at the corrupted beast, knowing that escape was impossible. If they fought back, they might have a chance at survival; if they gave up, death was certain. But Wen Qingzhi quietly abandoned them and attempted to flee, ultimately losing her life. In the forbidden secret realm, her strength was akin to that of a mosquito, easily crushed.

Though she had been reborn here without bringing any celestial techniques with her, Wen Qingzhi believed that possessing a system made her invincible; she was the protagonist of this world.

In reality, she was just a glitch in this world, fortuitously caught in a temporal vortex that transported her soul here after her demise.
