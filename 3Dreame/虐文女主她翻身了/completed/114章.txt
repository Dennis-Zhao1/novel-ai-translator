Chao Yixiu felt a wave of relief wash over him. Yes, after yesterday's events, it was clear that Zhao Min had finally come to terms with his feelings. If it weren't for that, he might have been waiting for an eternity, not that he minded the wait. However, if he had the chance to secure the treasure in his heart a little sooner, that would be ideal. After all, there was always that fear lingering in his mind—the fear that someone else might covet his precious gem. He was, after all, someone who shone brightly and drew attention.

Inside the hospital room, the atmosphere was warm and inviting.

[Flashback to the previous night’s banquet]

Xu Xiaoxiao had a great admiration for Yan Xinfeng, not to mention that Yan was exceptionally capable. Therefore, even amidst the festivities, Xu Zhengwei and Yan Xinfeng managed to strike up a partnership. This collaboration was fraught with risk, requiring both parties to possess exceptional business acumen. A single misstep could lead to devastating losses. Yet, with risk came the potential for substantial reward.

Their lively discussion at the banquet caught the attention of the seasoned veterans present, who realized that the Xu and Yan families were poised to ascend to even greater heights. This understanding made it clear that they needed to cultivate a relationship with them. However, for those who couldn’t secure a share of the pie, it was wiser to sit back and watch the developments unfold—to avoid drawing unwanted attention to themselves.

As they pondered this, many recalled the fervent pursuit of Lu Xiuming by Yan Xinfeng, which had garnered much fanfare. Yet, he had dismissed it all with contempt. One had to wonder if he now regretted that choice. After all, anyone with a shred of sense would choose the president of the Yan family over a no-name artist. Moreover, it was clear that the artist had her own agenda; otherwise, she wouldn’t have been able to climb so high in the Lu family’s ranks.

The subtle glances exchanged among the crowd did not escape Wen Qingzhi's notice. However, there wasn't much she could do about it. She had just started her career and was already plagued by controversy, having become infamous instead of famous. While she longed for recognition, this was not the kind of notoriety she had hoped for. If she accumulated too much dirt on her name now, wouldn’t it be even harder for her to marry into a wealthy family in the future?

It was all that wretched woman’s fault. Why couldn’t she just play her role and follow Lu Xiuming around like a devoted fan? Wouldn’t it have been easier to hand over her shares in the company without a fuss?

Wen Qingzhi seethed with resentment.

——————————小剧场——————————

Zhao the Rabbit had no idea that the Big Bad Wolf before him thought he was merely playing hide and seek. If he had known, he might have burst with frustration. Chao Yixiu—the Big Bad Wolf—looked at the rabbit he had nurtured, finding more joy in him with each passing day. He longed for him to grow up quickly, so they could…

Though no interspecies romances existed in the forest yet, he believed he could be the pioneer. He had already taken the rabbit as his partner to care for.

Zhao the Rabbit remained blissfully unaware of the wolf's true intentions. He had always thought that the wolf considered him nothing more than a meal. And so, time passed under the wolf's nurturing gaze, and two months slipped by.

As spring arrived, life began to blossom all around. Spring was a time for growth, and Zhao the Rabbit felt that the wolf's gaze had grown even more intense recently. It led him to believe that his days were numbered.

Chao Yixiu indeed wanted to devour the rabbit—but it was a different kind of hunger. Finally, one stormy night, the wolf excitedly carried Zhao the Rabbit back to his den.

Zhao the Rabbit looked at him in terror, silently pleading that if he were to be eaten, the wolf might be gentle about it, for he feared pain. However, the wolf misinterpreted his gaze as eagerness, thinking the rabbit couldn’t wait to be with him…

After a long wait, what echoed from the den was a series of blush-inducing sounds...

Zhao the Rabbit, in a daze, suddenly understood that the wolf's previous looks had been of a different nature entirely.

In the end, they happily lived together. —【The End】
