She was genuinely praising her.

Excited, Lucy Xu strode towards Serena Yan, with Max Xu curiously trailing behind her. As Serena engaged in conversation, she noticed a somewhat familiar figure approaching. Her eyebrows raised slightly in surprise; she hadn’t expected to see her here.

Lucy rushed to Serena’s side, her eyes sparkling with excitement. Her expression resembled that of a little puppy eagerly awaiting its owner.

“Big Sis, you look amazing today!” Lucy exclaimed.

“Thank you, you look lovely too,” Serena replied.

Hearing Serena’s compliment made Lucy’s heart swell with joy. After all, who wouldn’t enjoy being told they looked good, especially by someone they admired? At that moment, Lucy felt as if she could float away. Her cheeks flushed, and she had a bashful air about her, as if she had something more to say but was too shy to voice it.

Serena couldn’t help but wonder—are people nowadays really that easily embarrassed? Could it be that her polite “thank you,” combined with a sincere compliment, had such an effect?

Max, on the other hand, felt a bit uncomfortable watching Lucy. He had never seen her shy around another girl before. If he didn’t know better, he would have thought Lucy had just spotted her crush.

From what he understood, Lucy would have loved to stick to Serena like glue if she could.

Clearing his throat, Max held up his glass of red wine and stepped forward. “I’ve long heard of your esteemed reputation, Ms. Yan. Today, seeing you in person, it’s clear you live up to the hype.”

Serena recognized that this was Mr. Xu, the host of tonight’s event, and given the way he interacted with Lucy, it was easy to guess their father-daughter relationship. She humbly replied, “I’m just a humble person with some talent; how could I possibly compare to you, Mr. Xu?”

Max noted her composed demeanor—she showed neither pride nor discomfort in being complimented. This only increased his satisfaction with her. It was rare to see young people today with such composure.

He let out a hearty laugh. “Haha, Ms. Yan, you truly are... By the way, do you know my daughter?”

Although his question felt somewhat redundant, Serena didn’t show any irritation. “Indeed, we’ve met.”

“Then what do you think of her...” His unfinished sentence left little doubt about what he was asking.

“Your daughter is a lively and kind girl; I like her very much,” Serena replied sincerely.

Max studied Serena’s expression carefully and saw that she was genuine, not just flattering for business reasons, which put him at ease. Meanwhile, Lucy was left puzzled by their conversation but felt elated to hear Serena say she liked her.

A blush crept onto Lucy's cheeks as she blinked her big eyes, taking a deep breath as if she were regaining her composure. She shyly smiled at Serena.

Max couldn’t help but notice his daughter’s bashful demeanor. He sighed deeply, “Ah…”

At that moment, he finally noticed Yu Zhu Yi standing beside Serena. “And who might this be...?”

“He’s my companion and boyfriend,” Serena said, playfully squeezing the little cutie’s hand.

“Hello, Mr. Xu,” Yu greeted obediently.

Max studied Yu’s face, feeling a sense of familiarity. “If I may ask, who is your father...?”

“Yu Bo Chuan,” Yu replied.

“Oh, so you’re Mr. Yu’s son. No wonder you seemed familiar! I hadn’t realized; I’ve heard about you. Your father used to hold quite a position in the business world, and it seems you’ve surpassed him in excellence. By the way, how is your grandfather doing these days?” 

Max couldn’t help but express his admiration.

“Everything is well; I’ll be sure to pass on your regards to him,” Yu answered politely. 

The atmosphere was warm and friendly, an intriguing blend of admiration and youthful affection swirling around them.
