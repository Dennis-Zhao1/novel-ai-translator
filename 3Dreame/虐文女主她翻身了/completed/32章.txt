**Chapter 32: Forming a Team for the Search**

As everyone snapped back to reality and prepared to ask the director for more details, they were met with a shocking revelation: the director had vanished. Yes, he had left—left without a trace, like a ghost slipping into the night.

The director floated away effortlessly, leaving no clouds in his wake, just as he had come.

“Xinfai, do you have any plans?” Wen Qingzhi tried to coax a response from Yan Xinfai, but sadly, her hopes were destined to be dashed.

“Plans? What plans could I have?” Yan Xinfai replied nonchalantly, her indifference sparking irritation in Wen Qingzhi.

“You’re the biggest investor, right? How can you not know? You…” Wen Qingzhi began, but suddenly realized something and fell silent.

Yan Xinfai raised an eyebrow, genuinely perplexed. “Are you implying that as the largest investor, I should be scheming for my own benefit? Why would you think that? Do you often do such things?”

Wen Qingzhi, flustered, exclaimed, “That’s not what I meant! I…”

“What did you mean, then? I never said anything about your intentions,” Yan Xinfai interrupted, leaving Wen Qingzhi speechless. She felt trapped, unable to voice her thoughts but equally unable to swallow them back down, a frustrating knot in her throat.

**Live Chat Room ↔ [Palette]**: This director has a strong survival instinct; clearly afraid of being interrogated by the artists, he slipped away before they even had a chance to process what just happened.

**[╰つ゛Miss Anonymous]**: Everyone: I’m completely dumbfounded! The director actually sneaked away!

**[Longing Words Soak the Heart]**: The variety show crew can't even provide them with food? Poor kids. (pats head)

**[Let's Not Disturb Each Other]**: On the surface, Sister Yan seems calm and unbothered; but inside, she’s thinking, “What do we do now? Where can we find food? Stay calm, stay calm... I can’t let anyone see me panic as the boss!”

**[€Heart Silver]**: What does Wen Qingzhi mean by that? Is she slandering Sister Yan?

**[Fan of Qingzhi]**: How could Qingzhi ever slander Yan Xinfai?

**[Milk Tea for Life]**: What Wen Qingzhi said is so easily misunderstood. She can’t possibly be doing it on purpose, right?

**[Curse You, Circle]**: I’ve noticed that Wen Qingzhi has been saying some suggestive things ever since Yan Xinfai arrived.

**[Love Qingzhi]**: No way! I will always support Sister Qingzhi!

**[Xie Xie the Machine]**: Is that the cute girl next to Yan Xinfai? I find Xu Xiaoxiao adorable too. (sending heart ❤)

**[Grain of Wheat]**: I agree with the person above.

**[Eiffel Tower Dreams]**: Is anyone still here? I just found some info. Yan Xinfai is truly powerful, influential, and beautiful.

The information revealed: Yan Xinfai, 24 years old, born in the capital, has always been the pride of her family, consistently winning national scholarships throughout her educational journey. She graduated from the prestigious Di Yun University, pursued a master’s degree, and during her university years, she had already started managing her family’s business. Now, she is the president of the Yan Corporation and the head of the Yan family.

**[Changsha Girl Loves Xinfai]**: That’s amazing! I thought so! Sister Yan has that CEO aura; indeed, she’s on a whole different level from us mere mortals. Truly impressive.

**[Loving Sweet Bitter Melon]**: I’m in love!

**[Spicy Caviar]**: I’m impressed.

**[Carrot Cubes]**: I’m a fan now.

Amidst the discussions, there were a few voices attempting to defend Wen Qingzhi, but they quickly got drowned out by the flood of other comments.

Wen Qingzhi didn’t dare to trip up Yan Xinfai in front of everyone because she had just received a notification from her system—a warning that her faith value was fluctuating, rising and falling repeatedly. She was anxious that if this continued, it would easily lower the public’s faith in her.

Yan Xinfai noticed that Wen Qingzhi’s silence was somewhat regrettable. Just moments ago, she felt an unusual force emanating from Wen Qingzhi, subtly interfering with the world around her. The power was faint but undeniably present. Yan Xinfai, with her strong mental faculties, could sense it, even though she couldn’t harness her psychic abilities unless her life was in danger.

Though she didn’t know the source of this power, she wasn’t in a hurry to find out. After all, there was plenty of time; she would eventually uncover the truth.

Xu Xiaoxiao timidly approached Yan Xinfai and asked, “Sister Yan, can I join you?”

Feeling a fondness for the girl, Yan Xinfai nodded. Xu Xiaoxiao’s eyes lit up with surprise and joy, her face blossoming into a radiant smile. “So where are we going now?”

“Let’s head that way and see what we can find,” Yan Xinfai suggested.

Wen Qingzhi stood watching them leave, her face contorting with frustration for a brief moment before she composed herself and pretended to be hurt as she turned away.

Song Lin and the others noticed her discomfort, hesitating for a moment before approaching her to ask if she wanted to team up with them. After all, as three grown men, they couldn’t just leave a girl like Wen Qingzhi behind. It would surely incite backlash on social media if they did.
