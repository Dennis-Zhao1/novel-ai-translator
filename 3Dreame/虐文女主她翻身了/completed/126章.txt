As soon as he heard the commotion, the ambulance had already arrived. 

Paramedics carefully placed Yvonne Yan onto a stretcher, her fragile form lying limp as they moved with urgency. 

Ethan Yu followed closely behind them, his heart racing. 

“Are you a family member of the patient?” one of the paramedics asked, his voice steady yet concerned. 

Ethan could barely choke out a response, “Yes.” 

The word hung in the air, heavy with unspoken anguish, and he fell silent, his focus shifting to the scene unfolding before him. Before stepping into the ambulance, he cast a lingering glance back at Vanessa Wen. 

That look was rife with an intensity of hatred that could chill anyone to the bone.

Understanding the urgency, the paramedics swiftly transported Yvonne to the hospital, leaving behind a mix of onlookers and Vanessa, who had been involved in the incident but had not fled the scene. 

Vanessa sensed the weight of Ethan's glare upon her, a palpable hostility that sent shivers down her spine. Fear gnawed at her, but as the thought of Yvonne potentially being dead crossed her mind, a defiant smirk twisted her lips.

Once the ambulance sped away, the police arrived on the scene. The officer in charge found it peculiar that those involved had not left. Yet, he didn’t pry; instead, he moved to escort Vanessa away.

Vanessa felt a strange sense of invincibility; even now, she perceived herself as the main character in this narrative, believing that this incident wouldn’t change anything for her.

Upon arrival at the hospital, Yvonne was rushed into the emergency operating room. 

Ethan could only wait anxiously outside. 

Half an hour later, his friends, Leo Sterling and Brian Zhao, arrived. 

From a distance, they spotted Ethan, who stood like a soulless doll, devoid of life and spirit. 

When had they ever seen him so unsettled, so broken? 

They exchanged worried glances, the gravity of the situation sinking in. What if…? 

The thought was too heavy to bear; they feared Ethan might truly lose his mind. 

But for now, comforting him felt futile. 

They could only stand by in silent support, waiting.

Six long hours dragged on. 

Ethan’s eyes remained fixed on the glowing red letters above the operating room door, a countdown that felt like an eternity. 

Finally, the ominous red light flickered out. 

The door swung open, and Ethan rushed over, desperation clear in his voice. 

“How is she…?” 

The doctor, having dealt with countless anxious family members, felt a pang of sorrow as he delivered the news. 

“The patient is no longer in critical condition and can be moved to a regular ward…” 

Before the doctor could finish, Ethan interjected, “When will she wake up?” 

“The patient’s awakening depends on her own will. It could be in a few days, or it might take months, even years.” 

Ethan barely registered when the doctor left. 

His focus was solely on the stretcher being wheeled out, revealing Yvonne’s pale face, looking as if she could slip away at any moment. 

A sharp pain pierced Ethan’s chest, rendering him almost breathless. 

His hands trembled, resembling a marionette as he followed the nurses pushing her along.

…

Once inside the hospital room, it was just Ethan and his sister lying unconscious on the bed. 

He cautiously stepped closer, extending his cold fingers to touch her pale cheek. 

A wave of self-loathing washed over him; he felt responsible for not protecting her better. 

Tears, like pearls from a broken string, silently fell from the corners of his eyes.

(இωஇ ) Poor Ethan: It’s all my fault. 
Yvonne: No, it’s not your fault. (hugs you)
