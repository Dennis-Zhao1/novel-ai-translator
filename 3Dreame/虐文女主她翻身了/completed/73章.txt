**Chapter 73: Sister is So Charming**

Yan Xinfei felt that Yu Zhuo was the type who, after learning a lesson, would forget the pain—much like those kindergarten kids who, drawn to something fun, rush over only to hurt themselves and cry, yet still return to the same attractions. 

Right now, she was completely oblivious to the terror she had felt on the roller coaster and in the haunted house! 

The little cutie’s face, though not as pale as before, was now glowing with excitement as she gazed at the towering Ferris wheel in the distance.

Yu Zhuo released his grip on his sister and instead tugged at the hem of her clothes.

With the soft jade in his arms gone, Yan Xinfei felt a twinge of regret. 

She cast a slightly predatory glance at the delicate, pale skin of the little cutie’s neck, which revealed just a hint of softness. 

Feeling a sudden chill on his neck, Yu Zhuo instinctively shrank back but then thought better of it and bravely stretched his neck out again. 

Seeing how sensitive he had become, Yan Xinfei couldn’t help but chuckle to herself. 

No rush; one day, she would…

“Sister, sister, can we go ride the Ferris wheel now?” The little cutie looked up at Yan Xinfei with sparkling eyes, full of joy. 

Yan Xinfei adored the way the little cutie’s eyes lit up. 

If someone were to ask her why she loved that look so much, she wouldn’t quite know how to explain it. 

Everyone else could see why she cherished that gaze—it was because she loved the light in the little cutie’s eyes. 

Unbeknownst to her, the little cutie had already nestled into her heart.

Yan Xinfei pulled out her phone to check the time. 

Hmm, it was still early; just past five o'clock.

She nodded towards the little cutie, saying, “Alright, I’ll go buy the tickets. You wait here for me, okay?”

The ticket counter for the Ferris wheel was manned by a young woman whose eyes sparkled as she watched Yan Xinfei approach. Her heart raced—she really liked this kind of girl but wondered if she had a boyfriend or girlfriend. 

As Yan Xinfei reached the counter, the staff member quickly composed herself. 

“Hello, could I have two tickets for the Ferris wheel, please?” 

Her voice was polite yet slightly cold. 

The young woman snapped back to reality and hurriedly handed over two tickets. 

Then, with a hint of shyness, she asked, “Sister, um… could I add you on WeChat?” 

Yan Xinfei had always been gentle and patient with girls, especially since this one clearly had feelings for her. In keeping with her nurturing spirit towards the little cutie, Yan Xinfei decided to be especially kind to this staff member. 

If you were to ask why she wasn’t as patient with that “white moonlight” person, she would certainly roll her eyes and say, “Is that even a girl? More like a typical white lotus! I just prefer soft and sweet beings, not just any girl.” 

After a moment of consideration, she nodded and took out her phone, opening the WeChat friend-add feature with the QR code. 

The staff member’s hands trembled with excitement as she scanned the code, repeatedly saying, “Thank you, thank you!” 

“No need to thank me,” Yan Xinfei replied. 

Inside, the staff member was screaming: Ahhhh! Not only is she gorgeous, but her voice is so nice, and she’s so sweet! 

After agreeing to the staff member’s request, Yan Xinfei took her tickets and headed back to the little cutie. 

The ticket seller watched Yan Xinfei walk away, her heart racing, completely smitten. 

When she saw Yan Xinfei approach a boy who looked to still be a student, she noticed that although Yan Xinfei wasn’t smiling, her eyes were warm—clearly the look of someone who had found their beloved. 

The staff member's heart sank at the realization that the gorgeous girl she had just met had a boyfriend.

But soon, her expression brightened with excitement as she saw the boy acting like a little puppy, playfully charming Yan Xinfei. 

(⊙o⊙) Wow, her sister is so charming! Her boyfriend and sister are such a perfect match! I ship this, I really do!
