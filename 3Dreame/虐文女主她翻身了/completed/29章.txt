**Chapter 29: Recording the Show**

In her heart, Wen Qingzhi couldn't help but scoff, "These people are just idiots; they deserve to wait." 

She had learned the day before that of the four other artists participating in the variety show, none held any significant status or fanbase in the entertainment industry. However, there was one special guest slated to appear, and Wen Qingzhi believed building a connection with this guest would be far more beneficial.

Five minutes later, the director arrived. Clearing his throat, he announced, "This recording session will last one full day and into the night. During this time, please hand over your phones, wallets, bank cards, and similar items. Compliance is expected, and staff will be checking."

One by one, the artists surrendered the items the director mentioned to the staff. After a thorough check, everything was in order.

Satisfied, the director nodded and continued, "Next, we will head to the filming location in the town. Once we arrive, you'll complete the tasks assigned by the production team."

As they traveled the bumpy road to the small-town filming site, Wen Qingzhi couldn't stop complaining about the long journey, the uncomfortable seating, and the rough ride. 

The female artist sitting next to her shot her a disapproving glance, a flicker of annoyance and disdain in her eyes, but chose to ignore her, instead subtly distancing herself.

After an hour and a half, they finally reached their destination: a beautiful but somewhat secluded small town. 

Upon arrival, the staff began setting up the live stream. Initially, there weren’t many viewers—just a few thousand scattered across the platform—since this recording wasn’t particularly popular. Still, some fans tuned in specifically to see Wen Qingzhi.

"**Wen Qingzhi is my wife**": Wifey! I’m here to check in.  
"**Red Dragonfly**": Qingzhi, I’m here!  
"**My Wen Qingzhi**": Finally, I can see Qingzhi in the live stream!  
"**Little Bear**": Qingzhi looks stunning even up close!  
…………

The production team noticed that most viewers were there to see Wen Qingzhi and directed the majority of the camera shots toward her. 

Wen Qingzhi had joined the show with a hunch that it would help her gain popularity. After her rebirth, she found her instincts were often spot on.

Once they stepped out of the vehicle, the director instructed them to find their accommodations and organize their rooms and luggage. 

When everyone was finally ready and emerged, the director announced some exciting news: a special guest would be arriving soon.

The artists exchanged hushed speculations about who it might be. One male artist boldly asked, "Director, is the guest a male star or a female star?"

The director, wearing a mysterious smile, replied, "Neither. Alright, enough guessing; you'll find out soon."

Just five minutes later, a vibrant voice echoed from a distance. Wen Qingzhi, along with the others, looked on with curiosity at the approaching figure. Upon closer inspection, she felt an odd sense of familiarity.

As the figure drew nearer, disbelief washed over her. She was fixed on the person approaching, unable to look away.

Yes, the special guest for the variety show was Yan Xinfei. The original owner of Wen Qingzhi's body owed a favor to the producer of this show, who had invited Yan Xinfei as a way to repay that debt. However, Yan Xinfei refused to participate as a mere ordinary guest; instead, he invested in the show, becoming its largest investor, while insisting that he must appear as a special guest.

Of course, Yan Xinfei felt that he could not afford to lose his aura as a big shot. How could he participate as a commoner?

With a grin, the director turned to everyone and said, "Alright, now that everyone is here, the production team will assign your tasks for today."
