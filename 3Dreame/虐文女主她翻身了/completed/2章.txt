**Chapter 1: The Encounter**

In the reception area, a man was furiously questioning the female secretary who had just spoken to him. “Why hasn’t Yvonne come yet? She dares to make me wait? Isn’t she the one who begged me to meet her? Unbelievable…”

The secretary listened to the man, whose name was Lu Qiuming, with a pale expression. Unable to hold back any longer, she said, “Mr. Lu, the president has said she doesn’t wish to see you. Please leave and stop causing a scene; you’re disrupting the company.”

Lu Qiuming laughed in disbelief. “I’m causing a scene? Fine, but let your president not regret this. She won’t be able to demand my presence anymore…”

As he spoke, he attempted to push the secretary aside, only to be met by an invisible force that sent him stumbling back. He hit his face against the desk, the sudden pain causing him to pale instantly.

A cool, familiar voice drifted into his ears. “You think I’m begging you? Ha! You really have a big ego.”

He turned to see Yvonne standing there, his shock evident as he blinked in disbelief. “You dare to insult me? Don’t forget who’s the one tangled up in this drama—you’re the one who came looking for me!”

Yvonne, her face twisted in disdain, replied, “You were just a toy for me to play with when I was bored. I used to find you interesting, but now? You’re not even worth a dog’s attention. Get over yourself.”

Lu Qiuming was furious, staring at Yvonne with intensity. He noticed the change in her; she now exuded a commanding aura, colder and more stunning than before, like a once-dusty pearl shining bright again.

Caught off guard by her beauty, he felt a flicker of attraction. Yet, he quickly recalled how Yvonne had pursued him before—like a little puppy, sweet when she wanted something and utterly ignored when she didn’t.

The thought filled him with disgust. “I don’t believe you’ve actually lost interest in me, Yvonne,” he said, a realization dawning on him. “Oh, is this your new tactic? Playing hard to get? You…”

Yvonne, unfazed, signaled for security to escort Lu Qiuming out. She instructed the front desk and security to remember his face, ensuring he wouldn’t be allowed back in to avoid any disturbances to the staff.

Lu Qiuming’s face darkened as he shouted in anger, “Yvonne, what’s wrong with you? You’ll regret this!”

He shoved past the security guard trying to restrain him and stormed out, shaking his sleeves in frustration.

Meanwhile, the secretary watched Yvonne with starry eyes, captivated by her commanding presence. “Wow, the president is so strong and fierce!”

Yvonne cast a glance at Lu Qiuming’s profile. His silvery hair flowed elegantly, with bangs dancing in the breeze. His light golden eyes hinted at a certain charisma, adorned by ocean-blue earrings. His high nose and perfectly sculpted features were almost like a masterpiece, with lips that seemed impossibly perfect. Yet, to Yvonne, he radiated nothing but the aura of a player—a scoundrel.

Despite acknowledging that Lu Qiuming was indeed handsome, she couldn’t understand why the original owner of her body had fallen so hard for him, following him around like a lost puppy, sacrificing everything for him, only to end up with nothing.

It was unfortunate; his character had dragged down his good looks. Yvonne felt no stirrings of affection as she regarded his beauty, baffled at how the original owner had been reduced to such a state. Truly, men were nothing but distractions that slowed down one’s own progress.
