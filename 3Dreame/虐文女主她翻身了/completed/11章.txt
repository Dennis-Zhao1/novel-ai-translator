**Illness**

After arriving at the hospital, Lucas Qiuming was immediately struck by the sight of Wendy Qingzhi lying on the hospital bed, her face pale and frail. Concern flooded his voice as he approached her, “How are you feeling? What happened? What’s wrong?”

Wendy managed a weak smile, her voice barely above a whisper. “Don't worry about me, Lucas. I just have a cold and a slight fever. I’ll be fine soon.”

Lucas studied her closely, noticing the starkness of her pallor. His voice softened as he asked, “Did you eat lunch?”

Wendy shook her head, her tone apologetic. “I’m sorry, but I didn’t have an appetite. I just can’t eat anything right now.”

“That’s nonsense! You have to eat, especially when you’re sick. You need nutritious food to get better. Look at you, you’ve lost weight. It’s breaking my heart to see you like this.” He quickly instructed his assistant to fetch some light porridge for Wendy.

Before long, the assistant returned with the porridge, and Lucas personally fed it to Wendy, his expression a mix of tenderness and concern.

Once she finished the porridge, Wendy looked up at him with glistening eyes. “Lucas, my spot on the variety show was taken by someone else. I’m so upset. They have power and connections, and I fought for so long to earn that spot. How could they just take it away? You must think it’s my fault for not being capable enough. If only…”

If Yan Xinfeng were here, she’d definitely roll her eyes and say, “What a classic damsel in distress.”

Seeing Wendy so heartbroken made Lucas’s heart ache. He instantly pulled her into his arms, comforting her. “Hey, don’t be sad. I’ll make sure to get that spot back for you. It’s just a variety show slot; I’ll get it for you, I promise.” He gently wiped away her tears with his thumb.

“Lucas, you’re so wonderful. If it weren’t for you…” Wendy gazed at him with deep affection.

Clearing his throat, Lucas met her gaze and, without thinking too much, leaned in and kissed her gently, ignoring the assistant standing nearby. Wendy instinctively pushed him away, but her feeble attempt was easily brushed aside, making it feel more like she was holding back her words. Still, she paused, her voice barely above a whisper. “Do you think I don’t like it when you kiss me?”

She hurried to clarify, “No, no! I do like it.” Hearing her response, Lucas leaned in for another kiss.

As they broke apart, Wendy shot him a playful glare, making it clear she was aware of his intention to kiss her again. Quickly, she covered her lips, and Lucas chuckled, about to say something when the phone rang, interrupting the moment. With an apologetic glance at Wendy, he answered the call.

“Yes,” “Alright,” “I’ll be there shortly.”

Once he hung up, Wendy smiled understandingly. “Lucas, you should go take care of your work. I’ll be fine, so don’t worry about me. Your job is important.”

“I'm so sorry, Wendy. I have an important collaboration to attend to. I’ll come back to see you as soon as I can. Make sure to rest well and take care of yourself.” With that, he hurried out the door.

After Lucas left, Wendy’s assistant looked at her with envy. “Mr. Lucas is really good to you.” Wendy smiled sweetly, pretending to be shy as she lowered her head, masking the flicker of disdain and determination in her eyes.

Back at the company, Lucas instructed his assistant, Cheng, to secure that variety show spot for Wendy. After handling that, he dove into discussions about the collaboration. Yet, a nagging feeling lingered in the back of his mind—something felt off, but after racking his brain, he dismissed it as unimportant and moved on.
