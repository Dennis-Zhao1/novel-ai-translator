### Chapter 47: He Finally Got to Eat the Food She Made, and He Was Happy

Yu Zhuyi sat on the sofa, flipping through channels on the TV with a remote control, but his mind was elsewhere as he absentmindedly watched the screen.

He really wanted to help out in the kitchen, but he quickly remembered that he had zero cooking skills. Stepping in there might just end up making things worse. 

After some internal struggle, a brilliant idea struck him: instead of barging into the kitchen, he could just stand at the doorway and sneak a peek at his sister while she cooked! What a clever little trick, he thought to himself.

With that plan in mind, he tossed the remote carelessly onto the sofa and tiptoed toward the kitchen. As he walked, he noticed that the soft slippers he wore made a faint sound with every step. Not wanting to attract his sister's attention, he decided to take them off and padded barefoot toward the kitchen door.

He pressed his body against the door frame, poking his head out just enough to catch sight of his sister cooking. Yu Zhuyi thought he was being quite stealthy, but he didn’t realize that Yan Xinfey had already spotted him the moment he got there.

As he nervously watched, he suddenly saw his sister approaching him. Startled, he stumbled back a few steps, nearly tripping over himself.

“姐姐……” he called out softly, his voice barely above a whisper.

Yan Xinfey glanced at him but didn’t reply, instead heading over to the sofa. Yu Zhuyi felt a bit lost and worried that he had upset her, his eyes darting anxiously towards her.

To his surprise, Yan Xinfey picked up the cute, pink slippers he had just discarded and placed them on the ground. Then, she knelt down to help him put them back on.

“Why aren’t you wearing shoes? You might catch a chill!” she scolded gently.

Relief washed over Yu Zhuyi as he realized she wasn’t angry. Her words warmed his heart.

“I won’t forget to wear shoes next time, I promise,” he replied softly.

“Just stand at the door if you want to watch me cook. Don’t come in; it’s too smoky in here,” Yan Xinfey instructed.

So, he stood at the kitchen entrance, openly watching his sister as she worked her magic. 

He watched as she heated the oil, tossed in slices of ginger and chicken, and then added fresh bamboo shoots and red bell peppers, seasoning it all with salt and MSG to create a fragrant stir-fry. The dish was quickly transformed into a beautiful plate of stir-fried chicken with bamboo shoots.

As the delicious aroma wafted over to him, Yu Zhuyi realized he was feeling a bit hungry, despite having eaten not too long ago. But how could he not be? His sister’s cooking smelled incredible!

Time slipped by as he stood there, captivated by Yan Xinfey in the kitchen. Eventually, she finished cooking and called out to him to help set the table.

A few minutes later, the dining table was filled with an array of colorful and appetizing dishes: spicy diced chicken, stir-fried shredded pork with green peppers, sweet and sour ribs, sesame sauce mixed with green beans, stir-fried chicken with bamboo shoots, sweet and sour fish, broccoli, and stir-fried shredded carrots.

Yu Zhuyi couldn’t wait to dig in. He noticed that although he had eaten these dishes many times before, his sister’s cooking was leagues ahead of anyone else’s.

“姐姐, your cooking is amazing! It’s even better than what the chefs make,” he exclaimed, genuinely impressed.

“Take your time. If you like it, eat as much as you want,” she encouraged.

“No matter how slowly I eat, I’ll finish it. If only you could…” Yu Zhuyi hesitated, hoping she would suggest cooking for him more often.

Yan Xinfey picked up on his unspoken wish and said playfully, “If you want, I can have the chef cook for you every day. Don’t worry; I won’t charge you a dime.”

His face fell at that suggestion, and to hide his disappointment, he forced a smile. “Sure, thanks so much, 姐姐.”

Yan Xinfey couldn't help but chuckle at his reaction. Yu Zhuyi knew she was teasing him, but he wasn’t mad. He looked at her hopefully and asked again, “Can you, 姐姐? I really want to eat your cooking.”

This time, Yan Xinfey nodded seriously. “Alright, I’ll cook for you.”

“Thank you, 姐姐! You’re the best!” he replied, filled with gratitude.

“Okay, enough chatting. Eat up before it gets cold,” she urged.

With that, Yu Zhuyi focused on his meal. 

An hour later, every dish that Yan Xinfey had prepared was gone. Yu Zhuyi sat back, feeling completely satisfied, rubbing his slightly bloated belly.

As he watched Yan Xinfey clean up the dishes, he stood up to help.

“Don’t worry about it, I can handle it. Just sit and relax for a bit,” she said, stopping him.

After placing the dirty dishes into the dishwasher, she turned to see Yu Zhuyi lounging awkwardly on the sofa. It was clear to her that he had overeaten.

“Lie down; I’ll give you a little massage,” she said, walking over to him.

Yu Zhuyi obediently lay back down. Yan Xinfey gently rubbed his stomach, her warm hands easing the discomfort he felt. 

He couldn’t help but feel shy under her tender touch, but soon enough, the discomfort faded away.

Fifteen minutes later, Yan Xinfey glanced down and noticed that he had fallen asleep.
