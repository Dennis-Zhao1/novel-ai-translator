**The White Moonlight Has Returned**

“Secretary Cheng, when is Qingzhi arriving?” Lu Xiuming was seated in the back of a luxury car, scrolling through hot topics in the entertainment industry on his phone. He was immediately struck by the trending news about Wen Qingzhi's debut and her return to the country today.

That's right; Wen Qingzhi had completed her studies and was finally set to debut as a hot new star.

At the airport, her fans had gathered to welcome her back, along with a swarm of journalists eager to capture the moment. After all, Wen Qingzhi was one of the hottest new artists at the moment, and many people were enamored by her looks and debut image. What reporter wouldn’t want to leverage her popularity for their next big scoop?

Wen Qingzhi had debuted with the delicate and fresh image of a soft, innocent flower, winning the hearts of many fans, especially male ones. Her image perfectly embodied the ideal of many boys' first crushes.

As Secretary Cheng helped Wen Qingzhi with her luggage, she made her way to the car where Lu Xiuming was waiting. Once she settled into the back seat, a flash from a camera captured the moment, ensuring that this scene would make headlines the next day.

With a bashful smile, Wen Qingzhi looked at Lu Xiuming and said, “Xiuming ge, it’s been so long! I heard that the Yan family head is with you…”

Her face bore a look of deep sorrow, as if she were on the verge of tears.

Lu Xiuming's mind flashed to the memory of Yan Xinfei from that day, but seeing Wen Qingzhi so heartbroken made his heart ache. He quickly reassured her, “Qingzhi, you know that I've always loved you. After you went abroad, I’ve been waiting for you. Yan Xinfei was just a passing distraction. I only engaged with her because of the tremendous benefits she offered…”

“Xiuming ge, I understand all of that. I’m just scared—scared that you might fall for her. After all, her family and status match yours perfectly, and all I have is you!” 

Wen Qingzhi cried softly as she leaned into Lu Xiuming’s embrace, relief washing over her.

Meanwhile, the other party involved, Yan Xinfei, was blissfully unaware of everything happening. She had discovered that the stone she had unearthed from the antique street closely resembled the core from a zombie from the apocalypse. Absorbing the energy from it was enough to elevate her own abilities.

Though the stone appeared plain and unremarkable, it contained immense power within. Having transmigrated into the role of the female protagonist from a tragic romance novel, Yan Xinfei knew that while the impending events had yet to unfold, strengthening herself was absolutely necessary. After all, no one could predict whether disaster might strike tomorrow. Only by becoming strong could she ensure her own safety.

She had no intentions of seeking revenge on Lu Xiuming, despite the fact that in the original narrative, he had driven the original protagonist's company to bankruptcy and forced her to exchange her heart for the one he idolized. However, those were consequences of the original protagonist’s own choices; after all, it was her fault for falling for such a scumbag.

For the sake of love, the original protagonist sacrificed everything. To Yan Xinfei, that was simply madness. She believed in a principle: If someone doesn’t offend me, I won’t offend them; but if they do, I will return the offense tenfold.

If Lu Xiuming didn’t scheme against her as he had in the original plot, then there would be no need for their paths to cross. Yan Xinfei was certainly not the type to seek vengeance for the original protagonist; she wasn’t that noble. She simply wanted to live her life well, enjoying good food, sleep, and eventually lead a peaceful retirement. Wasn’t that far better than seeking revenge on Lu Xiuming?

After all, life is neither too long nor too short—just a few decades. Wasting time on pointless matters would be a slow form of self-destruction, wouldn’t it?
