**Introducing Them to Her**

Since that banquet, Lucian and Wendy had avoided prancing around in front of Yara. 

Yara, on the other hand, had no energy to spare on them. After all, she was in the midst of a career upswing, facing a mountain of company affairs every day. 

At the same time, her relationship with Ethan was heating up. 

Before they knew it, the weekend had rolled around again. 

This day was a special one, as it was when Ethan and Yara had agreed to meet. 

In a private room at the Cloud Pavilion, two men of contrasting styles were chatting. 

Zachary sat fidgeting, anxiously eyeing the door, hoping to see it swing open at any moment. 

“Hey, do you think Ethan is running late? What if he’s having second thoughts?” 

“Not a chance. He’s probably just stuck in traffic,” replied Sean, trying to soothe Zachary’s nerves. 

“Oh, right, that makes sense.” 

“Are you hungry? You can snack on something while we wait.” 

Sean reached over to ruffle Zachary's hair. 

“I’m fine, not really hungry. Sean, quit treating me like a kid!” Zachary protested, swatting away Sean's hand. 

“Alright, alright, my bad,” Sean quickly conceded, a smirk on his face that indicated this wasn’t the first time he’d heard that complaint. 

Even though he admitted his fault, it was clear he’d do it again next time. That was just how he operated—apologetic now but bold enough to repeat the offense later. 

Just then, the door finally creaked open, and in walked Ethan, gently holding Yara’s hand. 

The moment Ethan entered, he sensed an unusual atmosphere between the two men inside. 

He glanced at Sean, who chuckled sheepishly in response. 

Ethan’s heart sank a little, realizing the implication: oh, they’re together now. 

Zachary swiftly pulled Sean to his feet. 

Ethan introduced Yara, “This is my girlfriend, and this is my good buddy.” 

Yara greeted them with a bright smile. 

“Hello, everyone.” 

“Hi… hi there! I’m Zachary!” he stammered, only to receive a sharp glare from Ethan. 

The look was unmistakably clear: Are you asking for trouble? Who said you could call her ‘sis’? 

Zachary quickly recovered, calling out loudly, “Hello, sister-in-law!” 

His voice boomed, echoing throughout the private room, much to his embarrassment. 

He couldn’t help it; the sight of Yara made him nervous. 

Besides, he thought he hadn’t made a mistake at all! 

Yara wasn’t wearing her usual business attire today. Instead, she donned a dark red dress with subtle makeup, looking like a goddess who had just strolled out of campus. 

She appeared so youthful that one could easily mistake her for a freshman. 

Sean looked at his friend with a mixture of exasperation and amusement. 

Then, in a calm tone, he added, “Hello, sister-in-law. I’m Sean. I’ve heard Ethan talk about you for a long time; it’s great to finally meet you.” 

Yara nodded politely. “I know of you both. Ethan’s current achievements wouldn’t be possible without your hard work.” 

Zachary realized she wasn’t as unapproachable as he had thought, and he felt more relaxed, like a playful puppy. 

“Not at all! It’s all Ethan’s talent. Did you know he stopped taking money from his family in high school? He started his own business back then! And you wouldn’t believe how popular he was in school—so many girls chased after him, confessing their feelings…” 

Ethan was still fine with the earlier comments, but the last part made him uncomfortable. 

Before Zachary could go further, Ethan discreetly kicked his leg. 

“Ow, what was that for?” Zachary exclaimed, bewildered as he turned to face his friend. 

His question drew everyone’s attention back to Ethan, who forced a strained smile. “Nothing, it’s fine.” 

Zachary, satisfied with that response, turned back to Yara, eager to continue his earlier train of thought. 

“Ethan… he—” 

But this time, Sean was quick to cover Zachary’s mouth. 

“Mmm… mmm!” 

Zachary’s eyes widened in shock, staring incredulously at Sean.
