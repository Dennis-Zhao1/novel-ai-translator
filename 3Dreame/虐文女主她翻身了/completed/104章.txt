Hearing her voice, he shivered slightly.  
The manager pushed open the door to the private room.  
The three "princesses" followed him inside.  
"Mr. Zhao, these are the hottest three 'princesses' in the bar. Take a look..."  
Zhao Min's eyes lit up as he caught sight of the three beauties behind the manager.  
They were stunningly beautiful, a rare find indeed.  
Each of these three "princesses" embodied a distinct type of beauty.  

The one on the left exuded a cold, alluring charm:  
Her eyes sparkled like water but held an icy coolness, as if she could see right through everything. Her slender fingers were like delicate works of art, and her skin was smooth and fair, a flawless white tinged with a hint of pink, as if she could squeeze droplets of water from it. Her lips, a deep shade of red, smiled like blooming flowers, and every movement she made seemed to dance, her long hair flowing with the gentle breeze.  

The one in the middle had a graceful and dignified appearance:  
Her youthful face was elegantly shaped, with thick, black hair cascading softly over her shoulders. She turned slightly, casting her gaze towards Zhao Min, her cheeks flushing a soft pink, radiating shyness. Her ears were beautifully shaped, pale and delicate, like finely polished jade...  
Her cheeks were full, her nose perfectly sculpted, and her big, dark eyes were enchanting and inviting. She bore small piercings in her ears, likely for earrings. There was a lively, playful demeanor about her, and when she noticed Zhao Min, a hint of bashfulness flitted across her features.  

The one on the right was fresh and unpretentious, resembling a student:  
Her fair face was framed by softly arched willow-like eyebrows. Though her eyes were not large, they revealed a depth of emotion within. Her petite nose and mouth were strikingly delicate, and her slightly curled hair added an extra touch of charm.  
With her dainty figure and graceful posture, she carried an air of slight shyness that evoked a sense of protectiveness in those who looked upon her.  
She was like a beautiful jasmine flower—pure, fresh, and fragrant, captivating all who encountered her.  

Zhao Min’s eyes reflected admiration as he nodded in satisfaction, "You can leave now."  
Upon hearing his words, the manager recognized Zhao Min’s approval and subtly signaled the girls to provide excellent service.  
They nodded in understanding.  
Feeling relieved, the manager left, closing the door behind him.  

Zhao Min watched the three girls, subconsciously comparing them to Chao Yixiu.  
What the hell, why was he always thinking about him?  
He shook his head, trying to clear his mind of those thoughts.  
Then, he cleared his throat, “Ahem, what are your names?”  
The alluring girl spoke up, “Mr. Zhao, I’m Xiao Yao, this is Xiao Tian, and the other one is Xiao Yu.”  
Xiao Yao introduced each of them.  
Xiao Tian shyly called out, “Mr. Zhao.”  
They didn’t notice the flash of jealousy that crossed Xiao Yu’s face when Xiao Yao spoke.  
She glared resentfully at what she thought was a rival for attention.  
In a soft, delicate voice, Xiao Yu cajoled, “Mr. Zhao~”  
Zhao Min shivered again, goosebumps prickling on his skin.  
He truly wasn’t accustomed to such voices.  
The other two exchanged surprised glances upon hearing Xiao Yu's overly sweet tone.  
But Xiao Yu didn’t care about their astonishment; she maintained her innocent image.  
She knew many people were drawn to her pure and schoolgirl-like appearance.  
She felt confident that she could win over Zhao Min.  
As long as she could catch his interest, even if it was just for one night, it would be worth it...  
A glint of calculation flashed in her eyes.
