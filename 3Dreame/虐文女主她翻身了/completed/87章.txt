被欺负得惨了。

After pushing open the door, Yu Zhu Yi discovered his older sister was deeply engrossed in her work. Not wanting to disturb her, he quietly settled onto the couch, waiting patiently. 

At first, he occupied himself with his phone, trying to avoid interrupting her concentration. However, soon bored with the screen, he began to observe his sister's office. His gaze eventually landed on her: she wore a serious expression as she focused on the documents before her. Her slender fingers flipped through the black files, the stark contrast of her fair skin against the dark paper was strikingly beautiful. 

It was hard not to marvel at the fact that it seemed like God had a special fondness for his sister; even her fingers looked like they had been sculpted by divine hands, a true work of art. The admiration in Yu Zhu Yi’s eyes was palpable, his gaze wrapping around her like a silken thread, completely captivated. 

Indeed, there was something universally dazzling about someone who worked earnestly—this truth applied equally to both men and women. In that moment, Yu Zhu Yi felt his sister was akin to a radiant sun, shining brightly and drawing him in.

Yan Xin Fei, initially focused on her work, gradually became aware of the adorable eyes fixated on her. The warmth of his attention began to lure her thoughts away from her tasks. She couldn’t help but sigh internally, realizing just how irresistible her little brother was—he had a way of captivating her at every turn.

As her gaze softened, she bit her lip and hastened her pace in processing the papers. A few minutes later, she had finished the documents on her desk and swiftly made her way over to him. 

She stood behind him, wrapping her arms around his waist in a warm embrace. Leaning her chin on his delicate neck, her breath tickled his sensitive earlobe, sending a shiver down his spine. 

Seeing his originally pale earlobes flush with a hint of red from her actions, she couldn’t help but let out a soft, teasing laugh. 

Yu Zhu Yi had been lost in a daze, staring at his sister, when a shadow suddenly loomed over him. Before he could process what was happening, he felt her warm arms enveloping him, her hot breath brushing against his ear...

Overwhelmed, he attempted to escape her embrace but found himself trapped in her warmth. It took him a few seconds to realize that it was his sister pulling him into an affectionate hug. Why were her hands so warm today? Usually, they were a bit cold...

(Poor kid, he doesn’t understand yet. Yan Xin Fei was experiencing a rush of dopamine, a chemical that sparks feelings of excitement and happiness, making her heart race at the sight of someone she deeply cared for...)

“Hmm~ Trying to seduce me?” Yan Xin Fei’s voice was low and sultry, laced with an unmistakable hint of desire.

Yu Zhu Yi shivered at her words, his cheeks flushing as he softly protested, “No…”

“No? With that gaze you’re giving me, what else would you call it?” 

She playfully pecked at his cheek, then began to trail soft kisses down his neck and collarbone. 

As she left delicate, flower-like marks on his fair skin, she felt a sense of satisfaction wash over her. She was marking him with her own signs of affection.

Yu Zhu Yi felt a rush of warmth beneath his skin, his face burning as he blushed deeply, even his neck was starting to flush red. A single tear glimmered at the corner of his eye, like a tiny pearl.

Struggling against the rising tide of emotions, he clung tightly to his sister, his posture a mix of wanting to push her away and holding her close. His pitiful expression made her want to tease him even more.

After a long moment, Yan Xin Fei finally shifted her position. Yu Zhu Yi, like a fish gasping for air, parted his lips to breathe but was suddenly caught off guard by her kiss.

“Hmm~”

…………

The atmosphere in the office grew increasingly charged, filled with an intoxicating tension. Even the birds perched outside seemed to shy away, fluttering off into the distance.

Eventually, the sound of conversation returned to the office.

“Sorry, my dear. It’s my fault; I won’t do it again next time,” Yan Xin Fei said, her face radiating satisfaction.

Yu Zhu Yi didn’t respond, only staring at her with wide eyes, his breath coming in quick gasps. He thought he looked angry, but to her, he resembled a little kitten that had been pitifully bullied, further igniting her desire to tease him.

A glint of mischief sparkled in Yan Xin Fei’s eyes as she swallowed hard, wrestling with her own excitement. Suddenly, she scooped up the little cutie in her arms, using the gesture to calm the flutter of emotions within her.

Yu Zhu Yi, drained of energy to resist, melted into her embrace, feeling both safe and overwhelmed.
