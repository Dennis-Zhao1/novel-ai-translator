Peeling Crawfish

Yan Xinfei leisurely picked at her food, stealing glances at her little cutie to see which dish they preferred. It didn’t take long for her to figure out that the dish they seemed to enjoy the most was the sweet and sour ribs. She chuckled to herself, knowing that with how soft and delicate they looked, they would definitely have a sweet tooth.

On the other hand, Yu Zhuyi was eyeing the crawfish, but the thought of peeling them made him cringe. He stared at the little crustaceans, his face scrunching up as he debated whether to eat them or not. If he chose to eat them...

After a moment of contemplation, he ultimately decided against it.

Yan Xinfei noticed the way her little cutie stared at the crawfish for a long time without touching them. She thought to herself, this little one really is so delicate.

Deciding to take matters into her own hands, she put on a pair of gloves. 

When Yu Zhuyi saw her donning the gloves, he assumed she was going to eat the crawfish. He quickly offered, “Sister, let me help you peel them,” moving to assist her.

Yan Xinfei stopped him, saying, “No need, I can do it myself.” 

He reluctantly withdrew his hands and resumed eating.

Before long, Yan Xinfei had peeled a plateful of crawfish and placed them in front of him. “Here you go, dig in.”

He was completely taken aback that she had peeled them just for him. A small part of him wondered if she might actually have a bit of a liking for him.

And so the scene played out with him munching on the crawfish while she patiently peeled them for him without any complaints.

But then a thought crossed his mind: Did she often peel crawfish for Lu Qiuming too? The moment he entertained that idea, the crawfish in his hand suddenly lost their appeal.

Yan Xinfei noticed his change in mood and asked, “What’s wrong? Have you had enough? Is this all you’re going to eat?”

He shook his head and went back to the crawfish, but his movements had slowed down. He seemed to be hesitating to say something.

Yan Xinfei encouraged him, “If you have something to say, just say it.”

He stared at her face for several seconds, gathering his resolve, and then closed his eyes, exclaiming loudly, “Sister, did you used to treat that person the same way?”

In her eyes, he looked like a jealous little cutie.

However, she was puzzled. “That person? Who are you talking about?”

He opened his eyes wide and stared intently at her. “Lu Qiuming! Everyone in the circle knows you like him. Plus, you’re so skilled at peeling these; doesn’t that mean you’ve done it for him before?”

Yan Xinfei burst out laughing, “Are you jealous? But no, I didn’t like him before, I don’t like him now, and I won’t like him in the future.”

“Really? Sister, let’s make a pact.”

“Sure, I guess kids will always be kids.” Yan Xinfei sighed and took off her gloves, extending her finger to engage in this silly agreement.

“Sister, I’m already an adult! I’m in my fourth year now,” he protested with a pout.

She smiled and nodded, choosing not to argue further, as she didn’t want to provoke his embarrassment. Teasing the little cutie was amusing, but she knew such antics could backfire if taken too far.

Yan Xinfei stopped eating and quietly watched him as he enjoyed his meal.

He reminded her of the little hamster she once had, so cute and delicate, with food all over his face as he munched away.

As he continued eating, he suddenly felt a scorching gaze fixed on him.

Looking up, he found Yan Xinfei watching him with keen interest. His face flushed, and he could no longer endure it. He shouted in exasperation, “Sister!”

Noticing his face turning red, she ceased her gaze and began scrolling through her phone to look up what boys typically liked.

Once he realized her attention had shifted, he hastily picked up the pace of his eating.

But perhaps he wasn’t used to eating so fast, and before he knew it, he choked.

Yan Xinfei immediately sensed something was wrong. She stood up and rushed over to him.

Yu Zhuyi pointed weakly toward a glass of water situated at the edge of the table, which was out of his reach. 

She grabbed the cup, helped him take a sip, and gently patted his back. “Be careful, eat slowly.”

Yu Zhuyi felt embarrassed. He couldn’t believe he choked on his food during his first meal with her—how humiliating! But seeing the concern etched on her face as she patted his back, he began to relax.

After a moment, he mustered the courage to say, “Sister, I’m full.”

“Are you going back to school this afternoon? I can give you a ride.”

Although he didn’t want to part ways with her so soon, he indeed had other matters to attend to. He could only nod in agreement.
