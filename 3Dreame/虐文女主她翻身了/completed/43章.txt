**Chapter 43: Discovering a Surge of Energy**

The director seemed to sense that everyone was exhausted, so he decided not to throw any more tough challenges their way. That night, he didn't show up at all, leaving Zhou Cong and the others to let loose and enjoy themselves.

Before long, Xu Xiaoxiao and her friends were completely intoxicated, swaying and giggling as they danced. The scene quickly descended into chaos, resembling a wild party, and in a rather unexpected turn of events, Zhou Cong and his crew even contemplated becoming sworn brothers.

Yan Xinfeng watched with a mix of amusement and exasperation, her lips twitching in disbelief. It appeared that she was the only one sober that night. Despite having consumed her fair share of beer, she remained alert and composed.

Eventually, after their wild revelry had drained them, the group collapsed onto the sofa, their limbs sprawled out in disarray. Yan Xinfeng enlisted the help of the crew to escort the two larger men back to their rooms while she helped Xu Xiaoxiao navigate her way back.

As Yan Xinfeng supported Xu Xiaoxiao, the latter was anything but cooperative, wriggling and shifting about. If it weren’t for Yan Xinfeng's strength, Xu Xiaoxiao would have tumbled to the floor long ago, taking her helper down with her. 

At last, Yan Xinfeng managed to get Xu Xiaoxiao into her room and tucked her under the covers before making her way downstairs. After tidying up the mess in the living room, she finally returned to her own space.

Once she was back in her room, a staff member delivered her phone, which she had submitted in the morning for safekeeping. As she unlocked the device, her heart warmed at the flurry of messages from Little Cutie.

**[Little Cutie]**: Good morning, sister! ☆*:.｡. o(≧▽≦)o .｡.:*☆

**[Little Cutie]**: Sister, did you have breakfast yet?

**[Little Cutie]**: Sister, do you like me a tiny bit more today than yesterday? 

Oh? Even if you don’t, that’s okay! I like you a whole lot more than I did yesterday!

**[Little Cutie]**: Yay! ✿✿ヽ(°▽°)ノ✿

...

**[Little Cutie]**: Sister, I can’t believe you went to record a show without telling me!

**[Little Cutie]**: (｡•́︿•̀｡)

...

As she was about to reply, a video call from Little Cutie came through. She quickly accepted the call.

On the other end, Little Cutie had just finished showering, her hair still damp as she lounged in her pajamas on the bed. Yan Xinfeng swallowed hard, her voice slightly hoarse, “Hmm? What’s up?”

Little Cutie beamed at the screen, her eyes sparkling with mischief. “I just wanted to see you! I haven’t seen you all day! You went to participate in a show without telling me. I only found out because someone mentioned it during the live stream! ˚‧º·(˚ ˃̣̣̥᷄⌓˂̣̣̥᷅ )‧º·˚”

“Sorry, I had to turn in my phone during the recording. I just got it back. This time, it’s my fault for not letting you know I was going to participate in a variety show. I promise I’ll tell you next time, so please don’t be mad.”

Yu Zhuyi pouted, crossing her arms. “I wouldn’t get mad at my sister!”

“Okay, okay! If you’re not mad, then I’ll come and visit you when I get back, alright?” Yan Xinfeng coaxed in a playful tone.

Little Cutie’s face lit up with a smile. “You better remember to come see me!”

...

After hanging up with Little Cutie, an hour had already passed. 

**[Little Cutie]**: Sister, remember to come find me!

**[Little Cutie]**: Sister, make sure to sleep early. Goodnight!

**[Sister, my dear]**: Okay, goodnight!

After replying to Yu Zhuyi, Yan Xinfeng set her phone aside and began to meditate. Closing her eyes, she focused on absorbing the energy from the natural world around her to enhance her abilities. Suddenly, she sensed a concentrated source of energy nearby.

Curious, she paused her meditation and opened her eyes to locate the source of this powerful energy. To her surprise, she found that it was emanating from the string of prayer beads that the old lady had gifted her.

She had never expected that the beads would contain such a rich energy. Now that she had identified the source, she resumed her meditation, focusing intently on absorbing it.

About half an hour later, she exhaled a deep breath, releasing the stale energy from her body, and opened her eyes once again. The prayer beads had lost their luster, indicating that she had fully absorbed the energy contained within them. Feeling a twinge of regret, she lamented how quickly she had depleted their power.

However, she reminded herself that such opportunities were rare and precious, and encountering this energy was indeed a stroke of luck. 

Checking the time, she realized it was quite late. After tidying up her space quickly, she crawled into bed and drifted off to sleep, her mind still buzzing with the day’s events.
