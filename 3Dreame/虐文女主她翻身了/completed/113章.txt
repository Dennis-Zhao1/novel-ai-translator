**Settling Accounts After Autumn**

Chao Yixiu held him tightly, his grip almost as if he wanted to meld them into one being. They lingered in that embrace for what felt like an eternity. Gradually, Chao Yixiu's racing heart began to calm. It was time to settle accounts.

“You’ve gotten bold, haven’t you? Last night, how dare you sneak off to the bar without telling me?” His voice was laced with an ominous tone that sent chills down Zhao Min's spine. The pressure in the room seemed to drop several degrees.

Desperate to survive, Zhao Min stammered, “Haha… well… I… it’s not my fault, you know!” 

“Oh? Go on, explain,” Chao Yixiu prompted, his curiosity piqued.

Zhao Min seized the opportunity to shift the blame. “This is all your fault! You flirted with me and then left me hanging. I only went to the bar because of you!”

“And ordering the ‘princess’ at the bar was also because of me?” Chao Yixiu shot back, a mix of irritation and amusement in his voice.

Zhao Min felt the heat of embarrassment rise, and he instinctively recoiled. “Of course, it was because of you! I just wanted to see if I really liked you!”

Chao Yixiu fell silent, leaving Zhao Min with a sense of unease. He glanced over, puzzled by the lack of response.

With a deep sigh, Chao Yixiu reached out, ruffling Zhao Min's hair gently. “Look, it’s my fault. But it can’t happen again. If something’s going on, you need to tell me. Don’t hide from me or go to those places alone, got it?”

The events of last night weighed heavily on Chao Yixiu's mind; he never wanted to relive that fear again.

“Okay, I understand. I won’t do it again,” Zhao Min replied, guilt washing over him as he recognized the panic in Chao Yixiu’s eyes. 

Indeed, if Chao Yixiu hadn’t shown up last night… Just thinking about it sent a shiver down his spine.

Under the watchful eye of the wolf, Zhao Min the Rabbit lived a life of luxury. Meals were always ready, and clothes were provided without a thought. 

But he couldn’t shake the feeling that this big gray wolf seemed oddly familiar. There was something about the way he looked at him that felt so… right. 

Yet, Zhao Min had never encountered a big gray wolf before, leaving him utterly perplexed. After much contemplation, he decided it was best not to think too hard about it. 

Two months passed, and the once-dull rabbit now had a shiny, well-groomed coat. He felt incredibly happy.

However, he couldn’t shake the feeling that the wolf’s gaze was intense, almost heated. Did the wolf want to eat him? 

He found himself plotting how to escape the wolf’s clutches. But after several failed attempts, he surrendered. It wasn’t that he wasn’t trying; each time, the wolf could effortlessly track him down.

So, he resolved to simply wait and enjoy his life, fattening himself up in case he was to meet his end. After all, if he was going to die, he might as well be a well-fed rabbit.

Seeing his plump little rabbit thriving, the wolf felt a deep satisfaction. Yet, during the feeding process, it seemed the silly rabbit wanted to play hide-and-seek. 

Didn’t the rabbit realize he could just… 

Ah, whatever. If the rabbit wanted to play, then the wolf would indulge him.
