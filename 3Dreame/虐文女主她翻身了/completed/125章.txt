After quite some time, Yan Xinfeng realized that his sister's words about it being the last time that day had a different meaning than he initially thought. Though he felt a bit helpless, he didn't dwell on it too much. After all, he actually enjoyed having her around all the time.

At the same time, now that he knew they had received their legal punishment, Yan Xinfeng didn’t focus on them anymore. He figured he’d wait until that scoundrel got out after a few years and see if he could make a comeback then. And of course, if he did, she would suppress him once again, pushing him to the brink of collapse until he finally gave up.

As for Wen Qingzhi, Yan Xinfeng knew she needed a heart transplant, but there hadn’t been a match yet, and time was running out for her.

Every day, Yan Xinfeng spent time with his little sweetheart, and he suddenly realized that he had been here for half a year. It felt like he had also been with her for just as long. He knew she had been wanting to marry him; although she never voiced it, he could see it in her eyes.

So, he secretly started to plan a proposal.

For several days, Yu Zhuyi noticed that his sister, who usually spent all her time with him, seemed incredibly busy lately. He hardly saw her around. Even when she wasn’t by his side, she had someone watch over him.

He wanted to go find her and be with her, but he figured that after spending so much time together, she must have company matters to attend to. He didn’t want to delay her work because of his own desires; he needed to be understanding.

Thus, Yu Zhuyi spent these busy days without any complaints.

Finally, after a week had passed, Yan Xinfeng had nearly finalized his carefully crafted proposal. On this day, he brought along the ring he had designed himself to find his little sweetheart.

Arriving at the restaurant they usually frequented, Yan Xinfeng parked the car and was about to take a few steps inside. Perhaps it was the joy bubbling within him while he thought about how to propose and imagined his sweetheart's expression when he did so that made him a bit too relaxed, letting his guard down.

But by the time he sensed the danger, it was too late. A black car was barreling straight towards him, and the driver was none other than someone he recognized—Wen Qingzhi.

He wanted to use his powers to evade the oncoming car, but they wouldn’t activate. Panic set in as he realized that his abilities—including the ones that could have saved him—were suppressed by the world’s rules!

“Bang!” With a deafening sound, Yan Xinfeng could only do his utmost to dodge the most lethal parts of the collision. Yet, he was still struck, and the impact knocked him unconscious.

As he faded into darkness, he vaguely saw Wen Qingzhi’s satisfied smile as her scheme came to fruition. The last image that lingered in his mind was his little sweetheart rushing towards him in a panic, an expression he had never seen on her before.

He wanted to reach out and comfort her, to hold her in his arms, but alas, he had no strength left.

Meanwhile, Yu Zhuyi sat in the restaurant, filled with curiosity and anticipation, waiting for his sister. However, a sense of unease crept into his heart. When he heard the loud crash, that unease transformed into dread.

He rushed towards the source of the sound. From a distance, he saw his sister lying in a pool of blood, and at the wheel, with a triumphant smile, was Wen Qingzhi.

Though it was over thirty degrees outside, he felt a chilling cold enveloping him, as if he were trapped in an ice cave. He had never felt such despair before. When his mother passed away, he had only felt sadness.

Now, he was overwhelmed by the sensation of his heart shattering.

Just moments ago, his sister had been on the phone with him, her voice filled with joy, and now… 

He ran with all the speed he could muster, standing helplessly in front of his sister. Surrounding them were bystanders, their faces twisted in fear. Good-hearted people were calling for help and an ambulance.

He wanted to hug her, to reassure her, but he was terrified of touching her wounds.

It felt as if he had gone deaf. Despite the chaos and noise around him, he could hear nothing but the image of his sister, lying in a pool of blood.
