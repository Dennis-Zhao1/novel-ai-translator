**Chapter Fifty-One: Has He Finally Counterattacked?**

Yang Xinfey was completely unaware of the calculations running through the dogged male lead's mind as she slept soundly. In her dreams, Yu Zhuyi found herself laughing, envisioning a life where she cohabitated with her sister. Every day, her sister would prepare breakfast, lunch, and dinner for her, while she handled the lighter chores around the house. Just as she felt a moment of boldness in her dream, leaning in to kiss her sister, she was swiftly pushed back by her sister's strong counteraction.

Yang Xinfey was like a wolf patrolling its territory, exploring every corner of its domain. He let his hand glide down towards his sister, and just as they were on the brink of crossing that line, he jolted awake, realizing it had all been a dream.

He exhaled a hot breath, recalling every detail of his sister's movements in the dream. His blood surged like a raging river, and the desires buried beneath his skin threatened to break free. He quickly pushed those thoughts aside, fearing where they might lead.

After what felt like an eternity, the heat within him began to settle. He reached for his phone on the bedside table, only to find it was only three in the morning. A sense of thirst washed over him, but to quench it, he would have to venture downstairs to the kitchen.

Determined not to disturb his sister's rest, he crept down the stairs and poured himself a glass of lukewarm water. As he climbed back up towards the second floor, he suddenly heard Yang Xinfey’s voice, causing him to nearly lose his footing on the staircase. Regaining his composure, he turned to see his sister standing a short distance away.

With a hint of apology, he said, “Sister, I’m sorry. Did I wake you?”

It was clear that she had just roused from sleep, her voice a little hoarse as she replied, “No, I just got up to use the bathroom.”

He found that a bit puzzling since every room had its own bathroom. However, he knew better than to ask her about it at this hour.

“Then you should get back to rest,” he suggested, wanting to retreat to his room. But Yang Xinfey stood right in the middle of the hallway, blocking his path. To get past her, he would need to squeeze by.

The corridor was neither too wide nor too narrow—enough for two people to stand side by side. Yet, with her positioned as she was, he had no choice but to brush past her, resulting in an unavoidable moment of contact.

As he accidentally touched her cold hand, a reflexive shiver ran through him. Once he regained his senses, he reached out to hold her slightly cold hand in his own.

“Sister, you should go back to your room. Look, your hands are freezing,” he said with genuine concern.

“Okay,” she replied softly.

Despite both of them agreeing to part ways, neither made a move to leave. Yu Zhuyi’s attention had shifted solely to warming her hands, and soon, the warmth from his palms began to seep into hers. Noticing that her hands felt warmer than before, his thoughts drifted away from the chill.

Suddenly, he was jolted back to the earlier dream, a wave of thirst washing over him again. Abruptly, he released her hand and hurriedly said, “I’m tired. I’m going to sleep now. Sister, you should rest early too.”

With a loud "bang," he closed the door behind him, leaving Yang Xinfey standing there, puzzled.

In truth, Yang Xinfey hadn’t woken up because she needed the bathroom. The sounds coming from the adjacent room had startled her awake. Having lived through the apocalypse, even for just two years, she had developed many habits, including a heightened sense of vigilance. After all, in a world overrun with danger, one could easily be caught off guard and lose their life without ever knowing it.

As she stood there motionless, lost in thought, she remained in the hallway for nearly fifteen minutes before finally returning to her room and closing the door to sleep.

Meanwhile, Yu Zhuyi didn’t climb into bed right away. He leaned against the door, trying to calm the heat surging within him, only relaxing once he heard the soft click of her door closing. Then, he returned to his bed, exhaustion finally overtaking him, and he fell into a deep sleep.
