Adding Her on WeChat

As the auction was about to begin, the chatter around the room gradually faded away. A woman in a stunning red qipao gracefully stepped onto the auction stage and alluringly announced, "Ladies and gentlemen, the auction is about to start. We will be auctioning items donated for charity. The proceeds from these items will also be donated to impoverished areas. Now, let’s officially begin the auction."

Yan Xinfei lounged casually in her seat, playing with a string of purple beads that she often wore. Meanwhile, everyone around her was intensely competing for the auction items.

Beside her, Yu Zhuyi sat up straight, appearing to be the epitome of good behavior. If one were to overlook the vibrant red of his earlobes, he would indeed seem extraordinarily obedient. In reality, Yu Zhuyi was stealing glances at Yan Xinfei’s hand as she toyed with the purple beads. He silently thought to himself how beautiful her hands were, wishing that they could be intertwined with his.

Yes, Yu Zhuyi's heart was fluttering. The one who made his heart race was sitting right next to him. Just seeing Yan Xinfei made the blood in his veins seem to boil.

He didn’t quite understand why he had fallen for Yan Xinfei at first sight, but when it came to matters of the heart, feelings were beyond comprehension.

The auction progressed steadily, and finally, when they reached the third-to-last item, Yan Xinfei raised her bidding paddle. "Five million," she declared. A hush fell over the auction room; it was hard to believe that this seemingly worthless glass-like orb had attracted a bid of five million from Yan Xinfei.

People stared at her as if she were crazy.

Even though this was a charitable event, many thought it unnecessary to spend such a hefty sum on what they considered junk. Then they remembered Yan Xinfei’s previous affection for that Lu family boy, and how she donated each year in his name. They speculated that she must be bidding five million for the sake of Lu Qiuming. They couldn’t help but lament why none of their own boys had caught her eye.

The auctioneer, still wearing her qipao, hesitated for a moment but quickly regained her poise, maintaining her professional smile as she continued, "Going once, five million! Going twice, five million! Third and final call, sold!" With that, she moved on to the next item.

After Yan Xinfei’s bid, her enthusiasm waned, and she didn’t raise her paddle again for the rest of the auction. After wrapping up her bidding, Yu Zhuyi casually participated in one more auction, and soon the event came to a close.

The auction’s organizer approached Yan Xinfei to deliver the items she had won and asked whether the charity would be under her name or Lu Qiuming's. 

"From now on, it will be under my name. If Lu Qiuming asks about this, just tell him I'm neither his father nor his mother. I have no obligation to cover his charity expenses," Yan Xinfei replied coolly.

Yu Zhuyi sat quietly beside her, listening to those words and feeling a surge of happiness in his heart, as it signified that Yan Xinfei hadn’t been focusing on that Lu family boy.

As Yan Xinfei was about to leave, Yu Zhuyi hurriedly followed her, his voice soft as he asked, "Sister, can I add you on WeChat? Or you can add me instead." He extended his left hand, presenting his WeChat QR code to her.

Yan Xinfei smiled and took out her phone to scan his code. Yu Zhuyi watched in delight as she added him, and only then did he let her go, standing there with a silly grin on his face, gazing at his phone.
