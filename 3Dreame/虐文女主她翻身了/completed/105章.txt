Zhao Min steadied her mind, feigning calmness as she spoke.  
“Come, come, pour me a drink.”  

While they were pouring the drinks, Zhao Min took the opportunity to ask, “How do you usually serve your guests?”  
Xiao Yao smiled lightly, “In response to Zhao Shao, we mostly drink with the guests and play a few games.”  

That smile from Xiao Yao still left Zhao Min a bit stunned. It wasn’t that Zhao Min was smitten; rather, it was a natural human reaction to appreciate beauty.  
Zhao Min somewhat dazedly replied, “Oh... oh, I see.”  

Xiao Yao covered her mouth and chuckled softly, “This must be your first time requesting this kind of service, right?”  
Hearing her laughter, Zhao Min quickly snapped back to reality.  
With a slightly distracted gaze, he replied, “How could it be? I’m definitely not a newbie at this sort of thing.”  

Zhao Min was stubbornly denying it, refusing to admit it was his first time.  
He felt that if they found out, they would laugh at him.  
“Is that so?” Xiao Yao saw through him but kept it to herself.  
Zhao Min thought she believed him and confidently said, “Of course!”  

Xiao Yao smiled quietly, not saying a word.  
Xiao Yu, noticing the banter between Xiao Yao and Zhao Min, tried several times to jump into the conversation but didn’t know how to start.  
Seeing Xiao Tian quietly pouring drinks without competing for attention, she felt a twinge of resentment.  
Yet, thinking it over, she realized she now had one less competitor and felt a bit happier.  

Xiao Tian was working here out of necessity.  
In this chaotic place, where temptations lurked at every corner, she had steadfastly held onto her principles.  
All she wanted was a stable job to support herself and her younger brother; she had no desire to climb the social ladder by attaching herself to some wealthy man.  
She had seen the reality: even if they managed to hook up with a rich guy, what would it matter in the end? They would eventually be discarded.  

If they were lucky, those wealthy men might give them some money to leave.  
But if they encountered ruthless ones, those powerful men could strip them of everything, leaving them with nothing.  
Even worse, some despicable people would ruin their reputations, making it impossible for them to hold onto any job, let alone one like this.  

Actually, there were very few who, like Xiao Tian, maintained their principles in this line of work.  
Most were willing to do anything to get close to the rich.  
After all, this place was filled with the lure of money.  

Xiao Yu took the initiative to bring drinks over to him.  
Zhao Min felt a bit uncomfortable and stepped back a bit, only to realize that he was indeed there looking for them...  
It seemed quite normal to let them feed him drinks.  
With that thought, he stepped forward and allowed her to pour him a drink.  

Noticing the other two weren’t making any moves, he boldly beckoned them to come over and massage him.  
From a distance, it looked like Zhao Min was lounging leisurely, surrounded by three beautiful women.  
What a delightful scene! Zhao Min thought to himself, feeling quite pleased.  

——————————Little Theater————————  
Zhao Min: Fine wine and beautiful women, ah, this is the life.  
Chao Yixiu asked ominously, “Oh? Is that so?”  
Zhao Min nearly fell off the sofa in fright: “I... just scared myself to death.”

Sigh, there might be some typos in my novel, but don’t mind them too much, okay? As long as you can understand... (◔◡◔)  
Sometimes it’s just that I haven’t used my brain in a while, and suddenly... I can’t remember!ヾ(≧O≦)〃 Ah~
