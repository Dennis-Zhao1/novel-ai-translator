### Chapter 28: Seeking Cooperation

**[Let’s Take a Look at the Dog Male Lead]**

That day, after Lu Qiuming encountered Yan Xinfang at the Cloud Pavilion, he had been wearing a frown, feeling restless and uneasy. It seemed to him that he had lost something intangible.

He couldn’t understand how Yan Xinfang, who had once adored him so fervently, had turned so indifferent. Back then, she had followed him like a devoted puppy, eager to please, while he had barely acknowledged her feelings. Now, she claimed she no longer liked him, as if her affection had been nothing more than a fleeting illusion.

The sight of her dining with another man had filled him with anger and sorrow; he perceived Yan Xinfang as a promiscuous woman, eagerly moving on to her next conquest. 

If Yan Xinfang knew what the dog male lead was thinking, she would surely scoff at him. It was he who had never valued her; when she had cared for him, he had been dismissive, always emphasizing that he had someone else occupying his heart. Yet, he had still accepted her kindness from the shadows.

Lu Qiuming thought grimly: if she is like this... then she can't blame him for what happens next.

He dialed a series of numbers and connected the call. 

On the other end, an impatient voice answered, “Hello?”

Lu Qiuming spoke sweetly, “It's me, Brother Hui. I have a partnership I’d like to discuss with you. Do you have time?”

The response was laced with condescension. “Oh, Lu Qiuming. What kind of partnership are we talking about?”

His expression shifted slightly at the tone, and he felt his temper flare. But then, an idea struck him, and he suppressed his anger. “It’s about the Yan family.”

Upon hearing this, the tone on the other end turned respectful, though still tinged with skepticism. “How can you be so sure? What if something goes wrong and you draw the wrong kind of attention...”

“Don’t worry. Haven’t you heard? The head of the Yan family knows my standing. Just ask around and you’ll see. Besides, if anything were to happen to me, I would absolutely clear you of any involvement. I wouldn’t drag you down with me.”

After some contemplation, the person on the other end finally relented, swayed by the promise of substantial gains. 

A moment later, he replied coolly, “Tomorrow night, eight o’clock. You know where to find me.” With that, he hung up.

Lu Qiuming’s face darkened, and he muttered angrily under his breath, “If it weren’t for needing something from you, would I be groveling like this? You really don’t know your place.” The more he thought about it, the angrier he became, sweeping everything off his desk with a crash.

“Yan Xinfang, it’s all your fault! If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t be in this position.”

The CEO’s office echoed with his exasperated voice. If Yan Xinfang knew what Lu Qiuming was thinking and doing at that moment, she would undoubtedly mock, “What a mess this dog male lead is in.”

Soon, it was the day for Wen Qingzhi to participate in the variety show. 

Except for Wen Qingzhi, who arrived fashionably late, all the other artists had already gathered at the designated location for the recording. 

Wen Qingzhi was ten minutes late, and under the scorching sun, the other artists wore forced smiles while waiting, their impatience palpable beneath the surface.

Finally, Wen Qingzhi appeared. With tears brimming in her eyes, she apologized profusely to the others, explaining that she had been ill and had just been discharged from the hospital, which was why she was late.

Her frail appearance stirred sympathy in the hearts of the male artists, dissipating their previous annoyance. After all, who could hold a grudge against someone who was not only beautiful but also sick?

The remaining female artist, though somewhat displeased, forced a smile and assured everyone that it was no problem.
