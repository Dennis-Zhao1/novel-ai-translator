She slowly caressed the surface, her voice calm yet laced with tension. “I know exactly who you are, Zhaoshao. You think I can just walk away and everything will be fine?”

Zhao Min was about to nod in agreement, but before he could, she continued, “Do you really believe I’m that easy to deceive? I’m not so foolish. I know if I leave right now, with your wealth and power, you would make sure I regret it.”

“I wouldn’t do that! How could you think I’m that kind of person?” Zhao Min stammered, feeling a surge of guilt wash over him. Deep down, though, he realized he had entertained that very thought. 

But she had seen right through him, and his mind spun in confusion, clouded by the heat rising within him. Waves of warmth surged through his body, leaving him increasingly desperate. He had opted for this kind of service, but he never anticipated things would spiral out of control like this. 

Could it really end today? No, he thought, I can’t just sit here and wait for the worst to happen. If it comes to that, I’ll make sure it’s a mutual destruction. 

Just as he was steeling himself for a drastic move, the door burst open with a loud bang. 

Chao Yixiu stormed into the room, and his eyes widened at the sight before him: Zhao Min lay there with half-closed eyes, looking as though he was lost in pleasure, while a woman leaned over him, her intentions clear.

The scene spoke volumes, and Chao Yixiu felt the rage boiling within him. He had thought he was giving Zhao Min enough time to come to terms with his feelings, but he never imagined he would find him in a place like this, with someone like her.

He felt like a dragon robbed of its treasure, fury igniting in his eyes as he approached, shoving the woman aside with a fierce shove. “Get away from him! Who gave you the right to touch him?” he barked, his voice dripping with anger.

Lin, who had followed closely behind, quickly closed the door to the private room, his head pounding at the sight unfolding before him. When he had learned that Zhao Min had called for three “princesses,” he had anticipated trouble. Now, he had rushed to inform Chao Yixiu, aware of the bond they shared.

Lin had seen the unusual connection between the two and knew that Chao Yixiu had once helped Zhao Min through tough times. Even with his swift movements, all it took was a moment to notify Chao Yixiu, and the situation had escalated beyond his control.

Meanwhile, the woman, Xiao Yu, trembled in panic, her mind racing with thoughts. Her pale face betrayed her fear, but she still sought to defend herself. “I... I was called here by Zhaoshao...” 

Her voice wavered, guilt gnawing at her, yet she believed she hadn’t lied entirely—after all, they were summoned by him.

“Shut up!” Chao Yixiu snapped, glaring at her before turning his attention to Zhao Min, who seemed to have finally noticed the commotion. 

“Yixiu! It was her! She came on her own! She even started undressing me... and touching me...” Zhao Min complained, sounding like a child who had just run to their mother after a playground scuffle.

Once he finished his outburst, a wave of relief washed over him, and he promptly succumbed to the darkness, fainting from the overwhelming chaos around him.

Chao Yixiu, seething with anger, felt his body tremble. His face turned pale as he struggled to contain his rage, fearing that he would unleash it on Zhao Min instead. He turned away, kicking the woman in frustration. The heaviness in his heart felt like a mountain, the more he thought about it, the angrier he became. If it hadn’t been for Lin’s timely intervention...

He couldn’t bear to imagine what could have happened next. His precious treasure was on the verge of being sullied, and right now, he was like a furious lion, unable to control himself.
