**Epilogue**

“Xuanjing, Lolo sees you as family and a friend. Now that you're leaving her, it's like she's losing another loved one. If you trust me to take care of Lolo, I promise you...” 

Before he could finish speaking, Luo Bingtian quickly covered his mouth with her hand, awkwardly glancing at Xuanjing. 

“Don’t listen to his nonsense! This guy is crazy, hahahaha, totally lost it!” 

“Luo Bingtian, this world is going to get better. Don’t lose hope,” Xuanjing said gently, looking at the two of them standing side by side. He smiled softly, tilting his head to gaze at the horizon. 

“I must go now. May we meet again if fate allows.” 

When Anmin rushed over with his report, he found an ethereal figure gradually fading before his eyes, leaving him utterly confused about what had just happened. 

“Miss Luo, are you and Captain Xie watching a holographic projection?” 

Luo Bingtian and Xie Jinghang exchanged a knowing glance but said nothing in response. 

“What’s going on? Why the hurry?” 

“Oh, oh, the team said we need to sweep this building thoroughly. If that's the case, does that mean we’ll be staying here overnight?” 

Luo Bingtian closed her eyes, extending her mental energy to cover the entire building. Xuanjing’s departure didn’t affect her mental strength or space at all; in fact, she felt her abilities amplifying slightly. 

She could now distinguish the crystal cores of both humans and zombies with greater clarity, spotting many zombies lurking downstairs. 

“Tell Meng that all these zombies need to be cleared out. After that, we can head back.” 

“Got it! I’ll get to it right away and won’t interrupt your movie night any longer!” 

Anmin said, quickly disappearing, afraid that he might disrupt some important romantic moment. 

Luo Bingtian shrugged, her sadness dissipating a bit. Perhaps this world really would get better. 

“Let’s go clear out the zombies together so we can head home sooner.” 

“Home…” 

Xie Jinghang silently savored the word, watching as Luo Bingtian walked ahead. A smile crept onto his lips as he hurried to catch up. 

Meanwhile, in a corner he overlooked, the noisy one was sobbing to the point of nearly passing out, completely blindsided by Xuanjing’s abrupt departure. 

Back at the fortress, Luo Bingtian and her team returned safely. Pei Qian and the others from the Longxiang Base, including her uncles, had fortified the fortress well. After Luo Bingtian left, the team captain led a small squad that was discovered by patrollers, found unconscious in the woods behind the mountain. One of them had sustained serious injuries from some vine-like tendrils and sadly didn’t survive, while the captain and another team member were fortunate enough to escape with their lives. 

Reunited with her family, the time for reckoning with Bu Qi had arrived. The bizarre matters concerning the system couldn’t be disclosed, but Bu Qi’s other crimes were enough to condemn him to death. 

Uncle Zhu was the first to demand justice, especially considering Luo Bingtian’s deep-seated vendetta against him from both of her lifetimes. 

As Bu Qi dangled in the open space before the fortress, even the underage children joined in the trial and crowd. Uncle Zhu read out the charges against Bu Qi, and Uncle Zhu could hardly restrain himself from striking. 

His eyes burned with rage as memories of his son’s tragic death and the implications for his father flooded back. The Zhu family stood behind him, silently supporting his resolve. As soon as the charges were read, a boy of about ten hurled a stone at the hanging Bu Qi, hitting him squarely and eliciting a grunt of pain. Seeing this, the crowd erupted in outrage and began throwing stones and bricks, ensuring he suffered before his demise. 

Luo Bingtian conjured ice spikes, but realizing how harsh she had been, decided to hold off till the end. 

Watching the crowd beat Bu Qi, her inner resentment began to fade with each stone that struck him. 

“Let me handle this,” Uncle Zhu declared, deciding that simply throwing stones was too lenient. He unleashed his abilities directly on Bu Qi, and soon, Bu Qi was rendered helpless, his breath growing weaker until Luo Bingtian finally delivered the finishing blow. 

“Bu Qi is dead.” 

With Uncle Zhu's announcement, cheers erupted, mingled with Uncle Zhu's anguished cries. 

He had finally avenged his son. 

“From today on, we will arrange for ordinary people to awaken their abilities. All ability users will go out in batches to clear the zombies and gather all usable resources. We cannot rely solely on what we have to survive; we must create and sustain civilization. We will establish factories to produce everything we need for daily life and welcome more people who want to live well. This world will get better!” 

Once Luo Bingtian finished her speech, everyone embraced, no longer filled with fear or uncertainty about the future. 

From that day on, a broadcast from the fortress community played continuously: “The Apocalypse Fortress New Community invites people from all over the world to help build a new home. Whether you are an ability user or an ordinary person, the Apocalypse Fortress looks forward to your joining us.” 

“Lolo, the fortress is getting busier and busier. It’s so lively!” 

Zhu Yidan and Luo Bingtian stood at the office's floor-to-ceiling window, gazing down at the vibrant scene below, where everyone brimmed with energy. 

“Yeah, it is lively, but we’re running out of space. We need to arrange the steel mill at the old site soon and send some people over.” 

“The textile factory and farm just relocated a batch of people, and now we have to move another group out?” 

“Exactly! New people come to register every day. Your uncle is going to be swamped; can't you, as his prized niece, lend him a hand?” 

“Not a chance! I’m not cut out for that. Let Xiaohui handle it. I’m more suited for lounging around and living off my meals. Besides, if anyone should go, it should be you. Don’t forget, you’re the highest-ranking leader of the fortress!” 

The two shared a laugh, playfully teasing each other, feeling as if they had returned to the time before the apocalypse. 

“Oh, by the way, Captain Xie hasn’t called even once in all the days he’s been away?” 

“No, why?” 

“Ugh! I’m not saying this to pry, but if you don’t give Captain Xie a clear commitment, aren’t you afraid he’ll run away?” 

“….” 

“Don’t give me that innocent look! Did you not see how the female workers at the textile factory acted when they first saw Captain Xie? They stared at him like he was a rare gem!” 

“You’re disgusting.” 

“Stop diverting the topic! Listen, Jimei, Captain Xie has treated you well these past few years, staying by your side without wavering and keeping his nose clean. If you don’t want him, there are plenty of others who would!” 

“Plus, I think he’s pretty good-looking and matches your standards as a beauty lover.” 

“Enough already! I’ve heard this too many times; my ears are about to develop calluses.” 

“Then why are you still stringing him along? You’re a heartbreaker!” 

“And what about you? With so many ability users around you, have you decided who you’d want to be with?” 

Zhu Yidan immediately panicked at the question. 

“Don’t drag me into this! We’re talking about you, and my options are nothing compared to Captain Xie. They’re not even in the same league!” 

“Alright, if you decide to get into a relationship, I’ll consider it too. I can’t let my sister be a single dog forever, can I?” 

“Luo Bingtian, you just want to drag me down with you!” 

“I’m not! Really, I’m not! Don’t tickle me!” 

“Do you think Captain Xie will confess to you when he gets back?” 

“Who knows?” 

“What if he proposes directly? Would you say yes?” 

“That depends on my mood.”
