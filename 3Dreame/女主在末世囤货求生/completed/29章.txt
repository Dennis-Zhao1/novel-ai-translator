**One Knife Poor, One Knife Rich**

When the greasy man rushed back, he was greeted by a scene that left him gaping. The very piece of rough jade he had mocked for half a day was actually showing a vibrant green—an unmistakable imperial green! The quality was top-notch, straight from an old mine, and even without polishing, its beauty was evident. Once polished, it would be a sight to behold.

“Oh my god, this bet has paid off!” The greasy man instinctively reached out to grab it, but was stopped by Leo Sterling, who stood firmly behind him. Such a rude person could be tolerated when it came to words, but if he laid a hand on the jade, he would find himself on the receiving end of a good beating.

The old master was just as astonished. After years in the jade gambling business, he had witnessed many miracles, but this was the first time he had seen green emerge only after three cuts. Finding imperial green in a piece of rough jade that had been written off as worthless was unheard of. Today had truly broadened his horizons.

Serena Zhou, watching the jade reveal its treasure, felt a rush of joy. What thrilled her even more was that her divination technique had proven accurate. This piece wasn’t large enough to make a bracelet; at best, it could yield some pendants or cabochons. But given how little she had spent on it, even a single piece would cover her costs and then some.

In that moment, the phrase “One knife poor, one knife rich, one knife for a villa” perfectly captured her reality.

Gambling with jade was all about taking risks, and the adrenaline rush was akin to riding a roller coaster.

Serena didn’t want to draw too much attention to herself, especially as the crowd around her grew larger. The news that she had spent a mere hundred thousand only to gamble on a piece worth over a hundred million was indeed explosive.

She signaled for the staff and her bodyguard, Leo, to take her to the VIP room to rest while waiting for the afternoon auction.

The old master followed joyfully, curious about how the young lady had chosen that piece of stone. It was clear to him that she had confidence it would yield green, and he wanted to learn her secret.

Once they reached the VIP room and shut the door, the outside noise faded, bringing a much-needed tranquility. The staff carefully packed the jade into a box provided by the organizers, handing it to Serena. The stone was now only the size of a palm, with the imperial green covering less than half of it—barely larger than an egg.

However, the quality of the imperial green was undeniable. The old master shone a bright light on it to simulate the finished product’s color, and it was mesmerizing.

Serena reveled in her luck, knowing this was the first piece she had stumbled upon by chance, and she intended to keep it safe.

The old master then asked her how she had known, but Serena could only shrug and tell the translator, “It’s a woman’s intuition.”

Leo, her bodyguard, wanted to chime in that she had simply been rummaging through a pile of stones, as he had been the one moving them.

But the old master didn’t mind; he had discreetly collected the cut-off parts while no one was paying attention. Normally, no one bothered with scraps like those, as only the green parts held value. He mused that understanding the characteristics of such stones could help avoid missing out on more valuable materials in the future.

Serena remained in the VIP room, not venturing out until after lunch when the organizers announced that the auction was about to begin. Typically, auctions started with the four major venues’ rough stones before moving to a unified inspection.

She sat down in her assigned seat, surrounded by industry peers and heads of other venues—outsiders were rare here.

Upon donning the simultaneous interpretation headset provided by the organizers, the auctioneer took the stage, delivering an enthusiastic opening speech before diving into the items for bidding.

As various rough stones of different sizes and qualities were presented, Serena used her divination technique to gauge their potential. True to form, the four major venues had selected excellent quality stones.

Yet, Serena still preferred the thrill of her earlier find—not just for its monetary value but for the satisfaction of having discovered it herself.

As boredom set in, she watched the auctioneer raise bids one after another, and finally, it was time for her venue’s jade to be showcased.

Everyone present, except for her and the organizers, would prefer the prices to not keep climbing. The stones were performing exceptionally well, and it was guaranteed they would fetch high prices.

The thought of selling them for a fortune, which would allow her to stock up on more goods, ignited Serena’s excitement.

The auctioneer worked tirelessly, and the four pieces from her venue were sold at high prices. Serena felt that the auction was drawing to a close.

With at least half of the proceeds available for reinvestment, she could finally leave Myanmar with peace of mind.

Arrangements were made for her to be taken to the airport for a direct flight to Saudi Arabia.

To her surprise, Chris was waiting to greet her upon landing, raising her eyebrows in curiosity.

She certainly didn’t think Chris was there out of boredom or because she was of great importance.

Uncertain of Chris's intentions, she decided to wait for him to speak first.

Serena generally found little interest in deciphering others’ motivations unless they directly affected her.

Chris drove, with Leo in the passenger seat and Serena lounging in the back.

The atmosphere in the car was quiet until Chris finally broke the silence.

“Serena, is your country about to start a war?”

Serena chuckled at that. “No, why would you think that?”

“Then why are you bringing back so many weapons? China is one of the safest countries in the world, and you can’t even use them legally there.”

Serena hadn’t expected to see Chris so curious, so she joked, “Of course, it’s because the apocalypse is coming! I need to protect myself!”

Chris looked at her, clearly not taking her seriously, assuming she had some other plans she couldn’t disclose.

He knew directly probing clients for confidential information went against their brokerage rules, but seeing Serena’s nonchalant demeanor, he let it slide as a joke.

Serena was in Myanmar not only to pick up goods but also to liquidate jewelry. After learning that gold could be converted to U.S. dollars, the batch of high-end jewelry in her possession became urgent goods to process.

After a night of flying, she was indeed tired. They agreed that Chris would come by at three in the afternoon to inspect the goods. With Leo, she checked into the sailboat hotel to catch up on sleep.

During this time, Serena received a WeChat message from Yu Dan, containing a video of her jade inspection from the previous day in Myanmar.

The caption was snarky, directly mocking her as the CEO of Mingzhu Group for not understanding jade gambling and wasting money on worthless stones.

Clearly, the greasy man had secretly recorded her, editing out parts to ridicule her. Serena initially didn’t want to respond; gambling losses and gains were her personal business.

However, this incident caused fluctuations in Mingzhu Group’s stock prices. The newly appointed shareholders, fearing a loss of profit, bombarded Serena with inquiries. While they maintained a polite tone, the sheer number of them was quite annoying.

Serena pulled out the box gifted by the organizers, opening it to reveal the freshly cut imperial green stone from yesterday. She snapped a few photos, showcasing its beauty, and posted them on her social media.

“Is a billion worth of imperial green considered garbage? Then I’ll take five tons more!”

She posted a grid of images from various angles, and after hitting send, comments began to flood in. Some eager folks shared it on other platforms, and soon, the domestic onlookers were astonished.

With a mention of its billion-dollar value alongside those stunning green images, no one would question its legitimacy.

Being an heir to a jewelry family, a billion-dollar piece was hardly surprising.

Before long, various rumors surfaced on social media, all about Serena’s miraculous jade gambling operation.

Those in the know marveled at her luck, while others were impressed by her skills. The discussion was heating up, with the topic on the verge of exploding.
