**Catching Mice**

Luo Bingting's mental powers were keeping a close watch on the few little mice that had sneaked in, and it was quite amusing to see how they were trying to avoid the patrols. They knew very well there were abilities users guarding this area, yet they still dared to take the risk. What could possibly motivate them to come here?

With a spectator's attitude, she waited for these intruders to make their move. When the two parties finally came face to face, they were both taken aback.

It turned out that Liu Xiaohui, who had been taken hostage, had a sharp dagger pressed against her neck, glinting silver in the dim light. Meng Ge stood behind Luo Bingting, and at the sight of this scene, he was about to spring into action. But quicker than Meng Ge was Luo Bingting, who shot an ice spike, knocking the hand that held Liu Xiaohui away. Liu Xiaohui was quick on her feet; sensing the sudden change, she ducked and sprinted towards Luo Bingting.

Caught off guard by the swift turn of events, the intruders turned to flee. However, they were met with Meng Ge's firepower, and the shots hit their calves, causing them to scream in pain and collapse to the ground, unable to move.

Meng Ge, who had been waiting for his girlfriend to leap into his arms, now watched in shock as she dove right into the embrace of another woman, leaving him feeling utterly blindsided. The emotional blow was truly unexpected.

Luo Bingting patted the still-shaken Liu Xiaohui and then pushed her into Meng Ge's arms, giving him a look that said, "Your girlfriend needs comforting." She then retrieved an old dagger from her space and approached the fallen intruders.

The night was dark, and the lighting was dim. It wasn't until she got closer that she could see their faces—strangers to her. Without hesitation, Luo Bingting plunged the dagger into one of them, creating several bloody wounds. The others were frozen in shock, completely at a loss for how to beg for mercy from someone who clearly played by her own rules.

After finishing off one, she didn’t bother to check if he was dead or alive. Instead, she flashed a sweet smile and asked, “Which one of you is the leader?”

The four men trembled at the sound of her gentle voice and quickly pointed at the one who had been stabbed. “Him! He’s our boss!”

“Boss? Where did you guys operate before this?” 

By now, Liu Xiaohui had gathered her wits and rushed over to explain. She clarified that these four had been hanging around the suburban area, not exactly a notorious gang but more like idle delinquents who sometimes did odd jobs when needed. They had come to the fortress to help with housing construction, and a couple of them had stayed on in maintenance while the others joined the agricultural team for farming.

It turned out Liu Xiaohui had gotten careless. She had intended to bring Meng Ge a late-night snack while he was on patrol, only to be ambushed by these fools who demanded to know where the awakening serum was. Liu Xiaohui had no idea about this and quickly expressed her ignorance. They had threatened to use her to coerce Meng Ge into injecting them with the serum, hoping to become abilities users themselves.

Listening to their lamentations, along with Liu Xiaohui's occasional clarifications, Luo Bingting soon pieced together what kind of people they were and what they had done. It seemed like mere coincidence that they had stumbled upon her. It was highly unlikely they were sent by Fu Buqi; if they were, they were sorely lacking in intelligence to send such inept fools to deal with her.

Did they really think that since Xie Jinghang had fallen out with her, they could just do as they pleased? How laughable.

Since the so-called leader was already dead, there was no point in questioning the others for any critical information. Meng Ge took the remaining intruders and hung them up in the square, leaving the corpse untouched.

He left one of the abilities users at the square, intending to make an example of these audacious fools. They wouldn't be killed just yet; Meng Ge would bring Liu Xiaohui back first. Luo Bingting waved her hand, indicating she would continue her watch. The rest were manageable, but dealing with Fu Kuan was indeed troublesome, and she couldn't entrust that to someone else.

As dawn broke, Dr. Zhang came to relieve Xiao Lu. He paused when he saw Luo Bingting, then smiled and reminded her to rest. After a brief chat, Dr. Zhang began recording everyone's data. Comparing it to Xiao Lu's previous records, he started noticing something odd.

After pointing out the issue, Luo Bingting used her mental powers to check on the crystalline cores. They seemed to be crystallizing at twice the speed. “What’s going on?” she wondered aloud, exchanging puzzled looks with Dr. Zhang.

Suddenly, Dr. Zhang slapped his forehead. “I just remembered! The ratio of the X serum was doubled this time, and the sample extracted was from a level three core, while Xiao Lu used a level two core. The increased speed might be related to that!”

Luo Bingting nodded in understanding. The X serum was sourced from the lake in her space, and it appeared these individuals would complete their crystallization and awakening process by tomorrow. Strangely, she felt a sense of anticipation.

As the morning light fully illuminated the fortress, the residents began to stir and go about their work. They noticed the four men hanging in the square, pointing and whispering. One of them was already dead, while the other three, having screamed through the night, now looked utterly defeated.

Luo Bingting, accompanied by her uncle and others, approached the hanging men and addressed the fortress residents: “These individuals attempted to sabotage the awakening project. They not only kidnapped Liu Xiaohui but also sought to threaten Captain Meng. They clearly do not respect the fortress's rules or the safety of everyone here.”

Upon hearing that these scoundrels dared to disrupt the awakening project, the ordinary citizens erupted in anger. Someone picked up a rock and hurled it at the three men hanging there. Soon, others joined in, throwing stones and shouting curses, needing to vent their frustrations and letting any lurking threats know that they should think twice before engaging in mischief.

Ignoring the chaos behind her, Luo Bingting turned and headed back to her dormitory. After a long night of vigilance, she washed up and rested in her space, knowing she needed to be well-rested for what lay ahead.

Now, it wasn’t just the abilities users standing guard outside the awakening ward; some awakened individuals' families were also voluntarily keeping watch below. When Luo Bingting returned in the afternoon, someone reported that the ordinary people who had been bitten by zombies were gradually waking up.

This indicated a 100% success rate for the antidote, and Uncle Zhu reported they were trying to mix the X serum with the antidote to see if it could reduce the fever and unconsciousness duration.

The research department was truly impressive, and Luo Bingting secretly thought that if the fortress were ever compromised, they could not afford to abandon the researchers and their equipment.

The awakening of the researchers’ abilities was also due for discussion.

Just as she was pondering this, Dr. Zhang rushed in, excited to report that several members of the guard team were showing signs of awakening. Luo Bingting couldn't help but exclaim, “That’s incredibly fast!”

Xiao Lu was equally thrilled. He had optimized the ingredients in this batch of awakening serum, not only upgrading the cores and doubling the X serum but also adjusting other ratios. This was a significant achievement for him.

Seeing both of them so exuberant, Luo Bingting couldn’t help but facepalm. It seemed they were really treating them like lab rats.
