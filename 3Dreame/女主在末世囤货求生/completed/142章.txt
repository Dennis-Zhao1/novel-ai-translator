**Sneaky Shenanigans**

Adam Song watched as a woman suddenly rushed forward, effortlessly stepping in front of Serena Zhou, as if her very presence was meant to uphold the idol’s purity. Who did this shameless girl think she was?

Wang Xin was taken aback by Adam's boldness. Just as she considered lowering her raised leg, she felt an urge to kick that pretentious woman. Thankfully, she managed to hold back.

The haughty girl with the delicate features, known as Lily, feigned innocence, her voice dripping with faux sadness. “Brother Xie, why is this young man blocking me?” 

Her tone was so pitiful, it was as if someone had bullied her.

Adam scrutinized Lily, who wore a flowing white dress with her hair casually styled in a loose braid. Her fair skin and stunning appearance made her stand out, but he quickly cast a glance at his friend Leo Sterling. Despite the difference in looks, it was clear that Leo had an undeniable charm that attracted admiration from women, especially with his combination of strength and good looks.

Just then, Zhen Yidan returned, escorted by her uncle, and the group formed a small cluster at the entrance of the dormitory. The other psychic guards exchanged glances, wondering if a catfight was about to break out. 

Three women and one man—was drama about to ensue?

Everyone silently questioned, their gazes flitting between the four of them. Leo, uncomfortable with the scene, had initially come to watch but now found himself unwittingly embroiled in the theatrics. After offering a brief greeting, he decided it was time to leave.

Lily giggled, relishing the attention. “Oh, Brother Xie, why are you ignoring me? Just the other day at the Longxiang Base, you called me ‘cutie’!”

Leo halted mid-step, recalling Lily’s previous antics. Intrigued by her boldness, he chose to stay and watch.

Feeling emboldened by the attention, Lily sidled closer to Xie Jinghang, attempting to wrap her arm around his. However, Zhen Yidan, caught up in the unfolding drama, yanked Lily away. In a dramatic twist, Lily fell to the ground, feigning tears. “Brother Xie, Miss Zhen is bullying me! I’m in so much pain!”

“Stop pretending! Do you think this is the Longxiang Base? Pei Qian and your minions aren’t here to witness your act. Open your eyes and see this is the Apocalypse Fortress,” Zhen Yidan snapped, her hands on her hips, disdain evident in her voice.

“Brother Xie, you need to control her! She’s so vile and spreads rumors. I’m not like that! She pushed me, look at my hand, it’s all scraped!” 

Lily raised her hand, showing off a barely-there scratch that, had they waited a moment longer, would have healed completely.

Zhen Yidan rolled her eyes dramatically, glaring at Xie Jinghang several times, who merely shook his head. He had come to enjoy watching the chaos unfold, and Adam stood nearby, grinning mischievously.

Wang Xin, linking her arm with Leo’s, was thoroughly entertained. She had only seen such antics in dramas.

When Lily noticed no one was rushing to help her after her fall, she climbed back to her feet, dusting off her dress. Turning, she spotted several men from the Longxiang Base standing by the dorm entrance.

“Help! They’re bullying me! Waaaah!” she cried, putting on her best pitiful expression. But this time, her usual tactic fell flat; the men had seen through her facade. They only viewed her as a black-hearted lotus, an opportunist.

The men adopted a “watch and don’t interfere” attitude, leaving Lily without her usual supporters. The show was over; she cast a few sorrowful glances at Xie Jinghang before covering her face and running back to her dormitory, her exaggerated display eliciting involuntary shudders from Leo and Wang Xin.

Before long, both girls burst into laughter, and Adam couldn’t hold back his chuckles, laughing even louder. Zhen Yidan’s uncle didn’t understand the young people’s love-and-hate dramas and sighed, waving his hand as he left. Others, seeing the entertainment had ended, began to disperse.

As they walked back, Leo and Zhen Yidan exchanged glances. “Keep an eye on that Lily girl. If anything happens, let me know,” Leo instructed, before leading Wang Xin back to their dorm. Adam waved goodbye to his idol, unwilling to part just yet, before following them.

Zhen Yidan frowned, her brows knitting together. She turned to Xie Jinghang and whispered, “Why don’t you sacrifice some of your charm to figure out who’s behind her? It’s too bothersome; let’s get this over with.”

Xie Jinghang nodded seriously, then replied, “I can’t just sacrifice my charm on a whim. Don’t be ridiculous.”

With that, he strode into the dormitory, leaving Zhen Yidan to glare at his retreating figure. “Hmph, it’s not like he wants to lose that black-hearted lotus, jerk.”

In their shared dorm room, which was small and cramped, Zhen Yidan was unlucky enough to be assigned to the same room as Lily. The two single beds were positioned on either side, and Zhen Yidan had already set up her belongings on the window side. To her annoyance, she discovered her things had been moved to the door side.

Lily, on the other hand, flopped onto her bed, carelessly tossing her shoes aside, and began to sob into her pillow. Her cries were neither too loud nor too soft, but they were undeniably irritating.

Exasperated, Zhen Yidan opted to ignore her and simply wished for a different place to stay. Unfortunately, due to the limited dorm rooms designed to isolate the residents from the outside world, there was no option. The adjacent rooms were all four-person setups, with twenty people from the Longxiang Base split into five dorms. Xie Jinghang had his own room, while Zhen Yidan’s teammates were cramped into a room with bunk beds. She had inquired about switching to a different dorm, but ultimately decided to tough it out for just one night.

As per their plan, the chosen ten would undergo health checks the next day and be assigned to the awakening observation room. That night, everyone retired to bed early.

Zhen Yidan fell asleep quickly, wishing to avoid looking at Lily’s face. To her surprise, she slept quite well, perhaps due to a lack of proper sleep for a long time. Just as she was tossing off her blanket to get up, a loud, obnoxious voice broke the silence.

“Shut up! If you can’t sleep, don’t disturb others!”
