**A Narrow Encounter**

Li Liqiang’s previously twisted expression softened considerably; he had just acted impulsively. He had thought that Luo Bingting was just like those powerless girls from ordinary families, clinging to him for power and material gain. Little did he realize that she was the little princess of the Luo family before the apocalypse. Even in these troubled times, she still had some self-protection skills, otherwise, how could she have come out on missions with their team?

Her harsh words were indeed tough to swallow, but they were also painfully honest. Li Liqiang was someone who could take others' opinions to heart. If something happened to him, his father would be deeply affected, and there were many eyes on his position.

Realizing this, he forced a stiff smile at Luo Bingting. "Since you say so, Miss Luo, I won’t push it. Feel free to visit the Kunshan base whenever you can."

With that, he turned and got into his car.

Xie Jinghang crossed his arms and observed the young girl who continued to ignore him. He rubbed his nose and also turned away.

At this moment, Meng Ge finally put away his gun, and Luo Bingting lowered her raised arms, signaling everyone to return.

Once back, she informed Grandpa Zhu and Uncle Zhu about what had happened. Grandpa Zhu leaned on his cane, analyzing the current situation. Communication was still down in many areas, and the government had not initiated rescue efforts immediately. Instead, the military had established the Kunshan base, displaying a strangely indifferent and laissez-faire attitude that felt ominous.

After decades of navigating complex situations, Grandpa Zhu found himself at a loss, unable to unravel or decipher the hidden motives behind these actions.

In Luo Bingting's heart, a vague sense of unease began to emerge, only to dissipate too quickly to grasp. She reiterated the timeline of global magnetic field changes, emphasizing that they had about a year to research the zombie virus. In that year, they needed to develop a serum that could rapidly kill zombies and prevent their evolution.

If they succeeded, the magnetic field changes could be a boon for humanity. Otherwise, if humans and zombies evolved together, the ordinary people without abilities would find survival exceedingly difficult. This survival crisis stemmed not only from the zombies but also from humanity itself.

Luo Bingting was determined not to endure such pain and helplessness again. Time was of the essence; Uncle Zhu and his team were working hard, and she was well aware of it, yet anxiety still gnawed at her.

In her previous life, there had been no serum that could combat the zombie virus. What about this life? Remembering that she remained an ordinary person after the global magnetic shift, she resolved to strengthen her mental fortitude. Even if she ended up without powers again, she would rely on her spatial abilities, exceptional physical fitness, and keen perception to avoid falling to the lowest tier of society.

Having been given a second chance, there were still debts to settle, people to protect, and a long life to lead in order to live up to her grandfather’s expectations.

Bringing her thoughts back to the present, she smiled at Grandpa Zhu and Uncle Zhu. "There's no need to be overly pessimistic. The fortress has strong security measures, and we have ample supplies. The crops on the back mountain have already been harvested once. Everything will be alright."

She also suggested that they should go out on missions again, not just to hunt zombies but also to scavenge for supplies nearby, taking advantage of the fact that zombies were currently easier to deal with.

Both Grandpa Zhu and Uncle Zhu agreed. They had never encountered zombies mutated in this way and could only imagine what it would be like. Since Luo Bingting had a plan, they would follow her lead.

Life in the fortress for over half a year had not depleted the supplies stored in Luo Bingting's space, but she still needed to find a legitimate excuse to transfer items out.

Recently, Meng Ge often lamented that he had nothing left to teach Luo Bingting. She had mastered both combat techniques and marksmanship remarkably well. 

However, Luo Bingting held herself to higher standards. Having witnessed the true strength of powerful individuals, she recognized that while she might not like them, their excellence was worth learning from. That individual was none other than Xie Jinghang, whom she often referred to as the "dog man."

The way he wielded his Tang Dao to dispatch zombies was like a flag raised high, something she couldn’t reach no matter how hard she tried.

It would be a lie to say she felt no frustration. In order to survive, she had to work even harder...

As November rolled in, the temperature gradually dropped, and Kyoto began to show signs of impending snow.

Luo Bingting and Meng Ge drove out in search of supplies, both dressed in practical sports jackets. Luo Bingting toyed with the gun in her hands, her thoughts drifting far away.

Ever since their last encounter, Li Liqiang had managed to find out the location of her apocalyptic fortress and frequently sent people to invite her out, leaving her puzzled about his intentions. Of course, no one paid him any mind, and the more they rejected him, the more persistent he became, stirring up rumors among the fortress residents.

It wasn't just Luo Bingting who sensed something amiss; Grandpa Zhu and Uncle Zhu also picked up on the subtle machinations behind those actions. Without any concrete moves or opportunities to act, Uncle Zhu could only strengthen their defenses and increase patrols around the fortress.

Meng Ge drove steadily, their destination set for the Luo family's old residence. They had to take the highway loop, circling from the west to the southeast, passing through several commercial and residential districts.

Just as Luo Bingting was lost in her thoughts, Meng Ge's voice broke through. 

As she regained her focus, the car came to a halt. She looked up to see two groups engaged in a fierce gunfight. Meng Ge stepped on the gas, driving straight into the battlefield.

This was a bit awkward; was there even a way to turn around? Before Luo Bingting could voice her concern, one group was retreating and had already moved dangerously close to their truck.

The truck didn’t seem bulletproof, and just as that thought crossed her mind—

“Bang!”

A bullet shattered a hole in the windshield, right in the center, not immediately causing it to shatter but leaving spiderweb-like cracks that signaled just how close they had come to danger.

Meng Ge quickly grabbed her head and pushed it down toward her seat, bending over himself as he drew his gun and disengaged the safety with his left hand.

Luo Bingting reacted swiftly, already gripping her gun. 

Inside, she couldn’t help but curse. Where had these blind idiots come from? The glass was shattered, and there was no fixing it! Did they want to freeze someone to death in this cold weather?

Hearing the gunfire and shouting outside, Luo Bingting used her mental powers to sense the situation, discovering that the retreating group was using their truck as cover.

“Bang bang bang…”

Several bullets struck the vehicle, the sound echoing ominously.

“Damn it!” Meng Ge cursed, quickly unbuckling his seatbelt and tugging at Luo Bingting.

Luo Bingting had already flung open the passenger door; she understood Meng Ge’s frustration. If they kept shooting, their car would explode.

The two of them quickly exited the vehicle, taking advantage of the brief pause in the gunfire to dash back with all their might.

They found themselves in a commercial area that had been cleared twice before. Using her mental powers to sense the surroundings, Luo Bingting led Meng Ge to hide behind the nearest wall.

“Boom!”

A deafening explosion and a rush of air confirmed that their car had been blown up.

Fuming, she stomped her foot, ready to retaliate and engage in combat.

Meng Ge pulled at her, directing her gaze towards a familiar figure in the chaos.

Luo Bingting’s face turned icy; she turned her head to see a familiar face, and to her dismay, it was one she had seen in even worse shape than before.

Meng Ge, unsure if it was because they had hit it off last time or because they shared a military background, felt a sense of camaraderie and couldn’t bear to watch the other party perish.

“Do we save him?” 

Meng Ge was well aware of Luo Bingting's capabilities and strength.

Luo Bingting was taken aback by Meng Ge's question; considering their past interactions, they didn’t seem particularly close. 

But looking into his anxious eyes, it was clear he genuinely wanted to help.

Meng Ge had never asked her for anything before; he always silently stood by her side. It was rare for him to ask, and she felt compelled to grant his wish.

Turning to look back at the man, she noticed he wasn’t wielding a knife this time; instead, he held a rifle, protecting an injured teammate and preparing for an offensive.

“Save him,” Luo Bingting replied flatly. For now, she couldn’t accept that a flag she hadn’t yet surpassed could fall so easily.

Meng Ge nodded, outlining a battle strategy. Luo Bingting understood, and they switched positions.

Now, she could clearly see who was on the opposite side; it was that bastard.

Gritting her teeth, her gaze icy, her mind focused on a single thought: 

“Die, you bastard!”
