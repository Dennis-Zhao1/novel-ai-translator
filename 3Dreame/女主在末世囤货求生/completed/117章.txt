**A Strategic Deception**

As the envious gazes of the crowd pierced her, the colorful, sparkling third-tier crystal cores in her hands suddenly lost their appeal. 

Lo Bingting took a moment to catch her breath before joining the hunt for crystal cores. Normally, a fourth-tier ability user wouldn’t have it easy against another fourth-tier opponent, especially since she was facing a horde of zombies alone. Her psychic powers gave her an extraordinary edge, allowing her attacks to land with a precision that left the fourth-tier fire zombies dazed for a few crucial moments, just long enough for her to strike them down.

She had hoped to find more fourth-tier crystal cores, but after digging through the brains of zombies from the mountain down to the highway, there was still no sign of a second core. The crew’s resentful glances fell upon the vice-captain, who, like a fool, was proudly displaying the single core he had found in front of the team leader.

Lo Bingting couldn’t help but feel a sense of satisfaction as she watched Xie Jinghang’s expression shift to one of annoyance. Ha! Looks like you’re not so smug now, are you?

Xie Jinghang, aware of her thoughts but not inclined to indulge her childish antics, smacked the back of the vice-captain’s head, urging him to face the crowd. 

The vice-captain turned around, startled to find the team’s expressions dark and foreboding, their eyes filled with a venomous glare that seemed to scream, “You’re dead meat.” 

There’s truth in the saying that one shouldn’t flaunt their successes too openly. Just look at the vice-captain; not only did he get slapped by the team leader, but the other ability users were also hot on his heels, ready to pounce on him. 

The animosity level was rising, and the team members, Meng Ge and An Min, had thoroughly rummaged through the brains of the scattered zombies. With no more hope left, they resigned themselves to their fate. 

It was unbelievable that the only fourth-tier core they found was a fire-type. The team had one metal-type and one wind-type user, both of whom were now weeping over the piles of zombie carcasses before them.

In the jovial atmosphere, they began to pile up their spoils, sorting the crystal cores by their attributes into several small heaps. After deducting the number that needed to be turned in to the fortress, they started dividing the rest among themselves. The fourth-tier fire core remained unclaimed, and the vice-captain’s longing gaze didn’t go unnoticed; the others took the opportunity to tease him.

Their time for lighthearted banter was limited, and Lo Bingting cut through the chatter with her suggestion, “Zombies evolve to fourth-tier much faster than we expected, and we’re bound to see more intelligent zombies soon. It’s going to be harder to deal with them, so let’s absorb these crystal cores quickly and all push to fourth-tier. We need to be ready for whatever comes next.”

She decisively handed the only fire-type core to the vice-captain, who was overjoyed and immediately began to absorb it, not sparing a single glance to anyone else.

Xie Jinghang had also noted the evolving zombies during the skirmish, realizing that some were not even controlled by the hat-wearing zombies. They displayed greater agility and combat capabilities.

Just as they were preparing to haul some zombie bodies back for fuel, a signal flare shot up from the direction of the fortress. The blue flare indicated an enemy attack, the same color Lo Bingting had fired earlier.

Without hesitation, everyone dropped the zombie carcasses they had been handling and rushed to their vehicles, hurrying back to the base.

At that moment, Wu Xiaogang, who had been locked in the trunk, stirred awake. He found himself tightly bound and trapped in darkness, panicking as he kicked around. Typically, the sedative Lo Bingting injected would keep someone out for days, yet he was awake in just a few hours—his high tolerance was evident.

Xie Jinghang and Lo Bingting were in the same vehicle, and they sped away, quickly pulling ahead. When they felt the commotion from the trunk, they initially assumed Lo Bingting had caught a new type of zombie for experiments.

He was half right; it wasn’t a zombie at all, but rather an ability user. Lo Bingting explained the situation, particularly emphasizing the unique abilities of the person in the trunk. Xie Jinghang's brow furrowed in thought, recalling someone from his past. But there was no time to ponder further; they would sort that out after dealing with the enemy.

After navigating several treacherous turns, Lo Bingting nearly drifted around corners, flooring the accelerator. In just ten minutes, they arrived at the fortress.

Those ten minutes were some of the most agonizing for Zhu Yidan since the apocalypse began. She couldn’t believe that zombies had silently infiltrated the fortress, attempting to break down the main gate.

If it had been humans, that would be understandable, but these were zombies. Zhu Yidan was on the verge of becoming a fourth-tier ability user herself, yet her fireballs had little effect against the intruding zombies. Several members of the guard team had already been bitten or clawed. Fortunately, they had antidotes on hand, but the side effects were severe; those who received the injections began to experience paralysis and fever, needing to be isolated for recovery.

The clinic's doctors and nurses were tending to the injured nearby, while Zhu Yidan and the other ability users fought fiercely to prevent the zombies from breaking through the gate.

She couldn’t fathom why these zombies seemed to know where the control switch for the gate was. The fortress's elite ability users had gone out to support Lo Bingting, leaving behind only those who had just reached third-tier, with Zhu Yidan being the only one close to fourth-tier.

As two more ability users fell to zombie attacks, Zhu Yidan's fear deepened. She struggled to land her abilities, the panic threatening to overwhelm her.

Just as she was about to collapse from exhaustion, a teammate noticed her trembling hands and the diminishing size of her fireballs. He urged her to absorb a crystal core to replenish her energy while he dealt with the zombies in front of her.

After absorbing a core, her energy returned somewhat, and the fear and tension eased. She focused her mind, but just then, a zombie lunged at her from behind.

Zhu Yidan let out a scream, and her teammate quickly turned to push her out of the way, only to be bitten on the neck by the approaching zombie. The sight froze the other ability users in shock for several seconds before they finally reacted and attacked the zombie.

Zhu Erge was nearby and rushed to stop the bleeding, quickly administering the antidote. 

Zhu Yidan’s expression soured immediately, her spirit crumbling. With Lo Bingting absent, Xie Jinghang nowhere to be seen, and even Meng Ge missing, she felt utterly alone and on the verge of collapse.

The other members shared her sentiments but continued to hold their ground, battling the zombies that had infiltrated their fortress.

Meanwhile, Lo Bingting and Xie Jinghang had arrived at the fortress entrance. They noticed that not a single lookout was present. After honking several times with no response, they realized something was wrong. Behind them, a horde of zombies was rapidly approaching the fortress.

Lo Bingting parked the vehicle and quickly pulled out her Tiger Claw, firing at the outer wall of the watchtower. Seeing the zombies closing in, she urged, “Hurry! Something’s definitely gone wrong inside the fortress—let’s move!”

Xie Jinghang was still holding onto the weapon Lo Bingting had given him earlier. Using the pull of the grappling hook, they ascended the tower swiftly, flipping over the edge with ease.

The watchtower was indeed empty, and from below, they could hear the sounds of gunfire and clashes of abilities.

Without wasting a moment, they descended and joined the fray. Lo Bingting and Xie Jinghang appeared like divine beings, swiftly dispatching the rampaging zombies in a matter of moments.

Just as Lo Bingting was about to call for Xie Jinghang to head back to the tower for support, she spotted Zhu Yidan, who had been sitting on the ground, now tearfully rushing into Xie Jinghang’s arms, her voice trembling with relief. “You’re finally back! I was so scared!”
