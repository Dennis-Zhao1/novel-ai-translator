### The Legendary Sword Emerges

An Min listened attentively to the instructions, then nimbly climbed up to the beam of the room. The first time he went up, he made little noise, and Luo Bingting didn't change her position. This time, however, he was much more animated, moving with an agility that kicked up a cloud of dust. Luo Bingting quickly got to her feet and stood beside Meng Ge, stepping away from that chaotic corner of the room.

The dust was simply too much to bear.

An Min scurried around the beam like a monkey, making it difficult for Luo Bingting to avoid the thick clouds of dust that swirled around her, leaving her feeling quite flustered. She thought to herself, couldn’t he clean up a little more often, or at least be quieter? If nothing else, he could use an umbrella to shield himself from the dust.

Fortunately, the cloud of dust finally settled. An Min, looking like a mess with his face covered in grime, carefully brought down a thin wooden box. He blew on it to clear away the dust, and the concentration of dirt was visible to the naked eye. Just watching it made Luo Bingting feel a tickle in her throat, as if that cloud of dust had blown right into her face.

Once he finished blowing the dust off, he used his hands to pat it down, earning a displeased look from the old man Zheng, who urged him to stop messing around and hurry up.

An Min obediently handed it over without bothering about his grandfather or uncle, scurrying outside to wash his hands and face.

Old Man Zheng’s trembling hands opened the lid of the wooden box. Inside lay a piece of yellowed paper, folded and looking quite ancient, with corners that appeared to have been gnawed by insects. He held the paper delicately, afraid to crush it, and passed the box to his son, who gently unfolded it. Luo Bingting, with her keen eyesight, could see two rows of calligraphy through the dust floating in the air:

“Legendary sword emerges, chaos across the world, slaying demons and monsters, saving the people.”

Luo Bingting found it puzzling that such phrases from martial arts or fantasy stories would appear here. Instantly, she wondered if this was some kind of murder mystery or if they had stumbled into a film set.

Lost in her thoughts, Luo Bingting suddenly noticed that the old man and the young man across from her were staring intently at her. Their gazes seemed to penetrate through the swirling dust, and she instinctively took a step back, goosebumps rising on her skin.

What are they doing? Why are they looking at me like that?

An Min returned, freshly washed and drying his face with a towel, only to find himself faced with this eerie scene: his grandfather and uncle were staring straight at Luo Bingting, not even blinking.

Meng Ge’s expression darkened as he stepped protectively in front of the young lady. What was wrong with these people? Were they not going to conduct business? Why were they staring at their customer?

His movement broke the tension in the air, finally allowing the atmosphere to shift. Old Man Zheng exchanged a glance with Manager Zheng, who seemed to understand what the old man wanted to say. Silently, he ascended the stairs, leaving Old Man Zheng to fold the paper back up. An Min, who had not seen, felt anxious and fidgety, not daring to approach for fear of being scolded.

It could be said that An Min had a remarkable instinct for self-preservation.

Before long, Manager Zheng returned with a black and gold-covered book that looked somewhat like a family tree or ledger, its pages yellowed with age. 

Luo Bingting remained hidden behind Meng Ge, cautiously peeking out. She had already prepared herself to draw her gun at the slightest sign of trouble, even if it meant risking police involvement to protect herself.

The ancient book with its black and gold cover was handed to Old Man Zheng, who continued to flip through the pages with trembling hands, examining each line, as if searching for something.

Luo Bingting and Meng Ge remained motionless, observing the unfolding drama with wary eyes.

An Min, noticing that neither his grandfather nor uncle was paying him any mind, quietly moved behind his grandfather to help provide light. The sunlight in the hall at four in the afternoon wasn’t too bad, and An Min thought he might as well get a closer look. Since the old man was busy and didn't mind him being there, he figured it wouldn’t be a bother.

Providing more light made the room brighter and more suitable for the elderly to read. 

Pleased with his cleverness, An Min felt a sense of pride, while Luo Bingting found herself amused by his slyness.

Meng Ge remained on high alert, the atmosphere around them thick with tension once more, while Old Man Zheng continued his search without losing pace.

Luo Bingting found her mind wandering, and in such a strange situation, zoning out felt perfectly reasonable. It wasn't long before the old man called for his son to come over and take a look.

From her vantage point, Luo Bingting couldn’t make out the words in the book; the script was too small, likely written in a fine hand, which explained the difficulty in reading it.

Manager Zheng lifted his head, looking toward Luo Bingting, and urgently asked, “Miss Luo, may I ask if your ‘Luo’ is the same as in Luoyang or the ‘Luo’ of the goddess?”

Luo Bingting was momentarily caught off guard by the question and instinctively nodded. “Yes, it’s the ‘Luo’ with three dots of water.”

The expressions of Old Man Zheng and Manager Zheng grew even more astonished, disbelief etched on their faces. How could this be...?

Luo Bingting felt a bit uneasy with the current atmosphere and circumstances, but her years of upbringing kept her from acting impolitely. She weakly interjected, “Um, gentlemen, are we still going to proceed with this transaction? If not, I’ll take my leave.”

“No way!” Old Man Zheng interjected immediately, his expression ambiguous, a mix of emotions hard to discern.

“What do you intend to do? Are you illegally detaining us in broad daylight?” Meng Ge shouted, ready to confront them.

“Not at all! It’s a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding!” Manager Zheng quickly explained, urging An Min to close the courtyard and main gates, before inviting Luo Bingting and Meng Ge to discuss matters upstairs in the study.

Luo Bingting hesitated, but the dust hadn’t fully settled yet, and seeing the old man’s pale face made her uneasy. Meng Ge didn’t want to get entangled with these people any longer; his professional instincts led him to defer to the young lady’s wishes.

Luo Bingting nodded, feeling a hint of apprehension. From the moment they asked about her surname, she had a feeling something was off, and coupled with the four phrases on the paper, she had seen the legendary sword sway and fall right into her arms.

Such absurd events weren't limited to just that; everything that had happened to her could be deemed extraordinary and outlandish!

With such thoughts in mind, she followed them upstairs calmly, while An Min was busy helping his grandfather with water and preparing instant heart-saving pills.

Luo Bingting sat in Old Man Zheng’s study, watching An Min scurry in and out, bustling around.

After taking his medication, Old Man Zheng took a moment to catch his breath and then turned to Luo Bingting, apologizing, “I’m sorry, I’m getting on in years, and I tend to get a little overexcited. I hope I didn’t frighten you.”

Luo Bingting nodded but felt it might be impolite to keep agreeing, so she shook her head gently.

At this, the old man chuckled, gesturing for his son to explain to Luo Bingting.

Manager Zheng, relieved to see his father was fine, began to recount the story. 

It turned out that the Zheng family and the Luo family had known each other for centuries. The Luo family had even consulted the Zheng family for a divination. However, after a calamity struck, the Zheng family suffered heavy losses, and their lineage dwindled. Later, when the descendants sought another divination to ensure the family’s stability for a century, they never expected the prophecy would come to fruition now.

The legendary sword was crafted with great effort by the head of the Zheng family at that time, intended to be presented to the monarch in exchange for the family’s prosperity. In the end, it could only be hung under the main beam of the house for a hundred years, waiting for the calamity to unfold.

“This is fate, written in the stars,” Manager Zheng said with a sense of wonder.

Luo Bingting felt a dawning realization that her family was indeed impressive; they had even predicted the apocalypse. Out of the four lines, two were spot on: chaos across the world and slaying demons and monsters. Wasn’t that true?

The apocalypse was nothing less than chaos on earth, with zombies rampant—there was no doubt about it.

Manager Zheng glanced at his father and then looked back at Luo Bingting. “Since the legendary sword emerged because of you, those four lines of prophecy must apply to you as well. Miss Luo, I have a request. I’m not sure if it’s appropriate to mention…”
