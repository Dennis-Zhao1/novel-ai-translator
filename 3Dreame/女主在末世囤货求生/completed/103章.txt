**The Scene of Social Death**

It was so noisy. Who kept calling out, disturbing her sleep? Couldn’t anyone let her catch a good rest? 

Luo Bingtian furrowed her delicate brows, sitting up angrily, rubbing her disheveled hair while her eyes remained stubbornly closed, refusing to open. 

“Luo Bingtian, wake up, wake up!”

“Ugh, ugh, ugh! Can you stop calling me? It’s so annoying!” 

Luo Bingtian finally opened her eyes and cursed. To her surprise, she found herself in… a space? 

What was going on? 

She strained to recall. It seemed she had been on guard duty alone, almost falling under the control of a hoodie-wearing zombie guy. Then she had flashed into this space. After that… she just fell asleep? 

And who was calling her? 

A series of questions tumbled out of her mouth, and just then, she heard another voice. 

“It’s good that you’re awake.” 

A chill ran down Luo Bingtian's arm at the sound. Aside from her, there shouldn’t be anyone else in this space! She immediately shouted, “Who’s speaking? Show yourself!” 

“It’s me, Xuanjing.” 

No other sounds came, but the large screen of Xuanjing glowed with a soft white light. 

Luo Bingtian looked up, puzzled over what she had just heard. 

But Xuanjing didn’t explain; instead, it displayed a single phrase: 
“You’ve been here for quite a while; hurry and get out.” 

Luo Bingtian frowned at those words. Weighing only about 90 pounds, with 89 pounds of that being stubbornness, there was no way she would just listen to him. 

“Chasing me away? Not a chance!” 

Xuanjing sighed in exasperation. 

“You’ve been asleep here for ten days. Can you imagine how long it’s been outside?” 

“What? Ten days?! Oh my god, I gotta go!” 

Without waiting for a response, Luo Bingtian flashed out of the space, completely oblivious to her disheveled appearance. 

The moment she emerged, she stepped on something and lost her balance, tumbling down. 

Oof, it didn’t hurt. Luo Bingtian instinctively closed her eyes. When she opened them again, a handsome face loomed large before her, startling her into a scream. To her surprise, the other person screamed even louder. 

“Xie Jinghang, are you crazy? Why are you here? You scared me to death!” 

“What are you yelling for? A big guy like you is scared so easily?” 

Luo Bingtian took the offensive, flipping the script on him. 

Xie Jinghang’s expression was indeed not great. Seeing her appear like a ghost from a horror movie was startling enough for anyone to scream. This wasn’t about his courage! 

Faced with her accusation, he could only mutter, “Are you okay?” 

“If you hadn’t tripped me, I would’ve been just fine!” 

Luo Bingtian was the queen of retorts, not missing a chance to jab at him. 

“Are you sure you’re really okay?” 

Their banter drew the attention of other superhumans on the city tower. For the past few days, they had been busy digging crystal cores and transporting zombie corpses for burning, leaving only two people on guard duty. As they approached to greet them, upon seeing Luo Bingtian’s face, they all jumped back in fright. 

Xie Jinghang wore a look that clearly said, “See? I told you so.” Luo Bingtian glanced at them suspiciously, then recalled that she hadn’t paid attention when she first woke up. Maybe her hair was a mess after sleeping? She couldn’t help but smirk at their overreactions. Pulling out a small mirror from her space, she took a look and screamed, “A ghost!” 

With a loud crash, she threw the mirror far away, and it landed right on Xie Jinghang, who was closest to her. 

The atmosphere grew increasingly strange. Xie Jinghang didn’t push her to explain; instead, he let her act like an ostrich, waving his hand to send the onlookers back to their duties. He tossed a coat over her head, and she quickly yanked it down, feeling as if she were being dragged by the collar toward the city tower below. 

Luo Bingtian was genuinely embarrassed. Her mind was a whirlwind of regret, shame, and a mix of emotions—an entirely mortifying social death. 

Xie Jinghang stifled a laugh, saying, “Alright, alright, no one saw.” 

“Wah, I just want to die!” 

Her words caused Xie Jinghang’s chest to vibrate with suppressed laughter. 

Only when he had escorted her back to her dormitory and she sat on the sofa did she finally release her grip on the coat, her head hanging low. In the next instant, she vanished, reappearing completely cleaned up, her makeup redone, and her clothes and hairstyle in perfect condition. 

Xie Jinghang was already seated on the other sofa, watching her with an amused expression. Once she had composed herself, he began asking about what had happened that day. 

Luo Bingtian told the truth, which was pretty much what Xie Jinghang had guessed. Her memories were also hazy, especially regarding what happened after she entered the space. She had no idea how she had ended up sleeping for so long, nor could she recall how she ended up looking so ghastly. 

She didn’t mention that Xuanjing was able to speak; she hadn’t figured out why that was yet and didn’t want to waste his time with it. 

The key point now was to understand what that hoodie-wearing zombie was and what its powers were. Having experienced it firsthand, Luo Bingtian expressed her thoughts. 

“I believe it’s likely a psychic-type mutant zombie. It can seduce and control the thoughts of superhumans. Its powers are strong and domineering; once locked onto a target, it’s hard to break free. Otherwise, how do you explain that I was walking forward uncontrollably, with my mind completely blank?” 

Xie Jinghang nodded in agreement. 

“I saw you disappear into the space right before my eyes. I wanted to have the noisy guy contact Xuanjing to check on you, but he said that the space where Xuanjing resides can block all signals. At that moment, you entered the space just in time, cutting off the zombie’s mental control over you. That’s why I saw it roar; it was probably out of unwillingness and fury at losing its prey.” 

Luo Bingtian was surprised he had seen so much. Thankfully he had shown up; otherwise, with no one guarding the watchtower and her entering the space, if that psychic zombie came in and controlled a few people, the consequences would have been unimaginable. 

“So this zombie attack was orchestrated by it? What could its motive be? Is it controlled by Fu Buqi?” 

Luo Bingtian speculated boldly. 

Xie Jinghang pondered the connections. From what he understood, Fu Buqi had never had a favorable attitude toward zombies; he was quite ruthless when it came to exterminating them. Moreover, with the psychic zombie’s powers being so potent, how could Fu Buqi manipulate it for his own ends? 

Everything felt like a tangled mess of mysteries, like a ball of yarn that had been pulled apart. No matter how they tried to untangle it, they couldn’t find the thread’s beginning. 

He turned back to Luo Bingtian and asked, “How did you manage to break free after it locked onto you? That’s crucial; if we encounter it in the future, we might be able to prevent it beforehand.” 

Luo Bingtian thought for a moment and simply said, “I had my guard up after the first time it attacked. When I realized my head was starting to feel numb, I immediately entered the space.” 

Xie Jinghang considered her words for a moment before asking, “Since you were aware of its attack, can you mimic its methods?” 

Luo Bingtian shook her head vigorously. “Don’t joke! That’s a psychic ability! I can’t do that. But if you want two ice spikes, I can do that!” 

Hearing her insist with such certainty, Xie Jinghang shook his head and dropped the topic. Instead, he began recounting the situation of clearing the pile of corpses over the past few days. 

As Luo Bingtian listened and nodded, she realized it was time to get back to work after resting in the space for so long. With that thought, she stood up and headed toward the exit. 

By the time they reached the entrance, a clear path had been made at the gate, so there was no need to rely on earth-type abilities to create a staircase anymore. Once outside, instead of the others who were hacking at zombies, Luo Bingtian held her sword, slicing through them one by one. 

Of course, she didn’t use her renowned sword, opting instead for a Dragon Spring sword given by the Zheng family that she found to be handy. She teamed up with other superhumans, working like a well-oiled machine—one person would open the zombies’ heads, another would extract the crystal cores, and the third would handle the transportation of the corpses. 

Their speed was impressive, but Luo Bingtian still found it too slow. She couldn’t help but wish she could just summon the crystal cores to her from a distance, lifting her hand for them to fly right into her palm. 

But she kept that thought to herself; otherwise, the other superhumans would laugh at her for dreaming. Instead, she focused on the task at hand, knowing there were plenty of heads waiting to be cracked open.
