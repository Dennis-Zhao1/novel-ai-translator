**Exit of the Cave**

“Master, why didn’t you go with Team Xie?” 

After driving for a while, Wang Xinxin suddenly asked, glancing at Xie Jinghang’s car, which was getting further away.

An Min had a gossiping expression on his face; although he didn’t say anything, his demeanor clearly indicated that he was fully engaged in the drama unfolding. Remembering how sneaky he had been last night, Luo Bingtian realized that An Min must have misunderstood the situation. She felt there was no need to explain, so she simply replied, “We’re working in groups to be efficient. Our task this time is to find the earth mounds from the previous cave. Don't just chat, pay attention to anything unusual outside the windows, and speak up if you sense anything.”

Having spoken earnestly, Wang Xinxin exchanged a knowing glance with An Min, and they both chuckled inwardly at Luo Bingtian’s clumsy attempt to change the subject so abruptly. They soon settled into a more serious mood, each focusing on the scenery outside.

Luo Bingtian was driving her newly modified car, ignoring Pei Qian’s eager gaze. Before he could say anything, she was already speeding away from the base. This car was her pride and joy, and there was no amount of money that would make her part with it.

They drove in one direction until they reached a winding mountain road. After that, they couldn’t drive any further. Once they parked and got out, Luo Bingtian stored her car away, while Wang Xinxin chased after An Min, completely oblivious to what was happening behind them.

The two were suddenly racing against each other, but Wang Xinxin had forgotten that An Min was a wind element ability user and would naturally be faster. He was just teasing her, walking at a leisurely pace while pretending to let her catch up.

“Look at this silly girl,” Luo Bingtian thought, amused as she watched them play around, opting to lag behind and let them enjoy their fun.

Meanwhile, Xie Jinghang was with Luo Fan. Noticing Luo Fan’s demeanor, Xie realized he must have copied Wu Xiaogang’s abilities, as he was trying to avoid any contact with others. They had been traveling in another direction for quite some time. Checking the compass, they confirmed they were heading southwest toward the fortress, while Luo Bingtian was heading directly south, reaching the point where they would have to proceed on foot up the mountain.

Without further discussion, the three of them began climbing the mountain, chatting as they went. Luo Fan idolized Xie Jinghang, captivated by his past as a special forces soldier and his strength as an evolved ability user in this post-apocalyptic world.

“Team Xie, do you prefer Miss Zhu or Miss Luo? Don’t mind my directness, but I genuinely think Miss Luo is better. Of course, I’m not saying Miss Zhu is bad; it’s just that I ship you and Miss Luo more,” Luo Fan said, ending with a shy chuckle, completely oblivious to the awkwardness in the air. 

The other teammate raised an eyebrow at Luo Fan, thinking to himself that this guy was indeed brave. No one had ever dared to speak so boldly to Xie Jinghang before—at least, he wouldn’t.

“Oh, what do you mean by ‘ship’?” 

“Your CP with Miss Luo! Although you have many ships, I’m firmly in the Xie-Luo ship camp. The others are just cults,” Luo Fan replied proudly.

“From your words, I must have quite a few ships, huh?” 

“Definitely! Besides you and Miss Luo, there’s also the one with Miss Zhu. Some people in the fortress even ship you with Brother Meng and the vice-captain!” 

Xie Jinghang understood what “shipping” meant, but the thought of being paired with Brother Meng and the vice-captain was just absurd. There was a clear physical and psychological barrier there.

The teammate’s eyes nearly popped out at the revelation, and Luo Fan’s status in his mind skyrocketed. Here was a true warrior, unafraid of facing danger, yet Xie Jinghang wasn’t angry. He never expected his captain to engage in such light-hearted banter about shipping.

As they continued to walk and chat, it was mostly Luo Fan speaking while Xie Jinghang listened, providing occasional responses. The teammate remained silent, trying to blend into the background.

They climbed for about three hours, stopping to rest. Xie Jinghang took out binoculars to survey the area. 

Meanwhile, things weren’t much better for Luo Bingtian. The two children ahead had been energetic at first, but soon they were both worn out. An Min had exhausted too much of his ability and was now recovering energy by absorbing crystals, while Wang Xinxin was sprawled on the ground, gasping for breath.

Looking at the composed Luo Bingtian beside her, Wang Xinxin felt regret. She shouldn’t have let herself be provoked and raced against An Min; now she was too tired to even move—how embarrassing!

After letting them rest for half an hour, Luo Bingtian began searching the area. This was the southern mountain of the fortress, and below them lay the winding mountain road. It was highly likely that they would find an exit to the cave here, but strangely, despite climbing to the top, there were no signs of anything unusual.

Once the two had recovered enough, they continued their search. This time, they walked for nearly two more hours until they reached the summit, where they needed to change direction for a horizontal search. Luo Bingtian had a strong sense that the cave exit should be nearby.

Upon reaching the top, they found nothing out of the ordinary. Luo Bingtian planned to use a serpentine search pattern, which had just been decided in the meeting.

Fortunately, they soon discovered an unusual mound of earth. Quickly, Luo Bingtian led her team forward, and indeed, there was a large pile of fresh soil, revealing a hole barely a meter wide.

As soon as she set off the signal flares, they noticed that other teams had also spotted them.

“What’s going on? Are there flares from so many directions?” 

Luo Bingtian counted the flares and found around seventeen different locations, indicating there were likely seventeen exits.

With no news from the hydroelectric plant, Luo Bingtian didn’t want to linger. After filling in the hole, the three of them hurried down the mountain. It felt strange—there should only be one exit, yet here were seventeen, or perhaps even more, considering some teams might not be following orders properly.

Wang Xinxin asked uncertainly, “Master, does this mean these mountains and the fortress have basically been hollowed out? Are we at risk of a collapse?”

Luo Bingtian thought carefully; there was indeed a possibility. She didn’t want to be killed by mutated plants or zombies, but rather be crushed by a landslide.

She quickly found Xie Jinghang and the team, who were laboriously backfilling the hole. Their positions weren’t far apart, and Luo Bingtian’s serpentine search had brought her close to Xie Jinghang.

“Is it the same situation over there? Small mounds and holes?” 

Xie Jinghang paused to rest. Thankfully, they had an earth element ability user; without tools, they would have struggled to manage the soil.

“Yes, I suspect these small mounds and holes are a diversion,” Luo Bingtian replied.

Xie Jinghang grew serious at her words. If that were the case, where was the real cave exit?

Perplexed, they resolved to wait for reports from their respective teams once they returned to the fortress in the afternoon.

Just as the two teams prepared to descend the mountain, a sudden rustling noise echoed from above, followed by distinct sounds of chewing and eating.

Xie Jinghang pulled out his binoculars, scanning the source of the noise, his face changing dramatically.

“Quick, we need to get down the mountain!”
