**Chapter 1: The Unspoken Tension**

Uncle Zhu let out a heavy sigh as he stood before the storage cabinets, his frustration palpable. Luo Bingtian, unable to resist her curiosity, strolled over with a bright smile and asked, “Uncle, what’s wrong? Why the long face?”

“Luo girl, you’re here! I’m so worried,” Uncle Zhu lamented, gesturing to the cabinets. “Look at all these projects we’ve been working hard on. It’s such a shame—without power, once we leave this low-temperature environment, the cultures in these petri dishes will die off. And all those precious formulations? They can’t be stored without proper conditions. The emergency power supply is running low too; see the red light? All our previous research may go to waste.”

“Don’t be upset, Uncle. We’re still here, the data’s still here, and we can always start over,” Luo Bingtian reassured him. A few students nearby echoed her sentiments, encouraging Uncle Zhu to gather whatever materials he needed to take with him.

Once the area cleared and she was sure no one was around, Luo Bingtian quickly raised her hand, utilizing her spatial abilities to discreetly store the connected cabinets. This way, she could preserve the reagents perfectly and later surprise Uncle Zhu with them. She wandered around, collecting some office supplies and computers that looked relatively new—no files were left behind, and no one was around to notice her actions.

Not lingering too long, she returned to where the others were. Meng Ge and the team had divided the supplies among themselves, items they had brought along just in case.

Luo Bingtian decided to act as if she had also given away her share, not wanting to draw attention. After grabbing a quick bite, fatigue washed over her. The girls teamed up to find a quiet room to rest, while the boys stayed outside, taking turns to keep watch.

At that moment, Meng Ge struck up a conversation with Xie Jinghang. They were both on the same mission, having fought against zombies together for a while now. Despite not starting off on the best of terms, they had developed a camaraderie, sharing stories and bonding over their experiences.

Luo Bingtian found herself brooding over her desire to toss that green tea girl down the elevator shaft or into a horde of zombies, fantasizing about various ways to deal with her. Yet, she couldn't shake off the feeling that Xie Jinghang, that troublesome man, had been watching her closely for the past few hours.

Fearing exposure, Luo Bingtian resolved to tread carefully, longing for the dawn to come when they could part ways and return to their own lives. If he wanted to protect his precious green tea girl, so be it; the world wasn’t that big, and there would always be another opportunity.

She consoled herself with the age-old adage that revenge is best served cold, hugging herself in a moment of self-pity, and ultimately blaming Xie Jinghang for the predicament she found herself in.

The night passed quietly, without any surprises. Although the researchers were unaccustomed to physical hardship, most were young and resilient. Uncle Zhu and Auntie, though older, had recovered enough to be on their feet again.

The only one who had fainted, Zhang Hao, woke up after several bottles of glucose had been administered. The first thing he did upon waking was to seek out his “little fairy.” Uncle Zhu chuckled, “Zhang is finally back on his feet! Young people bounce back fast!”

Luo Bingtian, however, was taken aback by the puppy-dog look in Zhang Hao’s eyes. Why was he grinning like an idiot?

Was this guy really a PhD? It didn’t seem possible!

Zhang Hao paid no mind to what others thought of him; to him, it felt as if he had come close to death and had witnessed a divine being descending from the heavens to save him. In his mind, it would be rude not to express his gratitude.

If he knew what others thought of his feelings, they would undoubtedly say, “No need for that!”

Luo Bingtian remained relatively calm, but An Min was not as composed. He didn’t care whom Zhang Hao liked, but he definitely found it annoying how talkative he was. Every time he asked Luo Bingtian a question, he wouldn’t wait for her response before providing his own answer.

“Miss Luo, do you like roses?” he asked, not waiting for her to reply.

“I love roses too, especially red ones! They’re the most passionate, lively, and beautiful!” he proclaimed, gazing at her with stars in his eyes, seeking her agreement.

This kind of behavior made An Min want to pull his hair out. He hadn’t needed to deal with this kind of nonsense since elementary school!

Luo Bingtian was at her wit's end. “Someone, please help me!”

Meng Ge noticed that his little lady was struggling under the relentless attention from the overly enthusiastic boy, and he couldn’t help but chuckle. When he first became Luo Bingtian's bodyguard, she had just turned eighteen and was still very innocent. Now, she was at an age where discussions of marriage were becoming relevant.

It felt like watching his daughter grow up while knowing a pig was coming to the trough. 

He took a closer look at the recovering Zhang Hao, who wasn’t bad-looking at all. He was the kind of pretty boy often discussed online, the type that could easily be described as a “little puppy.” Despite being so young, he was already a PhD, which spoke to his high intelligence. Pairing him with Luo Bingtian was a stretch, but not entirely unreasonable.

Having evaluated the situation, Meng Ge decided not to intervene with Zhang Hao’s persistent attention and chatter. Even if Luo Bingtian looked a bit exasperated, he believed she should enjoy the feeling of being pursued; it would add completeness to her life. This was how he justified his lack of action, embracing the role of a protective father figure as he navigated his thoughts.

As dawn broke, everyone prepared to move out. They learned they could only access the laboratory through the elevator, so they decided to retrace their steps.

Meanwhile, the three women and two men still in the elevator shaft had huddled together all night, too afraid to move.

On the way back, Meng Ge stated that they would not be concerned about the survivors; their primary focus was to retreat quickly. Xie Jinghang shared the same sentiment, arranging for his subordinates to transport the packed research materials.

Once everyone had exited the laboratory, Luo Bingtian seized the opportunity to sneak back inside unnoticed, determined to salvage the valuable equipment she had spotted earlier.

She stored all the irreplaceable materials and computers in her spatial pocket, collecting them as she went. When she finally left, she cleverly shut the outer door of the laboratory behind her. Once the emergency power ran out, no one would be able to open it again, ensuring that her actions remained undiscovered.

There was no specific reason for her to do this other than the fact that she found the equipment impressive and deemed it a non-renewable resource. Luo Bingtian would never admit that her space was too vast and empty, and leaving it unused felt wasteful.

In the eyes of the others, she had only lagged behind a bit, rejoining the group without drawing any suspicion.

At that moment, all of Xie Jinghang’s attention was focused on how to escape the elevator shaft. The elevator door on Basement One was completely blocked by a car, making it impossible to enter or exit.

The front half of the car was wedged into the elevator, leaving barely twenty centimeters of space. Zombies couldn’t get in, but they couldn’t get out either.

Thus, they devised a new plan to exit via the elevator on the first floor, still uncertain about the number of zombies lurking outside. Teamwork would be essential.

When the group saw Xie Jinghang and the others return, the three women and two men in the elevator shaft were overcome with emotion, tears welling in their eyes as they apologized profusely.

Uncle Zhu and the others were well aware that Xie Jinghang had sacrificed two rescue team members for these individuals, and they gave them the cold shoulder, ignoring their pleas.

Luo Bingtian was indifferent; as long as they didn’t get in her way or follow her, she didn’t care if they lived or died. However, her desire to take out that green tea girl was impossible to hide.

Noticing Xie Jinghang’s gaze fixated on her once more, Luo Bingtian cursed internally at that troublesome man. Couldn’t he just focus on that woman for a while?

Was it against the rules for him to look at her? If he was so capable, he should be protecting her at all times. Otherwise, humph!

Knowing that glaring at the green tea girl wouldn’t solve anything, Luo Bingtian began discussing the plan for leaving with Meng Ge. With Xie Jinghang no longer watching her, it confirmed her suspicion—they were definitely involved with each other!
