Negotiation

It was unclear whether the opposing team had been holding their skills for too long, but a careless release sent a wave of abilities flooding out. Electric nets spread wide for an attack, earthen shields rose to block, and metallic shuttles along with icy spikes shattered one after another. In a flash, both sides exchanged a volley of skills, depleting each other's energy reserves.

Just as the next round of skills was about to be unleashed, a long-haired beauty suddenly raised her hand and shouted, "Stop! You've mistaken us for someone else!" 

At her command, the group surrounding Luo Bingtian reluctantly halted. Their abilities had been either countered or deflected, and they hadn't experienced such a frustrating skirmish in a long time. With their powers ignited, they were ready for a fight, only to have their enthusiasm extinguished by her words—like pouring cold water into a boiling pot, leaving a simmering dissatisfaction in their hearts. 

It felt like they had their pants down and were given a mere slap on the wrist instead.

Seeing the beauty take charge, Luo Bingtian confidently stepped out of the vehicle and approached her, clearly stating her intentions. Upon hearing the woman announce herself as the master of the End of Days Fortress, the long-haired beauty's frosty demeanor cracked, revealing a hint of surprise.

They smoothly entered the Longxiang Base. The armored vehicle couldn't be parked in front of others, so after a few exchanges, they agreed to keep their space abilities under wraps and parked in the base's lot.

Anmin insisted that Brother Meng lock the vehicle securely, clutching the keys protectively as if fearing theft. 

This cautiousness from Anmin was quite normal, and the long-haired beauty didn’t think much of it as she led them into the base, where they underwent a thorough check at the entrance.

They inspected for injuries and weapons. With Luo Bingtian's space abilities, any potential hindrances were swiftly tucked away. She cooperatively registered her powers and level. When the beauty noted that she was a Level Four Ice-type mutant, her expression was one of sustained astonishment. Currently, Longxiang Base only had their leader at that level, so finding two Level Four mutants in the End of Days Fortress was unexpected.

Luo Bingtian, who typically played the role of a modest underdog, could have easily understated her level to a mere Level Three to avoid drawing attention, but she decided not to hide, opting instead for a straightforward approach.

Once everyone was registered, the way the people at Longxiang Base looked at them shifted. With an average level above three, they inferred that the End of Days Fortress was no small fry. Longxiang Base had previously been plagued with many Level Two members who were only just beginning to rise due to a recent influx of energy cores.

Anna, the long-haired beauty, led them to a small tea room beside the hall on the first floor, introducing herself, “Hello, I’m Anna, the team leader of Team Three at Longxiang Base. I apologize for the misunderstanding earlier. I hope you can overlook it.” 

Seeing Anna's politeness, everyone waved their hands dismissively. After all, no real harm had been done, and the skirmish was brief. Besides, they were here to negotiate cooperation, promoting harmony over conflict, so they didn’t press the issue. Anna arranged for some hot water to be served and left to inform higher-ups, bowing out gracefully.

However, what had begun smoothly turned bumpy when it came to meeting Pei Qian. Luo Bingtian retrieved lunch from her space for everyone, and after finishing their meal, they still hadn’t received word on their meeting.

Anmin, feeling full and drowsy, could no longer stay still and started wandering around the room. The most composed among them was still Xie Jinghang, who sat with his arms crossed, lost in thought.

They shared some drinks, and if it weren’t for the situation, they might have engaged in a lively game of cards to pass the time. Finally, as the clock neared three in the afternoon, Anna rushed back in, repeatedly apologizing. 

“I’m so sorry! Pei Laoda had an unexpected delay. You can come with me now. I’m really sorry for the wait.” 

Still maintaining her courteous demeanor, Luo Bingtian didn’t want to be upset with the beautiful girl, especially not when her icy exterior contrasted so charmingly with her polite demeanor. The other men felt a bit awkward too, but after being left waiting for so long, their faces didn’t look too cheerful as they silently followed Anna.

The building’s elevator was out of order, likely due to the power supply only being able to sustain basic nighttime lighting, with torches hanging on the walls—a clear indication that even maintaining illumination was a challenge.

They climbed seven flights of stairs before finally reaching Pei Qian's meeting spot. The building had twenty floors, and the seventh floor was likely chosen for their convenience; any higher would have been a hassle.

While leading the way, Anna described the base’s situation, but she was unaware of the true intentions of Luo Bingtian and her team. She simply stated that the seventh floor housed Pei Laoda’s office and reception area.

The office was simply decorated. As they ascended the stairs, they entered the break room, and the next room was the general manager's office. Through a semi-transparent glass partition, Luo Bingtian caught a glimpse of a tall figure standing with their back to the door, gazing out the window.

Before entering, Xie Jinghang paused briefly, then stepped inside as Anna knocked and signaled for the guests to be seated.

Brother Meng instinctively positioned himself behind Luo Bingtian, causing Anmin to stand next to him as well. The team members followed suit, lining up behind their captain as if to establish their presence—after all, if others had a show of force, so should their leader.

In the office, the black sofa only seated one man and one woman, with two bodyguard-like individuals standing behind each. Luo Bingtian found it amusing, but Pei Qian had already turned to look at them, and it would have been awkward to ask the four of them to sit when they seemed more inclined to stay standing.

Xie Jinghang, however, had a different perspective. In front of someone familiar from a past life, this almost juvenile behavior felt incredibly embarrassing. He couldn’t show his discomfort openly and instead sat with a grave demeanor, exuding an aura of coldness.

As Luo Bingtian observed Pei Qian approaching, she was slightly taken aback. He looked nothing like the formidable leader she had imagined—his appearance and demeanor were quite different. He was tall, though not quite as tall as Xie Jinghang or Brother Meng, standing at about 185 cm. Lean and dressed in a shirt and trousers, the sleeves of his shirt rolled neatly to his forearms, revealing defined fingers and slender wrists.

It was hard to imagine what he must have been like in the underworld during brawls; the contrast was striking.

Noticing Luo Bingtian’s lingering gaze on Pei Qian, Xie Jinghang raised an eyebrow slightly—did she like this type? He had never seen her look at anyone with such interest for this long.

Once Pei Qian took his seat, Anna closed the door, and the room fell into an awkward silence, the air thick with tension as no one dared to break the stillness.

Luo Bingtian felt a stir within her, contemplating whether to say something when Xie Jinghang spoke up, “Pei Laoda, I assume someone has mentioned the purpose of our visit. We’re here to seek a definitive answer, as we have what you need.”

Luo Bingtian realized that this wasn’t part of their plan but chose to remain silent, trusting Xie Jinghang to lead the way.

Pei Qian studied Xie Jinghang for a long moment before nodding, “Then tell me, what is it that I need?”

Xie Jinghang smiled calmly, “A life-saving special medicine.”

Pei Qian’s expression, however, was no longer calm. This was something the majority of the base members were unaware of, let alone the person relaying the message. How did Xie Jinghang, an outsider with no connections to the core of Longxiang Base, know about this?

Yet his face remained impassive as he pinched his fingers, then looked up again, “How am I to believe that your medicine is effective?”

Xie Jinghang smirked slightly. He initially thought to say something blunt like "a dead horse is better than a live one," but reconsidered, opting for a more diplomatic approach.

“Well, you should know that our fortress has a biological laboratory, so the credibility of developing a special medicine is quite high. Plus, you really don’t have a choice.”

“Just give it a try, and you’ll find out the results. It couldn’t get any worse, right? But there’s always hope.”

Adjusting his tone proved effective, showcasing his emotional intelligence perfectly.

Pei Qian seemed to be moved by these words and spoke again, “Your request isn’t difficult, and he mentioned a special medicine, but it’s not available at the moment. If your claims turn out to be true, then I won’t interfere or cover for him.”

Luo Bingtian understood—this person they could dispose of was definitely Fu Buqi. But what kind of special medicine was he referring to?

At that moment, Xie Jinghang leaned closer to her and whispered two familiar words in her ear, “Lake Water.”
