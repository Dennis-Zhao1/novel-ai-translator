### Chapter Title: The Unknown Depths

The small flying saucer zipped through the air, ascending rapidly. Xie Jinghang felt a twinge of anxiety that they might exceed the operational limits and lose control. Just then, the chatterbox spoke up again, “Don’t worry! The small saucer won’t lose connection unless it’s damaged beyond repair. So relax!”

Xie Jinghang ignored him, focusing intently on the screen. At this speed, the vertical black hole ahead looked exceptionally deep. After the small saucer climbed a few more meters, the screen flashed, revealing another black hole. These two black holes seemed to intersect at a right angle. Xie Jinghang quickly reduced the saucer’s speed, even pausing momentarily to confirm whether he was seeing things or if it was real.

The small saucer began to descend slowly until Xie Jinghang could clearly see the black hole. Without hesitation, he directed the saucer inside, only to be met with a sight that made him feel queasy: a dense mass of grotesque flowers. They weren’t as large as the ones they'd seen just a couple of days ago, but they were just as ugly.

One of those flowers had already given them a hard time—how were they going to handle so many?

In a low voice, just loud enough for Luo Biting to hear, Xie Jinghang shared his findings. Luo Biting grasped why she hadn’t sensed them with her mental energy; it was simply too far away. It seemed they still had a good distance to cover.

They couldn’t let these hideous flowers continue to multiply. Who knew when they would completely surround or take over the apocalypse fortress? Ignorance was bliss, but seeing them would only gnaw at her peace of mind.

Xie Jinghang shared her concern. But how were they supposed to ascend through that vertical passage? This mountain range was the tallest surrounding the fortress. If they couldn’t go up from below, they’d have to come down from above.

As the small saucer neared the end of the black hole, a glimmer of light appeared on the screen. As the saucer ascended higher, the light grew brighter. Once the display lit up entirely, Xie Jinghang knew they had emerged. The saucer hovered above the black hole, scanning the surroundings, effectively becoming Xie Jinghang’s external eyes, providing him with a clear view.

He didn’t immediately retract the saucer but allowed it to hover near the opening of the black hole, using it as a GPS locator.

After discussing their findings, the two reached a consensus: they would lead the group back the way they came. By now, Wang Xinxin and the others should have returned to the fortress. Without lingering, they quickly made their way back.

The group easily jumped over a fissure about a meter wide and soon arrived at a spot teeming with small crystal nuclei. Luo Biting was still contemplating the points system, debating whether to collect some for points. But Xie Jinghang grabbed her arm, leading her directly past the area of uncollected nuclei.

Luo Biting understood he didn’t want to waste time and didn’t press the issue further. They could always come back to mine these after handling the immediate crisis; they wouldn’t go anywhere.

The time spent inside felt drastically shorter than outside. Everyone perceived the return journey as swift and smooth, and before long, they exited the cave and headed straight down the mountain.

Upon arranging for everyone to return to the apocalypse fortress, Xie Jinghang and Luo Biting announced they would search for the entrance of the black hole. Some wanted to follow, while others urged them against it, fearing for their safety.

“Don’t worry, everyone. The sky is darkening. Hurry back to avoid any unforeseen incidents. Finding the entrance is something me and Xie will take care of; you don’t need to fret,” Luo Biting instructed, watching the others leave until only she and Xie Jinghang remained.

Everyone knew Luo Biting had a spatial ability, but no one had ever asked her how vast it was, what it could hold, or what her limits were.

After Xie Jinghang meticulously described the location, he could see on the system’s screen where the small saucer was hovering. Luo Biting nodded, realizing it was time to deploy some of their resources.

They stood on the highway, and Luo Biting gestured for him to step back. Xie Jinghang complied, and in the next moment, a massive, vibrant pink helicopter appeared in the middle of the road.

She called for him to check the helicopter’s condition. Although she had ensured it was in good shape beforehand, safety always came first; a pre-flight check was essential.

After quickly completing the inspection, Xie Jinghang motioned for Luo Biting to board, ready to take off.

Luo Biting had never learned to pilot a helicopter; in fact, she initially bought it for Meng Ge. Now, sitting next to Xie Jinghang, she realized how unpredictable life could be.

Watching Xie Jinghang expertly control the helicopter, she settled into her seat, content to be a passive observer.

Despite the large mountains beneath them, flying was significantly faster than traveling on foot. Thanks to the system’s guidance, Xie Jinghang quickly located the area where the small saucer was stationed. He had seen a broad, treeless clearing not far from the black hole, perfect for landing the helicopter.

Luo Biting assumed they were merely scouting the area, but was pleasantly surprised to find an ideal landing spot nearby—absolutely perfect.

Once they had landed, they glanced at the sky, noting that time was of the essence.

“I couldn’t say much in the cave, but the three members of the guard team might not have even entered the cave,” Xie Jinghang remarked.

“Hmm? Where could they have gone?” Luo Biting inquired.

“I’m not sure. However, there are indeed adult male footprints leading from the cave entrance a distance inside, but they vanish unexpectedly. I thought they might be the guard team, but I haven’t found any traces of them along the way. If they had encountered the red-haired demon, the mad sea urchin, or the grotesque flowers, they would have been dead by now—there would be no way they would leave no trace behind.”

Luo Biting nodded, contemplating who else could have left those footprints if not the guard team. Was it Fu Buqi?

The thought of this possibility heightened their urgency to uncover the secrets hidden in the mountain. Was Fu Buqi inside? They needed to unveil the truth.

They reached the edge of the black hole, which appeared distinctly different from the previous cave—they could tell it had been artificially excavated.

Xie Jinghang, having accumulated ample points, exchanged them for various equipment. He secured a climbing rope to a nearby tree and tossed the other end into the black hole. Luo Biting followed suit. Although she hadn’t piloted a helicopter or parachuted before, she had experience with climbing and had grasped the basics.

As she donned her gear and secured her safety rope, Xie Jinghang hastily finished his preparations before checking on her. She had fastened everything correctly and just needed minor adjustments. Giving her an approving nod, he released the small saucer again. It flew down, tethered by a thin rope.

Luo Biting watched as the rope wound tighter around the saucer, marveling at how deep it must be. Soon, Xie Jinghang called out that it was time.

He was the first to grasp the rope and slowly descended, back toward the black hole. Luo Biting followed closely behind, the two of them moving cautiously downward.

Xie Jinghang wore a safety helmet that Luo Biting had collected during a resource run, and she had equipped her own helmet, complete with a headlamp for illumination.

After a considerable descent, they approached the horizontal opening. The small saucer remained quietly at the entrance, waiting. Once Xie Jinghang reached the bottom safely, he secured the rope to the rocky wall of the opening, turned around, and carefully assisted Luo Biting down, ensuring she landed securely on solid ground before untying their ropes.

Taking a deep breath, Xie Jinghang turned to Luo Biting and said, “From here on out, even if you don’t have a fear of dense crowds, just be careful.”
