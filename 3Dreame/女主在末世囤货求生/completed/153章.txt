**Preparing for Battle**

With everything meticulously arranged and all essential items gathered, what was once a warehouse meant to stabilize the people's morale vanished in the blink of an eye, safely tucked away into the spatial realm. Each of the ability users received their combat supplies, which included not only crystal cores but also ample drinking water and convenient food supplies.

The guard team was equipped with firearms as usual, while those without shooting experience were given Longquan swords and daggers forged by the Zheng family. Although the number of weapons was limited, it was enough to adequately arm a team.

Looking at the refreshed ability users, many of whom now resembled soldiers, Luo Bingtin felt a sense of pride at the significant training progress they had made during this time. Uncle Zhu took some time to meet with Luo Bingtin privately, reporting on his observations. Nodding in acknowledgment, she called for her younger uncle to bring a list. She circled a few individuals and assigned them to the most isolated spots, splitting them up so that their movements could be discreetly monitored.

Everything else continued as usual—training and patrolling were still the order of the day, but with increased frequency and caution. Anmin had been shadowing Luo Bingtin closely. Luo Fan and Wang Xinxin, newly promoted ability users, reported any anomalies to her regularly. Anmin's gaze lingered on the two, a little too long for someone who usually didn't pay much attention to such matters.

“What are you looking at? Is there a problem?” Luo Bingtin asked, raising an eyebrow.

“Uh, nothing much. It's just that those two aren’t bickering today. It’s a bit harmonious—I'm not used to it.”

Luo Bingtin thought for a moment. Indeed, it had been quite a while since those two little rivals had clashed; it used to be that every time they met, a fight would break out. It seemed there were no eternal enemies after all.

Time passed slowly, or at least it felt that way to Anmin, who found the strange situation torturous and confusing, with no end in sight. His thoughts were written all over his face, prompting Luo Bingtin to chuckle.

“If you’re bored, you can spar with me. I was just thinking of trying out a new skill.”

Anmin perked up immediately, excitement coursing through him as he prepared to engage. He quickly assumed a stance, and Luo Bingtin took her time, allowing him to get ready. The moment the first gust of wind blade sliced through the air, she slightly tilted her body to dodge it and unleashed a flurry of ice spikes.

As Anmin faced a barrage of ice spikes flying toward him, he darted to the side in a panic, eyes wide with terror. “Whoa, this is intense!”

Seeing Anmin still had the energy for banter made Luo Bingtin smirk. With both hands working rapidly, she closed off all his escape routes. Anmin quickly shouted, “I give up! I give up! Spare me, sis!”

With another wave of her hand, all the ice spikes halted in midair, creating a shimmering dome around Anmin, who looked like he was trapped in a crystal prison. He gave Luo Bingtin a thumbs-up, bowing in exaggerated gratitude, which made her burst into laughter. 

She gently waved her hand, causing all the ice spikes to fall to the ground, the sound echoing like falling jade—pleasant and melodic. 

Bouncing back to Luo Bingtin’s side, Anmin grinned widely. “That was amazing! Did your powers upgrade? I’m only a Level Four, and I could only dodge one attack. The level suppression is ridiculous!”

Luo Bingtin nodded; she had indeed reached Level Five, able to wield ice in all its forms with ease. Still, she preferred the ice spikes—they were sleek, stylish, and incredibly satisfying to use.

Their sparring session had drawn the attention of those nearby. Observing Luo Bingtin’s rapid progression, they all understood the influence of the ability-enhancing potions. The allure of power was immense, especially since Anmin, who once stood as a formidable opponent, was now easily overwhelmed.

If Anmin couldn’t compete, what did that make them? 

Excitement bubbled up. Just then, every mind, including Anmin’s, echoed the same thought.

“Miss Luo, I want to level up too, haha!”

Anmin was always straightforward. Luo Bingtin nodded in agreement. “Wow, when? Can it be today?”

His eagerness was comical, hands rubbing together like a greedy fly. Luo Bingtin found it amusing but still shook her head. “No, not now. The lab has been emptied, and the researchers have been relocated. Who's going to give you the injection?”

“Oh, then we have to ensure our researchers are safe until they return.”

That remark reminded Luo Bingtin that Meng Ge still couldn’t leave; she needed to keep a close watch over those precious resources.

It wasn’t until almost nine at night that Xie Jinghang returned to the fortress. Zhu Yidan was back on duty, monitoring the lookout. Upon seeing several large vehicles approaching, she knew they had returned.

Luo Bingtin waited at the gate, and after Pei Qian and the others disembarked, she immediately detailed her plans to Xie Jinghang and Pei Qian. Without hesitation, Xie Jinghang contacted Meng Ge, instructing him not to return just yet. He hadn’t reached his destination, and the number of zombies along the way was considerable. Only six ability users had been sent with him, and they had cleared the path. Knowing they were back eased his concerns, and he kept reminding Xie Jinghang to take good care of his young lady.

Luo Fan and Wang Xinxin once again reported together. Luo Bingtin instructed them to take Pei Qian’s team down to collect weapons and supplies, granting them the same treatment as allies. They could guard the fortress and earn some crystal cores in exchange for ability-enhancing potions or awakening potions.

This trade was a win-win; otherwise, why would Pei Qian rush back? He, too, wanted to know what would happen next—it sounded rather intriguing.

She specifically went to check the deep pit, gesturing to Pei Chang. “Look at this huge hole. I hear it’s pretty deep. When you’re alone, don’t go near it. If anything changes, stay far away to avoid getting hurt.”

Luo Bingtin rolled her eyes, while Xie Jinghang shook his head. Ever since they learned about the demise of the little white lotus, these two had been overly affectionate, their chatter incessant.

“Host, you should put in some effort too. Men need to be proactive. Are you really waiting for the little fairy to make the first move?” 

“You can only stare; you can’t go back. Doesn’t that frustrate you? If I were you, I’d chase after the fairy relentlessly, clinging to her and seeing who could be more clingy.”

“Shut up! You think you’re so clever.”

Xie Jinghang understood that men needed to take initiative, but after several attempts, Luo Bingtin’s reactions had been consistently cold. The one time she had come close to him had startled her so much that she had pushed him away. He no longer wanted to face that rejection. Some impulses and thoughts had to be buried deep within him, and he had to restrain himself.

He didn’t understand what love was before, but now he was starting to grasp it more each day—restraint and considering her feelings.

Pei Qian and Pei Chang clearly noticed the tenderness in Xie Jinghang’s gaze toward Luo Bingtin, though his expression remained stoic. They exchanged knowing smiles and walked back to their dorm hand in hand.

The wind in the mountains at night was fierce. With the new black hole, the air flowing from within created gusts, carrying the scent of damp earth. The sound of the rushing wind was accompanied by odd hissing noises, which only Luo Bingtin’s sharp hearing caught. She quickly ordered everyone to step back to the edge of the square. Just as the crowd was puzzled, a dark object shot out from the depths of the black hole.

“Run!”
