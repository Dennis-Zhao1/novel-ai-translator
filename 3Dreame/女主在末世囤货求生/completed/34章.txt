**Global Travel Stockpiling II**

Chris’s emphasis on efficiency truly resonated with Lottie. If they were to travel at the usual leisurely pace, it would take them weeks to explore all these countries. Their mission this time was clear: procurement. Chris made sure not to waste time on unnecessary detours.

If he had such a large volume of goods to purchase, he would simply call or email his orders and wait for the logistics to deliver to his doorstep. Lottie’s method of running around the world seemed to him a way to rationalize her inexperience with international travel, allowing her to complete her tasks while also enjoying the sights.

This was all about timeliness. Even with fast international logistics, there were no guarantees; sending empty packages to attract attention or divert focus was a gamble at best, especially with the chaos looming before the apocalypse.

Lottie didn’t mind the fanciful thoughts she was conjuring up in her head about their travels. As the cargo ship sailed away, she, Chris, and their companion stood side by side, feeling the sea breeze against their faces while waiting for the delivery from the ice wine factory. They even snapped some carefree photos in the process.

Since the news about the jade stone gambling scene in Myanmar had gone viral, the stakeholders had come to realize that this “little princess” had a streak of luck, and they no longer worried about her whereabouts. After all, she was still the biggest shareholder; her family's business would never be neglected.

Lottie made it clear that the previous tactics of the various families had left her feeling uncomfortable, and she needed to travel abroad to clear her mind. This would also help her to remain hidden from the ongoing events, making it easier for the families to maneuver their plans.

Having just taken a picture, she sent it to Grandpa Zhu, cleverly not revealing her stockpiling activities abroad, using a perfectly legitimate excuse to play her part without raising suspicions.

This fun escapade was something she absolutely had to share with her girlfriends. Her friend, Yidan Zhu, who was stuck at home playing along with the act, couldn’t help but send five or six voice messages filled with envy, jealousy, and accusations of Lottie’s heartlessness, expressing her displeasure.

It wasn't until Lottie mentioned she would bring back local specialties that Yidan finally calmed down. The two laughed and chatted until Chris’s arranged vehicle arrived.

Lottie didn’t want to stockpile too much ice wine. First, she had already gathered numerous varieties back in her home country, just not ice wine. Second, she didn’t want to waste too much time waiting for the factory to prepare her order; she preferred to grab whatever was available on the spot.

Less than half an hour later, the truck from the ice wine factory arrived at the port, coincidentally bringing a batch of export orders that needed to be shipped out. Lottie’s order was just a convenient addition. After a quick inspection and payment, she repeated the process.

Once in the vehicle that Chris had arranged, Lottie took out her notebook and made a couple of marks on her procurement list. The unnamable satisfaction she felt was hard to conceal. Chris didn’t quite understand the shopping desires of women—was it really that enjoyable?

Lost in thought, Chris found himself surprisingly influenced by her excitement. On the way to the airport, he unexpectedly arranged to procure a batch of supplies. After paying the deposit, he chuckled to himself about being affected by Lottie’s enthusiasm, but to him, it was no big deal—after all, he needed to stock up on essentials too.

Their next destination was Australia, known for its grain-fed steaks. Just the thought of the marbled texture and the creamy aroma when seared made Lottie salivate. This trip, she was determined to transform her stockpiling journey into one filled with culinary delights.

Private jets were generally not too affected by air traffic control. With Chris’s arrangements, there was no worry about takeoff delays; they could soar at any moment. The weather had been exceptionally clear lately, and the calm before the impending chaos felt almost surreal.

As Lottie sat on the plane, she flipped through a guide to other Australian specialties, marking down items to acquire aside from steak—wine, kangaroo meat, and king crabs, all of which she planned to savor.

Next on her agenda was a trip to the Land of Romance, renowned for its wines and wheat, and also famous for its chocolate. Back in her past life, chocolate had been a rare commodity; anyone with a stash of cocoa butter chocolate was considered fortunate.

Lottie was filled with anticipation, and Chris, half-squinting, observed her scribbling away in her notebook. He felt remarkably relaxed after their outing, showing a great deal of patience and resourcefulness to support Lottie in her shopping spree.

Canada and Australia were not far apart; a few hours of flight brought them to their next stop just as night fell. After checking in, Lottie couldn’t resist slipping into her secret space to admire her recent haul.

Tons of seafood awaited her—fresh and abundant, with several boxes of caviar stockpiled. She realized she could feast on this for ages. It wasn’t about the money spent; rather, compared to the grains she had collected, it felt insufficient. She needed to plan better.

Riding the high of her excitement, she compiled a complete inventory of her accumulated goods, and as she organized them, they seemed less than impressive. Looking around the expansive secret space, she felt as if she hadn’t even filled a sixth of it, which left her feeling somewhat underwhelmed.

In reality, she had gathered materials for movable houses and furniture that far exceeded the list provided by her divine guide. With enough stock to open several large supermarkets, she could hardly complain.

Lottie reminded herself that without comparison, there was no harm done. With plenty of funds still available, she swore she wouldn’t return home until her space was full—though she dared not dream of completely filling it.

The following morning, Lottie accompanied Chris to the largest steak export factory in Australia. He had already communicated the required quantities, and now they were just waiting to inspect and ship the goods, which would be flown back to her home country using the latest preservation technology, ensuring they remained fresh as long as there was power.

Lottie provided the address for the doomsday bunker and listed her uncle from the Zhu family as the contact person. Going abroad for shopping was quite normal; it would be strange not to bring anything back.

Next, they headed to Australia’s largest grain processing company. Feeling that she hadn’t stockpiled enough food, Lottie insisted on acquiring more flour and other supplies, ideally some wheat that could be both eaten and cultivated.

They followed their usual routine: inspect, pay, and load the goods onto the ship, then into her space—a significant worry lifted from her shoulders.

Afterward, the group ventured to the most famous steakhouse in the area for a hearty meal. In an instant, Lottie realized she had purchased too little steak. If she shared some with the Zhu family, she might just have enough to eat.

Consoling herself, she reminded herself that the beef from the Land of Romance was equally renowned, and it had a lovely name. She could always stock up more at their next stop.

Kangaroo meat skewers paired with Australia’s famous wine made for a delightful meal, leaving Lottie feeling quite pleased with herself. She rubbed her chin, reflecting that all this eating had made her face rounder. She’d have to check for a double chin when she got back.

Watching her eat with a mix of satisfaction and regret, Chris found it amusing. Opposite him, their friend, Meng, continued to devour his meal, ordering another steak and two servings of pasta. Lottie had to persuade him to swap the pasta for another steak.

“Come on, after traveling so far, you’re not going to eat beef? Are you trying to save me money? Is that how little you think of me?” she joked.

In the afternoon, they visited the largest and most famous winery. Here, the wines were aged in oak barrels, and after sampling a few varieties, Lottie selected the two most renowned—one with the longest aging and one best suited for women. She ordered two hundred barrels of each, knowing that each barrel could fill three hundred bottles. 

With no time to wait for bottling and labeling, she bought the barrels outright. Not even Chris or the winery owner had seen such a bold move before. Lottie brushed it off, saying it would make it easier to avoid any doubts.

She also picked up empty bottles and labels, expressing that she could bottle them herself when she returned home. The oak barrels were indeed more suitable for long-distance transport, and the winery owner was understanding, even throwing in extra bottles to prevent damage.

These orders would also need to be shipped, so she followed the delivery to the port. After a series of quick operations, Lottie felt that if everything required port delivery, they might as well make a single trip.

Chris hadn’t anticipated her purchasing so much. He really couldn’t fathom the experience of spending all your savings in one go. Surely, it couldn’t be that she was planning to return to run a business? It wasn’t as if she was preparing to confront the apocalypse, right?

When they returned from the port to their hotel, it was already dinner time. This time, they feasted on seafood—lobsters, king crabs, and white oysters, three of Australia’s treasures. It was said that red meat pairs with red wine, and white meat with white wine, so Lottie made sure to bring the white wine gifted by the winery owner to complement her meal, eating with her eyes sparkling in delight.
