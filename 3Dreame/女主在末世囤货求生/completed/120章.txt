**Explanation**

All eyes turned towards the person who had spoken. The moment he opened his mouth, those who knew him could instantly recognize who he was.

“Captain Xie, you've already become a powerful ability user, with authority and influence, enjoying both fame and fortune. What right do you have to oppose this?” A frail, pale man spoke angrily.

“Exactly, what gives you the right?” The crowd erupted in angry shouts, revealing the immediate tension between ability users and non-ability users.

This was already the apocalypse; every possible method to increase survival chances had to be tried, and the opportunity was right in front of them. It was not something that could be easily stopped by one person's words.

“Let’s not create divisions here. Captain Xie hasn’t even stated his reasons yet, and you’re all jumping to conclusions. It’s unnecessary.” At this moment, Zhu Yidan, who had regained her composure, suddenly spoke up. Luo Bingtin raised an eyebrow, seemingly surprised. Were these two truly in sync?

Watching the ordinary people getting riled up, each of them anxious and demanding a stance from Luo Bingtin, who was on stage, she furrowed her brows and looked at Xie Jinghang. Wasn’t the awakening program for abilities something that had already been confirmed before their departure? Why was he opposing it now?

Xie Jinghang also looked across the crowd at Luo Bingtin on stage, his expression cold and silent.

Zhu Xiaoshu was puzzled too. What were Xie Jinghang and Zhu Yidan up to? To prevent the situation from escalating, he hurriedly stepped onto the stage to mediate.

“Everyone, please calm down. The ability awakening potion has just been developed and is still in the clinical trial phase. It has not been mass-produced yet. Today is merely a mobilization meeting to gauge everyone’s interest in awakening abilities. Those interested can come to me or Liu Xiaohui after the meeting to sign up. But this awakening process does carry risks; it’s not guaranteed to succeed. You all need to be mentally prepared to handle the possibility of failure. Moreover, we are not accepting applications from minors under 18 for now.”

The crowd remained unsatisfied with Xie Jinghang, their frustrations boiling over as they continued to shout accusations. While no one dared to directly insult him, given his well-known strength, many interpreted his thoughts in the most malicious ways. Upon hearing that they could sign up, their attention quickly shifted, and they began discussing who to sign up with after the meeting.

At this point, Luo Bingtin had already left the stage. She needed to find out what Xie Jinghang was really doing. After he spoke up, many possibilities began to swirl in her mind. Since her rebirth, it had been difficult for her to genuinely trust anyone. Most important matters were in her own hands. However, she had a higher degree of trust in Xie Jinghang compared to others.

They had exchanged secrets, knowing each other's deepest and most hidden cards. Moreover, Xie Jinghang had never betrayed her. Even when she deliberately delegated authority to him, she never saw him make any small moves. His actions today were completely unexpected. A voice in her mind sarcastically noted that what was meant to come would eventually arrive.

Just by looking at Zhu Yidan’s attitude towards him, it proved that her understanding of him might only be the tip of the iceberg. Even the system, which was an external aid, might only represent a small part of him.

Reminding herself to stay calm, reason told her that even if Xie Jinghang truly had something going on with Zhu Yidan, it was essential to consider how much of their secrets he had shared with her. He could share his secrets with anyone he chose, but if...

She braced herself for both the best and worst outcomes, letting out a soft sigh. Of course, she hoped for the best.

Xie Jinghang remained silent, offering only his three-word opposition, and stood aside, watching coldly as if he were not the one stirring the pot.

Luo Bingtin was not the only one wanting to hear Xie Jinghang’s explanation. Core members like Meng Ge and An Min also wanted to understand his reasoning.

Of course, they couldn’t just dismiss him because of his opposition; they had to give him the opportunity to speak.

The group with heavy expressions made their way to Luo Bingtin’s office, where the sofa and chairs were filled with people. They left the guards at the door, and everyone inside the office focused their gaze on Xie Jinghang, eager to find out what he was really planning.

Xie Jinghang met their unwelcoming gazes with a smile. “Don’t look at me like that. I can explain.”

Unexpectedly, everyone around him spoke in unison, their expressions and actions eerily synchronized, arms crossed in a “let’s see what you come up with” stance.

“Then go ahead and explain.”

Feeling a little guilty, Xie Jinghang rubbed his nose and said seriously, “Today I inspected the maintenance points of the power station and the route the zombies took toward the fortress gate, and I discovered several issues.”

“Do we really need you to say there’s a problem? Stop wasting time. What does this have to do with opposing the awakening of abilities?” Meng Ge, impatient, interrupted. He had considered Xie Jinghang a brother, but now, during such a critical moment, he found him rambling about obvious matters.

Xie Jinghang didn’t get angry over this. Zhu Yidan immediately jumped to his defense, saying, “Captain Meng, don’t be so harsh. Let him finish.”

Meng Ge was taken aback by her response. He looked at his lady, who seemed indifferent as if she hadn’t heard anything, then exchanged a glance with An Min. He decided not to press further. Both of them were overwhelmed with unspoken thoughts.

Zhu Xiaoshu, who had been playing the role of a silent observer, felt a sense of foreboding.

Clearing his throat and not bothering to argue, Xie Jinghang continued, “The normal maintenance points connect to the most turbulent section of the river. Even if the zombies found the entry point, how could they immediately discern the direction and accurately locate the maintenance point?”

Upon hearing this, the sharp-minded individuals quickly grasped the implications. Indeed, while the power station was large and easy to identify, the idea that the zombies could pinpoint the maintenance point so quickly and easily break through the iron net of the maintenance area amidst the raging waters was highly improbable.

Xie Jinghang, Meng Ge, and the others had not been gone long to assist Luo Bingtin. The hooded zombies were still on the mountainside near the winding mountain road. Even with their speed, it would take them at least an hour to traverse from that side. After calculating the time Luo Bingtin and the others took to eliminate the zombies and gather the crystal cores before seeing the blue smoke signal, it became evident that the timeline was tight. This left only one possibility.

There was a mole inside the fortress, and they had guided the zombies to the precise location of the maintenance point.

What was baffling was why they would risk entering through the maintenance point. In reality, the zombies could have easily broken through a random wall surrounding the fortress. Xie Jinghang seemed to anticipate the crowd’s confusion and explained, “Breaking through a wall would create too much noise, easily alerting the patrols and triggering the alarm. Entering through the maintenance point has its advantages: first, the power station is relatively remote, and the noise from the machines is already loud; second, the maintenance point is easier to breach without much effort; and third, the zombies chose this route because it’s the quickest and shortest path from the power station to the gate, taking only ten minutes.”

Meng Ge still remained puzzled. “What does this have to do with the awakening plan?”

Xie Jinghang looked at his confused expression, patiently elaborating, “All the ability users have been dispatched. Only those stationed at the watchtower and at the power station have the capability to fight back. Zombies don’t distinguish who the infiltrators are. The real infiltrator would never take the risk of exposing themselves to danger. Moreover, the remaining ability users in the fortress were mostly bitten by zombies, making it highly likely that the infiltrator is a non-ability user. If this person then acquires abilities through the awakening plan, it would make their subsequent actions much easier and harder to eliminate.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Meng Ge suddenly understood, while Luo Bingtin had already linked his inspection of the maintenance point to broader implications. If this person was indeed a spy sent by Fu Buqi, she started to think about how she would utilize this pawn. What if there were more than one?

As this realization struck her, she felt a chill run down her spine. Fu Buqi had long been in contact with Zhu’s sideline and could be said to know the inner workings of the fortress quite well. If his people successfully became ability users through the awakening plan, they would essentially turn into a group of enemies against her.

In the midst of the crowd's uncertain gazes, Luo Bingtin suddenly conceived a plan. The office was filled with trusted allies, but to avoid too many voices and distractions, she needed to put on a show. If Xie Jinghang was willing to take the blame and draw fire, then she could use that to her advantage and lay out her strategy behind the scenes.
