**What are you looking at, dog man?**

"Hello, Uncle Zhu, Auntie, and two brothers! Long time no see. You’re still crying harder than before, huh? Tsk, so ugly!" 

After saying this, she pulled out her phone and snapped a few pictures, causing Zhu Yidan to scream in frustration.

Luo Bingtin laughed at her for a while, watching as she pulled herself together and dug food out of her backpack to throw to them, urging them to quickly replenish their energy.

Meanwhile, she had already opened the intercom to inform Brother Meng that they found the researchers and Zhu's family, but they were stuck behind electronic password locks that needed power to open. If not, they would have to crawl back through the ventilation ducts.

At this point, Zhu's older brother interrupted, "There's no need to complicate things. Just find the control room for the lab's electrical circuits from the outside, modify the wiring, and connect it to the emergency power supply. The electronic locks don’t consume much electricity; the emergency supply will be enough."

Hearing this, Luo Bingtin felt extremely relieved. She really didn’t want to crawl back and forth anymore; her back was almost numb from hunching over.

Suddenly, the voice of Captain Xie came through the intercom. "Professor Zhu, hello. I’m Captain Xie Jinghang of the Special Operations Team. We’ve been in contact before about the rescue operation for your team."

Luo Bingtin's eyes widened in disbelief. This person was also here to rescue Uncle Zhu? 

Why hadn’t anyone mentioned it earlier? It made sense why he had been so proactive later on. If she had known, she would have let him crawl instead. What a mistake that was!

Brother Meng then had Luo Bingtin pass the intercom to Zhu's older brother. Following his instructions, they found the control room for the lab’s electrical circuits. It was a small, secluded room.

The door was designed to blend in with the exterior wall, hidden in the background, so only those familiar with the interior could find it.

Captain Xie took charge of modifying the circuits, and Luo Bingtin saw that they could finally leave through the door. 

She directed Zhu's two older brothers to help her move an office desk, then jumped down from the ventilation duct. After tossing the rope aside, she sat next to Zhu Yidan and wiped her tears.

Aunt Zhu didn’t look well; her complexion was pale. Luo Bingtin asked about it and learned that Aunt Zhu had a chronic illness and hadn’t brought her medication inside. 

She hadn’t taken her medicine for several days, so Luo Bingtin quickly rummaged through her bag, searching her consciousness for the right medication. When she finally found it, she deliberately took out an extra pill as if she had scavenged it.

After taking the medication, Aunt Zhu took a long time to feel better, her complexion gradually improving—perhaps it was the hope of seeing the outside world again that lifted her spirits.

They had been trapped for five days; the snack cabinet in the observation room had been emptied, and they had run out of drinking water. Just moments ago, they were arguing over the last sip.

Uncle Zhu hurriedly inquired about the situation outside, and everyone listened intently. When they heard about the zombie outbreak, Zhu's family members finally breathed a sigh of relief, knowing everyone else had retreated to the Doomsday Fortress.

The older brothers were deeply moved to hear their younger siblings were risking their lives to save them; they vowed to treat their younger brothers better from now on, promising not to lash out unnecessarily and to be gentler.

Zhu Yidan leaned against her best friend, looking worn out and tearful. Luo Bingtin joked to lift her spirits, but she couldn’t stand seeing her friend in such a pitiful state—it was downright annoying.

After saying a lot, Zhu Yidan didn’t respond until Luo Bingtin mentioned there were handsome guys outside. At that, she perked up a little, urging her to come clean.

Luo Bingtin recounted how they had entered, practiced their skills, and encountered the special forces team, including the annoying survivor teammates.

Uncle Zhu expressed deep sorrow for the fallen members of the special operations team, who had sacrificed their lives to save him. Luo Bingtin didn’t dare to counter his sentiment, though she personally believed that if one didn’t meddle in matters that didn’t concern them, they wouldn’t die.

Zhu's older brother spoke back a few more times, and then they heard a click as the electronic lock on the door activated. Luo Bingtin was the first to stand, helping Aunt Zhu to her feet. She quickly opened the door with a sword in one hand and a flashlight in the other, urging everyone to follow closely.

No one dared to assume there weren’t any zombies in the lab, remaining cautious.

On the other side, the lab door opened to reveal the previous group, who were supporting each other as they made their way toward the light.

Seeing his students safe, Uncle Zhu felt relieved, even though they had starved and suffered for several days; at least they were alive.

Now, guided by Zhu's older brother, Luo Bingtin took the lead, hurrying toward the exit of the lab when her sharp senses caught another sound.

As they approached an office, she instinctively thought it might be a zombie. She threw open the door, shining the flashlight inside, and Uncle Zhu exclaimed, "Zhang Hao! Are you okay?"

Luo Bingtin realized it wasn’t a zombie, but rather a pale-faced man wearing glasses lying on the floor. She handed the flashlight to Zhu Yidan and stepped forward to check if he had been infected. His pallor didn’t look good.

Zhang Hao, in a daze, saw a little fairy walking toward him, backlit by the light. He smiled dreamily, then promptly fainted.

After examining him, Luo Bingtin determined he was simply dehydrated and had been lacking food. She quickly gave him a few sips of bottled water, intending to get him out first.

Meanwhile, Zhu's older brother had already given Captain Xie the lab’s password, and the two teams met up inside the lab.

Since they had gathered everyone, they hurried to leave. Those who could walk did so; those who couldn’t were helped or carried.

Luo Bingtin and Zhu Yidan supported Aunt Zhu through the middle of the group, with Zhang Hao being carried at the back by Captain Xie’s team.

It was already 9:30 PM. Based on her experiences from her previous life, she knew it was unwise to venture out at night; turning on lights made them easy targets.

If they didn’t turn on the lights, they couldn’t see anything, and zombies were more agile at night than during the day.

Unexpectedly, Captain Xie had the same line of thought. While everyone was eager to leave the lab, only he and Luo Bingtin seemed to be on the same wavelength.

Unable to directly share her past experiences, Luo Bingtin offered a simple explanation: driving at night was dangerous because visibility was poor.

Everyone quieted down, realizing they had to stay in this dreadful place for one more night, which dampened their spirits.

Luo Bingtin instead said, "You’re all anxious for nothing. Uncle Zhu, you haven’t collected your research materials yet. Are you really going to leave them here? Can you bear to do that?"

Only then did Uncle Zhu realize there was a lab specifically arranged for him in the Doomsday Fortress, and he couldn’t abandon his previous research and findings.

He slapped his forehead and called over a few of his students who were still in decent shape, rushing off to gather their things.

Captain Xie observed the little girl’s clever expression and couldn’t help but smile.

But why did she know the outside situation was grim? Just hours ago, she had seemed eager to wrap things up and return home.

With this question in mind, he carefully watched her. Luo Bingtin, whose senses were sharp, soon noticed that the dog man across from her was watching her again. Did he suspect her? What had she revealed?

Keep watching, huh? Don't blame me for making the first move if you keep staring. I’ll silence you before you can spill anything—deaths erase all traces, humph. Though her mind was in turmoil, Luo Bingtin maintained a facade of calm, feeling split inside.

Irritated by the scrutiny, Luo Bingtin stood up, pretending to check on Uncle Zhu and the others gathering their belongings while also casually exploring the entire underground lab area.

Uncle Zhu had been packing for nearly an hour, collecting documents, USB drives, and even dismantling computer hard drives. Well, to protect the integrity of the scientific research, it was worth it.

Without any zombies around, everyone felt free to wander. When Luo Bingtin spotted Uncle Zhu, he was standing by the storage cabinets that held emergency power supplies, where they had first passed through.
