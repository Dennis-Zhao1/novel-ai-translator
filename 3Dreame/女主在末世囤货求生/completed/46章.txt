### Practice Makes Perfect

The only window in the room that hadn’t been covered with curtains revealed a dire situation inside. From the seventeenth floor, it was evident that there were quite a few zombies roaming around—at least four or five were visible in the frame. Lying on the ground were several bodies, but it was impossible to tell if they were simply dead or yet to undergo transformation.

This small office space hinted that the entire floor was likely in a similar state of chaos. And that was just the seventeenth floor; the conditions on the floors below remained a complete mystery.

An even bigger concern loomed over them: they had no idea where Uncle Zhu’s family was. The few of them who had only trained for a few days felt that this mission was going to be hellishly difficult.

Luo Bingtin retrieved the drone, taking a moment to scan the surrounding area. It seemed other survivors had noticed them; she spotted a woman in her twenties, dressed in a professional outfit, frantically waving at the drone from the glass of an office building near the entrance. The woman’s face was stained with tears as she sobbed while trying to attract attention.

“Luo Jie, should we rescue her?” An Min asked.

The third brother and Xiao Qi also turned their gaze to her, waiting for her decision. Luo Bingtin pondered for a moment. The primary mission was to rescue Uncle Zhu, and given their limited strength, it wasn’t feasible for everyone to go rushing in to save someone.

However, the three young men looked at her with eager eyes. She opened her walkie-talkie and informed Meng Ge about the situation on the seventeenth floor. She suggested that they take the opportunity to practice their skills, perhaps find a building with fewer zombies to test the results of their recent training.

Meng Ge approved of this training approach. They had brought a substantial amount of supplies for this trip—enough food and water for three days—preparing for the possibility that the mission could be challenging.

After getting out of the vehicle, everyone drew their Longquan swords, falling in line behind Meng Ge and Luo Bingtin as they made their way to the office building where they had spotted the survivor.

Meng Ge glanced up and noticed the woman still waving frantically. He made a shushing gesture, understanding that making noise could attract the zombies. Tears streamed down her face, but she remained silent.

The building appeared to be an administrative office for the park management. Given the zombie outbreak’s spread, this was likely the twentieth incident. On a typical workday, there would be plenty of employees here.

The woman was on the third floor in an office facing northeast, allowing her to see the returning drone. The first floor was also clear of zombies. The eight of them formed a line, finding the fire escape. Meng Ge led the way, while the third brother and An Min followed closely behind, advancing cautiously to the second floor. This was a training exercise, and they would eliminate any zombies they encountered.

This was the plan that Luo Bingtin and Meng Ge had devised. Perhaps the property management company was not large, but the office spaces were expansive, and there were very few people. They faced a total of three zombies on the second floor. Meng Ge lured one over, and in front of the others, he swiftly sliced through the charging zombie with his sword.

The blood of a zombie had turned thick, dark, and foul-smelling after transformation, oozing out only in small amounts from the gash. Everyone noted that the zombies weren’t particularly fast. With the training they had undergone over the past few days, they felt confident enough to take them on, and their courage surged. 

They all wanted to be the one to kill the next zombie. However, before they could argue over it, the second and third zombies heard the commotion and came running toward them.

Xiao Qi and the fourth brother each tackled one—Xiao Qi stabbed his while the fourth brother slashed. They dispatched the zombies with ease, and as Meng Ge provided feedback on their techniques, he said, “Xiao Qi, you’re still a little fearful; your strikes lack decisiveness. You need to work on that. Fourth brother, you’re brave but need to conserve your energy; you’re swinging too hard.”

Xiao Qi nodded, admitting he would work on overcoming his fear and advised his fourth brother to save some stamina instead of exhausting himself in one go. 

This sentiment was true; it was all about using minimal effort to take down as many zombies as possible, much like gaming strategies where you aim for the maximum damage with the least resources.

The fourth brother nodded and switched positions with the fifth, eighth, and An Min. Luo Bingtin scanned the second-floor offices and found no additional zombies. Suddenly, she thought her psychic abilities might help her check the situation on the third floor.

As she extended her mental reach, she found that the third floor indeed had more zombies than the second. They controlled their volume on the lower level, ensuring the zombies above didn’t hear them.

She didn’t relay the upstairs situation to her team, knowing that revealing her abilities could be risky until they encountered other supernatural beings. Once she felt it was safe, she signaled that they could proceed upstairs.

The eight of them rearranged themselves, with Meng Ge leading the charge once again, moving slowly upward. Luo Bingtin positioned herself in the middle. With her psychic guidance and Meng Ge’s experience, the less experienced members would be alright.

As long as they avoided injury, they would eventually gain combat experience. What mattered most was that these young men could differentiate between humans and zombies. They didn’t have the misconception of killing humans; they understood their mission and acted decisively when necessary, which already set them apart from many others.

The door to the fire escape on the third floor was closed. Meng Ge carefully listened to the sounds outside before slowly opening the door just enough to peek through. Luo Bingtin had already mapped out the positions of the zombies and wasn’t worried about him being ambushed.

After scouting the area, Meng Ge opened the fire escape door fully, looking around before waving his hand to signal the others to follow him. This time, Luo Bingtin moved to the back, allowing the excited young men to feel involved.

The sound of eight feet moving in unison was a bit loud, and the zombies picked up the noise, the nearest one—a zombie dressed like a manager with a receding hairline—burst from an office on the left. Its mouth was smeared with dark blood, and it was clawing and gnashing its teeth.

Despite its beer belly, it charged forward swiftly. The fifth brother swung his sword, cleaving half of the zombie’s head off. The blade nearly got stuck in its skull, but he quickly yanked it out, and the Longquan sword sliced through effortlessly, taking the zombie down in seconds.

While executing the strike, the fifth brother let out a shout, and the remaining four zombies reacted, rushing from different offices towards them. He struck again, while the third brother used a chopping motion, Meng Ge kicked a lunging zombie away, and An Min swiftly pierced through its skull with a follow-up strike.

The last one was dispatched by the eighth brother, who beheaded it with a clean slice from the neck. However, even without a body, the head continued to snap its jaws. The eighth brother, disgusted, thrust his sword down through the top of its head, piercing through the skull until the brain was destroyed and the zombie finally lost its aggression.

With this, the team, except for Luo Bingtin, achieved their first zombie kills.

After clearing the entire third-floor office, Luo Bingtin found an office with the door closed. She raised her hand and knocked.

A voice tinged with tears came from inside, “Who is it?”

“It's the drone,” Luo Bingtin replied.

Then she heard the sound of furniture being moved. After a moment, the door finally opened. The girl who had been waving frantically now stood before them, her tear-stained face lighting up in a hopeful smile, looking like an angel come to save them.

With her eyes still watery from crying, she rushed forward to thank Luo Bingtin. Reacting quickly, Luo Bingtin dodged, causing the girl to fall into Meng Ge's arms instead.

The other young men watched the scene with amusement. Fortunately, Meng Ge, with years of experience, steadied the girl and asked about the situation inside.

Luo Bingtin couldn’t help but chuckle at Meng Ge’s serious demeanor, the way his ears subtly turned red as he maintained his composure. She decided not to call him out on it.

Sometimes, it was better to keep things unspoken; friends could continue their roles.

The girl introduced herself as Liu Xiaohui, an employee of the park management office. The zombie outbreak had occurred just before closing time on the afternoon of the twentieth. Some of her colleagues had left early to celebrate Valentine’s Day, leaving her behind since she was single. She had been in the break room, intending to tidy up the tea cups and kettle before leaving when the chaos erupted outside.

She had crouched by the window, witnessing the horror unfold as people were chased down and attacked. A few ran into the office building, but she was too scared to venture outside. She spent her time in the break room listening to the escalating screams of her colleagues, starting with a manager's voice, and then hearing the cries of others until there was silence.
