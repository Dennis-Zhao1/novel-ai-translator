**Just a Quick Recon**

The bodyguard accompanying the young lady off the plane felt a bit bewildered. Throughout this trip abroad, he had been unable to truly collect himself. Could it be that the young lady left her gun back in the Sand Kingdom? 

After smoothly passing through security, that was the only conclusion he could draw.

That was a relief; the weapon was too dangerous. It was better that the young lady protect herself.

If Luo Bingtian could hear the bodyguard's thoughts, she'd probably find it both amusing and frustrating. She absolutely had to keep her space abilities a secret, at least until the arrival of other space users.

The only reason she brought him along without holding back was due to her past life, where this bodyguard had died protecting her.

Such a person, willing to sacrifice everything to keep her safe, was someone Luo Bingtian would never need to guard against. She knew he had been by her side for many years, facing countless threats and temptations without ever wavering. That loyalty was more than enough for her.

Returning to the old mansion, Luo Bingtian shed the weariness that clung to her. This was her true home.

She decided not to go to the company today and instead to stay at the mansion. There were plans to be made, and some of her assets needed to be liquidated. Although she had only been reincarnated for a few days, who knew if her presence as a "Siberian butterfly" would trigger any unexpected changes?

Early preparations were the way to go; only what she held in her hands was truly secure. Everything else was subject to change.

Luo Bingtian had always believed this. She turned down several invitations from friends in the second-generation circle for nightlife, simply stating she needed to adjust to the time difference. She had already cleaned up her sole-owned assets, even recovering a significant sum from the old castle.

In her study, a stack of joint venture assets lay before her, and Luo Bingtian pondered how to inform her family heirlooms—left by her grandfather—without being labeled a lunatic.

It was a headache. After her rebirth, she felt her mental capacity had diminished. She could show off her cleverness in front of the second-generation crowd, but the people she was up against now were like crafty foxes—each one an old fox in their own right. The moment she lifted her tail, they’d know exactly what she intended. If she slipped up, it could lead to major trouble.

Since she couldn't come up with any ideas at the moment, she decided to clear her mind by meditating in her space. During her time on the cargo ship in the Sand Kingdom, while she was busy collecting oil, she had sensed something just before her mental energy ran out. It had been too intense and stressful then for her to focus, but now she wanted to recapture that feeling.

As she meditated, the outside world transitioned into night. The old butler, knowing the young lady was adjusting to the time difference, realized that sleeping too long was not ideal. It could easily lead to a disrupted day-night cycle. After knocking on her door and receiving no response, the old butler felt puzzled.

Suddenly, Luo Bingtian emerged from her space, pretending to come out from the bathroom. The old butler inquired if she needed dinner. Rubbing her stomach, which hadn’t seen much food all day, she nodded and said, “I’d like Aunt Li’s crab soup dumplings.”

The old butler smiled, “Of course! Aunt Li prepared them early and they’re ready whenever you are.”

After changing her clothes, Luo Bingtian headed downstairs just as the crab soup dumplings came out steaming hot.

Delicious! Luo Bingtian thought about how wonderful it would be to pack up the old mansion and all its servants and take them with her.

Her eating slowed as that thought crossed her mind. Maybe… she should find a time to try it?

She quickly dismissed the idea as fanciful and polished off Aunt Li’s crab soup dumplings, truly grateful for them.

After eating, she prepared to head out. First, she found her assistant to arrange a discreet car with unfamiliar license plates. Then, following her memory, she set off toward the location where the Dingjin Wine was exposed.

Dressed in a low-key manner, she changed into a jacket and put on a hat. She also applied a darker foundation on her face, neck, and hands, using makeup skills to make her appearance more ordinary.

This time, she was just scouting the area, assessing the local environment and security to plan her next steps. As the car exited the city and headed toward the western suburbs, she placed her lady’s pistol in the most visible spot in her space for easy access. She had practiced drawing the pistol quickly at the mansion multiple times.

Ideally, she wouldn't have to use the firearm; after all, the apocalypse was only 25 days away. This period wasn’t too long or too short, and if she exposed herself, all her plans would go up in smoke.

With a cautious mindset, Luo Bingtian turned off the car lights two kilometers from her destination, creeping closer at a snail's pace. She parked in the shadow of a hillside about five hundred meters from her target, leaving the car unlocked with the keys removed and the handbrake engaged.

Every step was taken to avoid detection.

Ever since she learned to read energies and enhanced her mental capacity, her senses had sharpened significantly. In this hushed environment, she could feel the flow of air and the sound of the wind to gauge her surroundings. If she could catch any direct sounds, it would be even clearer.

Little did she know, the Fu family had hidden their stash of gold and jewels in an abandoned temple in the suburbs. With no visitors to the temple and the monks gone, it was quite different from those built on hillsides or mountain tops. This small, dilapidated temple only had a single prayer hall and a small courtyard, surrounded by trees and rocks, with the nearest village several miles away. Its abandonment made perfect sense.

It had to be said that Fu was quite adept at hiding; even if someone did come by occasionally, it wouldn’t attract attention. Along the way, there were no surveillance cameras, making it easy and safe to conceal and cover up.

Unfortunately, her energy-reading abilities and mental strength weren’t strong enough; she couldn’t pick up anything from five hundred meters away. She needed to get closer, a lot closer. Moving stealthily through the shadows of the trees, Luo Bingtian was concerned about the bright moonlight revealing her position. 

This time, she was only here to scout, and she truly didn’t want to be exposed.

At a hundred meters away, it took her nearly half an hour to close the distance, testing the effective range of her energy-reading technique.

As she inched forward, channeling her energy-reading ability, she felt a strong intuition urging her to press on just a little further.

But as fate would have it, the moment she stepped out of the shadows of the trees, exposing half her body, she spotted a car speeding toward her from afar. It was completely different from her cautious approach. The other vehicle had its high and low beams on, illuminating the area like it was daytime.

Startled, Luo Bingtian quickly ducked behind a larger tree, using its trunk to shield her form. Fortunately, her slender build helped her remain concealed; otherwise, she would have been completely exposed.

The other car, audaciously playing DJ dance music, created a stark contrast to the quiet of the night. Luo Bingtian’s heart raced faster and faster, her pulse pounding in her chest. It was thrilling—her little heart could hardly take it.

Not daring to peek at who it was, she held her breath, waiting to see who would step out of the vehicle and what their intentions were.

Before long, the driver indeed parked, turned off the music, and got out. Luo Bingtian couldn’t risk peeking out but relied on her mental strength and heightened senses to listen closely to the other person’s actions.

The person opened the trunk and pulled out something heavy, their footsteps shifting from light and rhythmic to heavy and unsteady. It sounded like they pushed open the dilapidated wooden door of the temple, and their breathing became more pronounced.

Only after they entered did Luo Bingtian dare to peek out. Sure enough, the person had gone inside, carrying a black duffel bag that they were gripping tightly.

Luo Bingtian felt a sense of realization. That could only be…

Her thoughts drifted back to her past life, recalling the drunken state of that beast. The environment flooded her with a growing sense of anger.

Suddenly, a loud shout broke the stillness of the night, echoing in the darkness.

“Who’s there?! Come out!”
