**Stirring the Pot**

When Brother Meng’s trained supernatural beings became capable of handling tasks independently, he issued missions allowing them to form teams and venture out to hunt zombies, collect crystal cores, and gather supplies.

In the meantime, the weapons and equipment from Luo Bingtian's space were cleverly concealed and made available for the supernatural teams to exchange for points. 

Brother Meng and Xie Jinghang rarely embarked on missions at the same time, but Luo Bingtian occasionally accompanied one of them to assess the results of their training. The zombies had evolved and upgraded; now the crystal cores submitted for tasks were of at least grade two with attributes. However, ice attribute crystal cores remained exceptionally rare. Despite this, Luo Bingtian's abilities had still advanced, which was hard for others to believe.

One day, after entering her space, she discovered that after a long two-month period, she had finally completed her upgrade. The space now resembled a mystical realm straight out of a fantasy drama, full of enigma and wonder. 

The transformation was subtle at first glance, but upon closer inspection, it was evident. When she looked up at the mirror, she found it had a new skin—a frame that hadn’t existed before, inscribed with two ancient Chinese characters: “Xuan Jing,” which appeared to be the name of the mirror. 

The display screen of the Xuan Jing had significantly widened and enlarged. It still featured the split screen of two sections, but now the sundial display only occupied one-third of the space. The lower two-thirds was a dialogue box, while the upper section remained blank for the time being. The text in the dialogue box read: "Upgrade complete, please explore at your leisure."

With a look of playful disdain, as if to say "you’re just trying to show off," Luo Bingtian turned to survey the state of her entire space. What was once a large area now seemed boundless. The distant small hills had transformed into rolling mountain ranges, lush and green as far as the eye could see. 

She could faintly hear what sounded like the rush of a waterfall. The small pond she had once known had expanded significantly; it should now be called a lake, making the area she had previously marked by the pond feel oddly out of place. 

The wheat seeds she had accidentally scattered had grown into a golden field, the sturdy stalks swaying gently in the breeze, as if silently inviting her to come closer. 

Luo Bingtian touched the heavy wheat heads, deciding to harvest them later when she needed flour—not in a rush. 

Unknown trees in her space had grown taller and sturdier. She attempted to transplant some fruit tree seedlings from the back mountain of their base into the space to see how long it would take for them to bear fruit.

Cattle and sheep had given birth to young ones, and now they were naturally reproducing. Since entering the space, they had been free-ranging. There was still plenty of meat stored, and even the canned meat had not yet been consumed. 

Due to the recent influx of personnel, they had gradually cleared out a large stockpile of eggs and rabbits. This brought immense joy to Luo Bingtian, who once despaired at the sight of numerous baskets of eggs that wouldn’t hatch and the rabbits bouncing around everywhere.

The most significant change, however, was the spiritual energy within the space. After the last upgrade, she had fainted from the overwhelming energy, but upon re-entering this time, she felt no discomfort. 

Instead, the energy flowed through her body, bringing a warm sensation as if a gentle hand caressed every inch of her meridians, soothing her entirely. Her mental strength quickly recovered, meaning she could freely expend her supernatural powers in the space, becoming a perpetual motion machine. The effects of her training were remarkable, and she became more adept at utilizing her abilities. Without realizing it, her mental power had surged to level three, and she had even developed a unique set of skills for releasing her ice powers through intense exploration, mimicking the attack style of traditional hidden weapons known as "Rain of Pear Blossom Needles," resulting in her own supernatural version: "Rain of Ice Needles."

If ice spikes were single-target damage, then the Rain of Ice Needles represented area damage. With greater mental power, the ice needles became as hard as steel, covering a larger area. Once melted, they left no trace, allowing her to strike without being noticed—much like the damage effect of a shotgun.

She also experimented with dual-handed techniques, using one hand for attack and the other for defense, forming an icy armor to withstand incoming supernatural attacks. This was sufficient against ordinary supernatural abilities, but when facing equally ranked mutated abilities, she needed to either attack proactively or evade their skills.

Without many ice attribute crystal cores to assist her, she had opened a new line of thought through the enhancement of her mental power. Perhaps ordinary people had the potential to become supernatural beings too?

Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of the apocalypse fortress transformed what was once an idyllic sanctuary into a battleground for resources against other bases, naturally attracting many unsavory characters with various schemes.

Luo Bingtian no longer feared these plots and schemes; in fact, she welcomed an opportunity for conflict. The enemies embedded within the fortress as spies and pests needed a chance to be uprooted.

Upon returning to the apocalypse fortress, Xie Jinghang brought back news that the eldest son of Fu Buqi from the Kunshan base had finally recovered and was preparing to hold an engagement banquet, inviting many leaders and strong supernatural beings from other bases to attend. Invitations had already been sent out.

This engagement ceremony was exceptionally ostentatious—not merely a celebration of his engagement but also a means to bolster his own influence and power. Given the previous entanglements with the Kunshan base, it was unlikely the apocalypse fortress would receive an invitation. It was possible that this engagement banquet could incite other bases to form an alliance and jointly attack the apocalypse fortress.

Hearing this, Luo Bingtian lowered her gaze, a cold smile playing on her lips. She wondered which poor soul was fated to marry that scoundrel Fu Dingjin this time around—most likely another daughter of a powerful family, as Fu Buqi was always in pursuit of power and status, just like in her previous life.

After pondering for a moment, Luo Bingtian raised her eyes to Xie Jinghang and said, “This engagement banquet hosted by Kunshan base might not be as straightforward as it seems. What do you think? Should we stir up some trouble?”

Xie Jinghang had already considered this; he just wanted to confirm Luo Bingtian's thoughts. He nodded and said, “Stirring up trouble is definitely on the agenda.”

“Great! How about we take advantage of the chaos and launch a surprise attack?” 

Xie Jinghang was also infected by Luo Bingtian's mischievous grin, and they began to finalize their action plan and details. 

They decided to leave Brother Meng to hold down the fort while Uncle Zhu and Liu Xiaohui assisted in maintaining the daily operations of the fortress. Under the pretense of going out to collect crystal cores, the two led a team out in broad daylight.

From the moment they set out, they noticed undisguised spies from unknown forces tailing them. After several attempts to shake them off using zombies, they finally managed to lose their pursuers. Midway, they coordinated with their team, assigning the vice-captain to lead the others in collecting crystal cores. Luo Bingtian planned to sneak into the Kunshan base alone, and Xie Jinghang had the same intention. They seemed to leave the team together but separated again midway.

After disguising herself, Luo Bingtian climbed into the oldest, beat-up little van in her space, filling the cargo area with some near-expired supplies, purposefully making herself look shabby as she headed toward the Kunshan base.

Originally, the Kunshan base only accepted supernatural beings, and it was unthinkable for ordinary people to join. However, the apocalypse fortress had cleverly adapted the rule to allow supernatural beings to bring along two ordinary people, which led to many supernatural beings who had previously joined or were planning to join Kunshan base switching their allegiance to the apocalypse fortress. After all, everyone had a few non-supernatural relatives, and for the sake of staying together and ensuring their families' safety, they knew how to choose.

This instantly changed the entire dynamic. As Kunshan base found its ranks of supernatural beings dwindling, their advantage in power gradually faded. Naturally, they would try desperately to regain their standing.

Not only was Kunshan base affected, but other bases also experienced some loss of supernatural beings, though not to the extent of threatening their core power. They wouldn’t engage the rapidly growing apocalypse fortress just because of this.

Now, they could only open their doors to accept ordinary people into Kunshan base to entice supernatural beings to stay; otherwise, they would face an exodus.

When Luo Bingtian, looking worn and weary, arrived at the gates of Kunshan base in her little van, there were less than three days left until the engagement ceremony. She needed to gather all the information about Kunshan base within these three days to set everything up before the ceremony.

Being a military district, Kunshan base exuded a sense of reliability with its familiar towering walls and strict guards. Today happened to be the second day they were allowing ordinary people to enter, and there were many seeking refuge at Kunshan base, both supernatural beings and ordinary folks; the queue for ordinary people’s entry was particularly long.

After an hour and a half of stop-and-go traffic, it finally came time for her turn. 

Clutching Liu Xiaohui’s identification, she had intentionally altered her appearance to closely resemble Liu Xiaohui's features. When the guards checked her ID, they scrutinized it carefully and asked her questions beyond the information on the ID.

Fortunately, Luo Bingtian had communicated with Liu Xiaohui before departing and was familiar with many details about her life and work, allowing her to answer smoothly. Knowing that the guards often expected some form of bribe, she discreetly slipped two packs of cigarettes and a chocolate bar into their hands.

These items were scarce commodities in the apocalypse. The guards noticed her savvy approach, clearing their throats quickly as they stuffed the items into their pockets, handing her a pass and waving her through.

Just then, a female voice rang out: “Wait a moment!”

Luo Bingtian turned toward the sound, her pupils narrowing in shock. 

“It’s her!”
