**The Parasites of the Zhu Family**

Uncertain of the other person's intentions, Luo Bingting felt a swirl of emotions as she returned to her room. She paced the corridor for a long time before finally knocking on Xie Jinghang's door.

Xie Jinghang had already settled in for the night, but upon hearing the knock, he got up, dressed, and opened the door. He found Luo Bingting standing there, looking a bit dazed.

With the sharp instincts of a soldier, he sensed that he should let her in.

He poured a cup of hot water and handed it to her to help warm her hands, his voice unconsciously softening. “Miss Luo, what’s the matter?”

Luo Bingting looked up, her expression serious. “How much do you know about the Kunshan Base?”

“There’s a lot of information regarding the Kunshan Base. What specifically do you want to know?” Xie Jinghang replied, slightly surprised. If this was just idle gossip, she wouldn’t come knocking on his door at this hour.

“I’m not sure... perhaps...” Luo Bingting’s gaze locked onto Xie Jinghang’s. “Can you tell me about the material reserves at Kunshan Base?”

Xie Jinghang was momentarily stumped by the question. It wasn’t that he didn’t know the answer; he had a rough idea of the quantity. It was just that he couldn’t fathom why she was asking this—what significance did it hold for her?

As he contemplated how to respond appropriately, Luo Bingting pressed on. “Do you think the heavy snowfall could affect the normal operations of Kunshan Base?”

Xie Jinghang fell silent for a moment, long enough for Luo Bingting to feel that the cup in her hands was growing cooler.

“I don’t think it would be a significant issue. The Kunshan Base is quite capable. Besides the military support, they stockpiled extensively when the apocalypse first began. With what our team brought back, they could sustain everyone at the Kunshan Base for two years without a problem,” he stated confidently.

Luo Bingting set down the cup, contemplating with her chin in her hand.

Xie Jinghang didn’t disturb her thoughts. Instead, he finished the water in her cup, confirming that it had indeed gone cold.

“Perhaps you could consult with me, after all, I’m currently your subordinate,” he joked lightly, a smile playing on his lips.

What troubled Luo Bingting was precisely that—ever since Xie Jinghang had entered the apocalypse fortress, he hadn’t been on any missions. Observing him, she noted he hadn’t contacted anyone outside either. Even when he had handed over that USB drive for the Kunshan Base, the only thing found on it was evidence of Fu Dingjin’s wrongdoing—no hidden folders or malicious software in sight.

In her eyes, Xie Jinghang was clean.

Yet the betrayal she experienced in her past life made it difficult for her to trust anyone completely, not even the elderly members of the Luo family she’d brought along.

After a moment’s hesitation, Luo Bingting finally voiced her concerns. “I suspect there may be spies from the Kunshan Base within the apocalypse fortress.”

Xie Jinghang wasn’t surprised; the Kunshan Base was rife with complex factions, all intertwined, vying against each other.

Luo Bingting observed his calm demeanor, his pupils showing no sign of alarm, and continued, “If they’re not after the materials, then what could they want?”

Xie Jinghang pondered this question too. But as Luo Bingting’s eyes met his once more, they both spoke in unison: “The antidote for the zombie virus!”

Indeed, besides that, what else would the Kunshan Base covet from the apocalypse fortress? Perhaps there were also Zhu Dabo and his research team. It was only within the apocalypse fortress that no one would barter scientific achievements for power and profit.

But now, things were no longer certain.

Luo Bingting hurriedly checked her side, spending two days confirming that there were no spies among her people—at least none from the Kunshan Base.

Once again, it came back to the Zhu family. Luo Bingting felt a pang of resignation. The last time Grandfather Zhu had imposed a punishment, he did so with great care, showing how seriously he viewed his family, whether direct descendants or branches. Given the situation, she could only prioritize precaution.

As the saying goes, “There are thieves for a thousand days, but there’s no such thing as a thief-proof plan.” After much discussion, Luo Bingting and Xie Jinghang decided to confide in Zhu Xiaoshu.

He was a young man, resourceful and intelligent, not easily swayed by the weight of family ties and capable of distinguishing right from wrong.

Finding an excuse, she invited Zhu Xiaoshu to Xie Jinghang’s room, carefully extending her mental energy to prevent eavesdropping.

Once he heard the beginning of their conversation, Zhu Xiaoshu quickly connected the dots, aligning with Luo Bingting’s suspicions. He too believed that Kunshan Base was primarily interested in the antidote.

However, it was unclear how they would go about obtaining it, but it was evident their methods wouldn’t be straightforward.

There were just too many parasites in the Zhu family, already starting to eat away at their foundation. Zhu Xiaoshu felt a pressing urgency that matched Luo Bingting’s concerns.

This matter couldn’t be publicized; Zhu Xiaoshu needed to act quickly, to root out the parasites before they caused irreparable damage.

Before leaving, as if understanding why Luo Bingting had only shared this with him, he ruffled the girl’s hair and reassured her, “Don’t worry, your uncle’s here.”

Luo Bingting nodded. After Zhu Xiaoshu left, she lingered in Xie Jinghang’s room for a while longer.

Xie Jinghang was puzzled by her reaction. With the most capable member of the Zhu family on the case, the parasites would be dealt with swiftly, so what was she so anxious about?

Luo Bingting wasn’t just worried about this issue; she couldn’t share with Xie Jinghang her fears of the unknown future and the impending disaster that she knew was coming, yet couldn’t pinpoint when it would strike.

Human evolution was unstoppable, and they had to find a way to halt the zombies' advancement.

The day before the Spring Festival, Grandfather Zhu had organized a gathering for everyone to celebrate New Year’s Eve together. Outside, the world was blanketed in white, and the children were busy cutting paper for window decorations, the red paper dyed with red radish greens.

Grandfather Zhu and Old Man Zheng each wrote a few couplets, directing their sons to paste them on the doors.

Luo Bingting stood beside Aunt Li, watching her wrap dumplings, her heart set on the crab meat soup dumplings.

Meng Ge had led a group of young men back from the back mountain with firewood, competing to see who could chop the best.

A few months prior, Zhu Xiaoshu had quietly informed Luo Bingting that they had caught the parasites—specifically, the sons of the two scoundrels from the fifth branch who had previously offended her.

Taking advantage of the outer perimeter's patrol, they intentionally lagged behind and colluded with individuals from the Kunshan Base, leaking information about the antidote.

However, these individuals weren’t part of the Zhu family’s power center, so they didn’t possess much knowledge.

As for Kunshan Base’s plans, after several days of interrogation, they hadn’t divulged anything, indicating they genuinely knew nothing.

That family had already been secretly sent out of the apocalypse fortress and detained elsewhere by Zhu Xiaoshu.

Seeing Zhu Xiaoshu’s confident demeanor, Luo Bingting felt satisfied with how the matter was resolved. Grandfather Zhu’s health was declining, and it was better not to burden him with such troubles.

Turning back to see the two old men comparing their calligraphy, each refusing to yield to the other in a childish manner, she felt a warmth in her heart.

As Luo Bingting noted the dumplings were boiling, she wanted to ask when they would be done enough to taste, when suddenly the ground shook, followed by a deafening explosion.

The vibrations shook the snow off the rooftops and trees.

Luo Bingting and the others rushed outside, fearing a landslide or avalanche.

To their shock, the continuous explosions were coming from the only checkpoint in and out of the apocalypse fortress.

Then came the shrill sound of alarms, frantic shouts from children, and women calling for their kids, while adults raised weapons and rushed towards the checkpoint.

Luo Bingting joined the crowd, sprinting alongside Xie Jinghang. Meng Ge and his gang of young men had already driven ahead toward the checkpoint.

“It’s an attack from the Kunshan Base!” 

Those six words hit Luo Bingting’s heart like a heavy hammer.
