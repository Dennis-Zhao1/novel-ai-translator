**The Emergence of the Crystal Core**

Before long, Uncle Zhu had reorganized the assignments for the abilities users. Just before the announcement, Luo Bingtin, Uncle Zhu, and Grandpa Zhu held a meeting. This time, Luo Bingtin had set aside her usual laissez-faire attitude and took a firm stance on several key positions, making it clear that she was determined to have them.

Uncle Zhu and Grandpa Zhu had no objections; they understood the reasons behind her assertiveness. Luo Bingtin preferred to work with intelligent people, and this adjustment in positions sent a strong signal: the internal strife within the Zhu family was inevitable, and they needed to prepare early.

They then invited Uncle Zhu and Dr. Zhang from the laboratory. The focus of their research shifted from preventing the transformation from being bitten to developing enhancement potions for abilities users. Only by rapidly boosting the capabilities of the abilities users could they gain the upper hand and tackle the zombie threat effectively.

Uncle Zhu organized another all-hands meeting, where he announced the adjustments in the fortress's positions and personnel distribution in the training field. Luo Bingtin got the positions she wanted, and while she was pleased, the others were far from happy.

Watching several side branches attempting to leverage their seniority to morally pressure Luo Bingtin with comments like how a young girl shouldn't hold such important positions due to her perceived lack of competence, they couldn't help but sneer inwardly. Did they really think they could manipulate her as easily as before?

Unexpectedly, Luo Bingtin raised her hand, and an ice spike grazed the cheeks of a few individuals before embedding itself into the wall behind them. With this display of power, she made it clear that in the world of abilities users, empty words wouldn't help. Her actions demonstrated that she was no longer the bullied orphan; her strength was formidable.

Moreover, she wasn’t alone; her team included several other abilities users. If not now, when would she be assertive? Would she wait until others were riding on her back?

This display stunned everyone into silence. After all, their own abilities were barely effective; they couldn’t even manage a proper attack, let alone kill anyone. Having endured for so long, Luo Bingtin finally felt a sense of relief and empowerment. Spring had finally arrived.

Despite the rising temperatures, it didn’t feel warm. The melting snow turned into small streams, making it feel colder than the snowy days just passed. While abilities users were relatively fine, ordinary people were struggling with the cold and showing symptoms of colds. Fortunately, they had ample supplies of medicine.

However, Grandpa Zhu's condition was deteriorating. The healing abilities user, Second Brother Zhu, paused his research to come and treat the old man, but unfortunately, the results were minimal.

Luo Bingtin secured three key positions: the security captain of the patrol team, which would be held by Xie Jinghang; the head of the checkpoint, which she took on herself; and the military supplies manager, who would be Meng Ge. He was the only one with metal abilities and his control over metals was well-known, making him the perfect fit for the role.

The Zheng family members each took positions alongside them. Luo Bingtin chose Anmin, whose wind abilities were suitable for long-range attacks, perfectly complementing her ice abilities for a combination effect that exceeded the sum of their parts. Anmin's father joined Xie Jinghang, using his earth abilities to patch up breaches in the walls during patrols. Auntie Zheng teamed up with Meng Ge, bringing her meticulousness and steadiness to the table.

Once the arrangements were complete, they officially took their posts and began adapting to the new rules, gaining more initiative.

Uncle Zhu continued to oversee the fortress's overall operations. Due to Grandpa Zhu's health issues, he readily transferred the authority of the checkpoint to Luo Bingtin, including the keys to the armory. Zhu Yidan was also assigned to the checkpoint to manage a different shift of guards alongside Luo Bingtin.

The rate of zombie mutations was accelerating. Just as the snow at the foot of the mountain began to thaw, the grass hadn’t even started to grow when zombies started to wander around the apocalypse fortress. This was quickly reported by both the checkpoint and the patrol team.

Except for Xie Jinghang, everyone else seemed eager for action. The zombies were practically delivering themselves as practice targets for their abilities—how considerate! Xie Jinghang, having had enough of killing zombies in his past life, wasn’t particularly interested.

He led the team on patrol, using the opportunity to hone their skills and increase their proficiency with their abilities. Fighting against zombie abilities users was an entirely different challenge compared to regular zombies. The former were faster and, many had awakened abilities, making them considerably more formidable.

For instance, the wind abilities user zombie before them moved more than twice as fast as the average zombie, nearly clawing at a team member's face. Anmin and the team members coordinated to clear the zombies around the fortress. Xie Jinghang stayed back, directing the operation and suddenly pulled out a dagger, plunging it into a zombie’s head.

The sight was a bit unsettling for the team; the remnants were indeed unsightly. They initially thought their captain was merely ensuring the zombie was thoroughly dead, but to their surprise, he pulled out a pearl-like object from the mess of red and white brain matter.

He called over a water abilities team member to wash off the grime and held it up to check the light. It was a grayish-white translucent crystal, roughly the size of a thumb, a low-level crystal core with no attributes.

Xie Jinghang tossed it to a curious teammate and then bent down to extract another zombie's head.

The team immediately began asking, “Captain, what is this thing?”

“It’s a crystal core. It can enhance abilities and replenish energy,” he explained, digging out another one. The water abilities user eagerly stepped in to wash it off.

This one looked even better—red. Xie Jinghang tossed it to the fire abilities user. “Here, try to absorb it.”

The fire user was taken aback. “How do I absorb it?” 

Xie Jinghang took the first translucent crystal core and held it in his palm, closing his eyes briefly. When he opened his hand, the core had turned into a small pile of gray-white powder.

The amazed team members watched intently, and the fire user, imitating his captain, held the fire crystal core tightly, concentrated, and after a short while, successfully absorbed it. His eyes brightened as he felt a strange, indescribable energy swell within him.

No need for Xie Jinghang to prompt further; others began digging into the zombies’ heads too, no longer caring about the disgusting task. Xie Jinghang shook his head, crossing his arms as he stood on a hill, feeling a slight sense of worry.

At the fortress's main checkpoint, Luo Bingtin, Meng Ge, Anmin, Auntie Zheng, and the newly assigned abilities users were busy slaying zombies. The changes in the magnetic field had increased the zombies' mobility—what used to be a relatively safe area was now teeming with them.

Anmin, following closely behind her, had improved his wind abilities significantly under the guidance of Luo Bingtin and Xie Jinghang. His wind blades now had the cutting power of a knife and were effective at range. He found it much more exhilarating than close combat with a sword, but in his excitement, he overexerted himself and soon felt drained.

Luo Bingtin advised him to step back and rest while she continued attacking with ice spikes at incredible speed. She felt that using three ice spikes to kill one zombie was a bit wasteful; it would be much more efficient if she could hit three zombies simultaneously.

As this thought crossed her mind, she intended to ask Xie Jinghang about its feasibility later. 

People shouldn’t be thought about too loudly; just as she thought of him, Xie Jinghang appeared, jumping off a vehicle to join the fray. Luo Bingtin raised an eyebrow in greeting while continuing to clear the zombies.

The team from the Zhu family was quite large, with each member possessing different mental strengths and abilities. Some, like Anmin, had quickly exhausted their energy and retreated to rest. 

Seeing Xie Jinghang arrive with reinforcements, Luo Bingtin waved for her team to fall back, knowing they wouldn’t be able to contribute much just standing around. Xie Jinghang quickly grasped her intent. Once everyone was back, they efficiently finished off the last few zombies, and the team members excitedly rushed to dig for more crystal cores.

This scene left Anmin and Meng Ge in shock, Anmin nearly gasping in disbelief. What kind of bizarre obsession did Xie Jinghang's teammates have? Had they lost their minds?

After collecting everything and discarding a few zombies without cores, they washed them off and counted over a dozen cores. 

Having never seen crystal cores before, Meng Ge and Anmin marveled at them, while Xie Jinghang handed all of them to Luo Bingtin. 

The meaning was clear: Luo Bingtin was now their boss, and it was best for her to manage them, whether she chose to keep them or distribute them.

The others had no objections. Luo Bingtin raised an eyebrow and glanced back toward the fortress gate, exchanging knowing looks with her team. 

With a smile, she accepted the crystal cores and stashed them away in her spatial storage.
