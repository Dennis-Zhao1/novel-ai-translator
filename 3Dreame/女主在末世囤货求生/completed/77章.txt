**Killing and Robbery**

In the apocalypse, those with power and wealth still seek to maintain their superior status, gathering to revel in their dominance over others, wielding authority and force to manipulate and toy with the weak. 

At this moment, the baseness of human nature is laid bare, exposing the dark and brutal aspects of humanity in stark relief, amplified exponentially. 

Exotic ingredients that one would never encounter outside are laid out in a lavish buffet, and expensive drinks flow freely, creating an illusion that the apocalypse is, in fact, their true paradise. 

Within the crowd, Luo Bingtin recognizes a few familiar faces, but many more are strangers. Given Fu Buqi's personality, he wouldn’t associate with anyone lacking strength or usefulness. 

Thus, the people here are not to be trusted. 

Among the women present, several were captured earlier in the afternoon, now subjected to the lewd amusement of men, their screams echoing in the air. 

One by one, they are tied to chairs, clad only in dresses that barely conceal their bodies, while men shamelessly groped and abused them with disgusting tactics. 

Other women laugh and flirt, trying to curry favor with the men, some unable to control themselves as they drag the captured women upstairs by their hair. 

Luo Bingtin sets her glass down on the windowsill and seeks out a secluded spot around the outer perimeter of the main building. There, she discreetly places mini explosives—some in trash bins, some in the corners of curtains, and others beneath cabinets. 

Circling the outer perimeter of the villa, she watches as the group inside continues to indulge in their cruel game with the women, laughing and cheering all the while. 

She genuinely hopes that soon, an explosion would wipe those smiles off their faces. 

In another corner, Luo Bingtin stealthily injects a sedative into the decanter of red wine designated for serving. 

Hearing that this wine is to be sent upstairs, she suspects it is likely intended for Fu Buqi and his entourage. 

"Drink up, the more the better." 

When she sees a servant carrying the decanter and empty glasses away, Luo Bingtin follows quietly behind. 

At the top of the stairs, two bodyguards in black block the way, forcing her to halt her steps and blend back into the noisy crowd, waiting for the perfect moment. 

As expected, the group has begun dousing the women with wine, tearing their clothes and creating a scene that is nothing short of grotesque, with cheers echoing around them. 

A flame of fury burns in Luo Bingtin’s eyes, yet her mind remains clear and rational. 

Not long after she joins the crowd, an old man approaches her, wrapping his arms around her waist with filthy hands and a foul mouth. Luo Bingtin instinctively considers throwing him out with a shoulder throw but refrains upon noticing the bodyguards upstairs. Instead, she plays the part of a seductive vixen. 

Whispering sweet nothings into the old man’s ear, he beams with delight, guiding her upstairs without a second thought. 

The bodyguards attempt to stop them, but the old man removes his mask, glaring menacingly, and they back off, allowing them to pass. 

So, this old man holds a decent position? Even better, Luo Bingtin thinks. 

She quickens her pace, following him into an empty room upstairs. Seizing the opportunity, she swiftly slits his throat, the man collapsing to the floor as blood pours out. She hides her knife away. 

Quickly slipping into flat shoes, Luo Bingtin expands her senses across the entire second floor. Many rooms contain people, but all are pairs. 

Strange—where is Fu Buqi? 

Given the earlier situation, he should be resolving conflicts with Zhang Ye and the others. 

Suddenly recalling the young ruffians who had been snatching women earlier in the afternoon were also absent from the first floor, Luo Bingtin realizes she’s pursued the wrong target and decides to push the door open and continue searching. 

The main building is a three-and-a-half-story villa. As she exits and steps into the corridor, she senses two people approaching. Going downstairs where the bodyguards are stationed would be inconvenient, and she has no time to return to the previous room. Spotting the approaching figures, she quickly heads towards the stairs to the third floor. 

It’s a bit tricky to handle two people in the corridor without making noise; it’s better to avoid them altogether. 

The third floor is eerily quiet, and her senses confirm there’s no one there. 

Where could Fu Buqi's group have gone? Lost in thought, she hears footsteps ascending to the third floor. 

With no choice, Luo Bingtin hastily finds a room to hide in, deliberately leaving the door ajar as if the room is unoccupied. 

“Second Young Master, Fu Ye is in quite a bad mood today,” a voice murmurs outside the door, walking past and into the adjacent room. 

“Where is Father now?” 

A gloomy male voice inquires. 

Luo Bingtin raises an eyebrow, surprised to learn that Fu Buqi has a younger son? How had she never heard of him in her previous life? 

“Fu Ye and Zhang Ye went to confront Young Master Zhang. They said Young Master Zhang snatched the woman chosen by Zhang Ye this afternoon.” 

“Zhang Minghui has little else to boast about, ha ha.” 

The Second Young Master sneers, then continues, “Zhang Ye will definitely want to have a good showdown with Father. What conditions do you think he’ll propose?” 

“I’m not sure, but the Zhang family daring to stir up trouble must have ulterior motives.” 

“What other motives could there be? They probably just want to see Zhang Ye and Father fall out.” 

“True, I’ve heard that Zhang Ye has a lot of supplies hidden away.” 

“Yeah, most of the supplies in the warehouse on the west side are provided by Zhang Ye. The Zhang family is really something; Father is going to have a headache over this.” 

The Second Young Master chuckles maliciously, appearing to revel in the drama. 

“Let’s go find Father; we missed the excitement this afternoon, but I can’t miss tonight’s show. My dear older brother is still recovering from a gunshot wound and can’t get out of bed. I might have to step in to mediate.” 

With that, he leaves with his companions. 

Luo Bingtin gathers a wealth of information from their conversation. Not only does Fu Buqi have to watch out for internal strife, but someone is also laying traps for him—how delightful. Most importantly, there are supplies in the west side warehouse? 

Once she confirms that the third floor is empty, Luo Bingtin sneaks back down to the second floor. Instead of exiting through the staircase, she searches for a shadowy window to climb down. 

Navigating cautiously to avoid detection, she discovers that the west side warehouse is not a traditional warehouse at all; it’s another villa with heavy security outside, leaving her momentarily perplexed. 

After a quick mental calculation, she pulls out the detonator for the explosives. 

The dynamite she purchased in the Sand Country is small but packs a punch; a single charge can blow through a wall without issue. She had just placed several charges earlier, strategically around the outer perimeter of the main building. While it’s uncertain if they will hit anyone, the noise will surely be deafening. 

Watching as the guards change shifts, Luo Bingtin decisively presses the detonator. 

With a massive explosion, the main building erupts in chaos, screams and shouts filling the air. 

Hidden in the shadows, she observes as the transitioning guards quickly pull out walkie-talkies to communicate. 

Not receiving any response, the guard captain orders most of the team to rush to the main building for support, leaving only two behind. 

Luo Bingtin has already crept to the window beside the warehouse’s outer wall. Just as she attempts to push the window open, she discovers it is sealed shut—no surprise since a warehouse wouldn’t need windows. 

Her only option is through the front door. With a swift movement, she dashes out from her hiding spot, quickly taking down the two guards with headshots, collecting their weapons and stashing them away, then dragging the bodies into the shadows to avoid detection. 

Once the area is clear and finding no keys on the guards, it doesn’t hinder her from opening the door. With a swift slash from her blade, she cuts through any metal that obstructs her way and strides confidently inside. 

Since the windows are sealed, she has no fear of being seen from outside. Holding a flashlight, she shines it around the three-story villa, which turns out to be a shell of a building, completely bare except for essential support pillars. The total floor area exceeds nine hundred square feet, filled to the brim with supplies. 

Each floor is stacked high with boxes, reaching the ceiling. Upon closer inspection, the first floor consists mainly of food—canned goods, energy bars, instant noodles, and grains. 

Ascending to the second floor, she finds food occupying half the space, along with medical supplies, syringes, and daily necessities. 

On the third floor, she discovers various disaster prevention and epidemic control supplies: protective suits, masks, disinfectants, gloves, tents, kayaks, and life vests among them. 

It’s a veritable treasure trove, fully stocked and abundant. 

What more could she ask for? Luo Bingtin meticulously gathers everything, leaving not a single cardboard box behind. 

Still feeling like something is missing, she retrieves two barrels of gasoline from her storage, pouring it onto each floor before placing mini explosives. 

With a flourish, she exits. As soon as she reaches a secluded area, she presses the detonator again. With another explosion, the west-side warehouse goes up in flames, lighting up the night sky. 

Though the shell has little to burn, the sealed windows are made entirely of wooden boards, and Luo Bingtin seals the door on her way out. By the time the guards return to extinguish the fire, it will be far too late.
