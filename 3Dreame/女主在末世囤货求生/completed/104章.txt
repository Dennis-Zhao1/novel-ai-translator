Celebration Feast

Despite the heavy ammunition expenditure during the zombie siege, they had managed to collect a massive haul of crystal cores. In the past, they would stuff them into cloth bags, but now they needed boxes to hold them all.

Looking at the several boxes filled to the brim with crystal cores of various attributes, their colors shimmering and reflecting a kaleidoscope of light, it was hard not to admire their beauty—if one could ignore where they came from.

Women had always been drawn to shiny things, and Luo Bingtian was no exception. The laboratory had taken several zombie bodies for research, and she had specifically chosen those with mutated abilities. She was eager for them to make progress; this zombie siege had made it clear that having more ability users was better.

Once all the zombie bodies were cleared away, the incinerator could finally take a break. The smoke it produced sometimes drifted towards the fortress, only to be redirected by An Min's wind abilities. At times, when the fire didn’t seem strong enough, he would fan the flames, making the most of his wind powers. Anyone who witnessed it couldn’t help but be impressed by the young man's skills.

The ashes produced were gathered by the farming team for compost, mixed with organic fertilizers. They wondered if the crops would taste even better this way. 

Three uses for one corpse—impressive indeed.

After the battle, there was naturally a ceremony to commend the heroes. Not only the ability users but also the guards had contributed significantly, fighting side by side without a moment's rest.

Uncle Zhu opened the proceedings as usual, and when it was Luo Bingtian's turn to speak, she hadn’t prepared a speech. She thought she’d just express her feelings as she went up. Her gaze fell on the crowd, landing on Xie Jinghang, who was grinning at her. His smile reminded her of an embarrassing moment, and she found herself at a loss for words.

It was Meng Ge who saved the day, clapping and stirring up the mood.

Luo Bingtian shot a glare at the grinning Xie Jinghang, then turned her attention away and began, “I’m not great with grand speeches. You all saw the scenes from the zombie siege on video. All the ability users, guards, and even the ordinary folks put in tremendous effort for this victory. Everyone fought tooth and nail to protect the fortress, to safeguard our home. Today isn’t just a celebration; it’s also a thank you. Thank you to all who fought bravely, to everyone who followed orders and worked together, and most importantly, thank you to ourselves for striving to survive.”

She then gestured for Meng Ge and the others to bring the boxes of crystal cores up on stage. Pointing at the boxes, she continued with a smile, “The zombie siege wasn’t entirely a bad thing. Look at all the crystal cores we’ve gained! Today, after deducting the cores reported by the ability users based on their participation, we’ll divide the rest of these cores equally. Meng Ge and Xiao Hui will be in charge of recording the consumption data of the ability users. After that, we’ll distribute them based on attributes. Any unbalanced cores will be converted into points. If the crystal cores aren’t needed by the guards, they can also be exchanged for points. However, I suggest keeping one or two as a badge of honor for this victory.”

As her words concluded, applause and cheers erupted from the crowd. Guards and ability users stood together, basking in the glory of their achievements. In that moment, they felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude and relief for being part of the End Times Fortress, where they could protect their families and the safety of their home.

Even a squad member who had planned to anonymously report a fellow soldier’s lapse during the battle had abandoned that thought, embracing their captain and shedding tears of happiness.

“Captain, I won't report that you were dazed during the fight! I’m just so excited and moved!” they exclaimed.

Inside, the captain thought, “Damn it, you little brat; you’re toast.”

Uncle Zhu had originally arranged for representatives from the ability users and the guard captain to speak, but seeing the crowd laughing and crying in a joyful mess, he decided to skip that and jump straight to the feast.

Of course, the fortress's signature dish—three ways to eat rabbit—was a must. In the cafeteria, ability users, guards, and ordinary folks mixed freely, sharing tables together. They started with cold dishes, munching on spicy rabbit heads and savoring stir-fried rabbit chunks, relishing the simple pleasures of life.

This time, Aunt Li and the others showcased their culinary skills, serving up all their best dishes, impressing everyone. The old steward looked at the young lady being toasted by various guests, wiping away a tear from his eye, and raised his glass in a toast to Aunt Li and the somewhat unfamiliar guests at the table.

Luo Bingtian found herself cornered at the main table, where an endless stream of guests came to pay their respects with toasts. She was genuinely grateful, not just for herself but for the main table’s core members, all of whom were being toasted in turn.

After several rounds of drinks, she felt a bit dazed at the sight of the approaching army of toasters. Just as she hesitated, wanting to accept a drink, a long hand next to her snatched it away. The crowd began to cheer, “Double for the Black Knight!” Xie Jinghang did not refuse, downing the drink easily. Luo Bingtian felt a warm rush to her face, her eyes slightly burning with heat.

Luckily, Meng Ge and An Min, laughing, managed to divert the toasters away. After downing his drink, Xie Jinghang said nothing and returned to his seat. Gradually, the toasters became less frequent, and the atmosphere lightened as everyone drank and joked around. Some even playfully challenged each other with fistfights, filling the room with laughter and commotion.

When it was Luo Bingtian’s turn again, she found herself surrounded by toasts of beer, white liquor, red wine, and foreign spirits—anything went. They had a wide variety of drinks, so it wasn’t a problem at all. But when a younger guy filled a glass to the brim with cooking wine, she couldn’t help but wonder what he was thinking. Was cooking wine really that intoxicating?

The younger guy, now being pulled away by others, shouted, “Luo, boss, goddess, cheers!” 

Luo Bingtian facepalmed, realizing just how strong the cooking wine was.

Meng Ge, with an arm slung over Xie Jinghang’s shoulder, was in high spirits, reminiscing about how he had watched the once soft, innocent princess transform into the queen of the End Times Fortress, his heart swelling with pride. As he spoke, he nearly teared up.

Xie Jinghang could only sigh helplessly; Meng Ge’s golden abilities seemed to have intensified his grip, making it impossible to escape.

The guards were surrounded by their families, children looking up at them in admiration, relatives filled with pride and joy. The atmosphere among the ability users was markedly different; where one side was warm and cozy, the other was chaotic and silly.

Just as Xie Jinghang finally managed to pry himself away from Meng Ge, An Min plopped down next to him, insisting on sharing a drink. As Luo Bingtian finally sat down to enjoy some food, she couldn’t help but notice An Min tugging on Xie Jinghang, crying out, “Xie Ge, let’s toast! If you don’t drink, I’ll throw a fit!” She secretly regretted not just sticking to some soda; after all, who said a celebration feast had to involve alcohol?

Zhu Yidan, allergic to alcohol, didn’t participate at all. After eating, she took the lead in returning to their post. With people getting this drunk, they wouldn’t even notice if the enemy invaded.

Feeling a bit tipsy herself, Luo Bingtian quickly organized the sober ones to help those who were out cold, sending them back. Those who couldn’t walk were left to lounge in the cafeteria, as long as they didn’t choke on their own vomit, everything else was secondary.

After assigning tasks, she shook her head to clear the dizziness and headed outside. Liu Xiaohui, who hadn’t had any drinks, came over to help her, but she declined, insisting Liu check on Meng Ge, who was sobbing into a pillar, calling out to his buddy Xie.

Liu Xiaohui had never seen anything like this and hurried back to pull Meng Ge away. Turning back, she saw Xie Jinghang supporting the swaying Luo Bingtian as they made their way out. That eased her worries, and she went back to deal with her boyfriend, who was still clinging to the pillar.

Inside Liu Xiaohui’s mind, she thought, “A tough guy who doesn’t shed a tear in the face of danger turns into a blubbering mess after a few drinks. What a sight.”

But what could she do? She couldn’t just abandon her boyfriend.
