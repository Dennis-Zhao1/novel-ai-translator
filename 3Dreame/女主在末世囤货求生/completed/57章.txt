**Elevator Horror**

In the shadows, Green Tea Zhen was fuming as she clung to a powerful thigh, throwing a disdainful look at Xie Jinghang. She had no intention of being polite. She was secretly angry, yet her situation was precarious.

"Let Meng go all out," she thought, "and leave the fighting to the professionals." Meng nodded knowingly. Although they were working together, preserving their own strength was paramount in times of crisis.

On Xie Jinghang’s side, his team had already begun their ascent up the ladder, each member securely fastening ropes around their waists for safety. The distance from the elevator door to the bottom of the shaft was over ten meters; a fall could mean death or severe injury. It was clear that the professionals—military personnel—were indeed better equipped for this kind of emergency, wielding their fire axes with skill.

With seamless coordination, they managed to open the elevator door in just a few quick movements. As Luo Bingting and the others climbed up, they immediately followed. If there were zombies outside, it would be safer for those with combat skills to clear the area first. The ordinary folks could stay beneath the elevator shaft.

When Luo Bingting peeked out, she found that the zombie presence wasn’t overwhelming. Xie Jinghang and his team could handle it. Soon after, the third and fourth members joined them, itching for action and ready to take a swing at any approaching threats.

Next, the fifth, seventh, and eighth members climbed up, tossing down the rope they'd secured to the elevator door. Below, they instructed the others to tie it around their waists for added safety while ascending. They worked together, pulling Uncle Zhu and Auntie Zhu up to safety.

Afterward, they began hauling up the stacks of tightly bound documents. Following them, the younger group, more daring than the others, climbed up without waiting for the rope. The more timid ones remained in line below. The situation outside was looking somewhat optimistic; the zombie siege that Luo Bingting had feared did not materialize. Perhaps the explosions from yesterday had less impact than expected.

As more people continued to ascend, Brother Zhu and Brother Er had just helped their sister up when a sudden scream pierced the air from the elevator shaft. Luo Bingting turned to run back and saw that the car, which had been stuck on the first basement level, was now being pushed inward by the zombies. Most of the vehicle was wedged into the elevator shaft, leaving only the rear wheels stuck at the entrance.

They had to navigate around the car to climb up the walls. If the vehicle fell, those below would either be crushed or bitten by the zombies jumping down. The screams didn’t come just from women; men were terrified too, paralyzed with fear and unable to move.

Brother Zhu and Brother Er hurried to climb higher. The laboratory researchers had mostly made it up, leaving only Zhang Hao still down below. Brother Zhu reached the elevator door on the first floor and turned to pull his brother up, but just as he stretched out his hand, the car lurched forward again.

The two brothers scrambled onto the first-floor ground as the third and fourth members helped drag them up. Once they were safely inside, they shouted down, “Zhang Hao, hurry up! Stop dawdling!”

Zhang Hao, still dazed, finally snapped to attention and began to climb. Their call also roused a few annoying survivors, who began to shove and scramble to get up, unintentionally kicking Zhang Hao several times in the process. Despite his good-natured temperament, he only climbed up once they were all safely on board.

Sally, wearing a skirt, was worried about exposing herself. Even in this dire moment, she thought about being the last one to go up, trusting that everyone would help her. Green Tea Zhen, however, was the first to follow the others up. With no men left below, she felt no need to put on an act.

As Zhang Hao climbed to the first basement level, he felt someone tugging at his pants. Looking down, he saw a pretty girl with an innocent expression asking for help to pull her up. Zhang Hao, feeling heroic despite being a bit of a coward himself, waited for her to climb closer before reaching out to help her.

“You should go up first; there are two more girls below, and I can help them as well,” he said. 

Green Tea Zhen was eager to ascend, fully aware that the car was on the verge of falling, while the two girls below were still hesitating. She softly thanked him, showering him with compliments about his gentlemanly demeanor and bravery, all while climbing swiftly and internally criticizing the two men ahead for being so slow. Every second spent inside was dangerous.

Zhang Hao managed to pull the second girl up as well, but when it was Sally’s turn, she flatly refused, urging him to climb faster. Confused, Zhang Hao didn’t press the issue, turning back to ascend. Green Tea Zhen had already been pulled up, but just as Zhang Hao was reaching the edge of the first basement, the car finally plummeted.

With a thunderous “BOMM,” the noise was deafening, followed by the collective screams of everyone around. A horde of zombies surged into the elevator shaft through the broken doors, nearly grabbing Zhang Hao. It was then that Luo Bingting reached the elevator entrance, witnessing the chaos unfold.

She urged Zhang Hao and Sally to hasten their ascent. Terrified, Zhang Hao felt his legs turn to jelly as he scrambled desperately upward. Below, Sally screamed for help, her voice piercing the chaos.

When Zhang Hao glanced back, he saw that zombies were beginning to step over one another to reach Sally’s ankles. Realizing he had to hurry to clear the ladder, he pushed himself harder and was finally pulled up by someone. 

But when he turned again, he saw Sally had already been grabbed by a zombie at her ankle. With a brutal yank, she was pulled down into the pile of undead. Blood erupted from her chest and neck as she let out a few horrified screams before falling silent.

Everyone watched in horror, the scene burned into their memories. Luo Bingting had seen people devoured by zombies in her previous life, but the mutated ones were even more terrifying. Experiencing such brutality again stirred emotions within her, though she managed to adjust quickly. The others, however, were not so fortunate.

Many faced their first encounter with such raw, bloody horror. The fear radiating from them was palpable, leaving them momentarily speechless, their minds blank except for the haunting image of Sally being consumed. This would perhaps be their greatest trauma and fear for all their lives.

Luo Bingting glanced at Green Tea Zhen, whose face had gone pale, contemplating whether to push her down while everyone was distracted. Green Tea Zhen was habitually hiding behind others, and right in front of her was Zhang Hao, who had only just climbed up. Remembering how Green Tea Zhen had pushed someone into the zombies previously to save herself, Luo Bingting knew she was capable of that.

But looking at Zhang Hao, who seemed to be an important partner of Uncle Zhu, she decided against it for now. For the sake of that naïve girl, she would let Green Tea Zhen off this time; there would be opportunities in the future.

When Xie Jinghang returned, Sally had already been consumed. He quickly organized people to exit the building; the loud screams would surely attract the zombies' attention. At this point, Luo Bingting had teamed up with Meng, arranging for Zhu’s young men to protect Uncle Zhu and his researchers.

Xie Jinghang paid no mind to the survivors, following closely behind as they exited the Dawn Building lobby. Along the way, they encountered wandering zombies, silently dispatching them with their swords.

The Zhu family’s young men were witnessing such scenes for the first time. After their initial shock, their hatred for the zombies surged to new heights, their every attack fueled by rage. They cleared a path until they reached the management office where Liu Xiaohui had been the day before.

Luo Bingting instructed everyone to take a brief rest on the first floor before taking An Min upstairs to retrieve Liu Xiaohui. Though she claimed not to care about anyone unimportant, she had promised Liu Xiaohui she would come back for her before leaving.

Not long after, the three returned quietly downstairs. When Liu Xiaohui saw the crowd outside, including what appeared to be a team of soldiers, she instantly felt a wave of relief wash over her.
