He Has a Problem

Inside, Luo Bingting was cursing silently, Why did I have to choose this place? People were pacing back and forth at the door, making her feel trapped.

She quickly shoved her anti-stab vest back into her storage space and pulled out a sharp dagger. This was a new model improved by the Zheng family, made from the same materials used to forge the famous Longquan swords—sharp and convenient.

In this situation, she couldn’t afford to make a sound, much less fire a gun. Luo Bingting tensed her entire body, waiting for the intruder to enter.

As soon as the shadow leaped inside, he seemed to sense something was off. Luo Bingting was swift, and within moments, the two engaged in a fierce exchange of blows.

The familiar moves made them both pause. The shadow removed his black mask, and Luo Bingting gasped in surprise and delight. 

Quickly, she pulled down her own mask, and his smile widened. 

Outside the door, a search was already being organized, likely with the approval of Elder Zhang. Luo Bingting pointed upstairs, and Xie Jinghang nodded in understanding. 

Feigning to pull her backpack from the corner, she retrieved her anti-stab gloves. After putting them on, she began to climb up the window. 

Her upper body strength was decent, but climbing up from below was a bit more challenging. Xie Jinghang went first, reaching the second-floor window and turning back to pull Luo Bingting up. The two pressed tightly against the outer wall in the night, balancing on the narrow window ledge.

Before long, the search team found the room they had just hidden in. They turned on the lights and inspected the area before moving on, causing Luo Bingting to breathe a sigh of relief.

The search was quick and thorough; they flipped over anything that could potentially hide someone, even pulling back curtains. Luo Bingting could hear them rummaging through the room and the leader’s precise orders.

Fortunately, they were still plastered against the second-floor wall, as there were also searchers combing the first floor. If anyone looked up, they would surely spot them.

Heart racing, they managed to evade one wave after another of searches until the row house fell silent.

The two returned to the recently searched small room to hide, both eager to ask the other questions. 

Luo Bingting pulled out her phone and began typing in the notes app. Seeing her actions, Xie Jinghang couldn’t help but smile. “How did you end up here?”

She passed the phone to him, and through the screen’s glow, he could see the smile on his face, which left Luo Bingting feeling a bit puzzled. Is this guy a fool?

Xie Jinghang took the phone back and typed, “There’s been a lot of movement at the Kunshan base. Someone asked me to come check it out.”

Understanding dawned on Luo Bingting; Xie Jinghang came from the Kunshan base, where he had seemingly been under Li Qinfeng’s wing. It seemed the political struggles there were fierce.

He continued typing, “What about you? What are you doing here?”

Luo Bingting responded, “Do you think I’d get caught by a bunch of little thugs and brought here? You believe that?”

Xie Jinghang couldn’t contain his laughter, his smile stretching wide as he tried to suppress it, causing his chest to shake. 

Luo Bingting looked at him in disbelief, her mind racing with four words: “What an idiot.”

Quickly, she typed again, “Someone is deliberately causing chaos here. I took the opportunity to slip out. We need to leave.”

Xie Jinghang pointed toward the outer wall, and Luo Bingting nodded. 

“But I still have some things to confirm.”

Xie Jinghang hesitated; he certainly wasn’t comfortable with her wandering out alone at night. “What do you need to confirm? Maybe I can help.”

Luo Bingting typed and handed him the phone again. “I need to confirm if Fu Buqi is here and who attended tonight’s banquet. I need to get the guest list.”

Xie Jinghang received the phone back. “Fu Buqi is here. Someone is trying to assassinate him. Getting the guest list will be harder now that the whole base is on lockdown. If we don’t leave soon, we might not be able to.”

Hearing the word “assassinate,” he looked at Luo Bingting in shock. She nodded seriously, then pointed at the wall.

Xie Jinghang could only nod in resignation. Taking advantage of the cover of night and the recent search, they quickly climbed over the wall and escaped the Fenglin villa base.

It was unbelievable—just ten minutes ago, they were hiding, terrified of being discovered, and now they were sitting in Xie Jinghang’s modified car, distancing themselves from the brightly lit Fenglin villa.

The ride was quiet; Xie Jinghang’s route encountered a few stray zombies, which he dispatched with ease.

Luo Bingting reflected on how hectic the day had been, filled with non-stop action. As her adrenaline faded, hunger and fatigue began to creep in.

She rummaged through her backpack for a small loaf of bread and some milk, eating quietly. A bite of bread followed by a sip of milk; it was so cold outside that the milk, stored at room temperature, felt chilly when she drank it.

Suddenly, Xie Jinghang spoke up, “Were you the one trying to assassinate Fu Buqi?”

“Cough, cough, cough...” 

Luo Bingting was caught off guard by the sudden question and choked, coughing violently.

Xie Jinghang casually handed her a couple of tissues, noticing the tears at the corners of her eyes from coughing.

“Those explosions were your doing too, huh? Impressive, Miss Luo.” 

Luo Bingting looked at him in surprise, not understanding his intention. Isn’t it wiser to keep things unspoken?

She maintained her composure, holding the unfinished milk in one hand while her other slipped into her backpack, her gun already gripped tightly.

“Don’t be nervous. I don’t know what kind of deep hatred you have with Fu Buqi, but I have to say—well done.” 

Xie Jinghang observed her vigilant yet composed demeanor, his voice carrying a hint of unintentional amusement and mockery.

Luo Bingting remained silent, her guard still firmly in place despite his words.

It wasn’t until the rearview mirror no longer captured any trace of the Fenglin villa base that Xie Jinghang slowed the car down. 

“I’m being sincere. I came here to kill him too. I’ve been tracking him for a while now, managed to catch him a few times, but he always slipped away. He’s problematic.” 

Xie Jinghang’s voice was earnest, but he wore a puzzled expression with his last statement.

“Why do you have a grudge against Fu Buqi?” Luo Bingting countered.

“Fu Buqi has always framed me, tried to assassinate me without reason. I had to strike first.” 

Xie Jinghang frowned, puzzled by this point. He couldn’t find the motive or reason behind her actions.

Luo Bingting felt a flicker of realization; it seemed Xie Jinghang and Fu Buqi were in a deadly feud. 

From her understanding of Fu Buqi, he never made enemies lightly. If he personally targeted someone, it meant they posed a significant threat or impediment to him.

But the word “first” sparked something in her mind, something just out of reach.

Looking at Xie Jinghang’s earnest face, her guard lowered a notch. 

“You mean our goals align?” 

Xie Jinghang nodded seriously as he drove. 

“If you manage to kill Fu Buqi today, it would mean you avenged my grudge. I owe you one.” 

“He’s as good as dead. I’ll take him out with one bullet today.” 

Luo Bingting replied confidently, her pride and assurance evident in her tone.

Seeing her expression, Xie Jinghang refrained from dousing her enthusiasm with cold water, merely nodding in acknowledgment. 

Yet, doubt lingered in his mind; he had once been very confident too. 

The outcome would be revealed in a few days. 

They drove the car into a forest free of zombies, turning off the engine and lights, waiting for dawn.

Driving on low beams through the night was already perilous. They could crash into a few wandering zombies, but if a horde appeared, it would be easy to flip the car and be surrounded.

Xie Jinghang assured Luo Bingting to rest easy while he kept watch. Thinking that she would drive tomorrow, she reclined her seat and fell asleep.

They returned to the stronghold without incident. Everyone saw Luo Bingting and Xie Jinghang return together without raising an eyebrow.

Feeling as if she had shed the heaviest burden of her life, Luo Bingting’s eyes sparkled with ease and contentment. The Luo family noticed the change in her demeanor.

It was as if she had reverted to her relaxed self before the apocalypse, lounging in the old residence. They speculated it might be too cold, causing the young lady to hibernate.

Only Xie Jinghang understood that the cold wasn’t the real reason.

He showed no signs of relaxation, occasionally going out. A week later, the news he brought back left Luo Bingting in shock for a long time. 

“What? Fu Buqi isn’t dead? Impossible!”
