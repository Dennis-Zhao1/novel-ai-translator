**Closing the Door on the Dog**

The injured were promptly taken to the infirmary for treatment. Brother Zhu's condition had stabilized, though he had lost a significant amount of blood. His wounds had been treated with hemostatic and anti-inflammatory measures, but he was still weak. Brother Zhu's second-in-command, whose healing abilities were rather rudimentary, had been too busy with experiments to train properly. He had only just managed to keep his older brother alive, and now he felt a mix of despair and regret weighing heavily on him.

Uncle Zhu, having fainted for a while, had regained consciousness. His injuries were serious, and his brother insisted he rest, sparing him from worrying about the old master Zhu and the youngest’s funeral for the time being.

Lo Bingting observed the disarray among the injured Zhu family members and instructed them not to wander around at night. She then gathered her team to strategize their next moves.

Dinner was not delayed; Aunt Li prepared a meal that was up to her usual standard, and after everyone ate in turns, Lo Bingting stood guard at her post. 

Originally, there had been a large searchlight here, but it had been damaged during the last attack on the Kunshan base and had never been replaced. Lo Bingting distributed firearms and weapons to her team members. As both superpowered individuals and elite soldiers, they were well-equipped and could leverage their abilities for greater effectiveness.

That night, an eerie silence enveloped the fortress. The fatigue from the day’s events weighed heavily on everyone. Except for those keeping vigil for Old Master Zhu and the youngest, the rest of the group was quickly ushered off to bed. The dozens of corpses hanging in the square cast a chilling shadow over the scene, and even Uncle Zhu, who had been whipping the bodies, had been knocked out and carried back.

Lo Bingting sent Anmin, the fastest runner, to the power control room to turn off all unnecessary lights, leaving only a few dim bulbs on, as they silently awaited the enemy's arrival.

Mango stood beside Lo Bingting, holding military-grade night vision binoculars. After a moment, he whispered, “They’re here.”

Everyone had been outfitted with walkie-talkies, and upon receiving the signal, they all entered combat readiness. Using her keen eyesight, Lo Bingting spotted around five armored vehicles, three riot control vehicles, and one military jeep approaching.

Silently praying that Fu Buqi would show up as planned, she thought about how she had prepared a grand welcome for him. According to the traitor's description, the operation plan from Kunshan Base involved secretly opening the fortress gates at night to let their people in. The Kunshan team would then take control of all the Zhu family members and abscond with the laboratory personnel and their research results, trading them for weapons and supplies.

Lo Bingting had Anmin pretend to be a member of the Zhu family’s collateral branch to assist in the operation. Sure enough, once they exchanged coded signals, the opposing commander’s wariness melted away, and he hurriedly urged them to open the gates.

But Fu Buqi did not appear. Lo Bingting felt a twinge of disappointment, but seeing the armored and riot control vehicles safely make it to their side, she begrudgingly accepted the outcome.

Anmin feigned hesitation in opening the gates too wide, insisting that the intruders enter quietly. Persuaded by Anmin's eloquence, the vehicles rolled into the fortress, causing no small amount of commotion among the lookout team.

With the gates opened just wide enough for one person to pass, the vehicles parked outside, and the commander organized his soldiers to disembark and make their way inside on foot.

Leading the way, Anmin guided them while Lo Bingting watched from the shadows, observing the sizable number of intruders—over fifty, though the exact count of superpowered individuals remained uncertain.

The fortress was dark and quiet. The Kunshan team, well-equipped and heavily burdened, walked cautiously, but their vigilance dulled as they neared the square. It was only then that they realized how few streetlights remained lit; only a few windows in the dormitories cast a feeble glow. They hastily dispatched scouts to investigate their surroundings, but it wasn’t long before a horrific scream pierced the air, followed by a rapid succession of gunfire.

The commander jumped in alarm and ordered his subordinates to turn on their headlights. But as the lights illuminated the square, a chilling sight greeted them: dozens of corpses hanging from the columns, reminiscent of a horror movie.

Before they could process this, a barrage of gunfire erupted from behind, and turning around, they were met with the flashing colors of lightning abilities as teammates fell one after another.

Lo Bingting unleashed her ice spikes, while Mango followed up with metal projectiles, mercilessly cutting down the foes that had dared to invade.

Despite the enemy's attempts to retaliate, the team activated Anmin's earth-based shields, which not only blocked incoming fire but created pits that ensnared their aggressors, trapping them in place.

The Kunshan base superpowered individuals were quick to react, with one unleashing a fire attack aimed directly at Anmin. However, he deftly dodged the attack using his wind abilities and countered with a slicing wind blade that severely injured the enemy's shoulder.

Lo Bingting found herself facing three superpowered opponents. They had a degree of teamwork, but their coordination was off, which she noted with a sense of regret even as the battle raged around her.

Easily dispatching a few more foes, the regular soldiers were even easier to handle. The earth wall shields remained mobile, efficiently absorbing attacks that would have otherwise hit their mark.

Then, with a swift gust of sand blinding the enemies, Lo Bingting and her team struck from behind, capitalizing on the confusion. Anmin's crude but effective fighting style proved invaluable in this chaotic melee.

The gunfire echoed through the fortress, waking the remaining residents. Those too timid huddled under their blankets, while the braver souls peeked through curtains at the square, witnessing a chaotic dance of gunfire and superpowered abilities illuminating the night.

Half an hour into the clash, the battle concluded with Lo Bingting’s team achieving a decisive victory. They spared the opposing commander for questioning, demanding to know who had sent him and what their intentions were.

The commander, however, remained defiant, throwing out threats before taking his own life, leaving the team with no further information.

Everyone shrugged it off, knowing that the attack had been orchestrated by Fu Buqi, the head of the Kunshan base. Ecstatic, they stripped the intruders of their equipment and stored it away. Lo Bingting had already driven her team to the gates to collect the armored and riot control vehicles.

It was a strange turn of events—without guns or artillery, the enemy had inadvertently supplied them.

Xie Jinghang truly was a tactical genius; the strategy of luring them in and then closing the door on the dog had proven to be a masterstroke.

The Kunshan base operatives had been naïve, believing everything they were told. Perhaps their previous interactions with the Zhu family’s collateral branch had made them complacent, leading them to underestimate the challenges they faced.

The armored and riot control vehicles sat neatly lined up in the parking lot, while even the military jeep hadn’t been spared.

They then ordered the bodies of the invaders to be displayed in the square, setting up a night watch rotation before Lo Bingting retired to her quarters for some much-needed rest.

The next morning, she awoke to the sound of commotion.

Rubbing her face, she washed up quickly in her space before heading downstairs.

Uncle Zhu’s condition had improved significantly, and he stood alongside Brother Zhu, staring blankly at the corpses in the square.

Nearly everyone in the fortress had gathered around, some whispering among themselves, while others took a quick glance before hurriedly retreating.

Had so many people really attempted a surprise attack last night? It was a total rout—a display of overwhelming strength.

When people looked back at Lo Bingting, their expressions had shifted subtly, now tinged with respect.

Lo Bingting noticed the change but feigned ignorance, greeting them before directing a cleanup of the corpses.

At that moment, Xie Jinghang approached, whispering in her ear. Lo Bingting nodded and pointed out a few bodies to be sent to the laboratory.

Turning to Brother Zhu, she remarked, “Superpowered individuals also have crystal cores in their heads. It would be worth examining them in the lab to see how they differ from those of zombies.”

At her words, everyone grew even more cautious, obediently complying with her instructions.

After briefly explaining the events of the previous night to Uncle Zhu and the others and showcasing the spoils of war, Lo Bingting stated firmly, “We’ve forged a deadly rivalry with the Kunshan base. They’ve failed in their two attacks, gaining nothing while suffering heavy losses. They will only retaliate more fiercely. We can’t afford to sit idly by; it’s time to change our strategy in this apocalyptic fortress.”
