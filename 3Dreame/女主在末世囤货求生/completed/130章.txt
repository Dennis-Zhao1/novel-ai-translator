**The White Lotus’ Flirtation**

Zhu Yidan watched as Xie Jinghang sat on the sofa, lost in thought. The others were busy with their own tasks—some were packing, while others were organizing their gear. No one paid her any attention.

After calling out a couple of times with no response, she felt irritated and decided to step outside, thinking it might be better to find Anna for a chat. She didn't want to linger with these annoying men any longer.

Not long after she stepped out, Xiao Bailian appeared with a tray of tea, heading towards the guest room. Since arriving at the base, she had been assigned to the kitchen. There, she had played the pity card with the kitchen manager, and because her cousin used to be Pei Qian's deputy and was well-liked in the base, she received some preferential treatment. She often volunteered to help with tasks she could manage, and this time, she had taken over the responsibility of delivering tea from Xiao Li, who was in charge of hospitality in the kitchen.

Normally, anyone could do such a task, but she had changed into a pink and white dress and had made an effort to style her hair, letting down the braids she had worn earlier. Now, her soft curls cascaded over her shoulders, framing her fair face, giving her a vibe of a pure and alluring beauty.

Gently knocking on the door, the deputy team leader came to answer. He was greeted by the sight of her standing at the door, holding the tea with a gentle and pure smile.

The deputy team leader and the others had spent years in the military, and being the typical tough guys they were, they often felt protective of delicate girls like her, which made it easy for Xiao Bailian to serve the tea to Xie Jinghang.

Meanwhile, Xie Jinghang remained in his seat on the sofa, absorbed in a mental debate with the annoying voice in his head. He was trying to negotiate a better price for the points he had earned, particularly for an air cannon he had his eye on in the shop. This weapon didn't require bullets; it utilized a special technology from Planet Y, capable of dealing damage greater than that of a bullet using compressed air. The best part was its instant firing capability—it didn’t need to heat up or risk exploding, making it a perfect killing tool.

His intense focus meant he was oblivious to the outside world. Xiao Bailian greeted him softly and chatted about trivial matters, but he didn’t hear a word. It wasn't until he managed to gain the upper hand in his mental debate that he finally noticed a sniffling sound and asked the voice in his head, "What is that noise?"

The pesky voice chuckled, “Host, looks like you’ve got quite the romantic interest! Oh, hee hee hee! I need to tell the little fairy that you’re out here flirting and making eyes at all the pretty girls!”

Before it could finish, Xie Jinghang hit the mute button.

“Deputy, explain what’s going on here,” he said, his imposing aura suddenly filling the room as he cast a sidelong glance at his deputy.

“Captain, Miss Lin came to bring us tea. I thought it would be rude not to let her in, so... but I swear, I didn’t make her cry! It was because you ignored her when she tried to talk to you, which upset her!” The deputy’s voice trailed off as he realized how absurd he sounded, especially under the weight of Xie Jinghang's piercing gaze, which reminded him of the days before the apocalypse when the captain would drill them mercilessly. He shivered involuntarily.

Seeing the deputy’s demeanor, Xiao Bailian quickly wiped her tears, her voice heavy with emotion as she said, “Captain Xie, please don’t blame the deputy. It was my fault... hic...”

But Xie Jinghang wasn’t interested in giving her a chance to elaborate. “As long as you understand it was your issue, Miss Lin, you can go back now. It’s not convenient for a girl to hang around a room full of men.”

Stunned, Xiao Bailian didn’t know how to react. However, she understood that building rapport took time, and being clingy would ruin her image. So, she stood up gracefully, bowed to Xie Jinghang and the others, and thanked the deputy again before leaving with her empty tray.

As Xiao Bailian exited the guest room, she walked with an air of charm, which caught the attention of Pei Qian and Pei Chang, who had invited Xie Jinghang to dine. Pei Chang snorted dismissively, “How amusing. Wherever there are men, there she is. Is delivering tea even part of her job? Does she think we’re fools?”

Pei Qian frowned, his expression thoughtful as he stood there for a moment before taking Pei Chang’s hand to knock on the guest room door.

Inside, Xie Jinghang was finishing up a lecture to the deputy and the others. In the pre-apocalypse days, such behavior might have been excusable, but now, whether they were superhumans or ordinary people, the tendency to be soft-hearted around women could be fatal.

After reprimanding his team, Xie Jinghang was ready to eat. Later, Pei Qian pulled him aside for a chat. Zhu Yidan, sitting a bit too far away to hear their conversation, could only observe their expressions. Soon, she noticed that they called Xiao Bailian over, and the overly dramatic expressions and gestures she made, especially the smug glances she shot at Xie Jinghang, seemed to say, "See? I’ve got him wrapped around my finger. What a loser you are."

Zhu Yidan decided she would go back and have a good rant to her girlfriends about these blind men who were falling for such tricks.

At that moment, Pei Chang, sitting nearby, noticed Zhu Yidan's displeased expression and turned to see what was bothering her. The moment he did, he stood up abruptly, the noise catching Pei Qian’s attention. He quickly left Xie Jinghang and Xiao Bailian to comfort Pei Chang.

Zhu Yidan clearly saw the disdainful look on Xiao Bailian’s face and felt a wave of disgust wash over her. She clenched her fists in frustration.

As she debated whether to create a scene and stir up some jealousy in the main wife, she realized the opportunity was slipping away. Regret flooded her as she missed her chance to perform. Although her acting skills weren't stellar, she excelled at playing the melodramatic scenes.

But it was too late. Xiao Bailian seemed to bounce away as if she had just received the best news, skipping along as if she were invincible in her youth.

Zhu Yidan thought this entire episode had cured her low blood pressure. Watching Xie Jinghang return to his seat, she anticipated the moment he would start mocking the situation, but instead, she heard Pei Qian’s soothing voice next to her.

“Alright, alright, I’ll take her away. We can’t let her be an eyesore in front of you, okay?”

Pei Chang immediately stopped her antics and pointed at him, “Are you serious? No kidding?”

“Absolutely! I just spoke with Brother Xie, and we agreed that Lin Weiwei will go with him.”

Now it was Zhu Yidan’s turn to be shocked. What was this? Going with them? To the apocalypse fortress??? 

Were these people out of their minds? What kind of normal person would suggest that?

But then she heard Pei Qian continue, “Our base has many ordinary people who need to go to the apocalypse fortress, so rest assured, it’s legitimate.”

Zhu Yidan finally grasped the situation. So, they were giving such an important opportunity to Xiao Bailian? 

Ugh, men.

Her mental notes were already filled with material to share with her girlfriends, but knowing that “a small inconvenience can disrupt a grand plan," Zhu Yidan surprisingly held her tongue. Meanwhile, Pei Qian used her as an example to show Pei Chang what a proper wife should be like.
