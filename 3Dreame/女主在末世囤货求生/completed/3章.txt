**No Unprepared Battles**

After confirming that there were no restrictions on entering or exiting the space, Luo Bingting finally felt the gnawing pangs of hunger settle in. 

Her phone displayed 8:17 PM, well past her usual dinner time. During the apocalypse, she rarely felt hunger, let alone in her current body. Ever since her grandfather passed away, she had preferred solitude, only keeping a couple of maids who came by regularly to cook and clean. The old mansion had been left with only the essentials, and now she lived in a small apartment, with just two maids who were on a schedule.

Her thoughts drifted back to the doorbell that had woken her up earlier. Could it have been one of the maids coming to prepare dinner? Sure enough, she checked her WeChat and found a message from one of them, saying she assumed Luo Bingting wasn’t home. After waiting for half an hour with no answer, she left a message saying she would go back.

Feeling a bit embarrassed and apologetic, Luo Bingting replied to the maid and sent a red envelope as a gesture of goodwill. She made sure to slip on her slippers this time; the cut on her foot wasn’t serious, but she quickly treated it before summoning the cleaning robot to sweep up the glass shards. After that, she headed straight to the kitchen.

Opening the fridge, she noted that the ingredients were fresh, as the maids brought them in daily. The refrigeration section only contained a few drinks and some eggs. She shook her head and moved to the freezer, which was stocked full of frozen items. There were neatly packed dumplings and wontons prepared by the maids, arranged like a supermarket display.

Shelves! She thought about the barren yellow land in her space, realizing that she absolutely needed to set up some sort of storage shelf; otherwise, it would be inconvenient to access her supplies.

As she pondered over her storage plans, her hands instinctively began to gather ingredients she could use for a meal, determined to satisfy her hunger. The white, plump dumplings were fragrant, and with each sip of her soda, she felt so happy that her toes curled in delight. Yet, deep down, she wished for the maids to make even more dumplings—enough to last her through the apocalypse when she could eat to her heart's content.

The speed at which she ate was still influenced by her experiences in the apocalypse; she finished much faster than she used to. After clearing the dining table, she glanced at the dishwasher and the cleaning robot recharging itself at the base, marveling at how much happiness technology brought to her life.

The impending apocalypse was unavoidable, but if she had a second chance, she would cherish it, planning carefully to avoid any unprepared battles. 

With this thought in mind, Luo Bingting poured herself a cup of coffee and began strategizing in her study. After all, she had only experienced a few years of the apocalypse; when the zombie outbreak occurred, she was at the old mansion, surrounded by people who had fought alongside her grandfather and had watched over her as she grew up.

Had it not been for their protection, she might have been overwhelmed by the zombie tide, unable to reach the Kunshan base safely. Many of them later awakened their own abilities, while some remained ordinary people like her. However, after the class divide was created, they were all fragmented and weakened by that bastard Fu Buqi, leaving her without any allies.

Not wanting to dwell on those thoughts, she took a sip of her coffee and focused on organizing her supplies. Suddenly, her mind was flooded with ideas, making it hard to find any logical order.

Determined to avoid a chaotic thought process, Luo Bingting opened a blue app on her phone. It was filled with highly educated individuals. Entering keywords related to survival in the apocalypse, she quickly found a plethora of creative discussions.

Clicking on the most popular topic, she was amazed to find a highly-upvoted answer that included a detailed supply list formatted as a mind map. The post had been published two years ago and had been updated over the following months.

What a genius! After finishing her coffee, Luo Bingting compared her plans with the mind map. She was surprised to see that it included hot weapons and military equipment, which would be challenging to acquire.

Pushing aside the thought that the person behind the post might also be a reincarnator, she chuckled at herself and turned her focus to the section about daily essentials.

The list was incredibly comprehensive, detailing everything from clothing and food to disaster relief supplies, medicine, and sanitary products, all clearly categorized and suggesting preferences based on gender and circumstances. There were even must-have items, like sanitary pads.

Intrigued, Luo Bingting began to read through the comments. The top comment read, “According to this list, I’d have to be the richest person in Huaguo!” Beneath it, a chorus of replies echoed the sentiment of being unable to afford it, prompting Luo Bingting to pull out her phone and check her available funds.

Although she was the sole heir to Huaguo's top jewelry brand and her family business had a history of several hundred years with substantial assets, the cash she had on hand was still limited to a few minor goals.

There was nothing to be done; after graduating from a prestigious school with a degree in jewelry design, she reluctantly took on the role of CEO, relying heavily on her staff and a few assistants to help manage the company.

Her other businesses were handled by professional managers, who reported quarterly and annually. Since taking over, she had grown disinterested in managing those earnings; otherwise, her liquid funds would likely be even less.

With the apocalypse looming, her assets would soon dwindle to worthless scraps. Looking at the total amount on the genius's list, she realized that she would need to prepare for at least dozens of minor goals to gather everything.

She didn’t want to let down the people her grandfather had left behind. They had all contributed to her survival in one way or another, and some had even sacrificed themselves for her. She didn’t want this life to end up the same way.

As for the connections and resources her grandfather had left her, Luo Bingting chuckled to herself. If it weren't for her surname and the fact that people valued their promises, who would pay her any attention in the morally bankrupt world of the apocalypse?

Realizing she had let her thoughts wander too far again, Luo Bingting contacted her executive assistant to compile a list of her assets. 

Her assistant had long since gotten used to Luo Bingting’s unpredictable work hours, and for the sake of a high salary, he followed her every instruction. The more tasks he was assigned, the more it reinforced his importance to Luo Bingting, as if he were her central processing unit.

Work was work; what was there to fear about complexity? He wasn’t the only assistant available. With a few quick strokes, he organized the tasks based on the different industries of her assets, collaborating with several others to complete Luo Bingting’s requests.

Luo Bingting printed out the genius's mind map, categorizing it with different colored file tabs before placing it all into one folder. The list of hot weapons and military equipment was kept in a separate file at the back.

Feeling particularly pleased with herself for having borrowed from the genius’s work, Luo Bingting took her glass of red wine and strolled out onto the terrace. Living in a spacious apartment had many perks, but nothing captivated her heart quite like the breathtaking view it offered.

Before her, the city was ablaze with neon lights, skyscrapers piercing the clouds. Little did anyone know that a month later, the apocalypse would arrive, bringing hordes of zombies and chaos across the world…

Moreover, the genius's post had predicted extreme weather events, such as extreme heat, severe cold, eternal night, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Looking at the robust city before her, how long could it withstand such natural disasters?

Feeling a twinge of melancholy but with her gaze becoming increasingly resolute, she reflected on how well she had managed in her previous life without any preparation. In this life, things would only get better. Holding onto this hope and expectation, Luo Bingting raised her glass in a toast to the cityscape before her, smiling brightly in the night.
