**Survival in the Post-Apocalyptic Fortress**

Now, only a small fraction of families had returned to the post-apocalyptic fortress, while the rest were still on their way. On the side of Luo Bingting, everyone was present. The Zheng family, Aunt Li, the old butler, and a few guards from the ancestral home were all standing on the outskirts. When the old butler saw that the young lady was unharmed, he nodded in relief.

Grandpa Zhu signaled for Luo Bingting to play the previously saved video for everyone. She projected it onto the large screen in the office, and as they watched, gasps of shock filled the room. What on earth had happened? By the end of the video, the faces of the Zheng family were as pale as ashes.

The younger generation of the Zhu family had already uttered the word "zombie," while the older members were simply stunned by the sudden turn of events. Grandpa Zhu spoke loudly, “The world outside has descended into chaos. Our capabilities are limited, and we can only take refuge in these deep mountains to ensure our safety. From today onward, no one is allowed to come and go freely. Each person has their own responsibilities, and once everyone is here, we will assign tasks one by one.”

The Zhu family had grown accustomed to obeying the old man’s orders, and there were no voices of dissent. The same went for Luo Bingting’s group; the seniors in the ancestral home were loyal and obedient, while the Zheng family trusted the wisdom of their ancestors’ predictions, which had now come to pass. There was no room for doubt anymore; cooperation and obedience were essential for survival.

The tasks assigned to the Zheng family were straightforward: sharpen all the Longquan swords. Luo Bingting had brought everything needed, and with something to occupy their hands, the Zheng family quickly settled into a routine.

Once she collected herself, Luo Bingting felt quite dissatisfied with her stunned reaction to the zombie scare earlier. She conveyed to Grandpa Zhu and Uncle Zhu that, besides regular watch duties and checkpoints, everyone—regardless of age or gender—needed to undergo training. While the fortress was safe for now, it was better to be prepared for the worst; everyone had to possess the ability to combat zombies.

Uncle Zhu wholeheartedly agreed. "It’s one thing to not need the skills; it’s another to be caught unprepared."

Thus, Meng Ge, who had a background as a mercenary, became the first chief instructor of the fortress, responsible for teaching combat techniques to everyone.

Luo Bingting considered the characteristics of zombies and, after discussing it with Meng Ge, developed a comprehensive training program. The younger Zhu family members also found numerous references from movies and TV shows, which surprisingly turned out to be quite useful.

The techniques were simple, focusing mainly on destroying the head and avoiding scratches or bites from zombies. Furthermore, everyone returning to the fortress had to be inspected at checkpoints; no injury could be overlooked, and any wounded individuals had to be isolated in the security room next to the first checkpoint.

Meng Ge was not only an excellent bodyguard but also a strict instructor. He had started as a soldier and had trained many recruits over the years. With his extensive experience, he didn't expect miracles from the novices.

His lesson plans were practical, ensuring that training did not interfere with the normal operation of the fortress. Every day included courses on physical fitness, combat skills, and reaction improvement. The techniques were tailored based on the participants' actual conditions, allowing them to conserve energy and effectively take down zombies.

Luo Bingting had always recognized Meng Ge's talent; otherwise, Grandpa Zhu wouldn't have brought him under his wing. Seeing his detailed and reasonable plans made her feel proud, but that was a matter for later.

Dissatisfied with herself, Luo Bingting trained not only during designated training times but also continued her regimen in her space. While at the training grounds, she focused on improving her techniques and reaction times; in her space, she pushed herself to build stamina, collapsing from exhaustion only to wake and train again.

Within a few days, her physique became increasingly toned, with hints of defined abs starting to show.

Meng Ge noted that the young lady indeed had exceptional talent. In a short time, her reaction speed had increased significantly, and she had grasped the combat techniques well. She was becoming more flexible and stronger. Although he coveted the Longquan sword she wielded, she assured him that she had prepared a selection for him to choose from.

Excited, Meng Ge began to devise techniques for using the sword against zombies and was confident he could train a capable team.

Grandpa Zhu was the only one not required to participate in training; he paced the perimeter of the training ground for several laps each day.

The entire fortress was buzzing with a newfound spirit.

On the fifth day after arriving at the fortress, the outside world had descended into utter chaos. That very night, zombies had spread rapidly—not just in small areas but globally. News reports had begun flooding in at midnight, detailing how rabies was attacking humans. The posts Luo Bingting had sent out were deleted simply because she had mentioned the word "zombie." Even her official account for Mingzhu Group had been stripped of all posting privileges.

Her personal account faced the same fate; any posts were met with an immediate ban, prohibiting all forms of communication. The Zhu family found themselves in a similar situation. Although they had secured their own safety, they were distressed knowing others might perish due to their ignorance.

In the beginning, the government had responded actively, trying to control the spread of the “rabies.” Hospitals became overcrowded, but soon those facilities fell into chaos, and even police stations succumbed. As these essential services crumbled, the situation spiraled out of control.

During the initial days, phones still functioned, and Luo Bingting watched as her colleagues gathered with their families, urging them to stockpile food and water, and to secure their windows and doors. They expressed gratitude for her timely announcement to take a break, showing concern for her safety. Seeing that some were running low on supplies, Luo Bingting encouraged them to stock up more and even sent out red envelopes to motivate them to spend money and meet their work quotas. Once the zombie outbreak began and communication was cut off, Luo Bingting felt helpless, and the headaches began.

One morning, Uncle Zhu approached her with concern, saying that Zhu Yidan's family had yet to return to the fortress. Zhu Yidan was the daughter of Grandpa Zhu's elder brother, and her two brothers and mother were also unreachable.

On the night they had been notified, Grandpa Zhu's family was in the midst of a crucial research phase at their biological laboratory. Fearing the outbreak would happen on the 20th, they had hesitated, thinking they could buy some time, but now they found themselves unable to return. The area around the laboratory had become overrun, and employees downstairs had turned into zombies.

The only silver lining was that the family was safe with the laboratory team, but their supplies were limited. After five days in the lab, with a group of over ten people, their stockpile had been exhausted.

Now, Luo Bingting and the young and strong members of the Zhu family, particularly those who had excelled in training, needed to form a rescue team to bring back Grandpa Zhu's family. This time, An Min was also included; quick-witted and physically capable, he was a valuable asset.

Worried for her sister’s safety, Luo Bingting gathered Meng Ge, Zhu family members, and An Min—eight in total—to formulate a rescue plan in the training grounds.

With her established position in both the Zhu family and the post-apocalyptic fortress, everyone understood that half the fortress belonged to the Luo family. Grandpa Zhu respected Luo Bingting’s opinions, often deferring to her plans.

The Zhu family had few daughters, and besides the adult Zhu Yidan, the rest were all quite young, the oldest just entering middle school.

The task at hand was significant; in addition to an armored vehicle, they needed a tourist bus. Fortunately, Meng Ge had all the necessary licenses and could drive any type of vehicle. The Zheng family had sharpened the Longquan swords, which were now distributed to everyone; those with stronger abilities could handle them with ease.

Things hadn’t yet devolved to the point where they needed to resort to firearms, and both Luo Bingting and Grandpa Zhu agreed that it was best not to reveal their biggest trump card for now.

Once the plans were finalized, Meng Ge checked everyone’s walkie-talkies and gear. Each person was equipped with protective gear on their arms and legs, something Luo Bingting had stockpiled earlier. These items were lightweight yet sturdy, mainly to shield against zombie bites. The group split into two teams and quickly made their way to the parking lot to retrieve the vehicles.
