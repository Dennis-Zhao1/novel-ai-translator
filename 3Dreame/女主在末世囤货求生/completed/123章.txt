**Chapter Two: Actions Unfold**

With a firm grip on the cart's handle, she bit her lip, swallowing down her resentment and anger. "Summer insects can't talk about ice," she reminded herself bitterly. What did they know, huh? Keeping her head down, she returned to her post.

That evening, while on break, Adam quietly shared the rumors circulating inside the fortress with Serena. Indeed, many of them had been deliberately spread by their own group, aiming to escalate tensions and flush out the snakes hiding in the grass.

To avoid alerting the enemy, Serena pretended to be hesitant about the list she had already prepared, claiming public opinion was forcing her to reconsider. Yet, somehow, the list leaked. 

True to the rumors, a few names from the guard team did appear in the first batch of ten, but only three were actually listed; the others were ordinary folks from various positions around the fortress. To the shock of everyone, the first name on the list was none other than Uncle Zhu’s fourth son. An uproar ensued, with many believing the ranking was a blatant favoritism towards the Zhu family, leading to increased dissatisfaction with them behind closed doors.

It was as if everyone believed that once they had the chance to awaken their powers, the Zhu family would be trampled beneath their feet. Humans are strange that way—once their basic needs are met, they look for ways to dominate their peers, as if that would elevate their status.

After the list was revealed, it wasn’t those on it who celebrated the most; rather, it was those who weren’t included. Everyone started to think that even if the list were real, to prevent accusations of favoritism, there would surely be a reshuffle. If it turned out to be fake, even better—everyone would have a chance to participate.

Adam felt dumbfounded as he heard people speak this way. The awakening agents weren’t limited to just ten doses; these people were only fixated on the first batch without considering that this was meant for the entire populace of the fortress. What was there to fight about?

Serena chuckled lightly at this. It was all part of her plan to make everyone believe that the materials were scarce and that only ten fortunate souls would get the chance. Everyone was eager to become an awakened being—previously they had no means, but now there was a way. How could they possibly wait?

The next morning, rumors spread throughout the fortress that the agents hadn’t gone through clinical trials; the first batch of injectees were merely guinea pigs. There were even whispers that this was a conspiracy by the end-times fortress to cut down on their dwindling supplies, concocting a scheme to reduce their numbers. In fact, the awakening agents didn’t exist at all—little Lu was just a hidden ability user masquerading as an ordinary person, waiting for the right moment to deceive them.

Liu Xiaohui and others were astonished at how quickly the narrative had shifted overnight, as if an invisible force was stirring the pot, escalating the conflict.

The tense atmosphere enveloping the fortress left many feeling anxious. Some ordinary people even started gathering to discuss topics that seemed utterly ridiculous in the eyes of Serena and her group. It was as if they had taken it upon themselves to control who would be eligible for the first batch of injections.

Adam and his buddy took note of this chaos, and upon receiving a satellite call, Serena smiled slyly. The plan was working.

Adam had become a master at fanning the flames of discontent. His ability to stoke hatred towards Xie Jinghang had multiplied exponentially, to the point where ordinary folks now gritted their teeth at the mere mention of Xie’s name, completely ignoring that Adam was also an ability user—three out of five members of his family, to be exact.

Thanks to his child-like face and cheerful personality, he had successfully incited ordinary people to form an awakening society, vowing to fight for the benefits of being in the first injection batch.

Serena couldn’t fathom what leverage they had over the fortress. Was it merely through complaints? Who would care about their grievances without her?

The end times were unreasonable.

Casting a long line to catch a big fish, the entire situation was unfolding just as she had set it up. Xie Jinghang noticed unfamiliar figures sneaking up from the back mountain, reaching the fortress's outskirts, but there were no contacts in sight.

The snakes had stirred; they wouldn’t remain hidden for long.

This time, Fu Buqi was being overly cautious, but it wouldn’t matter—Serena had the confidence to strike decisively.

By the time four or five different methods of distributing the agents had spread through the fortress, even reaching out to relevant core members in the dead of night, the whispers about unspoken rules had emerged. After dragging everyone along for two more days, on the third morning, Serena launched a lottery event.

As soon as this was announced, Uncle Zhu’s fourth son felt a jolt of recognition; the idea seemed oddly familiar.

The lottery was simple: everyone would receive a card with a number. Only those who drew matching numbers would qualify to participate in the awakening program. However, having this qualification didn’t guarantee immediate access to the agents. The qualification was transferable; if someone drawn was an ability user or under eighteen, they could swap it for someone they deemed more suitable for the injection.

“Isn’t this just a lottery for car plates?” his friend muttered under his breath.

Adam nudged him and pointed to the stage where a large lottery box filled with numbered ping pong balls was being shaken before their very eyes.

It looked absurd and out of place, but with so much at stake, each ordinary person held their breath, hoping for a win. The ability users appeared indifferent on the surface, although they were secretly anxious.

Some astute individuals sensed something was amiss, though the specifics remained unclear.

The lottery quickly commenced and was over in no time. The ordinary winners were ecstatic, with a few from the Zhu family among them, jumping and cheering. Of course, there was a fifty-fifty chance that an ability user would be drawn. Adam had good luck; when he won, someone was already trying to get close to him. He had never felt so popular.

The old butler and Aunt Li were in the crowd, tasked with monitoring any suspicious behavior. Most of the winners decided to keep their winnings for themselves, while two ability users immediately passed their slots to family members, leaving three others to deliberate on who to share with.

Adam considered giving his slot to his mother or uncle, but his grandfather insisted that if his eldest son also became an ability user, the Zheng family’s skills would be lost. His mother’s health was fragile; she might not withstand the potential failure that came with awakening.

After the meeting was adjourned, Adam and the other three ability users found themselves surrounded, with people eager to pull them aside for a private chat.

Serena and her friend slipped away from the scene, leaving the stage to them.

Before long, someone rushed in with alarming news.

At that moment, Uncle Zhu was in a state of panic, never expecting a brawl would erupt within the fortress. Two groups had clashed, and his ordinarily docile fourth son had stabbed another winner. He couldn't believe his eyes; his fourth son was so extreme, envious of anyone else’s good fortune.

The injured man was already taken to the clinic for treatment, with his second brother, who had healing abilities, present. Unless it was a fatal wound, he would survive without a serious threat to his life.

The nature of the incident was grave, yet Uncle Zhu remained silent, refusing to defend himself.

Aside from the ability users, most ordinary people in the fortress had split into two factions, with members of the guard mixed among them. The rivalries were so intense that it felt as if they were ready to stomp on Serena’s face and declare a rebellion.

However, this was exactly what Serena wanted. She arranged for some instigators to stir the pot, fueling the conflict while separating the ringleaders for questioning.

Catching the pests was simple. Set the bait, stir the waters, and it would be clear who was jumping around. With Adam offering the awakening agents as a reward, the first person to report a troublemaker could directly receive an injection. No one cared about alliances or family ties anymore; they quickly turned on one another.

In the past few days, Serena had already sorted out the relationships among these individuals. With her mental prowess and enhanced senses, it was impossible for them to escape her notice. She was merely taking this opportunity to act with authority.

These people really wouldn’t learn; Adam recalled the actions of the Zhu family’s side branches in the past—how were they any different from today’s crowd?

Serena knew there were moles and traitors within the fortress, but she hadn’t anticipated there were so many. Fu Buqi’s ability to win hearts and manipulate minds had grown significantly.

To her surprise, some of these traitors even included family members of ability users. Serena scoffed; those who ate from both sides wouldn’t have a good life.

She called for Adam and gave him a few instructions. He nodded, and as night fell, he headed toward the lab.

At that moment, the satellite phone rang, and a familiar voice came through: 

“It’s time to prepare for action.”
