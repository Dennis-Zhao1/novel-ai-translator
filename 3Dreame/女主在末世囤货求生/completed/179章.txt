**Victory**

“Host, what are they doing? Why are they dragging this out? Look at the little fairy; she’s practically dying with impatience! Could it be that she’s fallen for you? That shouldn't be possible; she hasn’t even fallen for the charming and humorous me, so how could she possibly like the dull and boring you?” 

Xie Jinghang couldn’t open his eyes to see what was happening. He needed to act well in this play, hoping the self-absorbed chatterbox would just shut up and leave him alone. 

“Alright, I see I’ve hit a sore spot. I won’t say anything more. When you catch that bad guy, remember to call for the little fairy, okay? Brother Xuanjing has a way to deal with it.”

The chatterbox, for once, decided to be quiet. It was now Xie Jinghang’s eyes, helping him see what that fool across from him was doing, lost in thought. 

Fu Buqi finally moved. He reached out, and those mutated plants obediently delivered Xie Jinghang right to him. 

Luo Bingtian had already begun absorbing the crystal cores to replenish her powers while swiftly clearing the area. Unfortunately, she was still no match for Fu Buqi’s speed and could only watch helplessly as Xie Jinghang fell into Fu Buqi’s clutches. 

Suddenly, memories of her tragic past life surged through her mind, and a chaotic mix of emotions arose, ultimately coalescing into a desire to destroy everything in her path. 

At that moment, Fu Buqi had extended his hand, ready to seize Xie Jinghang by the throat. But before he could make contact, he was startled by the sight before him: Xie Jinghang’s eyes flew open, and somehow, his hands had slipped free from the vines that bound him. He grasped Fu Buqi’s wrist tightly. 

“System, what’s going on?” 

Fu Buqi’s first instinct was to shake Xie Jinghang off, then quickly seek help from the system. 

“Don’t worry, host. It’s likely that he suddenly awakened. I’ll attack him immediately.” 

The system’s calm response eased Fu Buqi’s nerves just a little. 

“Quick, call for the little fairy! Hurry!” 

Xie Jinghang shouted for Luo Bingtian. Upon hearing his voice, she hesitated for a moment before desperately moving toward where he was. 

Meanwhile, Fu Buqi summoned all his energy to command the mutated plants to attack the two of them. It was a battle reliant on timing. 

Luo Bingtian unleashed her psychic energy, obliterating countless crystal cores of the mutated plants and even extending her attack to the mutated insects. She seemed to have mastered this power instinctively. 

Luo Bingtian was on a rampage, while Fu Buqi was terrified. What was happening? Why couldn’t he control the mutated plants anymore? The mutated insects were no longer responding to his summons; it was all too strange. 

Just as his system seized control of the energy to counterattack, he found himself unable to move. 

Suddenly, a massive force began tearing at him, as if trying to rip the system away from Fu Buqi. 

“Stop! Ah…” 

In the midst of this three-way struggle, Luo Bingtian had arrived. The chatterbox had somehow joined forces with Xuanjing to bind and control Fu Buqi’s system, attempting to extract it completely. 

“Brother Xuanjing, now’s your chance!” 

The chatterbox seemed ecstatic. It also craved the system's energy; if it could devour it whole, it might evolve into its final form. The abundant energy would surely impress the mainframe. 

“This is far more energy than countless crystal cores and seeds combined, the mainframe will be overjoyed.” 

“Ah… Host! Fu Buqi, you must stop this! If I cease to exist, you’ll have nothing!” 

The system wailed in despair, never having expected that such a powerful unknown force existed in this world. 

Lost in its joyful dreams, the chatterbox failed to notice that Xuanjing had already consumed Fu Buqi’s system. 

Fu Buqi, like a dead dog, lost all of his powers, including his abilities. 

Miraculously, the mutated plants and insects that had been attacking them just moments ago suddenly turned to ash with a loud explosion, scattering like feathers across the ground. 

Luo Bingtian and Xie Jinghang were both dumbfounded at the sight. What in the world was happening? 

“Host, Brother Xuanjing is incredible! One strike and he annihilated the enemy’s system!” 

Xie Jinghang had no idea what had transpired; his primary concern was Luo Bingtian’s condition. 

Luo Bingtian swiftly crushed Fu Buqi’s chance to escape with just a flick of her hand, piercing his joints with ice spikes. 

In agony, he howled amidst the ash and dust. 

Just as Luo Bingtian was about to deliver the final blow, a voice resonated through the air like a celestial chime, captivating everyone present. 

“Luo Bingtian, bring these two into the space.” 

“That’s Brother Xuanjing’s voice! Ah, it’s so beautiful; my ears are pregnant with joy! Hahaha!” 

Both Luo and Xie stood in shock. What was going on? Wasn’t Xuanjing just a mirror? How could he produce sound? 

Despite their myriad of questions, Luo Bingtian took Xie Jinghang’s hand, dragging the almost lifeless Fu Buqi into the spatial realm. 

As soon as Fu Buqi entered this space, he was left in awe. He had never imagined this was not a mere spatial ability but a real existing space. He momentarily forgot the pain, but now, he lacked even the strength to sit up. 

“Luo Bingtian, we finally did it.” 

The celestial voice lingered throughout the space, omnipresent. 

On the screen, only the chatterbox’s text remained, cluttered with meaningless praise. 

“Xuanjing, what’s happening? You can suddenly speak, and it’s in voice form?” 

Luo Bingtian felt a strange shift, realizing that Xuanjing’s transformation was likely due to the absorption of Fu Buqi’s system capabilities. 

“This doomsday destruction system has been secretly siphoning the world’s fortune. The massive energy allows me to speak, and once I absorb it all, I should be able to take form.” 

“Wow! Brother Xuanjing is so powerful, capable of taking form! That’s amazing!” 

Still showering praise, the chatterbox flooded the screen with an array of emoticons, creating a dizzying display that resembled an enthusiastic fan club from a past life. 

“Doomsday destruction system?” 

Luo Bingtian questioned aloud. Why would it want to destroy this world? Was its sole purpose simply to bring about destruction? 

Both of them cast icy glares at the now immobile Fu Buqi, who wore a shocked expression. What doomsday destruction system? Wasn’t it supposed to be a doomsday counterattack system? 

Seeming to sense Fu Buqi’s confusion, Xuanjing spoke slowly. 

“Foolish and arrogant person, you were used without even realizing it. Did you still think the system you bound was something good?” 

“Wow, a soul-searching question! Brother Xuanjing, that was so powerful and incisive!” 

Having absorbed the destruction system, Xuanjing had gained not just energy but a wealth of knowledge. Facing the curiosity of Luo Bingtian and Xie Jinghang, he generously showcased it for them. 

The chatterbox’s text box shrank to a minimum, the sundial’s position also reduced, and soon, the screen displayed shocking and horrifying scenes, one after another.
