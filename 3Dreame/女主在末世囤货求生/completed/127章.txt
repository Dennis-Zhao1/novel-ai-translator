**The Return of the White Lotus**

The so-called secret that Luo Bingtin and Xie Jinghang had long suspected was connected to Fu Buqi. They never imagined it would be a plan to annihilate all of humanity's civilization. Coupled with his deceitful tactics of turning ability users into puppet warriors, it became clear that he aspired not to be a savior but a king of zombies.

What he was trying to create was the so-called new humans, right? The so-called savior spreading rumors outside was merely a tool he used to deceive the masses. No wonder he was so intent on disrupting the peace of the fortress; he wanted to first use the fortress's ability awakening potion to turn ordinary people into ability users, only to have them transformed into puppet warriors. His ambitions were truly grandiose. It was no surprise that he had sent undercover agents in with the sole purpose of gaining power, using the promise of strength as bait.

If it weren't for the fact that the two of them already knew Fu Buqi was not as clever as he thought, they might have fallen into his trap as well. Who wouldn't want to become stronger? Once everyone in the world became an ability user, the hierarchy would remain the same—those with stronger abilities would dominate the ordinary ones.

Luo Bingtin nodded and replied, “It's outrageous! He’s paving the way for his ambitions with the lives of everyone in the world. What good will it do him if everyone is dead? It’s utterly incomprehensible.”

“Exactly! I thought he already held significant power at the Kunshan base. My family and I were living happily until he destroyed everything,” Xie Jinghang said bitterly.

“Now that we're at this point, even if we cooperate and reach an agreement, will you be able to return safely to your father?” Xie Jinghang asked, hitting the critical question.

“It shouldn’t be a problem. I’ll just say you guys were experimenting on me and that I accidentally awakened my abilities and escaped. All the other ability users died, and I was the only survivor. Even if he doesn’t believe me, he won’t easily attack me. After all, I’m his only son.” He let out a cold laugh, recalling the unpleasant experiences, like an obsession gnawing at his mind, preventing him from moving on.

“Since you’ve made up your mind, let’s stay in the fortress for a few days. After you’ve been injected, you can go back. It’ll also give us a chance to test your father’s intentions,” Luo Bingtin quickly decided. This surprised Fu Kuandan; he thought this would take longer. After all, if he successfully awakened his abilities and was Fu Buqi's son, it wasn’t impossible for him to turn against him.

Arranging for someone to take Fu Kuandan down to rest, Xie Jinghang looked puzzled. “Do you really trust him enough to ally with him?”

“Why wouldn’t I? You’re acting strange; weren’t you the one who made contact with him first? Why are you questioning it now?”

“It’s not that I’m questioning; I just can’t be sure if he’ll really do that. After all, that’s his father.”

“I trust him. When he mentioned his father, there was no warmth at all—only hatred and disgust. He likely knows his father is insane; who knows when he might decide to get rid of him for being an ordinary person? If he doesn’t cooperate with us, what choice does he have? People like him always strike first.”

Nodding, they waited for the situation to unfold.

The news of Fu Kuandan’s capture spread, yet Fu Buqi didn’t make a move, seemingly having abandoned this son. Fu Kuandan’s expression turned solemn; it was hard to tell if he was disappointed or not.

After removing the hidden stakes Fu Buqi had planted, the remaining ordinary people all passed their physical exams and were scheduled to receive the ability awakening potion. The demand and storage for crystal cores were elevated to the agenda.

Outwardly, Xie Jinghang and Zhu Yidan continued to present themselves as traitors, keeping the outside world in a state of confusion. Even if Fu Buqi didn’t believe them, some bases were already stirring. During this time, Xie Jinghang had led a team to the Longxiang base, where they fulfilled their previous agreement: a major deal exchanging crystal cores for awakening potions.

Pei Qian happily invited Xie Jinghang and the others into the base. Some of his base members had also been brainwashed by the so-called savior, resulting in a loss of personnel. Originally a base of over five hundred people, it now had fewer than three hundred, with more than a hundred ordinary people being previous employees from Longxiang.

After understanding Fu Buqi’s scheme, Pei Qian was furious and desperately hoped to increase the number of ability users. They had stored a portion of the crystal cores, but it was far from enough to supply awakening potions to everyone. Xie Jinghang suggested a staggered awakening; the fortress also had around three hundred ordinary people waiting for injections, and they wouldn’t be able to supply the potions immediately.

In reality, it wasn’t that there weren’t enough raw materials; it was just that the lake water Luo Bingtin provided had unique components. Previously, Xie Jinghang had concocted a story about acquiring it accidentally. Even Dr. Zhang couldn’t replicate it, so they had to send Xie Jinghang out to search for it. Such rare items, even if Luo Bingtin could produce several large barrels in moments, still required some pretense to obtain.

This back-and-forth delayed the production of the potions, making them seem even more precious and rare.

“Captain Xie, thank you and Miss Luo for saving my life,” a fair-skinned woman with long straight hair and delicate features said, wearing a casual denim dress as she expressed her gratitude to Xie Jinghang in Pei Qian’s office.

Zhu Yidan, mistakenly thought to be Luo Bingtin, stared blankly as the woman bowed to her, immediately jumping up from the sofa to hide to the side. “I’m not her! You’ve got the wrong person!”

Pei Qian chuckled softly, pulling the woman’s hand to sit next to him on the sofa, introducing her, “Shang Shang, this is Miss Zhu Yidan. Miss Luo is busy and couldn’t make it.”

“Oh, so it’s Miss Zhu! It’s truly a pleasure to finally meet you,” Shang Shang replied, but her tone rose oddly, causing Zhu Yidan and the people nearby to exchange confused glances.

“Captain Xie, you sure are lucky! But your taste seems lacking,” Shang Shang remarked, attacking without discrimination, just as Pei Qian’s powers did. Xie Jinghang was left speechless.

Just as he was about to explain, he remembered that this was a mission and also a smoke screen. Zhu Yidan opened her mouth, then closed it again, mentally berating herself for meddling and putting herself in a difficult position.

Talk about social death.

“Alright, Shang Shang, you should go rest. Captain Xie and I have some important matters to discuss,” Pei Qian quickly interjected, sensing the awkward atmosphere and wanting to send Shang Shang away before it worsened and jeopardized their alliance.

“Hmph! You men are all the same—looking at what’s in front of you while eyeing what’s in the pot!” Shang Shang huffed, shaking off Pei Qian’s hand, glaring at both him and Xie Jinghang before storming out.

Pei Qian forced a smile, trying to explain, “I apologize for the scene. Please don’t take it to heart.”

Xie Jinghang picked up on something, teasingly asking, “Pei, did you just have a major slip-up?”

After all, Xie Jinghang and Luo Bingtin were merely seen as helpers to Shang Shang. Such a strong reaction could hardly be attributed to him.

Pei Qian laughed awkwardly, lowering his voice, “My former deputy’s cousin came to the base not long ago. Unfortunately, my deputy sacrificed himself long ago, and I thought I should treat his only family well. I gave her some privileges and attention, but now she’s upset.”

As Pei Qian spoke, he seemed to recall his fallen deputy, letting out a sigh.

Xie Jinghang understood this feeling and didn’t press further. Meanwhile, Zhu Yidan rolled her eyes skyward. After just being reprimanded, she discovered she was merely a scapegoat. It was outrageous how casually they described a girl’s attempts to curry favor—it was pathetic.

At this moment, as Shang Shang angrily prepared to return to her room, she unexpectedly encountered someone she disliked the most. If Luo Bingtin had been present, she would have immediately recognized the world-renowned saintly figure who loved to compete with women while dragging others down—none other than the perfect little white lotus.
