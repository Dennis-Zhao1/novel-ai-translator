**The Little Pig Faces the Old Fox**

This was the unique mark of the Luo family, a symbol of the connections that Grandpa had left for himself. At first, Luo Bingtin thought that Zhu Yidan had spoken to the elders about these matters, but she never expected that the Zhu family was actually one of the protective charms in this scenario. No wonder Zhu Yidan had suddenly returned to the country and was so cooperative with her.

Suppressing the bitterness rising in her chest, Luo Bingtin raised her head slightly and smiled. “Grandpa Zhu, I can say what I think, but there are too many people in this room, and it’s not very convenient.”

As soon as she said this, aside from Grandpa Zhu, all the other elders were taken aback, quickly realizing that Luo Bingtin really didn’t understand etiquette. The younger generation of families like theirs had been taught since childhood to be polite and respectful, especially when visiting others’ homes. To say something like this was quite inappropriate.

Grandpa Zhu didn’t give his sons and grandsons a chance to lecture her; instead, he smiled and asked, “Then who do you think is suitable to stay?”

Luo Bingtin, feeling confident and unyielding, replied firmly, “Grandpa Zhu, Uncle Zhu, and Young Uncle Zhu—only you three are suitable.”

With Grandpa Zhu present, the others didn’t dare voice any objections. Not a single disapproving glance was cast toward Luo Bingtin as they silently left the study, with the last one out even thoughtfully closing the door behind them.

Uncle Zhu, knowing the situation, took a seat at the tea table and began brewing tea for the others. The study fell into a quiet hush, interrupted only by the soft hissing of the boiling water.

Grandpa Zhu didn’t rush her; he held his cane and gazed at Luo Bingtin. She placed her folder back on the tea table, adopting a serious tone as she said, “Grandpa Zhu, let’s hurry and stockpile supplies; the apocalypse is coming.”

At this statement, the room fell into stunned silence.

Grandpa Zhu was fine; after all, he had weathered many storms in his lifetime. But the expressions on Uncle Zhu and Young Uncle Zhu's faces were nothing short of shock. However, they wouldn’t dismiss Luo Bingtin’s words as a joke.

While others might have been confused, Young Uncle Zhu was the most like Grandpa Zhu in his youth—sharp-eyed, resourceful, bold yet meticulous. Unlike his elder brother, who dedicated himself to biological sciences and innovation, he had the innate sharpness of a businessman.

Thus, Luo Bingtin’s elaborate and flashy maneuvers appeared to Grandpa Zhu and Young Uncle Zhu as mere show. The underlying actions were simply quick asset liquidation, with the cash flow remaining a mystery. 

It was precisely because they couldn’t trace it that Grandpa Zhu had his speculations. He even wondered if Luo Bingtin had been enchanted by some man and had been swindled out of her wealth. Little did he expect that this was the reason behind her actions.

The apocalypse had been predicted by scientists hundreds of years ago, yet no one took it seriously. So how did Luo Bingtin come to such a conclusion?

Young Uncle Zhu posed the question, and Luo Bingtin found herself at a loss for words. How could she explain? Rebirth? That was absurd. The apocalypse was already far-fetched enough; adding rebirth into the mix seemed ridiculous, especially since these three weren’t avid readers of web novels.

After pondering for a moment, Luo Bingtin countered with a question for Grandpa Zhu. “Grandpa Zhu, are you aware of the numerous ancient texts in my family’s library?”

Grandpa Zhu hadn’t expected such a question and nodded instinctively.

Luo Bingtin continued, “You know how our Luo family came to be. Our main family used to be associated with metaphysics. It wasn’t until my grandfather’s generation that we started dealing in jewelry.”

Grandpa Zhu nodded again; the elders still alive were aware that the Luo family had originally served in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau, which dealt with astronomical calculations and divination.

“Our Luo family is still a branch of metaphysics, and we have some knowledge that isn’t meant for outsiders. The origins of the apocalypse prophecy I mentioned aren’t something for others to know.”

“Those willing to believe will believe, and those unwilling to believe can’t be forced. So, Grandpa Zhu, do you believe me?”

Luo Bingtin felt she could say no more. Belief was ultimately up to them.

After a moment of contemplation, Grandpa Zhu’s voice was slightly strained as he asked, “What does your apocalypse look like?”

“Humans devouring each other, rising from the dead, free from disease and pain, immortal and indestructible.”

“That sounds like zombies,” Young Uncle Zhu, the youngest among them, remarked, logically connecting the dots.

Luo Bingtin nodded. “It could be explained scientifically—humans are forced to evolve. Some succeed and become what we call ‘superhumans,’ while others fail and become the so-called ‘zombies.’ But the apocalypse will undoubtedly come; it is a globally catastrophic event. Whether other disasters will follow, I do not know.”

Upon hearing this, everyone fell silent. Grandpa Zhu was unsure how to respond, while Uncle Zhu and Young Uncle Zhu remained skeptical. 

Such apocalyptic talk was often dismissed as an overused trope in online fiction. They’d rather believe that she had some cunning business strategy at play, which seemed more credible.

However, contrary to everyone’s expectations, Grandpa Zhu believed her—not only did he believe, but he also hurriedly inquired about the specific timing and nature of the apocalypse.

His two sons stood by, dumbfounded.

Grandpa Zhu’s belief had its roots in history. The Zhu family and the Luo family had once served in the court together. The Luo family had predicted a calamity that would befall the Zhu family a hundred years later, but at the time, no one believed it. Only the Zhu family head, who had close ties with the head of the Luo family, took it seriously.

Some were unconvinced and split off to form their own branch, while the Zhu family head turned to commerce, never returning to court. A century later, the predicted calamity struck, and the branch that remained in court was wiped out. Had the Zhu family head’s branch not separated nearly a hundred years prior and given away much of their wealth, they too would have fallen victim.

Grandpa Zhu had witnessed the true capabilities of the Luo family’s descendants. After the decline of the main family, the Luo branch was left with only a single daughter, as ancient customs valued male heirs for lineage. The Luo family branch was essentially severed.

Seeing the Luo family reduced to this state, even if Grandpa Zhu didn’t want to believe, he couldn’t convince himself that there was any better reason for Luo Bingtin’s actions.

Now, if Luo Bingtin claimed that her ancestors had appeared in a dream, he would believe it.

Having accepted the notion of the apocalypse, the next steps were clear: conserve strength and stockpile supplies.

Even trees shed their leaves to survive the winter; some willingly sacrifice their flourishing branches in order to protect their roots. When spring arrives, the leaves will grow back, and the tree will once again be lush and vibrant.

Families with a history spanning centuries understand this principle best: preserving the roots is paramount before discussing anything else.

Luo Bingtin didn’t expect to convince Grandpa Zhu so easily. There had been too many bizarre occurrences in her life that she couldn’t explain truthfully; the outcome was what mattered. 

Thus, when Grandpa Zhu asked her how she was currently organizing things, Luo Bingtin awkwardly pulled out her phone and opened a certain blue app, clicking on the post from a specific user she had saved.

Young Uncle Zhu was left speechless. 

Internally, Luo Bingtin thought, *This is so embarrassing; I’ve been caught copying homework!*

Grandpa Zhu asked Young Uncle Zhu to print it out directly, squinting through his reading glasses as he examined it closely.

“This mind map is indeed astonishing; it categorizes different situations in detail and comprehensively,” Young Uncle Zhu commented.

“This is a bit much. Even with our wealth, this isn’t something ordinary people can manage,” Uncle Zhu questioned.

Grandpa Zhu, however, remained the most composed. “Ordinary people have their own ways of living; we should first consider our own situation.”
