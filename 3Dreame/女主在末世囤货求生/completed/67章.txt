**Conspiracy Brews**

The news quickly spread throughout the fortress, bringing joy to everyone. It felt like an added layer of security; they knew their fortress was incredibly safe. At least since moving in, no zombies had been spotted inside—except for those they had captured during missions. They were prolonging their lives and humanity's, reducing the risks they faced. This was the significance of science, Adam Song thought as he chatted excitedly with Leo Sterling, overwhelmed with happiness.

Unbeknownst to him, those around him were watching with pained expressions. Serena Zhou, too, was learning for the first time just how difficult things had been for Adam. Leo had revealed the funding details for establishing the apocalyptic fortress, deepening Adam's suspicions but, more importantly, stirring a sense of sympathy in him for the young girl who had lost both her parents and her only remaining relative, her grandfather.

She wasn’t in a position where she could rely on others and face bullying. It felt truly unfair that those who were meant to uphold justice often played favorites. The girl had it really tough. People often said that true feelings could only be exchanged for true feelings, but Adam realized that what Adam received in return might not be genuine at all.

Fortunately, Adam was quick to adjust; she didn’t mind the lost supplies. She had plenty in her space, after all. If she ran out, she could always gather more or, if necessary, plant crops in her space—after all, it was just a matter of sowing some seeds.

That day was New Year's Day, and Grandpa Zhu had decided to host a gathering in the cafeteria for everyone to welcome the new year together. It felt as if there were no barriers between them, like one big family. Adam's table was filled with his brothers, Leo, and An Min.

Adam was seated at the main table with Grandpa Zhu, looking every bit the polite and humble young lady, engaging in toasts and conversations that felt quite forced. After sharing a drink with Leo amidst the cheers of their friends, Adam found herself in a whirlwind of merriment. Children ran around, and the Zheng family sat with the old butler, Liu Xiaohui, all of them wearing smiles, lost in the joyous atmosphere.

Was it really as seamless as a family, with no barriers? Adam downed her drink, contemplating.

After New Year's, the snowfall intensified. Winters in Kyoto often came with relentless snowfalls, with each storm leaving drifts up to calf-deep. Since the apocalypse began, the weather had turned extremely erratic, starting with snow in November, and now it rarely stopped. Fortunately, the organization had initiated a snow shoveling routine twice daily, exempting only those over sixty and under fifteen; everyone else had to pitch in.

The snow was shoveled into low-lying areas to prevent water from flooding the ground when it melted. Even if it froze again, it wouldn’t create a slipping hazard. Adam was also shoveling snow, puffing and panting. She couldn’t remember if it had snowed for this long in her past life, and as time passed in her rebirth, her memories of her previous life faded considerably. The only constants were her feelings of hatred and guilt.

As she observed the young people laughing and the middle-aged people working diligently, a sense of satisfaction welled up inside Adam. Leo and Adam took turns snatching the shovel and dustpan from her, insisting she go inside to warm up. The two had developed a stronger camaraderie since their last shared struggle; if Leo hadn’t started dating Liu Xiaohui, Adam would have thought about shipping them.

As Adam walked towards the office hall, shaking off the snow that clung to her, she thickened her skin to take a breather while everyone else continued shoveling. A gust of wind rustled past her, carrying hushed whispers that drifted to her ears, snippets of words that didn’t form a coherent sentence.

Curious, she glanced in the direction the wind came from, but all she could see were people focused on their task, with no one else around. Blinking, she shrugged it off.

Chinese New Year was fast approaching. Since New Year’s Day, heavy snowfall had disrupted operations at the base. The hydroelectric generators had frozen and were no longer functioning. Now, the fortress relied on solar panels for electricity, but winter sunlight was limited, and the photovoltaic power couldn’t support too many devices.

It was essential to ensure that the checkpoints and laboratories had enough power, followed by the cafeteria and dormitories. The office building and training grounds had to be shut down, and other scattered facilities like surveillance systems and warehouses had their power restricted.

After Adam had a meeting with Grandpa Zhu, he waved his hand decisively, ordering non-essential departments to rotate shifts in the cafeteria, while other work would resume once the snow melted and hydroelectric power was restored. The vital functions remained security patrols and checkpoint guarding, with Uncle Zhu personally managing the guards. The patrols were now overseen by another son of Grandpa Zhu, the fourth son from the previous core power center.

The weather was drearily overcast, and after a brief two-day respite, the snow began to fall again. During this time, most people stayed indoors, avoiding work, and some would rather wrap themselves in blankets and sleep all day. Adam had taken to sleeping until ten in the morning, as she spent her nights in her space training her body. With Adam running out of techniques to learn from Leo, she turned to the ancient texts passed down in her family.

Initially, she sought to kill time, regretting that before the apocalypse, she had focused solely on stockpiling supplies, gear, and weapons, neglecting to gather books, movies, and other reading materials. She had even finished the agricultural books she planned to use to teach others how to farm. Now, with her photographic memory, she didn’t need to reread to reinforce her knowledge; she simply had to occupy herself with the ancient texts.

While everyone else was unable to bathe, resorting to wiping down with cloths, Adam could swim freely in the river in her space, take hot showers in her RV, or even enjoy a bath—though that required boiling water, which was a hassle she was too lazy to deal with. The space remained unchanged, a constant temperature that always made Adam shed her outer layers upon entering and put them back on before leaving. She couldn’t complain, as the mirror had long been begging for an upgrade, which she interpreted as the mirror being 'hungry.'

She felt guilty for not having anything to offer the mirror; she couldn’t bear to part with her prized sword, so for now, the mirror would just have to stay hungry.

The snow continued to fall heavily without pause. The piles they had shoveled didn’t just remain; they had compacted into towering ice mounds, requiring two people to encircle with their arms. Adam sometimes wandered out at night when she couldn’t sleep, her worry growing.

Everyone was used to piling the snow in one spot after shoveling, but with the mound freezing solid, she worried: if the snow melted, those ice blocks could fall and injure a child. Adam found herself constantly fretting, but what could she do with such a massive ice mound?

With her hands clasped behind her back, Adam strolled around the ice mound. Seizing the cover of night, she reached out and retrieved the ice mound into her space. Problem solved, hazard eliminated—time to head back to bed.

Just as she raised her leg to leave, a series of faint sounds broke the quiet night. Perhaps with the removal of that large ice mound, distant sounds became clearer. Adam stood still, intrigued by the fact that someone was out chatting in the cold so late. After listening for a while, chills ran down her spine as she distinctly heard the words "Kunshan Base."
