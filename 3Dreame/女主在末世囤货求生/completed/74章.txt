**Power and Corruption**

A man with yellow hair grinned maliciously as he toyed with the gun in his hand, occasionally glancing back at the women in the van, his thoughts a mystery to everyone. 

Lo Bingting felt a strong instinct telling her he was most likely a psychopath, if not outright stupid. She managed to conceal her gaze and successfully entered the Maple Grove Villa District.

The vehicle sped along, showing no signs of slowing, and they hadn’t encountered any areas overrun by zombies. It seemed the route was either regularly cleaned or, like her, they had some sort of cheat to avoid danger. While she leaned towards the first assumption, the second wasn't entirely out of the question; this world was filled with absurdities.

She took a moment to scrutinize the security of the villa area. The walls were reinforced with metal sheets and wooden boards, wrapped several times in thorny barbed wire, standing around three meters high. The iron gate had also been fortified with metal and barbed wire, and there were numerous spike shields made of rebar positioned at the entrance, creating a formidable barrier. Once they passed through the gate, there were two more checkpoints, manned by armed guards who all seemed shady, with either bulging muscles or unkempt appearances. Their equipment was mismatched, projecting a disorganized air.

As the vehicle approached, the guards leaned against the window, peering in with lascivious grins, causing the women in the back to scream in fright. Lo Bingting, already wedged into a corner, felt herself being pushed and squeezed, almost flattening against the van's wall. The ropes binding her hands didn’t impede her ability to access her supplies from the spatial pocket she possessed, but she chose to remain inconspicuous.

The inspection at the entrance was casual, more about the lewd smiles of the guards than any real scrutiny. The yellow-haired man urged them to hurry along; he had important information to report to his boss, clearly irritated by the ravenous behavior of the guards eyeing the women hungrily.

One of the guards, a rotund figure, took his sweet time, which only fueled the impatience of the yellow-haired man. Eventually, the guard yanked open the van's door and lunged at the nearest woman. 

Furrowing his brow, the yellow-haired man didn’t intervene, as if this were standard procedure. He cast a disdainful glance at the guard, urging him on. “Wang Laoqi, hurry up! Big Brother is waiting for my report.”

Wang Laoqi didn’t reply, merely grunting in acknowledgment. Even if he couldn’t have his fill, the opportunity was too tempting to pass up. With so many beautiful women around, if he didn’t seize the moment, he might not get another chance.

The woman who was tackled shrieked in terror, thrashing her limbs in a desperate attempt to escape. The guards yelled at her to shut up, one of them slapping her across the face, causing her head to slam against the van’s interior, leaving her lip bloodied and bruised. A knife gleamed ominously as it was thrust near her head, rendering her defenseless, leaving her to endure whatever the guards wanted to do.

The remaining women huddled together in fear, trembling like quail. Wang Laoqi, not satisfied with the chaos, saw the woman beneath him no longer resisting, curled up and trembling with her eyes shut in submission, and began to unbuckle his belt.

Lo Bingting, hidden in the far corner, was out of reach of the guards, but she could see everything clearly. This thug was intent on committing assault right there. These men, taking advantage of the lawlessness of the apocalypse, brazenly exploited women, and as anger and hatred surged within her, she recalled her own past experiences, her rationality slipping away under the weight of fury.

“Wang Laoqi, that’s enough. Just a few touches will do. The last girl you had died that night, and I got scolded by Brother Luo for it,” the yellow-haired man complained as he yanked Wang Laoqi away, not even glancing at the abused woman before slamming the van door shut.

“Don’t waste my brother’s time. Next time, there will be leftovers for you to enjoy,” he said, pushing Wang Laoqi aside before hopping into the passenger seat, signaling the driver to move.

The abused woman clutched her injured face, being helped to lean against the van's wall, sobbing quietly as she wrapped her arms around herself. The yellow-haired man cast a cold glance back, barking a few orders for her to shut up, and the van fell silent once more.

As they drove back, the sky was still bright, allowing Lo Bingting to observe the layout of the villa district clearly. Originally, she only intended to kill Fu Buqi; now, she wanted to eliminate them all. 

Destruction! Let them all die! These thoughts raced through her mind with increasing speed, oddly calming her even as they swirled.

The vehicle veered past the most extravagant standalone villas in the central area, heading toward the more secluded row houses, which were primarily scattered around the outskirts. The central area was likely where Fu Buqi or the core members of the base resided.

When the vehicle finally stopped, the yellow-haired man called a few others over, dragging the women out of the van one by one and handing them over to a man with a bushy beard. 

“Zhang Ye, here are today’s captures. There are a few good ones in here,” he grinned, “Brother Luo said to keep an eye out for leftovers.”

The man, referred to as Zhang Ye, fiddled with a beautifully crafted ivory bracelet, casually glancing over the line of women and nodding.

“This batch is indeed decent. You’ve worked hard. I’m aware of Brother Luo’s situation, and I’ll notify you when the opportunity arises,” he said.

The yellow-haired man leaned closer, whispering a few things to Zhang Ye, even pulling out a gun he had found to demonstrate. Zhang Ye remained silent, turning to look at the captured women with a gaze that was both indifferent and contemptuous.

It was clear that Zhang Ye wasn’t part of the same faction as the yellow-haired man. He seemed to be connected to the collectibles and antique trade, as evidenced by that conspicuous ivory piece; it was undoubtedly smuggled and poached, a valuable item before the apocalypse. Anyone knowledgeable would recognize its worth, not just because of the ban on ivory but also due to its rarity and quality.

Lo Bingting lowered her eyes, observing Zhang Ye as he walked back and forth, casually pointing out a few women and instructing those around him. “These few need to be sent to the main building tonight. Make the arrangements, and don’t let anything go wrong.”

Lo Bingting realized she was among those chosen. She looked up to see that both Little Saint and Sister Fengyun were included as well.

Determined to figure out what was happening, she obediently followed the others without needing to be pulled along. Those who comply are always treated better; loudmouths like Little Saint only dug their own graves with their bravado.

They were led into the first floor of the row house, where six girls were locked in a single room together. Little Saint immediately started whispering to the unfamiliar girls about how they would escape.

Lo Bingting felt fortunate to be beside Sister Fengyun, a calm and quiet presence. 

Before Little Saint could finish her plans, the door swung open, and a group of stylishly dressed men and women filed in, carrying makeup kits and beauty supplies. 

Two burly women followed behind them, immediately grabbing one girl to drag her off for a shower in the bathroom. They didn’t wash them all at once; it seemed they were taking the dirtiest ones first. A girl with long hair down to her waist, looking clean but disheveled, was the first to be yanked inside, treated roughly and quickly, with no room for resistance.

Just then, a woman dressed in a chic Hong Kong-style outfit entered. Her makeup was striking, and she wore a velvet qipao with a cashmere shawl draped over her shoulders. She scanned the room, her gaze pausing on Lo Bingting as if she recognized her.

Lo Bingting met her gaze, confirming she didn’t know the woman. 

The woman’s attention shifted to another girl, who had kept her head down, and after observing her for a while, she approached and lifted the girl’s chin, smiling. 

“Wow, they even caught a celebrity. Those yellow-haired men are quite clever, aren’t they?” 

Lo Bingting looked over, recognizing the pale face with red nail polish; the girl seemed somewhat familiar, but she couldn’t place her.

She had never paid much attention to entertainment news, never chased after stars, and after five years in the apocalypse, she had been too busy stockpiling supplies to remember. 

“Li... Li Jie,” the girl looked at her with hopeful eyes, wanting to say something but then falling silent.

Sister Li chuckled disdainfully, releasing the girl’s chin. “No matter who you were before—celebrity, rich heiress—once you’re here, you’re at my mercy. If you’ve got the guts, climb your way up and survive. If not...” 

Her soft, alluring voice sent chills down their spines.
