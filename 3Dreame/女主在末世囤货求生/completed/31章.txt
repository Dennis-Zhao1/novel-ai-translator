The Charm of Spicy Strips

Chris gazed calmly at the man across from him, expressionless as he nodded slightly. "Where there's business, there's profit. You can't turn your back on money, right? My brother."

The man in the suit raised an eyebrow, seemingly taken aback by Chris's words, as if it were the first time he had heard him speak like that. Without further ado, he gestured for his subordinate to bring over the goods. Luo Bingtin opened the package she always carried, pulling out the order details, while actually retrieving items from her spatial storage, handing the documents to her bodyguard, Meng Ge.

Now it made sense why they had chosen such a spacious office; a smaller place simply wouldn't suffice. The guards standing against the wall understood too—so many real firearms were at play here, all to prevent anyone from making a move during the inspection. It wasn't uncommon for betrayals to occur in the underground world, and after years of being a broker, Chris had seen his fair share.

This batch of goods was larger than usual, and the inspection took longer than expected, almost pushing into dinner time. Fortunately, after Meng Ge quickly verified everything, Luo Bingtin personally sealed the boxes, applying the unique Luo family's seal in front of them. This was also the first time Chris had seen it, and indeed, it was quite distinctive.

The man in the suit also raised an eyebrow, likely realizing Luo Bingtin's identity—a wealthy Chinese. This time, it was the suit-clad man’s group that was responsible for delivering the goods to the port. The Zhu family’s representatives were already prepared. Once all the boxes were loaded into a container, Luo Bingtin and the Zhu family members counted everything before sealing and locking the door.

She couldn't afford to let the Zhu family's goods be stored in her space; it would easily reveal her secret. As everyone waited for the Zhu family to pay the remaining balance, Luo Bingtin discreetly observed the man standing next to her. Chris looked nothing like his brother; his Middle Eastern features starkly contrasted with his brother's pure Caucasian appearance. Moreover, there was an unspoken distance between them. They called each other brother, yet it was evident they were not fond of each other.

Soon, the subordinates confirmed that the final payment had been received. Chris's brother nodded at Luo Bingtin before leading his people away. Chris didn’t seem to mind; he watched as Luo Bingtin answered two phone calls before driving her to the next location.

Though she felt a bit curious, she wasn't the nosy type. She could guess the brothers' situation without too much imagination. If Chris was backing a weapons family, then many things would start to make sense—operating in both the light and dark, quite reasonable.

The car headed straight to the city center, and the beautiful scenery of the wealthy Saudi streets was striking. As they approached the agreed-upon time, Luo Bingtin felt a little embarrassed; they hadn’t set aside any time for dinner. She thought to herself that she’d either have to make the most of it or treat Chris to a nice meal to thank him for his hard work.

Soon, they arrived at a high-rise building's parking lot. As soon as they parked, someone came to greet them, leading them directly to the top floor. Luo Bingtin noticed Meng Ge's alertness heightened again; it seemed this place was not simple either.

The tension eased slightly when they were met by a Middle Eastern beauty as their guide. They approached what resembled a corporate lobby, where the beauty used facial recognition to unlock the door. A male secretary took over from there to continue leading them.

Luo Bingtin felt a wave of indifference wash over her. Suddenly, she heard what sounded like DJ music. This was different from what she had imagined. She had expected a serious transaction or a meeting with some underground clientele, but now it seemed they were headed to a party at the top of a Saudi company?

Upon arrival, the scene before her was unexpected—several Saudi men surrounded by beautiful women, drinking and dancing. One man raised a wine glass in one hand while scattering cash from a box his subordinate held in the other. Were they on drugs? Luo Bingtin glanced at Chris, who appeared unfazed, patiently waiting for the secretary to report to the leading Saudi man.

Well, they were already here; how much more absurd could it get? Once the DJ lowered the volume, Luo Bingtin was welcomed inside, and Chris greeted several men, signaling Meng Ge to open the suitcase and display the jewelry.

The Saudi men lounged around with women, their eyes widening in shock as the jewelry boxes filled the coffee table. It was as if they had just brought a jewelry store right to them. Foreigners tended to prefer colorful gemstone jewelry, while Saudis often favored gold or gold with colorful stones. 

Chris likely hadn’t anticipated that Luo Bingtin would bring such a significant amount of jewelry to sell. In his experience, he knew that many of these pieces would be better suited for auction houses. The leading Saudi man, clearly knowledgeable about jewelry, wiped the nonchalant expression off his face upon seeing the goods. He signaled for his subordinates to turn off the music and switched the colorful ambient lights to standard white.

As they scrutinized the merchandise, Luo Bingtin didn’t rush them. She took out her phone to send a message back home. It must have been the middle of the night there, but Uncle Zhu was probably still awake due to his busy schedule.

Once she finished communicating with Uncle Zhu, the leading Saudi man seemed to have made some judgments about the jewelry. He switched to English to talk to Luo Bingtin, which didn’t surprise her. It was basic for businessmen, especially jewelers, to speak English.

He casually stated that all of the items were for sale, and then he began stroking his well-groomed beard, deep in thought. After a moment, he called over a middle-aged man and instructed him to evaluate the items carefully.

The middle-aged man was clearly experienced, his hands and eyes working in tandem as he examined the pieces. He jotted down notes with paper and pen. Even though he was fast, there were still dozens of trays of goods, and Luo Bingtin couldn’t help but lean over to Chris and whisper, “Do you want some Spicy Strips?”

Chris suddenly remembered he had skipped dinner, but he didn’t know what Spicy Strips were. Luo Bingtin pulled out a red package with Chinese characters printed on it from her bag. The picture didn’t reveal much until she tore it open, squeezing out a stick drenched in chili oil.

She gestured for Chris to take one, following suit by grabbing a stick for herself and popping it into her mouth. No matter what they say about rich kids not eating this, after the apocalypse, you wouldn't be able to find anything even if you wanted to.

Chris hesitated, unsure, but Luo Bingtin reassured him, “It’s vegetarian, made from soybeans. You can eat it safely.”

Finally, Chris copied Luo Bingtin’s action and tried it. The flavor was heavy on the spice and sweet, a bit tough to chew, but he couldn’t deny that the more he chewed, the more delicious it became. Turning around, he noticed Luo Bingtin handing one to the bodyguard standing behind them.

The culinary culture of the Chinese was indeed unique. Chris, who rarely snacked, realized he had opened a door to a whole new world. The key? A stick of Spicy Strips.

The Saudi man seated at the center noticed their little exchange. Seizing the chance while others were distracted, he subtly shifted to sit beside Luo Bingtin. “What are you eating? Is it good?” he asked, staring at the Spicy Strips packaging.

“It’s delicious! Want to try one?” Luo Bingtin generously offered him a stick.

Before long, three people were seated at one corner of the room, all munching on Spicy Strips. “Is this food from your country? The flavors are quite rich,” the Saudi man remarked, seemingly not used to spicy food. After one bite, his mouth swelled a bit, prompting him to signal his subordinate for some wine to help ease the heat.

“It’s traditional cuisine from our country; everyone who tries it loves it,” Luo Bingtin replied, nodding as she continued to devour one after another. Chris, having eaten three, felt he couldn’t indulge any further; they were too addictive.

Once the Saudi man regained his composure, he requested another stick, only to find the package empty. Luo Bingtin was already wiping her fingers clean. 

That lingering feeling of wanting more was unfortunate; the Saudi man still craved more. “Is there any left?”

Luo Bingtin didn’t answer directly but instead said, “We haven’t had dinner yet; this is our meal.”

The Saudi man understood and instructed a subordinate to arrange for more food. He then turned back to Luo Bingtin, asking, “Is there more of that?” 

Luo Bingtin knew they’d surely have something delicious soon. Feeling generous, she reached into her bag and pulled out another pack of Spicy Strips, handing the entire package to the Saudi man.

Before long, a two-tiered serving cart was pushed in, and the subordinate began placing plates filled with seafood in front of Luo Bingtin.

Wow, a seafood feast! This business deal was turning out quite well, maximizing the value of a pack of Spicy Strips.

Meng Ge, the bodyguard, looked at Luo Bingtin with newfound respect—she was indeed a commercial genius. Luo Bingtin invited Chris and Meng Ge to join her for the meal, while the Saudi man, clutching the Spicy Strips, shifted his seat closer to the beauties.

The late dinner filled the three with happiness, as dishes of lobster and abalone significantly boosted their joy. Luo Bingtin suddenly realized she had forgotten to stock up on seafood; it was important to remember that one couldn’t skimp on good food, especially since she wouldn’t let herself miss out on such an opportunity.
