**You’ve Dirtied My Eyes**

Not only was Luo Bingting suspicious of the other party's intentions, but Meng also grew wary. A proper soldier would never invite others to join in on a mission. What were they up to? Did they want to use them to draw the zombies away and preserve their own strength? 

It wasn't paranoia; in this apocalyptic world, the rules had become chaotic. Only those who had yet to grasp the grim reality still acted as if everything was normal. Luo had seen too much darkness, and his wariness of people was no less than Luo Bingting's. 

Meng rejected the proposal outright and bluntly stated that their mission was too dangerous. The other party had survivors with them, and it would be unjust to drag them into the fray. After saying this, he glanced over at the three women standing in the corner. Green Tea Zheng and Sally immediately nodded in agreement; they didn't want to run around either—they just wanted to leave and get home quickly.

“Captain Xie, I... we really need to prioritize safety. Let’s get out of here sooner rather than later,” Green Tea Zheng said, approaching Captain Xie with a pitiful and frightened expression.

Luo Bingting suppressed her murderous intent, unwilling to stir up trouble, but she couldn't help but shoot daggers at Green Tea Zheng with her eyes. The urge to blow her away was intense, yet she didn't want her to die so easily. If she missed this opportunity, who knew when she'd encounter her again? What if, like in her past life, she ended up cozying up to that beast Fu Buqi?

Then again, if they were going to cozy up, she'd deal with both of them—why would she fear their partnership?

Perhaps the negative emotions in her gaze were too evident, as Captain Xie keenly noticed, shifting his gaze between Luo Bingting and Green Tea Zheng several times.

Sally, who was used to confronting Green Tea Zheng, seized the moment, “Fan Zhengzheng, don’t you find it disgusting? Being with you is the least safe. Who knows if you’ll suddenly push someone into the zombies' mouths again?”

Green Tea Zheng had been gazing affectionately at Captain Xie, but upon hearing this, she looked even more aggrieved. Lowering her head, she replied in a soft voice, “I didn’t! I told you I didn’t. Don’t slander me!”

In that moment, Luo Bingting thought of a clever solution and addressed Sally, “If you don’t want to be with her, you can come with us. Just kill this Green Tea girl, and I promise your safety. I can tell you’re not fond of her either, and you can take revenge for that guy Wang Tao.”

Luo Bingting spoke in a teasing tone, but the content shocked everyone. Green Tea Zheng's face went blank with disbelief, instinctively hiding behind Captain Xie, who happened to be her shield. She exclaimed in surprise, “Miss Luo, why are you targeting me? I’ve never offended you! Just because I’m wealthy, I can’t do as I please?”

Luo Bingting looked at her phony, pretentious face, feeling nauseated. “Do I need a reason to kill you? You’ve dirtied my eyes—doesn’t that count?”

Luo Bingting adopted the demeanor of a wealthy, spoiled girl, unbothered that she was recognized. After all, she was a woman who had made headlines multiple times.

“Don’t joke around. I can’t allow indiscriminate killing here,” Captain Xie said, discreetly brushing off Green Tea Zheng’s hand that was wrapped around his arm.

Luo Bingting scoffed; she was merely digging a pit for Green Tea Zheng. If they faced any danger later, Sally would undoubtedly blame Green Tea Zheng, who would cling to those special forces like a lifeline. With such dead weight, why would they fear them getting in their way?

Meng also didn’t want to linger any longer. He bade everyone farewell and led the team away. Luo Bingting followed suit, keeping her head high and her eyes straight ahead as they left.

Captain Xie hadn’t missed the expression in Luo Bingting’s eyes earlier, and now that she was so easily giving up, it made him suspect they had something up their sleeves. This group was too mysterious; what kind of secrets were they hiding? 

As he watched Luo Bingting and her group depart, Captain Xie didn’t rush to send his own people out. He was also curious to see if they’d make any moves.

Meanwhile, Luo Bingting and her group made their way to the surface via the parking lot exit. They circled the building but still couldn’t find the lab’s entrance. The sun was beginning to set, and if they didn’t hurry, they’d have to spend the night in the Dawn Building.

Everyone's anxiety began to rise. Luo Bingting pulled out a brochure from the biotech company and examined it closely. She noticed the room number for the basement level was B22010. Was it possible that the basement could only be accessed via the elevator, which was located in the lobby and parking lot?

The lobby elevator required descending two levels, while the parking lot elevator only needed to go down one. After voicing her hypothesis, the team agreed; they had climbing ropes in their gear, which could help in this situation.

With a plan in place, Luo Bingting and her group returned to the underground parking lot. When they got there, Captain Xie and his team had already left. Luo Bingting felt a twinge of regret over missing a few chances, knowing that they wouldn’t let her go on a killing spree. To others, Green Tea Zheng seemed innocent and pure.

Finally, they found the elevator on the east side of the parking lot. The power had been cut, and even the elevator indicators were dark, making it challenging to spot in the shadows. Luo Bingting was still pondering how to access the elevator when Meng spoke up, suggesting they first determine where the elevator was positioned during the power outage. If it happened to be at the basement level, they could jump from the first basement to the elevator and open the vent on top to get inside, then open the elevator doors. If it were in any other position, they would have to climb to the basement elevator entrance and force the doors open.

It sounded simple, but it wasn’t easy. Luo Bingting nodded; having a method was better than having none. Unfortunately, they didn’t have a crowbar, and while she was calculating what tools could work best, Meng produced a fire axe and a fire hose from a nearby fire hydrant.

The others came over to help, while Luo Bingting continued to search her space mentally for tools, having hoarded many supplies. Yet, she couldn’t immediately think of anything suitable and had to find a legitimate way to retrieve them.

Meng inserted the fire axe into the gap of the elevator door, while the others helped to push it open. Anmin cleverly wedged the metal head of the fire hose into the door crack, giving them a better leverage point to pry it open.

With effort, they successfully pried the elevator doors apart, revealing a dark elevator shaft. Everyone felt a surge of excitement; this meant they were one step closer to success. Meng had exerted great effort and now needed a moment to rest. They’d still have to pry open the door to the basement level, which posed a different challenge than the first basement.

The previous effort had been to push inward from the outside, which had provided leverage. Now, they needed to pull it open from the inside without any leverage, increasing the difficulty significantly. They also had to be wary of whether zombies might rush out when they opened the doors; the situation below was unclear. Luo Bingting decided she needed to descend as well; at the very least, her mental powers could help her assess the surroundings.

Anmin volunteered to go down first; he was the most accustomed to climbing. He secured himself with a rope and took the fire axe down. Following him was Luo Bingting; being lighter, she only needed two people to pull her down, while Anmin required three. Just as Luo Bingting was about to secure her rope, a loud explosion erupted from the underground parking lot, followed by the deafening sound of gunfire. 

Luo Bingting looked up towards the source of the explosion, her heart racing with alarm. “This is bad! Pull Anmin back up!”
