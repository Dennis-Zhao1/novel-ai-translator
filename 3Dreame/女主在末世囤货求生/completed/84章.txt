**Enhancing Abilities**

They piled up the corpses of the zombies together, and one of the fire-type ability users in the team ignited them with a single flicker of flame. This not only cleared away the rotting remains but also concealed the mangled brains of the zombies. If they were going to hide something, they might as well go all the way.

With the task completed, Luo Bingtin returned to hand over her shift. Although she was the head of the lookout post, it was impossible for her to be on duty twenty-four hours a day. The one taking over for her was her close friend, Zhu Yidan. Ever since her powers awakened, she had transformed completely from her former self.

In the past, she took on a laid-back attitude, lazy to the core. Now, with the Zhu family experiencing a shortage of capable ability users, she felt a sense of responsibility to step up after her own awakening. Not only had she stopped hitting the snooze button every morning, but she had also cut her hair shorter; what used to cascade down her shoulders was now styled into a chic bob.

She looked much sharper, and alongside Luo Bingtin and the others, she diligently practiced her abilities on the training grounds, outworking many of the other members of the Zhu family. Regardless of the type of powers one possessed, the key to improvement lay in consistent practice. She didn’t consider herself particularly gifted; she believed that hard work could make up for her lack of innate talent.

After returning to the fortress, the group dispersed, and Luo Bingtin headed straight to her dormitory. She quickly slipped into her space. Ever since her return from the Maple Forest villa, the space had been in a constant state of upgrade, showing no signs of change.

She regretted not having opened the mysterious box belonging to Elder Zhang to see what treasures lay within. The anticipation was unbearable; surely, they were artifacts from hundreds or even thousands of years ago. But then she thought that perhaps it was better not to have seen it, or else she would feel the same heartache as when she lost several ancient jade pieces.

Once she exited her space, Luo Bingtin went straight to find Xie Jinghang; she had further questions she needed his help with. She knocked on the door upstairs, and upon seeing her again, Xie Jinghang’s expression was unreadable, but he let her in nonetheless.

Not bothering with pleasantries, Luo Bingtin sat down and asked directly, “I want to know how to make the ice spikes hit different targets when I activate my skill.”

Xie Jinghang felt a bit helpless. Although they both shared secrets, this question was too obvious. He was not an ice-type ability user and really didn’t understand the nature of ice powers, so he could only analyze it based on his own lightning abilities.

The two discussed the issue for quite some time and ultimately concluded that while they were both mutated ability users, the essence of lightning and ice differed significantly. To achieve the effect she described, she would have to experiment more on her own or wait until her abilities upgraded.

Luo Bingtin expressed her appreciation, feeling somewhat enlightened. After all, the ability users from her past life had some real skills. What she feared the most was the act of trying and persisting.

As she left Xie Jinghang’s room, she noticed several pairs of eyes lurking in the shadows, watching her intently. With a smirk of mockery, she chose to act as if she was oblivious. Ever since they had collectively decided to keep the matter of the crystal cores a secret, the following days had seen the Zhu family members taking on the task of hunting zombies, while Luo Bingtin’s team handled the cleanup.

The elders from the Zhu family, particularly those from the collateral branches, felt a surge of pride seeing Luo Bingtin and her group take on the hardest tasks. They quickly began to feel superior, thinking that even if Luo Bingtin was powerful, she still had to respect them, and their arrogance began to show.

No one paid them any attention; everyone was eager for them to leave so they could start opening their mystery boxes! The amount they collected each day wasn’t substantial—at most, they would gather over twenty cores, while on lean days, it could be fewer than ten. However, they gradually accumulated a decent stash.

Luo Bingtin wasn’t the type to hoard. Once she had nearly two hundred cores, she gathered all her team members together. Xie Jinghang brought his squad, the three members from the Zheng family, and Brother Meng—everyone convened in Luo Bingtin's room.

Luo Bingtin pulled out a bag full of crystal cores and began to distribute them in front of all the ability users. The properties of the crystal cores weren’t fixed; elemental cores were rare, with most being low-level, non-elemental cores.

Non-elemental cores could be absorbed without restrictions, replenishing some energy and mental power, but they wouldn’t help increase ability levels. Only by absorbing a certain amount of elemental cores could one raise their ability level.

She distributed the elemental cores to the corresponding ability users and evenly divided the remaining one hundred eighty non-elemental cores. No one objected to the distribution; after all, they had all contributed to hunting the zombies, and they were willing to accept Luo Bingtin’s allocation.

Xie Jinghang seemed to recall something and asked, “Has anyone from the Zhu family found out about the crystal cores yet?”

Luo Bingtin nodded. “I haven’t even mentioned it to my Uncle Zhu or Yidan. The ambitions of the Zhu family’s collateral branches are evident; their greed for the fortress and our side is just becoming more overt. They’re currently keeping their distance, cautious of our strength, but until I know the attitude of the main branch, I don’t plan to inform them about the crystal cores. If they discover it on their own, that’s not my problem.”

The emergence of ability users would inevitably lead to a shift in the core power dynamics within the Zhu family. Given the previous events, Luo Bingtin felt cold-hearted. What started as a cooperative relationship had become a mere alliance for mutual benefit. If the Zhu family couldn’t maintain fairness, she didn’t see the need to involve herself in their affairs and didn’t want to keep sacrificing her interests to maintain their relationship.

Her previous tolerance and contributions to the Zhu family were largely due to her gratitude for Elder Zhu’s care. Even if there had been significant favors, she felt she had repaid them all. More importantly, her awakening had given her the ability to protect herself and her family.

Now, she wasn’t afraid of exposing her space. As far as she knew, the Kunshan base would soon find a space-type ability user, allowing her to undertake missions and gather supplies openly. What she obtained would also seem justified.

Everyone nodded in understanding, and the Zheng family members sighed inwardly, reminding themselves to avoid the mistakes the Zhu family had made.

After several days of cleanup, the zombies outside the fortress had been nearly eradicated, and the number of crystal cores collected was dwindling. Luo Bingtin, who was eager to enhance her abilities, felt dissatisfied with the status quo and discussed plans with Xie Jinghang and Brother Meng about going out to hunt zombies and collect more cores.

Xie Jinghang seemed equally eager and quickly agreed. They chose a sunny day, and Luo Bingtin, Brother Meng, the Zheng family trio, and Xie Jinghang’s team gathered together, setting off in two armored vehicles.

These vehicles had been specially modified before the apocalypse and were well-suited to deal with ability-enhanced zombies. In her past life, Luo Bingtin had no abilities and had never participated in battles against mutated zombies. As she drove, she realized the danger of encountering a wood-type zombie that attacked them with entwining vines, causing her tires to get stuck. It was then that she understood how quickly zombies could enhance their abilities compared to humans.

Leading the group, Xie Jinghang’s lightning had already struck the wood-type zombie in the head. Luo Bingtin followed up with an ice spike, causing the vines to wither and crumble as if doused in sulfuric acid, turning into a pile of dry twigs.

They drove to the vicinity of a residential area that Luo Bingtin had never visited. Xie Jinghang seemed familiar with the area, leading the way confidently. After parking the vehicles, the team disembarked. Despite their abilities, they still carried Dragon Springs swords and firearms, adhering to the principle that while equipment could be optional, it should never be absent.

The number of zombies in this area was genuinely considerable, and everyone was on high alert. As they dealt with the common zombies, Luo Bingtin furrowed her brow. Why was it that ordinary humans couldn’t evolve into ability users after the magnetic field changed, yet zombies could continue to evolve?

She raised her hand and shot through a rushing zombie’s head; it was of the earth type, utilizing soil walls as shields. Did this mean that the intelligence of the zombies was increasing as well? Over one hundred zombies wandered around the residential area, providing ample targets for them to practice their skills.

Xie Jinghang remained calm compared to the others, his demeanor suggesting that for mutated zombies, these were just the initial stages.
