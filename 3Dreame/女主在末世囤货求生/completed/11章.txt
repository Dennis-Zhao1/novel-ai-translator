**Collecting Supplies from the Farm Warehouse**

It was another round of psychological warfare. Luo Bingtin felt the fire could burn a bit brighter, when suddenly, one of her naive associates sent a flurry of pictures featuring firearms, causing her to panic and quickly request him to retract them. She definitely didn’t want to attract unwanted attention from the authorities. The guy was soon schooled by the others, realizing just how outrageous his actions had been.

This was a wild move, but the others picked up on the nuances in Luo Bingtin's tone, and it was as if a light bulb went off in their heads. They subtly expressed their intentions to her, their eyes gleaming with hopes of collaboration. Luo Bingtin maintained her calm demeanor; if they could really pull it off, she was open to it, but if not, it was no big deal. 

Of course, there was a disparity in capabilities among these people. Luo Bingtin was only reaching out to families with solid strengths and good reputations; otherwise, she'd be setting herself up for betrayal, and that would be a disaster. 

Perhaps it was the commotion she caused or the keen eyes of her grandfather’s protectors, but she received a call that afternoon, reminding her to be cautious and asking if she needed assistance. Luo Bingtin acknowledged the concern; she would definitely remember this kindness. She conveyed her indifference towards the materials, and they understood that it was just a small investment. As long as their little princess wasn’t scammed, they were satisfied.

She diligently noted down the names of those who had contacted her over this period, planning to arrange for future matters when she returned home. The secondary supply of military-grade materials wasn’t absent but couldn’t be flaunted. One individual, a second-generation heir with a gem mining operation overseas, directly invited her to visit. Luo Bingtin understood the unspoken invitation and readily agreed.

That night, she returned to the farm warehouse to gather supplies. Her subordinates worked efficiently. Aside from employee wages and bonuses, everything else had been diverted to purchase materials. 

Luo Bingtin came in the dead of night, having sent away the employees guarding the warehouse with a simple excuse that she had already arranged for others to come for transport. Clad in loose-fitting athletic gear with a baseball cap pulled low, she stealthily slipped into the warehouse. 

The four warehouses were positioned in the northwest corner of the farm, nestled against the mountains, with a highway running to the left. After parking her car in the shadows and turning off the lights, she quickly dashed inside. 

The first warehouse, on the right, was packed with convenience foods: instant noodles, self-heating hotpots, Nanchang mixed noodles, Chongqing noodles, snail noodles, claypot rice, sour and spicy rice noodles, and cookies. There were canned goods too—beef, luncheon meat, fish, and assorted fruit like apples, pears, peaches, and oranges. 

Powdered drinks such as soy milk, sesame paste, and rice porridge were also stacked high, with boxes piled over four meters, nearly touching the ceiling. Each row had a label detailing the contents. 

Luo Bingtin found this organization ingenious and didn’t bother rearranging anything. With a flick of her finger and a shift in her mental focus, she used her spiritual energy to instantly transfer all the supplies into her space. They appeared neatly on the yellow earth inside her dimension. Thankfully, these materials were all boxed up, and openings on the sides meant she didn’t have to unpack everything to access the items inside. 

Without delay, she swiftly cleared out the first warehouse. Her spiritual energy had taken a slight hit, but after sitting in meditation for a few moments, she felt fully restored and ready for more. 

Next was the second warehouse, filled with rice, flour, and cooking oil. The vacuum-packed rice was stacked into a mountain, towering even higher than the one in the heavenly palace. Nearby, there was a tall stack of flour bags. The divine list had made it clear—rice and flour were essential staples that needed to be stockpiled, and she had sourced them from the chief distributors across three nearby provinces.

On the other side were cooking oils of all varieties—peanut, sunflower, olive, tea, and blended oils—anything in stock was brought in. There were also spices; salt was the most critical, followed by soy sauce, oyster sauce, vinegar, cooking wine, and various sauces like stir-fry sauce, chili sauce, beef sauce, and Korean hot sauce. 

By the end, the second warehouse was completely filled. Luo Bingtin repeated her process, and soon there was a vast collection of supplies on the yellow ground in her space. Yet, considering the vastness of the Yulong Secret Realm, she felt like she needed to stockpile even more; her inner hoarder was awakening.

She moved to the third warehouse, which housed snacks, milk, and beverages. Although the milk had a short shelf life, her space kept it fresh. One entire row of milk was tucked away. 

Then came the drinks—carbonated sodas like cola, Sprite, and Fanta, sparkling waters, and non-carbonated options like juices, yogurt, milk tea, coffee, and a diverse range of alcoholic beverages. There were also plenty of snacks—these were irreplaceable items, valuable treasures in an apocalyptic scenario, including various flavors of chips, shrimp crackers, and puffed snacks. 

She made sure to stock up on chocolate, insisting that only pure chocolate was acceptable, without any substitutes. A collection of nuts—peanuts, sunflower seeds, pine nuts, pistachios, almonds, and cashews—was also included, as these were rare commodities in the end times, and she had intentionally doubled the quantity listed by the divine. 

After emptying the third warehouse, she headed to the fourth. This space mainly contained daily necessities and clothing. The essentials included cleaning products like shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, soap, laundry detergent, and disinfectants. 

Hygiene products had specific brand models for sanitary napkins and adult diapers, which had been highlighted on the divine list. There were also paper products—both toilet rolls and tissue boxes, with kitchen paper stacked so high it almost touched the ceiling. 

Safety supplies included insecticides, disinfectants, diluted acidic cleaners, masks, gloves, and protective suits. For clothing, she partnered with several sports brands and outdoor companies, scraping together their stock, focusing on seasonal athletic wear and outer clothing. 

Underwear and base layers were sourced from an international brand’s entire inventory, reserving only her sizes while ensuring plenty for everyone else. The outdoor supplies were even more extensive, including camping gear like tents, folding chairs, inflatable beds, cooking utensils, and charging equipment.

In less than an hour, all four warehouses were completely cleared out. Luo Bingtin rubbed her slightly sore wrists, realizing she needed to work on strengthening her spiritual energy. She felt like she had finally carved out a path for herself. 

She had arranged for solar generators and battery panels to be connected with manufacturers and planned to stockpile controlled materials like gasoline overseas, thankfully using only the cash flow from her companies. Before her international trip, she had already tidied up her sole-owned businesses, with only a few military supply contracts left to finalize once they passed inspection.
