**Frozen Gun**

Behind them, Pei Qian and his subordinates were busy dealing with the red-haired monsters, while the rest focused on taking down the massive boss that was blocking their way. 

Looking up, Luo Bingtin spotted a nearly two-meter-wide vertical hole. It was dark, but she could hear rustling sounds coming from within. Fearing the worst, she decided against using fire again. Instead, she pulled out her air gun and fired several shots into the blackness above, then quickly darted away, just in case something fell down and hit her.

As soon as she moved, something heavy crashed down right where she had just stood. It was a frenzied sea urchin.

“Well, great. Now the only one missing is that ugly flower that shoots its offspring everywhere,” she thought.

“Host, I’m sensing bad vibes. Do you want to exchange for some weapons?” came the voice of the chatty system.

“Do you have any recommendations?”

“The Flame Dragon weapon works great against things that fear light and fire.”

“Fire-type weapons?”

“Yeah, it burns really hot!”

“Not a chance; we’re running low on oxygen.”

“How about an oxygen tank? It’s not too expensive.”

“Too pricey; I’ll pass.”

“It’s really not that expensive! You could just pick up some of those crystal cores we passed earlier for points.”

“Don’t try to fool me; I need something more powerful.”

“Then how about this—an Ice Gun? As long as there's water, it can freeze anything you want to freeze, and anything frozen that gets hit will shatter into ice shards.”

Xie Jinghang’s eyes lit up. This was perfect—no oxygen required, and environmentally friendly too. 

Without hesitation, he exchanged for the Ice Gun. The naming convention of the system was truly bland; such a beautiful weapon deserved a more imaginative title. 

The gun was slightly larger than the air gun, resembling a water gun from childhood. However, instead of a hollow bottle for water storage, this gun had a semi-transparent crystal chamber that looked like ice—almost like an energy stone.

He then turned to the water-type ability user in their team. “Spray water at those red-haired monsters behind us. The more, the better!”

Luo Bingtin was puzzled; she didn’t understand why it had taken several shots for just one mad sea urchin to drop, and now Xie Jinghang was asking someone to spray water for some reason.

The water-type user, accustomed to following Xie’s orders without question, began to spray a torrent of water, nearly dousing the flames in the process.

Seizing the opportunity, Xie Jinghang pulled the trigger on the Ice Gun. In no time, everyone watched in amazement as the previously hopping red-haired monsters were encased as icy orbs. With another flick of his wrist, a small bolt of lightning struck the ice orb, shattering it into countless shards that couldn’t even be glued back together with super glue.

“Wow! Why didn’t you use this sooner? I’ve been busting my butt back here while you’ve been playing with your shiny toy!” Pei Qian complained, his envy barely concealed.

Luo Bingtin felt a spark of inspiration; she had never thought to freeze her targets before. This was a new tactic she definitely wanted to try next time.

With Xie Jinghang’s incredible weapon in play, the remaining red-haired monsters became a breeze to deal with. The water-type user finally felt included in the action, and soon enough, they had frozen about ten ice orbs, some even stuck together. A casual strike sent them shattering across the ground.

“Such a stress reliever,” An Min remarked suddenly, turning to Luo Fan. With Wang Xinxin gone, he had lost his go-to person for banter and was now settling for Luo Fan—anyone would do.

“Xie Jinghang, come quick!” Luo Bingtin suddenly shouted, noticing that the frenzied sea urchins seemed to respond to their call, jumping out of the vertical hole in a chaotic swarm. The water-type user suggested they switch turns; while Xie’s gun could keep firing, they needed a break.

Moments later, those mad sea urchins were also frozen into little lumps, meeting the same shattering fate.

However, Luo Bingtin’s attention was fixed on the ever-immovable massive boss. How could they possibly defeat it?

Dr. Zhang would be thrilled to see it; he would surely want samples for research.

“We need to figure out how to lure that big one out of the cave,” Luo Bingtin told Xie Jinghang. The air was growing thinner, thick with the stench of fish and burnt matter; smoke was beginning to choke them. If they didn’t ventilate soon, they would have to retreat.

“Okay, wait for me,” Xie Jinghang replied quickly, striding to the cave entrance and firing off a bolt of lightning upward, producing immediate results. A series of annoying squeaks echoed from within the cave.

This was indeed a sensitive ugly flower.

But curiously, the ugly flower remained still. Despite the irritating sounds, it showed no signs of movement, stubbornly blocking the exit.

“Let’s go back; I can’t breathe,” Pei Qian called from behind, worry etched on his face as he glanced at Pei Chang.

“Wait a moment,” Xie Jinghang urged Luo Bingtin to fire some ice spikes at the ugly flower. Complying, she did just that. In the next second, Xie Jinghang’s Ice Gun followed suit, and he seemed extremely confident. Without checking the situation, he unleashed a bolt of lightning, expecting the ugly flower to shatter into pieces. Instead, he sensed danger approaching.

Luo Fan quickly immobilized the flower with its head partially exposed, but the hold didn’t last long.

The giant ugly flower had firmly anchored itself to the mountainside and extended its tendrils as if to grasp at them, and suddenly, Luo Bingtin understood its intentions—it wanted to seize them to nourish its offspring.

Disgust filled her as she recalled how the captain of the guard and two other members might have already become nutrients for this grotesque creature. 

In a fit of anger, her attack power surged.

“Luo Fan, focus on regaining your abilities; don’t attack yet. When I call you, come up immediately!” 

“Understood.”

The obedient Luo Fan quietly stood back to recover his powers, while An Min gleefully used wind blades to slice at the tendrils.

Luo Bingtin noted that this giant ugly flower was significantly larger than the one from that night; it must have many more offspring inside. The glass jars were already prepared. Just then, Xie Jinghang called for the water-type user to spray water again.

He planned to use the same strategy, but before the water-type user could get into position, the flower reached out with two more tendrils to grab them, making avoidance a significant challenge.

It was painfully cramped, and Luo Bingtin had narrowly avoided disaster several times with her air gun, ensuring that Xie Jinghang and the others weren’t swept away.

With an air gun in one hand and the Ice Gun in the other, Xie Jinghang, shielded by the group, had the water-type user spraying a torrent of water. Luo Bingtin noticed the giant flower’s belly starting to undulate again—it was about to release its offspring.

“Xie Jinghang, hurry! It’s about to shoot out its seeds!”

“Got it.”

Xie Jinghang responded succinctly. Seeing the water was sufficiently sprayed, he unleashed a barrage of ice shots at the giant flower. Finally, it was successfully frozen. Sighing in relief, he realized it hadn’t frozen completely; the flower’s belly was cracking open, and its seeds were not yet encased in ice.

“Be careful!” he shouted to everyone. Luo Fan was already in position, but it seemed they were just a step short.
