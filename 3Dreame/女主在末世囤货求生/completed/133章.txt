**Awakening Injection**

The first step was to organize the space. After bringing the old house into her realm, she held onto the hope that one day she could take it out again to settle down. However, she couldn’t just leave it strewn about; she carefully selected a picturesque spot by the mountains and rivers to securely place the old house. All traces of the previous violence had been meticulously cleaned, and she even sprayed disinfectant to ensure it was germ-free.

Every day, her greatest joy was restoring the old house to its former glory. Thankfully, she had managed to gather all the important items from the house before the apocalypse hit, and now she could place them back in their original positions, which offered a soothing balm to her soul.

The first room she restored was her grandfather's study and their secret room. As she arranged the ancient books back on their shelves, just as they had been before, a sense of deep satisfaction washed over her.

The living room and bedrooms had suffered considerable damage, with many pieces of furniture ruined. Gritting her teeth, she decided to clear them away. It was a shame, but there was no alternative; anything tainted by those scoundrels—Fu Buchi and his ilk—could not be kept.

The treasures and antiques she had collected from the museum and treasure house were perfect for decorating the now-empty old house. Instead of leaving them out in the open where they lacked any aesthetic appeal, she took the opportunity to arrange them beautifully. Thus, upon opening the grand doors of the house, one would be greeted by the magnificent large jade sculpture of the ‘Giant Hydra’ at the entrance, accompanied by a jade mountain piece from the museum.

Walking further inside, the original Eight Immortals table stood prominently against the wall, adorned with a row of exquisite collectible pieces. On either side were display cabinets filled with greenery, while the walls were decorated with renowned calligraphy and paintings.

The antique shelves were neatly arranged with bronzeware, porcelain, and jewelry—an eye-catching but not chaotic display. The walls leading up the staircase were also adorned with museum artifacts, providing a rich cultural atmosphere, perfect for decoration.

She had no intention of cramming everything together, as that would be too ostentatious. Many items that clashed with the old house's decor were neatly stored away in the rooms, allowing for a well-organized layout. This meticulous organization transformed the scattered treasures that had been lying on the grassy area of her space into a clean and orderly collection, which was incredibly relieving.

During her free time, she also tidied up the grass outside the old house, planting two saplings to give the area a touch of life.

While she was engrossed in this home-decorating endeavor, the first batch of thirty people inside the fortress had completed their awakening injections. To prevent any unexpected incidents, Luo Bingtin had assigned a team of ability users to stand guard over the awakened individuals, rotating in shifts.

A larger room had been transformed into a makeshift medical ward, equipped with thirty single beds for both men and women. Dr. Zhang and Little Lu were both thrilled and eager, as this was the first large-scale injection of the serum, meaning they would gather thirty sets of clinical data.

The medical staff’s role was more about monitoring the injured patients, as several awakened individuals had started to regain consciousness. The ability users appeared to be fine, but the ordinary people were recovering more slowly and had not yet shown any signs of zombification. It was a relief to realize that the detoxification serum developed in the lab was indeed very effective.

As Luo Bingtin arrived to hand over her shift, she unexpectedly ran into Uncle Zhu, who had not made an appearance for quite some time. He had brought three researchers with him to monitor the detoxification serum's progress. After recording their data, he was about to leave when he saw her, looking a bit embarrassed. Luo Bingtin understood the source of the awkwardness; it was simply because Zhu Yidan had run off with Xie Jinghang.

Unable to explain the details to Uncle Zhu, Luo Bingtin politely nodded in greeting, though internally, she thought, "You better clean up this mess yourself when you come back, you little rascal."

The injection of the awakening serum had not been conducted in secret, allowing many ordinary people to watch the process. It resembled a typical vaccination; after the injection, the individuals were still in high spirits, chatting with their family and friends. It wasn’t until Dr. Zhang requested unrelated personnel to leave that the crowd began to disperse.

Following Little Lu's protocol, the first thirty minutes after injection went smoothly. However, symptoms began to appear after thirty minutes, starting with a fever and then fainting. Unlike the natural awakening that caused individuals to collapse, these injected individuals were acutely aware of their bodies' reactions.

Fortunately, most of the first batch consisted of young, strong men, and despite feeling hot and feverish, they were able to maintain their composure. The excitement of awakening their abilities seemed to outweigh any physical discomfort. Some members of the guard team, even with temperatures nearing 39 degrees Celsius, still felt quite well, underscoring their high hopes.

The only two young women who had received the awakening serum lay in a corner on their beds, burning with fever and appearing either fast asleep or unconscious.

Dr. Zhang had organized everything very well; Little Lu and another female researcher took turns every half hour to record the awakened individuals' physical data, while one awakened person was assigned to monitor their condition with specialized equipment.

Luo Bingtin stayed on until the early hours of the morning. By then, the awakened individuals had all slipped into a comatose state. When Meng Ge arrived to take over the shift, he saw his young lady standing at the door of the ward, arms crossed. At that moment, she seemed to have grown up; the image of the little girl who needed protection faded, replaced by a strong and capable young woman.

“Miss, I’ve brought people to keep watch. You should head back to rest,” Meng Ge suggested.

Luo Bingtin nodded at Meng Ge, wrapping up the shift handover and dismissing the team. However, she chose to stay in the ward a bit longer.

Meng Ge didn’t rush her; instead, she took the initiative to say she wasn’t tired and felt more at ease staying there.

It was true that she wasn’t tired, but her unease was palpable. She always felt there might still be hidden dangers lurking within the fortress. More importantly, in the next room lay Fu Kuandan, who had also received the awakening serum. After the initial half-hour of reactions, he had succumbed to the drug and should now be sound asleep.

However, the people in the fortress were unaware of this. Fu Kuandan, to show his sincerity, had not interacted with anyone other than her and Xie Jinghang since entering the fortress and had avoided wandering around. Most likely, the majority of the fortress's inhabitants hadn’t even noticed the presence of another person.

According to Little Lu’s experience, the awakened individuals’ temperatures would gradually decrease six hours post-injection, though they remained in a feverish state. Luo Bingtin frequently used her spiritual energy to probe their conditions and discovered something fascinating: the awakened individuals' minds were indeed crystallizing, albeit at a slow pace. After intervals, noticeable changes would occur, with clear differences between them.

Originally, she intended to inform Dr. Zhang and Little Lu about this phenomenon, but to her surprise, Little Lu had already discovered it. After checking on the patients, he came over to report on their progress.

Luo Bingtin remained calm in response to the news, while Meng Ge was quite astonished, repeatedly exclaiming his surprise.

Luo Bingtin had personally checked on Fu Kuandan's room. In reality, a simple sweep with her spiritual energy was enough to assess his condition; the crystallization in his mind was progressing smoothly, but not as rapidly as that of the guards. It appeared that those with better physiques were crystallizing better. Could this be a case of good soil yielding good fruit?

Just as the night reached its darkest hour and exhaustion set in, Luo Bingtin noticed the ability users standing guard were getting restless. She encouraged them to move around a bit. Just as she was about to say something to Meng Ge, she sensed someone sneaking into the office building.

Luo Bingtin smirked coldly; she had initially thought that if someone were to stir trouble tonight, the lab would be the likely target. She had even stationed hidden ability users there to catch anyone in the act. To her surprise, the intruder had come here instead.

Subtly signaling to Meng Ge, who had been about to yawn, he abruptly halted, suppressing it before turning his attention to the staircase, his hand already raised.
