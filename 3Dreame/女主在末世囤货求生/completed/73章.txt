**Drifting with the Current**

In order to kill some time, Luo Bingting returned to her space to tidy up the farm, primarily picking up eggs. She gazed at the large pile of eggs nestled in the straw and diligently gathered several stacks.

After finishing her daily chores, she stepped out, only to find that the group of people was still there.

"Big brother, the mark is right here!"  
"Yeah, I see it. Let’s see if we can find the people."  
"Got it."

The sound of footsteps echoed as Luo Bingting activated her senses. There were at least ten people in that group. Could it be that Xiao Ruo sent someone to pick her up?

Something felt off about this scene.

"Big brother, over here!"  
The excitement in the voice was unusual, prompting Luo Bingting to curiously glance out the window.

There stood a yellow-haired thug with a mischievous air, beckoning his boss over from the open space in front of the bungalow.

Suddenly, the sounds of kicking doors and shouts erupted, and Luo Bingting's instincts kicked in. This was no friendly pick-up; it looked like a kidnapping.

She saw three women tied up with ropes, discarded on the ground near the door.

The yellow-haired thug greedily pinched the face of one of the bound women and said to his boss, "Big brother, these three are quite the lookers. Boss will definitely be satisfied!"  
"Yeah, they are pretty good. Hurry up and take them away."  

Bending down, the boss inspected the women closely, completely unaware of her presence.  
"And what about these three guys?" he asked, pointing to three young men pressed against the wall by other thugs.

"Do we even need to ask? Just follow the usual protocol."  
"No! What are you guys planning to do? Don’t hurt my brother Ziqian!"  

Xiao Shengnu made another attempt to protest, trying to rise and shove the thug holding her down, causing a commotion.

At that moment, someone kicked open the door to Luo Bingting's room. She scolded herself for being too engrossed in the gossip to notice the chaos outside and that someone would be searching the place.

As soon as their eyes met, Luo Bingting hadn’t even had time to draw her gun before the thug shouted, "Big brother, there’s another pretty girl here!"

With her gun still in her hand, Luo Bingting quickly tucked it back into her pocket. She only had seven bullets, and it would be tough to take them all out without making noise. Maybe she should switch to a fully automatic rifle; she had an AK-47 stashed away, which she had fired once during her encounter with Fu Dingjin. It felt quite satisfying.

The big brother came over, and upon seeing his face, Luo Bingting was surprised. Wasn’t this the golden transport worker, Brother Luo, from before the apocalypse?

What luck! She might just have caught a break.

As the attention shifted, Ziqian and the twins seized the opportunity to kick down the thug who was holding them and made a break for it.

The three bound women were still sobbing, but with the sudden turn of events, they joined the fray and fled. The thugs quickly reacted, and chaos ensued as some chased after the escapees while others ran after the captured women.

"Big brother! Those three little bunnies got away!" the yellow-haired thug reported, panting.

Brother Luo looked at Luo Bingting, taking in her stunning features—her porcelain skin, glossy eyes, and that luminous sparkle that gave her a unique charm caught between womanhood and girlhood. His gaze flickered several times before he barked, "Let them go; as long as we have a woman, it’s fine. Tie her up and take her back."

Feigning fear, Luo Bingting acted compliant, making it seem as if she was in shock. The thug who was tying her up found it odd; he had never encountered someone so cooperative in a kidnapping.

The group arrived in modified vans, and Luo Bingting, along with Xiao Shengnu and the others, was shoved into one. The so-called modifications involved removing all the seats except for the driver and passenger seats, turning it into a makeshift cargo van, which was a common practice for transporting goods.

Finding a corner to huddle in, Luo Bingting adjusted herself into a more comfortable position, maintaining her terrified facade while plotting her next moves once she infiltrated the enemy’s ranks.

Clearly, this was all about Fu Buqi's shady dealings. What were they planning to do with the women they captured? Was it human trafficking or perhaps something even more sinister?

During her sheltered life, she had only seen the facade created by the Fu family, completely unaware of the darkest and cruelest realities lurking beneath the surface.

Now that she had personally experienced that dark side, she felt awakened. With the Fu family’s infamous reputation, her suspicions were within the realm of possibility, and she was determined to see it for herself.

This was just the beginning; this group had been running around Beijing all day, gathering a van full of women, all young and attractive.

Luo Bingting witnessed firsthand how the women who resisted were beaten and how the men who fought back were killed. This so-called safe haven in the apocalypse was nothing more than a facade, a cover for bloodsucking schemes and murder.

Surrounded by sobbing women, Luo Bingting felt a twinge of helplessness. What good was crying? 

No one was going to hand out free meals; if she wanted to survive, she had to figure out a way to save herself.

Beside her, the elegant older sister remained expressionless. Luo Bingting didn’t care to speculate on the thoughts of others, focusing solely on infiltrating the base. Her excitement was bubbling up; she was eagerly anticipating what lay ahead.

Their supplies and backpacks had been confiscated before getting in the van, but fortunately, Luo Bingting’s bag held nothing of value—just some bread meant for show and nearly empty water bottles.

Though her supplies were scant, it didn’t prevent her from feeling displeasure at the sight of the yellow-haired thug munching on her bread.

Sitting in the passenger seat, he acted all cocky and arrogant, rummaging through the bags piled at his feet, eating whatever he found. To her surprise, he stumbled upon a gun hidden in one of the bags.

He jumped back in shock, nearly hitting the roof of the van if not for his seatbelt. After a shaky moment, he opened the gun's magazine and, finding it empty, relaxed.

He turned to the group of women, still tightly bound and crying pitifully, and waved the gun, asking, "Whose is this?"

No one answered. He raised his voice, "Speak up! Whose is it?"

Finally, the women fell silent, their tear-filled eyes darting among each other.

Luo Bingting had a good idea whose it was, glancing at the elegant older sister, who kept her head down, lips pressed tight, not saying a word.

"Fine, if you won’t say, just remember, when we get to the base, don’t regret it," he warned.

Luo Bingting rolled her eyes inwardly, thinking, "When we get to the base, who will be regretting what? You’re going to regret messing with my bread."

She tried not to show it too obviously, putting on a pitiful expression as she buried her face into her knees.

On the way back, Luo Bingting discreetly memorized the route. She recognized this villa area, named after the largest natural maple forest in Beijing. In autumn, the mountains would be ablaze with colorful leaves, a picturesque sight.

Fu Buqi had a knack for picking locations; he truly insulted the beauty of this place by making it his lair.

Beijing's winter was filled with a sense of retreat, and even the beautiful maple villa area felt desolate—one word: bare.

Luo Bingting noted the reality of the situation. Whether the scenery was beautiful or not was irrelevant. If it came down to it, she’d blow the place up; the stockpiled explosives were meant for this very purpose.
