**Living in Peace While Preparing for the Storm**

In the days spent within the fortified walls of the end-world stronghold, it felt like a hidden sanctuary. There were no relentless zombies gnawing at flesh, no crisis of water and power shortages from the outside world. 

Everyone lived happily and fulfilled. Doctor Zhang and the researchers, who had returned with Uncle Zhu, were assigned to the lab in the office building to continue their research. 

Liu Xiaohui helped out in the cafeteria, primarily under the guidance of Aunt Li. 

Luo Bingtin and the young and old alike trained daily with Brother Meng. When they weren't training or out on missions, they would hang out and laugh along with that troublesome girl, Zhu Yidan. 

Only those who had experienced the brutal reality of the outside world could truly appreciate the precious moments of peace they had.

The younger members of the Zhu family organized daily mountain patrols, primarily checking the barbed wire along the walls. Any issues had to be recorded immediately for repairs. 

The normal operation of the stronghold relied on Uncle Zhu and the older generation of uncles and aunts, who had military and political experience overseeing security, while those with agricultural knowledge managed the farming, and those with management and finance skills took care of supplies and distribution. 

Luo Bingtin held weekly meetings with Grandpa Zhu and Uncle Zhu to assess the current situation of the stronghold and plan the next steps. However, her memories from her previous life only reached the fifth year of the apocalypse.

The global shift in the magnetic field marked a crucial phase, with human evolution occurring a few years after the changes began. 

After extensive discussions with Uncle Zhu and Doctor Zhang regarding the mutations of the zombies, the core team unanimously decided to delve into zombie research. 

Perhaps by uncovering the cause of the mutations, they could halt the apocalypse and save humanity. 

The Zheng family had carved out a niche for themselves in the stronghold due to their expertise in crafting Longquan swords, and they allocated space for sword forging. 

The previous batch of Longquan swords had been discreetly distributed by Luo Bingtin, with only the small teams receiving them; no one else had made a fuss. 

The Zheng family understood how to increase their bargaining chips and knew precisely what to do. 

The storage space had also undergone a significant transformation, now filled with ripe wheat and rabbits scurrying about. 

Who would have thought there would come a day when she would regret tossing out two rabbits in her space, especially a pregnant one! 

Life is like a play, Luo sighed. To prevent the rabbits from nibbling on the supplies, she chased them around the entire space, often falling flat on her face. 

It wasn’t until she turned catching rabbits into a unique form of physical training that the task shifted from nightmarish difficulty to a more manageable challenge. 

As the days grew more stable, the tension in Luo Bingtin's heart tightened. 

She couldn't recall when it began, but she found herself gradually forgetting the exact time when the global magnetic field mutation was set to change everything. 

Even the occasional task of capturing zombies for research became a way to sharpen her sense of urgency. 

Luo Bingtin understood this was not a good sign; while she could enjoy a comfortable life in the apocalypse, she must not lose her sense of vigilance. 

With the in-depth research led by Uncle Zhu and Doctor Zhang, along with Luo Bingtin’s seemingly magical return of research results and numerous reagents from the Level B2 bioengineering lab, the progress in studying zombie mutations was rapid. 

It was already confirmed that the zombie virus was artificially created, not without cause. 

This conclusion sent a chill down their spines; the unseen hand behind it all possessed the power to destroy the world, an unsettling thought indeed. 

The next challenge was to unravel the code of the zombie virus to find a way to eliminate them. 

Research required a considerable number of zombies for testing, and for an entire month, Luo Bingtin and Brother Meng led a team daily to capture zombies. 

To better educate those remaining in the stronghold and prevent them from growing too complacent, Luo Bingtin carried her phone and drone to film their missions. It served two purposes: showcasing their team's strength to earn recognition for their efforts and imparting a lasting lesson on the importance of being prepared for the worst. 

On this particular day, they set off to capture zombies again. Luo Bingtin drove a riot-control vehicle at the front, with Brother Meng following closely in a modified truck. Their target was to capture ten zombies. 

The area around the stronghold had remained safe, so they needed to venture into the city. The highway entrance had been cleared to create two passages. Their last zombie haul had come from an overturned bus. 

To ensure a safe, quick, and effective capture of zombies, they brainstormed and established a series of operational protocols, including special mouth guards to prevent bites—one swift chop, a mouth guard fitted, and the zombie instantly lost its aggression. 

Initially, there was a more straightforward method: simply sever the jaw, rendering the zombies incapable of biting. However, everyone found it too messy, with blood splattering all over. 

By this time, autumn had set in. After half a year of training and growth, the team had undergone a remarkable transformation. 

Take Zhu Xiaoqi, for instance, the once timid and cowardly member, who had developed his unique, sly combat style. With a flourish of his Longquan sword, he carried himself with the swagger of a rogue who had seen better days, each attack unpredictable—no one could guess where his next strike would land. 

Anmin’s approach was similar to Zhu Xiaoqi's but less sneaky and more visually appealing, sometimes even impressively choreographed. 

From their initial, timid selves, the team now resembled an elite squad, which made Brother Meng feel an immense sense of accomplishment. 

The two vehicles cruised through the highway toll booth, conversing cheerfully over the walkie-talkies as they headed toward the city. 

During their first venture into the city last month, they had encountered a military squad clearing zombies and collecting supplies, hailing from the infamous Kunshan Base known in her previous life. 

They sent the most upbeat member, Anmin, to gather intel, but he reported hearing nothing about Fu Buqi. Could it be that the trick he had played on him before the apocalypse left him with no resources to sustain himself? 

If this were the case, and it meant Fu would never reach the heights he once had, Luo would celebrate with champagne! 

As they reached the West Fifth Ring Road, gradually entering the residential areas, a small wave of zombies had returned after being cleared out last month. Luo Bingtin's team was now dubbed the Raptor Squad, a name given by Brother Meng. 

Every time they announced their squad name, Luo felt a surge of youthful bravado, while the others were quite proud of it. 

Watching her team navigate effortlessly through the throngs of zombies, she thought to herself, enjoy these leisurely days before the zombies evolve, boys. 

They expertly bound the captured zombies with chains to prevent them from harming anyone. The standard practice for the team was to pair up: one would chop off the zombie's arm at the shoulder while the other fitted the mouth guard. They lined them up, and the zombies would automatically follow whenever a living person stood in front of them. 

Once they captured enough zombies for research, they would sweep the surrounding area clean of any remaining zombies. 

Luo Bingtin settled back in the vehicle as Brother Meng secured the cargo truck's doors, preparing to head back to the stronghold. 

Suddenly, a group of people in luxury cars rolled up in front of them, some of whom were familiar faces. 

Luo Bingtin was not surprised they were still alive; those rich in resources had a far better chance of surviving the apocalypse. 

What shocked her was their audacity in flaunting their lives in this chaotic world, as if nothing had changed since before the apocalypse. 

It seemed that for them, zombies posed no true threat; instead, they had become a breeding ground for their unabashed wrongdoing.
