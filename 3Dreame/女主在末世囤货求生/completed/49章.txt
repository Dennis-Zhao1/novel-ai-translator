**Reunion with Old Friends**

Luo Bingting had built up her physical strength through training in the space, and now it was still holding up. Her companion, Meng Ge, had been pushing them hard during their workouts, and the only thing she felt was a slight ache in her wrists.

What surprised her was An Min. This guy actually had great stamina! Back when she saw him lazing around at the old house in Hangzhou, he didn’t seem like the diligent type at all. But then An Min explained that he had started honing his skills since elementary school, which required him to swing a hammer repeatedly. A sword needed to be tempered through countless strikes, so it made sense that his physical fitness was quite impressive.

After taking down a few more zombies, they cleared out a conference room and closed the door behind them, taking a moment to catch their breath. The zombies they were facing had just recently mutated, so their speed was relatively slow. But thinking ahead... Luo Bingting glanced at her team and resolved to ramp up their training when they got back, preparing for the challenges to come.

After about ten minutes of rest, they resumed their mission to clear the zombies and search for survivors. They managed to eliminate all the zombies on the seventeenth floor and opened the doors to the offices, only to find no other survivors, nor any sign of Uncle Zhu or the young ladies.

“Not here?” Luo Bingting felt puzzled. Surely they hadn’t come all this way for nothing? Uncle Zhu’s information seemed way off.

Breathing heavily, they found spots to sit and catch their breath. Luo Bingting was still deep in thought. The location was definitely correct, and the company name matched, but the people were missing. Where could they be?

Determined to find a clue, she made her way to the front desk and stumbled upon some pamphlets promoting a biotech company. It was a tri-fold brochure featuring company images, business scope, advantages, product information, and addresses, confirming that the biotech company was indeed located on the seventeenth floor and in the underground lab on the second basement level.

“They might all be in the basement,” she shared with her team, who agreed that it was highly likely they were on the second basement level. No matter what, they had to check it out.

Once everyone was ready, they stood up to head back down to the second basement. Luo Bingting took the brochure with her. The management office had only provided her with a floor plan for the seventeenth floor and no information about the second basement.

Every unknown carried an element of danger. Even if the zombies weren’t too fast at the moment, there was no telling what unexpected situations could arise. Overthinking wouldn’t help, and Luo Bingting decided to approach the situation head-on: if gods stood in her way, she would slay them; if Buddhas blocked her path, she would kill them too. She had come this far; there was no way she would go back empty-handed—that simply wasn’t her style.

Descending the stairs was far quicker than climbing them. This building might not have many advantages, but the sound insulation was impressive. She could hear plenty of zombies above, yet the ruckus from her group didn’t seem to attract their attention. Perhaps the zombies’ hearing wasn’t fully developed yet. That was a good thing—it made their mission a bit easier.

They arrived on the first floor quietly and swiftly. Luo Bingting looked at the fire door she had locked earlier. The atmosphere here was completely different. The fire escape on the upper floors had windows, but this door opened into a pitch-black world. She decided not to conserve her mental energy any longer—safety first.

Meng Ge held the flashlight, lighting the way, while An Min took over the responsibility of illuminating the path ahead. Luo Bingting focused on using her mental energy to scout for any signs of zombies. The first underground level was a parking garage, and its vast area made it impossible for her mental energy to cover it entirely. For now, she hadn’t detected any zombie presence in the stairwell area.

They couldn’t afford to let their guard down. The cautious group moved quickly, needing to cross through the first basement parking lot to find the passage leading down to the second basement.

That’s right—the fire escape only connected to the first basement; they had no idea where the entrance to the second basement was.

Luo Bingting felt an inexplicable sense of anxiety creeping in. Logically, it made sense that the parking lot and the lab wouldn’t share the same entrance. The lab was far too important for that.

Meng Ge decided to stick close to the walls and observe carefully. Although the power was out, the emergency exit’s green lights were still glowing, providing some guidance toward the exit.

Following Meng Ge, they finally arrived at the parking lot’s exit. The guard booth was empty, and there were no zombies in sight, but the parking lot was full of vehicles, likely belonging to the employees upstairs. 

Disappointment washed over her as they failed to find the lab’s entrance. Luo Bingting wondered if perhaps there was no way to access the lab from the parking garage at all. Would employees who drove to work really have to take the parking lot’s exit to get in? That wouldn’t be a sensible design. There had to be elevators or staircases for convenience. So what crucial detail had they overlooked?

As she pondered, Meng Ge suddenly stopped, switched off his flashlight, and gestured for everyone to crouch down and hide.

Just as they concealed themselves in the shadows between the vehicles and the walls, they heard the sound of hurried footsteps approaching. Luo Bingting peered through a car window and saw a man in combat gear running down, a handgun in hand, followed closely by three disheveled women holding their phones with flashlights, one of whom was wearing a striking red dress. Behind them were four men in suits and white dress shirts, and finally, four more armed individuals in combat gear.

“Are they military? Armed police or special forces?” Luo Bingting thought, refraining from revealing themselves. It was best to avoid any interactions and not interfere with their search.

Unfortunately, fate had other plans. The leading man headed straight toward their hiding spot, making everyone hold their breath. Thankfully, he stopped not too far away and found a corner to rest, the only sound in the parking lot being their heavy breathing.

“Deputy team leader, why haven’t the captain and the others caught up yet?” one of the men in combat gear asked the leader.

“Just wait a bit longer; don’t rush,” the leading man reassured him.

The questioner had more to say, but suddenly a woman’s voice interrupted.

“Why aren’t you taking us out of here? What are we waiting for?” It was the woman in the red dress.

Though it was dark below, the light from their phones dimly illuminated their features. The women were all quite beautiful, exuding a kind of alluring charm, but the tone of the red-dressed woman was anything but pleading; it was laced with an annoying sense of entitlement.

“The captain hasn’t returned yet, and we still have a mission. We can’t leave,” the deputy team leader replied, his irritation evident as he struggled to contain his emotions.

“You...” The woman in the red dress started to say something but was interrupted by another woman beside her, who gently tugged at her arm and urged softly, “Sally, don’t panic. They’ll definitely get us out of here.”

That voice sent chills down Luo Bingting’s spine. She focused intently in that direction, determined to see the person’s face. That voice—like a whisper from a demon—was one she would recognize anywhere. Her heart raced as she fought to remain calm, but she knew that if she confirmed who it was, she would have no choice but to act.

Meng Ge noticed something was off with Luo Bingting, ready to stand up, but he quickly pressed her shoulder down and shook his head in response to her gaze. It was too soon to reveal their identities; they needed more information.

Luo Bingting’s fingers went cold as she heard that voice. It felt as if she had been transported back to her past life—the pain in her wrist, the wounds on her face, and the dagger that had pierced her heart. Those pains had never truly faded. She had thought that in this new life, she could forget all the darkness, but just one word from that woman had rendered her utterly defenseless, stirring up a mix of rage and fear within her.

Her hand had already retrieved the handgun sent by the arms dealer from her space. She resolved that as soon as she confirmed the woman’s identity, she would shoot her without hesitation.

Fingers gripping the cold gun handle, her heartbeat began to steady once more.
