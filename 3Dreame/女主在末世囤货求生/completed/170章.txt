**Biological Tower**

"Ah, Miss Luo, you're joking at a time like this!" 

An Min felt a bit exasperated. Shouldn't they hear both the good news and the bad news? Why the insistence on order? 

"The good news first: we’re off to a great start!" 

Zhu Yi Dan was clearly a childhood friend who could easily be swayed by Luo Bing Ting’s charm. 

"The good news is that Meng and the others should be inside, just as we expected, and the head of the guard team should be there too." 

Xie Jing Hang was taken aback by this news. Where did this information come from? 

"And the bad news?" 

Zhu Yi Dan could easily earn the title of a supportive friend; she was really being considerate. 

"The bad news is, I can't guarantee that they’re all still alive." 

Once Luo Bing Ting finished speaking, the atmosphere in the room froze for a moment, particularly for An Min and Luo Fan. They had never truly faced life-and-death moments in this post-apocalyptic world, so their sense of mortality wasn't as strong. However, Zhu Yi Dan and Xie Jing Hang were different; they had witnessed it firsthand. 

"No matter what, we have to bring them home. Let’s go!" 

As they approached the tower, Luo Bing Ting used her mental powers to probe the surroundings. There were no mutated plants in sight, but she couldn’t scan inside the building; it seemed some sort of barrier was blocking her abilities. 

She walked ahead with Xie Jing Hang while An Min and Luo Fan followed behind. Zhu Yi Dan, positioned safely in the middle, was still observing closely. Just as they got near the entrance, she called out, "Luo Luo, look at this!" 

Zhu Yi Dan hurried toward a stone pillar by the entrance. She had spotted something shiny glinting in the soft morning light, barely visible unless one looked closely. 

Luo Bing Ting saw Zhu Yi Dan bend down to pick something up, then proudly opened her palm to show them. 

"A button!" 

"Yes! This button was custom-made by my mom for my dad. It must have fallen off his shirt. They’re definitely inside!" 

As she spoke, Zhu Yi Dan’s voice began to tremble with emotion as she clutched her father’s button tightly. She was determined to bring her family back. 

"We need to move quickly!" 

Xie Jing Hang said gravely, and the others nodded in agreement. 

Luo Bing Ting gripped her weapon tightly. This futuristic tech was impressive; it reduced the consumption of her powers and looked pretty cool too. 

They pushed open the shattered glass doors of the tower, which revealed a dark interior. Switching on their flashlights, the group began their search, targeting the underground first. After all, their past experience rescuing people from a biological lab had shown them that the final lab was surprisingly underground, which had been a strange experience. 

However, this biological tower seemed too normal. The first three underground floors turned out to be parking garages, where they encountered only a few zombies. 

Returning to the first floor, they took a moment to catch their breath before starting their systematic search floor by floor. Initially, they thought that since there were so few zombies in the underground parking lot, the entire building must have been cleared out. Even if there were zombies, they would be rare. But as soon as they stepped onto the first section of the fire escape stairs, it was as if they had poked a zombie nest. A horde of fast-moving zombies lunged toward them. 

Zhu Yi Dan was momentarily stunned. Luo Fan reacted quickly, using his powers to freeze a few zombies that were less than twenty centimeters away from them. Luo Bing Ting and Xie Jing Hang quickly dispatched the zombies with their air guns and electric stuns, reducing them to pulp. 

"Hey, a crystal core!" 

An Min suddenly shouted. 

"What do you need a bicycle for? With so many agile zombies, are you trying to risk your life for a reward?" 

Zhu Yi Dan retorted as she unleashed her fire abilities, tossing flames while taking jabs at An Min, seamlessly juggling both tasks. 

Luo Fan had learned how to conserve his energy; after freezing the zombies, he would stop his powers if any of the four could handle it, allowing for a well-coordinated attack. Before long, they had a pile of zombie corpses at their feet. 

The effectiveness of the air gun was astonishing; the closer they got, the more damage it dealt. Many zombies that hadn’t even approached yet were left mangled within the weapon's range. 

"Wow, this is so disgusting! It’s all in pieces!" 

An Min was grossed out by the sight of dismembered remains everywhere. Killing zombies had never resulted in such utter destruction; there were hardly any intact bodies left. 

"Stop complaining. If you had taken a few more shots while you were at it, there wouldn’t be this much mess!" 

"Hey, stop targeting me! I barely get to do anything around here! Now I can’t even pick up any seeds. How about we play some cards instead?" 

"Get to work; quit goofing around!" 

Luo Bing Ting couldn’t stand seeing just herself and Xie Jing Hang working hard while An Min and the others slacked off. 

"Yes, Boss!" 

Xie Jing Hang had initially thought that there would only be a few hundred zombies, and once they were dealt with, it would be over. However, just as he was about to take a breather, another wave of lively zombies came rushing at them from the underground passage. It seemed they had been lying in wait; otherwise, why hadn’t they emerged from the parking lot earlier? 

An Min and the others quickly realized something was off and began ramping up their attacks. But their stamina was too low, and they all turned pale as their powers began to dwindle. Xie Jing Hang ignored the risk of exposure and exchanged three air guns, handing them out to the others, especially to Luo Fan, urging him to take a break while he regained his energy. 

An Min had long coveted the air gun. However, now that he finally had one in his hands, he was forced to fight before he could even appreciate it. Fueled by a desire to kill, he fired decisively and quickly. 

They were amazed by the air gun’s rapid-fire capabilities and its destructive power. Previously, they had watched Luo Bing Ting blast zombies to pieces, but now that it was their turn, they felt the urge to obliterate the zombies completely. 

Zhu Yi Dan had also become bloodthirsty. She was the first to appreciate the smooth, endless firing of the weapon; it was just too satisfying and powerful. 

One word: awesome. 

Luo Fan, having restored some of his powers, helped eliminate some zombies that were sneaking up from tricky angles. His coordination was impeccable; he would freeze the zombies with his left hand while blasting them with the air gun in his right. He didn’t even need to aim for the head like with regular firearms. 

Even if his aim wasn’t on the zombies, the air gun would still turn them into mush. 

Were it not for the circumstances, they would have let out maniacal laughter. 

"Here they come again!" 

Luo Bing Ting’s mental powers couldn’t penetrate the building, but her senses remained sharp. They were soon surrounded by layers of zombies. 

As the pile of corpses grew higher, their movement became increasingly restricted. Luo Bing Ting expressed her concerns to Xie Jing Hang, who glanced toward the fire escape. It seemed they had to move upward. 

Zombies were also pouring down the fire escape. They had no idea how many were left. Luo Bing Ting looked at the only escape route and wore a determined expression. It was now or never; worst case, they could retreat into their space. 

She signaled for everyone to move toward the fire escape. Xie Jing Hang led the way with two guns blazing, sending zombie limbs flying in every direction. He was forced to exchange for several protective masks, mainly to avoid getting splattered with blood and guts, though he wasn’t overly worried about the virus—he just found it incredibly disgusting. 

Luo Bing Ting wanted to remind him about sensible spending, but then she remembered how many zeros were in Xie Jing Hang’s system account. If he didn’t spend it, then why not? Plus, spending would yield more seeds to collect.
