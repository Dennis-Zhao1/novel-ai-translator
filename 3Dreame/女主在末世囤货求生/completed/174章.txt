**The Struggle Between Two Forces**

Luo Bingting obediently stepped back several paces, the seriousness in Xie Jinghang's tone making her acutely aware of the gravity of the situation. The coldness of his voice sent chills down her spine, making her rub her arms as goosebumps began to form.

“What’s over there?” 

After witnessing various mutated plants and animals, Luo Bingting could hardly imagine what else could possibly surprise her. 

“Nothing good, but the Noisy Ghost has discovered some new issues,” Xie Jinghang replied calmly as he approached. Luo Bingting’s curiosity piqued even more—could this be related to the system?

“The Noisy Ghost wants to consult Xuanying about something. Do you think now is a good time?” 

Nodding in response, Luo Bingting grabbed Xie Jinghang's arm, and in the next moment, they found themselves in a spatial realm. The Noisy Ghost entered but quickly vanished, seemingly in a hurry. Xie Jinghang and Luo Bingting sat on the grass, looking up at the large screen of Xuanying, waiting for Xie Jinghang to fill her in on the details.

“Just now, there were spider webs everywhere. The black widow spiders in the caves near the fortress are also here, and there are many cocoons and spider eggs. We shouldn’t linger; we need to find them and leave quickly.”

Xie Jinghang's tone was calm, but Luo Bingting felt a chill run down her spine. This place was a den of poison; it was full of dangers. 

“Why does the system want to consult Xuanying?” 

Luo Bingting's second concern was this.

“The Noisy Ghost said it detected abnormal energy fluctuations here and suspects that there are organisms similar to it,” Xie Jinghang explained.

“Is the system an organism?” 

Xie Jinghang hadn’t expected Luo Bingting would ask that.

“Yes, the Noisy Ghost also has a physical form on its planet.”

“The other one must be Fu Buqi's system, then. Our previous analysis wasn’t wrong after all.” Luo Bingting didn’t understand why Xie Jinghang's system would be so agitated; hadn’t they already deduced this? Otherwise, how could they explain Fu Buqi's unusual events?

“It doesn’t believe it and insists on confirming for itself.” 

“So this matter is confirmed then?” 

“Yeah, Fu Buqi's system is likely more powerful than it; otherwise, it wouldn’t be this anxious.”

“Hmph, host, I can hear everything you guys are saying! Who said that broken thing is stronger than me? If it were really stronger, I wouldn’t have detected it. It’s clearly a low-level system yet capable of causing such bizarre events.”

“What’s going on? Have you come to any conclusions?” 

Luo Bingting looked up at the large screen, which only displayed the Noisy Ghost's words. She was eager to know what Xuanying could help the Noisy Ghost with.

“No conclusions yet. Brother Xuanying doesn’t understand; it shouldn’t be an old acquaintance of his. That complicates things. I need to report to the main brain, but…” 

“Don’t report yet; there are too many unanswered questions here.” 

Xuanying suddenly spoke up, and the subtitles changed to simplified Chinese. Luo Bingting felt something was off but couldn’t pinpoint what.

“Well… okay, I’ll definitely listen to Brother Xuanying. Hehe, so what do we do next?”

“Wait until we find its location; I’ll have a way.” 

“Alright, let’s head out and find it quickly.”

Luo Bingting and Xie Jinghang watched the two non-corporeal mysterious beings chatting happily on the screen, but in reality, they had nothing useful to offer. With a silent sigh, they exited the spatial realm.

Luo Bingting speculated that her mental energy and five senses being blocked was also the work of Fu Buqi’s system. If so, that meant it was likely stronger than the Noisy Ghost. 

At that moment, the Noisy Ghost urged Xie Jinghang to find Fu Buqi quickly and not to waste time elsewhere. Originally wanting to eliminate those disgusting creatures, Xie Jinghang hesitated, glancing at Luo Bingting.

“The Noisy Ghost is eager to find Fu Buqi, so let’s ignore the spider eggs for now.”

“Are we going to be surrounded by the spiders that hatch later?” 

“Quick and decisive action. I just checked; there are no signs of hatching yet, so we should have some time. Let’s go up and find them first.”

“Okay, let’s call Anmin.” 

The two hurried back to the office where they had just rested. Although the exhausted group hadn’t slept, they looked utterly worn out. 

Luo Bingting thought for a moment and took three bottles of spring water to give them, hoping it would boost their energy and speed up their recovery of abilities. 

It should be somewhat useful. 

She briefly told the three about the situation, downplaying the severity, and after everyone was ready, they set off immediately. The large horde of zombies that Luo Bingting and the others had led to the fourth and fifth floors had mostly cleared the hallways, allowing them to ascend quickly.

The five of them decided to go straight to the top floor. The Noisy Ghost was also urging them on; it couldn’t wait to encounter that so-called system.

It was as if one mountain could not accommodate two tigers, and one world could not have two systems.

Xie Jinghang occasionally relayed the Noisy Ghost’s actions to Luo Bingting, indicating that it could indeed inflict some damage and hinder the opponent. Clearly, the barrier that had been blocking her mental energy and senses had vanished, allowing her to faintly sense the situation throughout the entire building. The overwhelming presence of countless creatures sent shivers down her spine, even her fingertips tingling with unease.

This was too shocking! Unable to hold back, she exclaimed several times, unable to believe she was experiencing such a nightmare of claustrophobia in her lifetime.

The giant ugly flower spider was nothing compared to what she was witnessing now.

Suppressing her disgust, she closed her eyes for a moment, trying desperately to locate Meng Ge and Xiao Lu’s crystal cores among the chaotic, flickering lights. This was the only way to quickly pinpoint their positions.

However, with so many floors, there were crystal cores of mutated plants, animals, and zombies on almost every level, making it extremely difficult to distinguish between them.

She needed to filter through this quickly; after finding them, she planned to blow up the entire building. This den of poison couldn’t be left behind.

Watching her suddenly take such ruthless action, as if she were a god of destruction, the others were somewhat taken aback, following her lead to deal with the remaining threats.

The recovery of her mental energy allowed her to discover she could easily control some small, non-intelligent mutated plants, putting them into a dormant state, like the rambutan, but this took a significant toll. She needed to conserve her energy to find people, so using it sparingly was key.

The higher they went, the more careful they had to be with their weapons; the air gun had too much power. If they damaged the building’s structural integrity, they might collapse it before rescuing anyone.

Anmin and the others, who initially fired randomly without aiming, exposed the steel reinforcement of a column, only realizing the danger after Xie Jinghang’s warning. They couldn’t act recklessly; a reckless end could lead to disaster. 

Endless waves of zombies, sporadic mental energy effectiveness, and a constant influx of mutated plants and animals—the most disgusting of all were the insects and reptiles. There weren’t any large ones, but the small ones were everywhere.

Hearing Luo Bingting complain, Zhu Yidan helplessly replied, “What do you mean these mutated animals are small? Did you see that spider that just crawled by? It was as big as a basketball! Is that small?”

Luo Bingting was left speechless by her best friend’s retort. She had to admit, in comparison to their original sizes, they had inflated by nearly a hundred times; they were indeed not small at all.

“Okay, okay, I get it! I misphrased that; it’s my bad.” 

As a girl who was afraid of insects, it was entirely reasonable for Zhu Yidan to have a meltdown. No one claimed that those who dared fight zombies weren’t afraid of spiders. Luo Bingting felt her mental resilience was decent; if it were someone else, they’d probably go crazy.
