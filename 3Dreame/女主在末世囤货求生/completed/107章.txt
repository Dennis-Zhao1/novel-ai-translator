**Dragon Rising Base**

After a moment's thought, it was clear they couldn't disclose the actual situation regarding the ability-enhancing serum just yet. Their mission to Dragon Rising Base had two main objectives: first, to determine the stance of the base's leader, Pei Qian, and second, to assess the base's actual strength. The fact that Pei Qian had set his sights on them meant they were not to be underestimated.

A powerful base aligned with Pei Qian's interests could easily be destroyed, but if that base didn't care about Pei Qian's life or death, then there would be plenty of room for negotiation. They could simply exchange benefits, as long as Pei Qian was out of the picture.

Seeing the serious expressions on the faces of the two, Dr. Zhang also felt the situation was precarious enough to avoid any announcements for the time being, even keeping things under wraps within their own team for a while. Luo Bingtian hoped they could conduct more experiments or closely observe Xiao Lu, to ensure there were no adverse reactions or side effects; the development timeline for the serum had been too short, and they needed a wealth of data for validation.

Xie Jinghang proposed that they wait until they returned. If Xiao Lu remained in good health, they could select volunteers from the escort team to participate in the ability activation tests; surely, many would be willing.

Luo Bingtian suggested they could consider the opposite approach—perhaps they could develop a serum that negates abilities. However, when she made the joke, she wasn't sure Dr. Zhang took it seriously.

In the end, the first vial of the ability-enhancing serum went to Luo Bingtian. Dr. Zhang looked at her with unwavering determination and said, “This is the first time I've undertaken such a groundbreaking project; you absolutely must accept this first vial!”

Luo Bingtian felt a bit uncomfortable under his intense gaze and quickly took the vial, making her exit.

Xie Jinghang shot Dr. Zhang a look, gave a soft snort, and followed her out.

Left behind, Dr. Zhang remained in high spirits, rubbing his hands together like a child who just discovered a new toy. Xiao Lu entered the room and found his mentor celebrating like a fly that had just found fresh dung, completely ignoring him as he returned to the data console to conduct his tests.

They set off with just one vehicle, a modified seven-seater armored car with ample space. The roof was stocked with weapons and ammunition. Meng Ge drove, with Xie Jinghang in the passenger seat, Luo Bingtian sitting in the middle row, alongside An Min, who was sharing snacks with two team members in the back.

Xie Jinghang observed their lighthearted banter, especially An Min, who had become quite chatty, his words flowing quickly and clearly. He regaled them with amusing tales of sparring with other ability users in the training grounds, causing Luo Bingtian to laugh heartily. However, Xie Jinghang felt a twinge of annoyance—how could they have snacks and not share any with him? Did they really not see him sitting there?

Not wanting to lose face in front of the team members, he maintained a cold demeanor and pointedly directed Meng Ge where to go.

Dragon Rising Base wasn't located in the capital city but rather near it, in Jin City. There was only the Dragon Rising Base there, a large-scale facility with a substantial number of ability users, but even more ordinary people.

Pei Qian had been a businessman in Jin City before the apocalypse, but in reality, he was the leader of an underground organization. He had emerged from the criminal underworld and gone legitimate, dabbling in real estate and entertainment, while also being quite savvy in finance. He managed to acquire funds through legitimate channels, paying taxes properly, and more importantly, he knew how to conduct himself with propriety. Even being so close to the capital, they turned a blind eye to him; after all, numerous inspections had failed to find anything amiss, leaving no chance to catch him off-guard.

Those who conspired against him were dealt with swiftly and effectively, leading to the core team at Dragon Rising Base being largely comprised of his former subordinates from his previous life, all of whom had made names for themselves in their respective industries—far from the small-time thugs fighting over street corners or engaging in petty debts.

Thinking about this trip to Dragon Rising Base, Xie Jinghang felt a flicker of hope; perhaps he'd run into an old buddy from his past life, and maybe he could convince him to leave, helping him avoid a certain fate.

He glanced over at Luo Bingtian, who was now munching on duck necks and carcasses, expressionlessly extending her hand, making it impossible for him to ignore his request.

Rolling her eyes, she begrudgingly handed him a piece of duck neck. Not angered, Xie Jinghang took it and began to munch.

Luo Bingtian then turned to assemble a plate of vegetarian snacks made from kelp, edamame, potato chips, and lotus slices, handing a bottle of her specially frozen soda to An Min, who was tearing up from the spiciness. She couldn’t help but laugh along with the team members in the back, teasing An Min about how he, a Hangzhou native, couldn’t handle spicy food.

When she looked up again, she saw Xie Jinghang's hand pointing at the soda, making a gesture as if to ask for it. This time, she shot him a glare but ultimately relented and passed him a bottle.

Meng Ge watched the group eating and drinking through the rearview mirror, feeling a bit left out. Before he could comment, An Min shoved a half-eaten duck neck into Meng Ge's mouth.

“Here, Meng Ge, you eat it! I can't take this heat anymore; it’s killing me!” An Min exclaimed, guzzling the soda while wiping away tears, glancing enviously at the others who were still enjoying their snacks.

“Unfair! Why are you all so good at eating spicy food? What’s wrong with me?” 

Without even turning around, Xie Jinghang coolly remarked, “Some people just can’t handle their spice; a little brother is just a little brother.”

His teasing sent everyone into fits of laughter, while An Min nearly exploded with frustration. Thankfully, Luo Bingtian quickly handed him a five-spice marinated egg to calm him down.

“Luo Jie, your spatial abilities are too powerful! Why do I only have one ability? I’m so envious!” 

Seeing that the marinated egg couldn’t sufficiently gag An Min, Luo Bingtian decided to dig out some Northeast specialty sticky rice dumplings she had stashed away and stuffed one into his mouth.

The world went quiet except for An Min, whose mouth was now stuck shut with the sticky rice dumpling, making him whine helplessly.

Xie Jinghang nearly burst out laughing but coughed lightly into his fist to cover it up.

Their journey was not without obstacles; the city’s ring road had been cleared before, but after the last zombie wave attack, the road conditions were far from ideal. Luckily, among their two team members was a terrain manipulator who used quite a few crystal cores to restore some level of smoothness to the road.

Meng Ge supervised the operation while Luo Bingtian and An Min cleared the zombies that wandered too close, which now were far more resilient and had abilities of their own. They seemed well aware of their surroundings, and before Luo Bingtian could even spot them, they were already drawn to the sound of the vehicle.

As they moved along, clearing zombies and collecting crystal cores, what should have taken an hour stretched into half a day due to the constant stops and starts.

Eventually, they exited the highway and meandered through the city until Xie Jinghang pointed out a building, announcing, "We’re here."

Luo Bingtian looked up, realizing that Dragon Rising Base had actually been converted from the Dragon Rising Tower!

Suddenly reminded of her own Mingzhu Group Tower, Xie Jinghang explained as he saw her lost in thought, “On the day of the outbreak, Pei Qian happened to be holding a shareholders' meeting in Dragon Rising Tower with his core team. When the zombies attacked, he decisively took out a number of them and organized a resource search, sheltering many survivors. He reacted faster than the government, which greatly boosted his reputation locally. Our fortress hasn’t had anyone from Jin City come to seek refuge because their first choice has always been Dragon Rising Base.”

Luo Bingtian nodded in understanding. Pei Qian was indeed a strong leader with sharp decision-making skills, which explained why in her previous life, he overshadowed Kunshan Base and became the top base.

Just as their vehicle approached the main entrance of Dragon Rising Tower, a group of ability users suddenly surrounded them. Meng Ge and Xie Jinghang reacted instantly; one slammed the brakes while the other quickly launched an electric net, startling the opposing ability users.

Before long, a beautiful woman with long hair emerged from among the ability users. In the early June heat, she wore a tight black top, faded blue overalls, and flat black boots, her figure striking and her demeanor commanding. However, her expression was less than pleasant as she approached and ordered them to leave.

Luo Bingtian was momentarily taken aback; she assumed Xie Jinghang had previously angered this woman, and now he was being confronted directly. To her surprise, Xie Jinghang looked just as bewildered.

Just then, the woman launched a fireball toward them. Xie Jinghang responded with a precise bolt of lightning that extinguished the fireball mid-flight.

With her ability interrupted, the woman now focused intently on their vehicle, her gaze locked in.

It felt as if time had stopped for everyone present, with An Min readying his wind blades, waiting for the signal. What would happen next? Would they fight or not? This group was really driving him crazy!
