**Face to Face**

Meng Ge had clearly recovered; he began to help the ability users rehydrate. This was a precious resource—drinking more would aid in their recovery faster. Zhu Yi Dan shook his head at Meng Ge's rough demeanor.

Lo Bing Ting observed the scene, realizing it was just a matter of time before they moved on. She decided to hurry back to the lab's entrance to lend a hand.

“Host, I’m detecting that the energy fluctuations from that system are getting closer. We need to catch it quickly!” 

“Fu Buqi should be on this floor. Let's go meet him,” Xie Jing Cheng said to Lo Bing Ting.

Upon hearing this, Lo Bing Ting’s eyes lit up. They were so close! This coward had been hiding from them for so long, causing so much trouble. With old grudges and new animosities, today was the day they wouldn’t let him off easy.

“Let’s go. An Min, you all hold the fort here. Call me as soon as everyone wakes up,” she instructed before quickly catching up with Xie Jing Cheng. They were off to catch the turtle, clearing the various mutated plants, animals, and zombies that had surrounded them as they moved.

“Host, turn left. Yes, the energy fluctuations are becoming more pronounced,” the noisy spirit directed.

Xie Jing Cheng silently followed the spirit’s guidance, while Lo Bing Ting used her mental energy to discern the changes in the surrounding crystal cores. Unfortunately, there were too many and too mixed up; she couldn’t pinpoint the exact location. At that moment, having a reliable teammate was crucial.

Even though their progress was slow, it didn’t halt their advance. Fortunately, these creatures were afraid of fire—except for the zombies. The zombies were easy to clear out. Lo Bing Ting had long since stopped caring about collecting zombie crystal cores, simply controlling her mental energy to explode the cores in the zombies' heads. The zombies would collapse as if their power systems had been yanked out, unable to rise again.

Their cooperation grew increasingly seamless, and their pace quickened.

“Host, it’s just ahead—about ten meters, just ten meters away.”

Xie Jing Cheng looked up at their position; they seemed to be at the edge of this floor. The number of mutated plants, animals, and zombies had decreased significantly, as if a barrier was protecting them. Once they stepped into that range, there were virtually no zombies left—like being in a barrier space.

“We’ve arrived, Host. Remember to listen to my commands,” the spirit reminded.

Lo Bing Ting blasted open the door of the room where Fu Buqi might be hiding but found no one inside. Turning to look at Xie Jing Cheng, she hadn’t even opened her mouth to ask when she heard a voice she could never forget from her past life.

“Looking for me?”

Only the voice echoed in the air; she carefully inspected the room and realized it had previously served some unknown purpose. Speakers were installed in the ceiling, and Fu Buqi’s voice had just emanated from there.

“Host, don’t let him fool you; he’s right in there,” the spirit said confidently. Its sensing abilities were sharp enough not to misidentify positions. Such a basic mistake was beneath its advanced system…

Suddenly, Xie Jing Cheng launched an attack at one wall of the room, causing the plaster to crumble. Moments later, the gypsum board beneath was revealed.

It was merely a partition; although the door was invisible, Xie Jing Cheng had surely locked onto the location.

Lo Bing Ting didn’t bother with explosives; the air gun’s power was adequate, and the partition wasn’t particularly sturdy. They were mainly worried about Fu Buqi escaping. In no time, Xie Jing Cheng had made a significant hole in the gypsum wall, and sure enough, they saw a figure in black clothing trying to exit through another opening.

They had come this far; there was no way they would let him escape so easily!

Xie Jing Cheng dashed forward rapidly, with Lo Bing Ting hot on his heels as they began to chase him through the floor.

Clearly, Fu Buqi was also wary of the zombies, daring not to run toward the more zombie-infested areas. It was truly ironic that the very creations he had made filled him with fear. What was his purpose in doing so?

Was it to retaliate against society, the world, and all of humanity?

Staying right on his tail, Lo Bing Ting occasionally predicted his movements with her air gun, causing him to scramble in a panic.

The distance closed in rapidly, and they finally reached an open sky garden. Fu Buqi finally stopped running, taking a deep breath, still panting, and flashed a meaningful smile at the two relentless pursuers behind him.

It was as if he had everything under control. Lo Bing Ting’s memories from her past life sharpened at that moment. She suddenly realized that every time Fu Buqi wore such a smile, significant events followed, like when he took control of the Kunshan Base in her previous life.

At that time, he had smoothly ascended to the leader of the base, unlike now, where he seemed to be hiding and dodging like a rat.

Furrowing her brows, she wondered what kind of trick Fu Buqi was planning this time. She had suffered too much at his hands in the past; she just wanted to pin him down and end it.

Her heart felt one way, and her actions followed suit. Seeing the girl in front of him, Fu Buqi felt a surge of anger. He had hoarded supplies for so long, and if it weren’t for her meddling, he would have already been the supreme leader of this country.

Now, he was forced to hide, like a rat scurrying away from the light.

But today, he and his accomplice would pay for their actions.

“I’ve heard that young girls love flowers and plants. Look around; this place is filled with famous flowers and plants. Do you like it?” Fu Buqi said, seemingly ignoring the tense atmosphere and current situation, grinning like a Cheshire cat as he feigned concern for Lo Bing Ting’s opinion on the garden. It was utterly bewildering.

“Cut the crap. Do you think that by saying all this nonsense, you can escape death?” Lo Bing Ting replied coldly.

“Girls shouldn’t harbor such a heavy killing intent, why bother?” 

Xie Jing Cheng had been closely observing Fu Buqi’s micro-expressions and noticed that he didn’t seem as relaxed as he pretended to be. His heart sank.

Without warning, he suddenly launched a surprise attack on Fu Buqi, not giving him a chance to respond.

Fu Buqi had intended to engage in witty banter, but he was caught off guard by the young man’s sudden assault.

What could an old dog like him do besides talk? Clearly, nothing. He quickly turned to flee, but he only ran in circles around the garden, which raised suspicions.

Lo Bing Ting circled him from another direction, but suddenly tripped as a mass of mutated plants sprang up, intending to attack them.

How naive! With her Blazing Dragon in hand, what plant could threaten her?

She swiftly escaped and incinerated the plants that got in her way, making Fu Buqi grind his teeth in frustration.

“You actually have such weapons!”

His words dripped with disbelief. He had found the air gun bizarre enough, but he never expected a flamethrower with such power!

“Ha ha ha! How’s that? Are you furious?” Lo Bing Ting couldn’t help but taunt him, enjoying his discomfort.

Xie Jing Cheng had already leapt forward, aiming to pin him down, but once again, the mutated plants obstructed their assault.
