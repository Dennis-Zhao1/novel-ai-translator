Title: The Sword's Embrace

In an instant, a strange phenomenon unfolded before her. Without fully understanding why, Luo Bingtian instinctively activated her spiritual energy and energy-gazing technique. To her astonishment, the ornate sword hanging from the wooden beams of the hall glimmered with a sharp, silvery light under her gaze. It radiated a chilling aura, as if it possessed a tangible temperature, cold as frost, sending shivers through her senses.

As if sensing Luo Bingtian's intense scrutiny, An Min looked up as well. His eyes sparkled with delight as he glanced at the numbers on the calculator, and he eagerly began to introduce the sword. “This is our family's heirloom sword, passed down for a hundred years. Isn’t it beautiful?”

Luo Bingtian found herself unable to look away, maintaining her gaze upwards as she nodded in agreement. “I think it’s stunning—far more beautiful than any of the ones here.”

Curiosity getting the better of her, she asked, “How much does it cost?”

An Min paused, scratching his head. “I’m not sure. No one’s ever asked before. I’ll check with my uncle in a bit.”

At that moment, Manager Zheng stepped out to take a phone call, and it seemed to last quite a while. When he returned, he was profusely apologizing, careful not to offend this important client who had just bought over ten swords, all from renowned artisans, each priced no less than a hundred thousand.

“It’s alright,” Luo Bingtian replied with a smile, then pointed at the sword hanging from the ceiling. “Can I take a look at this one?”

Manager Zheng was startled and quickly replied, “That sword is used to suppress evil spirits. It has hung there for a century and cannot be moved.”

His earnestness didn’t seem fabricated. Under her energy-gazing technique, the sword’s cold radiance intensified, prompting Luo Bingtian to swiftly retract her spiritual energy and calm her racing heart. Manager Zheng’s words seemed to hold truth; it was their family treasure, and perhaps she should refrain from coveting it. Regardless of the apocalyptic world outside, its purpose remained intact.

Being a descendant of a family steeped in metaphysics, Luo Bingtian held a deep respect for the laws of cause and effect. She relaxed her mind and watched An Min continue writing the order with meticulous care. Instead of urging him to hurry, she took a moment to gaze at the other swords. After a while, she discreetly probed with her energy-gazing technique again, but none of the swords beneath the one she’d chosen radiated the same brilliance. Truly, a treasured heirloom that had been passed down for generations was unlike any other.

Admiring the sword again, she suddenly sensed something amiss. Was the sword swaying? Was it just her imagination? The movement was slight, but with her heightened senses, Luo Bingtian knew she couldn’t be mistaken.

She was so shocked that no sound escaped her lips. Meanwhile, Manager Zheng was busy verifying the accuracy of An Min's handwritten order, ensuring the pricing was correct to avoid any impact on the transaction.

An Min, feeling fatigued from writing, slowed his pace. No one was urging him, so he took his time. His uncle, standing nearby, wouldn’t dare slack off; being a bit slow wouldn’t earn him a reprimand.

Meng Ge, who was positioned where he couldn’t see Luo Bingtian’s expression, assumed she was still admiring the sword and thought she might want to take a look before leaving. “Even the young lady has things she can’t obtain; money isn’t always everything,” he mused inwardly.

Before he could finish his thoughts, an unexpected event occurred—the sword that had been hanging so steadily suddenly clattered down, landing squarely in Luo Bingtian's embrace.

Caught off guard by a sword falling into her arms, Luo Bingtian froze, gripping the sword's hilt tightly. Meng Ge's exclamation drew the attention of both Manager Zheng and An Min, who looked up to see their family heirloom cradled in her arms.

“What…?" Manager Zheng was left dumbfounded, unsure of how to react.

Suddenly, An Min recalled something. He dashed up the stairs, calling out, “Grandpa! Grandpa, there’s trouble! Quick, come down—the sword fell!”

In the study upstairs, Grandpa Zheng was startled by the sudden shout, causing his brush to tremble and drop ink onto a nearly finished work of art. The four prominent characters he had just written read: Dragon Spring Sword.

His masterpiece ruined, his mood soured instantly. He turned and yelled in his dialect, “You little rascal, what nonsense are you spouting? You’re the one in trouble, not me!”

An Min rushed upstairs, hesitating at the doorway to the study, wary of entering the line of fire. He feared a couple of swats from his grandfather would be disastrous.

Yet he was equally alarmed, pointing back downstairs as he stammered, “Grandpa, the heirloom sword hanging from the beams has fallen!”

Though he spoke quickly, each word was clear. Grandpa Zheng was not hard of hearing; he was in excellent health. Upon hearing the news, his eyes widened in shock, and he quickly dropped the brush, hurrying downstairs without a second thought, forgetting about his ruined artwork.

Luo Bingtian stood there, almost petrified, clutching the sword, too stunned to move. She had watched it sway and then tumble down, the pain of the impact overshadowed by her shock at what had just occurred.

Grandpa Zheng rushed down, swatting away An Min’s outstretched hand as he descended, clearly annoyed and wanting to avoid any delay. He would have kicked the little rascal for making a fuss if he hadn’t been so preoccupied.

As he finally laid eyes on the young girl sitting in the main hall, clutching the family’s treasured sword that had hung for centuries, his hands began to tremble uncontrollably. An Min, fearing his grandfather might faint, hurried to guide him to a seat beside Luo Bingtian.

Grandpa Zheng opened and closed his mouth several times, struggling to find the right words. Finally, Luo Bingtian took the initiative, saying, “Old sir, I’m just sitting here. I didn’t do anything. Truly, it wasn’t me; it was the sword that fell into my arms.”

She raised the sword as if to prove her innocence.

Grandpa Zheng took the sword from her, examining the chain used to hang it. It was made from the same material as the sword itself, forged perfectly, and it remained intact. He looked back up at the wooden beam where the sword had hung, searching for any signs of damage, but his age made it difficult to see clearly.

An Min, quick-witted, rushed to the back storage room to fetch a ladder. He set it up beside Luo Bingtian and climbed up, turning on a powerful flashlight to illuminate the spot where the sword had previously hung. He snapped several photos and recorded a video.

Showing the photos and videos to his grandfather and uncle, they found no abnormalities. The beam protruded a good ten centimeters, with a specially designed groove that was two centimeters wide and five centimeters deep. The hanging chain had been secured in that groove, ensuring it was stable.

The videos and photos revealed the groove was untouched, with no signs of disturbance or dust displaced. It was perplexing. Grandpa Zheng examined the area thoroughly, going back and forth multiple times, but everything remained the same.

Baffled and unable to comprehend what had happened, Manager Zheng took the sword from Grandpa Zheng, inspecting it for a long time without finding anything unusual.

Feeling a bit awkward, Luo Bingtian thought to herself that she had merely used her energy-gazing technique, so how could the sword not stay put? Wasn’t it supposed to guard the house? Why had it fallen into her arms instead?

The situation felt akin to an ancient scholar inadvertently seducing a cherished young lady after being invited to visit. Especially with her innocent expression and defensive posture, she appeared quite the rogue.

Grandpa Zheng and Manager Zheng remained silent for a long time, lost in their thoughts. An Min dared not speak, while Luo Bingtian was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, Grandpa Zheng seemed to remember something and urged An Min to go back upstairs again, insisting he needed to find a box for something.
