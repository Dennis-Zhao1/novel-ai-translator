**Confrontation**

After a few cars came to a halt, several elegantly dressed men began to step out, followed by a group of burly bodyguards armed with various weapons, including iron rods and machetes. 

Lo Bingting firmly closed the car door she had just exited, her fingers gripping the hilt of her precious sword as she raised her gaze. Among the group, she recognized Lu Mang, the youngest son of the Lu family, one of the four great clans, though the leader was a stranger to her.

Lu Mang had a reputation for being a troublemaker, unlike his more responsible brothers. He was notorious for his penchant for chasing women and stirring up trouble, often leaving his family to clean up the mess he created. 

This time, spotting such an impressive car and a stunning woman with a slender figure and a high ponytail, he couldn't help but feel emboldened. These arrogant second-generation rich kids were clearly planning to approach the beautiful girl for some fun.

"Isn't this the little princess of the Luo family? Long time no see!" Lu Mang's sleazy voice broke the silence. His dark circles and droopy eyelids hinted at a life of indulgence.

"Do I know you?" Lo Bingting replied, her brow furrowed. The way they carried themselves suggested they were up to no good.

"Come on, don’t be like that. We're all part of the same circle here; it’s just a little sad to hear you say that," Lu Mang said, his earlier bravado faltering slightly. He had always refrained from provoking Lo Bingting before, knowing her wealth rivaled his family’s and that she had powerful connections backing her.

But in this post-apocalyptic world, the glint in his eyes was unsettling, and he frequently exchanged knowing looks with his companions, making Lo Bingting wish she could rip his eyes out.

Ming, her bodyguard, sensed the tension and unbuckled his seatbelt before stepping out to stand protectively behind her. The leading man of the opposing group had already summoned Lu Mang over, and with her keen hearing, Lo Bingting caught him introducing himself and whispering something that implied she was easy to bully.

Suppressing a laugh, Lo Bingting was curious just how easily she could be bullied now in this new world. She wasn’t worried about Ming’s vigilance; there were no guns in sight, suggesting these men had been cooped up at home for too long, itching to cause trouble now that they were out.

From the looks of them, they likely had a history of intimidating weaker individuals, but this time, they had picked the wrong target.

The leader of the group, dressed in an impeccably tailored suit, exuded an air of refined arrogance, typical of a pampered heir from one of the aristocratic families. In a city like theirs, there were few who could afford to give the Lu family the star treatment, and being from a merchant background, Lo Bingting had never ventured into their high-society circles.

“Miss Luo, how about joining us for a few days at the Kunshan Base?” the leader suggested, his gaze roving over Lo Bingting appraisingly, clearly plotting something sinister. Ming clenched his fists, recognizing the lewd undertones in the proposition.

As the situation began to escalate, more members of their group emerged from the cars, totaling six who now stood behind Lo Bingting. The opposing group hadn’t anticipated that she would have such a formidable entourage with her. 

“I'm Li Liqiang, son of the Kunshan Base leader. My father, Li Qinfeng, I’m sure you’ve heard of him. It’s dangerous out here, and you, a delicate little lady, must be scared. Our base is very safe, with plenty of food and entertainment. Why don’t you come with us?” he continued, his voice dripping with insincerity.

Internally, Lo Bingting scoffed, managing to maintain a facade of polite amusement. “Ah, so it’s Young Master Li! I’ve long heard of your reputation. However, we have business to attend to and can’t accompany you,” she replied, casually slipping her hand into her pocket, where she prepared to draw her gun. In the military, being armed was standard, and surely, the Kunshan heir wouldn’t be foolish enough to roam without some means of self-defense.

“Force her into coming with us, Liqiang! This woman clearly doesn’t know what’s good for her!” shouted another rich kid, provoking his friends to move forward, ready to grab Lo Bingting.

Ming discreetly reached for his gun, poised to protect her.

With a bright smile, Lo Bingting let the midday sun illuminate her soft, delicate features, radiating warmth that could ignite the embers of courage in anyone who looked her way. 

“Are you talking about this?” she asked, raising her gun and showing it to them, deftly disengaging the safety. Ming also pulled out his gun, pointing it directly at Li Liqiang, positioning himself protectively in front of Lo Bingting.

The group of young men were taken aback, shocked that she actually had a gun and dared to point it at them. Lu Mang stuttered, “W-wait a minute. We can talk this out, right? I was just sincerely inviting you to our base…”

He was genuinely frightened now. Today, he had instigated this outing with the Kunshan heir, and spotting Lo Bingting, he thought she was familiar and attractive enough to draw them over. If anything happened to Liqiang, his father and brothers would surely devour him whole.

“Oh? So now we can talk calmly? Because from what I saw earlier, it looked like you were trying to kidnap me,” Lo Bingting taunted, shaking her gun playfully. 

Just then, a military jeep rolled in from Li Liqiang's direction, stopping behind the group. 

Lo Bingting recognized the man who stepped out. Rolling her eyes, she thought, “At a time like this, he still has to step out in sunglasses to act cool. Please.” 

It was Xie Jinghang, the Kunshan Base leader, who had heard his wayward son had snuck out and immediately dispatched his most trusted subordinate to track him down, ensuring his safety and bringing him back as soon as possible.

“Long time no see, Miss Luo,” Xie Jinghang greeted, stepping beside Li Liqiang, completely unfazed by the threatening gunpoint directed at them.

Lo Bingting’s mind flashed back to the time at the Dawn Tower when she had failed to eliminate that scheming vixen; she couldn’t be bothered to even roll her eyes at him, opting to ignore him entirely.

Li Liqiang, seeing his father’s most trusted aide arrive, felt his annoyance grow. He didn’t want to lose face in front of a woman, especially not with someone like Xie Jinghang present. “Miss Luo, are you deliberately asking for trouble?” he snapped.

With Xie Jinghang’s arrival, he wasn’t about to let things spiral out of control. He ordered his men to seize this ungrateful woman and ensure she was taken back for a proper lesson.

Lo Bingting refused to be intimidated by such threats, casually retorting, “Just because you say so? I’m just a lonely orphan, and if you anger me, I could easily trade in a Kunshan heir. Who knows, I might even snag a few more aristocrats. So tell me, who do you think the real winner will be in the end? I could walk away with a clean victory.”

Laughing mischievously, she seemed to find the whole situation rather amusing.

Li Liqiang’s furious demeanor began to cool, his initial rage replaced with reason as he understood her implication. 

Lu Mang, dripping with cold sweat, only wanted to get the Kunshan heir back safely. If anything happened to him, there would be hell to pay. 

Xie Jinghang looked at the girl who still shone brilliantly after months, noting that the base she lived in indeed treated her well. 

For a moment, nobody spoke. Lo Bingting softened her tone, “Oh come on, don’t be so downcast, Young Master Li. Today just isn’t the right time, but who knows? Maybe one day, I’ll pay a visit to your esteemed father at the Kunshan Base.” 

Xie Jinghang, who had initially intended to help defuse the situation, found himself taken aback by how effortlessly Lo Bingting laid out the stakes and dynamics, leaving him no room for maneuvering.
