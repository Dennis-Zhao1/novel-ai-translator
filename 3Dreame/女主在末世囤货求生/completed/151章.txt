**Unexpected Black Hole**

Luo Bingtin was taken aback. It didn’t make sense; they had been sending someone to deliver meals to her every day. How could she suddenly be dead?

“What happened?”

Behind An Min, a breathless ability user rushed in, responsible for guarding the premises.

“Miss Luo, I just went in to deliver the meal and found the prisoner dead... she was... tortured to death.”

Pei Qian and Pei Shang exchanged glances, realizing that this was quite a significant matter. Who could have such a grudge against the little white lotus? If it were merely to silence her, one blow would have sufficed. The fact that they took the time to torment her indicated there were people in the apocalypse fortress who harbored a deep-seated hatred for her. But it was for the best; she was just a small pawn.

After a moment of contemplation, Luo Bingtin glanced towards a figure in the training field.

Xie Jinghang followed her gaze, frowning slightly.

“Let her be. Just throw the body out; we don't want it stinking up our place.”

The person in charge nodded in agreement and hurried off to arrange for the cleanup.

Pei Qian remained noncommittal; this situation wasn’t worth their time or energy.

Xie Jinghang stole another glance at the figure in the crowd before returning to Luo Bingtin’s office with her.

They engaged in a friendly yet heated negotiation over the pricing of the ability enhancement potions. After several rounds of back-and-forth, Pei Qian secured what he deemed a reasonable price, and Luo Bingtin wore a pained expression, making him feel even better about the deal.

Xie Jinghang, having never been in business before, observed the fierce bargaining tactics with keen interest. He found it quite impressive—one party feeling like they had scored a victory while the other played up their losses, yet both sides knew the truth was somewhere in between.

How fascinating.

Pei Shang watched Luo Bingtin wield her words like a skilled swordswoman in the negotiation, her sharp tongue and quick wit even more enchanting than her regard for someone she had feelings for. Xie Jinghang sensed something was off, his brows furrowing deeper.

After they shook hands to finalize the order and total amount, a sense of ceremony enveloped them as Xiaohui drafted the contract for both parties to sign.

Seizing the moment, Pei Shang suggested they enhance their abilities within the fortress before returning to Longxiang Base. After all, making the trip was no simple feat. Pei Qian nodded in agreement, leaving oversight to Anna and another subordinate. They should be fine for a few days.

Dr. Zhu had also mentioned needing more experimental cases. The fortress was safe, allowing for real-time monitoring. Besides, she felt perfectly fine after her injection, much better than Zhu Erge and Little Lu.

Since they required cash upfront in exchange for the potions, and Pei Qian had to go out to gather crystal cores, Luo Bingtin wouldn’t accept any debts. Therefore, Xie Jinghang and the others would accompany the Longxiang Base personnel to hunt zombies, while she remained at the fortress to practice her new skills.

The day after Xie Jinghang and the others left the fortress, something bizarre occurred.

A deep, dark pit suddenly appeared in the fortress square, and no one knew when it had emerged. The earth-type ability users couldn’t fill it in; when they reported it to Luo Bingtin, she had just spent a long time in her spatial realm. Having mastered her new skill, she quickly changed her clothes and hurried to the scene.

It was indeed a massive black hole, measuring roughly ten cubic meters—about the size of a small room. The earth-type ability users looked pale, as if the black hole could swallow everything whole, and it showed no signs of responding.

Uncle Zhu dispatched people to fetch stones and soil from the back mountain, but to no avail. Luo Bingtin used her mental powers to probe it; not only was it unfathomably deep, but she couldn’t sense anything—not a zombie or any living creature.

They hastily arranged for a fence to prevent anyone from falling in. The crowd buzzed with speculation. The scientific faction suggested it was due to tectonic movement or the depletion of underground water leading to sinkholes, while the mystics claimed it was a dragon’s den—inside which a dragon was poised to ascend. Then there were the doomsayers who believed it was a tunnel dug by the zombie king, orchestrating earth-type zombies to slaughter everyone.

Luo Bingtin found the arguments from both the scientific and doomsday factions quite reasonable. After all, wasn’t the zombie king just Fu Buqi? However, whether the zombies had dug the tunnel remained uncertain. Strangely, her sixth sense kept insisting that the key lay with those four mutated plant seeds.

After calming the crowd, Luo Bingtin dismissed them, arranging for a team to enhance patrols in the vicinity. She also hung a large gong beneath the flagpole in the square; anyone who spotted unusual activity was to sound the alarm. Beyond that, she didn’t have a better solution.

There was something else she needed to do. Privately, she sought out Uncle Zhu, and once they were seated in her office, he spoke candidly.

“I was the one who killed that woman.”

Luo Bingtin raised an eyebrow, signaling him to continue.

“Little Luo, I’ve seen that woman getting cozy with Fu Buqi. She’s his woman.”

Luo Bingtin gasped in surprise. 

“When did you see Fu Buqi?”

“During the time you all went to Longxiang Base, I went out myself.”

“Uncle, you’re quite bold. Back then, you weren’t even an ability user. Didn’t you fear dying at the hands of zombies?”

“I’m not afraid of death; I only fear dying before I avenge my son.”

Uncle Zhu's voice was resolute, and Luo Bingtin felt a pang of emotion.

“Uncle, we share a common enemy; you don’t need to hide anything from me.”

Uncle Zhu’s eyes were bloodshot, the image of his son’s tragic death flashing in his mind. He clenched his fists tightly, his expression filled with sorrow.

“Little Luo, you don’t understand. If I don’t do anything, I can’t find peace.”

“Alright then, Uncle. You’ve killed that woman; I have no objections. But in the future, if you have any plans or actions, please inform me. I’m concerned our plans might conflict.”

Uncle Zhu nodded. He was unaware of Luo Bingtin’s strategies, but now that he was an ability user, he had more options. To avoid future clashes, it was prudent to communicate.

“What do you think about this giant pit?” Luo Bingtin suddenly asked.

Uncle Zhu took a deep breath. “I’m not sure, but I have a bad feeling about it.”

Nodding, she politely urged him to leave. Just before he exited, she added,

“Uncle, I need you to help me with something.”

Uncle Zhu paused mid-stride, turning back to look at her.

“I suspect there are deep-seated moles within the fortress that need to be uncovered. Can you help me find them?”

Luo Bingtin had only just thought of this arrangement. Uncle Zhu could infiltrate the dungeons and eliminate enemies even with guards and patrols present. His meticulous mind, swift movement, and deep-seated hatred made him a suitable candidate who wouldn’t overlook any enemy’s minion. It was the perfect solution.

To her surprise, Uncle Zhu didn’t hesitate at all and immediately agreed.

“I’ve been thinking the same. The personnel in the fortress are mixed; even though some have been cleared out, who really knows? Not every person from Longxiang Base is clean. I’ll keep a close eye on them.”

Luo Bingtin nodded in satisfaction. She thanked him for his efforts, and Uncle Zhu added,

“Is Xie Jinghang trustworthy? Should we check him first...?”

Without a moment's thought, Luo Bingtin replied, “He’s trustworthy; no need to check.”
