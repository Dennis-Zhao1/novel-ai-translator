**The Overlooked Changes**

At this moment, Luo Biting was acutely aware that she might have overdone it. It felt as though someone had seized her by the nape of her neck, pulling her fate along with them. But with the alcohol still clouding her mind, she couldn't quite see who the audacious individual was that dared to disrespect her.

She struggled fiercely, trying to resist this reckless person. In her hazy state, she seemed to hear a muffled grunt followed by a sigh.

The next morning, Luo Biting awoke with her head pounding, rubbing her temples as she sat up in bed. Realizing she was in her dorm room, she lay back down, feeling as though she had just woken from a dream that she couldn't quite recall. She silently vowed never to mix drinks again; it truly was dangerous.

The knock on her door signaled Aunt Li bringing the hangover tea, snapping her back to reality. Luo Biting caught sight of her own messy hair and the way a stubborn strand stood up, and couldn't help but laugh. No matter how old she got, she would always be a girl at heart. Aunt Li urged her to wash up and drink the tea, then left with a smile while clearing the dishes.

Before long, there was another knock at the door. When Luo Biting opened it, she was surprised to see Xie Jinghang. He stepped inside, and she thought he might be here for a meal, wondering how he could already be hungry when it wasn't even noon yet.

Settling onto the couch, his long legs taking up a considerable amount of space, Luo Biting diverted her gaze and asked, “What do you want to eat today?”

Xie Jinghang raised an eyebrow, a smile flickering across his face, then turned serious. “Food can wait; we need to talk. It’s kind of important, so brace yourself.”

Luo Biting was taken aback; it was rare to see him like this, and her curiosity was piqued. She gestured for him to continue. 

“After you encountered the psychic zombie, when you woke up, you were bleeding from seven orifices. How are you feeling now?”

Thinking back on her reactions and how she felt now, Luo Biting shrugged casually. “I’m fine. I slept in the space and woke up feeling great.”

“That’s a bit strange,” Xie Jinghang said, frowning as if deep in thought.

“What’s strange about that? I’m healthy; isn’t that a good thing?” Luo Biting replied, feeling a bit annoyed by his concern.

“Last life, there was a Level Four ability user who was attacked by a psychic zombie. He bled from all seven orifices and, while he seemed to recover after treatment, he suddenly died a week later. During that time, he suffered from headaches, tinnitus, and even hallucinations. A few times, he unexpectedly attacked his teammates. When they autopsied him post-mortem, they found that the crystal core in his head had cracked and fell apart as soon as it was removed.”

Xie Jinghang's voice took on a somber tone, a cloud of sadness surrounding him.

Luo Biting considered his words carefully. She realized that aside from the seven orifices bleeding, she exhibited none of those symptoms. “I don’t have any of those issues. I was hiding in the space, so there’s no need to worry too much.”

Seeing her seemingly unconcerned expression, Xie Jinghang decided it was best to quickly eliminate that psychic zombie, just to be safe. He didn’t linger, rising to take his leave, and Luo Biting, noticing his hurried demeanor, didn’t think too much of it.

After a day spent handling various matters and inspecting the fort, she returned to the space and immediately sensed something was off.

As soon as she entered the space, a sharp pain pierced her head. The once warm and soothing spiritual energy now felt prickly and uncomfortable, causing her to feel unwell all over. 

Not wanting to force herself to stay in the space any longer, she quickly exited, instantly feeling a wave of relief wash over her. In her haste, she didn’t notice the screen of the mysterious mirror glowing brightly.

Initially believing it was a side effect of the psychic zombie's attack, she avoided entering the space for the next few days, simply retrieving what she needed from outside.

During that time, she had her brother Zhu check for abnormalities using his abilities and even had a CT scan done in the infirmary. Those medical devices had been collected from a hospital during a previous scavenging mission.

Reflecting on Xie Jinghang's warning, she concluded that it was indeed wise to check for any issues.

When the report came back normal, she felt somewhat reassured. She decided to return to the space later to ask the mysterious mirror what was going on.

Still grappling with her headache, she was soon informed by one of Xie Jinghang's informants about some news regarding Fu Buqi.

That afternoon, in Luo Biting's office, Xie Jinghang toyed with his teacup before sharing the information his informant had relayed. “Fu Buqi is currently at the Longxiang base, trying to secure the position of second-in-command.”

Luo Biting was puzzled as to why his expression soured after delivering that line. “The Longxiang base is where I was in my previous life. The leader there is incredibly powerful and surrounded by loyal subordinates. If the Kunshan base hadn’t fallen into chaos, it might have been able to compete. But with the current turmoil, it will be tough.”

Luo Biting frowned in confusion. “So, without you there this time, will the Longxiang base still be strong?”

Xie Jinghang nodded. “In my previous life, I was only a front-facing figure. The real powerhouse of the Longxiang base was Pei Qian. Even at my peak, I wouldn’t have been able to defeat him.”

Upon hearing this, Luo Biting’s eyes widened. In her last life, Xie Jinghang had just reached Level Four and was already an idol among ability users; if he was at his peak, he would undoubtedly be even stronger.

“What kind of abilities does Pei Qian have?”

“Psychic abilities. His powers have a particularly wide range of damage, making it hard to distinguish between friend and foe. He was invincible at the same level.”

Xie Jinghang’s voice became a bit hoarse as he took a sip of his tea before continuing, “Once, he encountered a psychic zombie and killed it instantly; it was just a matter of seconds.”

Luo Biting had experienced the might of psychic abilities firsthand, so she couldn’t help but be astonished by his description. It seemed that Pei Qian could take lives with just a thought, which was undeniably powerful.

With this revelation, she quickly pressed for more information. “You mentioned Fu Buqi is trying to become the second-in-command at the Longxiang base. What’s his leverage? Most of his supplies and weapons are in my possession now, and his eldest son is dead. Could he still have stockpiled a significant amount of resources and weapons outside while we’ve been busy?”

Xie Jinghang noticed the growing chill in her tone and reassured her, “Not necessarily. I suspect it’s likely due to the abilities of his system.”

Luo Biting lowered her gaze, recalling that she hadn’t overlooked Fu Buqi’s strange behavior in her previous life. But at that time, she was ensnared by the falsehoods surrounding her, much like a cocoon that trapped her. Fu Buqi was adept at playing the role and using flowery language to charm her, making it easy for her to let her guard down. Besides, she had needed to rely on him back then, so she unconsciously ignored the warning signs.

She recounted some of Fu Buqi's past actions and tactics to Xie Jinghang, analyzing, “Fu Buqi had a wife in his previous life. I even saw him with her a few times when I entered the Kunshan base. She was a frail and beautiful woman. After that, I never saw her again. He had a wife but openly kept a mistress—it’s disgusting. I remember he only got into the Kunshan base because of his father-in-law.”

Xie Jinghang nodded. In the pre-apocalyptic world, Fu Buqi had close ties with some of the upper echelons of the Kunshan base. He had often heard people in the military mock Fu Buqi for being a sycophant, saying he would ingratiate himself with his father-in-law and wife, and later with military leaders, claiming that a man who lived off his in-laws had no backbone.

At the time, he hadn’t paid much attention to it; there were plenty of people in the military seeking favors, and he thought little of it. It wasn’t until the apocalypse that Fu Buqi gradually seized power and began targeting him both openly and covertly that he started to suspect whether Fu Buqi had a hand in his demise in the last life.

This zombie siege seemed to be related to Fu Buqi as well. Whether it was aimed at Xie Jinghang or Luo Biting, it was clear that he was retaliating, and they couldn’t allow him to continue to grow stronger. Otherwise, they wouldn’t know what they would be facing next time.
