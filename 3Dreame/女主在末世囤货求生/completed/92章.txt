**Green Tea Misunderstanding**

A woman dressed in a long designer trench coat, who wore a V-neck slip dress underneath, approached the base's entrance with her sleek black hair cascading down her back. Her face was adorned with exquisite makeup, and her gaze was locked onto the face of a certain woman standing before her car—Luo Bingtong.

The guard, upon seeing her, immediately adjusted his demeanor, replacing his casual attitude with a respectful greeting. "Miss Fan."

Luo Bingtong had already smoothed out her emotional turmoil by the time the woman reached her, concealing the simmering intent to kill beneath a facade of calm. She was curious to see what this green tea girl was up to.

It seemed that life at the Kunshan base was treating her well. Luo Bingtong couldn't help but wonder if she was still playing the role of a mistress for Fu Qiqi.

Fan Zhenzhen chuckled lightly, taking in Luo Bingtong's seemingly confused expression. "What a coincidence to see you again!"

Luo Bingtong was taken aback. She didn’t think this green tea type would see through her disguise. What did this woman want?

"You know me?" Luo Bingtong mimicked Liu Xiaohui's tone, frowning slightly and asking timidly.

"Of course! We had a brief encounter last year, but didn’t get a chance to really chat. Now that we meet again, I recognized you right away! Hehe."

Fan Zhenzhen was truly the embodiment of a green tea girl. If it were anyone else, they would probably feel flattered, especially with the guards treating her with such deference while being so polite to Luo Bingtong.

Indeed, the guard's expression softened considerably when he looked at her, practically overflowing with flattery toward Fan Zhenzhen.

Luo Bingtong pretended to rack her brain for the memory, then her eyes lit up as she said, "Wasn't it at the Gaoxin Park when we were rescued?"

"Yes! I remember you worked at the management office in Gaoxin Park, right?"

"That's right! I'm Liu Xiaohui from the administrative department. I was so scared back then that I just wanted to get home and didn't get a chance to talk to you."

"No worries! Since you’re here at the Kunshan base, it shows we have some fate together."

After saying this, Fan Zhenzhen turned to the guard and said, "This is my friend; let her through."

Then she turned back to Luo Bingtong, adding, "Xiaohui, I have something to take care of. You go ahead and get your residency card. I'll come find you in the service hall when I'm done."

With a playful wink, she sauntered away.

Luo Bingtong nearly rolled her eyes to the back of her head. She had already bribed the guard to gain entry, and now she was being told to wait around for her? Ugh! 

Originally, she had planned to take care of Fan Zhenzhen, but it wasn’t convenient to act at the entrance. She had bigger fish to fry with Fu Qiqi.

However, this situation had its advantages. Fan Zhenzhen was so eager to befriend Liu Xiaohui for a reason, and Luo Bingtong was determined to uncover her intentions.

Deciding on her course of action, she followed the instructions to park her car directly in front of the service hall after entering the base.

In her stylish outfit, Luo Bingtong blended in with the crowd of many like-minded individuals. Some were powered individuals bringing their families for residency procedures, while she stood among the ordinary survivors in a long line, waiting for her turn to be processed—an experience that was markedly slower than the empowered individuals' fast track.

She wasn't in a hurry, though. She knew that ordinary survivors without the endorsement of a powered individual had to pay a hefty fee to enter Kunshan Base: either 50 pounds of rice, 60 pounds of mixed grains, or a set amount of other commodities like cigarettes, alcohol, tea, and medicines.

Fortunately, she had prepared in advance. Not wanting to attract too much attention, she opted to pay with 50 pounds of rice. The rice she had stored was of excellent quality, taken from the supplies she had earlier acquired from the Maple Leaf Villa base, and she had deliberately packed it in a dirty old sack to disguise it—heavy and cumbersome.

After waiting nearly an hour, she finally reached the front of the line. During her wait, she witnessed two confrontations between powered individuals escalating to the point of violence, only to be stopped by security, and three ordinary people being ejected from the base for attempting to cut in line.

The chaos was relentless. With the inefficiency of Kunshan Base's administrative processes, ordinary people might leave feeling even less secure than before.

After successfully submitting her food supplies, she received her residency proof. Next, she needed to take her paperwork to another window to queue for accommodations.

Luo Bingtong arrived at 9:30 AM, and it was now nearly noon. She had only managed to complete the residency paperwork and felt a pang of hunger. However, looking at the long line for accommodation, she decided to wait—who knew if she would even finish by the afternoon?

Just as she settled into the end of the line, a commotion erupted ahead. Curious from having overheard the gossip, she leaned forward to see.

It turned out it was lunchtime, and the staff had decided to take a break, hanging a "service paused" sign and rolling down the partition to leave.

Those who had waited a long time were instantly stunned, frantically demanding an explanation.

To their dismay, the staff simply replied that they would resume at two o'clock, and that the morning queue wouldn’t count—first come, first served.

This revelation sent the people at the front into a rage. After arriving early and waiting so long, they now faced another two-hour wait. If they stepped out for lunch, they would lose their spot, and it felt just like the chaotic days before the apocalypse!

What made it worse was that before the apocalypse, there had at least been a numbering system to manage appointments, or online processing. Now, it was all about manual queues, devoid of any number system—utterly ridiculous.

As the most agitated individuals attempted to vault over the counter to grab the staff, the guards arrived. Their attitude was markedly different from how they treated empowered individuals; they wielded tasers without hesitation.

At this moment, the timid ordinary people shrank back, pushing and shoving. Luo Bingtong stood by the door, thinking how clearly this issue lay with Kunshan Base’s poor administrative system. It was astonishing that an old military region could be so clueless about management processes.

Once the most vocal protesters were subdued and taken away by security, the situation began to calm down. Luo Bingtong noticed the staff at the service window turn and walk away, realizing that staying here was pointless.

Just as she was about to turn and leave, she felt a tap on her shoulder. Startled, she turned to see Fan Zhenzhen standing there.

With one hand casually tucked into her trench coat pocket and the other waving at her, Fan Zhenzhen was flanked by two tall men standing about five steps away.

Luo Bingtong forced a smile and greeted her. “Have you finished with your accommodations?”

Fan Zhenzhen replied, "Not yet! I just paid my fees; I haven’t checked in yet because it’s closing time. They won’t be open again until two."

Fan Zhenzhen seemed to understand the inefficiency of the service here. She chuckled lightly and said, "No worries! Let’s grab a bite to eat first, then come back. I’ll give you a heads-up so you don’t have to wait in line."

Luo Bingtong put on a grateful and admiring expression, which immensely satisfied Fan Zhenzhen, the little green tea girl.

Following her out of the service hall, they walked toward the cafeteria on the left.

Though both Kunshan Base and the Apocalypse Fort were military installations, Kunshan primarily served as an armed department. It had more buildings, including training grounds and two main areas: the office zone and the accommodation zone. The office area had been partially repurposed to house ordinary survivors, while only those brought in by powered individuals could access the dormitory area.

As they walked, Fan Zhenzhen clung to Luo Bingtong’s arm, pointing out various buildings and explaining them. Given that Luo Bingtong had spent five years in Kunshan, she didn’t need the introduction. She feigned ignorance to avoid revealing her past.

Fan Zhenzhen didn’t mention the villa district, located behind the office area, where Fu and his family, along with several prominent families and military leaders, resided.

Yet, Fan Zhenzhen rambled on, avoiding any direct topics until they reached the second floor of the cafeteria. It was quieter than the bustling first floor, resembling a small diner from the pre-apocalypse era, and not too many powered individuals were present.

Fan Zhenzhen subtly flaunted her privileges at Kunshan Base, satisfied as she watched Luo Bingtong’s feigned expressions of admiration and envy.
