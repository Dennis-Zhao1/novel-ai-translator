**Zombie Upgrade**

After Xie Jinghang finished harvesting the wheat and stacked it neatly, Luo Bingtin nodded in satisfaction. Once the two of them had a hearty meal and rested for a while, they finally noticed that the sundial's pointer was approaching the right time.

Luo Bingtin turned to shout at Xie Jinghang to get ready. In the next moment, she grabbed his arm and they instantly appeared at the entrance of the Kunshan Base. 

In another heartbeat, Luo Bingtin summoned an armored vehicle from her spatial pocket. The duo quickly climbed inside, the sudden appearance leaving the guards at the Kunshan Base dumbfounded. 

It wasn't until they were seated in the armored vehicle that the guards snapped back to reality and prepared to attack. After all, weren't these the same people who had ambushed the base last night? By then, Xie Jinghang had already hit the gas and sped away.

Meanwhile, Luo Bingtin rushed to the artillery position, swiftly loading the cannonballs. As the sounds of bullets pinged off the armored vehicle, she calculated the distance and fired a shot, obliterating half of the Kunshan Base's city tower.

The thrill of firing the cannon was exhilarating.

She quickly loaded another round, but Xie Jinghang called for her to stop. “Don’t fire anymore! I have an agreement with the upper management at Kunshan Base regarding Fu Buzhi. We should leave some walls standing to fend off the zombies.”

The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Luo Bingtin nodded, and they had already escaped the enemy's range, so she unloaded the cannon and stowed it away.

Once back in their seats, Luo Bingtin suggested they head to Fenglin Base to see if Fu Buzhi was hiding there. Xie Jinghang immediately turned the vehicle towards Fenglin Base. Since their exit from the spatial pocket, the noisy spirit had also followed, incessantly chattering in his head.

“Host, what’s going on? You suddenly came out! If you’re out, I have to be out too! I haven’t even said goodbye to Brother Xuanjing yet!”

“Just as I got out, I started missing Brother Xuanjing. You have no idea how comfortable the luxurious suite he prepared for me is. I’m not under the main system's surveillance anymore, and I can play freely. It’s all your fault for being useless. You should learn from me! Brother Xuanjing even promised to take me out to play!”

“You say you’re not bad looking, tall, and fit. Your stamina seems decent too. How come no little fairy has taken a liking to you? It must be because you’re not proactive enough. Ugh, it’s my fault for hastily binding to you. If I had bound to a little fairy, I could have played with Brother Xuanjing every day.”

Xie Jinghang had initially planned to ignore him, but the system had taken it too far with personal attacks. Was it CPU-ing him?

He shot back in his mind, “It’s not too late for you to bind now. Have you forgotten how you conned me? A weapon for ten thousand points? It’s rich coming from you! Let’s go, let’s go! I’m more than happy to!”

The noisy spirit was momentarily stunned. “That’s because I need to level up! If I don’t, how can I unlock the later transcendent weapons for you? Right now, I’m still at level three. Please do your part and work hard. If you don’t level up, I can’t help you, you know? Didn’t you want to reach the pinnacle of life?”

“Stop with the empty promises. Ever since I bound with you, what have I benefited? Instead, I’ve been put in danger several times. This is enough!”

“Hey, Host, don’t say that! It hurts our feelings. The shield I provided at a critical moment was quite timely, right? I’m still very useful!”

“Are you kidding me? Do you even know how many points that shield cost? And now look, my points are reset to zero. If you want to level up, good luck in your next life!”

The noisy spirit was so taken aback that it fell silent, feeling a bit down. After all, it was a level zero new system, tossed out to work before even reaching its first month. Other systems typically unlocked secondary tasks after achieving a level, but it was just a miserable little cabbage.

Who could understand its struggles? *Sniff, sniff. Brother Xuanjing, I miss you so much.*

There was quite a distance between Kunshan Base and Fenglin Base. As Luo Bingtin observed the zombies attacking the armored vehicle along the road, she occasionally raised her hand to clear a few, practicing her accuracy on moving targets.

Xie Jinghang sensed the world had quieted down and took the opportunity to keep an eye on Luo Bingtin’s movements. He thought to himself that there were indeed many zombies along the way, and once they cleared Fenglin Base, they could come back here to collect crystal cores.

After all, the system’s weapons were quite enticing, and accumulating points for upgrades was necessary. Relying on others was out of the question; a man shouldn't live off others.

They drove non-stop, having deliberately chosen to set out at three in the morning, the time when guards were most likely to doze off. After over four hours of driving, they finally spotted the entrance to Fenglin Base.

Luo Bingtin reloaded her cannonball and looked through her binoculars. What was going on? There wasn't a single guard post at Fenglin Base; only a few wandering zombies were hanging around. Xie Jinghang, sensing a trap, parked the vehicle at a distance in the woods.

Taking the binoculars, he examined the situation closely. Indeed, the gates were tightly shut, and not a soul was in sight. Luo Bingtin thought for a moment, biting her lip. “Let’s charge in and take a look. If it doesn’t work, we’ll fire the cannon. If that fails, we’ll use the spatial pocket.”

Xie Jinghang had no objections. He told her to get ready and accelerated towards the gate.

As they approached, it became clear that Fenglin Base was completely abandoned. Peering inside, they saw only a handful of zombies wandering about. Upon spotting their vehicle, the zombies rushed over with loud howls. The two of them quickly cleared them out and crashed through the gates, entering a desolate scene.

After surveying the interior, they confirmed that this place had been abandoned by Fu Buzhi.

It was easy to understand; he must have other hideouts. The phrase “a cunning rabbit has three burrows” didn’t even begin to describe him.

With no leads on Fu Buzhi’s whereabouts for the time being, the two decided to return home, switching to a modified armored vehicle to meet at the designated rendezvous point with their team.

The recent setback at Kunshan Base had stirred up quite a commotion. Naturally, Xie Jinghang bore the brunt of the blame, as he was the one visible and recognized during the operation. Following this, their actions became less covert.

Meanwhile, the severely damaged Kunshan Base began internal reorganizations, rife with power struggles and chaos.

In reality, Xie Jinghang had not touched the root of Kunshan Base’s problems, yet he was smeared with all sorts of accusations, painted as the enemy.

Tsk, these power players sure have dirty hearts.

Luo Bingtin chose to stay outside, killing zombies and collecting crystal cores, not just for show but also to fulfill the task at hand. She had vaguely noticed that the zombies had become stronger; the collected crystal cores had also reached level three. If it weren’t for their team’s diligent practice and Xie Jinghang’s support as a level four mutant, they might have faced total annihilation or severe injuries.

The collected crystal cores needed to be turned in at the base for points and distribution. Luo Bingtin retained her share of the task while distributing the rest.

Among the level three crystal cores, there were now mutated attributes. Luo Bingtin absorbed a few level three ice attribute cores, instantly feeling her abilities surge. However, it was still far from enough to break through to the next level. It seemed she needed more crystal cores.

Their team was considered the core strength of the fortress, yet even they found battling zombies to be so challenging. How much more difficult would it be for those mutants barely over level two?

In the fortress, Meng Ge heard the news from the mutant teams returning from their missions and grew increasingly worried about Luo Bingtin and the rest. Moreover, the broadcast continued to repeat the bounty for Xie Jinghang. While it was uncertain who would take up the bounty in this apocalypse, who knows?

As long as the benefits were sufficient, someone would charge in. Fortunately, after three days, they all returned safely. Luo Bingtin looked at the casualty list and couldn’t help but sigh.

On the other side, she sent Liu Xiaohui to comfort the families of the deceased mutants. Such occurrences happened daily; without leveling up their powers, going out could hardly be classified as an accident—it was tantamount to sending them to their deaths.

The lingering question in Luo Bingtin's mind resurfaced once again: what exactly triggered the zombies' evolution?

She felt she was finally getting closer to an answer.
