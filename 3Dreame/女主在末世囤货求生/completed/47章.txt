**Dawn Building**

Liu Xiaohui's tears, which she had managed to stop, began to flow again as the stories of the past few days stirred deep feelings of sadness within her. She sobbed quietly, unable to contain her emotions.

Luo Bingtong couldn't bear to see the girl cry any longer. After several attempts to comfort her, he finally asked, "Miss Liu, do you know anything about the building in the center?" Standing near the window of the break room, he could see the main road and the building across from them. Although branches obstructed part of his view, he could still make out some details.

Liu Xiaohui nodded. "That's the Dawn Building. It's the largest one, mostly filled with employees from biotech and tech companies. They work late, so they’re usually still in the building at this time."

Luo Bingtong acknowledged her response and then inquired if the management office had a floor plan of the Dawn Building. It was standard practice for the management to keep copies of the building's renovation blueprints for approval, to prevent unauthorized construction or demolition.

Even if they didn't have the renovation plans, the fire safety regulations required the management office to review the fire safety documents, which would also include a floor plan. As long as they had one of those, they could proceed.

Liu Xiaohui nodded and led them out of the break room to the archives. The entire office building felt eerily quiet with only the few of them present. After the emotional toll of the past few days, Liu Xiaohui had never felt more at ease than at that moment.

The archives were filled with documents. After a brief search, they found the registered documents for the Dawn Building. It seemed that the building was designed to be a landmark of the new tech park. The archive contained not only architectural drawings and floor plans but also fire safety permits and a thick stack of promotional materials.

Luo Bingtong gathered everyone around to review the floor plans, ensuring that each person had a mental map of the building's layout.

Seeing their preparations, Liu Xiaohui guessed they were planning to head to the Dawn Building. She quickly warned them, "Are you all going to the Dawn Building? There are a lot of zombies inside. Two people ran into the lobby the other day and didn’t come back out. They were chased by a huge horde of zombies, and more came in from outside. I saw it with my own eyes—there are so many zombies!"

Her fearful expression made Luo Bingtong realize the seriousness of the situation.

With their skills and stamina, could they really fight through that many zombies to rescue Uncle Zhu? He glanced at the others and immediately regretted not coming alone. With so many firearms and heavy weaponry in his space, he could have wielded a machine gun and taken down zombies without hesitation. 

Now, with everyone in tow, they couldn’t afford to expose themselves—his hands were tied. This mission was crucial; they had people to save.

Luo Bingtong had lost enough already and couldn't bear to lose more. His only friend absolutely had to be safe.

The others nodded in agreement; they were all resolute about going to rescue people. If they were the ones trapped in the building, they would want their families to come for them too.

They assured Liu Xiaohui that she should stay here safely. They would come back for her once they were finished, and they would secure the main door downstairs to prevent any zombies from entering. This place was currently the safest, with food and drink available in the break room, at least much safer than following them.

Liu Xiaohui understood and nodded. It was too dangerous outside, and she was too timid. As long as she could leave with them later, that was enough. She still needed to search for her missing parents and relatives.

Before leaving, Luo Bingtong found a mop and disassembled the handle, sharpening one end with his sword to give Liu Xiaohui a means of self-defense. He instructed her, "If you encounter zombies, just stab them in the head. Hitting anywhere else won’t work." Liu Xiaohui had seen the zombies sprawled at the fire escape door, all with their heads destroyed. She gripped the mop handle tightly and nodded firmly.

Luo Bingtong took the floor plans and the park layout, and the group headed toward the Dawn Building.

They maintained formation, eyes scanning for any signs of danger, armed with their swords and clad in similar protective gear. From a distance, they looked like an elite squad forming.

Meng Ge led the way. Instead of striding boldly down the center of the road, he kept close to the building’s outer wall, moving quickly and quietly. This minimized their profile and enhanced their mobility.

Their stealthy advance went uninterrupted, and they soon found themselves nearing the lobby of the Dawn Building. Meng Ge took a deep breath to steady himself and led the way inside, with the others following closely behind. As they approached the building, Luo Bingtong opened up her mental energy to sense the surroundings.

The lobby of the building was clear of zombies. On either side were the elevator shafts, and at the end of the shafts was the fire escape. For now, she sensed no zombies inside.

Luo Bingtong quietly asked Meng Ge, "Should we clear the building floor by floor, or head straight to the seventeenth floor?" Meng Ge thought for a moment. While clearing the building would be the safest option to eliminate potential threats, they might not have the stamina if too many zombies were encountered.

Luo Bingtong agreed, suggesting they proceed like they did in the hospital—sneaking upstairs, closing the fire escape doors behind them to avoid drawing attention from any zombies. They could conserve energy and head straight to the seventeenth floor to find their target.

Meng Ge nodded in agreement and conveyed the strategy to the group. They made their way toward the fire escape at the end of the elevator shaft. The power was out, leaving the entire building shrouded in darkness. With her heightened senses and mental energy, Luo Bingtong felt uneasy, especially since the remaining boys were encountering this kind of situation for the first time, inevitably hesitating.

Meng Ge pulled out a flashlight from his gear bag to illuminate the path ahead, and Luo Bingtong took out another to shine forward.

She couldn't maintain her mental energy for long due to its draining nature, and there was no opportunity to enter her space for recovery. They had to prepare for a prolonged battle.

With light ahead, her fear diminished significantly. They maintained a steady pace, quietly entering the stairwell. Luo Bingtong nimbly closed the door to the basement, her fluid movements astonishing the boys behind her.

Not caring about their surprised looks, she waved dismissively; it was just practice.

Anmin quickly grasped the door-closing technique and synchronized with Luo Bingtong, helping her shut the doors all the way to the fifth floor. They paused briefly to rest, drinking water and reorganizing their gear. Shoes were adjusted, and any loose laces were tightened.

The swords were heavy, and by this point, everyone felt a bit tired. Luo Bingtong devised a method to secure her sword by wedging the scabbard between her backpack and back, asking Anmin to help fasten it with a chain. This way, she could easily slip the sword back in when needed, reminiscent of ancient warriors.

The group found the method useful, and soon everyone was following suit. Anmin had actually thought of a simpler solution—tying a longer rope to each end of the scabbard—but it felt too late to suggest it now, so he kept quiet to save face.

After a brief rest, they continued upward. As they were about to move again, Luo Bingtong suddenly raised her hand, signaling them to stop, pointing upward. There was movement.

Meng Ge nodded, lowering his foot back to the ground. The entire team pressed against the wall of the staircase in unison, holding their breath, fingers gripping their sword hilts.

They listened intently and heard faint rustling sounds. Just as Luo Bingtong was about to use her mental energy, Meng Ge leaned forward to peek around the corner. A zombie was wandering in the stairwell, its back turned to them. Meng Ge gestured for Luo Bingtong to stay back as he moved in closer. With a swift motion, he drew his sword and lunged forward, piercing the zombie's skull.

Luo Bingtong followed closely behind, shutting the fire escape door to the sixth floor.

Just as she thought they could relax, she turned and felt her heart race as their pupils dilated in shock.
