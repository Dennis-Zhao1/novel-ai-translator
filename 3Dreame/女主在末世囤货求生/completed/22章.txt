Abandoned Military Base

Ever since that lightning struck her heart and sent tremors through her soul, Lora Bingting had been contemplating what kind of fortress would be best to build.

During the time of stagnation, she entrusted the procurement of supplies to the Zhu family, while the military equipment was coordinated with Chris. It wasn’t that she couldn’t contact the military factories directly; it was just that one needed to understand the rules of the trade to operate within it—smart people did things according to the rules.

After all, who would refuse a bit of commission? Offending Chris would be a serious mistake.

Once the Zhu family placed their orders, the other party confirmed that the pickup date would remain unchanged, and they would arrange for other resources to supply. Lora had no objections to this and revealed that she had a wealth of jewelry and gold she wanted to liquidate, hoping to sell it all when picking up the goods.

Chris, of course, welcomed this with open arms; continuous business meant endless streams of income. He gauged the approximate market prices and quantities, and given that the Luo family was a reputable jewelry dynasty, these assets were nothing to scoff at.

However, with such a sudden liquidation of assets, even though he didn’t pry into client privacy, he couldn’t help but speculate. Surely, it wasn’t because of a political upheaval in Huaguo, prompting the Luo family to seek asylum abroad? That didn’t seem likely; the Luo family had already tidied up their overseas assets. They wouldn’t suddenly be planning a big move within Huaguo, would they?

Coincidentally, Chris's initial thoughts aligned with that of the old Zhu patriarch. In fact, no one could have guessed that the real reason was the impending apocalypse.

After resolving the procurement of military supplies, Lora began researching various apocalyptic fortress designs at home. Most of what she found were underground shelters built by foreign tycoons, which could only be described as extravagant “snail houses.”

She had no intention of cramming herself into one of those places to survive the apocalypse.

Lora secretly regretted being so naïve in her past life, like a fool led by the nose, without collecting any useful information.

While she was diving into her studies, the old Zhu patriarch had also gathered his relatives who had resources in the construction industry to brainstorm.

They were unaware of the reasons behind the sudden large-scale activities in the family. Externally, everything seemed calm, but internally, everyone couldn’t help but wonder about the unusual movements.

Such a major operation couldn’t possibly stem from the old man going senile; that didn’t align with his usual behavior, which always revolved around the family's interests.

Considering it was unreasonable to raise a skyscraper overnight, which would be too conspicuous, both Lora and the old Zhu patriarch preferred to create an underground fortress, with strictly guarded entrances to ensure maximum safety.

Aside from her desire to avoid cramming into a small space, Lora had no objections. Just when everyone was at a loss, a college student from the Zhu family searched GPS satellite maps and discovered an obscure abandoned military base in the mountainous outskirts of Beijing. Strangely enough, the reason for its abandonment was due to exposure from foreign spies.

Upon seeing this, Lora’s eyes lit up. She had heard of this place in her previous life; it was the base the team of supernatural beings, which even Fu Boqi wanted to recruit, had occupied. 

After receiving Lora's approval, the old Zhu patriarch arranged for his son, who had military connections, to investigate. Such a place was sensitive, yet it had been abandoned for years. Now, it could potentially be exchanged for benefits, so the difficulty level should be manageable.

As the old Zhu patriarch predicted, the military never expected that the military base they had invested heavily in would go to waste once it was exposed. It was akin to a long-derelict building suddenly finding a buyer willing to take it off their hands; this was a stroke of luck. Smart people knew how to make the right choices; hesitating even for a second would be a sign of disrespect towards the Zhu family's sincerity (in monetary terms).

Having successfully acquired the transfer agreement, the members of the Zhu family wore calm expressions, as if they could no longer muster the emotions to reflect their current feelings.

When Lora heard that they had effortlessly secured the transfer agreement, along with the usage rights to several nearby hills, she was delighted. The area was interconnected and surrounded, with a concealed terrain that, in ancient times, was considered easy to defend and hard to attack—a prime location in military strategy. Additionally, being far from crowds meant there would be fewer zombies.

Next came the planning and construction of the interior of the fortress, which needed to ensure a reliable water and electricity supply, as well as comfortable living conditions for the residents and arrangements for any potential survivors.

After deducting the payment owed for military supplies, Lora found herself with very little remaining funds. Money was truly hard to come by. Under the old Zhu patriarch's cover, she managed to liquidate all the joint ventures and recoup some of her losses.

With the funds recovered, Lora used all of it to hoard pork, beef, lamb, chicken, duck, goose, fish, seafood, and other perishables, knowing that her storage space could keep things fresh without worrying about spoilage.

Since discovering the changes in her storage space, Lora realized it had mountains, water, flowers, and trees. Logically, it seemed reasonable to raise some small animals there, right?

She bought two rabbits for an experiment, but without a proper enclosure, they darted off as soon as they were released.

Unable to chase the rabbits across the mountains, Lora decided to buy two chickens instead, placing them in a chicken coop she had purchased to observe them. To her surprise, it seemed like she could indeed raise them.

With the livestock from her farm now housed in the space, Lora mimicked the farm’s layout, creating an area close to the water source and at the foot of the mountain, using fencing ordered online to enclose a sizable section.

The animals from the farm were directly moved inside, and the staff who managed the farm were reassigned to the old residence for other tasks.

In the farm, aside from the animals and supplies, everything of value had been collected by Lora.

Even with the fenced area being quite large, it didn’t occupy much space in her storage.

Feeling assured, Lora planned to hoard many more items, primarily those that would take up space. For instance, she had previously cooperated with the Qin family and negotiated with military political families, exchanging a batch of armored and modified vehicles. The project was due for delivery within the next few days, and Lora was waiting at the old residence.

Sure enough, on May Day, the modified vehicles began arriving at the old residence’s farm warehouse. This batch of armored vehicles was exchanged for assets valued in the billions, amounting to dozens of vehicles all at once.

She specifically communicated that the design of the rooftops needed to incorporate spaces for weapon placements, such as machine guns and rocket launchers.

The other party had no objections and directly proceeded with the modifications, completing them efficiently and effectively.

Lora had thought she wasn’t fond of vehicles, but seeing four warehouses filled to the brim with them, especially knowing how cool and safe they looked, filled her with an excitement that was hard to share with others.

Gloating in secret, Lora stored all the vehicles in her space, parking them not far from the fuel truck, alongside the yacht and helicopter she had exchanged earlier. At a glance, it resembled a transport exhibition, grand and impressive.

As she strolled among the vehicles, Lora noticed that most of them were filled to the brim with fuel, which was quite nice.

In the following two days, she went to the dealership to select several different types of RVs and lightweight electric cars.

The transformation of the abandoned military base was also progressing rapidly.

The basic facilities were prioritized, starting with the need for electricity. Relying solely on fuel generators was unreasonable; she had heard that the military base previously utilized hydropower but had dismantled the hydropower generator when it was abandoned.

Now that the foundational infrastructure was taking shape, the next steps were straightforward. Once again, Lora financed the project while the Zhu family contributed both funds and labor.

Lora firmly believed she shouldn’t take advantage of the Zhu family, so the costs for acquiring the military base and constructing the facilities were shared equally among the Zhu family members.

Her name was also on the transfer agreement, and she and the old Zhu patriarch signed a separate asset proportion agreement.

Each party would purchase their own supplies, while both parties would legally hold the real estate.

This clear division of responsibilities fostered a pleasant relationship, and cooperation remained comfortable for both Lora and the old Zhu patriarch.
