**Betraying Teammates**

Life had taken on a new rhythm with Meng training the new recruits and Luo Bingtian occasionally taking Wang Xinxin under her wing. On some days, Luo Bingtian would also take Luo Fan aside, but Wang Xinxin had grown less jealous over time. Overall, the moments they spent together were relatively short.

However, the gossip-loving eyes within the fortress couldn’t miss a beat. Many pairs of eyes were watching Wang Xinxin’s every expression, and soon rumors began to spread — Wang Xinxin had a crush on Luo Fan, and Luo Bingtian liked him too. But who did Luo Fan actually like?

When this news reached Luo Fan’s ears, he felt utterly bewildered. If every time Luo Bingtian called him away and Wang Xinxin shot him a fierce glare, he was labeled as being “liked,” or if every time he followed Luo Bingtian to the lab, surrounded by lab coats for blood draws or tests, he was deemed “liked,” he would much rather pass on such affection.

Yet, he had no one to share his struggles with; no one understood his sorrow.

Meanwhile, outside, Xie Jinghang was equally frustrated. Fu Buqi was exceptionally good at hiding. Xie had visited every possible location where Fu was rumored to be, only to find them completely empty. Often, he arrived just after Fu had left, discovering that whatever was left behind was still warm.

Someone must be tipping off Fu Buqi; after searching for over a week, he hadn’t even caught a glimpse of him. Zhu Yidan had been so furious she cursed under her breath.

As the time agreed upon with Longxiang Base approached, Xie Jinghang realized he couldn’t continue chasing Fu Buqi’s tail and could only hope for good news from his filial son.

The group arrived at Longxiang Base, where the number of zombies had significantly decreased. While chatting, Pei Qian jokingly teased Xie Jinghang, but the implications were somewhat unsettling. In this post-apocalyptic world, the number of living humans was dwindling, mostly concentrated in various bases. Zombies had cores and were increasingly agile. With over a billion people in Huaguo, the number of survivors was minuscule compared to the overwhelming zombie population.

Lost in thought, Xie Jinghang was interrupted again. This time, Bai Lianhua approached. Ever since the announcement of the list for the expedition to the stronghold, Bai Lianhua had been riding high, her previously meek demeanor now barely concealing an air of arrogance.

She was convinced she would awaken supernatural powers and become a formidable force, imagining a future where men would flock to her, with Pei Qian and Xie Jinghang falling at her feet.

This trip to Longxiang Base allowed for twenty people, and aside from Bai Lianhua, the other nineteen were Pei Qian’s trusted confidants. They boarded a large bus in an orderly manner. After saying goodbye to Pei Qian and taking his share of the spoils — a big bag of crystal cores — Xie Jinghang drove off.

Pei Chang had initially felt jealous, but Pei Qian, fearing she might get upset, quietly reassured her, calming her down. Watching Bai Lianhua sit in the front row of the bus, full of herself, Pei Chang struggled to suppress her laughter.

Pei Qian shook his head at her antics, signaling her not to be too obvious. Soon after, Pei Chang adopted a dramatically upset expression, which only made Bai Lianhua more smug.

Zhu Yidan, on the other hand, wanted nothing to do with these disturbed individuals. As long as Bai Lianhua kept her distance, her passive-aggressive tendencies remained stable.

The journey from Jinshi to the stronghold was lengthy, particularly with the poor road conditions and the occasional aggressive zombies that needed clearing before they could pass. On the bus, aside from the driver, everyone else was ordinary people who rarely ventured outside the base. They watched, both fearful and envious, as supernatural beings battled zombies outside.

Especially Bai Lianhua, who pressed her pretty face against the window, eager to see Xie Jinghang in action against the zombies. Though she pretended to be merely curious, her eyes betrayed an insatiable desire, longing to devour the handsome and heroic man outside.

Just as she was about to get a good look, Zhu Yidan blocked her view, causing her expression to darken immediately. The others on the bus were too engrossed in watching the supernatural beings handle the zombies to notice Bai Lianhua’s mood.

Though only a few zombies appeared, even if they were stronger, they were no match for an ability user like Xie Jinghang. Before long, the driver started the bus again, following the lead vehicle towards the stronghold.

Bai Lianhua still wanted to find a way to sit next to Xie Jinghang and ideally swap Zhu Yidan for herself. But the bus came to a halt again. They had reached a toll station at the border of two cities, where a small group of zombies wandered nearby. Bai Lianhua rested her chin on her hand, lost in thought.

The vehicle moved intermittently, and after several stops, it grew dull. The people on the bus fell silent, resting, while the driver, being an ability user, stayed alert, ready to protect the passengers.

Seeing the driver step out, Bai Lianhua suddenly had a bright idea. She thought it would be delightful to surprise Xie Jinghang. So, she quietly exited the bus and headed straight for his modified vehicle.

The two vehicles were still a good ten meters apart when a zombie suddenly lunged out from the roadside, heading straight for Bai Lianhua. She screamed in terror and ran back as fast as she could.

Her scream drew the attention of both Xie Jinghang’s group and the zombie. Zhu Yidan had been engaged with a metal-type zombie, finding it quite challenging. She couldn’t help but appreciate Bai Lianhua’s audacity; while she was insufferable, she was also quite brave in the face of danger.

Xie Jinghang thought to himself that at this distance, even if he could strike the zombie with a lightning bolt, it might not kill it. Besides, Bai Lianhua would surely get scratched or bitten before he could intervene.

Surprisingly, this foolish woman wasn’t just reckless; she was also lucky. The bus driver was stationed at the back, keeping an eye out for any zombies that might approach from behind. When he saw Bai Lianhua sneak off, he planned to stop her but hadn’t even had the chance to shout before she was already sprinting back.

He intended to intercept her and urge her to return to the bus, but instead, Bai Lianhua yanked him in front of her, placing him between herself and the zombie. The driver, caught off guard, didn’t even have time to unleash his abilities before the zombie clawed at his neck. He managed to kick the creature away, unleashing fire abilities to fend off the zombies approaching him.

The driver was nearly in despair, hoping to retreat to the bus for safety, but when he turned, he found the door slammed shut. Bai Lianhua had rushed back to the bus and was now frantically searching for the button to close the driver’s door, completely disregarding his safety.

As the chaos unfolded, Xie Jinghang and his team reacted swiftly, witnessing the driver get injured. They quickly dispatched the nearby zombies and turned to see the driver’s pale face, the wound already turning a sickly shade of blue, and the bus door sealed tight.

Zhu Yidan was furious, barely able to stifle her laughter.

The deputy team leader and his men quickly began extracting crystal cores. Xie Jinghang pulled out an antidote from his pocket and administered it to the injured driver. He then walked up and knocked on the bus door.

After knocking for a while with no response, Zhu Yidan frowned, peering through the bus window. Inside, she saw Bai Lianhua desperately blocking the door button, while the ordinary passengers, startled, tried to pull her away. Her frenzied demeanor left them stunned, and for a moment, no one dared to approach her.

The driver, having received the antidote, felt a wave of relief wash over him. He could sense a strange energy coursing through him due to the injury, leaving him weak and powerless. If it weren’t for Xie Jinghang carrying the antidote, he’d likely have been turned into a zombie by now.

The driver had previously worked for Pei Qian, and their relationship was good. He got along well with Pei Qian’s trusted aides; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been assigned to this mission. Yet, he never expected that a mere Bai Lianhua would betray him, and even more infuriating, she had the gall to turn against him after receiving help.
