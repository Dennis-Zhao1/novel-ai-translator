**Boosting Points**

Lo Bingting paused for a moment upon hearing those words. What did that mean? Was there some kind of surprise waiting for her?

Xie Jinghang tilted his head slightly at Lo Bingting, revealing a somewhat meaningful smile that gave off a mischievous vibe, reminiscent of boys in school plotting harmless pranks. 

"Stop keeping me in suspense. What is it?"

Xie Jinghang longed to ruffle her hair but restrained himself, merely rubbing his fingers together instead. 

Seeing that he wasn’t answering, Lo Bingting expanded her mental perception and discovered that the dark corridor appeared empty at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, she found it filled with numerous subtle dark spots of light. These weren’t the bright red speckles like rambutan but rather a color unique to the ugly flowers they were facing. Just looking at them sent shivers down her spine, and she finally understood what he meant by “fear of dense clusters.”

"What do you plan to do?" 

Lo Bingting knew that if Xie Jinghang had made a decision, he must have been prepared.

"I think roasting the ugly flowers sounds good."

Xie Jinghang retrieved the Blaze Dragon from the system shop, a flamethrower highly recommended by the noisy spirit. Its power was reported to exceed the kind Lo Bingting had stored by more than three times, and the fuel could be converted from crystal cores. In other words, as long as there were zombies and those mutated plants around, the Blaze Dragon could be used indefinitely.

He then handed the Blaze Dragon to Lo Bingting and pulled out two fireproof suits.

When Lo Bingting saw the array of equipment—fireproof suits, boots, gloves, and a helmet that could filter air and was self-circulating—she felt impressed. The fireproof suits even had side pockets for small oxygen tanks, which was incredibly thoughtful.

As for the Blaze Dragon, it was lightweight, aesthetically pleasing, and offered a great grip. It seemed that the equipment in the system shop primarily favored metallic colors, with very few painted designs. The Blaze Dragon's paint job, however, was stunning, combining red, black, silver, and gray in a striking manner, with a unique shape and smooth lines—it was a true masterpiece among artful creations.

Xie Jinghang examined the weapon closely and agreed with the noisy spirit's enthusiastic recommendation and its boastful confidence.

After explaining how to use the weapons, the two donned their fireproof suits and ventured deeper into the corridor. The headlamp clipped onto the helmet made it look somewhat like an astronaut's helmet but smaller and more comfortable, without putting pressure on the neck. The entire outfit felt lightweight and breathable; at least Lo Bingting felt comfortably cool in it.

As they moved further inside, the corridor became densely packed with ugly flowers. Suddenly, Lo Bingting had an idea: if they burned the flowers directly, wouldn’t that waste the seeds inside them? This was a fantastic opportunity to rack up points.

"Xie Jinghang, why don’t we let these ugly things spray their seeds out before we set them on fire?"

Lo Bingting looked at Xie Jinghang, who thought for a moment before nodding. 

He took out the protective shield they had used earlier, and Lo Bingting began tossing incendiary bottles from her space. Meanwhile, Xie Jinghang unleashed a lightning strike.

As soon as they attacked, the ugly flower's vine-like tendrils whipped out, dozens of them striking together. Before the protective shield could fully deploy, Lo Bingting quickly pulled Xie Jinghang into her space.

"I was careless; I forgot how wide the attack range of the ugly flowers’ tendrils is."

Lo Bingting patted her chest, then removed her helmet. Perhaps after a long day of running around without much rest or food, she suddenly felt a bit lightheaded from low blood sugar. She hurriedly grabbed some food, and the two placed their helmets on the dining table before digging in.

It was only right to fill up before heading back out to collect points.

This time, she opted for a refreshing bowl of Korean cold noodles. As the weather grew hotter, she didn’t want to eat anything too warm. Xie Jinghang chose the same, and they each had a large bowl of cold noodles accompanied by kimchi and kumquat lemonade, making it feel more like a date than a mission to fight.

Outside was fraught with danger, but inside, they were at ease. Xie Jinghang felt slightly conflicted; the contrast was too stark. Watching Lo Bingting adapt so well, he thought that perhaps women were naturally better at coping with stress.

After eating their fill, Lo Bingting chatted with Xuanjing and the noisy spirit for a while before reminding Xie Jinghang to immediately deploy the protective shield as soon as they went out. They counted down from three, two, one, and reappeared in the exact spot they had left.

At that moment, the ugly flowers had stopped their tendril attacks. In fact, they ceased once they lost their target, but they hadn’t sprayed many seeds yet—the range of the incendiary bottles was indeed quite small.

"Let’s go again."

Xie Jinghang unleashed an electric net that caused the ugly flowers to screech in disarray. While the sound of a single flower was minimal, the collective noise of thousands of them became overwhelming. Just before the tendrils could strike again, they raised the protective shield. Lo Bingting seized the opportunity to throw several more incendiary bottles.

She had also checked her space earlier and found not only incendiary bottles but also fire bombs, though she wasn’t sure if they would be as effective as the Blaze Dragon.

This time, their offensive was far stronger than the previous wave. The ugly flowers sensed the threat to their lives and began attacking the protective shield frantically. Lo Bingting worried whether it would hold.

"Host, let the little fairy relax. The system only produces top-quality goods; these ugly creatures are nothing to worry about."

Xie Jinghang relayed the noisy spirit's words with a smile, which reassured Lo Bingting. As the ugly flowers’ attacks began to weaken, she took the chance to use the air gun.

Firing several shots in quick succession, the nearest cluster of ugly flowers was blasted to pieces, spraying seeds everywhere.

Lo Bingting swiftly set out some open jars in a row, waiting for the seeds to fall into them.

As the seeds hit the protective shield and bounced back into the jars, it wasn’t long before they saw a layer of seeds accumulating at the bottom of the jars. Some scattered outside, but Lo Bingting wasn’t in a hurry.

Feeling that this method wasn’t efficient enough, she pulled out a large net, originally meant for fishing, and started scooping up the seeds from the ground. This method proved to be significantly faster.

Before long, her net was filled with a small pile of seeds, and Lo Bingting excitedly called out to Xie Jinghang to continue. Just how many points would this yield? Seeing her greedy expression, Xie Jinghang couldn’t help but smile. The synergy between them was undeniable; it was certainly less tiring working together. 

In no time, they were both moving around, collecting seeds while Xie Jinghang dealt with the ugly flowers. Lo Bingting watched as he switched between various weapons—one moment freezing the flowers, the next wielding the Blaze Dragon, then unleashing a lightning strike, or using the air gun like a machine gun. 

But that wasn’t all; he also pulled out a long-forgotten Tang Dao, skillfully dodging the attacking tendrils and using his agility to slice through the surrounding ugly flowers, leaving a scene of utter chaos.

It was incredibly relieving to watch; at that moment, who cared about the fear of density? If the ugly flowers had legs, they would surely run away.

While the seeds were sprayed and the protective shield held strong, the ugly flowers couldn’t touch them a bit, only to be chopped into pieces. It was utterly frustrating for them.

Lo Bingting collected the seeds, filling one jar after another for Xie Jinghang to store. The noisy spirit was practically beaming with joy; its excitement was palpable from its cheerful voice. However, since the points weren’t doubled this time, this bounty of seeds likely wouldn’t be a small amount, so Xie Jinghang chose not to argue further, knowing when to stop was essential.

Still feeling that their efficiency was too low, the two of them hadn’t even cleared a third of the area. The deeper they ventured, the denser the ugly flowers became, and their attacks grew fiercer.

As their points increased, Xie Jinghang considered redeeming some explosives but ultimately abandoned the idea, fearing a cave-in. However, he did stumble upon a great find: a boomerang, notable for its ability to transform into three blades after being thrown, complete with an automatic return feature.
