System Upgrade

Xie Jinghang was trying to deal with the little white lotus in his deputy's office, but he decided to settle in Luo Bingtin's office instead. His own room had been assigned to a new ability user, a fact he had considered before, but hearing it confirmed left him feeling quite aggrieved.

Noticing his troubled expression, Luo Bingtin, with a playful glint in her eye, decided to tease him. "Have you forgotten how dramatically you left? You were so carefree."

"That was all part of the act; it had to feel real, or no one would believe it," he retorted, trying to maintain his composure.

"Exactly! The reason for assigning your room to someone else is pretty much the same—it's all about being genuine!"

"..." 

Xie Jinghang fell silent, crossing his legs and sprawling out on the long couch in Luo Bingtin's office. His long legs hung off the edge, making it clear that he was too tall for the three-seater sofa.

Luo Bingtin playfully smacked his calf. "Don't dirty my couch!"

Xie Jinghang shrugged, shaking his feet dismissively. "It won’t get dirty. Look how far my feet are from the couch!"

"Fine, just stay there. I’m going back to sleep," she replied, contemplating pulling out something she had previously stored in her spatial pocket. When Xie Jinghang leaned over to peek, he realized it was his belongings.

It seemed she hadn’t thrown his things away; instead, she had stored them for safekeeping. A broad smile broke on his face as he looked at her brightly. 

Feeling a bit awkward under his gaze, Luo Bingtin tossed a blanket at him. But the moment it covered his head, he burst into laughter, pulling it down only to find her gone.

In an upbeat mood, Xie Jinghang casually draped the blanket over himself. Despite the summer heat outside, the mountain air remained cool, making it uncomfortable to sleep without a cover.

Meanwhile, Luo Bingtin returned to her room, rubbed her face to wipe away her bashful expression, and quickly entered her spatial pocket. She hadn't been inside for a while, and upon entering, she noticed the Xuanjing was unusually agitated. 

"What's going on? Did you bring in something strange? The spiritual energy is all messed up!" it exclaimed, flashing warnings across the screen.

"Make sure to get it out quickly! You can't plant anything in the secret realm. Remember that!" 

This was the first time Luo Bingtin had seen the Xuanjing so flustered; it was nothing like its usual composed self. 

She spotted three mutated plant seeds floating in the air, not settling anywhere. It puzzled her why the spiritual energy was chaotic. She had assumed it was just her long absence that made her feel different.

"These are mutated plant seeds. I doubt anyone else could create something like this. Don’t worry, I’ll take them out!" she reassured, reaching to grab the seeds. However, she was met with a wall of spiritual energy that resisted her touch, preventing her from reaching them. 

With determination, she gripped the seeds tightly, and the Xuanjing urged, "Get them out quickly! Don't bring anything like this in again!" 

Luo Bingtin nodded and swiftly exited, opening her hand to examine the seeds closely, but she couldn’t make sense of them.

"Why are you back?" Xie Jinghang asked, seeing her return.

"It’s this troublesome thing. The Xuanjing said it’s contaminated the space, and I need to take it out. Can you hold onto it for me?" she said, shoving the seeds into his hands.

He was caught off guard and fell back onto the couch due to her sudden shove, causing Luo Bingtin to stumble forward and land on top of him. They froze in place, staring into each other's eyes, the atmosphere thickening around them. 

Feeling her cheeks heat up, Luo Bingtin quickly stood up, causing the seeds to tumble to the floor. 

Xie Jinghang straightened up, chuckling at her flustered state. 

"What's so funny? Stop laughing!" she pouted, her cheeks puffed up like a little pufferfish. 

Unable to contain himself, Xie Jinghang pinched her cheek gently, feeling the warmth radiate from her skin. He quickly withdrew his hand before she could react, but he couldn’t resist giving her another light pinch.

Luo Bingtin bent down to pick up the seeds scattered on the floor, shoving them back into Xie Jinghang's hand, muttering, "You better keep them safe. They’re too weird, and we don’t know how many more that guy has. It’s best to put them in your system space. I’m off!"

She hurriedly turned to leave, but just as she reached the door, Xie Jinghang called out, "Wait! Come back, something's wrong!"

Thinking he was joking, she halted abruptly and turned back. "Don’t mess with me; I’m going to sleep!"

"This is serious! Come back!" 

Seeing the earnest look on his face, Luo Bingtin quickly returned and sat opposite him on the couch.

Xie Jinghang spoke in a dry voice, "The seeds were directly swallowed by the system."

Luo Bingtin’s eyes widened. "What do you mean, 'swallowed'?"

"I mean they disappeared. The system just absorbed them and even upgraded itself," he explained.

Her eyes lit up with excitement. "That’s amazing! A lethal weapon! We won’t have to worry about those mutated plants anymore if your system can devour them."

"Exactly! But now I can exchange for some really powerful weapons, I just need points," Xie Jinghang replied, seemingly analyzing the system.

Luo Bingtin waited eagerly for him to finish, as she had a million questions lined up. After a while, he finally wrapped up his review, and the little chatterbox in his system was cheering as if celebrating a festival, thrilled to have finally upgraded after all their efforts.

"Shut up, you’re too loud!" Xie Jinghang growled, pinching the bridge of his nose to block out the noise.

The screen was flooded with text and emojis, scrolling by so quickly he barely had time to read anything. He focused solely on the new weapons available for exchange, and as he read, his frown deepened. Something felt off about the system.

"Enough with the celebration! What exactly are you?" he demanded, interrupting the chatterbox's festive spirit.

The chatterbox fell silent, unsure how to respond. In the past, it would have casually admitted it didn’t know, but with its recent upgrade, it now had access to more information.

"Don’t play dumb with me! Just spill it!" 

The chatterbox trembled, and a jumble of characters flashed across the screen. After releasing the sound filter, it cautiously responded, "Host, please don’t be so scary. I’m the apocalypse domination system!"

"Don’t give me that cheeky tone. What do you mean by 'domination'?" 

Xie Jinghang pointed at the task list on the screen, which blatantly stated a reward of ten billion points for the disappearance of humanity.

Xie Jinghang couldn’t help but laugh bitterly. If humanity were extinct, what good would points and weapons be to him? After all, he was human too, wasn’t he included in that count?

"This must be a bug! I’ll report it right away!" the chatterbox stammered, realizing something was wrong. It hadn’t seen that task in the mainframe before—had it just been issued? Why hadn’t it been informed?
