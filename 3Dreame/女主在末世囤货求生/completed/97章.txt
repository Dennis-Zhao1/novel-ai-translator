**The System's Flaws**

"I think your space is way more practical than the system," Xie Jinghang remarked, immediately undermining the system’s abilities. The noisy AI on the screen didn’t have the chance to argue back; what could it possibly say? After all, it was using the resources provided by Brother Xuanjing, living off him—could it really insult him? It wouldn’t be very ethical for a system to act that way.

With a sigh of exasperation at the host who only knew how to complain, the system went quiet, clearly opting to disengage.

Luo Bingtin, puzzled, asked, "But the system can still exchange for weapons, right? That alone makes it pretty useful. It's no wonder I’ve never seen you ask me for weapon gear."

The two were sitting cross-legged on the grass. Not far away, a couch set up by Luo Bingtin remained unoccupied, but neither of them seemed interested in sitting on it.

Xie Jinghang leisurely reclined, his hands propped behind his head, gazing at the blue sky and fluffy white clouds as he spoke, "The spiritual energy in this space has already repaired my damaged meridians. That’s pretty powerful in itself. The best part? It’s free."

Luo Bingtin quickly understood, realizing that everything in the system required points for exchange. It seemed Xie Jinghang had been oppressed for too long, harboring lots of resentment.

"Have you not found any loopholes or bugs to farm points?" she inquired.

By now, Xie Jinghang had closed his eyes in relaxation. "Of course I have. I tried a few times, but it played tricks and refused to acknowledge it. There was that time I faced Fu Buqi; I could have taken him out directly! But the noisy AI failed me at a crucial moment, insisting that the main system would find out. I had enough points, but it just didn’t let me exchange them."

His tone was filled with disdain and regret.

Luo Bingtin sighed as well. She had given him a rocket launcher, and yet Fu Buqi still managed to survive.

She then recounted the events from the previous night and her suspicions. When she mentioned that using the rocket launcher hadn’t killed Fu Buqi and that he had disappeared, leaving only his eldest son dead, Xie Jinghang's first reaction was, “Just as I thought.”

In perfect sync, they both exclaimed, "He has a system/space too?"

Luo Bingtin doubted it was a space. If Fu Buqi had one, he wouldn’t have entrusted important supplies and weapons to Fan Zhenzhen. 

After explaining her reasoning to Xie Jinghang, he fell silent for a moment. The girl was indeed the type to quietly accomplish big things. Initially, their plan had only been to disrupt the engagement ceremony, making it harder for Fu Buqi to form alliances and leaving him in disarray. 

To his surprise, she had directly wiped out his son, cleaned out all his supplies, and killed his enemy in one fell swoop.

Upon further inquiry, he learned that Fan Zhenzhen was one of the survivors from their first encounter. He felt a wave of frustration wash over him; he had inadvertently handed Fu Buqi a valuable ally so early on. How could he not be annoyed?

Especially when Luo Bingtin mentioned she had initially wanted to kill the scheming Zhen but had been stopped by him, he couldn’t help but feel ridiculous.

In his previous life, he had never heard or seen anyone like Fan Zhenzhen around Fu Buqi. According to Luo Bingtin’s description, she must hold significant importance to him, even having a special status at the Kunshan base. 

It could only be concluded that Fu Buqi was exceptionally skilled at hiding this crucial piece.

He genuinely envied Luo Bingtin’s lucky fortune, which had come about by sheer happenstance. Now, the most crucial thing they had to face upon leaving was looming ahead.

Luo Bingtin glanced at the sundial. The flow of time in the space was slow; not much time had passed outside. She assured him to stay put while she went to wash up in their RV and changed into fresh clothes for him, as he was looking quite disheveled.

After cleaning himself up and changing into the new outfit prepared by Luo Bingtin, he emerged looking refreshed and impeccably sharp.

Taking advantage of the moment, Xie Jinghang also familiarized himself with the general conditions of the space. He discovered that the water in the lake was not only sweet but had healing properties for internal injuries, rivaling healing-type abilities.

The spiritual energy had also significantly widened his meridians, leaving him with a tingling sensation, an exhilarating feeling of energy surging within him.

Estimating it was nearly meal time, Luo Bingtin asked him what he wanted to eat. He initially thought she would only bring canned goods or compressed biscuits, but to his surprise, she offered him a choice between a bowl of spicy and sour noodles in her left hand and a takeout box in her right.

Okay, he had been narrow-minded. With a space like this, why stick to canned biscuits or bread? Silently accepting the bowl of spicy and sour noodles she offered, he sat down at the dining table.

Luo Bingtin also took a bowl of noodles and sat across from him, accompanied by a heap of skewers and fried snacks she had packed from the night market, along with a chilled soda she had personally prepared.

Despite not usually being a fan of sodas, Xie Jinghang felt immensely satisfied at that moment. Aunt Li’s cooking was already quite good, and the food in the apocalypse stronghold had always been decent, which was why so many supernatural beings had chosen to stay. He didn't want to admit he was one of them.

Delicious food had a way of soothing the soul, especially in the apocalypse.

After their meal, not much time had passed according to the sundial. Unable to sit still, Xie Jinghang took a break before starting his training.

Luo Bingtin remained seated, digesting her food while watching him train.

Before long, he noticed that his abilities seemed to be getting stronger. Turning to her, he exclaimed, "My powers seem to have leveled up!"

He had absorbed so many second-level crystal cores without seeing any improvement, but after just one time in the space, he had upgraded. No wonder the noisy AI was always urging him to stick close to Luo Bingtin, crying out for help. He had asked it why but it never explained the reason, and now it made sense.

With a hand raised toward the open grass, he unleashed his lightning abilities like a net of electricity, crackling loudly as a group of rabbits nearby were instantly electrocuted.

Embarrassed, he chuckled awkwardly at Luo Bingtin, his expression not exactly brilliant.

Luo Bingtin could only think to herself, "Are you alright?"

There were genuinely a lot of rabbits in the space; if a few were electrocuted, it wasn’t a big deal. They could reproduce quickly, after all.

In any case, they would eventually be preparing spicy rabbit heads for Aunt Li later.

Noticing that Luo Bingtin was unfazed, he suddenly connected the dots: the signature dishes in the cafeteria, spicy rabbit heads and spicy rabbit chunks, had to have come from somewhere.

To pass the time, they practiced sparring in the space, allowing Xie Jinghang to experience the thrill of zero energy consumption.

Was this feeling of unleashing abilities without fatigue truly real?

In the envy and jealousy of Luo Bingtin, he leveled up once again.

He truly couldn’t deny it; a strong person was just strong. In his previous life, they had all been powerful beings with mutated abilities, and in this life, he would undoubtedly be no different.

To express his gratitude to Luo Bingtin, he insisted on doing what he could. Finally, Luo Bingtin, unable to watch any longer, handed him a sickle and pointed to a patch of wheat that had grown robustly.

"This field of wheat is now your responsibility."

Xie Jinghang assumed Luo Bingtin had planted it as a precaution. He bent down and began to harvest, bundling it up as he went.

In his mind, he wondered whether the young lady didn’t understand farming, noticing that the seeds weren’t planted evenly; some areas were dense while others were sparse.

During this time, Luo Bingtin finished cataloging the supplies and weapons she had confiscated from the green tea schemer. She had felt elated at the time of the collection, but now, counting everything, her satisfaction multiplied.

Looking at the neatly stacked pile of supplies and weapons, she thought, this time, even if Fu Buqi didn’t die, he would surely be left in a dire situation.
