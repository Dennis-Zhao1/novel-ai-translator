Title: The Trials of the Saintly Maiden

Parking her car discreetly among the abandoned vehicles by the roadside, Luo Bingtin watched the group of young men and women sprinting away from a horde of zombies. She had no intention of stepping in to play the hero; after all, she had never met these people before, and it wasn’t her job to rescue them. 

Besides, the little saintly maiden was among them. What if she got dragged into trouble? Just thinking about her whiny, sobbing demeanor was enough to put Luo Bingtin in a foul mood.

The six of them were running for their lives, with the saintly maiden desperately clutching the sleeve of her brother, Ziqian, slowing him down. It was as if she was determined to take him down with her. Meanwhile, the elegant older sister in their group wasn’t fast either, but at least she wasn’t holding anyone back.

The twins were the most energetic, zipping past Luo Bingtin's car without even noticing her watching from inside, comfortably observing their frantic escape.

The relentless undead were hot on their heels—a veritable sea of zombies following them, perhaps seventy or eighty strong, if not more. Those that fell behind lost their target and began to wander aimlessly, some even gathering around her car.

Luo Bingtin couldn’t help but think, didn’t she leave only three or four zombies for them? Now it felt like a threefold return on her generosity. 

No need for that.

Resigned, she exited her vehicle and unsheathed her sword, swiftly taking down the nearest zombies. Ever since Xie Jinghang had taught her a few martial arts moves, she could easily dispatch seven or eight zombies in one go.

However, when the numbers started to swell, it became a bit trickier, especially with the freezing cold nipping at her fingers and toes. Movement was sluggish, and firing a gun would attract unwanted noise. Thankfully, she had a suppressor.

Combining her sword with her gun, she managed to clear out enough zombies, but it took time. By the time she finished, night had fallen. She knew traveling after dark was a bad idea; she needed to find a building to shelter in until morning.

Retrieving her car, she quickly made her way toward the treasure pavilion, which was conveniently not far away. The road was once again quiet and safe, the group having led the zombies away.

Snow began to fall softly as she entered the pavilion, opening the door with a quiet creak. The vast, empty hall felt eerily desolate in the darkness, an atmosphere that brought a tinge of fear, but Luo Bingtin was more afraid of the zombies and the depravity of humanity than anything else.

Being an old building several hundred years old, the insulation was terrible. Without heating or a fire, it was almost unbearable. 

She found a staff lounge, a series of small rooms, each about twenty square meters. Choosing a clean one with a single bed and a table, she locked the door behind her and prepared to have her dinner.

Once again, she felt proud of her foresight—ordering takeout from Hangcheng was such a treat. The box she had randomly grabbed from the shelf was like a blind box of goodies. 

As she opened it, the steaming aroma of Dongpo pork and sautéed shrimp wafted out, mingling with the refreshing scent of green vegetables. Luo Bingtin savored every bite, enjoying the delicious meal.

After filling her belly and resting a bit, she knew it was unsafe to venture out in the pitch-black darkness. Instead, she quietly listened to the sound of snow falling while applying heating pads to warm herself.

Once she had placed the heating pads around her waist and calves, she finally felt the warmth spreading through her body. Just as she was about to snuggle into the single bed, she heard rustling noises outside.

“Look, there are footprints here, and the door isn’t locked. Hurry up and get inside!”

Luo Bingtin groaned internally. It was the little saintly maiden. What a headache. She hadn’t cleaned up the footprints outside, and now it had led to her discovery. Grabbing her handgun, she remained still, her heart racing.

Using her mental power, she sensed it was the same six people again. Talk about luck; they had managed to shake off so many zombies and ended up right under her nose.

“Ziqian, be careful! You’re bleeding so much!” the saintly maiden sobbed, and Luo Bingtin felt a vein twitch on her forehead.

“Shut up! Do you want to attract more zombies?” a voice hissed, clearly annoyed. The saintly maiden quieted down immediately.

“It seems relatively safe here. I checked; there are no zombies on this street, but the footprints at the door...” 

That must have been the twins speaking.

There was a moment of silence as Luo Bingtin felt them searching around the pavilion. She sighed internally—either she could retreat into her space or be discovered. Retreating into her space wasn’t a bad idea, but if they took a liking to this lounge, she would be out of luck when she emerged.

She could always take them all out now, she thought, her handgun safety already disengaged.

“It’s normal to have other people here. Let’s not disturb them; they found this place first. Let’s make the most of our rest and wait until dawn to leave,” Ziqian said, as if he were deliberately speaking to Luo Bingtin.

He was smart—he didn’t pry, wasn’t curious, and didn’t show any malice.

Luo Bingtin didn’t respond, relieved they weren’t looking for trouble. She didn’t want to resort to unnecessary bloodshed either. 

Soon, she sensed they had indeed found the lounge and were settling into their respective rooms. Her mental awareness picked up on them choosing the rooms closest to the entrance, and she decided to let them be, staying on high alert.

“Ziqian, can I come in? I need to bandage your wound. I have some band-aids,” the saintly maiden said, her voice almost a whimper.

“Um, I’ll handle it myself,” Ziqian replied, his tone devoid of emotion. Perhaps his coldness made the saintly maiden think twice about insisting.

In another room, the conversation continued.

“Xiaoruo, are you really set on going to the Maple Grove villa base?” 

This saintly maiden sure could talk a lot when she wasn’t sobbing.

“Yeah, Weiwei, you should come with me! Last time, they found so many supplies, and Linlin and the others went too. We won’t have to risk our necks looking for things. They have guns, and the villa is spacious with people guarding it. It’s super safe!” Xiaoruo sounded hopeful.

“Are you sure they’ll come to pick you up tomorrow?” Weiwei asked.

“I heard Linlin say they come to pick up survivors every Monday. I’ve done my homework; just leave a mark, and they’ll come for you. I’ve already prepared the mark. Whether they come or not, we’ll know tomorrow!” 

Xiaoruo’s optimistic and confident tone was infectious, but the saintly maiden didn’t respond, likely deep in thought.

Luo Bingtin found their conversation amusing. This base sounded rather promising, gathering supplies and sheltering survivors. She wondered who ran the place. Could it be military? Why not go to the Kunshan base instead?

Lost in her thoughts, the chatter finally died down.

After a short nap, the dawn light began to creep in, and she could hear voices from the rooms above.

“Xiaoruo, I thought about it all night, and I’m not going with you,” said the saintly maiden.

“Why not? The Maple Grove base is super safe. Isn’t it better to find Linlin and the others?” 

“I...,” the saintly maiden hesitated, her voice still grating on Luo Bingtin’s nerves, probably because of her overly innocent demeanor.

“I have to take care of Ziqian. He got hurt because of me yesterday. I can’t leave him.” 

Luo Bingtin wondered how the others reacted to her words. She herself could barely tolerate such a burden; that boy, Ziqian, must have the patience of a saint to deal with her. If it were her, she would have shot her on the spot.

Unfortunately, the elegant older sister hadn’t heard her; no one called her out, and Luo Bingtin felt she had lost a chance to vent her frustrations.

As daylight broke, Luo Bingtin grew impatient. Why weren’t they leaving already? If they didn’t move, she wouldn’t be able to either.

After finishing her breakfast in her space, she completed her morning exercises, and just then, the door to the treasure pavilion was kicked open.
