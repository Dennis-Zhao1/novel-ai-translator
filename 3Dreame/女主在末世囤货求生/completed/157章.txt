**Magic Seed**

“It’s all good then! Here, have some more to solidify it. I made tea with lake water; it tastes even better. Or if you’d prefer coffee, that works too!”

“Tea is fine.”

Xie Jinghang took the cup of tea handed to him and drank it in one go. He was really thirsty, feeling a bit sticky and uncomfortable.

Luo Bingtian seemed to notice this too. There was no way to ignore the faint sour odor emanating from the man opposite her, but it wasn't off-putting. After all, he had been sweating a lot, and she had only wiped the exposed parts of his skin.

Seeing that he looked uncomfortable, Luo Bingtian gestured toward the RV outside. “You should go take a shower over there. I can’t handle the plumbing in the old house; it’s not connected. Luckily, there’s no night in this space, so it doesn’t matter if the room has electricity or not.”

Xie Jinghang nodded, taking the sportswear set that Luo Bingtian had prepared for him, still in its unopened package, just like last time.

While waiting for him to shower, Luo Bingtian changed the bedding in the bedroom, relieved that she had stocked up on linens. She noticed the bedclothes were soaked with sweat, taking the liberty to boil some water again, planning to brew him a few more cups of tea once he was back.

Not long after, Xie Jinghang returned. It suddenly struck Luo Bingtian that he had a wound on his arm, which wasn’t ideal to get wet. However, he seemed unconcerned. The wound looked worse than expected; the water had directly washed over it, and many parts were showing signs of whitening.

Xie Jinghang rubbed his hair with a towel and looked at Luo Bingtian in confusion. “What’s wrong?”

“Are you really asking? You didn’t think to be careful while showering? Doesn’t it hurt?” Luo Bingtian pointed at his wound and retorted.

“It’s nothing, just a little scratch... ouch!” He had barely finished speaking when the sting of iodine from Luo Bingtian applying it interrupted him.

“Hehe, doesn’t hurt? Trying to be a hero, huh? What if you faint again? I might not be able to catch you the second time!” 

Xie Jinghang froze at her words, recalling how he had collapsed directly into Luo Bingtian’s arms before. His ears suddenly felt hot.

“It won’t happen,” he mumbled, not caring if she heard him.

After treating his wound, Luo Bingtian thought about the current weather not being suitable for bandaging. It was better to let it air out, which would help the wound heal, so she chose not to say more.

Meanwhile, Xie Jinghang felt a flutter of joy inside, thinking that this injury was worth it for all the care he was receiving from Luo Bingtian. He felt elated.

“Chatterbox, you’ve got five minutes to say goodbye to your brother Xuanjing. We need to head out.”

Xie Jinghang stood in front of the screen and said, “Host, how did you wake up so quickly? I haven’t had enough fun yet! Brother Xuanjing’s story isn’t finished; I don’t want to leave!”

“Well, you can stay behind. I’m leaving.” 

“You know I can’t stay by myself!” 

“Enough of the drama; we have business to attend to outside.”

Xie Jinghang firmly interrupted the chatterbox’s lament. The next moment, he appeared in Luo Bingtian’s dormitory, right on her bed.

They both froze, a little too close for comfort, staring into each other's eyes without making a move.

“Host, what are you two doing?”

The chatterbox’s sudden voice broke the moment, causing Xie Jinghang’s brow to twitch. The good atmosphere was instantly shattered by its loudness. He quickly sat up and got off the bed, while Luo Bingtian awkwardly fixed her hair and jumped down from the other side.

“Every time we enter the space, the filters I set for you fail. It’s really annoying,” he complained, quickly hitting the mute button for the chatterbox, feeling his mind clear up.

Seeing Luo Bingtian's slightly awkward expression, he realized his earlier reaction might have been too extreme, almost as if he was trying to distance himself from her. He silently cursed the chatterbox for being a nuisance and making her misunderstand.

At the same time, Luo Bingtian was scolding herself for suddenly acting starry-eyed, staring at his face without blinking for so long. She had looked at him while he was unconscious, but it hadn’t felt this way. Something must be off; perhaps she had been poisoned?

Lost in her self-doubt, Luo Bingtian didn’t notice Xie Jinghang’s expression of guilt and self-reproach.

Before long, there was a knock on the door.

“Miss Luo, it’s me, An Min. You need to come out; something’s not quite right.”

Luo Bingtian immediately opened the door. An Min rushed in, and upon seeing Xie Jinghang in the room, he froze, unable to continue speaking.

“Uh, did I interrupt something? Sorry, that wasn’t my intention.”

“Just tell me what’s going on; that doesn’t matter,” Luo Bingtian replied without waiting for Xie Jinghang to speak, already leading An Min to sit on the sofa.

“So, you arranged for me to wrap things up with Uncle Zhu, right? I didn’t dare let anyone else handle this, fearing some danger might arise. I’ve carefully picked these out with chopsticks and stored them. But look, it hasn’t been long, and some of them are starting to look off. Look, they might be sprouting.”

As he spoke, he handed a glass jar that used to hold pickled vegetables to Luo Bingtian. It was filled about two-thirds with dark seeds, roughly the size of red dates, and indeed some were beginning to show signs of sprouting.

“They can’t be allowed to sprout and grow. That one flower was enough to fill a pot! If these grow any larger, no one might be able to escape.”

An Min nodded, pointing at the jar. “You handle it. I’m going back to sleep. I’m so tired. You both should rest early too. Goodnight!”

After saying this, An Min clapped his hands and quickly exited, his speed making it seem like he was utilizing wind-based abilities to the fullest.

Luo Bingtian held the jar of seeds, staring blankly at the closed door, then shifted her gaze to Xie Jinghang, who wore an expression that said, “This has nothing to do with me.”

“What do you think we should do with these? If they all sprout, the fortress could explode!”

“Host, these are good things! Quickly! Give them all to me!” the chatterbox exclaimed, making Xie Jinghang question whether he had indeed pressed the mute button.

“What do you want these for? To eat?” he asked.

“The energy in these seeds is what the mainframe likes! Host, hurry! I can help you solve this problem!” 

Luo Bingtian looked skeptically at Xie Jinghang, who had been quiet. She realized that his current state was a bit off and deduced he was conversing with the system.

“Last time, you just took those four seeds without a word. You can’t do that this time.”

“Host, please! I’ll make it up to you! I’ll double the points in exchange for them. Really, double!” 

“Then tell me how many points one seed is worth. If it’s less than what I expect, I won’t trade. I’ll just burn them all; let’s see how those seeds can sprout then.”

“Don’t! Host, you can’t waste good resources!” 

The chatterbox sounded like it was about to cry, its voice rising dramatically as if it had just lost five hundred bucks.

“If you promise to be quiet, I might consider it...” 

“I’ll be quiet! I’ll behave! Host, how about this: One seed for one thousand points. I’ll give you two thousand points for each seed, sound good?”

After making the offer, the chatterbox looked eagerly at Xie Jinghang, waiting for a response.

“Two thousand points is too little. One seed for ten thousand points.”

“Are you trying to rip me off? What kind of seed is worth that much? Is it encrusted with diamonds?”
