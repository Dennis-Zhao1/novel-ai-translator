**Spit Out My Ancient Jade**

“Spit out my ancient jade!” she exclaimed, dragging out the last syllable to express her frustration. 

After a while, she noticed the characters in the mirror moving. 

“I can’t spit it out anymore; please accept my condolences,” it replied. 

The situation was dire, otherwise Luo Bingtin would have dragged it out and given it a good beating. 

Reluctantly accepting reality, she sat back down on the grass, her head hanging low as she gazed at the pile of gold bars and the jewelry scattered on the tray. 

At least there were these, right? 

She began cleaning up the mess, carefully setting each piece of jewelry from the tray aside. After a rough count, she realized there were over seventy high-quality gemstone pieces and more than a hundred mid-range ones. There weren’t any that were of average quality, but Fu Buzhi, her grandfather’s apprentice, had learned well after his betrayal, and he managed to use what he had picked up quite skillfully. 

The collection of high-end jade jewelry was even more impressive, each piece a significant item. There were seven or eight complete sets of the Emperor Green jade, all top-tier and capable of shaking the industry if sold. 

Her grandfather had once mentioned that they also owned a set, but he never explained why it was gone. 

Adding up the individual pieces, there must have been over a hundred, and more than two hundred high-end jade bracelets. The exquisite craftsmanship on the mid-range jade plaques numbered over four hundred. 

After a rough estimate of the market value of these jewels, she gasped; it must be worth over a hundred million, and that didn’t even include the value of the four pieces of ancient jade that had been swallowed. 

Thinking about the ancient jade made her want to cry again. 

Now with a clear understanding of the market value of the jewelry, Luo Bingtin began rummaging through the scattered gold bars on the ground. 

Calling them gold bars was somewhat misleading; in the industry, this kind of unadorned gold is referred to as “plain gold,” marked only with purity and weight stamps. 

These were raw materials for jewelry processing, and buying plain gold didn’t require paying a processing fee; it was directly calculated based on international gold prices. The only catch was that they were all standardized at a weight of 1000 grams, which is one kilogram. A single piece could cost several hundred thousand, so ordinary folks wouldn’t generally buy them. 

This batch seemed to have been melted and cast by itself, lacking any factory stamps from gold suppliers. 

It was reasonable to doubt that the source of this gold was clean, which was why Fu Buzhi had to melt it down into plain gold bars. 

This was borderline illegal, and she didn’t worry about Fu Buzhi discovering it and reporting her; she just needed to be extremely cautious when cashing it out. 

For the time being, it was best not to show up in the market to avoid exposure. Timing was everything; when the apocalypse hit, who would even care about this? 

After stacking the gold bars neatly into piles of fifty, she counted and realized there were over a hundred stacks. No wonder that guy, Luo, was so tall; dragging gold around was quite the workout, and it was so simple to just haul a person instead. 

A single bag must weigh at least seventy or eighty kilograms—wasn’t that a workout? 

Based on the current international gold prices, she calculated that this gold was worth over two hundred million. Fu Buzhi was something else; how had he amassed such wealth in just a few years? Now it was all coming to her advantage. 

Luo Bingtin’s previously gloomy mood brightened up; the wind felt sweet, the clouds warm, and the grass soft beneath her. 

Yet that cursed mirror still looked as annoying as ever, hmph. 

Thinking about when Fu Buzhi would find out and whether he would be so furious he’d choke on his own blood, her mood lifted even more. 

She tidied up the space, stuffing the pile of old newspapers into garbage bags, storing them with the clothes she had previously changed out of, planning to dispose of them all together later. 

In the pre-apocalypse world, she had to work hard to cash out and gather enough supplies as her main task. 

She was planning to pull a fast one on Fu Buzhi financially, ensuring that until she had the absolute upper hand over him, she wouldn’t rashly show up in front of him. 

She steeled her resolve; it was only a matter of time before the bad guys got what they deserved. 

Having made up her mind, Luo Bingtin exited the space, unaware that she had overlooked many crucial points. 

In the real world, it was already the afternoon of the twenty-seventh. Calculating the flow rate of her space, she realized she had been inside for quite some time. No wonder she was feeling so hungry. 

For the past few days, Auntie hadn’t come to clean or cook at Yun Ding Feng Hua; basic cleaning was left to the robot vacuum. After tidying up, she planned to go out for a meal. 

Just then, her phone rang—it was Zhu Yidan’s voice. 

“Hey sister, have you adjusted to the time difference? My grandpa is inviting you over for dinner!” 

Luo Bingtin’s heart sank a little; she understood what was coming. 

Maintaining a calm facade, she said that she had just woken up and would be over after getting ready. She quickly washed up, applied a light makeup, and changed into some clothes before heading downstairs to get her car. The garage felt particularly empty now; all the girls had gotten married, leaving only her own car and the ones her grandfather and father had gifted her for their birthdays. 

She thought about whether she should sell this place at Yun Ding and put her cars into the space; such a large area couldn’t be wasted. 

Driving her favorite understated black sedan, Luo Bingtin stopped at the mall to buy a gift to bring along. She hurried to the Zhu family’s old residence, arriving just before dinner. Unlike the Luo family’s old house located in the outskirts, the Zhu family’s residence was situated at the heart of the royal city, thriving for generations in the most prosperous and mysterious area of Kyoto. 

Who else could say their neighbor was a royal residence? Only the Zhu family could. 

The Luo family had been similar to the Zhu family in the past, but after several generations of decline, they settled on the outskirts. 

Now, thanks to her grandfather, the Zhu family maintained their status and wealth. 

With the Zhu grandfather’s turn to host, Luo Bingtin sighed lightly in her heart, presenting a bright and charming smile as she greeted Zhu grandfather, uncles, and brothers. 

The Zhu family was a large clan; as long as the old patriarch was alive, he wouldn’t allow anyone to think of splitting the family, much like the Qin family. However, the Qin family had long established that the eldest son would take charge, while the second son sought to expand overseas markets and secure weapon resources to hold sway over the other brothers, sacrificing a comfortable life at home for this. 

Back to the main topic, once Luo Bingtin sat down with the Zhu grandfather and the elders, Zhu Yidan thoughtfully sat close to her. The dinner, while not particularly lively, was still enjoyable. 

After the meal, the Zhu grandfather stood up first with the aid of his cane, inviting Luo Bingtin to his study for tea, and called along several of his sons and grandsons. 

Zhu Yidan wasn’t among those called, and with a slight pout, she said to Luo Bingtin, “I’ll wait for you in my room. Come find me after you’re done talking!” 

Luo Bingtin nodded, following the elders upstairs to the old man’s study. 

Once everyone was seated, the door to the study was shut. Luo Bingtin looked at the Zhu family elders and brothers surrounding her, feeling like a little sheep surrounded by wolves, and forced a bitter smile. 

She had thought that the tricks to fool the younger generation would never escape the eyes of these old foxes; it had only been a few days, and she had already been too careless, too conspicuous. 

Seeing the little girl’s worried expression, the Zhu grandfather couldn’t help but chuckle. 

“Luo girl, don’t be afraid. Grandpa Zhu isn’t here to scare you. I called you here today to see what’s going on; why can’t you hold on to your money?” 

“Grandpa Zhu, today’s setup is a bit overwhelming for me; it’s only natural that I feel a little anxious,” Luo Bingtin replied, cleverly dodging the question. 

“Luo girl, you and our Dan girl grew up together. I have a deep bond with your grandfather, so you can tell me anything,” he urged warmly. 

Luo Bingtin wanted to stretch the conversation and evade the topic, but unexpectedly, a Zhu family uncle directly pulled out a file folder from the bookshelf and handed it to her. 

Luo Bingtin looked down, her heart skipping a beat, but her face remained calm.
