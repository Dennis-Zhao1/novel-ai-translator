**Poisoning**

After the ten individuals at Longxiang Base completed their physical examinations, they were injected with awakening agents. During this time, the driver sent out by Lily—a pivotal character—who had been fending off zombies, finally regained consciousness. The first thing on his mind was to exact revenge on Lily.

Once calmed by others at Longxiang Base, he sincerely thanked Xie Jinghang and the others. Meanwhile, Lily remained confined in the dormitory area, blissfully unaware that she had just danced on the brink of death.

That day, the vice-captain was busy organizing training for the team in the courtyard. The other ten members, having spent a few days cooped up, found the situation tedious and decided to join the vice-captain in training. They all knew that only those with good physical abilities and passed health checks were eligible for the awakening injections.

In a shadowy corner, Lily sat with a bright smile, watching the vice-captain lead the training session. Her apparent joy was misleading; she was actually disappointed since Xie Jinghang had only appeared once and then vanished. Her plans to charm him had come to a standstill, leaving the vice-captain as a fallback option.

Her goal had always been to target the most outstanding and powerful man in the crowd.

As the teammates began teasing the vice-captain, the Longxiang members exchanged glances, hesitant to voice their opinions. They hadn't forgotten Lily's true nature and felt it was necessary to warn the vice-captain, who seemed smitten.

Unfortunately, after the training, the vice-captain whisked Lily away for a private conversation, leaving the others no chance to intervene. A group watched from a distance, expressions ranging from amusement to pity, while some clicked their tongues in disapproval, unsure if it was disdain or something else.

Seeing Lily dabbing the vice-captain's forehead with a handkerchief prompted several teammates to gasp in unison. They muttered about how the atmosphere was suffocating.

The vice-captain was showering Lily with sweet compliments, his ruggedly handsome face lending a strange credibility to his words. If a less attractive man had said the same things, Lily would have dismissed them as empty flattery.

Perhaps due to loneliness, Lily now seemed increasingly dependent on the vice-captain. She clung to him, eager to awaken her powers and escape the confines of the dormitory.

“Weiwei, have you been under a lot of stress lately? Your dark circles are terrible,” the vice-captain observed, concern filling his voice as he scrutinized the dark shadows under Lily's eyes.

His gaze felt suffocating to Lily, and the two of them inched closer together as if drawn by an invisible force.

“Ahem,” a fake cough startled them into quickly creating some distance. Lily, unsure if she was genuinely shy or just pretending, lowered her head and turned away, not even noticing who had entered.

The vice-captain looked up awkwardly to see Zhu Yidan standing in the courtyard, her expression one of disdain. He waved his hands, urging her to leave and not to interfere.

Zhu Yidan rolled her eyes in irritation, seemingly intent on stirring the pot. “Are you two together now? I remember someone was clinging to someone else's boyfriend not long ago. Did you switch targets that quickly? Trying to catch fish in troubled waters?”

Zhu Yidan thought she was being subtle, avoiding outright accusations of Lily's fickleness, but as soon as Lily heard her words, she exploded with anger.

“Unlike you, at least I liked someone else's boyfriend! You just directly stole your friend's boyfriend. How can you say anything to me?”

Lily's face turned crimson, a mix of embarrassment and rage.

The vice-captain placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder and gently patted her back to calm her down.

Zhu Yidan raised an eyebrow, clearly amused by Lily's reaction, pretending to be concerned. “Well, I guess it's just my charm. Do you really think anyone is going to pay you any attention?”

Lily was furious, tugging on the vice-captain's shirt as if seeking his support. He feigned ignorance, softly advising her not to be upset, maintaining an air of not wanting to offend Zhu Yidan.

Zhu Yidan pressed on, “Half of the fortress belongs to my Zhu family. What do you have, being a lonely girl? Pathetic.”

“Fine! I can move out today. You can stay here by yourself,” Lily declared, suddenly realizing she couldn't continue to wallow in what she thought was love. The man in front of her couldn't stand up for her; all his so-called tenderness felt insincere.

However, she didn’t show her true feelings, masking her vulnerability flawlessly. The vice-captain, witnessing her demeanor, felt his heart race, recalling how she had once desperately banged on the door, her hysterical cries etched in his memory. He might genuinely find himself enchanted by her.

“Alright, stop crying. If you keep it up, you won't look good,” the vice-captain said, using the handkerchief meant for wiping sweat to dab away her tears. The salt from the dried sweat stung her eyes, and what had started as a feigned cry now turned genuine.

Lily wore a cheerful facade, internally cursing. If anyone found out about this, it would be utterly humiliating.

She dramatically wiped her eyes with the handkerchief, no longer interested in arguing with the vice-captain, and headed back to her room.

At that moment, Zhu Yidan was ready to leave, having packed her things. Lily kicked the door open, annoyed, and asked, “Where do you think you’re going?”

Zhu Yidan, initially uninterested, noticed Lily's reddened eyes and exaggerated her response. “Why do you care where I go? I'm moving in with my mom; I refuse to squeeze into a room with certain people. It's utterly annoying!”

“How can you just leave?” Lily exclaimed.

“The fortress belongs to my Zhu family as much as it does to anyone else. Is your hearing bad? Maybe you should consider donating your ears,” Zhu Yidan retorted.

“You stole Luo Bingtian's man, and you can still wander around freely?” Lily exclaimed, incredulous. She couldn't fathom how someone could be so magnanimous after having their partner taken away.

“Hah! You think everyone is like you? Luo Luo is currently the highest-ranking administrator of the fortress. She can have any man she desires; it's only fair that her friends like her too. But you’ll never experience such things in your life, since the men she doesn’t want wouldn’t even look at you. Tsk, if I were you, I’d rather be dead.”

With that, Zhu Yidan shouldered her bags and walked away, leaving Lily fuming with impotent rage.

Unaware of the disdain directed at him, the vice-captain felt incredibly pleased with his recent performance, convinced that he had Lily wrapped around his finger.

Meanwhile, Lily faced an incessant barrage of setbacks, leading her to a fierce resolution.

That night, while the vice-captain thought he could finally sleep soundly, his eyelids twitched violently. He couldn't fall asleep even as his teammates began to snore.

Opting to visit the restroom, he spotted a familiar figure sneaking around and climbing through a window.

He turned on his heel, hastily following her. This time, Lily wasn’t just tending to her garden at midnight. He watched as she pulled out a package from her pocket, which looked like some kind of powder, and poured it into the gutters surrounding the dormitory.

Seeing this, the vice-captain's heart raced, his instincts screaming to act. He stifled his unease and, once Lily finished her dubious task and headed back inside, he quickly retrieved the crumpled package of powder she had discarded.

Without hesitation, he climbed over the wall and rushed to find Captain Xie, his mind solely focused on the urgent need to report this to the captain and Miss Luo.
