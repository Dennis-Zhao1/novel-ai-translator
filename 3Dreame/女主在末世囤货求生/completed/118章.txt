### Breach in the Fortress

Lo Bingting felt her head buzz as if she had been wrapped in soundproof material. Everything around her became muffled, the sounds unclear. Then she saw Xie Jinghang being held by Zhu Yidan, his arm raised as if he wanted to embrace her back. Zhu Yidan seemed to want to say something but suddenly fainted. At that moment, Zhu Erge returned to the battlefield and was equally astonished by the scene before him. He quickly channeled his healing abilities into Zhu Yidan.

Watching Xie Jinghang's anxious expression as he held Zhu Yidan, Lo Bingting's gaze dimmed, and a sneer escaped her lips. She turned and hurried up the city tower. Meng Ge, An Min, and the others were still below, surrounded by hordes of zombies, and time was of the essence; they couldn’t afford any delays. 

The zombies were playing a game of misdirection with her, and her anger had reached its peak. She struck mercilessly, unleashing her mental powers at maximum intensity, ignoring the toll it took on her, solely focused on exterminating these zombies.

Despite her racing heartbeat, she remained calm, scanning the crowd for the hooded zombie. Oddly enough, she couldn't find it. Activating her enhanced mental powers, an upgrade from her previous abilities, she could see the unique colors of all living beings below. The living beings were outlined in a faint red hue, while the different ability users' cores shimmered with faint glows of their respective attributes.

In stark contrast, the zombies were merely shadowy figures with pale gray outlines, almost indistinguishable. As her eyes roamed through a kaleidoscope of colors, she realized she didn’t know what color the mental-type cores were; she had never seen Pei Qian’s. Thus, she needed to sift through the vibrant chaos to find the most unique and rare one.

After a careful search, her eyes remained fixed, her mental energy depleting rapidly. Her hand rested on her core bag, absorbing energy while she maintained a focused and calm demeanor. About three minutes later, she found it: in the northwest corner, behind a few tall zombies, the hooded zombie’s decayed face and dark, hollow eyes peered at her through a gap. Strangely, it hadn’t launched an attack against her.

Upon closer inspection, she realized it was out of range for its abilities—interesting. Was this ugly creature afraid of her, or was it planning something?

Lo Bingting observed its provocative expression, a sinister smile that was painfully glaring.

In the next moment, the zombie clutched its head, letting out a pained shriek that sent the entire battlefield into chaos. The controlled zombies hesitated, some realizing that their abilities were inferior. Terrified, they attempted to retreat, and Meng Ge and the others seized the opportunity to strike.

A torrent of furious attacks rained down as Lo Bingting stood on the tower, laughing at the hooded zombie. 

Five hundred meters was merely the limit of her mental abilities, not her own attack range.

She contemplated invading the zombie's mind further but hesitated at the thought of shattering its core. Seeing its agonized expression, she called out to Meng Ge to help her capture the hooded zombie.

Upon hearing her directions, Meng Ge charged forward, but unfortunately, the hooded zombie, aware of its disadvantage, abandoned the battlefield and fled.

Once again, she had narrowly missed capturing a fourth-tier mental core, and her mood took a hit.

Using her Flying Tiger Claws, she descended to the ground. The once formidable zombies now resembled defeated dogs, with only a few remaining to stubbornly resist, quickly meeting their demise.

This was the advantage of having a significant gap in strength; it wasn't merely a crushing victory, but definitely enough to wipe out the majority of them. The faster zombies had fled, leaving only a handful to be eliminated.

Nobody expected there would still be more to salvage. Those who hadn’t had their fill of slaughter took the chance to indulge themselves, eagerly hoping to encounter a brain that could yield a fourth-tier core.

By the time they had cleared the last of the zombies, reinforcements finally arrived at the lookout. The gates slowly opened, and as Lo Bingting turned around, she saw Zhu Xiaoshu driving out with several members of the guard team. There was no sign of Xie Jinghang or Zhu Yidan; they must have been taken to the infirmary for treatment.

After efficiently dispatching the final zombie, Lo Bingting drew her dagger and joined Meng Ge and the others in extracting cores from the fallen zombies. Zhu Xiaoshu got out of the car and stood beside her, reporting on the recent events at the fortress. After listening, Lo Bingting frowned. She left An Min and the others to continue extracting cores and instructed Meng Ge and some of the ability users to drive a truck to the mountain road to collect zombie bodies for fuel.

She then climbed into the car driven by Zhu Xiaoshu. As soon as she settled in, she asked, “Have you found out where the zombies came from?”

“Yes, they came from the hydropower station's machine room. Someone opened the iron grate above the propeller maintenance hatch. There’s a one-meter by seventy-five-centimeter opening connecting to the river, and they entered through there.”

“You mean they submerged themselves in water, risking having their heads chopped off by the propeller, just to crawl in?”

“Yes, and the hydropower station's propellers have been continuously running.”

“Were there any obvious external injuries on the zombies?”

“Yes, two of the zombie corpses had clear propeller-cut wounds.”

Lo Bingting nodded as they drove to the hydropower station's machine room. The administrator who had been bitten was already injected with an antidote and taken to the infirmary, placed in a separate room for isolation.

Only one member of the patrol team remained outside the machine room, waiting for her to recount what had happened. For Lo Bingting, the whole situation was a bit perplexing. The awakening of the zombies was a recent discovery, and previously intelligent zombies followed their instincts, avoiding danger or fleeing when they couldn’t win. This time, however, they had clearly planned a tactical infiltration and ambush.

Her intuition suggested that it was Bai Buqi who had orchestrated this through his sinister system, but the specifics of how this occurred remained unexplainable.

If this continued, sealing off the hydropower station would be just a matter of time.

Upon further observation, she found it wasn’t entirely inevitable. The opening at the hydropower station was a designated maintenance hatch that wouldn’t be opened casually unless there was a malfunction. During normal times, it could be sealed off, and even if it was filled with zombies when reopened, they would be prepared and wouldn’t be caught off guard.

After considering this solution, everyone agreed, and Zhu Xiaoshu immediately arranged for earth-type ability users to seal the maintenance hatch.

Dr. Zhang from the laboratory also sent someone to update her on the status of the antidote. Lo Bingting learned that quite a few people had been bitten by zombies and were currently in isolation, prompting her to hurry to the laboratory.

Xiao Lu opened the door for her, and as Lo Bingting entered, she saw Dr. Zhang peering into a microscope, while a female researcher assisted with documentation.

Lo Bingting didn’t want to disturb them. After a while, Dr. Zhang finished his work, removed his glasses, pinched the bridge of his nose, and turned to her, saying, “I’m aware of the zombie attack in the fortress today. I took some tissue samples from the injured patients for research. Normally, the antidote should effectively address the mutated zombies, but I’m uncertain about the impact on abilities. I have an idea: combining the antidote with the ability awakening potion could maximize the chances of preserving the cores and abilities during the detoxification process, but it will take time to test.”

Lo Bingting nodded, agreeing with this research direction. Suddenly, she remembered Wu Xiaogang, the peculiar ability user she had brought into her space along with the car. She needed to send him for research immediately. After exchanging a few words, she took her leave.
