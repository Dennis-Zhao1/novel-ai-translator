The Truth

Xie Jinghang yanked Fu Buqi’s collar, dragging him down to the screen like a ragged dog. He forced Fu’s gaze onto the flickering images displayed, shouting furiously, "You have truly lost all sense of humanity! You've devastated all of mankind! Look at the destruction you've caused—people are homeless, innocent lives are lost for nothing! And what are you left with? Just a pathetic joke!"

Fu Buqi struggled to move, his limbs feeling heavy, yet his eyes remained fixed on the screen. Some of the chaos had been orchestrated by him, but not all. Luo Bingtian watched as Fu Buqi, in pursuit of a baseless dream, unleashed a zombie virus that nearly wiped out humanity. To seize control of the Kunshan base, he had sacrificed his wife and father-in-law. He had repeatedly released zombies for his so-called fortune, breeding them and coercing biologists to create one mutated insect and plant after another.

Yet, he was nothing but a complete fool, bound to a system that didn’t aim to help him succeed but instead used him to absorb all the fortunes of this world. The ultimate goal was to turn all of humanity into zombies, all living beings into mere vessels for generating crystal cores, to be harvested and discarded in one fell swoop. It seemed that Blue Star wouldn’t be the first nor the last.

The Noisy Ghost was also unusually enraged, as if it were attacking that doomsday system.

"Fu Buqi, open your eyes! If this were before the apocalypse, reliant on your wife and father-in-law, you would've struggled for at least two decades less. In the end, regardless of power, status, reputation, or wealth, you'd have something. Given your family's business situation back then, it wouldn't be that bad. And now? It’s the apocalypse! What do you have, besides this deceptive system that treats you as a tool? You've lost your home, your son is dead, and you're left as a shadow of a person, dreaming of becoming the king of the world? With everyone dead, who are you supposed to rule? The King of Hell?"

Luo Bingtian reflected on Fu Buqi's past actions, struggling to understand why he had made such choices. Now she realized he was not only foolish but naive, believing he could rise above everyone else, forgetting that if the system possessed such great power, it wouldn’t need to bind him.

“Take a good look at the sins you’ve committed before you die. You don’t deserve a peaceful end.”

With this parting remark, Luo Bingtian signaled for Xie Jinghang to secure Fu Buqi, stuffing a thick wooden plug into his mouth to prevent him from biting his tongue in despair. There were many who wished to take revenge on Fu Buqi, and she didn't want him to die so easily.

“Xuanjing, we’re heading out now. Brother Meng and the others are still waiting for us outside.”

After exchanging pleasantries, Luo Bingtian took hold of Xie Jinghang’s arm while he dragged Fu Buqi behind him, the three of them appearing in the aerial garden where they had previously stood.

At this point, the wind had scattered the gray remnants of the mutated plants and insects on the ground, leaving the garden desolate with only patches of bare soil visible.

“Miss, Brother Xie, are you all okay?” 

Brother Meng hurried toward them, visibly relieved once he confirmed that Luo Bingtian was unharmed.

“Brother Meng, how are you holding up? Your poisoning seems serious; you shouldn’t be moving around so vigorously,” she remarked with concern.

“I’m fine. Just a moment ago, the mutated plants and insects attacking us suddenly turned to ash. I thought I was dreaming.”

“Miss Luo, Luo Luo!” 

The others who followed Brother Meng all called out to her, their faces as pale as his, indicating they had endured their own share of suffering.

“Miss, have you seen the others?” Brother Meng suddenly inquired, making Luo Bingtian pause.

“They're all fine, in a safe place. Once we go down, we’ll see them,” she replied, choosing not to mention that they were all inside her space. Cramming so many people into her space felt a bit exaggerated, and she didn’t want to explain it all.

“Prepare yourselves. There’s nothing extra in here, so we’ll get ready to return to the fortress. And this is the biggest sinner of the apocalypse, Fu Buqi. Keep an eye on him; don’t let him die easily.”

Brother Meng nodded, taking the rope-bound Fu Buqi from Xie Jinghang and splitting off with An Min and the others to clear out the remaining zombies and other dangers lurking in the area.

“Host, tell the little fairy that there’s a big surprise waiting for her,” Xie Jinghang called out to Luo Bingtian, but the Noisy Ghost refused to elaborate, leaving both of them in suspense. Moments later, Luo Bingtian felt her body begin to glow, but there was no discomfort—just a sense of the extraordinary. A tall figure clad in a moon-white long robe, with flowing dark hair, appeared before them.

Xie Jinghang felt overwhelmed by the Noisy Ghost’s ecstatic screams, nearly causing his ears to ring. 

“Ah! Ah! Ah! Xuanjing has materialized! He absorbed the energy from that destructive system! Wow, isn't that super cool? Awsl!”

“Shut up; you’re too loud!” 

Xie Jinghang could no longer tolerate it and disabled the Noisy Ghost's voice function, plunging the world back into silence.

Luo Bingtian gazed at the figure before her, gradually solidifying from a thin silhouette to a tangible presence, her shock rendering her speechless.

“Xuan... Xuanjing?”

Seeing Luo Bingtian’s astonished expression, Xie Jinghang felt a pang of jealousy, questioning why he had been staring for so long. Was Xuanjing really that captivating? He admitted that Xuanjing had a striking appearance that could rival his own. But didn’t Luo Bingtian disregard her own looks? Surely she wouldn’t think much of Xuanjing either. Yet the reality contradicted his assumptions, stirring frustration within him.

“Luo Bingtian, hello there.”

Xuanjing’s long hair and flowing sleeves danced with the wind, embodying an ethereal grace.

“Y-you… hello?” 

Luo Bingtian stuttered, unsure how to respond, when suddenly a thought struck her. 

“I’ve seen your portrait somewhere before. Could it be that you’re an ancestor of the Luo family?”

Perhaps influenced by her past life’s dramas, she imagined a scene where her ancestor manifested to bless her descendants.

“I remember now; there’s a painting of you in our ancient texts.”

Xuanjing smiled and nodded. 

“I’ve completed my task. Having absorbed enough energy, I can return to my rightful time. I’m here to say goodbye.”

“You’re leaving? Where to?” 

“To go home.”

Xuanjing didn’t elaborate further, and Luo Bingtian felt a pang of disappointment as she nodded slowly. Memories flooded back to when she first discovered the space and began communicating with Xuanjing, gradually growing familiar with him, appreciating his help as he accompanied her through her growth up to this point.

“Then… will we have the chance to meet again?”

Luo Bingtian wasn’t one to relish farewells. While she seemed surrounded by many, few truly held a place in her heart. Although Xuanjing hadn’t been a person in the traditional sense, he meant a lot to her.

“We will, there will be opportunities to meet again.”

Xuanjing maintained his gentle smile, a complex yet serene expression in his eyes, looking at her as if she were both a friend and a younger sibling.

Feeling the warmth of that affectionate gaze, Xie Jinghang’s jealousy subsided, replaced by a surge of strength and courage. He stepped forward, taking Luo Bingtian’s hand in his own.
