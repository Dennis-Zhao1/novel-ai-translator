**Encounter with the Zombie Horde**

Just as they were returning from a major commercial district in the East Zone after a four-day mission, the team had successfully collected not only crystal cores but also a variety of supplies. The group, consisting of twenty superpowered individuals, was split across six vehicles. Luo Bingtin sat in the passenger seat of the lead car, engrossed in studying the map for the next mission location.

This group was a mix of her own squad and some of the more capable superpowered individuals selected by Brother Meng. The quality of the crystal cores they had gathered had significantly improved, and the proportion of mutated cores had also increased.

As they drove onto the ring highway, something felt off. Brother Meng, who was driving the lead vehicle, muttered, “What’s going on? Is that a zombie army gathering for a meeting?”

Luo Bingtin paused her calculations, following Brother Meng's gaze. To her shock, a massive tide of zombies was rushing down the mountain and onto the highway, heading straight for their convoy.

Despite having mentally prepared for a potential crisis and even considering the possibility of encountering a zombie tide, she never expected it to happen at this particular moment or place. 

Without hesitation, she grabbed the radio and ordered all vehicles to accelerate to maximum speed, urging them to quickly return to their stronghold. If they could shake the zombies off, that would be ideal; if not, they would have to confront them head-on. The stronghold's armed unit and superpowered individuals were more than capable of putting up a fight.

The vehicles in the rear also noticed the approaching horde. Aside from those focusing intently on driving, the other superpowered individuals began to engage the enemy whenever they could.

Luo Bingtin threw open the sunroof, standing up to secure her machine gun in place, disregarding the vulnerability of exposing their position. She started firing indiscriminately into the crowd of zombies.

She noticed that many wind-type zombies had managed to climb onto the last vehicle, which carried Xie Jinghang and his squad. As a level four lightning-type superpowered individual, Xie Jinghang could usually take down zombies with a single strike. However, the sheer number of zombies was overwhelming. Using an electrical net consumed too much energy, and pinpoint strikes weren't effective enough. Luo Bingtin’s machine gun provided a critical moment of respite for them, allowing her teammates to absorb crystal cores to replenish their powers.

Thanks to Luo Bingtin's quick thinking, the convoy gained some precious time. Watching the relentless horde chasing them, she felt as if they were specifically targeting her. Pushing aside her worries, she informed everyone over the intercom to quickly regain their strength; a fierce battle awaited them back at the stronghold.

At that moment, Xie Jinghang was feeling the toll of his powers. After consuming a bag of crystal cores, he finally started to feel some relief. His vice-captain looked pale, having exerted himself completely. He had constructed several earth walls to block the zombies and created a mobile shield to protect the team leader from being pounced on or scratched by the undead. His support was invaluable.

Gratefully, they had collected a good number of supplies during this mission. Luo Bingtin only kept what was necessary to turn in, distributing the remaining crystal cores among the team members. Without sufficient supplies, recovery would be a significant challenge.

Superpowered individuals were especially vulnerable when exhausted; they were weaker than ordinary people at that point, and if they didn't recover immediately, it could hinder their future upgrades. A superpowered individual who couldn’t upgrade would ultimately be eliminated.

After exiting the ring highway, they took the mountain road, which forced them to slow down. The sharp curves made it easy to flip the vehicle or crash into the mountainside. Luo Bingtin warned everyone to brace themselves; the zombies could catch up at any moment.

Sure enough, it wasn’t long before the rearview mirror showed the horde closing in. Luo Bingtin hoisted a rocket launcher and fired several rounds into the crowd, hoping to take out as many as possible. It didn’t matter if the mountain road was damaged; survival was the priority.

Xie Jinghang and his team continued their assault. The penultimate vehicle contained the Zheng father-son duo and some rookie superpowered individuals, who were helping Xie Jinghang. An Min, one of the newer recruits, was using wind blades to slice through zombies, showing a reckless disregard for others’ safety.

When a zombie’s brain matter splattered over his arm, Xie Jinghang’s expression froze. He had every reason to suspect that this little brat An Min had a personal vendetta against him. Was this revenge?

Brother Meng did his best to drive fast but steady along the mountain road. When it came to sharp turns, Luo Bingtin couldn't use her weapons; she lost her line of sight and had to deal with obstacles from the rocks.

She could only hope that Xie Jinghang and the others could hold their ground. If they were lucky, they would quickly return to the stronghold. They couldn't afford to lose anyone; these were all elite superpowered individuals, investments of her resources, and the culmination of Brother Meng and Xie Jinghang's efforts. Not a single one could be sacrificed.

Thinking quickly, Luo Bingtin pulled out a large barrel of gasoline from her spatial storage and began to pour it on the ground as they drove, leaving a trail behind them.

Once she saw the last vehicle pass through the gasoline trail, she fired another rocket, igniting the zombies as the explosion set the gasoline ablaze. The zombies, undeterred by the flames, rushed forward, their bodies igniting as they continued their pursuit.

It was absurd—these creatures felt no pain and feared nothing. The only solution was to blow their brains out.

This series of actions proved effective; several zombies with burned legs fell over, desperately crawling forward. Xie Jinghang and his team gained a moment of respite, and the stronghold's gates were now within sight.

Currently, the lookout was in the hands of Zhu Yidan, who was thrilled to see the convoy returning. However, before she could smile, her expression shifted dramatically as she ordered the gates to open. As soon as the gates were ajar, Brother Meng maneuvered the vehicle in with a swift, narrow escape, parking beside the lookout area.

The next five vehicles followed suit. By the time Xie Jinghang's vehicle entered, the zombies were already at the gates, forcing them to shut quickly. A few managed to squeeze through the gap, but Xie Jinghang and his team quickly dispatched them.

That was close! An Min patted his rapidly beating heart, thinking this was far more thrilling than any survival game. Watching everyone rush up to the battlements, he hurried to follow.

Zhu Yidan sounded the alarm, the blaring sirens echoing across the stronghold. Zhu Xiaoshu and others quickly sprang into action, heading to the laboratory to gather all researchers and secure all materials.

The security team, selected from both superpowered individuals and ordinary citizens, rushed to the lookout tower while Liu Xiaohui organized the civilians to take shelter in the bomb shelter.

Aunt Li angrily tossed aside her half-kneaded dough, ripped off her apron, and moved along with the crowd, grumbling, “Great, now we can’t even make dumplings; I haven’t even finished kneading the dough!”

The old butler chuckled, “Don’t worry, Aunt Li. Perhaps things will settle down soon, and you can continue kneading.”

Despite their age, the two moved quickly, their pace steady, unlike the panicked ordinary people around them. They seemed calm, even joking with each other as they moved.

After Liu Xiaohui made sure everyone was accounted for, she closed the bomb shelter door and sat quietly beside it, lost in thought.

Meanwhile, Luo Bingtin rushed to the weapons cache, opening the armory door. While the black box containing her weapons was safely in her spatial storage, the firearms remained in the armory. She had since restocked it with more powerful machine guns and mobile artillery.

Shoulder-mounted rocket launchers were also prepared for the selected guards from the ordinary citizens. Though they lacked superpowers, they were all physically fit individuals chosen for their stamina and had undergone training with Xie Jinghang and Brother Meng. They would be ready for battle.

This selection process also provided ordinary people with an opportunity to enhance their survival skills, improve their living conditions, and restore their confidence in life. Even without superpowers, they could still survive; it wasn't just the superpowered individuals who could endure.

This was one of the reasons why the stronghold was so formidable.
