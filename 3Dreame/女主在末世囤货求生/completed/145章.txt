**The Reluctant Team Leader**

As Xie Jinghang shut down the system screen, he noticed Luo Bingtin resting her chin on one hand, her gaze fixed on him. As soon as he met her eyes, she leaned forward, curiosity shining in her expression.

"What's up? Did you find something good? How many points do we need?" 

Xie Jinghang couldn't help but smile at her adorable demeanor, but the thought of humanity's extinction crashed over him like a cold wave. His heart raced, yet his resolve only grew stronger.

"Yeah, there are some good items, but they come with a high point requirement, and there’s a task prerequisite. Just having points won’t be enough to redeem them," he replied.

Luo Bingtin nodded knowingly. She understood that nothing came for free in this world. To obtain what she needed for her space upgrade, she had to source items rich in spiritual energy, and the system’s upgrade had come just in time.

"What if we find mutated plants or seeds? Can we exchange those for points?" she inquired.

"That’s not in the task, but the Noisy Spirit mentioned that seeds contain substances and energies they like, so they should be redeemable," he explained.

"Is there an exchange rate? Let our little white lotus negotiate. Just like the ancient tale of borrowing arrows with straw boats, we’ll have our white lotus borrow seeds," Luo Bingtin said, only realizing how silly she sounded after the words left her mouth. She cleared her throat, annoyed at her own impulsiveness.

Xie Jinghang burst out laughing. Luo Bingtin shot him a shy, annoyed look, biting her lip. What was so funny about that?

He reached up to ruffle her hair, but she swatted his hand away. "What are you doing? Just talk, don’t get handsy!"

Suppressing his laughter, he nodded, "Then let’s have the deputy work harder to secure our little white lotus sooner."

Luo Bingtin rolled her eyes at him, dismissing the topic. 

"Host, I'm back. There’s no record of this task in the mainframe data, so it seems there's a genuine bug," the Noisy Spirit chimed in.

"I’ve already reported the error; we can ignore it," he replied.

The Noisy Spirit assured him not to get too worked up, claiming their dominance in the system was a positive energy endeavor.

Xie Jinghang felt skeptical. He had never fully trusted the system, and this only solidified his resolve to leverage it for mutual gain. He'd rather avoid tasks than become a puppet of the system, fearing he might lose his autonomy.

He kept his thoughts to himself. The Noisy Spirit, sensing that he was calmed, returned to its silly antics, oblivious to the fact that the system tasks needed fixing, leaving everything in disarray.

"Do you think she'll bite?" Luo Bingtin pondered aloud. She had a decent grasp of the little white lotus’s character; from their first meeting, it was clear she had lofty ambitions and an affinity for powerful men, steeped in vanity and rivalry.

"It doesn’t matter if she does or not. What’s important is for her to feel like she has the upper hand. For her, the deputy is a great entry point," Xie Jinghang explained.

"Alright, then let’s put in the effort to wrap this up quickly," she replied.

"The deputy knows women better than I do; he’ll definitely handle this better than I would," he remarked.

"Feeling insecure?" she teased.

"Of course! I mean, how can I lack confidence when I don’t even have a title?" 

Xie Jinghang's gaze turned serious, making her feel uncomfortable. Why did the conversation drift into such strange territory?

"Maybe it’s time for bed. I’ll head back," she said, clearly overwhelmed, practically fleeing the scene.

Xie Jinghang stood to see her off, his tall figure creating an intimidating presence that hadn’t been there before. 

Feeling his gaze on her, she shivered. He reached out, gripping her wrist. "Are you cold? You’re shaking."

Luo Bingtin sensed the underlying tension. What had happened during his absence? Had he been possessed?

As she realized his shadow loomed over her, she took a step back, leaning against the door, trying to push him away. But when her hand brushed against his chest, the heat radiating from him startled her, causing her to retract her hand.

She hated how flustered she felt. Steeling herself, she said, "Please maintain a normal social distance. You're a bit too close for comfort."

With a sigh, Xie Jinghang took a half step back, creating a more comfortable space between them.

Finally able to breathe normally, Luo Bingtin hurriedly opened the door. Xie Jinghang stood silently in the doorway, eyes downcast, an air of disappointment surrounding him.

Once back in her room, she felt an inexplicable irritation. What was bothering her? She understood Xie Jinghang’s feelings, but she found herself unable to respond. With a forced smile, she thought, what a hassle...

In the middle of the night, a shadowy figure appeared again. The deputy glanced up at the sky, rubbing his eyes. Did this woman never feel tired?

Her dark circles were so pronounced that they couldn't be hidden, and she clung to him during the day while still being awake at night. He couldn’t fathom where she drew her energy from. 

Yawning silently, he noticed the little white lotus still hadn’t returned. Climbing out the window, he quietly circled around to the other side where she had buried the seeds, overhearing her muttering to herself.

"Ugh, why haven’t they sprouted yet? Didn’t they say plants would grow the next day after being planted? What if they’re bad seeds?" 

After digging up the seeds she had buried, she examined the four seeds closely. In her initial panic, she hadn’t paid attention to them, and now, they looked like nothing special.

At first, he was worried she might discover him, but she was completely oblivious to his presence. With a resigned attitude, she buried the seeds again, obviously coming back to check on their progress.

It was laughable; she didn’t even water them. What kind of ordinary seeds could sprout under those conditions?

"If they don’t sprout soon, we’ll run out of time. No way, I need to ask them for more tomorrow. Four seeds are far too risky!"

Though her voice was low, it was clear in the stillness of the night. The deputy couldn’t help but grimace at her foolishness. With such a clumsy ally, the task difficulty had dramatically decreased. 

Watching the little white lotus sneak back inside, he felt a surge of frustration as dawn approached. He wouldn’t get much sleep before training began; this was more exhausting than being out on a mission.

Xie Jinghang seemed to notice the deputy’s woeful expression. “Looks like your masculine charm is working wonders. You really know how to navigate the waters between men and women. Otherwise, I could let Xiao Wang take the lead.”

The deputy perked up immediately. So the captain was complimenting his charm and emotional intelligence! In terms of looks, the ranking in the team was clear: the captain first, Xiao Wang second, and he was probably third. Receiving official recognition felt amazing.

Filled with newfound enthusiasm, he assured Xie Jinghang that he would complete the task.

Watching the deputy bounce away, Xie Jinghang suddenly realized Luo Bingtin’s concerns weren’t unfounded. 

Borrowing seeds was indeed a brilliant tactic. It seemed she had a knack for these things; perhaps she was a hidden prophet...

Handing off the most troublesome task to the deputy felt like a weight lifted off his shoulders. He might have been more effective himself, but thinking about his grim future made him resolve to tread carefully. He didn’t want to be criticized for being improper or unsanitary.

In truth, he had regretted his earlier decisions. There had been so many other reasons and excuses he could have used, yet he had insisted on dragging relationships into the matter. Now, he was left in a difficult position, facing the ridicule of the Noisy Spirit, which didn’t even count as a man!
