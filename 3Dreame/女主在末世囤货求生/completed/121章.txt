**Breaking Up**

After exchanging glances with Xie Jinghang, the unspoken understanding between him and Brother Meng was clear. An Min, along with the team members and Uncle Zhu, quickly stepped in to mediate the escalating argument. Zhu Yidan, witnessing the sudden outburst, fiercely defended Xie Jinghang, countering anyone who dared to challenge him, which left Uncle Zhu feeling overwhelmed.

On the other hand, Luo Bingtong seemed to be reveling in the chaos, her sharp and cutting remarks contrasting starkly with her calm demeanor. It was as if the argument had triggered a split in her personality.

Everyone was left bewildered; the situation had spiraled out of control. Those who should have persuaded others to calm down rushed to intervene.

Outside the door, the noise escalated from muffled voices to a full-blown shouting match, with the sounds of physical scuffles breaking out. Just as someone leaned in to catch the details, Xie Jinghang burst through the door, his voice booming as he chastised everyone.

“The awakening plan for our abilities should strictly filter volunteers in private. They must be physically capable and loyal to the fortress. Announcing it without any prerequisites is foolish and shows blatant disregard for us, the awakened. We are chosen by heaven for a reason, and such actions are an insult to us natural abilities!”

With that, he slammed the door shut with great force. Moments later, Zhu Yidan pushed the door open, shouting, “I’m incredibly disappointed in all of you!”

Following closely behind were the team members, their expressions dark as they trailed Xie Jinghang and Zhu Yidan. The door slammed again, leaving Uncle Zhu and An Min in a state of panic as they chased after them, calling out, “Captain Xie, don’t be angry! It’s not that serious! There’s been a misunderstanding. Zhu Yidan, stop fanning the flames! Get Captain Xie to come back!”

It was then that they saw Brother Meng’s face dark as thunder as he opened the meeting room door. Luo Bingtong emerged from her office, her arms crossed and an expression of indifference plastered on her face. It was clear that the conflict had escalated significantly, with no one directly stating the intention to oust Captain Xie and his team from the fortress. Whispers began to spread through the fortress during the night, suggesting Luo Bingtong was going to break up with Captain Xie, leading to speculation about a love triangle and infidelity, even hinting they should leave by tomorrow.

“Let them go! Just don’t regret it later!” 

As if to confirm the rumors circulating within the fortress, the next morning, in the fortress square, Luo Bingtong and Xie Jinghang’s group erupted into another argument, this time escalating to the core issue that no one wanted to confront—the inherent hierarchy between awakened individuals and ordinary people.

In the post-apocalyptic world, most awakened individuals carried a sense of superiority. While the fortress had appeared peaceful, this sense of superiority had never been openly expressed. After all, they were the ones risking their lives to fend off zombies and protect the fortress, while also gathering resources and crystal nuclei on missions.

If everyone became awakened, some might feel their advantages dissolved, especially if the efficacy of the awakening potion was deemed better than natural awakening. How could those who were ordinary feel balanced in such a scenario? 

It was akin to the difference in beauty between someone who was naturally beautiful and someone who had undergone plastic surgery. The naturally beautiful often harbored a sense of superiority, resentful of those who had artificially enhanced their looks.

In any group, conflicts arise. Even in a fortress that espoused equality and fairness, every individual harbored their own thoughts, scheming for their trivial interests.

Luo Bingtong observed this undercurrent of desire for awakening. She didn’t oppose self-interest; rather, she found it reasonable. In this world, anyone who didn’t think of themselves was a fool.

She scrutinized those who were desperate to awaken their abilities, keen to identify the potential traitors among them. To her surprise, the first person to vehemently attack Xie Jinghang with words was Zhu Si, the unfortunate father whose son had been killed by a traitor from the Zhu family. Luo Bingtong understood his yearning for power and revenge—it mirrored her own feelings from the past.

Convinced that Zhu Si wouldn’t become a spy for Fu Buqi, she noted that he had seized the interrogation scroll that day, uncovering the entire conspiracy and realizing that Fu Buqi was behind it all. His hatred was so fierce that it would be impossible for him to collaborate.

She crossed Zhu Si’s name off the suspect list and added it to the awakening plan, thinking, “Zhu Si, don’t let me down.”

The expressions of others were more varied. Luo Bingtong had already coordinated with Uncle Zhu and Liu Xiaohui. After collecting the registration list, she kept a close watch on those who were overly eager and stirring up trouble behind the scenes.

She prepared everyone for a day of unrest, knowing that the fortress wouldn’t calm down until the first batch of injection lists was announced.

Xie Jinghang’s team made a grand exit from the fortress, and unexpectedly, Zhu Yidan also declared her departure, insisting on following Xie Jinghang, even abandoning her family. The group made a dramatic departure, leaving Uncle Zhu unable to stop them.

Luo Bingtong, feeling her acting skills were lacking, wore a sorrowful expression, turning away to wipe away what seemed like tears, eliciting sympathy from the onlookers. Then, as if regaining her composure, she rallied all awakened individuals, reorganized the patrols, and filled the positions previously held by Xie Jinghang and his team.

Brother Meng and An Min remained dejected, clearly affected by the upheaval. On the contrary, the other awakened individuals hid their glee, thinking, “Good riddance! The dissenters are gone, and soon we will have our abilities.” They all assumed that Xie Jinghang had chosen Zhu Yidan over Luo Bingtong, and now they could seize Xie Jinghang’s former position, ensuring they would be favored by Luo Bingtong in the future, thus acquiring more crystal nuclei and resources.

Luo Bingtong noted these subtle movements, keeping them in mind. She had always been a generous boss, never rejecting ambitious and eager employees, provided they were loyal and obedient.

After dismissing the crowd gathered in the square, Brother Meng and An Min accompanied Luo Bingtong back to her office. Both were still dazed from the series of events, their expressions a mix of confusion and disbelief, as they struggled to comprehend the unfolding situation.

Luo Bingtong pulled out three bottles of soda from her space, adding ice before handing them to the two. Once her spiritual perception confirmed no one was outside, she relaxed and spoke, “What are you so tense about? It’s all just a show. There are traitors in the fortress, and we need to stir things up to flush them out.”

An Min finally let out a large sigh of relief, saying with a carefree attitude, “I thought you and Brother Xie were having relationship problems and creating such a ruckus!”

Before he could finish, Brother Meng slapped the back of his head, “Can’t you think before you speak? If you don’t have anything useful to say, just keep quiet. You’re always the one running your mouth.”

Luo Bingtong laughed at this, “What relationship problems? There’s nothing of the sort.”

“Then was Miss Zhu just putting on an act? I doubt that,” An Min boldly chimed in, completely ignoring Brother Meng’s warning glare.

Luo Bingtong took a sip of her cold soda, savoring it before burping comfortably. In truth, Xie Jinghang had visited her the night before, but they hadn’t discussed anything outside the plan. Before leaving, he had given her something that caught her completely off guard.

Seeing their surprised expressions, she could sense their curiosity rising as they pressed her, “Isn’t it a love triangle?”

“It’s more like Brother Xie is playing both sides,” she replied.

“Maybe a love triangle is more fitting—Brother Xie likes our Miss, and Miss Zhu likes Brother Xie,” An Min suggested.

“That shouldn’t be the case. They were hugging each other yesterday. I heard Miss Zhu confessed her feelings to Brother Xie!” 

“I didn’t hear about this. You must be making it up, or perhaps the girl has a hidden crush? It’s too well concealed,” Brother Meng interjected.

Luo Bingtong smirked internally at their gossiping. A hidden crush? That was completely contrary to Zhu Yidan’s personality. Before the apocalypse, Zhu Yidan would have boldly declared her feelings for anyone she liked, catching everyone off guard with her straightforwardness. But now, post-apocalypse, she was supposedly harboring a secret crush? That was highly unusual.

Having known Zhu Yidan for so many years, it was impossible not to notice this inconsistency. A mischievous thought crossed her mind, and she slowly remarked, “You guys should stop speculating. It’s just that they’re both pursuing each other, and it has nothing to do with me. I have no intention of getting involved in their romantic affairs. Besides, aren’t there more pressing matters at hand?”

Brother Meng and An Min immediately fell silent, sipping their sodas, while internally they thought, “Right, like one day you won’t be the one softening up.”
