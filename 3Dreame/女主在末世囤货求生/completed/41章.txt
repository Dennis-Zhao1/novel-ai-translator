**The Premature Apocalypse**

Everything was proceeding according to plan. The construction of the Apocalypse Fortress was in full swing, working day and night. Now, it was nearing completion, with only the installation of barbed wire in the weak areas on the perimeter left to do. According to the ideas of Ice Luo, it would be best to dig a trench about ten meters wide as an additional precaution.

In her previous life, the Kunshan base had employed this method to fend off zombies. However, given the mountainous terrain, it was impossible to bring in excavators, so they had to abandon that idea for now.

The geographic location of the Apocalypse Fortress was excellent, and it wouldn’t face large-scale zombie hordes, making it significantly safer than urban areas—by dozens of times.

Families were notified that they could move in at any time. Ice Luo gathered the house staff and the Zheng family for a meeting. The staff would simply follow her instructions, and the Zheng family wouldn't ask too many questions.

Ice Luo had already instructed the butler to organize the belongings in the old house and securely store them in the underground storage room. Each person was only allowed to bring a change of clothes, identification, and essential items, all fitting within a 24-inch suitcase.

While everyone was busy packing in their respective rooms, Ice Luo turned and entered the storage room, summoning the items from the old house into her space for safekeeping. The house was too eye-catching for now, but she planned to find a way to take it with her later. It represented her last memories of her grandfather and parents, and it was a place she held dear in her heart.

When the bus arranged by Uncle Zhu arrived to pick them up, the Luo family was already lined up orderly to board. Ice Luo didn't join them; instead, she instructed the butler to take good care of the old Mr. Zheng and the others, ensuring they settled in at the Apocalypse Fortress and waited for her to join them.

The butler nodded with concern, reminding Meng to look after Miss Luo, before reluctantly boarding the bus.

Ice Luo disliked such farewell scenes and silently watched as the bus drove away, before taking Meng in her car to leave.

Staying at the old house was not conducive to gathering outside information. With no need to return to the Yunding area, she headed directly to the company. There were only two days left before the holiday, and as the boss, it was reasonable for her to inspect the work.

This would also signal to the outside world that she had returned to the country and that everything was normal.

By the time she reached the company, it was close to lunchtime. Recently, everyone had been particularly motivated at work, eager to wrap up their tasks before the holiday. They were all focused and working swiftly, pushing projects forward and completing tasks.

Ice Luo had planned to treat everyone to lunch, but to her surprise, no one was available to chat. Even her assistant, who usually clung to her side, was inundated with phone calls and meetings.

Today was the last half-day of work, and Ice Luo expected to see everyone racing to finish up and leisurely winding down. 

Whether she felt relieved or disheartened, seeing the scene before her made her wish that they could relax a little more, take it easy; it would lighten her heart.

Thinking about the future left her feeling powerless. Even if she spoke up, how many would believe her? The few who would believe her did so not because of her but because of her ancestors.

Fortunately, around three in the afternoon, after the assistant reported the last task, his eyes sparkled with excitement as he congratulated Ice Luo. His words were sweetened like honey. Ice Luo chuckled and sent out a bunch of red envelopes in the employee group chat. After a lively scramble for the envelopes, she waved her hand and announced an early dismissal.

As everyone left, they rushed to congratulate their boss and express their gratitude. Ice Luo could only tell them to hurry back and reunite with their families, and to avoid being out too much since the 520 holiday was coming up—everyone should spend time with their loved ones.

Once the entire building was empty, Ice Luo, along with Meng, found a hotel to check into. This move left those secretly monitoring her utterly puzzled, assuming she had simply gotten used to staying in hotels and had stopped returning home.

Mr. Zhu was still in the hospital, having been there for so long that he was genuinely exhausted from the charade. That evening, Ice Luo boldly visited him at the hospital, marking another entanglement with the Zhu family since the stock incident.

The outside world became even more confused. Fortunately, some key players had already become shareholders in the Mingzhu Group. They believed everyone was in the same boat, and their perceptions of the Zhu family shifted with their roles and attitudes.

It was only natural for a young person to return home to visit their elders after being away for so long, especially since Mr. Zhu hadn’t collapsed because of her.

In secret, Ice Luo had prepared an armored vehicle and discreetly handed it over to Meng, instructing him to hide it until she called for it.

Ice Luo appeared to be staying at the hospital, not leaving until late into the night. Meanwhile, the Zhu family was already falling apart, and the information leaking out was ludicrous. Even the shrewdest among them couldn’t grasp the deeper implications.

But this was precisely what Ice Luo and Mr. Zhu wanted.

They didn’t want to hide in the Apocalypse Fortress early; they needed people to believe they were being forced into it, not that they had been plotting for a long time.

To create a smokescreen for the fortress, significant money was spent on advertising for the Apocalypse Paradise, attracting genuine interest from potential investors.

Uncle Zhu worried that excessive heat might cause unnecessary trouble, so he painstakingly turned it into a project that would fool people into investing, ultimately costing Ice Luo tens of billions in shares. This quelled the public's curiosity, but it also damaged Uncle Zhu’s reputation.

Thus, many images of poorly managed projects circulated online, which were also orchestrated by Uncle Zhu's people.

Some business experts even used the Apocalypse Paradise as a cautionary tale for novice investors, warning them to be wary of being harvested.

The rumors of fake projects and unfinished work were also spread by Uncle Zhu himself. They hadn’t even obtained proper operating permits; the whole thing was a façade. The initial purchase had only been in two names, entirely unrelated to actual operations.

Ice Luo thought she would endure the most torturous and conflicting two days in the hospital. She was visiting Mr. Zhu's room, alongside Uncle Zhu, as they discussed the precise moment to enter the bunker when they suddenly heard a commotion outside. Moments later, it went silent again.

Two security guards were stationed at the door, and the disturbance lasted only a moment. The security soon knocked and reported that everything was normal.

However, Ice Luo felt an ominous premonition wash over her. Immediately, she stretched out her mental energy to sense what was happening. Just as she did, the sound of a scuffle erupted outside.

Ice Luo and Uncle Zhu exchanged wary glances, signaling for silence as she stealthily moved toward the door. Spreading her mental energy again, she did not need to look. Outside, one security guard lay on the ground, while the other was frantically fleeing, covered in blood. The fallen guard was being viciously devoured by a man in a hospital gown.

As the sounds of screams echoed from outside, Ice Luo realized that the man in the hospital gown had already turned into a zombie and was now pursuing the sounds away from the door. She then whispered to the two men, “There are zombies outside. The apocalypse has come early.”
