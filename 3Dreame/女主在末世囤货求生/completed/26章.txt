**Digging a Pit to Bury Some Soil**

As soon as the news broke, everyone scattered to discuss with their families and company higher-ups. They reported everything they had seen at the Pearl Group, including Luo Bingtian's expressions, attitudes, and the big-name business moguls they encountered in the adjacent conference room. They quickly devised plans to take advantage of the situation.

Luo Bingtian neither confirmed nor denied anyone’s questions, skillfully ushering the crowd out of the room. By the time she returned to her office, it was nearly noon. She had arranged a lunch meeting with her uncle from the Zhu family, deliberately letting those watching her see her hurried arrival at the Pearl Group. 

This only heightened the sense of urgency among them, pushing them to move faster, as if they could grab a piece of the cake before it was too late. Even if they couldn’t devour it all, they wanted to take a big bite. Everyone was thinking they could pack up leftovers while casually smashing the plates and bowls of the others. But at this point, with everyone’s strengths being relatively equal, they couldn’t afford to be too brazen.

The youngest son of the Zhu family was merely following a series of schemes; since the Luo girl had fallen for one trick, she would surely fall for a second or a third. It was as if they could see the sweet, money-scented cake slipping into their grasp, allowing them to secretly get rich while their minds were twisted by both greed and excitement.

The secretary welcomed the Zhu family uncle to the company, and Luo Bingtian had already finished her meeting with her assistant, setting up the groundwork for investigating each interested enterprise. The primary goal was to ascertain how much cash flow each company had on hand and how much they were willing to part with.

The Zhu family uncle casually strolled through the Pearl Group’s offices. The twenty-six-story building, a century-old brand, was bustling with departments and personnel, all housed in one building, complete with three cafeterias. The core areas were located on floors twenty-four to twenty-six, which housed the finance department, business supervision department, secretary’s office, and the president’s office.

Before lunch was served, Luo Bingtian and her uncle from the Zhu family slipped from the twenty-fourth floor down to her office. The uncle was oblivious to whether other families had spies stationed downstairs. Regardless, they played their roles to the fullest and planned to eat upstairs afterward.

Just as they finished their meal, Luo Bingtian's phone began to buzz incessantly. She promptly turned it off, only switching it back on once her uncle had left the Pearl Group building. This would give outsiders the impression that her phone had been deliberately muted by the Zhu family’s youngest son to avoid disturbances while he manipulated her.

Now that she could leave so decisively, it likely meant the brainwashing had succeeded, right? But that was not acceptable. In the past, the old master of the Luo family had been too afraid to act, even though everyone secretly wanted a share. Now that they finally had an opportunity, everyone was competing against each other, and the outcome would depend on their respective abilities.

Having already branded herself as a hunter, she viewed Luo Bingtian as a vulnerable deer ready to be hunted. Little did they know, while they plotted against her, she was busy digging a pit right beneath their feet.

Those so-called uncles and older relatives in the Luo family's network were not particularly close acquaintances. As for the others, many of whom they had never even met, the older established families likely saw the Zhu family making a move and didn’t want to confront them directly, believing it unnecessary to ruin relationships over trivial gains.

Other families might still be observing, preferring to test the waters first. Once they threw a stone, the jade would surely follow.

Around two in the afternoon, the assistant brought back a comprehensive report on the asset situations of the interested companies. Luo Bingtian shared this information with her grandfather and her uncle from the Zhu family, notifying them of her plans.

She then reached out to the head of the company with the largest cash flow, catching them by surprise, as if a forgotten concubine had suddenly been summoned by the emperor. Before long, they arrived at the Pearl Group with their lawyers and assistants, and after a brief meeting, they agreed on the transfer of shares and an equivalent cash amount.

As the largest shareholder of the Pearl Group, Luo Bingtian found that the other shareholders, whose stakes were minimal, did not participate in company decisions. Despite the rumors circulating for a while, the shareholders remained inactive, merely awaiting notifications from the assistant without further concern.

Changing the shareholding structure wouldn’t affect their core benefits. As long as the group continued to operate normally, they could sit back and wait for dividends while letting the young lady carry on her schemes.

The contract for the share transfer was signed in a venue specially arranged by Luo Bingtian. This time, only a small portion—less than 8%—was sold off, but the money received was substantial. 

Once the contract was signed, the counterparties arranged for the funds to be transferred, confirming the cash flow. This step was executed smoothly. The photo was taken and sent to herself, along with a social media post featuring no accompanying text, just a picture. The image contained ample information: a bright and clear shot of the share transfer signing ceremony, with floral decorations on the table and the two parties signing the contract. This sight sent others into a frenzy, bombarding Luo Bingtian and her assistant’s phones with calls.

Before long, the group of eager individuals from the morning reconvened, not as previously coordinated but now each acting independently, all wanting a piece of the pie. No one had time to be polite or make arrangements with competitors; it was a wild race to see who could arrive first.

This time, Luo Bingtian didn’t gather everyone in a conference room but instead dispersed them across different offices, allowing her subordinates to accompany them while she held individual discussions. 

The content of each discussion was simple: how much of a stake they intended to acquire, whether their cash flow was sufficient, and when the funds could be confirmed. Each conversation mirrored the others, with varying intentions among the parties involved. Everyone wanted the largest slice of cake, and it depended on who could be the most ruthless in their negotiations.

Soon, Luo Bingtian selected the most eager and generous uncle from the four, signing an agreement in the same venue but with a different company name, even changing the angle of the photographs. This time, she distributed a bit more—10% of the shares—making the uncle look as if he’d just won a jackpot worth five hundred billion.

Indeed, there was much to celebrate. Under normal circumstances, even if the Luo family faced tough times, they would never allow their industry to slip away, especially considering this was a company valued at billions. Its future development would only improve; there had never been reports of jewelry businesses making losses.

Watching as the cake was sliced thinner, the top families in the capital began to grow restless. What was the Zhu family's ultimate aim? Were they planning to take action, or were they merely trying to extract cash from the Luo girl?

With this question in mind, rumors began to circulate that the Zhu family had already acquired most of the shares without making a sound, likely using the disastrous "Apocalypse Paradise" project as a trap.

If this were true, the Pearl Group could ultimately fall into the hands of the Zhu family. Regardless of who held it, the company would develop and profit, but the issue remained whether they could get a piece of the pie or at least a sip of the soup.

With the idea of not letting others take the lead, the top families gradually reached out to Luo Bingtian, offering generous terms. They directly suggested that if she didn't want to manage the company herself, she could hire professional managers, subtly assuring her that her interests wouldn’t be neglected and hinting that she could buy back her shares in the future.

Luo Bingtian was indeed inclined to consider this, but she was cautious about selecting the right families. She kept a close eye on everyone’s movements, ruling out those who had previously been friendly with her grandfather or had good relations with her family. As long as they didn’t harbor any intentions to take advantage of her, they wouldn’t be able to escape the pit she had dug.

To everyone’s surprise, Luo Bingtian ended up collaborating with companies that had little to no ties with the Luo family, or those that had previously competed against or even antagonized them. These companies had long coveted the opportunity, willing to invest real money. Luo Bingtian was quick to seal the deals, signing agreements with seven or eight firms throughout the afternoon. She even paid special attention to the company where Buqi was located, ultimately maintaining her stake at 19%, still higher than all other shareholders.

This way, she retained her decision-making power and control over the company. The most she would need to consider would be participating in shareholder votes during high-level meetings, but those concerns were not pressing matters at the moment.
