**Playing Along**

As she watched Green Tea Zhen's self-satisfied smile, the way she waved off the followers trailing behind her, Luo Bingtian couldn't resist the urge to ask, “Zhen Zhen, you seem to hold quite a position here. How did you get so powerful?”

“Oh, it’s nothing special. I’m an ability user, after all. The Kunshan Base is pretty friendly towards us,” Green Tea Zhen said, tossing her hair back with an air of pride. Meanwhile, Luo Bingtian's fist clenched tightly in frustration, reminding herself to stay calm and bide her time for revenge. She forced a look of skepticism, as if to say, "You’re not fooling me; it can’t be that simple."

With a sly grin, Green Tea Zhen leaned closer and whispered in Luo Bingtian’s ear, “Actually, I’m the girlfriend of Young Master Fu. That’s why they treat me with respect around here.”

Luo Bingtian's mind raced in confusion. Didn’t this woman belong to me in the last life? How on earth did she end up with my son this time? Or was it that she dated my son first before moving on to me? What a thrilling twist!

But she maintained a facade, displaying a look of envy mixed with admiration, saying, “You’re so lucky! You’re really something, Zhen Zhen.” Green Tea Zhen, however, feigned a look of melancholy as she responded, “My boyfriend treats me well. He’s the heir to the base, you know. His father wants him to marry into a prestigious family to solidify his position. But he’s turned down that proposal multiple times for my sake. Now, he’s being pressured and locked away, and we can’t even see each other.”

Luo Bingtian feigned shock, just as the waiter brought the dishes. Green Tea Zhen quickly turned her attention to the food, but as soon as she finished, she resumed her tale. “I don’t want him to be in a tough spot. I’ve suggested breaking up several times, but he won’t agree. He even considered giving up his inheritance to elope with me. I was touched and stopped bringing it up, but he’s still trapped by his father. He can’t even leave his room without being watched.”

Luo Bingtian took a few bites and uttered the classic three words of a gossip enthusiast, “And then?”

Wiping the corner of her eye, Green Tea Zhen grasped Luo Bingtian’s hand, her expression sincere as she implored, “Xiaohui, I don’t have any true sisters here in the base, just people waiting for me to fail. I see you as my sister; can you help me?”

Luo Bingtian was taken aback. What a sudden twist! Even if Liu Xiaohui herself came, she’d probably be baffled. This was only their second meeting! Was it really that easy to declare a lifelong sisterhood? How cheap!

Putting down her chopsticks, Luo Bingtian feigned being moved, holding Zhen Zhen’s hand tightly. “Zhen Zhen, you’ve really been through a lot. How can I help you?”

Green Tea Zhen’s eyes sparkled with joy as she said it was just a small favor, nothing too complicated, but she couldn’t do it herself because she was being watched. After some probing, Luo Bingtian discovered that Green Tea wanted to use an unfamiliar face to warn the aristocratic girl about the secret relationship she was keeping hidden from Fu Buzhi—her affair with Fu Dingjin.

Luo Bingtian felt uneasy. Was it really that simple? Even if the girl was determined to get engaged, she probably wouldn’t care about past relationships as long as everything was settled before marriage. Marriage alliances weren’t about love; they were about the sincerity and determination of both families to cooperate.

Was Green Tea Zhen really that naive? Did her hatred from the last life stem from this? How ridiculous.

But Luo Bingtian said, “They don’t inquire about these things before getting engaged? Everyone in the base must know Young Master Fu has a girlfriend. Isn’t that enough to back off?”

Green Tea Zhen sensed the underlying meaning in Luo Bingtian’s words. Knowing that her superficial excuse wouldn’t convince her, she bit her lip and said, “Actually, what I want you to do is inform the girl that I’m pregnant. If it was just a relationship, they wouldn’t care, but I’m carrying Young Master Fu’s child. That’s the Fu family’s bloodline!”

Understanding her intention, Luo Bingtian realized Liu Xiaohui was nothing more than a pawn, manipulated into exposing Green Tea’s pregnancy. If she could disrupt the engagement ceremony, it would be perfect; if not, it would still annoy the bride-to-be. The Fu family would be compelled to consider the child and protect her more vigilantly, thus shielding her from retaliation.

What a cunning scheme! Everything was meticulously planned. If this were to unfold at the engagement ceremony, both the Fu family and the bride’s family would lose face, forcing them to swallow their pride.

This was truly brilliant! Luo Bingtian thought it would be a shame to kill her off; she should be kept around to wreak havoc on the Fu family. With such a ticking time bomb, it would be interesting to see how the two men would maneuver their way out of this mess.

Luo Bingtian fell silent, deep in thought, while Green Tea Zhen anxiously watched her, fearing rejection. After a moment, Luo Bingtian finally looked up and asked, “Zhen Zhen, you’re carrying Young Master Fu’s child. He shouldn’t be marrying anyone else; otherwise, your child will be fatherless. But I just arrived at the Kunshan Base and don’t fully understand the situation. Can I really help you? I’m worried I might mess things up for you.”

Seeing the delicate woman before her, whose features were striking but whose skin bore the roughness of the apocalypse, Green Tea Zhen realized that Luo Bingtian had already agreed to help her. She eagerly grasped her hand, saying, “Xiaohui, don’t worry! I’ll make all the arrangements. Your accommodations and points card will be ready this afternoon. The base is simple; you can wander around for the next couple of days. Don’t worry, I’ll have someone take you to the engagement ceremony. Just make sure to talk to the bride-to-be. Even if she insists on going through with the engagement, I won’t have any regrets.”

Green Tea Zhen’s eyes were glued to Luo Bingtian’s face, desperately seeking a hint of rejection. Time was running out—the engagement ceremony was just two days away. If she didn’t find someone suitable to help her, all her efforts over the past year would be in vain.

Luo Bingtian pretended to be conflicted for a long time, but eventually, she nodded in agreement. Green Tea Zhen beamed with joy, insisting that they should minimize their meetings over the next few days to avoid drawing attention from the Fu family. In truth, she was terrified of losing this crucial pawn.

After finishing their meal, Green Tea Zhen made an excuse to leave early. Luo Bingtian returned to the van, bored out of her mind as she passed the time. By two o’clock, she lazily made her way to the administration hall.

Knowing Green Tea Zhen’s plans, she was certain the promised accommodation and points card would materialize. As for the aftermath of the engagement ceremony, Liu Xiaohui’s fate would undoubtedly be grim. The accommodation and points card would only be useful for a few days.

What a meticulous planner! With someone else shouldering all the risks, she would emerge unscathed while the pawn bore the brunt of both families' wrath. Truly, Green Tea Zhen had become a heartless schemer. Her pushing of people into zombie hordes at the onset of the apocalypse was proof enough.

In the administration hall, the lines at the various service windows seemed never-ending. The line for accommodation and points cards was still long, if not longer than before. Finding a corner to lean against the wall, Luo Bingtian watched as the counter pulled back the curtain and slowly removed the “suspended services” sign.

The previously noisy hall erupted with even more chatter, the volume rising several decibels. With her keen senses, Luo Bingtian winced at the sudden noise, covering her ears.

Turning around, she noticed a short man waving at her. Assuming he was someone sent by Green Tea Zhen, she followed him as he led her out of the bustling hall to a secluded grove. It was there he pulled out a bundle of items from under his arm and handed them to Luo Bingtian one by one.

“Miss Liu, right? Here’s your accommodation key card, and this is your points card with 500 points already loaded. It’s usable throughout the entire base. And this…” 

Luo Bingtian squinted at the USB drive in his hand, puzzled. What was it with the Kunshan Base and their love for USB drives? Shi Jinghang had also given her one earlier. 

With a stoic expression, she accepted it, realizing it was meant for the bride-to-be of Fu Dingjin.

Once all the items were handed over, the short man quickly glanced around before darting away.

Luo Bingtian tucked the USB drive into her storage space and headed straight to her new accommodation. Green Tea Zhen was using Liu Xiaohui, so the items she provided were bound to be good. To her surprise, the accommodation was a one-bedroom suite, a privilege usually reserved for powerful ability users. Giving such a luxurious room to an ordinary person was risky; didn’t they fear she would attract unwanted attention?

Thinking it over, she realized that since she had just arrived and the Fu family was busy with the engagement preparations, it made sense they wouldn’t pay her much mind for now. 

Green Tea Zhen was indeed smart, using all her cunning to manipulate others. With the Fu family, she truly was a perfect match.
