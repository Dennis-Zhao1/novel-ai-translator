Driving Away

Meng was getting anxious in the car. Normally, it would take no more than five minutes to get down from the sixth floor of the hospital, and even ten minutes would be sufficient if things were slow. But now, it had been almost forty minutes, and the young miss still hadn't appeared. What if something serious happened?

He instinctively touched the gun tucked in his lower back, which the young miss had secretly given him. Although he didn't know exactly what was going on, the look on her face suggested something big had occurred. After deliberating for a moment, he decided that if he didn’t see her in another five minutes, he'd go up and get her himself.

Fortunately, not long after, he saw three figures rushing out of the hospital's back door, their expressions filled with panic. Luo Bingtin quickly helped Grandpa Zhu into the back seat of the car and closed the door before taking her place in the driver's seat.

Once Uncle Zhu was settled in the car, Meng stepped on the gas, following the pre-planned route towards the stronghold location.

A wave of fear washed over Luo Bingtin, causing cold sweat to trickle down her forehead, chilling her to the bone as the car’s air conditioning blew directly on her. Meng focused on driving, keenly aware of their surroundings, his vigilance heightened. He noticed that both the young miss and Uncle Zhu had spots of blood on their clothes. There was no time to ask questions; it was clear that some major incident had gone down at the hospital.

The hospital where Grandpa Zhu was treated was a high-end private facility, far removed from the city's hustle and bustle. It was spacious and primarily focused on medical care and rehabilitation, with lush greenery and well-maintained roads providing a broad view of the surroundings.

In the passenger seat, Luo Bingtin tuned her senses to the maximum, feeling a bit reassured by the absence of people nearby. 

Once they hit the highway, her heart finally started to settle. The traffic was light, and everything seemed normal, indicating that the zombie virus hadn't spread widely yet.

She pulled out her phone and logged into various news sites, stumbling upon a trending topic: "Patients at a certain hospital suspected of rabies outbreak, attacking people." Clicking on it revealed that the zombie outbreak had occurred at City Third Hospital, just like in her previous life. But why was there also chaos at Grandpa Zhu's private hospital?

Could it be a butterfly effect? Or perhaps she just hadn't paid attention in her past life? Regardless, Luo Bingtin pushed those thoughts aside. In the back seat, Uncle Zhu was busy calling family members one by one to confirm their safety.

She played the video she found, handing her phone to Grandpa Zhu and the others. The footage from the hospital’s security cameras showed a blood-soaked man lying on a hospital bed, suddenly going berserk and biting the doctor who was performing CPR on him.

Screams erupted as everyone scattered, and it took a while before hospital security rushed in with a stun rod, prying the man off the bitten doctor, who was then carried away by other medical staff.

The video abruptly cut off there. After watching, both of Uncle Zhu's family members fell silent. It was clear that this wasn’t merely a rabies outbreak. Though the footage was grainy, anyone sharp-eyed would notice that the man’s vital signs monitor had gone off moments before he attacked. The heart rate monitor had flattened out, indicating that the medical staff had fought to save him, but he had suddenly transformed into a monster, a mindless creature intent on tearing others apart.

Luo Bingtin instinctively hit record, replaying the video and saving it to her gallery. She then scrolled through the comments, most of which fixated on why security had taken so long to respond, or why the other medical personnel hadn’t intervened sooner.

Then she saw a comment pointing out how it looked just like a scene from a zombie movie, where the transformation always starts like this. A flurry of humorous replies followed, and Luo Bingtin felt tempted to like that comment. But soon, it vanished, and the video became unplayable. It seemed that social media was once again censoring the situation.

Most likely, City Third Hospital didn’t want such incidents to tarnish their reputation. With the focus of public outcry on the hospital's security failures, it was understandable that they would want to control the narrative.

What was truly abnormal was how few people seemed to care about the incident itself, simply brushing it off as a rabies outbreak.

Luo Bingtin's mind was flooded with conspiracy theories, her head spinning with various ideas, and she felt a dull throb at her temples. The most prominent thought was whether this was a natural disaster or man-made, whether it could have been avoided, and if so, why it hadn’t been. She felt low, perhaps due to the perilous experience she had just endured. In her previous life, she had been one of those protected from the horrors of a zombie apocalypse, never having faced such terror directly.

She was mostly just feeling downcast, unwilling to accept the sudden loss of a once-beautiful world, now replaced by one of brutality and despair.

Uncle Zhu suddenly spoke up, breaking her reverie. “Luo, is there any way to save someone after they’ve turned like that?”

Snapping back to reality, she replied, “I’m not sure. We need to determine whether this is caused by a virus or genetic mutation. But human evolution definitely doesn’t manifest like this.”

Luo Bingtin had always despised the idea that zombification was a form of human evolution. Zombies were monsters—emotionless, devoid of reason, driven only by a desire to consume.

Meng, unaware of the specifics of their conversation, was already preparing to exit the highway. Meanwhile, Luo Bingtin continued to search for related content online. It was evident there were entries but no videos—likely still about the incident at City Third Hospital.

The zombie outbreak hadn’t spread far yet, and she hoped it stayed that way. Every second spent outside was a risk.

Just as she tucked her phone away and noticed Meng slowing down to enter the highway toll booth, their vehicle was suddenly slammed from behind. Everyone lurched forward slightly; if they hadn’t been buckled in, they could have been injured.

Uncle Zhu turned to look back and spotted the driver of the car behind them, his complexion pale and sickly, his eyes bloodshot with a yellowish tint. It was clear he had just turned into a zombie, losing control of his vehicle and crashing straight into them.

Meng swerved the steering wheel left to avoid the oncoming car, and sure enough, once he moved aside, the vehicle behind them crashed into the one in front.

Luo Bingtin noticed an opening at the toll booth on the left and urged Meng to drive through it. The car had already been hit; they could take the damage. Their armored vehicle was sturdy enough. She glanced back at the chaos, observing the second driver who had been hit angrily getting out of his car and slapping the zombie-turned driver’s windshield, cursing loudly.

He must have realized something was wrong with the other driver’s behavior but didn’t attempt to open the door. Instead, he called the police as the road became congested due to the accident.

Luo Bingtin wanted to yell for everyone to run; it was a zombie! But in a situation like this, no one would believe her. She wasn’t alone; there were many waiting for her at the fortress, and the lives of the Zheng family were entrusted to her. She couldn’t afford to get caught up in this chaos now.

With no other choice, she looked away, and Meng had already completed the toll payment and exited the highway. Ahead lay a winding mountain road; in another half-hour, they would reach the stronghold. She resolved that the first thing she would do upon arriving was to post warnings about the zombie outbreak online.

Even if only one person believed her, it could save a life.

The heavy atmosphere lingered until they entered the stronghold. After passing through three checkpoints, the four of them finally arrived at the fortress entrance. Meng parked the car at the former base playground, now repurposed as a parking lot.

Grandpa Zhu walked tall, followed closely by Luo Bingtin and Uncle Zhu, as they made their way into the lobby of the office building, all eyes on them.
