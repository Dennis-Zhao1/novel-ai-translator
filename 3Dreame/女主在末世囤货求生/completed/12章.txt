**Stockpiling Military Supplies Abroad**

After swiftly exchanging through a network of contacts, some second-generation family members were still processing the situation when a few red envelopes sent by Lila Lang exploded their group into disarray.

Those with quick wits had already completed their transactions, celebrating at home with a party for their newly acquired companies. Lila Lang's holdings were not just at the top of their respective industries; they were among the top ten, and their future valuation promised to soar even higher.

Of course, assuming the future was still a certainty, Lila returned to her luxurious penthouse, counting the cash she had on hand. Over ten billion had suddenly appeared, and her next step was to gather resources and construct an underground fortress.

She delegated the task of procuring supplies to her executive assistant. With other companies trading and selling, the only usable assets left were the employees of the Pearl Jewelry Group. Lila had hesitated briefly about whether to offload the jewelry business, but its valuation was too high for a single buyer to swallow—after all, its products were solid gold and diamonds.

But then a lightbulb went off in her head: it was impossible to let go of it, yet using it to set up a scheme to swap for some benefits wasn’t that difficult either.

What was more pressing was her trip abroad. Once she was ready to depart lightly, her wealthy second-generation friend, Ethan Qin, personally came to pick her up for the airport.

This trip was shrouded in secrecy. Lila only told outsiders she was off to explore both domestic and international sites, but in reality, she was heading to an overseas mining area with Ethan.

To successfully mine abroad, having firearms was essential. Unlike domestic regulations, foreign markets were much less stringent; with money and connections, one could acquire almost anything.

This time, they traveled on a private jet. Ethan was cautious, not informing any other friends in their circle, fearing that a slip-up would ruin the operation and upset their elders.

Lila’s uncle, who oversaw arms transactions, had actually flown to the mining area a day earlier. Given the scale of the deal, he couldn’t make decisions alone. Observing Lila, who appeared innocent and carefree, he felt a mix of admiration and envy.

Accompanied by a bodyguard arranged by her grandfather, Lila had already established contacts in the mining area through her grandfather’s connections, merely saying she was visiting for fun and to broaden her horizons.

No one suspected her true intentions of stockpiling arms. The Lang family’s Pearl Jewelry Group owned a jade mine in Myanmar, which was protected by local armed forces. Why would she need to go through all this trouble to acquire guns?

They likely thought of her as a young girl with money to burn, someone who just wanted to have fun; as long as there was a transaction, there were benefits. With that mindset, they helped Lila create an excuse that convinced them to participate.

On the plane, Ethan chatted casually with Lila about various topics, but she was intentionally fishing for information, wanting to know how they would transport weapons back to China if she didn’t have the means. Or how to acquire more lethal firearms. Ethan assumed her sparkling eyes were merely curiosity and was eager to share, not wanting to disappoint her.

Ethan was easy to fool, but his uncle was no pushover; he was a cunning fox who had long ago mastered the art of manipulation, and no one could pull a fast one on him.

After disembarking, the car arranged by Ethan's uncle whisked them directly to the mining area. The machinery and equipment were running, creating a busy yet not overly noisy atmosphere.

Lookout towers surrounded the mine, with armed personnel patrolling both the top and bottom to prevent worker uprisings or enemy attacks. Unlike the peace in China, having weapons was a necessity abroad.

When Ethan’s uncle saw Lila, his sharp eyes assessed her discreetly. He could easily believe she was merely a playful girlfriend of his nephew. Who would suspect that she wanted firearms and ammunition? Not comprehending her intentions, he tentatively asked, "Isn’t curiosity a natural trait?" 

Lila knew he was not easily fooled, so she sighed half-truthfully, mentioning her family’s jade mine in Myanmar. She subtly indicated that the local armed forces had become restless since her grandfather's passing, and without a counterbalance, she sought help from the Qin family, taking a long way around to resolve the issue.

Seeing her earnest expression, Ethan's uncle adjusted his understanding, recognizing their armed forces were very real and that they had never relied on others for protection.

The partners of the Lang family were notorious for their ruthlessness. While they were trustworthy, he found it hard to grasp how much value this little princess held in the eyes of the leaders.

Prioritizing profit was their ironclad rule, and after Lila spoke, Ethan’s uncle set aside his last doubts, even kindly offering more powerful options.

Having hinted at her intentions on the plane, Ethan’s uncle suddenly understood how difficult her situation was. No wonder she wanted to offload other business assets; even the Pearl Jewelry Group might not withstand pressure. It was better to convert them into cash or tangible assets rather than risk losing everything.

The deal went surprisingly smoothly. After spending a day and night at the mine, Ethan’s uncle notified her that the goods had arrived. The initial shipment had been supplemented, and arming a hundred-man team was no problem.

Lila’s bodyguard, a former foreign mercenary, was well-versed in firearms. He was there for both safety and to help her verify the goods.

One by one, the bodyguard opened wooden crates, inspecting the firearms and ammunition. Some guns were disassembled for a thorough check, while ammunition was examined for craftsmanship, precision, and sufficiency.

Ethan’s uncle and Lila sat patiently nearby. Ethan's uncle was clearly thinking more deeply than her; a young girl like Lila was suddenly abroad with little understanding of the world. Was she bold or just naïve?

As for whether the Qin family would take advantage of her or deceive her, Lila had no worries. Her grandfather's connections were formidable, and while she might not know the extent, other families had some inkling.

This was her confidence and leverage.

After Lila verified the goods, she agreed to have them transported to Myanmar that very night. She also facilitated port access so they could be directly loaded onto shipping containers.

Following Ethan’s uncle to the port, Lila watched as the armed supplies were methodically loaded into the container under his supervision. A significant portion of the container was taken up by the shipments.

Once everything was packed, the doors needed to be locked, with the key handed over to Lila for her to transfer to her designated receiver.

Just as the door was about to close, Lila suddenly called out, “Wait! Don’t close it yet!”

Ethan’s uncle was perplexed, unsure of what this little girl was up to.

Lila sheepishly smiled at him. “I forgot to add the Lang family’s mark inside. Grandpa said all our goods need it; otherwise, they won't be accepted over there.”

Ethan’s uncle understood; he had heard of this unique mark, a C-shaped dragon motif that also inspired the Pearl Group's logo. The marking technique was so specialized that only members of the Lang family knew it, making it impossible for others to replicate.

He nodded, signaling his men to open the container doors again.

Lila waved her hand confidently. “No need to trouble yourselves, Uncle. I'll just slip in and mark it quickly; I'm quite slim.”

With that, she darted inside, illuminating the space with her phone's flashlight. Moments later, she re-emerged, urging them to lock up and secure the key.

The key was handed over to her bodyguard for safekeeping, and she returned to Ethan’s uncle with a cheerful smile.

They didn’t linger to await the container's loading; that would draw too much attention. The less they appeared to care, the less likely they were to arouse suspicion.

After ensuring that the door locks and chains were intact and affixing the logistics labels and seals, Lila and Ethan’s uncle planned to head back to the mining area. However, the bustling city next to the port caught Lila’s eye.

Ethan’s uncle chuckled at Lila’s carefree demeanor, suggesting they spend the next few days exploring the city.

After a moment's thought, Lila nodded. The shipping logistics would take time to reach their destination, and besides, this was merely a performance—the batch of military supplies had already settled comfortably in her space.
