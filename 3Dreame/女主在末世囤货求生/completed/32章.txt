**Clearing Out the Jewelry Inventory**

Not long after finishing their meal, the scene had shifted to a wrapping-up phase. The middle-aged man had once again assigned an assistant to help him. The two of them scribbled and muttered calculations for a while, finally looking up and nodding at the man in the center. They handed over their notes.

The central man, having split a pack of spicy snacks with his companion, wiped his hands and took the papers, glancing through them. Satisfied, he returned to his seat and asked, “How much do you want for this batch of goods?”

“Clearing out the inventory. The more you want, the bigger the discount,” came the reply.

“I’ll take all of it,” he declared decisively.

Chris looked up, a look of surprise crossing his face. “You want the jade too?” he asked, as if taken aback.

The central man nodded. “I recently got to know a few merchants from Huaguo,” he explained, as if that sufficed.

Lo Bingting wondered to herself, is this a favor for me or for the spicy snacks?

Meanwhile, the middle-aged man brought over a laptop and continued to work with three assistants nearby. Lo Bingting, having enjoyed a hearty meal, found herself growing sleepy. It would be great if this batch sold out completely, allowing her to avoid running off to another location in the middle of the night.

Chris made a phone call, confirming that they wouldn’t need to visit the next place. After hanging up, he turned to Lo Bingting, who was half-asleep, and announced, “The next appointment is canceled.”

Lo Bingting nodded lazily, raising her hand to stifle a delicate yawn. Since her rebirth, she had been perpetually busy. Once this batch of jewelry was dealt with, she could spend the remaining time stockpiling goods without the urgency she had felt before.

About an hour later, the middle-aged man returned, handing her two folders. When Lo Bingting opened them, she was taken aback to find detailed price lists inside. Impressive! The high-end jewelry had market references for comparison, and the prices offered were quite reasonable and fair.

She had initially expected a massive clearance sale, preparing herself to be taken advantage of, but these items were essentially free for her. After carefully reviewing the price list, she marked two items she believed were underpriced and handed her suggested selling prices back to the central man.

He conferred with the middle-aged man for a moment, then nodded in agreement. Such buyer-offer transactions weren’t uncommon, and since Lo Bingting hadn’t haggled, they were quick to accept. Chris, already accustomed to Lo Bingting’s trading style, facilitated the exchange smoothly—money in one hand, goods in the other—without the need for a contract.

Lo Bingting was more than happy to leave as few traces as possible. After confirming the payment had been received, she left two packs of differently flavored spicy snacks for the central man as a token of appreciation for the friendly transaction.

She also decided to leave her rolling suitcase behind. As she walked out, she waved casually, a relaxed demeanor as she and Chris headed back to the hotel together.

The hotel bar operated twenty-four hours, and Lo Bingting reserved a quiet private room. She invited Chris in, opening a bottle of sparkling wine to celebrate their successful and smooth transaction.

Mengo stood guard outside while Chris retrieved his tablet. He was already well aware of the total amount from their previous transactions and noted down the latest successful deal. He gestured for Lo Bingting to confirm the transaction total.

Lo Bingting had an excellent memory and only needed a glance to verify. Nodding, she watched as Chris added the commission percentages to different items, calculating the total commission amount.

She transferred him a neat sum. The commissions from the recent transactions had exceeded ten million dollars. Lo Bingting cheerfully completed the payment, and Chris grinned, “Thank you, boss.”

Lo Bingting waved it off nonchalantly, knowing part of it came from various families. She planned to inquire about specialty products from neighboring countries to stock up; this trip wasn't about rushing back home, and the thought of not spending all the money made her uneasy.

Her exchanges with Chris were always comfortable and natural. She saw no reason to hide her stockpiling plans from him; if he asked, she would tell him the truth without concern for his beliefs.

Lo Bingting pulled out a small notebook, jotting down a list as they talked. Australian milk, steak, and kangaroo meat? Perfect, she noted. Ice wine and seafood from Canada? She’d get that tomorrow. She wanted it all.

She aimed to gather information on the main agricultural products and cuisines of the surrounding countries, hoping Chris could introduce her to suppliers. Ideally, he would accompany her on her buying spree across various nations.

After Chris had previously received a similar joking response about the apocalypse, he hadn't dared to ask Lo Bingting the same question again. Regardless of her sanity, these events were happening for real. So, was the apocalypse real?

Lo Bingting ignored Chris's contemplations, filling her notebook to the brim. The time ahead was meant for her to travel the globe, experiencing the world before the apocalypse arrived, firmly etching it in her memory.

Chris, observing Lo Bingting’s travel destinations, utilized his extensive network to help her formulate an itinerary for her global adventure. Following Lo Bingting's preferences, they planned a route from far to near, but Chris pointed out that it wouldn’t be that simple. The suppliers had uncertain timings, so they could only fly along a single route.

Lo Bingting didn’t mind; for the next two weeks, they would travel by private jet, more than enough to cover the countries on their list.

She wouldn’t get stuck on the fateful date of May 20th when the apocalypse struck in her previous life. She felt that her actions, like the fluttering of a butterfly’s wings, would lead to different outcomes.

Thanks to her, the various families and Fu Buqi were already different from her past life. She had to trust her instincts and avoid any complacency.

Lo Bingting also booked a room for Chris. Over the next two weeks, he would accompany her everywhere, enjoying a well-deserved break while making plenty of money.

Once back in her room, she tidied up and slipped into her space. Checking on the farm animals, she was pleasantly surprised to find a pile of white objects hidden in the straw where the chickens, ducks, and geese were kept.

Curious, she approached and cleared away the straw, revealing a heap of eggs. The smaller ones were likely chicken eggs, while the larger ones could either be duck or goose eggs—there seemed to be quite a lot of them!

Lo Bingting marveled at the sight, noticing that none of the birds were incubating the eggs, as they lay abandoned in the straw. She crouched down, picking one up and shaking it gently; it didn’t feel like it had gone bad, indicating that these eggs were fresh.

This led her to a realization: while animals in the space wouldn’t reproduce naturally, they could still lay eggs normally. Just like other items, the eggs could be preserved, a logical and reasonable phenomenon.

She wouldn’t be lacking in protein anytime soon. As for how long the chickens, ducks, and geese would thrive in the space, she wasn’t sure. If things went awry when the apocalypse hit, she could always release them to reproduce. The castle would have plenty of room, and she was determined to make the most of it.
