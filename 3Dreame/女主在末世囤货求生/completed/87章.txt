**The Reversal of Fate**

Just as Adam Song was about to make a move, a panicked side branch psychic leaned in close to Wu Zhu, whispering something in his ear. Wu Zhu's face twisted with shock and anger as he turned to his uncle Zhu. Without hesitation, he activated his powers and launched an attack at Zhu.

Caught off guard, Uncle Zhu scrambled to dodge the sudden onslaught, but once he caught his breath, he began to fight back. Clara Joy watched intently, curious about what had transpired during the negotiations that might concern her. She wasn’t worried about her secret knowledge of the apocalypse being exposed; after all, those were just excuses. But being betrayed—now that was a different matter entirely, and she wasn’t fond of it.

It seemed Uncle Zhu didn’t intend to involve her. The conflict quickly escalated into a battle between the branches and the main family. It didn’t take long for the numbers to show their advantage, with the main family being pushed back repeatedly. Many of the ordinary Zhu family members had never seen such violence before; some screamed for it to stop, while others fled in terror, fearing they would be caught in the crossfire.

"This is what a noble family looks like," Clara thought, a smirk creeping onto her face despite the chaos.

Before long, the battle reached its conclusion, with the main family suffering a decisive defeat. The side branch reveled in their victory, capturing members of the main family. Wu Zhu boldly declared, “Hand over all the weapons from the armory!”

Uncle Zhu, injured and struggling to stand, was quickly pushed back down. Just then, Zhu Yidan, who had been overlooked at first as she comforted her mother, suddenly erupted in anger. She hurled a fireball straight at Wu Zhu, who barely had time to react before it struck him, causing him to scream in agony. She continued her assault on the side branch psychics holding her relatives captive, finally managing to free them.

Wu Zhu’s face was scorched, his skin charred, and he roared in outrage, “You filthy wench! Your father is still in my hands. If you don’t behave, I’ll send him to meet the Grim Reaper!”

It dawned on Zhu Yidan that the people from the laboratory hadn’t appeared, and her second brother was also missing. No wonder her grandfather was unharmed, and Uncle Zhu had agreed to step down. Enraged, her powers surged as she prepared to fight back.

“Enough!” Uncle Zhu grunted through his pain. He was worried the other side would go too far; he held all the people from the laboratory in his hands. “Wu Zhu, I’ve given you everything you wanted; isn’t that enough?”

“Bullshit! The most cunning in the Zhu family is you! I see you’ve been setting a trap for us all along, waiting for us to walk right into it. You’ve hidden the weapons and the black box, just waiting for me to fall into your snare!” Wu Zhu was seething with rage, unable to sleep soundly knowing he had no weapons or the black box while constantly fearing a counterattack from the main family.

Uncle Zhu was taken aback by his outburst, realizing he had a point but choosing to remain silent. Zhu Yidan, however, couldn’t hold back any longer. She shouted, “Where are my dad and the others? You heartless bastards! You’ve kidnapped my grandfather, and now you’ve taken my dad! Let them go!”

“Dream on! Hand over the weapons and the black box, or I’ll kill one person every ten minutes!” Wu Zhu commanded. The side branch had brought ropes to bind Uncle Zhu, Zhu Yidan, and the others. Those who resisted were threatened with their family members. Looking around, she saw the patrol team and guards pointing guns at the ordinary members of the main family, most of whom were women and children.

Some of them also aimed their guns at Clara and her team, but noticing she didn’t seem inclined to fight back, they held their positions. Uncle Zhu furrowed his brow, lost in thought, before suddenly turning to Clara. 

Receiving his gaze, Clara blinked back at him. But Wu Zhu wasn’t so easily swayed; he ordered his men to start a countdown.

The bound psychics from the main family hurled insults, calling their captors heartless and treacherous, but Clara sighed inwardly. This was all a result of the leniency shown by Grandfather Zhu and Uncle Zhu. The last time the fifth branch had sold the laboratory’s secrets to the Kunshan base, they should have seen this coming.

Always believing they were in control, thinking they had everything figured out, the main family had failed to realize that the rules had changed. In this apocalypse, besides survival and interests, what else was there to discuss? The fate of traitors was death.

“Are you going to tell us? Where are the weapons and the black box?” Wu Zhu demanded, grimacing as someone applied ointment to his wounds. He was shaking from the pain, his anger escalating with each pulse of agony.

“Stop making baseless accusations! Aren’t all the guards in the watchtower your people? You should know if I’ve done anything at all!” Clara thought to herself, impressed by Uncle Zhu’s smooth maneuvering; in this case, he indeed had done nothing.

As the countdown reached zero, Wu Zhu randomly grabbed a hostage from the ordinary members—one of the youngest boys from the main family, under twelve years old. He was the only son of Uncle Zhu's fourth brother, who had no psychic powers and wasn’t a core member of the family before the apocalypse. Watching his son held at gunpoint, he began to cry out desperately. 

“Fifth brother, save your nephew! Just give him what he wants!” Uncle Zhu’s face twisted with concern.

“Please, I truly haven’t moved the armory’s weapons! Just let the boy go; don’t pull him into this!” Uncle Zhu pleaded, his expression grave.

Wu Zhu eyed Uncle Zhu, unimpressed by his tough act. He shot the boy without hesitation, tossing the lifeless body aside. He then yanked Zhu Yidan’s mother by the hair, dragging her before Uncle Zhu.

Seeing his son murdered, Uncle Zhu collapsed in shock. Meanwhile, Zhu's older brother, who had yet to awaken his powers, rushed to protect his mother, only to be shot in the abdomen by Wu Zhu. It was unclear whether he was dead or alive.

“If your sister-in-law dies because of you, do you think your brother's family will ever forgive you?” Wu Zhu laughed cruelly, knowing the main family had always maintained a united front, pushing out side branches while proclaiming that they were one big family. But when it came down to it, they always chose sides.

“If you don’t speak up today, it will be your sister-in-law’s death that you caused!”

Zhu Yidan, frozen in fear, could not shed any tears. With her back pressed against the ground, she raised her chin defiantly and screamed, “You bastard! If you dare to kill my brother, I swear I’ll kill you!”

Wu Zhu merely scoffed, signaling his men to act.

Zhu Yidan struggled fiercely, flames erupting from the ropes binding her. But before she could rise, side branch psychics restrained her with water and earth powers, pinning her to the ground.

Seeing her friend in distress made Clara’s fingers twitch. She glanced over at Adam, who was watching her closely. His expression was calm, utterly unfazed by the tense atmosphere, which helped Clara find her own sense of peace amidst the chaos.

Uncle Zhu closed his eyes for a moment, then suddenly looked up at Clara. “I accept your terms.”

After a long day of witnessing this drama unfold, Clara finally saw the moment she had been waiting for. It was time to bring this farce to an end. 

With a swift motion, she raised her hand, and ice shards pierced Wu Zhu’s body, his scream echoing throughout the plaza. 

Everyone stood shocked, not expecting Clara to intervene in the Zhu family conflict. 

Quickly, she took down a few more assailants and turned to Adam and the others, shouting, “What are you all standing around for? Get to work!”

Ming and Adam were quick to react, rapidly dispersing and taking down every armed side branch member in sight. 

The Zheng family's fighters and their team members joined the fray, their three days of coordinated combat training paying off. With abundant crystal power amplifying their abilities, they fought like seasoned warriors. 

Even when the enemy fired their weapons, the bullets were blocked by earthen barriers created by the earth-based psychics, only to be followed up by Adam’s lightning strikes. 

Those trying to escape found themselves ensnared by vines conjured by the wood-based psychics, tumbling head over heels before being finished off by Clara’s ice shards.

To the ordinary onlookers, it was a brutal display of power, with the psychics effortlessly overpowering their opponents. 

In no time, the battle concluded, leaving the side branch members bound and bleeding, their earlier dominance turned on its head. 

All weapons were confiscated and piled at Clara’s feet. 

Uncle Zhu broke free of his bindings, clutching his wounds as he rose to his feet, his gaze shifting from the defeated side branch members to a cold indifference. 

Zhu Yidan rushed to her brother's side, desperately trying to staunch the flow of blood from his injuries. 

As Clara summoned her people back, she noticed Anmin standing at the edge of the plaza, signaling her. She knew everything would be alright from here on out.
