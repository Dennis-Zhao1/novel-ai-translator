**Mobile Arms Dealer**

Xie Jinghang had essentially transformed into a mobile arms dealer’s equipment warehouse—anything you wanted, he had it. Even An Min and the others, despite their usual dullness, sensed something was off. However, they kept their mouths shut; there was no point in asking too many questions. Knowing too much could be detrimental, and honestly, it wouldn’t change anything.

Zhu Yidan watched her naive friend with a knowing smile. She had picked up on the clues back when Luo Bingtin had started collaborating with her grandfather. It was all for their benefit, after all. A true best friend doesn’t pry into secrets but instead stands guard and helps cover them up.

Soon, they found themselves on the stairs of the fire escape. It felt like a trick of the mind—stepping onto the landing seemed to increase the number of zombies above them exponentially. They couldn’t help but wonder how many of those things were being kept up there, like some twisted farm.

“The stairs have a sensor. Stay alert and destroy them if you see any!” Xie Jinghang commanded, and the group nodded in understanding. Even though they knew about the sensors, there was no time to search for them with a horde of zombies coming at them from above.

“I refuse to believe we can’t kill them all! Aaaah!” An Min suddenly shouted, his voice echoing in the tight space. If Wang Xinxin were here, she would have definitely berated him for his outburst. Zhu Yidan had no intention of indulging his bad habits.

“If you think there aren’t enough zombies, shout louder! You’ll attract every single one of them!” she snapped.

An Min ignored her, firing wildly at the approaching zombies. He was annoyed by the limbs strewn on the ground, so he used his wind-based abilities to whip up a tornado that sent the disgusting remains flying.

Luo Bingtin’s eyes lit up as she grabbed An Min by the arm. “Aim your tornado at the walls and floor of the hallway—make it destructive, but don't destroy the stairs!”

An Min nodded, gathering his strength before unleashing several powerful gusts of wind. Following the trail of the wind, Luo Bingtin carefully scanned the area and finally spotted the sensors nestled in the dead angle of the handrail, the wires buried in the wall.

With a single shot, she disabled the sensor, and the effect was immediate—zombies flooding down the stairs slowed significantly. However, many more were still stuck in the hallway, blocking their way. It felt like they were wedged in a tight spot, but Xie Jinghang quickly found a good angle and began clearing the path.

He focused on the zombies descending from above, while Luo Bingtin and the others dealt with those trying to ascend. They were protected by the walls on either side, which provided at least a temporary reprieve from the relentless undead.

As the bodies piled up, the stench became unbearable. Thankfully, An Min was there to clear the air with his abilities; otherwise, they might have suffocated in the stairwell.

Luo Bingtin fished out isolation masks from her storage space—made of a new material that blocked out foul odors and bacteria. They distributed the masks, putting them on along with protective goggles. Instantly, the air felt fresher, and their spirits lifted considerably.

What began as frantic, chaotic attacks transformed into a coordinated effort under Luo Bingtin’s leadership. The group found themselves able to spare moments to assist Xie Jinghang as well.

Before long, Xie Jinghang had cleared the zombies descending the stairs, but the hallway was now littered with debris, and the sensation of squishing bodies beneath their feet was far from pleasant.

He took a moment to check the system shop, hoping to find suitable footwear, but to his dismay, there were no decent options. The combat gear mainly consisted of clothing and boots that didn’t seem as comfortable as what they were already wearing.

Luo Bingtin nearly slipped on the slick remains as she sifted through her storage. She vaguely remembered stashing away some outdoor gear that included non-slip shoes. After rummaging for a while, she finally found them—anti-slip spikes that could be directly fitted over shoes. They were small and only covered the forefoot, but she slipped on a pair and felt a satisfying grip on the floor.

She shared a few more with the others, and Xie Jinghang recognized that these were designed for climbing and extreme sports—perfect for their current predicament.

With stable footing came newfound confidence, and soon, the hallway was littered with the corpses of zombies.

Maintaining the same stance for too long was tiring, and An Min and Zhu Yidan couldn’t help but recall their previous encounter during the zombie siege.

“Let’s keep our spirits up! There’s definitely a finite number of zombies. Why not make it a game? See who can shoot straight and take out the most!” Luo Bingtin encouraged, recalling the giant monstrosity they had dealt with yesterday. Today, it was the zombies' turn, and she couldn’t escape this densely packed world.

In fact, An Min and Luo Fan had already silently begun their own competition, driven by that inexplicable male urge to compete.

As Xie Jinghang led them upward, he noted the increasing number of zombie corpses piling up on the upper levels. He pondered how to clear them quickly when he saw Luo Fan halt his contest with An Min to help Xie Jinghang clear the blockage in the stairwell.

His method was direct—using his abilities to move the debris out the window. He found that this power acted like an invisible hand, allowing him to accomplish many tasks if controlled properly.

Before long, they reached the second floor. The door to the fire escape stood wide open, revealing an environment typical of office buildings, except that biological tech companies often had labs.

Luo Bingtin approached, observing the new equipment warily, but she hesitated to touch anything. If this was indeed a trap set by Fu Buqi, everything here could be dangerous.

She cautioned the others not to touch anything and urged them to continue ascending if they didn’t find any humans.

The zombies below were still relentless, merely held off by Luo Fan and the others.

As they made their way up, it appeared that they hadn’t triggered any sensors on the second flight of stairs—no waves of zombies surged forth.

Luo Bingtin paused. Could it be she was relying too much on her usual logic? Normally, in this situation, they would expect the sensors to activate and unleash a new wave of mutated zombies to eradicate them entirely.

It was odd—something that should have been predictable hadn’t occurred. The group exchanged puzzled glances but continued their ascent.

“Something’s not right,” Luo Bingtin thought, her vigilance heightened compared to the others, who were more relaxed.

Her instincts proved correct as they arrived at the second-level landing, greeted by a sea of crazed sea urchins. Luo Bingtin realized this was the second layer of danger.

“Help! I have a phobia of being in tight spaces!” Zhu Yidan cried out, her voice dripping with feigned despair, even as she launched into action with a vengeance.

Her posture seemed to scream, “You little pests don’t deserve to die beneath my feet!”

With the crazed sea urchins above and zombies below, Luo Bingtin decided to leave the lower level to An Min, Luo Fan, and Zhu Yidan, while she and Xie Jinghang tackled the threats above.

The sea urchins remained quiet until they sensed humans nearby. Then, they surged forward like wolves catching the scent of meat, eager to leap onto the unsuspecting prey.

“Xie Jinghang, looks like we need to use the Flame Dragon!” Luo Bingtin declared, pulling out her fireproof gear.

Xie Jinghang nodded, providing her cover as she donned the suit. Once both were ready, he turned to An Min and the others. “We’re going to set these little nuisances ablaze. You all stay here and keep the zombies at bay—don’t let them come up!”

The group nodded, too focused to look back at Luo Bingtin.

“Let’s do this!” Xie Jinghang said, and the two raised the Flame Dragon in unison, preparing to unleash their fiery assault.

“What the hell is that?!”
