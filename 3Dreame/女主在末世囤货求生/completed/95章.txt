**Father and Son Under Fire**

It was highly likely that things would escalate. With this thought in her mind, Ice Lotus let out a cold laugh and said, "Keep going; this is just the beginning."

As she spoke, she pulled the rag out of Green Tea's mouth and pressed her dagger against the vulnerable pulsating artery in her neck. 

"There's no more room; I can't give you anything else!" Green Tea gasped, wincing in pain. Though her mind was filled with venomous words, she had no choice but to swallow them down, replacing them with a feeble, pitiful expression.

Ice Lotus could see right through her act. With a wave of her hand, she collected all the supplies into her space, her voice icy as she said, "There's space now; keep going."

Green Tea's eyes widened in shock. She had never expected Ice Lotus to be a space-type ability user—wasn't she supposed to be an ice-type? The realization that she was a dual-ability powerhouse sent a wave of jealousy flooding through her, making her head spin. How unfair fate seemed!

Once confident in her worth, Green Tea now felt utterly defeated, her inner torment far worse than her physical pain. 

Ice Lotus, however, gave her no time to wallow. She began a countdown.

Green Tea had always been able to bend and adapt. Her injuries were not severe, and with a healing-type ability user by Fu's side, recovery was merely a matter of time. The most important thing was to survive long enough for someone to notice that something was wrong and come to her rescue. She could not afford to die. 

With that thought, Green Tea released an entire room's worth of supplies, but Ice Lotus simply waved her hand, collecting everything again. 

Green Tea was left with no choice, putting on a weak and helpless facade, clearly stalling for time. Ice Lotus, seeing through this, made a move as if to slash her face, gesturing while saying, "My dagger is imbued with ice abilities. If you find someone to heal you quickly, there's still a chance to recover fully. But if we drag this out, your wound will freeze, damaging the tissue beneath the skin. Even if you do get treatment, you’ll be left with ugly scars, and it could even fester!"

With that, she cheerfully demonstrated the frost covering her dagger, the chill palpable as it neared Green Tea's skin.

Green Tea had no time to think; fearing the prospect of becoming disfigured, she hastily released her abilities, filling the room with supplies once more. Ice Lotus, in the next moment, was ready to clear it all out again until Green Tea cried out, "There's nothing left! Everything in my space is yours!"

Ice Lotus smirked, pressing the dagger closer, her voice laced with frost. "You glanced away for a second; it's clear you’re lying. It seems these things are more important to you than your beauty or the child in your womb. What a pity; the future heir of the Kunshan base won't have the luck after all."

With that, she aimed to stab Green Tea in the stomach, causing her to shout for her to stop, fearing that a loud cry would draw the guards and lead to her quick demise. 

"Promise me you’ll let me go after I give you the things. Swear it!" Green Tea was still struggling with her final thoughts, but Ice Lotus ignored her, the frost-covered dagger gliding over her collarbone.

Green Tea immediately felt a sharp, icy pain shoot through her, realizing that if it grazed her face, it would leave an incurable mark.

Giving up her last hesitation, Green Tea unleashed her powers. Ice Lotus was taken aback when she saw what emerged: weapons—military arms, missiles even!

As Green Tea produced more and more items, Ice Lotus could hardly contain her shock. What a gamble Fu had taken, leaving such crucial items with a woman so fearful of death and obsessed with beauty. 

"Ten chances to win, nine to lose," Ice Lotus thought bitterly.

Watching Green Tea hoard such valuable resources, Ice Lotus couldn't help but wonder why she was clinging to her identity as the young mistress of the Fu family instead of rising up as a queen herself. Had she become so used to relying on men that she no longer knew how to stand on her own?

In the end, despite Ice Lotus's relentless slashes, Green Tea continued to insist there was nothing left. Only then did Ice Lotus retract her hand.

Seeing Ice Lotus put away the dagger without another word, Green Tea rushed toward the door, a glimmer of hope igniting in her eyes. But just as Ice Lotus reached for the doorknob, a barrage of ice needles erupted, leaving Green Tea with no escape. She could only accept her fate as she was pierced through, her life extinguished in bitter despair.

Ice Lotus turned back to scrutinize the scene of Green Tea's demise. The ice needles had turned her into a sieve, blood flowing but not in torrents. The fatal blow had been to her brain, with her heart punctured as well. The freezing temperatures of the ice needles had likely slowed the blood's escape, making the sight less gruesome at first glance, but upon closer inspection, the insides were nothing but a shattered mess.

At last, she could make amends for her past life.

Just as she finished setting up explosives in the room, intending to blow it all up, an explosion echoed nearby. Ice Lotus was startled; someone would soon come to investigate. Without hesitation, she leapt out the window.

At this moment, the Kunshan base's military forces were primarily focused on the ceremony site and two warehouses. The ambushers at the warehouse would certainly be many, and Ice Lotus needed to avoid these hotspots, waiting for the right moment to strike.

It seemed that Green Tea's minimal guards were intentional on Fu’s part, ensuring that their operations remained discreet, lest they attract unwanted attention.

She had only dealt with Green Tea, while the Fu father and son remained unharmed. Moreover, she needed to verify if Fu, as Xie had said, was indeed invulnerable.

This time, she needed a definitive outcome.

Most of the people in the villa area had gone to the hall for the engagement ceremony, allowing Ice Lotus to hide in an unoccupied villa. She found a window that provided a clear view of Green Tea's villa entrance and set up a rocket launcher.

Explosions sounded several times as Ice Lotus detonated the explosives she had planted in Green Tea's room. She was confident that regardless of where the explosions occurred, Fu would prioritize coming here.

Sure enough, within five minutes, Fu arrived at the villa entrance in a car, where flames were already raging. Watching his frantic efforts to command ability users to extinguish the fire, Ice Lotus felt a surge of excitement coursing through her. The scoundrel had arrived; he wouldn’t be leaving now.

With a blank expression, Ice Lotus fired a rocket directly at Fu's location.

The explosion rocked the villa, and she could feel the shockwaves reverberating through the building. Quickly, she slipped into her space, counting two minutes before stepping back out.

The villa's windows shattered, the walls cracked from the blast. Most of it had already collapsed, leaving only a few fragments of wall standing.

Patiently, she waited for a result. Among those who had been present, only a few ability users managed to shield themselves with abilities, but they too were thrown to the ground by the force of the explosion, uncertain of their fates.

Ice Lotus coldly observed, hoping to find any trace of Fu—a fragment of flesh, a piece of clothing, anything that could confirm his presence. Surely, a direct hit wouldn't leave nothing behind?

When Fu Dingjin arrived with reinforcements, there was still no sign of Fu, and Ice Lotus finally understood that something was off. It seemed Fu had some sort of protective measure, akin to a space ability, shielding him from fatal harm at critical moments.

This realization left her feeling powerless, yet a voice within urged her to uncover the secrets surrounding him. No matter what kind of protective measure he had, she would strip it away.

Since she couldn't kill him, she would kill his son. Another rocket was launched.

Caught off guard, Fu Dingjin was directly hit by the explosion.

Ice Lotus once again slipped into her space, expressionless as she counted two minutes before emerging. This time, the villa had collapsed halfway, and in the fiery glow, she clearly saw Fu Dingjin reduced to a horrific sight, his head barely attached to his shoulders, the rest of him gone.

With a sigh of relief, she stowed away the rocket launcher and swaggered out of the villa. The Kunshan base was in chaos, with explosions still ringing in the distance, relieving some pressure from her side.

She casually hopped into a jeep at the villa entrance and began to drive around the Kunshan base. Though she should have left immediately with her spoils, she felt unsatisfied. She sensed that Fu was still somewhere in the base and wanted to test if his protective measure had any cooldowns.

If he did have a cooldown, capturing him again would mean he had nowhere to run and would surely meet his end.
