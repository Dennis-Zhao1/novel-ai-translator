**Hooking the Big Fish**

While everyone was still munching on snacks and enjoying the show, a bombshell dropped: Luo Bingtin announced her intention to sell shares of Mingzhu Group. 

Instantly, the news sent shockwaves through the elite circles of Beijing. Many immediately thought of the Zhu family, confirming that the rumors were indeed true. Guests at the Zhao family’s soirée quickly began to excuse themselves, leaving the once-bustling banquet hall deserted except for the family’s staff cleaning up.

“The youngest son of the Zhu family is quite the ruthless player,” murmured the head of the Zhao family to himself. 

After downing the last of his drink, he summoned his driver and headed straight for the office. 

That night was destined to be a sleepless one for the business bigwigs of Beijing, with the exception of a few key players in the Luo and Zhu families’ power circles. 

In the eastern villa district, Fu Buqi, trapped in a relentless barrage of calls from his father-in-law, finally snapped and shut off his phone. He slammed on the accelerator, pushing the speed limit as he raced to his father-in-law's house.

As a son-in-law, he was acutely aware of his place in the family hierarchy. Even after twenty years, no matter how much he resented it, he never let it show. 

Before stepping inside, Fu Buqi took a moment to gather his thoughts and straighten his slightly loosened tie. He greeted the elderly man seated on the living room sofa with a warm smile. 

“Grandpa, I’m back.” 

The other guests in the room barely glanced at him, exchanging polite nods as they continued their discussions, exuding an air of refined gentlemanliness. 

The old man, dressed in a traditional Tang suit with silver hair and bright eyes, gave Fu Buqi a cursory look before gesturing to the sofa beside him with a nod. 

“Sit.” 

His tone was dismissive, showing no sign of respect for outsiders. Once seated, Fu Buqi kept his head down, choosing not to speak first; this was just how things were in gatherings like this. 

“Buqi, we just got word that the Luo family is selling shares of Mingzhu Group,” the old man said, his voice low yet commanding. 

Fu Buqi’s eyes widened in shock as he looked up at his father-in-law. This was news he hadn’t heard before. Given his understanding of Mingzhu Group and the Luo family, this wasn’t something that should be happening right now. 

Unfazed by Fu Buqi’s reaction, the old man continued, issuing orders like a general. 

“You and Changsheng need to buy up as many shares as you can. Do it quickly.” 

A cold shiver ran down Fu Buqi’s spine; something felt off about this situation, though he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. Changsheng handed him a dossier, and Fu Buqi quickly skimmed through the pages. 

So, it was the Zhu family making a move. That explained everything. 

But from what he knew, the Zhu family and the Luo family weren’t supposed to be in direct conflict—especially considering the friendship between the two elder patriarchs, which was well-known throughout their circles. Furrowing his brow in thought, Changsheng seemed to read his mind. 

“Cousin, the old patriarch of the Zhu family is in critical condition in the ICU.” 

That made sense; it all started to fall into place. 

“Get moving. Timing is everything. This needs to be handled swiftly.” With that, the old man stood and headed upstairs, leaving the two men to follow his orders. 

“Yes, Grandpa, Uncle,” they replied in unison, rising to their feet. 

Changsheng quickly rounded up his team as he and Fu Buqi began making rapid arrangements to execute their plan. 

Meanwhile, at Yunding Fenghua Apartments, Luo Bingtin had just finished organizing her space for the day, panting from the effort. 

“Help! Having such a vast space isn’t all it’s cracked up to be,” she lamented, realizing that even riding her little electric scooter from one end to the other took ages. “I need to hire someone to help with all this moving around. Since when have I ever been the one to do all this heavy lifting?”

After discovering the space was filled with mountains, rivers, and trees, her vision of it had completely transformed from barren plains to a vibrant landscape. 

Driven by her perfectionist tendencies, she began dividing the area into sections, intending to organize all her supplies and equipment neatly. Otherwise, it would be a chaotic mess, making it cumbersome to retrieve what she needed.

Now, if she wanted something quickly, it had to be easily accessible, just like the last time when she needed her handgun. 

“This is so inefficient,” Luo Bingtin sighed, wishing her space had a system like the inventory settings in the online games she used to play, allowing her to customize the layout. 

Just then, she noticed that the text on the mirror had changed, as if it were trying to communicate with her. 

“Space upgrade requires spirit stones.” 

Luo Bingtin pouted at the mention of spirit stones, recalling how they were precious ancient jades from the Spring and Autumn period—worth a fortune and impossible to price. 

Glancing at the towering pile of supplies, she felt a wave of defeat wash over her. An upgrade was crucial, but where would she find spirit stones to “feed” her space? She couldn’t very well go tomb raiding in another province. 

“If only I had a spirit stone mine,” she mused, lying back on the grass and watching the clouds drift by. 

A mine? I actually do have one! Didn’t Myanmar have mines? 

Excitedly sitting up, she looked at the mirror. “Would you accept jade from Myanmar?” 

The mirror replied, “All spirit stones are acceptable.” 

Luo Bingtin then pulled out the pile of jade jewelry she had captured from Fu Buqi last time, showing it off to the mirror. 

“Would you take these?” 

The mirror responded, “Lacks spirit energy; useless items.” 

Luo Bingtin rolled her eyes, annoyed. “What do you know? These are top-quality jades from Myanmar, the old pit variety, emperor green! You just don’t appreciate fine things!” 

Seeing the space’s lack of interest in such valuable items left her feeling conflicted. On one hand, she was glad to keep or even sell them; on the other, she was stressed about where to find “food” for her space. 

If only I could eat the black market goods, she thought, her eyes lighting up with a spark of inspiration. 

With someone like Fu Buqi around, there had to be more like him. Plus, with her divination skills and her spirit energy having elevated a level during the last upgrade, she could use those abilities as a detection tool. 

With that thought, her anxiety vanished, and she nearly struck a pose, proud of her cleverness. 

Dreaming of the next upgrade featuring an auto-organizing function, Luo Bingtin temporarily shelved her perfectionist tendencies and focused on her next steps. 

The news of Mingzhu Group’s impending sale had already spread far and wide; everyone who needed to know was aware, except for the Zhu family. The connections her grandfather had left behind were reaching out, but unfortunately, they weren’t from Beijing’s elite—one was from an ancient city, and the other a fading military family. 

Luo Bingtin subtly hinted that she could handle things on her end, sending a resource list to the contacts, just in case. 

That was all she could do for now. She deliberately turned off her phone, having worked hard in her space all afternoon, and was exhausted. After a good night’s sleep, she woke up around ten the next morning. 

Turning her phone back on, it immediately lagged with notifications—calls and messages flooding in, many from familiar yet unfamiliar numbers. 

She skimmed through the messages but mostly focused on identifying who had reached out, finding that many were from friends in her business circle probing her for information, which she deemed less important. 

After a quick breakfast, she drove to the office. As soon as she stepped out of the car, a group of familiar faces from the recent business soirée surrounded her. 

Feigning surprise, Luo Bingtin greeted her elders and ushered them into the company, leading them directly to the conference room. 

While her secretary busied herself with refreshments, Luo Bingtin discreetly pulled out her phone to post a picture on her social media feed.
