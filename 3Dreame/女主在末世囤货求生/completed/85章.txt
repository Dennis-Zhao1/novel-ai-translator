Her Plans

The physical fitness of the special forces indeed surpassed that of ordinary people. The Zheng family had already taken a break for two rounds, and if it weren't for Luo Bingtin's relentless daily training, she would have struggled to keep going by now.

Brother Meng was controlling two uniquely designed metallic constructs that ruthlessly harvested zombies. The attack method of his metal-based abilities was somewhat similar to her own; he could manipulate metal to change its trajectory and use it as a hidden weapon. However, he didn’t generate metal from within himself but instead utilized the existing metal around them. No wonder Brother Meng had specifically asked the Zheng family to provide him with two metal shuttles. The way he controlled them had an oddly pleasing aesthetic.

At this moment, Xie Jinghang still stood out as the strongest among them, and Luo Bingtin keenly noticed his ability to precisely control the release of his powers. The lightning strikes he summoned landed with remarkable accuracy, hitting the zombies' brains directly without causing collateral damage.

She realized that his impressive endurance stemmed from this precise control, and she began to understand it better. Following his example, she tried compressing three ice spikes into one, boosting the speed of her instant release. After practicing this a few times, she saw significant improvements. Nothing made Luo Bingtin happier than enhancing her own strength.

Meanwhile, her teammates, who were recovering their abilities, weren’t idle either. They were tasked with dispatching the zombies, creating an efficient assembly line. If it weren't for Luo Bingtin's innovative approaches to practicing her powers and validating her methods, this monotonous work would have been too easy to dull the senses.

The ones digging into the zombies' heads likely shared similar thoughts. Who would want to remain bent over, rummaging through those yellowish, red-stained, foul-smelling remains if it weren't for the purpose of obtaining crystal cores?

The teammate whose water abilities were used to rinse the cores probably felt a sense of depletion, thinking, "I’m completely drained, wrung out..."

The harvest in the high-rise complex was quite good. By the end of the day, they had collected over three hundred crystal cores after clearing three units. As darkness fell, they decided not to return to the stronghold. Brother Meng sealed the rooftop door with his abilities.

Luo Bingtin watched curiously, feeling as if Brother Meng had transformed into a skilled welder; that door was really well sealed!

Several earth-type ability users built an earthen wall to fortify the door and the surrounding walls, providing double protection. They no longer had to worry about water or firewood. Luo Bingtin mused that if it were summer, she could have prepared ice for everyone, and Anmin could fan them with a cool breeze.

After finishing their tasks, it was time for dinner. Luo Bingtin was reluctant to eat the same dry, tasteless compressed biscuits from lunch; their overly sweet taste dulled her palate.

She pulled out an aluminum pot from her backpack and had Anmin fetch some canned meat. Brother Meng brought out a large bag of pasta. Using her water abilities, she filled the pot with water, while a fire-type teammate eagerly started the fire. They set up the pot on the rooftop, planning to make meat sauce pasta.

Disposable bowls and chopsticks were distributed, and Brother Meng and Aunt Zheng took on the role of chefs while the rest of them eagerly watched, their mouths watering. It may have been simple, but it smelled amazing, especially the aroma of the canned meat heating up in the pot—absolutely divine.

They boiled three pots of pasta before enough was prepared for everyone. Anmin and his dad took it upon themselves to wash the pots and clean up. They didn’t let Luo Bingtin lift a finger, allowing her to rest her chin on her hand, observing the busy men. It was nice; she had more important matters to attend to.

Spreading her backpack across her lap, she sorted through the more than three hundred crystal cores they had collected that day, categorizing them by attributes and tallying the number of non-attribute cores.

When everyone had finished and gathered around again, Luo Bingtin began distributing the crystal cores. Xie Jinghang had never seen such a distribution method before. In his past life, he had only received rewards after completing tasks, and crystal cores usually had to be earned through personal effort. Collective resources were rarely evenly shared.

However, he kept his thoughts to himself, recognizing that she must have her reasons for doing so.

This time, there weren’t many attribute crystal cores; splitting them among the three earth-type users left them with very little. The most abundant were the blue cores belonging to the water-type abilities, but their combat effectiveness hadn’t yet been demonstrated. Apart from relying on physical strength and weapons, they couldn't kill zombies using just their water abilities.

Luo Bingtin wasn't worried, though; once the water abilities leveled up, they would become formidable. Besides, they truly needed a strong water source to help wash the cores.

Because there were too few earth-type attribute cores, the non-attribute cores were redistributed, ensuring everyone was satisfied and that the distribution was fair.

Luo Bingtin had yet to collect any ice-type crystal cores; she even doubted if they existed. Staring at her pile of non-attribute cores, she felt distressed, wondering when she would be able to upgrade.

Xie Jinghang shared her predicament, but he understood that no matter how many low-level zombies he defeated, he wouldn’t obtain mutated cores because they needed to level up too. Once they reached intermediate status, corresponding cores would emerge.

After scheduling three shifts for night watch, they spent a calm night without incident. The following days continued with the same routine of killing zombies, extracting cores, and rinsing them in an assembly line process.

They managed to clear an entire complex of zombies, surpassing a total of twelve hundred crystal cores. That night, Luo Bingtin started distributing the cores before dinner. The proportion of attribute cores remained low, but at least there were some.

After the distribution, everyone was in high spirits. With this new influx, the team's overall strength should improve significantly. Even Aunt Zheng, who had once been terrified of zombies, could now expressionlessly ensnare them using her wood abilities.

Xie Jinghang treated this mission as a training exercise, correcting positioning, movement, and coordination during the cleanup, with Brother Meng assisting him. They were almost ready to practice formations.

On the last night in the high-rise complex, Luo Bingtin leaned against the railing, gazing into the distance. In reality, there were no lights; the darkness was thick like spilled ink, devoid of stars.

Xie Jinghang approached her and stood beside her, following her gaze. After a moment, he said, “You’re so quick to distribute the crystal cores? Aren’t you afraid of raising their expectations?”

Luo Bingtin turned to look at him, smiling as she replied, “Raising their expectations isn’t ideal, but I want them to understand that following me is the right choice. There aren’t many generous bosses like me. What I can offer, others can’t. If they want more, they need to contribute more. Even if they decide to leave, I won’t be at a loss.”

“A true businessman never makes a losing deal. What about the Zhu family?” 

Luo Bingtin pondered for a moment about the Zhu family, which appeared calm on the surface but was rife with undercurrents. She smiled nonchalantly. “Allies need to possess a certain strength to be considered allies. If they can’t be allies, they can be subordinates. Just like before, no one can permanently hold the leading position. Now, positions can change, and that’s fine. As for the other pests, whether I take action or not, they will be crushed one by one.”

Xie Jinghang nodded, chuckling, but then he seemed to remember something. “Regarding the chaos at the Maple Forest base, Fu Buqi is convinced I’m behind it. I’ve taken a huge fall for you.”

Luo Bingtin raised her eyebrows in surprise. She had thought she had been exposed from the very beginning, especially since Sister Li had recognized her right away. With Fu Buqi's cautious and suspicious nature, how could he attribute it to Xie Jinghang?

Ah, that’s right. In this life, they hadn’t had any interactions yet; they hadn’t even met. When he betrayed the Luo family, she hadn’t existed. His eldest son had been shot while capturing Xie Jinghang, so it made more sense for him to suspect him.

She chuckled lightly and said, “Are you afraid? Then find a way to get rid of him. I don’t believe he can escape every time.”

“Yeah, I don’t believe that either.”
