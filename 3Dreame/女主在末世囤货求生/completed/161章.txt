**Disappearance**

They had headed straight up the mountain without searching along the S-line at all. Their team leader, a powerful ability user known as Brother Meng, had insisted that his intuition was guiding him to continue climbing higher. The other team members didn’t object, dutifully scrambling up the slope until they reached near the summit, only to find nothing—no exits, no holes, absolutely nothing.

It was unexpected when they prepared to descend and retrieve their vehicle, only to be ambushed. In his words, “It was like being surrounded by a swarm of sea anemones.” 

The captain, a fire-type ability user, immediately unleashed a series of powerful attacks, creating a fiery barrier that deterred those strange creatures from getting too close. However, another team member, a new ability user who hadn’t had much combat experience, got nervous and accidentally triggered a distress signal flare.

With no time to scold him, the captain shouted for them to fight together against the monsters. The injured member joined them, and the three of them managed to hold their ground for a while. But eventually, their powers waned, and they were overwhelmed. The captain barely managed to break free, but before he could escape down the mountain, he collapsed from exhaustion.

Lo Bingting examined him carefully; his wounds were minor. The lake water had proven useful, potentially saving his life at a critical moment. 

“What about your team leader?” she asked.

Suddenly, the injured man burst into tears, clearly haunted by terrifying memories. Lo Bingting didn’t want to wait for him to calm down; she set her sights on the mountaintop and began walking up.

Using her mental energy, she sensed the surroundings. It struck her as odd—why was it so eerily quiet at the peak? As she approached, her heart raced, and even with all she had seen, a wave of nausea washed over her.

At the summit, a cluster of red mutated plants had taken root, towering over her compared to what they had encountered before. In the center of this grotesque growth lay two skeletons, alongside scraps of tattered clothing—evidence that this was the remains of the squad’s leader and another member.

The injured man couldn’t hold back his sobs and crumpled to the ground, utterly pitiful. Lo Bingting felt a surge of anger; she had poured resources into cultivating these abilities with Brother Meng, only for them to be mercilessly killed by these wretched plants.

“Ro Fan, uproot all these mutated plants!” she commanded, her voice sharp. She then unleashed her air cannon, obliterating the grotesque flora into tiny pieces.

Wang Xinxin and the younger members turned pale, shocked to learn that these mutated plants could eat people. The bones were devoid of any flesh, ghastly pale and eerie.

After swiftly dealing with the scene, Lo Bingting immediately launched a signal flare to gather her team. There was no time for hesitation; she could no longer bear the thought of losing any more ability users.

“Host, are you going to exchange these small crystal cores for points?” the system asked.

“Not right now. I don’t need anything,” she replied tersely.

“How can you not need anything? I applied for higher permissions with the mainframe today, and I can unlock even more treasures. Are you sure you don’t want to check it out?” The system's voice had a coaxing tone, and Lo Bingting couldn’t help but think that this noisy system would make a fantastic salesperson.

Sure enough, the system shop had updated. Previously, it had mainly weapons, but now there were more expensive items, including vehicles, ships, tanks—ridiculously, even aircraft carriers and UFOs! She wouldn’t be surprised if one day the system claimed they had a space station.

While Lo Bingting anxiously awaited the others to gather, the injured ability user sat in a daze, utterly defeated after crying his heart out. Wang Xinxin attempted to console him but stopped when she realized he was unresponsive. With a sigh, she turned and sat on a large rock beside Lo Bingting.

Ro Fan had uprooted all the visible mutated plants, and Lo Bingting blasted them to smithereens, venting her frustration and despair. She couldn’t shake the thought of how the families of these two fallen members would react upon learning of their deaths.

Soon, Uncle Zhu led a team to find Lo Bingting. He scrutinized her for a long moment before finally relaxing when he realized she was unharmed.

He quickly explained what had happened, and his jaw dropped in disbelief. Pei Qian and others arrived one after another, and they too were stunned at the sight of the two skeletons.

Noticing Lo Bingting’s low spirits, Uncle Zhu immediately leveraged his position to organize their next steps. However, the last group was still unaccounted for. When Lo Bingting inquired, she learned they were led by the guard captain.

Uncle Zhu pulled out a map and circled the guard captain’s location before leading everyone in that direction, hoping that nothing serious had transpired.

They carefully gathered the bones, wrapping them in white cloth and placing them in bags to take with them. A large group of them descended the mountain, heading toward the northwest mountain region where the guard captain was supposed to be searching.

“Don’t panic; there’s probably nothing wrong,” Xie Jinghang reassured them. He had given his car to Uncle Zhu, and they were all crammed inside, along with Pei Qian and Pei Shang.

“What kind of things did you encounter? Mutated plants?” Pei Qian asked.

“Yeah, a type of mutated plant. There were crystal cores as well, but they were small and hard to spot,” replied Lo Bingting.

Pei Qian nodded, and the group fell silent until they reached the guard captain’s vehicle location.

“Follow your captain up the mountain in an orderly fashion. If you encounter danger, shout out a warning. And don’t be afraid; we’re all here,” Lo Bingting instructed as they began ascending. She used her mental energy to scan for any signs of life.

Strangely enough, the team led by the guard captain was nowhere to be found. The footprints on the ground led to a large tree, then abruptly disappeared. 

Lo Bingting felt a sense of dread creeping in; her stomach tightened with anxiety. 

“No abnormalities detected, Miss Lo,” Pei Qian said softly as he approached her.

“Do you think it’s possible one of your subordinates has defected?” he asked.

Lo Bingting shook her head firmly. “That’s unlikely. The guard team has a deep bond with the fortress; it’s not something that could just change.”

She wasn’t sure what had happened, but she wasn’t willing to leave it be. 

“Is it possible they’re still alive, somewhere on this mountain, and we just haven’t found them yet?” Xie Jinghang suddenly suggested as he stood beside her.

Lo Bingting forced a bitter smile; she could only comfort herself with that notion…

As daylight faded into darkness, they had to return. The loss of two team members and the disappearance of three was a heavy blow for Lo Bingting. 

After confirming that Brother Meng was safe, she prepared to lead her people back to the fortress, planning to return the next day to investigate further.

“Miss Lo, over here!” A voice called from the distance. It was An Min. Lo Bingting hurried over to see what was happening.

There were bloodstains on the ground, and signs of a struggle. Her heart leaped with hope as she followed the footprints.

The blood droplets were faint in the grass, making it easy to lose track of them, but finally, in a concealed spot, they discovered something unexpected.

Not the three missing individuals, but a massive natural cave.

“Could this be the exit to the pit?” Lo Bingting asked, her curiosity piqued.

“We won’t know until we go in,” Xie Jinghang replied, giving her shoulder a reassuring pat before leading their teammates inside.
