**Snatching People from Me**

As they approached the front gate—less than a hundred meters away—it was time for them to part ways with the others. 

Luo Bingtin stood on the first floor of the management office, discussing the upcoming arrangements with Uncle Zhu and the research team—how to travel, who to accompany, and so on. The outside world was too perilous; the researchers who originally planned to go home were now too afraid to act alone. Most of them were from out of town and couldn’t return home anyway, so Uncle Zhu decided that all researchers would follow him.

Suddenly, Xie Jinghang interjected, “Dr. Zhu and Dr. Zhang must come with us.”

Luo Bingtin was taken aback and retorted, “Why should they?”

With a smirk that didn’t reach his eyes, Xie Jinghang addressed Uncle Zhu, “Dr. Zhu, you should know how high the military district’s expectations and support for you are. If you come with us, your research can continue. The military’s backing is important for you, right?”

Luo Bingtin felt furious at being so blatantly ignored and belittled. Old grudges flared up like wildfire, igniting her heart with rage. “Are you trying to snatch people from me?”

Xie Jinghang didn’t even spare her a glance, focusing instead on Uncle Zhu with a not-so-kind smile. Uncle Zhu felt a bit awkward; he had indeed relied heavily on the military’s support for resources and funding. But looking at his children, who had risked their lives to come save him, and thinking of his elderly father waiting anxiously for his safe return, he hesitated.

Luo Bingtin suddenly smiled and said to Uncle Zhu, “Uncle, Grandpa is still waiting for you at home! The lab is all set up. Our home is spacious, with water, electricity, food, and drink—all provided by family. You can conduct your research there; why must you follow strangers?”

Aunt Zhu, hearing this, grasped her husband’s hand tightly. In this apocalyptic world, what research could possibly be more important than being safe with family? Her firm grip expressed her thoughts clearly, and their children’s eyes were glued to Uncle Zhu, fearful he might choose to go with Xie Jinghang.

Closing his eyes, Uncle Zhu finally made up his mind and said apologetically to Xie Jinghang, “I’m sorry, Captain Xie. In times like these, I just want to be with my family. However, if my research results are ready, I will find a way to contact you; the results will still be delivered to the military district.”

Xie Jinghang fell silent, contemplating whether it was worth forcibly taking them or letting them go. Luo Bingtin’s claims about their home having water, electricity, and food made him suspicious. How could they have prepared so quickly for the apocalypse? 

Could it be? No, he quickly dismissed the thought; that was too outrageous. It was more likely a fabrication or exaggeration from Luo Bingtin, possibly a desperate attempt to persuade Dr. Zhu to stay. The food and drink might be true, but water and electricity? Maybe, but a lab? Not necessarily.

Worried that others might not believe her, Luo Bingtin pulled out her phone and quickly showed photos of their experimental lab in the fortress, flipping through them for the researchers to see her claims were genuine. Xie Jinghang caught a glance but felt it was too quick to verify its authenticity.

Seeing that Xie Jinghang neither agreed nor disagreed, Dr. Zhu grew anxious. He knew the lab situation well. The equipment and instruments were all listed by him for his family to procure. He added, “The military district isn’t forcing me to come, right? If that’s the case, then we’ll be leaving now.” He nodded at Xie Jinghang and stood up to leave.

Luo Bingtin felt triumphant for once, happily getting up to open the door for Dr. Zhu while the others followed with their documents. 

Xie Jinghang raised his hand but let it fall again, realizing that forcibly taking them back would only lead to resistance. They might be physically present, but mentally they’d be elsewhere, and cooperation would be minimal. Just then, he had a thought and rushed after them. “Dr. Zhu, I accept your proposal on behalf of the military, but you need to provide me your address so I can find you.”

Uncle Zhu looked toward Luo Bingtin, who gave an indifferent nod. Tell him; he can’t do anything to us. Once back, we’ll set up defenses, and we won’t be afraid of anyone. 

After receiving the address, Xie Jinghang watched them board the bus, his mind running through the earlier doubts again. Could it be true? 

Before getting onto the bus, Luo Bingtin asked Liu Xiaohui, who had been following them, “Are you coming back with us, or do you have another destination?”

After a moment’s thought, Liu Xiaohui replied, “Could you drop me off at the neighborhood near the highway entrance? My home is there, and my parents are still waiting for me to come back.”

She still clutched the mop handle that Luo Bingtin had sharpened for her. 

Luo Bingtin couldn’t bear to shatter her hopes, so she nodded and let her into her vehicle. After informing Meng Ge, they set off. 

The survivors saved by Xie Jinghang were also tempted by the mention of water, electricity, and food, but they were more urgently hoping to reunite with their families. 

Xie Jinghang watched the last four people trail behind as they fetched their vehicle to prepare for departure. 

The return journey was smooth; approaching Aerospace City, the area was sparsely populated, and there were few vehicles. Luo Bingtin drove at a good speed. She hadn’t rested well the night before and desperately needed to lie down on her big bed for a good sleep.

In just half an hour, they arrived at the neighborhood where Liu Xiaohui lived. From a distance, they could see many zombies wandering inside. 

Not knowing if there were survivors, Luo Bingtin could read the unease on Liu Xiaohui’s face and didn’t let her get out of the car recklessly. 

She sat in the passenger seat, carefully observing. Suddenly, she covered her mouth and burst into tears. 

Luo Bingtin understood immediately what had happened. She quickly pulled out two tissues and handed them to her. 

Anmin felt the weight of the situation too; she must have seen her family, and now her home was gone. 

Thinking of her own family safe in the fortress, Anmin felt grateful for her grandfather’s wise decision. Their family was truly fortunate. 

After crying for a while, Luo Bingtin gently spoke, “If you have nowhere to go, you can come with us. We have work for you, and we provide housing and meals.”

Liu Xiaohui nodded, looking back one last time through tear-filled eyes before lowering her head. “Let’s go.” 

Luo Bingtin’s heart grew heavy as she drove back; she, too, had lost her family in this world. 

The journey was filled with silence until they reached the second highway entrance. 

This time, the situation was far worse than when they had come. A bus was blocking the highway entrance, obstructing two lanes. 

The direction of travel was different than before, and the road conditions had worsened since yesterday. 

It seemed that the survivors on the bus had encountered a mutated person while escaping, leading to a chaotic scene inside the bus that resulted in an accident. 

Luo Bingtin felt a headache coming on as she stopped the vehicle not far from the bus. What were they going to do now? 

The least congested lane had at least seven or eight vehicles crashed together, and there were even more around the bus. 

She could see the zombies inside the bus becoming agitated upon spotting them. 

Meng Ge followed closely behind and parked as well, using the walkie-talkie to inquire about the situation. 

Faced with such a dilemma, Luo Bingtin could only think of a simple and brutal solution. 

While everyone was at a loss, Meng Ge brought good news. 

One of the researchers on their vehicle loved motorcycles and often raced on the outer ring road. They didn’t necessarily have to exit through the toll gate; they could take the side road blocked by water barricades. 

Taking the old road was sure to have better conditions than this. 

Luo Bingtin was overjoyed and drove over. Sure enough, from a distance, there was a road with only a row of water barricades blocking it, and no vehicles were in sight. 

After letting people out of the car, Luo Bingtin eliminated the few zombies lingering around and moved the barricades aside. 

This was probably the one pleasant experience in this frustrating mission.
