The Zombie Apocalypse has Arrived

Uncle Zhu didn’t call; instead, he sent a message to the scattered members of the Zhu family, instructing them to quickly gather at the stronghold. He used the name of the old man, but he wasn't sure how many would actually heed the call. Only the core members of the family were aware of the true situation, while the rest of the family harbored unknown thoughts that were beyond Uncle Zhu’s considerations.

Taking advantage of the time before the outbreak spread widely, Luo Bingtian directly notified Brother Meng to wait in the car at the back of the hospital, ready to move once the message was sent. Meanwhile, while Uncle Zhu and the old man were distracted, she grabbed two unremarkable sticks from her spatial storage that looked like they had been pulled off a broom or mop, handing one to Uncle Zhu.

Before long, Brother Meng texted that he had arrived. Luo Bingtian focused her spiritual energy to scan their level and found no abnormalities for the moment. She subtly nodded to Uncle Zhu, signaling that it was time to prepare for departure.

Just as she unlocked the door, the sound of footsteps approached—more zombies were coming. Luo Bingtian didn’t dare to turn the lock back; in the stillness of the night, the sound of the bolt sliding could be alarmingly loud. They all held their breath, even slowing their heartbeats.

Luo Bingtian initially thought the zombie would quickly move on since this level housed only the old man, but to her surprise, the zombie lingered in the corridor. With keen hearing, she caught screams coming from the opposite building. It was unsafe for Brother Meng to wait in the car downstairs, so they decided to take the initiative and have Grandpa hide in the bathroom while she and Uncle Zhu planned to ambush the zombie.

In her previous life, she lacked any powers, had poor stamina, and no combat skills. However, she heard that early-stage zombies were easy to deal with—essentially, one strike would take them down. It was the evolved zombies that posed a real threat. This saying lingered in her mind; early-stage zombies were similar to ordinary people, not particularly fast, and could be dealt with if one stayed alert. Thus, Luo Bingtian stood behind the door and threw a pen towards the room's window. The sound echoed in the quiet environment like thunder.

Sure enough, the footsteps quickened, drawing closer. Just as the zombie was about to crash through the door, Luo Bingtian sensed its approach, flung the door open, and struck the zombie’s head with the stick, landing a solid blow that made it stagger.

Luo Bingtian was unaware that her physical strength had increased significantly after her spiritual powers were enhanced, giving her much more force than she had before. Seizing the opportunity, Uncle Zhu charged in, following her lead. According to Luo Bingtian, the zombie’s weakness lay in its head; damaging it effectively rendered the zombie incapable of movement.

Not long after, they were panting heavily as they helped Grandpa escape. In the bathroom, they could only hear the sound of impacts outside. When they stepped out and saw the scene before them, even the seasoned Grandpa was taken aback by the horror of the apocalypse. The grotesque, bloodied faces were unrecognizable, and suddenly, Uncle Zhu and his brother truly felt the terror of the end times—and this was just the beginning.

Luo Bingtian led the way with her spiritual energy, Uncle Zhu supporting Grandpa closely behind. Given the urgency of the situation, they had no time to ponder why a young girl like Luo Bingtian was bravely carrying a stick and leading them forward. Uncle Zhu, being a strong adult male, was prepared to either support Grandpa or carry him if necessary, but leaving it all to Luo Bingtian didn’t sit well with him.

Fortunately, there was no one else on this floor. Luo Bingtian hesitated about whether to take the elevator; the rising numbers startled her. No, they had to use the fire escape. She pointed towards the stairs, and the three of them moved quickly.

The reason Luo Bingtian chose the fire escape was that its door could be locked from the inside, providing a level of safety. Although they were on the sixth floor, she couldn’t rule out the possibility of something unexpected happening below.

Securing the locked fire escape was relatively safe; once they reached the first floor, they would be out of danger. Looking down through the gaps in the stairs from the sixth floor, she saw nothing below. After Uncle Zhu and Grandpa entered, she swiftly closed the fire door and secured all the locks, twisting the middle lock an extra two turns for good measure.

They hurried down the stairs, moving quickly towards the fifth floor. Just as they reached the corner, a loud crash echoed from the sixth floor’s fire door, followed by cries for help and groans, which quickly faded into silence.

The three of them froze, startled by the noise. Luo Bingtian took a deep breath and signaled them to keep moving, urging them not to waste any more time. The longer they delayed, the worse the situation would become. The people who had fled had already attracted some of the zombies, and they had to quickly reach the stronghold.

Once again, Luo Bingtian spread her spiritual energy and arrived at the fire escape door to the fifth floor. With quick reflexes, she closed the door and locked it securely. She repeated this process for several floors, and fortunately, it went smoothly; no zombies were near the fire escape from the fifth to the third floors.

Even if there were zombies in the corridors, they were no match for Luo Bingtian’s speed in locking the doors. The zombies would give up if they couldn’t catch up. As they approached the second floor, Luo Bingtian felt a twinge of anxiety. Her spiritual energy detected that the second floor was the busiest, filled with the infusion department, where crowds usually gathered. The third to fifth floors mainly housed doctors’ offices and operating rooms, which were currently empty.

Taking a deep breath, Luo Bingtian concealed herself in the shadows, calming her emotions. The fire escape was equipped with sound-activated lights; if there was no sound, they wouldn’t turn on. This had its advantages and disadvantages. The benefit was that they could hide in darkness and observe, but the downside was that any significant noise, even the sound of footsteps, would trigger the lights, exposing the entire fire escape to the zombies.

As the zombies wandered aimlessly, the eerie silence of the second floor was broken only by the dragging sounds of their movements. Luo Bingtian decided to take a gamble. She prepared to lock the door as quickly as possible and then sprint to the first floor; the risk was equal to the opportunity. Once ready, she swiftly dashed forward, locked the door, and quickly secured it.

The moment the door was locked, the zombies were alerted and began to charge toward the fire escape. The three of them rushed down, knowing that the door could only hold out for so long; they had to leave as quickly as possible.

Luo Bingtian slipped into the shadows of the main hall’s fire escape. The doorway was wide, one side leading to the first-floor lobby, and the other to the street outside. Her spiritual energy detected several zombies on the first floor, but they were scattered and quite far from their position.

Luo Bingtian signaled Uncle Zhu to carry Grandpa and pointed in the direction. She made a countdown gesture, preparing for a simultaneous dash. Just as she counted down to two, a zombie staggered into the doorway, spotting the three of them and letting out a raspy growl as it lunged forward.

Luo Bingtian froze at the sight of the oncoming zombie, unable to move or scream. She watched in horror as the creature drew closer. Suddenly, with a swift motion, Uncle Zhu lunged forward, stabbing a stick into the zombie’s left eye, destroying its brain. The zombie collapsed to the ground, as if its power had been cut off.

Luo Bingtian felt a rush of relief but was also shaken by the close encounter. The three of them exchanged no words, wasting no time on pointless chatter. Uncle Zhu and his brother quickly helped Grandpa, moving stealthily and rapidly toward the back exit of the hospital.
