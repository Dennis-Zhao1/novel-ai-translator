**Revenge is a Dish Best Served Cold**

The moment she laid eyes on him, the echoes of her past surged back—a torrent of pain and humiliation replaying in vivid detail. Even without Meng’s urging, Luo Bingtin would have killed him on sight, for he was one of the sworn enemies she had to eliminate in this life.

He was the man who had tormented her without cause, deceived her love, and betrayed her trust.

Rage blazed in her eyes as her mental powers expanded rapidly.

Meng had been monitoring the battlefield and quickly noticed that Xie Jinghang’s side was at a disadvantage, with many injured teammates and overwhelming force bearing down on them.

He signaled to redistribute their firepower, but before he could speak, several gunshots rang out. Luo Bingtin decisively fired, instantly taking down a few opponents, throwing them into disarray.

Someone shouted, “Xie Jinghang, it’s confirmed that you colluded with outsiders and betrayed us from within. Today, you will die without a doubt!”

The arrogant voice only intensified the fury surging within Luo Bingtin, a molten anger burning like lava, searing her very soul. She envisioned countless tortures, each one more excruciating than the last, that would leave him begging for death.

She fired two more shots toward the source of the taunting voice, pulling the trigger even after her handgun ran dry, her finger mechanically squeezing the trigger.

The opposing side was clearly rattled by her surprise attack, their fire momentarily faltering.

Understanding Luo Bingtin’s unusual state, Meng seized the opportunity amidst the lull in fire and pulled her toward Xie Jinghang’s hiding spot.

They ran while returning fire, providing cover. Meng shouted her name several times, trying to snap her out of her rage.

Unaware of how deeply her old grievances burned, Luo Bingtin’s eyes were bloodshot, her movements robotic as she reloaded and shot back.

Meng, though puzzled by her intensity, recognized her cold demeanor and precise shooting skills. He decided to let her be while he checked on Xie Jinghang’s situation.

At first glance, Xie Jinghang seemed fine, though a few of his teammates bore wounds of varying severity. Meng realized his backpack was still in the truck, now engulfed in flames from the explosion, leaving them with nothing.

Once Luo Bingtin emptied her magazine, the burning sensation in her chest eased slightly. She turned to see Meng scratching his head in frustration, unsure of how to proceed. Without hesitation, she yanked her backpack off her back and held it against her chest, rummaging through it for medical supplies and equipment.

Meng knew she was meticulous, always packing a large backpack full of items for their missions—medications, weapons, and even extra rations. Little did he know that the backpack was just a facade, its hard outline hiding a spatial storage that allowed her to retrieve what she truly needed instantly.

When she pulled out adrenaline syringes, Xie Jinghang’s usually stoic face cracked, surprise flickering across his features.

Meng took the syringe and swiftly injected it into the arm of the most critically injured teammate, whose face had turned ashen. The lab-produced syringe was user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to administer.

They had plenty of useful items, and as Xie Jinghang watched, he yanked off his empty magazine and replaced it with a new one from his pocket.

With someone aiding his teammates, he needed to capitalize on this opportunity to create some time for them.

Xie Jinghang darted to a different cover, unleashing a hail of bullets at the opposing side while drawing their fire. “Fu Dingjin, you coward! You colluded with outsiders, betraying the base and causing Captain Guo’s death. And now that I’ve uncovered your treachery, you want to silence me? Are you that afraid?”

Without waiting for a reply, he fired again. “Your father is a hypocrite, and you’re no better! You think I don’t have evidence? If you can’t kill me today, tomorrow the base will receive undeniable proof of your betrayal!”

“Kill him! Whoever takes him out will get a promotion and 500 points!”

Fu Dingjin’s face was a mask of cold fury as he roared, “Shut up! Today, we must kill Xie Jinghang! Follow my orders—killing him will promote you three ranks and earn you 2000 points!”

Luo Bingtin felt a sense of camaraderie as she agreed with Xie Jinghang’s insults; the enemy of her enemy was her friend. She felt slightly better about that despicable man.

She swiftly bandaged Xie Jinghang’s teammates. Fortunately, their injuries were mostly superficial. The most severe wounds had been stabilized with adrenaline, and the bleeding was under control.

Luo Bingtin snatched an AK47 from an injured soldier, unconcerned by its empty magazine. She ducked and dashed toward a nearby cover, reloading as she ran.

As the gunfire intensified, she found herself pinned down behind cover, unable to pop her head out. The pressure mounted as she witnessed Xie Jinghang braving the bullets, making her heart race.

He was insane, she thought, observing his chiseled profile, cold as ice, radiating a deadly allure.

Perfect. They had a common enemy, and it was time to fight together.

With determination, Luo Bingtin gestured to Xie Jinghang, and he responded with a nod, their coordination seamless as if they had trained together for years.

They moved forward, covering each other with suppressive fire. Luo Bingtin seized the moment to use her mental powers to lock onto Fu Dingjin’s position, firing a few shots in quick succession.

“Ah…” a scream echoed, but she couldn’t tell if she had hit the bastard.

“Cover me, hurry!”

Now certain it wasn't Fu Dingjin who had been shot—he sounded too confident—Luo Bingtin didn’t dwell on it. The enemy unleashed a barrage, and the two of them were barely holding on.

Finding another cover, she vented her frustration, “I shot a whole magazine at him, but I couldn’t hit the target! That bastard just hides behind others like a coward!”

“He’s that kind of person—sycophantic and treacherous,” Xie Jinghang replied, changing magazines with practiced ease as he inquired, “Do you have a grudge against him too?”

“Can’t I dislike him? He blew up my car! And you share some blame in this too!”

Luo Bingtin couldn’t reveal her past grievances, so she made up an excuse, wrinkling her nose in annoyance.

Xie Jinghang was left speechless; it was a fair point, but all of this had been a series of unfortunate coincidences.

Seizing the moment, Luo Bingtin pressed on, “This mess is entirely your fault. We saved you and your teammates, so you owe me one.”

Xie Jinghang hadn’t anticipated this turn of events and nodded slowly. “Alright, then I owe you one. But remember, you agreed to it. When I ask, you have to comply.”

“What do you want?”

Realizing this could likely backfire, he quickly asked, “What do you want?”

“Nothing comes to mind right now. Let’s deal with that bastard first. Just remember, you owe me one.”

With a lull in the gunfire, Luo Bingtin rolled to a shady corner of the street, signaling to Xie Jinghang again.

He tightened his grip on the trigger, poking his head out to cover her as she dashed toward the side of a building, climbing the stairs.

Xie Jinghang couldn’t help but think that this girl was quite interesting; she always surprised him whenever they met. They could indeed cooperate against a common enemy, he mused.

His thoughts mirrored Luo Bingtin's perspective.

Reaching the rooftop, she retrieved a sniper rifle from her spatial storage. It was clear that a rifle was ill-suited for high-altitude shooting, but she had plenty of weapons at her disposal, including a rocket launcher.

Fortunately, the area had been cleared of zombies before, but with all this noise, they needed to wrap things up quickly or risk being swarmed.

On Fu Dingjin’s side, they were also feeling the pressure. Their ammunition was running low, and they had lost several men without managing to kill Xie Jinghang. Meanwhile, they were being picked off by the enemy’s reinforcements.

“Fu, our ammo is almost gone, and we’ve lost too many brothers. Should we let it go for today?”

“Yeah, the zombies are closing in. It’s like Xie Jinghang has an endless supply of bullets, even though we’re all supposed to have the same ammo supply for these missions,” a puzzled squad leader chimed in.

Fu Dingjin wanted to retreat, but he feared the implications of what Xie Jinghang had just said. He couldn’t imagine how the base commander would react if he saw the evidence of his betrayal—he couldn’t afford that risk.

“Shut up! We must kill Xie Jinghang today. Listen to me—killing him will promote you three ranks and earn you 2000 points.”

His frenzied roar was a clear indication of a cornered rat. It was evident to anyone watching that he was desperate and panicking.

With a tempting reward on the table, some reckless individuals began shooting wildly, leading to an even more intense exchange of fire. Luo Bingtin worried whether Xie Jinghang could hold on.

After climbing six flights of stairs, Luo Bingtin stood on the rooftop terrace. She pulled out her sniper rifle, loaded it, and adjusted her four-times scope.

Taking a deep breath, she found the right angle, aimed, and smoothly pulled the trigger.

“Ugh, without practice, my shooting skills have really gone downhill,” she muttered, watching Fu Dingjin go down, clutching his chest. She had aimed for his head.

As she chambered another round, Fu Dingjin’s nearby men quickly moved to carry him away.

Through her scope, she could see nothing but a flurry of moving bodies, making it hard to target Fu Dingjin again.

Luo Bingtin wanted to fire a few more shots, hoping for some luck, but she spotted a horde of zombies approaching in the distance. Time was running out.

With urgency, she fired one last shot, not caring where it landed, and quickly headed down the stairs. Their vehicle had been destroyed; they needed to find transportation…

The thought only stoked her anger further.
