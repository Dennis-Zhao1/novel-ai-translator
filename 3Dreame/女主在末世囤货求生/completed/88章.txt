**Mastering the Situation**

Luo Bingtin spoke directly, her tone unyielding. “Uncle Zhu, I’ve said it before: a tumor is dangerous not just because of the poison it harbors but because it spreads. Now, it’s time to make the right decision.”

She handed the gun to Uncle Zhu, but before he could take it, a seemingly deranged man lunged at them, snatching the weapon away. He turned it on the bound figures on the ground, firing wildly, especially at Zhu Mingwu, turning him into a sieve. Several bullets struck his head, and he collapsed instantly, lifeless.

Everyone present was taken aback, realizing it was Uncle Zhu's fourth brother. After emptying the magazine, he continued to pull the trigger, his eyes bloodshot as he howled, “Die! Die! Die!”

A few brave cousins rushed to restrain him, but he threw the gun aside and fell to his knees, sobbing uncontrollably. He couldn’t comprehend why, as members of the Zhu family, they were turning on each other, why his only child had to die at their hands.

He felt an overwhelming resentment, questioning why he had been dragged into such chaos, leaving only his child as the casualty. Revenge was all he had left.

In his frenzied shooting spree, Uncle Zhu had killed a few, while the rest lay moaning on the ground, begging for mercy. The family members from the main branch began rounding up all the collateral relatives who had been hiding, including those they once called sisters-in-law, nephews, and nieces. 

There were over twenty people, and upon seeing their husbands, sons, and fathers bound and bloodied, they couldn’t help but shout and curse as they rushed forward. But a fireball from Uncle Zhu silenced them, leaving them frozen in fear.

At that moment, Uncle Zhu’s expression was icy, his face like frost. He regretted being so compliant with family traditions that emphasized prosperity and love within the clan. In this apocalyptic world, anyone could betray anyone else. He had been lost in fantasies of loyalty and adherence to the family code.

Soon, Anmin brought Zhu Erge over. He looked at his sister, covered in injuries with tear-streaked cheeks, and at his older brother, collapsed in her arms, and rushed forward, using his healing abilities to stop the bleeding and mend wounds.

Luo Bingtin organized people to tie up the collateral relatives as well; a family must be whole and united. The main branch looked down at those on the ground, crying and pleading, their hearts tangled in confusion and despair as if they hadn’t yet grasped the enormity of the situation. Uncle Zhu didn’t let them go, standing before them, coldly declaring, “Today, the collateral relatives of the Zhu family rebelled. They first kidnapped the old master, forced me to hand over control of the fortress, falsely accused me of hiding the arsenal and black box, killed the youngest, and injured my eldest nephew and many of us. They are no longer Zhu family members and do not deserve to use the family’s laws. Traitors deserve only death.”

With that, he picked up the gun from Luo Bingtin’s feet, ready to shoot.

At that moment, a collateral relative with abilities, scared out of his wits, shouted incoherently, “Uncle! I report! I report that the third branch colluded with people from the Kunshan base! They’ve planned to act tonight! Uncle, I’ll tell you everything I know; spare me! Don’t kill me!”

Luo Bingtin, hearing this, pressed down on Uncle Zhu’s gun and turned to look at the collateral relative, who was sobbing and pleading.

“Fifth brother, I—I also report! Zhu Mingcheng has colluded with outsiders! I saw him send messages to them, planning to sell the laboratory results for weapons! I don’t want to be part of this! I was forced into it, fifth brother, please spare our family!”

The one speaking was an uncle from the fourth branch, who had always been close to the brothers from the third branch and was adept at flattering the main family.

Uncle Zhu’s gaze grew even colder. He holstered the gun and shouted, “Is there anyone else willing to report or confess? Confess, and you’ll have a chance for leniency. Otherwise, you all die!”

The relatives immediately began shouting over one another, some even blaming each other. The relatives who had participated in the rebellion joined in the fray, and if they hadn’t been tied up, they might have started fighting each other.

Uncle Zhu felt a deep sense of desolation. This was the family the old master had always wanted to protect—how absurd, how tragic, how lamentable.

Seeing Uncle Zhu somewhat dazed from the continuous blows, Luo Bingtin arranged for Meng Ge, Xie Jinghang, and team members to separate and detain these people for interrogation.

Uncle Zhu’s fourth brother was still clutching his son’s lifeless body, crying uncontrollably. Unable to move him, he let him be for now. Zhu Dage had already been moved to the infirmary in the office building, and Luo Bingtin planned to go for an interrogation as well. Just then, the devastating news arrived.

Old Master Zhu had passed away.

The Zhu family members were thrown into chaos, rushing towards the old master’s room in a frenzy. Luo Bingtin paused for a moment, sighed deeply, and followed silently.

It turned out that Old Master Zhu, already advanced in years, had been betrayed by the fifth branch for the first time, leading to a deep sadness that festered within him. He felt he had let Luo Bingtin down but couldn’t bring himself to discuss it due to pride. On top of that, the winter weather had been unseasonably harsh, causing him to suffer from recurring ailments and remain bedridden.

Today, the sudden shock and anger, combined with a missed dose of medication, had taken a toll on him. When those watching over him were detained by the collateral rebels downstairs, he was not found until it was too late. 

When Zhu Erge arrived, he was met with the sight of everyone kneeling, wailing. Uncle Zhu, overcome with grief, collapsed to the ground, unconscious. It was utter chaos as the long-absent Zhu family patriarch rushed in to handle the aftermath.

Luo Bingtin stood at a distance, gazing at Old Master Zhu's lifeless form, her heart heavy with sorrow. She took a deep breath, exhaling slowly, and instructed Anmin to keep an eye on things here while she headed for the interrogation room.

The collateral traitors perfectly embodied the concept of bullying the weak and fearing the strong. Under the interrogation of Xie Jinghang and Meng Ge, they were as meek as quails, but when it came to the other team members, they became cunning and devious, treating Luo Bingtin as if she were harmless.

Luo Bingtin smiled kindly, but then swiftly shot an ice spear through a kneecap, causing the clever ones to scream in agony. She locked two of the backstabbers together, letting them tear each other apart.

A nameless fury burned steadily within her, compelling Xie Jinghang to ensure they pried every ounce of information from these traitors. Those who refused to cooperate would be executed and displayed in the square.

She no longer needed to play nice with these people. After this incident, the initiative of the fortress lay firmly in her hands.

The entire fortress was shaken by Luo Bingtin’s ruthless and bloody methods, yet deep down, they felt it was deserved. The collateral relatives who could commit such heinous acts deserved this fate; the more tragic, the more satisfying it was to the onlookers.

Uncle Zhu was hit hard, his son’s body already taken away for burial. He remained in the square, viciously kicking at the corpse, and no one stopped him, tacitly approving of his actions.

The collateral traitors in the interrogation room, witnessing this scene, were so frightened they even began spilling secrets about when they had peeped at girls bathing as children.

The interrogation wrapped up swiftly, and Luo Bingtin sifted through a stack of confessions, extracting the genuine information from the sea of nonsense, and handed it to Xie Jinghang and Meng Ge.

“There are three confirmed facts: 
1. Tonight, they will coordinate with the Kunshan base, allowing their people to infiltrate and take full control of the fortress. 
2. The laboratory has been sold off almost entirely; the data and results have mostly been offloaded, with the buyers being a gang organization—its leader remains unaware for now. 
3. Old Master Zhu’s illness was man-made; they poisoned his food, secretly harming him.”

Luo Bingtin finished in one breath, turning to Xie Jinghang. “Jojo, we need to prepare quickly. If the Kunshan base acts swiftly, they should be arriving soon.”

Xie Jinghang nodded. The head of the Kunshan base was Fu Buqi, known for his treachery and using others as pawns to achieve his ends. Last time, he had incited the former base leader, Li Qinfeng, to attack the fortress, resulting in a catastrophic defeat that cost them most of their arsenal and manpower. The surviving captives were used as bargaining chips for resources, eventually leading to his suspension for review.

The Fenglin base had given Fu Buqi substantial backing, whether through power exchanges or other interests, securing the support of half the military’s upper echelon, allowing him to rise at Li Qinfeng's expense.

The subsequent rebellion and infiltration were likely orchestrated by Fu Buqi, indicating he had grand designs on the fortress.

Time was of the essence. As Luo Bingtin pondered whether to stage an empty-city ruse or stand firm against the assault, Xie Jinghang proposed a brilliant idea, igniting excitement in Luo Bingtin, who nodded vigorously in agreement.
