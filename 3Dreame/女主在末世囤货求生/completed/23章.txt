**Doomsday Underground Fortress**

The two families that had decided to transform the abandoned military base into a doomsday underground fortress quickly began planning the renovation. The task of procuring a hydropower generator was entrusted to the Zhu family, thanks to their abundance of manpower and resources.

The remaining task was to utilize and remodel the original architectural blueprints of the base. Luo Bingtin and Old Master Zhu discussed how to maximize the military base's advantages, ensuring it would be both defensible and offensible. After all, they couldn't expect kindness from humanity or zombies in the post-apocalyptic world—this was something Luo Bingtin was absolutely convinced of.

"This place is a gem; everyone would want it. We can't rely on human nature," she stated firmly. Upon hearing this, Old Master Zhu understood exactly where Luo Bingtin was headed with her thoughts.

In the study of the Zhu family, Luo Bingtin encountered a young man she hadn’t seen before, named Yang Ming. After introductions from the Zhu family, she learned that he was the architect brought in to oversee the transformation of the doomsday fortress. With a rumored military background, his capabilities were still somewhat of a mystery, but she trusted the Zhu family’s judgment.

After Old Master Zhu laid out a few requirements, Luo Bingtin contributed her own. Aside from restoring the military base's original capabilities for defense and offense, Old Master Zhu wanted to seal off the base's roads into a single entry point. Luo Bingtin, on the other hand, insisted that the living spaces within be spacious and well-ventilated. As someone who couldn’t tolerate being cooped up, she threw her hands up in exasperation. "Isn’t that just common sense?"

Though it was called a doomsday underground fortress, the military base's altitude meant it was more mountain-side than underground, so ventilation wasn’t a concern at all.

Once they confirmed the various requirements, Yang Ming casually asked, "Are we going for some sort of unique ecological experience here?" It seemed Luo Bingtin’s high standards for living spaces gave the impression she was trying to transform the doomsday fortress into a five-star hotel.

Old Master Zhu chuckled and nodded, "You could say that; it’s all about survival in the apocalypse."

As the renovation of the fortress progressed rapidly, Luo Bingtin pondered how to enhance the living experience further. Deep down, she felt like something important was missing. But she knew better than to force the thought; she let it go for the time being.

Since the space upgrade, the sky had turned bluer, the wind gentler, and the grass greener. The pigs, cows, sheep, chickens, ducks, and geese were living quite well behind their fences. Luo Bingtin had never doubted that cows and sheep could graze, but she couldn’t help but wonder what the others were eating to thrive so well.

Renovation was no quick task; Luo Bingtin wouldn’t be glued to the fortress's affairs. Ever since joining forces with the Zhu family, she had taken a step back, trusting them to handle things. They held daily meetings or video conferences to discuss stockpiling progress and confirm the next steps.

The impending disasters wouldn’t delay just because someone wasn’t prepared.

In recent days, Luo Bingtin's increasing influence and involvement in the Zhu family's affairs sparked quiet discontent among other Zhu family members. Observing Old Master Zhu and those with higher authority, it was obvious they grumbled behind closed doors. Meanwhile, family members who were further from the centers of power, particularly the women, began to gossip.

Zhu Yidan was furious upon hearing this. "How can those aunts and sisters talk about Bingtin like that?"

Despite her sweet and naive demeanor, Zhu Yidan had begun to grasp some unspeakable truths during this time. But seeing that Luo Bingtin was unfazed, she decided not to relay these disgusting remarks to her friend.

If Luo Bingtin were to find out, she’d probably just offer a forced smile. Let them misunderstand; it served as a good cover.

Once the apocalypse hit, they would realize just how narrow-minded they had been.

Holding two lists of supplies, one from the Zhu family and the other from her private stash, Luo Bingtin had been repeatedly telling Old Master Zhu that as long as there was even a penny to spare, it should be converted into survival supplies.

When the apocalypse struck, all movable and immovable assets, corporate stocks, cash, jewelry, and antiques would be worth nothing. "As long as you have food, you won’t panic."

Luo Bingtin's fingers habitually tapped a rhythm on the table, mimicking a comedic sketch, signaling her deep in thought. She still had the largest Mingzhu Corporation untouched, where she held the most shares. Distributing such a large pie without drawing attention from the Zhu family would be tricky; it could easily expose her plans.

Old Master Zhu was also scheming. The old fox was indeed crafty, and soon both of them landed on a quick and straightforward approach.

Once they had their plan, an unspoken understanding of keeping outsiders out resurfaced.

"Have you heard?" Old Master Zhu asked. 

"Not only that, he was sent straight to ICU yesterday and hasn't come out yet."

"Where did you hear this? Old Master Zhu is really... in trouble..."

In the tightly-knit social circles of Beijing, news traveled fast. Recently, the Zhao family had hosted a business banquet, inviting the esteemed Old Master Zhu. The invitation had been acknowledged, but then this incident occurred.

Of course, the gossip at the banquet wasn’t limited to just this incident.

"Looks like the Luo family is in trouble."

"I heard that too; it was that Zhu family's younger son who did it, ruthless and cold-hearted, not even sparing that little orphan girl."

"Exactly! The orphan girl is easier to manipulate, and with her assets, she’s a prime target. Just turned eighteen and already a billionaire—who wouldn’t be envious? Once Old Master Luo is gone, they’ll have it easy."

"Right? Old Master Zhu probably had a stroke out of anger over this."

"I’ve heard Old Master Luo spent a fortune on guardianship before passing. Those people really took the money without doing a thing."

Zhu's younger uncle sat there, feeling wronged, thinking, "What a reputation to have; this is so unfair!"

At the center of this gossip storm, an old man and a young one were currently in a private hospital’s ICU, munching on cut fruit as they watched the live stream of the fortress’s renovation.

The Zhu family was truly talented; on the first day alone, they managed to connect all the power circuits. The previous base had only removed the hydropower generator, and since the wiring had remained intact, they merely had to reconnect it to restore power. The network was also back online, allowing them to see the renovation from various angles via the newly installed surveillance cameras.

The base's layout was clear, divided into four main zones: the military zone, combat readiness zone, office zone, and living zone. Each area was spacious, and even the number of rooms in the living zone was more than enough for both the Luo and Zhu families.

More rooms meant more supplies would need to be prepared. Between the living and office zones was a massive cafeteria—a combination of a dining hall and an event space. The kitchen area was planned out, but it was still quite empty, waiting to be stocked with necessary facilities.

As the renovation made significant noise, trucks bearing the Zhu family’s logistics logo came and went, creating a buzz that savvy business folks couldn’t help but notice.

Zhu's younger uncle took the opportunity to promote the "Doomsday Paradise" brand and advertisements, and with Old Master Zhu's shocking admission to ICU, the attention was effectively diverted.
