**Confusion**

Based on previous communications, it was clear that Meng had mentioned they arrived at this backup base. Now, with the group missing and so many people still unaccounted for, it felt absurd. Even if they encountered a horde of zombies, the ability users should be safe.

Lo Bingting immediately decided to search the perimeter of the bar for clues, determined to find them despite the darkness of night. Anxiety and frustration bubbled within her; these were important people she had promised to protect, and now they were just... gone. It was outrageous.

“Don’t panic,” Xie Jinghang said to the group, “I suddenly remembered another place we should check. Come on, let’s go take a look.”

Lo Bingting pulled out a modified car from her storage space, and they all piled in, with Xie Jinghang taking the wheel. As they barreled down the road, cutting through zombies, he explained, “I just remembered that before the Zhu family branches caused trouble, Meng and I came here a few times. We had selected several bases as backups, and the bar is actually one of them. I think Meng might be at another backup location.”

This was the first time Lo Bingting had heard about this. Her eyes widened as she asked, “Why were there several bases? Isn’t one safe enough?”

“That’s what I thought too,” Xie Jinghang replied. “Maybe Meng just likes to be prepared.”

Lo Bingting nodded. It made sense; Meng was always one to have a Plan B. “So, how many backups did you end up picking?”

Xie Jinghang thought for a moment, pursing his lips. “Three or four, I think. The bar was the best overall; it’s spacious, secure, and well-equipped.”

Lo Bingting agreed. The bar had everything they needed, including bathrooms in the individual rooms, making it a reasonable top choice.

“Let’s head to the closest backup base first,” she suggested.

“Sure, we’ll just check them one by one. I refuse to believe people can just disappear into thin air,” he replied confidently.

They drove through the night, taking down zombies along the way, until they reached a garden community that looked like an upscale villa area. The large, standalone houses had sprawling yards, but the plants had grown wild and unruly from neglect.

Unfortunately, Lo Bingting didn’t appreciate the plants at all. Every time she saw them, she was reminded of those disgusting giant flowers, the crazy sea urchins, and the rambutan—nothing decent at all.

Now, the group was mostly unafraid of any zombies they encountered, engaging them head-on, especially Lo Bingting, who hit especially hard when she was in a bad mood.

With everything they had, they struck decisively. If it weren't for the flamboyant Flame Dragon, she would have loved nothing more than to set the place ablaze.

Zhu Yidan gently patted her back, trying to calm her down. She was worried sick about her family, while Lo Bingting squeezed her hand to offer some comfort.

An Min, however, was on high alert. Sensing something off, he quickly used his wind abilities to notify Lo Bingting. Just as he flashed back to her side, he suddenly felt a tightness around his ankle. Before he knew it, he was yanked backward with force. It happened again. An Min turned and unleashed several wind blades, severing the creeping vine-like tendrils that had emerged from the shadows.

Lo Bingting was fed up with the day she had. After searching for people and burning mutant plants all day, she was ready for it all to end.

Her blows became increasingly fierce, and she had mastered the combination of the boomerang and air gun. Both were instant-fire, allowing her to inflict damage on mutant plants both when thrown and when returning. The power of the air gun was impressive, making An Min and Luo Fan envious, while Zhu Yidan buzzed with questions, eager to learn more.

Lo Bingting only mentioned that the weapons were rare, but they weren’t impossible to obtain—it just required time and opportunity. The others could only watch with longing.

An Min winked at Luo Fan, implying they were using the same weapons, like a couple. Unfortunately, his flirtation was wasted on Luo Fan, who was completely disinterested. However, Zhu Yidan quickly caught on and began whispering excitedly with An Min, gossiping about it.

Maybe the desensitization therapy from the afternoon had worked, because even with the dense cluster of giant flowers nearby, Lo Bingting remained expressionless and unfazed. Meanwhile, the previously cheerful duo suddenly went pale when they finally caught sight of vast patches of the hideous flowers illuminated by the flames of the Flame Dragon.

Suddenly, a realization struck her; maybe this was a trap. The perpetrator might have just intended to use these mutant plants to ensnare her, not realizing it presented a perfect opportunity to rack up points.

If it weren’t for the others around, Lo Bingting would have shouted to the skies, “Thanks for the seeds, my friend!”

Her points were likely in the millions at this point.

“Seeing that the others couldn’t help much, Lo Bingting sent out a bucket and a small net, instructing them to collect seeds. The obedient group began to follow her and Xie Jinghang, diligently picking up seeds.

When they finally finished over an hour later, Zhu Yidan complained about her aching back, lamenting her age and bone density, suggesting she might need to boost her calcium intake.

Lo Bingting’s concerns only deepened. What was the person behind all this planning?

After cleaning up the mess and setting fire to the remaining damaged seeds and flower heads, Lo Bingting suddenly remembered that these plants also had crystal cores. She wondered how they could burn everything without finding anything valuable. She asked Xie Jinghang, who, in his usual chatty manner, replied:

“The crystal cores in these ugly things start depleting when they shoot out seeds. Once they’re done, the energy is completely used up, all distributed into the seeds.”

Xie Jinghang’s explanation made sense. No wonder the noisy guy wanted the seeds; they were packed with energy.

They quickly moved to another location, and as Lo Bingting pondered their situation, she thought about what benefit it brought the other party to lead her around like a fool.

The neighboring city was huge, nearly double the size of Beijing, and the backup base was still quite far away. By the time they got close, dawn was breaking. Fortunately, this time, they didn’t come away empty-handed.

The group spotted a nearly extinguished bonfire, scattered luggage, and leftover food, knowing something must have gone wrong.

There were no clear signs of a struggle, but the footprint patterns and the state of the belongings made it obvious that outsiders had intruded and forcibly removed their companions.

Xie Jinghang had some tracking skills, having previously followed footprints to a cave. This time, he used the clues left behind to find their direction.

Driving along the lead, he was concerned they might miss something, so Zhu Yidan took the wheel while Lo Bingting dealt with the nearby zombies, and An Min protected Xie Jinghang as he focused intently on observing the trail.

They drove and fought their way through the zombies, their speed surpassing that of a bicycle. By the time the sun fully rose, they finally arrived at a building.

When they looked up, they were shocked to find it was the Biotech Tower, known before the apocalypse as the headquarters of a renowned biotechnology company.

Lo Bingting felt a sinking sensation in her stomach; there was no doubt that Fu Buqi was involved. He had always wanted the researchers from the lab and had gone through all this trouble to get them.

“Good news and bad news. Which do you want to hear first?”
