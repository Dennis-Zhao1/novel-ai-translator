The Sword That Cannot Be Eaten

Old Mr. Zheng felt completely at ease handing over everything to Luo Bingtian for arrangement. The old mansion's walls and the finished Longquan swords from the workshop were all neatly packed and stored in the warehouse. The renowned sword was placed in a separate wooden box, positioned prominently to signify its importance.

Just as Luo Bingtian was about to put it away in her space, she recalled the silver cold light detected by the divination technique. She hesitated for a moment, then dashed into her space and shouted directly at the mirror, "Longquan sword, can you eat it?"

The mirror responded, "Its spiritual energy is acceptable."

Luo Bingtian replied, "That won't work! That's someone else's weapon, used to slay demons and monsters. If you eat it, what will I use?"

The mirror asked, "Is it a renowned sword?"

Luo Bingtian nodded, thinking it couldn’t see her, and answered loudly, "Yes, it’s a renowned sword."

The mirror responded succinctly, "Does not eat."

The two words carried an unusual meaning, leaving her unsure if it was resentment or something else. After getting the answer she wanted, she asked another question, "What about an ordinary Longquan sword? The kind that’s not sharpened?"

The mirror replied, "Does not eat."

Well, that was a relief! Luo Bingtian felt a wave of satisfaction as she began organizing her supplies. Although the Zheng family claimed to have entrusted their lives and fortunes to her, who could tell if they would change their minds after the apocalypse? She didn't covet their belongings, and this batch of Longquan swords and the renowned sword could be considered as a penalty for breach of contract. Any other supplies they wanted would be returned to them.

This time, she had learned her lesson and specifically designated an area in her space to store this batch of supplies separately, using her mental power to assist in keeping everything organized. To her surprise, she succeeded. Looking around, the quantity was quite substantial, but compared to her own supplies, it still felt lacking.

She had told the Zheng family that she would arrange for people to transport the goods back to Kyoto, but in reality, she had even taken possession of the trucks. Brother Meng was going to follow her, and she arranged for the old mansion’s butler to host the Zheng family. At the beginning of May, she instructed the butler to dismiss some unimportant servants—those who were neither from the Luo family nor particularly loyal.

While she couldn’t say they were as secure as a fortress now, after the apocalypse began, it wouldn’t be as leaky as a sieve.

As the days leading up to the apocalypse drew closer, Luo Bingtian made numerous plans and preparations. Even in front of her uncles, she couldn't help but feel a hint of anxiety. 

Every day, her younger uncle updated her on the construction and renovation of the doomsday fortress. Currently, all living areas had been set up, and the bathrooms, sewage systems, and septic tanks had been completed and were ready for use. In addition to the hydroelectric generator, they had also prepared diesel and gasoline generators, as well as a plethora of solar power generators to support the normal operation of the fortress.

Key locations, roads, and buildings were equipped with surveillance cameras, providing security and monitoring the situation in the area to prevent unexpected incidents. After much insistence from Luo Bingtian, besides internet coverage, they also ensured wireless signal coverage and internal telephone lines to avoid communication issues.

No matter how much was spent, it was worth it for a stable and peaceful life in the apocalypse.

The vegetable garden and fruit tree seedlings that the old man ordered were already planted and were being well-managed daily, giving off an orderly vibe.

The supplies procured by the Zhu family and those she acquired abroad had all been transported into the doomsday fortress warehouse, which was originally intended for military weapons and had a high level of security.

With this batch of Longquan swords, there was no need to purchase Tang knives anymore. Time was tight, and she had to secretly return to Beijing to prepare. Some supplies needed to be kept secret, while others had to be revealed; otherwise, she wouldn’t be able to explain herself to the Zhu family, and the secret of her space might be exposed.

Fortunately, the trucks from the Zheng family were sufficient, and with the Zhu family’s logistics, there were no issues with the visible supplies.

Once a person who had hundreds of millions in cash, Luo Bingtian now only had a few hundred thousand left. She couldn’t help but feel a bit sentimental about it; she didn’t want to keep that money. She could stock up on a box of instant noodles instead!

After tidying up, she couldn’t stay in Hangzhou any longer. The two of them secretly returned to Kyoto, and by the next afternoon, they were back at the old mansion. Taking advantage of the lack of attention, she released some supplies into the farm warehouse, having already contacted her younger uncle to arrange for people to transport them to the doomsday fortress.

The supplies in the farm warehouse were cleared with her grandfather’s knowledge, excluding firearms and ammunition. Her grandfather wouldn’t ask about them specifically, assuming she had other arrangements.

That evening, she had dinner with the Zheng family at the old mansion, planning to slip away to the fortress quietly when the apocalypse arrived. The Zheng family had no idea what would happen next; they could only trust her completely.

Luo Bingtian relished this arrangement. To survive, they had to obediently follow her plans. Among the materials from the Zheng family were items they couldn’t part with, such as books and antiques, and even materials for crafting Longquan swords, all carefully packed away by Luo Bingtian.

In her past life, the apocalypse had begun on May 20th. Luo Bingtian sat in the bedroom of the old mansion, gazing at the tranquil night sky. The countdown of these few days forced them to make their final preparations.

The Zhu family was still under tight surveillance, so Luo Bingtian couldn’t reveal herself. While the surface appeared calm, there were continuous movements beneath. When her younger uncle realized he was being watched, he sent Zhu Yidan's second brother to carry out errands instead. With more people, it was easier to evade attention, and others could provide cover.

The luxurious apartment in Yunding Fenghua ultimately didn’t sell. In the middle of the night, she drove there to clean out all the furniture, appliances, and clothes from Yunding. If she could have peeled off the wallpaper and tiles, she would have taken those too.

The few cars in the garage were also taken away, leaving no trace of her in Yunding.

Luo Bingtian couldn’t help but feel a pang of sentimentality. Being lost in illusions was not a rational behavior. Now, it wasn’t just her; the elderly in the old mansion and the Zheng family were her responsibility. In the days ahead, she could only think about how to make things better and live longer.

After returning to the old mansion, she avoided everyone and gathered everything from her grandfather’s study into her space. She then instructed the butler to seal off the study and lock it up, never to be opened again.

In her mind, she wanted to fit the entire old mansion into her space. Setting aside whether her ability was sufficient or whether the space could accommodate it, she questioned the practicality of such an action. If it were indeed stored away, would the old mansion’s original site simply become a pit or a flat piece of land? Wouldn’t that raise suspicion?

Choosing to be cautious, she decided against any major actions for now; that could wait until after the apocalypse began.

She prepared herself mentally. During her days without stockpiling supplies, she kept in sync with her grandfather and younger uncle regarding the fortress's progress while also arranging for them to gather information from the outside. In her previous life, there hadn’t been any warnings or indications of the impending doom, but what about this time?

Luo Bingtian couldn’t help but ponder: was there truly no sign at all of the impending disaster that would engulf the world? Or perhaps there were signs, but they were being suppressed or kept under wraps?

Anything was possible. She couldn’t assume or speculate about specific situations based on possibilities; all she could do was pay more attention to external information, especially to the subtle but abnormal signs.

Just like those watching the Zhu family, right?

Both her grandfather and younger uncle expressed their agreement. So, who were those unseen eyes that were gazing at them in the shadows?
