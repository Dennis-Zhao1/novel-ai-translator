**Global Travel and Stockpiling III**

The itinerary for the Romantic Country would be the last for Lu Bingtin this time, as the Zhu family elders had notified her that the situation in Huaguo had changed. They were currently observing the market, and the funds they had liquidated were being stockpiled frantically in various countries. This commotion had caught the attention of the higher-ups.

Lu Bingtin wasn't particularly worried; the Zhu family's strength was still formidable. As the end times drew closer, the world would descend into an uncontrollable situation where laws and rules would no longer bind anyone. Even the most kind-hearted and law-abiding citizens could turn into demons.

Yet, since the apocalypse hadn't arrived yet, Lu Bingtin didn't want to dwell on these thoughts. What was meant to come would come, and what had to be faced would have to be faced. The grudges of her past life wouldn't vanish just because she was reborn, and whether there would be other entanglements in the future was not something she wanted to think about now.

Living in the moment was Lu Bingtin's greatest feeling at the moment, and this shift in mindset was bolstered by the confidence that stockpiling had given her.

That evening, she once again entered her space. She had accidentally spilled some samples of wheat seeds she had collected earlier. To her surprise, she noticed some sprouts growing in the grass that were different from the others. A quick search on her phone revealed that they were actually wheat seedlings.

It seemed that her space could indeed be used for planting, and the growth rate was astonishing. Lu Bingtin had never considered growing anything in her space before. Although she had an inkling, it was better to have more grain for seeds. If the world became unfit for cultivation, at least her space could preserve the species, and any grain loss could be supplemented.

Thinking of this made her less resistant to the idea of farming. Gazing into the seemingly endless expanse of her secret space, high-tech agricultural machines could also be considered, along with related books—better to be prepared than to regret later.

This trip was indeed her last. After communicating with Chris, the itinerary wasn't urgent. Unlike before, when they had to spend nights on planes, the Romantic Country was a bit far, so they spent the entire day traveling. By the time they disembarked, it was already evening.

There wasn’t much to stockpile in the Romantic Country; the main purpose was to travel and enjoy a few days of shopping. The remaining funds would all be spent domestically. Lu Bingtin, who had decided to leave not a penny for the apocalypse, felt particularly carefree.

After settling into the hotel, everyone was exhausted from the day’s travel. Her bodyguard, Big Brother Meng, still had plenty of energy and headed to the hotel gym to work out, while Lu Bingtin returned to her space to take inventory.

Inside her space, her laptop was connected to an external power source. She diligently worked on a materials inventory list. Counting items was exhausting, and even though she hadn’t taken anything out yet, just the act of recording made her feel mentally drained.

Looking up at the mirror, she called out, “You are now a mature space; you should know your own inventory. Tell me how much rice I have!”

The mirror remained silent, with only the sundial, which symbolized the passage of time in the outside world, slowly moving.

“Hmph, you didn’t act like this when I was feeding you my ancient jade. You ungrateful mirror, taking all I have and then pretending not to know me!”

With a sigh, Lu Bingtin muttered under her breath, continuing her work. Whenever she felt tired, she would lie down on the large bed for a quick rest, then get back to it after a short nap.

She had only glanced over the inventory previously, so she had a rough idea of her stock. However, having a photographic memory didn’t equate to good math skills; having too many lists only made her head spin. Without consolidating everything into a single visual data table, she never quite understood her material situation clearly.

With a hint of obsessive-compulsive disorder, she even categorized her supplies and pulled up a pie chart. The result shocked her; the proportions were completely unbalanced. While she had stocked up on some items, there were gaps where she should have stocked more, particularly in essential cold weapons and medicines. The batch of medicines prepared by the Zhu family hadn’t been accounted for yet, and Lu Bingtin’s sixth sense told her she needed to prepare even more.

Surviving in the apocalypse would be extremely difficult; even a minor illness could claim a vibrant life. The medical industry in the Romantic Country was quite advanced, so she could have Chris arrange for some supplies.

During the day, Lu Bingtin shopped in the trendiest districts of the Romantic Country. Luxury goods were no longer necessities in the apocalypse, but had depreciated to practically nothing. However, Lu Bingtin was not one to compromise on her quality of life just because of the impending apocalypse. With her space and money, her only principle was to live happily and however she pleased.

In comparison to her inventory, the money spent on this shopping trip was negligible. Big Brother Meng carried a handful of bags back to the hotel to drop off before quickly heading back down to accompany Lu Bingtin to the largest pharmaceutical company in the Romantic Country.

The sudden order caught the company off guard. The pharmaceutical industry in Huaguo was also quite strong and didn’t heavily rely on imports, except for some special medicines. Most of this order was for common medications, with only a few items under Huaguo’s strict control and in small quantities.

Lu Bingtin explained that she feared they might reject her order due to the small quantity, so she added some common oral medications and emergency supplies, hoping they wouldn’t turn down her request.

The other party smiled, indicating their understanding. The total order amount was still quite decent, and the people introduced by Chris never questioned the validity of the reasons behind the orders. They were only responsible for selling, not for logistics or customs procedures, unless it was an official order or there was significant demand.

Lu Bingtin didn’t mind; the medicines were small and could easily fit into her suitcase after removing their outer packaging. She didn’t have to worry about customs when traveling back on her private jet, as everything would just go into her space once they returned.

After settling these matters, Lu Bingtin spent the next two days happily exploring the Romantic Country. From visiting famous landmarks and taking photos to dining at various hotels, she even visited a chocolate factory to order a batch of goods to be air-freighted back to Huaguo. After earning another commission and a generous tip, she parted ways with Chris and flew directly back home.

Instead of returning to Beijing right away, Lu Bingtin headed straight for the cold weapons she needed to stockpile—specifically, the production areas for Longquan swords and Tang knives. She had entrusted the Zhu family to make the necessary contacts, and now she was just waiting to inspect and receive the goods herself.

It wasn’t that she couldn’t have them sent directly to Beijing for inspection; it was just that if she wasn’t there, the outside world wouldn’t focus on her. With her vast stockpile of materials, she didn’t want to take any risks. The Zhu family had already drawn the attention of some people, and their subsequent movements would definitely be monitored closely.

To avoid drawing attention to herself, it was better for her to handle things personally. She also planned to enjoy herself until the day before the apocalypse broke out, then quietly return to Beijing. For now, her focus was on monitoring the situation; if the enemy didn’t move, she wouldn’t either.

Thinking of it as a domestic trip, she could enjoy the beautiful scenery of her homeland before the end times. Big Brother Meng didn’t mind; his job was to protect the young lady, watching her spend happily wherever they went since, after all, it was all about spending money.

After getting off the plane and switching vehicles, they bounced along for a while before finally arriving at the production area of Longquan swords. The Zhu family had helped connect her with an old family that had been handcrafting swords for generations, and the local cuisine was well-known, with many dishes that Lu Bingtin enjoyed.

Suddenly struck by an idea, she thought, since the space could preserve food, wouldn’t it be more convenient to order cooked dishes directly from a restaurant? 

She hadn’t thought of this before; previously, she had only considered asking Aunt Li at home to cook. After settling into her hotel, Lu Bingtin opened the takeaway app, filtering through well-reviewed vendors until she found a suitable one. To show her sincerity, she paid through the app, indicating she wasn’t one to create trouble.
