**Smooth Infiltration**

Aside from the sound of water flowing from the bathroom and the muffled struggles of a woman being washed, the room was eerily silent. 

Luo Bingting felt that the words spoken were directed at her, yet also meant for the starlet. The apocalypse had brought more than just a change in status; lowering her gaze, her expression gradually turned icy. Fortunately, Sister Li didn’t say anything else and seemed indifferent to the reactions of those who heard her words. She simply found a sofa, sat down, and observed her subordinates as they carried out their tasks.

They lined the women up for washing in an assembly line fashion. Even though men were present in the room, any attempt by the women to resist was futile; resisting meant a beating. The first girl who entered was scrubbed until her skin turned red, and she was unceremoniously thrown out. She landed half on the carpet, shamefully curling her body to hide her private parts.

Sister Li shot a glance at the fashionable men and women standing nearby, prompting someone to lift the girl up, forcing her to expose herself. The girl’s skin wasn’t the only thing flushed; her face burned bright red, all the way to her ears. She didn’t dare to resist for fear of being beaten, and her expression was a mix of humiliation, anger, and terror as she trembled uncontrollably under the gaze of so many strangers who were staring at her naked form.

Luo Bingting frowned at the scene unfolding before her. What was going on here?

Sister Li elegantly stood up and circled the naked girl, appraising her as if evaluating something. With a wave of her hand, someone pushed in a rack filled with various gowns, resembling a model showcase. She selected a gown and insisted the girl put it on, offering no underwear, making her go completely bare underneath.

The girl hesitated to take the dress, unsure of how to proceed, until she was scolded to hurry up, which made her speed up the process. At that moment, Luo Bingting was surprised by Sister Li’s keen aesthetic sense; her eye for beauty was sharp and precise.

Before long, the girl was dressed in a stunning silver backless gown adorned with sequins, perfectly accentuating her alluring figure. The gown glimmered under the light, enhancing the girl’s delicate features and adding a touch of seduction to her natural beauty, even without makeup. Her damp long hair clung to her exposed back, creating a striking contrast between the dark and the light; the darker her hair appeared, the more luminous her fair skin seemed.

Everyone in the room was astonished; the transformation was remarkable. No woman could resist the allure of beauty, and it was clear that they would cooperate more willingly for their next baths. 

The next girl to approach was the naïve Saintly Girl, who eagerly entered the bathroom, even politely thanking them for the opportunity. It seemed that she wouldn't face any punishment. The now-dressed girl was already being positioned in front of a vanity, where makeup was being applied. Was Sister Li here just to do makeup?

What was all this fuss for? Who were they trying to intimidate?

Sister Li observed her subordinates’ actions closely, occasionally offering advice. Soon, the Saintly Girl emerged from the bathroom, standing confidently before Sister Li. She turned around, full of anticipation in her expression.

What did it matter that there were men in the room? Typically, those involved in fashion and beauty were either gay or supportive friends; she had nothing to fear.

Having built up her confidence, the Saintly Girl felt no pressure and even looked forward to the astonished gazes of others at her transformation. The competitive spirit among women was unavoidable, even in the apocalypse. Luo Bingting couldn’t help but smirk at the Saintly Girl’s obliviousness.

Sister Li chose a gown for her as well. The Saintly Girl quickly changed into it, and Luo Bingting found herself approving of the choice. The girl, being only seventeen or eighteen, was at that tender age of blossoming youth, her face radiant with collagen and innocence. The airy white dress suited her perfectly, the hem grazing just above her knees and revealing slender, straight legs. The fitted waist accentuated her curves, creating a sweet and youthful aura that hinted at both purity and desire.

Sister Li clearly understood what men found appealing; every detail was tailored to catch their attention.

As the men’s approving gazes fell upon the Saintly Girl, she cheerfully took a seat at another vanity, allowing a male makeup artist to enhance her beauty.

At that moment, the starlet also entered the bathroom, while Luo Bingting remained seated, unwilling to expose herself. Though the room was not cold, the heating was insufficient, and she didn’t want to catch a cold by changing into such flimsy clothing too soon.

Hoping to delay her turn as long as possible, she waited until the fifth girl also entered the bathroom. Watching the transformed Saintly Girl admiring herself in the mirror, occasionally playing with her newly styled curls, Luo Bingting was struck by the girl’s boldness.

Sister Li and her team seemed unconcerned; they regarded the Saintly Girl as just another naïve beauty, her thoughts written plainly on her face.

Just then, as the fifth girl emerged, Sister Li was in the midst of selecting clothing when five men burst into the room, each holding a handgun. Upon closer inspection, Luo Bingting noted that the safeties were all off, and one man in the back was shouting about something.

At this point, Luo Bingting had moved to the bathroom door, leaning against the frame to observe the unfolding drama. Even the two women responsible for washing were drawn over, their heads peeking curiously into the bathroom.

The men were sharply dressed in suits and overcoats, exuding an air of privilege. As Luo Bingting recognized one of them, her heart sank; it was Li Liqiang, the man who had previously stopped her on the road, accompanied by the reckless scion of the Lu family. Thankfully, there were enough people in the room that she remained inconspicuous.

Sister Li, who had initially appeared furious, quickly switched to a flirtatious smile upon seeing the men enter. She approached them with exaggerated courtesy.

“Gentlemen, what brings you here? The place is still a bit chaotic, and it’s not quite ready yet. The banquet is being held in the main hall; we’ll be over there as soon as we finish up.”

The men, however, paid her no mind and instead focused their attention on the women clad in gowns.

The Saintly Girl, who thrived on being the center of attention, suddenly felt a bit shy under their gaze.

As the lead man spotted the starlet, his eyes lit up, and he made a beeline for her. Sister Li attempted to intervene but was shoved aside, stumbling several steps back before regaining her balance.

Luo Bingting watched as the men grabbed the women in gowns and attempted to pull them outside. Sister Li’s expression changed dramatically as she realized the urgency of the situation. She quickly stepped forward to block the door, forcing a smile and softly advising, “Gentlemen, you’re in too much of a rush. They’re not yet fully dressed or made up...”

“Are you telling me how to do my job?” the lead man sneered, his expression dripping with disdain, completely different from the silent figure who had shadowed Li Liqiang before.

“Zhang, don’t waste your breath on her,” Lu chimed in, ever the instigator.

Luo Bingting wondered if there was a significant upheaval happening in the power dynamics of the Kunshan base.

“Zhang, I wouldn’t dare. It’s just... if you take the girls like this, I can’t explain to Master Zhang,” Sister Li interjected, her voice trembling.

“Whether you can explain or not has nothing to do with me,” he replied dismissively, his arrogance unabated. Sister Li’s facade of calm began to crumble, her anxiety palpable.

If Sister Li couldn’t handle this, no one else could either. The room was silent, and as Zhang pushed her aside, he wrapped his arms around the starlet and left the room.

The other women, knowing the men were armed, didn’t dare to act out and complied silently.

The Saintly Girl, however, appeared far too eager, her cheeks flushed with excitement as she stole glances at the man holding her.

What a bold move for her.

As everyone in the room followed the men outside, Luo Bingting found herself unable to see the commotion unfolding outside due to her position. 

Suddenly, she heard someone on the other side of the door raising their voice. 

“Zhang, this is Fenglin Villa. It’s not your family’s territory; you might want to tone it down a bit.”

Just as Luo Bingting decided to follow them for a closer look, she felt a hand grab her arm. Turning around, she saw the two washing attendants, who, realizing they had gotten too caught up in the excitement, had returned to their duties and were now trying to undress her.

What a hassle. Taking advantage of their distraction, she swiftly knocked them both unconscious—an old trick she had learned from Xie Jinghang.

As she passed the rack of gowns, she snatched a few fitting ones for herself, deliberately choosing a particularly flashy piece, knowing she hadn’t stocked up on such items before the apocalypse. Who knew when they might come in handy?

Hiding in the crowd, she watched the ruckus caused by the scions, who had begun to shout, their guns waving threateningly. Quickly, she slipped into the bathroom, changed into the flashy gown, and found a more inconspicuous outfit in her space.

After ensuring the two attendants were down, she locked the bathroom door and, amidst the chaos, quietly slipped away.

After the long journey from the car to this room, night had already fallen. The electrical setup at Fenglin Base was nowhere near as comprehensive as that of the fortress, leaving many areas in darkness, which worked to Luo Bingting’s advantage. With her senses heightened, she could easily avoid patrols and passersby.

As she neared the main building, the crowd grew denser. Hiding in the shadows of the greenery and walls, she spotted the man with the ivory bracelet—Master Zhang—walking briskly through the base, habitually twisting the bracelet in his fingers.

A sudden instinct surged within her, prompting her to abandon her initial plan to infiltrate the main building and instead follow Master Zhang. She had a feeling that he might hold the key to her breakthrough.
