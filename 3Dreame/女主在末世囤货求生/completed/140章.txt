### Complaining

Little White Lotus was sobbing and seeking comfort, while Adam Song felt the urge to quietly retreat from the battlefield. He wanted to let Serena Zhou handle the situation, as he was beginning to find it unbearable. What a clingy nuisance she was, completely lacking in social awareness yet still intent on sticking to him.

Lo Bingting watched as Zhu Yidan chased after Little White Lotus, trying her best not to laugh out loud. She waved her hand for An Min to open the door. After venting her frustrations on Little White Lotus, Zhu Yidan finally let her go and climbed into the vehicle as they entered the compound.

The two cars parked in the open space next to the main gate. Lo Bingting stepped down from the city tower, observing the new ability users as they got out of their cars and organized themselves, continuing to play their roles in front of outsiders.

“Miss Lo, I’m here representing the Longxiang Base to discuss cooperation,” Adam Song said solemnly, pointing to the row of neatly standing people behind him, excluding Little White Lotus, who was being ignored.

“Mr. Song, have you forgotten what you said before leaving the fortress? Aren't you worried about making a fool of yourself by coming back?” One of the new ability users couldn’t help but scoff, recalling Adam’s earlier remarks.

Adam remained unfazed. “Times have changed. What I said back then still stands; it’s just a matter of perspective. Different situations lead to different views.”

The new ability users reflected on Adam's previous words. From their current standpoint, they could indeed understand it. Everyone wanted to be in a position of advantage; selfishness was not a crime, and people like Lo Bingting, who were genuinely altruistic, were truly rare.

If Lo Bingting knew what they were thinking, she wouldn’t have expected her actions to be seen as selfless. In reality, she was merely looking to increase their chances of survival, wanting capable people to help combat dangers.

“Alright then, how does Mr. Song propose we cooperate?” Lo Bingting said casually, appearing completely at ease.

Adam had his deputy retrieve a large bag of crystal cores that Pei Qian previously provided from the trunk of the car. He handed it over, but Lo Bingting didn’t take it directly, instead signaling for An Min to inspect it.

Upon opening the bag, they found that most of the crystals were above the third tier, with quite a few fourth-tier ones as well. It was evident that Adam had put thought into this offer, and after estimating the quantity, Lo Bingting understood the implications.

“What do you want in exchange for these crystal cores?” she asked.

“Are these awakened abilities not enough?” Adam replied.

“Hardly. This is merely a deposit; it wouldn’t even cover half,” she said, brushing her bangs away from her eyes. To her surprise, as soon as she said this, murmurs of shock rippled through the ordinary people from Longxiang Base. They were questioning how these cores could possibly be insufficient, wondering if Pei’s resources were running dry.

“Too expensive, you say? Where else in this world can you awaken abilities besides here? These crystal cores can be collected in a few days by any ability user by killing zombies. If you don’t awaken your powers, will you be able to gather enough in your next life?” Lo Bingting boldly stated. At the negotiation table, she never held back. If she didn’t manage to get a good deal, it would be a failure on her part.

Adam nodded seriously. “Alright then, how many people’s potion costs can these cover?”

Lo Bingting thought for a moment. “Barely enough for ten people, but I’ll give you a discount. We also need to arrange rooms and personnel support, and those costs add up.”

“Fine, ten people it is.” Adam agreed without further haggling, casually pointing to ten individuals for Lo Bingting’s team to take for health checks. Notably, Little White Lotus was not included in that group.

This left Little White Lotus in a panic. After finally arriving at the fortress, surviving a near-death experience, she wasn’t even among the first batch of awakeners. Once again, she began to cry, her sobbing drawing everyone's attention.

Unable to tolerate her wailing, Lo Bingting handed her over to Liu Xiaohui and Zhu Xiaoshu, then led the new ability users back to the training room.

The remaining individuals were assigned to three dormitories that had been specially reserved. Little White Lotus continued to plead with Adam for a chance to receive the injection, while Zhu Yidan, having finished her cleanup, was eager to see her parents and brother.

Just as she was about to leave the dormitory, a fortress ability user stopped her, speaking curtly. “Miss Zhu, you can’t go outside for now; outsiders aren’t allowed to wander freely within the fortress.”

Zhu Yidan pointed to herself in disbelief. “I can’t go either?”

She was taken aback; she never anticipated that returning would come with restrictions. If she had known, she wouldn’t have played along with Adam’s charade.

Just as she was processing this, the annoying voice of Little White Lotus chimed in again. “Does Miss Zhu still think she’s the same as before? Don’t you feel embarrassed? People see you as a traitor now.”

After saying this, Little White Lotus exaggeratedly covered her mouth and laughed lightly, quickly adding, “Don’t mind me, Miss Zhu. I’m just straightforward; I didn’t mean any harm.”

Her smug demeanor was infuriating, and Zhu Yidan clenched her fists. While she understood that Adam was playing a long game, that didn’t mean she couldn’t give this annoying little fish a beating.

At that moment, Adam’s deputy approached and mentioned that he needed to discuss something, which inadvertently saved Little White Lotus from further embarrassment. Unaware of her precarious situation, she continued to taunt, “Oh dear, once a young lady, now a complete joke. It’s important to have self-awareness, but some people are just too oblivious.”

Zhu Yidan was so furious she almost turned around, but the deputy held her back, softly saying, “Miss Zhu, Miss Lo asked for you. Don’t bother with the crazy one.”

Zhu Yidan was still fuming when she reached Lo Bingting’s office. Seeing Adam, Zhu Xiaoshu, and Meng Ge all present, she rushed to hug Lo Bingting and began to vent her frustrations. 

“Sister, I’m about to be driven crazy. If I had known, I wouldn’t have played that ridiculous love triangle scene with Captain Song. Look at me; I’m all dark and skinny now!”

Zhu Xiaoshu initially thought his niece would apologize for her earlier actions, but she remained the same as ever. What did she mean by “playing a scene”?

Noticing her uncle’s disapproving gaze, Zhu Yidan feigned innocence and chuckled. Zhu Xiaoshu shot her a stern look and said, “You better explain yourself. Your parents and brother are a mess over what you did, and they’ve been keeping their heads down in the fortress.”

Zhu Yidan was alarmed; she hadn’t considered that her actions would affect her family. She began to spill everything like a broken dam. “Alright, alright! That day when the zombies breached, we couldn’t fight back at all. We were terrified! Lo and Captain Song weren’t around, and just when I was about to be bitten, Captain Song showed up like a god. I was so excited that I fainted!”

Turning to Lo Bingting, she added with a grin, “Sister, I swear I didn’t mean it! I hugged Captain Song just to thank him for saving my life! I had no ulterior motives! You know me; our tastes in men are completely different. I don’t like overly dog-like guys!”

Now it was Adam’s turn to glare at her, but thankfully no one interrupted.

“Then I woke up in the infirmary. Captain Song asked me to play along with him in a scene and then hurried off without explaining why. I thought he was just tired of being in a nameless relationship with Lo and wanted me to provoke her a little since everyone knows their relationship is as solid as bulletproof glass—impossible to break!”

Well, now both Lo Bingting and Adam were staring at her. But with a mentality of “more lice don’t bite, and more debts don’t worry,” she wasn’t fazed by their glares. After all, she was being honest, and as long as she wasn’t embarrassed, the awkwardness was all on them.

“You all know what happened next. Captain Song didn’t give me a script, so I just improvised! Whatever he said, I echoed. Wherever he went, I had to follow. You guys have no idea how I’ve been living these past few days. I haven’t slept in a proper bed and have been running around outside, dealing with annoying little nuisances that just pop up from who knows where!”
