**Special Abilities**

The morning after everyone's awakening, Luo Bingting gathered the thirty individuals for final testing in the laboratory before they moved to the training ground. The bloodstains on the square had yet to be cleaned, a deliberate reminder of past events meant to discourage any foolishness.

In the training ground, each person demonstrated their special abilities one by one. Liu Xiaohui took notes diligently while Brother Meng, eager and ready, prepared to train these new recruits. 

Two individuals were under particularly close scrutiny. The first was the ice-element Wang Xinxin, whom Luo Bingting had high hopes for. There were too few mutated element users among their ranks. The second was a boy named Luo Fan from the security team, who had been on the cusp of graduating just as the apocalypse struck. He had a solid background as a national defense student and was among the last group to awaken their powers.

Luo Fan possessed a unique crystal core, completely transparent and unlike typical ice-element abilities, which usually bore a faint white frost. His crystal core resembled a flawless piece of synthetic crystal, devoid of any growth patterns. Earlier, Luo Bingting had tested his abilities several times before realizing that he wasn't without powers — his ability was replication. During a demonstration, she had inadvertently touched him, leading him to conjure two ice spikes. Initially, they thought he was an ice-element user, but when An Min greeted him and patted his shoulder, he exhibited wind-element abilities. 

After some confusion, they discovered that as long as he made physical contact with another ability user, he could replicate their powers. However, he couldn't replicate the level of those abilities. For instance, while Luo Bingting's ice-element could produce three ice spikes at level four, Luo Fan could only manage two, and he quickly fatigued, his face paling as he exerted himself.

At that moment, Luo Bingting had a thought. She suggested that he publicly claim to be a metal-element user and demonstrate that while Brother Meng discreetly assisted him. However, he also had a crucial task ahead. 

Initially attempting to blend in, Luo Fan accidentally caused a ruckus by dismantling part of a window, infuriating Uncle Zhu, who chastised him for the trouble. The repairs would be a hassle, and Luo Fan ultimately had to promise to restore everything to its original state to placate Uncle Zhu.

Aside from these two, the remaining recruits, even those with powers in three different elements, barely caught Luo Bingting's eye. Water and wood users were the most common, followed by earth and fire users, with metal users being the rarest. Excluding Luo Fan, there were only three others — a mere ten percent awakening rate.

Xiao Lu and Dr. Zhang quickly calculated the ratios, excitedly proclaiming they would return to research and adjust the formulas for awakening serums. Luo Bingting was cautious, urging them not to reveal too much outside, fearing they might treat the new recruits as mere test subjects.

The ordinary people watched with bright eyes as their former peers showcased their new powers, each expressing their desire to awaken. Luo Bingting waved her hand, declaring that everyone would have the chance, except for the elderly who failed the health checks and underage children. Those who qualified would awaken in batches. This announcement set the fort ablaze with excitement. Even those who had previously expressed dissent among the awakened users now felt reassured seeing that among the new awakeners, only one was a mutated element user, a little girl—hardly a threat, especially since none of the imposing security team members were mutated. 

More ability users meant better chances against zombies, allowing for assistance in desperate times, increasing their survival odds — a logic everyone understood, especially after facing two zombie sieges and attacks from hostile forces.

With Brother Meng remaining to train the newcomers, An Min was assigned to the watchtower for a shift change, while Uncle Zhu had recently taken up patrol duties, promoting three of the stronger ability users to lead rotating shifts. Once most had dispersed, Luo Bingting called Luo Fan over.

Brother Meng never questioned Luo Bingting's commands. Seeing Luo Fan hesitating to explain himself, the impatient Brother Meng playfully kicked him, urging him to hurry along. Luo Fan sheepishly laughed, patting the back of his head before scampering over to Luo Bingting. 

Wang Xinxin glanced up and caught sight of the two departing together. Their synchronized movements sparked a mix of curiosity and something unidentifiable within her. She unconsciously clenched and then relaxed her hands, her heart racing as they walked away — something about them felt different.

As Luo Fan followed Luo Bingting, he was unsure of where they were headed. Curiosity mingled with nerves, but he held back his questions. Luo Bingting noticed his hesitance and chuckled lightly, "We're heading to the lab. We need to test your abilities, but keep it a secret. It's so unique that I worry someone might want to exploit it for research."

Luo Fan relaxed a bit at her teasing tone, but then again, it dawned on him that they were indeed going to a laboratory — a place typically associated with experiments and danger.

After passing through multiple layers of security, they finally arrived at the lab entrance. Once inside, Luo Fan's nerves eased a little. If there were really bad intentions, the entrance would have been heavily guarded, and he wouldn’t have been allowed in as casually as he was.

Luo Bingting approached the lab where Dr. Zhang was working, ringing the doorbell since her voice wouldn’t carry inside. Before long, Xiao Lu's voice crackled over the intercom, "Hello, Miss Luo! Dr. Zhang is currently testing a subject and will take a little while. Please come in and wait for him."

The door slid open automatically, and Luo Bingting stepped inside, beckoning Luo Fan to follow. As it was Luo Fan's first time in a lab, he was filled with curiosity, eager to explore every corner. 

He was particularly intrigued about what kind of subjects they were working with — perhaps zombies? Thankfully, the room lacked rows of glass jars filled with organs preserved in formaldehyde, which alleviated much of his anxiety.

After a short wait, Dr. Zhang hurried over, carrying a clipboard. He paused upon seeing Luo Fan, smiling, "What's the matter? Is this young man having any issues?"

As he spoke, he flipped through the record book, recalling Luo Fan's case. After a moment, he found it, glanced at the data, and looked back at Luo Bingting, awaiting an explanation.

"Nothing serious, just that his abilities are a bit unique, and I need to conduct a test," she replied casually.

Dr. Zhang became curious, "How unique? What do you want to test?"

Luo Bingting didn’t respond immediately. Instead, she moved toward the door of the inner room, waving Luo Fan over. Dr. Zhang and Xiao Lu leaned in, intrigued by the mystery.

Luo Fan followed her inside, where he found a room with a large glass wall. In the center lay a hospital bed, occupied by a man connected to a breathing machine and other medical devices. The room felt eerily sparse, save for the equipment. 

Luo Bingting instructed Dr. Zhang to open the door, leading Luo Fan into the room. The man on the bed was Wu Xiaogang, who had been in a deep sleep since Luo Bingting brought him back. Dr. Zhang had administered a new sedative that bypassed his drug resistance.

As Luo Fan gazed at the peaceful face of the man on the bed, his heart raced. Were they seriously conducting human experiments? Was it too late for him to run away? 

"Touch Wu Xiaogang's body, anywhere is fine," Luo Bingting encouraged, her tone patient.

Still tense, Luo Fan hesitated but ultimately complied, placing his hand on Wu Xiaogang's shoulder. In an instant, he felt a surge of energy, compelling him to raise his hand.

To his astonishment, three or four nearby machines began to levitate, floating in the air around them.
