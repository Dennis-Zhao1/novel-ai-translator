**Shifting the Balance of Oil**

Luo Binging accepted the gift from the supplier with a beaming smile, expressing how thoughtful it was. She promised to bring a gift in return the next time she came to Huaguo for orders. Both parties were in high spirits, and the Saudi negotiator suggested they have dinner together, but Chris interjected that they had other commitments and could catch up next time when the goods were picked up.

Neither side was one to dawdle. After seeing them off to their car, the Saudi negotiator hurriedly urged the factory to expedite production. They were a major client, and it seemed this was merely a preliminary test. Surely, there would be more orders to come. After all, even ammunition was money.

He couldn't help but marvel at the economic power of Huaguo, his eyes filled with longing for the wealth that came with it.

After returning to the Sailboat Hotel with Chris, Luo Binging found it inconvenient to talk outside. Fortunately, her mission for this trip had been accomplished. Once they ordered their meals, she handed her phone to Chris, asking if he could help her offload a European castle.

Chris glanced at her and agreed without hesitation. After making a couple of calls to determine the castle's selling price, he had the deal sealed within half an hour.

Luo Binging knew that the castle was the most challenging asset to manage overseas, so she was pleasantly surprised at Chris's efficiency. The high commission was well-deserved, as he had successfully facilitated three significant deals in a single day. The buyer was from a European royal lineage, and they had been keenly interested in the castle for a long time. With one party eager to buy and the other willing to sell, they swiftly signed legally binding electronic contracts and transfer agreements. By ten o'clock that evening, the transaction was complete, with money and goods exchanged.

Luo Binging had anticipated a myriad of bureaucratic procedures from the European government, but it turned out that power and status could solve anything. Reflecting on the situation, she lamented the lost opportunity to taste the wines from the castle's vineyard. Chris merely nodded in agreement.

The two stayed at the hotel until nearly 1 AM. Chris received a call indicating that the oil was ready. They hopped in the car and headed to the port, where Chris assisted Luo Binging in inspecting the goods.

Dozens of massive oil drums were filled to the brim with the oil that Luo Binging had purchased. The quoted price included shipping, and the cargo ship at the port was already prepared to set sail for Huaguo, all paperwork in order, although customs clearance might take a bit longer.

The cargo ship had to continuously load and unload goods along its route to remain profitable; merely transporting oil wouldn't cover the costs of a single trip. Thus, despite the size of the oil drums, they were just a small part of the operation. To prevent jostling and friction, the oil was stored separately in a different warehouse, away from other cargo containers.

On the distant deck of the cargo ship, containers were being unloaded. Once Chris confirmed that everything was in order, Luo Binging promptly paid the full amount but insisted on inspecting the oil storage warehouse herself.

Chris, aware of the unique markings associated with the Luo family in Huaguo, obliged and accompanied her to the ship's cargo hold.

Luo Binging expressed her desire to label each oil drum. The crew complied, understanding that such a minor request was no trouble for a big business deal. 

Focusing her energy, Luo Binging began transferring the large quantities of oil from the drums into her space, leaving only two massive drums directly opposite the warehouse door untouched. Before coming to Saudi Arabia, she had asked her assistant to order several empty oil drums, originally intending to buy small amounts of oil abroad over time. To her surprise, they had come in handy much sooner than expected.

Feigning a phone call inside the storage area, she engaged in light-hearted conversation in Chinese, all while discreetly channeling her energy to transfer the oil. This task was no small feat; the sheer volume of oil demanded considerable concentration. Several times, her energy nearly faltered, but she couldn't afford to take a break and meditate in public. She could only urge herself to persist.

After intermittently draining the two oil drums, she pretended to finish her call and stepped back as if walking away. Seizing the moment when no one was watching, she slipped into her space for a brief meditation, cycling her energy a few times. Not daring to linger, she wiped the cold sweat from her brow and walked out of the warehouse with an air of ease.

The entire operation took no more than half an hour. Everyone believed she had been on the phone for nearly twenty minutes. Subsequently, she insisted on locking the warehouse door in person, taking the key with her to hand over to the designated recipient upon her return to Huaguo.

These were all standard procedures, and no one raised any objections. The transaction had gone remarkably smoothly, with the payment received promptly. The third-in-command of the operation warmly sent them off from the cargo ship, and they parted ways, each heading back to their respective endeavors.

Luo Binging's mission in Saudi Arabia was deemed a success. After Chris dropped her back at the Sailboat Hotel, he mentioned that the commission could be settled in ten days. Although both the castle and the oil deals had gone through successfully, the real profits awaited them in the upcoming arms transactions.

Luo Binging was more than pleased. While her account balance was still ample, settling the arms deal in full would leave her short on funds for other necessities. She still needed to stock up on solar panels, generators, and meat from livestock, as well as seeds for fruits and vegetables.

And then there were the Tang knives and the Longquan swords she had long coveted, all of which would require significant expenditures. Even with her wealth of hundreds of billions, Luo Binging couldn't help but feel a pang of poverty. She’d have to return home and liquidate some family assets.

At 2 AM, after tidying herself up, Luo Binging reclined in a lounge chair on the hotel balcony. After a brief nap in her space, she returned in the blink of an eye to review the checklist of supplies she had accumulated. Watching the tally of completed items grow was immensely satisfying.

It was more than just the joy of shopping; it was about standing against the apocalypse. If heaven wouldn't leave her a way out, then she'd carve her own path.

What couldn’t kill her would only make her stronger.

Luo Binging collected the list and felt the weight of the beautiful handgun gifted to her by the Saudi negotiator. It was exquisite, glimmering in the soft light of the night. The body was a pure black, cold to the touch, crafted to maintain a matte finish that wouldn’t reflect light, perfect for stealth in the dark.

She had already thought of who would be on the receiving end of this gift once she returned home, but first, she needed to tackle an urgent and necessary task.

This was something she had planned long in advance. A smirk crept onto her lips, ambiguous between mockery and disdain. Such an expression had never graced her face before, not even to herself. If she were to look in a mirror now, she would feel like a stranger.

Just days after her rebirth, her mindset, mentality, and heart had undergone a complete transformation. The past experiences were impossible to forget, nor did she wish to. Her parents were still waiting for her to avenge them, and those who had wronged her must be stripped of everything and crushed into dust beneath her feet.

Downing her glass of red wine in one go, she stood up and instructed her assistant to book her a flight back to Huaguo. She decided to cut her week-long overseas trip short, feeling quite pleased with herself.

Awakened by her call, her assistant jumped out of bed with a start, ready to embrace another day as a diligent worker.
