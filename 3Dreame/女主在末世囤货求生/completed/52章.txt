**Rebirth of the Mutated**

In the chaotic rush, a few people frantically tried to pull An Min back, while Meng Ge swiftly gathered the scattered ropes. He tied one end around his waist, securing the loop tightly, then threw it over his shoulder as if it were a lifebuoy. Luo Bingting quickly strapped a bundle onto her back, the makeshift flotation device looking oddly fitting against the backdrop of impending danger. The sound of explosions had already attracted a horde of zombies; if they didn’t leave soon, they would all be trapped.

Not far away, the desperate screams of a woman pierced through the air, accompanied by a man’s furious shouts to silence her. Luo Bingting couldn’t fathom what had happened to those people; it was foolish to set off explosions in a situation like this.

The zombies would definitely be drawn to that noise. Suddenly, Meng Ge spoke up, and Luo Bingting’s eyes lit up with hope.

This meant their side was still relatively safe, and they needed to act quickly.

She instructed Meng Ge to tie one end of the fire hose to the nearest car’s tow hook. They all climbed into the trunk, figuring that with their combined weight, they could move the car to block the elevator door. This way, they would be completely secure inside the elevator shaft.

Meng Ge moved with speed; the fire hose was long enough and made of sturdy material. They worked together, signaling to An Min below to prepare for their descent.

As they climbed down the hose, Luo Bingting was the second to last. She used her psychic ability to scan for any approaching zombies. The last to descend was Meng Ge. Just as he was about to pull the car over, a sudden flurry of footsteps echoed, and a group of people appeared at the elevator entrance.

Luo Bingting looked up and saw the same idiots from before. Annoyed, she considered shutting the door to avoid any unnecessary confrontation. The group had brought along a horde of zombies—their persistence was infuriating.

Meng Ge was equally furious, but the newcomers began to grab onto the hose one by one. He couldn’t just kill them here, especially when the woman among them started pleading with a quivering voice, “Hurry, hurry, please!”

Luo Bingting’s murderous intent surged again. Captain Xie was the last one, and he had already taken down several fast-approaching zombies, yet none of his teammates provided cover fire. Instead, they scrambled down alongside the survivors. The deputy also descended, shouting up at the chaos.

“Captain! Hurry down!”

Luo Bingting couldn’t see what Captain Xie was doing, but from his voice and her psychic senses, it was clear he was facing a significant number of zombies.

After a long wait, Captain Xie finally climbed down into the elevator shaft, covered in dirt and grime. Everyone worked together to pull the car to the elevator door, successfully blocking it and feeling a sense of security.

Gasping for breath, Captain Xie glanced at Luo Bingting, noting the clear divide between their groups. He understood that they didn’t want to be entangled with him.

Captain Xie’s handsome face was stormy, like a canvas soaked in ink. An Min couldn’t hold back any longer and asked, “What just happened?”

Everyone was surprised that An Min would speak up now, and Luo Bingting turned her gaze toward him.

The originally eight-member special forces team had dwindled to six. Among the survivors, three women remained, while two of the four men who had fled returned. The deputy was still there, but the young man who had first asked where the captain was had disappeared.

Captain Xie shot a furious glare at the few survivors, feeling utterly drained and unable to respond.

After several changes in expression, the deputy finally spoke up, “These guys attracted a massive horde of zombies. While we were fighting them off, they were just running around. Two of our team members went to save them, and they ended up stealing our grenades, which caused an explosion. Our teammates died because of them!”

If they weren’t soldiers, those idiots would have probably been shot on the spot. Luo Bingting wasn’t surprised; these survivors seemed to be nothing more than moral burdens, utterly useless.

It was unfortunate, but there was no stopping it; after all, they had to watch over the survivors while on a mission. Why not just secure a safe room for them instead?

Luo Bingting couldn’t comprehend it; she felt they deserved what happened. After a long silence, once she regained some strength, she ignored Captain Xie and ordered her team to immediately act and open the elevator door to the second basement level.

At that moment, the survivors protested vehemently, trying desperately to stop them. “What are you doing? Why are you opening the elevator door? You can’t! It’s dangerous!”

Luo Bingting glared at the two men, who were cowering in fear yet still had the audacity to shout at her. Meng Ge pulled out his gun, flicked off the safety, and pointed it at the shouting man.

“This isn’t your place, and this elevator shaft isn’t yours to control. I need to get out now. If you keep yelling, I’ll shoot you right here.”

Meng Ge perfectly fit the role of a ruthless bully, instantly intimidating the other group into silence.

Captain Xie’s team seemed to have cooled, their frustration evident. None of them dared to stop or say another word.

The two shirtless men, now acutely aware of Meng Ge’s weapon and his fierce demeanor, immediately shut up and retreated, almost eager to hide behind the women.

However, the scheming woman among the survivors suddenly brightened up. She had already realized that in this world, only those with power could survive.

Luo Bingting didn’t pay her any mind but remained acutely aware of the woman’s movements. The green tea character was undoubtedly plotting something.

She felt conflicted; memories of hatred from her past life had often left her in emotional turmoil. Why was it that when faced with someone she despised from her previous life, she felt no fear, only a desire to hurt and dominate? Perhaps she had grown stronger in this life, while her enemies had become weaker.

This self-awareness ignited a fierce courage within her, dispelling her fears and the shadows of her heart. Killing her was just a matter of time.

Captain Xie also understood that staying in the elevator shaft was not a viable option. Their mission was incomplete, and they had already lost two team members due to such ridiculous reasons—he felt deeply frustrated.

So, he climbed up to the second basement elevator door, and the survivors shouted again, but Luo Bingting pulled out her gun once more and pointed it at them.

“Go ahead and shout. Attract more zombies to us, and we can all die together. Or let’s see if your voice is faster than my bullet.”

Everyone was focused on the person responsible for opening the door, failing to notice where Luo Bingting had drawn her gun from.

She knew that when it was time to use the gun, she had to. Scaring these cowardly, brainless people demanded a straightforward approach.

With enough manpower, it didn’t take long for the elevator door to open. Luo Bingting ignored the annoying survivors, climbing up the ladder mounted on the side of the elevator shaft.

Meng Ge and Captain Xie had already begun to fight off the zombies; there were quite a few in the corridor.

Luo Bingting was disinterested in drawing her sword, opting instead to shoot the zombies in the head one by one. Her team immediately noticed her mood was off, as if her patience had run dry, teetering on the edge of an explosion.

The image of a cold-faced, little girl slayer stunned Captain Xie and his team. They hadn’t expected her to be such a crack shot, her movements so fluid. Paired with her sharp, practical attire and her stunningly beautiful face, the stark contrast struck a chord with everyone—it was strangely endearing.

They found themselves questioning her identity. Captain Xie, who didn’t keep up with entertainment news, was oblivious to the fact that the woman before them was someone who had made headlines multiple times.

Once they cleared the zombies in the corridor, Luo Bingting coldly examined one of the corpses, checking its ID badge. Confirming it belonged to a laboratory researcher, she finally let out a sigh of relief. They had found their location.

With that, everyone followed her quickly, searching for Zhu’s family. Captain Xie noticed the ID badge and his expression shifted, deciding to ignore the survivors and leading his team to follow.

Luo Bingting used her psychic ability to sense the surrounding situation. Captain Xie seemed to feel something too, pausing for a moment before hastening his steps to keep up with her.

Their bullets had already run dry, and everyone drew their daggers. Captain Xie unsheathed his Tang sword, its tip angled toward the ground.

Luo Bingting and her team were entirely unfamiliar with the layout of the second basement laboratory, so they had to search each area one by one.

After scanning with her psychic ability, she didn’t detect any significant clusters of zombies, so she retracted her focus and started to slash through the zombies one by one.

Once her gun was out of bullets, she didn’t bother searching for a new magazine. With the Longquan sword in her hands, she illuminated the dark space with the cold, gleaming light from her flashlight.

Captain Xie’s interest was piqued by the sword; men have an innate attraction to weapons.

Before long, they had cleaned out the zombies in that area, leaving everyone exhausted. Xiao Qi’s arm, wielding the sword, was aching and trembling slightly. Inside, he couldn’t help but think, “Wow, what a satisfying massacre!”

Meng Ge found an office devoid of zombie bodies, urging everyone to rest and regain their strength. Luo Bingting sat on the floor, pulling out bread and juice from her tactical pack.

Captain Xie’s group sat on the other side, also pulling out their rations—compressed biscuits and mineral water.

Neither side spoke much; this was merely an unexpected collaboration, and Luo Bingting intended to reunite with Zhu’s family and quickly distance herself from these people.
