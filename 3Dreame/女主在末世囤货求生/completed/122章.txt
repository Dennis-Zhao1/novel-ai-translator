**Chapter One**

After finishing a drink in one go, Lo Bingting crumpled the can and tossed it into the trash bin. She headed to the laboratory, buzzing with anticipation for her first day working with Wu Xiaogang. She was eager to see what surprises he would bring her—ideally, the secret of his powers.

Meanwhile, Wu Xiaogang woke up in the middle of the night, bound to a treatment bed. The entire room was stark white, with three walls and a mirror on the fourth. To his left, a closed door loomed ominously. He strained to catch a glimpse of himself in the mirror. His clothes had been changed, leaving him with nothing but the cold, heavy restraints binding him—made of an unknown material that was neither metal nor fabric, pressing painfully against his ribs.

Lo Bingting watched him from behind a one-way mirror, her arms crossed, observing Wu Xiaogang’s confusion and fear. Yesterday, Xiao Lu and Dr. Zhang had drawn his blood and collected some cells for testing. They couldn't perform a craniotomy to study the crystalline core directly, making it challenging to fully understand his abilities.

However, she trusted that the scientists would find a way. Lo Bingting was waiting for Fu Buqi to realize that he was missing an important person—waiting for him to reveal himself.

Her intuition told her that Wu Xiaogang was hiding his true identity, but that didn’t matter now. Even if he confessed his secrets, it would be too late.

Meanwhile, Xie Jinghang was driving with Zhu Yidan and the team, having just left the fortress. Once they were out of sight of the sentries, the vehicle came to a halt by the roadside. Xie Jinghang pulled out a cigarette and lit it. Zhu Yidan hesitated before speaking up.

“Captain Xie, do you think I might have overdone it a bit?”

Xie Jinghang glanced at her through the smoke and casually nodded. The team members in the backseat remained silent, but their eyes were darting around, clearly enjoying the drama unfolding.

Snuffing out his cigarette, Xie Jinghang replied, “I’m not sure if it’ll be useful right away. You’ll just have to endure staying with us in the mountains for a few days.”

Zhu Yidan struggled to understand. Shouldn’t matters of the heart be dealt with promptly? Lo Bingting hadn’t chased after them, which made her wonder if Captain Xie lacked charm.

She suddenly regretted joining them, but then recalled her earlier bold declarations about helping them break the ice. It felt like she was halfway pulling out but couldn’t quite back down.

Her only hope was that her good friend would understand the truth when the time came—that she had gone through great lengths to hold her head high while bearing the burden.

Xie Jinghang didn’t deny that he was testing Lo Bingting. Yet, his actions were more of a signal: Lo Bingting had created a rift between him and Zhu’s family. The eldest daughter of the Zhu family, his longtime friend, had betrayed her. Even if Fu Buqi was cautious, he couldn’t resist taking action.

He parked the vehicle in a concealed thicket, covered it with a camouflage rain tarp, and the group began their trek toward the back mountain of the fortress.

This time, they would wait for their chance.

After the apocalypse, the national network and communication signals had failed shortly thereafter. However, satellite phones were still operational. Xie Jinghang had hacked into a satellite through a chatty entity he called ‘The Noisy Ghost.’ He relied on satellite phones to communicate with his contacts. The night before leaving, he secretly handed Lo Bingting one for real-time communication.

It was a recent reward from completing a costly mission for The Noisy Ghost. Each time he exchanged points, it felt like he was emptying his pockets while enduring its incessant chatter.

Inside his mind, The Noisy Ghost was busy typing and laughing. “Hahaha, host, you have no charm at all! The little fairy didn’t even ask about your relationship with Miss Zhu. Wow, just hilarious!”

“Enough! You’re blinding me with your noise,” Xie Jinghang shot back in his mind.

“Are you angry now? Hehe, host, aren’t you afraid Miss Zhu might mess things up? What will you do then? Don’t expect me to plead your case with Brother Xuanjing,” it teased.

Since the Noisy Ghost upgraded, he could mute its voice but still communicate through subtitles, much like a chat window. It was reminiscent of the screen in Lo Bingting’s space, leaving him to wonder if it was a copycat. Did it pay any copyright fees?

With the Noisy Ghost’s antics, he doubted it could afford the fees, likely mooching off others instead. 

Thinking about it left a bitter taste, and he didn’t feel the need to explain his true intentions to The Noisy Ghost. There was no rush; he could just wait until everything was set in motion before hitting it back.

The group found a man-made cave in the back mountain to use as a temporary campsite. After settling down, Xie Jinghang began delegating tasks.

Back inside the fortress, Lo Bingting was compiling a list of the first batch of applicants for ability awakening with Liu Xiaohui and others. Suddenly, Meng Ge pushed open the office door and entered.

“Anmin has taken over as the sentry leader. I’m overseeing the patrols. Who’s leading the mission?”

Lo Bingting pondered for a moment before responding, “Let’s pause all external missions for now. We should avoid going out unless necessary. We have enough crystals for the time being. The ability users will take turns on duty, ensuring we maintain security during the first batch of awakenings.”

In the afternoon, Dr. Zhang reported that the first batch of ten ability awakening serums had been prepared and was ready for administration.

Lo Bingting kept this information to herself. Her plans were still unfolding, and she needed to wait patiently.

As she anticipated, news soon spread like wildfire, and many were left disappointed when they couldn’t find any leaks. 

“Did you hear? The first batch of materials is limited; only ten serums were produced, and they’re in the lab now.”

“Only ten? Are we even going to get a chance?”

“Definitely not! Your second brother has a shot since he’s in the guard team.”

“Is the guard team prioritized? But there are over twenty people in it now. Who gets to go first?”

“No idea. We’ll have to wait for the notice. The captain will definitely be first; he’s contributed a lot.”

“Is it based on contribution? I heard the captain was dazed for a long time during the last zombie siege.”

“Well, he’s still the captain. If the first batch doesn’t go to him, who will it go to? We’re too old for this.”

“Why wouldn’t we get a chance? We’re just middle-aged women. If Sister Zheng has powers, she can follow Meng Ge into battle. We can do the same if we awaken!”

“That’s right; abilities are based on capability, not age or gender. Why can’t we think like that?”

In the vegetable garden outside the fortress, the aunties weeding and fertilizing gathered to chat. Their usual gossip revolved around trivial matters—who was dating whom—but today, the discussion turned to their own interests, with envy and jealousy evident in their voices.

Unbeknownst to them, Zhu’s Uncle Si had just mixed the fertilizer, made from ash and homemade compost from burnt zombies, which was excellent for plant growth. He was taking his time pouring it, eavesdropping on the conversation.

“You’re right. If I had abilities, I could join Meng Ge and Miss Lo in fighting zombies and collecting crystals instead of toiling in this garden every day,” he mused.

“Hey, Zhu Laosi, if you got powers, would you still be here messing around?” one aunt replied.

Zhu’s Uncle Si’s expression darkened, and he chose not to respond.

Another aunt nudged him playfully. “In the past, the Zhu family always had priority, but not anymore. That eldest daughter of the Zhu family ran off with Lo Miss’s man. Talk about double betrayal. The Zhu family will be lucky to get anything at all, waiting until the end of the line. Times have changed!”

The other aunties perked up at this gossip, eagerly exchanging tales about the tangled love affairs among the three, as if they were recounting a dramatic story they had witnessed firsthand. They painted Lo Bingting as the pitiful victim, a woman of power now robbed of her fiancé by her own best friend.

The Zhu family would surely weaken due to the eldest daughter’s betrayal. With no real power, how could they expect to awaken any abilities? They would end up at the bottom, subject to bullying and scorn.

The tales grew more outrageous with each retelling, as if the author’s keyboard was begging to be turned over to these gossiping aunties, who could spin tales far better than anyone else.

As if tired of listening to such insulting remarks, Zhu’s Uncle Si turned the wheelbarrow around and walked away, faintly hearing the chatter behind him.

“They’re still so arrogant, even at this point. What’s there to be proud of?”

“Yeah, the Zhu family has only three ability users left, and one of them ran away. What a joke, pretending to be all high and mighty!”
