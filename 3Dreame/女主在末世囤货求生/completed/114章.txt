**Blood-Red Crystal Core**

At this moment, Luo Bingting had transformed into a merciless killing machine. Without a hint of hesitation, she took action against these low-level foes, all of whom possessed abilities no higher than Level Three. She swiftly dispatched all the enemies on the first floor, her strikes precise and lethal. To prevent them from using their abilities to damage the old mansion, she ensured that her attacks were swift, accurate, and left no room for resistance.

Ascending the stairs to the second floor, she found a number of people sitting or lying around in the rooms. Without a moment’s hesitation, she knocked on the doors, and upon making eye contact, she eliminated them instantly. The people working for Fu Buqi didn’t require further investigation.

Her previous room was in utter chaos, the walls marred with bullet holes. Enraged, Luo Bingting intensified her approach, directly tapping into her mental abilities to unleash explosive force upon their crystal cores, causing them to die in agonizing helplessness, reminiscent of the despair brought on by this apocalyptic world.

When she reached the last room, she swung the door open only to find a young girl, no older than fifteen or sixteen, barely clothed and shackled by iron chains. The girl’s lifeless eyes were wide open, her body covered in dark bruises. The moment Luo Bingting laid eyes on her, she realized that the girl was already dead, her body still warm. These beasts had gotten off too easily.

Upon inspecting the third floor, she discovered that there was still someone present. Closing the door quietly behind her, she ascended to the third floor. A quick sweep of her mental power revealed only a single man, whose identity remained uncertain. He seemed oblivious to the chaos occurring below.

Having swiftly dispatched over twenty individuals, Luo Bingting felt the toll of her abilities beginning to wear on her. She reached for a crystal core, absorbing its energy just as she arrived at the top of the stairs.

The man sat casually on the balcony of the third floor, and it struck her that she had overlooked something crucial: there were no zombies in the vicinity at all. This was unusual; the old mansion was enclosed by a wall less than three meters high. Normally, no matter how thorough the cleaning, some zombies would inevitably linger nearby.

With all the crystal cores absorbed, the man lounged on the sofa, his gaze fixed intently on her. 

In an instant, Luo Bingting unleashed her ice needles, sending a deluge of hard, hair-thin ice projectiles soaring towards him. Yet, the next moment, she watched in disbelief as all the ice needles froze mid-air, suspended as if caught in time.

As she stepped forward to launch another attack, she found herself unable to move. A jolt of panic surged through her—what kind of ability was this? It was something she had never encountered before. The man tilted his head and smiled at her.

“A woman comes alone, thinking she can kill me? How amusing,” he said.

Confused, Luo Bingting attempted to respond, but an unseen force constricted around her neck.

“Weren’t you quite decisive down there? Why so weak now?” 

Luo Bingting felt the pressure tightening against her, her back stiffening, her hair standing on end. In a surge of determination, she released her mental energy, shattering the bindings in an instant. The man’s expression shifted from confidence to shock as he realized she had broken free. Without a moment’s hesitation, he turned to flee, but Luo Bingting was quicker, launching two ice needles that pierced his calves. 

As he fell, the control over the ice needles vanished, and she continued to unleash her barrage, transforming the sofa into a pincushion.

Now, with a clearer view of him, she noted his appearance—he was a man of no more than twenty-five, of average height, with a slightly lecherous air about him. Now, sprawled on the floor and wailing in pain, he seemed a far cry from the confident figure who had earlier evaded her ice needles, as if he were two different people.

With disdain, she looked at the injured man, who was now crying out in agony. 

“Still want to provoke me? Who do you think you’re looking down on?” 

Without waiting for a reply, she raised her hand again.

The man, frightened, shouted for her to wait.

Luo Bingting had no intention of listening to him, but then she heard him plead, “Don’t kill me! If you’re seeking revenge, you’ve got the wrong person. I was also captured and locked up here!”

Raising an eyebrow, she scrutinized his teary face. Seeing that she had genuinely paused, the man quickly straightened his demeanor.

“I swear it’s true! I don’t know these people at all! My name is Wu Xiaogang. I used to be a mechanic, but when the zombie outbreak happened, I was captured and brought here. They kept injecting me with drugs, and I was mostly unconscious for most of the time. Just recently, I was moved here to be kept locked up. I really haven’t done anything, I haven’t provoked anyone!”

Who would believe such a story? His previous display of power was hardly that of someone who had been imprisoned. He might not have been able to handle Luo Bingting, but the others downstairs were all Level Three abilities—he should have been no match for them either.

Wu Xiaogang, sensing her indifference, trembled as he pleaded, “Heroine, spare my life! I really don’t know them—I’m not lying!”

Luo Bingting seemed to consider something, her gaze piercing into his watery eyes. “But you have abilities, don’t you? You look quite capable. Why didn’t you just escape?”

Wu Xiaogang shuddered. Luo Bingting’s expression was unsettling, her smile eerily cold. 

“My abilities only awakened recently. Before that, I was half-conscious. I realized my power only after being brought to this house. I was tied to a bed until a few days ago when a man came to talk about a partnership. I agreed just so I could move freely on the third floor.”

Luo Bingting concluded that the man he spoke of was likely Fu Buqi himself, and he must have had some new scheme. She pressed further, “What about your abilities? You don’t seem like a mental-type user.”

“I don’t know! One day, I was lying in bed when there was an explosion outside that woke me up. I realized the room I was in was falling apart, and in a panic, I used my powers to stop all the collapsing pillars and walls. I escaped, but barely made it a few steps before I passed out again. The next thing I knew, I was here.”

At this moment, Luo Bingting was piecing together the puzzle far more thoroughly than Wu Xiaogang. If he was indeed a captive of Fu Buqi, and if he had been scheming for a long time, he must have been aware of the situation well in advance. Now, he was making it clear that he intended to use Wu Xiaogang—this man’s unusual abilities were undoubtedly of great value to Fu Buqi.

Determined to investigate further, Luo Bingting forced her mental energy across his crystal core and discovered that its color was distinctly different. While others had cores corresponding to their attributes, his was blood-red.

Curiosity piqued, Luo Bingting decided to spare his life, intending to take him back to her lab for research. If she could draw out Fu Buqi, all the better.

With that thought, she pulled out a tranquilizer needle, catching Wu Xiaogang off guard as she injected him.

The drug took effect quickly, and he collapsed to the ground.

Dragging him by the nape of his neck like a lifeless dog, Luo Bingting pulled him out of the old mansion and discarded him in the garden outside.

She methodically cleared the scene of the twenty dead bodies, including that of the chained girl. What had begun as a pleasant visit to the old mansion had turned into a nightmare, further fueling her hatred for Fu Buqi.

Gritting her teeth, she raised her hand and stored the old mansion into her space. Looking back at the large pit left in its place, she noted that the foundation was dug quite deep.

She secured the unconscious Wu Xiaogang in the trunk of her car. After driving a short distance away, she fired two rocket-propelled grenades at the pit where the mansion once stood, obliterating it completely before speeding back to the fortress.

The thunderous explosions would surely attract hordes of zombies, leaving Fu Buqi with a delightful appetizer.
