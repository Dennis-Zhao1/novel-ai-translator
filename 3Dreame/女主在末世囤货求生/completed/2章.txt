**Rebirth**

The evening glow spread across the sky, painting a romantic palette of fiery reds and deep blues, as the luxurious apartment bedroom fell into a darkness that felt as deep as midnight, with curtains drawn and the door firmly shut. 

In the bed, a woman lay cozily wrapped in an obviously high-quality, soft blanket. Yet, beads of cold sweat glistened on her forehead, her brows furrowed tightly, and her face contorted in pain as she mumbling something inaudible, lost in a restless slumber. 

Suddenly, as if struck hard by an unseen force, her back arched violently, her eyes flying open, pupils dilated like a drowning person gasping for air. She flailed her arms, grasping at the empty air around her.

At that moment, a jarring ring echoed through the room, the doorbell chiming insistently, pulling her from her torment. Struggling to sit upright, her widened eyes gradually returned to their normal size. The relentless ringing continued, blending into the silence of the room, making her suppressed gasps seem less noticeable.

Time passed in an undetermined blur as she sat on the edge of her bed, unblinking, fixated on the door until the ringing finally ceased. 

With a sudden burst of energy, she leaped off the bed, carelessly knocking over a glass that shattered as it hit the tiled floor. Ignoring the sharp pain in her bare feet, she yanked the door open and dashed out.

The light streaming in from the evening glow left her momentarily stunned. This was…?! Her flat, the one she had inhabited before the apocalypse—was this a dream?

She pinched herself hard, feeling nothing. In a frenzy, she slapped her own face several times, the sounds echoing in the stillness of the room. The sting on her arms and cheeks, coupled with the fresh pain from the glass shards beneath her feet, grounded her in reality.

Disregarding the fiery pain on her face and soles, the woman was desperate to confirm something. She hurried back to her room, flipped on the light, and reached for her phone charging on the bedside table. The screen lit up, revealing the date: April 20, 2355. She had returned to a month before the apocalypse.

Wiping the blood seeping from her foot, she collapsed onto the bed. Her eyes fell on the notifications—missed calls and messages from company stakeholders, employees, and property management. 

Amid a flurry of red notifications from friends and business partners, she felt an odd sense of urgency. Just then, another call came through, vibrating insistently in her hand, catching her off guard. She hurriedly answered, her heart racing.

“Hello, Miss Luo? This is Xiao Liao, the property manager from Yunding Fenghua. I apologize for the intrusion. Last week, you expressed interest in purchasing the adjacent unit, and we’ve spoken with the owner. They would like to meet with you. When would be a good time tomorrow?”

It dawned on her—this was a remnant of her past life. Luo Bingting lowered her lashes, her mind racing through memories before she replied, “No, I’ve changed my mind. Please tell the owner I’m no longer interested. I’m sorry for the trouble.”

Her voice was calm yet cold, leaving the property manager feeling a mix of disappointment over the lost commission. “Understood, Miss Luo. If you have any future real estate needs, don’t hesitate to contact me. Have a great day.”

After hanging up, Luo Bingting clutched her phone tightly, her heart pounding violently in her chest. Suddenly, all the suppressed emotions burst forth, and she found herself sobbing uncontrollably, tears streaming down her face.

The pain of betrayal and the haunting truth of her parents’ deaths surged within her, choking her with rage and grief. She pounded her chest in frustration, only to feel a sharp pain from her fist. Through her tear-blurred vision, she fished out an object that had been digging into her palm. It was the white jade dragon pendant her grandfather had given her—the only thing she had managed to hold onto before her tragic end.

Memories of her loving grandfather flooded her mind, the man who had showered her with affection yet was now gone forever. Overwhelmed, she clutched the pendant tightly, collapsing onto her bed in a heap of sorrow.

“Where… am I?” she gasped, her mind racing with confusion. Images of familiar memes flashed through her thoughts: Who am I? Where am I? What am I doing here?

The once-soft bed she adored had transformed into an expanse of barren earth, devoid of any sounds or life. In the distance, she spotted something resembling a mirror, which suddenly illuminated, like a startup screen. Panic surged through her—what was happening? 

With a thought, she found herself back on her bedroom bed. “What the hell…?” 

Luo Bingting felt a wave of disbelief wash over her. Was she losing her mind? Had she just experienced a hallucination? The image of the dusty ground and the huge mirror lingered in her mind until, in a flash, she was seated on the barren land once more.

As if to help her unravel this mystery, the mirror activated, splitting into two screens. The left side displayed traditional characters: “Welcome to the Jade Dragon Secret Realm.” The right side showcased two sundials, their shadows cast in different positions, moving at varying speeds.

Luo Bingting stared in confusion. What was this? The Jade Dragon Secret Realm? Thankfully, her grandfather had educated her in traditional Chinese culture, and her family’s library was filled with ancient texts in traditional characters.

But secret realms were typically found in cultivation or fantasy novels, filled with treasures, magical beasts, and mystical herbs. Shouldn’t there be an abundance of spiritual energy here? Instead, it felt eerily still, as if time itself had stopped.

And the sundials—those were ancient timekeepers! She understood that much, but the exact time they corresponded to was beyond her grasp. 

Her forehead twitched slightly as she struggled to process it all. What nonsense was this? Luo Bingting mentally berated the absurdity of it all, her thoughts spilling out like a commentary track.

There weren’t even instructions! Yet, based on her knowledge, this appeared to be some kind of spatial realm.

A space?! Wasn’t that just like the spatial abilities seen in apocalyptic novels? A place to store supplies—perfect for surviving and even thriving in a post-apocalyptic world…

With a sudden determination, she concentrated and stepped into the space, grabbing a decorative item from her bedside table before re-emerging. She repeated the process several times, grabbing anything within reach to test the limits of this newfound realm.

Remembering how, shortly after the zombie outbreak, the global magnetic field had shifted, granting many the powers she had lacked, she felt a swell of emotion. She had been utterly defenseless, forced to rely on others who had succumbed to their darker instincts.

Her eyes glistened with unshed tears as her lips pressed into a thin line, but deep within, she vowed that this time would be different. Everything they had taken from her, she would reclaim. All their plans would crumble, and in the end, they would face the consequences of their actions—she would make them pay for the suffering they had caused, seeking redemption for her parents in the process.
