**Secrets Unveiled**

The chaos outside had no effect on Luo Bingtian's actions. Many soldiers rushing by merely glanced at her driving a jeep inside the base, mistaking her for a commanding officer or an ability user heading to provide assistance.

As she emerged, it became clear that the explosion sites were scattered across the base, cleverly positioned to force the support troops into a frantic back-and-forth struggle. 

Approaching the combat zone, she noticed the absence of Fu Buqi's figure. Luo Bingtian could easily sense that the battle between the two sides was extremely tense; in a scenario where both were evenly matched, it was inevitable that they would feel somewhat powerless.

She had no idea which faction was opposing the Kunshan Base; it was likely just a few bases invited today. 

With only one thought in her mind—to find Fu Buqi and put him to death—Luo Bingtian completely failed to notice that a familiar figure was drawing near amidst the fighting.

She turned the car around, planning to head to Fu Buqi's office to search for him.

Suddenly, her car door was yanked open. Luo Bingtian instinctively reacted, conjuring an ice spike, which was shattered mid-air by a bolt of lightning.

Only then did she clearly see that it was Xie Jinghang. Accelerating, she looked at him, his clothes stained with blood, and asked in surprise, "When did you arrive? Was the explosion your doing?"

Xie Jinghang's face was pale; it was unclear where he was injured, and how much blood on him was his own. He nodded weakly, saying, "I snuck in that night after we parted. After all, this is my home base; I have some connections. Cough, cough."

After wiping his mouth with his sleeve, he self-deprecatingly added, "No matter how strong my abilities are, I can't withstand the power of modern firearms. I need a moment to rest."

Saying this, he pulled out a level two attribute-less crystal core and began to absorb its energy. 

Luo Bingtian didn't bother him; she needed to withdraw quickly. Given his injuries, she couldn't just leave him behind, especially since his explosions had helped her significantly.

Just as she drove out of the Kunshan Base gate, Xie Jinghang suddenly conjured a shield out of thin air, lunging toward Luo Bingtian.

In an instant, she caught sight of his blood-soaked face as he coughed up blood and closed his eyes. The shockwave from the explosion lifted both him and the car off the ground, giving her a weightless feeling. Instinctively, Luo Bingtian pulled him into her spatial realm.

Once inside the space, Luo Bingtian looked at Xie Jinghang, who was still lying on her. He was nearly six feet tall—though he appeared lean, he was surprisingly heavy. With the shield in his hand, they were easily over four hundred pounds together, making it impossible for her to move.

Seeing she couldn’t push him off, Luo Bingtian decided to lie back and relax. After being tense for so long and feeling the heaviness in her chest from the explosion’s shockwave, she was grateful for the ample spiritual energy in the space, soothing her meridians like a warm spa. She soon drifted off to sleep.

Unbeknownst to her, the mirror in the space started to glow faintly, signaling a change.

Luo Bingtian rolled over in her sleep and suddenly woke up, finding Xie Jinghang standing there, clutching his chest and looking around in confusion. 

Her heart sank with a single thought: “This is bad!”

The biggest secret had been exposed.

Xie Jinghang, waking up to find himself on top of the young woman, felt a bit embarrassed. However, as he realized he had no idea where he was, he was completely bewildered. 

It felt like another dimension, with a primal aura mixed with seemingly chaotic yet orderly modern artifacts. Some items were understandable—like the RV and modified jeep—but the yacht, helicopter, and a pile of firearms and missile launchers were simply incomprehensible. The shock in his heart was beyond words; if he had to express it in two words, it would be "What the hell?"

Luo Bingtian was already contemplating whether to silence him. Exposing her spatial powers and revealing this space were two different matters. But thinking about how he had shielded her and coughed up blood for her, it was difficult to act on that thought.

Seeing her wake up, Xie Jinghang stood there with a perplexed expression, lost in thought.

He took the initiative to ask, “Where is this? You don’t happen to have instant teleportation or time travel abilities, do you?”

Luo Bingtian looked at him as if he were crazy. What kind of wild imagination was that? She was feeling a mix of annoyance, confusion, and helplessness when suddenly, something clicked, and she stared into Xie Jinghang's eyes, asking, "Do you have spatial abilities or the power to summon objects? How did you conjure that shield? Don't tell me you've awakened some kind of metal ability?"

Luo Bingtian pointed at the black-golden matte shield on the ground. The metal quality and craftsmanship didn’t seem like products from this era. Xie Jinghang followed her gaze and fell silent.

Well, neither of them was in a better situation.

Luo Bingtian crossed her arms defiantly, looking at Xie Jinghang. Even though he had the upper hand, she didn’t feel at a loss; everyone had their secrets.

Feeling a bit guilty under her gaze, Xie Jinghang rubbed his nose, still pondering how to explain things.

At that moment, the mirror emitted a faint glow, attracting Luo Bingtian's attention. 

Upon closer inspection, she noticed a line of simplified Chinese characters appearing on the previously blank screen: 

"Hello, hello, look at me, right here, beautiful girl, come closer, hee hee."

Xie Jinghang also felt it, looking up at the mirror. His expression immediately turned complex.

Luo Bingtian was dumbfounded. What was this situation? Did the mirror have a bug? Or was it being hacked by aliens? No, considering the context, it felt more like possession.

Her mind flitted through a jumble of thoughts until she heard Xie Jinghang grit his teeth, saying, “What kind of nonsense are you up to?”

Luo Bingtian thought he was talking to her, surprised to look at him, only to find that he was still focused on the mirror, not sparing her a glance.

What was going on?

The mirror’s screen continued to input in simplified Chinese: 

“Relax, host. Didn’t you bring me here for a visit? Big Brother Mirror is really nice and even prepared a luxurious suite for me. So comfortable!”

Xie Jinghang was speechless. No wonder he hadn’t sensed this noisy thing when he woke up. But what in the world was going on? He looked back at Luo Bingtian, only to see her with a serious expression, staring at him as if demanding an explanation.

The situation was getting out of control. Xie Jinghang realized that unless he explained something, this might not end well, so he resigned himself to speak.

“Do you... read web novels?”

He quickly added, “Male-oriented ones.”

Luo Bingtian was bewildered by this nonsensical opening and had to question whether he was joking. Yet Xie Jinghang was seriously waiting for her answer.

“No.”

Feeling pressured under his gaze, she responded with annoyance.

Xie Jinghang nodded, satisfied with her answer, and continued, “It’s kind of like the situation of a male protagonist in a fantasy apocalypse web novel.”

Luo Bingtian didn’t quite understand and remained silent, looking at him.

“It’s the classic trope of a handsome, powerful, and tragically fated male lead, commonly referred to as a ‘beautiful, strong, and tragic’ character.”

Understanding dawned on Luo Bingtian. So he was just that narcissistic.

“Just right, I fit those criteria. So even though I became a powerful ability user in my previous life, I still ended up dying tragically. In this new life, I gained a system to help me, and the ultimate outcome is to reach the pinnacle.”

Xie Jinghang had initially struggled to say this but found himself speaking more freely. It felt liberating to let go of his inhibitions. He even added a note to save face, “All of this is just a direct quote from the system; I just happened to have a system after my rebirth.”

“Just a system? So humble!” Luo Bingtian thought. “How can you be so nonchalant about it?”

Luo Bingtian had long suspected he either had precognitive abilities or, like her, was reborn. Yet, she was surprised to learn he had a system. Unable to resist, she asked, “What does this system do? Transform into shields?”

Xie Jinghang nodded, “The noisy thing’s biggest ability is a weapon exchange function. As long as you have enough points, you can get any weapon.”

He paused, adding, “But it’s different from these; it’s more high-tech and futuristic.”

After gesturing toward the military gear in the distance, he continued, “So, what you’re saying is that this system called the ‘noisy guy’ has more functions than just exchanging weapons. But what are points?”

“Points are earned by completing tasks issued by the noisy guy. Once completed, you can earn points, and crystal cores can also be exchanged for points.”

Luo Bingtian understood. The system required transactions to establish a partnership, but how did it communicate with the mirror? What form did it exist in?

Xie Jinghang had no answer for that either. Seeing she had no further questions, he asked in return, “And what about this mirror? What’s its situation?”

Luo Bingtian saw how open he was about his own situation and, having known him for so long without betrayal, hesitated briefly before deciding to reveal more.

She explained the basic situation, and Xie Jinghang was taken aback.

So she was like him—reborn and bound to a space. Looking around at the environment and the massive stockpile of supplies and weapons, he understood how difficult it had been for her to hide her secrets.

Learning she had tragically died at the hands of Fu Buqi and his son only fueled his anger, for he had faced a similar fate.

After sharing their secrets, both felt significantly lighter. This exchange of secrets brought them closer together, and it felt surprisingly good.
