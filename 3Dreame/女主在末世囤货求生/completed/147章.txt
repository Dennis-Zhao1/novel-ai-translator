**The White Lotus' Struggle**

That night, Adam Song did not rest; instead, he waited for the ten individuals at the Dragon Base who had been injected with the awakening serum to regain consciousness.

“Captain, something's wrong!” 

The deputy, panting heavily, quickly recounted the recent events. Upon seeing the damp paper ball in his hand, he immediately contacted Serena Zhou via satellite phone.

In reality, they could have arranged for all nineteen individuals to awaken at once. However, they were uncertain what kind of tricks the White Lotus could pull and whether there were any insiders still lurking within the fortress.

They had truly underestimated her. Initially, they believed she was just an ordinary person, harmless and naïve, perhaps a little cunning. But appearances could be deceiving…

Serena Zhou arrived shortly, bringing the two men to the laboratory. 

Handing the paper ball to Dr. Zhang and Little Lu, they swiftly analyzed the powder to determine its nature. The results came back quickly: it was surprisingly a non-toxic and harmless plant extract. 

Everyone was puzzled. Why would someone pour a harmless substance into the sewers at midnight?

“Do we know which plant it was extracted from?” Serena suddenly asked. Little Lu paused for a moment before responding, 

“I don’t know; there’s no record of it in existing data.”

Serena glanced at Adam, recalling the four mutated plant seeds. Unfortunately, she no longer had the seeds on hand; otherwise, they could have made a comparison. The deputy sighed in relief, thinking he was prepared for the worst—something truly poisonous that could kill without a trace.

However, Serena decided it was best not to let the White Lotus roam free any longer. It would be easier to control her, and perhaps this would lead them to catch a bigger fish.

The next morning, everyone at the Dragon Base completed their awakening process. Unfortunately, none emerged as mutated supernatural beings. 

Dr. Zhang documented this; the odds had decreased a little more. Yet, the individuals were not disheartened. The chance to become supernatural beings was beyond what anyone had expected, and they felt fortunate—what more could they ask for?

A notice was immediately sent out for the second batch at Dragon Base to undergo the awakening process, starting with a health examination.

The White Lotus was included in this group. Initially, she felt disappointed, her spirits plummeting, but unexpectedly, good news arrived. Determined to present herself in the best light, she began preparing herself as soon as she received the information.

When Serena saw the White Lotus again, she had transformed her appearance. She wore a long white dress again, but her hair, which she usually wore down, was now styled into a sweet, high bun that accentuated her high forehead and small face. Despite the lack of makeup and the dark circles under her eyes, her spirits seemed considerably lifted, with a noticeable flush on her cheeks. 

If this were the pre-apocalyptic world, she could have made a good living as a beauty influencer.

She deliberately positioned herself at the front, firmly claiming the center stage, all the while casting flirtatious glances at Adam and the deputy. These weren't crude or overtly suggestive; instead, her eyes danced over them, hinting at unspoken words, quickly darting away from direct contact, alluring yet innocent.

Unfortunately, her charms fell on blind eyes; Adam didn’t react at all. The deputy, however, diligently exchanged glances with her for a while.

Serena and the others watched with cold eyes as the White Lotus and the others entered for their health checks, after which they were directed to the specialized awakening ward.

After everyone was injected with the serum, they soon fell into a deep slumber. This serum had undergone numerous improvements and adjustments, leading to shorter sleep and awakening times compared to the previous batch.

Once one of them was hooked up to the machines, the deputy immediately pushed the White Lotus’ bed out. 

Their destination was the underground interrogation room, the same place where they had previously interrogated the Zhu family traitors.

When the White Lotus slowly awakened, she found her surroundings shrouded in darkness, eerily quiet—she could not even hear the breathing of others. She felt as though she was lying not on a bed but on a cold, hard floor.

Reaching out to touch it confirmed her suspicion; it was indeed rough and icy. She fumbled to sit up, calling out several times, but no one responded. As she became more alert, she immediately recalled that she was supposed to be undergoing her awakening.

Raising her hand in an attempt to mimic the gestures of supernatural beings releasing their powers, she soon realized that there was no response. 

Panic set in. How could this be? What happened…?

Unable to contain her despair, she screamed, her voice sharp and piercing, soon devolving into curses. 

“Serena Zhou, Adam Song, Zhu Yidan, come out! Are you playing games with me? How dare you lie to me? You all deserve to die!”

Her shrill voice echoed in the pitch-black room, but no one answered.

She crawled on the ground desperately searching for something to illuminate her surroundings; there was nothing but the cold, rough floor.

The suffocating silence and darkness could easily drive someone mad. Outside, Serena and Adam stood, expressionless, listening to her cries without any sign of concern.

It wasn’t until they heard her sobbing that they signaled their subordinates to turn on the lights. Serena and Adam then pushed the door open.

When the lights suddenly flickered on after being in darkness for so long, the White Lotus squinted against the blinding brightness, momentarily stunned. She had fallen to the floor, and her once pristine white dress was now marred with dark stains, making her appear filthy. Her bun had come undone, and her face was streaked with tears, her eyes red as if she had lost her sanity.

Serena couldn’t suppress her mocking smile, arms crossed in front of her chest, her gaze dripping with derision.

The White Lotus despised being looked down upon by others. In an instant, she exploded, jumping up to point at Serena, shouting, 

“What’s so great about you? How dare you play me! Pei Qian has already paid with crystals; don’t you fear I’ll tell him?”

“Little girl, how naive you are! We’re in an apocalyptic world now; what rules are there to follow anymore?” 

Serena replied coldly, her tone laced with ice, causing the White Lotus to flinch.

“Besides, do you really think Pei Qian will stand up for you against me? I could squash you like an ant… and he wouldn’t be able to do a thing!”

“Do you think you’re Pei Chang? You’re overestimating yourself! You’re just a pawn; do you think you’re worthy?”

If Zhu Yidan were present, she would undoubtedly give her sister a thumbs-up—this was so satisfying and refreshing.

Suddenly, something clicked in the White Lotus's mind, and she quickly changed her strategy, adopting a pitiful tone towards Adam, 

“Brother Adam, why have you let them bully me like this after not seeing me for days?”

“I didn’t do anything! There must be some misunderstanding; I can explain! Please help me!”

When it came to changing faces, no one could match the White Lotus's agility; Serena watched, astonished, momentarily reluctant to let the White Lotus perish easily. After all, witnessing such dramatic shifts in personality was a rare treat since the art of face-changing had become nearly extinct in this apocalyptic era.

Adam, utterly disinterested in her performance, pulled a paper bag from his pocket and tossed it onto the ground in front of the White Lotus. 

Seeing the familiar item, her body involuntarily trembled, and she quickly glanced up at Adam.

“You know about it?”

“Know about what?” 

Serena interjected immediately.

“Know that I…” 

In the rapid exchange, the White Lotus almost revealed too much but quickly shut her mouth, regaining her composure.

Serena wasn’t in a hurry; it was clear from her reaction that she knew exactly what the item was and was fully aware of her actions and their consequences.

With a disdainful smirk, she said, “I suggest you come clean. If you don’t, everything that happens afterward, you’ll regret not seizing this opportunity.”

“Ha! What can you do to me? I wouldn't have dared to come if I didn’t have the confidence. You’re the one who should be scared of regretting it!” 

Realizing that the route with Adam was futile, the White Lotus decided to go all out, throwing caution to the wind.

Serena found her defiant attitude amusing; she had no idea what was in store for her.

Exchanging a glance with Adam, Serena pulled out a foldable lounge chair from her spatial ability and sat down casually. The White Lotus's eyes widened in shock as she pointed at her.

“You… you actually have spatial abilities? You’re a dual-element supernatural being!”

Her voice trembled, a mix of shock and fear.

“It’s you, isn’t it? You were behind all of this!”

Suddenly, she shrieked in hysteria, charging at Serena, raising her hand to unleash a bolt of lightning toward her.

Instantly, the White Lotus collapsed to the ground, her body convulsing from the electric shock, but her gaze remained filled with resentment as she stared at Serena, as if she harbored some deep-seated hatred.
