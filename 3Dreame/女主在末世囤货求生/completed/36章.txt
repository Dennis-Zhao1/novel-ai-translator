**The Dragon Spring Sword**

Next to the hotel, she rented a nondescript little warehouse that had previously been used for storing tables and chairs during events. The choice was primarily due to the lack of surveillance cameras; the nearest ones were at the hotel’s front and back entrances, while the sides were basically free from monitoring.

It was a bit of a distance from the main road, allowing vehicles to approach without attracting too much attention. The catering was arranged for 100 portions from various restaurants, a quantity suited for team-building events or conferences, ensuring it didn’t raise suspicions. Since they arrived early enough, there was ample time for the vendors to prepare the meals, and even the delivery times were staggered to avoid overlap.

None of this raised any alarms for her bodyguard, Max. She felt relatively safe in the country and didn't require his close protection; instead, she sent him out to buy some gifts. Without someone like Chris around, everything was more complicated.

She let out a slight sigh of relief, grateful that things were nearing completion. Her account balance confirmed that she could wrap up these exhausting days soon. The Australian beef and chocolates had already been received by several families; they weren’t particularly interested in these supplies, likely seeing the amount as a small stash for a young girl, so they didn’t feel comfortable dividing it up. That worked out well, as she had no intention of hoarding beef but planned to save her funds for medications and perhaps even some cold weapons.

While waiting for the takeout information at the hotel, she received a call from Max, confirming that the gifts had been purchased and he was heading out to rent a vehicle. At the same time, she contacted the Dragon Spring Sword representatives to schedule a meeting, cleverly timing it to avoid conflicting with the delivery of her meals.

Max, having been sent out again, knew there was no rush and could move freely. Meanwhile, she waited in her hotel room for the food to arrive. Starting at 10:30 AM, box trucks and vans began arriving with the meals. She had ordered from nearly ten different places, including stir-fried dishes and business meal boxes. Thankfully, the timing was just right, allowing her to unload one delivery before the next arrived.

As long as things went smoothly, she was satisfied. If they didn’t, it would be fine; her goals were bigger than any minor setbacks. She had donned a mask, ensuring no one could identify her. It wasn’t until nearly 1 PM that all the deliveries had been gathered. She thought ahead to her next stop—buying a Tang knife—and felt a wave of excitement. She had wasted so much time and opportunity on takeout, primarily relying on home-cooked meals or dining at restaurants, as she had never developed a habit of ordering takeaway.

Seizing this last opportunity, she aimed to ensure every meal of the day and even her late-night snacks were arranged perfectly. In her previous life, she hadn’t tasted spicy strips until she joined the base; this time, she was determined to have her takeout neatly organized.

Luo Bingtian was a very punctual person, a fundamental trait of a successful businessperson. She arrived at the meeting place on time, which was a charming farm-style establishment with ancient architecture. A few private cars were parked outside, and a large patch of bamboo grew behind the courtyard.

This tranquil environment felt oddly mismatched with the cold, sharp Dragon Spring swords she was there to acquire. Approaching the entrance, she rapped on the door with the copper knocker. Moments later, she heard hurried footsteps approaching, and the door swung open to reveal a disheveled young man with dark circles under his eyes.

He stood there shirtless, his skin slightly flushed and sweating despite it being May and not yet full summer. Upon seeing the slender, pretty young woman at the door, his face turned crimson, and the sweat on his forehead seemed to increase. Max, ever perceptive, stepped forward and handed him the gift bag.

The young man hesitated to accept it, when a middle-aged man called out, “Anmin, is there a guest?”

“Yes, Uncle, there are two people at the door,” the young man, Anmin, replied loudly.

“Then hurry and bring the guests in, don’t block the door!” The man continued with a string of local dialect exclamations.

Anmin scratched his head, messing up his hair further, and quickly took the gift bag from Max’s hands, stepping aside to let them in.

The courtyard was small, featuring only a two-meter tall tree. On the left was a single-story wing, directly opposite the main two-story house, while the right was bounded by a wall. Between the main house and the wall was a narrow two-meter-wide path leading who knows where.

Anmin led Luo Bingtian into the left-wing room, which was designed like a tea room. A middle-aged man was already seated at the tea table, boiling water. Upon seeing them, he stood up to welcome them and invited them to sit down, introducing himself as Mr. Zheng, who primarily handled client reception.

Luo Bingtian sat while Max stood behind her. The man seemed unfazed by this arrangement, but Anmin shot them a few curious glances.

While the water boiled, no one spoke. Mr. Zheng focused intently on brewing the tea and served it, sliding a cup toward Luo Bingtian before turning to Max. “Let’s have a cup of tea together. I only serve my esteemed guests this.”

Luo Bingtian nodded at Max, who then took a seat, and they both savored the tea. It was indeed delightful, entering the palate with a sweet and refreshing taste, leaving a pleasant aftertaste. Luo Bingtian nodded in approval, while Max, unable to discern the quality of the tea, simply enjoyed the flavor.

After they all had a cup, Mr. Zheng began to refill their cups and said, “Enjoy your tea first; I’ll take you to see our goods shortly.”

Having grown accustomed to straightforward dealings abroad, Luo Bingtian found this more ritualistic approach to business a bit strange. This was the hospitality culture in Huaguo, where the finest things were offered to guests, and etiquette was highly regarded. Luo Bingtian went along with it, seeing the meeting as an opportunity to make friends rather than a mere transaction. She appreciated the leisurely and relaxed atmosphere.

After chatting casually about various topics, Mr. Zheng led them to the main house. Inside, the spacious hall was set with an Eight Immortals table, adorned with incense burners for offerings, and the walls were lined with a plethora of swords—counting them, there were easily dozens, if not a hundred. Each sword was distinct, with matching sheaths and hilts, showcasing unique patterns and shapes.

Luo Bingtian stated plainly that she wasn’t knowledgeable about swords, but her elder relatives enjoyed them. She was hoping for recommendations as gifts. Mr. Zheng chuckled, suggesting that gifts and personal collections were often the best combination. He proceeded to recommend swords based on their renown, but to Luo Bingtian, they all seemed somewhat similar. The Dragon Spring swords had a standardized design and a clear lineage, making them suitable but perhaps overly glorified for simply slicing through zombies.

Perhaps out of her own inclination to collect, she thought she might never see some of these items again. She wanted to examine every sword that had been praised, and Anmin dutifully followed along, assisting in retrieving swords and pushing the cart, his expression one of mild exasperation. It wasn’t like they were picking out clothes or shoes; there was no way she would end up buying just one sword and leave him to clean and store the rest.

Feeling the weight of the task ahead, he looked somewhat defeated. Luo Bingtian glanced around the walls but didn’t find anything particularly appealing. She then expressed a desire to try out the swords, as she had heard that Dragon Spring swords were known for their quality, flexibility, sharpness, and durability—slicing through things as easily as cutting vegetables.

Unexpectedly, Mr. Zheng shook his head. “These are all ornamental pieces and haven’t been sharpened, so you can’t test them.”

This created an awkward moment. Legally, any sword that had been sharpened was considered a regulated weapon, while unsharpened ones were classified as collectibles. Great, with prices starting in the tens of thousands and climbing to hundreds of thousands, what good was a sword that couldn’t even slice through zombies? A watermelon knife might be more practical.

Despite this, she was determined to buy a sword, so she patiently inquired about the sharpening process, using her elder relatives as an excuse for her curiosity. Thankfully, it turned out that the blades could be sharpened using a machine, and if someone was skilled, it could be done quickly.

Luo Bingtian made a mental note of the method and planned to purchase a grinding wheel when she returned, as she would eventually need to sharpen the swords herself.

After setting aside the sharpening issue, she asked Mr. Zheng for an estimate of the total price for the swords to check her balance. Feeling confident about making the payment, she generously instructed him to wrap everything up, causing Anmin's jaw to drop in disbelief.

While waiting for Anmin to calculate the bill and prepare the handwritten receipt, Luo Bingtian idly swung her feet, her eyes roaming over the Dragon Spring swords on the wall. These cold weapons weren’t just for her; she was stockpiling them, intending to see who might end up needing them later.

She had always been one to purchase what she liked without hesitation; wavering wasn’t part of her character. Feeling a bit fatigued, her gaze inadvertently flicked to the ceiling, and she suddenly sensed something was off, a chill running down her spine.
