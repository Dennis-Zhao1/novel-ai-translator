**The Assault on Kunshan Base**

The armed forces of the military district were undoubtedly formidable, especially when they mobilized en masse.

The only silver lining was that the checkpoint had been buried under heavy snow. To save time, the snow removal teams had the habit of piling snow right in the middle of the road.

While the fortification inside was mindful of maintaining traffic flow, outside, they didn't hold back. Towering ice pillars stood like sentinels in the middle of the road, creating a natural barrier.

At that moment, Luo Bingtian really wanted to applaud these uniquely-minded individuals. If they knew the outcome, they would likely scratch their heads in confusion. Mostly, it was sheer laziness that led them to this, but it oddly worked in their favor.

The guards stationed at the forefront, upon spotting a swarm of tanks and armored vehicles approaching, cleverly ducked for cover. They didn't even think of sounding the alarm until several ice pillars were blown to bits, prompting the startled guards to finally activate the sirens.

Zhu Xiaoshu was also racing toward the checkpoint, picking up the panicked Luo Bingtian, Xie Jinghang, and others along the way.

The non-combatants—children, the elderly, and women—had been trained well. In case of an enemy attack, they were to quickly seek shelter in the bomb shelters, having practiced multiple times when the weather was still mild.

Despite the chaos, everyone had the muscle memory ingrained from those drills. The folks in the lab immediately locked their computers and gathered important documents and hard drives, taking whatever reagents they could carry. Those assigned by Zhu Xiaoshu helped usher them into the bomb shelter.

The bomb shelter was already stocked with food and water, and there were plenty of blankets to keep warm.

When Aunt Li entered, she lamented the pot of dumplings that was about to be finished. Luckily, she had moved the pot aside before leaving. If they wrapped things up quickly, the dumplings might still be edible.

Though the weapons at the checkpoint had been prepared, they were all stowed away due to the continuous heavy snowfall. The keys to the armory were with Zhu Xiaoshu, and by the time they raced to the weapons depot, Kunshan Base had already launched a fierce assault, bullets and shells raining down like they were free.

Luo Bingtian's heart ached as she watched the entrance of the base, now pockmarked and littered with debris. She had invested a significant amount of money into this place!

The best weapon in the armory was a heavy machine gun, which left Luo Bingtian feeling even more ridiculous. After hoarding so many impressive weapons in Saudi Arabia for Zhu's family, why weren't they being utilized?

Zhu Xiaoshu felt a bit embarrassed too. How could he have anticipated that the military district would take an interest in them? They came knocking without any prior notice.

Luo Bingtian immediately ordered Zhu Xiaoshu and Xie Jinghang to drive to the warehouse and retrieve rocket launchers or anything useful. With the enemy already at their doorstep, there was no need for pleasantries!

Zhu Xiaoshu waved his hand dismissively, saying it wasn't necessary to go through all that trouble. He still had people carry weapons from the armory, and Xie Jinghang's team was among them.

Luo Bingtian was puzzled by Zhu Xiaoshu's intentions. Determined, she decided she could handle it herself. The rocket launchers in her space were already primed for action.

The young men with combat experience grabbed their weapons and started moving out, but Zhu Xiaoshu pulled her back.

“It’s too dangerous up front; what would a girl like you be doing there? Don’t panic, look at this.”

Zhu Xiaoshu mysteriously pulled out a black briefcase from the armory's cabinet. Just as Xie Jinghang was about to step out, he suddenly paused, turning back with a glimmer in his eyes, intrigued.

Luo Bingtian didn’t pay much attention to Xie Jinghang’s reaction. She saw Zhu Xiaoshu deftly unlock the briefcase's combination lock. He opened it to reveal one side with a screen and the other filled with buttons and joysticks, resembling a beefed-up computer mixed with a game console.

Zhu Xiaoshu pulled out a few antennas from the top of the case and fiddled with it for a bit. After pressing a few buttons, the indicator light on the briefcase lit up brightly, albeit in a rather garish color.

At this point, Xie Jinghang had moved closer to Zhu Xiaoshu, his eyes glued to the "computer" on the table, unable to suppress his admiration.

“Zhu Wuye, you’re incredible! You managed to get your hands on this!”

Luo Bingtian was clueless about their cryptic exchange, watching as Zhu Xiaoshu swaggered out with the open briefcase. She and Xie Jinghang hurried after him, and along the way, Luo Bingtian kept asking, “What is this thing?”

Of course, no one responded. The group quickly reached the shelter, where they observed the fierce exchange of fire, light machine guns and heavy machine guns already set up and firing like there was no tomorrow.

The enemy occasionally tossed bombs their way, blasting holes in the previously fortified outer walls of the military base.

The checkpoint’s guard post had long since been obliterated, and now, Luo Bingtian felt a pang of loss. Materials were scarce in this apocalyptic world; they hadn’t stocked much cement, so rebuilding would mean using what little they had.

Zhu Xiaoshu hastily started operating the briefcase, while an odd and surreal feeling hung over Luo Bingtian.

In an instant, she noticed changes occurring on the high walls to either side, reminiscent of a sci-fi movie, as numerous gun barrels and cannons extended from the towering stone walls.

Their position was actually on the equivalent of the fourth floor of a typical building; the guard post was on the fourth floor, while the checkpoint was on the first.

In a crisis, the guards could retreat through a tunnel, sealing it off behind them. The surrounding walls stood nearly twenty meters high, requiring an aircraft to breach them.

To enter, they would have to blow through the walls directly.

Meanwhile, the enemy was essentially on the first floor, firing upwards. Since standard firearms had limited effectiveness, they had to rely on artillery to bombard them.

As Luo Bingtian surveyed the surroundings, she couldn't help but gasp at the sight of so many gun barrels. She had never seen anything like it.

Seeing her astonishment, Zhu Xiaoshu finally revealed, “This is a thermal weapons system developed by the United States. This is the control module—I specifically had someone come to install it for me. Surprised? The only downside is that I had a short time to learn how to use it, and I didn’t get a manual. I almost forgot how to operate it until just now!”

Luo Bingtian was speechless. Zhu Xiaoshu was truly impressive, managing to keep this from her.

No wonder he had bought so many advanced thermal weapons back then; she hadn’t seen any of them since.

While it was indeed a surprise, there was a greater sense of dread.

Seeing the fortification’s firepower suddenly diminish, a loudspeaker blared from the enemy’s formation.

“Kunshan Base hereby requisitions the Zhu Family Biomedical Research Team. All team members are to report immediately...”

Upon hearing this voice, Xie Jinghang tightened his grip on his weapon. He recognized it was Wang Dali, the most obnoxious and inept lackey of Base Chief Li.

He had long suspected that Wang Dali was up to no good, and now, with this turn of events, he wondered what kind of trick they were trying to pull.

Before the enemy could finish their announcement, Zhu Xiaoshu hesitated as he manipulated the joystick, then pressed a button and muttered, “This should be it. Hope I’m not mistaken.”

After pressing it, he leaned out to take a look, just in time to see a rocket launcher fire from the wall, landing squarely in the enemy’s convoy.

In an instant, several armored vehicles were sent flying into the air, crashing back down and rolling several times, accompanied by a deafening explosion and blinding flames. Luo Bingtian witnessed the devastating power of thermal weapons on the battlefield for the first time.

The enemy's formation was immediately thrown into disarray. Some vehicles tried to retreat but ended up colliding with those behind them, creating chaos.

The infantry who had been lying in wait against the walls were equally stunned.

With this level of firepower, there was no way they could take the fortification today, even if they fought to the death.

Zhu Xiaoshu then received a loudspeaker (a handheld megaphone), saying, “Power on, music...”

The speaker blared the kind of electronic music commonly played at street stalls.

Everyone went silent, exchanging glances of disbelief.

Zhu Xiaoshu seemed entirely unfazed as he fiddled with the controls. Finally, the music stopped, and he raised the megaphone to shout, “What did you just say? I didn’t hear you; repeat that!”

After a moment of silence, the enemy's convoy repeated, “Kunshan Base hereby requisitions the Zhu Family Biomedical Research Team...”

This time, Zhu Xiaoshu didn’t even give them half a chance to finish. He manipulated the joystick again and decisively pressed another button.

A volley of rockets launched, and amidst the series of explosions, the vehicle that had been broadcasting the message was sent skyward.

Xie Jinghang, Luo Bingtian, Meng Ge, and the others on the front lines wore expressions of collective shock, all left speechless.

Seeing the enemy faltering, Zhu Xiaoshu quickly urged, “What are you all dawdling for? Get shooting!”

Instantly, all firepower was unleashed. Xie Jinghang silently mourned for the enemy; of all people to provoke, they chose the apocalyptic fortress!

What followed was a scene of utter chaos, with the enemy being utterly overwhelmed, desperately retreating, shedding armor and weapons as they fled.

The infantry that hadn’t made it back to their vehicles scrambled on foot, slipping and falling in the icy weather as they hurried to escape.

A group of people stood in the cold wind, watching the military district troops retreat in disarray, their faces covered in dirt and shame.

Zhu Xiaoshu ignored the inexperienced fools around him. He manipulated the briefcase again, and the gun barrels and cannons retracted back into the stone walls, restoring the fortification to its former appearance.

He assigned people to the lower levels to clean up the battlefield, dragging away the dead and detaining any surviving captives.

After closing the briefcase with a few clicks, he urged his nephews and nieces to hurry up and get to work while he carried the briefcase, driving towards the bomb shelter with Luo Bingtian and Xie Jinghang in tow.
