**Owing Me Three Times**

Fu Dingjin's sudden retreat caught Xie Jinghang completely off guard. He hadn't seen Fu get shot and quickly realized that the unexpected withdrawal might be related to Luo Bingtin. He lifted his gaze towards the rooftop where she was positioned.

At that moment, she had already holstered her weapon and turned away. Xie could only catch a fleeting glimpse of the familiar dark muzzle of her gun as it swayed past.

Xie Jinghang sprang to his feet and dashed toward his teammates. The lightly injured ones had already begun to recover, and although the severely injured teammate was still unconscious, at least the bleeding had stopped, and his complexion was not as pale as before.

"Move it, move it! The zombies are coming!" Luo Bingtin called out as she jogged toward him, carrying her AK47.

From a distance, Xie could see a horde of zombies blocking one side of the street, drawn in by the chaos. Meng Ge was already searching for a usable vehicle nearby.

Luo Bingtin handed her weapon back to the injured teammate and joined Meng Ge in the vehicle hunt. The commercial street was littered with abandoned cars, but only a few were in drivable condition. When Meng Ge spotted a decent-looking car, he smashed the window and yanked open the door, only to find the fuel gauge on empty, which made him slam his fist against the steering wheel in frustration.

Before long, Luo Bingtin drove up in a pickup truck that she had retrieved from her space when no one was paying attention. She was grateful for her quick thinking; back in Hangzhou, she had not only collected the Zheng family's truck but also picked up a couple of pickup trucks and vans parked next to the warehouse.

Getting the severely injured teammate into the back of the pickup took quite some time, and Luo Bingtin could sense the approaching zombie army even without using her mental powers.

Meng Ge quickly started the engine, exhaust fumes puffing out, and Luo Bingtin gave Xie Jinghang a shove to hurry him into the vehicle. She swiftly replaced the empty magazine in her handgun and prepared for battle.

Once everyone was inside, the leading zombies had already reached the pickup’s bed. Luo Bingtin swung her sword with her left hand, slicing off an arm, while firing her gun with her right, taking out the zombies’ heads.

The lightly injured teammates also raised their weapons to shoot back.

Suddenly, Xie Jinghang turned and found a zombie gripping his arm, nearly pulling him off the truck. He was protecting his teammate with one arm while gripping the hilt of his Tang sword with the other, clearly intending to swing it but not having the chance to do so.

Seeing his plight, Luo Bingtin's heart skipped a beat, and she reacted quickly, delivering a headshot to each of the zombies that were threatening him. She yanked Xie Jinghang back just as he was about to lose his balance and be pulled out.

In that moment, Xie Jinghang's heart raced. The fierce expression of the girl with the cold face filled his vision, and he suddenly found her surprisingly cute.

Luo Bingtin noticed him staring blankly and shot him a frown. "Are you stunned? Get your act together, man! Why are you so slow to react?"

Alright then, cute was off the table.

Xie Jinghang felt utterly humiliated after being scolded in front of his teammates, his pride taking a hit. Channeling his frustration into action, he finally unleashed his Tang sword, quickly dispatching the zombies clinging to the vehicle, allowing them to pick up speed.

Luo Bingtin put away her gun and took out a cloth from her backpack to carefully clean her prized sword.

Xie Jinghang had been reluctant to speak, but realizing they were all in the same boat now, he decided to break the silence. "That sword looks impressive. Is it from Longquan?"

Luo Bingtin continued wiping her sword, initially wanting to retort but changing her mind as her eyes flickered. "Yeah, yours isn't too shabby either."

"Thanks, it's a family heirloom. How about yours?"

"Uh, it’s someone else's heirloom."

"......"

The expressions of their teammates mirrored Xie Jinghang's, all wearing looks of disbelief. Seriously? Two sentences and they killed the conversation? How were they supposed to continue from that?

Noticing their perplexed faces, Luo Bingtin finished cleaning her sword and sheathed it. She leaned against the truck's railing and smiled sweetly at Xie Jinghang. "Captain Xie, I just saved your life again."

Xie Jinghang raised an eyebrow, and Luo Bingtin rested her chin on her hand, continuing, "So that makes it three times you owe me now."

Xie Jinghang didn't respond, and Luo Bingtin quickly picked up on his reluctance. "Hey, big man, you can't just ignore what you owe me!"

The few remaining conscious teammates were thoroughly entertained. They had never seen their captain so thoroughly outmatched by a girl before. Typically, in the military, they had little interaction with women, and with their captain's stunning looks, no girl dared to give him attitude—except for this one.

Did she have face blindness? Or was her vision just so poor that she couldn't recognize their captain's face? 

The vice-captain's inner thoughts were nearly spilling over. The last time these two met, they had been at odds. Perhaps they were simply natural-born enemies.

Xie Jinghang's pride was utterly crushed. He shot a glare at the teammates who were laughing at his expense and then glanced at the girl beside him, who was eagerly waiting for him to say something.

He sighed, realizing how transparent her schemes were. Rubbing his nose, he finally replied, "Depends on what you want. If it’s beyond my capability, I can't promise anything."

Luo Bingtin looked at him, unimpressed. "Don’t worry, it'll definitely be within your ability."

She quickly began to strategize how to use these three favors.

After speeding to a safe area, Meng Ge parked in a desolate patch of land, then rolled down the window to call out to Luo Bingtin, "Miss, what’s the plan now?"

Luo Bingtin understood his implication and glanced at Xie Jinghang, tilting her chin slightly.

Xie Jinghang caught on to her intention as well. He pondered for a moment and then looked at their unconscious teammate. "I wonder if the Bastion of the Apocalypse is still accepting new people?"

Luo Bingtin clapped her hands together. "They usually don't accept anyone, but since you asked, they definitely will. So that makes it three times you owe me now."

Xie Jinghang felt helpless; it seemed he had boarded a pirate ship.

Luo Bingtin continued, "The Bastion of the Apocalypse isn't open to the public. They've never taken in any stragglers or teams. Only I can bring you in, and once you're inside, you’ll need to follow my orders. Can you accept that?"

Xie Jinghang regarded her serious expression, realizing this was the woman’s capability to change her demeanor. "So we’ll be joining as mercenaries?"

"You could say that. You’ll live in the Bastion and complete the tasks I assign."

Xie Jinghang glanced back at his comrades, realizing they couldn’t return to the Kunshan base for now. He could sense that Fu Buqi was playing a significant game, all aimed at trapping him. While he could defend against immediate threats, he couldn't guard against everything indefinitely. Instead of remaining a target at Kunshan, it was better to take a step back and wait for a chance.

He nodded in agreement, and just like that, their cooperation was established.

Luo Bingtin had her doubts but felt today’s events were too coincidental to be a setup. She leaned toward believing that the conflict between Xie Jinghang and Fu Buqi was genuine, which meant she had gained a formidable ally, significantly increasing her chances against that pair of scoundrels.

But what if it was all an act? Luo Bingtin had never underestimated Fu Buqi's cunning and ability to manipulate people. If it was staged for her benefit, keeping him close would make it easier to find flaws in his performance and deal with the situation more effectively.

So, getting into the Bastion was a certainty; as for whether they were allies, that would unfold with time.

With a bright smile, Luo Bingtin extended her hand to Xie Jinghang. "Welcome to my team!"
