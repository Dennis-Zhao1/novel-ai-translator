**Announcement of the Drug**

After leaving the laboratory, I found a secluded spot to release the armored vehicle. At that moment, everyone in the fortress was ordered to stop their work and undergo inspection, primarily to determine if anyone had been bitten or scratched by zombies. With the entire fortress on high alert, no one was wandering around, ensuring that I wouldn’t be seen.

To my surprise, in the trunk, Wu Xiaogang was thrashing around wildly. I held a sedative in one hand and yanked the trunk open with the other, only to find that Wu Xiaogang had managed to remove his eye mask, though he was still tightly bound.

The moment the trunk popped open, Wu Xiaogang’s pupils constricted as if he were startled by sudden brightness. He opened his mouth, trying to say something, but I was in no mood to engage in a lengthy discussion. I quickly pressed down on him.

With a swift injection, he fell back into unconsciousness. By studying his abilities in the lab, we might uncover the hidden secrets of Fu Buqi. I retracted the vehicle back into the spatial storage and grabbed Wu Xiaogang by the collar, dragging him back to the lab. Little Lu helped me secure him to the research bed. I explained to them the uniqueness of this ability user. As the only other ability user assisting Dr. Zhang, Little Lu nodded repeatedly, understanding the gravity of the situation. This was our first time experimenting on a living ability user, and we had to ensure he stayed alive while quickly drawing conclusions—an arduous mission.

After giving my instructions, I felt the need to check in periodically. Wu Xiaogang had a strong resistance to the sedative, and I was uncertain how long it would last. I left a few extra doses for Dr. Zhang and the others before heading to the infirmary to assess the condition of the injured.

At this point, Liu Xiaohui had brought the patrol team to check everyone. The guard team had taken over the watch duties, standing vigil on the city walls. Anmin and Brother Meng were unable to wrap things up quickly, and the entire fortress was filled with anxiety; they needed me to calm their nerves.

Seeing Liu Xiaohui relax upon my safe return was a relief. She reported that there were seven ability users who had been bitten, three members of the guard team, and two civilians—so far, none had resulted in fatalities. The injuries were more severe among those guarding the power and water plant, but thankfully, we had at least two antidotes available for everyone, as the zombies seemed to aim for opening the gates rather than inflicting mortal wounds.

As Liu Xiaohui and I reached the infirmary, I noticed that what had previously been an idle office had been transformed into a makeshift hospital after several renovations. Although it was small, only one floor, it was starting to resemble an actual medical facility, with doctors and nurses being ordinary people who had gradually come to the fortress.

Sitting beside Zhur Yi Dan's bed was her brother, Zhur Erge. I walked over and quietly inquired about my friend’s condition. I intentionally brushed aside the earlier scene at the gate; my expression was calm, yet inside, I was anything but.

“Yi Dan is fine. She just overexerted her abilities and is exhausted. The doctor has already seen her, so don’t worry,” Zhur Erge reassured me.

I nodded. As long as she was okay, a timely treatment and replenishment of energy crystals would help her recover with some rest.

Liu Xiaohui had learned about the earlier incident at the fortress gate from others. Having served as my assistant for a while, she had a decent grasp of my personality. Noticing my expression, she couldn't tell whether I was angry. Even though she found the whole situation absurd, it was clear that Yi Dan hadn’t done anything inappropriate. After all, she had only been carried by Xie Jinghang into the infirmary.

However, the thought of "carried like a princess!" made Liu Xiaohui mentally scream. If I were already feeling inadequate, how much more so for me?

Ultimately, she concluded that I must not have feelings for Xie Jinghang, considering my unresponsive demeanor. If Brother Meng dared to carry any woman, besides me, in such a manner, I would explode without a moment's hesitation.

With my inner musings settled, Liu Xiaohui shifted her focus back to business. The condition of the isolated patients was quite serious, and Zhur Erge accompanied me during the rounds. Some patients had begun to develop high fevers and were speaking incoherently. Thankfully, the antidote had been administered in time, and their wounds had been cleaned and bandaged.

Currently, their high fevers were a sign of their bodies fighting the virus. The nurses were diligently monitoring them, and even researchers from the lab had come to record their conditions at various stages, hoping for an early recovery.

After checking on everyone, I noted that the condition of the ability users was significantly better than that of the guard team and civilians. Without abilities, the guards and ordinary people lacked the enhanced physical resilience, making them much more vulnerable to the zombie virus. I worried they might not hold up, my brows knitted in concern as I prayed that our improved antidote would prove effective.

Once everything was arranged and wounds were checked, I was relieved to see that no additional bite injuries had been discovered. Looking at the frightened faces of the still-terrified people, I decided it was time to announce and implement the ability awakening plan. Zombies were constantly evolving; humanity couldn’t afford to sit back and wait any longer. The risks I had previously considered would need to be set aside; when it was time to take risks, hesitation was not an option.

After this incident, the desire among ordinary people to awaken their abilities would undoubtedly grow stronger, making future mobilizations easier.

By the time everything settled, it was nearly evening. Brother Meng and Anmin returned from disposing of the zombie corpses, and I could see the incinerator at the gate had resumed its work, converting everything into energy reserves.

Anmin, holding a large bag of energy crystals, joyfully shouted for us to hurry up and divide the loot.

Hearing this, Brother Meng playfully smacked the back of his head and scolded him for talking nonsense. I couldn’t help but laugh and called everyone to gather in the cafeteria for dinner. I turned to Liu Xiaohui and Uncle Zhu to discuss the awakening plan and reward mechanisms.

This was both a reassurance and an incentive. I had decided to expedite the ability awakening plan, seizing the moment.

Uncle Zhu was already aware of the laboratory’s research direction and was surprised that success had come so quickly. He couldn’t help but feel astonished by my vision and initiative.

Looking back over the past two years since the apocalypse, we had managed to preserve our lives and live relatively peacefully within the fortress, with many of our accomplishments being guided by my leadership. 

Now, our antidote and ability awakening drug were unique, placing our biological research capabilities far above other bases; it wasn’t merely a matter of being a descendant of a mysterious lineage.

As these thoughts crossed his mind, Uncle Zhu’s gaze fell. He recalled his niece and Captain Xie’s earlier interactions, and the way Captain Xie and I interacted. His brow twitched, sensing that something wasn’t quite right.

Even though he had a youthful mindset and wasn’t much older than us, he still felt the weight of being an elder. He worried about what would happen if the three of us ever found ourselves tangled in a conflict.

Before dinner, I looked out at all the members of the fortress gathered below. Except for the ability users on watch and the nurses on duty in the infirmary, even the lab personnel were present.

I briefly outlined the current situation with the zombies outside and explained the cause of the internal zombie appearance earlier that day. In front of everyone, I distributed the energy crystals and awarded generous bonuses to those who had been injured and were still isolated, expressing my gratitude for their bravery.

My gaze landed on Xie Jinghang and Zhur Yi Dan standing side by side, and I felt my eyelids twitch involuntarily. My expression darkened as I quickly averted my gaze, pretending not to notice.

I then invited Dr. Zhang to the stage to share his research findings. The ability awakening plan was no secret among the fortress’s higher-ups. As researcher Little Lu stepped up to demonstrate his abilities and present a series of clinical data, the ordinary people in the audience ignited with excitement at the thought of awakening their powers through the drug.

Their eyes sparkled with hope, and some emotional individuals even covered their mouths and cried. The members of the guard team were so eager they looked ready to rush the stage and beg Dr. Zhang for their own injections.

They fully understood how difficult life had become for ordinary people since the emergence of ability users. When everyone was on equal footing, survival wasn’t as harsh, but with the arrival of ability users, an invisible hierarchy had developed—ordinary people were relegated to the bottom, subjected to neglect and exploitation.

As Dr. Zhang announced the opening for voluntary registration in the ability awakening plan, a clear voice suddenly cut through the air. 

“I oppose it!”
