### Learning the Art of Qi Observation

Luo Bingting didn’t even realize how she had fallen asleep. When she woke up, she found that she could comprehend the sundial's readings. It was a strange sensation of enlightenment. The external time was around two in the morning, and the flow of time in this spatial realm was at a ratio of 100:1. This meant that while she spent 100 days in this space, only one day had passed outside.

Practicing magic techniques was incredibly time-consuming, but the Jade Dragon Secret Realm was like a gigantic cheat code, allowing Luo Bingting to lavish time without wasting it intentionally. She seized the opportunity to practice Qi Observation.

However, it wasn’t as straightforward as she had hoped. Qi Observation required intense concentration and a powerful mental force to perceive the elusive “Qi” emanating from an object or a person. 

Jewels and gemstones primarily radiated a treasure light; the higher the quality, the brighter and more dazzling the light. Inferior quality gems, on the other hand, appeared dull and gray, or sometimes lacked any glow at all.

With a determined focus, Luo Bingting immersed herself in mastering Qi Observation. The surging spiritual energy in the space washed over her, and when she opened her eyes again, she noticed not only an enhancement in her mental force but also minor achievements in her Qi Observation skills.

Stepping out of the spatial realm, she opened a jewelry chest piled in the corner. By concentrating her attention, she could easily distinguish the varying brilliance of the gems. Drawing on her expertise as an appraiser, she confirmed that the most radiant treasures were indeed top-quality jade and gemstones.

Moreover, she discovered she could lift an entire bookshelf with her mental force, although for now, she still needed to physically touch and collect each item. 

"If only I could expand my mental force to cover a broader area, I could retrieve items from afar," Luo Bingting mused to herself. 

Deciding to train even harder, she thought, "What if I could achieve that?"

After collecting everything in the secret room, she also gathered her grandfather's notes and a few other items, leaving the bulk of them untouched, as those would need to be transported openly.

Returning to her bedroom, Luo Bingting continued her rigorous practice. Her meridians flowed smoothly and were becoming increasingly wide and resilient.

The next morning, after finishing her routine, she prepared for an important day ahead—resource exchange was urgent. With a resolute mindset, she headed to the company.

Her phone had gone unchecked since last night, and when she picked it up in the morning, she saw messages from the second-generation elites checking for news, even at four in the morning.

Luo Bingting didn’t rush to reply. Once at the company, she instructed her assistant to form a legal team. With so many assets needing exchange, the procedures would be complex.

She didn’t want anyone exploiting legal loopholes to take advantage of her, nor would she allow that to happen.

Her assistant, unsure of her thoughts, complied without hesitation. Soon, they gathered the heads of the legal and business departments for a brief meeting.

Luo Bingting merely assigned tasks, letting her assistant oversee everything. Around ten o'clock that morning, the exchange group began buzzing with activity from the second-generation elites. Still, Luo Bingting remained silent for a while before finally chiming in.

Her attitude today differed from yesterday, creating uncertainty among the second-generation elites. With the group filled with competitors and their elders eagerly anticipating acquiring Luo Bingting's assets, the second-generation started brainstorming ways to attract her attention.

They began sending out red envelopes and awkwardly chatting until someone showcased their family’s flashy pink helicopter. That piqued Luo Bingting's interest, prompting her to join the conversation.

The second-generation elites quickly sensed the right approach, sharing pictures of their family’s planes and yachts. Luo Bingting subtly guided the discussion, and they began openly bidding in the group chat.

Of course, she wasn't about to hastily trade away her resources, as that could raise suspicions. Luo Bingting seemed to embody the strategy of "fishing with a long line for big fish."

She observed the group chat and privately messaged several individuals to ask for their thoughts. Some hesitated, admitting they weren’t aware of what assets she had. Luo Bingting paused to consider, then shared a list of her assets, their values, and details of the past two years' dividends in the group.

This move stunned everyone—"Is she really that reckless?" they wondered. 

Luo Bingting's boldness left a lasting impression, reestablishing her as the "little princess" who was unafraid to take risks.

The second-generation quickly informed their families, arranging for professionals to assess the value and potential of these assets.

When they learned that Luo Bingting was only interested in a yacht and a helicopter, they couldn't help but ridicule her lack of business sense, viewing her as a spoiled rich kid squandering money without a plan.

This only reaffirmed that she wasn’t scheming; she was genuinely a generous fairy scattering wealth.

Luo Bingting quickly finalized the exchange of her assets with two families. She traded for a helicopter with a relatively new e-commerce company that had only recently begun to show growth, a perk from a previous acquisition.

Another small company, also a bonus from an acquisition, exchanged for a yacht. When it came to such ostentatious items, the second-generation elites were more than willing to spend.

The new versions surely exceeded the market value of these small companies, while the second-hand ones were practically worthless, allowing both parties to feel like they had made a good deal.

Especially the other side, who feared being outmaneuvered or that Luo Bingting might suddenly come to her senses.

After thanking the second-generation for successfully exchanging the helicopter and yacht in the group chat, the rest of the participants were shocked. “That was so fast?” they thought. While they were still discussing with their families, these two had already struck a deal!

Thus, the others rushed to confirm the authenticity and value of the assets with their families, eager to catch up and see what else Luo Bingting might need for exchange.

Some even went so far as to directly offer to purchase the assets they were interested in. Luo Bingting neither accepted nor declined, merely stating, "We agreed on an exchange, and others are still preparing their assets."

Those looking to buy with cash prepared alternative offers. Luo Bingting had her own plans; cash transactions were entirely feasible. There were items among this group that she couldn’t easily acquire with money, yet they could obtain them without difficulty.

This included families with military or political backgrounds. Luo Bingting understood exactly what she wanted next: military supplies and equipment!

In Huaguo, anything related to military supplies required complete qualification and procedures. Luo Bingting had the financial capability to manage this, but time was of the essence. Each report took time to process, so it would be more efficient to directly exchange with a qualified company that could facilitate her operations.

Indeed, the second-generation elites bombarded the group with offers of villas, private islands, yachts, airplanes, and bars, none of which caught Luo Bingting's interest. One even boasted about purchasing "stars," leaving her a bit speechless.

It wasn’t until one of the second-generation members shared a picture of a very cool armored vehicle that her eyes lit up—this was it!

The vehicle was a military-grade armored car used by Huaguo's armed forces. Unlike tanks, it wasn’t equipped with weapons, but it was sturdy, bulletproof, fireproof, and collision-resistant—far superior to regular SUVs or modified vehicles.

Luo Bingting replied to the image with a simple “Cool.”

Instantly, the second-generation elites were energized. As long as they could catch Luo Bingting’s attention, it didn’t matter how they did it. It was perfectly normal for a young girl to want to own cool and impressive things; no one questioned her motives—after all, with her status, why would she need to do anything at all?

What followed was a deluge of images showcasing various flashy modified vehicles, armored cars, and warships. These individuals not only had channels and qualifications within Huaguo but also resources abroad. With money, they feared nothing when it came to purchasing.

Luo Bingting wasn’t lacking resources; she just found it inconvenient to handle things directly.

With these people drawing attention, she could remain in the shadows and collect supplies, making it both safe and efficient—essentially a free special procurement channel. The thought was delightful.

Of course, she wouldn’t overtly express her urgent need; instead, she feigned mild interest, which prompted the second-generation elites to begin various tactics to entice her, trying to persuade her through brainwashing.

Their anxiousness was palpable.
