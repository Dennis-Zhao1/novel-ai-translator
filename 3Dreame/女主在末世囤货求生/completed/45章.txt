**Setting Off for Rescue**

Luo Bingtin was in charge of leading a team in an armored vehicle, clearing the way ahead. Onboard were An Min and two of the Zhu family’s younger relatives. The driver was the seventh son of the Zhu family, while Luo Bingtin occupied the passenger seat, with An Min and the fifth Zhu sibling sitting in the back. Meng Ge drove a tour bus trailing behind, carrying the third, fourth, and eighth members of the Zhu family.

After exiting the doomsday fortress, they had to pass through a highway entrance since the other routes were too treacherous. The armored vehicle could barely manage to get through, but the tour bus was too wide and cumbersome to navigate the narrower paths.

Fortunately, the right side of the highway entrance had been completely blocked off, but there was still one passage left open on the left, allowing the bus to squeeze through just barely.

Once they reached the highway, the sight heading towards Beijing was even more terrifying. Cars were scattered haphazardly across the road, remnants of numerous accidents, abandoned vehicles, and even human remains were visible.

An Min and the Zhu brothers had only seen such scenes in videos online; this was their first time witnessing it all with their own eyes. The Zhu family's young driver, Zhu Xiaoqi, appeared particularly shaken, his face pale and his fingers trembling on the steering wheel.

Luo Bingtin chuckled softly to comfort him. “Don’t be afraid. Aren’t you the one who loves zombie movies the most? Just think of it as being on a film set. If it gets too overwhelming, just face it. The more you see, the easier it will get.”

“Luo Jie, don’t joke around,” Zhu Xiaoqi replied with a dry laugh. He wished he could look away. Just a quick glance had nearly made him vomit. If he weren't driving, he would have pulled over to let it all out.

In the backseat, An Min and Zhu Laosan wore grim expressions. They didn’t have to drive, so they could see the horror more clearly. The sight of their own kind meeting such a gruesome end easily sparked their deepest fears.

An Min’s voice trembled slightly as he asked, “Miss Luo, aren’t you scared?”

Luo Bingtin was indeed afraid, but she had witnessed mountains of corpses in her previous life. She had seen the bloodied, mangled bodies of those bitten by zombies, which had haunted her for months afterward. It took her years to recover from the trauma of the apocalypse.

That was why she had been so petrified when she encountered a zombie in the hospital last time; it had unearthed her deepest fears, leaving her feeling powerless.

“I am scared, of course. But fear won’t keep me alive. We’re going to save people. So pull yourselves together; your brothers and sisters are waiting for us,” Luo Bingtin encouraged, suppressing her own weakness. Her words were meant not just for her companions but also for herself.

Right, her friends were counting on her to rescue them. Zhu Yidan would probably cry her eyes out when she saw Luo Bingtin charging in to save her.

Just thinking about how her friend would look, crying uncontrollably, brought a smile to her face.

Perhaps it was Luo Bingtin’s relaxed attitude and her smile that lifted their spirits. The environment, though dire, didn’t seem as frightening anymore. If a delicate young lady could remain composed, what was there to fear?

The highway was littered with abandoned vehicles, and it was crucial to stay alert while driving, avoiding any wreckage or debris that could puncture their tires. Meng Ge remained vigilant, following closely behind the armored vehicle. They could plow through larger obstacles, but they had to be careful not to crush smaller debris with the tires.

This mission didn't require them to enter the city; they were to take the highway, circling around Beijing from the northwest to the southeast, where the biological research base was located, not far from Aerospace City.

The northwest of Beijing was mountainous while the southeast was a vast plain. After more than two hours of driving, they finally spotted a sign for Aerospace City. It was quite a detour around the outer ring—if they had gone through the city, they could have cut their travel time in half.

However, the city’s traffic must have been completely paralyzed at this point; every road was likely blocked. Luo Bingtin had no intention of getting caught up in that chaos—the highway was enough of a challenge.

Thankfully, the stretch of road leading to Aerospace City was wide and clear of any vehicle traces. Luo Bingtin used a paper map to locate the building where the Zhu family’s uncle was based.

The area was a newly established tech park, with Aerospace City further in. Most buildings in the park were around ten stories tall, with a few shorter ones at six or seven stories.

The building belonging to Zhu’s uncle was the tallest and most centrally located in the tech park, boasting a full thirty stories—an unmistakable target.

As they approached the park’s gate, the automatic doors were out of power and wouldn’t open. Zhu’s uncle explained that the park was still under construction, surrounded by walls. The only way for vehicles to enter was through the main gate.

Luo Bingtin thought for a moment, then parked the vehicle in an open space near the gate. Meng Ge followed suit. There were no zombies at the entrance; it was eerily quiet. Looking inside, she couldn’t see any zombies roaming around. Luo Bingtin even suspected that the park might be completely empty.

That was highly unlikely, though. The more probable scenario was that the zombies had taken refuge in the various office buildings.

It was certain that there were still survivors, likely holed up in their offices or safe areas, with zombies lurking nearby.

With this in mind, Luo Bingtin instructed An Min to fetch some supplies from the trunk while she communicated with Meng Ge on the walkie-talkie, telling him to stay in the vehicle and wait for further instructions.

An Min retrieved a black box marked with the logo of the largest drone brand in Huaguo. He quickly realized Luo Bingtin’s intentions and handed it to her. She opened the box and powered it on. This drone did not rely on network signals but transmitted images through this brand’s GPS signal.

After connecting her phone and setting it up, the drone’s live feed appeared on her screen. An Min and Zhu Laosan were excited; they too wanted to see what was happening outside.

Luo Bingtin deftly operated the drone, and with a buzzing sound, it flew out through the car’s sunroof, heading straight for the tallest building. She carefully controlled the drone’s altitude, not daring to fly too low for fear of attracting the zombies’ attention.

This drone was one she had purchased out of curiosity during her travels in the country and had used a few times to capture videos of her sword-flying adventures. Her skills had improved since then.

The building was a bit far from the gate, about a kilometer away. Luo Bingtin felt like it took forever for the drone to reach it. Zhu Laosan mentioned that the biological lab was on the seventeenth floor, so she specifically had the drone film the main entrance. It was completely deserted, the door wide open, and although the luxurious entrance looked inviting, there was something sinister about it.

Without wasting any more time, the drone hovered vertically from the first floor upwards, while she had An Min and the others count the floors.

“Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen floors, Luo Jie,” they called out.

Luo Bingtin’s fingers were starting to ache from pressing the buttons as she maneuvered the drone to circle the seventeenth floor.

“Why can’t we see anything? The windows on the seventeenth floor are all covered,” Zhu Xiaoqi complained, anxiously.

Luo Bingtin had no choice but to circle slowly around. Just as she was about to give up, An Min suddenly shouted, “Miss Luo, look! Over there! There’s something!” He pointed excitedly at the phone screen.

Luo Bingtin’s fingers didn’t stop moving as she adjusted the view, quickly bringing the camera back to the area he pointed out. What appeared on the screen made everyone gasp in shock.
