**Unknown Cave**

Luo Binging followed closely behind, using her mental power to scan the surroundings, but she found nothing unusual.

The others gradually entered behind her, and Xie Jinghang was already using a flashlight to illuminate the narrow passage of the cave.

"This cave is naturally formed, not man-made. But everyone, watch your step; don’t trip," Xie Jinghang said, looking back at the group.

Luo Binging also took out flashlights to distribute among the others. They had stocked up quite a few of these before, but this time, they didn’t bring too many—one flashlight for every two or three people was sufficient.

They walked nearly two hundred meters in, and the cave twisted and turned, making it hard to discern their current location. The compass on Luo Binging's watch kept spinning erratically, likely due to magnetic interference.

In truth, Xie Jinghang had noticed the disarray of footprints at the entrance of the cave, which is why they ventured in. However, it was strange; just like when they encountered the bones earlier, the trail had suddenly stopped.

Just as they paused, Luo Binging suddenly pulled Xie Jinghang back several steps. A dark object flashed by in the shadows, and had she been a moment late, it would have struck Xie Jinghang squarely in the face.

"What was that?" someone in the team exclaimed, and the group of over twenty people instinctively took a few steps back. After a brief moment of chaos, they calmed down when they saw that Luo Binging and Xie Jinghang were not panicking.

"It's a mutated plant. Everyone, be cautious," Luo Binging announced, her mental power detecting numerous black-red dots glimmering in the lower corner, suggesting that this might be a nest for these troublesome things.

Xie Jinghang’s arm was firmly held by Luo Binging, and he didn’t dare remind her; instead, he focused on her expression. She looked serious, indicating that things were about to get complicated.

"All fire-type abilities, come to the front," Luo Binging commanded. Their team had plenty of fire and earth-type abilities but not much of anything else.

Seven or eight people moved to the front, waiting for orders.

"An Min, you and Luo Fan coordinate. Wang Xinxin, you team up with me. Xie Jinghang and the others, keep a lookout. Earth-type abilities, be on guard. Wood and water-type abilities, you can rest for now."

Luo Binging rummaged through her space and pulled out a Molotov cocktail, igniting it and tossing it toward the area with the most black-red dots. With a loud pop, the fuel splashed everywhere, and flames erupted into a large area.

The crackling sound of burning filled the cave, a noise that seemed particularly loud in the otherwise quiet space.

"So, these mutated plants make noise when they encounter fire," Luo Binging noted, her curiosity piqued.

"An Min, make the fire bigger!" she commanded.

"Got it!" An Min responded, using his wind abilities to accelerate the flames, causing the fuel to spread even further.

"Earth-type abilities, try turning the soil about fifteen yards ahead!" Luo Binging suddenly remembered that earth abilities could be used this way. The earth-type users stepped forward, and soon they uprooted the mutated plants along with their roots.

"Strange, why aren’t they attacking us? What was that thing just now?" Wang Xinxin, who had poked her head out from behind Luo Binging, asked.

"Just burn them first and we’ll figure it out later," Luo Binging replied. She scanned the area again with her mental power, but the black-red dots remained unchanged, still densely packed together. She began to ponder—could there be other mutated plants hiding?

The firelight illuminated that section of the cave, and Luo Binging added more gasoline to intensify the flames. To avoid smoke inhalation, she instructed An Min to use his wind abilities to blow the smoke back.

After about twenty minutes, the flames finally subsided, and the crackling noises disappeared. Luo Binging couldn’t afford to collect the crystal cores this time; finding her teammates was more important.

An Min led the way, and they moved through the cave with ease, almost like a walking wind machine.

After walking for another ten minutes, they reached a crevice that seemed to have formed from tectonic movement. It was over a meter wide, splitting the cave in half, and the other side was dark and increasingly narrow.

As everyone hesitated about crossing, Xie Jinghang took a few steps back before sprinting forward and easily leaping across. Wang Xinxin looked down into the seemingly bottomless crevice, fear evident in her eyes. Luo Binging decided not everyone needed to follow; she instructed Zhu Xiaoshu to take Wang Xinxin and the others back to regroup at the fortress.

With that, Wang Xinxin was sent back, and following Xie Jinghang were six of his team members, along with Luo Binging, An Min, Luo Fan, and Pei Qian, among others—about ten people in total.

As they moved forward, a faint metallic scent wafted through the air. Luo Binging, sensitive as ever, immediately alerted everyone, "Stay alert and don’t get hurt."

Xie Jinghang slowed his pace as well. He had been leading, but he sensed they were nearing something significant.

Suddenly, the flashlight beam focused on a wall, and after scanning the surroundings, it seemed they had reached a dead end.

"Why aren’t we moving? Is there no way forward?" An Min behind them asked curiously.

"Yes, there’s no way forward," Luo Binging confirmed.

"Shh, everyone be quiet," she suddenly interrupted. The smell she detected was growing heavier, and the rustling sounds around them were becoming increasingly loud.

"They’re coming. Luo Fan, be careful!" she warned.

Just then, she threw a Molotov cocktail, which struck its target. Luo Fan raised his hand, and they watched as the bottle ignited on a creature, only to freeze mid-air in an unexpected turn of events.

Luo Binging scrutinized the situation; it appeared to be a gigantic version of the mutated rambutan, and indeed, it had jumped towards them. Before she could fully assess where it had come from, she was yanked backwards into a warm embrace. The cave was suddenly illuminated by the unique silver-blue glow of lightning abilities.

Luo Binging reacted quickly, sending out several ice spikes. Luo Fan’s face turned pale as he retreated to the back, while An Min quickly grabbed a handful of crystal cores from his backpack and shoved them towards him. Luo Fan, fearing he might bump into An Min, dodged and insisted on stashing them in his own bag.

An Min was just about to make a joke about Luo Fan's social anxiety when a sudden wave of mutated rambutans surrounded them.

"This really is the nest!" someone exclaimed.

"Stop talking and get to work!" Pei Qian, with his mental abilities, found it challenging to deal with the mutated plants, while Pei Chang exerted considerable effort.

Fire-type abilities users unleashed various skills, while Luo Binging continually doused the area with gasoline. An Min was focused on conjuring winds but had to ensure the fire did not reach his teammates, which was a bit tricky.

"Luo, it’s getting tough here. We need to find a more spacious area," someone shouted.

"Yeah, I feel like I’m about to stick to the wall," another added.

"Don’t stick to the wall!" Luo Binging urgently warned, noticing that the wall was sprouting many mutated rambutans with long tendrils that could cause serious harm upon contact.

"That scared me! No way, burn it all!" 

Fire-type users positioned themselves in a circle around the area, and Luo Binging distributed several barrels of gasoline and Molotov cocktails to get everyone moving quickly.

"Stop burning! We’re running out of oxygen!" Xie Jinghang suddenly coughed a few times, and the group, previously focused on the fire, realized that the cave, which had once had airflow, now felt blocked, suffocating them.

"This is bad; at this rate, we’ll suffocate!" Luo Binging quickly checked for abnormalities, and upon closer inspection, she saw a cluster of black-red glimmering dots above them, including a particularly dark one that blended in but was still noticeable amid the glowing black-red dots.

"Xie Jinghang, Pei Chang, there should be a vertical hole above us, but it's blocked by mutated plants. We need to clear them out first," Luo Binging instructed.

After her command, she noticed An Min at the back of the group trying to break free.

The mutated rambutans feared fire, but that didn’t mean they were afraid of An Min.

"An Min, come back! The big boss is right here," she said lightly, but the grim reality of their situation was far from optimistic.
