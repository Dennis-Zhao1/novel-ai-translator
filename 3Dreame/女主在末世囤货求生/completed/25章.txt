**Pearl Group's Divestment**

After sending out the message, she put her phone aside and focused on mingling with the crowd. The people gathered here were all seasoned players in the business world, each one calculating their moves in their minds, fully aware of the underlying intentions at play.

Luo Bingtin didn’t lead the conversation; she simply expressed her gratitude for everyone’s concern and assured them that she would handle things appropriately. However, what everyone truly feared was her "appropriate handling."

The share structure of the Pearl Group was straightforward: Luo Bingtin held 82% of the shares, with the remaining 18% having been exchanged years ago by her grandfather for the sake of going public and for other business dealings. As the sole major shareholder, any small amount she chose to divest wouldn’t affect her control over the Pearl Group, yet it would allow others to benefit from a piece of the pie.

The immense value of the Pearl Group didn’t just stem from the market value of its products; it was also rooted in years of established brand reputation. Furthermore, there was the jade mine owned by the Luo family in Myanmar, where each stone unearthed represented pure profit. Owning shares in the Pearl Group was akin to gaining free money—who could resist that?

Emotionally, Luo Bingtin was reluctant to see the Pearl Group, a legacy from her grandfather, fall into someone else’s hands. Yet, the situation was dire, and she was genuinely running low on funds. Whether she could liquidate Pearl Group shares to recover her cash flow would directly impact her ability to settle the remaining payments for that batch of weapons from Saudi Arabia.

Originally, the funds were reserved for the doomsday bunker and stockpiling supplies, but those had long since been exhausted. Even if she could liquidate the gold and jewels from the intercepted shipment, and the prices remained favorable enough to cover the weapon costs, there wouldn’t be enough left for anything else. Luo Bingtin had a long list of items she wanted to stockpile.

The doomsday bunker was simply too expensive. Even splitting the costs with the Zhu family had her feeling financially strained, while the Zhu family seemed to navigate their affairs with ease, showcasing the advantages of a well-established family with deep pockets.

After a moment of internal lament, she steeled herself to face the crowd, maintaining the façade of a naïve young lady who appeared easy to manipulate.

“Luo niece, I’ve watched you grow up. With something as significant as the transfer of Pearl Group shares, how can your uncle just stand by and let you make hasty decisions? What if you get deceived?” A man with a receding hairline spoke earnestly, yet his tone gave off an air of superiority.

Luo Bingtin refrained from responding, merely nodding obediently. Another man, catching the drift, chimed in, “Indeed, I was good friends with your father during our studies abroad. I can offer my advice too, dear.”

At this point, the room was buzzing with voices, each giving off the impression that their guidance was in her best interest. 

Luo Bingtin lowered her eyes and noticed her phone ringing—it was a call from Zhu family’s younger uncle. Instantly, her acting skills kicked in; she picked up the phone in a flustered manner, hesitating to answer. 

The man closest to her, the one with the receding hairline, swiftly reached over to hang up her phone. Receiving a grateful look from Luo Bingtin, he felt a swell of pride, as if he had just saved the day.

“Don’t worry, dear niece. Your uncle is here to help. If you face any challenges, you can always count on me,” he said, adopting the tone of a comforting elder, trying to reassure the visibly flustered girl.

“Wuwuwu,” Luo Bingtin whimpered, her voice breaking as she recounted the situation clearly. It turned out that the reason she needed to sell her shares in the Pearl Group was due to cash flow issues. How could a princess who once had no money troubles suddenly find herself in such a predicament? It all traced back to Zhu family’s youngest son, who had a greedy ambition and had siphoned off all her funds through a flashy doomsday amusement park project.

Coinciding with the upcoming jade stone gambling conference in Myanmar, Luo Bingtin had also traded away other assets for some flashy yet useless items—a yacht, a helicopter, and reportedly even a high-end modified car that burned through cash like wildfire. 

After this series of transactions, especially considering that the Zhu family daughter had returned home, the two girls had basically been inseparable, leading everyone to believe this was a coordinated series of traps laid by the Zhu family against the Pearl Group.

“Such treacherous little schemers!” another uncle exclaimed angrily. He wasn’t genuinely upset for Luo Bingtin’s plight; rather, he was frustrated that he hadn’t seized the opportunity himself.

He also began to doubt the rumors that old man Luo had left networks to protect Luo Bingtin. Given the current situation, it seemed highly unlikely. Otherwise, how could she lose everything so quickly just because she had been abroad for a few days, leading to cash flow issues and the need to liquidate her shares?

At this point, they felt they had to act quickly. Each uncle’s demeanor grew increasingly eager, their tones filled with warmth, akin to vendors enticing children with candy.

Watching their twisted expressions made Luo Bingtin feel nauseated. She opted to ignore them, pretending to cry instead.

Just then, her secretary knocked and informed her that several more groups were requesting to meet with Luo Bingtin and had been ushered into the adjacent conference room.

Wiping away her nonexistent tears, Luo Bingtin apologized to her elders and headed into the next meeting room. The people inside were unfamiliar; she had seen them at the banquet but couldn’t place their businesses. After exchanging business cards, they stated their intentions.

Luo Bingtin collected the cards, indicating that she was still considering her options for partners and needed time to weigh her choices carefully.

Both groups that had entered the room shared the same goal: they saw the young, inexperienced girl as easy prey without strong tactics or means to resist. They overlooked the fact that while she might seem simple, her competitors were far too formidable.

One representative from a leading construction company proposed a full buyout of all shares being offered by Pearl Group. Another representative from a prominent energy family echoed the same sentiment, declaring they could also take over.

Luo Bingtin could never let her grandfather's Pearl Group slip away so easily. If she was going to seek excitement, she intended to follow through completely.

Soon, other industry representatives began to express their interest, but one in particular caught Luo Bingtin’s attention. A man claiming to represent the leading home goods company spoke up. Luo Bingtin scrutinized the business card and the representative’s appearance closely, quickly recognizing the name of Fu Boqi’s company. 

This man was unfamiliar to her from her previous life, and she had hoped to encounter Fu Boqi this time to see what he was like before the apocalypse. Yet, he was nowhere to be found, leaving Luo Bingtin feeling a twinge of disappointment.

Seeing Luo Bingtin’s change in expression, the man named Changsheng assumed he had misspoken. He worried that if the young lady took offense, she might abruptly cut off their potential collaboration, which would be disastrous since he had already promised old man Fu success in this endeavor.

Luo Bingtin quickly composed herself, ensuring the other party didn’t notice her momentary lapse. 

“Thank you all for your interest in the Pearl Group. I appreciate your sincerity, but the matter of collaboration requires further discussion,” she stated, summoning her secretary and assistant to arrange follow-up meetings before hurrying back to the adjacent room. 

As she opened the door, the group of people who had just exited the meeting room caught sight of the individuals seated inside and felt a jolt of surprise at the speed of these proceedings.
