**Chapter One: The Museum**

After years of military service, Xie Jinghang had fought on numerous battlefields and completed countless missions, but he'd never witnessed a war that ended so abruptly. The absurdity of the situation weighed heavily on him, even more so than on Luo Bingtin. 

In the past, he had to give his all to secure a victory. Was this the true power of modern weaponry? The overwhelming force that left the enemy utterly defenseless?

Throughout their journey, Luo Bingtin remained silent, feeling inadequate and weak. If it weren't for Uncle Zhu's miraculous intervention, the stronghold would have certainly been drenched in blood today.

With her head down, she began to contemplate the urgent need for space upgrades. She had a strong premonition that the upgraded version of herself would be entirely different.

While the two of them grappled with their internal struggles, Meng Ge accepted the situation with remarkable composure. Weapons were meant to strike and intimidate the enemy.

After retrieving Uncle Zhu and the others, Aunt Li hurried back to the cafeteria. “Oh no, my dumplings are about to go soggy!”

With the Lunar New Year behind them, the new year in Huaguo had officially begun. Following the betrayal of their clan and the assault on Kunshan, Grandpa Zhu's already fragile health had deteriorated further.

Fortunately, the temperature hadn't continued to drop after the spring thaw; the snow was no longer falling endlessly as it had before.

Luo Bingtin knew it was time for her to take action; the upgrade to her space couldn't wait. She had been pondering where to find the materials to craft a mirror. These spiritually infused items would likely be found only in the hands of collectors or in museums.

Since the apocalypse, she hadn't ventured out to scavenge for supplies, and searching for antiques was hard to explain to outsiders—antiques held no value in a post-apocalyptic world.

Resolute, she informed Uncle Zhu that she would be gone for a few days before jumping into her vehicle and driving off.

Meng Ge and Xie Jinghang were occupied with their own matters. Occasionally, the two would lead groups to search for supplies, but Luo Bingtin didn’t elaborate on her plans, simply stating that she was handling supply issues.

As she drove the armored vehicle out of the base, the iron chains added to the tires for traction made for an uncomfortable ride, jolting with every bump.

Having already mapped out her route in her room, she knew that museums and private collectors were the best places to find ancient artifacts. After the apocalypse, those private collectors might have hidden their treasures away, so it made sense to check the museum first.

Unbeknownst to her, a shadow followed closely behind. Relying on her psychic abilities, she evaded hordes of zombies, dispatching the scattered ones with precise shots to the head.

When she detected the presence of the pursuers, they had just entered her psychic range. Without waiting for them to react, she set off some firecrackers, watching as the zombies were drawn to the noise, surrounding the other vehicle.

With a playful wave of her hand, she taunted them, likely members of the Kunshan base, before pressing down on the accelerator to leave them behind.

From that point on, she became even more cautious, occasionally taking detours to ensure no one was tailing her. After confirming that only the previous pair was following her, she navigated through the chilly urban landscape, where the winter cold didn’t hinder the zombies’ movements.

Her time spent training in the space had strengthened her body significantly; she was no longer the frail young lady she once was. Handling zombies was now second nature to her.

Eventually, she arrived at the museum's entrance. Expanding her psychic senses, she found no unusual activity, although there were plenty of zombies. Drawing her sword, she began to slice through them one by one.

Luo Bingtin had visited the museum as a child, and compared to the family heirlooms at home, the exhibits were merely for casual observation. She didn’t hold out much hope this time.

From her recollections, the museum primarily showcased human history and agricultural tools, reflecting the civilization and economic levels of the time. Genuine treasures were likely hoarded in the treasure hall.

As her arm began to ache from swinging the sword, she finally stepped into the museum's grand hall. She had intentionally left a few zombies alive to guard against unexpected intruders.

In the apocalyptic world, while ill intentions could come and go, one should always be wary of others.

With a flashlight in hand, she quickly ventured deeper into the museum, which was quite expansive with two floors. Dried blood stains near the entrance hinted at previous tragedies.

Ignoring the grim reminders, she employed her psychic abilities to scan the ancient artifacts displayed in the cases. Some emitted a faint, grayish glow that was nearly imperceptible, while others were semi-transparent with subtle shine.

Quickly passing through one section, she followed the signs deeper into the museum. Although it was quiet inside, she still hadn’t stumbled upon any treasures.

The use of her psychic powers drained her energy, so she sought out an employee office, locked the door, and stepped into her space to recover and grab a bite to eat.

Being out alone was surprisingly liberating. She didn’t have to worry about exposing her space, so when hunger struck, she pulled out some pre-packaged meals she had stockpiled. In this desolate place, she didn’t have to consider how things looked; she could simply rest and even take a shower—such ease was a rare luxury.

Initially bored, Luo Bingtin discovered the joy of solitude. After tidying herself up and recharging her energy, she stepped back out of her space.

The cold air hit her, causing her to shiver slightly. She chuckled at herself, shaking her head as she opened the door to continue her exploration.

The deeper she went, the darker it became, yet her steps never faltered. The sooner she wrapped things up, the sooner she could return home and ease her family's worries.

Finally, her psychic abilities detected the presence of a treasure nearby. It glowed with a soft, radiant white light—a hue she had never encountered before.

Following the gleam, she navigated around various display cases until she finally laid eyes on its true form: a phoenix crown, beautifully illuminated by the large pearls encrusted upon it. The pearls were about 20mm in diameter, and even from a distance, she could tell it was a valuable piece. The surrounding wall displayed a brief introduction to the crown, but she didn’t have time for details. Since it was an antique, she needed to act fast.

However, the glass display case refused to budge, and there was no visible lock. Could it be a similar setup to the laboratory on the lower floor, requiring a control panel and password to unlock?

After pondering the problem for a while, Luo Bingtin smacked her forehead. Why was she overcomplicating things? She could just absorb the entire display case into her space.

Realizing that her limited thinking had constrained her actions, she pivoted her mindset, and suddenly, the possibilities were boundless.

If she could collect anything she liked in the museum, why not take everything that caught her eye? Anything that seemed interesting, beautiful, or valuable—into her space it went.

She didn’t limit herself to just treasures; she absorbed entire display cases, leading her to gather items with her eyes closed when she felt overwhelmed.

Even a jade artifact at the entrance didn’t escape her grasp—though it was common jade, its size and exquisite craftsmanship marked it as a piece from a renowned master.

That bronze vessel? She had seen it on television countless times!

The lacquerware was also gorgeous, and she collected it all.

Her space had plenty of room to fill, and this designated area was spacious enough for her to continue her endeavor.

When she finally felt fatigued from her collecting spree, she stepped back into her space to rest. She had practically scoured the entire two floors of the museum.

As she prepared to leave, she noted it was already four in the afternoon. If she hurried, she could make it home before dark.

However, she hadn’t spotted the entrance to the treasure hall and couldn’t quite recall if it was located within the museum.

Just as she was about to exit, her psychic senses detected a commotion outside—the sound of someone battling zombies at the museum entrance.

Luo Bingtin didn’t rush out. It was wise to observe from the shadows until she could identify the newcomers.

Hiding behind a grand column in the lobby, she peeked out to see a group of three men and two women. Each one carried bulging backpacks and wore thick down jackets, suggesting they had come in a group to scavenge for supplies.

But there weren’t any major supermarkets around here—how had they ended up here?

She watched as they huffed and puffed, finally dispatching the three or four zombies lingering at the entrance, before they stumbled into the lobby and closed the half-broken glass door behind them.

Internally, Luo Bingtin scoffed. What difference did it make whether the door was closed or not? All it did was slow her down on her way out.
