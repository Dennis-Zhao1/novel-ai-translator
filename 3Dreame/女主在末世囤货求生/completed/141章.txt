Little Fanboy

"Speaking of which, I have to report something! Lolo, you have no idea, that little brat is such a good pretender. She made Pei Shang angry at the Longxiang Base and then came back to vent her frustrations on me. But she has people protecting her everywhere—in the Longxiang Base, it's Pei Qian, and when she comes back, it's Xie Jinghang. It drives me crazy!" 

Luo Bingtin shot a glance at Xie Jinghang, who immediately felt a wave of discomfort wash over him. He quickly explained, "That girl has a bit of a complicated background. Pei Qian and I only let her off the hook to draw out the people behind her. If we just killed her, we’d lose the trail to their plans." 

"I followed the addresses given by Fu Kuandan, but I couldn't find Fu Buqi, which shows he's been keeping a close watch on us. Maybe we can find a breakthrough through that girl." 

Luo Bingtin nodded and patted Zhu Yidan, who was clinging to her side. "Alright, alright. I promise you, after everything's done, you can vent however you like. But for now, just bear with it and act your part." 

Zhu Yidan, who thought returning would mean relief, let out a wail that sounded as if she were about to collapse in tears. "I regret it!" 

They sent Zhu Yidan off with her uncle to meet her parents and brother, while leaving Xie Jinghang and Meng Ge in the office to plan their next steps. Xie Jinghang meticulously recounted the things he had discovered while tracking Fu Buqi, raising many questions for analysis. Meng Ge frowned deeply as he listened. 

"Are you sure you’re not being monitored with GPS or something? How can they react so quickly?" 

Xie Jinghang felt the same; even before the apocalypse, such rapid responses would be rare. Now, it was even more difficult. He had also asked the Noisy Ghost system if it had similar capabilities, but the answer was vague, leaving everything open to interpretation. 

Luo Bingtin remained optimistic. Over the past few days, the new ability users had made astonishing progress. After training, they formed a fearsome team, and with the medicine in hand, the collective power of everyone awakened at the Longxiang Base was enormous. 

After reassuring Xie Jinghang for a moment, Meng Ge noted that it was time to attend the patrol team meeting and left. This left the two in the office staring at each other in silence. 

Suddenly remembering something important, Luo Bingtin began discussing the situation regarding the new ability users. She mentioned that there were two with mutated abilities. Xie Jinghang raised his eyebrows in surprise, particularly intrigued by Luo Fan, who had the replication ability, and stated he wanted to see Luo Fan's test results in the lab. 

For the past few days, Luo Fan had been undergoing various ability tests with Dr. Zhang from 4:30 to 5:30 PM. The blood tests showed nothing unusual, and the crystal core had been CT scanned with no special findings. Dr. Zhang, undeterred, decided to shift his approach to explore the limits of Luo Fan's abilities. 

Luo Fan was equally eager to learn more about himself; understanding his boundaries would help him transcend them. Going now would allow them to catch today’s tests just in time. When Dr. Zhang saw Xie Jinghang arrive, he was surprised and quickly adjusted the testing plan, allowing Luo Fan to interact with Xie Jinghang. 

Luo Fan was actually a huge fan of Xie Jinghang. He had always hoped to awaken lightning abilities. Now, as soon as he touched Xie Jinghang, a strange energy surged through him, entirely different from anything he had felt before. 

It wasn't like the destructive impulses of Wu Xiaogang, nor the sluggishness of other abilities. The sensation of the lightning ability felt like his meridians were soaking in a hot spring—tingly and slightly painful. 

He described his experience honestly, while Dr. Zhang recorded everything. Luo Bingtin shot a curious glance at Xie Jinghang; the description seemed eerily similar to her own experience with spiritual energy in her space. Could it be that Xie Jinghang had a similar sensation? 

Yet Xie Jinghang showed no particular reaction, perhaps due to the nature of his abilities, refocusing his attention on Luo Fan. 

After a moment of closed eyes and concentration, Luo Fan raised his hand and unleashed a bolt of lightning at the dummy hanging on the lab wall. With the full power of a Level 3 ability user, the dummy's head exploded, scattering pieces all over the floor. 

Luo Fan realized that the gap between ordinary abilities and mutated abilities was vast. He often replicated Meng Ge's metal abilities, which he thought were the strongest among ordinary abilities, but lightning and ice abilities were on a whole other level. 

Before his mental energy ran out, he unleashed a flurry of attacks, pounding the dummies into a pulp. Dr. Zhang recorded the destruction values, and soon the analysis report came out, revealing that the highest destruction still belonged to Wu Xiaogang's unique ability. Dr. Zhang referred to this ability as "mental manipulation," also categorized as a mutated ability, which both Luo Bingtin and Xie Jinghang concurred with. 

Moreover, Wu Xiaogang's ability proved to be highly unstable, a conclusion drawn after several tests and comparisons by Luo Fan. 

Seeing Dr. Zhang's enthusiastic demeanor, Luo Bingtin encouraged him to continue his work, having already received plenty of surprises. 

As they brought Luo Fan back to the training ground, he normally wouldn’t need further training, but he still returned every day to refresh his metal abilities. 

Reluctantly, Luo Fan hooked his arm around Meng Ge's shoulder. Noticing his intentions, Xie Jinghang said, "From now on, you’ll go out with my team. Do whatever you want." 

Luo Fan nearly jumped for joy at his idol's promise, unable to hide his excitement, even as Wang Xinxin shot him a few exasperated looks. 

After Luo Bingtin briefed Wang Xinxin, she addressed everyone, explaining that they would need to team up to hunt zombies during training, mixing the old with the new. The crystal cores they obtained could be used to enhance their abilities without needing to turn them in to the fortress. 

Everyone cheered; they knew the awakening potion sold for a hefty price. Soon, the number of ability users would only increase, and their futures would hinge on their ability levels, making upgrades their top priority. 

Xie Jinghang's status had changed, and he could only reside in the outer housing of the fortress. He didn’t mind, but Zhu Yidan looked longingly at the old dorm building, wishing to cry at the thought of her warm and cozy room, wishing these troubling days would end soon. 

Luo Bingtin made a special trip around the exterior of the dormitory, curious to see if Little White Lotus truly no longer recognized her after they had spent so much time together. 

Luo Fan was equally reluctant to part with his idol so soon, insisting on following him to see Xie Jinghang off. Wang Xinxin had grown accustomed to sticking to Luo Bingtin and tagged along, leading the four of them—two boys and two girls—as they walked towards the dormitory. Along the way, they encountered many people who saluted and greeted Luo Bingtin. 

After about ten minutes, they still hadn’t reached the dorm area when they spotted Little White Lotus standing by the guard, her delicate figure swaying as she animatedly spoke to someone. 

Little White Lotus had her back to them, gesturing vivaciously, her words dripping with a kind of affected charm. As they got closer, their expressions grew increasingly strange. 

Wang Xinxin looked puzzled and frowning, Luo Fan was curious, Luo Bingtin was speechless, while Xie Jinghang wore a neutral expression. 

Hearing their footsteps, Little White Lotus turned around. Seeing Xie Jinghang, whom she hadn’t seen all afternoon, she cheered and dashed towards him. 

"Xie Ge, you're back!"
