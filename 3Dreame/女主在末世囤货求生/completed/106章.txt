**Unexpected Joy**

After sharing his plans with Lorrie, he was taken aback when she frowned and said, "By your logic, Fu Boqi is merely a son-in-law who relies on his father-in-law and wife for everything. But why didn't I encounter his father-in-law in my last life? I joined the Kunshan Base early on and barely saw his wife a few times. Later on, he openly got together with that green tea b*tch without any attempt to hide it."

Xie Jinghang pondered for a moment, realizing he needed to clarify how this version of Fu Boqi had managed to strike a deal with Pei Qian at the Longxiang Base. He was aware of what Pei Qian wanted, and in terms of negotiation, he felt he might have a shot at winning.

In the days that followed, aside from clearing the zombies along the mountain road, they focused on repairing the damaged roadways. They filled the large craters left by the bombardment using earth-type abilities, while the road surface was constructed with cement that Lorrie had previously stored in her space. 

She had once considered using her space to create a house, but realized that it wasn't as simple as just wishing for it. She hoped that after her system upgraded, she could conjure things herself, but reality often proved otherwise—much to her dismay.

Suddenly, she recalled the old house she had failed to take with her. Previously, her mental strength had been insufficient to store something so large. Now that her psychic abilities had improved, perhaps she could give it a try.

Over the past few days, Xie Jinghang had confirmed that Fu Boqi wasn’t relying on his father-in-law to settle into the Longxiang Base. The only support he had was his sinister system, which could control zombies for his own use. Or had he awakened a dark-type ability? After all, in his previous life, he had been an ordinary person. Given that he had awakened abilities in this life, it wasn't impossible for Fu Boqi to have undergone a similar transformation.

What exactly was Fu Boqi planning? Was he aiming to become the zombie king?

Perhaps he would find out soon enough.

Resolute about visiting the Longxiang Base, Xie Jinghang informed Lorrie, only to be surprised when she insisted on accompanying him. He hesitated to agree immediately. In reality, what Pei Qian sought could easily be achieved by Lorrie. However, he chose to keep that to himself, not wanting her to think he was using her for his own purposes. Although they were partners, he genuinely wanted to avoid any feelings of exploitation.

After briefing the team on the next steps for the fortress, everything was finally on track. Although their ammunition reserves had taken a hit, the ability users had received a substantial number of crystal cores from the recent zombie siege. Besides a portion exchanged for daily necessities, the rest were used to enhance their abilities. It wouldn't be long before many of them reached level three, or even become level four ability users.

Strengthening their abilities was fundamental for everyone in the fortress to secure their livelihoods. This operation was a collaboration between two bases, and both Xie Jinghang and Lorrie understood that they couldn't infiltrate the Longxiang Base unnoticed like last time. Instead, they would lead a team openly, and after completing their mission, they could take a detour to the old house to see if she could retrieve it with her enhanced psychic powers.

The team was kept relatively small. Xie Jinghang led the group, accompanied by Lorrie, Brother Meng, An Min, and just two squad members, leaving the vice-captain and Zhu Yidan behind at the fortress.

He instructed Zhu Shushu and Liu Xiaohui to conduct another training and selection process for the ordinary people. Some of those who gained confidence from the recent victory against the zombies began to aspire to become guards, hoping to empower themselves to better protect the fortress and their loved ones.

Zhu Shushu, Zhu Yidan, Liu Xiaohui, and others came to see them off, providing final instructions. As they looked into the eager eyes of the crowd, Lorrie waved goodbye as she got into the vehicle. Just as they were about to leave, Dr. Zhang and several young researchers rushed over, shouting excitedly, "Goddess Lorrie, we’re out! We’ve developed it!"

Behind them were a few young researchers, their faces shadowed from countless sleepless nights immersed in their work, yet their eyes sparkled with excitement this time.

Lorrie quickly stepped out of the car and waited for them to catch up. 

"The ability activation serum is out! Goddess Lorrie, take a look!"

Dr. Zhang presented a silver cylindrical vial, holding it out for her to see. Inside, a light blue liquid shimmered, reflecting a silvery glow under the light—visually stunning.

Xie Jinghang and Brother Meng leaned in from either side for a closer look. Lorrie held it up and asked, "Has it been tested?"

Dr. Zhang nodded, gesturing toward a shy yet steady young researcher named Lu, who had previously led the charge in dismantling computer hard drives.

As Lu realized everyone's eyes were on him, he smiled awkwardly, raised his hand, and conjured a tender sprout that rapidly grew, wrapping itself around a nearby power pole.

Everyone gasped in astonishment. Was this ability already level two? Typically, a level one wood ability user could only stimulate existing plants; it was at level two that one could directly manifest vines from their palm without needing nearby vegetation.

They all looked at Lorrie, their eyes shining with hope. This meant that with the serum, ordinary people could become ability users, significantly increasing their capacity for self-defense and combat.

However, Lorrie frowned and exchanged glances with Xie Jinghang. They both understood that the ability enhancement serum had only been developed in the sixth year of the apocalypse in their previous lives due to the increasing difficulty of utilizing zombie crystal cores. How could an ability activation serum be the first to emerge this time?

Seeing the excitement on everyone's faces contrasted with the complex expressions on Lorrie and Xie Jinghang's faces, Dr. Zhang assumed they were questioning the safety and authenticity of the serum. He led them toward the lab, excitedly praising Lu's boldness and carefulness in discovering the fusion and separation of several reagent groups, overwhelming them with technical jargon. 

But the essence of it was clear: this ability activation serum was a product of fusing and separating the abilities of ability users with zombie crystal cores, enhanced by some special liquids that had been provided by Xie Jinghang on a whim.

Feeling somewhat embarrassed by the sudden praise, Xie Jinghang noticed Lorrie's gaze towards him. He slowed his pace to whisper to her, "Lake water."

Lorrie gasped internally. Last time, Xie Jinghang had casually requested a bottle of lake water to test whether it had healing properties, never expecting it would be used for research in the lab. How could she have overlooked that?

Perhaps she had always thought the water from the small pond was unclean, and even after its upgrade to a lake, she had never dared to drink it.

Later, she definitely needed to take a few sips to see if her abilities had upgraded again.

In reality, she had completely forgotten that the water used for bathing in their RV was connected to the lake, making the relation between drinking the lake water and ability upgrades rather tenuous. But the healing effect was indeed real.

Dr. Zhang rambled on excitedly, and when he turned around and noticed that Xie Jinghang and Lorrie were trailing behind, he hurried back to pull them into the lab.

Upon entering, Lorrie took in the orderly chaos of the workstations and a row of instruments—some procured before the apocalypse, and others salvaged from the lab on the second sub-level. It felt immensely rewarding to see them all put to good use.

Dr. Zhang was even more thrilled than they were, explaining, "Dr. Zhu is leading the research on the ability enhancement serum, while I took a different approach to develop the ability activation serum. Lu had a brilliant idea and even volunteered as a test subject. We didn't expect it to succeed so quickly!"

At that, Lorrie felt a twinge of fear. Using oneself as a test subject was risky; what if something went wrong and he turned into a zombie?

Dr. Zhang seemed to sense their concerns and chuckled. "We've experimented on rabbits. Some of those rabbits have begun showing signs of abilities, while others have had no effect, but not a single one has died. That's why we dared to test it on ourselves. This version is the best one we've developed based on data and experimentation."

Realizing that they weren’t recklessly experimenting with their lives put her at ease. She learned that Lu had only developed his abilities three days after the injection and had undergone a brain CT scan that revealed the formation of crystal cores in his brain. Now, she felt more at ease with their experimental results.

If things continued to progress like this, the fortress could completely overpower any base, and everyone would become ability users, no longer fearing zombie attacks.

Describing it as an unexpected joy was an understatement.
