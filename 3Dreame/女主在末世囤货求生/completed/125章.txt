**The Power of Filial Piety**

"Let’s hear what happened," said Luo Binging, sitting in her office chair with a slight tilt of her head. Before her stood Xie Jinghang, along with his team members and Zhu Yidan.

Zhu Yidan, who had been camping outdoors for three days, looked far from presentable. Her hair was a tangled mess, her coat and pants wrinkled, with grass and dirt clinging to the hems. Feeling embarrassed, she couldn't help but steal a glance at Xie Jinghang, who stood there calmly, his gaze fixed on Luo Binging. She mentally cursed him, thinking, *What a jerk! I helped him out, and this is how he repays me?*

"What's going on? Are you all going to play mute and not explain anything?" The atmosphere in the room was tense, and unable to bear the pressure, Zhu Yidan spoke up first.

"Sisters, I was wrong—so wrong! I shouldn't have taken it upon myself to stage a little drama to ignite your jealousy and rekindle your love, leading to my three days of camping outside, eating poorly, and not even getting to see you. Boohoo!" 

*Host, this girl is such a green tea bitch. She’s more articulate than I am and is putting on a pitiful act. Clearly, she was trying to steal her friend's boyfriend, but now that the plan's gone awry, she’s trying to whitewash herself. How naive!*

"Shut up." 

Xie Jinghang immediately silenced the nagging voice in his head. The dialogue on his communication screen erupted like a barrage of comments on a video platform, but he chose to ignore it.

"I appreciate your efforts," Luo Binging said with a thinly veiled smile directed at Zhu Yidan. 

"Sisters, don't be mad! It was all just acting. Captain Xie, why don’t you say something too?" 

Zhu Yidan, seeing her friend’s expression turning to despair, realized this wasn’t going as scripted in the dramas she watched.

With everyone's attention now on him, Xie Jinghang finally spoke up. "Well, it was just a show. Miss Zhu insisted on thanking me for rescuing her and mentioned she couldn't stand to see me unrequited in love. She wanted to stir up some excitement to provoke your possessiveness. I just don’t know if it worked."

He looked at Luo Binging with genuine interest, as if awaiting her response. 

Luo Binging felt uneasy under his gaze, taking a sip of her tea before snapping back, "Who asked you about that? I want to know what's going on with Fu Buchi's son."

Xie Jinghang’s expression shifted slightly, blinking as he replied seriously, "It’s just a transaction. That kid has been unhappy with his father for a long time. He’s ambitious but lacks the capability and thought he could use external forces to take down his father and seize control."

Luo Binging's eyes widened, surprised. "Is that true? The son is unhappy with his father? But he should be Fu Buchi's only son! His status is already pretty high; shouldn't it all belong to him in the future?"

Xie Jinghang shrugged. "That's what you’d expect, but considering he was sent to handle this, it doesn’t seem like he’s favored."

Everyone fell silent. Although these newly arrived superpowered individuals were stronger, it didn’t guarantee victory. The father-son relationship was indeed intriguing. 

"When did he reach out to you?" Luo Binging leaned in, resting her chin on her hand.

"During our trip to Longxiang Base. He contacted my informant," Xie Jinghang replied.

"You trust this useless kid? He doesn't even have superpowers!" 

"Exactly because he lacks abilities, he has to rely on us. He can show sincerity in seeking our cooperation. I suggest you talk to him directly."

Luo Binging nodded, and her deputy immediately stepped out to bring Fu Kuandan in.

As Fu Kuandan entered, he felt a surge of unease at the sight of the gathering. His usual gloomy expression was ill-suited for a friendly smile, creating a moment of awkward confusion on his face that was quite unflattering.

In fact, Fu Buchi and his two sons were quite good-looking, known for their charming appearances. If not for his looks, Fu Buchi wouldn’t have been able to marry the daughter of a major player in the home furnishings industry. His two sons, however, each had their quirks—one was arrogant and pretentious while the other was gloomy and introverted, yet both could be considered handsome.

Under the scrutiny of their gazes, Fu Kuandan swallowed hard several times, feeling an urge to flee. 

Luo Binging watched coldly, fully aware that he was putting on an act. She had seen his true self at the Kunshan base—cunning and shrewd, always ready to seize an opportunity. Surely, Xie Jinghang wouldn’t be fooled by his facade.

Xie Jinghang instructed his deputy to keep watch outside, leaving just the four of them in the office.

Zhu Yidan looked at Fu Kuandan curiously. Unlike Luo Binging, who had known him for over twenty years, Zhu Yidan thought the young master appeared rather appealing. 

Luo Binging, understanding her friend’s unspoken thoughts, chose to remain silent and observe, planning to discuss it privately later.

"Fu Er Shao just mentioned wanting to join us. I'm curious—do you believe that yourself?" she finally broke the silence.

Fu Kuandan, seizing the opportunity to perform, cleared his throat. "Miss Luo, I genuinely seek cooperation. The initial plan was to send at least ten enhanced superpowered individuals, but I replaced them with one Level Three superpowered person and four ordinary folks, showcasing my sincerity."

"Moreover, the original plan was to send at least fifty superpowered individuals, but now it’s fewer than thirty. Most importantly, I’ve shared the method to enhance powers with Captain Xie."

Both Luo Binging and Zhu Yidan turned their gazes to Xie Jinghang, who nodded but added, "That method is too extreme; normal people can’t handle it."

Fu Kuandan nodded in agreement, forcing a bitter smile. "My father has lost his mind. He uses live subjects for experiments, injecting them with zombie blood. The failed superpowered individuals are just discarded, piled up like a mountain. Those who survive are controlled, turned into his obedient dogs."

He trembled as he spoke, his performance almost indistinguishable from Zhu Yidan's earlier act.

Luo Binging held back her frustration. Since he’d been given the chance to perform, she could endure a little longer, but her hands unconsciously clenched into fists. Noticing this detail, Fu Kuandan misinterpreted it as fear and became even more animated.

"I’ve always opposed my father’s inhumane actions, but I feel powerless to stop him. I just hope to find capable people to help prevent him from hurting innocent lives again."

His expression conveyed a sense of righteousness and familial betrayal, nearly moving Zhu Yidan to tears.

"I didn’t expect you to be this kind-hearted, willing to betray your father for the sake of innocents," she said, her voice full of sincerity.

At this, Luo Binging, Xie Jinghang, and Fu Kuandan all thought, *Are you mocking him?*

Fu Kuandan choked on his drink at this point, and Luo Binging confirmed he was genuinely struggling to breathe.

Well, choking to death is still a fate.

"Ha ha ha ha, Miss Zhu, you truly have a sense of humor," Fu Kuandan awkwardly cleared his throat and continued, "I’ve come to formally seek cooperation with Miss Luo. Together, let’s save all of humanity."

This time, it was Luo Binging who was taken aback, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the sudden lofty ideals he proclaimed.

Was that really necessary? It's truly unnecessary.

"I assure you, my sincerity is one hundred percent. How about I tell you where my father is currently?" 

"......" 

Truly the epitome of a filial son.
