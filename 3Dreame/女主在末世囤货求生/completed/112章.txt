**Allies**

Just moments ago, she was fuming and now she's grinning—women's moods change faster than flipping through a book.

Her mental strength had grown, and all the torment she had endured was still fresh in her mind, a bitter reminder linked to that hideous zombie.

She began to feel every inch of the space around her. To her surprise, everything was vibrant with color. The mountains shimmered with a subtle yellow-green hue, the lake glimmered with a misty blue, and the trees and grass emitted a soft white light. As she scanned the supplies, only gray shadows appeared, but the treasures she had collected in the treasure gallery radiated a brilliant array of colors.

All the animals in this realm cast faint red shadows, as if the blood coursing through their veins was made visible. Even the lake had mysteriously sprouted tiny fish.

She had never thought of using her mental power to explore the entire space. When she swept her gaze over the Mystic Mirror, she nearly blinded herself; the dazzling white light sparkled with a resplendent hue. It seemed that since the space had upgraded, the Mystic Mirror had changed more dramatically each time. Last time, it had added a frame, then changed its skin, and now it was flaunting special effects? 

What was this, a dress-up game for a premium member on a social platform?

Rubbing her stinging eyes, she withdrew her mental energy and settled back onto the sofa, staring at the Mystic Mirror.

“I’ve leveled up my mental power. Did you level up too?” she asked the mirror.

The Mystic Mirror remained silent, and she didn’t think much of it. After a while, the screen displayed a message: “Not a level up, just a replenishment of energy.”

That must refer to those glowing orbs. After asking about them for ages and getting no response, she felt a wave of boredom wash over her and decided to exit the space.

When she emerged, she found herself lying on a hospital bed. As she sat up, the door swung open, and Xie Jinghang strode in. Upon seeing Luo Bingtin awake, he rushed over to embrace her, visibly relieved.

Pei Qian followed closely behind but didn’t enter the room. Luo Bingtin felt a bit awkward upon seeing him and promptly pushed the man hugging her away.

“I’m fine, Xie Jinghang!” she exclaimed, winking at him. He understood the hint; they had an agreement to communicate discreetly about certain matters.

“Are you sure? Pei Qian, come take a look,” Xie Jinghang called over his shoulder.

Only then did Pei Qian step inside, raising his hand slightly. Luo Bingtin felt a surge of energy brush past her, and instinctively blocked it. Pei Qian's eyebrows shot up in surprise as he stared at her.

“Psychic ability?” 

Pei Qian exclaimed in disbelief, his voice barely above a whisper. A dual-ability user? Xie Jinghang quickly put the pieces together; she had managed to evade the psychic attacks from the hooded zombie, indicating she possessed at least some potential in that area, as expected.

Luo Bingtin adopted a look that said, "As long as I'm not awkward, the awkwardness belongs to others," and nodded in acknowledgment.

Pei Qian suddenly became excited, stepping forward to grip Luo Bingtin’s shoulder, but Xie Jinghang was quick to intervene, scolding him, “Hey, what are you doing? Keep your hands to yourself!”

Unfazed, Pei Qian turned to Luo Bingtin, brimming with enthusiasm. “Can you check on my sister’s core condition?”

Luo Bingtin was taken aback. Wasn’t he a psychic ability user himself? Why couldn’t he check? And wasn’t his sister sick due to a core issue?

“Isn’t your sister unwell?” she asked.

Pei Qian sighed and recounted the bizarre circumstances surrounding his sister’s illness. Both Luo and Xie were left astounded. Pei Qian’s sister, Pei Chang, had also awakened her psychic abilities, but not long after, she had been attacked by unidentified assailants, leading to signs of damage to her core. Initially, Pei Qian's psychic abilities had not caused harm; instead, they had resulted from the exhaustion of trying to repair Pei Chang’s core.

Now, with Pei Chang's core still unrepaired and his own abilities compromised, he had to rely on other psychic users for assistance. In reality, Pei Qian not only couldn't investigate but also desperately hoped that Luo Bingtin could help fix Pei Chang’s core. He knew this request was somewhat unreasonable, so he refrained from voicing it.

After pondering for a moment, Luo Bingtin agreed, “I can take a look. That’s easy enough.”

Meanwhile, Pei Qian was already considering what leverage he could use to ensure Luo Bingtin agreed to repair Pei Chang’s core—something she couldn’t refuse.

Luo Bingtin had already walked over to Pei Chang's hospital bed and raised her hand to sense. The core in Pei Chang's mind appeared clearly before her. She noted the small, light purple core, which was covered in fine cracks. However, it was far from shattered.

Luo Bingtin voiced her concerns, and Pei Qian was taken aback. “The core shows signs of recovery. No wonder her vital signs have stabilized,” he exclaimed. “She must have taken a special medicine to recover.”

It was a stroke of good luck; things were turning around. Pei Qian called for a doctor, and the response confirmed that Pei Chang was gradually improving, making him even more grateful to both Luo and Xie.

Watching Pei Qian, who held Pei Chang’s hand with tears of joy in his eyes, Luo Bingtin posed a question. “Pei Chang was attacked by a psychic ability user, right? Doesn’t that make her situation similar to mine?”

Pei Qian, unaware of who had attacked Luo Bingtin, suddenly connected the dots. Indeed, there were similarities; the only difference was the timing.

While everyone else was at the second level of abilities, Pei Chang had been attacked, whereas Luo Bingtin had been struck when she was at the fourth level. If they were dealing with the same assailant, what could their motives be? As he pondered, Luo Bingtin dropped a bombshell that caught Pei Qian completely off guard.

“I was attacked by a psychic zombie, and it can command a horde of zombies to attack cities. Who was behind your sister’s attack?”

“A psychic zombie?” Pei Qian was incredulous but realized it was the only explanation for the inconsistencies they faced.

Luo Bingtin nodded, detailing the hooded zombie's physical characteristics and the specifics of the attack. Now that she was a psychic ability user, she was slowly grasping the nuances of psychic control and energy characteristics. The hooded zombie's ability level was at least at the fourth tier.

Fortunately, they both possessed psychic abilities; even if they couldn't control the zombies, they could at least resist the hooded zombie's attacks. She also mentioned that Fu Buqi might be the instigator behind it all.

She hinted that Fu Buqi had some peculiarities, likely making him the mastermind behind the zombie virus.

Pei Qian furrowed his brow in thought. Until now, he had never had any interactions with Fu Buqi, let alone for his sister. Before the apocalypse, they hadn’t crossed paths in the marketplace; after all, they weren’t on the same level, and Fu Buqi had been relatively unknown at that time.

Pei Qian quickly deduced that Fu Buqi might be attempting to use the zombie virus to control humanity and profit from selling the antidote. However, his imagined scenario was far from reality.

Luo Bingtin and Xie Jinghang couldn’t straightforwardly reveal the outlandish truth about Fu Buqi having a system. It would be better to wait for the right moment to hint at it, allowing Pei Qian to figure it out on his own.

Fortunately, Pei Qian noted down the grievance from that night—Fu Buqi attempting to kidnap Pei Chang to coerce him had crossed a line. It was a sensitive area for Pei Qian, and he wouldn’t let it slide easily.

Anyone who dared to harm Pei Chang deserved to die.
