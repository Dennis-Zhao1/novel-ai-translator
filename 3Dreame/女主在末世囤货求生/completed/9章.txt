**The Secret to Opening the Mystic Realm**

As the evening's drinking party drew to a close, the lively chatter and laughter slowly faded into the night as guests departed, some looking triumphant, others merely merry. Luo Bingtian, however, remained silent, her gaze slightly downcast as she watched them leave, her heart heavy with a thousand thoughts. With Zhu Yidan, she bid farewell to their last friend before the entourage sent by the Zhu family whisked her away. Once they were gone, she turned and made a quick phone call, and shortly after, she too got into a car heading towards the old family estate.

Though she hadn’t consumed much alcohol that night, her mind was racing, pondering how long it would take for the elders of the second generation to catch on to her plans. She needed to act swiftly, to finish what she started in a decisive manner.

As the vehicle cruised smoothly towards the old estate’s farm warehouse, the alcohol from the party wore off, and she exchanged a brief word with her driver, who also acted as her bodyguard, before setting off to inspect the storage situation in the warehouse. The bodyguard kept a respectful distance behind her, ensuring her safety without being overbearing. Luo Bingtian stepped out of the vehicle, hoping to find everything as she remembered. After surviving the apocalypse for over five years, her recollection of the layout and routes around the old estate had faded significantly.

She needed to scout the place in advance; it would be easier to plan her actions later in the dead of night.

Once she confirmed her memories were accurate, Luo Bingtian decided against checking the warehouse goods and instead returned to the estate, where the old butler, Kang Bo, awaited her by the grand entrance, looking spry and alert. 

Hearing that the young miss was returning to the estate, he had stayed up, arranging for the remaining servants to tidy up her already immaculate bedroom and prepare some midnight snacks, just in case she needed anything.

Back in the familiar confines of her childhood home, Luo Bingtian felt a wave of nostalgia. The asset evaluation she had done had overlooked this place, perhaps subconsciously she had never intended to sell it. Sitting in the living room of the house where she had grown up, memories of her grandfather, parents, and even her previous self, carefree and full of laughter, lingered in every corner.

In her past life, she had left the old estate with only the valuable jewelry from the storeroom, leaving behind countless ancient texts, valuable calligraphy, and other precious relics. This time, she was determined to protect even the smallest scrap of paper within those walls.

After sending the butler and remaining servants off to rest, Luo Bingtian washed up and felt surprisingly alert. She made her way to her grandfather’s study.

The storeroom's location and the methods to access it were known only to her, so there was no risk of it being discovered if emptied. The study was meticulously cleaned every day, and her grandfather's unfinished calligraphy was still pressed under a weight, the ink in the nearby inkstone long dried. The brush remained poised as if ready to dip into the ink, bringing a wave of emotion to Luo Bingtian’s eyes.

Realizing the time, she gently closed the study door behind her, leaving only the soft, warm glow of a lamp beside the bookshelf. She approached the desk and opened the third drawer, rummaging through its contents.

After a moment, she heard a faint click, and the bookshelf shifted silently to reveal a dark, narrow gap just wide enough for her to slip through. Without bothering to leave even a trace of light behind, Luo Bingtian stepped into the hidden chamber.

As she entered the secret room, the bookshelf smoothly closed behind her, sealing her in darkness. Suddenly, bright lights flickered on, and even though she had been through this many times before, the intensity still momentarily blinded her.

Shaking her head to regain her composure, Luo Bingtian began surveying the room, which was just as she remembered—filled to the brim with books, scrolls, and stacks of boxes brimming with jewelry and precious stones. 

She had never considered how many generations of the Luo family had amassed these treasures, but as the sole heir, she vowed to protect them fiercely this time around. As she contemplated how to transport both the bookshelf and its contents into the space, her eyes landed on an ancient tome.

"Art of Observation" — this was a manual for cultivation, filled with cryptic verses and notes from generations of ancestors. It contained insights and methods related to mastering the art of observation.

In simple terms, the Art of Observation allowed practitioners to discern the quality and essence of high-grade gemstones through meditation, providing precise assessments during auctions and stone gambling—a skill she found invaluable as a certified gemologist. 

Luo Bingtian felt a pang of nostalgia, recalling how her grandfather had mentioned it once or twice but had never insisted she learn it. Given her current wealth and resources, she no longer needed to study the Art of Observation. Yet, the words of a certain figure from her past rang in her mind—his father possessed an immense reserve of gemstones; mastering this skill could help her navigate that world with clarity.

Wasn’t it just like GPS? A remote locator, an infrared detector?

She chuckled at her own absurd thoughts and began busily packing the books from the shelves into her space. After several trips back and forth, she found herself utterly exhausted.

Wasn’t there a more efficient way? Sitting cross-legged on the earthen floor of her space, she pondered how long it would take to move everything this way. 

Suddenly, she remembered that in her previous life, practitioners of space abilities could retrieve items with mere thoughts. Determined, she stepped out of the space and began attempting this method. After several failed attempts, she finally managed to pull a very thin booklet into her space.

At this point, her head was spinning, her energy depleted, as if all her mental faculties had been drained.

Mental energy?

Luo Bingtian suddenly grasped a crucial point; ever since her rebirth, her way of thinking and mental strength felt different than before. 

This wouldn’t do—she had to find a way to enhance her abilities. Otherwise, how could she possibly transport all the supplies from the farm warehouse? 

Turning back to the bookshelf in the secret room, she meticulously searched for any literature that might aid in enhancing her mental prowess. 

During this search, she inadvertently discovered a fragment of an ancient text titled "The Complete Book of the Jade Dragon's Mystic Realm," wedged between two books, easily overlooked.

Pulling it out, she realized it was indeed a fragment, but it contained essential information, such as the significance of two sundials representing time within and outside the space, indicating that time flowed slowly within the space, almost in a state of stasis.

This implied she could test the preservation capabilities of her space. In her previous life, space practitioners could only store items; they couldn’t enter or preserve anything, as the flow of time was the same as in the outside world.

The fragment also detailed the method to unlock the Jade Dragon Mystic Realm, with conditions that were rather stringent: one must possess Luo blood, the Jade Dragon must make contact with blood, and the person unlocking the realm must have impaired mental strength.

Luo Bingtian was torn between feelings of relief and despair; it was unfortunate that she needed impaired mental strength to access the space, yet ironic that once opened, she wouldn’t be able to utilize it properly. What a headache!

Fortunately, she also found a method for mental strength restoration. Without delay, she began to comprehend the incantations, quickly learning from the notes left by her ancestors.

But where could she find the spiritual energy needed to mend her meridians? Sitting cross-legged in the secret chamber, she scratched her head in frustration, then remembered that her phone was still in the space. As she flashed back in, she suddenly felt a gentle current of air brushing against her body, even in the stillness of the secret realm.

Was this spiritual energy? It wasn’t that it didn’t exist; she just hadn’t fully grasped the method to draw it in.

Without hesitation, Luo Bingtian began to meditate, focusing on guiding the currents of energy to cleanse her meridians, opening up every blocked point along her energy pathways.

It was hard to describe the sensation; had it not been for her strong willpower, she likely would have given up. Unblocking her meridians without external assistance could easily lead to harm, such as reversed energy flow. But with unwavering determination, she pressed on, enduring the challenge.

The results were worth it! Every part of her body ached delightfully as she allowed the spiritual energy to circulate freely through her meridians. Luo Bingtian lay back on the earthen floor, exhausted yet invigorated, her face weary but her eyes shining with resolve and unyielding spirit.
