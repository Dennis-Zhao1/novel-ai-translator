**Forced Transactions**

Luo Bingtin instinctively thought that if there were things better left unsaid, they should just remain unspoken. However, before she could voice her opinion, the other party cut straight to the chase.

“As long as you ensure the safety of our Zheng family starting today, the famous sword can belong to Miss Luo. We can even give you the others for free...” 

Before Mr. Zheng could finish his sentence, Luo Bingtin stood up, ready to leave. With the apocalypse looming, she wasn’t sure how long she would survive herself, let alone guarantee the safety of their entire family. This deal was impossible; the unpredictability of life meant no one could make such promises.

Unfortunately, the door was locked, and she found herself unable to leave. Meng Ge, who was visibly furious, couldn’t believe his ears. How could someone engage in such blatant coercion? For a few shabby swords, they expected the young lady to bear such heavy responsibility? Their audacity was astounding.

Mr. Zheng, however, spoke up, “Of course, the Zheng family will also be at your service. We can offer everything we have, just to secure our family's safety, even if it means a slim chance of survival.”

Luo Bingtin understood. They believed in prophecies, convinced that chaos was imminent, and that only the one who could bring forth the famous sword could protect their lineage. Logically, it made sense; if they believed in her, there might be a chance to survive.

Yet, she pondered whether she truly needed the Zheng family. She wasn’t some saint who felt compelled to save every life. After witnessing the exquisite craftsmanship of those Longquan swords, she felt a profound sadness over the potential loss of their legacy due to the end of the world. But she never intended to shoulder the lives of an entire family.

Lives were heavy burdens, and as someone who believed in karma, she couldn’t easily agree. But then again, wasn’t this current situation a consequence of the actions of their ancestors?

After much hesitation, Luo Bingtin asked, “How many people are in your Zheng family?”

Mr. Zheng’s eyes lit up with hope as he quickly replied, “Just me, my two sons and their wives, and my grandson Anmin. That makes six of us.”

Luo Bingtin felt a wave of relief wash over her. Thank goodness! If it had been a large family like the Zhu family, with branches and generations adding up to dozens of people, she would have been overwhelmed.

She nodded and instructed Mr. Zheng and Meng Ge to start packing. They should take everything essential and discard what they didn’t need. She would stay behind to discuss important matters with Mr. Zheng.

The topics were critical—what sacrifices the Zheng family had to make, their plans to relocate to the capital, and what they would do in the future. At least, she thought, there would be professionals to handle sharpening the Longquan swords, so she wouldn’t have to labor over them herself. Luo Bingtin comforted herself, “It’s going to be tough, little Luo.”

Though the Zheng family was small in numbers, their wealth was substantial. She didn’t covet it; instead, she felt admiration. Years of accumulation had made them prudent rather than wasteful, and their wealth rivaled that of a top-tier family in the capital, which was something Luo Bingtin hadn’t anticipated.

She inquired about their properties and cash, advising them to liquidate assets quickly and stockpile supplies. Given the urgency, they couldn’t afford to shop internationally; Hangzhou was prosperous, and resources were readily available there.

Once arrangements were set, Mr. Zheng urgently called back his youngest son, Anmin’s father. Two of his daughters-in-law were either working or living in the workshop with their husbands. He couldn’t explain everything over the phone, just that there was an emergency at home, and they needed to return quickly with all their asset documents and ID to gather at the old residence.

Luo Bingtin knew that this trip to acquire Longquan swords wouldn’t conclude anytime soon. For now, she couldn’t return to the capital; helping the Zheng family stockpile supplies was the priority.

The Zheng family had many connections in Hangzhou, but this operation needed to be discreet. Luo Bingtin planned to use Mingzhu Group’s name to gather supplies, arranging for Anmin to accompany her while the older generation began selling cars and houses to liquidate assets. They couldn’t sell the old residence, fearing it would attract too much attention, so they could only hope it would remain safe.

They decided which items were essential to keep and which could be discarded or sold. Over the next three days, Luo Bingtin was busier than ever. Even Meng Ge was sent out to buy supplies.

At this point, even Meng Ge, who was typically slow on the uptake, sensed something was off. After discreetly asking the young lady, he learned about the prophecy from their ancestors, which made him nod in understanding without further questions.

This revelation suggested that the young lady must have known about the prophecy beforehand, which explained her recent shopping spree to stockpile supplies. Feeling touched that she hadn’t hidden such significant news from him, Meng Ge became even more motivated to help.

Meanwhile, at the Mingzhu Building in the capital, the assistant hadn’t received any work assignments from the boss for several days, knowing that the boss was traveling the world. Decisions that could be made in meetings were discussed in person, and they couldn’t send emails any longer.

On this day, she finally received the boss’s latest work instructions. After reading it, she was stunned and quickly summoned the employees from the administrative and secretarial departments for a meeting. The email contained the following:

“The Myanmar gemstone gambling convention has yielded great fortune. The boss is traveling the world, and each employee will receive an extra month’s salary along with the settlement of half a year’s bonuses to celebrate the boss’s winnings. A two-week vacation starts now, so arrange your current tasks accordingly. The bonuses must be settled and distributed before the break begins, with the official holiday starting on the 18th. No personnel are to be scheduled during this time.”

All the employees erupted in cheers, praising their generous boss. Many took to social media, posting about their “godly boss” and “dream company,” all using similar keywords.

Luo Bingtin, amidst her busy schedule, also took time to consider her employees' futures. Unbeknownst to her, this operation was leaked online by her “foolish” relatives, and it became a trending topic. Suddenly, the internet was filled with envy for such a “godly boss” who possessed talent, looks, and luck, sharing their wealth while remembering their hardworking employees. Where could one find such a boss?

Netizens erupted in excitement, saying, “Working is impossible unless it’s for President Luo!”

“Is the boss hiring? I’d be willing to cling to her.”

Some even dug up videos of Luo Bingtin from before, wildly sharing and commenting, saying things like, “The young lady is beautiful and kind-hearted, rich and attractive, nearly perfect—except she’s not my boss.”

Various memes and jokes flooded the internet, causing Luo Bingtin’s stock prices to soar, and money flowed back into the company’s accounts.

Well, she had to admit that this time, Luo Bingtin had truly won big.

Realizing she was trending again, Luo Bingtin felt helpless. She couldn’t let anyone find out she was in Hangzhou; the current buzz made it easy for her to be targeted.

As for whether this would raise Fu Buqi’s suspicions, she didn’t have the time to consider. He likely knew about the apocalypse, given his meticulous planning in their past life; there was no way to explain that without addressing the end times. For now, she had to put those thoughts aside.

Sighing, she silently put on a mask, disguised herself as a company employee, and began contacting various distributors to procure supplies.

The Zheng family might not have much, but they had plenty of trucks and warehouses. Luo Bingtin intended to collect all the trucks before leaving. They wouldn’t fetch much if sold, but keeping them for future use would be beneficial.

The members of the Zheng family dared not defy Mr. Zheng’s orders. Besides purchasing rice, flour, and oil, Luo Bingtin also prioritized medical supplies. Since medical companies required contracts for bulk orders, she found it too much trouble and opted to negotiate directly with the sales staff to arrange private transactions.

Surprisingly, this approach proved efficient; her methods became more adept with each repetition. After finalizing all the purchases and sending the supplies to the Zheng family’s warehouse, Luo Bingtin instructed them to quietly return to the capital and to stay at the old residence, where they would be among their own. The outside world still believed she was abroad, and the Zheng family had no influence in the capital. As long as they didn’t travel with her, they would remain inconspicuous.
