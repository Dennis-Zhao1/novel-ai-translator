**No Trash Abilities**

After dinner, a few ability users were casually chatting, speculating on who would awaken first, what powers they would get, and their initial levels. What started as a light-hearted discussion gradually turned into a betting game, with stakes as low as a second or third-level crystal core or some snacks like cookies or tissues.

Lo Bingting didn’t stop this behavior; after all, a little gambling could lift spirits. The more people engaged, the stronger their sense of unity would be, and eventually, they would all become ability users, fighting side by side to protect the fortress.

No one expected the biggest gambler would be An Min. Always lively and eager to join in on the fun, he organized this betting pool. Lo Bingting secretly chuckled at the thought that he might end up losing all his money, but An Min just grinned, treating it like a welfare program. Though he joked about needing a little financial support if he lost too much, he still hinted that he didn’t want to end up with nothing.

Since Lo Bingting had a special advantage, he automatically withdrew from the betting. Dr. Zhang, Xiao Lu, and a few others were tasked with monitoring data, and they were prohibited from participating or sharing answers, leaving them with expressions of exasperation.

To everyone’s surprise, the first one to wake up was one of the two girls, a girl named Wang Xinxin. She had come to the fortress with her water-type ability user brother and had been helping in the kitchen. Just barely twenty, she was one of the early recipients of the awakening serum and had fallen into a feverish coma shortly after. It seemed those who passed out early might also wake up early.

The unexpected jackpot left everyone else feeling like losers, except for An Min, who was all smiles—at least he hadn’t lost everything. After bringing her out, he arranged for her to eat and wash up. After sleeping for a day and a night, Wang Xinxin felt sore all over, and the sweat she had worked up had a slightly sour smell. Embarrassed, she received a big bear hug from her goofy brother, who cheered her on before they started testing her abilities.

They used targets in the training room, and Wang Xinxin focused intently, raising her hand to unleash a shard of ice. Lo Bingting couldn't help but smile softly.

“Wow, it’s a mutated ability, just like Miss Lo’s! The awakening serum is amazing!”

“Seriously? A mutated ability? Oh man, the first one is a mutated ability. What if everyone who received the serum becomes a mutated ability user?”

“I have no idea... if that’s true, then...”

Dr. Zhang calmly recorded Wang Xinxin’s abilities and announced to everyone, “Wang Xinxin has awakened with a mutated ice-type ability at initial level two.”

Buzzing discussions erupted among the crowd. Some keen observers noticed the expressions of certain ability users darkening. In this apocalyptic world, strength reigned supreme, and the awakening serum had given ordinary people a head start over those who had awakened naturally. Some began to recall the words of Xie Jinghang, who had defected from the fortress.

Although some had seen Xie Jinghang return with Zhu Yidan once, they still believed the negotiations had failed. Xie Jinghang was truly someone who thought from the perspective of the ability users.

Inwardly, some felt a twinge of dissatisfaction towards Lo Bingting. However, family members of ordinary ability users didn’t share this sentiment, particularly Wang Xinxin's brother, who was practically in tears, clutching his sister’s hand and declaring that he would give all his crystal cores to her, proudly saying his sister was successful and had brought honor to the family.

Lo Bingting and the others observed these mixed emotions and states in silence, remaining impassive.

Those who had guessed wrong about the ability type began to lament, realizing their cookies and tissues would soon be scooped up by the grinning An Min.

Only a few who had correctly guessed the initial levels were in high spirits, feeling like they hadn’t lost too much.

The second to awaken was a boy who had just turned eighteen, a younger member of the Zhu family, though he didn’t actually bear the Zhu surname. Lo Bingting had seen him a few times at the family estate; he was the child of the Zhu family’s second aunt. The Zhu family was large, and he was the youngest left, following the death of his uncle’s son.

When the apocalypse first hit, he had just turned sixteen and hadn’t participated in any rescue missions with Lo Bingting and the others, so they weren’t very familiar with each other.

Upon waking, his second aunt burst into tears, hugging him tightly and repeatedly saying, “If your grandfather could see you, he would be so happy.”

This drew a wave of sentiment from the Zhu family members. After a normal wash-up and meal, they saw he looked quite spirited. They initially planned to test abilities once everyone had awakened, but Zhu Xiaoshu immediately insisted on testing him.

Coincidentally, he had also awakened a fire-type ability, marking the third fire-type user in the Zhu family.

Someone suddenly quipped, “Does the Zhu family have a genetic predisposition for fire abilities? Can abilities actually be inherited?”

Laughter erupted among the group at the absurdity of such a notion.

With the second awakening being another ordinary ability, the tension among the ability users eased slightly. It would be tough if they were all mutated ability users; that would be seriously discouraging.

As night fell, many returned to rest, but the families of the awakened were reluctant to miss witnessing their loved ones’ awakening moments and stubbornly remained below.

One by one, members of the guard team began to awaken. This time, not just one or two, but several awakened in quick succession. Lo Bingting instructed Aunt Li and the kitchen staff to prepare food and have it ready.

The captain of the guard awakened in the middle of the night, exchanging smiles with his teammates. The feeling of power was exhilarating.

After completing the process, he eagerly began to demonstrate his abilities. Most were ordinary elemental powers, but two additional metal-type abilities emerged, filling a gap in their team. The captain himself was an earth-type user and felt slightly let down; he had heard about a mutated ability user being a girl, and it seemed like discovering them also required some luck.

By four o'clock the next morning, half of the thirty awakened had come to, and Lo Bingting was feeling tired. He noticed Fu Kuandan showing signs of waking up next door. He quietly entered the room, standing by the bed and waiting for him to awaken.

The crystal cores really had formed well. In fact, Lo Bingting could tell at a glance what Fu Kuandan’s ability was; the colors made it easy to distinguish. Fu Kuandan had a wood-type ability, which was unfortunate since he had hoped for a more offensive power. Heaven had given him wood-type instead.

But it was still better than water-type; at least level three water-type users didn’t have an advantage in combat. Wood-type could at least entangle and restrict—better than nothing.

As Lo Bingting had expected, Fu Kuandan’s expression shifted from exhilaration upon discovering he was a level two wood-type ability user to deep disappointment, his mood changing faster than any woman’s.

His innate talent and physique were indeed lacking; he was even inferior to the girls in the fortress. However, with his identity and resources, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to improve. Fu Buqi would surely be willing to support his only son with abilities.

Lo Bingting wasn’t interested in comforting him; he suggested that Fu Kuandan take this opportunity to return to his residence or leave the fortress altogether, as the transaction was complete, and staying wouldn’t be beneficial.

Fu Kuandan seemed to ignore him entirely. Lo Bingting didn’t push him; if he wanted to stay, then let him. Without saying much, he turned to leave.

As he reached the door, he looked back and said, “There are no trash abilities, only trash ability users. Wood-type can also be very powerful.”

Fu Kuandan finally snapped out of his daze, watching Lo Bingting’s departing figure, lost in thought.

Is that really true? Can wood-type truly be powerful?
