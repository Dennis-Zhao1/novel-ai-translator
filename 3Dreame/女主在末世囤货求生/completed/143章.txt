**Strange Seeds**

The moment those words left her mouth, it sent Zhu Yidan into fits of laughter. Although she didn’t intentionally make any noise while getting up, the sound of her sitting up on the bed was certainly not loud enough to wake the dead. Clearly, this shameless person was just looking for trouble.

Zhu Yidan hesitated, caught between wanting to retaliate and holding back, when she caught sight of Little White Lotus glaring at her with two enormous dark circles under her eyes.

“How can you still laugh? You snored so loudly last night that you practically kept everyone awake! Do you even care about others’ sleep?” 

“You’re full of it! You were the one who snored! How would I know if you were sneaking around with someone last night? Just look at those dark circles you’re sporting. It’s obvious you’ve been indulging yourself too much, and now you’re blaming me! Ugh, how dare you!” 

Zhu Yidan’s expression was one of pure exasperation, but her words hit Little White Lotus right in her insecurities. In a fit of flustered anger, she shot back, “How dare you say that! You’ve been disturbing others and now you’re insulting me? I want to change dorms!”

Little White Lotus didn’t know if she was overreacting or genuinely at her wit's end. She stormed out, crying as she sought help from anyone who would listen. Zhu Yidan, unfazed, calmly changed her clothes and put on her shoes, grabbing her toiletries as she walked out, brushing her teeth while muttering curses about that filthy, black-hearted lotus. She wasn’t even worried about the bad breath she might be spreading.

When Little White Lotus learned that there were no spare rooms available for her to switch to, her gaze towards Zhu Yidan turned icy.

Not wanting to engage with her any further, Zhu Yidan followed Xie Jinghang and the ten selected individuals to the Awakening Observation Room. Little White Lotus wanted to tag along, but unfortunately, there were no spots left for her, and she had no authority to move around the fortress. Frustrated, she stomped her feet in anger.

Concerned about her appearance, Little White Lotus noticed that the men from Longxiang Base were giving her the cold shoulder. Giving up on maintaining her image, she let her hair fall loosely and went without makeup. Youth had its advantages—she didn’t need to put in much effort to look good.

Meanwhile, the vice-captain was leading the team in their routine training in the yard. After slowly finishing her tidying up, Little White Lotus sat under a large tree, watching. When Xie Jinghang and Zhu Yidan returned, they noticed that Little White Lotus had shifted her attention, now sweet-talking the vice-captain and being overly friendly.

Zhu Yidan nudged Xie Jinghang with her elbow, gesturing for him to take a look. “Look at that! She doesn’t want to sacrifice her own looks, so she’s sending her vice-captain to do it. What a move!”

Xie Jinghang simply chuckled and said nothing. That evening, the two of them had to guard the awakened individuals at Longxiang Base. After making an announcement in front of Little White Lotus, they left together again.

Later that night, as usual, Little White Lotus waited until everyone else was asleep before quietly leaving her room. With Zhu Yidan and Xie Jinghang both absent, she didn’t waste time lingering outside Xie Jinghang’s door like last time. Instead, she swiftly climbed out the window.

What she didn’t realize was that, at that very moment, several people hidden against the exterior wall had spotted her: Luo Bingtian, Xie Jinghang, An Min, and Zhu Yidan, with Meng Ge still on duty at the Awakening Observation Room. The four of them had already exhausted their resources dealing with Little White Lotus.

Once Little White Lotus returned to her room, Xie Jinghang and the others found the spot she had just been at. Luo Bingtian, curious, crouched down to take a look, only to be held back by Xie Jinghang’s large hand.

“Be careful; this thing is strange. Don’t touch it.”

Yesterday, he and the vice-captain had discovered something but hadn’t dared to handle it. After confirming its location, they returned. Luo Bingtian shrugged and pulled out a small trowel from her space pocket and threw it to Xie Jinghang.

“Dig it up; this way, you won’t be scared, right?”

The others were speechless. Scared? What was that about? Xie Jinghang expertly dug up the items that Little White Lotus had buried in the soil from both yesterday and today, while An Min used his wind abilities to clear away the dirt, revealing four dark, bean-like seeds.

Luo Bingtian quickly found a glass jar to store the four peculiar objects and then buried some similar beans back in the ground.

The group hurried to the ability observation room to find Dr. Zhang, presenting him with the items they had dug up.

Dr. Zhang wasn’t a botanist, but he had dealt with various peculiar specimens in biological research, so he had some knowledge of plants. He immediately raised the glass jar and inquired about the origin of the seeds. Upon learning that they might have been deliberately buried by an undercover agent, he became much more vigilant.

The other seeds were sealed for safekeeping, with one kept under a microscope for further examination. Luo Bingtian understood that there was a high probability they wouldn’t discover anything significant.

After studying the sample for a while, Dr. Zhang concluded, “These seeds are likely from mutated plants. They could either be vines or crops.”

“Why not find a wood-type ability user to try and stimulate it?” An Min suggested, but Xie Jinghang immediately stopped him.

Luo Bingtian and the others were surprised by his response as he continued, “What if it’s a gamble to see if you can successfully stimulate it? The fact that they went through the trouble of sending in a black-hearted lotus means this seed is extremely important.”

Dr. Zhang countered, “Then according to their plan, what could these seeds possibly do? What kind of destruction can they cause?”

“Let’s just try stimulating one and see what happens,” Zhu Yidan chimed in. She was also there for the awakening, and with the four of them as ability users, what was there to be afraid of?

Since everyone was eager to find out, An Min was sent to fetch a wood-type ability user. In the middle of the night, the group waited in the laboratory, and soon after, An Min returned with one of Meng Ge’s subordinates who had wood abilities.

The level three wood ability user struggled to stimulate the seed, and after almost exhausting his mental energy, a small sprout emerged, but it appeared unhealthy, a sickly yellow that made it look inferior compared to any bean sprout before the apocalypse.

Just as he withdrew his hand, the sprout began to change color dramatically, as if it had caught a whiff of something enticing. Once it turned a deep green, it shot up rapidly, growing to the length of a human arm.

Dr. Zhang began to closely observe it while asking An Min to take notes. However, when his hand brushed the tip of the sprout’s leaves, the entire plant suddenly took on an aggressive stance, as if it would lunge for Dr. Zhang’s eyes. Luo Bingtian swiftly grabbed it, and the plant writhed violently in her grip, as if it were alive.

With ice abilities covering her hands, Luo Bingtian wasn’t afraid of the suddenly thorny plant and held on tightly.

Dr. Zhang instructed her to loosen her grip so she wouldn’t kill the specimen while he diligently recorded his findings.

After a brief period, Dr. Zhang reached his initial conclusion: “This plant has a robust root system like wild grass, and after mutation, its leaves are sharp and capable of climbing. It exhibits aggressive behavior.”

He then made a small cut in the sturdy root of the vine. The plant recoiled sharply, immediately reverting to an aggressive stance, and Dr. Zhang quickly trapped it in a glass container.

Inside the covered plant, it thrashed around wildly, appearing restless. The group was taken aback; could this plant have sentience?

Dr. Zhang had the wood ability user attempt to control it, finding it somewhat effective. However, each time it interacted with wood abilities, the plant’s size increased. When it grew too large for the container, they decided to destroy it.

After the wood ability user stopped, Luo Bingtian froze the plant solid with her ice powers. A firm shove shattered it into tiny chunks that scattered across the floor.

To their surprise, after thawing, the fragments of the plant’s roots began to grow rapidly, splitting into numerous small plants. The rate of reproduction was faster than printing money.

An Min, initially intending to use wind abilities to clean up the mess, inadvertently provided the ideal growth environment for the plants.

They had no choice but to burn everything to ash to resolve the situation. The remaining three seeds were safely collected by Luo Bingtian, and she exchanged a knowing glance with Xie Jinghang, both realizing they had a much clearer understanding of Little White Lotus’s intentions for sneaking in.
