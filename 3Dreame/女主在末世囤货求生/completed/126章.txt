**Chapter 1: A Twist of Fate**

“I'm dying of filial piety here,” Adam Song remarked dryly, observing the heavy silence that had settled among his companions. With a hint of bravado, he continued, “My dad has several strongholds. Should I mark them on a map for you?"

“Wow, very filial of you, truly,” someone muttered under their breath, trying to break the tension.

Adam elaborated, his tone taking on a serious note. “My father is extremely suspicious—probably because he’s done a lot of morally questionable things, which makes him feel guilty. He trusts no one. After my older brother's death, he became even more paranoid. Now he’s into biochemical warfare, and I’m genuinely worried you guys might not be able to handle him.”

Serena Zhou let out a light laugh, clearly unimpressed. “So you’re scared we can’t take him down, yet you still come to us for help? That doesn’t add up.”

Adam was momentarily stumped by her words. He chuckled awkwardly, trying to regain his composure. “Well, the only ones capable of dealing with him are you guys. I know Big Boss Pei from the Longxiang Base hates my dad as well, but he doesn’t have the same strength you all possess.”

“That sounds like a backhanded compliment,” she said, rolling her eyes. “But seriously, why do you hate your father so much?”

This question had been on Serena’s mind for a while. She remembered seeing Adam trying to impress his dad at the Kunshan Base, acting all sweet and eager for approval. Yet here he was, speaking of him with such venom. It didn’t make sense.

Adam’s demeanor shifted as he lowered his gaze, the atmosphere growing heavier. After a long pause, he finally responded, “That bastard killed my mom and my grandpa. He ignored me my whole life. My brother and I were raised by my mom, but after my brother learned how to navigate social situations, Dad took him out for work to save face. I was left at home with Mom. I never thought he’d go so far as to sacrifice his own wife for a mistress, all while pretending to be the grieving husband. It’s disgusting.”

From what they knew, Adam’s father, Buqi, had entered the Kunshan Base with his family. Serena recalled meeting his wife in a past life, who later died from illness. To think the culprit was Adam’s own father was shocking. Was it really for some woman? That was ruthless.

Adam’s underlying resentment toward his father’s favoritism was palpable. A dysfunctional family dynamic and the absence of paternal love could definitely explain his brooding nature. 

Watching him, Zhi Yidan felt a mix of sympathy and sorrow, while Serena couldn’t help but feel a slight ache in her eyes. Thankfully, she knew Zhi wasn’t the type to fall for brooding boys—she was simply drawn to Adam's dark charisma. What a strange taste!

After silently critiquing her friend’s choice in men, Serena turned to Xie Jinghang, raising an eyebrow as if to ask for his opinion.

Xie tilted his head, a smirk playing at the corner of his lips. Serena nodded in understanding.

Oblivious to their silent exchange, Zhi's emotions were a whirlwind. Were these two flirting? Whatever, it was none of her business—she found the broody boy intriguing.

“Do you want your father dead, or do you just want to stop him from harming others?” Xie asked, cutting straight to the heart of the matter.

Adam was still lost in his thoughts, and without thinking, he replied, “He should die. He deserves it.”

Realizing what he had just said, he fumbled with his words, but it was too late. Serena could see this was the raw truth of his feelings. Good. It was about time he felt the sting of betrayal from his own son—this was going to be interesting.

Coming back to reality, Adam dropped the pretense of being sincere. Having already let his true feelings slip, he decided to let go of the facade. “That old man thinks he’s clever just because he’s smart and has a silver tongue. He’s been eyeing my brother's intended since my brother's death. What a joke!”

“And the women around him? They come and go like it’s a revolving door. My mom literally died from the stress of his infidelities.”

“He's terrified of death yet keeps expanding his strongholds. His subordinates are dwindling, and he’s living in fear, jumping at every little noise. I can’t even find him half the time.”

“Now he’s started a cult, claiming to be a savior, spouting nonsense about how the apocalypse is humanity’s punishment for abusing animals and destroying nature. He says we need to repent and redeem ourselves, brainwashing people into becoming his mindless puppets—monsters that kill for him.”

With each word, Adam’s voice grew more animated, and his eyes glistened with unshed tears. “Do you know what he’s doing? He’s convincing those people to undergo enhancement procedures, telling them the pain will be reduced to just five percent of what it should be, and their abilities will increase by at least one level. But the truth is, the serum is derived from the bodies of zombies. Normal people don’t stand a chance after being injected.”

Seizing the moment, Serena asked, “What exactly does he extract from zombies? Blood?”

“Not just blood. There are also brains and cores. I don’t know all the details, but I’ve heard him say that any brains that look ‘old’ aren’t worth using. It’s disgusting.”

Serena’s mind raced as she pieced it all together. Zombies could upgrade by consuming other zombies' cores, while humans needed to absorb a significant amount to barely level up. Adam’s father had exploited this by turning ability users into half-human, half-zombie hybrids before having them consume cores to level up.

Now that was a loophole! It was hard to believe he managed to come up with such a twisted plan.

“I’ve told you everything I know, even my dad’s deepest secret. Do you believe I’m being genuine?” Adam asked, looking at them hopefully.

Serena nodded instinctively. This son genuinely wanted his father dead. How ironic, yet commendable.

“I’m so glad you trust me! I’m willing to share any intel you need. Just ask!” Adam’s excitement was palpable, but then he hesitated, trailing off mid-sentence.

Serena noticed he was slipping back into his act, and she massaged her temples in frustration. Fine, if he wanted to play the game, she’d let him.

With three pairs of eyes glued to him, they were all eager to hear what he would reveal next. Adam chuckled awkwardly, as if steeling himself for what he was about to say. “I... I want to inject the ability awakening serum. I want to get stronger. I want to be alive when my dad dies.”

The last words came out tight-lipped, as if he was forcing them out. 

Ah, the little fox had revealed his tail. So that’s what this roundabout conversation was about. Serena was actually relieved; she needed a test subject for the serum. The timing couldn’t have been more perfect.

However, she put on a troubled expression, pretending to ponder. “You want me to inject you? That’s quite a risk.”

Realizing the gravity of his situation, Adam understood he needed to deliver a solid counteroffer. After all, the last two attacks on the Kunshan Base had left many casualties, and the second wave had left no survivors. They couldn’t afford to take any chances.

“My dad has a secret that nobody knows. In exchange for the serum, I’ll tell you.”

Serena and Xie exchanged glances, eyebrows raised in curiosity. Adam, however, was looking at Zhi, who seemed oblivious to the tension. She finally caught on and quickly excused herself, shutting the door behind her.

The remaining trio exchanged glances as Adam swallowed hard. “My dad has something really sinister inside him. My mom once thought he was possessed. Do you know the zombie virus? He created it. He’s the root cause of this apocalypse, bringing disaster to humanity. His ultimate goal is to turn everyone into zombies. So when I say killing him would save humanity, I’m not lying. As long as he lives, everyone is in danger.”
