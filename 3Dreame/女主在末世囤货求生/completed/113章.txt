**Internal Strife**

After the conversation wrapped up, Luo Bingtin watched as the doctor injected the remaining two vials of the special medicine into the IV bag. Pei Qian was already seated by the hospital bed, holding Pei Shang’s hand while keeping her company. Not wanting to linger as a third wheel, Luo Bingtin and her companion quietly exited the hospital room.

As they walked down the dimly lit staircase, illuminated only by flickering torches, Xie Jinghang thought about asking Luo Bingtin how she had recovered, what had really happened. Yet, he held back, deciding it was better not to pry too much; if she wanted to share, she would do so in her own time.

Meanwhile, Luo Bingtin felt utterly exhausted from the day’s events. The struggle within her consciousness had drained her, and all she could think about was getting back to her room and sleeping. The two walked in silence until they reached their quarters. After exchanging greetings with Meng Ge and the others, Luo Bingtin collapsed onto her bed, eager for rest.

The next day, rejuvenated and full of energy, Luo Bingtin took two bottles of duck bathing water upstairs for Pei Qian. It was essential to strengthen alliances, and given Pei Qian’s character—one who would repay kindness with loyalty and vendetta with vengeance—she believed that extending a hand now would fortify their relationship for future confrontations. After all, if they had to face enemies, it was better to have them firmly on her side.

At that moment, it was apparent that Pei Shang's complexion had significantly improved. What had once been a pale and gaunt face now had a hint of color, a delicate blush that caught Luo Bingtin by surprise. She marveled at the lake’s miraculous properties, which had restored Pei Shang overnight. The thought crossed her mind to take a dip herself for health benefits, but she quickly dismissed the idea, realizing that she might end up drinking her own bathwater if she did.

After checking on Pei Shang, Pei Qian summoned his trusted subordinates to strategize with Luo Bingtin and her group. They focused on the report regarding Fu Buqi, an ability user who had fled the safe house with his woman as chaos erupted the previous night. His escape had been swift and deliberate.

Just as they were deep in discussion, a sudden wave of internal conflict erupted at the Longxiang Base. Lower-tier ability users formed an unexpected alliance and launched an attack. The meeting room, filled with Pei Qian's closest aides, reacted instantaneously. Some ordinary individuals even found the courage to confront ability users, pointing their weapons at former comrades-in-arms. Pei Qian maintained a calm demeanor, as if nothing was amiss.

He understood that Fu Buqi was a formidable opponent, but he had not anticipated that within just a few days of arriving at the Longxiang Base, his own foundation would crumble so dramatically. It was evident that Fu Buqi was a master manipulator. However, was it truly only in these few days? Memories of his and Pei Shang’s own awakening and the subsequent attacks crept into his mind—doubt began to take root and spread.

Luo Bingtin observed the swiftly escalating conflict and gasped, whispering to Xie Jinghang, "Didn’t you say the Longxiang Base was solid as a rock? How did we end up with two internal conflicts so quickly?"

Xie Jinghang simply smiled without replying. He observed the faces in the meeting room, noting that none seemed perturbed; they all appeared well-prepared, waiting for an opportunity to rid themselves of hidden threats and traitors.

Having witnessed similar events at the Kunshan Base, Luo Bingtin quickly grasped the situation. She settled in, ready to watch the unfolding drama, even taking a moment to assess the abilities of Pei Qian's subordinates. The internal strife was surprisingly brief and one-sided. The outcome was clear: some rebels lay dead, while others were captured and bound by Pei Qian’s loyalists. Pei Qian surveyed the kneeling dissenters with the same disdain one might afford to insects, uninterested in the bribes Fu Buqi might have offered them. His gaze fixed on the apparent leader among the rebels, whose defiant expression only fueled Pei Qian's impatience. With a cold smirk, he declared, “Execute them all. Extract their crystals and toss them out.”

Cries for mercy echoed, yet Pei Qian's expression remained unchanged. As pleas fell on deaf ears, the atmosphere thickened with a chilling silence, and soon, the only sounds left were the terrified whimpers of those who had not participated in the revolt. The fear was palpable, but mingled with it was a sense of admiration; decisiveness in leadership was vital in this apocalyptic setting.

Pei Qian addressed the crowd firmly, “Anyone dissatisfied with my leadership is free to leave the Longxiang Base. No one will stop you or make things difficult for you. If you wish to challenge me, do so openly instead of behaving like rats in the sewers, ambushing and pretending to be loyal.”

He then brandished a crystal extracted from a rebel, causing some attendees to tremble uncontrollably. “This is the fate of traitors. Next time, the execution will not be so swift.”

His icy gaze swept across the room, and no one dared to meet his eyes. A few guilty individuals had already lowered their heads deeply, understanding that by eliminating this batch of hidden threats, the Longxiang Base would only become more fortified moving forward.

Meanwhile, Luo Bingtin observed Pei Qian's show of intimidation, contemplating whether brandishing a crystal or displaying a corpse was more impactful.

After hastily concluding the interrupted meeting, Pei Qian rushed out, leaving Li Si, Anna, and Luo Bingtin to finalize the remaining details.

Without lingering at the Longxiang Base for too long, Pei Shang’s condition improved steadily, and her recovery was merely a matter of time. With Pei Qian and the others now wary of Fu Buqi and harboring a deep grudge, future encounters would not be cooperative, even if they didn’t end in death.

Once communication methods were established and future plans laid out, Luo Bingtin felt pleased with the successful expedition. She had gained both allies and the activation of her psychic abilities.

It was a double blessing, and she found herself yearning to drive home, enjoying hot pot and singing along to her favorite tunes.

Suddenly, she remembered her earlier intention to visit the old family home. She instructed Meng Ge and the others to return to the fortress while she drove to the old house.

Xie Jinghang and the others did not pry about her destination, only cautioning her to be wary of the hooded zombies, especially since she had been attacked again the previous night. Luo Bingtin was confident that her psychic abilities could handle the grotesque creature; if she did encounter it, that would be even better. She genuinely needed the psychic crystals for nourishment and enhancement.

As she insisted on heading out alone, waving cheerfully to her friends, they watched her drive away.

Luo Bingtin hummed a tune, feeling good as she made her way back to the old house, only to find herself confronted by unexpected visitors. Her smile vanished immediately.

Fu Buqi had audacity, sending his men to occupy her family home—was he turning the Luo family estate into his base?

This was outrageous!

Seeing Fu Buqi’s men patrolling near the old home, including the golden mover, Brother Luo, and his gang of lackeys, Luo Bingtin's mood soured. How had he survived the explosion at Fenglin Villa? He was a disaster that just wouldn’t go away.

If this had happened anywhere else, she would have blasted him on sight, but she couldn’t risk damaging her ancestral home.

Now, as a dual-ability level four powerhouse, she was not afraid of the hooded zombies. In fact, it would be an excellent opportunity to confront one directly. Driving boldly past, she summoned an ice spike, catching Brother Luo completely off guard. He had thought she was a lone ability user, but before he could even identify her, he and his lackeys were taken down.

The swift and brutal execution did nothing to quell Luo Bingtin's fury. She drove straight to the entrance of her old home, her psychic energy sweeping around like infrared imaging, revealing all the living beings inside and out.

After parking and stowing her car in her space, she wasted no time as an ability user rushed out from the gate. In a flash, she sent several ice spikes flying, and he collapsed instantly. The remaining ability users, witnessing their comrade’s sudden demise before they could even act, turned tail and fled in terror.
