**Cover-Up and Concealment**

Zhuo San looked at the two with a puzzled expression. “You say you saw who stealing?”

“It was them!” Zhu Wu Ming, who had just been slapped, stubbornly pointed at Luo Bingting. “Those two were sneaking around our warehouse in the middle of the night, moving supplies. When we caught them, they wouldn’t admit it and even assaulted my brother, forcing me to kneel and slapping me!”

Xie Jingheng continued to apply pressure with his foot, causing the man beneath him to scream in agony. “Zhuo San! Zhuo San! I’m your Uncle Wu Xing! Please help me!”

As the other Zhu family members moved to assist, Luo Bingting swiftly drew the Tang knife from Xie Jingheng’s waist, placing the blade against Zhu Wu Ming’s neck with a smile that seemed laced with poison.

“Come on, say that again. Speak nicely.”

“What are you doing? Are you enraged and planning to use the knife? You’re beating people and slandering us, and now you want to kill to silence us?” Zhu Wu Ming stared at the cold gleam of the blade on his neck, nearly wetting himself, and desperately signaled to Zhuo San.

Zhuo San was equally embarrassed. On one hand, he had teammates he trained with and went on missions to save people, and on the other hand, he had family members, even if they were distant relatives.

Seeing their expressions, Luo Bingting suddenly sheathed the knife, handing it back to Xie Jingheng, and smiled at Zhuo San. “Oh, look at me, there’s no need for such trouble. Here, let me show you something interesting.”

Luo Bingting gave Xie Jingheng a glance, who kept the knife unsheathed, blocking Zhu Wu Ming’s path while standing on the wailing Wu Xing. The six members of the patrol team gathered around Luo Bingting as she opened her phone’s photo gallery and played a video—one without any beauty filters, background music, or edits.

The video was brief, just a few minutes long, showing the two Zhu brothers shouting to be released and claiming they were wronged. Zhuo San’s face turned ashen as he glared at them. This was truly embarrassing for the Zhu family.

Luo Bingting added mockingly, “Oh, I forgot to mention, I don’t need to steal anything.”

Everyone was momentarily stunned. Some quick thinkers immediately suspected that Luo Bingting must have stockpiled supplies privately or received a generous stash from her grandfather. But unexpectedly, she raised her chin and declared, “Everything in this entire warehouse belongs to me.”

Of course, few believed her. They had been living there for so long and had never heard of such a thing.

Then, Luo Bingting turned her tone to ridicule and said to Zhu Wu Ming, “I thought you knew it was mine and came to steal it. Turns out, you had no idea? Taking what belongs to your own family? Does Grandpa Zhu know about this?”

The two Zhu brothers were completely stunned.

Though Zhuo San wasn’t as cunning as Zhu Xiaosu, he could still see the obvious truth. He immediately ordered the patrol team to restrain the two and lock them in the security team’s office. Other patrol members took the keys to the warehouse from them and locked the stolen goods in a nearby room.

Luo Bingting felt miserable, but she was somewhat comforted that none of her people from the Luo family, Zheng family, or Xie Jingheng were present. This made her more accepting of the situation.

It was too late to disturb Grandpa Zhu’s rest, so the next day, Zhuo San reported the incident while Luo Bingting slept in late, reluctant to get up. It wasn’t until noon, when the old housekeeper coaxed her out of bed for a meal, that she realized something was off. When she arrived at the cafeteria, Aunt Li had set aside a warm plate of food for her. It reminded her of yesterday’s events, which still had no resolution.

She wouldn’t let that ruin her meal. After eating and joking with Aunt Li and the old housekeepers, she bundled her down jacket and headed toward the office building.

The indoor heating made the outside cold even more pronounced, and she hurried into the office building. Upon reaching the security team’s office, she found it empty, even though she had seen them lock the two men in the day before.

Luo Bingting was a bit confused and was about to go upstairs to find Zhu Xiaosu when the security team leader came down the stairs and blocked her way.

“Little Luo, just the person I needed to see. Let’s talk in our office.”

Luo Bingting was just about to ask about the two thieves and followed him into the office. Unexpectedly, the security team leader didn’t sit in the sofa area but rather behind the desk in the boss’s chair.

What does this mean? Luo Bingting, puzzled, didn’t take a seat but leaned against the door frame, raising her eyelids to look at him.

He assumed an official demeanor, sipping his tea and beckoning her, “Little Luo, don’t stand there. Come in and sit down.”

He was pointing to the chair across from the desk. After having been a boss for a few years, Luo Bingting understood the underlying message. This was an attempt to put her in her place. Ignoring him, she walked straight to the sofa area, chose a prominent single sofa, and sat down gracefully.

So, he wants to play power games, huh? Who doesn’t know how to do that?

This security team leader was from the third branch of the Zhu family, the son of Grandpa Zhu's younger brother. He had been calling Zhu Chuang “Uncle” for decades. Usually, he didn’t have any remarkable achievements, nor was he particularly capable. Originally, the position of security team leader should have been filled by Grandpa Zhu's son, who had a military background. However, due to health issues in recent months, the position was given to this third branch brother.

Luo Bingting was aware that the Zhu family was large, and due to varying degrees of closeness, there would inevitably be some internal maneuvering. She could overlook these dynamics as long as they didn’t affect her interests.

However, her interests were clearly being compromised, and now they were pulling this stunt on her? They were dreaming.

Luo Bingting crossed her arms, curious about what tricks they were planning.

“Hey, Little Luo, why aren’t you coming over to sit? Don’t be so distant with your Uncle Zhu.”

“Team Leader Zhu, this spot is just fine. The room isn’t big, so if you have something to say, just say it.”

The security team leader’s face fell, his previously composed expression now clearly upset.

Luo Bingting couldn’t care less about his feelings. Nestled in the sofa, one hand propping up her face, she crossed her legs and looked at him as if to say, “If you have something to say, hurry up.”

“Little Luo, about last night’s incident, it was all a misunderstanding. I looked into it and wanted to let you know that everyone was sent home this morning. You shouldn’t pursue what happened with them. Your uncle has something to say: how could you lock up your two uncles for a whole night? That’s really not showing consideration for your elders.”

His lengthy lecture wiped out Luo Bingting’s previously cheerful mood in an instant. How could someone be so oblivious to her perspective?

Luo Bingting stood up, turning to leave without a backward glance. She directly went upstairs and knocked on Zhu Xiaosu’s office door, while the security team leader followed her, trying to persuade her.

“Little Luo, everything has been resolved. What’s the point in looking for him? After all, there’s no loss, and we should all learn to tolerate each other while living together. It’s all just a misunderstanding.”

She knocked for a long time without anyone answering. Zhu Xiaosu seemed to be away, and Luo Bingting’s patience was wearing thin.

“Do you think saying it’s a misunderstanding makes it a misunderstanding? Were you even there yesterday? Did I confront those two face to face? Don’t you know I have video evidence of them stealing? The entire patrol team witnessed it, and you didn’t even ask a single question!”

Her rapid-fire questions left the security team leader speechless.

Giving up on knocking, Luo Bingting headed back down, planning to find Zhu Xiaosu in the biology lab. The security team leader followed closely behind. When they reached the office door, he exchanged glances, and suddenly, patrol team members appeared at the entrance, blocking her way.

During the lunch break, everyone in the administrative part of the office building had gone out to eat and rest, and wouldn’t return until two in the afternoon. The security team leader had taken advantage of this moment when no one was around to arrange for his people to control Luo Bingting, claiming it was to help her calm down.

As for what to do after controlling her, he hadn’t thought that far ahead. He had only promised the fifth branch’s brothers that he would help smooth things over.

Seeing this setup, Luo Bingting realized they intended to silence her, and perhaps even wanted to eliminate her altogether.
