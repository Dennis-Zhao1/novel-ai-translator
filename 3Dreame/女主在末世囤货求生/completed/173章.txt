**Hidden Motives**

Anmin assessed the situation and figured they would need a few more bags. He decided to ask Luobingting for some lime; this stuff was plentiful and always available when needed. 

After dumping seven or eight bags—several dozen pounds—of lime, it quickly started to work its magic. The worms noticeably shrank in size, their colors darkening gradually until they stopped moving altogether. 

"It worked!" Anmin exclaimed, a wave of relief washing over him. The disgusting worms had been dealt with, leaving behind only the gooey remnants that had fallen from the ceiling. Thanks to the lime, what was once a messy, corrosive slime had transformed into piles of yellow-black mush. 

He stepped into the muck a couple of times, noting that it no longer posed any danger, although the color was still a cause for concern. 

Now they were genuinely safe. Luobingting called for the others to join her and see if they could lock the zombies out. The door on the third floor was a reinforced iron one; it might just hold them back for a while, giving everyone a chance to catch their breath. 

Once gathered on the third floor, they swiftly closed the door behind them and made their way to the fire escape leading to the fourth floor.

"System, did you see that? She has spatial abilities; it was her all along!" Fu Buqi gritted his teeth, his hands clenched into fists. It made sense now—he had attacked several of his rival factions, thinking they’d conspired against him, and even lost a few of his close connections. The true instigator was someone he had underestimated: a woman he hadn’t deemed a threat at all. 

He had long suspected Xie Jinghang. In hindsight, it was clear; if she wasn’t after resources, there was no reason for someone like him—a man capable of being a leader in this apocalypse—to hide out in a fortified shelter. 

And those strange weapons they had? Where did they come from? 

He tried to question the system, but it seemed particularly irritable, and he didn't want to provoke it further. 

On the fire escape from the third to the fourth floor, the group finally had a moment to breathe, especially Luo Fan and Zhu Yidan. Their fingers were stiff from gripping their guns for so long. The adrenaline that had kept them alert was now fading, leaving them in a daze, as if they had just released an arrow that had been drawn back too long.

Luobingting wasn’t one to just offer empty encouragement. She asked them outright what they wanted to drink or eat. Anmin, having just faced such revolting creatures, had no appetite and shook his head. Xie Jinghang, on the other hand, requested a soda—specifically, an ice-cold one. Anmin’s eyes lit up; this was a rare treat! 

In the fortress, they often only had things like sour plum soup or mung bean soup, and it had been ages since he had a soda. Even when they did have them, they were usually expired. 

Without a moment's hesitation, Xie Jinghang opened a can and took a big gulp, satisfied enough to let out a burp. The others were tempted, and soon everyone was asking for their own ice-cold sodas. 

Luobingting casually held the soda can, chilling it in seconds. As they sipped the fizzy drinks, joy bubbled up among them. 

After finishing his soda, Xie Jinghang crushed the can in his fist and made a food request. "I want a burrito, the kind with chili oil!"

Luobingting responded promptly, pulling out a massive burrito she had stashed away from a popular food street near a well-known university. The place had been around for hundreds of years, run by the founder's daughter, now in her fifties or sixties. Every time she prepared the burritos, she would ask, “Is that enough, dear?” The burritos were larger than a person's face, incredibly satisfying to eat.

Having tasted it once, Luobingting had remembered the flavor, so she had stocked up on hundreds of these treats to change things up. Eating high-end ingredients all the time could get boring, and a little variety was welcome.

Anmin’s eyes lit up at the sight of the burrito, and Luo Fan looked at her with eager eyes, akin to a puppy waiting to be fed. Luobingting handed out one burrito, wanting to mimic the lady’s voice when she asked, “Is that enough, dear?”

Zhu Yidan couldn’t finish such a large burrito and opted for a packed meal instead. She was pleasantly surprised to find it was from the private kitchen they used to order from frequently. The taste made her teary-eyed with nostalgia. 

Anmin was a big guy with a hearty appetite, and he had never gone hungry since arriving at the fortress. After finishing the giant burrito, he stared longingly at Zhu Yidan’s box. 

Luobingting couldn’t stand to see him like that; she disdainfully handed him an identical meal. Anmin cheered, tearing open the disposable chopsticks and eagerly digging in. 

As he ate, he exclaimed how delicious it was. Li Aunty’s cooking had a solid reputation; everyone who had tasted it praised her skills. Under her leadership, the cafeteria had a different specialty dish every day. Since their relocation, however, they had been eating more basic meals, which made this takeout taste even better.

Xie Jinghang and Luo Fan were both aware of when to stop. Xie Jinghang thought more critically; if he overindulged now, he might end up vomiting at the sight of something even more disgusting later.

Seeing Anmin enjoy his meal reassured Zhu Yidan, and the two of them ate in tandem. Meanwhile, Luobingting had already popped open a few pieces of chocolate. She was still a bit grossed out and didn’t feel like having a full meal; just a quick energy boost would do.

Before long, they had finished eating and resting. With Xie Jinghang leading the way, the group continued their ascent. Luobingting found herself lost in thoughts, recalling the early days of her rebirth. Back then, she had been in the biology building, navigating the same fire escape, terrified and powerless, lacking any abilities or the courage to fire a gun. Even when faced with the weakest zombies, she had avoided confrontation. Now, however, she was not only facing them head-on but also aiming to break them apart. 

The door on the third floor couldn’t hold out for long; zombies began to swarm again as if they were endless. Luckily, having satisfied their hunger and thirst had lightened their spirits, and they were ready to work. Luo Fan continued to combine his left and right-handed shooting skills, while Anmin and Zhu Yidan were more casual with their aim. The beauty of air guns is that they can shoot freely, and every shot had explosive damage.

Perhaps anger fueled him, but Fu Buqi had stopped monitoring Luobingting and her group through the system. He had missed their hearty meal. The system, in its mind, scoffed at this host; if it weren’t for the prerequisites for unbinding, it would have switched hosts long ago. 

The so-called protagonist aura was nothing but a scam for systems like it—here it was, falling into its own trap. 

Neither side noticed that Luobingting and her friends had climbed several floors, and their time taken was significantly decreasing. 

The system was busy operating, while Fu Buqi focused intently on cleaning his gun, each harboring their own thoughts.

“Let’s take a break; I’m exhausted. I need a drink,” Anmin said as he rolled and crawled up to the sixth floor. He found a safe office, locked the door behind him, and half-collapsed onto the ground. Zhu Yidan gently nudged his calf with her toe, signaling him to make some room. Anmin was too tired to move much, just shaking his foot lazily in acknowledgment. 

Luobingting observed their interaction with mild amusement. 

She handed each of them a drink to replenish their energy, took a sip herself, and then noticed Xie Jinghang pushing the door open, seemingly having spotted something. 

After a moment’s pause, Luobingting followed him, curious about what he had discovered. Just as she was about to stride forward, Xie Jinghang suddenly called out, “Don’t come any closer, take a few steps back!”
