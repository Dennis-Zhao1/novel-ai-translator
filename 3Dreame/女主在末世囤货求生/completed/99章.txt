**Alternate Dining**

Ever since Adam Song had a few meals in the space, he developed a habit of dropping by for free food. But he never came empty-handed; he always traded some crystal nuclei in exchange.

One day, Adam knocked on Serena Zhou's door but didn’t wait for an invitation. He strode right in, his long legs carrying him straight to the couch. As soon as he sat down, he rattled off a list of dishes that sounded more like a stand-up comedy routine than an order.

Serena raised an eyebrow, utterly speechless. Before she could even think about kicking him out, a bag of crystal nuclei appeared in her hands. She opened it to find that they were all ice-type nuclei. At that moment, she couldn't bring herself to refuse him; after all, ice-type zombies were rare, and gathering this many meant he must have taken down a significant number.

Gripping the bag of nuclei, Serena forced a smile, her expression strained. "Could you repeat that? You went too fast; I didn’t catch it all."

Adam shrugged and repeated his order without missing a beat. As he listed the dishes, Serena started rummaging through her stash. 

In no time, they had laid out a spread that would make anyone’s mouth water: roasted leg of lamb, spicy hot pot, grilled fish, fried noodles with sauce, fizzy soda, bubble tea, and dark beer.

If it weren't for the crystal nuclei, Serena wouldn't have bothered playing along with his antics.

Adam pulled out his portable cutlery from his pocket and started digging in without so much as a word of thanks. He looked like he was thoroughly enjoying the food, which made Serena's stomach grumble in response. She pulled out some grilled cold noodles to join in.

As she ate, she felt grateful for the ample snacks and takeout she had hoarded before the apocalypse. Otherwise, Adam's feast would have left her feeling deprived.

Noticing her munching on the cold noodles, Adam urged her to join him in the feast. "Come on, don’t be shy. Eat up!"

Serena rolled her eyes internally—who was he to tell her to be polite? This was all her stash, after all! Though she grumbled to herself, her chopsticks found their way to the spicy hot pot. Just as she was about to take a bite, a piece of roasted lamb was placed in her bowl, its rich aroma of cumin and chili powder wafting up to her nose. She glanced over at Adam, who was focused on his fried noodles, seemingly oblivious to her expression.

During their meal, he insisted on trying her cold noodles, and with a resigned sigh, she let him take a bite. Most of the time, he was the one piling food into her bowl—grilled fish, shrimp, and the spicy hot pot’s tender cuts. He even poured her a glass of beer, insisting they toast to their friendship.

Could he just eat quietly for once?

Before long, Serena had eaten until she felt stuffed, leaning back on the couch with a satisfied sigh. She wasn’t quite sure what game Adam was playing; why couldn’t he just let her grab whatever she wanted? But the food was undeniably delicious.

Adam quickly cleaned up the mess, dutifully packing away the wrappers and sealing the trash bag. Then he plopped down on the other couch, holding a can of soda, looking utterly relaxed.

Once he finished his drink, he knew it was time to leave. Without waiting for Serena to kick him out, he grabbed the trash bag and the untouched bubble tea, heading for the door.

Serena sank deeper into the couch, watching the door close behind him, shaking her head in confusion. She really didn’t understand what was going through that guy's mind.

Thankfully, Adam’s visits weren't too frequent, maybe a few times a month. Even if some folks in the stronghold joked about Captain Song being pampered, it was all in good fun.

One day, Serena shared her wild theory with Adam about him being sponsored. He fell silent for a moment before nodding. Surprisingly, he had his suspicions too, especially since that pesky system had failed to detect anything unusual about Fu Boqi. It made him feel like the system was a useless burden.

A system that only dragged its feet was exhausting to deal with.

That explained why every time Fu Boqi encountered a problem, it triggered a new crisis; the timeline of events always seemed to get pushed forward.

Once they pieced that together, the remaining question was where Fu Boqi was hiding. Apart from hastening crises, what other abilities did his system have? 

Both of them were prepared for a long fight ahead, but at the very least, they could cut off his resources and isolate him. An isolated enemy was far easier to eliminate.

Serena had her own network gathering intelligence while Adam had connections within the Kunshan base, which might provide valuable information. As for the bounty on Adam's head, nobody cared. He was already among the highest-ranking ability users, while Serena was still striving to reach Level Four. By the time she was pushing to Level Four, Adam had already achieved it.

Even the Kunshan base had no Level Four ability users, though they maintained an average level around Level Three.

The ability users in the apocalypse stronghold had faced losses and worked hard to improve. Under the leadership of Serena, Adam, and their team, they actively hunted zombies to gather crystal nuclei, and research in the lab was showing new advancements.

However, they still faced challenges. After studying the differences between zombies and ability users, they confirmed that zombie crystal nuclei could naturally upgrade themselves or absorb weaker nuclei from other zombies to upgrade without needing any corresponding ability attributes. In contrast, ability users could only absorb nuclei tied to their specific attributes, and they needed a significant amount before they could level up.

The conditions for leveling up were unpredictable; some users would upgrade after recovering from severe injuries, others after battles, while some, like Serena and Adam, relied on spatial energy to boost their psychic powers.

There were no clear rules, which stalled the development of ability-enhancing potions. Adam privately told Serena that in his previous life, the ability-enhancing potion was only developed in the sixth year of the apocalypse, led by Doctor Zhang, who was based at the Longxiang base. That explained why Adam had rushed to rescue her from the Gaoxin Garden laboratory early in this life.

In his previous life, Adam was at the Longxiang base, a powerful stronghold built from the resources and alliances formed before the apocalypse. It was the only base that could rival Kunshan, and its strength and complexities were undeniable.

This time, however, Longxiang's capabilities were inferior to the apocalypse stronghold; it couldn’t even contend with Kunshan.

Adam didn't elaborate further, but Serena, who only lived until the fifth year in her previous life, felt a mix of hope and dread. It was reassuring to know that the potion would eventually be developed, but the wait of five years felt like an eternity. By then, who knew what trouble Fu Boqi’s evil system would conjure up next?

Days turned into weeks filled with the urgency to grow stronger and the relentless hunt for zombies. Two months passed, and during that time, neither her informants nor Adam's channels in Kunshan provided any news about Fu Boqi. It was as if he had vanished into thin air.

Serena was convinced that he was plotting something big in the shadows. The scale of the personnel involved at the Fenglin base hinted at Fu Boqi’s ambition. Given his vengeful nature, he wouldn’t stay quiet after losing his eldest son, having his marriage to a prominent family disrupted, and bearing the stigma of poor parenting while losing his position as leader of the Kunshan base.

Serena, fueled by determination, didn’t dare to let her guard down. With Adam’s crystal nuclei boosting her strength, she finally broke through to Level Four. Under her relentless investment, many ability users in the apocalypse stronghold reached Level Three, starting with her own team, including Meng, the Zheng family, and other squad members.

After completing their daily task of collecting crystal nuclei, they faced their biggest challenge since the start of the apocalypse on their way back to the stronghold:

A zombie tide.
