**Copying Abilities**

Dr. Zhang and Little Lu were so shocked that their mouths could fit a light bulb or a duck egg, while Luo Bingting crossed her arms and thoughtfully pinched her chin.

“Hey, little brother, what’s the deal with your ability? Is there a type of mutation ability like this?” Dr. Zhang couldn’t wait to ask, holding a folder containing various data from Luo Fan's awakening process, which didn’t seem any different from others. Little Lu was already perceptively grabbing a pen and paper to take notes.

Luo Fan was equally startled by this sudden ability and quickly composed himself, almost knocking over the few medical devices in the room. Dr. Zhang and Little Lu were frightened and rushed to catch the equipment, but Luo Fan managed to regain control of his power and gently lowered the items, letting out a sigh of relief. Dr. Zhang patted his chest, still shaken, complaining, “If you broke something, it would’ve been a real disaster!”

Luo Bingting encouraged Luo Fan to demonstrate his new ability. Once he realized that there wasn’t anything too important around—just two tables and some scattered papers—he felt a bit more daring. 

As he carefully sensed this unfamiliar power, he could feel the subtle changes it brought him. Unlike Meng Ge's metal abilities or Luo Bingting's ice powers, this one had a strong urge to destroy, compelling him to move without restraint. The items in the room began to float, and Luo Bingting urged him to feel his ability more deeply and try to control it. At first, he struggled to balance his destructive impulses with the control he needed, and soon his face turned pale and sweat dripped from his forehead, his raised hand gradually lowering.

Luo Bingting decided it was best to let him rest for a moment, giving his shoulder a reassuring pat, which instantly quelled the destructive urge within him. Taking a breath, he explained his situation to Luo Bingting in detail, while Dr. Zhang and Little Lu exchanged astonished looks, feeling an eerie chill creep up their spines.

However, Luo Bingting knew that Wu Xiaogang's ability was certainly created by Fu Buqi. But why would he do that? He had previously set up a trap to have her kill Wu Xiaogang—was it a miscalculation on his part?

Still mulling it over, Luo Fan spoke again about his feelings regarding his powers. “I feel like this ability not only has a strong destructive urge, but it also drains my mental energy.”

Dr. Zhang’s interest in Luo Fan intensified; not only Luo Fan but also the unconscious Wu Xiaogang had peculiar powers—one that made everything float and the other that could copy others' abilities for personal use. They both held immense research value, but Luo Fan was terrified of ending up like Wu Xiaogang, trapped in a state of deep sleep, and he quickly refused any experiments.

Dr. Zhang wasn’t upset; he had Little Lu draw two vials of blood from Luo Fan without forcing him into cooperation. Meanwhile, Luo Bingting assigned him tasks: first, to test the duration of his copying ability, and second, to stay close to metal-type ability users to avoid exposing his unique powers, which could potentially be dangerous.

Luo Fan was still dazed by the rapid succession of events, but hearing the word “danger” made him more cautious, and he nodded in agreement. For typical new ability users, mastering their powers quickly, controlling the output of their mental strength, and improving their ability levels were paramount. For Luo Fan, however, survival was the most important thing. With such a rare ability, finding the right crystal core was incredibly difficult; he could only hope that the ability-enhancement serum from Dr. Zhu would be available soon.

After explaining the situation to Luo Fan, the young man understood his predicament and direction for development. It was truly a double-edged sword, and he agreed to cooperate with Dr. Zhang in researching his ability, hoping it might lead to other avenues for improvement.

Luo Bingting highly approved of his attitude. Despite having a mutation ability, he remained grounded and wasn't overly excited. In reality, the young man was quite distressed; leveling up was tough, and he had to rely on other ability users. What if everyone else was at level five or six while he was still a lowly level three? Would he even survive?

Luo Bingting instructed Little Lu to escort Luo Fan out while she directly discussed Wu Xiaogang's abilities with Dr. Zhang. Previously, they had only monitored and drawn blood for testing. Now that they had Luo Fan, they had to thoroughly study his abilities as well, since copying powers could be a double-edged sword. If used wisely, it could provide an edge against any mutants or abnormal ability users in the future; if not, it could backfire on him.

Dr. Zhang was always one to tackle difficult problems head-on, and hearing this excited him even more. Luo Bingting granted him access, stating that Wu Xiaogang’s life was not her priority; understanding the origin of these abilities was crucial. She had no idea how many similar power users Fu Buqi had created or if he was manufacturing more zombie-like ability users. Either way, they couldn’t afford to halt their research or the enhancement of their abilities.

Turning to Dr. Zhu, she checked on the progress of the ability-enhancement serum. Thankfully, they had reached the data analysis phase, and the next step would be human trials. Some X-serum had already been sent over, ensuring that even if it had no effect, it wouldn’t harm the ability users.

The researchers were the second batch of awakened ability users, and they needed to be capable of self-defense. Moreover, having powers could inspire further research directions and methods.

Yet, how many more peaceful days they could enjoy was uncertain. There’s an old saying that when an opponent is quiet, they’re definitely plotting something big.

Back at the training ground, Meng Ge was indeed treating the new ability users like rookies. Other ability users watched the newcomers with a hint of the “old soldiers bullying the fresh recruits” mentality. Luo Bingting directly took Wang Xinxin to a quieter part of the training area to prevent the older guys from giving the young girl a hard time, as it would just be cruel.

Wang Xinxin hadn’t expected Luo Fan to return. She admitted feeling a pang of jealousy when she saw him leaving with Luo Bingting. Little did she know that fortune would soon come her way.

Luo Bingting, who usually never took anyone under her wing, personally guided her, teaching her how to control her ice abilities and sharing many detailed techniques. It was a generous transfer of knowledge.

Wang Xinxin’s eyes widened in astonishment; her excitement was hard to contain, and she had to suppress it to stay calm and focused in her learning—not wanting to disappoint her mentor.

With one eager to teach and the other willing to learn, their progress was much quicker than the chaotic scene across the way. Before long, Wang Xinxin could shoot two ice spikes in quick succession, significantly increasing her offensive power.

After all, she was already a level three ability user, which meant she avoided many pitfalls and saved a lot of crystal cores. If they were all fresh level zero recruits, there wouldn’t be enough cores to feed these hungry kids.

The day passed swiftly, and by midnight, someone knocked on Luo Bingting’s door. She sprang up alertly, her mental energy scanning to find it was Fu Kuandan. Guessing what he was about to say, she opened the door and led him to a secluded corner, whispering, “Are you leaving?”

Fu Kuandan, who had been hesitating on how to approach the conversation, nodded dumbly when Luo Bingting got straight to the point.

Luo Bingting nodded back and bluntly said, “Goodbye then.”

Fu Kuandan found it amusing and exasperating, “Do you think I can just leave like this?”

“Why not? Are you planning to take something with you? You can’t just eat and run,” she teased.

“...”

“I mean, shouldn’t you return my car? How am I supposed to get back on foot? Are you not worried I’ll die on the way?”

Luo Bingting wanted to retort, "So what if you die? Why should I care?" But she remembered she was waiting for this filial son to return and stab his father in the back, so she held her tongue and led him to the parking lot, picking a car that had barely half a tank of gas and was a bit old. As Fu Kuandan eyed the powerful modified car beside them, he opened his mouth to say something, but Luo Bingting interrupted him.

“Just consider this car on loan to you. There’s no need to talk about returns; we owe you nothing. You know what to do when you get back with your father, right? If you dare to break your promise, I’ll send someone to hunt you down,” she warned.

Fu Kuandan was left speechless, choking on his words. Luo Bingting shoved him into the passenger seat and floored the accelerator, sending him out of the base.

She didn’t drive far; once they were out of sight of the guards, she stopped and got out, ignoring Fu Kuandan’s expression or mood, turning around and walking away without even a wave goodbye.

Fu Kuandan finally caught his breath, watching the confident figure of the woman walk away, shaking his head. Partnering with someone like her was just bad luck, he thought, tsking in annoyance.
