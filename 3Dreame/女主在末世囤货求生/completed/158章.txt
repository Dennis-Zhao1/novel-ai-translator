Air Gun

"Do you want a single sentence? I don’t want to hear anything else."

"Five thousand points, not a cent more."

The Noisy Ghost was making its last-ditch effort; there was nothing to be done. The main system liked it, so no matter the cost, it had to be acquired.

"You said double points."

"Yes, I said double points."

"Alright, then give me forty thousand points."

Xie Jinghang smiled slightly as he spoke to Luo Bingtin, "I exchanged four seeds for forty thousand points. I can get the air gun now."

Luo Bingtin's eyes widened. "How come the seeds are suddenly so valuable? Didn’t the last system upgrade mean the actual points weren't much?"

Xie Jinghang nodded. "I tried doing business your way, and it seems I picked it up quite well."

Luo Bingtin’s focus was on the air gun. She glanced at the jar in her hands and said, "How about this? You keep two seeds for Dr. Zhang to study later, and exchange the rest for points. This thing is too dangerous; it doesn’t belong anywhere."

Xie Jinghang nodded. Luo Bingtin took out a crystal storage box she had previously used for jewelry from her space. Following An Min's advice, she used chopsticks to pick out the seeds, specifically choosing those without sprout points and with thick skins, thinking it would be safer that way.

She handed all the remaining seeds, jar included, to Xie Jinghang. "Make sure to count how many there are. If it’s ten thousand points each, then exchange them all."

"Got it. Besides the air gun, is there anything else you want?"

"Is the air gun for me?" Luo Bingtin was a bit surprised; she thought it was for Xie Jinghang himself.

"Of course! Didn't you say you wanted one last time? This time, we should be able to exchange for quite a few things. Let’s see what else you might want."

Luo Bingtin was taken aback. She had just mentioned it casually last time, and he remembered it?

Xie Jinghang had already opened the system panel and began listing weapon names. Sitting beside him, Luo Bingtin listened to his magnetic voice, feeling enchanted...

It seemed like she had discovered many things she hadn’t noticed before. She secretly pinched herself; the pain brought her back to reality. It wasn’t the time for idle thoughts.

"Let’s just go with the air gun for now. We can test its power, and we can save the points and exchange them when needed."

Luo Bingtin quickly made her decision. Although Xie Jinghang had mentioned several weapons that piqued her interest, for now, having points in hand meant she could exchange for them later, so there was no need to rush.

Mainly, she was thinking about the mutated plants. What if what they had encountered so far was just a warm-up?

This speculation was grounded in fact; Fu Buqi had been hiding and dared not show his face, clearly having some tricks up his sleeve.

"Alright then, all weapons are unlocked now. Just let me know if you want something."

After saying that, Xie Jinghang stored the glass jar in the system space. The next moment, the sound of coins dropping echoed, indicating, "Account credited with three hundred fifty-seven thousand points."

"Host, wow! That’s great! The main system praised me!"

The Noisy Ghost once again spoke out of turn, and Xie Jinghang was speechless. He immediately exchanged for two air guns.

Gone were the days when killing a zombie only netted you one point; the rush of newfound wealth was genuinely uplifting…

"Here, let’s see how well it works tomorrow."

Xie Jinghang handed one of the air guns to Luo Bingtin. He had checked the weapon demonstration in the system, but only now, holding it in his hand, did it feel real.

Luo Bingtin shifted the meticulously crafted air gun in her hand, admiring its sleek lines and futuristic design. The overall silver finish was accented with glowing blue details. Even if it wasn’t used as a weapon, it was a beautiful piece of art.

It was a standard handgun size, lightweight, not cumbersome or straining on the wrist—truly gorgeous.

The aesthetics made Luo Bingtin happy. "Why wait until tomorrow? Let’s try it now!"

In the next moment, Luo Bingtin and Xie Jinghang appeared in the space again, and the Noisy Ghost cheered before running off to play with the Mirror of Mystery.

"Come help me out."

Luo Bingtin naturally commanded Xie Jinghang, and together they moved two large empty barrels that had previously contained gasoline. After positioning them, she walked about ten meters away, raised the air gun, aimed at the barrels, and pulled the trigger. Almost silently, as she got closer to the barrels, the sound of slicing air became more pronounced.

With a loud "bang," a twenty-five-centimeter-wide hole appeared right in the center of the barrel, completely penetrating it.

"The power is incredible!" Luo Bingtin exclaimed, playing with the air gun in delight.

Xie Jinghang also took a shot at another empty barrel, standing a few meters further back than Luo Bingtin. His shot created a hole as well, but it was slightly smaller, around twenty centimeters in diameter.

The two exchanged glances, both surprised. Xie Jinghang was aware that the system's weapon information didn’t specify this detail.

They repeated the tests several times, discovering that the closer they were to the shooting target, the greater the damage; conversely, the further away they were, the less damage was inflicted.

The limit was five hundred meters. Without a scope, Xie Jinghang couldn’t make out small targets clearly, but Luo Bingtin, with her enhanced senses, could barely see enough to hit a target, leaving a small hole similar to that made by a sniper rifle.

"This is amazing! The damage remains strong even from such a distance. The most important part is that the weapon is small and, with a scope attached, it can be used effectively!"

Xie Jinghang nodded and exchanged for two scopes. The scopes were also beautifully designed, entirely silver with fine glitter, and only the markings were in black. Adjusting the magnification was simple; just turn the dial to the desired setting.

Attaching the scope to the air gun was easy and could be adjusted with one hand.

"This gun is incredible; it can fire continuously without needing to load bullets, and it won’t jam or explode. Most importantly, it’s silent—unbelievable!"

The more Luo Bingtin used it, the happier she became. She felt that technology and hard work were a better match than abilities.

Seeing her so joyful, Xie Jinghang couldn’t help but laugh. He secured the gun and tucked it into his waistband.

"Let’s go; it’s time to head out."

Luo Bingtin copied him, tucking the gun in place. She had to admit, it did look pretty cool.

After all the commotion, dawn was breaking. The two finished breakfast and began discussing their next steps.

They gathered the core team and Pei Qian for a meeting. They had put in tremendous effort this time, so Luo Bingtin decided to charge half price for everyone to receive the ability enhancement serum, but first, they needed to fill the big pit and bring back the researchers.

"What ideas does everyone have for this pit?" Luo Bingtin opened the floor, resting her chin on her hand as she looked at everyone.

"Can’t we transport the stones from the back mountain to fill it?"

"I think we should leave the back mountain alone; let’s just dig up a barren mountain."

"Are we moving a mountain here? Isn’t that a bit over the top?"

Everyone began discussing in turns when suddenly, Xie Jinghang posed a crucial question, "Has anyone thought about where all the dirt from such a big pit went?"

Luo Bingtin’s heart raced at his words. Right, where did the original soil go? She quickly instructed all the ability users to search outside, sending all but a few to stay behind for protection. If they found anything, they were to signal.

They formed groups of three, each carrying a signal flare, and set off. Thankfully, there were plenty of vehicles in the fortress, and they split into different directions, with a rule that everyone must return to the base by sunset.

Luo Bingtin teamed up with An Min and Wang Xinxin, while Xie Jinghang led Luo Fan and his teammates. The vice captain took two others, and two followed Zhu Xiaoshu. Pei Qian took Pei Chang and an assistant, forming ten small teams that quickly drove away from the fortress.
