**Exploiting Vulnerabilities**

"This feels like a series of obstacle courses, one after another, endless!" An Min finally voiced the question that had been weighing on his mind for a long time.

"Yeah, it’s like there’s an invisible hand controlling everything. I feel like I'm in an escape room," Luo Fan chimed in.

"We're practically in a survival game here," An Min replied, and the two suddenly found themselves deep in conversation, even jokingly agreeing to team up for a chicken dinner if they ever got the chance.

Xie Jinghang had already made it to the 12th floor, prompting a raised eyebrow from Luo Biting. It seemed like the noisy spirit was rushing him again.

"Host, this building has over thirty floors; you haven't even reached halfway," the system reminded him.

"Stop urging me. Why don’t you give it a try?" Xie Jinghang shot back.

"I’ll do it if I have to!" 

The two bantered back and forth, ending with Xie Jinghang leading the way, and Luo Biting following him through the center area of the twelfth floor, directly to the elevator lobby.

Luo Biting and the others exchanged puzzled glances at Xie Jinghang. Was he really planning to take the elevator?

Xie Jinghang nodded, looking exhausted. The fire escape stairs were cluttered with all sorts of debris. If they wanted to be efficient, the elevator was the quickest option.

"But there's no power," An Min pointed out, noticing that the elevator area was completely clean, but the pressing question remained: where would the electricity come from?

Before Xie Jinghang could answer, Zhu Yidan suddenly jumped with excitement. "Are you silly? You’re a human wind machine, and Xie is a human battery! Don’t you remember his powers?"

An Min was momentarily stunned. Right, his lightning ability meant he could generate electricity!

"Why didn’t we use that sooner? We just climbed twelve floors, battling through all those challenges, and now you tell me we can take the elevator? My heart is breaking; I might faint!" An Min exclaimed, unsure if he was being serious or just putting on a show. But no one took him seriously.

Xie Jinghang took a breath, raised his hand, and sent a silver-blue current toward the elevator button. The current wasn’t very strong, but it was effective. In the next moment, the indicator light on the elevator button lit up. None of them had ever thought that a simple red mechanical light could look so warm and inviting at that moment.

Before long, the digital display above the elevator began counting up from 1 to 12.

"Wow, the elevator is really coming! Xie, do you feel burdened by this?" An Min asked curiously, while Luo Biting also looked eager for an answer. Xie Jinghang suppressed the impulse to ruffle Luo Biting's hair and shook his head.

"No problem at all; it’ll only take a few minutes, not much energy wasted."

He wasn’t boasting. His powers were more than sufficient for this task. 

Once they were in the elevator, Luo Biting pressed the button for the top three floors. She wasn't sure if Meng Ge and the others would be on the top floor, but they had to be somewhere above. This was the perfect time to scan for their whereabouts while the elevator ascended.

Little did Fu Buqi expect that one day in this post-apocalyptic world, his enemies would take the elevator up to confront him.

Meanwhile, he had managed to calm his emotions. His understanding of the situation was evident. He never confronted challenges head-on; showing off bravado was pointless. Maximizing his benefits was what truly mattered.

When he proposed to continue monitoring the surveillance, the system quietly agreed. It had been doubting whether its decisions were correct. Its binding with Fu Buqi was based entirely on the luck of the male lead. The system's principle was to bind with only the luckiest individuals.

The system, appearing unfazed by past conflicts, allowed him to check the surveillance freely. Not long after, he exclaimed, "Why can’t I see anyone? Did they run away?"

As soon as Fu Buqi’s voice fell, the system hurriedly replied, "Impossible! My research indicates that humans will not give up easily on endeavors that require significant investment."

Having slacked off for a while, the system quickly began searching. It suddenly realized its control was not comprehensive; many facilities had already been damaged. Through the perspectives of various plants and animals, it observed that Luo Biting and her group entered the twelfth floor and then vanished, likely to rest.

With a cold snort, it scoffed at its current host, thinking he was weak. If it weren't for the male lead's luck, it would have changed hosts long ago. 

It was also its fault for granting too many permissions and freedom to the host, leading to the current predicament.

"They’re resting on the twelfth floor. It’ll probably take them two to three hours to crawl back up here, so there’s no need to panic," the system offered token reassurance to Fu Buqi, urging him to be patient and less anxious while they waited for their enemies to stumble.

"Just so you know, I want all of their crystal cores," the system suddenly stated, making what seemed like a simple request, ensuring its plans were foolproof.

Fu Buqi, however, was a shrewd individual. He never believed anything could be executed perfectly—everything needed a contingency plan. After years of binding with the system, it had never made a mistake. Its statement triggered his sixth sense, compelling him to devise a Plan B. He suppressed that elusive instinct and decided to rely solely on the system.

Knowing his circumstances, Fu Buqi settled back down, his expression focused as he watched the surveillance feed, waiting for Luo Biting and her group to reappear.

At this moment, Luo Biting and her companions had already exited the elevator. As the elevator ascended, she concentrated her mental energy to identify the crystal core’s light points. Meng Ge’s crystal core was a reddish gold. Besides her own and Xie Jinghang’s, the colors of ordinary ability users’ crystal cores also had their unique features.

However, what helped her quickly distinguish Meng Ge’s group wasn’t them specifically but Zhu Yidan’s brother, whose healing ability’s crystal core emitted a truly strong glow—soft gold mixed with a white luminescence, radiating warmth and brightness like a little sun. Instantly, she locked onto their location.

Luo Biting pointed to the spot, signaling everyone to follow her.

At that moment, An Min was still planning to crack a joke to lighten the mood. He glanced at Xie Jinghang, who was distracted and occasionally lost in thought, and held back, not wanting to disturb him. Instead, he made eye contact with Luo Fan and Zhu Yidan, urging them to pay attention.

Zhu Yidan was not fond of indirect communication like raised eyebrows and subtle gestures. Keeping her distance, she overheard Luo Biting whisper, "Found them. They’re just behind this door."

Zhu Yidan looked at the gray wall and the silver-gray metallic security door, wearing an expression that suggested she was being intentionally teased. This door was even more imposing than the one that had once locked her and her father in that laboratory.
