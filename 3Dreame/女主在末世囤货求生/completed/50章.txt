**Missed Opportunity**

Meng stood off to the side, keeping a close eye on the unfolding argument, eager to gather more information. The shouting continued.

“Who do you think you are playing the good Samaritan here? Do you really think you’re worthy?” Sally’s derisive tone cut through the air.

“Sally, why are you saying that about Zhenzhen? She’s just trying to help,” another girl chimed in, her voice filled with concern.

“Give me a break! You think she's genuinely kind? Her heart is as black as coal! You all must be blind to not see it!” Sally launched a full-scale attack, her disdain evident as she regarded everyone around her with contempt.

“Don’t slander me! I’ve never done anything to hurt anyone!” Zhenzhen, the girl being accused, protested, her tea ceremony skills remarkable, but her defense lacking.

“Slander? I saw you push Wang Tao out to feed the zombies while you ran away. Not only that, but you locked the door behind you! Wang Tao died a miserable death, and you don’t feel a shred of guilt?” At this revelation, all eyes turned toward Zhenzhen.

Flustered under the scrutiny, Zhenzhen stumbled over her words. “I didn’t push him! Wang Tao did it to protect me…” Before she could finish, she burst into tears, appearing utterly pitiful. “I’ve never hurt anyone! Why would I feel guilty? You’ve always hated how Wang Tao and the others treated me, and now you’re slandering me!”

Her argument was so seemingly rational and heartfelt that if Luo Bingtin hadn’t known what kind of person Zhenzhen really was, she might have believed it too.

Sally was about to respond when a cacophony of footsteps echoed from the entrance. Luo Bingtin’s heart raced with anxiety; someone had attracted the zombies. She squeezed Meng’s arm, signaling him to be alert.

Fortunately, they were concealed in the shadows, and as long as they didn’t expose themselves, the zombies wouldn’t find them. But the same couldn’t be said for the group of people approaching.

The footsteps grew louder, and three men in tactical gear sprinted into view, pursued by a horde of zombies. The dim emergency lights in the parking garage created an even more terrifying atmosphere. The men’s teammates rushed to assist, while the remaining survivors panicked, screaming and fleeing.

Among them, four men in dress shirts seemed to be from the same company, darting away with astonishing speed. The three women, perhaps believing in the soldiers’ capabilities or simply too frightened to move, huddled quietly in a corner, covering their mouths in fear.

The bickering had ceased, replaced by a palpable tension as they wished to blend into the wall.

Luo Bingtin caught sight of one tall man wielding a broadsword. With precise movements, he dispatched the zombies with a grace that contrasted sharply with their own chaotic attempts at survival. Every swing was rhythmic and controlled.

The other teams used their firearms to take down zombies, the silenced gunshots muffled yet frequent as they needed to reload after just a few shots.

Just as Luo Bingtin thought the tide was turning in their favor and prepared to take a shot at Zhenzhen, she noticed Zhenzhen clinging tightly to the girl who had defended her, her eyes filled with a mixture of hate and murderous intent directed at Zhenzhen. The girl was shielding herself behind Zhenzhen, and Luo Bingtin's grip tightened on her gun.

The leader of the men nodded at his team, instructing them to be cautious. As they prepared to take cover in the corner, he suddenly raised his weapon and shouted in their direction, “Who goes there? Step out!”

The others followed suit, guns trained on Luo Bingtin and her companions, with one of them switching on a flashlight, illuminating the dark space.

Luo Bingtin felt her teeth grind together in frustration, having missed yet another chance for revenge, her throat tightening with bitterness. She quickly tucked her gun away, cursing under her breath at how alert their senses were, ruining her chance to settle the score.

Meng was the first to stand, and Luo Bingtin and the others followed suit, their legs stiff from crouching too long.

The beam of the flashlight made it even harder to see the faces of their would-be rescuers, but Luo Bingtin noted that they were all tall and muscular, each easily over six feet.

The group that was supposed to lure the zombies had stayed back, now partially encircled. With guns aimed at them, Luo Bingtin exchanged a glance with Meng and shrugged.

Meng’s hand instinctively moved toward his gun at his waist, but the second-in-command barked, “Hands up! Don’t move!”

Luo Bingtin felt exasperated. She would rather fight than be treated like a suspect, having to surrender like this. It was the apocalypse, after all! What was with the old-school tactics? She shot back, “We’re survivors! What’s the deal? Are we breaking any laws here?” Her tone was sharp.

“And who are you? The police?” the commander retorted, turning his flashlight to shine back at her.

It was clear they hadn’t expected such defiance from anyone. The others assumed they were merely a group that had hidden away in the parking garage, but the leader spoke up.

“Survivors? I’ve never seen survivors so well-armed,” he said, a skeptical look on his face, as if challenging her to come up with a better story.

Luo Bingtin’s group was indeed dressed uniformly, clearly equipped, and their calm demeanor stood in stark contrast to the panicked survivors who had fled in a hurry.

Meng finally spoke up, citing his military unit’s number and explaining that they were looking for family members.

However, as they prepared to leave the underground parking lot, they had seen people running in and decided to hide, planning to wait until everyone else had left before making their move. It was a clear indication they hadn’t intended to confront anyone directly.

Luo Bingtin stifled a laugh internally; Meng had picked up on her sarcasm, and now he was playing it well.

Before the second-in-command could retort, the leader called for silence, allowing Luo Bingtin to finally see his face. He was the tallest among them, his black tactical uniform adding to his imposing presence. A handgun hung neatly at his waist, and he wielded a broadsword—the very one Luo Bingtin had wanted to buy but never had the chance to.

It looked striking in his grasp, she thought.

The commander saluted Meng and introduced himself, revealing they were a special forces unit on a mission, casually rescuing survivors along the way.

Meng nodded, wanting to suggest that since they all had missions, they shouldn’t waste each other’s time and should split up to act swiftly.

Before he could speak, the commander continued, “You all look well-equipped. How about we team up? We can share the mission.”

Luo Bingtin felt a pang of unease. Something felt off about them. She studied the commander’s ruggedly handsome face, wondering why such a good-looking guy had to have so many hidden agendas. Now it seemed he was trying to pull her into his plans.
