### Early Changes in the Magnetic Field

Lo Bingting looked utterly incredulous, and as Xie Jinghang observed her, memories of his own past surfaced. He recalled how his expression must have mirrored hers at that time. 

“It’s true. The intel from my contacts at the Kunshan base confirms it. Everyone saw him just fine—no injuries at all,” he sighed, watching as Lo Bingting's confidence crumbled. She had turned back with certainty, only to realize it was all a joke.

Yet, she never easily doubted herself. “I’m certain my shot wasn’t off. There’s something wrong with him! Didn’t you also say he had issues?” Lo Bingting locked her gaze onto Xie Jinghang, waiting for an answer.

He nodded, his expression solemn. “I’ve shot him before—aimed carefully—but he remained completely unscathed. I even doubted myself and tried it more than once.”

How could he be unhurt after being shot multiple times? Lo Bingting’s thoughts immediately veered toward the possibility that Fu Buqi possessed some sort of ability. However, the global magnetic field hadn’t shifted yet, so how could Fu Buqi exhibit such invulnerability?

A sense of shared concern began to develop between them. The realization that they couldn’t kill Fu Buqi left Lo Bingting feeling helpless and anxious. Since her rebirth, she had never felt such a complex mix of emotions. The familiar feeling of powerlessness from her past life began to seep back in.

Desperately trying to control the overwhelming feelings, she reminded herself that no one was invincible. Many powerful abilities had succumbed to various reasons in her previous life, and Fu Buqi wasn't at that stage yet—he must have weaknesses, just ones that no one knew about at the moment.

Xie Jinghang remained quietly supportive, not interrupting but attentively watching her. As he observed her expressions shift from shock to despair and then to resolute calm, he suddenly felt a deep empathy for her struggles and perseverance.

The path to eliminate Fu Buqi seemed daunting, but perhaps it wouldn’t be so hard if they faced it together.

After a few days of slacking off, Lo Bingting resumed her training—focusing not just on physical conditioning and skills but also on her shooting. Even though she rationally understood that her marksmanship was sound, she couldn’t shake the thought: what if?

On the second day of her training, the sky was particularly gloomy. Since dawn, dark clouds loomed ominously, and with the snow having ceased for several days, spring should have brought warmth, yet there was no sign of it.

Arriving at the training grounds, Lo Bingting greeted Meng Ge and Xie Jinghang before preparing to start her session. However, before she could even remove her jacket, an inexplicable and familiar dizziness struck her. A sharp ringing in her ears pierced her head, and her vision began to blur. She caught sight of Meng Ge and Xie Jinghang clutching their heads and nearly collapsing, yet they still moved toward her.

The last thing she saw before slipping into unconsciousness was the spinning ceiling, and just before her awareness faded, she was certain of one thing: the global magnetic field had shifted ahead of schedule.

Having experienced this bizarre and unexplainable phenomenon before, Lo Bingting regained consciousness much earlier than the others. She felt something beneath her nose, and when she wiped it with her hand, she found dried blood on her fingers. Had she actually had a nosebleed? That had never happened in her past life.

Nearby were Meng Ge and, unexpectedly, Xie Jinghang. Right, she had seen them rushing toward her before losing consciousness; she felt a flicker of warmth in her heart.

Just as she reached out to check their breathing, she noticed something different about her own body—something that felt distinctly unlike her previous life or even her rebirth.

Taking advantage of the fact that no one was awake yet, she swiftly slipped into her space. Since she had snatched the treasure box from Grandpa Zhang at the Fenglin Villa base, her space had been enveloped in mist, rendering the screen a blank white. Now, upon entering, it remained the same after more than a week. Was there an issue with the upgrade?

Exiting the space, she suddenly recalled something from her past life: after the magnetic field shifted, one had to wait for people to awaken naturally. Forcing them awake could disrupt the awakening of abilities. Moreover, the changes in her own body were puzzling; previously, her spirit energy would circulate automatically when she entered the space, but now she felt that subtle energy even outside.

This world had no spirit energy! Lo Bingting attempted to use her mental powers to sense the environment and employ her divination skills, but found them altered as well. Was it just her imagination? When she extended her hand, the area affected by her divination was covered in tiny frost flowers; as soon as she withdrew her energy, the frost vanished.

At that moment, she realized that her previously dormant abilities had awakened since her rebirth. It seemed to be ice-based. In her previous life, she remembered that common abilities were categorized by the five elements: gold, wood, water, fire, and earth, while ice abilities fell under nature elements, classified as a mutation.

Could this be due to the numerous changes she had experienced in this life? Was the early shift in the magnetic field related as well? In her previous life, the magnetic field hadn’t changed until over a year after the zombie outbreak. Was her presence as a butterfly in this timeline the cause, or was there something else at play?

With too many questions swirling in her mind, Lo Bingting felt a bit dazed after waking up. Pressing her fingers against her temples, she glanced at her wristwatch. It had been just over four hours since she had fainted.

The impact of the magnetic shift was powerful; the compass needle spun wildly, as if it were trapped in a gyroscope. Fortunately, the electricity was still on; otherwise, the people inside would have surely frozen to death.

Suddenly, a thought struck her. Lo Bingting dashed out of the training room, worried that someone might be outside when the magnetic field shifted. Being unconscious outdoors in freezing temperatures for over four hours was perilously dangerous and could lead to hypothermia.

Walking felt too slow, so she hopped into a vehicle to scour the stronghold’s corners. To her relief, she found a few members of the patrol team lying behind the office building, practically hidden unless one looked closely. Thankfully, it hadn’t snowed again; if it had, they would have been even harder to find.

During her search, she also checked the laboratory and dormitory. All the researchers and doctors were safe; there were no lit alcohol burners or active research equipment, and all the test tubes and flasks were intact. Even the cages holding the zombies were calm; they had lost their aggression when captured and were now quiet due to the magnetic field change.

In the dormitory, grandpa Zhu and uncle Zhu were both asleep in bed. Grandpa Zhu had been ill frequently during winter, and uncle Zhu often kept him company. Seeing them sleeping peacefully eased her worries.

Her family and the Zheng family were all safe in their rooms, with ample heating indoors, so there was no need for concern.

After another round of searching, she confidently checked the guard posts, certain that they couldn’t have escaped. Sure enough, they were sprawled on the ground. She checked each for breathing, pulse, and heartbeat, feeling relieved when they all seemed fine.

After dragging three or four of them in, Lo Bingting was out of breath. Even though she was exhausted, she felt accomplished; this was a result of her physical training. In the past, she wouldn’t have been able to manage even one.

This training session had certainly met the mark.

Expecting that these people wouldn’t wake up anytime soon, Lo Bingting rubbed her growling stomach and settled cross-legged in a corner. She pulled out a steaming plate of red oil dumplings from her space, accompanied by a cup of hot milk tea. 

This was her first time eating in front of so many people after pulling items from her space, and it felt so satisfying.

Sipping the sweet tea, she found it delightful and soothing against the spice. Once she finished, still feeling unsatisfied, she rummaged through her stash from the snack street and pulled out a giant squid—one bigger than her face—and began munching away, her mouth dripping with red oil.

Lo Bingting made a decision: no matter what happened later, she would celebrate her newfound abilities with a feast for her family. Spicy rabbit heads, fragrant rabbit chunks, and cold rabbit dishes would be perfect. If she didn’t devise a plan soon, the rabbits in her space would multiply uncontrollably.

Just then, someone stirred awake. Lo Bingting, holding a can of soda, turned around to see Xie Jinghang rubbing his head as he sat up. She quickly tidied away the empty wrappers, still holding onto the soda, and strolled over.

“You’re awake! How do you feel?” Her tone was filled with curiosity and inquiry, leaving Xie Jinghang momentarily bewildered. He blinked, grappling with the sudden shift in her demeanor.

When had Lady Lo ever been so polite to him? 

Something was definitely off—that was the most instinctive thought in Xie Jinghang’s mind.
