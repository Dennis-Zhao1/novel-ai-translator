**Blessing in Disguise**

At this moment, Luo Bingting didn’t hesitate. She pretended to pull out four bottles of oral solution from her bag, having prepared them in advance for this evening. 

Pei Qian took them with utmost seriousness, quickly handing them over to the doctor, urging him to inject them right away. Luo Bingting's heart raced at the thought—could the lake water be used this way?

Xie Jinghang had an inkling of what was happening, as he also assumed they would be taken orally. He was surprised when the doctor opted for an injection instead.

Watching the doctor open the bottles of oral solution and fill a syringe with it, Luo Bingting felt a twinge of anxiety. After the doctor injected the liquid into the IV bag, the readings on the monitoring device began to change rapidly. The doctor, visibly excited, exclaimed, "The blood oxygen levels are rising, and other indices are improving! This medicine is truly miraculous!"

Pei Qian couldn’t hide his excitement either. After telling them to make themselves comfortable, he returned to the bedside, gently brushing the hair of the woman lying there. Luo Bingting watched this and felt something was off. She tugged at Xie Jinghang's sleeve and whispered in his ear, "Didn’t they say she’s his sister? What kind of brother looks at his sister like that?"

Seeing the serious expression on her face, Xie Jinghang sighed, realizing she wasn’t getting it. "Qingmei is still a sister. Stop staring, let’s head back and get some sleep."

Luo Bingting detected the disdain in his tone and pouted. What was the deal with this brother-sister thing? They were clearly a couple; why did they have to throw around those sibling titles? Who did they think they were looking down on?

Just as she prepared to follow Xie Jinghang out of the room, a sudden buzzing sound erupted in her head, loud enough to be deafening. She clutched her head, shaking it slightly, but soon the feeling returned to normal.

Her mind was racing with shock greater than what had just happened. This was bad; ever since encountering the hooded zombie alone, something had been off. She wanted to call out to Xie Jinghang but found herself unable to make a sound. Just as she reached out, another wave of intense buzzing overwhelmed her, and she pressed her ears shut, but it did little to help.

In the next moment, she seemed to see Pei Qian stand up and look her way, and she caught a glimpse of Xie Jinghang pausing to turn back. The last thing she saw was her own reflection in the glass, collapsing to the floor.

“Beep... beep... beep...”

Where am I? Luo Bingting found herself in an extremely empty space, devoid of anything. The surroundings were pitch black, the entire area felt void-like, with only the repetitive beeping sound filling the silence. It resembled the sounds emitted by some machinery, though she couldn’t pinpoint its source.

Luo Bingting felt as if this place stretched endlessly with no exit. The beeping was regular yet irritating, and the temperature was dropping rapidly. She tried to use her mental energy to perceive her surroundings, but as soon as she did, a sharp pain shot through her head, forcing her to withdraw. She couldn’t even access her ice abilities.

In this space, she found herself powerless, as if a vortex was siphoning away her abilities. Her limbs felt heavy and weak. Suddenly, she realized she couldn’t continue like this. If she didn’t resist, she would be consumed, facing nothing but total annihilation.

Refusing to surrender ignited an infinite power within her. She had yet to avenge her grievances, and she wanted to live; she had to find an exit, she must survive!

Enduring the pain, she summoned her mental energy. The dull ache felt like someone was relentlessly smashing her head with a hammer, drilling into her temples, it hurt so much. She clenched her fists tightly against her forehead, and slowly, the darkness before her began to fade away. It was working.

She was elated to discover it was indeed working. Gritting her teeth, she pushed her mental energy to its limits; the pain seemed to plateau, no longer intensifying beyond a certain point. At least she hadn’t blacked out. Time felt irrelevant as the brightness of her surroundings increased, and the beeping grew more frantic. Suddenly, a sharp sound rang out, cutting through the noise, and the world fell silent.

The pain had left her drenched in cold sweat, her hands and feet icy. The scene before her transformed into blinding brightness, startlingly intense. She raised her gaze to see the surroundings, but the light was so glaring that she quickly raised her hands to shield her eyes. In the next moment, the brightness swelled further, to a point where even closing her eyes wouldn’t help.

Luo Bingting hesitated to open her eyes, fearing the light would blind her. She hadn’t noticed that the pain and chill had disappeared; it was as if the light was solidifying, forming into a massive orb, barreling straight towards her.

Instinctively, she raised her hands to protect her head. In the next instant, it felt as though something shattered, or perhaps something was coalescing.

During the time Luo Bingting was unconscious, Pei Qian was the first to notice her condition.

Looking at Xie Jinghang, who was guarding Luo Bingting's bedside, he hesitated before speaking up. "Miss Luo seems to be under a psychic attack. I distinctly felt the energy fluctuations from psychic abilities just now. It looks like her situation is quite severe."

The doctor, having been alerted, came over to examine her. The large medical equipment at Longxiang Base was not as comprehensive as that of the Apocalypse Fortress. Upon hearing that the injury was caused by abilities, he quickly called for a healer with healing powers.

Xie Jinghang’s lips pressed into a thin line. He couldn't understand why this had happened so abruptly. He had warned Luo Bingting before; her earlier good condition didn’t seem like a façade. What could have triggered this event?

The healing ability user arrived quickly, but to no avail. Pei Qian felt a wave of disappointment wash over him as he said, "My abilities are malfunctioning; I can't check Miss Luo's crystal nucleus. I’m sorry."

Xie Jinghang shook his head. He knew from his past life what Pei Qian had endured and understood why he didn’t act lightly.

After all, it was an attack that even normal ability users couldn’t withstand, let alone a patient.

“Pei, what’s the range of psychic abilities?” Xie Jinghang suddenly asked.

Pei Qian was taken aback for a moment, instinctively replying, “My limit is 500 meters, but if my abilities evolve further, the range will expand.”

“500 meters, huh? What if it’s him? What would he do?” 

Luo Bingting’s troubles were clearly caused by the hooded zombie. Given that there had been psychic energy fluctuations, could it mean the attacker was nearby?

With this thought, he quickly stood up and walked to the office where they had just been talking, peering out the window. The sky at three or four in the morning was still dark, obscuring everything. A sudden premonition washed over him.

“I’ll step out for a bit.”

Pei Qian watched as Xie Jinghang moved to the opposite room. He greeted his friend before rushing out, quickly instructing his men to guard the hospital room door, and followed closely behind.

Once outside the base, the two level four ability users felt confident; as long as they didn’t encounter a horde of zombies, they could swiftly deal with the scattered ones.

They quickly reached the rooftop of the apartment building. Pei Qian sharply detected residual psychic energy in the area and immediately informed Xie Jinghang.

Confirming his suspicions, Xie Jinghang felt no satisfaction. They had missed the hooded zombie and potentially arrived too late, a surge of anger and murderous intent boiling within him.

Pei Qian, having been through similar experiences, recognized Xie Jinghang's demeanor. He approached and awkwardly patted his shoulder in a gesture of comfort, knowing they were returning empty-handed.

Meanwhile, during their absence, Luo Bingting was overwhelmed by the brightness of the orb, feeling uncomfortable with her eyes closed. In a moment of urgency, she retreated into her space.

This time, she didn’t experience the throbbing in her veins or head. Instead, the light orb that followed her began to spread throughout the space, part of it drifting towards the Mirrored Realm, being absorbed by it one by one.

Luo Bingting felt an unprecedented sense of ease, her mind clear as she looked up at the Mirrored Realm. She noticed the previous message displayed on its screen: 

“You have been invaded by a malevolent spirit in your consciousness; you must eliminate it quickly, or you will face life-threatening danger.”

It was still in ancient script. Luo Bingting read each word one by one, and as she processed the information, she immediately began to complain to the Mirrored Realm. 

“No wonder I’ve felt so unwell ever since meeting that hideous zombie! It turns out I brought in something dirty that triggered a rejection reaction in this space!”

The Mirrored Realm then displayed four characters: 

“Congratulations on your breakthrough.”

Luo Bingting found this somewhat perplexing. Did this breakthrough mean she had conquered the intruder in her consciousness, surpassing herself?

That interpretation made complete sense. She felt an immense difference between her current self and her previous self. She could automatically sense the situation after unlocking her mental energy, as if it had merged with her aura-reading technique, becoming more tangible. She formed connections with everything in the space, leading to an elevation of her mental energy.

What was this called? A blessing in disguise.
