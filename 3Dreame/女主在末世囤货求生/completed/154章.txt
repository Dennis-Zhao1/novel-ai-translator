**Night Assault**

Lo Bingting shouted to the people around her, quickly retreating to the corner of the office building. 

“Fire-type ability users, attack!”

As soon as she steadied herself, she directed the fire strike. Zhu Xiaoshu, Zhu Yidan, and other fire ability users reacted swiftly. In the darkness, flames shot into the sky, illuminating their surroundings. It was indeed those mutated plants, old acquaintances of theirs.

Lo Bingting called over Luo Fan to stand beside her and listen to her commands. Wu Xiaogang’s abilities had already been copied by Luo Fan, and as long as they didn’t refresh, he could maintain them indefinitely. She hoped everything would go as planned.

The vines of the mutated plants wildly reached out from the dark hole, attacking them haphazardly. Xie Jinghang and Pei Qian, leading their respective teams, countered methodically. To prevent rapid depletion of their abilities, they had arranged for shifts, ensuring that every position had backup power.

Lo Bingting’s backup was Wang Xinxin. Although she had only recently awakened her abilities, her direct mentor had provided ample resources, allowing her to advance to level four, just behind Luo Fan. The other ability users weren’t so fortunate, lingering on the edge of level four.

However, the vines continued to surge forth, seemingly endless. Lo Bingting ordered someone to bring over the lit torches, inspired by the Dragonflight Base’s suggestions from Pei Qian. 

The vines were afraid of fire. Though the torches weren’t large, their numbers made up for it. For a while, the vine attacks weakened, and everyone caught their breath. Just then, a massive wave of vines surged forward, intent on self-destruction. They seemed willing to be burned just to emerge.

Seeing this, Lo Bingting tossed a small barrel of gasoline out. As it arched over the dark hole, she shot several ice spikes, piercing the barrel. Gasoline sprayed out like a shower, cascading down.

Immediately after, Xie Jinghang and the others also hurled their torches. The descent felt like slow motion to everyone present.

With a loud boom, flames erupted into the sky. The mutated plants squealed as if burned, trying to retreat into the hole, but the group wouldn’t let them escape. They unleashed their abilities as if money were no object. An Min seized the opportunity, whipping up a strong wind to intensify the flames.

A nearby member of the guard team joked, “An Min, is this skill born from burning corpses? Your moves are like turning bones to ashes!”

“Just a bit of skill,” An Min replied proudly. “Look how well I’m burning this! I deserve the title of a walking bellows!”

“Come on, you’re more like a walking air pump,” someone teased.

“Get lost! Go away, go away!” 

Amid the banter, An Min was playfully chided, lifting the previously tense atmosphere of battle into one of fleeting joy. 

Seeing the mutated plants being scorched into a mass of black ash, blown everywhere by An Min’s wind, Lo Bingting quickly called for a halt. As this obnoxious kid reveled in his success, several people were blinded by the ash, pausing to rub their eyes. Lo Bingting waved her hand to clear the view and suddenly noticed another bizarre mutated plant quickly crawling out from the dark hole, even larger than before, with thicker vines.

“Watch out, another one is coming!” 

Everyone launched their abilities, but unfortunately, the damage was minimal. The severed vines quickly transformed into small plants, reproducing at an astonishing rate. The fire ability users hurriedly tossed fireballs, reducing the smaller ones to ash, but the larger ones refused to catch fire.

Detecting a damp odor, Lo Bingting guessed it might be coming from the underground tunnel of the power plant. The air was thick with moisture. She reached into her spatial pocket for another barrel of gasoline, ready to throw.

“Wait!” 

Xie Jinghang grabbed her hand and turned to An Min. “Try using wind blades to chop off the thicker vines, quickly!”

An Min immediately complied, unleashing several wind blades that sliced through the mutated plants with a whoosh, the sound of air being split. The vines that met the wind blades fell, severed. 

“Fire ability users, quickly burn these cut vines!” 

Just in time, they incinerated everything before it had the chance to reproduce again. An Min kept the rhythm, one cutting while a group burned, and soon the mutated plants were left defenseless, unable to extend their vines to attack anymore.

By the flickering firelight, the mutated plant that had its vines cut off looked peculiar. It used to crawl with its vines, but now, without them, it lay motionless on the ground like an insect without legs. 

Lo Bingting shot several ice spikes at it, piercing through its active root system. Normally, when a plant’s roots were damaged, it couldn’t grow anymore. She wondered if this mutated plant adhered to the same rules.

However, she was unprepared for the surge of mutated plants crawling out of the dark hole, dispersing in different directions. They were forced into three groups: one under Lo Bingting’s command, one under Xie Jinghang’s, and one under Pei Qian’s.

Pei Qian had around twenty ability users under his command. Although they were all newcomers, they had developed a good synergy and worked well together. Xie Jinghang, with his special forces background, knew how to lead and organize.

On the other hand, Lo Bingting found herself overwhelmed. Despite her authoritative position in the fortress, even older men who appeared fierce didn’t dare shout at her. Yet, her subordinates’ coordination left much to be desired; it would be an understatement to say they were merely paying lip service and not following her commands.

Fortunately, Lo Bingting was resourceful, but without her self-sufficiency, she felt her position could become a breakthrough point for relentless attacks.

Considering the plant's characteristics, she figured that, aside from their fear of heat, they also likely feared cold. Together with Wang Xinxin, they froze all the nearby plant vines, shattering them with a single strike. With the vines cleared, the roots were exposed, and once they discovered the method, it became easy to deal with.

Some ability users were already absorbing crystal cores to replenish their energy. Lo Bingting frowned; the number of mutated plants was increasing rapidly.

“Get people to retreat! Move towards the main gate! Head for the tower!”

She loudly notified Pei Qian and Xie Jinghang. Everyone fought while retreating, with the mutated plants hot on their heels, resembling frenzied sea urchins chasing after them.

Earth ability users continuously dug pits, while fire ability users collaboratively created a firewall to block the advance. Xie Jinghang occasionally unleashed lightning strikes, combined with Lo Bingting’s ice barriers, buying precious time for those lagging behind.

Once everyone reached the tower, the searchlights and floodlights at the entrance were turned on, and when everyone looked, their scalps went numb, and goosebumps erupted all over their bodies. 

It was just like the last time they faced a zombie siege, but now, it was mutated plants. 

Lo Bingting realized this battle would be tough and was shocked by how disgusting it was. Even she, who didn’t have a phobia of clusters, was nearly developing one.

Unable to endure any longer, she pulled out a row of gasoline barrels and set them on the ground. She then retrieved her previously hoarded flamethrower from her spatial pocket, which she initially thought she wouldn’t need in this lifetime. This moment, however, proved it was extremely appropriate.

She passed them out to Xie Jinghang and the guards. Upon seeing this fantastic weapon, everyone instantly felt relieved.

“Miss Lo, you’re amazing! So many flamethrowers! Let’s roast these nasty things today!”

“Don’t insult dogs! Those disgusting things down there aren’t even as cute as dogs.”

“Alright, enough chatter. Let’s get to work!” 

The guard captain and his teammate teased each other, but Lo Bingting didn’t have time to deal with anyone else. She rummaged through the armory, hoping to find even more suitable weapons.
