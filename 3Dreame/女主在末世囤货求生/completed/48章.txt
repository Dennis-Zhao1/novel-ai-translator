**No Danger, Just Surprises**

Who could tell her why there was such a large platform in the fire escape on the sixth floor? The fire door only separated the stairwell from the office, but where on earth did the twenty-some zombies standing on that platform come from?

The two of them had been moving quietly before, so they hadn’t disturbed the zombies swaying on the platform. Now, retreating to the fifth floor was clearly not an option. Luo Bingting decisively signaled to her companion, Brother Meng, to charge ahead. He gestured for everyone to follow, brandishing his sword as he trailed behind Luo Bingting, rushing toward the zombies on the platform.

Everyone drew their swords and joined the fray. The training Luo Bingting had done in their shared space finally paid off. The glow of her sword flickered as she struck with precision—whenever a zombie reached for her, she would first slice off its hand, then deliver a swift blow to its head, and even had time to stab another one on her way back.

It was easier than she imagined. Each person took on one zombie, and that was that. Luo Bingting and Brother Meng were particularly effective, cutting through the zombies like they were nothing more than vegetables. Everyone looked at Luo Bingting with newfound respect, astonished that the heiress who was worth billions had such a cold-blooded killer side. She had just executed a combo move!

Good-looking people killing zombies sure looked good, An Min thought to himself.

He wondered if his own movements were as awkward looking. Little Seven had a bit of a creep vibe, not at all fierce or imposing. Old Three and Old Four were just brutes, while Old Five and Old Eight were okay but lacked distinctive traits. An Min felt he was more impressive than all of them.

He didn’t understand why he was having such random thoughts in such a high-stakes environment, but by the time he snapped back to reality, the group had already formed up and was making their way upstairs.

The higher they went, the more zombies they encountered. Brother Meng had to raise his hand to signal for stops more and more frequently. Luo Bingting was getting a bit tired of this routine; she really wanted to whip out a machine gun and unleash a barrage, or even fire a rocket launcher to just blow everything up. 

That was how killing zombies should be done, she thought. Who wouldn't want to use guns for ranged attacks? A crossbow would be fine too, but close combat was really tiring. 

Right, a crossbow—why hadn’t she thought of that when they were stockpiling supplies? She was feeling a bit frustrated; it was all the fault of the god’s incomplete assignment. This was a mess he had to take the blame for.

Finally, on the stairwell of the tenth floor, their group ran headlong into a horde of zombies. There was simply no way to avoid it—a large group of zombies was trapped in the stairwell. Luo Bingting accepted her fate and stepped forward, swiftly slicing through them, severing arms and allowing her subordinates to stab at their heads.

Everyone was in a rhythm now, and the difficulty felt like it was decreasing. They had initially thought it would remain tense, but the younger ones were starting to feel the plot was getting stale; they were getting tired of these minor enemies.

Brother Meng sensed the group’s relaxation and lack of focus, which was not a good sign. Suddenly, a fast-moving zombie, having lost its hand, lunged fiercely at Little Seven’s neck. Luo Bingting reacted in an instant, leaping up and delivering a powerful kick, landing just in time to stab through the zombie's skull.

In that moment, everyone broke into a cold sweat. If Little Seven had taken that bite, he would definitely have been done for. They had never considered whether they could bear to take down a loved one who had turned into a zombie.

So, they all steeled themselves, focused, and continued to clear out the rest.

This wave included over twenty zombies. They spread out and fought while retreating, finally clearing all the zombies near the eighth-floor corner. Luo Bingting reluctantly started moving up to the eighth floor again when Brother Meng spoke up, saying there were still others in the building.

Luo Bingting was puzzled, and Brother Meng continued, saying he heard the sound of a handgun with a silencer firing.

Quickly expanding her mental energy, she confirmed that there was indeed a group of people present—armed, possibly police or military?

As long as they didn’t interfere with her group, they could peacefully coexist without crossing paths. 

Luo Bingting whispered, “As long as they aren’t bad people, they don’t concern us. We need to locate Uncle Zhu and his family quickly.”

Everyone nodded in agreement and resumed their ascent. Once they returned to the tenth floor and continued upward, they found it was smooth sailing; they didn’t encounter any zombies again. The ones securing the fire door were Old Five and Old Eight, who had also improved their speed considerably.

They had been at it for several hours, having taken down three waves of zombies. Everyone was physically drained and their mental state was not great either. Brother Meng decided it was time for everyone to take a break, eat some food, and hydrate to recover their strength.

Luo Bingting didn’t want to spend the night outside; she preferred a quick resolution, fearing that nighttime would bring more uncertainties and dangers, not just from the zombies but also from humans.

She discussed with Brother Meng to increase their pace. Now that everyone had gained a fair amount of experience in zombie slaying, as long as they weren’t up against a massive horde, the eight of them could handle it.

Brother Meng had confidence in their combat abilities, especially noting that Luo Bingting was performing exceptionally well, which was unexpected.

The fourteenth to sixteenth floors still had scattered zombies, but they cleared them out. Finally, they reached the door to the fire escape on the seventeenth floor. The team steeled themselves, knowing that a fierce battle awaited them next.

They opened the door and moved quickly, soon attracting the attention of nearby zombies, who came rushing at them. There were a lot of zombies on the seventeenth floor. Luo Bingting quickly pulled out a strap from her bag, tying her right hand to the hilt of her sword to prevent it from slipping out during combat.

The first zombie she faced was stabbed through the head, but the next one reached out to grab her. Fortunately, the team had gained experience and coordination from previous waves, and they moved with order, even pairing up to handle zombies coming from different directions.

Luo Bingting and An Min worked seamlessly together, each taking turns to strike, with An Min especially adept at finding openings and keeping the rhythm.

Brother Meng was getting tired from swinging his sword, but they barely managed to clear the office of zombies.

After checking that everyone was uninjured, they moved on to the next office.

In the lobby, Luo Bingting had already observed the company names on the walls of each floor; the seventeenth floor housed only two companies, one being Zhu’s biotech firm and the other an electronic tech company.

The biotech company took up the most space, and the batch of zombies they had just fought, judging by their clothing and ID badges, were all employees of the electronics company.

If it had been the biotech firm, they’d mostly be wearing lab coats. The only window the drone had spotted that wasn’t covered with curtains belonged to the electronics company.

Now, Luo Bingting wasn’t sure if their current energy levels were enough to support the next wave. The sun was already leaning toward the horizon, and they needed to hurry.

This time, Luo Bingting led the way forward, expanding her mental energy to locate the entrance to Zhu’s biotech company.

There were indeed a lot of zombies inside, densely packed. She had forgotten to ask about the number of employees at the biotech company beforehand—another oversight.

They had come this far; they could only push through. Luo Bingting truly hoped for a stroke of good luck this time.

Seeing everyone ready, Luo Bingting swiftly raised her sword and struck at the nearest zombie. Slaying zombies was truly a test of endurance.

After finishing off the zombies at the front desk, the roaming zombies inside heard the commotion and rushed out. Luo Bingting declared that this mission was done, and she needed to go back and recuperate for several days. It was simply too disgusting.

If they were going to eat humans, why did they have to rip out their guts? A zombie dragging its intestines over to her was particularly intent on taking a bite.

Another round of stabbing and slicing ensued. Since they hadn’t practiced any specific sword techniques, they did whatever felt natural, and gradually, everyone was reaching their limit, struggling to lift their arms.

Luo Bingting realized this was bad; there were still many left inside, and quickly said, “If you’re tired, take a break. We’ll rotate.”

Old Five, Little Seven, and Old Eight were all in agreement. Unlike the two older brothers who regularly hit the gym, they preferred gaming, and after several hours, they were truly at their physical breaking point.
