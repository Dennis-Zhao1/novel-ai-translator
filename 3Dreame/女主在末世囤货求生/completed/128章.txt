**The Young Hothead and the Innocent Lily**

"Miss Pei, even if you don't like me, you don't have to be so rude, do you?" 

Lily, with her classic victim expression, tugged at the hem of her clothes, lowering her head with red-rimmed eyes. Members of the base passing by couldn’t help but glance at her, feeling pity for the newcomer who seemed so vulnerable and was being bullied by Miss Pei’s people. 

At that moment, a hotheaded young man, brimming with a sense of justice, stepped forward to defend Lily. "Miss Pei, Weiwei has already been through enough; you shouldn’t make it harder for her." 

His words, combined with the concerned looks from those around, only made Pei Shang, who was recovering from an illness, even angrier. Her complexion, already pale, flushed with indignation, creating a stark contrast with the pitiful Lily beside her. 

"You all keep saying I'm making it hard for her—what exactly am I doing? Am I hitting her, scolding her, or kicking her out?" 

Pei Shang, unable to contain her rage, crossed her arms and glared at the young man. He was momentarily speechless, unable to refute her. After all, he couldn’t admit that he simply assumed Lily was being bullied because she looked so pitiful. 

"Why are you silent? If you have no evidence, does that mean you’re slandering me? Should I tell others that you're bullying me?" 

The young man stepped back, feeling the sting of her words. His rationality was starting to slip away, and he could feel cold sweat running down his forehead. 

"Miss Pei, please don’t make this harder for this young man; he’s just being brave and speaking out." 

Lily suddenly stepped in front of the young man, embodying a saintly figure, displaying an unyielding spirit against authority. 

The young man was touched by her defense, and in an instant, his dwindling rationality vanished. He wanted to say more, but at that moment, Zhu Yidan, who had stepped out for some fresh air, witnessed the entire scene. 

She couldn’t help but clap her hands. "Well, well, what a great show! Truly captivating!" 

"I’ve never seen such blatant manipulation in person—impressive!" 

Zhu Yidan's sarcasm was just as sharp as Pei Shang’s earlier words, but unfortunately, Pei Shang was too furious to appreciate it. 

"If you want to watch, then just watch! No need for the mockery!" 

Suddenly, Lily burst into tears. "Wuwuwu, why are you all treating me like this?" 

Her unexpected sobbing made both Zhu Yidan and Pei Shang roll their eyes. After living for over twenty years, they had seen countless zombies, yet never had they encountered such a brainless woman. 

"Weiwei, don’t cry. It’s their fault for being unreasonable; we just lack status and power." 

The young man gritted his teeth, looking as if he wanted to scream but felt powerless. He gently patted Lily’s back in comfort. 

"What are you all doing blocking the way? Is this a place for chatting?" 

At that moment, Anna walked up from downstairs and noticed the crowd blocking the staircase, making it impossible for the patrol team to function properly. 

"Captain Anna, come judge for yourself!" 

The young man seemed to find a lifeline in her presence and hurriedly recounted what he had seen. 

Zhu Yidan was genuinely exasperated by this imaginative genius. It was evident that Lily had bumped into Pei Shang at the corner of the staircase without apologizing, and now it was being spun into a tale as if Pei Shang had unleashed the full wrath of the Qing Dynasty. Clearly, this was not merely a case of brainlessness; it was also an impressive display of creative storytelling. 

To her surprise, Anna listened and looked at them as if they were fools. "Is this all? You’re blocking the way for this? Miss Pei can scold or hit you both, but you better endure it. Do you know where this is? Longxiang Base. If you don’t want to stay and behave, then get lost!" 

Zhu Yidan couldn’t help but want to applaud this beautiful woman with an icy exterior and a fiery heart. Pei Shang was Miss Pei, practically the boss's wife; these two clearly were not looking to stay on her good side. 

"Wuwuwu, young man, don’t say anything more. It’s my fault; I shouldn’t have provoked Miss Pei." 

Lily covered her face, crying as if the world was coming to an end. 

Truly, she was the same type of person as Luo Biting, who couldn’t resist getting involved when she heard the commotion. Zhu Yidan was about to say something objective when Pei Qian and Xie Jinghang emerged from the office. Upon seeing the crowd, Pei Qian frowned and asked, "What’s going on? Why is everyone gathered here?" 

Pei Shang was already in a foul mood, and hearing Pei Qian's voice made her even angrier. She didn’t want to deal with the situation anymore and tried to push past Lily and the young man to return to her room for some peace. 

When Lily saw Pei Shang reach out, she felt as if she had been struck by a meteor and stumbled backward, taking the young man down with her. 

Zhu Yidan was left with her mouth agape, as if she could fit a lightbulb inside. 

She wanted to suggest that Lily read a classic work called "An Actor Prepares" because her acting skills were truly abysmal. 

Having seen palace scheming and family battles, she had never witnessed base-level squabbles like this before—what an eye-opener! 

However, from the perspective of others, it looked like Pei Shang had intentionally pushed the two down. Given that Pei Shang was an ability user, while Lily and the young man were ordinary people, Pei Shang’s reasoning was now questionable. Anna’s frosty expression suggested that if Pei Shang was going to kill them, they should just accept it, while Pei Qian raised an eyebrow in surprise, saying, "Shangshang, your abilities are back?" 

Pei Shang, already furious from Lily’s series of manipulative antics, turned to Pei Qian, momentarily stunned by his words. "No, you know my situation better than anyone." 

Pei Qian paused for a moment, quickly understanding the situation, and his gaze toward Lily turned unfriendly. 

Lily was sharp enough to sense the change in atmosphere and immediately offered an out. "I’m sorry, I was trying to step aside but lost my balance, and we both fell." 

As she said this, she quickly got up, not forgetting to help the young man, who had been pinned beneath her. 

Seeing that nothing serious had happened, Pei Qian motioned for everyone to disperse. However, Pei Shang felt that Pei Qian was siding with Lily, not caring about the accusations against her. Furious, she stomped off to her room, slamming the door behind her. 

Lily remained behind, her gaze drawn to the handsome man standing next to Pei Qian, who was even taller and more striking than him. She felt a flutter of excitement; a man with power, status, and abilities like Pei Qian's instantly piqued her interest. 

It was all Pei Shang’s fault for being so fiercely protective, watching over her like a hawk. Otherwise, she could have become the mistress of the base long ago. 

But as the saying goes, when one door closes, another opens. With a coy smile, Lily thanked Pei Qian, lowering her gaze to reveal a glimpse of her fair neck. The young man next to her couldn’t help but stare. 

Zhu Yidan rolled her eyes; she rarely witnessed such blatant flirtation even during her college years. It seemed the apocalypse hadn’t managed to wipe out all the ridiculousness of humanity. 

Unfortunately, men often failed to understand such subtlety. Pei Qian, with a gentle smile, addressed Lily. "No need to be so polite; when you’re at the base, treat it like home. There’s no need to be so reserved." 

Upon hearing this, Lily looked up and offered a pure, innocent smile, her eyes sparkling as she nodded eagerly. If it weren’t for the overly affected "mmhm" sounds accompanying her response, she might have been considered a beauty. 

Zhu Yidan rolled her eyes again. Oh, men! 

Just as she was about to step back to Xie Jinghang's side, Lily moved closer to his side, tilting her head curiously and asking, "Are you new to our base as well? Hello! I’m Lin Weiwei. It’s nice to meet you!"
