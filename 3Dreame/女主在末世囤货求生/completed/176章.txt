**Human Cocoon**

An Min and Luo Fang hadn't participated in the previous rescue operation, so they were momentarily confused by Zhu Yidan's words. Luo Bingtin and Xie Jinghang exchanged a glance, instantly reminded of that infuriating laboratory door.

“Why don’t you try to open it?” 

Zhu Yidan directly shouted for Xie Jinghang to charge the door, which earned her a few eye rolls from the others.

“What are you looking at me like that for? Did I say something wrong?” 

Zhu Yidan looked completely baffled. If the elevator could be powered, then surely a laboratory door with an electronic lock should be even simpler, right?

“Do you really think Xie can know the password to this door?” 

An Min replied, exasperatedly explaining to Zhu Yidan, who seemed to have no grasp of how things worked, acting as if it were completely reasonable.

At that moment, Luo Bingtin had already pulled a micro-explosive from her spatial pocket, the same kind they had used to blow up the Maple Forest Base. It wasn’t too destructive, but it could easily take down a wall or two.

“Everyone, step back! We’re about to detonate.”

Just as Luo Bingtin finished speaking, Xie Jinghang suddenly heard the annoying spirit calling out to him.

“Host, we’ve been discovered! The enemy now knows where we are, and things are about to get chaotic. If you encounter them, you must inform the little fairy immediately!”

“Discovered? Hurry up!” 

Xie Jinghang quickly pulled Luo Bingtin behind him, preparing for the explosion.

The sound was thunderous. Fortunately, the blast radius was well contained, and the laboratory door was blown open. Luo Bingtin, eager to detect their exact positions with her psychic powers, found instead that various colored lights were gathering toward their location.

“Quick, get inside and find the others!” 

Luo Bingtin urged, striding into the lab through the newly created opening.

“Dr. Zhu, Dr. Zhang, are you all in there?” 

The lab was dim, and after a moment of thought, Xie Jinghang placed his hand on the exposed wires of the blown-up wall. Soon, the lights flickered and then fully illuminated the space.

Luo Bingtin and the others had hurried to the door of an office that was shut tight. She knew the people were inside, and with a swift kick, she burst the door open. The scene before her made her vision swim.

Inside the office, there were no tables or chairs, but it was incredibly cramped and eerily unsettling. The others who followed her in were equally taken aback; there were rows upon rows of cocoons, seemingly woven from spider silk. Zhu Yidan attempted to rush forward to tear them open, but Luo Bingtin quickly restrained her.

“Don’t be reckless! The spider silk is likely toxic.”

“Yeah, looking at those vibrant colors, it probably has quite a bit of poison.”

An Min chimed in at the right moment. Xie Jinghang pulled out gloves from his fireproof suit. These not only protected against fire but also against toxins. He also drew his dagger, slicing through the spider silk.

Luo Bingtin retrieved her Longquan sword, handing one to each of them. Fortunately, while the silk was tough, it wasn’t indestructible; the blades sliced through easily.

An Min utilized a small dagger forged by his family—sharp and compact.

Luo Bingtin also donned the fireproof gloves, and the three of them set to work, carefully peeling away the cocoons. Unfortunately, they were all in a state of unconsciousness—there were over forty people in total. Luo Bingtin had to think of a way to wake the superhumans up. The antidote she carried was sufficient, but time was running out. She could only rely on her method to bring everyone to safety; otherwise, they wouldn’t have enough time once those monsters downstairs started moving.

She distributed the antidote and water, urging them to give it to Meng Ge, Xiao Lu, and the other superhumans first. Feeling danger approaching, she decided to join Xie Jinghang in holding off the incoming threats outside the laboratory, buying An Min and the others time to peel away the cocoons and awaken the superhumans.

“An Min, you and Luo Fang put on these gloves. Yidan, you’re in charge of administering the antidote and giving them water. Xie and I will guard the entrance. Stay safe!”

After tossing the gloves to An Min, she pulled out her air gun and turned to leave. 

Xie Jinghang did the same, hearing the frantic cries from the annoying spirit.

“Ah, Host! The little fairy is so cool! She dazzled me!”

“Shut up! You’re being so loud!” 

As Xie Jinghang reached Luo Bingtin's side, he noticed a surge of mutated plants and insects rushing toward them. In that moment, the sight of zombies seemed almost normal compared to the bizarre variety of mutated creatures.

Their air guns unleashed a relentless barrage, and while they worked quickly to clear the onslaught, Luo Bingtin felt it wasn’t enough. She decided to crank up the heat.

The highly popular weapon, the Flame Dragon, materialized out of thin air. As the flames erupted, it felt like healing energy coursed through her…

“Xie Jinghang, let’s use it together! It’ll be more fun that way!” 

The Flame Dragon had a wider attack range than the air guns. One was most effective up close, while the other allowed for a safer distance.

Xie Jinghang nodded, unleashing the Flame Dragon alongside her.

“Are they ever going to stop coming? I refuse to believe that!” 

Fueled by anger, Luo Bingtin shot flames while simultaneously unleashing her ice powers. Xie Jinghang, seeing this, brought out his ice gun to complement her abilities, enhancing the freezing effect to maximize damage.

To anyone watching, they would see that while the flames roared, the ground was littered with shattered ice remnants.

This strategy effectively created distance with flames while the ice gun dealt with the mutant flora and fauna’s attacks.

Zombies began to pour in, clawing and gnashing their teeth. Luo Bingtin raised her hand, launching several ice needles that pierced through their targets, only to be frozen solid by Xie Jinghang’s gun. A little extra attack would shatter them into pieces.

Once frozen, the zombies would break apart, their crystal cores falling free, completely unhindered by the ice that had encased them, as if they were independent entities.

After about half an hour, An Min and Luo Fang finally joined them, reporting that Meng Ge and the other superhumans had woken up, while Zhu Yidan was busy taking care of the rest.

“You all stay here and guard. I’m going in to check on things.” 

With that, Luo Bingtin dashed inside.

“Meng Ge, are you feeling better?” 

She found Meng Ge sitting against the wall. His complexion was still pale, likely due to the poisoning he had suffered earlier. Zhu Yidan was still busy administering water and antidotes, turning to ask.

“Meng Ge, how did you all end up here?” 

Meng Ge downed the water Luo Bingtin had given him in one go, taking several deep breaths before speaking in a hoarse voice.

“We meant to check on Xie and the others at the base, but we ran into mutated plants blocking the way. So we redirected to the second backup base, but trouble struck just after we arrived.”

“We thought we’d be safe at the backup base, but a few kids got curious. When their parents couldn’t find them, they opened the base door themselves to go look for them and ended up getting ambushed. Everyone was captured and brought here.” 

After Meng Ge finished recounting their story, Luo Bingtin finally understood the situation.

Once Zhu Yidan had administered the antidote to everyone, Luo Bingtin gathered all the non-superhumans into her spatial pocket, arranging them in the bus stored within. Originally, she had thought a cargo truck would be more convenient, but if these people fell asleep, it could lead to dangerous overcrowding. A bus was just right for their needs.
