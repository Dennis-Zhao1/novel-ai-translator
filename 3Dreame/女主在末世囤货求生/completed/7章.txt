**A Nap Meets a Pillow**

After returning from the apocalypse, Luo Bingtian expressed that the dazzling, intoxicating world was simply too enchanting.

It all started with a phone call in the afternoon.

Zhu Yidan, the eldest daughter of the Zhu family, had returned to the country without a word. The moment she landed in Kyoto, she called Luo Bingtian, crying and begging her to host a welcome party, complete with a lavish diamond service.

Luo Bingtian pieced together the underlying message from the jumble of chatter and complaints that followed. It was as if the universe conspired to grant her wishes: just as one dozes off, a pillow is handed to them. Zhu Yidan had just posted on social media about her safe arrival back home, and Luo Bingtian eagerly liked and commented, practically itching to send a flurry of emojis.

She quickly typed under Zhu Yidan's post, "No time for the welcome dinner, but I've arranged some fine wine for tonight with friends. So, are we going?"

Almost instantly, not just Zhu Yidan but a multitude of mutual friends chimed in the comments with an enthusiastic "Let's go!"

Luo Bingtian chuckled to herself and changed the name of the "Luxury Car Bride Delivery Group" to "Welcome Back, Yidan, Wine Gathering," instantly pulling in everyone who had responded.

Those who had been oblivious to Zhu Yidan's return were now surprised to see so many new members—mostly girls—joining the group, bringing the total close to forty.

Someone couldn’t help but ask in the group chat, "Are we really kicking off the 'marriage event' now? Isn’t that illegal…?"

Unbeknownst to Zhu Yidan, who had been snoozing in airplane mode while crossing international borders, she excitedly declared in the group, "I’m back! Let’s all get together tonight!"

Luo Bingtian, ever the efficient planner, launched a barrage of red envelope giveaways to stir up excitement in the group. Zhu Yidan quickly followed suit, and those who had participated were automatically queued up to send and receive their share.

The red envelope frenzy truly lit up the atmosphere, and everyone was having a blast. Luo Bingtian had already made arrangements at a friend's bar for the largest private room, eagerly waiting for Zhu Yidan to arrive.

The welcome dinner wasn’t genuinely a matter of urgency; rather, Luo Bingtian was focused on how to quickly exchange her assets for something she truly desired. Among these so-called friends, very few had genuine connections; most were simply people from the business world with whom she had to maintain a facade of camaraderie. Their parents were more than happy to see their children mingling, as business partnerships might just blossom from these relationships. Even if no collaboration arose, it was better to avoid creating enemies—after all, harmony breeds wealth.

There were quite a few second-generation heirs with political backgrounds; their ambitions were modest, making them more suited for social networking rather than high-stakes negotiations.

As Luo Bingtian flipped through her asset report, her assistant knocked on the door and entered. She had already requested an expedited assessment report from a professional asset evaluation firm. After a quick comparison, the numbers weren’t too far apart, and she promptly acknowledged her assistant's efforts.

The assistant beamed as if she had just consumed two tons of spinach, suppressing a grin that threatened to break her serious demeanor as she skipped out of the office.

“Truly dedicated to your work,” Luo Bingtian mused.

Combining insights from the asset evaluation report, she calculated the equivalent exchange for the items she wanted, sorting the piles of documents on her desk.

When Zhu Yidan arrived at the Pearl Jewelry Building, it was already past normal working hours. As her secretary led her to the office, Luo Bingtian was still busy organizing the asset evaluation reports.

To achieve a decisive impact, thorough preparation was essential—she needed to avoid arousing suspicion while facilitating a swift and clever exchange.

Zhu Yidan boldly perched herself on the edge of Luo Bingtian's desk, her dyed auburn fingers playfully lifting Luo Bingtian's chin.

In a teasing tone, she exclaimed, “My little Bingtian! It’s been nearly a year since we last met. How have you grown even more beautiful? Let me take a closer look! Wow, you look stunning! Give me a kiss!”

Luo Bingtian chuckled at this only friend of hers, her clear eyes reflecting the playful grin of Zhu Yidan, though her mind was devoid of any news from the apocalypse that had transpired during their time apart. In her previous life, she hadn’t returned to the country at this time but was traveling abroad, unaware of how the world had changed. Now that Zhu Yidan was back, she just wanted to find a way to live well.

Zhu Yidan noticed her friend staring at her with a puzzled expression, which made her feel slightly embarrassed. She quickly tried to cover it up.

“Wow, even a big boss like you is working late? Let me see what you’re busy with!”

She snatched the asset evaluation report from Luo Bingtian's desk and skimmed through it, her eyes widening with envy. “You truly are the richest lady in the capital! These assets are enough to make anyone green with envy…”

Luo Bingtian didn’t want to put on a show in front of her friend, but she also couldn’t divulge the full truth, so she vaguely replied, “I’m not good at managing these things, and I don’t really care for them. Every year, they just give me my share, but wouldn’t it be better to turn them into things I actually like? Just looking at them brings me joy!”

Zhu Yidan also had many assets under her name; her family was similar to the Luo family, having built their wealth over generations. They were currently focused on developing in the biotechnology sector.

As Zhu Yidan considered her friend's indifference toward her assets, she thought about how the evaluation report detailed the prices for complete transfer and sale. While receiving dividends wasn’t as immediately gratifying as getting a lump sum, she understood that Luo Bingtian’s preferences were simply beyond her comprehension.

Luo Bingtian had posted a picture of an ancient castle on social media that had failed to astonish Zhu Yidan, perhaps because their long friendship had exposed her to too many impressive sights, raising her standards.

Not wanting to linger in the office any longer, Luo Bingtian gathered up her documents and placed them in a folder. Grabbing her bag and car keys, she took Zhu Yidan out for a meal.

The restaurant was conveniently booked and not far from the bar they were headed to later. They also needed to find suitable outfits for the evening since wearing work attire to a night out felt out of place.

The two young women didn’t take long to eat; they browsed nearby shops, and Zhu Yidan couldn’t help but ask, “Bingtian, what do you want? I honestly can’t think of anything you don’t already have.”

Luo Bingtian, walking ahead, her slender figure accentuated by her high heels, radiated an air of elegance—she perfectly embodied the image of a refined, wealthy heiress.

Turning back with a smile, she replied, “You know my grandfather. Aside from letting me buy a car just to have it on display, he doesn’t allow me to buy anything else. The family plane is just for convenience when travelling for work; I truly prefer yachts and helicopters instead.”

There was a hint of disappointment in her tone, along with a touch of confusion.

“Maybe your grandfather cares too much about you—afraid you’d go to dangerous places?” Zhu Yidan ventured, her voice uncertain.

“Perhaps. But Grandpa is gone now, and I’m grown up. I have desires but can’t possess them. You understand, right?”

Luo Bingtian gazed earnestly into Zhu Yidan's eyes, and after a moment of contemplation, Zhu Yidan nodded slowly.

“If you put it that way, I realize I don’t have much either. We’ve never had a yacht party, but those influencer friends of mine go often,” Zhu Yidan said, a hint of envy in her voice.

“Exactly. We don't even have a single swimsuit photo together…” Luo Bingtian recalled.

“I can’t even swim,” Zhu Yidan sighed dramatically.

Both suddenly burst into laughter, realizing that their families had shielded them too well, unwilling to let them face even the slightest mishap.
