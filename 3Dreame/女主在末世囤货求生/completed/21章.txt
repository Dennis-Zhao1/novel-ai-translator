**Under the Shade of Many Families**

Luo Bingtong nodded thoughtfully. In her previous life, many ordinary people had managed to survive the zombie outbreak and the subsequent shifts in the magnetic field without any preparation. Some had quickly risen from the ranks of the insignificant to become powerful beings with supernatural abilities, while others who once held power and status found themselves reduced to mere commoners, trampled beneath the feet of the more fortunate.

In the apocalypse, there were no rules to follow, no laws to abide by. Trusting anyone was a lesson reality had drilled into her. The absence of a single trustworthy person by her side felt unbearably lonely. 

They say that in the end times, one must first eliminate the saints; kindness truly held no value in such a world.

Lost in her thoughts, Bingtong's gaze darkened with the tide of her emotions, until the elder Zhu's voice pulled her back to the present. 

“Luo girl, how much have you managed to accomplish in here?” 

“I’ve only managed to procure a small portion of supplies. Although I’m the only one left at home, there are still many elderly people Grandpa left behind in the old residence, and I can’t just abandon them,” Luo Bingtong replied, carefully keeping her true intentions hidden from the elder.

The other three present nodded in understanding. Yes, her little family might not have many members, but their larger family was composed of dozens of people, and their stockpile was substantial.

“Then it’s settled. We’ll take responsibility for your share of preparations. Since you don’t have anyone to assist you, just focus on funding it. In our family, we have quite a few capable people,” Elder Zhu declared, his two sons nodding in agreement.

“That would be perfect! My trip abroad this time was also to see if I could buy any firearms or ammunition. I managed to secure a few through Uncle Qin, but I’m still unsure how I’ll get them back,” Bingtong shared, letting slip this piece of information that everyone would eventually learn, so that the elder wouldn’t be angry with her for hiding it later. It was important to maintain harmony between their families.

Having firmly decided to rely on the Zhu family, Bingtong casually added, “I also want to stockpile some oil and gasoline. What if the power goes out? Generators and cars will need fuel. Solar panels could work too.”

Elder Zhu nodded, marking a few items on the printed supply list he held. He turned to his nephew, Shu. “You’ll handle these personally. I’ll assign others to take care of the rest. Make sure it’s quick and discreet.”

Bingtong thought for a moment and asked Shu to print another copy of the supply list, highlighting the items she had already procured with cash from her various companies. She handed it to Elder Zhu.

“Grandpa Shu, these are the supplies I’ve already stockpiled and stored in the old residence warehouse. Just deduct these from the total I listed,” she stated confidently. 

Then, she added, “I can connect with the arms dealers. This trip abroad is a great opportunity because of the connections Grandpa left me.”

Initially, Shu had been a bit hesitant, but upon realizing that Elder Zhu had entrusted him with the task of securing firearms, he understood that Southeast Asia wouldn’t do—too many eyes were watching. The best option would be to procure these supplies from countries in Europe and America, where things could be done swiftly and quietly.

Shu immediately sat down next to Bingtong to discuss their next steps. She began to outline the situation with Chris, explaining that he didn’t accept new clients. If Shu reached out without proper introduction, he likely wouldn’t get a response.

This was to be expected; someone like Chris, a unique and enigmatic broker, wouldn’t entertain just any customer. With his extensive network and efficient work style, he wouldn’t lack for business—safety always came first.

After some discussion between Shu and Elder Zhu, it was decided that Bingtong would take charge of securing the arms and supplies, while they would handle the logistics of getting everything back to the country.

This arrangement suited Bingtong perfectly, as it allowed her to leave under the pretense of doing important business while under the watchful eyes of the Zhu family.

At this point, Bingtong hesitated and tentatively asked, “Grandpa Zhu, do you know which family my grandpa entrusted to watch over me besides you?”

“Are you thinking of notifying these families?” Elder Zhu replied with a question instead of an answer.

“Not necessarily a notification. You know that aside from you, no one would believe me. But I can’t just stand by and watch them wait for the apocalypse without any preparation. Even if they treat it as a joke, whether they believe it or not, at least I’ve said it. That way, I won’t feel guilty when I see my grandpa again,” Bingtong explained. 

She hadn’t intended to share this with anyone, but since these were the people her grandpa had arranged to protect her, and given her complicated ties to them, she couldn’t bear the thought of her grandfather seeing her as cold-hearted and selfish.

Elder Zhu fell silent for a moment before smiling. “Alright then. I’ll find a chance to inform them. You don’t need to worry about that. As for the supplies, hoarding them all in the capital is too conspicuous. It’s best to gather them simultaneously from several Southeast Asian countries. We should leave as much of the domestic supplies for our fellow citizens; who knows, it might save more lives.”

Hearing this reassured Bingtong, providing her with the perfect excuse to be out and about, knowing Elder Zhu would help her manage it.

With that topic nearly wrapped up, Elder Zhu needed to assign upcoming duties to his other nephews and nieces. After Bingtong took her leave, she went directly to find Zhu Yidan to talk. 

Feeling a mix of envy and something she couldn’t quite name, Bingtong thought how fortunate Zhu Yidan was to have her grandfather, father, and brothers supporting her, while her own support system had crumbled long ago.

Zhu Yidan seemed to notice Bingtong’s low spirits and simply sat with her in silence until Bingtong came to terms with her feelings. The two friends then chatted and laughed for a while before Bingtong eventually drove away.

In the following days, Bingtong maintained daily voice or video calls with Elder Zhu, entrusting him with the arrangements for liquidating her joint ventures. This allowed her to sit back and relax.

However, an underlying sense of urgency continued to drive Bingtong, pushing her to be faster, to stockpile more, to prepare as much as possible.

Two days later, when Bingtong was taken to the Zhu family’s logistics warehouse in the suburbs of Beijing, she finally understood what true efficiency looked like. The most valuable asset was indeed talent; it was people who made things happen.

Her share of supplies was stored separately in a large warehouse, meticulously organized and categorized. As she looked at the packaging of items labeled in various foreign languages, she realized that Elder Zhu was genuinely working to stockpile resources from Southeast Asia, hoping to offer her fellow citizens a glimmer of hope.

Seeing the warehouse filled to the brim with supplies, Bingtong sincerely thanked everyone in the Zhu family. 

“Thank you, Grandpa Zhu, and all the uncles and aunts.”

Elder Zhu waved his hand, as if remembering something. He leaned closer and asked in a low voice, “Do you think we should build some kind of fortress or city? Otherwise, with the chaos outside, how can we possibly protect so many supplies at home?”

Those words struck Bingtong like a bolt of lightning. This was a question she had never considered in either of her lives. In her previous life, she had left the old residence and was promptly sent to the Kunshan base. A stronghold for the apocalypse seemed like a necessity after all.

Seeing Bingtong nod in agreement, Elder Zhu nodded back, a silent understanding passing between the two of them, alienating the others around them.
