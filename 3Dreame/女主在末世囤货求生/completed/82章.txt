Rearranging the Layout

Lo Bingting finally felt a sense of relief. It turned out that her earlier method had been incorrect; the Qi Observation technique was a more gentle form of probing. If she continued to release her powers at such a rapid pace during combat, she would have to pause and say, “Wait a moment, my cooldown period hasn’t expired yet!” That would be ridiculous.

Using mental strength to directly and forcefully channel her abilities was far more effective; the ice spikes she released varied significantly in hardness. Meanwhile, those training nearby stared in disbelief, wondering what on earth was happening.

As others began to sense the changes within their bodies, they caught sight of Lo Bingting and Xie Jinghang’s actions. Feeling inspired, they instinctively attempted to unleash their own powers. Even before they reached the assembly point, the training ground was already awash with vibrant colors.

Lo Bingting and Xie Jinghang sat cross-legged on the ground, watching in silence as those who had awakened their abilities tried to use them. 

When the assembly time arrived, Grandpa Zhu finally came downstairs, and it was evident that his health was deteriorating. Uncle Zhu and Uncle Zhu supported him on either side as they approached the group. Grandpa Zhu offered a brief opening remark, and then Uncle Zhu took over the speaking.

Lo Bingting stood before the members of the Luo and Zheng families, flanked by Xie Jinghang and his teammates. Uncle Zhu’s speech was concise; he simply explained the reasons for everyone fainting and the purpose of the gathering. Then he called Lo Bingting and Xie Jinghang to demonstrate their abilities.

With impassive expressions, the two displayed their powers, leaving first-time witnesses astounded. Following that, those who felt they had awoken their abilities stepped forward to showcase what they could do.

Lo Bingting and Xie Jinghang had a rough idea of the situation from earlier, but they were surprised to see that several members of the Zhu family’s branch had also awakened their powers. 

Though Lo Bingting maintained a calm facade, her mind was racing with thoughts. Some issues would have to be confronted eventually. She glanced toward Grandpa Zhu and then shifted her gaze away after a moment.

Among the elders of the Luo family, the old butler and Aunt Li had not awakened any powers. Meng Ge had never lived to see the changes in the magnetic field in his previous life, but in this one, he had awakened a powerful metal-based ability, which pleased Lo Bingting immensely.

Xie Jinghang’s small squad, perhaps due to their backgrounds as special forces, all awakened their abilities. Besides Xie Jinghang, who had a mutated lightning ability, the others had standard powers: two earth-based, one water-based, one fire-based, and one wood-based, making them a formidable team. 

Zheng Anmin had awakened a wind-based mutated ability, while his father had an earth-based ability and his aunt had a wood-based ability. Meng Ge's girlfriend, Liu Xiaohui, remained an ordinary person. 

There were also a couple of younger children who had awakened their abilities but couldn’t sense or use them yet; they were all under fifteen years old.

Uncle Zhu, the last to demonstrate, surprisingly revealed a fire-based ability. About a third of the people in the fortress had awakened abilities, and the younger generation of the Zhu family had a significant representation, with many having standard powers.

Among the mutated ability users, only Zhu Er Ge had a healing ability, which was quite rare in the apocalypse. Coupled with his background in biomedical science, it was a fitting match.

Zhu Yidan, a close friend of Lo Bingting, had also awakened a fire-based ability. She excitedly waved her hand to create a small flame, raising an eyebrow at Lo Bingting.

In the research institute, there was another ability user, a bespectacled researcher named He Lin, a student of Uncle Zhu. He was usually very low-key and not well-acquainted with Lo Bingting, but he had awakened a water-based ability. When he first released it, the water flow was surprisingly strong. It made Lo Bingting wonder if those with strong mental powers also had enhanced abilities.

However, the research institute's personnel were not included in the position adjustments, as their main task was to study zombies. 

Lo Bingting noticed that no one with spatial abilities had emerged, which was understandable. In her previous life, out of hundreds of ability users at the Kunshan base, only two had spatial powers, making them indeed scarce.

After Uncle Zhu registered the status of all the ability users, he instructed everyone to carry out their respective duties until the position assignments were released. He also specified that aside from normal sparring, using abilities to fight within the fortress or against ordinary people was strictly forbidden.

Lo Bingting called Xie Jinghang, Meng Ge, and members of the Zheng family to her room for a meeting. She expressed her concerns directly.

“There are more ability users from the Zhu family branches than from the main family. I think this is a bad situation.”

Xie Jinghang felt the same, especially seeing the fervor mixed with a strange light in the eyes of the branch family when they unleashed their powers. He spoke in a low voice, “The main Zhu family’s strength is indeed being overshadowed. This will undoubtedly lead to disputes over control of the fortress in the future.”

Lo Bingting nodded in agreement. “So I plan to ensure that we hold part of the power ourselves. In terms of ability strength, we’re not lacking, and we have a significant number of ability users, especially since we also have mutated offensive powers.”

Everyone was aware of the actions the branch family had taken before. Although they had maintained a mutual aversion, they had not interfered with each other when they were all still ordinary people. Now, with the awakening of powers, things had become more complicated.

“Grandpa Zhu didn’t look well today,” Zheng’s grandfather sighed. “Grandpa Zhu is older than me by several years. This winter has been long, and the old man’s health isn’t great. It’s hard for him.”

Zheng’s grandfather patted his leg and lamented. “As long as Grandpa Zhu is around, he’ll still hold sway over the Zhu family. Moreover, Uncle Zhu and several direct descendants have awakened powers, so there shouldn’t be any major issues in the short term.”

Everyone could hear the underlying meaning in Lo Bingting’s words, and their expressions turned serious as they exchanged glances.

Lo Bingting habitually tapped her fingers on the sofa armrest, murmuring “Guo Degang” a few times, which distracted Xie Jinghang from his thoughts. Then, she snapped her fingers.

“Rather than sitting back and waiting for something to happen, we should take the initiative. Let’s do as I suggest. To prevent the branch family from causing trouble, we need to secure some key positions and prepare a backup plan early.”

Xie Jinghang and Meng Ge exchanged glances, and Meng Ge cleared his throat. “Little Miss, we’ve actually prepared a little something already.”

Lo Bingting looked at Meng Ge in surprise. “What is it?”

Meng Ge glanced at Xie Jinghang, who showed no intention of speaking up, so he braced himself to continue. “Remember when you were bullied by the Zhu branch family? Grandpa Zhu just brushed it off. Both Old Xie and I were furious, so we thought about what we would do if we had to part ways with the Zhu family, and then…”

As Meng Ge spoke, he paused, and Lo Bingting didn’t rush him. The others, however, grew impatient and urged, “What happened next? Don’t keep us in suspense!”

Seeing Meng Ge’s slow pace, Xie Jinghang couldn’t take it anymore and took over the conversation. “We went out to scout for a potential base to develop. It’s not within the capital city but somewhere in the He Province, and we’ve also collected and transferred some supplies there.”

Lo Bingting felt a mix of emotions—gratitude, sadness, and joy—swelling in her heart. Those who had always protected her, treating her like family and fighting for her, were still thinking of her in this life.

She smiled, nodding her head, then shook it. “It’s not time for that yet. Besides, I’ve invested so much in this fortress; I shouldn’t be the one to leave.”

Many times, she had thought that her ability to avoid becoming a cold-blooded killer stemmed from knowing that there were still people who loved, cherished, and cared for her. With them around, she could maintain that thread of warmth and her true self, not allowing the hatred from her past life to twist her into something cruel.

In their eyes, she would always be the little princess in need of protection, and she felt that sentiment deeply. 

But in this life, she wouldn’t be weak and helpless, lacking any ability to resist. Instead, she would protect those who loved her and those she loved, growing stronger in the process.
