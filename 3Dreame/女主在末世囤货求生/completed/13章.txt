**Bring Me the Gasoline**

Uncle Qin displayed a demeanor of kindness and tolerance, pleased with the smooth transaction that brought substantial profits, solidifying his position in the Qin family. Although he may not be fully qualified to compete with his older brother for control of the family, he certainly held more influence than the other brothers and nephews.

In the spacious interior of a luxury van, Luo Bingtian sat beside Uncle Qin, both of them grinning broadly as they discussed their plans to have some fun with Qin Shao. However, Qin Shao had plenty of matters to attend to back home and was scheduled to leave the next day. Uncle Qin would be accompanying him to handle the assets he had acquired from Luo Bingtian, arranging for a local guide to assist her. Thus, Luo Bingtian, accompanied by her bodyguards, set off to explore the exotic city.

The day was filled with delightful indulgences—eating, drinking, taking photos, and shopping. The bodyguards carried numerous bags filled with local souvenirs meant as gifts for friends back home. By that afternoon, they were slated to catch a connecting flight to a neighboring country known for its rich oil reserves.

After checking into the renowned Burj Al Arab hotel, Luo Bingtian decided to reach out via email to a well-known broker in the area. Their acquaintance had been purely coincidental; when she had just turned eighteen and ventured abroad alone, she found herself kidnapped by terrorists. Her grandfather pulled some strings to have him rescue her from their clutches.

Since then, her grandfather regarded him as a mysterious yet powerful figure, capable of getting things done in exchange for money without any strings attached. He was a lone wolf with extensive connections, respected in both the underworld and legitimate circles.

During lunch at the hotel restaurant, Luo Bingtian received an email from the broker, Chris, inviting her to meet at the bustling North Street at 4:30 PM. After finishing her meal, she and her bodyguards went on a shopping spree in the local mall, buying anything that caught their eye and arranging for delivery to the newly rented warehouse at the port.

Promptly at 4:30 PM, they met. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, Luo Bingtian directly expressed her intent to purchase a cruise ship and gasoline. Chris, donning a headscarf, was not surprised; he had encountered even more outrageous demands before. Young heirs like her were either looking to show off or were chasing fanciful dreams of traveling the world. With money, one could indeed do as they pleased.

As Chris assisted her in navigating the shops while contacting his clients, he observed her joyfully taking photos and videos, a familiar sight for him. Shortly after, he confirmed that he had secured a deal, presenting her with a price quote and commission amount. After some consideration, Luo Bingtian nodded in agreement, her excitement palpable as she urged Chris to take her to see the cruise ship she was about to buy.

Chris arranged for a driver to take them to an inconspicuous three-story building by the port. Upon exiting the vehicle, they moved around to the back entrance, where a group of locals welcomed Chris and led them upstairs. They exchanged no words, but Luo Bingtian noticed that each man had a handgun tucked into their waistbands, and through the reflection on the glass of a nearby window, she spotted several guards brandishing submachine guns on the upper floor.

The shipyard was where they could purchase the cruise ship, but this particular location primarily dealt in gasoline. Before arriving, Luo Bingtian had also mentioned her interest in acquiring a batch of weapons, which momentarily stunned Chris, who then nodded in acknowledgment. It was not uncommon for wealthy heirs to buy arms, but the fact that this refined young lady, who appeared almost like a child to foreigners, was requesting such things added an interesting twist to the situation.

However, it was only a slight intrigue for Chris. He was well aware of his role and responsibilities; once the money was exchanged for goods, everything else was beyond his concern.

Luo Bingtian quietly followed him upstairs, where they entered a room that resembled an office, sunlight streaming through the windows. The man sitting in the executive chair was backlit, making it difficult to discern his features. The group consisted entirely of locals, and Luo Bingtian could feel the sudden tension from her bodyguards. Their instinct as seasoned mercenaries warned them that these individuals were dangerous.

Her bodyguards were legally armed, needing to register their weapons in their home country, but regulations abroad were more lenient. Luo Bingtian, however, felt no fear; Chris had an excellent reputation in the industry, and no incidents had occurred during his dealings.

After being invited to sit, her bodyguards took up a defensive stance behind her. The man in the executive chair smiled and spoke a few words in a language she couldn't understand with Chris. After responding, Chris translated into English for Luo Bingtian.

Before his arrival, Chris had no information about who they would meet, suggesting that this man was likely not the main decision-maker. Although she couldn't comprehend their words, Luo Bingtian had sharpened her instincts through her studies in Qi observation, allowing her to sense the subtle meanings behind their tones and expressions.

It turned out that the local man was not the big boss but rather the third-in-command. He could assist with the gasoline transaction, but any dealings involving firearms had to be conducted through the big boss. Luo Bingtian smiled and nodded, signaling her understanding.

The primary goal of her visit was to purchase arms and gasoline. The cruise ship was of secondary importance, as there were shipbuilding families in China interested in contacting her; it wasn't urgent. Even if she bought a cruise ship in the local market, she had no means to bring it home discreetly.

Throughout the meeting, Chris alternated between languages, and aside from the initial pleasantries, the discussions regarding the gasoline transaction proceeded swiftly. The quantity was significant, and the payment in US dollars would easily amount to over a hundred million. Luo Bingtian allowed ample preparation time for the seller and requested Chris to introduce her to reliable channels for purchasing firearms.

Once the funds were verified, there was no time for lingering. Chris led her to another location, and Luo Bingtian initially expected him to introduce her to the leader of this group. However, the driver veered off, navigating a series of turns that led them to an area resembling a slum.

Luo Bingtian looked around, astonished to see such poverty in a country renowned for its wealth. It felt as if she had been transported to India or some impoverished nation in Africa.

Noticing her raised eyebrows at the sight, Chris chuckled, "What’s wrong, Luo? Didn't expect to find such places in Saudi Arabia?"

Luo Bingtian smiled graciously, "Exactly! Back in China, we joke that even picking up trash in Saudi could make you a millionaire!"

Chris said nothing, just shaking his head with a smile.

After the three of them exited the vehicle, Chris led the way toward a factory building. As they walked through the slum, they saw only women laboring and children playing; there were no adult men in sight.

Luo Bingtian keenly observed these oddities but remained silent. Upon arriving at the factory, the mystery was unveiled. It was an underground arms factory where young, strong men were hard at work.

Chris didn’t take Luo Bingtian on a tour but instead approached a guard to convey their purpose, leading her directly to another room. The Saudi individuals were very business-oriented; the layout of this office mirrored that of the previous one at the port almost precisely.

Once seated, the person in charge understood their needs and instructed an assistant to roll in a black cabinet with wheels. Luo Bingtian was puzzled until the Saudi opened the mysterious cabinet, leaving her utterly shocked, nearly losing her composure.
