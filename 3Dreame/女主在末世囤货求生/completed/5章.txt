**The Heir's Game: A Competitive Auction for Love**

Alright, the little princess of the Luo family really knows how to have fun, but her words, though rough, aren't entirely off-base... They all genuinely love cars. Sure, some of it is fueled by vanity, but let's be real—vanity is an integral part of that love. 

No one can resist the envious glances cast by others. Their family backgrounds and economic conditions naturally put them in a position where they are often the envy of many. The vanity that comes from being admired by peers is even more pronounced, and Luo Bingtin, as one of them, understands this all too well.

“Once I announce the base price, interested parties can start messaging me with their bids. I’ll only accept one bid; if you don't agree to the base price, you can simply bow out of this round without it affecting your participation in the bidding for the next 'prized item.' Highest bid wins,” Luo Bingtin declared.

After her announcement, everyone felt like they could give it a shot. After all, it's hard to put a price on something you truly desire. If the base price turns out to be outrageous, they could simply pass and wait for the next round. This method was not only faster and more direct, but it also saved them from the hassle of back-and-forth discussions that could sour relationships over a few bucks.

The best part was that this method felt a lot like a bidding process, which added an element of excitement. Many of the participants came from wealthy families or had business experience themselves, and those who were less experienced quickly consulted with their savvy relatives. It felt like a thrilling game, and their enthusiasm was through the roof.

Starting with Luo Bingtin’s eldest daughter, half of the twenty-some people in the group immediately began to engage, praising her qualities one after another. Everyone rushed to highlight her strengths.

In this lively atmosphere, Luo Bingtin took on the role of an auctioneer, holding a microphone in one hand and a small hammer in the other, standing confidently at the front of the auction hall. 

When the last person finished their praise, it was clear everyone spoke sincerely and with substance. Even those who hadn’t participated in this round nodded in agreement or engaged in discussions about the comments made. Luo Bingtin encouraged this, as it was not only entertaining but also highlighted her daughter's merits—important factors in the bidding process.

Once the discussions wrapped up, Luo Bingtin shared the details of her daughter’s car condition and maintenance history, leaving no stone unturned. She clearly marked every scratch on the bumper and set a base price that was both fair and considerate, based on official quotes and market prices.

Instantly, those who hadn't participated in the bidding regretted their decision, lamenting their missed opportunity. With the rules set, there was no point in dwelling on the past; they could only focus on the upcoming rounds.

Luo Bingtin allocated ten minutes for bidding, and as soon as the group was notified, there was a moment of silence as private messages didn’t flood in immediately. This was to be expected. Everyone recognized the base price was reasonable, but they also knew it wouldn’t be sold at that price. The challenge was determining how much to bid above it without going overboard, which was no small feat.

As time ticked away, Luo Bingtin continued to receive bids. Once confirmed, she tagged the respective bidders in the group. “Congratulations to Young Master He, you’ve successfully wooed my eldest daughter! I’ll send you the contact details for my assistant shortly.”

Soon, others in the group chimed in to congratulate Young Master He. At one point, someone asked, “Will we be able to see the final bid amounts after this round? Are we not sharing that?”

Luo Bingtin chuckled, “This is just for fun; it saves time and adds some excitement. If we disclose everything, what about everyone’s pride? It’s not like the amounts are huge—why ruin friendships over it?”

Everyone nodded in agreement. No one wanted to embarrass themselves by revealing a low bid when the stakes were high. 

With the next round of “marrying off the daughter” underway, they quickly adapted to the rules, boosting efficiency and delving deeper into discussions. Some even shared auction prices from foreign markets to compare, making Luo Bingtin’s base price look like a steal.

Under the pressure of not wanting to lose face or feel outdone, the wealthy heirs began reporting bids that were far above what anyone expected. Some could have simply purchased a brand-new car instead, but to those oblivious to the impending apocalypse, waiting a year or two for customization seemed trivial.

Luo Bingtin momentarily zoned out, pondering the apocalypse before shoving those thoughts aside. While managing the auction, she also assigned a special assistant to ensure that the “marriage” arrangements—“engagement in the morning, dowry in the afternoon, and wedding night in the evening”—were executed flawlessly.

The bidding group had transformed into a massive forum for luxury car enthusiasts, where some flaunted their extensive knowledge of various luxury brands, basking in the admiration of their peers. Others, caught up in the excitement, participated in every bid, but ultimately didn’t secure any of the prized vehicles. 

After all, this was merely a contest of financial power, not intellect or other traits, and the wealthy heirs were throwing money around like confetti. Some even began to bid in a frenzy, leaving Luo Bingtin astonished. 

Yet, given the atmosphere, she decided to keep her mouth shut. After all, who wanted to spoil the fun? The key was to ensure everyone left satisfied, with some participants even snagging multiple prizes.

Luo Bingtin made sure to remind everyone to treat her “daughters” well. “They’ve never been hurt in my care, and I hope you’ll cherish them too.” 

To add to the ceremony for the wealthy heirs, she instructed her assistant to urgently procure plenty of red wedding veils and traditional decorations. Any costs exceeding the bids could easily cover the “wedding” expenses.

After all, keeping these wealthy heirs happy required a direct approach. 

The assistant, unfamiliar with the new trends these rich kids were into, found the task easy and even recruited a couple of pretty girls to join in the “wedding procession.” 

With the entire event recorded and shared on social media, the wealthy heirs received countless likes and envious comments, their vanity receiving unprecedented validation. They felt they had gotten a great deal, enjoying the process and the outcome.

After all, the joy of winning against those who had previously outbid them was a rare thrill. 

By midday, all twenty-three cars had been claimed by eager buyers, with a few even selling for more than Luo Bingtin had anticipated. She didn’t mind; she even playfully dropped a few red envelopes in the group chat, claiming it was her contribution to the festivities, fully embodying the roles of mother, auctioneer, and guest.

Just before lunch, she received several calls from other wealthy heirs who had missed out on the morning's fun, expressing regret over not participating in such an entertaining event and lamenting the beautiful “wives” they lost out on. 

Luo Bingtin felt a sudden spark of inspiration as she glanced at the stack of asset documents on her desk, her fingers rhythmically tapping out a playful beat. She began to brainstorm her next quick and easy method to capitalize on this newfound excitement.
