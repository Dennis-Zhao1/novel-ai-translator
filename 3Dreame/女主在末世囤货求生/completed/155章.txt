**Injured Team Leader**

“Hey, what are you busy with? Hurry up and stand behind me!” 

Serena Zhou swiftly pulled the darting Ethan Zhang behind her for protection. At that moment, a swarm of mutated plants began to crawl up the walls, ensnaring some unfortunate souls by their feet. If it hadn't been for their quick reactions, they would have been dragged down already.

A barrel of gasoline was knocked over, releasing a sharp, acrid odor into the air. When the flame thrower was activated, a fiery dragon over a meter long surged forward, sizzling as it scorched the "sea urchin" creatures.

Serena stood firmly behind Ethan, observing the weaponry stored in their makeshift arsenal. Aside from guns, the rest were massive weapons of destruction. The rocket launcher was the most powerful, but it wasn't suitable for their current predicament. Missiles? Forget it—unless she wanted to blow up the entire fortress.

“Ethan, do you have any suitable weapons over there?”

“What?” 

Serena leaned closer to Ethan, but their height difference posed a challenge. He towered over her at almost six and a half feet, while she barely reached five foot five. With a gap of more than eight inches between them, it was hard for her to whisper such secretive matters without attracting attention.

She clung to his shoulder and tiptoed to repeat her question in his ear.

Feeling the warmth of her breath against his skin, Ethan stiffened for a moment before processing her words. 

“Not enough points yet, but taking down these mutated plants will grant me points. I’ll kill a few more.” 

Serena nodded, realizing that Ethan’s system was linked to the tasks he performed in this world.

As she noticed her ice spikes evaporating into steam upon contact with the flames, she and the water-type ability user stood back, watching intently. Meanwhile, Ethan and their teammate, Max Lee, were both busy managing the chaos.

Max relished the opportunity to play with fire. As a child, he had been scolded for playing with flames, but now, in front of his father and aunt, he was having the time of his life.

The entire scene of burning sea urchins became a showcase for fire-type abilities, while the earth-type users built earthen walls to block the advancing plants. To their surprise, the plants managed to pierce through the barriers. Well, considering plants grow from the ground, it made sense they had the ability to break through.

Makes sense.

From the get-go, wood-type abilities had been ineffective against the mutated plants. They were like little siblings in the grand scheme of things, and with only a few high-level wood-type users around, their damage output was the lowest.

The fire raged on for nearly an hour. By the time Serena had emptied most of the gasoline barrels, the fuel in the flame thrower was running low. Thankfully, there were no more mutated plants in sight. Ethan and Max, once they had absorbed enough energy from their cores, took over to finish the job.

Just when everyone thought the battle was over, Serena noticed something amiss. She turned the spotlight in a different direction, and upon getting a clear view, she felt her palms grow clammy.

“Ethan, come here.” 

Serena struggled to keep her voice steady, but Ethan had always been slightly attentive to her, walking over to ask, “What’s wrong?” 

Serena pointed toward the illuminated area. “Look there.”

Ethan followed her finger and saw a massive plant below the city wall. The most striking feature was a dark red bud at its center, veins densely wrapping around it. It looked as if something was writhing inside.

“What is that?” he asked softly.

“I don’t know, but I have a bad feeling about this.”

As soon as she finished speaking, a vine shot out from the bud, aiming straight for Serena’s face. 

Ethan reacted instantly, unleashing a bolt of lightning. Serena raised her flame thrower, ready to incinerate it.

Unexpectedly, Ethan’s lightning connected with the vine, traveling straight to the bud. Bright silver-blue arcs of energy surged through the veins, causing the bud to writhe even more violently. Just as Serena was about to observe more closely, the bud exploded with a loud pop, scattering countless black seeds flying toward her at breakneck speed.

She instinctively grabbed Ethan, dodging swiftly.

“Ugh!”

Ethan grunted as he was caught off guard. Serena quickly steadied him, her heart racing. “Ethan, are you okay? Did you get hurt?”

Ethan was hunched over, his body leaning against hers for support as his legs buckled beneath him. 

When she looked closely, she noticed a deep bruise on his arm—dark and reddish, indicating some kind of poison.

Those blasted seeds were toxic! How disgusting.

Serena frantically searched her supplies for an antidote but found nothing. She did manage to locate a few antibiotics. Seeing Ethan’s pale face and his eyes starting to close, she gritted her teeth, forcing herself to calm down.

Wait! The lake water! She immediately grabbed a jug and prepared to give it to Ethan.

But Ethan was noncompliant, his breathing growing increasingly strained. Desperate, Serena quickly injected him with a modified antidote and splashed some lake water onto his wound. As he winced in pain, she tilted the jug to his lips, forcing the water into his mouth.

Finally, after a struggle, Ethan began to swallow. Once he was drinking, she took a sip herself, and after finishing the jug, she felt a wave of relief wash over her.

Thankfully, after the bud exploded, nothing more emerged. But what had burst forth was still a mystery—what kind of toxic substance had that been?

Max noticed something was wrong and followed the commotion, only to find Ethan lying on the ground, his head resting against Serena’s shoulder, his face pale and unconscious. He couldn't tell if Ethan had passed out or if he was dead.

“Miss Zhou, what happened?” 

Max asked softly.

“There’s a mutated plant over there. After it exploded, the seeds it ejected were highly toxic. Ethan was hit while protecting me.”

After explaining, Serena urged Max to inform their team members, including Uncle Zhu, to handle the cleanup. The black remnants on the ground should not be touched carelessly; it was best to collect them with gloves and send them to Dr. Zhang for research.

Max quickly complied and dashed off to notify Uncle Zhu. But when he returned, he found both Serena and Ethan were gone.

At that moment, Serena had already carried the unconscious Ethan into their space. He had no idea if his system could still connect while he was out cold. She called out several times, and the screen above her head flickered to life.

“Hey, little fairy! Long time no see!” 

Although the system could see and hear Serena every day, she couldn’t respond, so it felt like a reunion.

“How is Ethan? Is he okay?” 

Her voice betrayed her anxiety and urgency. She had never seen such a towering, powerful man appear so fragile and pale, lying helplessly before her.

“He’s fine! It’s an honor for him to be injured while protecting you. Don’t worry, little fairy, he’s tough! I mean, he’s going to live a long life!” 

The chatterbox was annoyingly casual, suggesting that Ethan truly wasn’t in any serious danger.

“Thank goodness! You scared me.” 

“Little fairy, are you worried about your host?” 

The chatterbox asked innocently, but it didn’t wait for an answer.

Because Serena had already started carrying Ethan toward the old house.

Maybe it was due to the nature of the space, but she had no trouble moving him at all. Outside, she wouldn’t be able to lift a grown man like him.

“If you don’t answer, I’ll take it as you confirming! Hehe!”
