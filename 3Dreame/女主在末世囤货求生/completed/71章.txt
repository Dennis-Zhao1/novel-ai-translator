**Chapter Two: The Treasure Museum**

It was clear that the core of the group was a handsome young man, a bit like a Korean oppa, who looked no older than twenty-five. The rest of the team appeared to be around the same age, likely students or fresh graduates, just out of school for a couple of years.

There were two boys who were identical twins—average-looking but tall. From the way they moved while dispatching zombies, they seemed to have some martial arts training. Among the two girls, one looked younger, probably just a high school student, while the other was a mature woman in her thirties, exuding a certain charm.

After realizing they were just ordinary survivors, Luo Bingtang found herself wishing they would leave soon; she had no idea how long they intended to stay. Being discovered wouldn’t be a problem, but she had taken too many items from the museum, leaving a noticeable gap. If they were even slightly observant, they might suspect her involvement. The secret of her space must not be exposed at this time; otherwise, she would have to eliminate them.

Luo Bingtang didn’t have a penchant for needless bloodshed against strangers; if she could avoid it, she would.

The group sat down to eat and drink. Suddenly, the little girl burst into tears. Her sobs were soft but the kind that grated on Luo Bingtang’s nerves, a sound she found particularly unbearable.

“Brother Ziqian, little Ruo is so pitiful!” she cried, her small frame shaking with each sob.

The expressions of the others turned grim. One of the twins leaning against the wall spoke up, “There’s nothing we can do about it. If we don’t get out soon to find food, we’ll starve to death.”

His tone was laced with frustration and anxiety, along with something else Luo Bingtang couldn’t quite put her finger on.

“Brother Ziqian, let’s go save little Ruo!” the sobbing girl pleaded, clutching the hem of Ziqian’s shirt, her tear-streaked face full of hope and despair.

“If you want to go, then go. I’m not going. It’s too dangerous outside. Can you even kill a zombie?” the older woman scoffed, clutching her backpack tighter as she continued, “I can’t kill zombies, but I’m not going to go looking for trouble. If you can save her, then do it. What’s the point in calling others into the fray? It’s easy to be generous with someone else’s life.”

Luo Bingtang, hidden behind a pillar, almost wanted to applaud the older woman for her words. She couldn’t understand how this little saint had survived until now.

The twins nodded in agreement, expressing they wouldn’t go either.

“Brother Ziqian, little Ruo has grown up with me! Please, save her! She’s just trapped! We can lure the zombies away and give her a chance to escape!” The girl continued to sob, her pleas unending.

“Little Ruo was supposed to go to the Maple Forest villa base. If she can get out, she will definitely survive. Just give her a chance!” The little saint kept begging, and Luo Bingtang felt a bit dizzy from the noise.

Ziqian seemed to be moved; without saying a word, he grabbed his bag and crowbar and stood up, heading outside.

The little saint immediately brightened up and hurried after him, thanking him repeatedly.

The twins exchanged glances, sighed, and followed suit. The older woman, unwilling to put herself in danger, cursed a few times and chased after them.

“Maple Forest villa base? That name sounds familiar,” Luo Bingtang thought, trying to recall where she had heard it before, but couldn’t find any related information. Not wanting to dwell on it further, she quickly drove away to avoid running into the group again.

As she walked beneath the royal city walls, the core architectural structures of Kyoto loomed within the enclosure, standing resilient even after hundreds of years of wear and tear. Once the political power center of a dynasty, it had become one of Kyoto’s most popular tourist sites.

In the desolation of the post-apocalyptic world, this place felt even more lonely and desolate.

What was supposed to be a route to avoid a gathering of zombies led her unexpectedly to a sign for the Treasure Museum. Her eyes lit up, and before long, she parked right outside the entrance.

After securing her vehicle, she sensed her surroundings; this area was even more remote than the museum, and surprisingly, there wasn’t a single zombie in sight.

With no danger in sight, Luo Bingtang approached the locked doors of the museum. Using her enchanted sword, she swiftly severed the iron lock hanging on the door.

This place didn’t appear to be very high-tech. With the beam of her flashlight, she quickly scanned the interior. The hall was a single-story structure, decorated in an antique style with exhibits displayed in glass cases.

Realizing the time was getting late, she didn’t waste energy using her divination technique. The museum was filled with treasures, and she simply closed her eyes to gather everything.

Starting from the Buddha statue at the entrance, she moved from left to right, collecting everything in sight. Then she turned around and swept through the display cases on the right side, gathering more items.

It felt like moving house as she collected supplies, not even sparing the redwood racks meant for potted plants. The Treasure Museum was essentially a treasure trove, housing all kinds of precious gems, gleaming gold and silver vessels, pearls and jade, along with a golden phoenix crown, ivory carvings, and other unique treasures that were unparalleled in the world. One of the most striking pieces was a massive jade sculpture weighing 5,000 kilograms.

These were all descriptions she had found online about the museum.

As she continued to collect and observe each display case filled with jade and gemstones, she felt a beauty steeped in time. The elegance of the antiques was a unique mark of rich historical culture.

This value was not just in market price but also in the fact that these treasures were irreplaceable.

“Is this a dragon robe?” Luo Bingtang gazed at the golden garment hanging in a glass case, rumored to be woven using traditional silk weaving techniques rather than embroidered. There’s a saying that it takes one inch of silk to equal an inch of gold. The golden threads reflected the light from her flashlight, emitting a dazzling and exquisite glow as she collected it.

“This coral bead is beautiful too!” She had always liked this mixed treasure style and gathered it.

“Wow, there’s even the emperor’s jade seal—Tianhuang stone? This is the precious stone known as the king of stones! There’s hardly any left now; I must take it!” 

These vessels and ornaments were also incredibly beautiful, with craftsmanship that was clearly intricate. Even replicas on the market couldn’t compare.

Internally marveling, she continued to gather more and more.

For the first time, Luo Bingtang meticulously collected every item from the entire Treasure Museum; she was almost at the point of wanting to scrape the walls and pry up the floorboards.

When her mental energy was finally exhausted, she sat in the corridor connecting the main halls, munching on some strawberries she had previously stashed away. Eating fruit in the cold winter was still a bit chilly.

She pulled out a steaming cup of hazelnut taro milk tea. The warm liquid slid down her throat, a delightful experience that made her feel bubbly with joy.

Unable to resist, Luo Bingtang flashed into her space, gazing at the pile of antiques and jewelry she had just collected. Looking into the mirror she yelled, “Hey, is there anything in here you can eat?”

“I already ate,” came the quick reply.

Luo Bingtang was taken aback. Just how long had it been hungry?

She circled around the display cases, but couldn’t find what had been eaten; there were simply too many items she had gathered.

“What about the others? Aren’t you going to eat them?” 

The remaining treasures in the display cases were many, her face full of questions.

“Not enough spiritual energy, not eating.”

“Can it upgrade?” she asked, hopeful.

“Insufficient spiritual energy, unable to upgrade.”

Feeling quite dejected, Luo Bingtang realized that despite running around all day, she hadn’t found much to satisfy her needs.

Seeing that the mirror’s text no longer changed, she guessed that it wasn’t too happy either. After all, she tended to be a bit irritable and unfriendly when she was hungry.

Deciding to leave the space and head back, she noticed that the days were short in winter; it was barely past six when darkness began to descend.

No longer hesitating, Luo Bingtang closed the Treasure Museum doors behind her and drove back.

As she turned the corner, she spotted a few figures in the distance, frantically running away from a group of zombies.

Luo Bingtang rubbed her forehead. The little saint was truly something; she had risked the lives of four innocent people to save one.

So, in the apocalypse, the first rule should be to eliminate the saints—remember this golden rule.
