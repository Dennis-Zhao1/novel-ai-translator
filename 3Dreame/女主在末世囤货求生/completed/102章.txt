**Dream of Slaying Beasts**

The war had come to an end, but the aftermath was giving everyone a headache. The pile of corpses had risen nearly to the height of the city wall, which stood twenty meters tall. Given that the width of a person was about thirty centimeters, it would take at least sixty-seven people stacked on top of each other to reach the top. Below, there were countless groups of sixty-seven stacked up. Great, the main gate was completely blocked.

After sending the injured and exhausted teammates to the medical station, Ice Luo and a few others stood atop the city wall, scratching their heads, trying to come up with a solution. Someone suggested they just step on the zombies to get down, one by one, breaking heads as they went. Immediately, there were voices of dissent—too slow! With thousands of zombies to deal with, how long would it take to dig through them all?

Clearing the bodies was only part of the problem. In the past, when there were fewer corpses, they could just set them on fire. But now? Burning them all together? Who could stand that smell?

As everyone argued back and forth, Ice Luo felt a headache coming on. Finally, Uncle Zhu brought a regular survivor over to report. This survivor was from a scientific institute specializing in energy research. He had already modified a waste incineration power generation device but hadn’t had the chance to test it. They could use the corpses as fuel for a trial run.

Moreover, to stay away from water sources, the incineration furnace and power generation unit were set up in a nearby mountain, where a military base had once designed a vertical underground passageway. However, the project had been abandoned before completion, and now it could be put to use. The chimney for the furnace was already installed, towering above the mountain, and thanks to the wind direction, the smoke wouldn’t blow towards the fortress.

It was practically perfect! The group calmed down, leaving the less fatigued ability users to keep watch while the others returned to clean up and rest.

By the time Ice Luo finished washing up in her space and had a good sleep, the others who had participated in the battle were still catching up on rest. Liu Xiaohui came over to report that all regular survivors had been notified to stay indoors and avoid the main gate. They would only come out when the bell rang at the cafeteria for meals, a precaution against further accidents.

Nodding in approval of her emergency measures, Ice Luo noted that the main gate was indeed not open and there was no need for further explanation. It was better for everyone to stay put inside and avoid trouble.

Fully revitalized, she made her way toward the main gate. The sheer number of corpses was overwhelming, and if they didn’t clear them soon, the stench would be unbearable. Summer was approaching, and temperatures were rising. She certainly didn’t want the fortress to be filled with the odor of decay.

The ability users, who were barely holding their positions, watched her approach with renewed energy, silently praising her strength. Ice Luo waved them off, letting them rest, assuring them she would keep watch until the next shift arrived.

Many weapons still lay uncollected in their original positions, and with a wave of her hand, she gathered them all up. Suddenly, she remembered she needed to ask Uncle Zhu how to replenish the ammunition for the firearms team. They had spent a fortune assembling them, and she didn’t want that investment to go to waste after just a few uses.

Peering down at the pile of corpses, she noticed some were still moving. She quickly conjured several ice spikes, realizing that descending directly into the pile posed a risk. If a zombie was merely trapped beneath the weight of others and hadn’t sustained any brain damage, it could still bite her!

Getting bitten would be a huge loss.

It would be better to have an earth ability user create a staircase. This way, it would be both safe and efficient. 

As she contemplated this, a figure suddenly emerged from the trees. Ice Luo’s eyes widened as she locked onto the figure—it was the hoodie-wearing zombie she had just seen among the corpses. Its grotesque face and dark eye sockets sent chills down her spine.

The zombie’s gaze fixed directly on her, as if an invisible hand were reaching into her mind. A wave of blankness washed over her, and Ice Luo cursed under her breath. She quickly reminded herself to look away—she couldn’t let herself fall victim again.

As if sensing her struggle, the zombie’s mouth curled into a sinister smile from beneath the hoodie. Ice Luo felt her control slipping away. With a thought, she dove into her spatial realm.

The zombie, witnessing her disappear into thin air, let out a furious, vengeful howl, clearly enraged that it could no longer track her.

At that moment, Xie Jinghang appeared on the city wall, witnessing Ice Luo’s sudden vanishing act, then turning to see the howling zombie below. He unleashed a series of lightning strikes, hitting the hoodie-wearing zombie, which could not dodge the attack. After taking several jolts of electricity, the zombie, realizing it couldn’t get closer to the gate, retreated in frustration.

Xie Jinghang was unaware of what Ice Luo had encountered. Her entering the spatial realm in such a location, combined with the zombie’s strange behavior, suggested a connection. 

In his previous life, he had never faced such a large-scale zombie siege but had encountered similar situations. He could only wait until she reappeared to ask what had happened.

Resolved to guard the city wall for her, he leaned against the wall and rested.

However, as night fell, Ice Luo still hadn’t reappeared. He knew the flow of time in her space was extremely slow. Even so, one or two hours should have been enough for her to return. It seemed she had encountered something serious. In his mind, he called out to the noisy spirit.

“Host, I’m here.”

“Can you contact Xuanjing?”

“Wah, wah, wah! I can’t reach him! You’re not in the secret realm, so I can’t contact Big Brother Xuanjing. The secret realm blocks all signals!”

“I really miss Big Brother Xuanjing. Why don’t you ask the little fairy to take you in? If you go in, I can too. It will be a nice break!”

“Shut up, useless chatterbox! You’re good for nothing, just a blabbermouth!”

Xie Jinghang silenced the annoying system, having to rely on patience to wait. The ability users who came up to relieve the guard cast curious glances at him. Was it normal for a big shot like him to sleep on the city wall?

Meanwhile, Ice Luo was suffering from a splitting headache. Entering her space only heightened her discomfort, as if her brain were being mercilessly tortured by needles and axes. Blood began to drip from her nose, and soon, blood flowed from all seven orifices. She couldn’t even read the messages from Xuanjing before collapsing to the ground.

In her unconscious state, Ice Luo experienced a long, vivid dream—one of her childhood days spent learning classical Chinese literature with her grandfather, when she was only three or four years old and had first begun to form memories.

At that time, her parents were alive and very much in love. Her father was talented and capable, running the company her grandfather had passed down to him and often traveling abroad to expand new business ventures. Each time he visited a new country, he would bring her back souvenirs.

Her mother was gentle and beautiful, a painter who often depicted scenes of her and her father. Though she excelled at traditional landscape painting, her love for them was paramount.

The time spent together as a family of four was the happiest period of her life.

But then, the sudden loss of both parents was jarring.

Her grandfather told her that their deaths were an accident, thrusting her, still under ten, into a harsh reality.

Her childhood memories replayed in her mind like a film, the pain she had buried during her growth resurfacing vividly, too real to escape.

Then, the scenes flickered: the terror of being kidnapped at eighteen in a foreign country, the dread of facing a zombie apocalypse, the guilt and sorrow of losing Meng Ge while being protected, the rage at being violated and humiliated by her fiancé, the resentment of being tortured by a woman who inexplicably hated her, the bitterness at being used while mistaking a thief as a father—all of it morphed into a monstrous beast that descended upon her from the heavens, its gaping maw threatening to swallow her whole.

Ice Luo watched helplessly as the beast charged at her, leaving her unable to fight back.

She wanted to resist, reminding herself that those who had violated, humiliated, and tortured her were already dead—she had killed them with her own hands. She would also eliminate the mastermind behind all her suffering.

Just as she felt paralyzed, she suddenly took a step back, a sword appearing in her hand—an exquisite sword, which she gripped tightly. With her spiritual energy surging, she infused it into the blade and leaped into the air, charging directly at the incoming beast with a fearless determination.

With one decisive strike, the monstrous beast roared in agony, shattering into countless fragments that scattered like brilliant rays across the sky.
