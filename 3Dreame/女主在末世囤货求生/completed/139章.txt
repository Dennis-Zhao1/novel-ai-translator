**No Regrets in Being Hit**

Zhu Yidan had long given up on knocking on the van door, contemplating whether to just blast the window with a fireball instead. Just as she raised her hand, she was stopped by Xie Jinghang. She thought he might be reluctant to let her bully Bai Lianwei, considering their earlier behavior hadn’t exactly screamed normal relationship. Ha, as if he’d care.

Before she could release the fireball, she noticed the frantic Bai Lianwei trembling as if electrocuted. She slid off her seat and collapsed to the floor. The others in the van, witnessing her sudden fall, hastily pressed the button to open the door for her to come aboard.

Zhu Yidan was taken aback. Bai Lianwei’s lightning abilities were already so finely tuned that she could control them with precision. It was more than just admiration; she felt a pang of envy.

After calling the driver and another team member to lift the incapacitated driver onto the last row of seats, Xie Jinghang finally approached the driver's seat to deal with Bai Lianwei. 

In a moment of desperation, he had used a small amount of his powers, and after a brief bout of unconsciousness, Bai Lianwei managed to pull herself up. The first thing she did was lunge for the control panel, desperately shielding the door opening button.

Zhu Yidan couldn’t hold back her anger any longer. She had seen teammates betray each other before, and she had encountered those who were downright devious, but never anyone so foolish and malicious. The thought of Bai Lianwei staying at the fortress for a few days and needing her abilities awakened made her stomach churn.

With a grim face, Zhu Yidan shot a look at Xie Jinghang, whose expression was even worse. It ignited her fury as she questioned him, “Xie Jinghang, get it straight! This woman has no morals or conscience—she lives off her looks! Is she really worth wasting resources on to awaken her abilities at the fortress?”

“Don’t you worry that she’ll cause even more trouble for others once she gains her powers? Come on, open your eyes and see!” 

Xie Jinghang paused, then replied calmly, “Sending her there was Pei Qian’s decision, and the payment has already been made.”

Zhu Yidan was furious, spitting out, “What a scumbag! Neither of you are worth a dime!”

The people in the van were equally outraged. Some were still in the dark about what had happened, but now that they realized the unconscious driver’s condition was caused by Bai Lianwei, those with tempers were rolling up their sleeves, ready to confront her. The principle of not hitting women had long been thrown out the window.

Bai Lianwei, finally recovering her composure, began her pitiful act, weeping like a rain-soaked pear blossom, claiming her fear. She repeatedly insisted she hadn’t meant to hurt anyone and expressed her shock that the driver was an ability user who could be so easily injured.

Her melodramatic display of innocence was enough to sway some of the people who were unaware of the truth, as they remembered her previous behavior at the base, where she had cultivated a somewhat sympathetic image. Zhu Yidan, rage boiling inside her, felt the urge to leap over Xie Jinghang and attack Bai Lianwei.

“You scheming little actress! Let’s see how well you can perform when your hypocritical mask is ripped off!”

Seeing Zhu Yidan seething, Xie Jinghang hurriedly gestured for the vice-captain to step in. The vice-captain, equally helpless, couldn’t bear to see women at each other's throats; it gave him a headache.

He swiftly carried Zhu Yidan back into the modified vehicle, leaving her sputtering, “You… you…!” without any further words.

Xie Jinghang left one teammate to drive while assigning a rock-based teammate to accompany them. He ignored Bai Lianwei, even when she requested to board the modified vehicle, acting as if he hadn’t heard her at all.

With the situation escalating, allowing her onto the modified vehicle would mean Zhu Yidan could incinerate her.

They wrapped up the chaos and signaled to hit the road quickly; the longer they delayed, the later they would return to the fortress.

Once in the passenger seat, Zhu Yidan fumed from the back, “Honestly, you’re not actually falling for that scheming b*tch, are you?”

Xie Jinghang looked at her like she was insane, not bothering to respond as he gestured for the vice-captain to drive. Ignored, Zhu Yidan straightened up, glaring at him.

“What’s with the silence? Feeling guilty? Just wait until I tell Bingting on you!”

Xie Jinghang rubbed his temples, feeling exasperated. Both women were relentless, but he patiently explained, “We can’t kill her yet. Sending her to the fortress is meant to draw out whoever is behind her.”

Only then did Zhu Yidan begin to understand. So there was a deeper layer to this—she had thought these two men had lost their minds over a pretty face. Her focus shifted as she contemplated who this mysterious figure might be.

Finally, it quieted down. The vice-captain and Xie Jinghang exchanged glances, both sighing in resignation.

The journey continued, stopping several times to clear out the zombies that had been attracted along the way. The van doors remained shut after that.

Perhaps they were too scared; Bai Lianwei didn’t act out again. Instead, she obediently nestled in the first row of seats, dutifully maintaining her image as the innocent little flower, and managed to persuade quite a few oblivious men to defend her.

By the time they reached the fortress, it was already afternoon. Anmin was stationed at the watchtower with his team, spotting Xie Jinghang’s vehicle in the distance and excitedly notifying Luo Bingtin via the intercom.

Meanwhile, Luo Bingtin was busy training Wang Xinxin. Recently, Wang Xinxin had been progressing rapidly, even participating in a real mission with Meng Ge. The team had been praising her, remarking how different a disciple of Luo Bingtin was.

Upon hearing that Xie Jinghang had arrived with a van full of people, Luo Bingtin gathered Wang Xinxin and the other new ability users in training, driving to the gate.

A group of over a dozen stood on the city wall, peering down. Luo Bingtin quickly spotted Xie Jinghang, and remembering their rather awkward public relationship, she signaled for her team to put on a show.

Zhu Yidan, seizing her moment, began to act, fully embracing the drama. The few who knew the real story buried their faces, unable to watch the spectacle.

Yet, those unaware of the truth were captivated; no matter the time, dramatic conflict always drew attention.

“Miss Luo, we are sisters at the end of the day. Since Mr. Xie has chosen me, you should be magnanimous. After all, you two never really started anything, right?” Zhu Yidan said loudly, her tone theatrical. If not for her exaggerated quiver at the end, her performance might have been more convincing—better than some internet celebrities before the apocalypse, at least.

“Hmph, what nonsense is that? Your affairs with him have nothing to do with me. What do you mean by being magnanimous? Don't spout words that make no sense,” Luo Bingtin retorted coldly, feeling utterly indifferent, yet those around her interpreted it as a fierce rivalry between two women vying for the same man.

“Oh come on, that’s just boring. Miss Luo, if you say it’s no big deal, then it’s no big deal, right?” 

Just then, Bai Lianwei emerged from the van and walked over to Xie Jinghang, whispering sweetly, “Big Brother Xie, what’s going on? Why is Miss Zhu arguing with someone?”

Bai Lianwei didn’t recognize Luo Bingtin at all, but the sharp-eyed Luo Bingtin instantly remembered her as the one who had so generously shared others’ misfortunes and had a penchant for melodrama. The last time she saw her was at the Fenglin base when she was whisked away by a group of wealthy young masters. She hadn’t expected her to end up at Longxiang Base and come here with Xie Jinghang—was this to awaken her abilities?

Now, she found herself in the audience, amused as she watched the exchange between Zhu Yidan and Bai Lianwei. Just as she decided it was time to let them in, she instructed Anmin to prepare to open the door, only to witness the two women break into a physical altercation.

To be precise, it was one-sided; Zhu Yidan had held in her anger all the way back and couldn’t take it anymore. With a slap, she delivered a stinging blow to Bai Lianwei’s face.

“Ah! How dare you hit me?”

Bai Lianwei clutched her face, and instead of retaliating, she looked up with tear-filled eyes at the nearby man, her voice weak and trembling, “Big Brother Xie…”

Luo Bingtin raised an eyebrow at this. Oh, so there’s more to this scene?
