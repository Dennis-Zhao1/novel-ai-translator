**The White Lotus Enters the Scene**

Zhu Yidan fixed her gaze on the complex expressions of those around her, calmly sipping her tea while her inner thoughts bubbled over with frustration. Ugh, what era is this? Why are we still playing by the rules of the main wife? Enough already—the Qing Dynasty is long gone!

Péi Qián sure knows how to charm women. Could it be that besides Péi Shàng, there are others too? No way, no way, please no... Péi Shàng, he’s onto you!

Her eyes darted between Xie Jinghang, Péi Qián, and Péi Shàng. Xie Jinghang seemed to catch on to her thoughts and covered his smile with another sip of tea.

The dinner party quickly wrapped up, and everyone went back to rest. Little did they know, a dramatic scene was unfolding away from their sight.

“Hey, big brother, is what you said true?” 

Little White Lotus was intercepted by a naive youth on her way back to her dorm. They spoke in a secluded storage room, and Little White Lotus gasped, covering her mouth in surprise.

Just a few hours had passed, and this naive guy was already spilling a huge secret. Unfortunately for him, she already knew, but she had to keep up appearances to maintain her persona.

“It’s true, Little Wei. If I awaken my powers, will you agree to be my girlfriend? I know I have nothing right now and don’t deserve you, but I hope you’ll give me a chance.”

Inside, Little White Lotus felt a wave of impatience. At least he had a bit of self-awareness, but not enough. She smiled gently, appearing touched as she replied, “Big brother, I see your sincerity and determination. But please, don’t say it’s for me; it puts too much pressure on me. I hope you only focus on getting better. You’ve always been so excellent! You’re a brave, honest, and kind boy, worthy of all the good things in life. Promise me, don’t belittle yourself, okay? It makes me feel bad too.”

The naive youth, flattered by her praise, couldn’t help but grin widely, nodding enthusiastically without realizing that Little White Lotus had agreed to nothing. He continued, lost in his own thoughts, “Don’t worry, Little Wei! I will become a powerful ability user and confess to you properly!”

After saying that, he waved cheerfully at her, marching off in a goofy manner.

The moment he turned away, Little White Lotus couldn’t help but change her expression, muttering under her breath, “He doesn’t even take a good look at himself. A powerful ability user? As if he could match Xie Jinghang or Péi Qián. Dream on! What a broke loser trying to court swans.”

It seemed that cursing and venting her frustrations eased her discomfort. After a while, she emerged from the storage room, once again the serene and independent Little White Lotus.

Surprisingly, she had her fair share of admirers. At Longxiang Base, the ratio of women to men was already low, and aside from a few family members, the rest were single men. Among the unmarried beauties, Anna stood out, but her icy demeanor intimidated most.

Then there was Lin Weiwei, soft and fragile, with no powers. She spoke sweetly, looking pure and beautiful with her baby face that hadn’t lost its charm. 

Thanks to the strict rules at Longxiang Base, Lin Weiwei had the backing of her cousin, making everyone treat her with respect and courtesy.

But that was precisely what bothered Lin Weiwei. Despite her flirting, there were hardly any powerful figures willing to act on her behalf. That naive boy was the only one who had openly declared his feelings, which was a blow to her ego.

She had already secured her spot at the apocalypse fortress. Xie Jinghang was even more perfect for her standards in men. With that in mind, it was better not to be too entangled at Longxiang Base; otherwise, her carefully crafted persona might just collapse.

Remembering her mission, she squeezed her wrist, letting her confidence fade for a moment as she walked down the dim hallway. Upon reaching her dorm door, she put on her smile again, knocking lightly before stepping into the four-person room, her resolve becoming stronger. She had to win over Xie Jinghang and secure her place in the apocalypse fortress, wanting nothing more than to escape sharing a dorm with anyone else.

Having only spent a day and a night at Longxiang Base, Xie Jinghang and his team were set to leave the next day. He had other arrangements, and before departing, Little White Lotus made sure to send him off, pretending her beloved was going away, leaving her behind in loneliness.

Zhu Yidan couldn’t be bothered to watch this crude and cliché drama unfold. She left first and sat in the vehicle. Xie Jinghang offered Little White Lotus a half-hearted smile, which was enough to make her blush and act all flustered again.

The vice-captain and the others pretended not to see, looking up at the sky, giving Little White Lotus the perfect opportunity to finish her little performance before they made their escape.

Meanwhile, Little White Lotus called after him, “Xie Ge, I’ll be waiting for you to pick me up in five days. Don’t forget about Weiwei!”

Unbeknownst to her, a man standing in the crowd, veins bulging in his eyes and fists clenched tightly, was staring daggers at Little White Lotus and Xie Jinghang’s retreating figures.

**Inside the Apocalypse Fortress**

“Miss Luo, when can I get the awakening serum?” 

Fù Kuāndàn, like a sycophant, followed Luo Bingtian around. After a few days of thorough physical examinations, he thought he would get the serum immediately and become a powerful ability user. However, days passed, and aside from learning that his father had no response, nothing else came of it.

Anxiety bubbled within him, but looking at Luo Bingtian, she didn’t seem like someone who would go back on her word. After all, she had treated him so well these past few days; the food was even better than what he had at Kunshan Base.

He couldn’t quite understand why anyone would want to betray or leave the apocalypse fortress when there was such a fantastic cafeteria—wasn’t that enough?

Of course, he wasn’t a glutton, but even he had been won over.

“Why the rush? It’s just a matter of time. Why not relax and wait?” 

While walking, Luo Bingtian handled daily reports from Liu Xiaohui. After finishing, she stopped to tell Liu Xiaohui, “Compile a list of those who passed the physical exam. Let’s set thirty slots aside, prioritizing the guard team and young adults.”

Liu Xiaohui understood her intentions and set off to arrange it.

Seeing her about to leave, Fù Kuāndàn called out, “Don’t forget me! Make sure I’m on the list!”

In truth, Luo Bingtian couldn’t stand his antics. Ever since he entered the fortress, he’d been putting on a show, and she found it painful to watch. Rubbing her temples, she instructed him to take it easy and not wander around while she headed to the lab.

In the lab, they had produced over fifty awakening serums using the previous materials, all sealed in the storage room. Luo Bingtian was there not only to discuss post-injection monitoring with Dr. Zhang but also to delve into research on enhanced ability users and Wu Xiaogang’s case.

She had always believed Wu Xiaogang had undergone enhancement, but why didn’t he exhibit any signs of zombification? This puzzled her greatly.

Upon seeing the batch of enhanced ability users, she finally understood why Wu Xiaogang felt so out of place—not just because of his powers, but also due to his crystal core.
