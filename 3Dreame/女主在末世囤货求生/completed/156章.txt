Awakening

After carefully placing Xie Jinghang onto the bed in the bedroom, Luo Bingtin looked around. The room was impeccably clean, as expected; dust never dared to settle here, and the bed linens remained pristine and neatly arranged. 

Luo Bingtin reached out to touch Xie Jinghang's forehead, only to find his pale cheeks glistening with beads of sweat. He didn’t have a fever; in fact, his temperature felt a bit low. His brows were slightly furrowed, and his lips were tightly pressed together, indicating that he was not feeling well. 

She examined the scars on his arms closely; they were still a dark, deep crimson, and the veins on his arms had taken on a purplish hue, suggesting that he was suffering from severe poisoning. 

Luo Bingtin gave him a bit of lake water to drink, then stepped outside to consult the system about his condition.

"Don’t worry, little fairy! The host is fine; that little bit of poison is nothing—just let him sleep it off!" 

The noisy spirit and the long-missed Brother Xuanjing were catching up when Luo Bingtin interrupted them. Although the noisy spirit dared to challenge Xie Jinghang, it wouldn’t dare to confront Luo Bingtin—after all, she was the master of Brother Xuanjing. It was too late to curry favor; it certainly didn’t want to risk its own life.

Seeing the noisy spirit's reassurances, Luo Bingtin felt a wave of relief wash over her; the heavy feelings that had been weighing her down lightened considerably. 

She remembered how someone had sacrificed for her in her past life—Meng Ge had made her feel guilty for a long time, and now Xie Jinghang’s situation was forcing her to relive those emotions. 

It really wasn’t pleasant.

Given the difference in flow between the space and the outside world, she had no idea when Xie Jinghang would wake up. So, she grabbed his satellite phone and quickly stepped out of the space to call Meng Ge.

"Meng Ge, how’s everything on your end? No issues, right?"

"Little Miss, everything is fine here. Don’t worry. How’s the fortress doing?"

"It’s okay. Can you pass the phone to Dr. Zhang?"

"Sure, I’ll wake him up—hold on a moment."

Moments later, Dr. Zhang’s groggy voice came through the line. 

"Miss Luo, what’s happened?"

"Xie Jinghang is injured from a mutated plant. I administered an antidote and X drug, but his condition isn't great. He’s sweating cold and has a low temperature. Do you have any good remedies?"

"So serious? The antidote has been upgraded and optimized; it should effectively neutralize standard zombie viruses. The X drug is on him, so typical poisons shouldn’t be an issue. However, if he doesn’t improve in three hours, it could become problematic."

"Are there any other options?"

"Do you have any samples of the mutated plant? I think Xiao Lu and I can make it back in time."

Dr. Zhang was about to call Xiao Lu into action when Luo Bingtin interrupted him.

"Don’t rush off on your own; it’s safer to stay with everyone. I’ll find a way to handle Xie Jinghang’s situation. I’ll inform you when it’s safe to return, and then you can arrange to come back. Please pass the phone back to Meng Ge; thanks."

"Little Miss, something has happened to Brother Xie? Are you alright?"

Meng Ge must have overheard part of the conversation, sounding a bit anxious.

"Yeah, he was injured while protecting me, but I’m fine. Listen, if nothing else unusual happens at the fortress by dawn tomorrow, I’ll notify you, and you can come back. Until then, keep everyone safe, especially the researchers. Don’t go anywhere."

"Understood."

Luo Bingtin didn’t say much more before hanging up. She found An Min and Uncle Zhu, instructing them to clean up after the battle and arrange a duty roster before heading back to rest. Once back in her dorm, she entered her space again.

Xie Jinghang was still in the same state, with cold sweat dotting his forehead and his lips growing paler. His breathing had become much lighter. Seeing this, Luo Bingtin felt a sense of urgency and quickly went out to find the noisy spirit.

"Do you have any antidote items over there?"

"Little fairy, the host is really fine! You have to believe me; just let him lie there. Why don’t we three chat? It’s rare for us to be together. Shall we play some card games?"

The screen was filled with subtitles sent by the noisy spirit. Brother Xuanjing chimed in as well.

"Don’t worry; I’ve checked him. He’s okay."

"Right? If you don’t believe me, how can you not believe Brother Xuanjing? Come on, let’s chat and play cards! I've got some juicy gossip to share about our..."

Luo Bingtin finally understood Xie Jinghang’s helplessness. With such a chatty system around, it was impressive that someone as reserved as Xie Jinghang could tolerate it for so long.

To occupy her time and distract herself from the pale-faced man, she found some chores to do, forcing her mind away from worrying.

After collecting all the eggs from the grass—chicken, duck, and goose eggs—neatly packing them into boxes, she realized that not much time had passed.

She practiced her new skill, Ice Barrier, realizing there was still a lot of room for improvement in the speed of releasing this area-of-effect attack. She thought about ways to combine it with other skills for different attack methods, which could lead to explosive damage.

Thinking of Xie Jinghang, she boiled some hot water to bring to him, grabbing a towel to wipe the cold sweat from his forehead.

Suddenly, she felt utterly incompetent at taking care of someone. It dawned on her that she hadn’t even taken off Xie Jinghang's shoes. Embarrassed, she shook her head. She had always been the one being taken care of; it wasn't intentional.

Feeling a bit slow on the uptake, she finally removed his shoes and tossed them aside, contemplating whether to cover him with a blanket. However, the temperature in the space was quite pleasant—not too cold or hot—so she decided it was fine not to.

Less trouble was better than more trouble.

In a matter of moments, she wiped down Xie Jinghang’s face, head, and hands, and he looked much more refreshed. With a clear conscience, she stepped outside.

After enduring a long night of fuss, she was feeling tired. Looking at the only bed she had, she decided to curl up on the sofa for a nap.

It wasn’t that she couldn’t sleep outside, but she was worried about what might happen if something went wrong.

Fortunately, when she woke up, Xie Jinghang was also regaining consciousness. He noticed the distinct scar on his arm; it had faded from dark red to a lighter red, and the wound didn’t hurt anymore. The area around it had a faint brown tint, indicating it had been disinfected with iodine.

As he surveyed his surroundings, a sense of familiarity washed over him, yet everything felt strange. The house seemed fine, but the furnishings were all off.

Finally, spotting the words “Museum” made him understand. He got up, put on his shoes, and stepped outside, only to find Luo Bingtin asleep on the sofa.

He couldn’t help but chuckle. Only she could pull off something so quirky, having brought her house into this space. Remembering his own dark, empty space, he couldn’t help but scold the noisy spirit in his mind.

Oh right, the noisy spirit was probably ecstatic now; it had been pestering him to let it back into the space to play with Brother Xuanjing. Now it had finally gotten its wish, no wonder it hadn’t responded to his calls.

Luo Bingtin was a light sleeper. As soon as she sensed someone watching her, she jolted awake and saw Xie Jinghang standing there, fully intact. She shot up in excitement, quickly slipping into her cute slippers and hurriedly walking over.

"You’re alright? How do you feel? Is there anywhere else that hurts?"

"I’m fine now, so don’t worry. The antidote worked effectively."

As Xie Jinghang observed Luo Bingtin, he spoke in a soothing tone that he didn’t even realize was tender.

"Not just the antidote; there was also the lake water. I fed you that several times! At first, you were clenching your lips so tight I nearly couldn’t get it down your throat."

Luo Bingtin murmured, teasing him lightly. Xie Jinghang fell silent for a moment before nodding. As a special forces soldier, he had learned during training that it was best to keep his mouth tightly shut when unconscious—who knew what enemies might pour into him.
