**Twists and Turns**

Before Luo Biting and the others could voice any suggestions or opinions, Captain Xie and his deputy had already removed the grenade and secured it to the marked wall. 

Meng Ge guarded Luo Biting as they retreated to a safe distance from the blast radius, while the others quickly found their spots, waiting for the explosion. 

Moments later, a loud boom echoed through the room, sending a cloud of dust swirling around. The ceiling's panels were blown off in a large section, revealing the sealed exhaust ducts. 

The wall had exploded, yet it felt as if it hadn't at all; everyone was left feeling helpless. The interior of the laboratory was constructed entirely from metal, and what lay exposed behind the blasted wall was solid metal. 

Luo Biting fired two shots at it, and to her disappointment, even the bullets hardly left a mark—there were barely any scratches. It was impressively sturdy. 

After coming this far, they had hit a dead end. Captain Xie was equally frustrated; neither the bomb nor the bullets had made any significant impact on the metal walls, and it was uncertain if the people inside could even hear the commotion. 

Luo Biting looked up at the swirling dust, trying to avoid getting covered in it, when her gaze fell upon the exhaust duct. Wasn’t there usually a scene like this in movies? 

Typically, when the female lead is trying to escape monsters or pursuers, she would use such ventilation ducts. She wondered if these were as reliable as in the films. 

Captain Xie noticed the young girl staring at the ceiling, deep in thought. Her eyes sparkled with intelligence, even in the dim lighting. He couldn't help but think how breathtaking she must look in sunlight, radiating with brilliance. 

Following her gaze, he also spotted the key point, and couldn't help but mentally commend her cleverness. 

Meanwhile, Luo Biting had already pulled Meng Ge aside to discuss in hushed tones. Captain Xie didn’t catch all of it, but he did hear the key word: ventilation duct. 

In a closed space like this underground laboratory, good ventilation was crucial. Given the lab's importance and sealed nature, an efficient ventilation system was a must. 

Meng Ge nodded, quickly organizing the team to get moving. Captain Xie stepped forward, sharing his thoughts, and they coincidentally aligned. 

At that moment, Luo Biting finally understood; she looked at Captain Xie with suspicion. From the explosion to the mention of the ventilation duct, she doubted he was the type to meddle, except when it came to the troublesome survivors. 

But there was no time for such thoughts. The explosion had surely attracted nearby zombies, and the number was unknown. They needed to act quickly. 

Concerned about the ventilation duct, Luo Biting decided to take the lead. At only 165 cm and under 90 pounds, she was the lightest among them, making her the best fit for the task. If she couldn’t handle it, no one else would be able to. 

She pulled out a pair of non-slip gloves from her bag while Meng Ge and the others moved an office desk under the duct. 

After climbing up, she took a look and signaled for the tallest among them to help her remove the duct cover. 

Meng Ge and Captain Xie, being the two tallest, worked together to quickly pry off the cover. Once it was removed, Captain Xie handed Luo Biting a multi-tool knife for safety. 

Luo Biting hesitated for a moment at the sight of the knife. Should she take it? 

Thinking it was silly to be so hesitant, she took it after a brief pause. Meng Ge then carefully supported her, ensuring she made it into the vent safely. 

Captain Xie watched Meng Ge’s actions, feeling a twinge of discomfort. Where was he supposed to put his hands?! 

Despite his inner turmoil, his expression remained icy, though now his brow was even darker, giving off a forbidding aura. 

The teammates standing nearby sensed the sudden chill emanating from their captain and instinctively moved a bit farther away. 

Up above, Luo Biting had successfully entered the duct. She noticed the metal edges of the opening were slightly bent, likely from Meng Ge’s efforts. How thoughtful of him; otherwise, she could have scratched her arms. 

With her gloves on, she began to crawl inside, following the predicted layout and heading towards the right to find a branch. 

The laboratory was quite large, so she had to check each branch one by one. Fortunately, the duct was built from reinforced steel and special metal, providing decent support, though it wobbled slightly. 

At this height, falling wouldn’t be fatal, but it would be far from pleasant. To prevent any accidents, the rope tied around her waist was still in Meng Ge's hands. 

Captain Xie had also pre-set the walkie-talkie frequency for her, enabling her to communicate any issues as they arose. 

Luo Biting activated her psychic perception, almost forgetting she had this skill. Instead of searching for branches, she could sense the presence of people. 

With a clear target in mind, she crawled forward. Her knees were a bit sore; she regretted not bringing knee pads. Thankfully, she was wearing long pants. Before she could finish her internal complaints, she heard voices nearby. 

The voices were soft and unclear, so she knocked on the duct cover to get their attention. It wasn’t particularly sturdy, so she adjusted her position and began to kick it. Lying down made it hard to get a good push, but after several firm kicks, the cover finally popped open. 

Peeking her head out, she was surprised to see quite a few people. 

A group of young researchers in white lab coats were huddled together, their flashlights shining up at her; they shielded their eyes, squinting against the blinding light. 

They looked fatigued and weak, but upon seeing her, their eyes lit up, as if a savior had appeared. 

Unfortunately, their family members were not among them; they must have been the researchers trapped in the lab previously. 

“Ah, sorry! Could you tell me where Dr. Zhu is?” 

Luo Biting shifted her flashlight away from their faces and turned to face them, not intending to climb down. If the door here was locked too, she’d have to crawl back and forth, and she wasn’t like An Min, brimming with energy. 

“He should be in the observation room with his family.” 

A female researcher spoke hoarsely. Luo Biting took one look at their state and hurriedly pulled out water and food from her bag, which was really from her spatial storage. 

She tossed down several bags of bread and chocolate. The moment they saw the food, they rushed to grab it. Next came the water; fearing the bottles might break, she had them hold onto the hem of their lab coats. 

One of the male researchers, still with some strength, received a few bottles of water but was panting heavily. Seeing their pitiful state, Luo Biting conjured more chocolate and candy from her spatial storage and tossed them down. 

As they began to eat, she turned to leave. Just as she was about to go, someone called out to her. 

“Miss, are you here to rescue Professor Zhu? Can you also take us with you? We are all his students!” 

Luo Biting turned back and said, “Don’t worry. I’ll come back to get you soon. There’s a rescue team outside, but they can’t come in just yet. You all eat and regain your strength.” 

Quickly, she turned and crawled away, using her psychic power to continue searching. After a while, she sensed another presence; this time, she crawled with renewed vigor, thinking she might have heard Zhu Yidan’s voice. 

After another ten minutes of crawling, clear voices echoed down the duct, confirming that Zhu Yidan was indeed speaking. 

“Dad, drink some water. Don’t worry about us; Grandpa and Uncle will definitely send someone to rescue us. We can hold on.” 

She finished with a sob, and Zhu's older brother and sister echoed her sentiments in hushed tones. Luo Biting shouted, “You little brat, I’m here to rescue you! Stop crying; it sounds terrible!” 

Zhu Yidan, thinking she was hearing things, suddenly looked up. 

Sure enough, she saw a light shining from the ceiling, followed by the sound of someone climbing. With a thud, the duct cover was kicked open. 

Luo Biting poked her head out and greeted Zhu’s family of five below.
