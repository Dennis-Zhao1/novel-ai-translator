**Using Your Brain**

During lunchtime, I had my assistant bring back a business meal from the cozy diner across the street. After a hearty meal, I immediately dove into planning the next "auction." I was concerned that this approach might attract too much attention from people in my business circle, and if they discovered my massive cash-out, it would spell trouble. With time tight and the task heavy, creating a simple, direct, yet entertaining “game” became my top priority.

After a morning of intense work, I decided to take a short nap in the office's designated break room. To my surprise, I dreamt of my past life during the chaotic times when I first arrived at the Kunshan Base.

The Kunshan Base was spearheaded by a prominent family from the capital, comparable in wealth to the Smith family, and was a collaborative effort involving various forces. In its early days, everyone shared a common goal and worked together harmoniously. However, once the base's construction was completed and things started running smoothly, internal strife began to brew, leading to power struggles, factional disputes, and various forms of covert and overt conflicts.

I had witnessed the time at Kunshan Base when everyone worked as one, united in their mission to save survivors and improve their lives amidst disaster. My fondest memories were following the old steward to the main square of the base to trade supplies. I had no real needs, but I enjoyed seeing all the fascinating mutated plants and animals, luxurious items from before the apocalypse, and both rough and delicate handmade products. There were also stalls for barbecuing mutated animals, though the old steward never let me eat; just watching was enough to satisfy my curiosity.

The idea of “exchange” lingered in my mind, and it struck me—there were things I needed that I didn’t have to procure myself; I could trade for them! For instance, yachts and helicopters, plus some overseas connections my grandfather and father had. With that in mind, acquiring firearms didn’t seem out of reach either. As for military supplies, other prominent families in the capital certainly had their channels; as long as one played their cards right and stirred the waters just enough, it wouldn’t be hard to reel in some fish.

Suddenly, my sleepiness vanished. I picked up my phone and posted on my social media. The content was about the ancient castle my father had planned to gift me but never had the chance to. I hesitated before sharing it; my father passed away when I was just under ten, and he didn’t leave me many gifts. This castle was probably the most valuable one.

Was it appropriate to give away the castle like this? Emotions and reason wrestled within me. I thought about the global disaster that wiped out everyone and how, had my father still been alive, he would likely support my efforts to expand my survival resources. After all, a castle is just a castle; if it can’t be utilized, I might as well find a way to monetize it. I could always feel my father’s love, and after some contemplation, I decided to post it.

The message conveyed that I had just discovered an ancient castle at home, lamenting that I wasn’t a child anymore. While I loved it, leaving it empty felt like a waste. I also reminisced about my late father, expressing my gratitude for his love.

This post prompted a flurry of likes and comments from my elders on social media, with some even calling to offer their sympathies. By the evening, they had relayed the news to their own children and grandchildren, discussing how the Smith family’s girl was pitiable yet dutiful, often reflecting on her parents. When my grandfather was still alive, I was exceptionally obedient and sensible, a topic of pride for him—“Look at my granddaughter, so different from those brats!”

Those who saw my post were touched, while others who missed it were left in confusion. What had triggered the old folks? Reflecting on my behavior, I thought I had been quite responsible; I hadn’t caused any trouble or acted recklessly. I began to wonder if they were just looking for a reason to fuss.

Meanwhile, other young ladies from prominent families saw the castle photos and felt a pang of envy. The Smith family’s little princess truly lived up to her reputation—she had a castle, just like a Disney princess.

Soon, some of them began to have ulterior motives. Buying it was out of the question for them, but if there was something they desired, they would find a way to get it, regardless of the cost. I recognized that mindset all too well; I had cast the bait, and now it was time to wait for the fish to bite.

The castle my father had chosen was indeed remarkable, located in a beautiful country in Europe with stunning scenery and a pleasant climate—an ideal spot for travel photography. It was the only one that was well-preserved and maintained, eligible for sale. Without permission, no one was allowed to take photos or profit off it, making the majority of people unaware of its true nature, though its fame was undeniable. Today was the first time many learned that the castle belonged to the little princess of the Smith family.

Many were puzzled—why hadn’t anyone come to lay claim to it, especially since the Smith family was down to just this one little orphan? The family line had seen better days, after all. This had much to do with my grandfather’s network. After losing his son and daughter-in-law, he took over the family business, managing it even better than before, and raised me to be an excellent and sensible granddaughter.

There were few who could protect me from harm, but their influence was substantial. Many of them were still linked by mutual interests. In my past life, I had not truly connected with the network my grandfather had created for me, but I appreciated their care.

Regardless of what my grandfather had promised or sacrificed in the past, the fact that they hadn’t turned their backs on me after his passing was proof enough that they were worthwhile families to be involved with. As the apocalypse loomed, I didn’t mind revealing some of my connections as a means to repay their kindness.

With that thought, I opened up the list of investments again, carefully examining it. Combining it with my memories from my past life, I genuinely found some valuable connections. I realized that if I carelessly transferred my shares, it would definitely raise suspicions. Since we were all stakeholders, it might be better to plan together—though that could wait.

I needed to quickly liquidate my wholly-owned businesses without wasting time or energy; every minute was as precious as gold right now.

“Gold.”

That thought reminded me of when I first acknowledged Mr. Johnson as my godfather. He had pursued me at one point, and during a drunken moment, he revealed that our swift connections with the prominent families in the capital and the establishment of the Kunshan Base relied heavily on a stockpile of gold and jewelry that had opened doors for us. We had swiftly secured a majority of the essential survival goods and gathered a large number of ability users. Wealth could indeed move mountains, but what if we lost it all?

My thoughts drifted before I quickly pulled myself back.

For some reason, after my rebirth, my way of thinking had completely changed from before. But that didn’t matter; what mattered was achieving my goals swiftly and resolving any issues immediately.

In fact, when I sent out the “dowry items” that morning, I had already arranged for procurement under the names of various wholly-owned companies. It was routine for the company to handle purchases, send gifts, and collaborate, especially since the task came directly from me as the owner—there was little room for doubt.

I placed orders for basic survival goods in batches, arranging for them to be sent to a warehouse on a farm not far from the old residence. This was a strategic move on my part.

The city was riddled with surveillance, making it easy to attract unwanted attention. The old residence had a vast area with few people, all of whom were my own. There were no surveillance cameras, and with traffic coming and going, the residents wouldn’t notice what was being brought in or taken out.

This wasn’t my first time handling such operations. It allowed us to avoid city traffic restrictions while saving on significant warehouse costs. The farm had four large warehouses, and it was better to utilize them than leave them empty; effective resource management was key.
