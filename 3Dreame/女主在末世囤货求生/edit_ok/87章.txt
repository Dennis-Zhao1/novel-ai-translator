**The Reversal of Fate**

As Ethan was about to make a move, a nervous psychic from a secondary family branch leaned in close to Mike, whispering something urgent. Mike's face twisted from shock to anger as he turned to his uncle, Mr. Johnson. Without a moment's hesitation, he activated his powers and launched an attack.

Caught off guard, Uncle Johnson scrambled to dodge the sudden onslaught. Once he caught his breath, he began to fight back. Ivy Joy watched intently, curious about what had transpired during the negotiations that might concern her. She wasn't worried about her secret knowledge of the apocalyptic events being exposed; those were just excuses. But betrayal—now that was something she couldn't stand.

It seemed Uncle Johnson had no intention of involving her. The conflict quickly escalated into a battle between the secondary branch and the main family. It didn't take long for the numbers to show their advantage, with the main family being pushed back repeatedly. Many of the ordinary Johnson family members had never seen such violence before; some screamed for it to stop, while others fled in terror, fearing they would be caught in the crossfire.

"This is what a noble family looks like," Ivy thought, a smirk creeping onto her face despite the chaos.

Before long, the battle reached its conclusion, with the main family suffering a decisive defeat. The secondary branch reveled in their victory, capturing members of the main family. Mike boldly declared, “Hand over all the weapons from the armory!”

Uncle Johnson, injured and struggling to stand, was quickly pushed back down. Just then, Lily, who had been overlooked at first as she comforted her mother, suddenly erupted in anger. She hurled a fireball straight at Mike, who barely had time to react before it struck him, causing him to scream in agony. She continued her assault on the secondary branch psychics holding her relatives captive, finally managing to free them.

Mike’s face was scorched, his skin charred, and he roared in outrage, “You little brat! Your father is still in my hands. If you don’t behave, I’ll send him to meet his maker!”

It dawned on Lily that the people from the lab hadn’t appeared, and her second brother was also missing. No wonder her grandfather was unharmed, and Uncle Johnson had agreed to step down. Enraged, her powers surged as she prepared to fight back.

“Enough!” Uncle Johnson grunted through his pain. He was worried the other side would go too far; he held all the people from the lab in his hands. “Mike, I’ve given you everything you wanted; isn’t that enough?”

“Lies! The most cunning in the Johnson family is you! I see you’ve been setting a trap for us all along, waiting for us to walk right into it. You’ve hidden the weapons and the black box, just waiting for me to fall into your snare!” Mike was seething with rage, unable to sleep soundly knowing he had no weapons or the black box while constantly fearing a counterattack from the main family.

Uncle Johnson was taken aback by his outburst, realizing he had a point but choosing to remain silent. Lily, however, couldn’t hold back any longer. She shouted, “Where are my dad and the others? You heartless bastards! You’ve kidnapped my grandfather, and now you’ve taken my dad! Let them go!”

“Dream on! Hand over the weapons and the black box, or I’ll kill one person every ten minutes!” Mike commanded. The secondary branch had brought ropes to bind Uncle Johnson, Lily, and the others. Those who resisted were threatened with their family members. Looking around, she saw the patrol team and guards pointing guns at the ordinary members of the main family, most of whom were women and children.

Some of them also aimed their guns at Ivy and her team, but noticing she didn’t seem inclined to fight back, they held their positions. Uncle Johnson furrowed his brow, lost in thought, before suddenly turning to Ivy.

Receiving his gaze, Ivy blinked back at him. But Mike wasn’t so easily swayed; he ordered his men to start a countdown.

The bound psychics from the main family hurled insults, calling their captors heartless and treacherous, but Ivy sighed inwardly. This was all a result of the leniency shown by Grandpa Johnson and Uncle Johnson. The last time the fifth branch had sold the lab’s secrets to the rival base, they should have seen this coming.

Always believing they were in control, thinking they had everything figured out, the main family had failed to realize that the rules had changed. In this apocalypse, besides survival and interests, what else was there to discuss? The fate of traitors was grim.

“Are you going to tell us? Where are the weapons and the black box?” Mike demanded, grimacing as someone applied ointment to his wounds. He was shaking from the pain, his anger escalating with each pulse of agony.

“Stop making baseless accusations! Aren’t all the guards in the watchtower your people? You should know if I’ve done anything at all!” Ivy thought to herself, impressed by Uncle Johnson’s smooth maneuvering; in this case, he indeed had done nothing.

As the countdown reached zero, Mike randomly grabbed a hostage from the ordinary members—one of the youngest boys from the main family, under twelve years old. He was the only son of Uncle Johnson's fourth brother, who had no psychic powers and wasn’t a core member of the family before the apocalypse. Watching his son held at gunpoint, he began to cry out desperately.

“Fifth brother, save your nephew! Just give him what he wants!” Uncle Johnson’s face twisted with concern.

“Please, I truly haven’t moved the armory’s weapons! Just let the boy go; don’t pull him into this!” Uncle Johnson pleaded, his expression grave.

Mike eyed Uncle Johnson, unimpressed by his tough act. He shot the boy without hesitation, tossing the lifeless body aside. He then yanked Lily’s mother by the hair, dragging her before Uncle Johnson.

Seeing his son murdered, Uncle Johnson collapsed in shock. Meanwhile, Lily's older brother, who had yet to awaken his powers, rushed to protect his mother, only to be shot in the abdomen by Mike. It was unclear whether he was dead or alive.

“If your sister-in-law dies because of you, do you think your brother's family will ever forgive you?” Mike laughed cruelly, knowing the main family had always maintained a united front, pushing out secondary branches while proclaiming that they were one big family. But when it came down to it, they always chose sides.

“If you don’t speak up today, it will be your sister-in-law’s death that you caused!”

Lily, frozen in fear, could not shed any tears. With her back pressed against the ground, she raised her chin defiantly and screamed, “You monster! If you dare to kill my brother, I swear I’ll kill you!”

Mike merely scoffed, signaling his men to act.

Lily struggled fiercely, flames erupting from the ropes binding her. But before she could rise, secondary branch psychics restrained her with water and earth powers, pinning her to the ground.

Seeing her friend in distress made Ivy’s fingers twitch. She glanced over at Ethan, who was watching her closely. His expression was calm, completely unfazed by the tense atmosphere, which helped Ivy find her own sense of peace amidst the chaos.

Uncle Johnson closed his eyes for a moment, then suddenly looked up at Ivy. “I accept your terms.”

After a long day of witnessing this drama unfold, Ivy finally saw the moment she had been waiting for. It was time to bring this farce to an end.

With a swift motion, she raised her hand, and ice shards pierced Mike’s body, his scream echoing throughout the plaza.

Everyone stood shocked, not expecting Ivy to intervene in the Johnson family conflict.

Quickly, she took down a few more assailants and turned to Ethan and the others, shouting, “What are you all standing around for? Get to work!”

Ethan and the others were quick to react, rapidly dispersing and taking down every armed secondary branch member in sight.

The Smith family's fighters and their team members joined the fray, their coordinated combat training paying off. With abundant crystal power amplifying their abilities, they fought like seasoned warriors.

Even when the enemy fired their weapons, the bullets were blocked by earthen barriers created by the earth-based psychics, only to be followed up by Ethan’s lightning strikes.

Those trying to escape found themselves ensnared by vines conjured by the wood-based psychics, tumbling head over heels before being finished off by Ivy’s ice shards.

To the ordinary onlookers, it was a brutal display of power, with the psychics effortlessly overpowering their opponents.

In no time, the battle concluded, leaving the secondary branch members bound and bleeding, their earlier dominance turned on its head.

All weapons were confiscated and piled at Ivy’s feet.

Uncle Johnson broke free of his bindings, clutching his wounds as he rose to his feet, his gaze shifting from the defeated secondary branch members to a cold indifference.

Lily rushed to her brother's side, desperately trying to staunch the flow of blood from his injuries.

As Ivy summoned her people back, she noticed Anmin standing at the edge of the plaza, signaling her. She knew everything would be alright from here on out.
