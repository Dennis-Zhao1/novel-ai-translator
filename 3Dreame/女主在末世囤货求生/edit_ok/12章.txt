**Stockpiling Supplies Abroad**

After a whirlwind of transactions through her vast network, some of the younger family members were still catching their breath when a few surprises from Lila Lang turned their world upside down.

Those quick on their feet had already sealed their deals, celebrating their newly acquired businesses with a lively gathering. Lila Lang's enterprises weren't just leaders in their sectors; they ranked among the top ten, with future valuations set to skyrocket.

Upon returning to her luxurious penthouse, Lila counted her newfound wealth—over ten billion dollars. Her next step was to gather resources and construct a secret underground hideout.

She assigned her executive assistant the task of procuring necessary supplies. While others were busy trading and selling, the only viable assets left were the employees of the Pearl Jewelry Group. Lila briefly considered selling the jewelry business but realized its high valuation was too much for any single buyer to handle—after all, its products were solid gold and diamonds.

Then, an idea struck her: while she couldn't let go of it, she could leverage it to create a beneficial exchange.

More pressing, however, was her upcoming trip abroad. Once preparations were complete, her affluent friend, Ethan Carter, personally picked her up for the airport.

This trip was cloaked in secrecy. Lila told everyone she was off on a cultural exploration, but in truth, she was heading to an overseas mining site with Ethan.

To successfully navigate abroad, having some form of protection was crucial. Unlike strict domestic regulations, the foreign markets were more lenient; with enough money and connections, one could acquire almost anything.

Their journey was on a private jet. Ethan, cautious by nature, kept their plans under wraps, fearing any leak could jeopardize their mission and upset their families.

Lila’s uncle, who specialized in trade logistics, had flown to the mining area a day earlier. Given the magnitude of the deal, he couldn’t make decisions alone. As he observed Lila—seemingly innocent and carefree—he felt a mix of admiration and envy.

Accompanied by a bodyguard arranged by her grandfather, Lila had already secured contacts in the mining area through family connections, claiming she was simply there for leisure and to expand her horizons.

No one suspected her true intentions. The Lang family’s Pearl Jewelry Group owned a jade mine in Myanmar, protected by local security forces. Why would she need weapons?

They likely saw her as a wealthy young woman looking for excitement; as long as there was a deal, there were benefits. With that mindset, they assisted Lila in crafting an excuse to gain their cooperation.

On the plane, Ethan engaged Lila in casual conversation, but she was subtly probing for information on how they might transport supplies back to the States if she lacked the means. Or how to acquire more advanced equipment. Ethan, mistaking her curiosity for naïveté, eagerly shared his insights, eager to impress her.

While Ethan was easy to charm, his uncle was shrewd; a seasoned strategist who had mastered the art of negotiation. No one could easily deceive him.

Upon landing, the vehicle arranged by Ethan's uncle took them directly to the mining site. The machinery hummed with activity, creating a lively yet not overwhelming atmosphere.

Watchtowers surrounded the mine, with security personnel patrolling to deter disputes or threats. Unlike the safety of the U.S., having protection was a necessity abroad.

When Ethan’s uncle met Lila, his sharp eyes assessed her. He could easily believe she was just his nephew’s playful companion. Who would suspect her of seeking equipment? Not fully understanding her motives, he casually remarked, “Isn’t curiosity a natural trait?”

Lila knew he was no fool, so she sighed, mentioning her family’s jade mine in Myanmar. She implied that the local security had grown uneasy since her grandfather's passing, and without a balance, she sought help from the Carter family.

Seeing her sincere expression, Ethan’s uncle re-evaluated the situation, realizing their security was indeed a concern and they had always been self-reliant.

The Lang family’s partners were known for their determination. While trustworthy, he struggled to gauge the little princess’s standing with her family’s leaders.

Profit was their ultimate goal, and after Lila’s explanation, Ethan’s uncle set aside his doubts, even offering more robust solutions.

Having hinted at her intentions on the plane, Ethan’s uncle recognized the challenges she faced. No wonder she considered liquidating other assets; even the Pearl Jewelry Group might not withstand pressure. It was wiser to convert them into cash or tangible assets instead of risking total loss.

The deal proceeded smoothly. After a day and night at the mine, Ethan’s uncle informed her the supplies had arrived. The initial shipment had been supplemented, enough to equip a substantial team.

Lila’s bodyguard, a former international security expert, was well-versed in equipment. He was there to ensure her safety and verify the goods.

Methodically, the bodyguard opened crates, inspecting the equipment. Some items were disassembled for thorough checks, while others were examined for quality and completeness.

Ethan’s uncle and Lila waited patiently nearby. While Ethan’s uncle pondered more deeply, Lila, a young woman abroad with limited world experience, appeared either brave or merely curious.

As for whether the Carter family would exploit or deceive her, Lila remained confident. Her grandfather's connections were strong, although she might not know the full extent, other families had some understanding.

This was her confidence and leverage.

After Lila confirmed the supplies, they arranged for transport to Myanmar that night. She also secured port access to directly load them onto shipping containers.

Following Ethan’s uncle to the port, Lila watched as the supplies were efficiently loaded into the container. A significant portion was filled with the shipment.

Once everything was packed, the container doors needed to be locked, with the key handed to Lila to give to her contact.

Just as the doors were about to close, Lila suddenly called out, “Wait! Don’t close it yet!”

Ethan’s uncle was puzzled by her request.

Lila smiled apologetically. “I forgot to add our family’s mark inside. Grandpa insisted all our goods have it; otherwise, they might not be accepted.”

Ethan’s uncle nodded, familiar with the Lang family’s unique mark, a distinctive C-shaped dragon design that inspired the Pearl Group's logo. The technique was exclusive, known only to family members.

He gestured for the doors to be opened again.

Lila waved confidently. “No need to trouble yourselves, Uncle. I'll just slip in and mark it; I’m pretty nimble.”

With that, she climbed inside, lighting the space with her phone. Moments later, she returned, urging them to lock up.

The key was entrusted to her bodyguard, and she returned to Ethan’s uncle with a cheerful smile.

They didn’t linger to oversee the loading; drawing attention wasn’t wise. The less they appeared concerned, the less suspicion they’d raise.

After ensuring the locks and labels were secure, Lila and Ethan’s uncle planned to return to the mining site. However, the vibrant city near the port caught Lila’s eye.

Ethan’s uncle chuckled at her carefree nature, suggesting they spend a few days exploring.

After a moment's consideration, Lila agreed. The logistics would take time, and besides, this was just a show—the real supplies were already safely stashed in her control.
