**Exploiting Vulnerabilities**

"This feels like one obstacle after another, like a never-ending escape room!" Andy finally voiced the frustration that had been building up inside him.

"Yeah, it's like some mastermind is pulling the strings. We're stuck in a survival game," Lucas added, and the two began joking about teaming up for a victory if they ever got out of this situation.

Jake had already reached the 12th floor, causing Sarah to raise an eyebrow. It seemed the persistent spirit was rushing him again.

"Jake, this building has over thirty floors; you're not even halfway there," the system reminded him.

"Give it a rest. Why don’t you give it a shot?" Jake retorted.

"I will if I have to!"

The two exchanged playful banter, with Jake leading the way and Sarah following him through the twelfth floor to the elevator lobby.

Sarah and the others exchanged puzzled glances at Jake. Was he really thinking of using the elevator?

Jake nodded, looking tired. The stairwell was a mess of debris. If they wanted to move efficiently, the elevator was their best bet.

"But there's no power," Andy pointed out, noticing the clean elevator area but questioning where the electricity would come from.

Before Jake could answer, Zoe suddenly jumped with excitement. "Are you serious? You’re like a human wind machine, and Jake's basically a human battery! Remember his powers?"

Andy was momentarily stunned. Right, Jake's lightning ability meant he could generate electricity!

"Why didn’t we think of that sooner? We just climbed twelve floors, fighting through all those obstacles, and now you tell me we could’ve taken the elevator? My heart is breaking!" Andy exclaimed, half-serious, half-joking. But no one took him seriously.

Jake took a deep breath, raised his hand, and sent a silver-blue current toward the elevator button. The charge wasn’t strong, but it was enough. In the next moment, the elevator button lit up with a warm, inviting glow.

Before long, the digital display above the elevator began counting up from 1 to 12.

"Wow, the elevator is really coming! Jake, is this a burden for you?" Andy asked curiously, while Sarah also looked eager for an answer. Jake resisted the urge to ruffle Sarah's hair and shook his head.

"No big deal; it won’t take much energy."

He wasn’t exaggerating. His powers were more than enough for this task.

Once inside the elevator, Sarah pressed the button for the top three floors. She wasn't sure if Michael and the others would be on the top floor, but they had to be somewhere above. This was the perfect time to scan for their whereabouts as the elevator ascended.

Little did Victor know that in this post-apocalyptic world, his enemies would take the elevator up to confront him.

Meanwhile, Victor had managed to calm himself. He understood the situation well. Facing challenges head-on was pointless; maximizing his benefits was what truly mattered.

When he suggested continuing to monitor the surveillance, the system quietly agreed. It had been questioning whether its decisions were correct. Its connection with Victor was based solely on the luck of the main character. The system's principle was to bind with only the luckiest individuals.

The system, unfazed by past conflicts, allowed him to check the surveillance freely. Not long after, he exclaimed, "Why can’t I see anyone? Did they run away?"

As soon as Victor spoke, the system replied, "Impossible! My research indicates that people won’t abandon efforts that require significant investment."

Having slacked off for a while, the system quickly began searching. It realized its control wasn’t comprehensive; many facilities had been damaged. Through various perspectives, it observed that Sarah and her group entered the twelfth floor and then disappeared, likely resting.

With a cold snort, it scoffed at its current host, thinking he was weak. If it weren’t for the main character's luck, it would have chosen a new host long ago.

"They’re resting on the twelfth floor. It’ll take them two to three hours to get back up here, so there’s no need to panic," the system reassured Victor, urging him to be patient.

"Just so you know, I want all of their crystal cores," the system suddenly stated, making a simple request to ensure its plans were foolproof.

Victor, however, was a shrewd individual. He never believed anything could be perfect—everything needed a contingency plan. After years of working with the system, it had never made a mistake. His instincts kicked in, prompting him to devise a Plan B. He decided to rely solely on the system for now.

Knowing his situation, Victor settled back down, focusing on the surveillance feed, waiting for Sarah and her group to reappear.

At this moment, Sarah and her companions had already exited the elevator. As the elevator rose, she concentrated her mental energy to identify the crystal core’s light points. Michael’s crystal core was a reddish gold. Besides her own and Jake’s, the colors of ordinary ability users’ crystal cores also had their unique features.

What helped her quickly distinguish Michael’s group was not them specifically but Zoe’s brother, whose healing ability’s crystal core emitted a strong glow—soft gold mixed with white luminescence, radiating warmth like a little sun. Instantly, she locked onto their location.

Sarah pointed to the spot, signaling everyone to follow her.

Andy was about to crack a joke to lighten the mood. He glanced at Jake, who seemed distracted, and held back, not wanting to disturb him. Instead, he made eye contact with Lucas and Zoe, urging them to pay attention.

Zoe wasn’t fond of subtle gestures. Keeping her distance, she overheard Sarah whisper, "Found them. They’re just behind this door."

Zoe looked at the gray wall and the silver-gray metallic security door, wearing an expression that suggested she was being intentionally teased. This door was even more imposing than the one that had once trapped her and her father in that laboratory.
