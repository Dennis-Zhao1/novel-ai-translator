**Bring Me the Gasoline**

Uncle Harold, known for his kindness and easygoing nature, was thrilled with the recent successful deal that significantly boosted his influence in the Smith family. While he wasn't quite ready to challenge his older brother for full control, he certainly held more sway than his other brothers and nephews.

In the roomy interior of a luxury SUV, Ivy sat beside Uncle Harold, both beaming as they talked about their plans to enjoy some time with Ethan Smith. However, Ethan had a lot waiting for him back home and was scheduled to leave the next day. Uncle Harold planned to accompany him to manage some new assets Ivy had acquired, arranging for a local guide to help her out. With that settled, Ivy, along with her security team, set off to explore the vibrant city.

The day was a whirlwind of fun—eating, drinking, snapping photos, and shopping. The security team carried numerous bags filled with local souvenirs as gifts for friends back home. By the afternoon, they were set to catch a connecting flight to a neighboring country known for its oil reserves.

After checking into the iconic Burj Al Arab hotel, Ivy decided to email a well-known local broker. Their introduction had been pure chance; at just eighteen, Ivy found herself kidnapped during her first solo trip abroad. Her grandfather pulled some strings to get help from this mysterious broker who had rescued her.

Since then, her grandfather saw him as a powerful figure who could get things done for the right price, no strings attached. He was a lone wolf with connections across both the underworld and legitimate circles.

During lunch at the hotel’s restaurant, Ivy received an email from the broker, Chris, inviting her to meet at the bustling North Street at 4:30 PM. After finishing her meal, she and her team went on a shopping spree at a local mall, buying anything that caught their fancy and arranging deliveries to a newly rented warehouse at the port.

Right at 4:30 PM, they met up. After a few polite exchanges, Ivy got straight to the point—she wanted to buy a cruise ship and gasoline. Chris, wearing a baseball cap, wasn't fazed; he'd dealt with more outrageous requests before. Young heirs like her were often looking to impress or pursue dreams of global adventures. With money, almost anything was possible.

As Chris helped her navigate the shops while contacting his clients, he noticed her snapping photos and videos, which was a familiar sight for him. Soon, he confirmed a deal, presenting her with a price and his commission. After some thought, Ivy agreed, her excitement evident as she urged Chris to take her to see the cruise ship.

Chris arranged for a driver to take them to an unmarked three-story building by the port. Once out of the vehicle, they headed to the back entrance, where locals greeted Chris and led them upstairs. No words were exchanged, but Ivy noticed each man had a handgun tucked into their waistband, and through a nearby window reflection, she saw guards with submachine guns on the upper floor.

The shipyard was where they could buy the cruise ship, but this place primarily dealt in gasoline. Ivy had also mentioned wanting to acquire some weapons, which surprised Chris for a moment, though he nodded in understanding. It wasn't unusual for wealthy heirs to purchase arms, but this refined young woman requesting such items added an intriguing twist.

For Chris, it was just a minor intrigue. He knew his role: once the money traded hands, everything else was out of his concern.

Ivy quietly followed him upstairs into a sunlit office. A man sat in an executive chair, his features obscured by the backlight. Ivy sensed the tension from her bodyguards, seasoned mercenaries whose instincts told them these were dangerous people.

Her bodyguards were legally armed, having registered their weapons back home, but regulations abroad were more lax. Ivy, however, felt no fear; Chris had an excellent industry reputation, with no incidents in his dealings.

Invited to sit, her bodyguards took defensive positions behind her. The man in the chair smiled and exchanged a few words in a language Ivy didn’t understand with Chris, who then translated for her in English.

Before arriving, Chris had no information about whom they’d meet, suggesting this man wasn’t the main decision-maker. Even without understanding the language, Ivy's instincts, honed through her studies, allowed her to read the tones and expressions.

The local was the third-in-command and could assist with the gasoline transaction, but any firearm dealings required the big boss. Ivy smiled and nodded to show she understood.

Her main goal was purchasing arms and gasoline; the cruise ship was secondary, as shipbuilders back home were eager to contact her. Even if she bought a local cruise ship, discreetly bringing it home was another matter.

Throughout the meeting, Chris switched between languages, and aside from initial pleasantries, the gasoline deal discussions moved quickly. The amount was substantial, and payments in U.S. dollars would easily exceed a hundred million. Ivy allowed ample time for the seller to prepare and asked Chris to introduce her to reliable firearm purchasing channels.

With funds verified, there was no time to dawdle. Chris led her to another location, and Ivy initially expected to meet the group's leader. However, the driver took several turns, leading them into an area resembling a slum.

Ivy looked around, surprised to see such poverty in a wealthy country. It felt like a scene from a different world.

Noticing her raised eyebrows, Chris chuckled, "Surprised, Ivy? Didn’t expect to see this side of Saudi Arabia?"

Ivy smiled, "Exactly! We joke that even picking up trash here could make you rich!"

Chris just shook his head with a grin.

After stepping out, Chris led the way to a factory building. Walking through the slum, they saw only women working and children playing, with no adult men in sight.

Ivy observed these oddities but stayed silent. At the factory, the mystery unfolded. It was an underground arms factory where young, strong men were hard at work.

Chris didn’t give Ivy a tour but instead talked to a guard about their purpose, leading her straight to another room. The Saudi individuals were all business; the office setup mirrored the one at the port almost precisely.

Once seated, the person in charge understood their needs and instructed an assistant to bring in a black cabinet on wheels. Ivy was puzzled until it was opened, revealing its contents. She was taken aback, nearly losing her composure.
