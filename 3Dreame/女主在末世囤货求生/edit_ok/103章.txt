**The Scene of Social Embarrassment**

The noise was relentless. Who was calling out, disturbing her precious sleep? Couldn't anyone let her rest for once?

Ivy Collins furrowed her brows, sitting up groggily. Her hair was a tangled mess, and she stubbornly kept her eyes closed.

"Ivy, wake up, wake up!"

"Ugh, seriously? Can you please stop? It's so annoying!"

Ivy finally opened her eyes, ready to snap at whoever was bothering her. To her surprise, she found herself not in her room, but in...some kind of strange space?

What on earth was going on?

She tried to remember. It seemed she had been on guard duty alone, almost falling under the spell of some creepy guy in a hoodie. Then she had flashed into this space. After that...she just fell asleep?

And who was calling her?

A flurry of questions raced through her mind, just as another voice broke the silence.

"Good, you're awake."

A chill ran down Ivy's spine. Aside from her, there shouldn't be anyone in this bizarre place! She immediately shouted, "Who's there? Show yourself!"

"It's me, Jasper."

No other sounds followed, but a large screen in front of her glowed softly with white light.

Ivy looked up, puzzled by what she had just heard.

But Jasper didn’t bother to explain; instead, it displayed a simple message: "You've been here long enough; time to head out."

Ivy frowned at the command. With stubbornness practically written in her DNA, there was no way she’d just comply.

"Kicking me out? Not happening!"

Jasper let out an exasperated sigh.

"You've been asleep here for ten days. Can you even imagine how much time has passed outside?"

"What? Ten days?! Oh my gosh, I gotta go!"

Without waiting for further explanation, Ivy flashed out of the space, completely unaware of her disheveled appearance.

The moment she emerged, she stepped on something and lost her balance, tumbling down.

Oof, it didn’t hurt. Ivy instinctively closed her eyes. When she opened them again, a familiar face loomed large before her, startling her into a scream. Strangely, the other person screamed even louder.

"Ethan, what the heck! Why are you here? You scared me half to death!"

"What are you yelling for? You’re the one who popped up out of nowhere, looking like a ghost!"

Ivy quickly turned the tables, not missing a beat.

Ethan's expression was a mix of surprise and amusement. Seeing her appear out of nowhere would startle anyone, so he felt justified in his reaction.

Faced with her accusation, he could only mutter, "Are you okay?"

"If you hadn’t tripped me, I’d be just fine!"

Ivy, always quick with a comeback, didn’t let the moment pass.

"Are you sure you're really okay?"

Their banter drew the attention of other community members nearby. They had been busy with their tasks, and seeing Ivy’s sudden appearance was quite the spectacle. As they approached to greet her, they jumped back at the sight of her face.

Ethan gave her a look that said, "See? I told you so." Ivy glanced around suspiciously, then recalled that she hadn’t checked her appearance after waking up. Maybe her hair was a nightmare after sleeping? She couldn't help but chuckle at their overreactions. Pulling out a compact mirror from her pocket, she took a look and gasped, "A ghost!"

With a loud crash, she tossed the mirror away, and it landed right on Ethan, who was closest to her.

The atmosphere grew increasingly awkward. Ethan didn’t push her to explain; instead, he let her hide her embarrassment, waving his hand to send the onlookers back to their duties. He draped a jacket over her head, and she quickly pulled it down, feeling as if she were being dragged by the collar toward a nearby bench.

Ivy was genuinely mortified. Her mind was a whirlwind of regret, shame, and a mess of emotions—an entirely cringe-worthy social moment.

Ethan stifled a laugh, saying, "Alright, alright, no one saw."

"Ugh, I just want to disappear!"

Her words made Ethan's chest shake with suppressed laughter.

Once they reached her dormitory, and she plopped down on the sofa, she finally released her grip on the jacket. In the next instant, she disappeared, reappearing completely refreshed, her makeup redone, and her clothes and hair back in order.

Ethan was already seated across from her, watching with an amused expression. Once she had composed herself, he began asking about what had happened.

Ivy recounted the events, which lined up with what Ethan had suspected. Her memories were hazy, especially about what happened after she entered the space. She had no idea how she ended up sleeping for so long, nor why she looked so ghastly.

She didn’t mention that Jasper, the entity, seemed to communicate with her; she hadn’t figured out what that meant yet and didn’t want to waste his time with it.

The pressing issue now was to understand what that hoodie-wearing guy was up to and what his powers were. Having experienced it firsthand, Ivy shared her thoughts.

"I think he might be some kind of psychic. He can manipulate the minds of others. His powers are strong and overwhelming; once he locks onto a target, it's hard to break free. Otherwise, how do you explain that I was moving forward mindlessly, with my mind totally blank?"

Ethan nodded, considering her theory.

"I saw you disappear into that space right before my eyes. I wanted to contact Jasper to check on you, but it blocked all signals. At that moment, you entering the space cut off his control over you. That's why he seemed so frustrated—he lost his prey."

Ivy was surprised he had observed so much. Thankfully he had shown up; otherwise, with no one on watch and her entering the space, if that psychic guy had managed to control a few people, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

"So this attack was orchestrated by him? What could his motive be? Is he working for someone else?"

Ivy speculated boldly.

Ethan pondered the connections. From what he knew, the guy didn’t seem to have any clear ties to others who wanted to harm them. With his powers being so potent, how could he be just a pawn?

Everything felt like a tangled web of mysteries, each thread leading nowhere clear. No matter how they tried to unravel it, they couldn't find the start of the thread.

He turned back to Ivy and asked, "How did you manage to break free once he locked onto you? That’s crucial; if we run into him again, we might be able to prevent it."

Ivy thought for a moment and simply said, "I was on guard after his first attempt. When my head started feeling fuzzy, I immediately entered the space."

Ethan considered her words before asking, "Since you were aware of his attack, can you mimic his methods?"

Ivy shook her head vigorously. "No way! That’s a psychic ability! I can't do that. But if you want a couple of icy glares, I can manage that!"

Hearing her response, Ethan shook his head and dropped the topic. Instead, he began recounting the efforts of clearing the area over the past few days.

As Ivy listened and nodded, she realized it was time to get back to work after resting for so long. With that thought, she stood up and headed toward the door.

By the time they reached the entrance, a clear path had been made, so there was no need to rely on any special abilities to maneuver. Once outside, instead of joining the others who were already working, Ivy held her sword, slicing through obstacles one by one.

Of course, she didn’t use her prized sword, opting instead for a more practical one she found handy. She teamed up with others, working like a well-oiled machine—one person would clear the path, another would gather supplies, and a third handled logistics.

Their efficiency was impressive, but Ivy still found it too slow. She couldn't help but wish she could just summon everything she needed with a wave of her hand.

But she kept that thought to herself; otherwise, the others might tease her for having unrealistic dreams. Instead, she focused on the task, knowing there was still plenty of work ahead.
