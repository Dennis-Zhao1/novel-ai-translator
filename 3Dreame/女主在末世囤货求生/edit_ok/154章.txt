**Night Assault**

Ivy shouted to those around her, quickly retreating to the corner of the office complex. 

“Fire squad, let’s light it up!”

As soon as she steadied herself, she directed the fire strike. Alex, Sam, and other fire specialists reacted swiftly. In the darkness, flames shot into the sky, illuminating their surroundings. It was those mutated plants again—their old adversaries.

Ivy called over Luke to stand beside her and follow her lead. Luke had previously absorbed Ethan’s abilities, and as long as they didn’t reset, he could maintain them indefinitely. She hoped everything would go as planned.

The vines of the mutated plants wildly reached out from the dark hole, attacking them haphazardly. Jack and Ryan, leading their respective teams, countered methodically. To prevent rapid depletion of their powers, they had arranged for shifts, ensuring that every position had backup strength.

Ivy’s backup was Sophie. Although she had only recently discovered her abilities, her direct mentor had provided ample resources, allowing her to advance to level four, just behind Luke. The others weren’t so fortunate, lingering on the edge of level four.

However, the vines continued to surge forth, seemingly endless. Ivy ordered someone to bring over the lit torches, inspired by suggestions from Ryan at the Dragonflight Base. 

The vines were afraid of fire. Though the torches weren’t large, their numbers made up for it. For a while, the vine attacks weakened, and everyone caught their breath. Just then, a massive wave of vines surged forward, intent on self-destruction, willing to be burned just to emerge.

Seeing this, Ivy tossed a small barrel of gasoline out. As it arched over the dark hole, she shot several ice spikes, piercing the barrel. Gasoline sprayed out like a shower, cascading down.

Immediately after, Jack and the others also hurled their torches. The descent felt like slow motion to everyone present.

With a loud boom, flames erupted into the sky. The mutated plants squealed as if burned, trying to retreat into the hole, but the group wouldn’t let them escape. They unleashed their abilities as if money were no object. Matt seized the opportunity, whipping up a strong wind to intensify the flames.

Nearby, a member of the guard team joked, “Matt, is this skill from cremating corpses? Your moves are like turning bones to ashes!”

“Just a touch of skill,” Matt replied proudly. “Look how well I’m burning this! I deserve the title of a walking bellows!”

“More like a walking air pump,” someone teased.

“Get outta here!” Matt laughed, lifting the previously tense atmosphere of battle into one of fleeting joy. 

Seeing the mutated plants being scorched into a mass of black ash, blown everywhere by Matt’s wind, Ivy quickly called for a halt. As this mischievous kid reveled in his success, several people were blinded by the ash, pausing to rub their eyes. Ivy waved her hand to clear the view and suddenly noticed another bizarre mutated plant quickly crawling out from the dark hole, even larger than before, with thicker vines.

“Watch out, another one is coming!” 

Everyone launched their abilities, but unfortunately, the damage was minimal. The severed vines quickly transformed into small plants, reproducing at an astonishing rate. The fire squad hurriedly tossed fireballs, reducing the smaller ones to ash, but the larger ones refused to catch fire.

Detecting a damp odor, Ivy guessed it might be coming from the underground tunnels of the power plant. The air was thick with moisture. She reached into her spatial pocket for another barrel of gasoline, ready to throw.

“Hold on!” 

Jack grabbed her hand and turned to Matt. “Try using wind blades to chop off the thicker vines, quickly!”

Matt immediately complied, unleashing several wind blades that sliced through the mutated plants with a whoosh, the sound of air being split. The vines that met the wind blades fell, severed. 

“Fire squad, quickly burn these cut vines!” 

Just in time, they incinerated everything before it had the chance to reproduce again. Matt kept the rhythm, one cutting while the group burned, and soon the mutated plants were left defenseless, unable to extend their vines to attack anymore.

By the flickering firelight, the mutated plant that had its vines cut off looked peculiar. It used to crawl with its vines, but now, without them, it lay motionless on the ground like an insect without legs. 

Ivy shot several ice spikes at it, piercing through its active root system. Normally, when a plant’s roots were damaged, it couldn’t grow anymore. She wondered if this mutated plant adhered to the same rules.

However, she was unprepared for the surge of mutated plants crawling out of the dark hole, dispersing in different directions. They were forced into three groups: one under Ivy’s command, one under Jack’s, and one under Ryan’s.

Ryan had around twenty specialists under his command. Although they were all newcomers, they had developed a good synergy and worked well together. Jack, with his special forces background, knew how to lead and organize.

On the other hand, Ivy found herself overwhelmed. Despite her leadership role, even older men who appeared fierce didn’t dare challenge her. Yet, her team’s coordination left much to be desired; it would be an understatement to say they were merely paying lip service and not following her commands.

Fortunately, Ivy was resourceful, but without her self-sufficiency, she felt her position could become a weak point for relentless attacks.

Considering the plant's characteristics, she figured that, aside from their fear of heat, they also likely feared cold. Together with Sophie, they froze all the nearby plant vines, shattering them with a single strike. With the vines cleared, the roots were exposed, and once they discovered the method, it became easy to deal with.

Some specialists were already absorbing crystal cores to replenish their energy. Ivy frowned; the number of mutated plants was increasing rapidly.

“Get people to retreat! Move towards the main gate! Head for the tower!”

She loudly notified Ryan and Jack. Everyone fought while retreating, with the mutated plants hot on their heels, resembling frenzied sea urchins chasing after them.

Earth specialists continuously dug pits, while fire specialists collaboratively created a firewall to block the advance. Jack occasionally unleashed lightning strikes, combined with Ivy’s ice barriers, buying precious time for those lagging behind.

Once everyone reached the tower, the searchlights and floodlights at the entrance were turned on, and when everyone looked, their scalps went numb, and goosebumps erupted all over their bodies. 

It was just like the last time they faced a zombie siege, but now, it was mutated plants. 

Ivy realized this battle would be tough and was shocked by how disgusting it was. Even she, who didn’t have a phobia of clusters, was nearly developing one.

Unable to endure any longer, she pulled out a row of gasoline barrels and set them on the ground. She then retrieved her previously hoarded flamethrower from her spatial pocket, which she initially thought she wouldn’t need in this lifetime. This moment, however, proved it was extremely appropriate.

She passed them out to Jack and the guards. Upon seeing this fantastic weapon, everyone instantly felt relieved.

“Ivy, you’re incredible! So many flamethrowers! Let’s roast these nasty things today!”

“Don’t insult dogs! Those disgusting things down there aren’t even as cute as dogs.”

“Alright, enough chatter. Let’s get to work!” 

The guard captain and his teammate teased each other, but Ivy didn’t have time to deal with anyone else. She rummaged through the armory, hoping to find even more suitable weapons.
