**A Nap Meets a Pillow**

After returning from what felt like the end of the world, Ivy Hamilton found the vibrant, intoxicating pace of life utterly captivating.

It all began with a phone call one afternoon.

Sarah Johnson, the eldest daughter of the Johnson family, had flown back into the country without a word of warning. As soon as she touched down in New York City, she called Ivy, her voice teary and pleading for a welcome party, complete with all the glitz and glamor one could muster.

Ivy sifted through the chaotic mix of chatter and complaints, deciphering the underlying message. It felt like the universe was granting her wishes: just as one settles into a nap, a pillow is gently placed under their head. Sarah had just posted on social media about her safe return, and Ivy eagerly responded, her fingers itching to send a cascade of emojis.

She quickly typed under Sarah’s post, “No time for a formal dinner, but how about some fine wine tonight with friends? Are we in?”

In no time, not just Sarah, but a host of mutual friends chimed in the comments with enthusiastic "Count me in!"

Ivy chuckled to herself and renamed the group chat from "Luxury Car Bride Delivery Group" to "Welcome Back, Sarah, Wine Night," pulling in everyone who had responded with glee.

Those who hadn’t caught on to Sarah’s return were now surprised to find so many new members—mostly women—joining the chat, bringing the total close to forty.

Someone humorously asked in the chat, "Are we starting the 'marriage fest' now? Isn’t that illegal…?"

Unbeknownst to Sarah, who had been blissfully unaware while crossing international borders, she excitedly declared in the group, "I’m back! Let’s get together tonight!"

Ivy, ever the efficient planner, unleashed a barrage of digital gift cards to stir up excitement in the group. Sarah quickly followed suit, and those who had participated joined in the fun, eager to see what they might receive.

The digital gift card frenzy truly lit up the atmosphere, and everyone was having a blast. Ivy had already secured a reservation at a friend’s bar for the largest private room, eagerly anticipating Sarah’s arrival.

The welcome dinner wasn’t genuinely urgent; rather, Ivy was focused on quickly exchanging her assets for something she truly desired. Among these so-called friends, very few had genuine connections; most were simply acquaintances from the business world, people she had to maintain a facade of camaraderie with. Their parents were thrilled to see their children mingling, as business partnerships might just blossom from these relationships. Even if no collaboration arose, it was better to avoid creating enemies—after all, harmony breeds prosperity.

Quite a few second-generation heirs with political backgrounds were in the mix; their ambitions were modest, making them more suited for social networking rather than high-stakes negotiations.

As Ivy reviewed her asset report, her assistant knocked and entered. She had already requested an expedited assessment report from a professional asset evaluation firm. After a quick comparison, the numbers aligned pretty well, and she promptly acknowledged her assistant’s efforts.

The assistant beamed, as if she had just accomplished a major feat, trying to suppress a grin that threatened to break her serious demeanor as she bounced out of the office.

“One dedicated worker,” Ivy mused.

Combining insights from the asset evaluation report, she calculated the equivalent exchange for the items she wanted, sorting the piles of documents on her desk.

When Sarah finally arrived at the Pearl Jewelry Building, it was already late. Her secretary led her to the office, where Ivy was still busy organizing the asset evaluation reports.

To achieve a decisive impact, thorough preparation was essential—she needed to avoid arousing suspicion while facilitating a swift and clever exchange.

Sarah confidently perched herself on the edge of Ivy’s desk, her perfectly manicured fingers playfully lifting Ivy’s chin.

In a teasing tone, she exclaimed, “My little Ivy! It’s been nearly a year since we last met. How have you grown even more beautiful? Let me take a closer look! Wow, you look stunning! Give me a kiss!”

Ivy laughed at her only true friend, her clear eyes reflecting the playful grin of Sarah, though her mind was devoid of any news from the chaos that had transpired during their time apart. In her previous life, she hadn’t returned to the country at this time but was traveling abroad, unaware of how the world had changed. Now that Sarah was back, she just wanted to find a way to live well.

Sarah noticed her friend staring at her with a puzzled expression, which made her feel slightly embarrassed, quickly trying to cover it up.

“Wow, even a big boss like you is working late? Let me see what you’re busy with!”

She snatched the asset evaluation report from Ivy’s desk and skimmed through it, her eyes widening with envy. “You truly are the richest lady in town! These assets are enough to make anyone green with envy…”

Ivy didn’t want to put on a show in front of her friend, but she also couldn’t divulge the full truth, so she vaguely replied, “I’m not great at managing these things, and I don’t really care for them. Every year, they just give me my share, but wouldn’t it be better to turn them into things I actually like? Just looking at them brings me joy!”

Sarah also had many assets under her name; her family was similar to Ivy’s, having built their wealth over generations. They were currently focused on developing in the biotechnology sector.

As Sarah considered her friend’s indifference toward her assets, she thought about how the evaluation report detailed the prices for complete transfer and sale. While receiving dividends wasn’t as immediately gratifying as getting a lump sum, she understood that Ivy’s preferences were simply beyond her comprehension.

Ivy had posted a picture of an ancient castle on social media that had failed to astonish Sarah, perhaps because their long friendship had exposed her to too many impressive sights, raising her standards.

Not wanting to linger in the office any longer, Ivy gathered up her documents and placed them in a folder. Grabbing her bag and car keys, she took Sarah out for a meal.

The restaurant was conveniently booked and not far from the bar they were headed to later. They also needed to find suitable outfits for the evening since wearing business attire to a night out felt out of place.

The two young women didn’t take long to eat; they browsed nearby shops, and Sarah couldn’t help but ask, “Ivy, what do you want? I honestly can’t think of anything you don’t already have.”

Ivy, walking ahead, her slender figure accentuated by her high heels, radiated an air of elegance—she perfectly embodied the image of a refined, wealthy heiress.

Turning back with a smile, she replied, “You know my grandfather. Aside from letting me buy a car just to have it on display, he doesn’t allow me to buy anything else. The family plane is just for convenience when traveling for work; I truly prefer yachts and helicopters instead.”

There was a hint of disappointment in her tone, along with a touch of confusion.

“Maybe your grandfather cares too much about you—afraid you’d go to dangerous places?” Sarah ventured, her voice uncertain.

“Perhaps. But Grandpa is gone now, and I’m grown up. I have desires but can’t possess them. You understand, right?”

Ivy gazed earnestly into Sarah’s eyes, and after a moment of contemplation, Sarah nodded slowly.

“If you put it that way, I realize I don’t have much either. We’ve never had a yacht party, but those influencer friends of mine go often,” Sarah said, a hint of envy in her voice.

“Exactly. We don't even have a single swimsuit photo together…” Ivy recalled.

“I can’t even swim,” Sarah sighed dramatically.

Both suddenly burst into laughter, realizing that their families had shielded them too well, unwilling to let them face even the slightest mishap.
