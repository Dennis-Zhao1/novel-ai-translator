**Discovering the Hidden Emerald**

When Ivy activated her intuitive technique, the pile of dull stones initially only glimmered with a faint white sheen, barely noticeable. However, as she concentrated, a sudden burst of vibrant emerald light shot forth, only to disappear just as quickly.

Doubting her own senses, Ivy questioned her intuitive method. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and focused once more. This time, she concentrated her energy precisely where the emerald glow had appeared, channeling her mental focus to stabilize her perception in that small area.

Surrounded by the same pale white hue, Ivy felt puzzled. Was her intuition playing tricks on her?

Just as she was about to step back, the captivating emerald hue emerged again, shimmering gently from the pile of raw stones, this time lingering longer.

Determined to make sense of it, Ivy decided to take a closer look at the pile.

The rough stones were piled haphazardly on the ground beside the showcase, stacked one atop another. While everyone else was gathered around the display, only Ivy ventured toward the intriguing pile.

She called on her bodyguard, Max, asking him to help clear the stones around her. If it weren't for her improved intuition, she wouldn't have been able to sustain her focus so long.

Holding her mental energy like a scanner, Ivy meticulously swept over each stone in that area. Curious onlookers watched their unusual actions from a distance, and the event staff recognized her as the representative of one of the major showcases. As one staff member considered intervening, he hesitated and let it drop.

Such occurrences were rare, but understandable; if the young woman was curious and wanted to examine the stones, there was no harm. After all, none of those stones were worth as much as the materials brought for the exhibition.

Seeing that Ivy and Max posed no danger, the event organizer decided not to interfere further. He instructed the staff to stay alert and assist Ivy if needed.

Together with Max, Ivy began to shift the stacked stones aside. Under her intuitive focus, the emerald light grew brighter and more dazzling. She crouched down and unearthed a piece of jade the size of a soup bowl from the bottom of the pile.

It was a broken piece, appearing to have been chipped off from a larger stone with a chisel, and there were clear marks from the tool at the broken edge.

However, the outer layer exhibited excellent characteristics, known as "wax skin black sand." An experienced master would look at such a skin and be convinced that there had to be green inside, and not just any green but imperial green.

The staff watched as Ivy held the raw piece, examining it closely. They thoughtfully arranged for someone to assist her in carrying it to the viewing area.

At this point, the viewing area was bustling with industry experts and leaders examining their selections.

When evaluating options, meticulousness is crucial; noting identification numbers on promising pieces is essential for later bidding. Accuracy in assessment is key.

Someone noticed Ivy's entrance and greeted her with a smile. "Ivy, have you discovered something valuable? Care to share with us?"

Ivy nodded politely. After taking her seat, the staff helped place the jade piece on the table before her.

Each table was draped with red velvet, and thoughtful arrangements included tools for examination, such as jewelry magnifiers and high-powered flashlights.

However, Ivy didn't reach for any tools; she focused intently on the skin of the jade piece, puzzled as to why it presented such contradictory characteristics.

Even with her limited knowledge, she understood the basics of jade identification. The condition of the outer layer clearly indicated, "I am a treasure."

Yet upon turning it to view the broken edge, it was obvious even without a light that it was a stark, dull white, devoid of any green. The texture was rough, marred with spots of chromite, resembling a face that was waxy and yellowish, covered in large pores and blackheads. Even the most beautiful skin had its limits.

The same applied to jade; its assessment criteria were vibrant color, transparency, fine texture, and luster. Colorless jade must be transparent, delicate, and glossy.

While she pondered the theory of examining jade skins, a president from a competing city in Huaguo teased her.

"Ivy, why did you pick a piece of junk? There are so many good options; have you never seen something worse?"

He laughed, believing himself to be quite humorous.

Not familiar with him and put off by his greasy demeanor, Ivy decided to ignore him. Instead, she turned to the staff, inquiring about her own expert in jade evaluation and whether he could be summoned.

She couldn't decipher it herself, so she sought someone who could, confident that her intuition wouldn't mislead her. Her curiosity was piqued, and she was eager to uncover the truth.

Before long, her trusted jade expert arrived. Most of the staff at the venue were locals who had started from humble beginnings, gradually working their way up to positions of expertise in jade evaluation due to their talent and skills — a rare occurrence indeed.

The accompanying translator conveyed her request to the expert, who bent down to examine the raw stone closely. He first cradled the piece in his hands, inspecting it thoroughly, then shone a powerful flashlight along the perimeter of the skin to the broken edge.

The piece wasn't thick, and with the flashlight, he could see inside. The grayish-white interior showed no signs of green and didn’t appear likely to yield black jade or purple jade either.

Using a magnifier, the expert carefully examined the entire surface of the skin before stating, "This piece has little value; the skin is just deceiving."

Upon hearing the translator relay this, Ivy fell into a contemplative silence, while the greasy man beside her burst into laughter.

"Indeed, this is clearly trash. The organizers must be too much; did they bring it here just to fool people?"

Ivy chose not to respond. Since the expert couldn't identify any value, she decided to cut it open and see what lay inside — a clear verdict on her intuitive skills.

She called for the staff to quote a price. This piece was small and not particularly expensive, so she paid promptly, instructing the staff to take it to the cutting area.

The regular process for jade evaluation involves viewing, payment, and cutting. Unlike other places that offer partial betting, this event was straightforward — only complete betting was allowed. If one wanted to try partial betting, they would have to buy the material and take it home.

The greasy man, finding amusement in the situation, saw Ivy, a pretty young woman with means who didn't seem interested in socializing. He figured she didn’t know how to spend her wealth and bought a worthless piece of jade. He anticipated the moment she would try to cut it, waiting for the chance to capture her regrettable expression.

Colleagues from the industry are often rivals, and now that they were in close quarters, he was eager to watch her misfortune unfold.

Ivy ignored him completely, pondering how best to cut the stone. Just before the cutting machine powered up, the master cutter confirmed with her the direction for the first cut. Ivy used her intuitive technique to examine the emerald light's position from all angles, directing the cutter to trace two lines along the edge of the glowing area.

The greasy man watched Ivy with disdain, convinced she was just putting on a show.

He was aware of the Ivy family's reputation and felt a tinge of jealousy. It was a bitter pill to swallow when others had success while he did not.

As the cutting machine whirred to life, Ivy watched as the left side of the raw stone was sliced away. From the fallen fragment, it was clear that the interior matched the broken edge — rough, grayish-white with many dark spots.

The cutter looked up at Ivy, who nodded for him to continue. He shifted the stone and cut along the other marked line, revealing more of the same — grayish-white with black spots.

"Hahahaha! Ivy, let's not waste the organizer's electricity. If you lose, you lose; it's not like your group will mind that little bit of money."

In reality, he had already discreetly started filming, capturing the image of the unremarkable piece as both sides were cut without revealing any green.

Ivy couldn't help but roll her eyes at him. Throughout the cutting process, she had kept her intuition active, and the emerald light had never faded. But why hadn’t it appeared in the cut stone?

She was just as perplexed and thought to herself that if this next cut didn’t reveal any green, it would mean her intuitive technique was flawed.

As the machine’s blade descended, the greasy man, who had been on the verge of leaving, suddenly heard a commotion of gasps and cheers from inside.

Curious, he turned around and ran back toward the source of the excitement.
