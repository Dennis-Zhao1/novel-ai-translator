"Hey, what are they doing? Why are they dragging this out? Look at her; she's practically dying with impatience! Could it be that she's into you? That shouldn't be possible; she hasn't even fallen for the charming me, so how could she possibly like the boring you?"

Jack couldn’t open his eyes to see what was happening. He needed to play his part well, hoping the self-absorbed voice in his head would just quiet down.

"Alright, I see I’ve struck a nerve. I’ll zip it. But when you catch that bad guy, remember to call for her, okay? I have my ways."

The voice, for once, decided to be quiet. It was now Jack’s eyes, helping him see what was happening across from him.

Sam finally moved. He reached out, and those mutated plants obediently delivered Jack right to him.

Meanwhile, Lily had already begun absorbing the energy to replenish her powers while swiftly clearing the area. Unfortunately, she was still no match for Sam’s speed and could only watch helplessly as Jack fell into Sam’s clutches.

Suddenly, memories of her past life surged through her mind, and a chaotic mix of emotions arose, ultimately coalescing into a desire to destroy everything in her path.

At that moment, Sam reached out, ready to seize Jack by the throat. But before he could make contact, he was startled by the sight before him: Jack’s eyes flew open, and somehow, his hands had slipped free from the vines that bound him. He grasped Sam’s wrist tightly.

“What’s going on?” Sam thought, trying to shake Jack off and seeking help from the system.

“Don’t worry, it’s likely he suddenly awakened. We’ll attack him immediately,” the system’s calm response eased Sam’s nerves just a little.

“Quick, call for Lily! Hurry!” Jack shouted, and upon hearing his voice, she hesitated for a moment before desperately moving toward him.

Meanwhile, Sam summoned all his energy to command the mutated plants to attack the two of them. It was a battle reliant on timing.

Lily unleashed her psychic energy, obliterating countless energy cores of the mutated plants and even extending her attack to the mutated insects. She seemed to have mastered this power instinctively.

Lily was on a rampage, while Sam was terrified. What was happening? Why couldn’t he control the mutated plants anymore? The mutated insects were no longer responding to his summons; it was all too strange.

Just as his system seized control of the energy to counterattack, he found himself unable to move.

Suddenly, a massive force began tearing at him, as if trying to rip the system away from Sam.

“Stop!”

In the midst of this three-way struggle, Lily had arrived. The voice had somehow joined forces with Jack to bind and control Sam’s system, attempting to extract it completely.

“Now’s your chance!” the voice seemed ecstatic. It craved the system's energy; if it could devour it whole, it might evolve into its final form. The abundant energy would surely impress the mainframe.

“This is far more energy than countless cores and seeds combined; the mainframe will be overjoyed.”

“Sam, you must stop this! If I cease to exist, you’ll have nothing!” The system wailed in despair, never having expected that such a powerful unknown force existed in this world.

Lost in its joyful dreams, the voice failed to notice that Jack had already consumed Sam’s system.

Sam, like a lifeless puppet, lost all of his powers, including his abilities.

Miraculously, the mutated plants and insects that had been attacking them just moments ago suddenly turned to ash with a loud explosion, scattering like feathers across the ground.

Lily and Jack were both stunned at the sight. What in the world was happening?

“Jack, you’re incredible! One strike and you annihilated the enemy’s system!” Jack had no idea what had transpired; his primary concern was Lily’s condition.

Lily swiftly crushed Sam’s chance to escape with just a flick of her hand, piercing his joints with ice spikes.

In agony, he howled amidst the ash and dust.

Just as Lily was about to deliver the final blow, a voice resonated through the air, captivating everyone present.

“Lily, bring these two into the space.”

“That voice! Wow, it's beautiful!” Both Lily and Jack stood in shock. Wasn’t it just a system? How could it produce sound?

Despite their myriad of questions, Lily took Jack’s hand, dragging the almost lifeless Sam into the spatial realm.

As soon as Sam entered this space, he was left in awe. He had never imagined this was not a mere spatial ability but a real existing space. He momentarily forgot the pain, but now, he lacked even the strength to sit up.

“Lily, we finally did it.” The voice lingered throughout the space, omnipresent.

On the screen, only the voice’s text remained, cluttered with meaningless praise.

“What’s happening? You can suddenly speak, and it’s in voice form?” Lily felt a strange shift, realizing that the transformation was likely due to the absorption of Sam’s system capabilities.

“This doomsday destruction system has been secretly siphoning the world’s energy. The massive energy allows me to speak, and once I absorb it all, I should be able to take form.”

“Wow! That’s amazing!” Still showering praise, the voice flooded the screen with an array of emoticons, creating a dizzying display.

“Doomsday destruction system?” Lily questioned aloud. Why would it want to destroy this world? Was its sole purpose simply to bring about destruction?

Both of them cast icy glares at the now immobile Sam, who wore a shocked expression. What doomsday destruction system? Wasn’t it supposed to be a doomsday counterattack system?

Seeming to sense Sam’s confusion, the voice spoke slowly.

“Foolish and arrogant person, you were used without even realizing it. Did you still think the system you bound was something good?”

“Wow, that was powerful and incisive!” Having absorbed the destruction system, the voice had gained not just energy but a wealth of knowledge. Facing the curiosity of Lily and Jack, it generously showcased it for them.

The voice’s text box shrank to a minimum, the sundial’s position also reduced, and soon, the screen displayed shocking and horrifying scenes, one after another.
