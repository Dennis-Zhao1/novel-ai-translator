**Father and Son Under Fire**

The tension in the air was palpable as Ivy, known by her alias "Ice Lotus," surveyed the room with a cold determination. She let out a chuckle, more of a warning than amusement, and muttered, "We're just getting started."

With a swift motion, she removed the gag from Grace's mouth, her dagger hovering menacingly near the vulnerable artery in Grace's neck.

"I can't give you anything more!" Grace gasped, her voice strained with desperation. She tried to suppress the bitter retorts bubbling up inside her, instead opting for a look of feigned helplessness.

Ivy, not easily fooled, watched her with a calculating gaze. She gestured with her hand, collecting all the supplies with a mysterious ease, her voice as cold as the steel she wielded, "There's more room now; keep going."

Grace's eyes widened in disbelief. She hadn’t expected Ivy to possess such a powerful dual ability. The realization stoked a fierce jealousy within her, leaving her feeling dizzy and defeated.

Once confident in her own capabilities, Grace now found herself overwhelmed by this unexpected turn of events. Her internal struggle was far more excruciating than the physical pain she endured.

Ivy, however, was relentless, beginning a countdown to increase the pressure.

Grace, known for her adaptability, realized that surviving was paramount. Her injuries were manageable, especially with the help of a healer within the base. What she needed most was time, time for someone to realize her predicament and come to her aid. Death was not an option.

Determined, Grace released a significant portion of her supplies, but Ivy simply repeated her earlier action, collecting everything once more.

Grace, left with no alternatives, continued her act, hoping to buy precious seconds. Ivy saw through her ploy and threatened further, demonstrating her dagger's icy attributes. "My dagger's edge is frosted. If it cuts you, the damage will be severe unless treated immediately. Delay, and you'll end up with scars that won't heal."

With that, Ivy illustrated the frost creeping over her dagger's blade, the chill radiating toward Grace's skin.

Terrified of disfigurement, Grace acted quickly, relinquishing her powers and filling the room again. Ivy was momentarily stunned by what appeared: military-grade weapons.

Grace continued to produce an array of items, leaving Ivy astounded by the risk Fu had taken, entrusting such critical resources to someone more concerned with beauty and survival than loyalty.

"Nine chances to lose, one to win," Ivy thought, bitterness tinging her realization.

Watching Grace cling to her identity as the young mistress of the Fu family instead of seizing power herself, Ivy couldn't help but question Grace's dependency on others—was she so reliant on men that she had forgotten how to stand alone?

Despite Ivy's calculated threats and slashes, Grace stubbornly insisted she had nothing left. Only then did Ivy sheath her dagger.

Seeing Ivy finally step back, Grace rushed for the door, hope briefly illuminating her eyes. But as Ivy reached for the doorknob, a deadly barrage of ice needles blocked Grace's escape, sealing her fate.

Ivy turned back to assess the aftermath. The ice needles had done their job, leaving Grace lifeless and riddled with wounds. The initial sight wasn't gruesome, but a closer look revealed the devastation beneath.

Finally, Ivy could begin to atone for past grievances.

As she set explosives in the room, intending to cover her tracks with a blast, a distant explosion jolted her senses. She knew she had to act quickly before the inevitable investigation commenced. Without hesitation, she leapt out of the window.

The Kunshan base's military forces were primarily occupied at the ceremony site and two warehouses. Ivy needed to avoid these hot spots, biding her time for the perfect moment to strike.

It seemed that the minimal security around Grace was a calculated move by Fu to keep their operations discreet, avoiding unnecessary attention.

Ivy had only dealt with Grace, but the Fu father and son still remained. She needed to confirm if Fu, as rumored, was truly invincible.

This time, she aimed for a conclusive victory.

With most people at the engagement ceremony, Ivy found an unoccupied villa to hide in. From its window, she had a clear view of Grace's villa entrance and prepared a rocket launcher.

Explosions echoed as Ivy detonated the charges she had planted. She was certain Fu would prioritize this location.

Sure enough, within minutes, Fu's car screeched to a halt at the villa, flames raging. Watching him desperately coordinate efforts to extinguish the fire, Ivy felt a thrill of anticipation. The moment had arrived.

With a steady hand, Ivy launched a rocket directly at Fu.

The explosion rocked the villa, and Ivy felt the shockwaves ripple through her hideout. She quickly retreated into her hidden space, counting down before re-emerging.

The villa lay in ruins, windows shattered and walls crumbled. She scanned the debris, seeking any sign of Fu—a telltale fragment of clothing, anything to prove he hadn't escaped unscathed.

When reinforcements arrived, bringing with them Fu Dingjin, Ivy realized something was amiss. Fu's absence indicated he had some protective mechanism, akin to a space ability, shielding him from harm.

Though frustrated, Ivy felt a drive to uncover Fu's secret. Whatever his defenses, she would dismantle them.

Since Fu remained elusive, she turned her sights on his son. Another rocket was launched, catching Fu Dingjin by surprise.

Once more, Ivy retreated into her space, re-emerging only after the dust settled. The second explosion had left the villa in ruins, and in its fiery glow, Ivy saw the grim aftermath of Fu Dingjin's demise.

With a sigh of relief, she stowed the rocket launcher and confidently departed. The Kunshan base was in chaos, explosions echoing in the distance, diverting attention from her escape.

Hopping into a jeep parked nearby, Ivy cruised through the base. Though she had accomplished much, she felt unsatisfied. She knew Fu was still out there, and she was determined to test the limits of his mysterious protection.

If his abilities were limited by cooldowns, she was confident that capturing him again would lead to his inevitable downfall.
