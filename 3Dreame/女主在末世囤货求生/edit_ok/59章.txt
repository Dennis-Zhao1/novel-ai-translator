**Living in Peace While Preparing for the Storm**

Within the fortified walls of the end-world stronghold, life felt like a hidden sanctuary. There were no relentless zombies gnawing at flesh, no crises over water shortages or power outages from the outside world.

The atmosphere was one of contentment and fulfillment. Dr. Smith and the researchers, who had returned with Uncle Joe, were busy in the lab at the office building, continuing their important work.

Lucy helped out in the cafeteria, mostly under the watchful eye of Mrs. Johnson.

Meanwhile, Logan and both the young and the old trained daily with Coach Mike. When they weren't training or out on missions, they enjoyed hanging out and laughing with that mischievous girl, Zoe.

Only those who had faced the harsh realities of the outside world could truly appreciate the precious moments of peace they now enjoyed.

The younger members of the Johnson family organized daily mountain patrols, checking the barbed wire along the walls. Any issues had to be recorded immediately for repairs.

The smooth operation of the stronghold was overseen by Uncle Joe and the older generation of uncles and aunts, who had backgrounds in military and political fields for security, while those with agricultural know-how managed the farming, and others with management and finance skills took care of supplies and distribution.

Logan held weekly meetings with Grandpa Joe and Uncle Joe to assess the stronghold's current situation and plan the next steps. However, her memories from her previous life only reached the fifth year of the apocalypse.

The global shift in the magnetic field marked a crucial phase, with human evolution occurring a few years after the changes began.

After extensive discussions with Uncle Joe and Dr. Smith regarding the mutations of the zombies, the core team unanimously decided to delve into zombie research.

Perhaps by uncovering the cause of the mutations, they could halt the apocalypse and save humanity.

The Thompson family had carved out a niche for themselves in the stronghold due to their expertise in crafting specialized tools, and they allocated space for their work.

The previous batch of tools had been discreetly distributed by Logan, with only the small teams receiving them; no one else had complained.

The Thompson family understood how to increase their bargaining chips and knew precisely what to do.

The storage space had also undergone a significant transformation, now filled with ripe wheat and rabbits scurrying about.

Who would have thought there would come a day when she would regret tossing out two rabbits in her space, especially a pregnant one!

Life is like a play, Logan mused. To prevent the rabbits from nibbling on the supplies, she chased them around the entire space, often falling flat on her face.

It wasn't until she turned catching rabbits into a unique form of physical training that the task shifted from nightmarish difficulty to a more manageable challenge.

As the days grew more stable, the tension in Logan's heart tightened.

She couldn't recall when it began, but she found herself gradually forgetting the exact time when the global magnetic field mutation was set to change everything.

Even the occasional task of capturing zombies for research became a way to sharpen her sense of urgency.

Logan understood this was not a good sign; while she could enjoy a comfortable life in the apocalypse, she must not lose her sense of vigilance.

With the in-depth research led by Uncle Joe and Dr. Smith, along with Logan’s seemingly magical return of research results and numerous reagents from the Level B2 bioengineering lab, the progress in studying zombie mutations was rapid.

It was already confirmed that the zombie virus was artificially created, not without cause.

This conclusion sent a chill down their spines; the unseen hand behind it all possessed the power to destroy the world, an unsettling thought indeed.

The next challenge was to unravel the code of the zombie virus to find a way to eliminate them.

Research required a considerable number of zombies for testing, and for an entire month, Logan and Coach Mike led a team daily to capture zombies.

To better educate those remaining in the stronghold and prevent them from growing too complacent, Logan carried her phone and drone to film their missions. It served two purposes: showcasing their team's strength to earn recognition for their efforts and imparting a lasting lesson on the importance of being prepared for the worst.

On this particular day, they set off to capture zombies again. Logan drove a riot-control vehicle at the front, with Coach Mike following closely in a modified truck. Their target was to capture ten zombies.

The area around the stronghold had remained safe, so they needed to venture into the city. The highway entrance had been cleared to create two passages. Their last zombie haul had come from an overturned bus.

To ensure a safe, quick, and effective capture of zombies, they brainstormed and established a series of operational protocols, including special mouth guards to prevent bites—one swift chop, a mouth guard fitted, and the zombie instantly lost its aggression.

Initially, there was a more straightforward method: simply sever the jaw, rendering the zombies incapable of biting. However, everyone found it too messy, with blood splattering all over.

By this time, autumn had set in. After half a year of training and growth, the team had undergone a remarkable transformation.

Take Tommy, for instance, the once timid and cowardly member, who had developed his unique, sly combat style. With a flourish of his specialized tool, he carried himself with the swagger of a rogue who had seen better days, each attack unpredictable—no one could guess where his next strike would land.

Alex's approach was similar to Tommy's but less sneaky and more visually appealing, sometimes even impressively choreographed.

From their initial, timid selves, the team now resembled an elite squad, which made Coach Mike feel an immense sense of accomplishment.

The two vehicles cruised through the highway toll booth, conversing cheerfully over the walkie-talkies as they headed toward the city.

During their first venture into the city last month, they had encountered a military squad clearing zombies and collecting supplies, hailing from the infamous Mountain Base known in her previous life.

They sent the most upbeat member, Alex, to gather intel, but he reported hearing nothing about Ethan. Could it be that the trick he had played on him before the apocalypse left him with no resources to sustain himself?

If this were the case, and it meant Ethan would never reach the heights he once had, Logan would celebrate with champagne!

As they reached the West Fifth Ring Road, gradually entering the residential areas, a small wave of zombies had returned after being cleared out last month. Logan's team was now dubbed the Raptor Squad, a name given by Coach Mike.

Every time they announced their squad name, Logan felt a surge of youthful bravado, while the others were quite proud of it.

Watching her team navigate effortlessly through the throngs of zombies, she thought to herself, enjoy these leisurely days before the zombies evolve, boys.

They expertly bound the captured zombies with chains to prevent them from harming anyone. The standard practice for the team was to pair up: one would chop off the zombie's arm at the shoulder while the other fitted the mouth guard. They lined them up, and the zombies would automatically follow whenever a living person stood in front of them.

Once they captured enough zombies for research, they would sweep the surrounding area clean of any remaining zombies.

Logan settled back in the vehicle as Coach Mike secured the cargo truck's doors, preparing to head back to the stronghold.

Suddenly, a group of people in luxury cars rolled up in front of them, some of whom were familiar faces.

Logan was not surprised they were still alive; those rich in resources had a far better chance of surviving the apocalypse.

What shocked her was their audacity in flaunting their lives in this chaotic world, as if nothing had changed since before the apocalypse.

It seemed that for them, zombies posed no true threat; instead, they had become a breeding ground for their unabashed wrongdoing.
