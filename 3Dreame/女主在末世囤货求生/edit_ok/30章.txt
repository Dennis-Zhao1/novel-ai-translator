**Arms Tycoon**

At this moment, the country was alive with the daily hustle and bustle. Following Ivy Bennett's seemingly boastful yet clarifying actions to dispel rumors, the online chatter shifted to a predominantly positive tone. People on social media turned the situation into a meme, laughing and joking, creating an atmosphere of excitement. The stock market, too, was flooded with good news.

Shareholders, previously anxious about potential drops in stock prices, collectively sighed in relief, grateful that their interests remained intact. More than that, they envied Ivy Bennett's incredible luck. Just attending a trade conference and casually purchasing a raw stone had netted her billions. With such fortune on her side, investing in her felt like a guaranteed win.

Ivy knew well that before any impending crises struck, she had to convert all her jewels and cash into supplies. There couldn't be any slip-ups. Her sister, Zoe, in a frenzy of excitement, commented non-stop on social media, "Wow, my sister is amazing!" She even jumped on the bandwagon on Twitter, retweeting posts in hopes of riding the wave of good luck. The wealthy elite in the country looked on with envy. No matter how rich one was, nobody ever complained about having too much money, especially when it came to a stroke of luck that seemed unattainable.

Having successfully reassured her shareholders, Ivy barely had a moment to rest. She swiftly organized the jewelry and accessories she was entrusting to Chris for trading. The jewels she had collected from the secret room in her family estate were carefully stored away. These items represented the family's heritage, and no matter how dire the circumstances, they could not be squandered.

Reluctant to part with her collection, she knew the gems she had already salvaged were enough to be liquidated. Ivy was fully aware of when to cash in on her assets. Using plain jewelry trays, devoid of any logos, she arranged the pieces she intended to sell, setting aside one or two high-end jade and colored gemstone pieces that she simply adored and had no plans to part with.

Once everything was packed into a wheeled suitcase, she was ready to go, just awaiting Chris to find buyers for the trade. After taking a moment to relax, she emerged feeling refreshed and took the opportunity to contact her grandfather, Mr. Johnson, and others to inform them of the trading schedule—cash on delivery.

Lunchtime came, but instead of dining at the hotel restaurant, she opted for room service. It was a holiday period, and many tourists were around. With her name trending online, she preferred to keep her whereabouts in Saudi Arabia under wraps. Everyone assumed she was still in Myanmar.

As the agreed time approached, Chris arrived to pick her up. Seeing the bodyguard, Mark, dragging two suitcases, he instinctively asked, "What's this?"

Could it be cash? Wealthy Saudis often favored cash transactions, and the remaining balance due was unlikely to fit in just one suitcase.

Ivy smiled and replied, "One suitcase of gold, and the other is filled with the jewelry I need you to sell for me. Once we've completed the inspection, we can find a place to review our options."

Chris nodded, understanding her intent. Upon arriving at the arms factory, the point of contact was already waiting with his men. This time, it was all orders belonging to Ivy.

After Mark followed the other party’s subordinates to inspect the goods, they verified the gold as well, calculating the balance to be deducted from the total payment. This was a reasonable move; as the Bennett Group was a well-known jewelry family, producing this amount of gold wouldn’t raise any eyebrows.

They contacted the logistics team from the Johnson family, prepared to ship everything to the port. Throughout the journey, Saudi personnel accompanied them, ensuring their protection against any potential ambush.

Once all the goods were loaded into the shipping container, Ivy promptly paid the remaining balance. This time, she used some of the gold to offset part of the payment. While waiting for the final payment to come through, she cleverly employed a familiar tactic, marking the goods and discreetly storing all the weapons into her space.

Ever since her psychic abilities had advanced, her speed and capacity for storing items had greatly improved, which brought her immense satisfaction—her sacrifices had not been in vain.

With her mind now brimming with energy, they had expanded significantly, allowing her to enter her space with no discomfort whatsoever. Ivy had also discovered she could use her abilities to observe her surroundings, albeit not over great distances. This talent had developed from her practice of locating items in her space.

In her previous life, without supernatural powers, Ivy was already a step ahead of everyone else this time. It seemed humanity's evolution had long been foreshadowed.

As Chris drove them to another arms dealer, she pulled down the privacy curtain in the middle of the car, displaying the jewelry from her suitcase directly to Chris.

Even Chris, who had seen it all, was stunned, seriously doubting whether Ivy had brought the entire Bennett family's inventory with her.

The "billion-dollar princess" title was indeed well-deserved, her worth substantial.

As she showcased the items, she stated, "These are pieces I don't particularly like. If they can sell, that would be best; if not, I'll just leave them to gather dust in storage."

Chris nodded impassively; the buyers he contacted likely wouldn't be able to consume all these items at once. After pondering for a moment, he pulled out his phone, had a brief conversation, and then hung up. "I’ve arranged buyers for 9 PM and 11 PM tonight; we should be able to sell everything."

Ivy had full faith in Chris's abilities and connections, nodding in agreement as she closed the suitcase and handed it to bodyguard Mark.

Before long, they arrived at the arms trading location Chris had recommended. It was situated alongside a desolate highway in the southern desert of Saudi Arabia, devoid of much else except a single gas station.

Once the car was parked, two employees in work uniforms emerged from the gas station. They exchanged some unspoken signal with Chris and led them towards the back of the gas station's convenience store.

Ivy found it intriguing; unlike the military factory in the slums, which had a complex terrain perfect for concealment, this place seemed too conspicuous. If someone were to lay in wait, they could easily capture anyone who approached.

Chris noticed her expression and whispered, "Don't worry, no one here dares to interfere."

Ivy understood what he meant; it seemed they were dealing with a formidable big shot. After all, the Johnson family’s order volume surpassed her own, and anyone capable of handling such a large order must have some serious clout.

Behind the supermarket was a fenced area, not very large, containing a small storage facility that appeared to be part of the supermarket's inventory. To her surprise, one of the employees walked to the storage door, pulled it open, and revealed an elevator.

Ivy instantly recalled scenes from movies; art indeed came from life.

The elevator doors soon opened again, this time revealing armed personnel who surrounded them warily and escorted them inside.

The interior resembled a fully underground bunker, with armed guards standing watch along the corridor. 

Ivy followed closely behind Chris, her eyes focused straight ahead. The only sounds were the footsteps and the sliding noise of the suitcase Mark was dragging along.

After nearly ten minutes of walking, they reached an empty office. A set of modular sofas occupied the space, with no other furnishings, not even a coffee table. Once they sat down, bodyguard Mark continued to stand guard behind Ivy.

While waiting, no one offered them a cup of tea or coffee. Ivy found it puzzling. Observing Chris's usual demeanor, she decided not to speak up.

It seemed they were dealing with a supplier who didn't care much for details.

After a brief wait, the office door was pushed open, and a man in a dark gray suit entered, accompanied by several of his subordinates. The subordinates quickly spread out, lining up against the wall.

The suited man casually sat on one of the empty sofas and, with a teasing yet mocking tone, addressed Chris, "Dear brother, I didn't expect you would be the one to reach out to me."

He spoke in English, and Ivy understood.

What was going on? Was this Chris's brother?

The attitude seemed quite peculiar...
