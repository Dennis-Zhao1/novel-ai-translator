**The Reluctant Team Leader**

As James Harding shut down the system screen, he noticed Lily Thompson resting her chin on one hand, her gaze fixed on him. As soon as he met her eyes, she leaned forward, curiosity lighting up her expression.

"What's up? Did you find something good? How many points do we need?" she asked, her voice full of eagerness.

James couldn't help but smile at her endearing demeanor, though the thought of humanity's potential downfall loomed in the back of his mind. His heart raced, but his resolve only grew stronger.

"Yeah, there are some good items, but they come with a high point requirement and there's a task prerequisite. Just having points won’t be enough to redeem them," he explained.

Lily nodded, understanding that nothing worth having came easy. She knew she needed to find items rich in spiritual energy to upgrade her space, and the system’s update couldn’t have come at a better time.

"What if we find mutated plants or seeds? Can we exchange those for points?" she inquired, tilting her head thoughtfully.

"That’s not in the task, but the system mentioned that seeds contain substances and energies they like, so they should be redeemable," he replied.

"Is there an exchange rate? Maybe we can negotiate. Just like that tale of borrowing arrows with straw boats, we’ll have our negotiator borrow seeds," Lily said, only realizing how silly she sounded after the words left her mouth. She cleared her throat, embarrassed.

James burst out laughing, and Lily shot him a shy, annoyed look, biting her lip. What was so funny about that?

He reached up to playfully ruffle her hair, but she swatted his hand away. "What are you doing? Just talk, don’t get handsy!"

Suppressing his laughter, he nodded, "Alright, let’s have our deputy work harder to secure those seeds sooner."

Lily rolled her eyes at him, dismissing the topic. Their banter had a way of lightening the mood, even amidst serious conversations.

"Hey, I'm back. There’s no record of this task in the mainframe data, so it seems there's a genuine bug," the Noisy Spirit chimed in, its voice echoing in James's mind.

"I’ve already reported the error; we can ignore it," he replied, feeling a familiar skepticism towards the system's reliability.

The Noisy Spirit assured him not to get too worked up, claiming their dominance in the system was a positive energy endeavor.

James remained skeptical, though. He had never fully trusted the system, and this only solidified his resolve to use it to mutual advantage without losing his autonomy.

He kept his thoughts to himself, and the Noisy Spirit, sensing that he was calm, returned to its silly antics, oblivious to the system tasks that needed fixing.

"Do you think she'll take the bait?" Lily pondered aloud. She had a decent grasp of the negotiator’s character; from their first meeting, it was clear she had lofty ambitions and a love for powerful allies.

"It doesn’t matter if she does or not. What’s important is for her to feel like she has the upper hand. For her, the deputy is a great entry point," James explained.

"Alright, then let’s wrap this up quickly," she replied, determined.

"The deputy knows women better than I do; he’ll definitely handle this better than I would," he remarked.

"Feeling a little insecure?" she teased, a playful glint in her eyes.

"Of course! I mean, how can I lack confidence when I don’t even have a title?" James's gaze turned serious, making her feel a bit uncomfortable. The conversation had veered into unexpected territory.

"Maybe it’s time for bed. I’ll head back," she said, a bit overwhelmed, practically fleeing the scene.

James stood to see her off, his tall figure casting a shadow that added an unexpected weight to the moment.

Feeling his gaze on her, she shivered slightly. He gently reached out, holding her wrist. "Are you cold? You’re shaking."

Lily sensed the underlying tension. What had happened during his absence? Had something changed?

As she realized his shadow loomed over her, she took a step back, leaning against the door, trying to push him away. But when her hand brushed against his chest, the warmth startled her, causing her to retract her hand.

She hated how flustered she felt. Steeling herself, she said, "Please maintain a normal social distance. You're a bit too close for comfort."

With a sigh, James took a half step back, creating a more comfortable space between them.

Finally able to breathe normally, Lily hurriedly opened the door. James stood silently in the doorway, eyes downcast, an air of disappointment surrounding him.

Once back in her room, she felt an inexplicable irritation. What was bothering her? She understood James’s feelings, but she found herself unable to respond. With a forced smile, she thought, what a hassle...

In the middle of the night, a shadowy figure appeared again. The deputy glanced up at the sky, rubbing his eyes. Did this woman never feel tired?

Her dark circles were so pronounced that they couldn't be hidden, and she clung to him during the day while still being awake at night. He couldn’t fathom where she drew her energy from.

Yawning silently, he noticed the negotiator still hadn’t returned. Climbing out the window, he quietly circled around to the other side where she had buried the seeds, overhearing her muttering to herself.

"Ugh, why haven’t they sprouted yet? Didn’t they say plants would grow the next day after being planted? What if they’re bad seeds?" 

After digging up the seeds she had buried, she examined the four seeds closely. In her initial panic, she hadn’t paid attention to them, and now, they looked like nothing special.

At first, he was worried she might discover him, but she was completely oblivious to his presence. With a resigned attitude, she buried the seeds again, obviously coming back to check on their progress.

It was laughable; she didn’t even water them. What kind of ordinary seeds could sprout under those conditions?

"If they don’t sprout soon, we’ll run out of time. No way, I need to ask them for more tomorrow. Four seeds are far too risky!"

Though her voice was low, it was clear in the stillness of the night. The deputy couldn’t help but grimace at her foolishness. With such a clumsy ally, the task difficulty had dramatically decreased.

Watching the negotiator sneak back inside, he felt a surge of frustration as dawn approached. He wouldn’t get much sleep before training began; this was more exhausting than being out on a mission.

James seemed to notice the deputy’s woeful expression. “Looks like your charm is working wonders. You really know how to navigate the waters between men and women. Otherwise, I could let Alex take the lead.”

The deputy perked up immediately. So the captain was complimenting his charm and emotional intelligence! In terms of looks, the ranking in the team was clear: the captain first, Alex second, and he was probably third. Receiving official recognition felt amazing.

Filled with newfound enthusiasm, he assured James that he would complete the task.

Watching the deputy bounce away, James suddenly realized Lily’s concerns weren’t unfounded.

Borrowing seeds was indeed a brilliant tactic. It seemed she had a knack for these things; perhaps she was a hidden strategist...

Handing off the most troublesome task to the deputy felt like a weight lifted off his shoulders. He might have been more effective himself, but thinking about his grim future made him resolve to tread carefully. He didn’t want to be criticized for being improper or unsanitary.

In truth, he had regretted his earlier decisions. There had been so many other reasons and excuses he could have used, yet he had insisted on dragging relationships into the matter. Now, he was left in a difficult position, facing the ridicule of the Noisy Spirit, which didn’t even count as a person!
