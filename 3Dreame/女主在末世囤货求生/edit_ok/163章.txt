**Frozen Gun: Adapted Version**

Behind them, Peter and his team were busy dealing with the fiery red creatures, while the rest focused on taking down the massive foe blocking their path.

Looking up, Ivy spotted a nearly six-foot-wide vertical hole. It was dark, but she could hear unsettling sounds coming from within. Concerned about what might be lurking, she decided against using fire again. Instead, she pulled out her air gun and fired several shots into the darkness above, then quickly moved away, just in case something decided to drop down.

Sure enough, as soon as she moved, something heavy crashed right where she’d been standing. It was a frenzied sea urchin-like creature.

"Great, just what we need," Ivy muttered to herself, trying to keep her spirits up.

“Hey Ivy, I’m picking up some bad vibes. Need to trade for some new gear?” came the voice of the ever-helpful system.

“Got any suggestions?” Ivy inquired.

“The Flame Dragon weapon is awesome against things that fear light and fire.”

“Got anything that doesn’t involve fire? We’re running low on air here.”

“How about an oxygen tank? It’s not that pricey.”

“Still too much; let’s keep looking.”

“I promise it’s affordable! You could just grab some of those crystal cores we passed earlier to trade for points.”

“Nice try, but I’m looking for something with more punch.”

“Alright, how about this—a Freeze Blaster? As long as there's water, it can freeze anything, and anything frozen shatters into shards.”

Ethan's eyes lit up at the suggestion. Perfect—no oxygen needed and environmentally friendly.

Without hesitation, he traded for the Freeze Blaster. The system sure had a way with bland names; such a cool weapon deserved something more imaginative.

The gun was slightly larger than the air gun, resembling those water guns from childhood. But instead of a hollow bottle for water, this one had a semi-transparent crystal chamber that looked almost like an energy stone.

He then turned to the water ability user in their team. “Can you spray those red creatures behind us? The more water, the better!”

Ivy was puzzled. She didn’t understand why it had taken several shots to take down just one sea urchin, and now Ethan was asking for water for some reason.

The water user, used to following Ethan's lead without question, began to spray a torrent of water, nearly extinguishing the flames in the process.

Seizing the opportunity, Ethan fired the Freeze Blaster. In no time, everyone watched as the previously jumping red creatures were encased in icy orbs. With another flick of his wrist, a small bolt of lightning shattered the ice orb into countless shards.

“Why didn’t you use this sooner? I’ve been working my tail off here while you’ve been playing with your new toy!” Peter complained, unable to hide his envy.

Ivy felt a spark of inspiration; she had never thought about freezing her targets before. This was a new tactic she definitely wanted to try next time.

With Ethan’s incredible weapon in play, the remaining red creatures became a breeze to deal with. The water user finally felt part of the action, and soon enough, they had frozen about ten ice orbs, some even stuck together. A casual strike sent them shattering across the ground.

“Such a stress reliever,” Mark remarked suddenly, turning to Luke. With his usual banter buddy absent, he was now settling for anyone who’d listen.

“Ethan, get over here!” Ivy suddenly shouted, seeing the frenzied sea urchins responding to their call, jumping out of the vertical hole in chaotic swarms. The water user suggested they switch turns; while Ethan’s blaster could keep firing, they needed a break.

Moments later, those mad sea urchins were also frozen into little lumps, meeting the same shattering fate.

However, Ivy’s focus was on the immovable massive boss. How could they possibly defeat it?

Dr. Smith would be thrilled to see it; he’d surely want samples for research.

“We need to figure out how to lure that big one out of the cave,” Ivy told Ethan. The air was getting thin, heavy with the stench of fish and burnt matter; smoke was beginning to choke them. If they didn’t ventilate soon, they’d have to retreat.

“Hang tight, I’ve got an idea,” Ethan replied quickly. He strode to the cave entrance and fired a bolt of lightning upward, producing immediate results. A series of annoying squeaks echoed from within.

It was indeed a sensitive ugly flower.

But oddly, the ugly flower didn’t budge. Despite the irritating sounds, it stayed put, stubbornly blocking their exit.

“We might have to pull back; I can’t breathe,” Peter called from the back, concern etched on his face as he glanced at Paul.

“Just a moment,” Ethan urged Ivy to fire some ice spikes at the ugly flower. Complying, she did just that. In the next second, Ethan’s Freeze Blaster followed suit. Confidently, without checking, he unleashed a bolt of lightning, expecting the ugly flower to shatter into pieces. Instead, he sensed danger approaching.

Luke quickly immobilized the flower with its head partially exposed, but the hold didn’t last long.

The giant ugly flower had firmly anchored itself to the mountainside and extended its tendrils as if to grasp them, and suddenly, Ivy realized its intentions—it wanted to capture them to nourish its offspring.

Disgust filled her as she recalled how the captain of the guard and two other members might have already become nutrients for this grotesque creature.

In a fit of anger, her attack power surged.

“Luke, focus on regaining your strength; don’t attack yet. When I call you, jump in immediately!” 

“Got it.”

The obedient Luke quietly stood back to recover his powers, while Mark gleefully used wind blades to slice at the tendrils.

Ivy noted that this giant ugly flower was significantly larger than the one from that night; it must have many more offspring inside. The sample jars were already prepared. Just then, Ethan called for the water user to spray again.

He planned to use the same strategy, but before the water user could get into position, the flower reached out with two more tendrils, making avoidance a significant challenge.

It was cramped, and Ivy had narrowly avoided disaster several times with her air gun, ensuring that Ethan and the others weren’t swept away.

With an air gun in one hand and the Freeze Blaster in the other, Ethan, shielded by the group, had the water user spraying a torrent of water. Ivy noticed the giant flower’s belly starting to undulate again—it was about to release its seeds.

“Ethan, hurry! It’s about to shoot out its seeds!”

“On it.”

Ethan responded curtly. Seeing the water was sufficiently sprayed, he unleashed a barrage of ice shots at the giant flower. Finally, it was successfully frozen. Breathing a sigh of relief, he realized it hadn’t frozen completely; the flower’s belly was cracking open, and its seeds were not yet encased in ice.

“Watch out!” he shouted to everyone. Luke was already in position, but it seemed they were just a moment too late.
