**Blessing in Disguise**

At this moment, Ivy didn't hesitate. She pretended to pull out four bottles of oral solution from her bag, having prepared them in advance for this evening.

Ethan took them with utmost seriousness, quickly handing them over to the doctor, urging him to inject them right away. Ivy's heart raced at the thought—could something so simple be used in such a crucial situation?

Jack had an inkling of what was happening, as he also assumed they would be taken orally. He was surprised when the doctor opted for an injection instead.

Watching the doctor open the bottles and fill a syringe with the solution, Ivy felt a twinge of anxiety. After the doctor injected the liquid into the IV bag, the readings on the monitoring device began to change rapidly. The doctor, visibly excited, exclaimed, "The blood oxygen levels are rising, and other indices are improving! This medicine is truly miraculous!"

Ethan couldn’t hide his excitement either. After telling them to make themselves comfortable, he returned to the bedside, gently brushing the hair of the woman lying there. Ivy watched this and felt something was off. She tugged at Jack's sleeve and whispered in his ear, "Didn’t they say she’s his sister? What kind of brother looks at his sister like that?"

Seeing the serious expression on her face, Jack sighed, trying to inject some humor into the situation. "You know how it is, sometimes family ties run deep. Let's head back and get some sleep."

Ivy detected the irony in his tone and pouted. What was the deal with this brother-sister thing? They were clearly a couple; why did they have to throw around those sibling titles? Who did they think they were fooling?

Just as she prepared to follow Jack out of the room, a sudden buzzing sound erupted in her head, loud enough to be deafening. She clutched her head, shaking it slightly, but soon the feeling returned to normal.

Her mind was racing with shock greater than what had just happened. This was bad; ever since encountering that eerie figure alone, something had been off. She wanted to call out to Jack but found herself unable to make a sound. Just as she reached out, another wave of intense buzzing overwhelmed her, and she pressed her ears shut, but it did little to help.

In the next moment, she seemed to see Ethan stand up and look her way, and she caught a glimpse of Jack pausing to turn back. The last thing she saw was her own reflection in the glass, collapsing to the floor.

“Beep... beep... beep...”

Where am I? Ivy found herself in an extremely empty space, devoid of anything. The surroundings were pitch black, the entire area felt void-like, with only the repetitive beeping sound filling the silence. It resembled the sounds emitted by some machinery, though she couldn’t pinpoint its source.

Ivy felt as if this place stretched endlessly with no exit. The beeping was regular yet irritating, and the temperature was dropping rapidly. She tried to use her mental energy to perceive her surroundings, but as soon as she did, a sharp pain shot through her head, forcing her to withdraw. She couldn’t even access her usual abilities.

In this space, she found herself powerless, as if a vortex was siphoning away her abilities. Her limbs felt heavy and weak. Suddenly, she realized she couldn’t continue like this. If she didn’t resist, she would be consumed, facing nothing but total annihilation.

Refusing to surrender ignited an infinite power within her. She had yet to resolve her grievances, and she wanted to live; she had to find an exit, she must survive!

Enduring the pain, she summoned her mental energy. The dull ache felt like someone was relentlessly smashing her head with a hammer, drilling into her temples, it hurt so much. She clenched her fists tightly against her forehead, and slowly, the darkness before her began to fade away. It was working.

She was elated to discover it was indeed working. Gritting her teeth, she pushed her mental energy to its limits; the pain seemed to plateau, no longer intensifying beyond a certain point. At least she hadn’t blacked out. Time felt irrelevant as the brightness of her surroundings increased, and the beeping grew more frantic. Suddenly, a sharp sound rang out, cutting through the noise, and the world fell silent.

The pain had left her drenched in cold sweat, her hands and feet icy. The scene before her transformed into blinding brightness, startlingly intense. She raised her gaze to see the surroundings, but the light was so glaring that she quickly raised her hands to shield her eyes. In the next moment, the brightness swelled further, to a point where even closing her eyes wouldn’t help.

Ivy hesitated to open her eyes, fearing the light would blind her. She hadn’t noticed that the pain and chill had disappeared; it was as if the light was solidifying, forming into a massive orb, barreling straight towards her.

Instinctively, she raised her hands to protect her head. In the next instant, it felt as though something shattered, or perhaps something was coalescing.

During the time Ivy was unconscious, Ethan was the first to notice her condition.

Looking at Jack, who was guarding Ivy's bedside, he hesitated before speaking up. "Ivy seems to be under a psychic attack. I distinctly felt the energy fluctuations from psychic abilities just now. It looks like her situation is quite severe."

The doctor, having been alerted, came over to examine her. The large medical equipment at the Longtown Base was not as comprehensive as that of the Apocalypse Fortress. Upon hearing that the injury was caused by abilities, he quickly called for a healer with healing powers.

Jack’s lips pressed into a thin line. He couldn't understand why this had happened so abruptly. He had warned Ivy before; her earlier good condition didn’t seem like a façade. What could have triggered this event?

The healing ability user arrived quickly, but to no avail. Ethan felt a wave of disappointment wash over him as he said, "My abilities are malfunctioning; I can't check Ivy's condition. I’m sorry."

Jack shook his head. He knew from his past experiences what Ethan had endured and understood why he didn’t act lightly.

After all, it was an attack that even normal ability users couldn’t withstand, let alone a patient.

“Ethan, what’s the range of psychic abilities?” Jack suddenly asked.

Ethan was taken aback for a moment, instinctively replying, “My limit is 500 meters, but if my abilities evolve further, the range will expand.”

“500 meters, huh? What if it’s him? What would he do?” 

Ivy’s troubles were clearly caused by the mysterious figure. Given that there had been psychic energy fluctuations, could it mean the attacker was nearby?

With this thought, he quickly stood up and walked to the office where they had just been talking, peering out the window. The sky at three or four in the morning was still dark, obscuring everything. A sudden premonition washed over him.

“I’ll step out for a bit.”

Ethan watched as Jack moved to the opposite room. He greeted his friend before rushing out, quickly instructing his men to guard the hospital room door, and followed closely behind.

Once outside the base, the two high-level ability users felt confident; as long as they didn’t encounter a horde of zombies, they could swiftly deal with the scattered ones.

They quickly reached the rooftop of the apartment building. Ethan sharply detected residual psychic energy in the area and immediately informed Jack.

Confirming his suspicions, Jack felt no satisfaction. They had missed the mysterious figure and potentially arrived too late, a surge of anger and determination boiling within him.

Ethan, having been through similar experiences, recognized Jack's demeanor. He approached and awkwardly patted his shoulder in a gesture of comfort, knowing they were returning empty-handed.

Meanwhile, during their absence, Ivy was overwhelmed by the brightness of the orb, feeling uncomfortable with her eyes closed. In a moment of urgency, she retreated into her mental space.

This time, she didn’t experience the throbbing in her veins or head. Instead, the light orb that followed her began to spread throughout the space, part of it drifting towards a realm within her mind, being absorbed by it one by one.

Ivy felt an unprecedented sense of ease, her mind clear as she looked up at the realm. She noticed the previous message displayed on its screen: 

“You have been invaded by a malevolent spirit in your consciousness; you must eliminate it quickly, or you will face life-threatening danger.”

It was still in cryptic script. Ivy read each word one by one, and as she processed the information, she immediately began to complain to the realm within her. 

“No wonder I’ve felt so unwell ever since encountering that eerie figure! It turns out I brought in something unclean that triggered a rejection reaction in this space!”

The realm then displayed four characters: 

“Congratulations on your breakthrough.”

Ivy found this somewhat perplexing. Did this breakthrough mean she had conquered the intruder in her consciousness, surpassing herself?

That interpretation made complete sense. She felt an immense difference between her current self and her previous self. She could automatically sense the situation after unlocking her mental energy, as if it had merged with her aura-reading technique, becoming more tangible. She formed connections with everything in the space, leading to an elevation of her mental energy.

What was this called? A blessing in disguise.
