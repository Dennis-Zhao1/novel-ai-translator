Driving Away

Ethan was getting anxious in the car. Generally, it would take no more than five minutes to come down from the sixth floor of the hospital, and even if things were slow, ten minutes would suffice. But now, it had been almost forty minutes, and Ivy still hadn't appeared. What if something serious happened?

He instinctively touched the phone in his jacket pocket, a habit from his days as a first responder. Although he didn't know exactly what was going on, the urgency in Ivy's voice suggested something big had occurred. After deliberating for a moment, he decided that if he didn’t see her in another five minutes, he'd go up and get her himself.

Fortunately, not long after, he saw three figures rushing out of the hospital's back door, their expressions filled with panic. Ivy quickly helped Mr. Johnson into the back seat of the car and closed the door before taking her place in the passenger seat.

Once Mr. Johnson was settled, Ethan pressed the gas pedal, sticking to the pre-planned route toward their safe location.

A wave of fear washed over Ivy, causing cold sweat to trickle down her forehead, chilling her to the bone as the car’s air conditioning blew directly on her. Ethan focused on driving, keenly aware of their surroundings, his vigilance heightened. He noticed that both Ivy and Mr. Johnson had spots of blood on their clothes. There was no time to ask questions; it was clear that some major incident had gone down at the hospital.

The hospital where Mr. Johnson was treated was a high-end private facility, far removed from the city's hustle and bustle. It was spacious and primarily focused on medical care and rehabilitation, with lush greenery and well-maintained roads providing a broad view of the surroundings.

In the passenger seat, Ivy tuned her senses to the maximum, feeling a bit reassured by the absence of people nearby.

Once they hit the highway, her heart finally started to settle. The traffic was light, and everything seemed normal, indicating that the situation hadn’t spiraled out of control yet.

She pulled out her phone and logged into various news sites, stumbling upon a trending topic: "Patients at a certain hospital suspected of rabies outbreak, attacking people." Clicking on it revealed that the incident had occurred at City Third Hospital. But why was there also chaos at Mr. Johnson's private hospital?

Could it be a ripple effect? Or perhaps she just hadn't paid attention in her past experiences? Regardless, Ivy pushed those thoughts aside. In the back seat, Mr. Johnson was busy calling family members one by one to confirm their safety.

She played the video she found, handing her phone to Mr. Johnson and the others. The footage from the hospital’s security cameras showed a blood-soaked man lying on a hospital bed, suddenly going berserk and biting the doctor who was performing CPR on him.

Screams erupted as everyone scattered, and it took a while before hospital security rushed in with a stun rod, prying the man off the bitten doctor, who was then carried away by other medical staff.

The video abruptly cut off there. After watching, both of Mr. Johnson's family members fell silent. It was clear that this wasn’t merely a rabies outbreak. Though the footage was grainy, anyone sharp-eyed would notice that the man’s vital signs monitor had gone off moments before he attacked. The heart rate monitor had flattened out, indicating that the medical staff had fought to save him, but he had suddenly transformed into a mindless creature intent on tearing others apart.

Ivy instinctively hit record, replaying the video and saving it to her gallery. She then scrolled through the comments, most of which fixated on why security had taken so long to respond, or why the other medical personnel hadn’t intervened sooner.

Then she saw a comment pointing out how it looked just like a scene from a zombie movie, where the transformation always starts like this. A flurry of humorous replies followed, and Ivy felt tempted to like that comment. But soon, it vanished, and the video became unplayable. It seemed that social media was once again censoring the situation.

Most likely, City Third Hospital didn’t want such incidents to tarnish their reputation. With the focus of public outcry on the hospital's security failures, it was understandable that they would want to control the narrative.

What was truly abnormal was how few people seemed to care about the incident itself, simply brushing it off as a rabies outbreak.

Ivy's mind was flooded with conspiracy theories, her head spinning with various ideas, and she felt a dull throb at her temples. The most prominent thought was whether this was a natural disaster or man-made, whether it could have been avoided, and if so, why it hadn’t been. She felt low, perhaps due to the perilous experience she had just endured. In her previous life, she had been one of those protected from the horrors of a zombie apocalypse, never having faced such terror directly.

She was mostly just feeling downcast, unwilling to accept the sudden loss of a once-beautiful world, now replaced by one of brutality and despair.

Mr. Johnson suddenly spoke up, breaking her reverie. “Ivy, is there any way to save someone after they’ve turned like that?”

Snapping back to reality, she replied, “I’m not sure. We need to determine whether this is caused by a virus or genetic mutation. But human evolution definitely doesn’t manifest like this.”

Ivy had always despised the idea that zombification was a form of human evolution. Zombies were monsters—emotionless, devoid of reason, driven only by a desire to consume.

Ethan, unaware of the specifics of their conversation, was already preparing to exit the highway. Meanwhile, Ivy continued to search for related content online. It was evident there were entries but no videos—likely still about the incident at City Third Hospital.

The outbreak hadn’t spread far yet, and she hoped it stayed that way. Every second spent outside was a risk.

Just as she tucked her phone away and noticed Ethan slowing down to enter the highway toll booth, their vehicle was suddenly slammed from behind. Everyone lurched forward slightly; if they hadn’t been buckled in, they could have been injured.

Mr. Johnson turned to look back and spotted the driver of the car behind them, his complexion pale and sickly, his eyes bloodshot with a yellowish tint. It was clear he had just turned into a zombie, losing control of his vehicle and crashing straight into them.

Ethan swerved the steering wheel left to avoid the oncoming car, and sure enough, once he moved aside, the vehicle behind them crashed into the one in front.

Ivy noticed an opening at the toll booth on the left and urged Ethan to drive through it. The car had already been hit; they could take the damage. Their armored vehicle was sturdy enough. She glanced back at the chaos, observing the second driver who had been hit angrily getting out of his car and slapping the zombie-turned driver’s windshield, cursing loudly.

He must have realized something was wrong with the other driver’s behavior but didn’t attempt to open the door. Instead, he called the police as the road became congested due to the accident.

Ivy wanted to yell for everyone to run; it was a zombie! But in a situation like this, no one would believe her. She wasn’t alone; there were many waiting for her at the fortress, and the lives of the Johnson family were entrusted to her. She couldn’t afford to get caught up in this chaos now.

With no other choice, she looked away, and Ethan had already completed the toll payment and exited the highway. Ahead lay a winding mountain road; in another half-hour, they would reach the stronghold. She resolved that the first thing she would do upon arriving was to post warnings about the outbreak online.

Even if only one person believed her, it could save a life.

The heavy atmosphere lingered until they entered the stronghold. After passing through three checkpoints, the four of them finally arrived at the fortress entrance. Ethan parked the car at the former base playground, now repurposed as a parking lot.

Mr. Johnson walked tall, followed closely by Ivy and Ethan, as they made their way into the lobby of the office building, all eyes on them.
