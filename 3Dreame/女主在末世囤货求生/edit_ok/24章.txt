**Hooking the Big Fish**

As the guests continued to enjoy their snacks and the lively atmosphere, a startling announcement cut through the air: Lucy Brightman declared her plan to sell shares of the Pearl Group.

The news sent ripples through the elite circles of New York. Many immediately thought of the Carter family, realizing the rumors were indeed true. Guests at the Smith family’s gathering began to excuse themselves, leaving the once-bustling hall to the staff tidying up.

"The youngest Carter is quite the shrewd operator," Mr. Smith muttered to himself.

After finishing his drink, he called for his driver and headed straight to the office.

That night promised to be sleepless for many business leaders of New York, except for a few key players within the Brightman and Carter families.

In the upscale neighborhood of East Hampton, Ben Franklin, overwhelmed by a barrage of calls from his father-in-law, finally snapped and turned off his phone. He accelerated, pushing the speed limit as he raced to his father-in-law's house.

As a son-in-law, he was acutely aware of his position within the family hierarchy. Even after twenty years, he never let his frustration show.

Before entering, Ben took a moment to gather his thoughts and adjust his slightly loosened tie. He greeted the elderly man seated in the living room with a warm smile.

"Grandpa, I’m back."

The other guests barely acknowledged him, nodding politely as they continued their refined discussions.

The old man, dressed in a classic suit with silver hair and bright eyes, gave Ben a cursory look before nodding toward the sofa beside him.

"Sit."

His tone was dismissive, showing no sign of respect for outsiders. Once seated, Ben kept his head down, choosing not to speak first; this was just how things went at such gatherings.

"Ben, we just received news that the Brightman family is selling shares of the Pearl Group," the old man said, his voice low yet commanding.

Ben's eyes widened in shock as he looked up at his father-in-law. This was news he hadn’t anticipated. Given his understanding of the Pearl Group and the Brightman family, this wasn’t something that should be happening right now.

Unfazed by Ben’s reaction, the old man continued, issuing orders like a general.

"You and John need to buy up as many shares as you can. Do it quickly."

A chill ran down Ben’s spine; something felt off about this situation, though he couldn’t quite place it. John handed him a folder, and Ben quickly skimmed through the pages.

So, it was the Carter family making a move. That explained everything.

But from what he knew, the Carters and the Brightmans weren’t supposed to be in direct conflict—especially considering the friendship between their patriarchs, which was well-known in their circles. Frowning in thought, John seemed to read his mind.

"Cousin, the Carter family patriarch is in critical condition at the hospital."

That explained a lot; it all started to make sense.

"Get moving. Timing is everything. This needs to be handled swiftly." With that, the old man stood and headed upstairs, leaving the two men to follow his orders.

"Yes, Grandpa, Uncle," they replied in unison, rising to their feet.

John quickly assembled his team as he and Ben began making rapid arrangements to execute their plan.

Meanwhile, at her chic Manhattan apartment, Lucy Brightman had just finished organizing her space for the day, panting from the effort.

"Help! Having such a vast space isn’t as glamorous as it seems," she lamented, realizing that even using her electric scooter to zip across took forever. "I need to hire someone to help with all this moving around. Since when have I ever been the one to do all this heavy lifting?"

After discovering the space was filled with a tapestry of projects, her vision of it transformed from barren to vibrant.

Driven by her perfectionist tendencies, she began dividing the area into sections, organizing all her supplies and equipment neatly. Otherwise, it would be chaos, making it cumbersome to retrieve what she needed.

"This is so inefficient," Lucy sighed, wishing her space had a system like the inventory settings in the online games she used to play, allowing her to customize the layout.

Just then, she noticed that the text on the mirror had changed, as if it were trying to communicate with her.

"Space upgrade requires energy stones."

Lucy pouted at the mention of energy stones, recalling how they were rare and valuable gems—worth a fortune and difficult to source.

Glancing at the towering pile of supplies, she felt a wave of frustration. An upgrade was crucial, but where would she find energy stones to “fuel” her space? She couldn’t very well go digging in remote quarries.

"If only I had an energy stone mine," she mused, lying back on the plush carpet and watching the clouds drift by outside the window.

A mine? Wait, didn’t South America have some mines?

Excitedly sitting up, she looked at the mirror. "Would you accept gems from South America?"

The mirror replied, "All energy stones are acceptable."

Lucy then pulled out the collection of jade jewelry she had acquired from Ben last time, showing it off to the mirror.

"Would you take these?"

The mirror responded, "Lacks energy; unusable items."

Lucy rolled her eyes, annoyed. "What do you know? These are top-quality jades, exquisite pieces! You just don’t appreciate fine things!"

Seeing the space’s lack of interest in such valuable items left her feeling conflicted. On one hand, she was glad to keep or even sell them; on the other, she was stressed about where to find “fuel” for her space.

If only I could feed on black market goods, she thought, her eyes lighting up with a spark of inspiration.

With someone like Ben around, there had to be more like him. Plus, with her intuition and her energy sensing having improved during the last upgrade, she could use those abilities as a detection tool.

With that thought, her anxiety vanished, and she nearly struck a pose, proud of her cleverness.

Dreaming of the next upgrade featuring an auto-organizing function, Lucy temporarily shelved her perfectionist tendencies and focused on her next steps.

The news of Pearl Group’s impending sale had already spread far and wide; everyone who needed to know was aware, except for the Carter family. The connections her grandfather had left behind were reaching out, but unfortunately, they weren’t from New York’s elite—one was from an ancient city, and the other from a declining military family.

Lucy subtly hinted that she could manage things on her end, sending a resource list to the contacts, just in case.

That was all she could do for now. She deliberately turned off her phone, having worked hard in her space all afternoon, and was exhausted. After a good night’s sleep, she woke up around ten the next morning.

Turning her phone back on, it immediately lagged with notifications—calls and messages flooding in, many from familiar yet unfamiliar numbers.

She skimmed through the messages but mostly focused on identifying who had reached out, finding that many were from friends in her business circle probing her for information, which she deemed less important.

After a quick breakfast, she drove to the office. As soon as she stepped out of the car, a group of familiar faces from the recent business gathering surrounded her.

Feigning surprise, Lucy greeted her elders and ushered them into the company, leading them directly to the conference room.

While her assistant busied themselves with refreshments, Lucy discreetly pulled out her phone to post a picture on her social media feed.
