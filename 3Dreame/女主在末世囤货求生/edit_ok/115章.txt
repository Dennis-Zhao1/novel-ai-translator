The Zombie Siege

On the way back, Ivy sensed something was wrong. Through the rearview mirror, she spotted the zombies trailing behind her. Normally, when vehicles passed by, zombies would react, following closely in pursuit. It wasn't unusual for a horde to get attracted, and taking advantage of a turn, she looked back and indeed saw a sparse group of zombies, with a particularly menacing one among them.

Its hollow eyes, rotting half a face, and that eerie grin would've terrified Ivy before, but now she felt ready to test the limits of her mental abilities against it.

She noticed that this zombie was a bit clever; it wasn't charging in directly but was hanging back, summoning more zombies to join the chase. As more and more zombies flocked toward her, Ivy remained calm. She was already on the way back to the fortress, and ever since the last zombie siege, everyone was itching for another round, especially the team members on the verge of breaking through to the next level of abilities.

Navigating through the zombies with a serpentine maneuver, she avoided their various abilities while flooring the gas. While speeding down the road, she didn’t forget to fire off a few ice needles as a counterattack. If anyone were watching, they’d see a chaotic scene: a lone vehicle twisting and turning at high speed with a horde of zombies hot on its tail.

The thrill of the chase was something Hollywood couldn’t even dream of capturing, she thought, as one moment she was counterattacking and the next suddenly dodging a low wall of earth that a zombie had conjured. That was a close call! Has the zombie upgraded its abilities?

The thought of harvesting their crystal cores excited her even more. She pressed down harder on the accelerator, drawing more zombies toward the fortress. Clutched in her hand was a flare gun, a precaution set up after the last siege. If a large number of zombies approached, this signal would warn everyone.

Listening to the thuds of abilities striking the armored vehicle, she felt her investment in this sturdy ride was worth every penny. If she’d been in a normal car, it would have been wrecked by now. To ensure the zombies kept chasing, she deliberately controlled her speed, maximizing their interest in her.

However, as if they sensed her intentions, the zombies ceased their pursuit on the winding mountain road. Even when Ivy slowed down purposely, they wouldn’t follow. Were they becoming sentient?

After several rounds of testing, she was baffled to see the zombies seemingly disbanding. They had come all this way, and now they were leaving? Too bad! She parked the car at the roadside, thinking that the fortress was only a short distance away. With a flare fired into the sky, she turned and dashed up the slope.

Finding a large rock to hide behind, she noticed the zombies swarming toward her. But she couldn’t let them easily form a circle around her. Gathering her thoughts, she decided to use her mental abilities to disrupt the zombies’ minds. It was her first time employing this tactic against the undead, but it felt as if she was born to do it. A wave of mental force surged forth, and the zombies froze in place, as if their brains had short-circuited.

Seizing the opportunity, Ivy unleashed a barrage of attacks, aiming for a swift kill. Before long, a circle of zombie corpses lay at her feet.

The more she fought, the more exhilarated she felt. These were not terrifying zombies; they were merely delivering her fresh ingredients.

Each of them carried shiny crystal cores, but taking on hundreds of zombies alone was exhausting. She glanced distantly to see a continuous stream of zombies seemingly called forth, joining this bounty-hunting expedition.

Fighting and retreating, she extended her frontline. The mental abilities consumed much more energy than her ice powers, so Ivy began absorbing the crystal core energy with one hand while releasing her powers with the other. To her surprise, it was effective; the cores acted like portable power banks. Thankfully, she had a substantial reserve, mostly higher-tier cores, with the lower-tier ones becoming increasingly rare.

Her eyes narrowed at the clever earth-type zombie that kept trying to trip her up. It was smart, coordinating with others to block her escape route and using earth spikes to ambush her, forcing her to change direction multiple times, nearly getting caught by other abilities. It even sheltered behind its fellow zombies, one remaining eye watching her with a sinister glare.

If she weren’t so occupied, Ivy would have loved to curse it out—something personal.

Watching as the distance closed, she utilized her modified flying claws, shooting an arrow-like device into a sturdy tree on the hillside. The tip embedded into the trunk with a satisfying "ding," springing open to create a triangular metal hook, anchoring it in firmly. With the press of a button, she soared into the air, landing atop the tree.

She took a moment to absorb the crystal cores, wondering why Ethan and the others hadn’t arrived yet. The flare had been launched a while ago, and she had already taken down over a hundred zombies—surely they should be close by.

Not having time to ponder further, she noticed more wind-type zombies closing in. Using her mental abilities to restrain them, she unleashed her ice powers to finish them off. From her elevated position, her field of vision was expansive, and the distance kept the attacking zombies off-balance, unable to strike her accurately.

Most of the zombies trying to approach the tree were dealt with, but that crafty earth-type zombie, lacking a good shield, had exposed itself during the chaos. Ivy quickly tried to control its movements mentally. Oddly enough, she found she couldn’t. Normally, zombies controlled by the intelligent one would either succumb to her control or experience a momentary daze, yet this earth-type showed no such reaction.

The only explanation was that the intelligent zombie hadn’t exerted control over it; it either couldn't or didn't need to.

Furrowing her brow, Ivy realized it posed no threat from her elevated position, so she focused on eliminating the other approaching zombies first.

Compared to the intelligent zombies, the mindless ones were akin to simpletons, merely charging at her. Thankfully, the tree was thick and sturdy, resilient against their powers. As she watched the zombies desperately trying to reach her, they all fell at the base of the tree, creating a pile of bodies. She feared that if this continued, the bodies would stack high enough to form a ladder for the zombies behind to climb up. She needed to find another high vantage point soon.

As the third batch of crystal cores turned to dust beneath her, the pile of corpses grew higher. She maintained her distance, picking off the zombies before they could get close, determined to keep the pile from rising any further.

The intelligent zombie attempted another mental strike against her. Had it been a while ago, she would have surely been hit, but now she felt its mental force trying to invade her brain, strong and aggressive. However, her own mental prowess was formidable. Just as they were engaged in a fierce mental tug-of-war, reinforcements arrived.

Ethan and Jake drove the armored vehicle up the mountain, cutting through the horde of zombies, effectively sandwiching them between themselves and Ivy.

The intelligent zombie’s commands began to falter. The zombies that had once charged solely at Ivy now sensed the humans approaching from behind, instinctively launching an attack. Those with abilities unleashed them, while the others lunged to bite, only to be instantly dispatched before they even took a step.

Ethan, also on the edge of breaking through to the next level, saw the walking crystal cores piled high and his eyes lit up with excitement, sparkling with determination. The other ability users joined in with fervor, fighting not like they were on a mission but as if they were celebrating a festival. They unleashed skills as if there were no cost or energy expenditure.

Meanwhile, Jake was worried as he fought his way forward, wanting to check on Ivy’s situation.

At that moment, sweat began to bead on Ivy’s forehead. She was in a mental face-off with the intelligent zombie, an evenly matched opponent. The intelligent zombie could clearly sense its controlled zombies becoming agitated. It couldn’t afford to move or lose focus, while the human opposite it could multitask, attacking other zombies simultaneously.

Feeling the risk of defeat in this standoff, it surprisingly communicated with the earth-type zombie hiding among the horde, and the two grotesque creatures began to coordinate.

Seeing the intelligent zombie twist its face into a disturbingly sinister smile, Ivy, who had been keeping a close watch on it, felt alarmed. Sure enough, a spike of earth shot up from the ground directly toward her position. Ivy quickly dodged, swinging off the hook and soaring away just in time to evade the spike before landing back in her original spot.

At that moment, the mental link with the intelligent zombie was severed, and the next instant, she felt a piercing mental force hit her like needles. Without hesitation, Ivy slipped into her spatial pocket.

The lock-on failed, and the intelligent zombie, its eerie smile frozen in shock, realized its guaranteed victory had evaporated in an instant. Enraged, it let out a high-pitched scream, only to be struck by lightning powers, the sound of its cry trembling as it echoed in the air.
