**Poisoning**

After the ten members at Longvale Base completed their physical examinations, they were administered with awakening agents. Meanwhile, the driver sent out by Lily—who had been fending off zombies—finally regained consciousness. His mind was set on confronting Lily.

Once calmed by others at Longvale Base, he sincerely thanked Ethan and the others. Meanwhile, Lily remained confined in the dormitory area, blissfully unaware that she had just brushed against danger.

That day, Mike, the vice-captain, was busy setting up a training session in the courtyard. The other ten members, feeling restless after being cooped up, decided to join him. They all knew that only those who were physically fit and passed health checks were eligible for the awakening injections.

In the shadow of a nearby tree, Lily sat with a bright smile, watching Mike lead the training session. Her apparent joy was misleading; she was actually disappointed since Ethan had only shown up once and then disappeared. Her plans to charm him had come to a standstill, leaving Mike as a fallback option.

Her goal had always been to target the most outstanding and powerful man in the crowd.

As the teammates began teasing Mike, the Longvale members exchanged glances, unsure whether to voice their concerns. They hadn't forgotten Lily's true nature and felt it necessary to warn Mike, who seemed quite taken with her.

Unfortunately, after the training, Mike whisked Lily away for a private conversation, leaving the others no chance to intervene. A group watched from a distance, expressions ranging from amusement to pity, while some clicked their tongues in disapproval.

Seeing Lily dabbing Mike’s forehead with a handkerchief prompted several teammates to gasp in unison. They muttered about how the atmosphere felt tense.

Mike was showering Lily with sweet compliments, his ruggedly handsome face lending a strange credibility to his words. If a less attractive man had said the same things, Lily would have dismissed them as empty flattery.

Perhaps due to loneliness, Lily now seemed increasingly reliant on Mike. She clung to him, eager to awaken her powers and escape the confines of the dormitory.

“Lily, are you feeling alright? You look tired,” Mike observed, concern filling his voice as he scrutinized the dark shadows under her eyes.

His gaze felt intense to Lily, and the two of them inched closer together as if drawn by an invisible force.

“Ahem,” a fake cough startled them, prompting them to quickly create some distance. Lily, unsure if she was genuinely shy or just pretending, lowered her head and turned away, not even noticing who had entered.

Mike looked up awkwardly to see Sarah standing in the courtyard, her expression one of disdain. He waved his hands, urging her to leave and not to interfere.

Sarah rolled her eyes in irritation, seemingly intent on stirring the pot. “Are you two together now? I remember someone was clinging to someone else's boyfriend not long ago. Did you switch targets that quickly?”

Sarah thought she was being subtle, avoiding outright accusations of Lily's fickleness, but as soon as Lily heard her words, she exploded with anger.

“Unlike you, at least I liked someone else's boyfriend! You just directly stole your friend's boyfriend. How can you say anything to me?”

Lily's face turned crimson, a mix of embarrassment and rage.

Mike placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder and gently patted her back to calm her down.

Sarah raised an eyebrow, clearly amused by Lily's reaction, pretending to be concerned. “Well, I guess it's just my charm. Do you really think anyone is going to pay you any attention?”

Lily was furious, tugging on Mike's shirt as if seeking his support. He feigned ignorance, softly advising her not to be upset, maintaining an air of not wanting to offend Sarah.

Sarah pressed on, “Half of the fortress belongs to my family. What do you have, being a lonely girl? Pathetic.”

“Fine! I can move out today. You can stay here by yourself,” Lily declared, suddenly realizing she couldn't continue to wallow in what she thought was love. The man in front of her couldn't stand up for her; all his so-called tenderness felt insincere.

However, she didn’t show her true feelings, masking her vulnerability flawlessly. Mike, witnessing her demeanor, felt his heart race, recalling how she had once desperately banged on the door, her cries etched in his memory. He might genuinely find himself enchanted by her.

“Alright, stop crying. If you keep it up, you won't look good,” Mike said, using the handkerchief meant for wiping sweat to dab away her tears. The salt from the dried sweat stung her eyes, and what had started as a feigned cry now turned genuine.

Lily wore a cheerful facade, internally cursing. If anyone found out about this, it would be utterly humiliating.

She dramatically wiped her eyes with the handkerchief, no longer interested in arguing with Mike, and headed back to her room.

At that moment, Sarah was ready to leave, having packed her things. Lily kicked the door open, annoyed, and asked, “Where do you think you’re going?”

Sarah, initially uninterested, noticed Lily's reddened eyes and exaggerated her response. “Why do you care where I go? I'm moving in with my mom; I refuse to squeeze into a room with certain people. It's utterly annoying!”

“How can you just leave?” Lily exclaimed.

“The fortress belongs to my family as much as it does to anyone else. Is your hearing bad? Maybe you should consider donating your ears,” Sarah retorted.

“You stole someone else's man, and you can still wander around freely?” Lily exclaimed, incredulous.

“Hah! You think everyone is like you? She can have any man she desires; it's only fair that her friends like her too. But you’ll never experience such things in your life, since the men she doesn’t want wouldn’t even look at you. Tsk, if I were you, I’d rather be dead.”

With that, Sarah shouldered her bags and walked away, leaving Lily fuming with impotent rage.

Unaware of the disdain directed at him, Mike felt incredibly pleased with his recent performance, convinced that he had Lily wrapped around his finger.

Meanwhile, Lily faced an incessant barrage of setbacks, leading her to a fierce resolution.

That night, while Mike thought he could finally sleep soundly, his eyelids twitched violently. He couldn't fall asleep even as his teammates began to snore.

Opting to visit the restroom, he spotted a familiar figure sneaking around and climbing through a window.

He turned on his heel, hastily following her. This time, Lily wasn’t just tending to her garden at midnight. He watched as she pulled out a package from her pocket, which looked like some kind of powder, and poured it into the gutters surrounding the dormitory.

Seeing this, Mike's heart raced, his instincts screaming to act. He stifled his unease and, once Lily finished her dubious task and headed back inside, he quickly retrieved the crumpled package of powder she had discarded.

Without hesitation, he climbed over the wall and rushed to find Ethan, his mind solely focused on the urgent need to report this to the captain and Miss Laura.
