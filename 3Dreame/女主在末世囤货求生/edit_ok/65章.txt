**Cover-Up and Concealment**

Sam looked at them with a puzzled expression. "You say you saw who stealing?"

"It was them!" Jack, who had just been hit, stubbornly pointed at Lori. "Those two were sneaking around our warehouse last night, moving supplies. When we caught them, they wouldn’t admit it and even assaulted my brother, forcing me to kneel and slapped me!"

Ethan continued to apply pressure with his foot, causing the man beneath him to scream in agony. "Sam! Sam! I’m your Uncle Mike! Please help me!"

As the other Smith family members moved to assist, Lori swiftly drew the knife from Ethan’s waist, placing the blade against Jack’s neck with a smile that seemed laced with poison.

"Come on, say that again. Speak nicely."

"What are you doing? Are you enraged and planning to use the knife? You’re beating people and slandering us, and now you want to kill to silence us?" Jack stared at the cold gleam of the blade on his neck, nearly wetting himself, and desperately signaled to Sam.

Sam felt torn. On one hand, he had teammates he trained with and went on missions to help others, and on the other, he had family members, even if they were distant relatives.

Seeing their expressions, Lori suddenly sheathed the knife, handing it back to Ethan, and smiled at Sam. "Oh, look at me, there’s no need for such trouble. Here, let me show you something interesting."

Lori gave Ethan a glance, who kept the knife unsheathed, blocking Jack’s path while standing on the wailing Mike. The six members of the patrol team gathered around Lori as she opened her phone’s photo gallery and played a video—one without any filters or edits.

The video was brief, just a few minutes long, showing the two Smith brothers shouting to be released and claiming they were wronged. Sam’s face turned ashen as he glared at them. This was truly embarrassing for the Smith family.

Lori added mockingly, "Oh, I forgot to mention, I don’t need to steal anything."

Everyone was momentarily stunned. Some quick thinkers immediately suspected that Lori must have stockpiled supplies privately or received a generous stash from her grandfather. But unexpectedly, she raised her chin and declared, "Everything in this entire warehouse belongs to me."

Of course, few believed her. They had been living there for so long and had never heard of such a thing.

Then, Lori turned her tone to ridicule and said to Jack, "I thought you knew it was mine and came to steal it. Turns out, you had no idea? Taking what belongs to your own family? Does Grandpa Smith know about this?"

The two Smith brothers were completely stunned.

Though Sam wasn’t as cunning as Sue, he could still see the obvious truth. He immediately ordered the patrol team to restrain the two and lock them in the security team’s office. Other patrol members took the keys to the warehouse from them and locked the stolen goods in a nearby room.

Lori felt miserable, but she was somewhat comforted that none of her people from the Johnson family, Parker family, or Ethan were present. This made her more accepting of the situation.

It was too late to disturb Grandpa Smith’s rest, so the next day, Sam reported the incident while Lori slept in late, reluctant to get up. It wasn’t until noon, when the old housekeeper coaxed her out of bed for a meal, that she realized something was off. When she arrived at the cafeteria, Aunt Lisa had set aside a warm plate of food for her. It reminded her of yesterday’s events, which still had no resolution.

She wouldn’t let that ruin her meal. After eating and joking with Aunt Lisa and the old housekeepers, she bundled her down jacket and headed toward the office building.

The indoor heating made the outside cold even more pronounced, and she hurried into the office building. Upon reaching the security team’s office, she found it empty, even though she had seen them lock the two men in the day before.

Lori was a bit confused and was about to go upstairs to find Sue when the security team leader came down the stairs and blocked her way.

"Lori, just the person I needed to see. Let’s talk in our office."

Lori was just about to ask about the two thieves and followed him into the office. Unexpectedly, the security team leader didn’t sit in the sofa area but rather behind the desk in the boss’s chair.

What does this mean? Lori, puzzled, didn’t take a seat but leaned against the door frame, raising her eyebrows to look at him.

He assumed an official demeanor, sipping his coffee and beckoning her, "Lori, don’t stand there. Come in and sit down."

He was pointing to the chair across from the desk. After having been a boss for a few years, Lori understood the underlying message. This was an attempt to put her in her place. Ignoring him, she walked straight to the sofa area, chose a prominent single sofa, and sat down gracefully.

So, he wants to play power games, huh? Who doesn’t know how to do that?

This security team leader was from the third branch of the Smith family, the son of Grandpa Smith's younger brother. He had been calling John “Uncle” for decades. Usually, he didn’t have any remarkable achievements, nor was he particularly capable. Originally, the position of security team leader should have been filled by Grandpa Smith's son, who had a military background. However, due to health issues in recent months, the position was given to this third branch brother.

Lori was aware that the Smith family was large, and due to varying degrees of closeness, there would inevitably be some internal maneuvering. She could overlook these dynamics as long as they didn’t affect her interests.

However, her interests were clearly being compromised, and now they were pulling this stunt on her? They were dreaming.

Lori crossed her arms, curious about what tricks they were planning.

"Hey, Lori, why aren’t you coming over to sit? Don’t be so distant with your Uncle Smith."

"Team Leader Smith, this spot is just fine. The room isn’t big, so if you have something to say, just say it."

The security team leader’s face fell, his previously composed expression now clearly upset.

Lori couldn’t care less about his feelings. Nestled in the sofa, one hand propping up her face, she crossed her legs and looked at him as if to say, "If you have something to say, hurry up."

"Lori, about last night’s incident, it was all a misunderstanding. I looked into it and wanted to let you know that everyone was sent home this morning. You shouldn’t pursue what happened with them. Your uncle has something to say: how could you lock up your two uncles for a whole night? That’s really not showing consideration for your elders."

His lengthy lecture wiped out Lori’s previously cheerful mood in an instant. How could someone be so oblivious to her perspective?

Lori stood up, turning to leave without a backward glance. She directly went upstairs and knocked on Sue’s office door, while the security team leader followed her, trying to persuade her.

"Lori, everything has been resolved. What’s the point in looking for him? After all, there’s no loss, and we should all learn to tolerate each other while living together. It’s all just a misunderstanding."

She knocked for a long time without anyone answering. Sue seemed to be away, and Lori’s patience was wearing thin.

"Do you think saying it’s a misunderstanding makes it a misunderstanding? Were you even there yesterday? Did I confront those two face to face? Don’t you know I have video evidence of them stealing? The entire patrol team witnessed it, and you didn’t even ask a single question!"

Her rapid-fire questions left the security team leader speechless.

Giving up on knocking, Lori headed back down, planning to find Sue in the biology lab. The security team leader followed closely behind. When they reached the office door, he exchanged glances, and suddenly, patrol team members appeared at the entrance, blocking her way.

During the lunch break, everyone in the administrative part of the office building had gone out to eat and rest, and wouldn’t return until two in the afternoon. The security team leader had taken advantage of this moment when no one was around to arrange for his people to control Lori, claiming it was to help her calm down.

As for what to do after controlling her, he hadn’t thought that far ahead. He had only promised the fifth branch’s brothers that he would help smooth things over.

Seeing this setup, Lori realized they intended to silence her, and perhaps even wanted to eliminate her altogether.
