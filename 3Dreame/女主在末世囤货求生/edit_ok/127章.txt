**The Return of the White Lotus**

Liam and Ethan had long suspected that the so-called secret was connected to Max Burton. They never imagined it would be a plan to annihilate all of humanity's civilization. Coupled with his deceitful tactics of turning skilled individuals into puppet warriors, it became clear that he aspired not to be a savior but the king of chaos.

What he was trying to create was the so-called new humans, right? The so-called savior spreading rumors outside was merely a tool he used to deceive the masses. No wonder he was so intent on disrupting the peace of the fortress; he wanted to first use the fortress's ability awakening potion to turn ordinary people into skilled warriors, only to have them transformed into puppet soldiers. His ambitions were truly grandiose. It was no surprise that he had sent undercover agents in with the sole purpose of gaining power, using the promise of strength as bait.

If it weren't for the fact that the two of them already knew Max Burton was not as clever as he thought, they might have fallen into his trap as well. Who wouldn't want to become stronger? Once everyone in the world became a skilled warrior, the hierarchy would remain the same—those with stronger abilities would dominate the ordinary ones.

Liam nodded and replied, “It's outrageous! He’s paving the way for his ambitions with the lives of everyone in the world. What good will it do him if everyone is gone? It’s utterly incomprehensible.”

“Exactly! I thought he already held significant power at the Silver Lake base. My family and I were living happily until he destroyed everything,” Ethan said bitterly.

“Now that we're at this point, even if we cooperate and reach an agreement, will you be able to return safely to your father?” Ethan asked, hitting the critical question.

“It shouldn’t be a problem. I’ll just say you guys were experimenting on me and that I accidentally awakened my abilities and escaped. All the other skilled warriors died, and I was the only survivor. Even if he doesn’t believe me, he won’t easily attack me. After all, I’m his only son.” He let out a cold laugh, recalling the unpleasant experiences, like an obsession gnawing at his mind, preventing him from moving on.

“Since you’ve made up your mind, let’s stay in the fortress for a few days. After you’ve been injected, you can go back. It’ll also give us a chance to test your father’s intentions,” Liam quickly decided. This surprised Nate; he thought this would take longer. After all, if he successfully awakened his abilities and was Max Burton's son, it wasn’t impossible for him to turn against him.

Arranging for someone to take Nate down to rest, Ethan looked puzzled. “Do you really trust him enough to ally with him?”

“Why wouldn’t I? You’re acting strange; weren’t you the one who made contact with him first? Why are you questioning it now?”

“It’s not that I’m questioning; I just can’t be sure if he’ll really do that. After all, that’s his father.”

“I trust him. When he mentioned his father, there was no warmth at all—only hatred and disgust. He likely knows his father is insane; who knows when he might decide to get rid of him for being an ordinary person? If he doesn’t cooperate with us, what choice does he have? People like him always strike first.”

Nodding, they waited for the situation to unfold.

The news of Nate’s capture spread, yet Max Burton didn’t make a move, seemingly having abandoned this son. Nate’s expression turned solemn; it was hard to tell if he was disappointed or not.

After removing the hidden stakes Max Burton had planted, the remaining ordinary people all passed their physical exams and were scheduled to receive the ability awakening potion. The demand and storage for crystal cores were elevated to the agenda.

Outwardly, Ethan and Zoe continued to present themselves as traitors, keeping the outside world in a state of confusion. Even if Max Burton didn’t believe them, some bases were already stirring. During this time, Ethan had led a team to the Redwood base, where they fulfilled their previous agreement: a major deal exchanging crystal cores for awakening potions.

Ryan happily invited Ethan and the others into the base. Some of his base members had also been brainwashed by the so-called savior, resulting in a loss of personnel. Originally a base of over five hundred people, it now had fewer than three hundred, with more than a hundred ordinary people being previous employees from Redwood.

After understanding Max Burton’s scheme, Ryan was furious and desperately hoped to increase the number of skilled warriors. They had stored a portion of the crystal cores, but it was far from enough to supply awakening potions to everyone. Ethan suggested a staggered awakening; the fortress also had around three hundred ordinary people waiting for injections, and they wouldn’t be able to supply the potions immediately.

In reality, it wasn’t that there weren’t enough raw materials; it was just that the lake water Liam provided had unique components. Previously, Ethan had concocted a story about acquiring it accidentally. Even Dr. Smith couldn’t replicate it, so they had to send Ethan out to search for it. Such rare items, even if Liam could produce several large barrels in moments, still required some pretense to obtain.

This back-and-forth delayed the production of the potions, making them seem even more precious and rare.

“Captain Ethan, thank you and Miss Liam for saving my life,” a fair-skinned woman with long straight hair and delicate features said, wearing a casual denim dress as she expressed her gratitude to Ethan in Ryan’s office.

Zoe, mistakenly thought to be Liam, stared blankly as the woman bowed to her, immediately jumping up from the sofa to hide to the side. “I’m not her! You’ve got the wrong person!”

Ryan chuckled softly, pulling the woman’s hand to sit next to him on the sofa, introducing her, “Shannon, this is Miss Zoe. Miss Liam is busy and couldn’t make it.”

“Oh, so it’s Miss Zoe! It’s truly a pleasure to finally meet you,” Shannon replied, but her tone rose oddly, causing Zoe and the people nearby to exchange confused glances.

“Captain Ethan, you sure are lucky! But your taste seems lacking,” Shannon remarked, attacking without discrimination, just as Ryan’s powers did. Ethan was left speechless.

Just as he was about to explain, he remembered that this was a mission and also a smoke screen. Zoe opened her mouth, then closed it again, mentally berating herself for meddling and putting herself in a difficult position.

Talk about social death.

“Alright, Shannon, you should go rest. Captain Ethan and I have some important matters to discuss,” Ryan quickly interjected, sensing the awkward atmosphere and wanting to send Shannon away before it worsened and jeopardized their alliance.

“Hmph! You men are all the same—looking at what’s in front of you while eyeing what’s in the pot!” Shannon huffed, shaking off Ryan’s hand, glaring at both him and Ethan before storming out.

Ryan forced a smile, trying to explain, “I apologize for the scene. Please don’t take it to heart.”

Ethan picked up on something, teasingly asking, “Ryan, did you just have a major slip-up?”

After all, Ethan and Liam were merely seen as helpers to Shannon. Such a strong reaction could hardly be attributed to him.

Ryan laughed awkwardly, lowering his voice, “My former deputy’s cousin came to the base not long ago. Unfortunately, my deputy sacrificed himself long ago, and I thought I should treat his only family well. I gave her some privileges and attention, but now she’s upset.”

As Ryan spoke, he seemed to recall his fallen deputy, letting out a sigh.

Ethan understood this feeling and didn’t press further. Meanwhile, Zoe rolled her eyes skyward. After just being reprimanded, she discovered she was merely a scapegoat. It was outrageous how casually they described a girl’s attempts to curry favor—it was pathetic.

At this moment, as Shannon angrily prepared to return to her room, she unexpectedly encountered someone she disliked the most. If Liam had been present, she would have immediately recognized the world-renowned saintly figure who loved to compete with women while dragging others down—none other than the perfect little white lotus.
