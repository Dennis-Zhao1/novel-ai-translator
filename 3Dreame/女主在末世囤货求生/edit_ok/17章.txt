**The Great Gold Heist**

Ivy Bennett felt as if her heart had stopped for a moment, her breath catching in her throat. She dared not move, standing quietly behind the oak tree, her whole body cloaked in shadows.

She was ready to draw her gun from her hidden compartment at any moment. Suddenly, a man burst out of the rundown chapel, sprinting madly in the opposite direction, chasing something unseen.

Ivy remained on high alert, blending seamlessly into the forest, matching her breath to the gentle rustle of the leaves. She was unaware that her instinctive actions already hinted at the profound truths of nature.

But that wasn't the most crucial matter; what mattered was why the man hadn't returned yet. Ivy found herself trapped, unable to leave or enter. If she slipped into her hidden compartment, she wondered how long she would have to stay there, trapped in the stagnant flow of time. The longer she lingered, the greater the torment would be, and it was better to keep the initiative in her hands.

Fortunately, after a short while, the man returned, dragging something behind him, muttering curses that echoed distinctly in the dark night.

“Damn it! I always feel a chill at the back of my neck when I come here. Turns out it's you, old man, peeking around!”

With that, he spat on the ground and flung the object he was dragging onto the floor. Ivy knew she was safe now; she cautiously peeked out.

The headlights illuminated a middle-aged man covered in blood, his clothes dirty and wrinkled from being dragged along, stained with signs of a brutal beating.

“Dan, please... stop... I... I was just... uh...” Before he could finish his plea, Dan kicked him squarely in the chest.

“Brother? You dare call me that? Last time I asked you to join us in making money, you chickened out, leaving me to almost get caught! Master Foster directly stripped me of my title because of you! Do you know how much I lost? Now tell me what you saw!”

The beaten man crouched, clutching his chest, begging for mercy.

“I didn’t see anything! I was just... curious!”

“Curious, huh? Well, let's see how curious you can get!” Dan roared, grabbing the man by the hair and trying to drag him back into the chapel.

The beaten man struggled fiercely, but just then, Dan's phone rang. He released his grip, violently throwing the man's head back to the ground before stepping on it.

Pulling out his phone, he answered with a voice completely different from before, now laced with a flattering tone.

“Master Foster, I’m here... Yes, it’s all set up... No, I didn’t mean to ignore you; I caught a tail. I was just interrogating him... Alright, I’ll bring him back now.”

After hanging up, Dan wasted no time delivering more blows. He dragged the man over to the trunk of his car, opened it, pulled out some rope, and bound the man's hands. With a dirty rag, he stuffed it in the man's mouth and shoved him into the trunk before speeding away from the chapel, blasting his favorite DJ tunes.

Cautious as she was, Ivy worried whether he might return unexpectedly. She waited for another ten minutes before finally stepping out from behind the tree, confident that she was now safe.

Using her intuition, she expanded her mental reach to explore the surroundings. There were no signs of life—no people, not even small animals. Instead of entering through the main door of the chapel like Dan, she found a section of the wall that had partially collapsed and climbed inside.

As she approached the wall, her intuition picked up the glimmer of precious gems from within the chapel. She quickly assessed the environment and layout of the small courtyard, carefully treading into the main hall. Although Dan had tried to erase his footprints, he had done so rather clumsily.

Feeling the need to use her intuition here was a bit excessive, but Ivy followed the tracks left behind until she stood before the statue of a saint. Like many other chapels, this one was dedicated to a saint but had long fallen into disrepair; the altar was barely standing, supported by only three and a half legs, with the broken part propped up by a few bricks.

This was nothing like the high-tech security or heavily guarded vaults she had envisioned. Instead, it all seemed so casual and absurd.

How deeply had Foster understood human nature to dare make such a bold move?

Not wanting to waste any more time, Ivy donned gloves retrieved from her hidden compartment and began to rummage through the altar. Underneath, she discovered several bricks and, upon prying them apart, found a wooden board. Lifting it revealed a dark hole.

Using her mental energy, she found no snakes or insects lurking within. Taking a deep breath, she boldly descended the wooden ladder into the dark cellar. The air was stagnant, and she switched on her flashlight, revealing several identical black duffel bags stacked up—about seven or eight in total.

Pulling one open, she was greeted with a trove of gold bars and jewels. The gold bars were practically unpackaged to save space, while the jewels were wrapped in layers of protective foam and newspaper, resting atop the gold.

It was clear that this stash was part of Foster's fortune. Ivy quickly placed everything into her hidden compartment but paused to reconsider. Instead of taking everything, she unzipped each bag, emptying its contents and replacing them with a stack of bricks she had casually collected from the farm's warehouse.

Bricks were useful too—perfect for building shelters or, in dire situations, for dealing with zombies—one brick could take out a pesky monster.

After meticulously cleaning up her traces, she replaced the wooden board, arranged the bricks neatly, and set the altar back to its original state. With that, Ivy swiftly exited the dilapidated chapel.

It wasn't until she was back in her car, driving toward the rendezvous point she had arranged with her assistant, that she finally exhaled in relief. Once on the highway, she found a roadside stop and changed out of her clothes, using makeup remover wipes to clean her face before tossing them away.

Her assistant assumed the boss merely wanted to experience the difference between a budget car and a luxury vehicle, so he didn’t ask any questions as they drove back late at night.

That evening, Ivy didn’t return to her old house. After informing her housekeeper, she went back to her apartment at Crestview Heights.

She needed an entirely undisturbed environment to carefully evaluate just how much the items seized from the Fu family were worth.

After washing off the dust of the day, she packed her clothes into a black bag and tucked it away into a corner of her hidden compartment, planning to toss it out when the apocalypse finally came.

Sitting cross-legged among the pile of gold and jewels, she felt as if she were opening a mystery box, tearing through the foam and newspaper.

“Wow, luck is on my side! This is an old pit glass jade ring, and from the craftsmanship, it's definitely from Taiwan. The diamonds are also high quality!”

As a jewelry appraiser, Ivy understood how to store jewels properly. Before she began, she had moved several black velvet-lined trays from her home’s storage room to the side, allowing her to unpack and categorize everything neatly.

She opened several packages in succession, growing more excited with each reveal, murmuring to herself, “This is a Sri Lankan cornflower blue sapphire ring; it must be worth a fortune at auction!”

Or “Not bad, a very transparent emerald. Hmm, it’s just a bit small, but the quality is excellent. The design is too outdated though; it’s a shame for such a high-quality centerpiece.”

Her hands moved swiftly, making her feel like a live streamer opening mystery boxes filled with all sorts of gemstones and bracelets of varying values.

Just as she reached for the next newspaper-wrapped package, she suddenly sensed a surge of energy from her hidden compartment.

Looking up, she scanned her surroundings in confusion. What was happening?
