**The Overlooked Changes**

Ivy Thompson was acutely aware that she'd gone too far this time. It felt like someone had grabbed her by the collar, dragging her destiny along with them. But with the alcohol still muddling her mind, she couldn't quite identify who the audacious soul was that dared to disrespect her.

She struggled fiercely, trying to resist this reckless person. In her hazy state, she thought she heard a muffled grunt followed by a sigh.

The next morning, Ivy awoke with her head pounding, rubbing her temples as she sat up in bed. Realizing she was in her dorm room, she lay back down, feeling as though she had just woken from a dream she couldn't quite recall. She silently vowed never to mix drinks again; it truly was dangerous.

A gentle knock on her door brought her back to reality. It was Mrs. Smith, her kind-hearted neighbor, bringing over some hangover remedy. Ivy caught sight of her own messy hair and the way a stubborn strand stood up, and couldn't help but laugh. No matter how old she got, she would always be a girl at heart. Mrs. Smith urged her to freshen up and have the tea, then left with a warm smile, taking the empty cup with her.

Before long, there was another knock at the door. When Ivy opened it, she was surprised to see Ethan Carter. He stepped inside, and she wondered if he was already hungry for brunch.

Settling onto the couch, his long legs taking up a considerable amount of space, Ivy diverted her gaze and asked, “What do you feel like eating today?”

Ethan raised an eyebrow, a smile flickering across his face, then turned serious. “Food can wait; we need to talk. It’s kind of important, so brace yourself.”

Ivy was taken aback; it was rare to see him like this, and her curiosity was piqued. She gestured for him to continue. 

“Remember that incident with the psychic attack? When you woke up, you were in pretty bad shape. How are you feeling now?”

Thinking back on her reactions and how she felt now, Ivy shrugged casually. “I’m okay. After some rest, I feel great.”

“That’s a bit strange,” Ethan said, frowning as if deep in thought.

“What’s strange about that? I’m healthy; isn’t that a good thing?” Ivy replied, feeling a bit annoyed by his concern.

“Last time, there was someone who went through something similar—an ability user who was attacked. He seemed fine at first but suddenly got worse. During that time, he had headaches and even hallucinations. It turned out his powers were unstable.”

Ethan's voice took on a somber tone, a cloud of sadness surrounding him.

Ivy considered his words carefully. She realized that aside from her initial symptoms, she exhibited none of those issues. “I don’t have any of those problems. I was careful, so there’s no need to worry too much.”

Seeing her unconcerned expression, Ethan decided it was best to quickly eliminate any lingering threats, just to be safe. He didn’t linger, rising to take his leave, and Ivy, noticing his hurried demeanor, didn’t think too much of it.

After a day spent handling various matters and checking on the community, she returned to her sanctuary and immediately sensed something was off.

As soon as she entered, a sharp pain pierced her head. The once comforting energy now felt prickly and uncomfortable, causing her to feel unwell all over. 

Not wanting to force herself to stay any longer, she quickly exited, instantly feeling a wave of relief wash over her. In her haste, she didn’t notice the strange glow from the mysterious artifact.

Initially believing it was a side effect of the attack, she avoided entering the space for the next few days, simply retrieving what she needed from outside.

During that time, she consulted her brother Jack, having him check for abnormalities, and even went for a medical checkup. Reflecting on Ethan's warning, she concluded that it was indeed wise to check for any issues.

When the report came back normal, she felt somewhat reassured. She decided to return to the sanctuary later to ask the mysterious artifact what was going on.

Still grappling with her headache, she was soon informed by one of Ethan's contacts about some news regarding Victor Brooks.

That afternoon, in Ivy's office, Ethan toyed with his coffee cup before sharing the information his contact had relayed. “Victor is currently at the Riverton base, trying to secure the position of second-in-command.”

Ivy was puzzled as to why his expression soured after delivering that line. “The Riverton base is where I was before. The leader there is incredibly powerful and surrounded by loyal subordinates. If the Oakridge base hadn’t fallen into chaos, it might have been able to compete. But with the current turmoil, it will be tough.”

Ivy frowned in confusion. “So, without you there this time, will the Riverton base still be strong?”

Ethan nodded. “In my previous experience, I was only a figurehead. The real powerhouse of the Riverton base was Alex Perry. Even at my peak, I wouldn’t have been able to defeat him.”

Upon hearing this, Ivy’s eyes widened. In her past experience, Ethan had just reached a high level and was already a prominent figure among ability users; if he was at his peak, he would undoubtedly be even stronger.

“What kind of abilities does Alex have?”

“Psychic abilities. His powers have a particularly wide range of damage, making it hard to distinguish between friend and foe. He was invincible at the same level.”

Ethan’s voice became a bit hoarse as he took a sip of his coffee before continuing, “Once, he encountered a psychic threat and neutralized it instantly; it was just a matter of seconds.”

Ivy had experienced the might of psychic abilities firsthand, so she couldn’t help but be astonished by his description. It seemed that Alex could take lives with just a thought, which was undeniably powerful.

With this revelation, she quickly pressed for more information. “You mentioned Victor is trying to become the second-in-command at the Riverton base. What’s his leverage? Most of his supplies and weapons are in my possession now, and his eldest son is no longer a threat. Could he still have stockpiled a significant amount of resources and weapons outside while we’ve been busy?”

Ethan noticed the growing chill in her tone and reassured her, “Not necessarily. I suspect it’s likely due to the abilities of his system.”

Ivy lowered her gaze, recalling that she hadn’t overlooked Victor’s strange behavior in her previous experience. But at that time, she was ensnared by the falsehoods surrounding her, much like a cocoon that trapped her. Victor was adept at playing the role and using flowery language to charm her, making it easy for her to let her guard down. Besides, she had needed to rely on him back then, so she unconsciously ignored the warning signs.

She recounted some of Victor's past actions and tactics to Ethan, analyzing, “Victor had a wife in his past. I even saw him with her a few times when I entered the Oakridge base. She was a frail and beautiful woman. After that, I never saw her again. He had a wife but openly kept a mistress—it’s disgusting. I remember he only got into the Oakridge base because of his father-in-law.”

Ethan nodded. In the pre-apocalyptic world, Victor had close ties with some of the upper echelons of the Oakridge base. He had often heard people in the military mock Victor for being a sycophant, saying he would ingratiate himself with his father-in-law and wife, and later with military leaders, claiming that a man who lived off his in-laws had no backbone.

At the time, he hadn’t paid much attention to it; there were plenty of people in the military seeking favors, and he thought little of it. It wasn’t until the apocalypse that Victor gradually seized power and began targeting him both openly and covertly that he started to suspect whether Victor had a hand in his downfall in the last life.

This latest threat seemed to be related to Victor as well. Whether it was aimed at Ethan or Ivy, it was clear that he was retaliating, and they couldn’t allow him to continue to grow stronger. Otherwise, they wouldn’t know what they would be facing next time.
