**Unexpected Black Hole**

Lucy Bradford was taken aback. It didn’t make sense; someone delivered meals to her every day. How could she suddenly be gone?

“What happened?”

Behind Anna, a breathless guard rushed in, tasked with watching the premises.

“Miss Bradford, I just delivered the meal and found the prisoner... she was tortured to death.”

Ethan and Liam exchanged glances, realizing this was a significant issue. Who held such a grudge against the seemingly innocent girl? If it were just to silence her, a single act would have sufficed. The fact that there was time taken to torment her indicated someone in the apocalypse fortress harbored deep-seated hatred. But perhaps it was for the best; she was just a small pawn.

After a moment of contemplation, Lucy glanced towards a figure on the training field.

Ethan followed her gaze, frowning slightly.

“Let her be. Just get rid of the body; we don't want it stinking up the place.”

The person in charge nodded in agreement and hurried off to arrange the cleanup.

Ethan remained noncommittal; this situation wasn’t worth their time or energy.

Ethan took another glance at the figure in the crowd before returning to Lucy’s office with her.

They engaged in a friendly yet heated negotiation over the pricing of the ability enhancement potions. After several rounds of back-and-forth, Ethan secured what he deemed a reasonable price, and Lucy wore a pained expression, making him feel even better about the deal.

Liam, who had never been in business before, watched the fierce bargaining with keen interest. He found it impressive—one party feeling victorious while the other feigned a loss, both knowing the truth was somewhere in between.

How fascinating.

Anna watched Lucy wield her words like a skilled negotiator, her sharp tongue and quick wit even more captivating than her regard for someone she had feelings for. Ethan sensed something was off, his brows furrowing deeper.

After they shook hands to finalize the order, a sense of ceremony enveloped them as Sarah drafted the contract for both parties to sign.

Seizing the moment, Liam suggested they enhance their abilities within the fortress before returning to Longstone Base. After all, making the trip was no simple feat. Ethan nodded in agreement, leaving oversight to Anna and another subordinate. They should be fine for a few days.

Dr. Smith had also mentioned needing more experimental cases. The fortress was safe and allowed for real-time monitoring. Besides, she felt perfectly fine after her injection, much better than Dr. Smith and Little Luke.

Since they required cash upfront in exchange for the potions, and Ethan had to go out to gather crystal cores, Lucy wouldn’t accept any debts. Therefore, Liam and the others would accompany the Longstone Base personnel to hunt zombies, while she remained at the fortress to practice her new skills.

The day after Liam and the others left the fortress, something bizarre occurred.

A deep, dark pit suddenly appeared in the fortress square, and no one knew when it had emerged. The earth-type ability users couldn’t fill it in; when they reported it to Lucy, she had just spent a long time in her spatial realm. Having mastered her new skill, she quickly changed her clothes and hurried to the scene.

It was indeed a massive black hole, roughly ten cubic meters in size, about the size of a small room. The earth-type ability users looked pale, as if the black hole could swallow everything whole, and it showed no signs of responding.

Mr. Brown dispatched people to fetch stones and soil from the back mountain, but to no avail. Lucy used her mental powers to probe it; not only was it unfathomably deep, but she couldn’t sense anything—not a zombie or any living creature.

They hastily arranged for a fence to prevent anyone from falling in. The crowd buzzed with speculation. The scientific faction suggested it was due to tectonic movement or the depletion of underground water leading to sinkholes, while the mystics claimed it was a dragon’s den—inside which a dragon was poised to ascend. Then there were the doomsayers who believed it was a tunnel dug by the zombie king, orchestrating earth-type zombies to slaughter everyone.

Lucy found the arguments from both the scientific and doomsday factions quite reasonable. After all, wasn’t the zombie king just Frank? However, whether the zombies had dug the tunnel remained uncertain. Strangely, her sixth sense kept insisting that the key lay with those four mutated plant seeds.

After calming the crowd, Lucy dismissed them, arranging for a team to enhance patrols in the vicinity. She also hung a large bell beneath the flagpole in the square; anyone who spotted unusual activity was to sound the alarm. Beyond that, she didn’t have a better solution.

There was something else she needed to do. Privately, she sought out Mr. Brown, and once they were seated in her office, he spoke candidly.

“I was the one who killed that woman.”

Lucy raised an eyebrow, signaling him to continue.

“Lucy, I’ve seen that woman getting cozy with Frank. She’s his woman.”

Lucy gasped in surprise.

“When did you see Frank?”

“During the time you all went to Longstone Base, I went out myself.”

“Mr. Brown, you’re quite bold. Back then, you weren’t even an ability user. Didn’t you fear dying at the hands of zombies?”

“I’m not afraid of death; I only fear dying before I avenge my son.”

Mr. Brown's voice was resolute, and Lucy felt a pang of emotion.

“Mr. Brown, we share a common enemy; you don’t need to hide anything from me.”

Mr. Brown’s eyes were bloodshot, the image of his son’s tragic death flashing in his mind. He clenched his fists tightly, his expression filled with sorrow.

“Lucy, you don’t understand. If I don’t do anything, I can’t find peace.”

“Alright then, Mr. Brown. You’ve killed that woman; I have no objections. But in the future, if you have any plans or actions, please inform me. I’m concerned our plans might conflict.”

Mr. Brown nodded. He was unaware of Lucy’s strategies, but now that he was an ability user, he had more options. To avoid future clashes, it was prudent to communicate.

“What do you think about this giant pit?” Lucy suddenly asked.

Mr. Brown took a deep breath. “I’m not sure, but I have a bad feeling about it.”

Nodding, she politely urged him to leave. Just before he exited, she added,

“Mr. Brown, I need you to help me with something.”

Mr. Brown paused mid-stride, turning back to look at her.

“I suspect there are deep-seated moles within the fortress that need to be uncovered. Can you help me find them?”

Lucy had only just thought of this arrangement. Mr. Brown could infiltrate the dungeons and eliminate enemies even with guards and patrols present. His meticulous mind, swift movement, and deep-seated hatred made him a suitable candidate who wouldn’t overlook any enemy’s minion. It was the perfect solution.

To her surprise, Mr. Brown didn’t hesitate at all and immediately agreed.

“I’ve been thinking the same. The personnel in the fortress are mixed; even though some have been cleared out, who really knows? Not every person from Longstone Base is clean. I’ll keep a close eye on them.”

Lucy nodded in satisfaction. She thanked him for his efforts, and Mr. Brown added,

“Is Ethan trustworthy? Should we check him first...?”

Without a moment's thought, Lucy replied, “He’s trustworthy; no need to check.”
