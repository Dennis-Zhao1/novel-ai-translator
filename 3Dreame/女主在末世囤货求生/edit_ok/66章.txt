**Conflict Erupts**

In an instant, anger surged within Ivy.

Inside the compound, she never carried weapons with her. Firstly, she believed it was her territory, so there was no need. Secondly, she thought that carrying a weapon would make people wary and create distance. She considered everyone here family, so she felt it was even less necessary.

Never did she expect that while she viewed them as family, they would think of her as a fool.

In all the key positions within the compound, Ivy hadn’t placed a single person from her side, not even the Smith family, who were only handling their usual affairs. Mrs. Smith and a few other staff from the old residence spent their days either busy in the cafeteria or working in the fields, essentially earning their keep.

The old steward managed the warehouse and her daily needs, without reaching into the office building or the biological laboratory. She often took Tom and others out on missions—rescuing people and dealing with emergencies.

Yet, in the end, this is how she was treated.

It seemed one could not be too nice to others. Hadn’t Grandpa Anderson already declared that the ownership of this base belonged to both families? In just half a year, they had already disregarded her to such an extent?

Ivy's hand had already slipped into her pocket; as soon as they made a move, she would pull out her phone to call for help.

To outsiders, she stood with her hands in her pockets, her expression calm, appearing as if she were ready to be taken captive.

Captain Daniels thought he had intimidated the young woman and ordered his men to step forward, intending to escort Ivy away.

At that moment, Tom and Jake happened to pass by the office building, planning to meet at the training ground for some sparring. Seeing the closed door of the office building, Jake slowed down, puzzled.

Tom, initially joking, sensed something was off and turned to look, only to see their young lady surrounded.

The two hurriedly dashed up the steps of the office building, kicking the door open with a synchronized force.

Ivy had her phone resting in her palm. At the sound of the loud crash, she looked up to see two large figures burst through the door.

Seeing familiar faces approach, a surge of bittersweet emotions washed over Ivy, and tears naturally welled up in her eyes.

Even Jake, who had witnessed countless expressions from her, was momentarily taken aback, feeling a pang in his heart.

Though he didn’t know the specifics of the situation, seeing so many people surrounding an unarmed woman, regardless of the reason, was infuriating and heartbreaking.

Tom stepped up beside Ivy to inquire about the situation, while Jake instinctively moved to the other side, sandwiched between two towering men. Feeling a wave of security, Ivy pushed down her feelings of grievance and explained what had transpired last night and just moments ago.

Tom's anger flared as he listened. He drew his phone, ready to call for help, waiting for Ivy's signal.

Jake also had his hand resting on the hilt of his belt, ready for action.

The people surrounding them were not to be underestimated either, each wielding some sort of makeshift weapon.

Ivy's gaze became even colder.

“What are you doing?”

A furious shout rang out—it was Uncle Anderson, followed closely by Mike. He had noticed the commotion and rushed to inform Uncle Anderson.

Ten minutes later, Robert and Will, along with the two trucks of stolen supplies, appeared in Uncle Anderson’s office.

Seated in the main seat, Grandpa Anderson’s expression was grim, his hands gripping his cane tightly.

The two men knelt before the old man, crying uncontrollably.

Initially, when they were taken away, they had been arrogant and defiant, thinking Ivy was just an orphan. Since the supplies had entered their Anderson family compound, they believed it was rightfully theirs.

Little did they expect that facing Grandpa Anderson would terrify them into confessing everything.

This wasn’t the first time they had stolen, nor would it be the last. The reason was simple—they had no skills to speak of and could only do maintenance work on the outskirts or occasionally help out in the fields. As they grew older and their health declined, they couldn’t even join the patrol team.

However, their pride made them feel like they were underutilized. Without extra resources to leverage for better positions, they couldn’t climb the ranks. They envied their cousin from the third house, thinking that if they had his connections, they might even contend for the position of security captain.

Somewhere along the line, they caught wind of a rumor that there were plenty of supplies in the northwest corner warehouse, a place with no patrols or surveillance cameras—only an old man occasionally going in to take things.

That sparked their greed.

The two secretly replicated the warehouse key and made off with supplies four times, not counting yesterday’s theft.

The old steward stood behind Ivy, fuming with rage.

The Anderson family's supplies were no small matter. Ivy had always kept her supplies separate from theirs. Though the compound was jointly funded for construction, she had borne the brunt of personnel expenses from her own stock.

Even Mrs. Smith and the others, including the young miss, worked hard, with the young miss risking her life to save others on missions.

Yet, they never thought of taking advantage of the Anderson family. Now, they were being bullied, and worse still, they were being wrongfully accused and even plotted against.

Who wouldn’t call them ungrateful and ambitious? Grandpa Anderson was aware that without the predictions from Ivy’s family, they might not have survived to this day.

This disgraceful act by those few ruffians reignited Grandpa Anderson’s old ailments. Chaos ensued as people rushed to fetch medicine and water, and after a considerable amount of time, he finally stabilized.

Ivy’s initial fury had dissipated significantly. Once she suppressed her negative emotions, she awaited Grandpa Anderson’s judgment.

Leaning back on the sofa, Grandpa Anderson closed his eyes and weakly declared, “From today, Robert and Will are not allowed to leave their room, their rations will be halved, Captain Daniels is dismissed, and all Anderson family members involved will be punished according to family rules.”

Once the other Anderson family members took these disgraceful individuals away, Ivy also instructed the old steward and the others to leave.

She couldn’t quite say whether she felt disappointed or not. She understood Grandpa Anderson’s approach; after all, he couldn’t just execute them in front of the Anderson family. Ivy knew she couldn’t bring herself to do that either. However, the punishment felt too lenient—at the very least, they should be expelled from the compound to fend for themselves.

Suppressing her emotions, Ivy chose not to speak, and silence gradually spread throughout the room.

At that moment, Uncle Anderson returned after making arrangements, assessing the atmosphere in the room before carefully speaking up.

“Ivy, there’s new progress in the laboratory research; we’ve developed an antidote for the virus.”

That one sentence made Ivy’s head snap up, staring at Uncle Anderson in disbelief.

“The situation is as follows: the current antidote for the virus does not revert those who have already turned into the infected back to humans in the traditional sense. Instead, it acts on humans bitten by the infected within ten hours, effectively blocking the virus and preventing mutation. However, after ten hours, the antidote becomes ineffective.”

Seeing the sparkle in Ivy’s eyes, Uncle Anderson continued, “The known activation period for the virus is 24 hours. Essentially, after 24 hours, the transformation will occur. We still need to wait for clinical trials, but based on extensive calculations, the antidote can effectively inhibit transformation within the ten-hour protection window.”

Ivy was overwhelmed by the good news, her mind spinning. If clinical trials went well, humanity would be saved—at least, there was hope within those ten hours.

With the virus antidote out, how far could the virus suppression agent and the enhancer for abilities be behind?

Living, after all, brought hope.
