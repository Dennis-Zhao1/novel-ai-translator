**The Great Misunderstanding**

As soon as the words left their mouths, the seeds inside the hideous flower erupted, splattering everywhere with astonishing speed.

Adam Swift reacted swiftly, stepping forward to halt all the seeds mid-air. Seeing this, Ryan burst into laughter. "Adam really knows how to handle things!"

He patted Adam on the shoulder, but both Serena Greene and Leo Sterling, along with Adam himself, turned pale. Oh no!

"Quick, fall back!" Adam urged, using his wind-based ability to pull the others back with urgency. Serena Greene grabbed the dazed Ryan, and as they realized there was no way to escape, she contemplated pulling everyone into her hidden sanctuary. Exposing her powers was a risk she couldn't take—lives were at stake.

Just as she was about to make the leap into her space, a translucent protective shield, gleaming with a silver-gray metallic sheen, appeared overhead. Many around them squeezed their eyes shut in fear, while Emily burrowed into Tom's embrace, trembling.

Serena looked up to see Leo, standing beside her, single-handedly supporting the shield, instinctively shielding her with his own body. This scene felt all too familiar; every time they faced a crisis together, Leo always took on this role, always made this gesture.

How could she describe the rush of feelings? There was sweetness, mixed with a tinge of bitterness—a complex surge of emotions that left her at a loss for words, unsure of how to express herself.

“I thought I was a goner! Adam, you really dropped the ball at a critical moment!” Ryan, relieved that the immediate danger had passed, nudged Adam playfully with his shoulder, completely oblivious to the gravity of the situation. If it weren’t for Leo, they would have been finished.

But Adam couldn’t say anything. The less people knew about the uniqueness of his powers, the better. In the heat of the moment, he had activated his wind ability, and with everyone in a panic, he hoped no one had noticed.

Serena rolled her eyes, and Leo sighed helplessly. This silly guy had no idea he was the one at fault, thinking it was all on Adam. It was truly a grave misunderstanding.

“Ryan, don’t touch me unless it’s necessary!” Adam was so frustrated he felt like he had eaten something bitter without being able to complain.

“Hey! What’s with the sudden hostility? You flip faster than a pancake!” Ryan laughed, completely unaware of Adam’s discomfort with physical contact.

“Alright, enough! You need to tone down that habit of getting all hands-on regardless of the situation,” Serena scolded, leaving Ryan looking confused and a little wronged.

Adam didn’t even want to spare him a glance. If it weren’t for Ryan, he wouldn’t be in such an embarrassing position.

“Okay, okay! No need to be so fierce! Hey, Leo, what’s that? It looks like some special material!” Ryan quickly changed the subject, reaching out to touch the protective shield. Leo’s expression remained neutral as he retracted the shield, revealing that it could shrink down to the size of a flashlight, entirely silver-gray, an advanced piece of technology.

Tom approached them, asking, “Leo, that protective device is some kind of advanced tech, right? Which lab made it? Is it expensive?”

The implication was clear: he wanted one too. Leo replied nonchalantly, “It’s from a lab overseas, but it’s probably not available for purchase. It’s just a prototype, something I can use occasionally.”

The boastful Ryan had been eagerly explaining the impressive features of the shield, only to be caught off guard by Leo’s casual remark about it being merely a prototype. His thoughts froze, leaving him speechless.

“Host, given that this shield saved your life, wouldn’t it be nice to praise it a bit?” the annoying voice piped in.

“Not a chance,” Adam thought, already focused on Serena, who was busily gathering the seeds scattered on the ground. It was clear that the shield had been summoned by Leo in the moment of crisis and had likely cost him quite a few points. Adam was well aware of the exorbitant prices in the system shop. He was already planning to collect the small crystal cores from outside later—every little bit counted.

After Leo casually dismissed Tom and Ryan, Serena had successfully gathered all the intact seeds around her and was gradually moving away from the group toward the location of the frozen hideous flower.

Leo looked back to see her diligently collecting the seeds, and he waved his hand, indicating he would catch up later. Instead of interfering with her, he began examining the frozen flower, sending a small bolt of lightning its way. The hideous flower shattered, leaving a pile of debris behind.

Ryan, too, asked Serena for a pair of gloves and squatted down to help pick up the seeds. There were simply too many for Serena to handle alone.

The others wanted to help but were halted by Leo. “These seeds are toxic; contact with skin will result in poisoning. Given the current situation, there’s no way to remedy it, so it’s best if you all keep your distance and stay quiet.”

Everyone followed his instructions obediently, watching as the two of them worked swiftly. Ryan was surprisingly precise with the gloves, collecting seeds efficiently until they had nearly cleared the area.

The damaged seeds weren’t left to just sit around; Leo used his fire ability to incinerate them, preventing any further growth of those hideous flowers. Just the thought of facing another swarm was enough to make anyone shudder.

At that moment, Leo gazed up at the black hole overhead, lost in thought. Serena handed him two jars filled to the brim with seeds. The others assumed she was merely showcasing her loot, but in the next instant, the jars vanished as they were absorbed into her spatial pocket, turning into points in Leo's account.

“Host, you’re awesome! The little fairy has been moved by your efforts and has sent you two jars! Is this a sign we might witness your love story and wedding in the future?” 

Despite the usual annoyance from the voice, this time, the words sounded endearing and comforting.

Serena also looked up at the black hole, wondering where it led and where the captain of the guard and his team had gone.

She wanted to ask Leo if he could exchange for equipment to scout ahead when she noticed he had produced a small disc-shaped device resembling a flying saucer. It was incredibly compact and stylish, about the size of a palm, with a striking cyberpunk design—perhaps a reflection of that annoying voice’s taste in aesthetics.

With a flick of his wrist, Leo sent the mini flying saucer into the air, where it began to hover, wobbling slightly as it approached the black hole. Inside the system, a large screen that he had previously questioned displayed real-time footage relayed by the saucer. The device flew at a measured pace, capturing the surrounding environment in vivid detail.

He couldn’t help but marvel; even if he had gone up there, it wouldn’t have been much different.

Serena watched him with anticipation, giving him space as the advanced technology of the system was impressive, but not being able to see the visuals felt like something was missing.

It was only then that Leo realized the flying saucer lacked an operational panel or any controls—how did it know what he wanted to see?

The annoying voice chimed in once more, “Host, all our devices are linked to your brain’s consciousness. Whatever you want to see, you just have to think about it, and it will follow your commands!”
