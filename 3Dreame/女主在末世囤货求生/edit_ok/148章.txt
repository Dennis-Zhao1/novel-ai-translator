**The Hatred of White Lotus**

Watching the frantic state of Daisy, Ivy felt a curious twinge in her heart. Could it be that the seemingly innocent Daisy was aware of her own actions?

“Why are you staring at me like that? I have no idea what you're talking about,” Ivy said, her tone dripping with sarcasm, completely unconcerned.

“You're lying. It was you!” Daisy repeated the accusation, her voice a mix of desperation and anger. It was hard to tell if she was putting on an act or genuinely on the brink of a breakdown, but Ivy wasn't going to let her off the hook so easily.

"Even if I did do something, what are you going to do about it? Do you think you can just walk out of here? This is my stronghold in the apocalypse. Who do you think can escape once I decide they should disappear?" 

Pretending to get up and leave, Daisy, despite her pain, trembled and said, “You were behind what happened at Maple Ridge Base, weren’t you?”

At those words, Ivy paused mid-motion, her gaze fixed on Daisy's determined face. Though her expression remained unchanged, she was genuinely curious about how Daisy had found out. They had been captured together, but Daisy had been taken away early on, apparently by some spoiled rich kids. Ivy couldn't recall encountering her again after that.

“Oh? What are you trying to say? Are you throwing dirt at me just because you're about to meet your end?” Ivy continued to watch her with a relaxed demeanor.

“It must be you! The supplies from Maple Ridge Base are all gone. So much valuable stuff, and only a space-type ability user could pull that off. You definitely stole it and dragged me down with you. Ah... why isn’t it you who’s suffering?”

Ivy couldn’t have imagined that Daisy had any ties to the supplies from Maple Ridge Base. But seeing her in such a state, clearly filled with hatred, was satisfying in its own way.

“Even if it was me, so what? Unfortunately for you, it won’t be me who pays the price. Isn’t that infuriating?”

Daisy was left speechless, tears streaming down her face. It was as if she remembered something tragic, perhaps mourning her own miserable fate.

“Look at you, crying. I thought you only knew how to thunder without rain. Tsk, you've practiced so much that you don’t even know what real tears feel like anymore,” Ivy taunted, her voice becoming more cutting, her attitude consistently high and mighty.

“Go ahead and laugh. Enjoy it while you can; let’s see how long your pride lasts.”

“The weak just put on a brave front. Given the chance to kill me, could you really do it?”

Daisy, who had almost given up on resisting, felt a flicker of courage ignite within her. She was genuinely unwilling to accept defeat. She had worked hard to enter Maple Ridge Base, managed to secure a powerful man—third in command, no less. If it hadn’t been for Ivy stealing the supplies, leading to her man’s downfall, she would have risen to a position of power and status long ago. Because of Ivy, she was now ruined.

“Shut up! I will definitely stop you!”

Struggling to sit up, the pain from the electric shock still lingered, but gradually, the numbness in her limbs faded, and she regained control of her body. With a surge of energy, she charged at Ivy once more.

“Ah…”

Just four or five steps away from Ivy, Daisy suddenly fell to her knees, her body collapsing. Ivy's ice spike had pierced through her calf, leaving a gaping wound. With just a simple wave of her hand, she could turn Daisy’s life into a living hell. Shock and despair filled Daisy’s eyes.

She had never seen Ivy fight before and had thought that even if female ability users were strong, they couldn’t compare to men. But now, Ivy was proving to be far more ruthless than any man she had encountered. Daisy realized she had forgotten one thing: if she had attacked first, she would have been even more merciless than Ivy.

It dawned on her just how reckless she had been to provoke an ability user. She had been certain that a man wouldn’t want to kill her, and that women lacked that capacity. Now, it was too late to regret.

Clutching her injured leg, Daisy was a mess of tears and snot, completely breaking down.

“Crying is the most annoying thing,” Ivy said, conjuring another ice spike to toy with in her hands. The sharp, hard ice glimmered with a cold light, causing Daisy to stifle her sobs, terrified of accidentally hurting herself.

Ivy crouched down in front of Daisy, trailing the sharp end of the ice spike across her face. This motion felt oddly familiar to Ivy, who thought to herself that it seemed like a reliable method of intimidation.

Daisy’s body stiffened; she wanted to retreat but feared for her appearance. In this apocalypse, her only asset was her relatively pretty face. If it was ruined, where would she find a way to survive?

“Miss Smith, I’m sorry! Please, have mercy! I haven’t done anything wrong!”

Shaking uncontrollably, tears welled up in her eyes once more, falling uncontrollably. She was genuinely scared now, her body in agony, and the pressure from the ice spike was overwhelming.

“If you had just cooperated from the start, we wouldn’t be in this situation. I told you that you would regret it. Those who listen will have good outcomes, don’t you think?”

The ice spike began to graze her throat, circling her collarbone. Daisy hurriedly pleaded, “I was wrong! I was wrong! Please let me go! I’m just an ordinary girl; I've never done anything that would harm anyone!”

Hearing this, Ethan couldn't help but roll his eyes. Wasn’t throwing her teammates under the bus considered bad? She had thrown people to the zombies and had ulterior motives when entering the stronghold, planting mutant seeds, and spreading seed powder.

“Liars never end up well.”

Ivy suddenly grew fierce, plunging an ice spike into Daisy’s thigh. The pain made her scream, and she instinctively tried to attack Ivy. But unfortunately for her, another electric shock from Ethan hit her, sending another wave of excruciating pain through her body. In that moment, she couldn’t even feel the pain in her leg as her entire body throbbed with agony.

Her scalp tingled, and it took a long time for Daisy to whimper and cry softly—this was true heart-wrenching sobbing.

“Thinking you can attack me? How naive. You better think carefully about what you’re going to say next, or you might not like what happens to you.”

Ivy was relishing her role as the villain, feeling an exhilarating thrill from the control she had over the situation. It was no wonder some people enjoyed inflicting pain on others; this sense of dominance was far more satisfying than any leadership position could provide.

“Waaah, I’ll talk! I’ll tell you everything! Just don’t hurt me anymore! It hurts so much; waaah!”

“If you’re afraid of pain, then you better start being honest, otherwise, more surprises await you.”

“No! Please, I’m not that person’s cousin! It’s just a false identity, an excuse! He set everything up! I was only tasked with completing a small mission; I never intended to kill anyone!”

“Who set it up? What mission?”

“Mr. Ford, the head of Maple Ridge Base, told me to replace Pei Smith, to make Pei Quinn fall in love with me, and to get all the other men at Maple Ridge Base to fall for me too.”

“Ford Bueller?”

“Yes! That’s him! He promised that if I succeeded, I could become the lady boss of Longlake Base!”

Ivy looked at Daisy as if she were an idiot. How could she be so gullible?

“You actually believed him? You’re just an ordinary person and can’t even compare to Pei Smith. Don’t you fear death?”

“Mr. Ford gave me defensive tools. I wasn’t scared.”

“What good things could he possibly give you? Those four seeds?”

“How did you know? Could it be…?”

Daisy was stunned into silence, realizing she had thought she was hiding her actions so well, but in reality, everything she did had been under observation. The realization left her pale.

“I had no choice! Mr. Ford threatened my friend and forced me to complete the mission to save her! I was only doing it to save someone!”

Ivy sneered. She knew all too well about Daisy’s ‘benevolent heart’, but selfishness was real too. It was easy to be charitable when someone else was making the sacrifice. She didn’t believe a single word of it.

“You could have told Pei Quinn the truth and asked for his help to save your friend, but you didn’t. So why did you come to the stronghold in the first place? What was your goal?”
