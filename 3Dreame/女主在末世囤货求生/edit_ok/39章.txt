**Title: Navigating Uncharted Deals**

Ivy Thompson instinctively felt that certain things were better left unsaid. But before she could voice this, the other party cut to the chase.

"As long as you ensure the safety of our Smith family starting today, the famous sword can belong to Miss Thompson. We can even throw in the others for free..."

Before Mr. Smith could finish, Ivy stood up, ready to leave. With the apocalypse looming, she wasn’t sure how long she’d survive, let alone guarantee the safety of an entire family. It was an impossible deal; life was too unpredictable.

The door, however, was locked, preventing her escape. Alex, her friend, was visibly furious. How could someone engage in such blatant coercion? For a few swords, they expected her to bear such responsibility? It was outrageous.

Yet Mr. Smith continued, “Of course, the Smith family will be at your service. We can offer everything we have, just to secure our family's safety, even if it's a slim chance of survival.”

Ivy understood. They believed in prophecies, convinced chaos was imminent, and that only the one who could wield the famous sword could protect their lineage. Logically, it made sense; if they believed in her, there might be a chance to survive.

Still, she pondered whether she truly needed the Smith family. She wasn’t a saint out to save every life. After seeing the exquisite craftsmanship of those swords, she felt a profound sadness over the potential loss of such legacy due to the world's end. But she never intended to shoulder the lives of an entire family.

Lives were heavy burdens, and as someone who believed in personal responsibility, she couldn’t easily agree. But then again, wasn’t this current situation a consequence of their ancestors' actions?

After some hesitation, Ivy asked, “How many people are in your Smith family?”

Mr. Smith’s eyes lit up with hope as he quickly replied, “Just me, my two sons and their wives, and my grandson Adam. Six of us.”

Ivy felt a wave of relief. Thank goodness! If it had been a large family like the Collinses, with branches and generations adding up to dozens, she would have been overwhelmed.

She nodded and instructed Mr. Smith and Alex to start packing. They should take everything essential and discard what they didn’t need. She would stay behind to discuss important matters with Mr. Smith.

The topics were critical—what sacrifices the Smith family had to make, their plans to relocate to New York, and what they would do in the future. At least, she thought, there would be professionals to handle sharpening the swords, so she wouldn’t have to labor over them herself. Ivy comforted herself, “It’s going to be tough, Ivy.”

Though the Smith family was small in numbers, their wealth was substantial. She didn’t covet it; instead, she felt admiration. Years of accumulation had made them prudent rather than wasteful, and their wealth rivaled that of a top-tier family in New York, something Ivy hadn’t anticipated.

She inquired about their properties and cash, advising them to quickly liquidate assets and stockpile supplies. Given the urgency, they couldn’t afford to shop internationally; Boston was prosperous, and resources were readily available there.

Once arrangements were set, Mr. Smith urgently called back his youngest son, Adam’s father. Two of his daughters-in-law were either working or living in the workshop with their husbands. He couldn’t explain everything over the phone, just that there was an emergency at home, and they needed to return quickly with all their asset documents and ID to gather at the old residence.

Ivy knew that this trip to acquire the swords wouldn’t conclude anytime soon. For now, she couldn’t return to New York; helping the Smith family stockpile supplies was the priority.

The Smith family had many connections in Boston, but this operation needed to be discreet. Ivy planned to use her company’s name to gather supplies, arranging for Adam to accompany her while the older generation began selling cars and houses to liquidate assets. They couldn’t sell the old residence, fearing it would attract too much attention, so they could only hope it would remain safe.

They decided which items were essential to keep and which could be discarded or sold. Over the next three days, Ivy was busier than ever. Even Alex was sent out to buy supplies.

At this point, even Alex, typically slow on the uptake, sensed something was off. After discreetly asking Ivy, he learned about the prophecy from their ancestors, which made him nod in understanding without further questions.

This revelation suggested that Ivy must have known about the prophecy beforehand, explaining her recent shopping spree to stockpile supplies. Feeling touched that she hadn’t hidden such significant news from him, Alex became even more motivated to help.

Meanwhile, at Ivy’s company headquarters in New York, her assistant hadn’t received any work assignments for several days, knowing that Ivy was traveling the world. Decisions usually made in meetings were discussed in person, and they couldn’t send emails any longer.

On this day, the assistant finally received Ivy’s latest work instructions. After reading it, she was stunned and quickly summoned the employees from the administrative and secretarial departments for a meeting. The email contained the following:

“The gemstone convention in Las Vegas was a great success. Ivy is traveling the world, and each employee will receive an extra month’s salary along with the settlement of half a year’s bonuses to celebrate. A two-week vacation starts now, so arrange your current tasks accordingly. The bonuses must be settled and distributed before the break begins, with the official holiday starting on the 18th. No personnel are to be scheduled during this time.”

All the employees erupted in cheers, praising their generous boss. Many took to social media, posting about their “godly boss” and “dream company,” all using similar keywords.

Ivy, amidst her busy schedule, also took time to consider her employees' futures. Unbeknownst to her, this operation was leaked online by her “foolish” relatives, and it became a trending topic. Suddenly, the internet was filled with envy for such a “godly boss” who possessed talent, looks, and luck, sharing their wealth while remembering their hardworking employees. Where could one find such a boss?

Netizens erupted in excitement, saying, “Working is impossible unless it’s for Ivy!”

“Is the boss hiring? I’d be willing to cling to her.”

Some even dug up videos of Ivy from before, wildly sharing and commenting, saying things like, “Ivy is beautiful and kind-hearted, rich and attractive, nearly perfect—except she’s not my boss.”

Various memes and jokes flooded the internet, causing Ivy’s company stock prices to soar, and money flowed back into the company’s accounts.

Well, she had to admit that this time, Ivy had truly won big.

Realizing she was trending again, Ivy felt helpless. She couldn’t let anyone find out she was in Boston; the current buzz made it easy for her to be targeted.

As for whether this would raise Ethan’s suspicions, she didn’t have the time to consider. He likely knew about the apocalypse, given his meticulous planning in their past life; there was no way to explain that without addressing the end times. For now, she had to put those thoughts aside.

Sighing, she silently put on a mask, disguised herself as a company employee, and began contacting various distributors to procure supplies.

The Smith family might not have much, but they had plenty of trucks and warehouses. Ivy intended to collect all the trucks before leaving. They wouldn’t fetch much if sold, but keeping them for future use would be beneficial.

The members of the Smith family dared not defy Mr. Smith’s orders. Besides purchasing essentials like rice, flour, and oil, Ivy also prioritized medical supplies. Since medical companies required contracts for bulk orders, she found it too much trouble and opted to negotiate directly with the sales staff to arrange private transactions.

Surprisingly, this approach proved efficient; her methods became more adept with each repetition. After finalizing all the purchases and sending the supplies to the Smith family’s warehouse, Ivy instructed them to quietly return to New York and stay at the old residence, where they would be among their own. The outside world still believed she was abroad, and the Smith family had no influence in New York. As long as they didn’t travel with her, they would remain inconspicuous.
