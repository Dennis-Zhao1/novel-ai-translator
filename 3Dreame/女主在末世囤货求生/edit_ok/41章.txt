**The Premature Apocalypse**

Everything was proceeding according to plan. The construction of the Apocalypse Fortress was in full swing, operating around the clock. It was nearly complete, with only the installation of barbed wire in the weaker perimeter areas remaining. Ivy had suggested digging a ten-foot-wide trench as an additional precaution.

In her previous experience, a similar base had used this method to fend off threats. However, given the mountainous terrain, it was impossible to bring in heavy equipment, so they had to shelve that idea for now.

The geographic location of the Apocalypse Fortress was excellent. It wouldn’t face large-scale threats, making it significantly safer than urban areas—by a considerable margin.

Families were notified that they could move in at any time. Ivy gathered the household staff and the Smith family for a meeting. The staff would follow her instructions, and the Smith family wouldn’t ask too many questions.

Ivy had already instructed the butler to organize the belongings in the old house and securely store them in the underground storage room. Each person was only allowed to bring a change of clothes, identification, and essential items, all fitting within a carry-on suitcase.

While everyone was busy packing in their respective rooms, Ivy turned and entered the storage room, placing the keepsakes from the old house into safekeeping. The house was too conspicuous for now, but she planned to find a way to take it with her eventually. It represented her last memories of her grandfather and parents, a place she held dear in her heart.

When the bus arranged by Mr. Anderson arrived to pick them up, the Smith family was already lined up to board. Ivy didn't join them, instead instructing the butler to take good care of Mr. Smith and the others, ensuring they settled in at the Apocalypse Fortress and waited for her to join them.

The butler nodded with concern, reminding Ethan to look after Ivy, before reluctantly boarding the bus.

Ivy disliked emotional farewells and silently watched as the bus drove away before taking Ethan in her car to leave.

Staying at the old house was not conducive to gathering outside information. With no need to return to the neighborhood, she headed directly to her company. There were only two days left before the holiday, and as the boss, it was reasonable for her to inspect the work.

This would also signal to the outside world that she had returned to the country and that everything was normal.

By the time she reached the company, it was close to lunchtime. Recently, everyone had been particularly motivated at work, eager to wrap up their tasks before the holiday. They were all focused and working swiftly, pushing projects forward and completing tasks.

Ivy had planned to treat everyone to lunch, but to her surprise, no one was available to chat. Even her assistant, usually by her side, was inundated with phone calls and meetings.

Today was the last half-day of work, and Ivy expected to see everyone racing to finish up and leisurely winding down.

Whether she felt relieved or disheartened, seeing the scene before her made her wish that they could relax a little more, take it easy; it would lighten her heart.

Thinking about the future left her feeling powerless. Even if she spoke up, how many would believe her? The few who would did so not because of her but because of her family's legacy.

Fortunately, around three in the afternoon, after the assistant reported the last task, his eyes sparkled with excitement as he congratulated Ivy. His words were sweetened like honey. Ivy chuckled and sent out a bunch of gift cards in the employee group chat. After a lively scramble for the cards, she waved her hand and announced an early dismissal.

As everyone left, they rushed to congratulate their boss and express their gratitude. Ivy could only tell them to hurry back and reunite with their families, and to avoid being out too much since the upcoming holiday was a time for loved ones.

Once the building was empty, Ivy, along with Ethan, found a hotel to check into. This move left those secretly monitoring her utterly puzzled, assuming she had simply gotten used to staying in hotels and had stopped returning home.

Mr. Anderson was still in the hospital, having been there so long that he was genuinely exhausted from the charade. That evening, Ivy boldly visited him, marking another entanglement with the Anderson family since the stock incident.

The outside world became even more confused. Fortunately, some key players had already become stakeholders in her company. They believed everyone was in the same boat, and their perceptions of the Anderson family shifted with their roles and attitudes.

It was only natural for a young person to return home to visit their elders after being away for so long, especially since Mr. Anderson hadn’t collapsed because of her.

In secret, Ivy had prepared an armored vehicle and discreetly handed it over to Ethan, instructing him to hide it until she called for it.

Ivy appeared to be staying at the hospital, not leaving until late into the night. Meanwhile, the Anderson family was already falling apart, and the information leaking out was ludicrous. Even the shrewdest among them couldn’t grasp the deeper implications.

But this was precisely what Ivy and Mr. Anderson wanted.

They didn’t want to hide in the Apocalypse Fortress early; they needed people to believe they were being forced into it, not that they had been planning for a long time.

To create a smokescreen for the fortress, significant money was spent on advertising for the Apocalypse Paradise, attracting genuine interest from potential investors.

Mr. Anderson worried that excessive attention might cause unnecessary trouble, so he painstakingly turned it into a project that would fool people into investing, ultimately costing Ivy billions in shares. This quelled the public’s curiosity, but it also damaged Mr. Anderson’s reputation.

Thus, many images of poorly managed projects circulated online, orchestrated by Mr. Anderson's people.

Some business experts even used the Apocalypse Paradise as a cautionary tale for novice investors, warning them to be wary of being deceived.

The rumors of fake projects and unfinished work were also spread by Mr. Anderson himself. They hadn’t even obtained proper operating permits; the whole thing was a façade. The initial purchase had only been in two names, entirely unrelated to actual operations.

Ivy thought she would endure the most challenging and conflict-ridden two days in the hospital. She was visiting Mr. Anderson's room, alongside Mr. Anderson, as they discussed the precise moment to enter the bunker when they suddenly heard a commotion outside. Moments later, it went silent again.

Two security guards were stationed at the door, and the disturbance lasted only a moment. The security soon knocked and reported that everything was normal.

However, Ivy felt an ominous premonition wash over her. Immediately, she stretched out her mental energy to sense what was happening. Just as she did, the sound of a scuffle erupted outside.

Ivy and Mr. Anderson exchanged wary glances, signaling for silence as she stealthily moved toward the door. Spreading her mental energy again, she did not need to look. Outside, one security guard lay on the ground, while the other was frantically fleeing, covered in blood. The fallen guard was being viciously attacked by a man in a hospital gown.

As the sounds of screams echoed from outside, Ivy realized that the man in the hospital gown had already turned into a zombie and was now pursuing the sounds away from the door. She then whispered to the two men, “There are zombies outside. The apocalypse has come early.”
