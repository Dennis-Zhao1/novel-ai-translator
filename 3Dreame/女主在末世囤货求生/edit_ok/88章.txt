**Mastering the Situation**

Linda Benson spoke directly, her tone serious yet calm. "Mr. Jackson, I've mentioned it before: a problem like this is dangerous not just because of the harm it causes, but because it spreads. It's time to make the right decision."

She handed the gun to Mr. Jackson, but before he could take it, a seemingly unhinged man lunged at them, snatching the weapon away. He turned it on the bound figures on the ground, firing wildly, especially at Jack Williams, rendering him lifeless. Several bullets struck his head, and he collapsed instantly.

Everyone present was taken aback, realizing it was Mr. Jackson's younger brother. After emptying the magazine, he continued to pull the trigger, his eyes bloodshot as he yelled, "Why? Why? Why?"

A few brave cousins rushed to restrain him, but he threw the gun aside and fell to his knees, sobbing uncontrollably. He couldn’t comprehend why, as members of the Jackson family, they were turning on each other, why his only child had to die at their hands.

He felt an overwhelming resentment, questioning why he had been dragged into such chaos, leaving only his child as the casualty. Revenge was all he had left.

In his frenzied shooting spree, Mr. Jackson had killed a few, while the rest lay groaning on the ground, begging for mercy. The family members from the main branch began rounding up all the collateral relatives who had been hiding, including those they once called sisters-in-law, nephews, and nieces.

There were over twenty people, and upon seeing their husbands, sons, and fathers bound and bloodied, they couldn’t help but shout and curse as they rushed forward. But a warning shot from Mr. Jackson silenced them, leaving them frozen in fear.

At that moment, Mr. Jackson’s expression was icy, his face like stone. He regretted being so compliant with family traditions that emphasized prosperity and love within the clan. In this chaotic world, anyone could betray anyone else. He had been lost in fantasies of loyalty and adherence to the family code.

Soon, Alan brought over another family member, looking at his sister, covered in injuries with tear-streaked cheeks, and at his older brother, collapsed in her arms, and rushed forward, using his healing abilities to stop the bleeding and mend wounds.

Linda Benson organized people to tie up the collateral relatives as well; a family must be whole and united. The main branch looked down at those on the ground, crying and pleading, their hearts tangled in confusion and despair as if they hadn’t yet grasped the enormity of the situation. Mr. Jackson didn’t let them go, standing before them, coldly declaring, “Today, the collateral relatives of the Jackson family revolted. They first kidnapped the old master, forced me to hand over control of the estate, falsely accused me of hiding the resources and key documents, killed the youngest, and injured my eldest nephew and many of us. They are no longer Jackson family members and do not deserve to use the family’s laws. Traitors deserve only justice.”

With that, he picked up the gun from Linda Benson’s feet, ready to shoot.

At that moment, a collateral relative with information, scared out of his wits, shouted incoherently, “Mr. Jackson! I report! I report that the third branch colluded with people from the neighboring base! They’ve planned to act tonight! Mr. Jackson, I’ll tell you everything I know; spare me! Don’t kill me!”

Linda Benson, hearing this, pressed down on Mr. Jackson’s gun and turned to look at the collateral relative, who was sobbing and pleading.

“Frank, I—I also report! Jack Collins has colluded with outsiders! I saw him send messages to them, planning to sell the research results for weapons! I don’t want to be part of this! I was forced into it, Frank, please spare our family!”

The one speaking was an uncle from the fourth branch, who had always been close to the brothers from the third branch and was adept at flattering the main family.

Mr. Jackson’s gaze grew even colder. He holstered the gun and shouted, “Is there anyone else willing to report or confess? Confess, and you’ll have a chance for leniency. Otherwise, you all face justice!”

The relatives immediately began shouting over one another, some even blaming each other. The relatives who had participated in the rebellion joined in the fray, and if they hadn’t been tied up, they might have started fighting each other.

Mr. Jackson felt a deep sense of desolation. This was the family the old master had always wanted to protect—how absurd, how tragic, how lamentable.

Seeing Mr. Jackson somewhat dazed from the continuous blows, Linda Benson arranged for Mike, Jason, and team members to separate and detain these people for questioning.

Mr. Jackson’s younger brother was still clutching his son’s lifeless body, crying uncontrollably. Unable to move him, he let him be for now. Jack had already been moved to the infirmary in the office building, and Linda Benson planned to go for interrogation as well. Just then, the devastating news arrived.

Old Master Jackson had passed away.

The Jackson family members were thrown into chaos, rushing towards the old master’s room in a frenzy. Linda Benson paused for a moment, sighed deeply, and followed silently.

It turned out that Old Master Jackson, already advanced in years, had been betrayed by the fifth branch for the first time, leading to a deep sadness that festered within him. He felt he had let Linda down but couldn’t bring himself to discuss it due to pride. On top of that, the winter weather had been unseasonably harsh, causing him to suffer from recurring ailments and remain bedridden.

Today, the sudden shock and anger, combined with a missed dose of medication, had taken a toll on him. When those watching over him were detained by the collateral rebels downstairs, he was not found until it was too late.

When Alan arrived, he was met with the sight of everyone kneeling, wailing. Mr. Jackson, overcome with grief, collapsed to the ground, unconscious. It was utter chaos as the long-absent Jackson family patriarch rushed in to handle the aftermath.

Linda Benson stood at a distance, gazing at Old Master Jackson's lifeless form, her heart heavy with sorrow. She took a deep breath, exhaling slowly, and instructed Alan to keep an eye on things here while she headed for the interrogation room.

The collateral traitors perfectly embodied the concept of bullying the weak and fearing the strong. Under the interrogation of Jason and Mike, they were as meek as lambs, but when it came to the other team members, they became cunning and devious, treating Linda Benson as if she were harmless.

Linda Benson smiled kindly, but then swiftly shot an ice spear through a kneecap, causing the clever ones to scream in agony. She locked two of the backstabbers together, letting them tear each other apart.

A nameless fury burned steadily within her, compelling Jason to ensure they pried every ounce of information from these traitors. Those who refused to cooperate would face justice and be displayed in the square.

She no longer needed to play nice with these people. After this incident, the initiative of the estate lay firmly in her hands.

The entire estate was shaken by Linda Benson’s decisive and firm methods, yet deep down, they felt it was deserved. The collateral relatives who could commit such heinous acts deserved this fate; the more tragic, the more satisfying it was to the onlookers.

Mr. Jackson was hit hard, his son’s body already taken away for burial. He remained in the square, kicking at the ground, and no one stopped him, tacitly approving of his actions.

The collateral traitors in the interrogation room, witnessing this scene, were so frightened they even began spilling secrets about when they had peeped at girls bathing as children.

The interrogation wrapped up swiftly, and Linda Benson sifted through a stack of confessions, extracting the genuine information from the sea of nonsense, and handed it to Jason and Mike.

“There are three confirmed facts: 
1. Tonight, they will coordinate with the neighboring base, allowing their people to infiltrate and take full control of the estate. 
2. The laboratory has been sold off almost entirely; the data and results have mostly been offloaded, with the buyers being a gang organization—its leader remains unaware for now. 
3. Old Master Jackson’s illness was man-made; they poisoned his food, secretly harming him.”

Linda Benson finished in one breath, turning to Jason. “We need to prepare quickly. If the neighboring base acts swiftly, they should be arriving soon.”

Jason nodded. The head of the neighboring base was known for his treachery and using others as pawns to achieve his ends. Last time, he had incited the former base leader to attack the estate, resulting in a catastrophic defeat that cost them most of their resources and manpower. The surviving captives were used as bargaining chips for resources, eventually leading to his suspension for review.

The neighboring base had given him substantial backing, whether through power exchanges or other interests, securing the support of half the military’s upper echelon, allowing him to rise at the former leader's expense.

The subsequent rebellion and infiltration were likely orchestrated by the base leader, indicating he had grand designs on the estate.

Time was of the essence. As Linda Benson pondered whether to stage an empty-city ruse or stand firm against the assault, Jason proposed a brilliant idea, igniting excitement in Linda Benson, who nodded vigorously in agreement.
