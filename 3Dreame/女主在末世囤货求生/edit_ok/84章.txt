**Enhanced Abilities**

The team gathered the zombie corpses into a pile, and one of the fire-type ability users ignited them with a flick of flame. This not only cleared away the rotting remains but also concealed the damaged brains of the zombies. If they were going to hide something, they might as well go all the way.

With the task completed, Laura Burton returned to hand over her shift. As the head of the lookout post, she couldn’t be on duty around the clock. Her close friend, Zoe Daniels, took over for her. Ever since her powers awakened, Zoe had transformed completely from her former self.

In the past, Zoe had a laid-back attitude, lazy to the core. Now, with her family experiencing a shortage of capable ability users, she felt a responsibility to step up after her own awakening. She no longer hit the snooze button every morning and had cut her hair into a chic bob, giving her a sharper look. Alongside Laura and the others, she diligently practiced her abilities on the training grounds, outworking many others. Regardless of the type of powers one possessed, improvement came with consistent practice. She didn’t consider herself particularly gifted; she believed hard work could make up for a lack of innate talent.

After returning to the fortress, the group dispersed, and Laura headed straight to her dormitory. She quickly slipped into her space. Ever since her return from the Maple Forest villa, it had been in a constant state of upgrade, though it showed no obvious change.

She regretted not opening the mysterious box belonging to Mr. Carter to see what treasures lay within. The anticipation was unbearable; surely, they were artifacts from hundreds or even thousands of years ago. But then she thought it might be better not to have seen it, avoiding the heartache she felt when she lost several ancient jade pieces.

Once she exited her space, Laura went straight to find Ethan Grant; she had further questions she needed his help with. She knocked on his door, and upon seeing her again, Ethan’s expression was unreadable, but he let her in nonetheless.

Skipping formalities, Laura sat down and asked directly, “I want to know how to make the ice spikes hit different targets when I activate my skill.”

Ethan felt a bit helpless. Although they both shared secrets, this question was too obvious. He was not an ice-type ability user and didn’t understand the nature of ice powers, so he could only analyze it based on his own lightning abilities. They discussed the issue for quite some time and ultimately concluded that, while they were both mutated ability users, the essence of lightning and ice differed significantly. To achieve the effect she described, she would have to experiment more on her own or wait until her abilities upgraded.

Laura expressed her gratitude, feeling somewhat enlightened. What she feared most was the act of trying and persisting.

As she left Ethan’s room, she noticed several pairs of eyes lurking in the shadows, watching her intently. With a smirk of mockery, she acted oblivious. Ever since they had collectively decided to keep the matter of the crystal cores a secret, the following days saw the Daniels family members taking on zombie hunting, while Laura’s team handled the cleanup.

The elders from the Daniels family, particularly those from the collateral branches, felt a surge of pride seeing Laura and her group take on the hardest tasks. They quickly began feeling superior, thinking that even if Laura was powerful, she still had to respect them, and their arrogance began to show.

No one paid them any attention; everyone was eager for them to leave so they could start opening their mystery boxes! The amount they collected each day wasn’t substantial—at most, they would gather over twenty cores, while on lean days, it could be fewer than ten. However, they gradually accumulated a decent stash.

Laura wasn’t the type to hoard. Once she had nearly two hundred cores, she gathered all her team members together. Ethan brought his squad, the three members from the Johnson family, and Brother Mark—everyone convened in Laura's room.

Laura pulled out a bag full of crystal cores and began to distribute them in front of all the ability users. The properties of the crystal cores weren’t fixed; elemental cores were rare, with most being low-level, non-elemental cores.

Non-elemental cores could be absorbed without restrictions, replenishing some energy and mental power, but they wouldn’t help increase ability levels. Only by absorbing a certain amount of elemental cores could one raise their ability level.

She distributed the elemental cores to the corresponding ability users and evenly divided the remaining one hundred eighty non-elemental cores. No one objected to the distribution; after all, they had all contributed to hunting the zombies, and they were willing to accept Laura’s allocation.

Ethan seemed to recall something and asked, “Has anyone from the Daniels family found out about the crystal cores yet?”

Laura nodded. “I haven’t even mentioned it to my Uncle Dan or Zoe. The ambitions of the Daniels family’s collateral branches are evident; their greed for the fortress and our side is just becoming more overt. They’re currently keeping their distance, cautious of our strength, but until I know the attitude of the main branch, I don’t plan to inform them about the crystal cores. If they discover it on their own, that’s not my problem.”

The emergence of ability users would inevitably lead to a shift in the core power dynamics within the Daniels family. Given the previous events, Laura felt cold-hearted. What started as a cooperative relationship had become a mere alliance for mutual benefit. If the Daniels family couldn’t maintain fairness, she didn’t see the need to involve herself in their affairs and didn’t want to keep sacrificing her interests to maintain their relationship.

Her previous tolerance and contributions to the Daniels family were largely due to her gratitude for Elder Dan’s care. Even if there had been significant favors, she felt she had repaid them all. More importantly, her awakening had given her the ability to protect herself and her family.

Now, she wasn’t afraid of exposing her space. As far as she knew, the Kunshan base would soon find a space-type ability user, allowing her to undertake missions and gather supplies openly. What she obtained would also seem justified.

Everyone nodded in understanding, and the Johnson family members sighed inwardly, reminding themselves to avoid the mistakes the Daniels family had made.

After several days of cleanup, the zombies outside the fortress had been nearly eradicated, and the number of crystal cores collected was dwindling. Laura, eager to enhance her abilities, felt dissatisfied with the status quo and discussed plans with Ethan and Brother Mark about going out to hunt zombies and collect more cores.

Ethan seemed equally eager and quickly agreed. They chose a sunny day, and Laura, Brother Mark, the Johnson family trio, and Ethan’s team gathered together, setting off in two armored vehicles.

These vehicles had been specially modified before the apocalypse and were well-suited to deal with ability-enhanced zombies. In her past life, Laura had no abilities and had never participated in battles against mutated zombies. As she drove, she realized the danger of encountering a wood-type zombie that attacked them with entwining vines, causing her tires to get stuck. It was then that she understood how quickly zombies could enhance their abilities compared to humans.

Leading the group, Ethan’s lightning had already struck the wood-type zombie in the head. Laura followed up with an ice spike, causing the vines to wither and crumble as if doused in sulfuric acid, turning into a pile of dry twigs.

They drove to the vicinity of a residential area that Laura had never visited. Ethan seemed familiar with the area, leading the way confidently. After parking the vehicles, the team disembarked. Despite their abilities, they still carried weapons, adhering to the principle that while equipment could be optional, it should never be absent.

The number of zombies in this area was genuinely considerable, and everyone was on high alert. As they dealt with the common zombies, Laura furrowed her brow. Why was it that ordinary humans couldn’t evolve into ability users after the magnetic field changed, yet zombies could continue to evolve?

She raised her hand and shot through a rushing zombie’s head; it was of the earth type, utilizing soil walls as shields. Did this mean that the intelligence of the zombies was increasing as well? Over one hundred zombies wandered around the residential area, providing ample targets for them to practice their skills.

Ethan remained calm compared to the others, his demeanor suggesting that for mutated zombies, these were just the initial stages.
