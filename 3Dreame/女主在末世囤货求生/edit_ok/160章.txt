**Mini Crystal Core**

Ivy quickly used her intuition to assess her surroundings and felt a chill run down her spine. How could this be happening?

At the mountain's peak, a swarm of tiny, red-black dots gathered densely together. The sheer number was staggering, and their unsettling appearance was enough to trigger anyone's unease. They were much smaller than the usual zombie crystal cores, which were already not large to begin with. These dots were probably only a tenth of their size, yet their deep colors made them look even more menacing.

As the group of six descended the mountain, the urgency of their escape sharpened their senses. Ethan activated his wind-based ability, the sound of rushing air blending with their hurried footsteps and the crunch of leaves and branches beneath them. Yet, the persistent rustling sound behind them—a sound that sent shivers down their spines—could not be drowned out. Ivy urged Ethan to grab Kate.

Among them, Kate was the slowest runner. With a swift motion, Ethan lifted her onto his shoulder, sprinting away like the wind, leaving only the echo of Kate's panicked screams behind him.

As they ran, Ivy kept checking the situation behind them with her heightened senses. Those red-black dots were gaining speed.

"Ryan, get ready with your abilities!" Ivy suddenly stopped and called out to Ryan. They couldn't run any longer; their stamina was nearly depleted. Even Ethan's pace was slowing. Continuing to flee like this didn't guarantee their safe return, so it was better to take the initiative.

Jake also halted, panting heavily, already preparing his offensive capabilities.

Ryan took a couple of deep breaths and raised his hand. In an instant, the air around them seemed to freeze momentarily. The next second, an army of tiny red mutated plants burst forth from the ground, suspended in the air by Ryan's ability.

They resembled shriveled red berries, their tentacle-like appendages moving ominously, looking quite terrifying.

Without hesitation, Ivy unleashed an ice barrier, and the mutated plants were immediately impaled by countless ice needles. Kate joined in, launching ice darts continuously. However, hitting such small and dense targets with ice darts was clearly not the most efficient method—like using a cannon to swat flies, the noise was significant, but the damage was minimal.

Jake’s lightning strikes had a similar effect; while powerful, their area of effect seemed inadequate, making it feel like a waste.

Ivy sensed that this method was too exhausting for their abilities and stamina. She reached behind her to retrieve her air gun and fired off a rapid succession of shots. Ryan's ability released the tiny red berries, scattering them, the central ones reduced to mere debris that could be blown away by the wind.

Jake pulled out his air gun as well. The combined firepower from their two guns was truly devastating. In no time, the ground was littered with broken bits of red berries. A sweep of her senses revealed that the red-black dots were still flickering behind them. Rummaging through her supplies, Ivy produced a pair of tweezers and used a stick to sift through the remnants of the red berries, eventually uncovering a dark red to black crystal core, about the size of a fingernail, camouflaged within the debris.

Ethan approached curiously, asking, "What is this? It looks so much like a crystal core!"

"Do mutated plants also have crystal cores?"

"Hey, listen up! Good stuff, good stuff! Hurry, hurry, hurry!" 

The excited chatter from the communicator buzzed in Ivy’s ear. Jake understood that this little crystal core could provide energy to their systems, and it was no surprise the chatter was thrilled.

Ryan reached out to touch it, but Ivy quickly called out, "Don't touch it directly! It might be toxic!"

Jake added, "Right, what if it’s something that can poison your skin? We don’t have doctors or researchers to help us right now."

Ryan immediately withdrew his hand, mimicking Ivy's earlier actions by using a stick to probe around, hoping to help her find more crystal cores quickly.

Unbeknownst to him, Ivy was using her skills to collect them effortlessly. The chaos on the ground was beyond what the naked eye could detect. Those tiny cores, mixed within the remains of the mutated plants, were even harder to identify.

Seeing that he couldn't be of much help, Ryan stopped moving after flipping through the debris a few times. His abilities had nearly been drained, and thankfully he had managed to stabilize the situation; otherwise, he wouldn't be so relaxed now.

Kate and another teammate stood a distance away, their faces pale as they pulled out crystal cores to absorb energy.

Ethan had been assigned an important task: to use his wind abilities to help clear the areas Ivy had searched, so she wouldn’t have to sift through the debris while digging for crystal cores.

Everyone silently watched Ivy's series of actions. While it took others a painstaking effort to spot even a couple of cores, she was swift and precise, efficiently collecting them.

Holding a glass jar that was filling up quickly, the area Ethan cleared grew larger and larger.

Directing Ethan to stack the debris together, this time, there wasn’t a fire ability user among them, so Ivy took out some gasoline from her supplies and doused the pile before setting it ablaze.

Fortunately, they were in a clearing halfway up the mountain, so starting a fire wouldn’t trigger a forest blaze. After burning it down, they quickly extinguished the flames without any issues.

Ivy noticed that some remnants were still left on the outskirts, so she took out another bottle and collected a larger piece as a sample.

Once they wrapped up their busy work, the others had also managed to rest. Ivy handed the jar to Jake and strode to the front of the group.

Kate was still chattering with Ethan and Ryan about what those red berries were. Without a word, Ivy changed direction and headed east. With so many signal flares set off earlier, she intended to visit the points in order.

The first sighting was a team vehicle parked at the foot of the mountain in the southeast direction. Following the previous footprints, they hiked for a while before discovering a person lying on the roadside, teetering between life and death.

The teammates helped the person up; he was a member of the escort team, and Ivy noticed he bore a striking resemblance to Jake when he was poisoned.

"Be careful, you two! Don’t touch his wounds; he’s likely poisoned," Ivy warned, frowning. She retrieved a bottle of water from her supplies and handed it to Ethan, urging him to get it in the injured man's mouth quickly.

Ethan took the water bottle and gently pried open the injured man’s mouth, preparing to pour it down his throat.

Kate rushed over to grab the bottle, looking exasperatedly at Ethan. "You’re going to choke him with that force! Let me do it!"

At that moment, Ivy was still focused on the jar containing the samples. The appearance of the red berries was truly unappealing, and examining it closely made it even harder to accept.

"Have you figured anything out?" 

Jake asked quietly, standing beside her.

"Not yet. But there are a lot of them, and they seem quite aggressive, probably similar to that flower from last night that spat out seeds."

Hearing her description, Jake couldn't help but chuckle, glancing down at the person on the ground before suddenly asking, "Was I like that too?"

Ivy shot him a glance before quickly averting her eyes, nodding in response to Jake.

Feeling a gentle pat on her head, she was taken aback. "Thanks for your concern, it’s very thoughtful of you."

Suddenly feeling an unprecedented level of politeness, which used to seem courteous now felt oddly uncomfortable.

"Are you awake? What number is this?" 

Ethan immediately inquired. The injured man clutched the water bottle and gulped down several large swigs before, pale-faced, he began recounting the events that had transpired.
