**The White Lotus Enters the Scene**

Ivy Daniels kept her cool as she observed the swirling emotions around her, sipping her coffee with a hint of frustration simmering beneath her calm exterior. Seriously, what is this, the 1800s? Why are we still caught up in these outdated traditions? Times have changed, folks!

Ethan Carter sure knows how to charm the ladies. Could it be there's more to him than meets the eye? No way, not another entanglement... Ethan, watch your back!

Her eyes flitted between Jake Anderson, Ethan Carter, and Ethan's brother, Scott. Jake seemed to read her mind and hid his smirk behind another sip of coffee.

The dinner party wrapped up in no time, and everyone headed back to their rooms. Little did they know, a dramatic scene was about to unfold elsewhere.

“Hey, big bro, is what you said true?” 

Lily White, known for her innocent demeanor, was stopped by an unsuspecting young man on her way to her dorm. They ducked into a quiet storage room, and Lily gasped, covering her mouth in surprise.

It had only been a few hours, and this naive guy was already letting slip a major secret. Too bad for him, she already knew, but she had to keep up appearances to maintain her innocent facade.

“It’s true, Ryan. If I awaken my powers, will you consider being my girlfriend? I know I don't have much to offer right now, but I hope you’ll give me a chance.”

Inside, Lily felt a wave of impatience. At least he had some self-awareness, but not enough. She smiled gently, appearing touched as she replied, “Ryan, I see your sincerity and determination. But please, don’t say it’s for me; it puts too much pressure on me. I hope you focus on getting better. You’re brave, honest, and kind—a good person deserves good things. Promise me, don’t belittle yourself, okay? It makes me feel bad too.”

Flattered by her praise, Ryan couldn't help but grin widely, nodding enthusiastically, unaware that Lily had agreed to nothing. He continued, lost in his own thoughts, “Don’t worry, Lily! I will become a powerful ability user and confess to you properly!”

After saying that, he waved cheerfully at her, marching off in a quirky manner.

The moment he turned away, Lily couldn't help but change her expression, muttering under her breath, “He doesn’t even take a good look at himself. A powerful ability user? As if he could match Jake or Ethan. Dream on! What a broke dreamer trying to court swans.”

Cursing and venting her frustrations eased her discomfort. After a while, she emerged from the storage room, once again the calm and composed Lily White.

Surprisingly, she had her fair share of admirers. At Liberty Base, the ratio of women to men was already low, and aside from a few family members, the rest were single men. Among the unmarried beauties, Anna stood out, but her icy demeanor intimidated most.

Then there was Ivy Daniels, soft and gentle, with no powers. She spoke sweetly, looking pure and beautiful with her baby face that hadn’t lost its charm.

Thanks to the strict rules at Liberty Base, Ivy had the backing of her cousin, making everyone treat her with respect and courtesy.

But that was precisely what bothered Ivy. Despite her flirting, there were hardly any powerful figures willing to act on her behalf. That naive boy was the only one who had openly declared his feelings, which was a blow to her ego.

She had already secured her spot at the survival fortress. Jake Anderson was even more perfect for her standards in men. With that in mind, it was better not to be too entangled at Liberty Base; otherwise, her carefully crafted persona might just collapse.

Remembering her mission, she squeezed her wrist, letting her confidence fade for a moment as she walked down the dim hallway. Upon reaching her dorm door, she put on her smile again, knocking lightly before stepping into the shared room, her resolve becoming stronger. She had to win over Jake Anderson and secure her place in the survival fortress, wanting nothing more than to escape sharing a dorm with anyone else.

Having only spent a day and a night at Liberty Base, Jake Anderson and his team were set to leave the next day. He had other arrangements, and before departing, Lily made sure to send him off, pretending her beloved was going away, leaving her behind in loneliness.

Ivy Daniels couldn’t be bothered to watch this clichéd drama unfold. She left first and sat in the vehicle. Jake offered Lily a half-hearted smile, which was enough to make her blush and act all flustered again.

The vice-captain and the others pretended not to see, looking up at the sky, giving Lily the perfect opportunity to finish her little performance before they made their escape.

Meanwhile, Lily called after him, “Jake, I’ll be waiting for you to pick me up in five days. Don’t forget about me!”

Unbeknownst to her, a man standing in the crowd, veins bulging in his eyes and fists clenched tightly, was staring daggers at Lily and Jake’s retreating figures.

**Inside the Survival Fortress**

“Miss Laura, when can I get the awakening serum?” 

Fred Patterson, eager and impatient, followed Laura Grant around. After a few days of thorough physical exams, he thought he would get the serum immediately and become a powerful ability user. However, days passed, and aside from learning that his father had no response, nothing else came of it.

Anxiety bubbled within him, but looking at Laura, she didn’t seem like someone who would go back on her word. After all, she had treated him so well these past few days; the food was even better than what he had at the City Base.

He couldn’t quite understand why anyone would want to betray or leave the survival fortress when there was such a fantastic cafeteria—wasn’t that enough?

Of course, he wasn’t a glutton, but even he had been won over.

“Why the rush? It’s just a matter of time. Why not relax and wait?” 

While walking, Laura handled daily reports from Lucy Hill. After finishing, she stopped to tell Lucy, “Compile a list of those who passed the physical exam. Let’s set thirty slots aside, prioritizing the guard team and young adults.”

Lucy understood her intentions and set off to arrange it.

Seeing her about to leave, Fred called out, “Don’t forget me! Make sure I’m on the list!”

In truth, Laura couldn’t stand his antics. Ever since he entered the fortress, he’d been putting on a show, and she found it painful to watch. Rubbing her temples, she instructed him to take it easy and not wander around while she headed to the lab.

In the lab, they had produced over fifty awakening serums using the previous materials, all sealed in the storage room. Laura was there not only to discuss post-injection monitoring with Dr. Zack but also to delve into research on enhanced ability users and Mike’s case.

She had always believed Mike had undergone enhancement, but why didn’t he exhibit any signs of zombification? This puzzled her greatly.

Upon seeing the batch of enhanced ability users, she finally understood why Mike felt so out of place—not just because of his powers, but also due to his unique condition.
