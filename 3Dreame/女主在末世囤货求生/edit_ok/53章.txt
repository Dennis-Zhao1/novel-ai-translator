**Listening to Music While Battling Zombies**

"I can't keep my distance, not with these folks around. Either they've got bad judgment or just terrible luck. What if they get infected?" 

As everyone regained their strength, the clock ticked closer to 7:10 PM. It was already dark outside, and they couldn't afford to waste any more time. 

Ivy and Mike flanked the office doors, swinging them open. Following their path from east to west, they charged forward with an unstoppable force, ready to tackle any obstacle in their way. 

Ivy’s swordplay became faster and more precise, catching the attention of Captain Smith, who couldn't help but admire her skills. "This girl may have a fiery spirit, but she's truly powerful." 

The contrast was stark; among the women survivors, the three who could only whimper and cry were more of a hindrance to him. 

The underground lab was crawling with infected staff. They had already dispatched a hundred or so, yet there was still no sign of Uncle Joe and his family. 

At least there were no familiar faces among the zombies—a lack of news was good news, right? 

They switched up the lead several times, with Captain Smith taking the front for a couple of rounds, finally clearing out the first section. 

Some equipment in the lab still had power; it seemed there was an emergency backup, like the several colorful cabinets filled with various vials and glassware. 

The room's keypad was lit up, and thankfully, there were no living or undead beings inside. They moved on to the next office. 

The layout here was complex; even though they were heading west, the numerous partitions meant they often had to turn corners. If not for the compass feature on Ivy's smartwatch, they might have gotten lost entirely. 

Just one section had claimed over a hundred lives. Ivy pondered how many more unknown dangers lay ahead. 

"Why not let them come to us instead?" After a brief discussion with Mike, they decided to lure the zombies over. 

This would also give them a chance to rest. Captain Smith and the others didn’t oppose—who would bother arguing when they were all exhausted? 

Meanwhile, Captain Smith's team cast envious glances at the swords Ivy and Mike wielded. They were stuck with mere daggers, which required them to be dangerously close to the zombies to strike. The sight of Ivy’s powerful slashes was quite the spectacle. 

Earlier, Captain Smith hadn’t felt much when he used his knife, but now he regretted not bringing a longer weapon. One clever teammate had even swiped a fire axe, patting himself on the back for his ingenuity. 

"This mission is exhausting," Ivy thought, feeling like giving up. But Mike had found something to attract the zombies—a Bluetooth speaker in a neighboring office. 

He switched it on, pulling out his phone. The speaker came to life with a cheerful voice announcing, "Bluetooth activated, awaiting connection... Connection successful." 

With a flick of his wrist, the music started blaring: “Hey Ah Ah, you’re my baby, the taste of longing, lurking...” 

The DJ's voice was loud, and the rhythm was infectious. 

Ivy was surprised by the song choice—seemed Mike was quite the veteran of certain social media platforms. 

Within thirty seconds, the shuffling and groans of zombies echoed from afar. Ivy positioned herself, eager for the first one to arrive. 

In the dimly lit underground lab, a group of survivors rhythmically slashed at the zombies, every move synced perfectly to the beat. 

It was a bizarre yet exhilarating sight—the fierce contrast between their brutal actions and the lively music spurred them on, energizing their spirits. 

After what felt like an eternity, Ivy completely lost track of how many times the song had looped. She was nearly sick of it, yet there were no new zombies to deal with. 

Looking at the pile of corpses, they had all shifted positions multiple times. 

Captain Smith and his team were also putting in the effort; there were moments when the sparks from his blade practically flew. Mike was indeed fierce, but Captain Smith was on another level. 

They fought hard for nearly an hour, taking two breaks, finally clearing out all the zombies on the second basement level. 

The fourteen of them gathered together, moving towards a common goal. 

Mike kept the Bluetooth speaker playing, switching to another popular track at Ivy’s request—it was just as loud and lively. 

The eerie atmosphere of the dark lab was oddly contrasted by the upbeat song, making it feel surreal. 

Though they all tried to hide their reactions, their feet still moved to the rhythm; it was hard to believe that no one was silently singing along in their heads. 

They had thoroughly checked every office on the second basement level, and Ivy was left feeling helpless. Where could Uncle Joe’s family be hiding? 

If they were this good at hiding, she thought, it was time to call out. 

“Is anyone there? Joe Yidan, where are you?” 

With no zombies around, she could call out freely. She even urged the others to join in, their reasoning sound: “Aren’t you worried about your own sisters?” 

Eventually, it was Captain Smith’s team that found a sealed laboratory. It was secured with a heavy password door, and he pointed at it, saying, "If they’re still alive, they’re probably in there." 

Ivy didn’t quite understand why they were so eager to help them complete this task. Perhaps they just wanted to get out of here sooner. 

Not dwelling on it, she approached Mike to discuss the password door. “Can they really not hear us knocking?” 

Ivy looked up to see Captain Smith observing her childlike curiosity, suppressing a smile as he nodded. "These doors are thick and sealed. Inside is a sterile environment, and there’s a buffer zone to isolate any pathogens. 

There might be three or four more doors beyond this one; if they’re hiding, they likely went deeper for safety." 

Ivy nodded in understanding—it made sense. "But what if the people outside want to find them?" 

Captain Smith paused, shining his flashlight on the wall for a moment before pointing to a communication switch next to the keypad. "Maybe the people outside press that button. They might have a speaker inside that can hear us?" 

Well, that was reasonable. 

Ivy leaned in to examine the intercom button, noting that the keypad had lost power. So, either the lock had malfunctioned or jammed; she wasn’t sure if they could open it manually. 

Frustrated, she felt like pulling out a tool to break it down. There were so many tools in the space; it was maddening not to be able to use them. 

Seeing her furrowed brow, Captain Smith added, "Or we can find another window to see the people inside." 

With no other options, everyone geared up with their lighting equipment and began searching the large lab for alternative methods. 

Ivy also hoped to sneak a tool from her bag when no one was watching. She wondered if her small saw could cut through that door. 

Before long, someone from Captain Smith’s group called out, "We found a way!" 

Ivy rushed over, not caring about her saw anymore. It turned out Captain Smith’s team had located a corner. 

Standing in front of a wall, they seemed to be assessing it. After listening closely for a moment, they concluded that this wall was part of the lab and relatively weak. With a hand grenade, they could blast it open and gain access. 

Ivy couldn’t help but feel envious—they had grenades, while she didn’t even dare use her saw. She cursed herself silently. 

Not once did she question why Captain Smith was so eager to take the initiative.
