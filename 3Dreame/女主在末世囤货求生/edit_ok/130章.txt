**The White Lotus’ Flirtation**

Ivy Daniels watched Ethan Grant seated on the couch, deep in thought. Around them, the others were engrossed in their own tasks—some were packing, others were organizing their gear. Nobody seemed to notice her.

After calling out to Ethan a few times without a response, Ivy felt a twinge of irritation. Deciding she needed a change of scenery, she thought it might be better to find Anna for a chat. The company of these distracted men was beginning to grate on her nerves.

Not long after Ivy stepped out, Lily appeared with a tray of coffee, heading toward the guest room. Since joining the group, she had been assigned to kitchen duties. She had managed to win over the kitchen manager by playing the sympathy card, and since her cousin had been a popular figure at the base, she received some preferential treatment. She often volunteered to help with tasks she could handle, and this time, she had taken over the coffee delivery from Sarah, who was usually in charge of hospitality.

Anyone could have performed such a task, but Lily had changed into a pink and white sundress and had styled her hair into soft curls that framed her face, giving her an air of innocent allure.

Gently knocking on the door, the deputy team leader answered. He was greeted by the sight of Lily standing there with a gentle smile, holding the coffee tray.

The deputy team leader and the others had spent years in law enforcement, and being the typical tough guys they were, they often felt protective of delicate women like her. This made it easy for Lily to serve the coffee to Ethan.

Meanwhile, Ethan remained on the couch, wrapped up in an internal debate about the points he'd earned, particularly interested in a high-tech gadget he was eyeing in the shop. This device, leveraging cutting-edge technology, was capable of impressive feats without the need for ammunition, making it an ideal tool for their current mission.

His intense concentration meant he was oblivious to the world around him. Lily greeted him softly and made small talk, but he didn’t hear a word. It wasn't until he managed to gain the upper hand in his mental negotiation that he finally noticed a sniffling sound and asked himself, "What's that noise?"

His inner voice chuckled, “Looks like you’ve got an admirer! Better not let the little fairy think you’re flirting with all the pretty faces!”

Before the thought could linger, Ethan shook it off, focusing back on the room.

“Deputy, what’s going on here?” he asked, his voice calm yet commanding as he glanced at his deputy.

“Ethan, Lily came to bring us coffee. I thought it would be impolite not to let her in, but I assure you, I didn't make her cry! It’s because you didn’t acknowledge her when she tried to speak to you,” the deputy explained, his voice trailing off under Ethan's steady gaze, reminiscent of their stringent days before everything changed. He was visibly unsettled.

Sensing the awkward atmosphere, Lily quickly wiped her tears, her voice quivering as she said, “Mr. Grant, please don’t blame the deputy. It was my mistake... hic...”

But Ethan wasn’t interested in prolonging the interaction. “As long as you understand it was a misunderstanding, Miss Lin, you can head back now. It’s not the best idea for a young woman to linger in a room full of men.”

Taken aback, Lily hesitated, but understood that patience was key. Being too forward could tarnish her image. She gracefully stood, thanked Ethan and the others with a polite nod, and exited with her empty tray.

As Lily left the room, her presence seemed to capture the attention of Peter and Charlie, who had invited Ethan to dinner. Charlie scoffed, “How amusing. Wherever there are men, she’s right there. Is delivering coffee even part of her duties? Does she think we’re oblivious?”

Peter frowned thoughtfully, pausing before taking Charlie’s hand to knock on the guest room door.

Inside, Ethan was wrapping up a stern reminder to the deputy and the others. In the world before, such behavior might have been excusable, but now, whether they had special abilities or not, being overly indulgent with women could be disastrous.

After his lecture, Ethan was ready to eat. Later, Peter pulled him aside for a private conversation. Ivy, seated too far away to eavesdrop, watched their expressions closely. Soon, she noticed Lily being called over, and the exaggerated expressions she made, particularly the smug looks she shot at Ethan, seemed to say, "See? I’ve got him under my spell. What a joke you are."

Ivy resolved to vent to her friends later about these gullible men falling for such antics.

At that moment, Charlie, seated nearby, noticed Ivy's displeased expression and turned to see what was bothering her. As he did, he stood up abruptly, drawing Peter’s attention. He quickly left Ethan and Lily to console Charlie.

Ivy clearly saw the disdain in Lily’s eyes and felt a wave of frustration. She clenched her fists in annoyance.

As she debated whether to stir the pot and provoke some rivalry, she realized the opportunity was slipping away. Regret washed over her as she missed her chance to perform. Although her acting skills weren't spectacular, she excelled in stirring the pot.

But it was too late. Lily seemed to skip away as if she had just received the best news, her youthful energy apparent.

Ivy thought this whole debacle had cured her low blood pressure. Watching Ethan return to his seat, she anticipated a sarcastic remark, but instead, she heard Peter’s calming voice beside her.

“Alright, alright, I’ll take her away. We can’t let her be an eyesore in front of you, okay?”

Charlie immediately stopped her antics and pointed at him, “Are you serious? No kidding?”

“Absolutely! I just spoke with Ethan, and we agreed that Lily will accompany him.”

Now it was Ivy’s turn to be shocked. What was this? Accompany him? To the survival fortress???

Were these people out of their minds? What kind of sensible person would suggest that?

But then she heard Peter continue, “Our base has many civilians who need to head to the survival fortress, so rest assured, it’s legitimate.”

Ivy finally understood the situation. So, they were giving such an important opportunity to Lily?

Ugh, men.

Her mental notes were already brimming with gossip to share with her friends, but knowing that “a small inconvenience can disrupt a grand plan," Ivy surprisingly held her tongue. Meanwhile, Peter used her as an example to show Charlie what a supportive partner should be like.
