### Complaining

Lily White was sobbing, seeking comfort, while Adam Stone felt the urge to quietly retreat from the scene. He hoped Serena Gray would take over, as Lily was becoming unbearable, her clinginess a nuisance without any sense of social awareness.

Scarlett Bain watched as Zoe Chase ran after Lily, trying hard not to laugh out loud. She waved for Mike Andrews to open the door. After venting her frustrations on Lily, Zoe finally let her go and climbed into the car as they entered the compound.

The two vehicles parked in the open space near the main gate. Scarlett stepped down from the watchtower, observing the newcomers as they got out of their cars, organizing themselves while maintaining appearances.

"Mr. Stone, I'm here representing the Lexington Base to discuss cooperation," Adam said solemnly, gesturing to the neatly lined-up team behind him, excluding Lily, who was being ignored.

"Mr. Stone, have you forgotten what you said before leaving the base? Aren't you worried about making a fool of yourself by coming back?" one of the newcomers scoffed, recalling Adam's earlier remarks.

Adam remained unfazed. "Times have changed. What I said back then still stands; it’s just a matter of perspective. Different situations lead to different views."

The newcomers reflected on Adam's previous words. From their current standpoint, they could indeed understand it. Everyone wanted to be in a position of advantage; selfishness was not a crime, and people like Scarlett, who were genuinely altruistic, were truly rare.

If Scarlett knew what they were thinking, she wouldn’t have expected her actions to be seen as selfless. In reality, she was merely looking to increase their chances of survival, wanting capable people to help combat dangers.

"Alright then, how does Mr. Stone propose we cooperate?" Scarlett said casually, appearing completely at ease.

Adam had his deputy retrieve a large bag of crystal cores from the trunk of the car. He handed it over, but Scarlett didn’t take it directly, instead signaling for Mike to inspect it.

Upon opening the bag, they found that most of the crystals were above the third tier, with quite a few fourth-tier ones as well. It was evident that Adam had put thought into this offer, and after estimating the quantity, Scarlett understood the implications.

"What do you want in exchange for these crystal cores?" she asked.

"Are these awakened abilities not enough?" Adam replied.

"Hardly. This is merely a deposit; it wouldn’t even cover half," she said, brushing her bangs away from her eyes. To her surprise, as soon as she said this, murmurs of shock rippled through the ordinary people from Lexington Base. They were questioning how these cores could possibly be insufficient, wondering if their resources were running dry.

"Too expensive, you say? Where else in this world can you awaken abilities besides here? These crystal cores can be collected in a few days by any ability user by killing zombies. If you don’t awaken your powers, will you be able to gather enough in your next life?" Scarlett boldly stated. At the negotiation table, she never held back. If she didn’t manage to get a good deal, it would be a failure on her part.

Adam nodded seriously. "Alright then, how many people’s potion costs can these cover?"

Scarlett thought for a moment. "Barely enough for ten people, but I’ll give you a discount. We also need to arrange rooms and personnel support, and those costs add up."

"Fine, ten people it is." Adam agreed without further haggling, casually pointing to ten individuals for Scarlett’s team to take for health checks. Notably, Lily was not included in that group.

This left Lily in a panic. After finally arriving at the fortress, surviving a near-death experience, she wasn’t even among the first batch of awakeners. Once again, she began to cry, her sobbing drawing everyone's attention.

Unable to tolerate her wailing, Scarlett handed her over to Lucy Johnson and Zoe, then led the newcomers back to the training room.

The remaining individuals were assigned to three dormitories that had been specially reserved. Lily continued to plead with Adam for a chance to receive the injection, while Zoe, having finished her cleanup, was eager to see her parents and brother.

Just as she was about to leave the dormitory, a fortress staff member stopped her, speaking curtly. "Miss Zoe, you can’t go outside for now; outsiders aren’t allowed to wander freely within the fortress."

Zoe pointed to herself in disbelief. "I can’t go either?"

She was taken aback; she never anticipated that returning would come with restrictions. If she had known, she wouldn’t have played along with Adam’s charade.

Just as she was processing this, Lily chimed in again. "Does Miss Zoe still think she’s the same as before? Don’t you feel embarrassed? People see you as a traitor now."

After saying this, Lily exaggeratedly covered her mouth and laughed lightly, quickly adding, "Don’t mind me, Miss Zoe. I’m just straightforward; I didn’t mean any harm."

Her smug demeanor was infuriating, and Zoe clenched her fists. While she understood that Adam was playing a long game, that didn’t mean she couldn’t give this annoying little fish a beating.

At that moment, Adam’s deputy approached and mentioned that he needed to discuss something, which inadvertently saved Lily from further embarrassment. Unaware of her precarious situation, she continued to taunt, "Oh dear, once a young lady, now a complete joke. It’s important to have self-awareness, but some people are just too oblivious."

Zoe was so furious she almost turned around, but the deputy held her back, softly saying, "Miss Zoe, Scarlett asked for you. Don’t bother with the crazy one."

Zoe was still fuming when she reached Scarlett’s office. Seeing Adam, Lucy, and Mike all present, she rushed to hug Scarlett and began to vent her frustrations.

"Sis, I’m about to be driven crazy. If I had known, I wouldn’t have played that ridiculous love triangle scene with Captain Stone. Look at me; I’m all dark and skinny now!"

Lucy initially thought her niece would apologize for her earlier actions, but she remained the same as ever. What did she mean by “playing a scene”?

Noticing her uncle’s disapproving gaze, Zoe feigned innocence and chuckled. Lucy shot her a stern look and said, "You better explain yourself. Your parents and brother are a mess over what you did, and they’ve been keeping their heads down in the fortress."

Zoe was alarmed; she hadn’t considered that her actions would affect her family. She began to spill everything like a broken dam. "Alright, alright! That day when the zombies breached, we couldn’t fight back at all. We were terrified! Scarlett and Captain Stone weren’t around, and just when I was about to be bitten, Captain Stone showed up like a hero. I was so excited that I fainted!"

Turning to Scarlett, she added with a grin, "Sis, I swear I didn’t mean it! I hugged Captain Stone just to thank him for saving my life! I had no ulterior motives! You know me; our tastes in men are completely different. I don’t like overly controlling guys!"

Now it was Adam’s turn to glare at her, but thankfully no one interrupted.

"Then I woke up in the infirmary. Captain Stone asked me to play along with him in a scene and then hurried off without explaining why. I thought he was just tired of being in a nameless relationship with Scarlett and wanted me to provoke her a little since everyone knows their relationship is as solid as bulletproof glass—impossible to break!"

Well, now both Scarlett and Adam were staring at her. But with a mentality of “more lice don’t bite, and more debts don’t worry,” she wasn’t fazed by their glares. After all, she was being honest, and as long as she wasn’t embarrassed, the awkwardness was all on them.

"You all know what happened next. Captain Stone didn’t give me a script, so I just improvised! Whatever he said, I echoed. Wherever he went, I had to follow. You guys have no idea how I’ve been living these past few days. I haven’t slept in a proper bed and have been running around outside, dealing with annoying little nuisances that just pop up from who knows where!"
