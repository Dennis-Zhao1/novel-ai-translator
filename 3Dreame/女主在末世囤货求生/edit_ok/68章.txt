**The Smith Family Chronicles**

Unsure of Ethan's intentions, Ivy Thompson felt a mix of emotions as she returned to her room. She paced the hallway for what seemed like an eternity before finally knocking on Ethan's door.

Ethan had already settled in for the night, but upon hearing the knock, he got up, threw on a hoodie, and opened the door. He found Ivy standing there, looking a bit lost.

With the keen instincts of someone accustomed to high-stakes situations, he sensed he should invite her in.

He poured her a cup of hot cocoa and handed it to her to warm her hands, his voice softening instinctively. “Ivy, what's on your mind?”

Ivy looked up, her expression serious. “How much do you know about the Mountain Ridge Facility?”

“There’s a lot to know about Mountain Ridge. What exactly are you curious about?” Ethan replied, slightly taken aback. If this were just small talk, she wouldn’t come knocking at his door this late.

“I’m not sure... maybe...” Ivy’s gaze locked onto Ethan’s. “Can you tell me about the supply reserves at the Mountain Ridge Facility?”

Ethan was momentarily taken aback by the question. It wasn’t that he didn’t know the answer; he had a good idea of their stockpiles. But he couldn’t understand why this was important to her.

As he pondered how best to respond, Ivy pressed on. “Do you think the heavy snowfall could disrupt Mountain Ridge’s operations?”

Ethan paused, long enough for Ivy to feel the cup in her hands start to cool.

“I don’t foresee any major issues. Mountain Ridge is well-prepared. Besides military support, they extensively stocked up when the crisis first began. With what our team brought back, they could sustain everyone there for two years without a hitch,” he stated confidently.

Ivy set down the cup, contemplating with her chin in her hand.

Ethan didn’t interrupt her thoughts. Instead, he finished the cocoa in her cup, confirming it had indeed gone cold.

“Maybe you could run these by me, you know, since I'm on your team now,” he quipped lightly, a playful smile tugging at his lips.

What troubled Ivy was that ever since Ethan had joined the refuge, he hadn’t been on any missions. Observing him, she noted he hadn’t been in touch with anyone outside either. Even when he handed over that USB drive for Mountain Ridge, all it contained was evidence of John Miller's misdeeds—no hidden files or malicious software.

In her eyes, Ethan was straightforward.

Yet the betrayal she had experienced in the past made it difficult for her to fully trust anyone, not even the older members of her family she had brought along.

After a moment’s hesitation, Ivy finally shared her concern. “I suspect there might be infiltrators from Mountain Ridge within our refuge.”

Ethan wasn’t surprised; Mountain Ridge was a complex web of factions, all competing against one another.

Ivy studied his calm demeanor, his eyes showing no sign of alarm, and continued, “If they’re not after the supplies, then what could they be seeking?”

Ethan considered this too. But as Ivy’s eyes met his again, they both spoke in unison: “The cure for the virus!”

Indeed, besides that, what else would Mountain Ridge covet from the refuge? Perhaps they were also interested in Dr. Johnson and his research team. Only in the refuge was there no exchange of scientific achievements for power and profit.

But now, nothing was certain.

Ivy quickly checked her side, spending two days confirming there were no infiltrators among her people—at least none from Mountain Ridge.

Once again, it came back to the Smith family. Ivy felt a twinge of resignation. The last time Grandpa Smith had imposed a punishment, he did so with great care, showing how seriously he viewed his family, whether direct descendants or those more distant. Given the circumstances, she could only prioritize caution.

As the saying goes, “There are thieves every day, but there’s no such thing as a foolproof plan.” After much discussion, Ivy and Ethan decided to confide in Lucas Smith.

He was a young man, clever and resourceful, not easily swayed by family ties and capable of distinguishing right from wrong.

Finding a reason, she invited Lucas Smith to Ethan’s room, carefully ensuring no one could overhear their conversation.

Once he heard the start of their conversation, Lucas quickly connected the dots, aligning with Ivy’s suspicions. He too believed that Mountain Ridge was primarily interested in the cure.

However, it was unclear how they would go about obtaining it, but it was evident their methods wouldn’t be straightforward.

There were just too many leeches within the Smith family, already starting to eat away at their foundation. Lucas felt an urgency that matched Ivy’s concerns.

This matter couldn’t be publicized; Lucas needed to act quickly to root out the leeches before they caused irreparable damage.

Before leaving, as if understanding why Ivy had only shared this with him, he tousled her hair and reassured her, “Don’t worry, your cousin’s got this.”

Ivy nodded. After Lucas left, she lingered in Ethan’s room for a while longer.

Ethan was puzzled by her reaction. With the most capable member of the Smith family on the case, the leeches would be dealt with swiftly, so what was she so anxious about?

Ivy wasn’t just worried about this issue; she couldn’t share with Ethan her fears of an unknown future and the impending disaster she knew was coming, yet couldn’t pinpoint when it would strike.

Human evolution was relentless, and they had to find a way to halt the virus’ advancement.

The day before New Year’s Eve, Grandpa Smith had organized a gathering for everyone to celebrate together. Outside, the world was blanketed in white, and the children were busy cutting paper snowflakes for window decorations, the red paper dyed with beets.

Grandpa Smith and Old Man Jones each wrote a few verses, directing their sons to hang them on the doors.

Ivy stood beside Mrs. Davis, watching her wrap dumplings, her heart set on the lobster dumplings.

Mike had led a group of young men back from the woods with firewood, competing to see who could chop the best.

A few months prior, Lucas had quietly informed Ivy that they had caught the leeches—specifically, the sons of the two scoundrels from the distant branch who had previously offended her.

Taking advantage of the outer perimeter’s patrol, they intentionally lagged behind and colluded with individuals from Mountain Ridge, leaking information about the cure.

However, these individuals weren’t part of the Smith family’s power center, so they didn’t possess much knowledge.

As for Mountain Ridge’s plans, after several days of interrogation, they hadn’t divulged anything, indicating they genuinely knew nothing.

That family had already been secretly sent out of the refuge and detained elsewhere by Lucas.

Seeing Lucas’s confident demeanor, Ivy felt relieved with how the matter was resolved. Grandpa Smith’s health was declining, and it was better not to burden him with such troubles.

Turning back to see the two old men comparing their calligraphy, each refusing to yield to the other in a playful manner, she felt a warmth in her heart.

As Ivy noted the dumplings were boiling, she wanted to ask when they would be ready to taste, when suddenly the ground shook, followed by a deafening explosion.

The vibrations shook the snow off the rooftops and trees.

Ivy and the others rushed outside, fearing a landslide or avalanche.

To their shock, the continuous explosions were coming from the only checkpoint in and out of the refuge.

Then came the shrill sound of alarms, frantic shouts from children, and women calling for their kids, while adults grabbed weapons and rushed towards the checkpoint.

Ivy joined the crowd, sprinting alongside Ethan. Mike and his gang of young men had already driven ahead toward the checkpoint.

“It’s an attack from Mountain Ridge!” 

Those six words struck Ivy’s heart like a heavy hammer.
