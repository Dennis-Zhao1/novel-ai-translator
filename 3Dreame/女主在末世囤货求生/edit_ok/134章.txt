**Catching Mice**

Ivy's keen intuition was on high alert as she observed the few intruders sneaking into their territory. It was quite amusing to see them trying to evade the watchful eyes of the security detail. They knew there were capable individuals guarding this area, yet they still dared to take the risk. What could possibly drive them to come here?

With a laid-back demeanor, Ivy waited for these intruders to make their move. When the two parties finally came face to face, everyone was caught off guard.

It turned out that Emily, who had been taken hostage, had a sharp knife pressed against her throat, glinting under the dim streetlights. Ethan stood behind Ivy, ready to spring into action. But Ivy was quicker, using her quick reflexes to knock the knife-wielding hand away. Emily, reacting swiftly, ducked and sprinted towards Ivy.

The intruders, caught by surprise, turned to flee. However, they met Ethan's firepower, his well-aimed shots hitting their legs, causing them to cry out and collapse, unable to escape.

Ethan, anticipating a reunion with his girlfriend, watched in surprise as Emily sought comfort in Ivy's arms instead, leaving him feeling slightly bemused. The unexpected shift in emotion was palpable.

Ivy gently reassured Emily with a comforting pat before nudging her toward Ethan, giving him a look that said, "Your girlfriend needs you." Then she retrieved an old knife from her kit and approached the fallen intruders.

The night was dark, and the streetlights cast long shadows. As she got closer, she could see their faces—unfamiliar to her. Without hesitation, Ivy inflicted several wounds on one of them, her demeanor calm and collected. The others were frozen in fear, unsure how to plead with someone who clearly played by her own rules.

After dealing with one, she didn't bother checking if he was unconscious. Instead, she flashed a sweet smile and asked, “So, who’s the leader among you?”

The four men trembled at the sound of her gentle voice and quickly pointed at the one she had wounded. “Him! He’s our boss!”

“Boss, huh? Where were you guys before this?”

By now, Emily had regained her composure and rushed over to explain. She clarified that these four had been hanging around the outskirts, not exactly a notorious gang, but more like idle misfits who sometimes did odd jobs. They had come to the community to help with construction, and some remained for maintenance while others joined the farming team.

Emily admitted she had been careless. She intended to bring Ethan a late-night snack while he was on duty, only to be ambushed by these fools who demanded to know where the awakening serum was. Emily had no idea about this and quickly expressed her ignorance. They had threatened to use her to coerce Ethan into injecting them with the serum, hoping to gain abilities themselves.

Listening to their pleas, alongside Emily’s clarifications, Ivy soon pieced together their story. It seemed like mere coincidence that they had stumbled upon her. It was unlikely they were sent by someone with a grudge; if they were, it was foolish to send such inept individuals to challenge her.

Did they really think that because Ivy had a falling out with a former ally, they could act recklessly? How laughable.

Since the so-called leader was already incapacitated, there was no point in questioning the others for any critical information. Ethan took the remaining intruders and hung them up in the town square, leaving the unconscious one untouched.

He left one of the security team members at the square, planning to make an example of these audacious fools. They wouldn't be dealt with just yet; Ethan intended to bring Emily back first. Ivy waved her hand, indicating she’d continue her watch. The rest were manageable, but dealing with the more significant threat was indeed tricky, and she couldn't trust that to anyone else.

As dawn broke, Dr. Wilson arrived to relieve another team member. He paused when he saw Ivy, then smiled and reminded her to get some rest. After a brief chat, Dr. Wilson began recording everyone's data, comparing it to previous records and noticing something odd.

After pointing out the issue, Ivy used her investigative skills to check on the crystalline cores. They seemed to be crystallizing at twice the speed. “What’s going on?” she wondered aloud, exchanging puzzled looks with Dr. Wilson.

Suddenly, Dr. Wilson had a revelation. “I just remembered! The ratio of the X serum was doubled this time, and the sample was from a higher-grade core. The increased speed might be related to that!”

Ivy nodded, understanding the significance. The X serum was sourced from a special reserve, and it appeared these individuals would complete their crystallization and awakening process by tomorrow. Strangely, she felt a sense of anticipation.

As the morning light fully illuminated the community, the residents began to stir and go about their work. They noticed the four men hanging in the square, pointing and whispering. One of them was already unconscious, while the other three, having screamed through the night, now looked utterly defeated.

Ivy, accompanied by her uncle and others, approached the hanging men and addressed the community residents: “These individuals attempted to sabotage our project. They not only kidnapped Emily but also sought to threaten Captain Ethan. They clearly do not respect our community's rules or safety.”

Upon hearing that these troublemakers dared to disrupt the project, the residents erupted in anger. Someone picked up a rock and hurled it at the three men hanging there. Soon, others joined in, throwing stones and shouting, needing to vent their frustrations and warning any lurking threats to think twice.

Ignoring the chaos behind her, Ivy turned and headed back to her place. After a long night of vigilance, she washed up and rested, knowing she needed to be well-prepared for what lay ahead.

Now, it wasn’t just the security team on guard outside the facility; some families of those who had undergone treatment were also voluntarily keeping watch. When Ivy returned in the afternoon, someone reported that the ordinary people who had been affected were gradually waking up.

This indicated a 100% success rate for the treatment, and Uncle Joe reported they were experimenting by mixing the X serum with the antidote to see if it could reduce the fever and unconsciousness duration.

The research department was truly impressive, and Ivy thought that if the community were ever compromised, they could not afford to abandon the researchers and their equipment.

The awakening of the researchers’ abilities was also due for discussion.

Just as she was pondering this, Dr. Wilson rushed in, excited to report that several members of the security team were showing signs of awakening. Ivy couldn't help but exclaim, “That’s incredibly fast!”

Another team member was equally thrilled. They had optimized the ingredients in this batch of the serum, not only upgrading the cores and doubling the X serum but also adjusting other ratios. This was a significant achievement for them.

Seeing both of them so exuberant, Ivy couldn’t help but facepalm. It seemed they were really treating these individuals like lab rats.
