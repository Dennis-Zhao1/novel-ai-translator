### Mastering the Art of Energy Perception

Ivy Sinclair had no idea how she had drifted off to sleep, but when she awoke, she found herself understanding the sundial's ancient markings. It was as if a veil had lifted, offering her a glimpse into a deeper realm of knowledge. The clock on her bedside table read two in the morning, yet in this mystical space she had discovered, time flowed differently—100 days here equated to just one day outside.

Practicing magical techniques typically required endless hours, but this secret realm was like a hidden treasure, allowing Ivy to dedicate herself to mastering Energy Perception without the usual constraints of time. Eager to seize this opportunity, she dove into her practice.

However, Energy Perception wasn't as simple as she'd envisioned. It demanded intense focus and a robust mental force to perceive the subtle "energy" radiating from objects and people around her.

Jewels and gemstones emitted varied intensities of light; the higher the quality, the more radiant the glow. Lesser stones appeared dull, almost lifeless.

Determined, Ivy immersed herself in honing her skills. The vibrant spiritual energy within this space invigorated her, and when she opened her eyes, she felt a noticeable boost in her mental acuity and a deeper understanding of Energy Perception.

Stepping out of the mystical realm, she approached a jewelry chest in her room. Concentrating, she could now easily discern the brilliance of the gems within. Leveraging her background as a skilled appraiser, she confirmed that the most luminous treasures were indeed of top quality.

Moreover, she found she could lift an entire bookshelf with her mind, although for now, she still needed to physically interact with each item. 

"If only I could extend my reach further," Ivy pondered, "I could gather things from across the room."

Inspired by her progress, she resolved to train even harder. "What if I could achieve that?" she thought with excitement.

After collecting everything in her secret room, she gathered her grandfather's notes and other significant items, leaving the rest for another time.

Back in her bedroom, Ivy continued her rigorous practice. Her mental pathways felt more open and resilient, a testament to her growing strength.

The next morning, after wrapping up her routine, she prepared for a crucial day ahead—she needed to exchange some resources. With a determined mindset, she headed to her office.

Upon checking her phone, she saw messages from her peers, the elite young professionals, who had been active even at four in the morning.

Ivy didn't rush to respond. Once at the office, she instructed her assistant to assemble a legal team. With numerous assets to exchange, she needed to ensure everything was airtight, legally speaking.

She had no intention of letting anyone exploit loopholes to take advantage of her.

Her assistant, though unsure of Ivy's grand plan, followed her directives without question. Soon, they gathered the heads of the legal and business departments for a strategic meeting.

Ivy outlined her vision, delegating tasks and allowing her assistant to oversee the execution. Around ten o'clock that morning, the online business group buzzed with activity. Ivy, however, remained silent, letting the others speculate about her intentions.

Her demeanor that day was starkly different from yesterday, leaving the group of young elites guessing. With competitors and their families eager to acquire Ivy's assets, the group began figuring out how to grab her attention.

Some tried sending virtual gifts, while others awkwardly attempted small talk, until someone flaunted their family's flashy pink helicopter. That caught Ivy's eye, prompting her to join the chat.

Realizing the right approach, the group began sharing photos of family planes and yachts. Ivy subtly guided the conversation, and they soon shifted to open bidding.

She wasn’t about to rush into any deals, aware that could raise suspicions. Ivy was playing the long game.

Observing the chat, she privately messaged a few individuals to gauge their thoughts. Some hesitated, admitting they weren’t sure of her assets. Ivy paused, then shared a list detailing her holdings and recent dividends in the group.

Her transparency stunned everyone—"Is she really that bold?" they wondered. 

Ivy's audacity left a mark, reestablishing her as the "bold innovator" unafraid of risks.

The young elites quickly informed their families, arranging for experts to appraise Ivy's assets.

When they learned Ivy was only interested in a yacht and a helicopter, they couldn't help but chuckle, thinking she lacked business acumen, viewing her as an affluent youth indulging whimsically.

This only confirmed she wasn’t scheming; she was genuinely redistributing wealth with a carefree attitude.

Ivy swiftly finalized trades with two families: a helicopter from a blossoming e-commerce company and a yacht from a small firm—both perks from previous acquisitions.

These trades, while seemingly extravagant, were strategic, ensuring both parties felt they had made wise decisions.

The others, shocked by the swift deals, rushed to verify the assets' authenticity and value with their families.

Some even offered to buy outright. Ivy, however, neither accepted nor declined, simply stating, "We're focusing on exchanges, and others are still gathering their offerings."

Those interested in cash transactions prepared alternative proposals. Ivy had her plans; some items were better acquired through barter due to their unique nature.

Especially those from families with military or political ties. Ivy knew exactly what she wanted next: specialized equipment.

In the U.S., acquiring military-grade supplies required stringent qualifications and procedures. Ivy had the resources to manage this, but time was of the essence. Direct exchange with a qualified company was more efficient.

Indeed, the group was soon flooded with offers of luxury villas, private islands, yachts, and even bars, none piquing Ivy's interest. One boastful peer even claimed to have bought a "star," leaving her amused.

It wasn’t until a member shared a picture of a sleek armored vehicle that Ivy's interest was truly piqued—this was it.

The vehicle was a military-grade armored car, sturdy and bulletproof, far superior to regular SUVs. Ivy replied with a simple “Impressive.”

The group lit up with excitement. Capturing Ivy's interest was a badge of honor. Young and wealthy, her desire for impressive things was unquestioned—after all, with her status, why wouldn't she indulge?

A flurry of images followed, showcasing modified vehicles, armored cars, and even warships. These individuals had both domestic and international channels, fearing nothing when it came to high-profile purchases.

Ivy wasn't short on resources; she merely found it inconvenient to handle everything directly.

With these elites drawing attention, she could remain in the shadows, collecting supplies discreetly and efficiently—a perfect setup.

Of course, she wouldn’t display urgency; instead, she feigned mild interest, prompting the group to vie for her attention, each trying to outdo the others.

Their eagerness was palpable.
