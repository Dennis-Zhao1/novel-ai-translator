**Boosting Points**

Ivy paused for a moment upon hearing Ethan's words. What did that mean? Was there some kind of surprise waiting for her?

Ethan tilted his head slightly at Ivy, revealing a somewhat meaningful smile that gave off a mischievous vibe, reminiscent of boys in school plotting harmless pranks.

"Come on, stop keeping me in suspense. What's up?"

Ethan longed to ruffle her hair but restrained himself, merely rubbing his fingers together instead.

Seeing that he wasn’t answering, Ivy expanded her mental perception and discovered that the dark corridor appeared empty at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, she found it filled with numerous subtle dark spots of light. These weren’t the bright red speckles like rambutan but rather a color unique to the unsightly flowers they were facing. Just looking at them sent shivers down her spine, and she finally understood what he meant by “fear of dense clusters.”

"So, what's the plan?" 

Ivy knew that if Ethan had made a decision, he must have been prepared.

"I think roasting the unsightly flowers sounds good."

Ethan retrieved the Blaze Dragon from his inventory, a flamethrower highly recommended by the spirited guide. Its power was reported to be over three times stronger than the one Ivy had stored, and the fuel could be converted from crystal cores. In other words, as long as there were zombies and those mutated plants around, the Blaze Dragon could be used indefinitely.

He then handed the Blaze Dragon to Ivy and pulled out two fireproof suits.

When Ivy saw the array of equipment—fireproof suits, boots, gloves, and a helmet that could filter air and was self-circulating—she felt impressed. The fireproof suits even had side pockets for small oxygen tanks, which was incredibly thoughtful.

As for the Blaze Dragon, it was lightweight, aesthetically pleasing, and offered a great grip. It seemed that the equipment primarily favored metallic colors, with very few painted designs. The Blaze Dragon's paint job, however, was stunning, combining red, black, silver, and gray in a striking manner, with a unique shape and smooth lines—it was a true masterpiece among artful creations.

Ethan examined the weapon closely and agreed with the spirited guide's enthusiastic recommendation and its boastful confidence.

After explaining how to use the weapons, the two donned their fireproof suits and ventured deeper into the corridor. The headlamp clipped onto the helmet made it look somewhat like an astronaut's helmet but smaller and more comfortable, without putting pressure on the neck. The entire outfit felt lightweight and breathable; at least Ivy felt comfortably cool in it.

As they moved further inside, the corridor became densely packed with unsightly flowers. Suddenly, Ivy had an idea: if they burned the flowers directly, wouldn’t that waste the seeds inside them? This was a fantastic opportunity to rack up points.

"Ethan, why don’t we let these ugly things spray their seeds out before we set them on fire?"

Ivy looked at Ethan, who thought for a moment before nodding.

He took out the protective shield they had used earlier, and Ivy began tossing incendiary bottles from her space. Meanwhile, Ethan unleashed a lightning strike.

As soon as they attacked, the unsightly flower's vine-like tendrils whipped out, dozens of them striking together. Before the protective shield could fully deploy, Ivy quickly pulled Ethan into her space.

"I was careless; I forgot how wide the attack range of the ugly flowers’ tendrils is."

Ivy patted her chest, then removed her helmet. Perhaps after a long day of running around without much rest or food, she suddenly felt a bit lightheaded from low blood sugar. She hurriedly grabbed some food, and the two placed their helmets on the dining table before digging in.

It was only right to fill up before heading back out to collect points.

This time, she opted for a refreshing bowl of cold pasta salad. As the weather grew hotter, she didn’t want to eat anything too warm. Ethan chose the same, and they each had a large bowl of pasta salad accompanied by lemonade, making it feel more like a date than a mission to fight.

Outside was fraught with danger, but inside, they were at ease. Ethan felt slightly conflicted; the contrast was too stark. Watching Ivy adapt so well, he thought that perhaps women were naturally better at coping with stress.

After eating their fill, Ivy chatted with the spirited guide for a while before reminding Ethan to immediately deploy the protective shield as soon as they went out. They counted down from three, two, one, and reappeared in the exact spot they had left.

At that moment, the ugly flowers had stopped their tendril attacks. In fact, they ceased once they lost their target, but they hadn’t sprayed many seeds yet—the range of the incendiary bottles was indeed quite small.

"Let’s go again."

Ethan unleashed an electric net that caused the unsightly flowers to screech in disarray. While the sound of a single flower was minimal, the collective noise of thousands of them became overwhelming. Just before the tendrils could strike again, they raised the protective shield. Ivy seized the opportunity to throw several more incendiary bottles.

She had also checked her space earlier and found not only incendiary bottles but also fire bombs, though she wasn’t sure if they would be as effective as the Blaze Dragon.

This time, their offensive was far stronger than the previous wave. The unsightly flowers sensed the threat to their lives and began attacking the protective shield frantically. Ivy worried whether it would hold.

"Relax, the system only produces top-quality goods; these ugly creatures are nothing to worry about," the spirited guide chimed in.

Ethan relayed the guide's words with a smile, which reassured Ivy. As the ugly flowers’ attacks began to weaken, she took the chance to use the air gun.

Firing several shots in quick succession, the nearest cluster of unsightly flowers was blasted to pieces, spraying seeds everywhere.

Ivy swiftly set out some open jars in a row, waiting for the seeds to fall into them.

As the seeds hit the protective shield and bounced back into the jars, it wasn’t long before they saw a layer of seeds accumulating at the bottom of the jars. Some scattered outside, but Ivy wasn’t in a hurry.

Feeling that this method wasn’t efficient enough, she pulled out a large net, originally meant for fishing, and started scooping up the seeds from the ground. This method proved to be significantly faster.

Before long, her net was filled with a small pile of seeds, and Ivy excitedly called out to Ethan to continue. Just how many points would this yield? Seeing her greedy expression, Ethan couldn’t help but smile. The synergy between them was undeniable; it was certainly less tiring working together.

In no time, they were both moving around, collecting seeds while Ethan dealt with the unsightly flowers. Ivy watched as he switched between various weapons—one moment freezing the flowers, the next wielding the Blaze Dragon, then unleashing a lightning strike, or using the air gun like a machine gun.

But that wasn’t all; he also pulled out a long-forgotten sword, skillfully dodging the attacking tendrils and using his agility to slice through the surrounding unsightly flowers, leaving a scene of utter chaos.

It was incredibly relieving to watch; at that moment, who cared about the fear of density? If the unsightly flowers had legs, they would surely run away.

While the seeds were sprayed and the protective shield held strong, the unsightly flowers couldn’t touch them a bit, only to be chopped into pieces. It was utterly frustrating for them.

Ivy collected the seeds, filling one jar after another for Ethan to store. The spirited guide was practically beaming with joy; its excitement was palpable from its cheerful voice. However, since the points weren’t doubled this time, this bounty of seeds likely wouldn’t be a small amount, so Ethan chose not to argue further, knowing when to stop was essential.

Still feeling that their efficiency was too low, the two of them hadn’t even cleared a third of the area. The deeper they ventured, the denser the unsightly flowers became, and their attacks grew fiercer.

As their points increased, Ethan considered redeeming some explosives but ultimately abandoned the idea, fearing a cave-in. However, he did stumble upon a great find: a boomerang, notable for its ability to transform into three blades after being thrown, complete with an automatic return feature.
