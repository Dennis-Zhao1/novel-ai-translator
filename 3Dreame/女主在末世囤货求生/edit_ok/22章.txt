Abandoned Military Base

Ever since that bolt of inspiration struck her, sending a jolt through her very being, Lora Benson had been pondering the best kind of fortress to construct.

During this period of planning, she delegated the procurement of supplies to the Smith family, while coordinating military equipment with Chris. It wasn't that she couldn't contact the suppliers directly; it was just that navigating the trade required a keen understanding of its unwritten rules—a skill smart people mastered.

After all, who would refuse an opportunity for commission? Crossing Chris would be a grave mistake.

Once the Smith family placed their orders, the suppliers confirmed that the pickup date would remain unchanged, and they promised to arrange for the delivery of other resources. Lora had no objections and mentioned she had a substantial collection of jewelry and gold she wanted to liquidate, hoping to sell it when collecting the goods.

Chris, of course, welcomed this with open arms; continuous business meant endless streams of income. He estimated the market prices and quantities, recognizing that the Benson family was a reputable jewelry dynasty, making these assets significant.

However, the sudden liquidation of such assets made him speculate, even though he respected client privacy. Could it be political upheaval back in their homeland, prompting the Benson family to seek safety abroad? It seemed unlikely, as they had already secured their overseas holdings. Could they be planning a significant move locally?

Coincidentally, Chris's initial thoughts mirrored those of the elder Smith. In reality, no one could have guessed that the true reason was the impending apocalypse.

After securing the military supplies, Lora began researching various designs for apocalyptic fortresses from her home. Most of what she found were underground shelters built by wealthy foreigners, which she could only describe as extravagant "snail houses."

She had no intention of squeezing into one of those places to survive the apocalypse.

Lora secretly regretted being so naive in her past life, like a puppet led by unseen strings, without gathering any useful information.

As she delved into her studies, the elder Smith also gathered his relatives with ties to the construction industry to brainstorm.

They were unaware of the reasons behind the sudden large-scale activities within the family. While everything seemed calm externally, internally, everyone couldn't help but wonder about the unusual movements.

Such a major operation couldn’t possibly be attributed to the old man losing his mind; that didn’t align with his usual behavior, which always revolved around the family's interests.

Considering it was unreasonable to erect a skyscraper overnight, which would attract too much attention, both Lora and the elder Smith preferred to create an underground fortress with well-guarded entrances to ensure maximum safety.

Aside from her desire to avoid cramped spaces, Lora had no objections. Just when everyone was at a loss, a college student from the Smith family used GPS satellite maps to discover an obscure abandoned military base in the mountainous outskirts of Denver. Interestingly, its abandonment was due to exposure by foreign spies.

Upon seeing this, Lora’s eyes lit up. She had heard of this place in her previous life; it was the base that a team of uniquely talented individuals, whom even Ethan wanted to recruit, had occupied.

With Lora's approval, the elder Smith arranged for his son, who had military connections, to investigate. Such a place was sensitive yet had been abandoned for years. Now, it could potentially be exchanged for benefits, so the difficulty level should be manageable.

As predicted, the military never expected the base they had heavily invested in would go to waste after exposure. It was like a long-abandoned building suddenly finding a buyer eager to take it off their hands; this was a stroke of luck. Smart people knew how to seize opportunities; hesitating even for a second would be a sign of disrespect towards the Smith family's sincerity in financial terms.

Successfully acquiring the transfer agreement, the Smith family members maintained calm expressions, as if they couldn't muster the emotions to reflect their current feelings.

When Lora heard they had effortlessly secured the transfer agreement, along with the usage rights to several nearby hills, she was thrilled. The area was interconnected with a concealed terrain historically considered strategically advantageous—easy to defend and difficult to attack. Additionally, being far from crowds meant fewer potential threats.

Next came the planning and construction of the fortress's interior, which needed reliable water and electricity supplies, comfortable living conditions for residents, and arrangements for any potential survivors.

After settling the payment for military supplies, Lora found her funds dwindling. Money was truly hard to come by. Under the elder Smith's guidance, she managed to liquidate joint ventures and recoup some losses.

With the recovered funds, Lora stocked up on pork, beef, chicken, seafood, and other perishables, knowing her storage space could keep them fresh without spoilage concerns.

Upon discovering the changes in her storage space, Lora realized it had mountains, water, flowers, and trees. It seemed logical to raise small animals there, right?

She bought two rabbits for an experiment, but without a proper enclosure, they bolted as soon as they were released.

Unable to chase the rabbits across the mountains, Lora decided to buy two chickens instead, placing them in a coop she had purchased. To her surprise, it seemed she could indeed raise them.

With the livestock from her farm now housed in the space, Lora mimicked the farm’s layout, creating an area near the water source, using fencing ordered online to enclose a sizable section.

The animals and supplies were moved inside, and the staff managing the farm were reassigned to other tasks.

Despite the fenced area being quite large, it didn’t occupy much space in her storage.

Feeling reassured, Lora planned to stockpile many more items, especially those taking up space. She had previously collaborated with the Carter family, negotiating with military political families, exchanging a batch of armored and modified vehicles. The project was due for delivery soon, and Lora was waiting at her residence.

On Memorial Day weekend, the modified vehicles began arriving at the family’s farm warehouse. This batch of armored vehicles was exchanged for assets valued in the millions, amounting to dozens of vehicles.

She specifically requested that the design of the rooftops incorporate spaces for weapon placements, like machine guns and rocket launchers.

Without objections, the modifications proceeded efficiently.

Lora had thought she wasn’t fond of vehicles, but seeing four warehouses filled to the brim with them, especially knowing how cool and safe they looked, filled her with an excitement that was hard to share with others.

Gloating in secret, Lora stored all the vehicles in her space, parking them not far from the fuel truck, alongside the yacht and helicopter she had acquired earlier. At a glance, it resembled a transport exhibition, grand and impressive.

As she strolled among the vehicles, Lora noticed that most were filled to the brim with fuel, which was quite nice.

In the following days, she visited a dealership to select several RVs and lightweight electric cars.

The transformation of the abandoned military base was progressing rapidly.

Basic facilities were prioritized, with electricity needs addressed first. Relying solely on fuel generators was impractical; she had heard the base previously utilized hydropower but had dismantled the generator upon abandonment.

With foundational infrastructure taking shape, the next steps were straightforward. Once again, Lora financed the project while the Smith family contributed both funds and labor.

Lora believed in fairness and insisted on sharing costs for acquiring the military base and constructing the facilities equally among the Smith family members.

Her name was also on the transfer agreement, and she and the elder Smith signed a separate asset proportion agreement.

Each party purchased their own supplies, while both legally held the real estate.

This clear division of responsibilities fostered a pleasant relationship, and cooperation remained comfortable for both Lora and the elder Smith.
