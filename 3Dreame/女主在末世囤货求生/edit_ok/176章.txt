**Human Cocoon**

Anna and Logan hadn't been part of the last rescue mission, so they looked bewildered when Jessie spoke. Lucas and Ethan exchanged a knowing glance, recalling the frustration of that stubborn lab door.

"Why don’t you give it a shot?" Jessie suggested with a grin, nodding toward Ethan to tackle the door. This earned her a few amused eye rolls from the group.

"What's with the looks? Did I say something crazy?" Jessie asked, genuinely puzzled. If they could power the elevator, then surely an electronic lab lock was a piece of cake, right?

"You really think Ethan's got the code for this door?" Anna replied, trying to reason with Jessie, who seemed to think everything was just a matter of willpower.

Meanwhile, Lucas had already pulled a small explosive from his backpack, the same kind they used to take down the old Maple Forest Facility. It wasn’t overly destructive but perfect for a situation like this.

"Alright, everyone step back! We’re about to blow it open."

Just as Lucas finished speaking, Ethan heard a familiar, nagging voice inside his head.

“Hey, we've been spotted! The bad guys know where we are, and it's about to get wild. If you run into them, give me a heads up!”

"Spotted? Let’s move!" Ethan quickly yanked Lucas back, bracing for the blast.

The explosion was loud but contained. The lab door was blown open, and as the dust settled, Lucas tried to pinpoint their exact location using his heightened senses, only to notice strange lights converging on them.

"Quick, get inside and find the others!" Lucas urged, leading the charge through the newly created opening.

"Dr. Smith, Dr. Johnson, is anyone here?" The lab was dimly lit, and after a moment's hesitation, Ethan touched the exposed wires on the wall. The lights flickered before fully illuminating the space.

Lucas and the others rushed to the office door, which was tightly shut. With a swift kick, Lucas broke it open, and the sight inside made the room spin.

Instead of a typical office setup, the room was cramped and eerily silent, filled with rows of silk-like cocoons. Jessie instinctively moved to tear them open, but Lucas held her back.

"Don’t be hasty! This silk might be toxic."

"Yeah, those bright colors scream danger," Anna added, her voice steady. Ethan pulled out a pair of gloves from his fireproof suit, built to resist both fire and toxins. He brandished a dagger, ready to cut through the silk.

Lucas handed out swords to the team, and they set to work. The silk was tough but no match for their blades.

Anna used a compact dagger from her family, sharp and efficient.

Lucas joined in with fireproof gloves, and together they peeled back the cocoons. Sadly, everyone inside was unconscious—over forty people in all. They needed to revive the superhumans fast. Lucas had brought enough antidote, but they were running against the clock. They needed to act before the creatures downstairs got to them.

He distributed the antidote and water, urging them to prioritize giving it to Gabe, Luke, and the other superhumans. Sensing impending danger, he decided to join Ethan in fending off the approaching threats outside, buying Anna and the others time to free and awaken the superhumans.

"Anna, you and Logan put on these gloves. Jessie, you're in charge of administering the antidote and hydrating them. Ethan and I will stand guard. Be safe!"

Tossing the gloves to Anna, Lucas grabbed his air gun and headed out.

Ethan followed, hearing the spirited voice cheering him on.

"Wow, she's amazing! Totally dazzling!"

"Quiet down! You're gonna distract me!" Ethan snapped as he joined Lucas. They watched a wave of mutated plants and insects swarm toward them, making zombies seem tame by comparison.

Their air guns fired relentlessly, but Lucas felt it wasn't enough. He amped up the heat.

A popular weapon, the Flame Dragon, appeared in his hands. As it roared to life, a rush of energy surged through him.

"Ethan, let’s team up! It'll be a blast!"

The Flame Dragon had a wide attack range, unlike the air guns. One was great for up-close combat, the other for keeping distance.

Ethan nodded, unleashing the Flame Dragon alongside Lucas.

"Will they ever stop coming? I’m not backing down!" Lucas shouted, his anger fueling his fire and ice powers. Ethan joined in with his ice gun, amplifying the chill to maximize their impact.

To anyone watching, it was a spectacle: flames roaring and the ground covered in icy shards.

This strategy created a barrier with fire, while the ice gun dealt with the mutant flora and fauna’s onslaught.

Zombies started pouring in, clawing and snapping. Lucas raised his hand, launching ice needles that pierced their targets, only for Ethan’s gun to freeze them solid. A little extra force would shatter them to pieces.

Once frozen, the zombies crumbled, their cores falling free, untouched by the ice as if they were separate entities.

After about half an hour, Anna and Logan joined them, reporting that Gabe and the other superhumans were awake, and Jessie was tending to the rest.

"You all hold the line here. I’m going in to check things out."

With that, Lucas dashed inside.

"Gabe, how’re you holding up?" He found Gabe leaning against the wall, pale from earlier poison exposure. Jessie was still busy administering water and antidotes.

"Gabe, how’d you all end up here?" she asked.

Gabe gulped down the water Lucas handed him, taking deep breaths before speaking in a raspy voice.

"We were heading to check on Ethan and the others at the base, but got blocked by mutated plants. We diverted to the backup base, but trouble hit as soon as we arrived."

"We thought we’d be safe there, but some kids got curious. When their parents couldn't find them, they opened the base door themselves to search and got ambushed. Everyone was captured and brought here."

After hearing Gabe’s story, Lucas pieced together the whole situation.

Once Jessie had administered the antidote to everyone, Lucas gathered all the non-superhumans into his backpack, arranging them in the bus he had stored inside. Originally, he thought a cargo truck would be more practical, but if these folks fell asleep, it could get dangerously overcrowded. A bus was just right for their needs.
