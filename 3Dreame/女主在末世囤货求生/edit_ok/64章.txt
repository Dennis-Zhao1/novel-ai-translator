**Waiting for a Rabbit by the Stump**

Adam Smith initially thought that bringing Ethan's group back to the End Times Fortress would encounter some obstacles, but to his surprise, everything went smoothly. Soon after, the rumors stirred up by Larry seemed to vanish without a trace. Perhaps it was Uncle Joe who intervened, Adam guessed.

As the days passed, the weather grew colder, and the temperatures in the mountainous areas dropped a few degrees lower than the city. By early December, snow began to fall. With the roads icy, tires easily slipped, and Adam stopped venturing outside.

The Kunshan base sent people over a few times, but they were not looking for Adam. They were after Ethan. Previously entangled in schemes against fellow base members and injuring the son of a base official, Ethan was now wanted by Kunshan. The leader of the Kunshan base, of course, wanted to believe in his trusted right-hand man, but the mysterious death of Captain George, who was his wife's brother and Larry's uncle, complicated matters. A series of actions taken by Ethan after the accusations seemed to confirm he was the instigator, making it hard for anyone to believe he was innocent.

Ethan had not shown himself, instead sending a USB drive with a member of his team to the Kunshan base. After that, Kunshan stopped sending people over.

The End Times Fortress was well-constructed, orderly, and maintained a three-shift patrol system, which was reduced to two shifts due to the heavy snowfall. Adam opened the warehouse door, revealing all the supplies he had stockpiled, which was substantial but paled in comparison to the Smith family's reserves. The old steward managed these supplies, meticulously recording every transaction. Adam had never been involved, and the last time he tried to draw more supplies back, he was unexpectedly interrupted.

Today, the old steward had called him out because he had discovered a problem. Someone within the fortress was stealing supplies, a revelation that shocked Adam.

That night, Adam pretended to go back to his room to rest. As midnight approached, he changed into clothes suited for nighttime activities and quietly made his way to the perimeter of the warehouse, finding a well-concealed spot to lie in wait.

He sipped on a hot coffee, the warmth spreading through him, providing both energy and heat against the biting cold of the night.

As the snow began to fall again, the moon was often obscured, yet the surroundings remained bright. The warehouse where Adam stored supplies was somewhat isolated from the Smith family’s warehouse. He felt concern for the elderly members of the Lewis family and hadn’t arranged for anyone to keep watch at night.

After two cups of coffee without seeing a single ghostly figure, Adam's legs started to cramp from squatting. He stood up, supporting himself against the wall, shaking out his legs with a wince. Ouch, that was quite the discomfort...

Suddenly, a voice startled him. “What are you doing here?”

Adam jumped, looking up to see a tall shadow half-hidden in the wall's shadow, arms crossed, watching him.

“Catching rabbits,” he replied instinctively, then frowned, adding, “Seriously? Scaring me like that in the middle of the night? Ethan, are you not a little childish?”

“I think you’re the one who’s childish, sneaking around at this hour trying to catch rabbits,” Ethan retorted, noting Adam's displeased expression with a hint of amusement.

Before Adam could shoot back, he sensed something unusual and pressed himself against the wall, blending into the shadows. Ethan, equally perceptive, mirrored his movements, quieting down.

In the distance, two men of medium build were peering around, moving quickly. Each carried a blue flatbed cart but were trying to pretend they were walking normally, frequently glancing back, which gave them away.

Adam mimicked Ethan's stance, crossing his arms and watching as the two men pried open a door. Realizing they had a key, Adam understood why the old steward had mentioned discrepancies in the accounts but could not find any clues.

It dawned on Adam that they had a traitor in their midst—likely someone from within. He just didn’t know who it was.

Ethan observed Adam's calm demeanor and her intent to film. A smile crept onto his lips as he wondered how she'd react to this unexpected turn of events. He had been at the End Times Fortress for nearly a month, training the Smith family's youth with Mike in the training grounds, and sharing tips on dealing with zombies. They hadn’t gone on a single mission since the base had ample supplies and had no need to venture out.

Tonight was a coincidence; after practicing with the knife all evening, he overheard a brief conversation mentioning Adam's name, which inexplicably drew him here.

As Adam saw one of the men dragging a box of supplies out while the other struggled with the cart, she decided it was time to confront them. Collecting enough evidence on camera, she put her phone away and strode purposefully toward the two men.

Ethan had initially thought Adam was recording to complain to the Smith elders, but to his surprise, she was going in guns blazing.

He quickly followed, concerned for her safety as she approached the two thieves unarmed.

One of the men, wheezing as he dragged the supplies, and the other trying to lock the door, were too out of breath to notice Adam's unmistakable footsteps.

“Hey, what are you doing out here at this hour?” Adam’s voice cut through the night, icy and filled with intent.

Both men turned simultaneously, and Ethan could almost hear their necks cracking from the surprise.

“L-Lewis... Miss Lewis,” they stuttered, instantly panicking. One of them reacted quickly, bolting in the opposite direction.

Adam had anticipated this; she lunged forward, delivering a kick to the back of the fleeing man.

With a thud, he hit the ground, and Ethan winced at the sound—she really knew how to pack a punch.

“What’s the rush? You’ve worked so hard to steal all this stuff; are you really just going to leave?”

“Lewis... Miss Lewis, I’m sorry! Please let me go! I...”

The other man, trembling and weak-kneed, fell to his knees, begging for mercy.

This woman was no helpless damsel; Adam had a reputation for being ruthless during missions, and they had seen it firsthand in her videos portraying her skills at dispatching zombies.

“Let you go? Maybe, but you need to come clean first. If you cooperate, you’ll be treated leniently; resist, and it won’t be pretty,” Adam stated, applying pressure on the man’s foot without a hint of mercy.

Ethan considered himself her “muscle” at this moment. He stepped forward, adding his weight to the restrained man, gesturing for her to continue.

Satisfied with his cooperation, Adam moved closer to the kneeling man, leaning over with a cold smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

She swung her arm and delivered two resounding slaps before she could even speak.

“What were you doing over there?”

Just then, the patrol team passed by, led by the third Smith brother, who had diverted from their usual route upon hearing the commotion.

“Perfect timing! Brother Smith, take a look at these two. Do you recognize them?” Adam greeted him as she stood upright.

The third Smith brother stepped forward, shining his flashlight on them. “Smith Wuming, why are you kneeling here? What’s going on?”

Confused, he turned to Adam for an explanation. “These two are from the Smith family’s fifth branch.”

Adam nodded, indicating they were related but distant relatives. Before the apocalypse, the main family had staged a drama, making the various branches act out their roles, leading them to scatter after leaving the old residence. The fifth branch had ended up living with these relatives.

When the apocalypse struck, to help their relatives, they had brought them into the End Times Fortress.

The fifth branch included Jack and Luke; only the direct male heirs of the main family had to follow the family hierarchy, while the girls were only addressed by their names.

This particular relative was of the uncle generation, and Adam found it ridiculous that they would dare to steal from her.

Adam instructed the kneeling Smith Wuming to confess what he had done. Seeing that the patrol team was mainly Smith family members, Smith Wuming stood up instead.

“Confess to what? My brother and I were just passing by when we caught sight of someone sneaking into the warehouse to steal supplies. We tried to stop them, but you attacked us, and now my brother is hurt and we don’t even know where he is!”

Adam scoffed, unable to believe his ears. She stepped forward, delivering another deafening slap.

“Smack!” The sound echoed in the night, loud and clear.
