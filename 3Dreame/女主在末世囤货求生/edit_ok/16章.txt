**Just a Quick Recon**

The bodyguard accompanying Ivy off the plane felt a bit puzzled. During this trip abroad, he hadn't quite found his footing. Could it be that Ivy had left her weapon back in the desert kingdom?

Once they breezed through security, that was the only conclusion he could draw.

That was a relief; the weapon was too dangerous. It was better that Ivy had other means to protect herself.

If Ivy could hear the bodyguard's thoughts, she'd probably find it both amusing and a bit frustrating. She absolutely had to keep her unique abilities a secret, at least until others like her arrived.

The only reason she kept him close was due to her past life, where this bodyguard had sacrificed himself to protect her.

Such a person, willing to give everything for her safety, was someone Ivy would never need to worry about. She knew he had been by her side for many years, facing countless threats and temptations without ever wavering. That loyalty was more than enough for her.

Returning to the old mansion, Ivy shed the weariness that clung to her. This was her true home.

She decided not to head to the office today, choosing instead to stay at the mansion. There were plans to be made, and some of her assets needed attention. Although she had only recently been given a second chance at life, who knew if her presence would trigger any unexpected changes?

Early preparations were the way to go; only what she held in her hands was truly secure. Everything else could change.

Ivy had always believed this. She turned down several invitations from friends for a night out, simply stating she needed to adjust to the time difference. She had already tidied up her personal assets, even recovering a significant sum from the old estate.

In her study, a stack of joint venture assets lay before her, and Ivy pondered how to inform her family about the heirlooms left by her grandfather without sounding irrational.

It was a headache. After her rebirth, she felt her mental capacity had diminished. She could show off her cleverness among her peers, but the people she was up against now were cunning—each one a seasoned strategist. The moment she made a move, they’d know exactly what she intended. If she slipped up, it could lead to major trouble.

Since no brilliant ideas were coming to her, she decided to clear her mind by meditating in her private space. During her time in the desert kingdom, while she was busy collecting resources, she had sensed something just before her mental energy ran out. It had been too intense then to focus, but now she wanted to recapture that feeling.

As she meditated, the outside world transitioned into night. The old caretaker, knowing Ivy was adjusting to the time difference, realized that sleeping too long was not ideal. It could easily lead to a disrupted day-night cycle. After knocking on her door and receiving no response, the caretaker felt puzzled.

Suddenly, Ivy emerged from her private space, pretending to come out from the bathroom. The caretaker inquired if she needed dinner. Rubbing her stomach, which hadn’t seen much food all day, she nodded and said, “I’d love some of Aunt Li’s crab soup dumplings.”

The caretaker smiled warmly, “Of course! Aunt Li prepared them early, and they’re ready whenever you are.”

After changing into something more comfortable, Ivy headed downstairs just as the crab soup dumplings came out steaming hot.

Delicious! Ivy thought about how wonderful it would be to take the old mansion and all its comforts with her.

Her eating slowed as that thought crossed her mind. Maybe… she should find a time to try it?

She quickly dismissed the idea as fanciful and polished off Aunt Li’s crab soup dumplings, truly grateful for them.

After eating, she prepared to head out. First, she found her assistant to arrange a discreet car with unfamiliar license plates. Then, following her memory, she set off toward the location where the Dingjin Wine was exposed.

Dressed in a low-key manner, she changed into a jacket and put on a baseball cap. She also applied a darker foundation on her face, neck, and hands, using makeup skills to make her appearance more ordinary.

This time, she was just scouting the area, assessing the local environment and security to plan her next steps. As the car exited the city and headed toward the western suburbs, she placed her small handgun in an accessible spot, having practiced drawing it quickly.

Ideally, she wouldn't have to use it; after all, the apocalypse was only 25 days away. This period wasn’t too long or too short, and if she exposed herself, all her plans would go up in smoke.

With a cautious mindset, Ivy turned off the car lights two miles from her destination, creeping closer at a snail's pace. She parked in the shadow of a hillside about five hundred yards from her target, leaving the car unlocked with the keys removed and the handbrake engaged.

Every step was taken to avoid detection.

Ever since she learned to read energies and enhanced her mental capacity, her senses had sharpened significantly. In this hushed environment, she could feel the flow of air and the sound of the wind to gauge her surroundings.

Little did she know, the Fu family had hidden their stash of treasures in an abandoned temple in the suburbs. With no visitors to the temple and the monks gone, it was quite different from those built on hillsides or mountain tops. This small, dilapidated temple only had a single prayer hall and a small courtyard, surrounded by trees and rocks, with the nearest village several miles away. Its abandonment made perfect sense.

It had to be said that Fu was quite adept at hiding; even if someone did come by occasionally, it wouldn’t attract attention. Along the way, there were no surveillance cameras, making it easy and safe to conceal and cover up.

Unfortunately, her energy-reading abilities and mental strength weren’t strong enough; she couldn’t pick up anything from five hundred yards away. She needed to get closer, a lot closer. Moving stealthily through the shadows of the trees, Ivy was concerned about the bright moonlight revealing her position.

This time, she was only here to scout, and she truly didn’t want to be exposed.

At a hundred yards away, it took her nearly half an hour to close the distance, testing the effective range of her energy-reading technique.

As she inched forward, channeling her energy-reading ability, she felt a strong intuition urging her to press on just a little further.

But as fate would have it, the moment she stepped out of the shadows of the trees, exposing half her body, she spotted a car speeding toward her from afar. It was completely different from her cautious approach. The other vehicle had its high and low beams on, illuminating the area like it was daytime.

Startled, Ivy quickly ducked behind a larger tree, using its trunk to shield her form. Fortunately, her slender build helped her remain concealed; otherwise, she would have been completely exposed.

The other car, boldly playing DJ dance music, created a stark contrast to the quiet of the night. Ivy’s heart raced faster and faster, her pulse pounding in her chest. It was thrilling—her little heart could hardly take it.

Not daring to peek at who it was, she held her breath, waiting to see who would step out of the vehicle and what their intentions were.

Before long, the driver indeed parked, turned off the music, and got out. Ivy couldn’t risk peeking out but relied on her mental strength and heightened senses to listen closely to the other person’s actions.

The person opened the trunk and pulled out something heavy, their footsteps shifting from light and rhythmic to heavy and unsteady. It sounded like they pushed open the dilapidated wooden door of the temple, and their breathing became more pronounced.

Only after they entered did Ivy dare to peek out. Sure enough, the person had gone inside, carrying a black duffel bag that they were gripping tightly.

Ivy felt a sense of realization. That could only be…

Her thoughts drifted back to her past life, recalling the drunken state of that person. The environment flooded her with a growing sense of anger.

Suddenly, a loud shout broke the stillness of the night, echoing in the darkness.

“Who’s there?! Come out!”
