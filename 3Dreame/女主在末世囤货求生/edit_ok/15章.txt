**Shifting the Balance of Oil**

Lily Bennett accepted the gift from the supplier with a bright smile, conveying her appreciation and promising to bring a gift in return on her next visit. The atmosphere was lively, but before the Saudi negotiator could suggest dinner, James chimed in, mentioning prior commitments and suggesting they catch up next time.

Both parties were eager to proceed. As they watched the visitors drive away, the Saudi negotiator briskly instructed the factory to speed up production. This client was a major player, and this was just the start. More orders were anticipated, as even ammunition equates to wealth.

He couldn't help but be in awe of the economic power in play, his eyes reflecting a longing for the prosperity it promised.

Back at the Seaside Hotel, Lily found it inconvenient to discuss matters outside. But with her mission for the trip accomplished, she felt relief. As they ordered their meals, she handed her phone to James, asking for his help in offloading a European castle.

James glanced at her and agreed without a second thought. After a few calls, he secured the castle's sale price, finalizing the deal in under thirty minutes.

Lily knew that managing the castle overseas was a challenge, so Chris's efficiency was a pleasant surprise. The high commission was well-deserved after facilitating three significant deals in one day. The buyer, from European royalty, had long been interested in the castle. With both parties eager, they swiftly signed electronic contracts. By ten that evening, the transaction was complete, with money and goods exchanged.

Lily had expected a slew of bureaucratic hurdles from European authorities, but it turned out that power and status could clear any path. Reflecting on the situation, she regretted missing out on the castle's vineyard wines. James simply nodded in agreement.

They stayed at the hotel until nearly 1 AM. James received a call indicating the oil was ready. They drove to the port, where James helped Lily inspect the goods.

Dozens of massive oil drums were filled with the oil Lily had purchased. The quoted price included shipping, and the cargo ship was ready to sail, though customs clearance might take longer.

The cargo ship had to load and unload goods along its route to remain profitable; the oil was just a part of the operation. To prevent friction, the oil was stored separately from other cargo containers.

On the ship's distant deck, containers were being unloaded. Once James confirmed everything was in order, Lily paid the full amount but insisted on inspecting the oil storage herself.

Aware of the unique markings associated with the Bennett family, James obliged and accompanied her to the ship's cargo hold.

Lily expressed her desire to label each oil drum. The crew complied, recognizing the importance of this business deal.

Focusing her energy, Lily began transferring large quantities of oil from the drums into her space, leaving only two massive drums untouched at the warehouse door. Before arriving in Saudi Arabia, she had her assistant order several empty oil drums, intending to buy small amounts of oil abroad over time. To her surprise, they proved useful much sooner than expected.

Feigning a phone call inside the storage area, she engaged in light-hearted conversation while discreetly channeling her energy to transfer the oil. The task was demanding; the volume required intense concentration. She couldn't afford to pause and meditate publicly, so she urged herself to persist.

After intermittently draining the two oil drums, she pretended to finish her call and stepped back. Seizing the moment when no one was watching, she slipped into her space for a brief meditation, cycling her energy a few times. Not daring to linger, she wiped the cold sweat from her brow and walked out of the warehouse with ease.

The operation took no more than half an hour, and everyone believed she had been on the phone for nearly twenty minutes. She insisted on locking the warehouse door herself, taking the key to hand over to the recipient upon her return.

These were standard procedures, and no one objected. The transaction went smoothly, with payment promptly received. The operation's third-in-command warmly sent them off, and they parted ways, each returning to their endeavors.

Lily's mission in Saudi Arabia was a success. After James dropped her back at the Seaside Hotel, he mentioned that the commission would be settled in ten days. Although both the castle and oil deals were successful, real profits awaited in upcoming arms transactions.

Lily was more than pleased. While her account balance was ample, settling the arms deal would leave her short on funds for other necessities. She still needed to stock up on solar panels, generators, and livestock meat, as well as seeds for fruits and vegetables.

And then there were the handcrafted knives and swords she long coveted, requiring significant expenditures. Even with her wealth, Lily couldn't help but feel a pinch. She’d have to return home and liquidate some family assets.

At 2 AM, after tidying up, Lily reclined on a hotel balcony lounge chair. After a brief nap in her space, she returned to review her checklist of supplies. Watching the completed items grow was immensely satisfying.

It was more than shopping joy; it was about standing against adversity. If life wouldn't leave her a way out, she'd carve her own path.

What couldn’t kill her would only make her stronger.

Lily collected the list and felt the weight of the beautiful handgun gifted by the Saudi negotiator. It was exquisite, glimmering in the night. The body was pure black, cold to the touch, crafted to maintain a matte finish perfect for stealth.

She had already decided who would receive this gift once home, but first, she had an urgent task to tackle.

This was something she had planned long in advance. A smirk crept onto her lips, ambiguous between mockery and disdain. Such an expression had never graced her face before. If she were to look in a mirror now, she would feel like a stranger.

Just days after her rebirth, her mindset, mentality, and heart had undergone a complete transformation. Past experiences were unforgettable, nor did she wish to forget. Her parents still awaited justice, and those who wronged her must be stripped of everything and crushed beneath her feet.

Downing her glass of red wine, she stood up and instructed her assistant to book a flight back home. She decided to cut her trip short, feeling quite pleased with herself.

Awakened by her call, her assistant jumped out of bed, ready to embrace another day as a diligent worker.
