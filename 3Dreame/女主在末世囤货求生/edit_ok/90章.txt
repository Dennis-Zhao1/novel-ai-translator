New Chapter

David murmured, “Change? How do we change?”

Alex understood the weight of the series of blows David had endured. He felt utterly disheartened. In her mind, she already had a plan for the future development of their stronghold in this apocalyptic world. To survive, they needed to strengthen their capabilities, making it impossible for others to shake them, to dare to act recklessly, and to possess the power to crush anyone who opposed them.

“There are ways, but right now, the priority isn't that. It will take time for the Riverton base to react, and they won't be back anytime soon. We have time to strategize,” Alex reassured him, genuinely not wanting David to sink into despair. The confession obtained from yesterday's interrogation was now in the hands of the Smith brothers. When they learned that the old master Smith had been poisoned, their rage flared, veins bulging in fury.

Before long, the entire Smith family was aware of the situation, and their hatred for the traitorous side branches reached a boiling point. They believed those traitors deserved a far worse fate and were still unsatisfied, thirsting for revenge.

They reorganized the internal structure of the stronghold, mixing their own team with the Smith family members. After everyone took their positions, the funeral for the old master Smith was held. Before the apocalypse, he had anticipated his demise, knowing he had reached the end of his life. According to custom, he had prepared everything in advance, so the funeral was conducted with a semblance of formality. After the fire, his ashes were carried by the Smith brothers to be buried in the back mountain.

The Smith family was well aware that this was all a scheme by the Riverton base, and though the side branches had been wiped out, the mastermind, Ethan Craig, was still alive. This time, the Smith family and Alex had a common enemy. Even more frenzied was Jack, who forcefully barged into the office. Upon learning the full story, his hatred for Ethan Craig reached its peak—this was a vendetta that could not be forgiven, a matter of killing a father and a son.

When David sought out Alex for a private conversation, she knew what he wanted to discuss and quietly waited for him to speak.

“Alex, the weapons in the armory and the black box, are they in your possession?”

Alex nodded. “Those things can't fall into their hands; otherwise, it would be even more uncontrollable.”

David nodded in agreement, then asked, “So you discovered their plan long ago?”

Alex chuckled softly, looking steadily at David. “Didn’t you notice? From the beginning, the fifth branch was stealing my supplies and selling our laboratory results. I’ve warned you more than once, but what good did it do?”

David fell silent, feeling utterly defeated, no trace of the assertive businessman he once was before the apocalypse.

“You all place too much importance on family ties. I used to too, but facts have proven that not everyone is worth it.”

David understood what she meant by “not worth it” and did not argue further. Was he to blame Alex for not taking action? She had put her heart on the line and been hurt countless times; even after multiple warnings, she resorted to making deals, yet nothing worked.

Was it the side branches he blamed? In this apocalyptic world, the dark side of humanity had been laid bare, so starkly exposed yet still ignored by him. In the end, he could only blame himself for being too naïve, for assuming too much, which cost him his father and caused his older brother to lose his child.

The price for this realization was too high, and David’s mood plummeted. Alex had no desire to sympathize with his regrets, nor would she shoulder the blame that wasn’t hers.

She had managed to relocate the weapons and the black box just in time when the side branches made their move, but that didn’t mean she was obligated to step up. The Smith family's rules dictated that outsiders shouldn’t interfere, and not one person had sought her help.

In the end, all that resulted was a lesson paid for with old master Smith's life, and she learned her lesson through the chill in her heart. She had misplaced her own position before, but now she had set it right. It wasn’t too late.

One day, a radio broadcast that looped nationwide could be received.

“The Apocalypse Stronghold is recruiting ability users. Each ability user can bring two ordinary survivor family members. The stronghold provides housing, arranges jobs for families, and offers abundant living supplies. Address: XXX.”

From that day on, the leader of the Apocalypse Stronghold became known to the world—she was Alex.

Michael frequently led teams to rescue ability users and their families coming from all over the country after that day. Alex held down the fort, with Megan’s girlfriend, Lisa, utilizing her strengths from before the apocalypse to become her secretary, specifically handling human resources. Who wouldn’t praise her as a chosen worker?

Megan had already combined the supplies he had collected from outside with those stored by the Smith family and had filled up the warehouses. Alex even made sure to supplement some more, gazing at the three fully stocked warehouses. This wasn’t just about supplies; it represented the confidence that ability users had in the Apocalypse Stronghold.

Ordinary survivors also responded to the broadcast and came to join them. Alex didn’t refuse them; however, due to the demand for dormitory space, all ordinary people were assigned to live in houses built by earth-element ability users on the outskirts of the stronghold.

The Smith family no longer held any privileges; ability users had to undertake tasks to earn supplies, while ordinary people participated in labor to earn points.

Even if there were grievances, no one dared to act out in front of Alex. Everyone obediently complied, and only those staying with ability users could maintain their previous lifestyle.

The laboratory guards had been readjusted, prohibiting unauthorized personnel from entering or leaving freely, and no documents were allowed to be removed from the lab.

Many ordinary people felt satisfied once they moved into the stronghold; in comparison to the outside, it was significantly safer. They could use points to eat in the cafeteria, where meals included meat, vegetables, and soup, and they could purchase daily necessities at the stronghold's supermarket. Life was considerably better.

Alex even encouraged bartering—trading goods for goods, striving to generate revenue.

The armory and the black box remained in Alex’s possession. Since their private conversation, David had been in a funk for a long time, so much so that Sam couldn’t stand it any longer and took him out for a drink. The next day, David approached Alex, his face haggard from hangover, but his eyes sparkled with renewed vigor.

Alex felt a sense of relief; she didn’t need a partner who was wallowing in despair.

David returned to managing ordinary survivors, assigning them suitable positions.

Lisa was the happiest of all. Recently, over a hundred people had arrived at the Apocalypse Stronghold, most of whom were ordinary folks. She was overwhelmed with work, but thankfully, David stepped in to help relieve some of her burdens.

All ability users were managed by Megan. He evaluated their abilities and personalities and chose six team leaders, each leading five people for training.

These ability users were assigned based on their powers, and those who knew each other could form their own teams; ultimately, they all needed to go out on missions.

Alex had grown accustomed to Michael and his team being away for ten days or half a month. David hinted whether they should be wary of Michael.

However, she believed that with his capabilities, he could go to any base he wanted, but he remained in the Apocalypse Stronghold for a reason. As long as he didn’t do anything detrimental to her interests, she could turn a blind eye.

It would be impossible not to keep an eye on him at all; up to now, Michael and his team had not done anything to betray her.

They all carried secrets, and with secrets comes the desire to keep them hidden. This uneasy cooperation, built on shared enemies, was far more reassuring than other relationships.

When Megan finally trained the ability users to the point they could be deployed, Michael returned. This time, he didn’t bring back any ability users but a huge batch of crystal cores.

That night in Alex’s office, after Michael, Megan, Sam, and others settled in, Michael pulled out a bag of crystal cores from his backpack, his expression grave.

Alex looked at him in confusion; the quality of the crystal cores was excellent, with hardly any low-level cores left, all were attribute cores.

Then it hit her, and her expression shifted from joy to seriousness.

This left Megan and Sam dumbfounded; was this world of ability users something they couldn’t even begin to comprehend?

Why weren’t they happy about such high-quality crystal cores?

It was Alex who broke the silence and explained, “The level of the zombies has increased, so the quality of the crystal cores has also risen. This means the outside world is getting more dangerous.”

Only then did Megan and Sam nod in understanding. Yes, stronger zombies would be harder to kill.

“We need to hasten our upgrade, or one day, when the zombies attack the city, we won’t be able to hold out,” Michael said, causing everyone’s hearts to race. The zombies attacking the city? Was that really a possibility?

Alex recalled her memories from her past life, where she had witnessed a city assault by zombies. Had things accelerated so much?

From the day the outbreak began, it seemed everything was coming at them faster and faster, like a clock that had been artificially sped up. Who was turning the hands of time?
