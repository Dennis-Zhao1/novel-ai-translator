**Survival in the Post-Apocalyptic Fortress**

As the world outside plunged into chaos, only a handful of families had made their way back to the fortress. Among them, Ivy and her companions were all accounted for. The Smith family, Mrs. Johnson, the old caretaker, and a few guards from the ancestral home stood watchfully on the perimeter. When the old caretaker saw Ivy unharmed, his shoulders relaxed in relief.

Mr. Thompson signaled for Ivy to play the video she had saved earlier. She projected it onto the large screen in the office, and as it played, gasps echoed through the room. What had the world come to? By the video's end, the Smith family looked as if they'd seen ghosts.

The younger Thompsons had already whispered the word "zombie," while the older members stood frozen, grappling with the shocking reality. Mr. Thompson addressed everyone firmly, “The world outside is in turmoil. Our resources are limited, and our best chance of survival is here, in these secluded mountains. From now on, we must stay put, and each of us will have responsibilities. Once everyone arrives, tasks will be assigned.”

The Thompson family was used to following Mr. Thompson’s guidance without question. Ivy’s group felt the same; the elders from the ancestral home remained loyal and dutiful, while the Smith family placed their trust in the wisdom passed down through generations. Doubt had no place here; cooperation and obedience were vital for survival.

The Smith family's task was clear: sharpen all the Longquan swords. Ivy had ensured they had everything they needed, and with their hands busy, the Smith family quickly settled into their new routine.

Regaining her composure, Ivy felt disappointed with her earlier shock at the zombie outbreak. She expressed to Mr. Thompson and Uncle Tom that, along with regular duties and checkpoints, everyone—regardless of age or gender—needed training. The fortress might be safe now, but preparation was crucial; everyone should be capable of defending against zombies.

Uncle Tom agreed wholeheartedly. "It's better to have the skills and not need them than to need them and not have them."

Thus, Mark, who had a background in the military, was appointed as the chief instructor. His job: teach everyone combat techniques.

Ivy and Mark discussed zombie characteristics and devised a comprehensive training program. The younger Thompsons found surprisingly useful references in movies and TV shows.

The techniques focused on simplicity: targeting the head and avoiding scratches or bites. Everyone returning to the fortress was thoroughly checked at entry points; no injury went unexamined, and the injured were isolated for observation.

Mark, with his military background, was not only an exceptional bodyguard but also a strict instructor. He had trained many recruits and didn’t expect miracles from the novices.

His lesson plans were practical, ensuring training didn’t disrupt the fortress's daily operations. Every day included courses on physical fitness, combat skills, and reaction improvement. Techniques were adapted to suit each participant's abilities, helping them conserve energy while effectively dealing with zombies.

Ivy had always recognized Mark's talent; otherwise, Mr. Thompson wouldn't have taken him under his wing. Seeing his detailed and rational plans filled her with pride, but that was a thought for later.

Dissatisfied with herself, Ivy trained not only during designated times but also continued her regimen in her private space. At the training grounds, she honed her techniques and reaction times; in her space, she pushed her stamina, training until exhaustion.

Within days, her physique became more defined, with hints of abs starting to form.

Mark noticed Ivy's exceptional talent. Her reaction speed had improved significantly in a short time, and she had mastered combat techniques well. She was becoming more agile and strong. Although he admired the Longquan sword she wielded, she promised him a selection to choose from.

Excited, Mark began developing sword techniques for fighting zombies, confident he could train a capable team.

Mr. Thompson was the only one not required to participate in training; he walked the perimeter of the training ground daily.

The fortress buzzed with newfound energy.

On the fifth day at the fortress, the world outside was in a state of complete chaos. That night, zombies spread rapidly—not just locally but globally. News reports flooded in at midnight, describing how a rabies-like virus was attacking humans. Ivy's posts were deleted simply because she mentioned "zombie," and her official account for the Thompson Group was stripped of posting privileges.

Her personal account faced the same fate; any posts were immediately banned, halting all communication. The Thompsons felt secure in their safety but were troubled knowing that others might perish due to ignorance.

Initially, the government responded actively, attempting to control the “rabies” spread. Hospitals became overwhelmed, and soon chaos engulfed them, along with police stations. As essential services crumbled, the situation spiraled out of control.

During the first few days, phones still worked, and Ivy watched as her colleagues gathered with their families, urging them to stockpile food and water, and secure their homes. They expressed gratitude for her timely warning to take a break, showing concern for her safety. Seeing some were low on supplies, Ivy encouraged them to stock up more and even sent out incentives to motivate them to meet their needs. Once the outbreak began and communication was cut, Ivy felt helpless, headaches setting in.

One morning, Uncle Tom approached her, worried that Lisa Thompson's family hadn’t returned to the fortress. Lisa was Mr. Thompson's niece, and her brothers and mother were unreachable.

On the night they were notified, Mr. Thompson's family was in a critical research phase at their biological lab. Fearing the outbreak would hit on the 20th, they delayed, thinking they had time. Now, they were stranded, unable to return. The lab area was overrun, and employees downstairs had turned into zombies.

The only good news was that the family was safe with the lab team, but their supplies were dwindling. After five days in the lab, with over ten people, their stockpile was nearly gone.

Now, Ivy and the strong members of the Thompson family, particularly those who excelled in training, had to form a rescue team to bring back Mr. Thompson's family. An Min, sharp-witted and physically capable, was included as well.

Concerned for her sister’s safety, Ivy gathered Mark, the Thompson members, and An Min—eight in total—to devise a rescue plan at the training grounds.

With her established position in both the Thompson family and the fortress, everyone understood that the fortress was as much the Smith family's as it was the Thomspons'. Mr. Thompson respected Ivy's opinions, often deferring to her plans.

The Thompson family had few daughters; besides the adult Lisa, the others were quite young, the oldest just entering middle school.

The mission was significant; in addition to an armored vehicle, they needed a tourist bus. Fortunately, Mark had all the necessary licenses and could drive any vehicle. The Smith family had sharpened the Longquan swords, now distributed to everyone; those with the strength could handle them effectively.

Things hadn’t reached the point of needing firearms, and both Ivy and Mr. Thompson agreed it was best not to reveal their biggest trump card yet.

Once plans were finalized, Mark checked everyone’s walkie-talkies and gear. Each person donned protective gear for their arms and legs, items Ivy had stockpiled earlier. Lightweight yet sturdy, they were designed to protect against zombie bites. The group split into two teams and swiftly made their way to the parking lot to retrieve the vehicles.
