**Turning Back with Confidence**

Next on the agenda was to locate Frank Brooks. With their proximity now so close, it would be a waste of an opportunity not to give him a little surprise. Typically, he would be holed up at the Greenleaf base, but now was the perfect time to strike.

On the way, I caught sight of a lone thug, and upon closer inspection, I recognized him as that blond-haired punk from earlier, the one who had snatched my snack.

I had already changed into a new outfit, donning a black mask and a hoodie, and pressed my gun against his lower back, demanding to know Frank's whereabouts.

The punk was trembling, his legs practically giving out as he stuttered that Frank was in the main building. It made sense; there were many important figures related to Frank Brooks in the main building, especially after the recent explosion. He would surely go there.

After giving the punk a warning shot, I had effectively played a distraction game with the people at Greenleaf base. Just as the main building fell silent, an explosion erupted at the western warehouse, prompting Frank to come check things out in person.

I decided to set up an ambush on his likely path.

This route was crucial. I quickly scanned the nearby houses surrounding the western warehouse and chose the one diagonally across that had its lights on.

Some of the smaller thugs were already speeding towards the western warehouse, so I waited for them to pass before slipping into the target house.

Climbing through a side window on the first floor, I was immediately met with the sound of a woman sobbing and some unspeakable noises.

A man was laughing sinisterly, spouting vulgarities that were unbearable to hear.

With my keen hearing, I determined that the sounds were coming from the basement.

My brows furrowed. Logic told me not to waste time here, but I couldn’t shake the image of my former self, weak and helpless. If only someone had come to help me back then...

Shaking off those distracting thoughts, I focused, my resolve hardening.

I hadn’t planned on intervening, but the man’s voice sounded familiar—someone I knew.

My mental acuity picked up on just two people downstairs, both armed with guns, and I crept towards the basement.

Gently pushing open the door to the basement, I was met with dim lighting, but it didn’t hinder my vision. I moved cautiously, making no sound.

The stairs were short, and soon I had a clear view of the basement scene.

A woman, disheveled and completely naked, was hanging from chains, her feet suspended in the air, her body marked with injuries. The stark contrast of her pale skin against the blood was almost blinding.

On the floor lay another woman, soaked in blood, sprawled out and likely dead, a large pool of crimson surrounding her.

The walls were lined with various torture instruments—it was clear this was a playground for sadists.

On the other side, a man wearing only a shirt and vest, completely bare from the waist down, was turned away from the door, holding a glass of red wine, tipping his head back to drink.

I recognized him immediately—it was Larry Mann, that lecherous scumbag from the Mann family who had caused me trouble before.

Time for some payback. Without hesitation, I fired a shot straight to his head.

The silenced gunshot echoed, and he collapsed to the floor. The moment the woman hanging up heard the noise, she lifted her head, her eyes wide with despair as she saw a masked figure with a gun standing on the stairs.

I didn’t want to waste any more time. I shot at the chains to free her, ensuring they broke before dashing back upstairs.

The moment she saw the gun aimed at her, she squeezed her eyes shut, fearing for her life. She never realized that the masked figure was there to save her, and after two gunshots, she fell to the ground, barely aware of her miraculous escape.

I sprinted to the rooftop of the house, where I had a clear view of the entrance to the western warehouse below.

The explosions and fire had drawn a crowd, mostly a bunch of flashy thugs whose demeanor was all too obvious. Among them were some with a more serious air, similar to that of Mr. Smith, though still carrying a grimy aura. There were also others whose identities were unclear, most dressed in suits, being escorted away from the fire scene by Logan's men.

Amidst the chaos, I pulled out my sniper rifle and carefully scanned the crowd for Frank Brooks.

Before long, I locked onto the target—the very man I had vowed to make pay.

He looked just like I remembered, charming and suave, but beneath that facade lay a grotesque, bloodthirsty soul.

Without a moment's hesitation, I aimed at his temple and pulled the trigger. Ever since I had missed that shot on David Johnson, I had practiced daily with targets in my space; this time, I was filled with confidence.

I quickly switched to a light machine gun and began firing indiscriminately into the crowd below. Panic erupted as people scrambled for cover, all of them Frank Brooks’ lackeys—each one of them deserved to die.

An exhilarating rush surged through me, a wicked smile creeping onto my lips as I watched them scatter, some falling dead while others fled in terror. It was exhilarating.

I emptied an entire magazine without looking back, knowing I had to escape before anyone realized who was shooting.

I stowed my weapon and made my way downstairs, sensing the commotion around me and moving swiftly.

My heart raced with excitement and satisfaction; I had finally killed that bastard and his minions. It felt like a true victory—killing one was enough, but two made it so much sweeter.

The dark cloud that had loomed over me lifted instantly, as if I were releasing all my pent-up frustrations through every pore.

My feet barely touched the ground as I utilized the low lighting of the Greenleaf base to evade capture, slipping past wave after wave of pursuers without them ever catching a glimpse of me.

I even planted explosives along the corners of the houses I passed, not only to distract but also to take out a few more of Frank Brooks' men as collateral damage.

In less than ten minutes, I had circled around to the eastern row of houses.

When I first arrived, I had noted that the back of the row was enclosed by a wall that had been raised to three meters, topped with thorny barbed wire to deter climbers.

Remembering that I had some protective gear stored in my space, I knew I could easily scale the wall unarmed. Once I got over, I could make a quick getaway in my car.

Making up my mind, I ran while activating the detonator, the explosions behind me causing chaos in the Greenleaf base.

I quickly rounded the row of houses; the wall was right in front of me when I spotted a patrol car speeding toward me.

No time to waste.

I cursed under my breath at how fast those guys were. Their four wheels definitely outpaced my two legs.

Deciding quickly, I turned and dove back into the row of houses.

I picked an empty room on the first floor to hide in. The adrenaline rush from running and sensing the area had drained my strength and mental focus.

Breathing heavily, I could hear the muffled sounds of the chaos outside becoming clearer.

"Mr. Smith hasn’t given the word; you can’t search here."

Voices drifted in from outside.

"What a joke. Are there any places in Greenleaf Base that our second young master can’t go?"

It sounded like one of Frank Brooks’ lackeys.

"Unless Mr. Smith himself gives the order, no one can come in today."

Inside, I felt a flicker of hope for a fight, but I also didn’t want anyone to come searching here. I could enter my space, but getting out would be a risk that could expose me.

"Our second young master is here to search for intruders. What do you mean by stopping us?"

"What do you mean? Are you saying the intruders are here?"

"You..."

"Shut up!"

Frank snapped at his subordinate, clearly not wanting to offend Mr. Smith at this moment. He chose not to force his way in but instead decided to send someone to find Mr. Smith.

As my breathing steadied and my strength gradually returned, I planned to sneak out the window, hoping the attention remained focused on the entrance of the row of houses while I made my escape.

Just as I was about to put on my protective gear, I caught sight of a tall shadow scaling the three-meter wall, heading straight for my window.

Oh no, what terrible luck!
