**Missed Opportunity**

Ethan stood off to the side, casually scrolling through his phone while keeping an attentive ear on the escalating argument. The shouting filled the room.

“Who do you think you are playing the hero here? Do you really think you’re worthy?” Sally’s sharp tone sliced through the tension.

“Sally, why are you saying that about Zoe? She’s just trying to help,” another girl interjected, her voice laced with concern.

“Give me a break! You think she's genuinely kind? Her heart is as black as coal! You all must be blind not to see it!” Sally spat, her disdain evident as she glanced around the room with contempt.

“Don’t slander me! I’ve never done anything to hurt anyone!” Zoe, the accused girl, protested, her hands clasped tightly as if in prayer, but her defense seemed shaky.

“Slander? I saw you push Tom out as bait while you ran away. Not only that, but you locked the door behind you! Tom died a horrible death, and you don’t feel a shred of guilt?” At this revelation, all eyes turned toward Zoe.

Flustered under the scrutiny, Zoe stumbled over her words. “I didn’t push him! Tom did it to protect me…” Before she could finish, she broke into tears, looking utterly pitiful. “I’ve never hurt anyone! Why would I feel guilty? You’ve always hated how Tom and the others treated me, and now you’re slandering me!”

Her argument was so seemingly genuine that if Ivy hadn’t known what kind of person Zoe really was, she might have believed it too.

Sally was about to respond when the sound of hurried footsteps echoed from the entrance. Ivy’s heart raced with anxiety; someone had attracted the zombies. She squeezed Ethan’s arm, signaling him to stay alert.

Fortunately, they were concealed in the shadows, and as long as they didn’t expose themselves, the zombies wouldn’t find them. But the same couldn’t be said for the approaching group.

The footsteps grew louder, and three men in tactical gear sprinted into view, pursued by a horde of zombies. The dim emergency lights in the parking garage amplified the terror of the scene. The men’s teammates rushed to assist, while the remaining survivors panicked, screaming and fleeing.

Among them, four men in dress shirts seemed to be from the same company, darting away with surprising speed. The three women, perhaps trusting the soldiers’ capabilities or simply too frightened to move, huddled quietly in a corner, covering their mouths in fear.

The bickering ceased, replaced by a palpable tension as everyone wished to blend into the shadows.

Ivy noticed one tall man wielding a broadsword. With precise movements, he dispatched the zombies with a grace that starkly contrasted with their own chaotic attempts at survival. Every swing was rhythmic and controlled.

The other teams used their firearms to take down zombies, the silenced gunshots muffled yet frequent as they needed to reload after just a few shots.

Just as Ivy thought the tide was turning in their favor and prepared to confront Zoe, she noticed Zoe clinging tightly to the girl who had defended her, her eyes filled with a mix of hate and murderous intent directed at Zoe. The girl was shielding herself behind Zoe, and Ivy's grip tightened on her gun.

The leader of the men nodded at his team, instructing them to be cautious. As they prepared to take cover in the corner, he suddenly raised his weapon and shouted in their direction, “Who goes there? Step out!”

The others followed suit, guns trained on Ivy and her companions, with one of them switching on a flashlight, illuminating the dark space.

Ivy felt her teeth grind together in frustration, having missed yet another chance for justice, her throat tightening with bitterness. She quickly tucked her gun away, muttering under her breath at how alert their senses were, ruining her chance to settle the score.

Ethan was the first to stand, and Ivy and the others followed suit, their legs stiff from crouching too long.

The beam of the flashlight made it even harder to see the faces of their would-be rescuers, but Ivy noted that they were all tall and muscular, each easily over six feet.

The group that was supposed to lure the zombies had stayed back, now partially encircled. With guns aimed at them, Ivy exchanged a glance with Ethan and shrugged.

Ethan’s hand instinctively moved toward his gun at his waist, but the second-in-command barked, “Hands up! Don’t move!”

Ivy felt exasperated. She would rather fight than be treated like a suspect, having to surrender like this. It was the apocalypse, after all! What was with the old-school tactics? She shot back, “We’re survivors! What’s the deal? Are we breaking any laws here?” Her tone was sharp but held a trace of defiance.

“And who are you? The police?” the commander retorted, turning his flashlight to shine back at her.

It was clear they hadn’t expected such defiance. The others assumed they were merely a group that had hidden away in the parking garage, but the leader spoke up.

“Survivors? I’ve never seen survivors so well-armed,” he said, a skeptical look on his face, as if challenging her to come up with a better story.

Ivy’s group was indeed dressed uniformly, clearly equipped, and their calm demeanor stood in stark contrast to the panicked survivors who had fled in a hurry.

Ethan finally spoke up, citing his military unit’s number and explaining that they were looking for family members.

However, as they prepared to leave the underground parking lot, they had seen people running in and decided to hide, planning to wait until everyone else had left before making their move. It was a clear indication they hadn’t intended to confront anyone directly.

Ivy stifled a laugh internally; Ethan had picked up on her sarcasm, and now he was playing it well.

Before the second-in-command could retort, the leader called for silence, allowing Ivy to finally see his face. He was the tallest among them, his black tactical uniform adding to his imposing presence. A handgun hung neatly at his waist, and he wielded a broadsword—the very one Ivy had wanted to buy but never had the chance to.

It looked striking in his grasp, she thought.

The commander saluted Ethan and introduced himself, revealing they were a special forces unit on a mission, casually rescuing survivors along the way.

Ethan nodded, wanting to suggest that since they all had missions, they shouldn’t waste each other’s time and should split up to act swiftly.

Before he could speak, the commander continued, “You all look well-equipped. How about we team up? We can share the mission.”

Ivy felt a pang of unease. Something felt off about them. She studied the commander’s ruggedly handsome face, wondering why such a good-looking guy had to have so many hidden agendas. Now it seemed he was trying to pull her into his plans.
