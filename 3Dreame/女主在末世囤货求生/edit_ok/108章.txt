Negotiation

The tension in the air was almost palpable as two teams faced each other, their abilities on full display. Electric nets surged forward, earthen shields rose defensively, and metallic shuttles alongside icy spikes shattered upon impact. Each side matched the other's onslaught, depleting their energy in the process.

Just as another wave of skills was primed to launch, a striking woman with flowing hair raised her hand and shouted, "Hold on! You've got the wrong people!"

Her command cut through the chaos, and those surrounding Ethan reluctantly ceased their assault. Their adrenaline was still pumping, eager for action, yet her words were like a splash of cold water, quenching their fiery spirits.

Ethan, seizing the opportunity, stepped confidently from his vehicle and approached her, revealing his intentions. When she introduced herself as the leader of the End of Days Fortress, her icy demeanor melted slightly in surprise.

They entered the Longview Base smoothly. The armored vehicle needed to be parked discreetly, so after some negotiation, they agreed to keep their special abilities under wraps while securing a spot in the base's lot.

Oliver, ever cautious, insisted that Mike lock the vehicle securely, clutching the keys as if they were his most prized possession. His careful nature was nothing unusual, and the woman, Anna, thought little of it as she led them into the base.

Upon entry, they underwent a thorough check for injuries and weapons. With Ethan's spatial abilities, any potential obstacles were easily hidden. He registered his powers without hesitation, revealing himself as a Level Four Ice-type mutant. Anna was visibly astonished; their base leader was the only other person of such level, making two Level Four mutants from the End of Days Fortress an unexpected revelation.

Typically, Ethan might have downplayed his abilities, but he chose honesty over subterfuge. This transparency shifted the perception of the Longview Base members, who began to regard the End of Days Fortress with newfound respect.

Anna led them to a cozy tea room on the first floor, where she introduced herself formally, "Hi, I'm Anna, team leader of Team Three here at Longview Base. Sorry for the earlier mix-up. I hope we can move past it."

Seeing Anna's graceful apology, the group waved off the misunderstanding. They were there to foster cooperation, not conflict, so they let it slide. Anna arranged for some hot drinks and excused herself to inform the senior members, leaving the room with poise.

Despite the promising start, the meeting with Pei Qian was delayed. Ethan, ever the resourceful one, retrieved some lunch from his space pocket, and they ate while waiting. Yet, time dragged on with no update about their meeting.

Oliver, restless after the meal, began pacing the room, while the usually composed Jake sat in deep thought, arms crossed.

As the afternoon wore on, they shared some drinks, lightening the mood with a bit of friendly chatter. Finally, as the clock ticked towards three, Anna returned, apologizing profusely.

"I'm really sorry for the delay! Pei had an unexpected hold-up. You can come with me now."

Despite her apologies, Ethan remained calm, his demeanor warm as he reassured her. The others felt a bit awkward, their patience tested, but they followed Anna without complaint.

As they climbed the stairs—seven flights in total, since the elevator was out of commission—they saw that the base struggled to maintain even basic lighting. Torches lined the walls, a testament to the challenging post-apocalyptic conditions.

Anna explained the base's situation as they ascended, unaware of Ethan's group's true purpose. She mentioned that the seventh floor housed Pei Qian's office and reception area.

The office was modestly furnished, and through a glass partition, Ethan glimpsed a figure gazing out the window, exuding an air of authority.

Anna knocked gently and gestured for them to enter. Mike instinctively positioned himself behind Ethan, Oliver standing beside him, their presence a subtle show of strength. The rest followed suit, forming a unified front.

In the office, Pei Qian sat with a woman by his side, each flanked by a bodyguard. The setup amused Ethan, though he understood the need for caution.

Jake, familiar with Pei from a past life, found the display a tad juvenile but masked his discomfort, maintaining a stoic demeanor.

As Ethan observed Pei Qian approach, he was surprised by the man's appearance. Contrary to expectations, Pei was not the intimidating figure he had imagined. He was tall, though not as tall as Jake or Mike, with a lean build. His shirt sleeves were rolled up, revealing strong, defined arms.

Ethan's gaze lingered on Pei Qian, prompting a slight raise of Jake's eyebrow. Was Ethan intrigued by this type of leader?

Once Pei Qian settled into his seat, Anna closed the door, and silence enveloped the room, tension hanging heavy.

Ethan considered breaking the silence when Jake spoke first. "Pei, I believe you're aware of why we're here. We need a clear answer because we have what you need."

Ethan trusted Jake's lead, choosing to observe rather than intervene.

Pei Qian studied Jake intently before responding, "And what is it that you think I need?"

Jake smiled, his tone calm. "A life-saving special medicine."

Pei Qian's facade faltered, a flicker of surprise crossing his features. This was a closely guarded secret, known only to a select few. How had Jake, an outsider, come to know?

Yet, Pei maintained his composure, fingers steepled as he spoke again. "Why should I believe your medicine works?"

Jake leaned back slightly, a confident smirk on his lips. He considered a blunt response but opted for tact. "Our fortress has a biological lab; the odds of developing such a medicine are high. Besides, what do you have to lose? There's always hope."

His words struck a chord, revealing a keen emotional intelligence.

Pei Qian seemed to consider this, finally nodding. "Your request isn't difficult, and if your medicine proves effective, I won't interfere or protect him."

Ethan understood that this referred to Fu Buqi, a troublesome figure. But what was this special medicine?

Jake leaned closer to Ethan, whispering two familiar words, "Lake Water."
