**Clearing Out the Jewelry Inventory**

After finishing their meal, the atmosphere shifted as the group moved into the final phase of their meeting. The middle-aged man, now collaborating with an assistant, was deeply engrossed in calculations. They exchanged murmured numbers until finally handing over their notes to the man at the center of the room.

The central man, who had shared a pack of spicy snacks with his companion, cleaned his hands with a napkin before taking the papers. He scanned them quickly and, satisfied, eased back into his chair. "What's your price for this batch?" he inquired with a casual authority.

"The more you take, the bigger the discount," came the reply from across the room.

"I'll take it all," he decided, his tone leaving no room for doubt.

Chris, sitting nearby, raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Even the jade?" he asked, clearly taken aback.

The central man nodded, "I've recently made some connections with merchants from overseas," he explained, as if that justified his decision.

Ivy, watching the exchange, mused to herself, Is this deal sweetened by my jewelry or those spicy snacks?

Meanwhile, the middle-aged man brought over a laptop, continuing to work with his team. Ivy, feeling content after a hearty meal, began to feel sleepy. She hoped this deal would finalize the sale, sparing her another late-night trek to a different location.

Chris dialed a number, confirming they could skip their next appointment. After hanging up, he turned to Ivy, who was fighting off sleep. "Looks like the next meeting's off," he announced with a grin.

Ivy nodded, stifling a yawn with her hand. Since starting over, her life had been a whirlwind of activity. If this jewelry batch sold, she could slow down her pace, focusing on stockpiling without the frantic rush.

An hour later, the middle-aged man returned, handing Ivy two folders. Opening them, she was pleasantly surprised to find detailed price lists inside. The high-end jewelry had market references for comparison, and the prices offered were reasonable and fair.

Expecting a clearance sale where she might be shortchanged, Ivy was relieved. These items were essentially a windfall for her. She reviewed the price list carefully, marking two items she felt were undervalued and sent her suggested prices back to the central man.

He conferred briefly with the middle-aged man and nodded in agreement. This kind of buyer-offer transaction was common, and since Ivy hadn't haggled, they were quick to accept. Chris, familiar with Ivy’s business style, facilitated the exchange smoothly, with money handed over in exchange for goods, no contracts needed.

Ivy preferred to leave as few traces as possible. After confirming the payment, she left two packs of differently flavored snacks for the central man as a thank-you for the amicable transaction.

She decided to leave her rolling suitcase behind, waving casually as she and Chris headed back to their hotel.

The hotel bar was open twenty-four hours, and Ivy reserved a quiet private room. She invited Chris in, uncorking a bottle of sparkling wine to celebrate their successful deal.

Mengo stood guard outside while Chris retrieved his tablet. He was already well aware of their financial standing from previous transactions and noted this latest success. Handing it to Ivy, he asked her to verify it.

Ivy, with her sharp memory, only needed a quick glance. Nodding, she watched as Chris calculated the commission percentages, arriving at the total.

She transferred him a neat sum. The commissions from recent transactions had surpassed ten million dollars. Ivy completed the payment with a smile, and Chris grinned back, "Thanks, boss."

Ivy waved off his gratitude nonchalantly, knowing part of the funds came from various families. She planned to look into specialty products from neighboring countries for stockpiling; she wasn’t in a rush to head back home, and the thought of unused funds made her restless.

Her interactions with Chris were always easy and natural. She saw no reason to hide her stockpiling plans from him; if he asked, she would tell him the truth, unbothered by what he might think.

Pulling out a small notebook, Ivy began jotting down a list as they chatted. Australian milk, steak, kangaroo meat—perfect, she thought. Ice wine and seafood from Canada? She’d get those next. Her aim was to gather insights on the main agricultural products and cuisines of surrounding countries, hoping Chris could introduce her to suppliers. Ideally, he'd join her on her international buying spree.

Chris, having once received a cheeky response about the apocalypse, didn’t dare ask Ivy about it again. Regardless of her sanity, these events were real. So, was the apocalypse real?

Ivy ignored Chris's musings, focusing on filling her notebook. She intended to travel the globe, experiencing the world before any impending doom, and etching it into her memory.

Chris, observing Ivy’s travel plans, leveraged his extensive network to help her shape an itinerary for her global adventure. They planned a route based on her preferences, though Chris pointed out the complexity due to unpredictable supplier schedules. They’d have to stick to a single flight path.

Ivy didn’t mind; they would travel by private jet for the next two weeks, enough time to cover the countries on her list.

She wouldn’t be caught off guard on May 20th, the date of the apocalypse in her previous life. She believed her actions, like the flutter of a butterfly’s wings, would lead to different outcomes.

Thanks to her, the various families and individuals were already different from her past life. She had to trust her instincts and avoid complacency.

Ivy also booked a room for Chris. Over the next two weeks, he would accompany her everywhere, enjoying a well-deserved break while earning a handsome sum.

Back in her room, Ivy tidied up and entered her personal space. Checking on her farm animals, she was delighted to find a pile of white objects nestled in the straw where her chickens, ducks, and geese were kept.

Curious, she approached and cleared away the straw, revealing a heap of eggs. The smaller ones were likely chicken eggs, while the larger ones could be from ducks or geese—there were quite a few!

Ivy marveled at the sight, noticing none of the birds were incubating the eggs; they lay abandoned in the straw. She crouched down, picking one up and gently shaking it; it felt fresh, not spoiled.

This realization hit her: while animals in her space wouldn’t reproduce naturally, they could still lay eggs normally. Just like other items, the eggs could be preserved, a logical and reasonable phenomenon.

She wouldn’t lack protein anytime soon. As for how long her poultry would thrive in this space, she wasn’t sure. If things went awry during the apocalypse, she could always release them to reproduce. Her castle would have plenty of room, and she intended to make the most of it.
