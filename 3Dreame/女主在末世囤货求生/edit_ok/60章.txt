**Confrontation**

As a few cars pulled up, several men in sharp suits stepped out, flanked by a group of burly bodyguards wielding makeshift weapons like iron rods and clubs. This wasn't a typical day in suburbia.

Lila Bennett firmly shut the car door she had just exited, her fingers gripping the hilt of her treasured sword—a family heirloom. Among the group, she recognized Max Langston, the youngest son of the Langston family, one of the town's influential clans. The leader, however, was unfamiliar to her.

Max had a reputation for causing trouble, unlike his more responsible brothers. Known for pursuing women and stirring chaos, he often left his family to clean up his messes.

Spotting a sleek car and a stunning woman with a sleek ponytail, Max couldn't resist the urge to approach. These entitled rich kids seemed to be planning to harass Lila for some amusement.

"Isn't this the little princess of the Bennett family? Long time no see!" Max's oily voice sliced through the silence. His tired eyes and droopy eyelids hinted at a life of indulgence.

"Do I know you?" Lila replied, her brow furrowed. The way they carried themselves screamed trouble.

"Come on, don’t be like that. We're all part of the same circle here; it’s just a little sad to hear you say that," Max said, his earlier bravado slipping. He had always avoided provoking Lila before, knowing her family's wealth and influence rivaled his own.

But now, the unsettling gleam in his eyes suggested he was willing to push boundaries, making Lila wish she could erase his gaze.

Mark, her bodyguard, sensed the tension and unbuckled his seatbelt, stepping out to stand protectively behind her. The leader of the opposing group called Max over, and with her sharp hearing, Lila caught him whispering that she was an easy target.

Suppressing a laugh, Lila wondered just how easy they thought she was to bully in this post-apocalyptic world. Ming’s vigilance was reassuring; their lack of firearms suggested these guys had been cooped up for too long, itching to start trouble now that they were out.

From their demeanor, they were likely used to intimidating weaker individuals, but this time, they had picked the wrong person.

The group's leader, dressed in a perfectly tailored suit, had an air of arrogance typical of a privileged heir. In their town, few could afford to give the Langston family the star treatment, and being from a merchant family, Lila had never ventured into their elite circles.

“Miss Bennett, how about joining us for a few days at the Haven Base?” the leader suggested, his gaze appraising Lila with ill intentions. Mark clenched his fists, recognizing the sleazy undertones.

As the situation escalated, more members of their group emerged from the cars, totaling six who now stood behind Lila. The opposing group hadn’t anticipated her having such a formidable entourage.

"I'm Liam Carter, son of the Haven Base leader. My father, Michael Carter, I’m sure you’ve heard of him. It’s dangerous out here, and you, a delicate lady, must be scared. Our base is very safe, with plenty of food and entertainment. Why don’t you come with us?” he continued, his voice dripping with insincerity.

Internally, Lila scoffed, managing to maintain an amused facade. “Ah, so it’s Young Master Carter! I’ve long heard of your reputation. However, we have business to attend to and can’t accompany you,” she replied, slipping her hand into her pocket to prepare to draw her gun. In the military, being armed was standard, and surely, the Haven heir wouldn’t be foolish enough to roam without protection.

“Force her into coming with us, Liam! This woman clearly doesn’t know what’s good for her!” shouted another entitled kid, provoking his friends to move forward, ready to grab Lila.

Mark discreetly reached for his gun, poised to protect her.

With a bright smile, Lila let the midday sun illuminate her soft, delicate features, radiating warmth that could ignite the embers of courage in anyone who looked her way.

“Are you talking about this?” she asked, raising her gun and showing it to them, deftly disengaging the safety. Mark also pulled out his gun, pointing it directly at Liam, positioning himself protectively in front of Lila.

The group of young men were taken aback, shocked that she actually had a gun and dared to point it at them. Max stammered, “W-wait a minute. We can talk this out, right? I was just sincerely inviting you to our base…”

He was genuinely frightened now. Today, he had instigated this outing with the Haven heir, and spotting Lila, he thought she was familiar and attractive enough to draw them over. If anything happened to Liam, his father and brothers would surely be furious.

“Oh? So now we can talk calmly? Because from what I saw earlier, it looked like you were trying to kidnap me,” Lila taunted, shaking her gun playfully.

Just then, a military jeep rolled in from Liam's direction, stopping behind the group.

Lila recognized the man who stepped out, rolling her eyes. “At a time like this, he still has to step out in sunglasses to act cool. Please,” she thought.

It was Adam Grant, the Haven Base leader, who had heard his wayward son had snuck out and immediately dispatched his most trusted subordinate to track him down, ensuring his safety and bringing him back as soon as possible.

“Long time no see, Miss Bennett,” Adam greeted, stepping beside Liam, completely unfazed by the threatening gunpoint directed at them.

Lila’s mind flashed back to the time at the Dawn Tower when she had failed to eliminate that scheming rival; she couldn’t be bothered to even roll her eyes at him, opting to ignore him entirely.

Liam, seeing his father's most trusted aide arrive, felt his annoyance grow. He didn’t want to lose face in front of a woman, especially not with someone like Adam present. “Miss Bennett, are you deliberately asking for trouble?” he snapped.

With Adam’s arrival, he wasn’t about to let things spiral out of control. He ordered his men to seize this ungrateful woman and ensure she was taken back for a proper lesson.

Lila refused to be intimidated by such threats, casually retorting, “Just because you say so? I’m just a lonely orphan, and if you anger me, I could easily trade in a Haven heir. Who knows, I might even snag a few more aristocrats. So tell me, who do you think the real winner will be in the end? I could walk away with a clean victory.”

Laughing mischievously, she seemed to find the whole situation rather amusing.

Liam’s furious demeanor began to cool, his initial rage replaced with reason as he understood her implication.

Max, dripping with cold sweat, only wanted to get the Haven heir back safely. If anything happened to him, there would be hell to pay.

Adam looked at the girl who still shone brilliantly after months, noting that the base she lived in indeed treated her well.

For a moment, nobody spoke. Lila softened her tone, “Oh come on, don’t be so downcast, Young Master Carter. Today just isn’t the right time, but who knows? Maybe one day, I’ll pay a visit to your esteemed father at the Haven Base.”

Adam, who had initially intended to help defuse the situation, found himself taken aback by how effortlessly Lila laid out the stakes and dynamics, leaving him no room for maneuvering.
