**Special Abilities**

The morning after everyone’s awakening, Laura Benson gathered the thirty individuals for final testing in the lab before moving them to the training ground. The remnants of last night's storm were still evident, as puddles dotted the sidewalk—a subtle reminder of past trials meant to deter any reckless behavior.

In the training ground, each person showcased their special abilities one by one. Lucy Hill took diligent notes while Coach Mike, eager and ready, prepared to train these new recruits.

Two individuals were under particularly close scrutiny. The first was the ice-element user, Samantha, whom Laura had high hopes for. There were too few mutated element users among their ranks. The second was a young man named Logan from the security team, who had been on the cusp of graduating from a national defense academy just as the apocalypse struck.

Logan possessed a unique crystal core, completely transparent and unlike typical ice-element abilities, which usually bore a faint white frost. His crystal core resembled a flawless piece of synthetic crystal, devoid of any growth patterns. Earlier, Laura had tested his abilities several times before realizing that he wasn't without powers — his ability was replication. During a demonstration, she had inadvertently brushed his arm, leading him to conjure two ice spikes. Initially, they thought he was an ice-element user, but when Alex greeted him with a friendly pat on the shoulder, he exhibited wind-element abilities.

After some confusion, they discovered that as long as he made physical contact with another ability user, he could replicate their powers. However, he couldn't replicate the level of those abilities. For instance, while Laura’s ice-element could produce three ice spikes at level four, Logan could only manage two, and he quickly fatigued, his face paling as he exerted himself.

At that moment, Laura had a thought. She suggested that he publicly claim to be a metal-element user and demonstrate that while Coach Mike discreetly assisted him. However, he also had a crucial task ahead.

Initially attempting to blend in, Logan accidentally caused a ruckus by dismantling part of a window, infuriating Mr. Johnson, who chastised him for the trouble. The repairs would be a hassle, and Logan ultimately had to promise to restore everything to its original state to placate Mr. Johnson.

Aside from these two, the remaining recruits, even those with powers in three different elements, barely caught Laura's eye. Water and wood users were the most common, followed by earth and fire users, with metal users being the rarest. Excluding Logan, there were only three others — a mere ten percent awakening rate.

Dr. Brown and his assistant, Lucy, quickly calculated the ratios, excitedly proclaiming they would return to research and adjust the formulas for awakening serums. Laura was cautious, urging them not to reveal too much outside, fearing they might treat the new recruits as mere test subjects.

The ordinary people watched with bright eyes as their former peers showcased their new powers, each expressing their desire to awaken. Laura waved her hand, declaring that everyone would have the chance, except for the elderly who failed the health checks and underage children. Those who qualified would awaken in batches. This announcement set the community ablaze with excitement. Even those who had previously expressed dissent among the awakened users now felt reassured seeing that among the new awakeners, only one was a mutated element user, a little girl—hardly a threat, especially since none of the imposing security team members were mutated.

More ability users meant better chances against zombies, allowing for assistance in desperate times, increasing their survival odds — a logic everyone understood, especially after facing two zombie sieges and attacks from hostile forces.

With Coach Mike remaining to train the newcomers, Alex was assigned to the watchtower for a shift change, while Mr. Johnson had recently taken up patrol duties, promoting three of the stronger ability users to lead rotating shifts. Once most had dispersed, Laura called Logan over.

Coach Mike never questioned Laura's commands. Seeing Logan hesitating to explain himself, the impatient Coach Mike playfully nudged him with a grin, urging him to hurry along. Logan sheepishly laughed, patting the back of his head before scampering over to Laura.

Samantha glanced up and caught sight of the two departing together. Their synchronized movements sparked a mix of curiosity and something unidentifiable within her. She unconsciously clenched and then relaxed her hands, her heart racing as they walked away — something about them felt different.

As Logan followed Laura, he was unsure of where they were headed. Curiosity mingled with nerves, but he held back his questions. Laura noticed his hesitance and chuckled lightly, "We're heading to the lab. We need to test your abilities, but keep it a secret. It's so unique that I worry someone might want to exploit it for research."

Logan relaxed a bit at her teasing tone, but then again, it dawned on him that they were indeed going to a laboratory — a place typically associated with experiments and danger.

After passing through multiple layers of security, they finally arrived at the lab entrance. Once inside, Logan's nerves eased a little. If there were really bad intentions, the entrance would have been heavily guarded, and he wouldn’t have been allowed in as casually as he was.

Laura approached the lab where Dr. Brown was working, ringing the doorbell since her voice wouldn’t carry inside. Before long, Lucy's voice crackled over the intercom, "Hello, Miss Laura! Dr. Brown is currently testing a subject and will take a little while. Please come in and wait for him."

The door slid open automatically, and Laura stepped inside, beckoning Logan to follow. As it was Logan's first time in a lab, he was filled with curiosity, eager to explore every corner.

He was particularly intrigued about what kind of subjects they were working with — perhaps zombies? Thankfully, the room lacked rows of glass jars filled with organs preserved in formaldehyde, which alleviated much of his anxiety.

After a short wait, Dr. Brown hurried over, carrying a clipboard. He paused upon seeing Logan, smiling, "What's the matter? Is this young man having any issues?"

As he spoke, he flipped through the record book, recalling Logan's case. After a moment, he found it, glanced at the data, and looked back at Laura, awaiting an explanation.

"Nothing serious, just that his abilities are a bit unique, and I need to conduct a test," she replied casually.

Dr. Brown became curious, "How unique? What do you want to test?"

Laura didn’t respond immediately. Instead, she moved toward the door of the inner room, waving Logan over. Dr. Brown and Lucy leaned in, intrigued by the mystery.

Logan followed her inside, where he found a room with a large glass wall. In the center lay a hospital bed, occupied by a man connected to a breathing machine and other medical devices. The room felt eerily sparse, save for the equipment.

Laura instructed Dr. Brown to open the door, leading Logan into the room. The man on the bed was John, who had been in a deep sleep since Laura brought him back. Dr. Brown had administered a new sedative that bypassed his drug resistance.

As Logan gazed at the peaceful face of the man on the bed, his heart raced. Were they seriously conducting human experiments? Was it too late for him to run away?

"Touch John's body, anywhere is fine," Laura encouraged, her tone patient.

Still tense, Logan hesitated but ultimately complied, placing his hand on John's shoulder. In an instant, he felt a surge of energy, compelling him to raise his hand.

To his astonishment, three or four nearby machines began to levitate, floating in the air around them.
