**A Swift Snatch**

As Mr. Smith strolled past the main building, the guards at the entrance greeted him with respect. Behind him, Laura Banks observed him as he veered into a smaller house west of the main structure.

She tapped into her intuition and observational skills, allowing her to sense the energy around him. At the entrance of the house, Mr. Smith exchanged a few hurried words with someone who then quickly departed. Meanwhile, a string of ivory in Mr. Smith's hand emitted a soft, luminous glow.

Laura was taken aback—this wasn't just any ivory, but rather an ancient artifact. Her keen eye could detect the aura of treasures; the brighter and more vibrant the glow, the more potent the energy. This particular ivory bracelet would undoubtedly pique Mirror's interest.

Determined, she concealed herself and slipped into the house. Her intuition revealed more than one source of brilliance within. On the southern side of the second floor, she detected several similar glowing auras, all dazzling under her scrutiny.

This was her chance, and Laura's heart raced with excitement as she sensed Mr. Smith had ascended to the second floor. Tailing closely, she was resolute—she would seize the treasure.

By dismantling the influence of Fred Thompson, she could weaken his power and eventually strip him of everything. Realizing that Mr. Smith was in a room that wasn't the treasure's storage, she quickly made her way toward the treasure.

The house had electricity and in winter, power was primarily used for lighting and heating these core areas. However, the heating was somewhat inadequate. She swiftly entered the room storing the treasures but had to navigate the darkness without turning on any lights, which hindered her visibility. Despite her heightened senses, she still couldn't see the room's layout clearly.

Just as she was about to find a light source, she noticed the curtains were drawn back, and if she were to shine a flashlight around, the flickering light would surely alert any passersby. So, she continued to feel her way in the dark, guided by the bright auras detected by her intuition, deftly avoiding obstacles.

The house was eerily quiet. As she explored, she realized this room was a study, with bookshelves filled to capacity. She felt no dust on her fingertips, indicating the books were frequently perused.

After a thorough search, when she finally touched the box containing the treasures, she sensed Mr. Smith moving closer in her direction. There was no time to examine the contents of the box; she quickly stowed it away in her hidden pocket. Laura concealed herself, her handgun ready.

Mr. Smith stood at the study door, pushing it open. She sensed he was about to step inside, and she crouched in the corner, gun aimed squarely at his head. But just then, a loud knock echoed from downstairs, accompanied by urgent calls.

Mr. Smith withdrew his hand and headed downstairs. Laura had initially planned to deal with him quietly in the study, but the visitor's arrival disrupted her plan. Reluctantly, she followed, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

She noticed Mr. Smith had reached the ground floor and opened the door, revealing two of his subordinates. Though they lacked a uniform, their casual attire was unmistakable.

"Mr. Smith, Young Master Fred requests your presence; the banquet in the main building has commenced. Please come with us immediately."

"I'll be there shortly," Mr. Smith replied nonchalantly, casting a disdainful glance at the two men.

The two lackeys seemed displeased with Mr. Smith's attitude, emphasizing their request once more. Mr. Smith regarded their defiant tone with a chuckle, and before they could react, he drew his gun and fired twice. Laura was stunned—did he just kill them outright?

One word of disagreement, and he opened fire, shooting his own men. She relished the chaos of internal strife, feeling exhilarated by the bloodshed.

Laura slowly raised her gun, ready to send this man off to the afterlife. Unfortunately, the gunfire attracted numerous onlookers. While she felt a twinge of regret, the ensuing drama was still worth the wait.

Moments later, several well-dressed men in business suits arrived at the door, their presence radiating authority. Following them were a row of armed thugs, led by a man known as Brother Larry, the notorious enforcer. At this point, Laura had slipped into the dimly lit dining area, concealing her presence.

She gripped a submachine gun capable of firing forty rounds in rapid succession, perfect for close-range, high-intensity shooting. The silencer attached made the barrel slightly longer, but that was inconsequential; once they entered, she would take them all down.

Her thirst for action transformed her demeanor—her eyes sparkled with excitement, and her smile was anything but ordinary.

"Mr. Smith, Young Master Fred respects you and calls you 'Sir', but that doesn't mean you can do as you please within the base," one man spoke sternly, his righteous indignation palpable.

"Ha, then tell Fred to come here and say that to my face. Let’s see if he dares to touch me," Mr. Smith replied, still toying with the ivory bracelet, his tone dripping with disdain.

"You've grown too arrogant, Mr. Smith; being called 'Sir' is a sign of respect," the lead man continued, his expression one of scorn, his words at odds with his demeanor.

Suddenly, Mr. Smith aimed his gun at the leader's head, sneering, "Want to give it a try? Will you die if I pull the trigger?"

"Mr. Smith, you and Young Master Fred are sworn brothers; let's not escalate this," Brother Larry interjected quickly, his face a mask of concern, glancing at the lifeless body of a comrade shot by Mr. Smith.

"Hmph, you all know we're sworn brothers yet still dare to walk all over me?" Mr. Smith's anger flared, his voice rising.

Laura found the dog-eat-dog scenario amusing, allowing them ample time to tear into each other.

"Mr. Smith, how could you say that? Everyone in the base knows your status; who would dare to challenge you?" Brother Larry continued to flatter, clearly clueless about the situation.

"Hmph, what status? If I had real status, would the woman I chose be taken right under my nose?" Mr. Smith shouted, his fury evident as the veins on his neck bulged.

"You not only snatched my chosen woman but also harmed my men. What, are you so eager to burn bridges?"

Laura finally understood the source of his outrage. It seemed the root of their conflict lay in the uneven distribution of spoils, particularly regarding his woman.

Instantly, no one dared to respond, as the truth was undeniable—Mr. Smith's choice of woman had significance, and she was stolen right out from under him.

"Mr. Smith, Young Master Fred requests your presence again," another thug called out.

Laura's heart raced—Old Dog Coin was here! This was perfect; the day had finally come.

Brother Larry managed to persuade Mr. Smith to leave with them. Laura followed closely behind, remaining in the shadows, undetected.

The main building was bright with lights. As she watched the group go through security, she knew she had to find a way to blend in. Luckily, she had already changed into a gown. In the dim corner, she quickly slipped into her hidden pocket, shedding her outerwear for a formal dress, donning high heels and a wool coat, and applying a bold red lipstick. The transformation was stark, significantly altering her appearance and grace.

Emerging from the corner, she walked toward the main building, swaying her hips and exuding charm.

Although the guards didn't recognize her, the way she carried herself in the dress—a clear reflection of Mr. Smith's unique taste—spared her from scrutiny. With so many women of similar allure around, her identity seemed less suspicious.

The gown she chose may have been gaudy, but it left plenty of room for movement. She breezed past the guards, greeted by a rush of warm air upon entering. Inside, there was a coat rack where two maids stood, heads bowed, seemingly waiting to assist guests.

Laura chose not to summon them; they didn't look eager to serve her. She took off her outerwear and slipped into the coat rack area, discreetly storing it away in her hidden pocket.

Casually turning back, she noticed a basket on the other side of the entryway filled with lavish masquerade masks. Realizing the theme for the evening was a masquerade ball, she picked a mask that matched her ostentatious dress and donned it before stepping into the grand hall.

She knew someone would be watching her as she exited the coat rack, but with her fitted gown leaving no room for concealed weapons, no one approached to search her.

Laura couldn’t help but scoff—was Fred really that afraid of death?

Then let’s see how fear plays out.

As she entered the grand hall, she drew little attention, perhaps overshadowed by other more dazzling women. Grabbing a glass of champagne from a passing server, she discreetly surveyed the main building's environment and layout.

Finding a secluded corner away from the crowd, she released her intuition, searching for Fred. Disappointment washed over her when she found no sign of him on the first floor, but logic reminded her not to rush.

If all else fails, she could always blow up the entire villa. She glanced at the raucous men and shrieking women in the center of the room, disgusted by their debauchery.
