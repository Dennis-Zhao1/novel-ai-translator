**Chapter: The Unexpected Transformation**

Lila Benson, immersed in the simple joy of unboxing, noticed nothing unusual despite her recent upgrade. Previously, she had struggled to understand why so many people were obsessed with mystery boxes. After all, they were just resin figurines—cute, sure, but beyond being decorative, what else could they do? As the daughter of a wealthy business tycoon, she couldn’t relate at all.

But now, she got it—the unparalleled satisfaction that came from the thrill of the unknown and the surprises it held.

“Wow!” she exclaimed, unable to suppress her excitement as she revealed a dragon-patterned jade pendant, reminiscent of ancient art. The intricate patterns, craftsmanship, and jade quality all clearly indicated its authenticity—this was undoubtedly a genuine piece from an era long past.

While others might overlook its value, Lila, raised in a family of jewelers, had seen and touched countless treasures. Her theoretical knowledge was solid; she would never misjudge something like this.

“Oh my gosh,” she thought, “Ethan Ford must be bold enough to go treasure hunting!”

Two pieces of evidence convinced her that Ethan had acquired this pendant through questionable means. First, the soil stains on the jade were very apparent, still carrying the fresh scent of earth, unlike any family heirloom that had been worn for years. For instance, her own C-shaped jade dragon pendant bore no traces of soil whatsoever.

Second, even if it wasn’t from treasure hunting, it must have been circulated privately from official channels, like a museum. This was a national treasure, and having it in his possession was still a crime. However, given his character, there was no way he would pay a price for it, making the assumption of treasure hunting quite reasonable.

Lila couldn’t help but smirk. If she snitched on him now, he’d likely be sentenced for a long time. However, as the challenges of the world loomed, escaping would be a piece of cake for someone like him. Besides, there was no way she would return what she had intercepted. It was a nice dream, but her grandfather had never taught her such things.

Wearing her jewelry appraisal gloves, she admired the beauty of the ancient jade, the depth of its history, and her own luck. With a satisfied sigh, she set it down in a black velvet tray.

Continuing her unboxing journey, she hummed a tune, albeit slightly off-key. Several more boxes yielded average-quality colored gemstone jewelry—nice enough to grace any jewelry store or upscale venue, but they paled in comparison to the stunning jade pendant.

After organizing the jewelry, Lila wanted to admire the ancient jade pendant again. She turned her head—where was it?

The black tray beside her was utterly empty.

Cold sweat broke out on her forehead, and her hair stood on end. Had it vanished into thin air?

She immediately got to her feet and scanned the area, finally noticing the mirror hanging from above. The welcoming inscription had transformed into a series of ancient characters she couldn’t decipher.

Was this noticeable change connected to the surge of mystical energy she had just felt? Lila was forced to ponder deeper.

The space wouldn’t respond to her; the only way to uncover the truth was to continue unboxing. If Ethan had indeed hunted treasures, he surely wouldn’t have only one piece.

Determined, she accelerated her unboxing pace. The floor was littered with torn newspapers and foam, while a pile of unopened mystery boxes awaited her. As she worked swiftly, memories of her first summer internship at her family’s supply chain company came flooding back.

As a junior employee, she had been tasked with unpacking shipments, entering them into inventory, and appraising them—her current activities felt eerily similar.

Not wanting the dismantled packaging to overwhelm her, she stood up to find a black garbage bag, meticulously inspecting the discarded materials before neatly placing them inside. Now it looked much tidier.

“Hmm, I’m a qualified jeweler,” Lila affirmed to herself.

As more jewelry and jade artifacts emerged from the boxes, she no longer bothered to appraise each piece individually; instead, she set them aside to deal with later. The more valuable jade and ancient artifacts went directly into her lap tray. She refused to believe they could be snatched right under her nose.

But reality proved that one truly should not boast.

As the mystical energy surged wildly again, Lila watched in disbelief as three exquisite ancient jade discs and a jade ornament vanished into thin air.

“What the heck?” she exclaimed, standing up and pointing at the mirror. “What’s your deal? Are you robbing me in broad daylight?”

The mirror had begun to fog over, making it hard to see the two sundials within, let alone the incomprehensible ancient script.

If her grandfather were here, he would likely tap her on the head, playfully chastising her for not studying hard enough. If only she had read more of the ancient texts in their family library, she wouldn’t be struggling with these characters now.

Lila received no response from the space. The fog only thickened, and the mystical energy she felt intensified. Accustomed to its cleansing flow through her body, she found it increasingly overwhelming.

What was happening? Lacking experience, she could only sit cross-legged and draw upon the methods she had learned from ancient texts, directing the energy through her body. What had begun as a trickle of energy now surged like a mighty river, fast and furious.

Even with her intention, the energy rushed in, reckless and unyielding. Focusing intently, she guided it, entering a state of blissful oblivion.

Lila experienced the transformation from passive to active, and finally to automatic cultivation.

When she finally awakened, the space had changed dramatically.

Everything around her remained, but what was this cloud floating in the sky?

In this once-stagnant space, she could now feel a gentle breeze brushing against her skin. The barren yellow earth had transformed into a lush green meadow.

Wait, there was even a small hill! It seemed like a little bump, and if it weren’t so far away, she would have walked over to check its height—was it even five feet?

Looking back at the mirror above, it was still the same mirror, but the display screen seemed larger. The sundials still occupied half the space, but now the other half was filled with traditional characters she could finally read.

She understood, but at what cost? Four exquisite ancient jades traded for a little hill, a patch of grass, and a slightly larger mirror—it felt like a colossal loss.

It was all her fault for hoarding so much lately; she hadn’t had time to clean up. The sheer volume of supplies had blocked her vision, causing her to overlook the most valuable items in the Jade Dragon Secret Realm.

But even if she were told now, Lila wouldn’t care. As a scion of a jewelry family, she appreciated the beauty and historical significance of ancient jade. It was something that should be passed down for future generations to know, see, and feel, rather than abruptly disappearing.

Frustration overshadowed her earlier joy in intercepting Ethan’s treasures, and Lila felt utterly defeated.

She raised her head to look at the mirror, puffing her chest out like a bellows, one hand on her hip and the other pointing at the mirror.

“You may have upgraded, but what do you think you’re doing, stealing my ancient jade?”
