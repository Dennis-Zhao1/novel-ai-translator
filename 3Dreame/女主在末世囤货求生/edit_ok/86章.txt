**Intrigue Among the Clans**

After returning to the fortress amidst the chaos of the apocalypse, Laura Bennett's skills had significantly improved thanks to the crystal cores and specialized training. The gap between her team and the members of various factions had widened considerably in terms of strength.

This was something Laura welcomed with open arms; boosting her team's overall capability meant they would stand a fighting chance in the future.

The long-anticipated internal conflict among the factions had finally erupted, but the outcome was unexpectedly severe: the elder of the Smith faction had been taken hostage by the side branches of the family.

Standing atop the office building, the spring air was thick with the scent of renewal. The once-bare branches began to show hints of green, unnoticed by most, while the sun cast a warm glow that felt comforting. However, the hearts of those present felt as if they had plummeted into an ice cavern, especially for the ordinary people of the Smith faction who lacked abilities. The mere thought of the elder's potential death sent chills down their spines. Chaos would certainly ensue within the fortress, and their fate without support was all too grim to contemplate.

Laura stood at a distance with her team, her keen eyes spotting the frail, pallid face of the elder and the slight rise and fall of his chest. John Smith had already gathered the faction’s younger members around him, clearly delineating between the main family and the side branches. Laura had no intention of intervening; she was curious about how the Smith faction would handle this situation. After all, she had previously sensed their united front against external threats, which now felt deeply ironic.

Ethan Smith had never experienced such betrayal among family members. The events Laura had faced were merely stories he had heard, and by the time he learned of them, it was too late—everything had been suppressed by the elder, and no one dared to mention it again.

Being so well-protected during the apocalypse was both a blessing and a curse. Laura turned her attention away from Ethan's shocked and pained expression, instead observing the reactions of the other Smith faction members.

The ease with which the elder had been kidnapped suggested long-term planning; it was unclear whether this marked an end or simply the beginning of their troubles.

A cool voice broke through her thoughts. "If the elder knew he had been protecting such heartless wretches, I wonder if he would regret it now," said Alex Johnson.

Laura responded with an emotionless tone, "He devoted his life to raising them, only to be betrayed in the end. It’s poetic, really."

John was already on the rooftop negotiating with the kidnappers. The distance was too great for Laura to hear the details, and she couldn’t make out their expressions clearly. However, she noticed both parties glance in her direction, which suggested that they had calculated their odds.

Turning to the old butler, she asked, "How much supplies do we have left in the warehouse?"

The old butler pulled out the ledger and reported a series of numbers. Laura nodded and instructed Mike to take two teammates to the warehouse to gather supplies. With all the attention focused on the negotiations at the top of the office building, it was a reasonable precaution.

Alex watched the trio quickly depart, his expression one of agreement.

The negotiations on the rooftop dragged on without resolution, and the ability users below were hesitant to act. The more timid ordinary clan members had already begun to weep in each other’s embrace.

No one from the Smith faction approached Laura for assistance or inquiry, a reflection of the faction's doctrine that family matters should be resolved internally, without outside intervention.

Laura had never desired to integrate into the Smith faction; she found their traditions and habits tiresome. Otherwise, simply marrying a Smith descendant would have sufficed for her to become one of them. The elder had tested her in subtle ways before, but she had always maintained an indifferent stance.

Watching the unfolding drama became tiresome, so she settled onto the steps beside the plaza, sacrificing her image for the sake of enjoying the warm spring sun.

Squinting, she watched as the side branch members on the rooftop continued to gesticulate animatedly. Their expressions grew increasingly sinister, while John seemed unyielding.

Turning, she noticed the Smith faction members responsible for the watchtower had gathered in the plaza as well, and her instincts tingled with unease.

Taking advantage of the distraction, she leaned in and whispered a few words to Ann, then patted Alex on the shoulder. The two slipped out of the plaza and headed toward the fortress's entrance.

"What's going on?" Alex inquired as they walked briskly.

By the time they reached the parking lot, Laura had opened the car door and hopped inside, with Alex following closely behind.

"The guards and patrol teams are all congregating in the plaza," she replied, her expression tense. Alex's heart sank at her words.

Under normal circumstances, regardless of what occurred in the stronghold, patrol teams should never cease their rounds, and guards could not abandon their posts easily—especially now that the zombies had awakened their abilities, making them more destructive and mobile.

The turbulent undercurrents of the past few days could fool others, but they did not escape the increasingly wary Laura. She had long suspected that the side branches of the Smith faction had been colluding with external forces, beyond just the Hillcrest base—other unknown entities were involved.

Yet, she had struggled to comprehend their true motives until now, when a semblance of clarity started to form in her mind.

Arriving at the stronghold's entrance, she retrieved the keys to the weapons cache and unlocked the door. To her relief, all the weapons and the black boxes were still intact. She instructed Alex to check the situation outside regarding the zombies, while she proceeded to store all the weapons and black boxes in her space. Next, she needed to verify something.

When Alex returned, Laura had already secured the cache door, noting that the number of zombies was lower than usual. Her brows knitted together as she sighed and said, "Let’s head back; it’s not good to be away for too long."

They quickly drove back, the entire round trip taking no more than ten minutes.

However, within that brief timeframe, many events had transpired. It turned out that after being kidnapped, the elder had remained on the rooftop, exposed to the wind. Given his frail condition and the emotional turmoil from his family’s betrayal—fear, anger, heartbreak, and more—he had failed to take his medication in time, and now he was in a precarious state.

John was frantic, rushing to find Eric, who had the healing abilities. But he was met with the reply that no one was available from the research institute.

Chaos erupted in the plaza, and Mike returned with his two teammates, nodding at Laura to signal he had completed his task.

Continuing to sit on the plaza steps, she felt the cool wind against her skin as the negotiations on the rooftop remained unresolved.

Before long, John descended the stairs in despondency. Standing in the plaza, he looked at his kin, his eyes red-rimmed, fists clenched as he struggled to suppress his emotions. With a trembling voice, he declared, "From today onwards, all management authority within the stronghold is handed over to Mark from the third branch."

As he spoke, Laura observed the pallid elder, who had closed his eyes, being escorted down the stairs by those from the third branch.

Mark's face lit up with delight at the proclamation, and he quickly began issuing orders to the members of the third, fourth, and fifth branches. The elder was now entirely in John's hands.

John, hardly able to contain himself, hastily instructed others to carry the elder back to his quarters. The surrounding crowd wore expressions of anxiety, while those who typically flattered the main family began to plot.

Laura watched the scene unfold with cool detachment, as if it were none of her concern. The very next moment, a group approached her.

Maintaining her lazy demeanor, she remained unfazed as they glared down at her. Their dismissive attitude only served to infuriate them further.

Mark spoke up, his voice dripping with arrogance. "Laura Bennett, from this moment on, all your rights within the stronghold are null and void. If you wish to remain here, you must pay fifty pounds of food or supplies each month."

Mike's fists clenched tightly, making a metallic crunching sound.

Mark wasn't intimidated; he had awakened his own abilities and thought little of the other ability users. With sheer numbers on his side, he was ready to fight if it came to that. In his eyes, there was no rule forbidding ability users from taking action.

He believed in the principle of the strong prevailing over the weak, and he considered himself the stronger one.

With a casual demeanor, Laura responded, "You do realize this stronghold was built with half of my Bennett family’s funds? I’ve not asked you for rent, and you dare to make such demands?"

"Ha! You claim to have contributed money? I don’t recognize that today. What are you going to do about it?" Mark retorted, adopting a combative stance, flanked by side branch ability users ready for a fight.

Just then, John rushed back onto the scene, alarmed by the confrontation. "Mark, what do you think you're doing?"

Mark, brimming with arrogance, shot back, "What do you think I’m doing? Can you stop me?"

The side branch ability users turned their attention to him, while the main family members stood behind John. However, they were outnumbered severely, creating a vast disparity in strength.

Laura’s side had a decent number of ability users, but they still paled in comparison to the side branches.

As tensions mounted among the three factions, the atmosphere grew thick with anticipation, as if a battle was on the verge of igniting.
