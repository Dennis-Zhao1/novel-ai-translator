**Strange Seeds**

As Ivy blurted out her retort, it sent Claire into fits of laughter. She hadn't meant to make a sound that could wake the dead while getting up from bed, but it was clear that Claire was just looking for trouble.

Ivy hesitated, caught between wanting to fire back and holding her tongue, when she saw Claire glaring at her with two enormous dark circles under her eyes.

“How can you still laugh? You snored so loudly last night you practically kept everyone awake! Do you even care about others’ sleep?”

“You’re full of it! You were the one who snored! How would I know if you were sneaking around with someone last night? Just look at those dark circles you’re sporting. It’s obvious you’ve been up to no good, and now you’re blaming me! Ugh, how dare you!” 

Ivy's expression was one of pure exasperation, but her words hit Claire right in her insecurities. In a fit of flustered anger, Claire shot back, “How dare you say that! You’ve been disturbing others and now you’re insulting me? I want to change rooms!”

Claire didn’t know if she was overreacting or genuinely at her wit's end. She stormed out, tears in her eyes, seeking solace from anyone who would listen. Ivy, unfazed, calmly changed her clothes, grabbed her toiletries, and headed out, muttering under her breath about Claire's dramatic exit while brushing her teeth—a habit she didn't mind even if it meant spreading morning breath around.

When Claire learned there were no spare rooms to switch to, her gaze towards Ivy turned icy.

Not wanting to engage further, Ivy joined Ethan and the select group to the Awakening Observation Room. Claire wanted to tag along, but unfortunately, there were no spots left for her, and she had no authority to roam the facility. Frustrated, she stomped her feet in anger.

Concerned about her appearance, Claire noticed that the team members were giving her the cold shoulder. She gave up on maintaining her image, letting her hair fall loosely and going without makeup. Youth had its advantages—she didn't need much effort to look good.

Meanwhile, the vice-captain was leading the team in their routine training in the yard. After finishing her tidying up, Claire sat under a large tree, watching. When Ethan and Ivy returned, they noticed that Claire had shifted her attention, now sweet-talking the vice-captain and being overly friendly.

Ivy nudged Ethan with her elbow, gesturing for him to take a look. “Look at that! She doesn't want to risk her own reputation, so she's using her charm on the vice-captain. What a move!”

Ethan simply chuckled and said nothing. That evening, the two of them had to guard the awakened individuals at the facility. After announcing their duties to Claire, they left together.

Later that night, as usual, Claire waited until everyone else was asleep before quietly leaving her room. With Ivy and Ethan both absent, she didn’t waste time lingering outside Ethan’s door like last time. Instead, she swiftly climbed out the window.

What she didn’t realize was that, at that very moment, several people hidden against the exterior wall had spotted her: Lucas, Ethan, Anna, and Ivy, with Megan still on duty at the Awakening Observation Room. The four of them had exhausted their patience dealing with Claire.

Once Claire returned to her room, Ethan and the others found the spot she had just been at. Lucas, curious, crouched down to take a look, only to be held back by Ethan’s large hand.

“Be careful; this thing is strange. Don’t touch it.”

Yesterday, he and the vice-captain had discovered something but hadn’t dared to handle it. After confirming its location, they returned. Lucas shrugged and pulled out a small trowel from his backpack and threw it to Ethan.

“Dig it up; this way, you won’t be scared, right?”

The others were speechless. Scared? What was that about? Ethan expertly dug up the items that Claire had buried in the soil from both yesterday and today, while Anna used her wind abilities to clear away the dirt, revealing four dark, bean-like seeds.

Lucas quickly found a glass jar to store the peculiar objects and then buried some similar beans back in the ground.

The group hurried to the ability observation room to find Dr. Carter, presenting him with the items they had dug up.

Dr. Carter wasn’t a botanist, but he had dealt with various peculiar specimens in biological research, so he had some knowledge of plants. He immediately raised the glass jar and inquired about the origin of the seeds. Upon learning that they might have been deliberately buried by an undercover agent, he became much more vigilant.

The other seeds were sealed for safekeeping, with one kept under a microscope for further examination. Lucas understood there was a high probability they wouldn’t discover anything significant.

After studying the sample for a while, Dr. Carter concluded, “These seeds are likely from mutated plants. They could either be vines or crops.”

“Why not find a nature-type ability user to try and stimulate it?” Anna suggested, but Ethan immediately stopped her.

Lucas and the others were surprised by his response as he continued, “What if it’s a gamble to see if you can successfully stimulate it? The fact that they went through the trouble of sending in Claire means this seed is extremely important.”

Dr. Carter countered, “Then according to their plan, what could these seeds possibly do? What kind of destruction can they cause?”

“Let’s just try stimulating one and see what happens,” Ivy chimed in. She was also there for the awakening, and with the four of them as ability users, what was there to be afraid of?

Since everyone was eager to find out, Anna was sent to fetch a nature-type ability user. In the middle of the night, the group waited in the laboratory, and soon after, Anna returned with one of Megan’s subordinates who had nature abilities.

The level three nature ability user struggled to stimulate the seed, and after almost exhausting his mental energy, a small sprout emerged, but it appeared unhealthy, a sickly yellow that made it look inferior to any bean sprout before the apocalypse.

Just as he withdrew his hand, the sprout began to change color dramatically, as if it had caught a whiff of something enticing. Once it turned a deep green, it shot up rapidly, growing to the length of a human arm.

Dr. Carter began to closely observe it while asking Anna to take notes. However, when his hand brushed the tip of the sprout’s leaves, the entire plant suddenly took on an aggressive stance, as if it would lunge for Dr. Carter’s eyes. Lucas swiftly grabbed it, and the plant writhed violently in his grip, as if it were alive.

With ice abilities covering his hands, Lucas wasn’t afraid of the suddenly thorny plant and held on tightly.

Dr. Carter instructed him to loosen his grip so he wouldn’t kill the specimen while he diligently recorded his findings.

After a brief period, Dr. Carter reached his initial conclusion: “This plant has a robust root system like wild grass, and after mutation, its leaves are sharp and capable of climbing. It exhibits aggressive behavior.”

He then made a small cut in the sturdy root of the vine. The plant recoiled sharply, immediately reverting to an aggressive stance, and Dr. Carter quickly trapped it in a glass container.

Inside the covered plant, it thrashed around wildly, appearing restless. The group was taken aback; could this plant have sentience?

Dr. Carter had the nature ability user attempt to control it, finding it somewhat effective. However, each time it interacted with nature abilities, the plant’s size increased. When it grew too large for the container, they decided to destroy it.

After the nature ability user stopped, Lucas froze the plant solid with his ice powers. A firm shove shattered it into tiny chunks that scattered across the floor.

To their surprise, after thawing, the fragments of the plant’s roots began to grow rapidly, splitting into numerous small plants. The rate of reproduction was faster than printing money.

Anna, initially intending to use wind abilities to clean up the mess, inadvertently provided the ideal growth environment for the plants.

They had no choice but to burn everything to ash to resolve the situation. The remaining three seeds were safely collected by Lucas, and he exchanged a knowing glance with Ethan, both realizing they had a much clearer understanding of Claire’s intentions for sneaking in.
