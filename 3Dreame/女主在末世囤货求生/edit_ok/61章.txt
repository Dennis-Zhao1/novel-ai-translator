**A Narrow Encounter**

Liam's previously tense expression softened considerably; he had acted impulsively. He had thought that Bella was just like those superficial individuals, clinging to him for what he could offer. Little did he realize that she had her own strengths and abilities, even before the world had changed so drastically. She had proven herself time and again on their missions.

Her harsh words were tough to swallow, but they were honest. Liam was someone who took others' opinions to heart. If something happened to him, his father would be deeply affected, and there were many watching his position.

Realizing this, he forced a smile at Bella. "Since you put it that way, Miss, I won't push it. Feel free to visit the Haven base whenever you want."

With that, he turned and got into his car.

Nathan crossed his arms and watched the young woman who continued to ignore him. He rubbed his nose, then turned away as well.

At this moment, Eric finally put away his gun, and Bella lowered her raised arms, signaling everyone to return to safety.

Once back, she informed Grandpa Joe and Uncle Joe about the encounter. Grandpa Joe leaned on his cane, analyzing the situation. Communication was still down in many areas, and the government had not initiated rescue efforts immediately. Instead, the military had established the Haven base, displaying an attitude that felt oddly detached.

After years of navigating complex situations, Grandpa Joe found himself at a loss, unable to unravel the motives behind these actions.

In Bella's heart, a vague sense of unease began to emerge, only to dissipate too quickly to grasp. She reiterated the timeline of global magnetic field changes, emphasizing the urgency to develop a serum that could fight the zombie virus. If they succeeded, it could be a turning point for humanity. Otherwise, if humans and zombies evolved together, ordinary people without abilities would find survival exceedingly difficult.

Bella was determined not to endure such pain and helplessness again. Time was of the essence; Uncle Joe and his team were working hard, and she was well aware of it, yet anxiety still gnawed at her.

In her previous life, there had been no serum to combat the zombie virus. What about this time? She resolved to strengthen her mental fortitude. Even if she ended up without powers again, she would rely on her spatial abilities, exceptional physical fitness, and keen perception to avoid falling to the lowest tier of society.

Having been given a second chance, there were still debts to settle, people to protect, and a life to lead in order to live up to her grandfather’s expectations.

Bringing her thoughts back to the present, she smiled at Grandpa Joe and Uncle Joe. "There's no need to be overly pessimistic. Our fortress is secure, and we have ample supplies. The crops have already been harvested once. Everything will be alright."

She also suggested that they should go out on missions again, not just to hunt zombies but also to scavenge for supplies nearby, taking advantage of the fact that zombies were currently easier to deal with.

Both Grandpa Joe and Uncle Joe agreed. They had never encountered zombies mutated in this way and could only imagine what it would be like. Since Bella had a plan, they would follow her lead.

Life in the fortress for over half a year had not depleted the supplies stored in Bella's space, but she still needed to find a legitimate excuse to transfer items out.

Recently, Eric often lamented that he had nothing left to teach Bella. She had mastered both combat techniques and marksmanship remarkably well.

However, Bella held herself to higher standards. Having witnessed the true strength of powerful individuals, she recognized that while she might not like them, their excellence was worth learning from. That individual was none other than Nathan, whom she often referred to as the "dog man."

The way he wielded his blade to dispatch zombies was like a banner raised high, something she couldn’t reach no matter how hard she tried.

It would be a lie to say she felt no frustration. In order to survive, she had to work even harder...

As November rolled in, the temperature gradually dropped, and the city began to show signs of impending snow.

Bella and Eric drove out in search of supplies, both dressed in practical sports jackets. Bella toyed with the gun in her hands, her thoughts drifting far away.

Since their last encounter, Liam had managed to find out the location of her stronghold and frequently sent people to invite her out, leaving her puzzled about his intentions. Of course, no one paid him any mind, and the more they rejected him, the more persistent he became, stirring up rumors among the fortress residents.

It wasn't just Bella who sensed something amiss; Grandpa Joe and Uncle Joe also picked up on the subtle machinations behind those actions. Without any concrete moves or opportunities to act, Uncle Joe could only strengthen their defenses and increase patrols around the fortress.

Eric drove steadily, their destination set for the old family residence. They had to take the highway loop, circling from the west to the southeast, passing through several commercial and residential districts.

Just as Bella was lost in her thoughts, Eric's voice broke through.

As she regained her focus, the car came to a halt. She looked up to see two groups engaged in a fierce gunfight. Eric stepped on the gas, driving straight into the battlefield.

This was a bit awkward; was there even a way to turn around? Before Bella could voice her concern, one group was retreating and had already moved dangerously close to their truck.

The truck didn’t seem bulletproof, and just as that thought crossed her mind—

“Bang!”

A bullet shattered a hole in the windshield, right in the center, not immediately causing it to shatter but leaving spiderweb-like cracks that signaled just how close they had come to danger.

Eric quickly grabbed her head and pushed it down toward her seat, bending over himself as he drew his gun and disengaged the safety with his left hand.

Bella reacted swiftly, already gripping her gun.

Inside, she couldn’t help but curse. Where had these blind idiots come from? The glass was shattered, and there was no fixing it! Did they want to freeze someone to death in this cold weather?

Hearing the gunfire and shouting outside, Bella used her mental powers to sense the situation, discovering that the retreating group was using their truck as cover.

“Bang bang bang…”

Several bullets struck the vehicle, the sound echoing ominously.

“Damn it!” Eric cursed, quickly unbuckling his seatbelt and tugging at Bella.

Bella had already flung open the passenger door; she understood Eric’s frustration. If they kept shooting, their car would explode.

The two of them quickly exited the vehicle, taking advantage of the brief pause in the gunfire to dash back with all their might.

They found themselves in a commercial area that had been cleared twice before. Using her mental powers to sense the surroundings, Bella led Eric to hide behind the nearest wall.

“Boom!”

A deafening explosion and a rush of air confirmed that their car had been blown up.

Fuming, she stomped her foot, ready to retaliate and engage in combat.

Eric pulled at her, directing her gaze towards a familiar figure in the chaos.

Bella’s face turned icy; she turned her head to see a familiar face, and to her dismay, it was one she had seen in even worse shape than before.

Eric, unsure if it was because they had hit it off last time or because they shared a military background, felt a sense of camaraderie and couldn’t bear to watch the other party perish.

“Do we save him?”

Eric was well aware of Bella's capabilities and strength.

Bella was taken aback by Eric's question; considering their past interactions, they didn’t seem particularly close.

But looking into his anxious eyes, it was clear he genuinely wanted to help.

Eric had never asked her for anything before; he always silently stood by her side. It was rare for him to ask, and she felt compelled to grant his wish.

Turning to look back at the man, she noticed he wasn’t wielding a knife this time; instead, he held a rifle, protecting an injured teammate and preparing for an offensive.

“Save him,” Bella replied flatly. For now, she couldn’t accept that a flag she hadn’t yet surpassed could fall so easily.

Eric nodded, outlining a battle strategy. Bella understood, and they switched positions.

Now, she could clearly see who was on the opposite side; it was that jerk.

Gritting her teeth, her gaze icy, her mind focused on a single thought:

“Get ready, you’re going down!”
