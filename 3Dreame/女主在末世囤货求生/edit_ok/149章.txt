**Enhanced Abilities Serum**

Ivy Bennett's confidence was as straightforward as it was overwhelming. She believed that she'd finally caught the chance to pursue a successful man, and she couldn't bear to watch it slip away. If she succeeded, she'd become the respected lady of the base.

Just a power-driven woman, really.

Knowing that silence was better than spinning tales, Ivy hung her head, sniffling, though her tears had dried up. Lucy Brighton relaxed into her folding chair and continued to probe, “What are those seeds for?”

Ivy lifted her face to glance at Lucy before lowering her head again. “Mr. Foster said those seeds could change the soil environment and some structure here. It’s all very complicated, but they could save lives and have great power. I was so angry that day I buried four seeds—just four—and they still won’t sprout.”

At this point, she genuinely felt that Foster was messing with her. Whatever life-saving treasures he had promised, they had rotted in the ground without even sprouting. They were just fake seeds that couldn’t yield anything.

“And what about those powders? What are they for?” Lucy pressed on.

“They’re supposed to change the water quality. They work together with the seeds. Mr. Foster said to plant the seeds near the water source and sprinkle the powder in the water, and the seeds would grow big and fast.”

Ethan Parker couldn’t help but sigh for Foster. Was the water source a drain? No wonder the seeds rotted; the water in a drain was nothing but waste and couldn’t be used at all. What a waste of talent.

He couldn’t resist chiming in, “Shouldn’t we just let her go? Foster could really use someone like her.”

Lucy had been engrossed in her role as the cold-hearted antagonist, but Ethan’s comment made her burst into laughter.

Ivy saw the two of them laughing right in front of her, and her pale face surprisingly flushed with a hint of color.

“That’s not possible! We can’t let her go without clarifying everything. She’s at least a witness, right?” After glancing at Ethan, Lucy continued her questioning, now with a hint of patience. “Besides the seeds, are there any other items? You said you had confidence. Show me what you’ve got.”

“There’s nothing else. Mr. Foster only gave me these two things, and neither of them works. He’s just messing with me, messing me up!” She broke down into tears again, only to be interrupted by Lucy’s firm voice.

“Enough. Last question: What are Foster's plans?”

“I don’t know! All I know is that he wants to take over the Longshadow Base. I’m just a pioneer, a pathfinder.”

Lucy confirmed that Ivy was just a pawn in this game. There was no way someone so loud and foolish would be sent out if they were planning something serious.

At this moment, her patience was exhausted. She stood up, folded her chair, and told Ethan to deal with Ivy. They left the room together, shutting the door and turning off the lights behind them.

As they walked to the lab, Ethan was deep in thought, and neither spoke a word.

The water from the drain had already been collected for testing, and there were still no toxic substances. However, the seeds were gone, leaving them unable to conduct experiments. Lucy was worried that Foster might have scattered seeds in key areas, and if those seeds grew, they could potentially destroy the base in the apocalypse.

With that thought in mind, her mind filled with images of mutated plants wreaking havoc, leading to an overwhelming headache. When she shared her concerns, Dr. Harris and the others fell silent.

They might have a plan for dealing with zombies, but what if mutated plants appeared? Especially varieties that could split infinitely—how would they respond?

Dr. Harris had never been one to sit back passively. He proposed finding mutated plant seeds to study them further and see if they could discover a way to counteract them.

Lucy assigned this task to Ethan. Perhaps women were more open when they were vulnerable; she figured anyone could handle it as long as the job got done.

Ethan nodded and went to arrange the task while Lucy turned to Dr. Reed. The experiment for the ability-enhancing serum needed to be expedited.

Fortunately, their long hours of hard work hadn’t been in vain; Dr. Reed and his team had successfully developed the ability-enhancing serum, with the X serum playing a significant role.

Before Dr. Reed could fully express his excitement, Lucy felt a bit sheepish interrupting him. Deep down, she knew what the X serum truly was: duck bath water~

Next up was human testing. Lucy felt that for something like this, besides recruiting volunteers, a leader should lead by example. She thought she would be the first human guinea pig, but to her surprise, Dr. Reed’s younger brother had timidly raised his hand, stating he had already taken it. The second test subject was Charlie, and both of them had jumped up a level. The two, who previously hadn’t had time to go out and complete missions to collect crystal cores, had directly ascended to level four ability users.

Who would have thought that what had caused Lucy so much stress over upgrading—losing hair and all—could now be resolved with just one vial of serum? Wouldn’t dealing with zombies be as easy as swatting flies?

After reviewing their experimental reports, she noted that their bodies showed no abnormalities. However, during the upgrade, their powers would be temporarily unusable, unlike crystal core upgrades, which were gradual. This was the only flaw of the ability-enhancing serum.

Roughly half a day’s time was all it took. As long as they weren’t in danger or surrounded by other ability users for protection, this flaw wasn’t a significant issue.

Lucy held the serum in her hand; it was a light purple liquid that looked like any ordinary serum. However, her spiritual sense detected it was infused with concentrated crystal core energy—so amazing! She wondered how they had achieved this.

To think of all the crystal cores and zombies they had thrown at the lab without reservation, the returns were beyond worth it.

When Ethan returned, he found Lucy grinning like a fool while holding up the vial, as if money had fallen from the sky.

“What’s got you so happy? Upgrading isn’t that hard. Isn’t the serum not in short supply?” he asked, puzzled at her excitement. Although he was happy too, he thought someone with an advantage like him shouldn’t find satisfaction in something so trivial.

Lucy shot him an exasperated glance. Lately, she had been less inclined to argue with him and couldn’t think of any retorts. “You wouldn’t understand. This vial of serum—how many supplies and crystal cores would other bases be willing to trade for it?”

True to her business-savvy nature, Lucy had built such a large organization, and a bit of that commercial instinct was clearly evident.

Ethan nodded; indeed, with the ability awakening and enhancement serums, they could quickly create a level five ability user, making it feasible to turn everyone into ability users.

“Call Peter and have him come over. The Longshadow Base should be safe for now,” Lucy instructed Dr. Reed to continue optimizing the serum. Ideally, they would resolve the flaw completely; if that wasn’t possible, shortening the downtime would suffice.

Ethan wanted to ask Lucy why she wasn’t rushing to upgrade, but she had already said, “There’s a twelve-hour weakness period during which powers can’t be used. I definitely can’t inject it now. Let’s see if the spatial time flow works.”

The spatial flow was different; although it still required waiting twelve hours, it was safer. For safety’s sake, she decided to enter the space first before injecting the serum.

Ethan pondered this and called upon the Noisy Ghost. After the system upgrade, he had acquired a similar storage space. After absorbing three mutated plant seeds, the system had changed dramatically; he wondered if the storage space had also upgraded.

“Host, I’m here! You finally remembered me!” The Noisy Ghost lamented in a high-pitched voice, sounding like a clown from a play, sending shivers down Ethan’s spine.

If only he could reach it; otherwise, given his temperament, it would have been squashed long ago.
