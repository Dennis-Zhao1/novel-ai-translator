**Dream of Slaying Beasts**

The war had ended, but the aftermath was a logistical nightmare. The pile of bodies had risen nearly to the height of the city wall, a staggering twenty meters tall. The main gate was completely blocked, and the community was in a standstill trying to come up with a solution.

After sending the injured and exhausted comrades to the medical station, Ivy Larson and a few others stood atop the city wall, brainstorming a way to clear the path. Someone suggested climbing down over the bodies, but others quickly pointed out it would take too long. There were thousands of zombies piled high; it was an overwhelming task.

Burning the bodies had worked when there were fewer to deal with, but now? The thought of the smell was unbearable. Ivy felt the weight of the situation pressing down on her. Just then, Mr. Thomas, an older neighbor known for his resourcefulness, brought over a scientist from a local energy research institute. The scientist had developed a waste incineration power generator, ready for a test—and they could use the bodies as fuel.

The incinerator was located in a nearby mountain, where a military base had once been. The setup was perfect: the chimney was already installed, and the wind direction would carry the smoke away from the community. A wave of relief washed over the group as they realized they had a workable plan.

With the less fatigued members keeping watch, everyone else headed back to rest. By the time Ivy finished cleaning up and had a good sleep, others were still catching up on rest. Her friend, Lucy, came by to report that all residents had been notified to stay inside until the situation was under control, a precaution to prevent any accidents.

Ivy approved of the emergency measures. The main gate being shut meant there was no need for further explanation. It was best for everyone to remain indoors and avoid unnecessary risks.

Fully revitalized, Ivy made her way towards the main gate. The sheer number of corpses was staggering, and if they didn't clear them soon, the stench would become unbearable with summer approaching. The ability users, who were barely holding their positions, watched her approach with admiration. Ivy waved them off, telling them to take a break while she kept watch.

Weapons still lay scattered around from the battle. With a wave of her hand, Ivy gathered them up. She suddenly remembered the need to ask Mr. Thomas about replenishing ammunition for the firearms team; she didn’t want their investment to go to waste.

Peering down at the pile of corpses, she noticed some were still moving. She quickly conjured several ice spikes, realizing that descending directly into the pile posed a risk. If a zombie was merely trapped beneath the weight of others and hadn’t sustained any brain damage, it could still bite her!

Getting bitten would be a huge loss.

It would be better to have an earth ability user create a staircase. This way, it would be both safe and efficient. 

As she contemplated this, a figure suddenly emerged from the trees. Ivy’s eyes widened—one of the zombies, wearing a hoodie, was moving towards her. Its grotesque face and hollow eyes sent chills down her spine.

The zombie’s gaze fixed directly on her, as if an invisible hand were reaching into her mind. A wave of blankness washed over her, and Ivy cursed under her breath. She quickly reminded herself to look away—she couldn’t let herself fall victim again.

As if sensing her struggle, the zombie’s mouth curled into a sinister smile from beneath the hoodie. Ivy felt her control slipping away. With a thought, she dove into her spatial realm.

The zombie, witnessing her disappear into thin air, let out a furious, vengeful howl, clearly enraged that it could no longer track her.

At that moment, Ethan Brooks appeared on the city wall, witnessing Ivy’s sudden vanishing act, then turning to see the howling zombie below. He unleashed a series of lightning strikes, hitting the hoodie-wearing zombie, which could not dodge the attack. After taking several jolts of electricity, the zombie, realizing it couldn’t get closer to the gate, retreated in frustration.

Ethan was unaware of what Ivy had encountered. Her entering the spatial realm in such a location, combined with the zombie’s strange behavior, suggested a connection.

In a previous life—or maybe just a previous experience—he had never faced such a large-scale zombie siege but had encountered similar situations. He could only wait until she reappeared to ask what had happened.

Resolved to guard the city wall for her, he leaned against the wall and rested.

However, as night fell, Ivy still hadn’t reappeared. He knew the flow of time in her space was extremely slow. Even so, one or two hours should have been enough for her to return. It seemed she had encountered something serious. In his mind, he called out to the noisy spirit.

“Hey, what's going on?”

“Sorry, can’t reach anyone! You’re not in the secret realm, so communication’s blocked!”

“Great, just great. Well, keep trying.”

Ethan silenced the annoying system, having to rely on patience to wait. The ability users who came up to relieve the guard cast curious glances at him. Was it normal for someone like him to sleep on the city wall?

Meanwhile, Ivy was suffering from a splitting headache. Entering her space only heightened her discomfort, as if her brain were being mercilessly tortured by needles and axes. Blood began to drip from her nose, and soon, blood flowed from all seven orifices. She couldn’t even read the messages from Xuanjing before collapsing to the ground.

In her unconscious state, Ivy experienced a long, vivid dream—one of her childhood days spent with her family. Those were happier times, but also ones that highlighted all she had lost.

As she dreamed, memories of her past traumas flooded in, each more vivid than the last. The terror of facing a zombie apocalypse, the guilt of losing her protector, the rage at being violated by those she trusted—all of it morphed into a monstrous beast that threatened to consume her.

But Ivy was not one to be defeated. She wanted to resist, reminding herself of her strength and the power she held. With newfound determination, she conjured a sword, gripping it tightly as she charged at the beast with fearless resolve.

With one decisive strike, the monstrous beast roared in agony, shattering into countless fragments that scattered like brilliant rays across the sky.
