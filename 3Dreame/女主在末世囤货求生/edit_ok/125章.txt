**The Power of Family Dynamics**

"Let's get to the bottom of this," said Laura Bennett, leaning back in her office chair with a slight tilt of her head. Before her stood Ethan James, along with his team members and Ivy Carter.

Ivy, who had been camping outdoors for three days, looked far from presentable. Her hair was a tangled mess, her jacket and jeans wrinkled, with grass and dirt clinging to the hems. Feeling embarrassed, she couldn't help but steal a glance at Ethan, who stood there calmly, his gaze fixed on Laura. Internally, she cursed him, thinking, *What a jerk! I helped him out, and this is how he repays me?*

"What's going on? Are you all going to play mute and not explain anything?" The atmosphere in the room was tense, and unable to bear the pressure, Ivy spoke up first.

"You guys, I messed up—I really did! I shouldn't have taken it upon myself to stage a little drama to spark some jealousy and reignite your relationship, leading to my three days of roughing it in the wild, eating poorly, and not even getting to see you. Boohoo!"

*Note to self: This girl is quite the actress. She's more articulate than me and is putting on a pitiful act. Clearly, she was trying to stir up trouble, but now that the plan's backfired, she's trying to clean up her mess. How naive!*

"Quiet."

Ethan immediately silenced the nagging voice in his head. The dialogue on his communication screen erupted like a barrage of comments on a social media feed, but he chose to ignore it.

"I appreciate your efforts," Laura said with a thinly veiled smile directed at Ivy.

"Guys, don't be mad! It was all just acting. Ethan, why don’t you say something too?"

Ivy, seeing her friend’s expression turning to despair, realized this wasn’t going as scripted in the dramas she watched.

With everyone's attention now on him, Ethan finally spoke up. "Well, it was just a show. Ivy insisted on thanking me for rescuing her and mentioned she couldn't stand seeing me unrequited in love. She wanted to stir up some excitement to provoke your possessiveness. I just don’t know if it worked."

He looked at Laura with genuine interest, as if awaiting her response.

Laura felt uneasy under his gaze, taking a sip of her coffee before snapping back, "Who asked you about that? I want to know what's going on with Frank Buchanan's son."

Ethan’s expression shifted slightly, blinking as he replied seriously, "It’s just a transaction. That kid has been unhappy with his father for a long time. He’s ambitious but lacks the capability and thought he could use external forces to take down his father and seize control."

Laura's eyes widened, surprised. "Is that true? The son is unhappy with his father? But he should be Frank Buchanan's only son! His status is already pretty high; shouldn't it all belong to him in the future?"

Ethan shrugged. "That's what you’d expect, but considering he was sent to handle this, it doesn’t seem like he’s favored."

Everyone fell silent. Although these newly arrived superpowered individuals were stronger, it didn’t guarantee victory. The father-son relationship was indeed intriguing.

"When did he reach out to you?" Laura leaned in, resting her chin on her hand.

"During our trip to Longview Base. He contacted my informant," Ethan replied.

"You trust this kid? He doesn't even have superpowers!"

"Exactly because he lacks abilities, he has to rely on us. He can show sincerity in seeking our cooperation. I suggest you talk to him directly."

Laura nodded, and her deputy immediately stepped out to bring in Kevin Buchanan.

As Kevin entered, he felt a surge of unease at the sight of the gathering. His usual gloomy expression was ill-suited for a friendly smile, creating a moment of awkward confusion on his face that was quite unflattering.

In fact, Frank Buchanan and his two sons were known for their charming appearances. If not for his looks, Frank wouldn’t have been able to marry the daughter of a major player in the home furnishings industry. His sons, however, each had their quirks—one was arrogant and pretentious while the other was gloomy and introverted, yet both could be considered handsome.

Under the scrutiny of their gazes, Kevin swallowed hard several times, feeling an urge to flee.

Laura watched coldly, fully aware that he was putting on an act. She had seen his true self at the Kunshan base—cunning and shrewd, always ready to seize an opportunity. Surely, Ethan wouldn’t be fooled by his facade.

Ethan instructed his deputy to keep watch outside, leaving just the four of them in the office.

Ivy looked at Kevin curiously. Unlike Laura, who had known him for over twenty years, Ivy thought the young man appeared rather appealing.

Laura, understanding her friend’s unspoken thoughts, chose to remain silent and observe, planning to discuss it privately later.

"Kevin just mentioned wanting to join us. I'm curious—do you believe that yourself?" she finally broke the silence.

Kevin, seizing the opportunity to perform, cleared his throat. "Miss Laura, I genuinely seek cooperation. The initial plan was to send at least ten enhanced superpowered individuals, but I replaced them with one Level Three superpowered person and four ordinary folks, showcasing my sincerity."

"Moreover, the original plan was to send at least fifty superpowered individuals, but now it’s fewer than thirty. Most importantly, I’ve shared the method to enhance powers with Ethan."

Both Laura and Ivy turned their gazes to Ethan, who nodded but added, "That method is too extreme; normal people can’t handle it."

Kevin nodded in agreement, forcing a bitter smile. "My father has lost his mind. He uses live subjects for experiments, injecting them with zombie blood. The failed superpowered individuals are just discarded, piled up like a mountain. Those who survive are controlled, turned into his obedient dogs."

He trembled as he spoke, his performance almost indistinguishable from Ivy's earlier act.

Laura held back her frustration. Since he’d been given the chance to perform, she could endure a little longer, but her hands unconsciously clenched into fists. Noticing this detail, Kevin misinterpreted it as fear and became even more animated.

"I’ve always opposed my father’s inhumane actions, but I feel powerless to stop him. I just hope to find capable people to help prevent him from hurting innocent lives again."

His expression conveyed a sense of righteousness and familial betrayal, nearly moving Ivy to tears.

"I didn’t expect you to be this kind-hearted, willing to betray your father for the sake of innocents," she said, her voice full of sincerity.

At this, Laura, Ethan, and Kevin all thought, *Are you mocking him?*

Kevin choked on his drink at this point, and Laura confirmed he was genuinely struggling to breathe.

Well, choking to death is still a fate.

"Ha ha ha ha, Miss Ivy, you truly have a sense of humor," Kevin awkwardly cleared his throat and continued, "I’ve come to formally seek cooperation with Miss Laura. Together, let’s save all of humanity."

This time, it was Laura who was taken aback, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the sudden lofty ideals he proclaimed.

Was that really necessary? It's truly unnecessary.

"I assure you, my sincerity is one hundred percent. How about I tell you where my father is currently?"

"......"

Truly the epitome of a dedicated son.
