**Duck's Bath Water**

Ivy stared at Ethan in shock, seeing the sincerity in his eyes as he nodded with assurance. She couldn't help but think he must be joking about the lake water. In the area around them, cows, sheep, and a variety of birds all drank from the lake, and the thought of ducks swimming in it made her cringe. Ugh... she couldn’t think about that.

With everyone’s gaze, including Ethan's, fixed on her, Ivy had no choice but to pretend to rummage through her bag for some medicine. Only she knew the struggle of finding an empty water bottle in her backpack. If she'd been thinking ahead, she would've saved one of the bottles they'd emptied earlier.

Luckily, she had left half a bottle of water untouched. In her haste, she filled it without bothering to empty it first. When she pulled it out, the water was still quite cool, and after wiping off the splashes, she placed it on the coffee table in front of Ethan.

The group’s attention shifted from her to the bottle of water, which was, in fact, just a brand called “Mountain Spring,” known for its promise of purity and freshness. Who would have guessed that this seemingly ordinary bottle held something extraordinary?

Ethan wasn’t entirely convinced. He scrutinized the bottle for a long time before signaling for someone to take a sip first to prove it was harmless. Ivy had no intention of drinking what she jokingly referred to as 'duck's bath water,' so she poured a cup for Jake, urging him to drink it in front of Ethan.

Jake didn’t hesitate; after all, who would turn down water with supposed healing properties? He took a decisive gulp, nodding in approval. “Hmm, it’s pretty good, actually sweet.”

However, the effect wasn’t as intense as the first time—perhaps because he wasn’t injured this time.

Seeing Jake drink without hesitation, Ethan called one of his subordinates over to have a taste as well. The man gulped it down without a second thought, nodding rapidly, his expression stuck between wanting to say something and being at a loss for words. Ethan shot him a few incredulous glances before he finally took the half-empty bottle and hurried out, instructing Anna to entertain the guests while he dealt with something urgent.

Anna, not wanting to face several pairs of curious eyes, greeted them briefly and stood at the door, guarding it. Once Ethan was gone, Ivy whispered to Jake, “What on earth are you doing? When did lake water become a miracle drug? Are you trying to mess with Ethan?”

Jake was surprised by her reaction. As the owner of the space, she shouldn’t be unaware of the lake water's miraculous qualities. However, he understood that the lake water might not completely solve Ethan's troubles. He nodded calmly, saying, “Have you forgotten that the enhancement potion was successfully developed using lake water? It wouldn’t be wrong to call it 'spiritual water,' right? Besides, I did say to give it a try. How would we know if we don’t experiment?”

Ivy realized he had a point. Originally, she had planned to cooperate with the Longview Base using the ability awakening potion. If they could resolve it with lake water instead, why not? He needed the lake water, and it wouldn’t hurt to give him a couple more bottles.

The wait was unbearable. Among the four people standing behind her, Alex was the least professional, holding his ground for Ivy's sake, but now he seemed a bit bored and restless. Ivy pointed to the sofa on her left, urging them to sit down. They all realized they had no idea how long they would be waiting, so they settled in for the time being. With six people crammed onto a single couch, it was a bit tight.

Ivy felt like the filling in a sandwich, squeezed between Alex and Jake, feeling rather exasperated. But she had to endure; it wasn’t like she could just ditch her teammates.

As the minutes dragged on, it was getting late, and it was clear they would have to spend the night at Longview Base, or at least find a safe place to rest. Just as Alex was about to entertain them with a stand-up routine, the door suddenly burst open.

In rushed Ethan, looking flustered and out of breath. He approached Jake, saying, “Can the special medicine be provided continuously? As long as it can, I’ll agree to any conditions you set.”

Ivy exchanged glances with Jake, both knowing they had successfully struck a deal. However, Jake replied to Ethan, “Of course we can provide the special medicine, but we still need to mix the potion. We just gave you a bottle, and if you want more, you’ll have to wait.”

Ethan looked a bit helpless after hearing this but opted for caution instead of anger. He nodded and asked, “How long will it take?”

Jake turned to Ivy, realizing it was her turn to speak. After pondering for a moment, she replied, “I’m not sure about the patient’s condition; we can only prepare it based on the first dosage. What do the doctors say?”

Ethan immediately responded, “The doctor said it was effective and that the dosage should be increased.”

Ivy nodded. That half-bottle of mineral water had diluted the potion’s efficacy by half.

“An increase in dosage is possible. If it’s urgent, we can prepare it tonight, but we need to see your sincerity. Cooperation should be fair and just.”

Ethan, prioritizing the matter at hand, nodded eagerly, summoning Anna over to give her a series of instructions. She hurried off, while he called another subordinate to arrange for Jake and the others to have meals and accommodations, before dashing off again.

As they sat in a guest area having dinner, Ivy leaned closer to Jake and whispered curiously, “Can lake water really treat Ethan’s family’s illness?”

Jake was busy with the canned food and reheated rice they were served for dinner. Judging by the expressions of the Longview Base members, this was already considered quite a good meal.

“The last time I was injured, I coincidentally drank the lake water and healed immediately. I can confirm that the lake water has real healing effects. As for Ethan’s family’s illness, I had looked into it for him in my previous life. I have some understanding; healing-type abilities are ineffective against her illness.”

Ivy widened her eyes. “You’re so bold! Next time, let me know in advance. I’ll prepare a more impressive-looking bottle. This time I rushed it, and it looks too cheap.”

Jake chuckled and nodded in agreement.

After their meal, the subordinate assigned to host Jake took them to a converted office room on the ninth floor. It had been partitioned with beds, desks, and sofas, though there was no private bathroom. Given the time constraints, they couldn’t redesign the office like a post-apocalyptic fortress. Fortunately, Ivy could use her space to clean up, while the other guys were indifferent about using public restrooms.

Before they could rest for long, Ethan sent someone to hurry them along, asking if the medicine was ready yet.

Ivy glanced at her watch—it was just past eight o'clock—and replied that it was still being prepared. She told the messenger to come back in an hour and a half.

Jake understood her intention; since they had the upper hand, it was better not to rush. By delaying a little, they could make Ethan anxious while they remained calm.

At nine-thirty, they were called again. This time, Ivy filled two vials with the oral liquid, removing the outer packaging to make it look more upscale. When she handed it over, she felt quite professional.

As the messenger turned to leave, Ivy quickly added, “Make sure to relay to Ethan; don’t forget our request.”

The messenger paused for a moment, then nodded vigorously, acknowledging her before hurrying off.

Ivy was uncertain about how effective the lake water would be this time and whether it could truly heal Ethan’s family. The efficacy of this so-called special medicine still needed time to be tested.

However, she couldn’t afford to wait regarding the matter with David. What if he caught wind of their plans and fled? Or worse, what if he pulled something while they were preoccupied? Steeling herself to stay calm, she turned to prepare some serious firepower from her space, ready to spring into action at a moment’s notice.

In the dead of night, she was abruptly awakened by frantic knocking at the door. Since they were at Longview Base, it felt relatively safe, with only one team member left on night watch. However, at two in the morning, everyone was jolted awake.

Anna was outside, shouting urgently. She called out and rushed off without waiting for a reply. “We have a traitor in the base! Be careful!”

The sounds of hurried footsteps and distant gunfire, mixed with the crackle of abilities clashing, echoed through the air.

Jake had just gotten off the single bed when Ivy stepped out from the partition, already fully geared and ready to go. Well, she had been prepared for quite some time, hadn't she?
