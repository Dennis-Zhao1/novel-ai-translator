**Pearl Group's Divestment**

After sending out the message, she set her phone aside and focused on mingling with the crowd. The people gathered here were all seasoned players in the business world, each one calculating their moves, fully aware of the underlying intentions at play.

Linda Bennett didn’t lead the conversation; she simply expressed her gratitude for everyone’s concern and assured them she would handle things appropriately. However, what everyone truly feared was her "appropriate handling."

The share structure of the Pearl Group was straightforward: Linda Bennett held 82% of the shares, with the remaining 18% having been exchanged years ago by her grandfather for the sake of going public and for other business dealings. As the sole major shareholder, any small amount she chose to divest wouldn’t affect her control over the Pearl Group, yet it would allow others to benefit from a piece of the pie.

The immense value of the Pearl Group didn’t just stem from the market value of its products; it was also rooted in years of established brand reputation. Furthermore, there was the jade mine owned by the Bennett family in Myanmar, where each stone unearthed represented pure profit. Owning shares in the Pearl Group was akin to gaining free money—who could resist that?

Emotionally, Linda was reluctant to see the Pearl Group, a legacy from her grandfather, fall into someone else’s hands. Yet, the situation was dire, and she was genuinely running low on funds. Whether she could liquidate Pearl Group shares to recover her cash flow would directly impact her ability to settle the remaining payments for that batch of supplies from Saudi Arabia.

Originally, the funds were reserved for a doomsday bunker and stockpiling supplies, but those had long since been exhausted. Even if she could liquidate the gold and jewels from the intercepted shipment, and the prices remained favorable enough to cover the costs, there wouldn’t be enough left for anything else. Linda had a long list of items she wanted to stockpile.

The doomsday bunker was simply too expensive. Even splitting the costs with the Johnson family had her feeling financially strained, while the Johnson family seemed to navigate their affairs with ease, showcasing the advantages of a well-established family with deep pockets.

After a moment of internal lament, she steeled herself to face the crowd, maintaining the façade of a naïve young woman who appeared easy to manipulate.

“Linda, I've watched you grow up. With something as significant as the transfer of Pearl Group shares, how can your uncle just stand by and let you make hasty decisions? What if you get deceived?” A man with a receding hairline spoke earnestly, yet his tone gave off an air of superiority.

Linda refrained from responding, merely nodding obediently. Another man, catching the drift, chimed in, “Indeed, I was good friends with your father during our studies abroad. I can offer my advice too, dear.”

At this point, the room was buzzing with voices, each giving off the impression that their guidance was in her best interest. 

Linda lowered her eyes and noticed her phone ringing—it was a call from the Johnson family’s younger uncle. Instantly, her acting skills kicked in; she picked up the phone in a flustered manner, hesitating to answer. 

The man closest to her, the one with the receding hairline, swiftly reached over to hang up her phone. Receiving a grateful look from Linda, he felt a swell of pride, as if he had just saved the day.

“Don’t worry, dear. Your uncle is here to help. If you face any challenges, you can always count on me,” he said, adopting the tone of a comforting elder, trying to reassure the visibly flustered girl.

“Oh no,” Linda whimpered, her voice breaking as she recounted the situation clearly. It turned out that the reason she needed to sell her shares in the Pearl Group was due to cash flow issues. How could a princess who once had no money troubles suddenly find herself in such a predicament? It all traced back to the Johnson family’s youngest son, who had a greedy ambition and had siphoned off all her funds through a flashy doomsday amusement park project.

Coinciding with the upcoming jade stone gambling conference in Myanmar, Linda had also traded away other assets for some flashy yet useless items—a yacht, a helicopter, and reportedly even a high-end modified car that burned through cash like wildfire. 

After this series of transactions, especially considering that the Johnson family daughter had returned home, the two girls had basically been inseparable, leading everyone to believe this was a coordinated series of traps laid by the Johnson family against the Pearl Group.

“Such treacherous little schemers!” another uncle exclaimed angrily. He wasn’t genuinely upset for Linda’s plight; rather, he was frustrated that he hadn’t seized the opportunity himself.

He also began to doubt the rumors that old man Bennett had left networks to protect Linda. Given the current situation, it seemed highly unlikely. Otherwise, how could she lose everything so quickly just because she had been abroad for a few days, leading to cash flow issues and the need to liquidate her shares?

At this point, they felt they had to act quickly. Each uncle’s demeanor grew increasingly eager, their tones filled with warmth, akin to vendors enticing children with candy.

Watching their twisted expressions made Linda feel nauseated. She opted to ignore them, pretending to cry instead.

Just then, her secretary knocked and informed her that several more groups were requesting to meet with Linda and had been ushered into the adjacent conference room.

Wiping away her nonexistent tears, Linda apologized to her elders and headed into the next meeting room. The people inside were unfamiliar; she had seen them at the banquet but couldn’t place their businesses. After exchanging business cards, they stated their intentions.

Linda collected the cards, indicating that she was still considering her options for partners and needed time to weigh her choices carefully.

Both groups that had entered the room shared the same goal: they saw the young, inexperienced woman as easy prey without strong tactics or means to resist. They overlooked the fact that while she might seem simple, her competitors were far too formidable.

One representative from a leading construction company proposed a full buyout of all shares being offered by Pearl Group. Another representative from a prominent energy family echoed the same sentiment, declaring they could also take over.

Linda could never let her grandfather's Pearl Group slip away so easily. If she was going to seek excitement, she intended to follow through completely.

Soon, other industry representatives began to express their interest, but one in particular caught Linda’s attention. A man claiming to represent the leading home goods company spoke up. Linda scrutinized the business card and the representative’s appearance closely, quickly recognizing the name of Ethan Brooks’s company. 

This man was unfamiliar to her from her previous life, and she had hoped to encounter Ethan Brooks this time to see what he was like before the apocalypse. Yet, he was nowhere to be found, leaving Linda feeling a twinge of disappointment.

Seeing Linda’s change in expression, the man named Charles assumed he had misspoken. He worried that if the young lady took offense, she might abruptly cut off their potential collaboration, which would be disastrous since he had already promised old man Brooks success in this endeavor.

Linda quickly composed herself, ensuring the other party didn’t notice her momentary lapse. 

“Thank you all for your interest in the Pearl Group. I appreciate your sincerity, but the matter of collaboration requires further discussion,” she stated, summoning her secretary and assistant to arrange follow-up meetings before hurrying back to the adjacent room. 

As she opened the door, the group of people who had just exited the meeting room caught sight of the individuals seated inside and felt a jolt of surprise at the speed of these proceedings.
