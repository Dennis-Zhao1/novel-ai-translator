**Allies**

Just moments ago, Ivy was fuming, and now she was grinning—her moods changed faster than flipping through a TV channel.

Her mental resilience had grown, and all the turmoil she'd endured was still fresh in her mind, a bitter reminder linked to that ghastly zombie.

As she started to sense her surroundings, everything surprised her with vibrant colors. The mountains shimmered with a subtle yellow-green hue, the lake glimmered with a misty blue, and the trees and grass emitted a soft white light. As she glanced at her supplies, they appeared as gray shadows, but the treasures she had collected in her gallery radiated a brilliant array of colors.

All the animals in this realm cast faint red shadows, as if their lifeblood was visible. Even the lake had mysteriously sprouted tiny fish.

Ivy had never thought of using her mental power to explore the entire space. When she swept her gaze over the Mystic Mirror, she nearly blinded herself; the dazzling white light sparkled with a resplendent hue. It seemed that each time the space upgraded, the Mystic Mirror changed more dramatically. Last time, it had added a frame, then changed its skin, and now it was flaunting special effects.

What was this, a dress-up game for a premium member on a social platform?

Rubbing her stinging eyes, she withdrew her mental energy and settled back onto the couch, staring at the Mystic Mirror.

“I've leveled up my mental power. Did you level up too?” she asked the mirror.

The Mystic Mirror remained silent, and she didn’t think much of it. After a while, the screen displayed a message: “Not a level up, just a replenishment of energy.”

That must refer to those glowing orbs. After asking about them for ages and getting no response, she felt a wave of boredom wash over her and decided to exit the space.

When she emerged, she found herself lying on a hospital bed. As she sat up, the door swung open, and Ethan strode in. Upon seeing Ivy awake, he rushed over to embrace her, visibly relieved.

Jake followed closely behind but didn’t enter the room. Ivy felt a bit awkward upon seeing him and promptly pushed Ethan away.

“I’m fine, Ethan!” she exclaimed, winking at him. He understood the hint; they had an agreement to communicate discreetly about certain matters.

“Are you sure? Jake, come take a look,” Ethan called over his shoulder.

Only then did Jake step inside, raising his hand slightly. Ivy felt a surge of energy brush past her and instinctively blocked it. Jake's eyebrows shot up in surprise as he stared at her.

“Psychic ability?” Jake exclaimed in disbelief, his voice barely above a whisper. A dual-ability user? Ethan quickly put the pieces together; she had managed to evade the psychic attacks from the hooded zombie, indicating she possessed at least some potential in that area, as expected.

Ivy adopted a look that said, "As long as I'm not awkward, the awkwardness belongs to others," and nodded in acknowledgment.

Jake suddenly became excited, stepping forward to grip Ivy’s shoulder, but Ethan was quick to intervene, scolding him, “Hey, what are you doing? Keep your hands to yourself!”

Unfazed, Jake turned to Ivy, brimming with enthusiasm. “Can you check on my sister’s condition?”

Ivy was taken aback. Wasn’t he a psychic ability user himself? Why couldn’t he check? And wasn’t his sister sick due to a psychic issue?

“Isn’t your sister unwell?” she asked.

Jake sighed and recounted the bizarre circumstances surrounding his sister’s illness. Both Ivy and Ethan were left astounded. Jake’s sister, Emily, had also awakened her psychic abilities, but not long after, she had been attacked by unidentified assailants, leading to signs of damage to her psychic core. Initially, Jake's psychic abilities had not caused harm; instead, they had resulted from the exhaustion of trying to repair Emily’s core.

Now, with Emily's core still unrepaired and his own abilities compromised, he had to rely on other psychic users for assistance. In reality, Jake not only couldn't investigate but also desperately hoped that Ivy could help fix Emily’s core. He knew this request was somewhat unreasonable, so he refrained from voicing it.

After pondering for a moment, Ivy agreed, “I can take a look. That’s easy enough.”

Meanwhile, Jake was already considering what leverage he could use to ensure Ivy agreed to repair Emily’s core—something she couldn’t refuse.

Ivy had already walked over to Emily's hospital bed and raised her hand to sense. The core in Emily's mind appeared clearly before her. She noted the small, light purple core, which was covered in fine cracks. However, it was far from shattered.

Ivy voiced her concerns, and Jake was taken aback. “The core shows signs of recovery. No wonder her vital signs have stabilized,” he exclaimed. “She must have taken a special medicine to recover.”

It was a stroke of good luck; things were turning around. Jake called for a doctor, and the response confirmed that Emily was gradually improving, making him even more grateful to both Ivy and Ethan.

Watching Jake, who held Emily’s hand with tears of joy in his eyes, Ivy posed a question. “Emily was attacked by a psychic ability user, right? Doesn’t that make her situation similar to mine?”

Jake, unaware of who had attacked Ivy, suddenly connected the dots. Indeed, there were similarities; the only difference was the timing.

While everyone else was at the second level of abilities, Emily had been attacked, whereas Ivy had been struck when she was at the fourth level. If they were dealing with the same assailant, what could their motives be? As he pondered, Ivy dropped a bombshell that caught Jake completely off guard.

“I was attacked by a psychic zombie, and it can command a horde of zombies to attack cities. Who was behind your sister’s attack?”

“A psychic zombie?” Jake was incredulous but realized it was the only explanation for the inconsistencies they faced.

Ivy nodded, detailing the hooded zombie's physical characteristics and the specifics of the attack. Now that she was a psychic ability user, she was slowly grasping the nuances of psychic control and energy characteristics. The hooded zombie's ability level was at least at the fourth tier.

Fortunately, they both possessed psychic abilities; even if they couldn't control the zombies, they could at least resist the hooded zombie's attacks. She also mentioned that Max might be the instigator behind it all.

She hinted that Max had some peculiarities, likely making him the mastermind behind the zombie virus.

Jake furrowed his brow in thought. Until now, he had never had any interactions with Max, let alone for his sister. Before the apocalypse, they hadn’t crossed paths in the marketplace; after all, they weren’t on the same level, and Max had been relatively unknown at that time.

Jake quickly deduced that Max might be attempting to use the zombie virus to control humanity and profit from selling the antidote. However, his imagined scenario was far from reality.

Ivy and Ethan couldn’t straightforwardly reveal the outlandish truth about Max having a system. It would be better to wait for the right moment to hint at it, allowing Jake to figure it out on his own.

Fortunately, Jake noted down the grievance from that night—Max attempting to kidnap Emily to coerce him had crossed a line. It was a sensitive area for Jake, and he wouldn’t let it slide easily.

Anyone who dared to harm Emily deserved to face consequences.
