**Counting Assets and Finding Buyers**

After an unexpectedly good night’s sleep, Ivy Sterling woke up with a faint smile on her lips, a rarity in the chaotic world she found herself in. Normally, she struggled to find restful slumber, but this morning was different.

As Mrs. Smith arrived to help prepare breakfast, Ivy flashed an apologetic smile when she opened the door. Mrs. Smith, having received a generous holiday bonus, beamed with delight, pouring her heart into cooking a sumptuous meal while Ivy washed up, savoring the moment.

Looking into the mirror, Ivy observed her reflection. She didn’t quite resemble a fragile flower, but the innocence in her eyes had been replaced by a fierce determination. Hidden beneath the glimmer of her gaze was the fire of revenge—a stark contrast to her past self.

Determined not to raise any suspicions, she finished breakfast and headed to the office as usual. Once the elevator descended to the parking garage, Ivy was greeted by an impressive lineup of over twenty luxury cars. A sense of satisfaction washed over her; her assets were multiplying. She snapped a panoramic photo and sent it to her assistant, reminding him not to overlook these vehicles during the asset inventory.

Her assistant, still on his way to the office, couldn't help but exclaim in awe at the sight of so many luxury cars. For him, it was not merely a collection of vehicles; it represented a playground of dreams.

Casually, she picked a key from the rack, eager to experience the thrill of opening a mystery box. To her surprise, it was a stunning chameleon-blue Ferrari, the kind so low to the ground that it would scrape against any speed bump.

In her mind, plans were already forming. She envisioned selling these cars to swap them for robust models like Jeep Wranglers and Hummers, which were essential for surviving the early days of any disaster. There was no room for hesitance; the challenges outside required formidable protection.

Jotting down her thoughts in a memo, she switched to a sleek business sedan before heading to the office. The familiar frustration of rush hour traffic greeted her, and despite her intentions to set an example as the boss, she arrived a tad late.

But who cared? She was the boss, after all, with no clock to punch and no one daring to question her. With a sense of lightness, she entered the company building.

The security guard had already parked her car for her. As she headed for the direct elevator, she noticed her assistant and a group of staff already gathered in the conference room, waiting.

Holding a thick stack of asset reports, her assistant’s eyes were dark with fatigue, but his voice was lively as he briefed her on their domestic assets, which spanned eighty percent of the industry. Some holdings were fully owned, while others were stakes in various enterprises.

There were also numerous overseas assets that her father had acquired during his study abroad years, including farms, livestock, cross-border e-commerce ventures, and even a castle estate.

The last item caught her off guard—what on earth was a castle? Even after so many years, she had never heard of it, let alone seen it. A memory flickered back to her fifth birthday when she had wished to celebrate in a castle. Perhaps this was a birthday gift her father had intended but never delivered.

Wiping away the sudden mist in her eyes, she noticed her assistant's keen gaze catching the moment—he couldn’t comprehend why the mention of the castle would bring tears. Surely, it wasn’t because of its value; a wealthy boss like her wouldn’t fret over numbers.

But even this slight emotional detour didn’t hinder her assistant’s reporting. With the new luxury cars and properties under her name, Ivy Sterling was beginning to grasp the vastness of her inherited wealth.

Most valuations were rough estimates based on purchase prices and current market values, so they were likely undervalued. A professional asset appraisal would be necessary to determine the precise figures.

For now, Ivy was content with a preliminary valuation. With her hundred-billion-dollar assets, the items on her list seemed manageable.

The real challenge lay in liquidating everything swiftly, without drawing too much attention. Such operations needed to be discreet yet legitimate.

After the meeting, she instructed her assistant to compile a complete inventory of her fully-owned and partially-owned assets, cross-referencing them with companies and entrepreneurs she had quietly investigated over time.

Back in her top-floor office, sipping coffee brewed by her secretary, a brilliant idea struck her regarding the luxury cars.

The Sterling family had long been a prominent name in the capital, and although the offspring of her family had varying degrees of education and character, they all shared one undeniable trait—a passion for cars.

Even though she was just a girl and not as obsessed with cars as the boys, her garage was filled with limited-edition beauties—over twenty vehicles in total. She could easily host a luxury car exhibition by herself.

Even in the post-chaotic world, luxury vehicles could still be found within secured bases, but they were limited to the enclosed area. The outside world was far too perilous.

Ivy gazed at the photos, deciding to keep her favorites—the ones gifted by her grandfather and father—while finding suitable buyers for the rest.

Those wealthy heirs who had once envied her were the perfect candidates! Talk about a minimal effort return; this was it.

She lamented on her social media about her garage being too small, and instantly, a swarm of interested parties buzzed around her post, eager to inquire.

With the influx of inquiries, Ivy took the plunge and created a group chat. Everyone knew each other within the wealthy circle, but those who joined were clearly bewildered.

Imitating the tactics used by online sellers, she tossed in a few virtual gifts, prompting the confused heirs to throw in their own. Ivy couldn’t even collect her own payouts before finding that she had received more than she'd given away.

The chat exploded with messages, filled with people fighting to grab virtual gifts, all while spamming stickers of gratitude toward their “boss.”

Once the frenzy subsided, someone finally asked, “What’s this group for?”

With a leisurely tone, Ivy Sterling replied, “This is the group for my luxury cars looking for new homes.” Within moments, the group name morphed into “Luxury Cars Seeking New Owners.”

The crowd was left speechless.

Ivy chuckled, “Didn’t you all say that cars are a man’s second wife? Well, these are my precious daughters—what’s the problem with that?”

Her antics were undeniably bold, akin to a masterstroke of wit.

Not bothering with anyone’s opinions, she proceeded to label each car with charming names: from the eldest daughter to the twenty-third sister.

The group’s members were left in disbelief.

They recognized her audacity; no one could outdo her when it came to creativity.

Then, one astute member pointed out three unnamed cars in the photos, asking, “What about these three girls?”

Ivy scanned the images and replied, “These sweethearts are staying with me for now; I’m not parting with them. Those with names should hurry and check them out—if someone snatches them first, it won't be my fault.”

Although she had gathered potential buyers in one group, openly discussing prices there wouldn’t work. After a moment’s thought, she established a simple rule:

“Let’s do this: starting with the eldest daughter, if you’re interested, type ‘1’ in the chat. If not, please refrain from commenting. I want to gauge your sincerity; if you’re not serious, I’ll boot you from the group.”

Once she saw no objections, she continued, “You should know my cars better than I do. Each of them has been carefully selected and maintained. For those interested, type ‘1’ and share at least one positive trait about my girls—let’s keep it real. After all, no one wants their daughter to end up with a jerk.”

The group remained silent, caught between amusement and disbelief.
