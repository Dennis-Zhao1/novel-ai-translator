**Zombie Siege**

As Lou Bennett pulled out the black box and opened the heat weapon set, the zombies below the city tower started piling up like an unstoppable tide, climbing upward.

They surged forth in a dense mass, reminiscent of a locust swarm, with the attacks of the ability-enhanced zombies radiating an eerie glow, as if they intended to flatten everything in their path.

Some members of the guard team had never faced such a situation before; their bodies trembled with fear, faces pale, and their minds raced with thoughts of escape. However, the zombies gave them no opportunity for retreat. Various supernatural abilities were already being unleashed by Zoe Young and her fellow ability users.

The captain of the guard, a retired military officer named Jack, had experienced war and possessed strong psychological resilience. Although he lacked supernatural powers, his leadership skills were solid. He barked out several commands, and despite their fear, the guard team instinctively followed orders and opened fire.

Lou manipulated the joystick, her fingers dancing across the buttons with surprising calm. It was as if she were a DJ at a festival; some background music would have been perfect.

The frenzied zombies attacking the city tower looked like revelers in a dance club. The bullets and shells from the heat weapons, combined with the dazzling lights from supernatural abilities, created an atmosphere akin to a light show.

The sounds of gunfire—rat-a-tat-tat, boom, pew pew, kaboom—intertwined into a captivating melody, lacking any real rhythm yet somehow exhilarating.

Suddenly, a thought crossed her mind, and Lou propped her phone against the city tower, switching it to video mode.

She pressed every button on the black box, watching as the ammunition count steadily dwindled to zero, realizing the heat weapon set would soon need to withdraw.

Yet the zombies below showed no signs of diminishing. Thousands upon thousands continued to surge forward, and everyone recognized the severity of this assault; it was not something that could be easily resolved.

In times of desperation, human courage often emerges.

As Lou moved towards the guard team while unleashing her abilities, she noticed that their ammunition was nearly depleted. Just as Jack began to worry, he spotted a military supply box that had appeared at his feet. His eyes widened in disbelief—was this real?

The guard member supplying ammunition darted back and forth, glancing at the dazed captain and rolling his eyes in disdain. Jack often lectured them fiercely, boasting of his battle-hardened experience and invincibility, yet here he was, frozen in fear during a zombie siege.

Pathetic, he thought to himself. With the battle so intense, he couldn’t even manage to help with ammunition supplies.

Unable to hold back, he shoved the captain aside and bent down to grab a box of ammunition. This action snapped Jack back to reality, and he didn’t dwell on the breach of discipline; instead, he looked at Lou with admiration and respect.

Feeling a bit embarrassed under his gaze, Lou considered conjuring a missile launcher out of thin air. But seeing it wouldn’t fit, she quickly retracted it, nearly losing her balance and almost tumbling off the city tower.

Jack was left dumbfounded, the emotional turmoil inside him robbing him of his ability to speak.

Lou patted his shoulder, muttering a word of encouragement, and without further explanation, she left him with more ammunition and slipped away.

Staying there any longer, she wouldn’t be able to keep up her act.

When the returning squad member noticed Jack standing blankly in a different position, he rolled his eyes. He resolved to write an anonymous letter to report the captain after the battle, claiming he had been dazed during the fight—a clear sign of inadequate mental fortitude.

Lou returned to the front lines, taking the place of several exhausted ability users. Her Storm Ice Needles had already been unleashed, intertwining with Ethan Blake's electric net, and zombies fell in droves. Even so, the energy cores had been replenished three times, and the pile of zombie corpses had risen nearly half a tower high, yet the zombies kept coming.

It felt as though every zombie in the city of Washington had made their way to this spot. At that moment, Ethan moved closer to her, his hands busy, and remarked, “These zombies seem to be controlled by someone. Generally, higher-level ability zombies show some intelligence; they wouldn’t recklessly charge at us. But these zombies, regardless of the danger, are acting far too irrationally.”

Lou realized he was right. She carefully observed the expressions and gaze of the ability-enhanced zombies, especially the mutated ones. Indeed, she noticed a flicker of struggle and desire to escape in their eyes just before they were hit, yet their bodies charged forward fearlessly, as if bound by an unbreakable will.

During their missions, they had noticed that mutated zombies would sometimes flee if they couldn’t win—some would maneuver away, while others would outright run. But regardless, it was a sign of intelligence, not the reckless behavior they were witnessing now.

Continuing to scan the horde, Lou utilized her keen eyesight and finally spotted a male zombie in a gray hoodie, half of his face rotting away. His behavior stood out amongst the frenzied horde; while the others pushed forward in a chaotic frenzy, this one remained eerily calm, hands tucked into his hoodie pockets, staring blankly at the ground as if lost in thought.

As if sensing her gaze, he suddenly lifted his head, his eyes hidden beneath the hoodie locking onto hers. Lou couldn’t discern his expression or eye color; they appeared as two black voids, endless and deep, almost drawing her in. She involuntarily took a step forward when Ethan suddenly grabbed her arm, jolting her back to reality. She realized one foot was dangling in the air, the other precariously balanced on the tower, and she quickly retreated two steps in alarm.

Ethan frowned, asking what she had seen. Lou looked up again, but the gray-hooded man had vanished.

Megan also sensed something was off with her; if it hadn’t been for Ethan, she might have fallen.

He prepared to catch her if she lost her footing, then shifted his focus to attacking the relentless horde of zombies.

Lou was perplexed by her earlier behavior—after meeting that gaze, she felt an irresistible urge to approach, yet her mind had gone blank. With no time to ponder, she resumed unleashing her powers, attacking the zombies.

Most of her stored ammunition had been exhausted, including what she had taken from the Forest Base and Green Tea Gin, and the heat weapon set had reached zero.

The guard team had rotated two shifts, their arms sore and numb. Some ability users who had exhausted their energy were using energy cores to recover before stepping in to help. Otherwise, the guard team would have been overwhelmed.

Zoe and the others faced similar challenges; several were quickly dragged away after being injured by the zombies’ abilities for Zoe's brother to treat.

At the moment when the last zombie was about to climb the city tower, it was decapitated with one swift strike and fell back into the mountain of corpses. Everyone collapsed to the ground, eyes glazed over, heads buzzing.

This apocalyptic defense battle had lasted a full day and night, finally concluding as dawn broke on the second day.

As everyone regained their senses, a cheer erupted in unison. They had won the defense battle, with no casualties—the worst injury was a shoulder pierced by an ability, but with Zoe's brother's healing, it had already stopped bleeding and was healing.

This was a resounding victory for the base in the apocalypse. Many embraced each other, and even Lou was hugged by several people. The first to wrap her in his arms was Ethan, followed by Megan, who pulled both of them into a tight embrace. Anna, Zoe, and various familiar and unfamiliar ability users, along with members of the guard team, joined in the growing circle.

The group hug expanded, getting larger and larger, with more and more people joining in, some even jumping up and down as they cheered. In the center of this hugging mass, Lou found herself tightly squeezed, unable to move. Her forehead rested against Ethan's chest, her heart racing wildly, the air being squeezed from her lungs, and the suffocating sensation made her head spin.

Inside, Lou thought: I want to escape so badly, but I can’t.
