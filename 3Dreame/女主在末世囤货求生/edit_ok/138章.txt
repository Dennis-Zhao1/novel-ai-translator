**Betraying Teammates**

Life had settled into a new routine for Mike as he trained the latest recruits at the base, while occasionally mentoring Sarah. Some days, he would also take Alex aside for additional lessons, but over time, Sarah had grown less envious. Their moments together were still brief.

However, the curious eyes within the community missed nothing. Many were watching Sarah, and soon rumors began to circulate — Sarah had a crush on Alex, and Linda liked him too. But who did Alex actually have feelings for?

When Alex heard the rumors, he was baffled. If every time Linda called him away and Sarah gave him a pointed look, it meant he was "liked," or if accompanying Linda to the lab for tests counted as affection, he’d rather not be "liked" at all.

Yet, he had no one to share his frustrations with; no one seemed to understand his plight.

Meanwhile, outside, Jack was equally frustrated. Sam was exceptionally good at staying hidden. Jack had visited every rumored hideout, only to find them empty. He often arrived just after Sam had left, finding only lingering traces of his presence.

Someone must have been tipping off Sam; after searching for over a week, Jack hadn’t even caught a glimpse of him. Lisa was so furious she muttered curses under her breath.

As the deadline with the Longhorn Base approached, Jack realized he couldn’t keep chasing Sam’s shadow and could only hope for good news from his reliable contact.

The group arrived at Longhorn Base, where the zombie numbers had significantly decreased. While chatting, Paul jokingly teased Jack, but the implications were unsettling. In this post-apocalyptic world, the number of living humans was dwindling, mostly concentrated in various bases. Zombies had cores and were becoming more agile. With over a billion people in the country, the number of survivors was minuscule compared to the overwhelming zombie population.

Lost in thought, Jack was interrupted again. This time, Lily approached. Ever since the announcement of the expedition team, Lily had been on a high, her once meek demeanor now barely concealing her new arrogance.

She was convinced she would awaken supernatural powers and become a formidable force, imagining a future where men would flock to her, with both Paul and Jack at her feet.

This trip to Longhorn Base allowed for twenty people, and aside from Lily, the other nineteen were Paul’s trusted confidants. They boarded a large bus in an orderly manner. After saying goodbye to Paul and taking his share of the spoils — a big bag of crystal cores — Jack drove off.

Paul initially felt a twinge of jealousy, but he quietly reassured Lily, calming her down. Watching Lily sit in the front row of the bus, full of herself, Paul struggled to suppress his laughter.

Paul shook his head at her antics, signaling not to be too obvious. Soon after, Paul adopted a dramatically upset expression, which only made Lily more smug.

Lisa, on the other hand, wanted nothing to do with the drama. As long as Lily kept her distance, her passive-aggressive tendencies remained stable.

The journey from the city to the stronghold was lengthy, particularly with poor road conditions and the occasional aggressive zombies that needed clearing before they could pass. On the bus, aside from the driver, everyone else was ordinary people who rarely ventured outside the base. They watched, both fearful and envious, as the supernatural beings battled zombies outside.

Especially Lily, who pressed her face against the window, eager to see Jack in action against the zombies. Though she pretended to be merely curious, her eyes betrayed a longing to witness the heroics.

Just as she was about to get a good look, Lisa blocked her view, causing her expression to darken immediately. The others on the bus were too engrossed in watching the supernatural beings handle the zombies to notice Lily’s mood.

Though only a few zombies appeared, even if they were stronger, they were no match for an ability user like Jack. Before long, the driver started the bus again, following the lead vehicle toward the stronghold.

Lily still wanted to find a way to sit next to Jack and ideally swap Lisa for herself. But the bus came to a halt again. They had reached a toll station at the border of two cities, where a small group of zombies wandered nearby. Lily rested her chin on her hand, lost in thought.

The vehicle moved intermittently, and after several stops, it grew dull. The people on the bus fell silent, resting, while the driver, being an ability user, stayed alert, ready to protect the passengers.

Seeing the driver step out, Lily suddenly had a bright idea. She thought it would be delightful to surprise Jack. So, she quietly exited the bus and headed straight for his modified vehicle.

The two vehicles were still a good thirty feet apart when a zombie suddenly lunged out from the roadside, heading straight for Lily. She screamed in terror and ran back as fast as she could.

Her scream drew the attention of both Jack’s group and the zombie. Lisa had been engaged with a metal-type zombie, finding it quite challenging. She couldn’t help but appreciate Lily’s audacity; while insufferable, she was also quite bold in the face of danger.

Jack thought to himself that at this distance, even if he could strike the zombie with a lightning bolt, it might not kill it. Besides, Lily would surely get scratched or bitten before he could intervene.

Surprisingly, this reckless woman wasn’t just bold; she was also lucky. The bus driver was stationed at the back, keeping an eye out for any zombies that might approach from behind. When he saw Lily sneak off, he planned to stop her but hadn’t even had the chance to shout before she was already sprinting back.

He intended to intercept her and urge her to return to the bus, but instead, Lily yanked him in front of her, placing him between herself and the zombie. The driver, caught off guard, didn’t even have time to unleash his abilities before the zombie clawed at his neck. He managed to kick the creature away, unleashing fire abilities to fend off the zombies approaching him.

The driver was nearly in despair, hoping to retreat to the bus for safety, but when he turned, he found the door slammed shut. Lily had rushed back to the bus and was now frantically searching for the button to close the driver’s door, completely disregarding his safety.

As the chaos unfolded, Jack and his team reacted swiftly, witnessing the driver get injured. They quickly dispatched the nearby zombies and turned to see the driver’s pale face, the wound already turning a sickly shade of blue, and the bus door sealed tight.

Lisa was furious, barely able to stifle her laughter.

The deputy team leader and his men quickly began extracting crystal cores. Jack pulled out an antidote from his pocket and administered it to the injured driver. He then walked up and knocked on the bus door.

After knocking for a while with no response, Lisa frowned, peering through the bus window. Inside, she saw Lily desperately blocking the door button, while the ordinary passengers, startled, tried to pull her away. Her frenzied demeanor left them stunned, and for a moment, no one dared to approach her.

The driver, having received the antidote, felt a wave of relief wash over him. He could sense a strange energy coursing through him due to the injury, leaving him weak and powerless. If it weren’t for Jack carrying the antidote, he’d likely have been turned into a zombie by now.

The driver had previously worked for Paul, and their relationship was good. He got along well with Paul’s trusted aides; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been assigned to this mission. Yet, he never expected that a mere Lily would betray him, and even more infuriating, she had the gall to turn against him after receiving help.
