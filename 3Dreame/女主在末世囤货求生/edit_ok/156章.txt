Awakening

After gently placing Ethan onto the bed in the bedroom, Ivy surveyed the room. It was impeccably clean, as she expected; dust never dared to settle here, and the bed linens were pristine and neatly arranged.

Ivy reached out to touch Ethan's forehead, only to find his pale cheeks glistening with beads of sweat. He didn’t have a fever; in fact, his temperature felt a bit low. His brows were slightly furrowed, and his lips were tightly pressed together, indicating that he wasn’t feeling well.

She examined the scars on his arms closely; they were still a dark, deep crimson, and the veins on his arms had taken on a purplish hue, suggesting that he was suffering from severe poisoning.

Ivy offered him a bit of water to drink, then stepped outside to consult the system about his condition.

"Don’t worry, Ivy! Ethan is fine; that little bit of poison is nothing—just let him sleep it off!" 

The lively spirit, along with the long-missed Alex, was catching up when Ivy interrupted them. Although the lively spirit dared to challenge Ethan, it wouldn’t dare to confront Ivy—after all, she was the master of Alex. It was too late to curry favor; it certainly didn’t want to risk its own existence.

Seeing the lively spirit's reassurances, Ivy felt a wave of relief wash over her; the heavy feelings that had been weighing her down lightened considerably.

She recalled how someone had sacrificed for her in her past—a friend named Mike had made her feel guilty for a long time, and now Ethan’s situation was forcing her to relive those emotions.

It really wasn’t pleasant.

Given the difference in time flow between this space and the outside world, she had no idea when Ethan would wake up. So, she grabbed his phone and quickly stepped out to call Mike.

"Mike, how’s everything on your end? No issues, right?"

"Hey Ivy, everything's fine here. Don't worry. How’s the place holding up?"

"It’s okay. Can you pass the phone to Dr. Carter?"

"Sure, I’ll get him—hold on a moment."

Moments later, Dr. Carter’s groggy voice came through the line.

"Ivy, what’s happened?"

"Ethan's injured from a mutated plant. I administered an antidote and a specialized drug, but his condition isn't great. He's sweating cold and has a low temperature. Do you have any good remedies?"

"So serious? The antidote has been upgraded and optimized; it should effectively neutralize standard viruses. The specialized drug is on him, so typical poisons shouldn’t be an issue. However, if he doesn’t improve in three hours, it could become problematic."

"Are there any other options?"

"Do you have any samples of the mutated plant? I think John and I can make it back in time."

Dr. Carter was about to call John into action when Ivy interrupted him.

"Don’t rush off on your own; it’s safer to stay with everyone. I’ll find a way to handle Ethan’s situation. I’ll inform you when it’s safe to return, and then you can arrange to come back. Please pass the phone back to Mike; thanks."

"Hey Ivy, did something happen to Ethan? Are you alright?"

Mike must have overheard part of the conversation, sounding a bit anxious.

"Yeah, he was injured while protecting me, but I’m fine. Listen, if nothing else unusual happens by dawn tomorrow, I’ll notify you, and you can come back. Until then, keep everyone safe, especially the researchers. Don’t go anywhere."

"Understood."

Ivy didn’t say much more before hanging up. She found Jeff and Mr. Carter, instructing them to clean up after the battle and arrange a duty roster before heading back to rest. Once back in her dorm, she entered her space again.

Ethan was still in the same state, with cold sweat dotting his forehead and his lips growing paler. His breathing had become much lighter. Seeing this, Ivy felt a sense of urgency and quickly went out to find the lively spirit.

"Do you have any antidote items over there?"

"Ivy, Ethan is really fine! You have to believe me; just let him lie there. Why don’t we three chat? It’s rare for us to be together. Shall we play some card games?"

The screen was filled with subtitles sent by the lively spirit. Alex chimed in as well.

"Don’t worry; I’ve checked him. He’s okay."

"Right? If you don’t believe me, how can you not believe Alex? Come on, let’s chat and play cards! I've got some juicy gossip to share about our..."

Ivy finally understood Ethan’s helplessness. With such a chatty system around, it was impressive that someone as reserved as Ethan could tolerate it for so long.

To occupy her time and distract herself from the pale-faced man, she found some chores to do, forcing her mind away from worrying.

After collecting all the eggs from the yard—chicken, duck, and goose eggs—neatly packing them into boxes, she realized that not much time had passed.

She practiced her new skill, Ice Barrier, realizing there was still a lot of room for improvement in the speed of releasing this area-of-effect attack. She thought about ways to combine it with other skills for different attack methods, which could lead to explosive damage.

Thinking of Ethan, she boiled some hot water to bring to him, grabbing a towel to wipe the cold sweat from his forehead.

Suddenly, she felt utterly incompetent at taking care of someone. It dawned on her that she hadn’t even taken off Ethan's shoes. Embarrassed, she shook her head. She had always been the one being taken care of; it wasn't intentional.

Feeling a bit slow on the uptake, she finally removed his shoes and tossed them aside, contemplating whether to cover him with a blanket. However, the temperature in the space was quite pleasant—not too cold or hot—so she decided it was fine not to.

Less trouble was better than more trouble.

In a matter of moments, she wiped down Ethan’s face, head, and hands, and he looked much more refreshed. With a clear conscience, she stepped outside.

After enduring a long night of fuss, she was feeling tired. Looking at the only bed she had, she decided to curl up on the sofa for a nap.

It wasn’t that she couldn’t sleep outside, but she was worried about what might happen if something went wrong.

Fortunately, when she woke up, Ethan was also regaining consciousness. He noticed the distinct scar on his arm; it had faded from dark red to a lighter red, and the wound didn’t hurt anymore. The area around it had a faint brown tint, indicating it had been disinfected with iodine.

As he surveyed his surroundings, a sense of familiarity washed over him, yet everything felt strange. The house seemed fine, but the furnishings were all off.

Finally, spotting the words “Museum” made him understand. He got up, put on his shoes, and stepped outside, only to find Ivy asleep on the sofa.

He couldn’t help but chuckle. Only she could pull off something so quirky, having brought her house into this space. Remembering his own dark, empty space, he couldn’t help but scold the lively spirit in his mind.

Oh right, the lively spirit was probably ecstatic now; it had been pestering him to let it back into the space to play with Alex. Now it had finally gotten its wish, no wonder it hadn’t responded to his calls.

Ivy was a light sleeper. As soon as she sensed someone watching her, she jolted awake and saw Ethan standing there, fully intact. She shot up in excitement, quickly slipping into her cute slippers and hurriedly walking over.

"You’re alright? How do you feel? Is there anywhere else that hurts?"

"I’m fine now, so don’t worry. The antidote worked effectively."

As Ethan observed Ivy, he spoke in a soothing tone that he didn’t even realize was tender.

"Not just the antidote; there was also the water. I fed you that several times! At first, you were clenching your lips so tight I nearly couldn’t get it down your throat."

Ivy murmured, teasing him lightly. Ethan fell silent for a moment before nodding. As a former special forces soldier, he had learned during training that it was best to keep his mouth tightly shut when unconscious—who knew what enemies might pour into him.
