**Mobile Arms Dealer**

Ethan had essentially transformed into a mobile arms dealer's equipment warehouse—anything you wanted, he had it. Even Alex and the others, despite their usual obliviousness, sensed something was off. However, they kept their mouths shut; there was no point in prying. Knowing too much could be detrimental, and honestly, it wouldn’t change anything.

Chloe watched her naive friend with a knowing smile. She had picked up on the clues back when Lily started collaborating with her grandfather. It was all for their benefit, after all. A true best friend doesn’t dig into secrets but instead stands guard and helps cover them up.

Soon, they found themselves on the stairs of the fire escape. It felt like a trick of the mind—stepping onto the landing seemed to increase the number of zombies above them exponentially. They couldn’t help but wonder how many of those things were being kept up there, like some twisted farm.

“The stairs have a sensor. Stay alert and destroy them if you see any!” Ethan commanded, and the group nodded in understanding. Even though they knew about the sensors, there was no time to search for them with a horde of zombies coming at them from above.

“I refuse to believe we can’t kill them all! Aaaah!” Alex suddenly shouted, his voice echoing in the tight space. If Samantha were here, she would have definitely berated him for his outburst. Chloe had no intention of indulging his bad habits.

“If you think there aren’t enough zombies, shout louder! You’ll attract every single one of them!” she snapped.

Alex ignored her, firing wildly at the approaching zombies. Annoyed by the limbs strewn on the ground, he used his wind-based abilities to whip up a tornado that sent the disgusting remains flying.

Lily’s eyes lit up as she grabbed Alex by the arm. “Aim your tornado at the walls and floor of the hallway—make it destructive, but don't destroy the stairs!”

Alex nodded, gathering his strength before unleashing several powerful gusts of wind. Following the trail of the wind, Lily carefully scanned the area and finally spotted the sensors nestled in the dead angle of the handrail, the wires buried in the wall.

With a single shot, she disabled the sensor, and the effect was immediate—zombies flooding down the stairs slowed significantly. However, many more were still stuck in the hallway, blocking their way. It felt like they were wedged in a tight spot, but Ethan quickly found a good angle and began clearing the path.

He focused on the zombies descending from above, while Lily and the others dealt with those trying to ascend. They were protected by the walls on either side, which provided at least a temporary reprieve from the relentless undead.

As the bodies piled up, the stench became unbearable. Thankfully, Alex was there to clear the air with his abilities; otherwise, they might have suffocated in the stairwell.

Lily fished out isolation masks from her storage space—made of a new material that blocked out foul odors and bacteria. They distributed the masks, putting them on along with protective goggles. Instantly, the air felt fresher, and their spirits lifted considerably.

What began as frantic, chaotic attacks transformed into a coordinated effort under Lily’s leadership. The group found themselves able to spare moments to assist Ethan as well.

Before long, Ethan had cleared the zombies descending the stairs, but the hallway was now littered with debris, and the sensation of squishing bodies beneath their feet was far from pleasant.

He took a moment to check the system shop, hoping to find suitable footwear, but to his dismay, there were no decent options. The combat gear mainly consisted of clothing and boots that didn’t seem as comfortable as what they were already wearing.

Lily nearly slipped on the slick remains as she sifted through her storage. She vaguely remembered stashing away some outdoor gear that included non-slip shoes. After rummaging for a while, she finally found them—anti-slip spikes that could be directly fitted over shoes. They were small and only covered the forefoot, but she slipped on a pair and felt a satisfying grip on the floor.

She shared a few more with the others, and Ethan recognized that these were designed for climbing and extreme sports—perfect for their current predicament.

With stable footing came newfound confidence, and soon, the hallway was littered with the corpses of zombies.

Maintaining the same stance for too long was tiring, and Alex and Chloe couldn’t help but recall their previous encounter during the zombie siege.

“Let’s keep our spirits up! There’s definitely a finite number of zombies. Why not make it a game? See who can shoot straight and take out the most!” Lily encouraged, recalling the giant monstrosity they had dealt with yesterday. Today, it was the zombies' turn, and she couldn’t escape this densely packed world.

In fact, Alex and Luke had already silently begun their own competition, driven by that inexplicable male urge to compete.

As Ethan led them upward, he noted the increasing number of zombie corpses piling up on the upper levels. He pondered how to clear them quickly when he saw Luke halt his contest with Alex to help Ethan clear the blockage in the stairwell.

His method was direct—using his abilities to move the debris out the window. He found that this power acted like an invisible hand, allowing him to accomplish many tasks if controlled properly.

Before long, they reached the second floor. The door to the fire escape stood wide open, revealing an environment typical of office buildings, except that biological tech companies often had labs.

Lily approached, observing the new equipment warily, but she hesitated to touch anything. If this was indeed a trap set by their enemies, everything here could be dangerous.

She cautioned the others not to touch anything and urged them to continue ascending if they didn’t find any humans.

The zombies below were still relentless, merely held off by Luke and the others.

As they made their way up, it appeared that they hadn’t triggered any sensors on the second flight of stairs—no waves of zombies surged forth.

Lily paused. Could it be she was relying too much on her usual logic? Normally, in this situation, they would expect the sensors to activate and unleash a new wave of mutated zombies to eradicate them entirely.

It was odd—something that should have been predictable hadn’t occurred. The group exchanged puzzled glances but continued their ascent.

“Something’s not right,” Lily thought, her vigilance heightened compared to the others, who were more relaxed.

Her instincts proved correct as they arrived at the second-level landing, greeted by a sea of crazed sea urchins. Lily realized this was the second layer of danger.

“Help! I have a phobia of being in tight spaces!” Chloe cried out, her voice dripping with feigned despair, even as she launched into action with a vengeance.

Her posture seemed to scream, “You little pests don’t deserve to die beneath my feet!”

With the crazed sea urchins above and zombies below, Lily decided to leave the lower level to Alex, Luke, and Chloe, while she and Ethan tackled the threats above.

The sea urchins remained quiet until they sensed humans nearby. Then, they surged forward like wolves catching the scent of meat, eager to leap onto the unsuspecting prey.

“Ethan, looks like we need to use the Flame Dragon!” Lily declared, pulling out her fireproof gear.

Ethan nodded, providing her cover as she donned the suit. Once both were ready, he turned to Alex and the others. “We’re going to set these little nuisances ablaze. You all stay here and keep the zombies at bay—don’t let them come up!”

The group nodded, too focused to look back at Lily.

“Let’s do this!” Ethan said, and the two raised the Flame Dragon in unison, preparing to unleash their fiery assault.

“What on earth is that?!”
