**The Charm of Spicy Strips**

Chris leaned back in his chair, observing the man across from him with a calm demeanor. "Where there's business, there's profit. You can't turn your back on money, right, my friend?" he said with a slight nod.

The man in the suit raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised by Chris's words. Without further ado, he motioned for his assistant to bring over the goods. Lily Barton, Chris's reliable partner, opened her bag, cleverly disguised as a regular tote, and handed the documents to her bodyguard, Mike.

The spacious office made sense now—it was perfect for the task at hand. The guards, standing at attention along the walls, were a necessary precaution in this high-stakes deal. In Chris's line of work, betrayal was a constant threat, and he had seen his fair share over the years.

This particular batch of goods was larger than usual, taking longer to verify. As evening approached, Mike swiftly confirmed the contents, and Lily personally sealed the boxes with her family's unique seal. Even Chris, seasoned as he was, found the seal intriguing.

The man in the suit appeared to recognize Lily’s background—a wealthy American with a flair for business. His team was responsible for transporting the goods to the port, where the Smith family representatives awaited. Once everything was secured, Lily discreetly observed Chris. His features, a blend of Middle Eastern and Caucasian, contrasted with his brother's purely Caucasian appearance. Despite calling each other "brother," it was clear there was an unspoken distance between them.

Soon, the confirmation came that the final payment had been received. Chris's brother nodded at Lily before departing with his team. Chris remained unfazed, watching as Lily took a couple of phone calls before driving them to their next destination.

The car headed towards the heart of the city, the vibrant streets of the wealthy district flashing by. As they neared their destination, Lily felt a twinge of embarrassment; they hadn't budgeted time for dinner. She resolved to treat Chris to a nice meal as thanks for his hard work.

Arriving at a high-rise building, they were greeted by a friendly hostess who led them to the top floor. Mike's alertness heightened, signaling the complexity of their surroundings.

The tension eased when they were greeted by an elegant hostess, who welcomed them into what resembled a corporate lobby. Once inside, the atmosphere shifted from business to party mode, with music and a lively crowd.

To Lily’s surprise, the scene was more social gathering than business meeting—local businessmen mingling with guests, drinks in hand. Chris, unfazed, waited patiently as the hostess introduced them to the leading businessman.

As the music lowered, Lily and Chris were welcomed into the gathering. Chris signaled Mike to open the suitcase and display the jewelry.

The guests, a mix of international visitors, were clearly impressed by the array of jewelry presented before them. Chris noted that many of these pieces would suit auction houses perfectly. The leading businessman, clearly experienced, switched to English to converse with Lily, acknowledging the quality of the goods.

While the experts examined the jewelry, Lily took the opportunity to message her contact back home. Once done, she turned to Chris with a playful smile. “Want to try some spicy snacks?” she asked, reaching into her bag for a red package.

Chris hesitated, unsure of what Spicy Strips were, but Lily’s infectious enthusiasm won him over. She handed him a stick, explaining, “It’s vegetarian, made from soybeans.”

Chris took a tentative bite, finding the spicy, sweet flavor unexpectedly appealing. As he chewed, he noticed Lily offering the snack to Mike, who accepted it with a nod.

Their little snack exchange caught the attention of the leading businessman, who joined them, curious about the treat. “What are you eating?” he inquired, intrigued by the packaging.

Lily, ever generous, offered him a stick. Before long, the three of them were sharing the snack, the businessman remarking, “This is quite interesting! The flavors are really bold.”

After sampling the treat, the businessman signaled for a drink to cool the spice. Lily nodded, explaining, “It’s a popular snack back home.”

As the evening progressed, the businessman, still intrigued by the snacks, asked for more. Lily, realizing they hadn’t eaten dinner, responded with a smile, “This was just a snack, but I’m sure there’s more food coming.”

A moment later, a cart laden with seafood dishes arrived, transforming their business meeting into a delightful dinner. Lily invited Chris and Mike to join her, while the businessman continued to enjoy the Spicy Strips, now a newfound favorite.

The dinner was a success, leaving everyone satisfied. Lily, reflecting on the evening, realized the value of sharing simple pleasures—sometimes, the smallest things could lead to the most unexpected rewards.
