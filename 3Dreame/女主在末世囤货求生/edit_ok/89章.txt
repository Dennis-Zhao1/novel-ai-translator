**Closing the Door on the Dog**

The injured were promptly taken to the infirmary for treatment. Ethan, who had been hovering nearby, watched as his brother, Alex, regained consciousness. Alex's condition had stabilized, though he had lost a significant amount of blood. His wounds had been treated with all available medical measures, but he remained weak. Ethan, whose medical skills were rudimentary at best, had been too occupied with his own projects to focus on training. He had just managed to keep Alex alive and now felt a mix of despair and regret weighing heavily on him.

Uncle Max, having fainted for a while, had regained consciousness. His injuries were serious, and Ethan insisted he rest, sparing him from worrying about the family’s affairs and the youngest’s funeral for the time being.

Ivy observed the disarray among the injured family members and instructed them not to wander around at night. She then gathered her team to strategize their next moves.

Dinner was not delayed; Mrs. Smith prepared a meal that met her usual high standards. After everyone ate in turns, Ivy took her post for the night watch.

Originally, there had been a large searchlight there, but it had been damaged during the last attack on the base and had never been replaced. Ivy distributed firearms and weapons to her team members. As both superpowered individuals and elite soldiers, they were well-equipped and could leverage their abilities for greater effectiveness.

That night, an eerie silence enveloped the fortress. The fatigue from the day’s events weighed heavily on everyone. Except for those keeping vigil for the fallen, the rest were quickly ushered off to bed. The chilling presence of the bodies in the square cast an ominous shadow, and even Uncle Max, who had been punishing the intruders, had been knocked out and carried back.

Ivy sent Jake, the fastest runner, to the power control room to turn off all unnecessary lights, leaving only a few dim bulbs on, as they silently awaited the enemy's arrival.

Mark stood beside Ivy, holding military-grade night vision binoculars. After a moment, he whispered, “They’re here.”

Everyone had been outfitted with walkie-talkies, and upon receiving the signal, they all entered combat readiness. Using her keen eyesight, Ivy spotted five armored vehicles, three riot control vehicles, and one military jeep approaching.

Silently praying that Logan would show up as planned, she thought about how she had prepared a grand welcome for him. According to the traitor's description, the operation plan from the rival base involved secretly opening the fortress gates at night to let their people in. The rival team would then take control of all the family members and abscond with the laboratory personnel and their research results, trading them for weapons and supplies.

Jake pretended to be a member of the family’s extended branch to assist in the operation. Sure enough, once they exchanged coded signals, the opposing commander’s wariness melted away, and he hurriedly urged them to open the gates.

But Logan did not appear. Ivy felt a twinge of disappointment, but seeing the armored and riot control vehicles safely make it to their side, she begrudgingly accepted the outcome.

Jake feigned hesitation in opening the gates too wide, insisting that the intruders enter quietly. Persuaded by Jake's eloquence, the vehicles rolled into the fortress, causing no small amount of commotion among the lookout team.

With the gates opened just wide enough for one person to pass, the vehicles parked outside, and the commander organized his soldiers to disembark and make their way inside on foot.

Leading the way, Jake guided them while Ivy watched from the shadows, observing the sizable number of intruders—over fifty, though the exact count of superpowered individuals remained uncertain.

The fortress was dark and quiet. The rival team, well-equipped and heavily burdened, walked cautiously, but their vigilance dulled as they neared the square. It was only then they realized how few streetlights remained lit; only a few windows in the dormitories cast a feeble glow. They hastily dispatched scouts to investigate their surroundings, but it wasn’t long before a horrific scream pierced the air, followed by a rapid succession of gunfire.

The commander jumped in alarm and ordered his subordinates to turn on their headlights. But as the lights illuminated the square, a chilling sight greeted them: dozens of bodies hanging from the columns, reminiscent of a horror movie.

Before they could process this, a barrage of gunfire erupted from behind, and turning around, they were met with the flashing colors of lightning abilities as teammates fell one after another.

Ivy unleashed her ice spikes, while Mark followed up with metal projectiles, mercilessly cutting down the foes that had dared to invade.

Despite the enemy's attempts to retaliate, the team activated Jake's earth-based shields, which not only blocked incoming fire but created pits that ensnared their aggressors, trapping them in place.

The rival base superpowered individuals were quick to react, with one unleashing a fire attack aimed directly at Jake. However, he deftly dodged the attack using his wind abilities and countered with a slicing wind blade that severely injured the enemy's shoulder.

Ivy found herself facing three superpowered opponents. They had a degree of teamwork, but their coordination was off, which she noted with a sense of regret even as the battle raged around her.

Easily dispatching a few more foes, the regular soldiers were even easier to handle. The earth wall shields remained mobile, efficiently absorbing attacks that would have otherwise hit their mark.

Then, with a swift gust of sand blinding the enemies, Ivy and her team struck from behind, capitalizing on the confusion. Jake's crude but effective fighting style proved invaluable in this chaotic melee.

The gunfire echoed through the fortress, waking the remaining residents. Those too timid huddled under their blankets, while the braver souls peeked through curtains at the square, witnessing a chaotic dance of gunfire and superpowered abilities illuminating the night.

Half an hour into the clash, the battle concluded with Ivy’s team achieving a decisive victory. They spared the opposing commander for questioning, demanding to know who had sent him and what their intentions were.

The commander, however, remained defiant, throwing out threats before taking his own life, leaving the team with no further information.

Everyone shrugged it off, knowing that the attack had been orchestrated by Logan, the head of the rival base. Ecstatic, they stripped the intruders of their equipment and stored it away. Ivy had already driven her team to the gates to collect the armored and riot control vehicles.

It was a strange turn of events—without guns or artillery, the enemy had inadvertently supplied them.

Xander truly was a tactical genius; the strategy of luring them in and then closing the door on the dog had proven to be a masterstroke.

The rival base operatives had been naïve, believing everything they were told. Perhaps their previous interactions with the extended family had made them complacent, leading them to underestimate the challenges they faced.

The armored and riot control vehicles sat neatly lined up in the parking lot, while even the military jeep hadn’t been spared.

They then ordered the bodies of the invaders to be displayed in the square, setting up a night watch rotation before Ivy retired to her quarters for some much-needed rest.

The next morning, she awoke to the sound of commotion.

Rubbing her face, she washed up quickly before heading downstairs.

Uncle Max’s condition had improved significantly, and he stood alongside Ethan, staring blankly at the corpses in the square.

Nearly everyone in the fortress had gathered around, some whispering among themselves, while others took a quick glance before hurriedly retreating.

Had so many people really attempted a surprise attack last night? It was a total rout—a display of overwhelming strength.

When people looked back at Ivy, their expressions had shifted subtly, now tinged with respect.

Ivy noticed the change but feigned ignorance, greeting them before directing a cleanup of the corpses.

At that moment, Xander approached, whispering in her ear. Ivy nodded and pointed out a few bodies to be sent to the laboratory.

Turning to Ethan, she remarked, “Superpowered individuals also have crystal cores in their heads. It would be worth examining them in the lab to see how they differ from those of zombies.”

At her words, everyone grew even more cautious, obediently complying with her instructions.

After briefly explaining the events of the previous night to Uncle Max and the others and showcasing the spoils of war, Ivy stated firmly, “We’ve forged a deadly rivalry with the rival base. They’ve failed in their two attacks, gaining nothing while suffering heavy losses. They will only retaliate more fiercely. We can’t afford to sit idly by; it’s time to change our strategy in this apocalyptic fortress.”
