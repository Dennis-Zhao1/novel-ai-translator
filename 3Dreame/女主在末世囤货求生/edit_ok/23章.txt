**Doomsday Underground Sanctuary**

The two families that had decided to transform an abandoned military base into a doomsday underground sanctuary quickly began planning the renovation. The task of acquiring a hydropower generator fell to the Smith family, given their extensive network and resources.

The remaining task was to utilize and remodel the original architectural blueprints of the base. Ethan Parker and Old Mr. Smith discussed how to maximize the military base's advantages, ensuring it would be both defensible and offensive. After all, they couldn't expect kindness from humanity or the undead in a post-apocalyptic world—something Ethan was absolutely convinced of.

"This place is a goldmine; everyone would want it. We can't rely on human nature," she stated firmly. Old Mr. Smith nodded, understanding exactly where Ethan was headed with his thoughts.

In the Smith family’s study, Ethan encountered a young man he hadn’t seen before, named Mike Young. After introductions, he learned that Mike was the architect brought in to oversee the transformation of the sanctuary. With a rumored military background, his capabilities were still a bit of a mystery, yet Ethan trusted the Smith family’s judgment.

After Old Mr. Smith laid out a few requirements, Ethan contributed his own. Aside from restoring the military base's original capabilities for defense and offense, Old Mr. Smith wanted to seal off the base's roads into a single entry point. Ethan, on the other hand, insisted that the living spaces within be spacious and well-ventilated. As someone who couldn’t tolerate feeling cooped up, he threw his hands up in exasperation. "Isn’t that just common sense?"

Though it was called a doomsday underground sanctuary, the military base's altitude meant it was more mountain-side than underground, so ventilation wasn’t a concern at all.

Once they confirmed the various requirements, Mike casually asked, "Are we going for some sort of unique ecological experience here?" It seemed Ethan’s high standards for living spaces gave the impression he was trying to transform the sanctuary into a five-star hotel.

Old Mr. Smith chuckled and nodded, "You could say that; it’s all about survival in the apocalypse."

As the renovation of the sanctuary progressed rapidly, Ethan pondered how to enhance the living experience further. Deep down, he felt like something important was missing. But he knew better than to force the thought; he let it go for the time being.

Since the space upgrade, the sky had turned bluer, the wind gentler, and the grass greener. The cows, sheep, chickens, ducks, and geese were thriving behind their fences. Ethan had never doubted that cows and sheep could graze, but he couldn’t help but wonder what the others were eating to thrive so well.

Renovation was no quick task; Ethan wouldn’t be glued to the sanctuary's affairs. Ever since joining forces with the Smith family, he had taken a step back, trusting them to handle things. They held daily meetings or video conferences to discuss stockpiling progress and confirm the next steps.

The impending disasters wouldn’t delay just because someone wasn’t prepared.

In recent days, Ethan's increasing influence and involvement in the Smith family's affairs sparked quiet discontent among other Smith family members. Observing Old Mr. Smith and those with higher authority, it was obvious they grumbled behind closed doors. Meanwhile, family members who were further from the centers of power, particularly the women, began to gossip.

Zoe Smith was furious upon hearing this. "How can those aunts and sisters talk about Ethan like that?"

Despite her sweet and naive demeanor, Zoe had begun to grasp some unspeakable truths during this time. But seeing that Ethan was unfazed, she decided not to relay these disgusting remarks to her friend.

If Ethan were to find out, he’d probably just offer a wry smile. Let them misunderstand; it served as a good cover.

Once the apocalypse hit, they would realize just how narrow-minded they had been.

Holding two lists of supplies, one from the Smith family and the other from his private stash, Ethan had been repeatedly telling Old Mr. Smith that as long as there was even a penny to spare, it should be converted into survival supplies.

When the apocalypse struck, all movable and immovable assets, corporate stocks, cash, jewelry, and antiques would be worth nothing. "As long as you have food, you won’t panic."

Ethan's fingers habitually tapped a rhythm on the table, like a catchy tune, signaling he was deep in thought. He still had the largest company, Pearl Corporation, untouched, where he held the most shares. Distributing such a large pie without drawing attention from the Smith family would be tricky; it could easily expose his plans.

Old Mr. Smith was also scheming. The old fox was indeed crafty, and soon both of them landed on a quick and straightforward approach.

Once they had their plan, an unspoken understanding of keeping outsiders out resurfaced.

"Have you heard?" Old Mr. Smith asked.

"Not only that, he was sent straight to ICU yesterday and hasn't come out yet."

"Where did you hear this? Old Mr. Smith is really... in trouble..."

In the tight-knit social circles of Washington, news traveled fast. Recently, the Johnson family had hosted a business banquet, inviting the esteemed Old Mr. Smith. The invitation had been acknowledged, but then this incident occurred.

Of course, the gossip at the banquet wasn’t limited to just this incident.

"Looks like the Parker family is in trouble."

"I heard that too; it was that Smith family's younger son who did it, ruthless and cold-hearted, not even sparing that little orphan girl."

"Exactly! The orphan girl is easier to manipulate, and with her assets, she’s a prime target. Just turned eighteen and already a billionaire—who wouldn’t be envious? Once Old Mr. Parker is gone, they’ll have it easy."

"Right? Old Mr. Smith probably had a stroke out of anger over this."

"I’ve heard Old Mr. Parker spent a fortune on guardianship before passing. Those people really took the money without doing a thing."

Smith's younger uncle sat there, feeling wronged, thinking, "What a reputation to have; this is so unfair!"

At the center of this gossip storm, an old man and a young one were currently in a private hospital’s ICU, munching on cut fruit as they watched the live stream of the sanctuary’s renovation.

The Smith family was truly talented; on the first day alone, they managed to connect all the power circuits. The previous base had only removed the hydropower generator, and since the wiring had remained intact, they merely had to reconnect it to restore power. The network was also back online, allowing them to see the renovation from various angles via the newly installed surveillance cameras.

The base's layout was clear, divided into four main zones: the military zone, combat readiness zone, office zone, and living zone. Each area was spacious, and even the number of rooms in the living zone was more than enough for both the Parker and Smith families.

More rooms meant more supplies would need to be prepared. Between the living and office zones was a massive cafeteria—a combination of a dining hall and an event space. The kitchen area was planned out, but it was still quite empty, waiting to be stocked with necessary facilities.

As the renovation made significant noise, trucks bearing the Smith family’s logistics logo came and went, creating a buzz that savvy business folks couldn’t help but notice.

Smith's younger uncle took the opportunity to promote the "Doomsday Paradise" brand and advertisements, and with Old Mr. Smith's shocking admission to ICU, the attention was effectively diverted.
