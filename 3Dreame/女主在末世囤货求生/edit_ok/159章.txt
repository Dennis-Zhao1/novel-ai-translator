**Exit of the Cave**

“Why didn't you join Ethan's team?” Ivy asked, glancing back as Ethan's car disappeared down the road.

Alex, sitting in the passenger seat, leaned forward, clearly entertained by the unfolding drama. Although he didn't say a word, his expression was a clear giveaway. Ivy knew Alex had probably jumped to the wrong conclusions about last night, but she saw no need to clarify. “We split up to cover more ground efficiently. Our objective is to locate the old earth mounds from the previous expedition. Keep an eye out for anything unusual, okay? Let me know if you spot something,” she said with a smile.

Ivy's attempt to change the subject was met with knowing grins from Alex and Lisa, who shared a quiet chuckle at her expense before turning their attention back to the passing scenery.

Driving her prized, newly modified SUV—a vehicle she cherished too much to ever consider selling—Ivy ignored the eager glances from Mark as they sped away from their base. Once they reached the winding mountain road, they had no choice but to stop. After parking, Ivy tucked her keys into her pocket, while Lisa chased after Alex, unaware of Ivy's amused observation from behind.

The two friends broke into a playful race, with Lisa soon realizing she'd underestimated Alex's speed, given his natural agility. He teased her by slowing down just enough to keep her on her toes, enjoying the friendly competition.

“Look at these two goofballs,” Ivy thought, smiling softly as she let them have their fun.

Elsewhere, Ethan was trekking up the mountain with Logan. Observing Logan's cautious demeanor, Ethan guessed he'd picked up on some of Alex's abilities, trying to avoid touching others. They had been heading southwest towards the fortress, while Ivy's group was headed directly south, soon reaching the point where the vehicles were of no use.

As they began their ascent, Logan couldn't help but express his admiration for Ethan, who had a storied past as a former special forces soldier and was now a respected figure in this post-apocalyptic world.

“Ethan, do you fancy Jessica or Ivy? Not to be too forward, but I think Ivy's more your type. No offense to Jessica; it's just my opinion,” Logan said with a chuckle, blissfully unaware of the awkwardness his comment created.

The other teammate, trying to remain unnoticed, raised an eyebrow, thinking Logan was either brave or foolish to speak so candidly to Ethan.

“What do you mean by 'fancy'?” Ethan asked, playing along with a slight grin.

“Like, you and Ivy together! Although you have several admirers, I'm definitely rooting for you and Ivy,” Logan replied confidently.

“So, I've got a fan club, huh?” Ethan mused, amused by the thought.

“Absolutely! Besides Ivy, there's Jessica, and some folks even joke about you and Mike or the vice-captain!” Logan said, his tone light and playful.

Ethan understood the concept but found the idea of being paired with Mike or the vice-captain quite absurd. There was a clear line there he wasn't willing to cross.

The quiet teammate's eyes widened at the boldness of Logan's words, his respect for Logan's audacity growing. Ethan's lack of anger was surprising, revealing a side of him few knew—a man capable of lighthearted banter amid chaos.

They continued their journey with Logan doing most of the talking while Ethan listened, occasionally responding, and the other teammate maintained a low profile. After three hours of climbing, they paused for a well-deserved break. Ethan took out his binoculars, scanning the area for any signs of the cave exit.

Meanwhile, Ivy's group wasn't faring much better. The enthusiastic energy of Lisa and Alex had waned, leaving them exhausted. Alex was recovering by absorbing energy from a small crystal, while Lisa lay sprawled out, catching her breath.

Watching Ivy, who remained composed, Lisa regretted letting herself be provoked into a race with Alex. Now, she was too worn out to move, feeling embarrassed by her competitive spirit.

After a half-hour rest, Ivy resumed the search. They were on the southern side of the fortress's mountain range, overlooking the winding road below. It seemed likely they'd find an exit here, but despite reaching the summit, there was nothing unusual in sight.

Once Lisa and Alex regained their energy, they pressed on, searching for another two hours until they reached the peak, where they began a lateral search. Ivy felt certain the cave exit was nearby.

Finally, they stumbled upon an odd mound of earth. Ivy led her team forward, and sure enough, they discovered a large pile of fresh soil, revealing a hole just about three feet wide.

As Ivy set off the signal flares, she noticed similar signals from other directions.

“What’s happening? Why are there flares from so many spots?” Lisa asked, confused.

Ivy counted roughly seventeen different flares, suggesting there were as many exits. With no updates from the hydroelectric plant, she decided not to linger. After filling in the hole, the trio hurried down the mountain. It seemed peculiar—there should only be one exit, yet there were seventeen, maybe even more if some teams hadn't followed orders.

“Do you think these mountains and the fortress have been hollowed out? Could we be in danger of a collapse?” Lisa asked, her voice laced with concern.

Ivy pondered the possibility. She didn't want to meet her end crushed by a landslide instead of facing mutated plants or zombies.

Quickly, they regrouped with Ethan and his team, who were busy filling another hole. Their paths had crossed thanks to Ivy's detailed search pattern.

“Is it the same over there? Small mounds and holes?” Ethan asked, pausing to catch his breath. Thankfully, they had someone with earth manipulation abilities; otherwise, managing the soil would have been a challenge.

“Yes, I think these are decoys,” Ivy replied.

Ethan's expression turned serious. If these were distractions, where was the real exit?

Perplexed, they decided to wait for more reports once they returned to the fortress.

As they prepared to descend, a sudden rustling noise echoed above, followed by distinct sounds of something being eaten.

Ethan quickly scanned with his binoculars, his face changing dramatically as he realized the danger.

“Quick, we need to get down the mountain!” he urged, urgency lacing his voice.
