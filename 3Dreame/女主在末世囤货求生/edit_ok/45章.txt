**Setting Off for Rescue**

Ethan was in charge of leading a team in an armored vehicle, clearing the way ahead. Onboard were Ivy and two of the Smith family’s younger relatives. The driver was the seventh son of the Smith family, while Ethan occupied the passenger seat, with Ivy and the fifth Smith sibling sitting in the back. Mike drove a tour bus trailing behind, carrying the third, fourth, and eighth members of the Smith family.

After exiting the safe zone, they had to pass through a highway entrance since the other routes were too treacherous. The armored vehicle could barely manage to get through, but the tour bus was too wide and cumbersome to navigate the narrower paths.

Fortunately, the right side of the highway entrance had been completely blocked off, but there was still one passage left open on the left, allowing the bus to squeeze through just barely.

Once they reached the highway, the sight heading towards New York was even more terrifying. Cars were scattered haphazardly across the road, remnants of numerous accidents, abandoned vehicles, and even human remains were visible.

Ivy and the Smith brothers had only seen such scenes in movies; this was their first time witnessing it all with their own eyes. The Smith family's young driver, Nate, appeared particularly shaken, his face pale and his fingers trembling on the steering wheel.

Ethan chuckled softly to comfort him. “Hey, Nate, remember how you love those action movies? Just think of it as being on a film set. If it gets too overwhelming, just take deep breaths. The more you see, the easier it will get.”

“Ethan, don’t joke around,” Nate replied with a dry laugh. He wished he could look away. Just a quick glance had nearly made him nauseous. If he weren't driving, he would have pulled over to let it all out.

In the backseat, Ivy and Sam wore grim expressions. They didn’t have to drive, so they could see the horror more clearly. The sight of their own kind meeting such a gruesome end easily sparked their deepest fears.

Ivy’s voice trembled slightly as she asked, “Ethan, aren’t you scared?”

Ethan was indeed afraid, but he had witnessed mountains of corpses in a previous life. He had seen the bloodied, mangled bodies of people, which had haunted him for months afterward. It took him years to recover from the trauma of the apocalypse.

“I am scared, of course. But fear won’t keep me alive. We’re going to save people. So pull yourselves together; your friends and family are waiting for us,” Ethan encouraged, suppressing his own weakness. His words were meant not just for his companions but also for himself.

Right, his friends were counting on him to rescue them. Emily would probably cry her eyes out when she saw Ethan charging in to save her.

Just thinking about how his friend would look, crying uncontrollably, brought a smile to his face.

Perhaps it was Ethan’s relaxed attitude and his smile that lifted their spirits. The environment, though dire, didn’t seem as frightening anymore. If a tough guy could remain composed, what was there to fear?

The highway was littered with abandoned vehicles, and it was crucial to stay alert while driving, avoiding any wreckage or debris that could puncture their tires. Mike remained vigilant, following closely behind the armored vehicle. They could plow through larger obstacles, but they had to be careful not to crush smaller debris with the tires.

This mission didn't require them to enter the city; they were to take the highway, circling around New York from the northwest to the southeast, where the research base was located, not far from Aerospace Park.

The northwest of New York was mountainous while the southeast was a vast plain. After more than two hours of driving, they finally spotted a sign for Aerospace Park. It was quite a detour around the outer ring—if they had gone through the city, they could have cut their travel time in half.

However, the city’s traffic must have been completely paralyzed at this point; every road was likely blocked. Ethan had no intention of getting caught up in that chaos—the highway was enough of a challenge.

Thankfully, the stretch of road leading to Aerospace Park was wide and clear of any vehicle traces. Ethan used a paper map to locate the building where the Smith family’s uncle was based.

The area was a newly established tech park, with Aerospace Park further in. Most buildings in the park were around ten stories tall, with a few shorter ones at six or seven stories.

The building belonging to Smith’s uncle was the tallest and most centrally located in the tech park, boasting a full thirty stories—an unmistakable target.

As they approached the park’s gate, the automatic doors were out of power and wouldn’t open. Smith’s uncle explained that the park was still under construction, surrounded by walls. The only way for vehicles to enter was through the main gate.

Ethan thought for a moment, then parked the vehicle in an open space near the gate. Mike followed suit. There were no zombies at the entrance; it was eerily quiet. Looking inside, he couldn’t see any zombies roaming around. Ethan even suspected that the park might be completely empty.

That was highly unlikely, though. The more probable scenario was that the zombies had taken refuge in the various office buildings.

It was certain that there were still survivors, likely holed up in their offices or safe areas, with zombies lurking nearby.

With this in mind, Ethan instructed Ivy to fetch some supplies from the trunk while he communicated with Mike on the walkie-talkie, telling him to stay in the vehicle and wait for further instructions.

Ivy retrieved a black box marked with the logo of the largest drone brand. She quickly realized Ethan’s intentions and handed it to him. He opened the box and powered it on. This drone did not rely on network signals but transmitted images through this brand’s GPS signal.

After connecting his phone and setting it up, the drone’s live feed appeared on his screen. Ivy and Sam were excited; they too wanted to see what was happening outside.

Ethan deftly operated the drone, and with a buzzing sound, it flew out through the car’s sunroof, heading straight for the tallest building. He carefully controlled the drone’s altitude, not daring to fly too low for fear of attracting the zombies’ attention.

This drone was one he had purchased out of curiosity during his travels in the country and had used a few times to capture videos of his adventures. His skills had improved since then.

The building was a bit far from the gate, about a kilometer away. Ethan felt like it took forever for the drone to reach it. Sam mentioned that the biological lab was on the seventeenth floor, so he specifically had the drone film the main entrance. It was completely deserted, the door wide open, and although the luxurious entrance looked inviting, there was something sinister about it.

Without wasting any more time, the drone hovered vertically from the first floor upwards, while he had Ivy and the others count the floors.

“Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen floors, Ethan,” they called out.

Ethan’s fingers were starting to ache from pressing the buttons as he maneuvered the drone to circle the seventeenth floor.

“Why can’t we see anything? The windows on the seventeenth floor are all covered,” Nate complained, anxiously.

Ethan had no choice but to circle slowly around. Just as he was about to give up, Ivy suddenly shouted, “Ethan, look! Over there! There’s something!” She pointed excitedly at the phone screen.

Ethan’s fingers didn’t stop moving as he adjusted the view, quickly bringing the camera back to the area she pointed out. What appeared on the screen made everyone gasp in shock.
