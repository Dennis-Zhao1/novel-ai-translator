**What are you looking at, dog man?**

"Hey, Mr. Smith, Mrs. Smith, and the twins! It's been ages. Still crying louder than a fire truck, huh? Geez, pull it together!" 

Ivy chuckled as she snapped a few pictures with her phone, capturing the moment and teasing them a bit, causing Danny to groan in frustration.

Ethan watched her with amusement, seeing her dig into her backpack for snacks to share with them, urging them to recharge their energy.

Meanwhile, she had already contacted Mike via her walkie-talkie, informing him they'd located the researchers and the Smith family but were stuck behind electronic locks. They needed power to open them, or else they'd have to crawl back through the ventilation ducts.

At this point, Danny spoke up, "No need to make it complicated. Just find the lab's electrical control room from outside, tweak the wiring, and connect it to the emergency power supply. Those locks don't need much power; the backup will do."

Hearing this, Ivy felt a wave of relief. She really didn’t want to crawl back and forth anymore; her back was almost numb from hunching over.

Suddenly, Captain Jack's voice crackled through the walkie-talkie. "Professor Smith, hello. I’m Captain Jack Cooper from the Special Operations Team. We’ve been in contact before about the rescue operation for your team."

Ivy's eyes widened in disbelief. This guy was also here to rescue Mr. Smith? 

Why hadn’t anyone mentioned it earlier? It made sense why he had been so proactive later on. If she had known, she would have let him do the crawling instead. What a missed opportunity!

Mike then had Ivy pass the walkie-talkie to Danny. Following his instructions, they found the control room for the lab’s electrical circuits. It was a small, secluded room.

The door blended into the wall so well that only someone familiar with the place could find it.

Captain Jack took charge of modifying the circuits, and Ivy saw that they could finally leave through the door. 

She directed Danny and his brother to help her move an office desk, then jumped down from the ventilation duct. After tossing the rope aside, she sat next to Danny, wiping away his tears.

Mrs. Smith didn’t look well; her complexion was pale. Ivy asked about it and learned she had a chronic illness and hadn’t brought her medication inside. 

She hadn’t taken her medicine for several days, so Ivy quickly rummaged through her bag, searching her memory for the right medication. When she finally found it, she pretended to have scavenged it just for effect.

After taking the medication, Mrs. Smith took a long time to feel better, her complexion gradually improving—perhaps it was the hope of seeing the outside world again that lifted her spirits.

They had been trapped for five days; the snack cabinet in the observation room had been emptied, and they had run out of drinking water. Just moments ago, they were arguing over the last sip.

Mr. Smith hurriedly inquired about the situation outside, and everyone listened intently. When they heard about the zombie outbreak, the Smith family finally breathed a sigh of relief, knowing everyone else had retreated to the Doomsday Fortress.

The older brothers were deeply moved to hear their younger siblings were risking their lives to save them; they vowed to treat their younger brothers better from now on, promising not to lash out unnecessarily and to be gentler.

Danny leaned against his best friend, looking worn out and tearful. Ivy joked to lift his spirits, but she couldn’t stand seeing him in such a pitiful state—it was downright annoying.

After chatting for a while, Danny didn’t respond until Ivy mentioned there were handsome guys outside. At that, he perked up a little, urging her to spill the beans.

Ivy recounted how they had entered, practiced their skills, and encountered the special forces team, including the annoying survivor teammates.

Mr. Smith expressed deep sorrow for the fallen members of the special operations team, who had sacrificed their lives to save him. Ivy didn’t dare to counter his sentiment, though she personally believed that if one didn’t meddle in matters that didn’t concern them, they wouldn’t die.

Danny spoke a bit more, and then they heard a click as the electronic lock on the door activated. Ivy was the first to stand, helping Mrs. Smith to her feet. She quickly opened the door with a flashlight in one hand, urging everyone to follow closely.

No one dared to assume there weren’t any zombies in the lab, remaining cautious.

On the other side, the lab door opened to reveal the previous group, who were supporting each other as they made their way toward the light.

Seeing his students safe, Mr. Smith felt relieved, even though they had starved and suffered for several days; at least they were alive.

Now, guided by Danny, Ivy took the lead, hurrying toward the exit of the lab when her sharp senses caught another sound.

As they approached an office, she instinctively thought it might be a zombie. She threw open the door, shining the flashlight inside, and Mr. Smith exclaimed, "Zach! Are you okay?"

Ivy realized it wasn’t a zombie, but rather a pale-faced man wearing glasses lying on the floor. She handed the flashlight to Danny and stepped forward to check if he had been infected. His pallor didn’t look good.

Zach, in a daze, saw a little fairy walking toward him, backlit by the light. He smiled dreamily, then promptly fainted.

After examining him, Ivy determined he was simply dehydrated and had been lacking food. She quickly gave him a few sips of bottled water, intending to get him out first.

Meanwhile, Danny had already given Captain Jack the lab’s password, and the two teams met up inside the lab.

Since they had gathered everyone, they hurried to leave. Those who could walk did so; those who couldn’t were helped or carried.

Ivy and Danny supported Mrs. Smith through the middle of the group, with Zach being carried at the back by Captain Jack’s team.

It was already 9:30 PM. Based on her experiences from her previous life, she knew it was unwise to venture out at night; turning on lights made them easy targets.

If they didn’t turn on the lights, they couldn’t see anything, and zombies were more agile at night than during the day.

Unexpectedly, Captain Jack had the same line of thought. While everyone was eager to leave the lab, only he and Ivy seemed to be on the same wavelength.

Unable to directly share her past experiences, Ivy offered a simple explanation: driving at night was dangerous because visibility was poor.

Everyone quieted down, realizing they had to stay in this dreadful place for one more night, which dampened their spirits.

Ivy instead said, "You’re all anxious for nothing. Mr. Smith, you haven’t collected your research materials yet. Are you really going to leave them here? Can you bear to do that?"

Only then did Mr. Smith realize there was a lab specifically arranged for him in the Doomsday Fortress, and he couldn’t abandon his previous research and findings.

He slapped his forehead and called over a few of his students who were still in decent shape, rushing off to gather their things.

Captain Jack observed Ivy's clever expression and couldn’t help but smile.

But why did she know the outside situation was grim? Just hours ago, she had seemed eager to wrap things up and return home.

With this question in mind, he carefully watched her. Ivy, whose senses were sharp, soon noticed that Captain Jack was watching her again. Did he suspect her? What had she revealed?

Keep watching, huh? Don't blame me for making the first move if you keep staring. I’ll silence you before you can spill anything—deaths erase all traces, humph. Though her mind was in turmoil, Ivy maintained a facade of calm, feeling split inside.

Irritated by the scrutiny, Ivy stood up, pretending to check on Mr. Smith and the others gathering their belongings while also casually exploring the entire underground lab area.

Mr. Smith had been packing for nearly an hour, collecting documents, USB drives, and even dismantling computer hard drives. Well, to protect the integrity of the scientific research, it was worth it.

Without any zombies around, everyone felt free to wander. When Ivy spotted Mr. Smith, he was standing by the storage cabinets that held emergency power supplies, where they had first passed through.
