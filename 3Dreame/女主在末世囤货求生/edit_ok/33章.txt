**Global Travels: Stocking Up**

After a restful night, the trio left the Kingdom of Sand early the next morning, heading to Canada, a destination Ivy had eagerly anticipated. Known for its abundant seafood, Canada was a culinary paradise that promised a feast unlike any other.

"This time, if I don't stock up on a few tons, it'll be a disservice to myself!" Ivy thought excitedly as they landed at the airport. Her first stop was the seafood dock, eager to take advantage of the fresh catches just brought in by the fishermen. While she could pass on the cheaper fish, premium options like lobsters, king crabs, snow crabs, abalone, tuna, salmon, Arctic clams, and sea urchins were absolute must-haves.

Not only did she love these delicacies, but in the post-apocalyptic world she envisioned, they were also scarce resources that could be bartered for vital supplies. Back home, she had already amassed a collection of wine and spirits, and this trip included stops to further enrich her stockpile.

She vividly remembered a moment from her past when someone had used a bottle of cheap red wine to trade for a batch of bullets, their smug expression etched in her memory.

The seafood dock was sprawling, filled with all kinds of fishing boats. After a brief phone call, Chris led Ivy toward the largest vessel in sight. With some effort, Ivy climbed aboard, but the intense smell of fish overwhelmed her senses, making her nose tingle. Once on deck, her eyes widened in disbelief.

The fishermen hadn’t even had the chance to sort their catch yet. Two storage compartments were brimming with fish, spilling over onto the deck, leaving little room for the crew to move. On the other side, waist-high buckets were filled with sea urchins, abalone, lobsters, and her absolute favorite, emperor crabs.

Her eyes sparkled with excitement. Not only could they buy directly from the boat, but they could also visit the nearby seafood trading market, where freshly sorted seafood was sold by the fishermen.

Chris seemed eager to show her how fresh the catch was. After a quick hello, he led her off the boat and toward the seafood market.

The bodyguard accompanying them, Ethan, was equally astounded. Having worked as a mercenary abroad, he had seen fishing boats before, but never one this large or stocked with such a bounty of seafood. The sight was enough to make his mouth water; he was getting hungry.

Feeling the same hunger, Ivy didn’t head straight to the seafood market. Instead, she detoured to a well-known seafood restaurant. While Chris had planned the purchasing itinerary, Ivy had done her homework on the culinary delights.

With plenty of cash to spend, Ivy, accompanied by the ever-hungry Ethan and the easy-going Chris, ordered a table overflowing with dishes.

This place was famous for its seafood, and after being grounded by her overprotective grandfather, her knowledge of global cuisines came solely from popular online videos. The seafood feast she had drooled over late at night was finally within her reach, and she felt overwhelmed with happiness, almost to the point of tears.

During their meal, Chris contacted the supplier for ice wine, who promptly arrived to offer tastings that paired beautifully with the seafood.

With someone like Ethan, a human vacuum when it came to food, Ivy had no concerns about waste. They ordered whatever looked appealing, and Chris could only shake his head in disbelief at how much Ivy could eat. She appeared so delicate, yet she had an impressive appetite that he had never noticed before.

Once the dishes arrived, Chris realized he had overestimated her. The young lady sampled a little bit of everything, savoring the flavors before claiming she was full, leaving the rest for the bodyguard.

It wasn't surprising that Ethan could eat so much. Standing over six feet tall, he dwarfed both Ivy and Chris. His muscular build required a massive amount of food to sustain itself.

After calling over a waiter, Ivy made a note of all the delicious seafood she had just tried. While they could find similar dishes back home, the variety was never this extensive.

At this seafood extravaganza, the menu was dictated by the available ingredients, with seasonal items added for variety. A few dishes were new to her, and she planned to seek them out at the seafood market later. Whatever was delicious would definitely make its way into her storage space—she wanted it all.

Chris quickly finished his meal, wiping his hands as he watched Ethan devour everything in sight. He even raised his hand to order two servings of staples. Ivy loved watching Ethan eat; it brought her satisfaction even if she couldn’t finish her meal. Perhaps that was the charm of food shows.

After a brief digestion period, Chris checked his phone and indicated they could head out. The supplier had been quick; the fishermen had sorted and weighed all the seafood in the time it took them to eat. Professionalism at its finest.

As they wrapped up their bill and made their way to the market, Ivy felt her expectations were exceeded. This seafood market was enormous, not just stocked with local catches but also featuring products from other countries—crabs, snails, shellfish, shrimp, and various fish. There was everything one could imagine, and if it existed, it was on offer.

"Well, as long as they have everything, that's what matters. The only fear is if they don't," she thought.

Purchasing was merely a matter of having money.

If Chris had been paying close attention to Ivy, he would have noticed her excitement growing as they moved toward the largest stall. She recognized it as the supplier from the massive fishing boat. The owner was absent, leaving someone resembling the captain to communicate with Chris. Along the way, Ivy asked about prices from various stalls, gaining a general understanding of the market rates.

After Chris passed on her desired types and quantities of seafood, the seller glanced at Ivy in astonishment, seeking confirmation from Chris. The two of them exchanged knowing glances—Chris simply nodded.

Soon, amidst a flurry of unintelligible chatter, the seller handed Ivy a price list. The quote was surprisingly good, even lower than some previous offers.

Ivy glanced at the prices and then considered the domestic market, concluding that buying directly at the source was indeed the best deal.

The price list also provided information on their maximum stock levels, giving her a solid reference.

"Wow, for some seafood, the quantities I want exceed even their inventory!" she realized, taking in the implications.

Following another round of inventory checks, Ivy added a few more items based on the captain's recommendations, driven by curiosity. If they were delicious, she'd keep them; if not, she could trade them. Nothing would go to waste.

Watching her shop with seemingly endless spending, Chris sighed. Ethan stood next to him like a statue, unsure if he should intervene. He wanted to say, “Hey, that’s enough! You know this costs money, right? Buying more would be rude!”

After the card was swiped, they watched as the seafood was carefully sorted and packed, with generous amounts of ice added for preservation. Some items were even packed in seawater with oxygen to ensure freshness. The bounty filled an entire shipping container, which would be shipped directly to Ivy's homeland on the same day. The ship was equipped with advanced preservation technology, ensuring the seafood would not spoil or die during transit. The shipping cost was based on size and travel time, and given the high demand for seafood, it was a minor expense.

As per usual, she marked everything for her storage space, and Chris and Ethan refrained from following her, choosing instead to enjoy the sea breeze at the dock.
