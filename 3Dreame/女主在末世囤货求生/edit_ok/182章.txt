**Epilogue**

On the way to the mission, Jack Anderson found himself lost in thought.

"Hey there, partner, when's this long journey to win her back gonna wrap up?" chimed a voice, breaking the silence.

"Give it a rest. When will you finally leave me alone?" he snapped back, his patience wearing thin.

"That depends on when you finish your mission. Aren't we all counting on you?" the voice teased lightheartedly.

"Maybe in my next life," Jack muttered.

"I hear ya! But it looks like you'll just have to deal with it for now," it replied cheerfully.

"Guess I need to figure out how to wrap this up sooner," he sighed.

"…"

Across the post-apocalyptic fortress square, a lively discussion was taking place.

"Mr. Smith, what do we do about this big crater? We can't just magically fill it!" Andrew, the diligent helper, scratched his chin, looking utterly dejected.

"I have no idea! I'm not a soil expert. You're asking the wrong person," Mr. Smith shrugged helplessly.

"My dad says it’s tough. He said those with earth abilities are just movers of nature; they don’t actually create soil," Andrew replied.

"Stop whining. Make way! Lucy’s got it all sorted. In a few days, someone will come to fill these pits, so you don’t need to worry," Emily said as she passed by, holding a stack of documents.

"Hey, that’s a lot of papers! Let me help you," Andrew offered, reaching for the documents.

"Who’s this amazing person Lucy found that can fill in all these pits?" he asked curiously.

Mr. Smith’s interest was piqued, and although he didn’t speak up, he stayed close, ears perked for more information.

"Didn’t we connect with a base overseas last month? Apparently, they’re friends of Lucy from before. They’ll be flying over to help. We’ll find out the details when the time comes," Emily explained.

"Overseas?" Mr. Smith pondered, his mind racing as he started to piece things together. Andrew, noticing Mr. Smith's knowing look, immediately called out, "Mr. Smith, wait! Don’t go! I’ll be back after I deliver these documents!"

"Get lost, you little rascal!" Mr. Smith shot back, though with a hint of affection.

"So who is this person?" Lucy suddenly interjected, startling the older Mr. Smith.

“Ah! You nearly gave me a heart attack!” Mr. Smith exclaimed.

"Come on, Mr. Smith, just tell us already!"

"It’s nobody special, just a foreigner. He’s quite good at making money and has connections in many countries. How do I put this… he’s like a broker," Mr. Smith said, attempting to downplay the significance.

"A broker? A powerful one at that?" Andrew was intrigued.

Mr. Smith wore a mysterious smile that suggested he knew something more, hinting at the broker's impressive capabilities, someone who could arrange to buy planes, tanks, and rocket launchers.

"So who is he?" Andrew pressed again, his curiosity insatiable.

"You just delivered the documents, right? How do you keep popping up?" Mr. Smith exclaimed, nearly jumping at Andrew’s sudden appearance.

"I have wind abilities! I’m really fast!" Andrew boasted.

"Stop interrupting, Andrew! Mr. Smith, please tell us more," Lucy urged.

"This broker is no small fry. He’s tall, charming, and wealthy. He’s currently the leader of the largest base in the Sand Kingdom," Mr. Smith elaborated.

"A man? That strong? Is his ability better than Captain Jack’s? No way; don’t exaggerate, Mr. Smith!" Lucy protested.

"I don’t know about his ability, but his connections are the real deal. You know what the Sand Kingdom has most of, right?"

"I know! Oil, right?" Andrew answered.

"That’s too simple-minded. The Sand Kingdom has a lot of valuable resources, not just oil but weapons and gold too. So, what do you think a capable man with all that will be like?" Mr. Smith asked, raising an eyebrow.

"Successful?" Andrew guessed.

"Respected?" Lucy said uncertainly.

"Too simplistic! A capable man with gold, weapons, energy, and connections—he will be… happy," Mr. Smith concluded.

"Meh," someone scoffed.

"Mr. Smith, what’s this foreigner’s name? Tall, charming, and wealthy, huh? You should consider introducing him to your single niece!" Emily chimed in, grinning. With such a powerful man, it would be a shame not to develop something!

"Get lost, you little girl! It’s none of your business. He’s interested in Lucy, not you. You should focus on your own admirers!" Mr. Smith retorted.

"What? He’s after Lucy? What about Captain Jack? Isn’t he doomed? I heard he confessed for the umpteenth time and got shot down again!" Emily exclaimed.

"What? The couple I root for cannot be!" Lucy cried, panicking. After years of rooting for this couple, was it all about to come crashing down?

"Shut up. What does a grown man know about shipping couples? Our Lucy is one of a kind!" Sarah tossed over her shoulder as she walked past, leaving Lucy fuming behind her.

"You don’t get it, just stay quiet!" he shouted back.

Mr. Smith shook his head at the chaotic scene before him, amused. He had official matters to attend to and strolled on, leaving the chatter behind.

Inside the fortress laboratory, the atmosphere was tense.

"Lucy, this is our latest zombie detox serum. While it won’t turn zombies back into humans, it can dissolve the crystal cores in their brains, reducing them to non-aggressive zombies that move slowly and lack abilities," a researcher explained.

"Will this affect humans or ability users in any way?" Lucy asked, examining the serum handed to her by Dr. Carter under the bright lights.

"There will be some impact. The crystal cores of ability users and zombies are fundamentally the same. However, this serum is only tested on zombies; we haven’t tried it on ability users yet," he replied.

"Understood. Let’s halt this project for now. The entire globe is buying awakening serums from us. If they find out about this serum, it will cause panic. Since they’ve already become ability users, I doubt anyone would want to go back to being ordinary," she decided firmly.

"Got it. What about the research materials?" Dr. Carter asked.

"I’ll handle them," Lucy said, gathering the research notes and the sole vial of serum, storing them in her safe for safekeeping.

As she stepped out of the lab, she looked at the bustling fortress and felt a flicker of hope. One day, she believed, zombies would be wiped out, and all humanity would be reborn, embracing a new life in a new world. And when that day came, she would return the old residence to its original place. Perhaps then, she would finally start her own new life as well.
