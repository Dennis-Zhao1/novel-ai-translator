**Owing Me Three Times**

Ethan's sudden retreat left Chris completely blindsided. He hadn't witnessed Ethan getting hit and quickly deduced that the unexpected withdrawal might be linked to Ivy. He looked up toward the rooftop where she had been stationed.

At that moment, she had already holstered her weapon and turned away. Chris caught only a fleeting glimpse of the familiar silhouette of her gun as it swung past.

Chris sprang to his feet and rushed toward his team. The lightly injured members were already regaining their footing, and although the severely injured teammate remained unconscious, the bleeding had stopped, and his complexion was improving.

"Let's move! The zombies are closing in!" Ivy shouted as she jogged toward him, clutching her rifle.

From a distance, Chris saw a mass of zombies blocking one side of the street, drawn by the chaos. Mike was already on the lookout for a working vehicle nearby.

Ivy handed her rifle back to the injured teammate and joined Mike in the vehicle search. The commercial district was littered with abandoned cars, but few were operational. When Mike spotted a promising car, he smashed the window and pulled the door open, only to find the fuel gauge on empty, which made him slam his fist against the steering wheel in frustration.

Soon after, Ivy drove up in a pickup truck she had secretly retrieved. She thanked her quick thinking; back in the city, she had not only collected her family’s truck but also a few others parked near the warehouse.

Loading the severely injured teammate into the back of the pickup took considerable time, and Ivy could sense the approaching zombie horde even without her mental abilities.

Mike quickly started the engine, exhaust fumes puffing out, and Ivy gave Chris a nudge to hurry him into the vehicle. She swiftly replaced the empty magazine in her handgun, ready for action.

Once everyone was on board, the leading zombies had already reached the pickup’s bed. Ivy swung her sword with her left hand, slicing off an arm, while firing her gun with her right, taking out the zombies’ heads.

The lightly injured teammates also raised their weapons to fend off the attack.

Suddenly, Chris turned and found a zombie gripping his arm, nearly pulling him off the truck. He was protecting his teammate with one arm while gripping the hilt of his sword with the other, clearly intending to swing it but lacking the opportunity.

Seeing his predicament, Ivy's heart skipped a beat, and she reacted quickly, delivering a headshot to each of the zombies that threatened him. She yanked Chris back just as he was about to lose his balance and be pulled out.

In that moment, Chris's heart raced. The fierce expression of the girl with the cold face filled his vision, and he suddenly found her surprisingly endearing.

Ivy noticed him staring blankly and shot him a frown. "Are you stunned? Get it together, man! Why are you so slow to react?"

Alright then, endearing was off the table.

Chris felt utterly humiliated after being scolded in front of his teammates, his pride taking a hit. Channeling his frustration into action, he finally unleashed his sword, quickly dispatching the zombies clinging to the vehicle, allowing them to pick up speed.

Ivy put away her gun and took out a cloth from her backpack to carefully clean her prized sword.

Chris had been hesitant to speak, but realizing they were all in the same boat now, he decided to break the silence. "That sword looks impressive. Is it from Longquan?"

Ivy continued wiping her sword, initially wanting to retort but changing her mind as her eyes flickered. "Yeah, yours isn't too shabby either."

"Thanks, it's a family heirloom. How about yours?"

"Uh, it’s someone else's heirloom."

"......"

The expressions of their teammates mirrored Chris's, all wearing looks of disbelief. Seriously? Two sentences and they killed the conversation? How were they supposed to continue from that?

Noticing their perplexed faces, Ivy finished cleaning her sword and sheathed it. She leaned against the truck's railing and smiled sweetly at Chris. "Captain Chris, I just saved your life again."

Chris raised an eyebrow, and Ivy rested her chin on her hand, continuing, "So that makes it three times you owe me now."

Chris didn't respond, and Ivy quickly picked up on his reluctance. "Hey, big man, you can't just ignore what you owe me!"

The few remaining conscious teammates were thoroughly entertained. They had never seen their captain so thoroughly outmatched by a girl before. Typically, in their line of work, they had little interaction with women, and with their captain's striking looks, no girl dared to give him attitude—except for this one.

Did she have face blindness? Or was her vision just so poor that she couldn't recognize their captain's face? 

The vice-captain's inner thoughts were nearly spilling over. The last time these two met, they had been at odds. Perhaps they were simply natural-born rivals.

Chris's pride was utterly crushed. He shot a glare at the teammates who were laughing at his expense and then glanced at the girl beside him, who was eagerly waiting for him to say something.

He sighed, realizing how transparent her schemes were. Rubbing his nose, he finally replied, "Depends on what you want. If it’s beyond my capability, I can't promise anything."

Ivy looked at him, unimpressed. "Don’t worry, it'll definitely be within your ability."

She quickly began to strategize how to use these three favors.

After speeding to a safe area, Mike parked in a desolate patch of land, then rolled down the window to call out to Ivy, "Miss, what’s the plan now?"

Ivy understood his implication and glanced at Chris, tilting her chin slightly.

Chris caught on to her intention as well. He pondered for a moment and then looked at their unconscious teammate. "I wonder if the Bastion of the Apocalypse is still accepting new people?"

Ivy clapped her hands together. "They usually don't accept anyone, but since you asked, they definitely will. So that makes it three times you owe me now."

Chris felt helpless; it seemed he had boarded a pirate ship.

Ivy continued, "The Bastion of the Apocalypse isn't open to the public. They've never taken in any stragglers or teams. Only I can bring you in, and once you're inside, you’ll need to follow my orders. Can you accept that?"

Chris regarded her serious expression, realizing this was the woman’s capability to change her demeanor. "So we’ll be joining as mercenaries?"

"You could say that. You’ll live in the Bastion and complete the tasks I assign."

Chris glanced back at his comrades, realizing they couldn’t return to the base for now. He could sense that Ethan was playing a significant game, all aimed at trapping him. While he could defend against immediate threats, he couldn't guard against everything indefinitely. Instead of remaining a target, it was better to take a step back and wait for a chance.

He nodded in agreement, and just like that, their cooperation was established.

Ivy had her doubts but felt today’s events were too coincidental to be a setup. She leaned toward believing that the conflict between Chris and Ethan was genuine, which meant she had gained a formidable ally, significantly increasing her chances against that pair of scoundrels.

But what if it was all an act? Ivy had never underestimated Ethan's cunning and ability to manipulate people. If it was staged for her benefit, keeping him close would make it easier to find flaws in his performance and deal with the situation more effectively.

So, getting into the Bastion was a certainty; as for whether they were allies, that would unfold with time.

With a bright smile, Ivy extended her hand to Chris. "Welcome to my team!"
