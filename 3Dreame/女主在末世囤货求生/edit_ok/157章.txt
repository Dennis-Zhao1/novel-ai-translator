**Magic Seed**

"It's all good then! Here, have some more to solidify it. I brewed some fresh tea. Or if you’d prefer coffee, that works too!"

"Tea is fine."

Ethan took the cup of tea offered to him and drank it in one go. He was really thirsty, feeling a bit sticky and uncomfortable.

Ivy noticed his discomfort too. There was no ignoring the faint musk from the man across from her, but it wasn't off-putting. After all, he had been sweating a lot, and she had only managed to wipe the exposed parts of his skin.

Seeing his unease, Ivy gestured toward the RV outside. "You should go take a shower over there. The plumbing in this old house doesn't work. Luckily, time seems to stand still here, so it doesn’t matter if the room has electricity or not."

Ethan nodded, taking the sportswear set Ivy had prepared for him, still in its unopened package, just like last time.

While waiting for him to shower, Ivy changed the bedding in the bedroom, grateful she had stocked up on linens. She noticed the sheets were soaked with sweat, so she decided to boil some more water, planning to brew him a few more cups of tea once he was back.

Not long after, Ethan returned. It suddenly struck Ivy that he had a wound on his arm, which wasn’t ideal to get wet. However, he seemed unconcerned. The wound looked worse than expected; the water had washed directly over it, and many parts were showing signs of whitening.

Ethan rubbed his hair with a towel and looked at Ivy in confusion. "What’s wrong?"

"Are you really asking? You didn’t think to be careful while showering? Doesn't it hurt?" Ivy pointed at his wound and retorted.

"It’s nothing, just a little scratch... ouch!" He had barely finished speaking when the sting of antiseptic from Ivy applying it interrupted him.

"Hehe, doesn't hurt? Trying to be a hero, huh? What if you faint again? I might not be able to catch you the second time!"

Ethan froze at her words, recalling how he had collapsed directly into Ivy’s arms before. His ears suddenly felt hot.

"It won’t happen," he mumbled, not caring if she heard him.

After treating his wound, Ivy thought about the current weather not being suitable for bandaging. It was better to let it air out, which would help the wound heal, so she chose not to say more.

Meanwhile, Ethan felt a flutter of joy inside, thinking that this injury was worth it for all the care he was receiving from Ivy. He felt elated.

"Chatterbox, you’ve got five minutes to say goodbye to your brother Xuanjing. We need to head out."

Ethan stood in front of the screen and said, "Hey, how did you wake up so quickly? I haven’t had enough fun yet! Brother Xuanjing’s story isn’t finished; I don’t want to leave!"

"Well, you can stay behind. I’m leaving."

"You know I can’t stay by myself!"

"Enough of the drama; we have business to attend to outside."

Ethan firmly interrupted the chatterbox’s lament. The next moment, he appeared in Ivy’s dorm room, right on her bed.

They both froze, a little too close for comfort, staring into each other's eyes without making a move.

"What are you two doing?"

The chatterbox’s sudden voice broke the moment, causing Ethan’s brow to twitch. The good atmosphere was instantly shattered by its loudness. He quickly sat up and got off the bed, while Ivy awkwardly fixed her hair and jumped down from the other side.

"Every time we enter this space, the filters I set for you fail. It’s really annoying," he complained, quickly hitting the mute button for the chatterbox, feeling his mind clear up.

Seeing Ivy's slightly awkward expression, he realized his earlier reaction might have been too extreme, almost as if he was trying to distance himself from her. He silently cursed the chatterbox for being a nuisance and making her misunderstand.

At the same time, Ivy was scolding herself for suddenly acting starry-eyed, staring at his face without blinking for so long. She had looked at him while he was unconscious, but it hadn’t felt this way. Something must be off; perhaps she had been poisoned?

Lost in her self-doubt, Ivy didn’t notice Ethan’s expression of guilt and self-reproach.

Before long, there was a knock on the door.

"Ivy, it’s me, Mike. You need to come out; something’s not quite right."

Ivy immediately opened the door. Mike rushed in, and upon seeing Ethan in the room, he froze, unable to continue speaking.

"Uh, did I interrupt something? Sorry, that wasn’t my intention."

"Just tell me what’s going on; that doesn’t matter," Ivy replied without waiting for Ethan to speak, already leading Mike to sit on the couch.

"So, you arranged for me to wrap things up with Mr. Johnson, right? I didn’t dare let anyone else handle this, fearing some danger might arise. I’ve carefully picked these out with some tools and stored them. But look, it hasn’t been long, and some of them are starting to look off. Look, they might be sprouting."

As he spoke, he handed a glass jar that used to hold pickled vegetables to Ivy. It was filled about two-thirds with dark seeds, roughly the size of red dates, and indeed some were beginning to show signs of sprouting.

"They can’t be allowed to sprout and grow. That one flower was enough to fill a pot! If these grow any larger, no one might be able to escape."

Mike nodded, pointing at the jar. "You handle it. I’m going back to sleep. I’m so tired. You both should rest early too. Goodnight!"

After saying this, Mike clapped his hands and quickly exited, his speed making it seem like he was utilizing wind-based abilities to the fullest.

Ivy held the jar of seeds, staring blankly at the closed door, then shifted her gaze to Ethan, who wore an expression that said, "This has nothing to do with me."

"What do you think we should do with these? If they all sprout, the whole place could explode!"

"Host, these are good things! Quickly! Give them all to me!" the chatterbox exclaimed, making Ethan question whether he had indeed pressed the mute button.

"What do you want these for? To eat?" he asked.

"The energy in these seeds is what the mainframe likes! Host, hurry! I can help you solve this problem!"

Ivy looked skeptically at Ethan, who had been quiet. She realized that his current state was a bit off and deduced he was conversing with the system.

"Last time, you just took those four seeds without a word. You can’t do that this time."

"Host, please! I’ll make it up to you! I’ll double the points in exchange for them. Really, double!"

"Then tell me how many points one seed is worth. If it’s less than what I expect, I won’t trade. I’ll just burn them all; let’s see how those seeds can sprout then."

"Don’t! Host, you can’t waste good resources!"

The chatterbox sounded like it was about to cry, its voice rising dramatically as if it had just lost five hundred bucks.

"If you promise to be quiet, I might consider it..."

"I’ll be quiet! I’ll behave! Host, how about this: One seed for one thousand points. I’ll give you two thousand points for each seed, sound good?"

After making the offer, the chatterbox looked eagerly at Ethan, waiting for a response.

"Two thousand points is too little. One seed for ten thousand points."

"Are you trying to rip me off? What kind of seed is worth that much? Is it encrusted with diamonds?"
