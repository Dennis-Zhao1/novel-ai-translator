**Awakening of Abilities**

Ethan’s face showed a hint of wariness. Instead of answering directly, he asked, “What’s going on?”

He glanced at the people lying scattered around, touched the dried blood beneath his nose, and seemed to recall something.

Ivy noticed the shift in his expression and felt surprised. Initially, she had only wanted to see if he had awakened any special abilities. She hadn’t expected him to look so composed; something about his reaction felt off.

As someone who had experienced a life that gave her foresight, Ivy was always prepared for any eventuality. Yet, what about this man before her? He had secrets just as significant as her own.

Ethan caught the change in Ivy's gaze and realized he had accidentally revealed too much. But why did she seem to know about the shift in magnetic fields? Could it be...?

Neither of them pressed the matter further; both were aware of the secrets they couldn’t share with outsiders. It was better to remain silent than to speak. There was a rare understanding between them. Clearing his throat, Ethan finally spoke, “I think I've awakened my abilities too.”

As he spoke, he opened his palm, and a small jolt of electric current burst forth, shimmering with a bright silver light.

Ivy’s heart skipped a beat. She recalled a powerful lightning-type ability user from her past, who also had the surname Smith. 

Oh my, could it really be him? He’s quite the golden asset!

In her previous life, Jack had always referred to Ethan in a derogatory manner, filled with jealousy and contempt, as if without Ethan, that formidable lightning ability would have fallen to him instead.

Listening to his complaints about that powerful lightning user, Ivy felt a mix of curiosity and admiration, stemming from an ordinary person’s reverence for those with extraordinary abilities. Her feelings became complex; it was as if her idol from a past life had turned into someone who only mocked her today. It would be no exaggeration to say he had made a complete mess of her past admiration.

While Ivy mourned the loss of her once-heroic idol, Ethan asked, “What about you? What abilities do you have?”

He looked certain that she had also awakened.

Ivy raised an eyebrow. “What makes you so sure I’ve awakened any abilities?”

“Why wouldn’t you?” Ethan countered.

Ivy didn’t respond. Instead, she extended her palm, and the air above it began to condense, frost flowers blossoming until a small ice chunk formed, growing larger and larger until a solid ice block appeared in her hand.

She shoved the ice block into his hands, causing him to jump in surprise from the cold.

He lifted it to his eyes, marveling at the well-formed ice. If only he could create ice like this in the summer when drinks needed cooling. No need for air conditioning—just conjure ice to lower the temperature. Very practical indeed.

Seeming to read his thoughts, Ivy slapped the ice from his hands. “Don’t get any ideas. I’m not about to become some mobile ice machine.”

Probably starving after a few days, Ethan couldn’t resist any longer and went out to find food. Meanwhile, Ivy remained in the training room, lost in thought.

It was already the fourth day, and they were the only two awake in the entire facility. She couldn’t help but worry about whether the others would starve...

Over the past few days, Ivy had arranged for Ethan to check on the others intermittently to ensure nothing unexpected happened.

Fortunately, her worries were unfounded. By the afternoon, people began to awaken in the training ground, their reactions far more normal than before.

As everyone looked bewildered and questioned what had happened, Ethan observed Ivy skillfully manipulating the situation, choosing not to expose the truth.

Mr. Johnson and his son finally woke up in the evening. When Mr. Johnson rushed downstairs and saw that most people had regained consciousness without any casualties, he let out a sigh of relief.

Those who were awake began cooking, while some stayed behind to watch over those still unconscious, with the rest assigned their tasks.

Ivy convened a meeting in the office with Megan, Ethan, and several key members of the Johnson family.

Prior to today, only Ivy, Mr. Johnson, and Grandpa Johnson were aware of the changes in the magnetic field, and Ivy had only mentioned that the magnetic field would change without detailing what that would entail.

The meeting involved discussions among two powerful ability users and other ordinary players about what had happened and what had changed.

Ethan watched as people argued passionately over their differing theories, feeling exasperated. Looking at Ivy’s calm demeanor, he wondered why she wasn’t the least bit bothered, considering she usually despised trouble.

After the heated discussion, Mr. Johnson cleared his throat under Ivy’s increasingly impatient gaze, refocusing everyone’s attention from the causes to the outcomes.

Upon hearing that someone had awakened abilities, the reactions from the group were vastly different.

Some questioned if they were insane, deeming it unscientific and akin to myth. Only after witnessing it firsthand did they relent to belief.

Next came the plan to gather everyone in the facility, regardless of age or gender, in the training ground to determine how many ability users there were.

This would lead to a major restructuring of their roles and responsibilities—one of the facility’s most significant changes.

The core members finally understood the implications of having ability users among them; the disparities in status would directly correlate to the differences in their abilities.

That night, before bed, Ivy trained in her space for a while, primarily focusing on enhancing the offensive power of her ice abilities, like forming ice projectiles that were more streamlined to reduce air resistance and increase firing power.

However, she could currently only condense one at a time, and the speed of condensation was relatively slow, with a certain cooldown time in between, akin to game skill cooldowns.

She understood that in the future, she would certainly be able to upgrade her skills. When zombies crystallized and formed cores, those cores could enhance her abilities based on their attributes.

But this was completely different from the abilities she had seen in powerful users in her past life. Was she truly that weak?

The next day, as noon approached, everyone had finally awakened. Some were already sensing unusual changes in their bodies but still struggled to control their newfound powers.

Ivy had already sparred with Ethan in the training ground, both attacking each other using their abilities.

Ethan easily outperformed her, effortlessly shattering the ice projectiles she had painstakingly formed with a mere flick of his hand.

Desperate, she realized she simply couldn't compete.

Ethan could unleash his abilities without any noticeable cooldown, launching a barrage of attacks that she found impossible to evade.

Feeling humble, Ivy sought his guidance, lamenting her longer cooldown times.

Ethan thought for a moment before responding, “Releasing abilities relies on mental strength. The stronger your mental power, the more powerful your abilities will be.”

Ivy pondered, having thought her mental strength was already at level two—was that not strong enough?

Hmm, why wouldn’t that be considered strong?

Perhaps hitting on the crux of the problem, Ivy began to contemplate. Previously, she had released her ice abilities using a technique akin to foresight. What if she tried a different method?

With this thought, she closed her eyes, calming her mind for a few seconds, concentrating her mental energy into one point. She raised her hand, and three ice projectiles instantly embedded themselves deep into the training ground target, casting colorful reflections in the light—beautiful yet merciless.

Raising her hand again, she conjured three more ice projectiles without any cooldown, swiftly turning the target into a sieve.

Ethan couldn’t help but clap in awe. Amazing, just amazing...

His current advantage stemmed from his memories and experiences from his past life. Yet, this young woman, on her first attempt, was able to unleash such powerful abilities. Just a few words of guidance helped her grasp the key issues—he couldn’t help but feel envious.

He decided it was best to focus on leveling up himself; if the gap became too wide, it would be embarrassing.
