**Collecting Supplies from the Farm Warehouse**

It was another round of mental gymnastics. Ivy felt the heat of the situation increase when one of her associates, with more enthusiasm than sense, sent a flurry of pictures featuring firearms. Ivy's heart skipped a beat—this was not the kind of attention she wanted. She quickly called him up, urging him to retract the images immediately. Thankfully, her team quickly understood the gravity of the situation and schooled him on the importance of discretion.

Her associates picked up on Ivy's nuanced tone, and suddenly, their faces lit up with understanding. They subtly conveyed their willingness to collaborate. Ivy remained composed; if they could pull it off, great, if not, it was no big deal.

She was selective with her partnerships, reaching out only to families with solid strengths and good reputations. She knew well enough that a wrong choice could lead to betrayal, and that was not an option.

Perhaps it was the commotion she stirred up or the watchful eyes of her grandfather’s protectors, but that afternoon she received a call reminding her to be cautious and asking if she needed any help. Ivy appreciated the concern and assured them she would be careful. She conveyed her nonchalance about the materials, and they understood it was just a small investment. As long as their little princess wasn’t scammed, they were satisfied.

She made sure to note down the names of those who had reached out, planning to arrange future matters when she returned home. A second-generation heir with a gemstone operation overseas directly invited her to visit. Ivy understood the implicit offer and readily accepted.

That night, she returned to the farm warehouse to gather supplies. Her team worked efficiently. Besides employee wages and bonuses, everything else had been funneled into purchasing materials.

Ivy arrived under the cover of night, having sent the employees guarding the warehouse home with an easy excuse that she had arranged for others to take over. In loose-fitting athletic gear and a baseball cap pulled low, she slipped into the warehouse with ease.

The four warehouses were situated in the northwest corner of the farm, nestled against the mountains, with a highway on the left. After parking her car in the shadows, she turned off the lights and quickly made her way inside.

The first warehouse on the right was filled with convenience foods: instant noodles, self-heating hotpots, and various canned goods—beef, luncheon meat, fish, and assorted fruits like apples, pears, peaches, and oranges. There were powdered drinks too—soy milk, sesame paste, and rice porridge—all stacked high.

Ivy found the organization brilliant and didn’t bother rearranging anything. With a flick of her wrist and a shift in her focus, she used her spatial ability to transfer all the supplies into her hidden space. The materials appeared neatly organized inside her dimension. Thankfully, everything was boxed up, so she didn’t need to unpack anything to access the contents.

In no time, she cleared out the first warehouse. Though her energy took a slight hit, after a few moments of meditation, she was back to full strength and ready for more.

Next was the second warehouse, stocked with rice, flour, and cooking oil. The vacuum-packed rice formed a mountain, towering higher than any she had seen. Nearby, flour bags were stacked high. She had sourced these staples from top distributors across three nearby states, knowing their importance.

The other side held a variety of cooking oils—peanut, sunflower, olive, tea, and blended oils—along with spices; salt was the most critical, followed by soy sauce, oyster sauce, vinegar, cooking wine, and various sauces.

By the end, the second warehouse was empty, and her collection of supplies in her space grew vast. Yet, considering the expanse of her hidden dimension, she felt she needed even more; her inner hoarder was awakening.

She moved to the third warehouse, which housed snacks, milk, and beverages. Although the milk had a short shelf life, her space kept it fresh. She tucked away an entire row of milk.

Next came the drinks—sodas like cola, sparkling waters, juices, yogurt, milk tea, coffee, and a diverse range of alcoholic beverages. There were plenty of snacks too, including various chips and puffed snacks.

She made sure to stock up on chocolate, insisting only on pure chocolate without substitutes. A collection of nuts—peanuts, sunflower seeds, pine nuts, pistachios, almonds, and cashews—was also included, as these were valuable commodities in tough times.

After clearing the third warehouse, she headed to the fourth. This space mainly contained daily necessities and clothing. Essentials included cleaning products like shower gel, shampoo, soap, and laundry detergent.

Hygiene products were also stocked, with specific brands highlighted. Paper products filled the space—both toilet rolls and tissues, with kitchen paper stacked high.

Safety supplies included insecticides, disinfectants, masks, gloves, and protective suits. For clothing, she partnered with several sports and outdoor brands, focusing on athletic wear and outer clothing.

In less than an hour, all four warehouses were completely cleared out. Ivy rubbed her slightly sore wrists, realizing she needed to work on strengthening her spatial abilities. She felt like she was finally carving out a path for herself.

She arranged for solar generators and battery panels to be connected with manufacturers and planned to stockpile controlled materials like gasoline overseas, relying on the cash flow from her companies. Before her international trip, she tidied up her businesses, with only a few military supply contracts left to finalize once they passed inspection.
