**Chapter: The Disappearance of Brother Mike**

The ability users stationed at the entrance had long heard the buzzing roar of a helicopter. Someone recognized the sound, thinking it belonged to the Houston base, but the noise grew increasingly louder. Soon, a flashy pink helicopter landed with a thunderous clamor right in front of the gate.

The night was pitch black, and Lucy initially worried that James might not see the landing spot clearly and hesitate to land. To her surprise, he smoothly descended to the most suitable position, making her fret over nothing.

As the searchlights at the fortress entrance illuminated the scene, it marked the first time since the apocalypse that anyone had seen a bright pink helicopter. Mary felt a sense of déjà vu—it looked so familiar. Before she could recall why, she saw Lucy and James jump down from the helicopter, and in the next moment, the helicopter vanished.

Using spatial abilities in front of so many people was no longer a burden for Lucy. She had grown powerful enough not to fear anyone's envy or threat, and she suspected that quite a few people already knew about her powers. She was too laid back to hide it, so she just let it be.

It turned out that the more relaxed one became, the more joyful they felt—she was beginning to understand this.

“Wow, Lucy, when did you buy a helicopter?” Mary exclaimed, her jaw nearly dropping.

“Stop saying wow! I sold my car to buy it. Didn’t you know?” Lucy replied, playfully pushing Mary’s chin back up.

“You're kidding, right? I thought you were going to buy a yacht or a cruise ship!” Mary said, her eyes wide with disbelief.

“A cruise ship, but sadly I didn’t manage to get it. I’m broke now,” Lucy admitted with a shrug.

“Oh please, you’re the richest among us!” Mary teased, her mood lightening.

James leaned against the wall, arms crossed, watching the two banter with amusement. He found their playful exchange quite entertaining.

“Hey, what did you two do this afternoon? It wasn’t anything... scandalous, was it?” Mary leaned closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, her expression mischievous.

“It’s not what you think. We were just tracking down some mutated plants. The captain’s team went missing and still hasn’t returned. We ended up discovering the lair of the large ugly flower and spent half a day clearing it out. We’re not even sure if there are more lurking around,” Lucy explained, her tone serious as the conversation turned somber.

Mary sighed heavily, her brows knitted. Her parents and brother had relocated days ago, and she had no idea how they were faring.

It was then that Lucy remembered she needed to contact Brother Mike. They were supposed to have their routine call during the day, but it was already late, and there had been no word.

Unfortunately, the call went unanswered, and a sense of unease washed over her as her eyelids began to twitch. She felt a surge of anxiety and redialed, but still, there was no response. Turning to James, she managed to keep her voice steady as she said, “We can’t reach Brother Mike. We should go check on him.”

James looked slightly incredulous, but realizing that if something had happened, it could be serious, he nodded in agreement. Mary, seeing their expressions, felt a bead of sweat form in her palm. “I’ll go too!” she insisted.

Lucy considered the number of passengers the helicopter could accommodate and decided to bring Alex and Tom along. The fortress would be temporarily left in the care of Sarah and Paul, who would guard it with the ability users.

After returning, Tom took advantage of the moment to refresh his abilities in the lab, keeping a low profile to avoid drawing attention. Alex saw him board the helicopter and wanted to tease him, but Lucy quickly interjected, “Alex, don’t touch Tom anymore. His abilities are quite special. Can you do that?”

Alex looked confused and a little disgruntled, but hearing Lucy’s serious tone, he nodded, understanding the importance of keeping his distance. Although he had no particular fondness for physical contact, he had merely wanted to tease Tom, who always seemed socially anxious.

Seeing that Alex had calmed down, Tom settled into the back seat and fastened his seatbelt.

The helicopter appeared small, but it comfortably accommodated the four of them. Before long, they were airborne, with James skillfully piloting the aircraft towards the alternative base they had identified in a neighboring city.

The distance wasn’t far; they reached their destination in less than half an hour. However, landing at night posed its challenges. Lucy instructed him to find an open area, prioritizing convenience for her spatial abilities.

“Lucy, do you think my parents and brother are safe right now?” Mary asked, her voice trembling with worry. Ever since they couldn’t reach Brother Mike, she had been teetering on the edge of despair.

“Stop scaring yourself. We’ll find them and see what’s going on. Cheer up,” Lucy replied, stepping off the helicopter. She didn’t forget to try calling Brother Mike again, but still, there was no answer.

“Mary, worrying won’t help. You’d be better off gathering your strength. There are not just zombies out there, but also mutated plants. The danger level is high; you need to focus. Staying alive is your priority if you want to find your family,” Alex added, also concerned that Mary might break down. If she did, it would be a disaster.

“Let’s go. We’re close to the base. Keep up,” James said, leading the way. The group walked through the dark streets of the neighboring city, dispatching scattered zombies with ease—one strike, one kill, without any hesitation.

Lucy followed closely behind, feeling relaxed. With an air pistol in one hand and an ice spike in the other, she aimed directly at the zombies' heads. Before they could even get close, they were already knocked down.

Alex joined in from the back, throwing in a few wind blades whenever he saw an opening, enjoying the feeling of being part of the action.

These two seemed to be here just to rack up kills, like max-level players with fully stocked gear, giving the monsters no chance to fight back.

In just over ten minutes, they arrived at the entrance of the designated base. If it weren’t for James leading the way, Lucy would never have thought they would hide in such a place.

A trendy underground bar awaited them. To enter, they had to descend two sloping paths and pass through three doors—one ordinary red security door, designed to blend in with the untouched surroundings, and two others, one equipped with an iron gate and the other a sliding iron door.

There were no escape routes, windows, or doors elsewhere, making it relatively secure. If they couldn’t get out, it meant no one could get in. In fact, every day, zombies wandered around the entrance of this hidden underground bar, but they couldn’t break in.

They gently knocked their secret signal, but no one came to open the door. Just as Lucy was contemplating whether to blow the door open with explosives or blast through the wall, James pulled out a set of keys from his pocket and easily unlocked the outer lock.

Moments later, the group entered the bar, which was eerily silent, as if there were no one inside.

Lucy extended her mental energy outward, but found no sign of life. James also felt puzzled; in such a concealed and secure place, where could so many people have gone?

They quickly scanned the bar’s interior, but not a single person was in sight. Lucy asked James if there were other places they could search.

However, James’s brow furrowed tightly, deeper than hers. Surely, they couldn’t all have been kidnapped? There were no signs of any struggle either. Where had everyone gone?
