**Green Tea Misunderstanding**

A woman in a long designer trench coat, with a sleek V-neck slip dress underneath, approached the base's entrance. Her glossy black hair cascaded down her back, and her face was adorned with expertly applied makeup. Her gaze was fixed on a specific woman standing by her car—Laura Bennett.

Seeing her, the guard quickly shifted his demeanor, replacing his casual attitude with a respectful greeting. "Ms. Carter."

Laura Bennett had already composed herself emotionally by the time the woman reached her, masking her simmering frustration beneath a facade of calm. She was curious to see what this seemingly sweet-talking woman was up to.

Life at the Kunshan base seemed to be treating her well. Laura couldn't help but wonder if she was still playing the role of a close confidante to Felicity Quinn.

Zoe Carter chuckled lightly, noting Laura's seemingly puzzled expression. "What a coincidence to see you again!"

Laura was taken aback. She didn’t expect someone like Zoe to see through her disguise. What was this woman after?

"You know me?" Laura mimicked a curious tone, frowning slightly and asking with feigned innocence.

"Of course! We had a brief encounter last year, but didn’t get a chance to really chat. Now that we meet again, I recognized you right away! Hehe."

Zoe Carter was truly the embodiment of a sweet-talker. If it were anyone else, they might feel flattered, especially with the guards treating her with such deference while being so polite to Laura.

Indeed, the guard's expression softened considerably when he looked at her, practically overflowing with flattery toward Zoe Carter.

Laura pretended to search her memory, then her eyes lit up as she said, "Wasn't it at the Green Valley Park when we were rescued?"

"Yes! I remember you worked at the management office in Green Valley Park, right?"

"That's right! I'm Lisa Hamilton from the administrative department. I was so scared back then that I just wanted to get home and didn't get a chance to talk to you."

"No worries! Since you’re here at the Kunshan base, it seems like we were meant to meet again."

After saying this, Zoe turned to the guard and said, "This is my friend; let her through."

Then she turned back to Laura, adding, "Lisa, I have something to take care of. You go ahead and get your registration card. I'll come find you in the service hall when I'm done."

With a playful wink, she sauntered away.

Laura nearly rolled her eyes. She had already tipped the guard to gain entry, and now she was being told to wait around for her? Ugh!

Originally, she had planned to deal with Zoe Carter, but it wasn’t convenient to act at the entrance. She had bigger priorities with Felicity Quinn.

However, this situation had its advantages. Zoe Carter was so eager to befriend Lisa Hamilton for a reason, and Laura was determined to uncover her intentions.

Deciding on her course of action, she parked her car in front of the service hall after entering the base.

In her stylish outfit, Laura blended in with the crowd of like-minded individuals. Some were powered individuals bringing their families for residency procedures, while she stood among the ordinary survivors in a long line, waiting for her turn to be processed—an experience markedly slower than the fast track for empowered individuals.

She wasn't in a hurry, though. She knew that ordinary survivors without the endorsement of a powered individual had to pay a hefty fee to enter Kunshan Base: either 50 pounds of rice, 60 pounds of mixed grains, or a set amount of other commodities like cigarettes, alcohol, tea, and medicines.

Fortunately, she had prepared in advance. Not wanting to attract too much attention, she opted to pay with 50 pounds of rice. The rice she had stored was of excellent quality, taken from the supplies she had earlier acquired from Maple Leaf Villa base, and she had deliberately packed it in a dirty old sack to disguise it—heavy and cumbersome.

After waiting nearly an hour, she finally reached the front of the line. During her wait, she witnessed two confrontations between powered individuals escalating to the point of violence, only to be stopped by security, and three ordinary people being ejected from the base for attempting to cut in line.

The chaos was relentless. With the inefficiency of Kunshan Base's administrative processes, ordinary people might leave feeling even less secure than before.

After successfully submitting her food supplies, she received her residency proof. Next, she needed to take her paperwork to another window to queue for accommodations.

Laura arrived at 9:30 AM, and it was now nearly noon. She had only managed to complete the residency paperwork and felt a pang of hunger. However, looking at the long line for accommodation, she decided to wait—who knew if she would even finish by the afternoon?

Just as she settled into the end of the line, a commotion erupted ahead. Curious from having overheard the gossip, she leaned forward to see.

It turned out it was lunchtime, and the staff had decided to take a break, hanging a "service paused" sign and rolling down the partition to leave.

Those who had waited a long time were instantly stunned, frantically demanding an explanation.

To their dismay, the staff simply replied that they would resume at two o'clock, and that the morning queue wouldn’t count—first come, first served.

This revelation sent the people at the front into a rage. After arriving early and waiting so long, they now faced another two-hour wait. If they stepped out for lunch, they would lose their spot, and it felt just like the chaotic days before the apocalypse!

What made it worse was that before the apocalypse, there had at least been a numbering system to manage appointments, or online processing. Now, it was all about manual queues, devoid of any number system—utterly ridiculous.

As the most agitated individuals attempted to vault over the counter to grab the staff, the guards arrived. Their attitude was markedly different from how they treated empowered individuals; they wielded tasers without hesitation.

At this moment, the timid ordinary people shrank back, pushing and shoving. Laura stood by the door, thinking how clearly this issue lay with Kunshan Base’s poor administrative system. It was astonishing that an old military region could be so clueless about management processes.

Once the most vocal protesters were subdued and taken away by security, the situation began to calm down. Laura noticed the staff at the service window turn and walk away, realizing that staying here was pointless.

Just as she was about to turn and leave, she felt a tap on her shoulder. Startled, she turned to see Zoe Carter standing there.

With one hand casually tucked into her trench coat pocket and the other waving at her, Zoe was flanked by two tall men standing about five steps away.

Laura forced a smile and greeted her. “Have you finished with your accommodations?”

Zoe replied, "Not yet! I just paid my fees; I haven’t checked in yet because it’s closing time. They won’t be open again until two."

Zoe seemed to understand the inefficiency of the service here. She chuckled lightly and said, "No worries! Let’s grab a bite to eat first, then come back. I’ll give you a heads-up so you don’t have to wait in line."

Laura put on a grateful and admiring expression, which immensely satisfied Zoe, the little sweet-talker.

Following her out of the service hall, they walked toward the cafeteria on the left.

Though both Kunshan Base and the Apocalypse Fort were military installations, Kunshan primarily served as an armed department. It had more buildings, including training grounds and two main areas: the office zone and the accommodation zone. The office area had been partially repurposed to house ordinary survivors, while only those brought in by powered individuals could access the dormitory area.

As they walked, Zoe clung to Laura’s arm, pointing out various buildings and explaining them. Given that Laura had spent five years in Kunshan, she didn’t need the introduction. She feigned ignorance to avoid revealing her past.

Zoe didn’t mention the villa district, located behind the office area, where Quinn and his family, along with several prominent families and military leaders, resided.

Yet, Zoe rambled on, avoiding any direct topics until they reached the second floor of the cafeteria. It was quieter than the bustling first floor, resembling a small diner from the pre-apocalypse era, and not too many powered individuals were present.

Zoe subtly flaunted her privileges at Kunshan Base, satisfied as she watched Laura’s feigned expressions of admiration and envy.
