**System Upgrade**

Ethan Harrison was trying to manage a minor crisis in his deputy's office when he decided to settle in Laura Bennett's office instead. His own space had been assigned to a new team member, a decision he had anticipated, but hearing it confirmed left him feeling a bit displaced.

Noticing his troubled expression, Laura, with a playful glint in her eye, decided to tease him. "Did you forget how dramatically you left this place? You were like a movie star making an exit."

"That was all part of the plan; it had to feel convincing, or no one would buy it," he retorted, trying to maintain his composure.

"Exactly! Assigning your room was just as genuine!"

Ethan fell silent, stretching out on the long couch in Laura's office. His tall frame made it clear the three-seater sofa was too small.

Laura playfully tapped his leg. "Don't mess up my couch!"

Ethan shrugged, shaking his feet. "It’s clean, see?"

"Alright, just stay there. I’m going back to catch some Z’s," she replied, contemplating retrieving something she had stored away. When Ethan leaned over to peek, he realized she had kept his belongings.

She hadn’t tossed his things; she had kept them safe. A broad smile spread across his face as he looked at her warmly.

Feeling a bit awkward under his gaze, Laura tossed a blanket at him. With the blanket over his head, he burst into laughter, pulling it down to find she had left.

In high spirits, Ethan casually draped the blanket over himself. Despite the summer heat outside, the mountain air was cool, making it comfortable to have a cover.

Meanwhile, Laura returned to her room, rubbed her face to wipe away any embarrassment, and entered her secret storage area. She hadn’t been inside for a while and noticed that something seemed off.

"What’s going on? Did you bring something unusual? The energy's all messed up!" a digital assistant warned her.

"Get it out quickly! You can’t have anything messing with the balance here!" 

It was the first time Laura had seen the assistant so flustered; it was usually calm.

She spotted three mutated plant seeds floating inexplicably. It puzzled her why the energy was chaotic. She thought it was just her long absence that made things feel different.

"These are mutated plant seeds. I doubt anyone else could create something like this. Don’t worry, I’ll get them out!" she reassured, reaching out. But a barrier of energy resisted her touch.

With determination, she gripped the seeds tightly, and the assistant urged, "Get them out, and don’t bring anything like this in again!"

Laura nodded and swiftly exited, opening her hand to examine the seeds, though they remained a mystery.

"Why are you back?" Ethan asked, seeing her return.

"It’s these seeds. The system said they’re causing trouble. Can you hold onto them for me?" she said, handing them to him.

Caught off guard, Ethan fell back onto the couch, causing Laura to stumble and land on top of him. They froze, eyes locked, the moment thick with unspoken tension.

Feeling her cheeks heat up, Laura quickly stood, causing the seeds to tumble to the floor.

Ethan sat up, chuckling at her flustered state.

"What’s so funny? Stop laughing!" she pouted, her cheeks puffed up like a little pufferfish.

Unable to resist, Ethan gently pinched her cheek, feeling its warmth. He quickly withdrew his hand before she could react but couldn’t resist giving her another light pinch.

Laura bent down to pick up the seeds scattered on the floor, shoving them back into Ethan’s hand, muttering, "Keep them safe. They’re weird, and who knows how many more there are. Put them in your storage. I’m off!"

She turned to leave, but just as she reached the door, Ethan called out, "Wait! Come back, something’s wrong!"

Thinking he was joking, she halted and turned back. "Don’t mess with me; I’m going to sleep!"

"This is serious! Come back!"

Seeing the earnest look on his face, Laura quickly returned and sat opposite him.

Ethan spoke seriously, "The seeds were absorbed by the system."

Laura’s eyes widened. "What do you mean, 'absorbed'?"

"I mean they disappeared. The system just took them in and upgraded itself," he explained.

Her eyes lit up with excitement. "That’s amazing! A powerful tool! We won’t have to worry about those mutated plants anymore if your system can handle them."

"Exactly! But now I can exchange for some really powerful tools; I just need points," Ethan replied, analyzing the system.

Laura waited eagerly for him to finish, questions ready. After a while, he finally wrapped up his review, and the digital assistant in his system was celebrating, thrilled to have upgraded after all the effort.

"Quiet down, you’re too loud!" Ethan growled, pinching the bridge of his nose to block out the noise.

The screen was flooded with notifications, scrolling rapidly. He focused on the new tools available for exchange, and as he read, his frown deepened. Something felt off.

"Enough with the celebration! What exactly are you?" he demanded, interrupting the assistant’s festive spirit.

The assistant paused, unsure how to respond. Before, it would have casually admitted it didn’t know, but with the recent upgrade, it now had access to more information.

"Don’t play dumb! Just tell me!" 

The assistant trembled, and lines of text flashed across the screen. After a moment, it cautiously responded, "Host, please don’t be so scary. I’m the survival enhancement system!"

"Don’t give me that cheeky tone. What do you mean by 'enhancement'?" 

Ethan pointed at the task list on the screen, which offered an absurd reward for a dystopian scenario.

Ethan couldn’t help but laugh bitterly. If things went that wrong, what good would tools be? After all, he was part of this world too, wasn’t he?

"This has to be a bug! I’ll report it immediately!" the assistant stammered, realizing something was amiss. It hadn’t seen that task before—had it just appeared? Why hadn’t it been informed?
