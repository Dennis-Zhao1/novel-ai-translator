**The System's Flaws**

"I think your space is way more practical than that system," Ethan remarked, immediately casting doubt on the system’s capabilities. The noisy AI on the screen didn’t have the chance to argue back; what could it possibly say? After all, it was using the resources provided by Ethan—it wouldn't be very ethical for a system to insult its host.

With a sigh of exasperation at the host who only knew how to complain, the system went quiet, clearly opting to disengage.

Ivy, puzzled, asked, "But doesn’t the system still let you trade for weapons? That sounds pretty useful. No wonder you’ve never asked me for any gear."

The two were sitting cross-legged on the grass. Not far away, a couch set up by Ivy remained unoccupied, but neither of them seemed interested in sitting on it.

Ethan leisurely reclined, his hands propped behind his head, gazing at the blue sky and fluffy white clouds as he spoke, "The energy in this space has already healed my injuries. That’s pretty powerful in itself. The best part? It’s free."

Ivy quickly understood, realizing that everything in the system required points for exchange. It seemed Ethan had been dealing with the system's limitations for far too long, harboring lots of resentment.

"Have you found any loopholes to earn more points?" she inquired.

By now, Ethan had closed his eyes in relaxation. "Of course I have. I tried a few times, but it played tricks and refused to acknowledge them. There was that time I faced Buqi; I could have taken him out directly! But the noisy AI failed me at a crucial moment, insisting that the main system would find out. I had enough points, but it just didn’t let me exchange them."

His tone was filled with disdain and regret.

Ivy sighed as well. She had given him a rocket launcher, and yet Buqi still managed to survive.

She then recounted the events from the previous night and her suspicions. When she mentioned that using the rocket launcher hadn’t killed Buqi and that he had disappeared, leaving only his eldest son dead, Ethan's first reaction was, “Just as I thought.”

In perfect sync, they both exclaimed, "He has a system/space too?"

Ivy doubted it was a space. If Buqi had one, he wouldn’t have entrusted important supplies and weapons to Zhen.

After explaining her reasoning to Ethan, he fell silent for a moment. The girl was indeed the type to quietly accomplish big things. Initially, their plan had only been to disrupt the engagement ceremony, making it harder for Buqi to form alliances and leaving him in disarray. 

To his surprise, she had directly wiped out his son, cleaned out all his supplies, and killed his enemy in one fell swoop.

Upon further inquiry, he learned that Zhen was one of the survivors from their first encounter. He felt a wave of frustration wash over him; he had inadvertently handed Buqi a valuable ally so early on. How could he not be annoyed?

Especially when Ivy mentioned she had initially wanted to eliminate the scheming Zhen but had been stopped by him, he couldn’t help but feel ridiculous.

In his previous life, he had never heard or seen anyone like Zhen around Buqi. According to Ivy’s description, she must hold significant importance to him, even having a special status at the base.

He genuinely envied Ivy’s lucky fortune, which had come about by sheer happenstance. Now, the most crucial thing they had to face upon leaving was looming ahead.

Ivy glanced at her watch. Not much time had passed outside. She assured him to stay put while she went to wash up in their RV and changed into fresh clothes for him, as he was looking quite disheveled.

After cleaning himself up and changing into the new outfit prepared by Ivy, he emerged looking refreshed and impeccably sharp.

Taking advantage of the moment, Ethan also familiarized himself with the general conditions of the space. He discovered that the water in the lake was not only sweet but had healing properties for internal injuries, rivaling healing-type abilities.

The energy had also significantly widened his meridians, leaving him with a tingling sensation, an exhilarating feeling of energy surging within him.

Estimating it was nearly meal time, Ivy asked him what he wanted to eat. He initially thought she would only bring canned goods or compressed biscuits, but to his surprise, she offered him a choice between a bowl of spicy and sour noodles in her left hand and a takeout box in her right.

Okay, he had been narrow-minded. With a space like this, why stick to canned biscuits or bread? Silently accepting the bowl of spicy and sour noodles she offered, he sat down at the dining table.

Ivy also took a bowl of noodles and sat across from him, accompanied by a heap of skewers and fried snacks she had packed from the night market, along with a chilled soda she had personally prepared.

Despite not usually being a fan of sodas, Ethan felt immensely satisfied at that moment. Aunt Smith’s cooking was already quite good, and the food in the stronghold had always been decent, which was why so many survivors had chosen to stay. He didn't want to admit he was one of them.

Delicious food had a way of soothing the soul, especially in tough times.

After their meal, not much time had passed according to Ivy's watch. Unable to sit still, Ethan took a break before starting his training.

Ivy remained seated, digesting her food while watching him train.

Before long, he noticed that his abilities seemed to be getting stronger. Turning to her, he exclaimed, "My powers seem to have leveled up!"

He had absorbed so many second-level crystal cores without seeing any improvement, but after just one time in the space, he had upgraded. No wonder the noisy AI was always urging him to stick close to Ivy, crying out for help. He had asked it why but it never explained the reason, and now it made sense.

With a hand raised toward the open grass, he unleashed his lightning abilities like a net of electricity, crackling loudly as a group of rabbits nearby were instantly electrocuted.

Embarrassed, he chuckled awkwardly at Ivy, his expression not exactly brilliant.

Ivy could only think to herself, "Are you alright?"

There were genuinely a lot of rabbits in the space; if a few were electrocuted, it wasn’t a big deal. They could reproduce quickly, after all.

In any case, they would eventually be preparing spicy rabbit heads for Aunt Smith later.

Noticing that Ivy was unfazed, he suddenly connected the dots: the signature dishes in the cafeteria, spicy rabbit heads and spicy rabbit chunks, had to have come from somewhere.

To pass the time, they practiced sparring in the space, allowing Ethan to experience the thrill of zero energy consumption.

Was this feeling of unleashing abilities without fatigue truly real?

In the envy and jealousy of Ivy, he leveled up once again.

He truly couldn’t deny it; a strong person was just strong. In his previous life, they had all been powerful beings with mutated abilities, and in this life, he would undoubtedly be no different.

To express his gratitude to Ivy, he insisted on doing what he could. Finally, Ivy, unable to watch any longer, handed him a sickle and pointed to a patch of wheat that had grown robustly.

"This field of wheat is now your responsibility."

Ethan assumed Ivy had planted it as a precaution. He bent down and began to harvest, bundling it up as he went.

In his mind, he wondered whether the young lady didn’t understand farming, noticing that the seeds weren’t planted evenly; some areas were dense while others were sparse.

During this time, Ivy finished cataloging the supplies and weapons she had confiscated from the green tea schemer. She had felt elated at the time of the collection, but now, counting everything, her satisfaction multiplied.

Looking at the neatly stacked pile of supplies and weapons, she thought, this time, even if Buqi didn’t die, he would surely be left in a dire situation.
