**Chapter 1: A Twist of Fate**

"I'm drowning in my family's expectations," Adam remarked with a dry smile, breaking the silence that had settled among his friends. With a hint of bravado, he added, "My dad has a few hideouts. Want me to mark them for you on a Google map?"

"Wow, that's some serious loyalty," someone muttered, trying to lighten the mood.

Adam's expression turned serious as he continued, "My father is extraordinarily paranoid—probably because he's done a lot of morally questionable things and feels guilty. After my older brother passed away, he became even more untrusting. Now he's involved in some seriously dangerous stuff, and I worry you all might not be ready to handle him."

Serena let out a light laugh, clearly skeptical. "So you're worried we can't handle him, yet you're asking us for help? That doesn't add up."

Adam was momentarily stumped by her words. He chuckled awkwardly, trying to regain his composure. "Well, you guys are the only ones capable of dealing with him. I know Ethan from the Longstone Base has a beef with my dad too, but he doesn't have the same strength you all possess."

"That sounds like a backhanded compliment," she said, rolling her eyes. "But seriously, why do you hate your father so much?"

This question had been on Serena's mind for a while. She remembered seeing Adam trying to impress his dad, acting all sweet and eager for approval. Yet here he was, speaking with such disdain. It didn't make sense.

Adam's demeanor shifted as he lowered his gaze, the atmosphere growing heavier. After a long pause, he finally responded, "That man killed my mom and grandpa. He ignored me my whole life. My brother and I were raised by my mom, but after my brother learned how to navigate social situations, Dad took him out for work. I was left at home with Mom. I never thought he’d go so far as to sacrifice his own wife for a mistress, all while pretending to be the grieving husband. It’s disgusting."

From what they knew, Adam’s father, Mr. Smith, had entered their community with his family. Serena recalled meeting his wife in the past, who later died from illness. To think the culprit was Adam’s own father was shocking. Was it really for some other woman? That was ruthless.

Adam’s underlying resentment toward his father’s favoritism was palpable. A dysfunctional family dynamic and the absence of paternal love could definitely explain his brooding nature.

Watching him, Ivy felt a mix of sympathy and sorrow, while Serena couldn’t help but feel a slight ache in her eyes. Thankfully, she knew Ivy wasn’t the type to fall for brooding boys—she was simply drawn to Adam's dark charisma. What a strange taste!

After silently critiquing her friend’s choice in men, Serena turned to Ethan, raising an eyebrow as if to ask for his opinion.

Ethan tilted his head, a smirk playing at the corner of his lips. Serena nodded in understanding.

Oblivious to their silent exchange, Ivy's emotions were a whirlwind. Were these two flirting? Whatever, it was none of her business—she found the broody boy intriguing.

"Do you want your father dead, or do you just want to stop him from harming others?" Ethan asked, cutting straight to the heart of the matter.

Adam was still lost in his thoughts, and without thinking, he replied, "He should die. He deserves it."

Realizing what he had just said, he fumbled with his words, but it was too late. Serena could see this was the raw truth of his feelings. Good. It was about time he felt the sting of betrayal from his own son—this was going to be interesting.

Coming back to reality, Adam dropped the pretense of being sincere. Having already let his true feelings slip, he decided to let go of the facade. "That old man thinks he’s clever just because he’s smart and has a silver tongue. He’s been eyeing my brother's intended since my brother's death. What a joke!"

"And the women around him? They come and go like it's a revolving door. My mom literally died from the stress of his infidelities."

"He's terrified of death yet keeps expanding his hideouts. His subordinates are dwindling, and he’s living in fear, jumping at every little noise. I can’t even find him half the time."

"Now he’s started a cult, claiming to be a savior, spouting nonsense about how the apocalypse is humanity’s punishment for abusing animals and destroying nature. He says we need to repent and redeem ourselves, brainwashing people into becoming his mindless puppets—minions that kill for him."

With each word, Adam’s voice grew more animated, and his eyes glistened with unshed tears. "Do you know what he’s doing? He’s convincing those people to undergo enhancement procedures, telling them the pain will be reduced to just five percent of what it should be, and their abilities will increase by at least one level. But the truth is, the serum is derived from the bodies of the infected. Regular people don’t stand a chance after being injected."

Seizing the moment, Serena asked, "What exactly does he extract from the infected? Blood?"

"Not just blood. There are also brains and cores. I don’t know all the details, but I’ve heard him say that any brains that look ‘old’ aren’t worth using. It’s disgusting."

Serena’s mind raced as she pieced it all together. The infected could upgrade by consuming other infected's cores, while humans needed to absorb a significant amount to barely level up. Adam’s father had exploited this by turning ability users into half-human, half-infected hybrids before having them consume cores to level up.

Now that was a loophole! It was hard to believe he managed to come up with such a twisted plan.

"I’ve told you everything I know, even my dad’s deepest secret. Do you believe I’m being genuine?" Adam asked, looking at them hopefully.

Serena nodded instinctively. This son genuinely wanted his father dead. How ironic, yet commendable.

"I’m so glad you trust me! I’m willing to share any intel you need. Just ask!" Adam’s excitement was palpable, but then he hesitated, trailing off mid-sentence.

Serena noticed he was slipping back into his act, and she massaged her temples in frustration. Fine, if he wanted to play the game, she’d let him.

With three pairs of eyes glued to him, they were all eager to hear what he would reveal next. Adam chuckled awkwardly, as if steeling himself for what he was about to say. "I... I want to inject the ability awakening serum. I want to get stronger. I want to be alive when my dad dies."

The last words came out tight-lipped, as if he was forcing them out.

Ah, the little fox had revealed his tail. So that’s what this roundabout conversation was about. Serena was actually relieved; she needed a test subject for the serum. The timing couldn’t have been more perfect.

However, she put on a troubled expression, pretending to ponder. "You want me to inject you? That’s quite a risk."

Realizing the gravity of his situation, Adam understood he needed to deliver a solid counteroffer. After all, the last two attacks on their community had left many casualties, and the second wave had left no survivors. They couldn’t afford to take any chances.

"My dad has a secret that nobody knows. In exchange for the serum, I’ll tell you."

Serena and Ethan exchanged glances, eyebrows raised in curiosity. Adam, however, was looking at Ivy, who seemed oblivious to the tension. She finally caught on and quickly excused herself, shutting the door behind her.

The remaining trio exchanged glances as Adam swallowed hard. "My dad has something really sinister inside him. My mom once thought he was possessed. Do you know the virus? He created it. He’s the root cause of this apocalypse, bringing disaster to humanity. His ultimate goal is to turn everyone into the infected. So when I say killing him would save humanity, I’m not lying. As long as he lives, everyone is in danger."
