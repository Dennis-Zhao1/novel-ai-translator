**The Assault on Pine Ridge Base**

The military forces were undoubtedly a powerful sight, especially when they converged as one formidable unit.

The only upside was that a thick blanket of snow had covered the checkpoint. The snow removal teams, in an attempt to save time, often piled snow right in the middle of the road.

While the fortifications inside made sure to maintain traffic flow, outside, they didn't hold back. Towering ice pillars stood like sentinels along the road, creating a natural barrier.

At that moment, Charlie couldn’t help but appreciate the unintended genius of these snow removal teams. If they knew the outcome, they would probably be scratching their heads. Mostly, it was sheer laziness that led them to this, but it oddly worked in their favor.

The guards stationed at the forefront, upon spotting a swarm of tanks and armored vehicles approaching, cleverly ducked for cover. They didn't even think of sounding the alarm until several ice pillars were blown to bits, prompting the startled guards to finally activate the sirens.

Sam raced toward the checkpoint, picking up the panicked Charlie, Ethan, and others along the way.

The non-combatants—children, the elderly, and women—had been trained well. In case of an enemy attack, they were to quickly seek shelter in the bomb shelters, having practiced multiple times when the weather was still mild.

Despite the chaos, everyone had the muscle memory ingrained from those drills. The folks in the lab immediately locked their computers and gathered important documents and hard drives, taking whatever supplies they could carry. Those assigned by Sam helped usher them into the bomb shelter.

The bomb shelter was already stocked with food and water, and there were plenty of blankets to keep warm.

When Mrs. Smith entered, she lamented the pot of stew that was about to be finished. Luckily, she had moved the pot aside before leaving. If they wrapped things up quickly, the stew might still be edible.

Though the weapons at the checkpoint had been prepared, they were all stowed away due to the continuous heavy snowfall. The keys to the armory were with Sam, and by the time they raced to the weapons depot, Pine Ridge Base had already launched a fierce assault, bullets and shells raining down like they were free.

Charlie’s heart ached as she watched the entrance of the base, now pockmarked and littered with debris. She had invested a significant amount of money into this place!

The best weapon in the armory was a heavy machine gun, which left Charlie feeling even more ridiculous. After hoarding so many impressive weapons in different places for the family, why weren't they being utilized?

Sam felt a bit embarrassed too. How could he have anticipated that the military would take an interest in them? They came knocking without any prior notice.

Charlie immediately ordered Sam and Ethan to drive to the warehouse and retrieve rocket launchers or anything useful. With the enemy already at their doorstep, there was no need for pleasantries!

Sam waved his hand dismissively, saying it wasn’t necessary to go through all that trouble. He still had people carry weapons from the armory, and Ethan’s team was among them.

Charlie was puzzled by Sam’s intentions. Determined, she decided she could handle it herself. The rocket launchers in her storage were already primed for action.

The young men with combat experience grabbed their weapons and started moving out, but Sam pulled her back.

“It’s too dangerous up front; what would you be doing there? Don’t panic, look at this.”

Sam mysteriously pulled out a black briefcase from the armory's cabinet. Just as Ethan was about to step out, he suddenly paused, turning back with a glimmer in his eyes, intrigued.

Charlie didn’t pay much attention to Ethan’s reaction. She watched as Sam deftly unlocked the briefcase's combination lock. He opened it to reveal one side with a screen and the other filled with buttons and joysticks, resembling a beefed-up computer mixed with a game console.

Sam pulled out a few antennas from the top of the case and fiddled with it for a bit. After pressing a few buttons, the indicator light on the briefcase lit up brightly, albeit in a rather garish color.

At this point, Ethan had moved closer to Sam, his eyes glued to the "computer" on the table, unable to suppress his admiration.

“Sam, you’re incredible! You managed to get your hands on this!”

Charlie was clueless about their cryptic exchange, watching as Sam swaggered out with the open briefcase. She and Ethan hurried after him, and along the way, Charlie kept asking, “What is this thing?”

Of course, no one responded. The group quickly reached the shelter, where they observed the fierce exchange of fire, light machine guns and heavy machine guns already set up and firing like there was no tomorrow.

The enemy occasionally tossed bombs their way, blasting holes in the previously fortified outer walls of the military base.

The checkpoint’s guard post had long since been obliterated, and now, Charlie felt a pang of loss. Materials were scarce in this apocalyptic world; they hadn’t stocked much cement, so rebuilding would mean using what little they had.

Sam hastily started operating the briefcase, while an odd and surreal feeling hung over Charlie.

In an instant, she noticed changes occurring on the high walls to either side, reminiscent of a sci-fi movie, as numerous gun barrels and cannons extended from the towering stone walls.

Their position was actually on the equivalent of the fourth floor of a typical building; the guard post was on the fourth floor, while the checkpoint was on the first.

In a crisis, the guards could retreat through a tunnel, sealing it off behind them. The surrounding walls stood nearly twenty meters high, requiring an aircraft to breach them.

To enter, they would have to blow through the walls directly.

Meanwhile, the enemy was essentially on the first floor, firing upwards. Since standard firearms had limited effectiveness, they had to rely on artillery to bombard them.

As Charlie surveyed the surroundings, she couldn't help but gasp at the sight of so many gun barrels. She had never seen anything like it.

Seeing her astonishment, Sam finally revealed, “This is a thermal weapons system developed by the United States. This is the control module—I specifically had someone come to install it for me. Surprised? The only downside is that I had a short time to learn how to use it, and I didn’t get a manual. I almost forgot how to operate it until just now!”

Charlie was speechless. Sam was truly impressive, managing to keep this from her.

No wonder he had bought so many advanced thermal weapons back then; she hadn’t seen any of them since.

While it was indeed a surprise, there was a greater sense of dread.

Seeing the fortification’s firepower suddenly diminish, a loudspeaker blared from the enemy’s formation.

“Pine Ridge Base hereby requisitions the Smith Family Biomedical Research Team. All team members are to report immediately...”

Upon hearing this voice, Ethan tightened his grip on his weapon. He recognized it was Mike, the most obnoxious and inept lackey of Base Chief Johnson.

He had long suspected that Mike was up to no good, and now, with this turn of events, he wondered what kind of trick they were trying to pull.

Before the enemy could finish their announcement, Sam hesitated as he manipulated the joystick, then pressed a button and muttered, “This should be it. Hope I’m not mistaken.”

After pressing it, he leaned out to take a look, just in time to see a rocket launcher fire from the wall, landing squarely in the enemy’s convoy.

In an instant, several armored vehicles were sent flying into the air, crashing back down and rolling several times, accompanied by a deafening explosion and blinding flames. Charlie witnessed the devastating power of thermal weapons on the battlefield for the first time.

The enemy's formation was immediately thrown into disarray. Some vehicles tried to retreat but ended up colliding with those behind them, creating chaos.

The infantry who had been lying in wait against the walls were equally stunned.

With this level of firepower, there was no way they could take the fortification today, even if they fought to the death.

Sam then received a loudspeaker (a handheld megaphone), saying, “Power on, music...”

The speaker blared the kind of electronic music commonly played at street stalls.

Everyone went silent, exchanging glances of disbelief.

Sam seemed entirely unfazed as he fiddled with the controls. Finally, the music stopped, and he raised the megaphone to shout, “What did you just say? I didn’t hear you; repeat that!”

After a moment of silence, the enemy's convoy repeated, “Pine Ridge Base hereby requisitions the Smith Family Biomedical Research Team...”

This time, Sam didn’t even give them half a chance to finish. He manipulated the joystick again and decisively pressed another button.

A volley of rockets launched, and amidst the series of explosions, the vehicle that had been broadcasting the message was sent skyward.

Ethan, Charlie, Mark, and the others on the front lines wore expressions of collective shock, all left speechless.

Seeing the enemy faltering, Sam quickly urged, “What are you all dawdling for? Get shooting!”

Instantly, all firepower was unleashed. Ethan silently mourned for the enemy; of all people to provoke, they chose the apocalyptic fortress!

What followed was a scene of utter chaos, with the enemy being utterly overwhelmed, desperately retreating, shedding armor and weapons as they fled.

The infantry that hadn’t made it back to their vehicles scrambled on foot, slipping and falling in the icy weather as they hurried to escape.

A group of people stood in the cold wind, watching the military district troops retreat in disarray, their faces covered in dirt and shame.

Sam ignored the inexperienced fools around him. He manipulated the briefcase again, and the gun barrels and cannons retracted back into the stone walls, restoring the fortification to its former appearance.

He assigned people to the lower levels to clean up the battlefield, dragging away the dead and detaining any surviving captives.

After closing the briefcase with a few clicks, he urged his nephews and nieces to hurry up and get to work while he carried the briefcase, driving towards the bomb shelter with Charlie and Ethan in tow.
