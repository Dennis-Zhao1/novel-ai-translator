**Gambling Stone Conference**

With a recent surge in profits, Laura Bennett found her wallet significantly fuller than it had been in a long time. Deciding to create a facade of stability, she kept just enough cash flow visible to cover salaries and bonuses, while discreetly transferring the bulk to her overseas account. Keeping nearly ten billion dollars in domestic accounts was too risky for her taste. With over half a month left before the next financial evaluation, she needed to invest wisely.

After a quick call to update Grandpa Johnson and Uncle Mike on the situation, they too were making moves. Unlike Laura's subtle approach, the Johnson family's strategy was more theatrical, playing out like a soap opera—grumbling heirs dividing assets, squabbling over inheritances, and engaging in backstabbing betrayals. The Johnson family, once renowned for their unity, was now in chaos, leaving observers in the business circles of New York dumbfounded.

The Johnsons, previously known for their solidarity, had begun to fracture under the immense allure of financial gain. Grandpa Johnson's leadership was becoming increasingly outdated, leading to rising tensions.

Wherever there's oppression, rebellion follows. Within a few days, the Johnson family's assets began to flow outwards, with dissatisfaction brewing among shareholders eager to liquidate their holdings and escape the toxic atmosphere. Everyone watching sympathized, acknowledging the inevitable conflicts that arise from living closely for so long—it's always the case that "familiarity breeds contempt."

As the turmoil unfolded, the Johnson family's assets began to scatter. Even Ethan Johnson's holdings were nearly entirely sold off, with all the money funneled into Grandpa Johnson's secure overseas accounts. The speed and brutality of this financial game caused many to spring into action. As soon as word got out that a Johnson family asset was for sale, buyers pounced without hesitation. After all, who would doubt the quality of their businesses? They had their hands in biotechnology and logistics, covering all grounds—land, sea, and air.

The Johnson family maintained the largest decision-making and control rights in the biotechnology and logistics sectors, while other shares were hastily liquidated. The string of numbers in the overseas cash account grew long, enough to make even Laura Bennett envious.

Having money on hand was pointless; it needed to be converted into tangible goods. In the post-apocalyptic world, many items were non-renewable resources, and every little bit needed to be stockpiled.

Soon, the Gemstone Conference was set to begin. That night, Laura flew to the Las Vegas venue, accompanied by a team of bodyguards, with her trusted security expert, Mark Gates, primarily responsible for her safety. The next morning, the venue manager escorted her to the conference site. Today, the four major venues in Vegas were co-hosting the event, and the Bennett family's site had a spot at the table. The raw stones from their own venue were not just for the Bennett Group; most were sold to competitors, overseen by seasoned craftsmen with years of experience, ensuring they didn’t misjudge the quality.

Previously, Laura had only watched the gemstone auctions from the sidelines. She lacked the expertise and insight of the craftsmen, and she wouldn’t trust such a specialized decision to herself. However, this time, with her newfound insight ability and heightened intuition, she was equipped with a tool akin to a treasure scanner, and her mental coverage had expanded significantly.

This time, she hadn’t considered purchasing stones from other vendors, as the quality of stones from her own venue was already sufficient. Ideally, she would walk away with cash from sales, and if any stones didn’t sell, she’d take the raw materials back. In a post-apocalyptic scenario, these would become unclaimed resources. Rather than let them fall into the hands of someone unknown, it was better to keep them in her own space, occupying space and avoiding emptiness.

Before leaving New York, she had sent a supply list to Grandpa Johnson and Uncle Mike. This time, her supplies included everything from food and seeds to fresh meat, fruits, seedlings, fresh vegetables, military rations, and emergency supplies like inflatable boats, life jackets, and tents.

She also included various agricultural tools, both large and small. Grandpa Johnson believed they would likely cultivate the land near their bunker, which he thought was an excellent idea. Although it was mountainous terrain, growing vegetables and fruits wouldn’t be a problem. While they couldn’t plant rice, corn and potatoes were viable options.

This approach addressed long-term sustainability issues, which was more appropriate than merely stockpiling rice, flour, and oil—after all, those had a shelf life, while crops could yield returns annually.

Additionally, she provided a detailed list of medicinal supplies and raw materials. The Johnson family’s business primarily focused on biological science research, and pharmaceuticals were their old profession, so these requests posed no difficulty. Laura was also stockpiling these in Vegas, as she had the resources to spare. Mark Gates watched as Laura began her shopping spree again, feeling an inner calm.

Anyone who had witnessed her buying military arms would find her purchasing food and supplies rather mundane—unless she were to buy an aircraft carrier, he wouldn’t show any surprise.

Feeling bored in the conference, Laura didn’t wait for the chaotic crowd to settle. Instead, she called Mark and began weaving through the throngs of people. Vegas had its own armed factions, and even the bodyguards were equipped with guns when overseas. With her mind on the lady’s pistol stored in her space, she felt secure and instead focused on examining the raw stones displayed by various vendors.

Those unfamiliar with the trade might find it dull—what was interesting about a pile of rough, gray stones? They’d wonder why people were touching and shining flashlights on them; what could they possibly see?

Laura once shared this sentiment. As a gem appraiser, she understood the theory but lacked the practical experience that came from a heritage of stone gambling. The craftsmen sent by each vendor had decades of experience; they had grown up among raw stones. They could tell at a glance, based on the surface texture, lumps, and scars, whether a stone contained jade, how much, and whether it was likely to profit or incur losses.

She once asked her grandfather that if these experts could evaluate the stones, why gamble at all? Wouldn’t the good stones be picked out already, leaving only the dregs for sale?

That logic wasn’t entirely flawed—of course, the prime stones would be taken directly by the main sellers. Some vendors might want to use the conference to hype up their high-quality stones and sell them at inflated prices. As for whether what slipped through the cracks was worthless, it was simply a matter of human limitation; even the most experienced couldn’t predict everything. Their expertise mainly lay in selecting raw stones and evaluating gambling prices. Once a stone proved profitable, its value could multiply in an instant—there were countless examples of people going from rags to riches overnight.

Choosing reputable vendors was crucial for this reason. Good venues, due to their geographical advantages, produced higher quality jade than others. The four major venues were known for this very fact.

In Vegas, the only family from the U.S. was the Bennett family; the others hailed from various countries. Laura couldn’t understand some of the languages spoken around her, but she didn’t mind the discussions and exchanges. Most participants in the gemstone auction were merchants from the U.S.

Some who recognized her came over to greet her, while others merely cast curious glances from a distance. As the new head of Bennett Group, she was quite well-known in the industry.

Keeping a distance from the crowd, she stood near a display of raw stones awaiting auction, her head bowed as if in contemplation. In reality, her insight ability was already in use, and the area covered by her mental power revealed raw stones glowing with varying intensities of color.

The brightest among them were the stones displayed in the showcase—these had been assessed by the venue's craftsmen and were prime candidates for the title of jade king. A few of them even came from her own venue.

The prices would undoubtedly be hiked, but she had no need to stockpile jade; it was better to keep her funds liquid for supplies.

Laura’s main target was the batch of raw materials on the ground, which were relatively low-priced but substantial in size.

Now was the time to take advantage of this cheat-like opportunity; she wouldn’t let it slip away. As her mental power precisely covered the area, her eyes suddenly lit up.

“What is that?” Laura murmured as she lifted her gaze.
