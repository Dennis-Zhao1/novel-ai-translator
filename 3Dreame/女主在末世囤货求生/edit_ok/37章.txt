Title: The Sword's Embrace

In an instant, an unusual phenomenon unfolded before her. Without fully understanding why, Ivy instinctively activated her intuition, honing in on the ornate sword hanging from the wooden beams of the hall. To her astonishment, the sword glimmered with a sharp, silvery light under her gaze. It radiated a chilling aura, as if it possessed a tangible temperature, cold as frost, sending shivers through her senses.

Sensing Ivy's intense scrutiny, Ethan glanced up from the paperwork, a smile spreading across his face. “This is our family's heirloom sword, passed down for a hundred years. Isn’t it beautiful?”

Ivy found herself unable to look away, nodding in agreement. “I think it’s stunning—far more beautiful than any of the ones here.”

Curiosity getting the better of her, she asked, “How much does it cost?”

Ethan paused, scratching his head. “I’m not sure. No one’s ever asked before. I’ll check with my uncle in a bit.”

At that moment, Mr. Smith stepped out to take a phone call, which seemed to last quite a while. When he returned, he was apologizing profusely, careful not to offend this valuable client who had just purchased over ten swords, each crafted by renowned artisans and priced no less than a hundred thousand.

“It’s alright,” Ivy replied with a smile, then pointed at the sword hanging from the ceiling. “Can I take a look at this one?”

Mr. Smith was startled and quickly replied, “That sword is used to ward off evil spirits. It has hung there for a century and cannot be moved.”

His earnestness didn’t seem fabricated. Under her intuition, the sword’s cold radiance intensified, prompting Ivy to swiftly retract her focus and calm her racing heart. Mr. Smith’s words seemed to hold truth; it was their family treasure, and perhaps she should refrain from coveting it. Regardless of the chaotic world outside, its purpose remained intact.

Being a descendant of a family steeped in folklore and tradition, Ivy held a deep respect for the laws of cause and effect. She relaxed her mind and watched Ethan continue writing the order with meticulous care. Instead of urging him to hurry, she took a moment to gaze at the other swords. After a while, she discreetly probed with her intuition again, but none of the swords beneath the one she’d chosen radiated the same brilliance. Truly, a treasured heirloom that had been passed down for generations was unlike any other.

Admiring the sword again, she suddenly sensed something amiss. Was the sword swaying? Was it just her imagination? The movement was slight, but with her heightened senses, Ivy knew she couldn’t be mistaken.

She was so shocked that no sound escaped her lips. Meanwhile, Mr. Smith was busy verifying the accuracy of Ethan's handwritten order, ensuring the pricing was correct to avoid any impact on the transaction.

Ethan, feeling fatigued from writing, slowed his pace. No one was urging him, so he took his time. His uncle, standing nearby, wouldn’t dare slack off; being a bit slow wouldn’t earn him a reprimand.

Mark, who was positioned where he couldn’t see Ivy’s expression, assumed she was still admiring the sword and thought she might want to take a look before leaving. “Even the young lady has things she can’t obtain; money isn’t always everything,” he mused inwardly.

Before he could finish his thoughts, an unexpected event occurred—the sword that had been hanging so steadily suddenly clattered down, landing squarely in Ivy's embrace.

Caught off guard by a sword falling into her arms, Ivy froze, gripping the sword's hilt tightly. Mark's exclamation drew the attention of both Mr. Smith and Ethan, who looked up to see their family heirloom cradled in her arms.

“What…?" Mr. Smith was left dumbfounded, unsure of how to react.

Suddenly, Ethan recalled something. He dashed up the stairs, calling out, “Grandpa! Grandpa, there’s trouble! Quick, come down—the sword fell!”

In the study upstairs, Grandpa Smith was startled by the sudden shout, causing his brush to tremble and drop ink onto a nearly finished work of art. The four prominent characters he had just written read: Dragon Spring Sword.

His masterpiece ruined, his mood soured instantly. He turned and yelled in his dialect, “You little rascal, what nonsense are you spouting? You’re the one in trouble, not me!”

Ethan rushed upstairs, hesitating at the doorway to the study, wary of entering the line of fire. He feared a couple of swats from his grandfather would be disastrous.

Yet he was equally alarmed, pointing back downstairs as he stammered, “Grandpa, the heirloom sword hanging from the beams has fallen!”

Though he spoke quickly, each word was clear. Grandpa Smith was not hard of hearing; he was in excellent health. Upon hearing the news, his eyes widened in shock, and he quickly dropped the brush, hurrying downstairs without a second thought, forgetting about his ruined artwork.

Ivy stood there, almost petrified, clutching the sword, too stunned to move. She had watched it sway and then tumble down, the pain of the impact overshadowed by her shock at what had just occurred.

Grandpa Smith rushed down, swatting away Ethan’s outstretched hand as he descended, clearly annoyed and wanting to avoid any delay. He would have kicked the little rascal for making a fuss if he hadn’t been so preoccupied.

As he finally laid eyes on the young woman sitting in the main hall, clutching the family’s treasured sword that had hung for centuries, his hands began to tremble uncontrollably. Ethan, fearing his grandfather might faint, hurried to guide him to a seat beside Ivy.

Grandpa Smith opened and closed his mouth several times, struggling to find the right words. Finally, Ivy took the initiative, saying, “Sir, I’m just sitting here. I didn’t do anything. Truly, it wasn’t me; it was the sword that fell into my arms.”

She raised the sword as if to prove her innocence.

Grandpa Smith took the sword from her, examining the chain used to hang it. It was made from the same material as the sword itself, forged perfectly, and it remained intact. He looked back up at the wooden beam where the sword had hung, searching for any signs of damage, but his age made it difficult to see clearly.

Ethan, quick-witted, rushed to the back storage room to fetch a ladder. He set it up beside Ivy and climbed up, turning on a powerful flashlight to illuminate the spot where the sword had previously hung. He snapped several photos and recorded a video.

Showing the photos and videos to his grandfather and uncle, they found no abnormalities. The beam protruded a good four inches, with a specially designed groove that was about an inch wide and two inches deep. The hanging chain had been secured in that groove, ensuring it was stable.

The videos and photos revealed the groove was untouched, with no signs of disturbance or dust displaced. It was perplexing. Grandpa Smith examined the area thoroughly, going back and forth multiple times, but everything remained the same.

Baffled and unable to comprehend what had happened, Mr. Smith took the sword from Grandpa Smith, inspecting it for a long time without finding anything unusual.

Feeling a bit awkward, Ivy thought to herself that she had merely used her intuition, so how could the sword not stay put? Wasn’t it supposed to guard the house? Why had it fallen into her arms instead?

The situation felt akin to an ancient scholar inadvertently seducing a cherished young lady after being invited to visit. Especially with her innocent expression and defensive posture, she appeared quite the rogue.

Grandpa Smith and Mr. Smith remained silent for a long time, lost in their thoughts. Ethan dared not speak, while Ivy was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, Grandpa Smith seemed to remember something and urged Ethan to go back upstairs again, insisting he needed to find a box for something.
