**Unexpected Joy**

After sharing his plans with Lorrie, Ethan was surprised when she furrowed her brows and remarked, "So you're saying Bo is just a guy who leans on his in-laws and wife for everything? But why didn't I meet his father-in-law in my past experiences? I joined the Kunshan Base early on and barely saw his wife. Later, he didn't even try to hide his fling with that sly woman."

Ethan pondered for a moment, needing to clarify how this version of Bo had managed to strike a deal with Peter at the Longview Base. He was aware of Peter's desires and felt confident in his negotiating skills.

In the following days, aside from clearing the zombies along the mountain road, they focused on repairing the damaged roadways. They filled the large craters left by the bombardment using earth-based skills, while the road surface was constructed with cement that Lorrie had previously stored in her supplies.

She had once thought about using her resources to build a house but realized it wasn't as simple as she'd hoped. She wished that after her system upgraded, she could conjure things herself, but reality often proved otherwise—a disheartening truth.

Suddenly, she remembered the old house she hadn't been able to take with her. Previously, her psychic abilities weren't strong enough to store something so large. Now that her skills had improved, maybe she could give it another shot.

Over the past few days, Ethan had confirmed that Bo wasn’t relying on his in-laws to settle into the Longview Base. The only support he had was his sinister system, which could control zombies for his own use. Or had he awakened a dark-type ability? After all, in his previous life, he had been an ordinary person. Given that he had awakened abilities in this life, it wasn't impossible for Bo to have undergone a similar transformation.

What exactly was Bo planning? Was he aiming to become the zombie king?

Perhaps he would find out soon enough.

Determined to visit the Longview Base, Ethan informed Lorrie, only to be taken aback when she insisted on accompanying him. He hesitated to agree immediately. In reality, what Peter sought could easily be achieved by Lorrie. However, he chose to keep that to himself, not wanting her to think he was using her for his own purposes. Although they were partners, he genuinely wanted to avoid any feelings of exploitation.

After briefing the team on the next steps for the fortress, everything was finally on track. Although their ammunition reserves had taken a hit, the ability users had received a substantial number of crystal cores from the recent zombie siege. Besides a portion exchanged for daily necessities, the rest were used to enhance their abilities. It wouldn't be long before many of them reached level three, or even became level four ability users.

Strengthening their abilities was fundamental for everyone in the fortress to secure their livelihoods. This operation was a collaboration between two bases, and both Ethan and Lorrie understood that they couldn't infiltrate the Longview Base unnoticed like last time. Instead, they would lead a team openly, and after completing their mission, they could take a detour to the old house to see if she could retrieve it with her enhanced psychic powers.

The team was kept relatively small. Ethan led the group, accompanied by Lorrie, Mike, Anna, and just two squad members, leaving the vice-captain and Julie behind at the fortress.

He instructed Sam and Lucy to conduct another training and selection process for the ordinary people. Some of those who gained confidence from the recent victory against the zombies began to aspire to become guards, hoping to empower themselves to protect the fortress and their loved ones better.

Sam, Julie, Lucy, and others came to see them off, providing final instructions. As they looked into the eager eyes of the crowd, Lorrie waved goodbye as she got into the vehicle. Just as they were about to leave, Dr. Carter and several young researchers rushed over, shouting excitedly, "Lorrie, wait up! We've done it!"

Behind them were a few young researchers, their faces shadowed from countless sleepless nights immersed in their work, yet their eyes sparkled with excitement this time.

Lorrie quickly stepped out of the car and waited for them to catch up.

"The ability activation serum is finished! Lorrie, take a look!"

Dr. Carter presented a silver cylindrical vial, holding it out for her to see. Inside, a light blue liquid shimmered, reflecting a silvery glow under the light—visually stunning.

Ethan and Mike leaned in from either side for a closer look. Lorrie held it up and asked, "Has it been tested?"

Dr. Carter nodded, gesturing toward a shy yet steady young researcher named Luke, who had previously led the charge in dismantling computer hard drives.

As Luke realized everyone's eyes were on him, he smiled awkwardly, raised his hand, and conjured a tender sprout that rapidly grew, wrapping itself around a nearby power pole.

Everyone gasped in astonishment. Was this ability already level two? Typically, a level one wood ability user could only stimulate existing plants; it was at level two that one could directly manifest vines from their palm without needing nearby vegetation.

They all looked at Lorrie, their eyes shining with hope. This meant that with the serum, ordinary people could become ability users, significantly increasing their capacity for self-defense and combat.

However, Lorrie frowned and exchanged glances with Ethan. They both understood that the ability enhancement serum had only been developed in the sixth year of the apocalypse in their previous lives due to the increasing difficulty of utilizing zombie crystal cores. How could an ability activation serum be the first to emerge this time?

Seeing the excitement on everyone's faces contrasted with the complex expressions on Lorrie and Ethan's faces, Dr. Carter assumed they were questioning the safety and authenticity of the serum. He led them toward the lab, excitedly praising Luke's boldness and carefulness in discovering the fusion and separation of several reagent groups, overwhelming them with technical jargon.

But the essence of it was clear: this ability activation serum was a product of fusing and separating the abilities of ability users with zombie crystal cores, enhanced by some special liquids that had been provided by Ethan on a whim.

Feeling somewhat embarrassed by the sudden praise, Ethan noticed Lorrie's gaze towards him. He slowed his pace to whisper to her, "Lake water."

Lorrie gasped internally. Last time, Ethan had casually requested a bottle of lake water to test whether it had healing properties, never expecting it would be used for research in the lab. How could she have overlooked that?

Perhaps she had always thought the water from the small pond was unclean, and even after its upgrade to a lake, she had never dared to drink it.

Later, she definitely needed to take a few sips to see if her abilities had upgraded again.

In reality, she had completely forgotten that the water used for bathing in their RV was connected to the lake, making the relation between drinking the lake water and ability upgrades rather tenuous. But the healing effect was indeed real.

Dr. Carter rambled on excitedly, and when he turned around and noticed that Ethan and Lorrie were trailing behind, he hurried back to pull them into the lab.

Upon entering, Lorrie took in the orderly chaos of the workstations and a row of instruments—some procured before the apocalypse, and others salvaged from the lab on the second sub-level. It felt immensely rewarding to see them all put to good use.

Dr. Carter was even more thrilled than they were, explaining, "Dr. Brown is leading the research on the ability enhancement serum, while I took a different approach to develop the ability activation serum. Luke had a brilliant idea and even volunteered as a test subject. We didn't expect it to succeed so quickly!"

At that, Lorrie felt a twinge of fear. Using oneself as a test subject was risky; what if something went wrong and he turned into a zombie?

Dr. Carter seemed to sense their concerns and chuckled. "We've experimented on rabbits. Some of those rabbits have begun showing signs of abilities, while others have had no effect, but not a single one has died. That's why we dared to test it on ourselves. This version is the best one we've developed based on data and experimentation."

Realizing that they weren’t recklessly experimenting with their lives put her at ease. She learned that Luke had only developed his abilities three days after the injection and had undergone a brain CT scan that revealed the formation of crystal cores in his brain. Now, she felt more at ease with their experimental results.

If things continued to progress like this, the fortress could completely overpower any base, and everyone would become ability users, no longer fearing zombie attacks.

Describing it as an unexpected joy was an understatement.
