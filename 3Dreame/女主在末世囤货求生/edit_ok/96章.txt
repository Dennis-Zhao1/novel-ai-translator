**Secrets Unveiled**

The chaos outside the military base didn't affect Ivy Thompson's determination. Many soldiers rushed by, barely noticing her driving a jeep, mistaking her for a commanding officer or a specialist providing assistance.

As she navigated through the base, the scattered explosion sites became evident, strategically placed to keep the support troops in a state of frantic disarray.

Approaching the combat zone, Ivy noticed the absence of Ethan Blake, her target. She could sense the intensity of the battle between the two factions; with both sides evenly matched, it seemed neither could gain the upper hand.

Determined to find Ethan and bring him to justice, Ivy was unaware that a familiar figure was closing in amidst the chaos.

She turned her vehicle around, intending to head to Ethan's office for clues.

Suddenly, the car door was pulled open. Ivy instinctively reacted, conjuring an ice spike, only to have it shattered mid-air by a bolt of lightning.

It was then that she clearly saw Sean Carter, his clothes stained with blood. In surprise, she asked, "When did you get here? Was the explosion your doing?"

Sean's face was pale; it was unclear how much of the blood was his own. He nodded weakly, saying, "I snuck in after we parted last night. This is my home base; I have some connections. Cough, cough."

After wiping his mouth with his sleeve, he added with a wry grin, "No matter how strong my abilities are, modern firearms take their toll. I need a moment to rest."

He pulled out a small crystal and began to absorb its energy.

Ivy didn't interrupt him; she needed to make a swift exit. Given his injuries, she couldn't just leave him behind, especially since his actions had helped her significantly.

Just as she drove out of the base, Sean suddenly conjured a shield, lunging toward Ivy.

In an instant, she caught sight of his blood-soaked face as he coughed up more blood. The shockwave from another explosion lifted both him and the car off the ground. Instinctively, Ivy pulled him into her hidden dimension.

Within the space, Ivy looked at Sean, who was still lying on her. He was nearly six feet tall—though lean, he was surprisingly heavy. With the shield in his hand, they were easily over four hundred pounds together, making it impossible for her to move.

Seeing she couldn’t push him off, Ivy decided to lie back and relax. After being tense for so long, the soothing energy in the space felt like a warm embrace. She soon drifted off to sleep.

Unbeknownst to her, the mirror in the space started to glow faintly, signaling a change.

Ivy rolled over in her sleep and woke up to find Sean standing there, clutching his chest and looking around in confusion.

Her heart sank with a single thought: “This is bad!”

Her biggest secret had been exposed.

Sean, waking up to find himself on top of the young woman, felt embarrassed. However, as he realized he had no idea where he was, confusion took over.

It felt like another dimension, with a mix of primal aura and seemingly chaotic yet orderly modern artifacts. Some items were understandable—like the RV and modified jeep—but the yacht, helicopter, and a pile of firearms and missile launchers were simply bewildering. The shock in his heart was beyond words; if he had to express it in two words, it would be "What the...?"

Ivy contemplated whether to silence him. Exposing her spatial powers was one thing, but revealing this space was another matter. Yet, thinking about how he had shielded her and risked his life, it was difficult to act on that thought.

Seeing her wake up, Sean stood there with a perplexed expression, lost in thought.

He took the initiative to ask, “Where is this? You don’t happen to have instant teleportation or time travel abilities, do you?”

Ivy looked at him incredulously. What kind of wild imagination was that? She was feeling a mix of annoyance, confusion, and helplessness when suddenly, something clicked, and she stared into Sean's eyes, asking, "Do you have spatial abilities or the power to summon objects? How did you conjure that shield? Don't tell me you've awakened some kind of metal ability?"

Ivy pointed at the black-golden matte shield on the ground. The metal quality and craftsmanship didn’t seem like products from this era. Sean followed her gaze and fell silent.

Well, neither of them was in a better situation.

Ivy crossed her arms defiantly, looking at Sean. Even though he had the upper hand, she didn’t feel at a loss; everyone had their secrets.

Feeling a bit guilty under her gaze, Sean rubbed his nose, still pondering how to explain things.

At that moment, the mirror emitted a faint glow, attracting Ivy's attention.

Upon closer inspection, she noticed a line of text appearing on the previously blank screen: 

"Hello, hello, look at me, right here, beautiful girl, come closer, hee hee."

Sean also noticed, looking up at the mirror with a complex expression.

Ivy was dumbfounded. What was this situation? Did the mirror have a glitch? Or was it being hacked by aliens? No, considering the context, it felt more like possession.

Her mind flitted through a jumble of thoughts until she heard Sean grit his teeth, saying, “What kind of nonsense are you up to?”

Ivy thought he was talking to her, surprised to look at him, only to find that he was still focused on the mirror, not sparing her a glance.

What was going on?

The mirror’s screen continued to input: 

“Relax, host. Didn’t you bring me here for a visit? Big Brother Mirror is really nice and even prepared a luxurious suite for me. So comfortable!”

Sean was speechless. No wonder he hadn’t sensed this noisy thing when he woke up. But what in the world was going on? He looked back at Ivy, only to see her with a serious expression, staring at him as if demanding an explanation.

The situation was getting out of control. Sean realized that unless he explained something, this might not end well, so he resigned himself to speak.

“Do you... read web novels?”

He quickly added, “Male-oriented ones.”

Ivy was bewildered by this nonsensical opening and had to question whether he was joking. Yet Sean was seriously waiting for her answer.

“No.”

Feeling pressured under his gaze, she responded with annoyance.

Sean nodded, satisfied with her answer, and continued, “It’s kind of like the situation of a male protagonist in a fantasy apocalypse web novel.”

Ivy didn’t quite understand and remained silent, looking at him.

“It’s the classic trope of a handsome, powerful, and tragically fated male lead, commonly referred to as a ‘beautiful, strong, and tragic’ character.”

Understanding dawned on Ivy. So he was just that narcissistic.

“Just right, I fit those criteria. So even though I became a powerful ability user in my previous life, I still ended up dying tragically. In this new life, I gained a system to help me, and the ultimate outcome is to reach the pinnacle.”

Sean had initially struggled to say this but found himself speaking more freely. It felt liberating to let go of his inhibitions. He even added a note to save face, “All of this is just a direct quote from the system; I just happened to have a system after my rebirth.”

“Just a system? So humble!” Ivy thought. “How can you be so nonchalant about it?”

Ivy had long suspected he either had precognitive abilities or, like her, was reborn. Yet, she was surprised to learn he had a system. Unable to resist, she asked, “What does this system do? Transform into shields?”

Sean nodded, “The noisy thing’s biggest ability is a weapon exchange function. As long as you have enough points, you can get any weapon.”

He paused, adding, “But it’s different from these; it’s more high-tech and futuristic.”

After gesturing toward the military gear in the distance, he continued, “So, what you’re saying is that this system called the ‘noisy guy’ has more functions than just exchanging weapons. But what are points?”

“Points are earned by completing tasks issued by the noisy guy. Once completed, you can earn points, and crystal cores can also be exchanged for points.”

Ivy understood. The system required transactions to establish a partnership, but how did it communicate with the mirror? What form did it exist in?

Sean had no answer for that either. Seeing she had no further questions, he asked in return, “And what about this mirror? What’s its situation?”

Ivy saw how open he was about his own situation and, having known him for so long without betrayal, hesitated briefly before deciding to reveal more.

She explained the basic situation, and Sean was taken aback.

So she was like him—reborn and bound to a space. Looking around at the environment and the massive stockpile of supplies and weapons, he understood how difficult it had been for her to hide her secrets.

Learning she had tragically died at the hands of Ethan and his allies only fueled his anger, for he had faced a similar fate.

After sharing their secrets, both felt significantly lighter. This exchange of secrets brought them closer together, and it felt surprisingly good.
