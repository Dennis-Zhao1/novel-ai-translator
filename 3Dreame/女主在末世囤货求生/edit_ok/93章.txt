**Playing Along**

As she observed Ivy's self-assured smile, waving off a group of admirers trailing behind her, Lila couldn't help but ask, “Ivy, you seem to have quite the influence around here. How did you manage that?”

“Oh, it's nothing special. I guess being resourceful helps,” Ivy replied, flipping her hair with a touch of pride. Meanwhile, Lila clenched her fists in frustration, reminding herself to stay calm and wait for the right moment to strike back. She maintained a skeptical expression, silently challenging, "You're not fooling me; it can't be that simple."

With a mischievous grin, Ivy leaned closer and whispered in Lila's ear, “Actually, I'm dating Ethan, the heir to the base. That's why folks treat me with respect around here.”

Lila's mind raced with confusion. Didn't this woman belong to me in the past? How did she end up with my son this time? Or was it that she was with him first before moving on to me? What a plot twist!

But she kept her facade, displaying a mix of envy and admiration, saying, “You're so lucky, Ivy! You've really got it all.” Ivy feigned a look of melancholy as she responded, “My boyfriend treats me well. He's the future leader of the community, you know. But his family wants him to marry into a prestigious family to solidify his position. He's turned them down multiple times for my sake. Now, he's being pressured and monitored, and we can't even see each other.”

Lila feigned shock just as the waiter brought their meals. Ivy quickly turned her attention to the food, but once she finished, she resumed her tale. “I don't want him in such a tough spot. I've suggested breaking up several times, but he won't agree. He even considered giving up everything to be with me. I was touched and stopped bringing it up, but he's still trapped by his family.”

Lila took a few bites and uttered the classic line of a curious listener, “And then?”

Wiping the corner of her eye, Ivy grasped Lila's hand with sincerity, imploring, “Lisa, I don't have any real friends here, just people waiting for me to fail. I see you as a sister; can you help me?”

Lila was taken aback. What a sudden twist! Even if Lisa herself came, she’d probably be baffled. This was only their second meeting! Was it really that easy to declare a lifelong friendship?

Putting down her fork, Lila feigned being moved, holding Ivy’s hand tightly. “Ivy, you’ve really been through a lot. How can I help you?”

Ivy’s eyes sparkled with joy as she said it was just a small favor, nothing too complicated, but she couldn’t do it herself because she was being watched. After some probing, Lila discovered that Ivy wanted to use an unfamiliar face to warn the potential bride about her secret relationship with Ethan.

Lila felt uneasy. Was it really that simple? Even if the bride was determined to go through with the engagement, she might not care about past relationships as long as everything was settled before marriage. Marriage alliances weren’t about love; they were about the mutual interests of both families.

Was Ivy really that naive? Or was there more to it than met the eye?

But Lila said, “They don’t inquire about these things before getting engaged? Everyone here must know Ethan has a girlfriend. Isn’t that enough to discourage them?”

Ivy sensed the underlying meaning in Lila’s words. Knowing that her superficial excuse wouldn’t convince her, she bit her lip and said, “Actually, what I want you to do is tell the girl that I’m pregnant. If it was just a relationship, they wouldn’t care, but I’m carrying Ethan's child. That’s their family’s bloodline!”

Understanding her intention, Lila realized Lisa was just a pawn, manipulated into exposing Ivy’s pregnancy. If she could disrupt the engagement, it would be perfect; if not, it would still cause trouble. The family would be compelled to consider the child and protect Ivy more vigilantly, shielding her from retaliation.

What a cunning scheme! Everything was meticulously planned. If this unfolded at the engagement, both families would be forced to rethink.

This was truly brilliant! Lila thought it would be a shame to cut Ivy off; she should be kept around to stir things up. With such a ticking time bomb, it would be interesting to see how the family would handle this mess.

Lila fell silent, deep in thought, while Ivy anxiously watched her, fearing rejection. After a moment, Lila finally looked up and asked, “Ivy, you’re carrying Ethan's child. He shouldn’t be marrying anyone else; otherwise, your child will be without a father. But I just arrived here and don’t fully understand the situation. Can I really help you? I’m worried I might mess things up for you.”

Seeing the delicate woman before her, whose features were striking but whose skin bore the roughness of their world, Ivy realized that Lila had already agreed to help her. She eagerly grasped her hand, saying, “Lisa, don’t worry! I’ll make all the arrangements. Your accommodations and points card will be ready this afternoon. The base is simple; you can wander around for the next couple of days. Don’t worry, I’ll have someone take you to the engagement. Just make sure to talk to the bride. Even if she insists on going through with it, I won’t have any regrets.”

Ivy’s eyes were glued to Lila’s face, desperately seeking a hint of rejection. Time was running out—the engagement was just two days away. If she didn’t find someone suitable to help her, all her efforts over the past year would be in vain.

Lila pretended to be conflicted for a long time, but eventually, she nodded in agreement. Ivy beamed with joy, insisting that they should minimize their meetings over the next few days to avoid drawing attention. In truth, she was terrified of losing this crucial pawn.

After finishing their meal, Ivy made an excuse to leave early. Lila returned to her temporary quarters, bored as she passed the time. By two o’clock, she lazily made her way to the administration office.

Knowing Ivy’s plans, she was certain the promised accommodation and points card would materialize. As for the aftermath of the engagement, Lisa’s fate would undoubtedly be grim. The accommodation and points card would only be useful for a few days.

What a meticulous planner! With someone else shouldering all the risks, Ivy would emerge unscathed while the pawn bore the brunt of both families' wrath. Truly, Ivy had become a master manipulator.

In the administration hall, the lines at the service windows seemed never-ending. The line for accommodation and points cards was still long, if not longer than before. Finding a corner to lean against the wall, Lila watched as the counter staff slowly removed the “suspended services” sign.

The previously noisy hall erupted with even more chatter, the volume rising several decibels. With her keen senses, Lila winced at the sudden noise, covering her ears.

Turning around, she noticed a short man waving at her. Assuming he was someone sent by Ivy, she followed him as he led her out of the bustling hall to a secluded spot. It was there he pulled out a bundle of items from under his arm and handed them to Lila one by one.

“Miss Lisa, right? Here’s your accommodation key card, and this is your points card with 500 points already loaded. It’s usable throughout the entire base. And this…” 

Lila squinted at the USB drive in his hand, puzzled. What was it with this place and their love for USB drives?

With a stoic expression, she accepted it, realizing it was meant for the bride-to-be.

Once all the items were handed over, the short man quickly glanced around before darting away.

Lila tucked the USB drive into her bag and headed straight to her new accommodation. Ivy was using Lisa, so the items she provided were bound to be good. To her surprise, the accommodation was a one-bedroom suite, a privilege usually reserved for those with influence. Giving such a luxurious room to an ordinary person was risky; didn’t they fear she would attract unwanted attention?

Thinking it over, she realized that since she had just arrived and the family was busy with the engagement, it made sense they wouldn’t pay her much mind for now.

Ivy was indeed smart, using all her cunning to manipulate others. With the family, she truly was a perfect match.
