**System Space**

After the system upgrade, everything was unlocked except for the exchange mall and an annoying bug in the tasks. It seemed that after the last bizarre mission, even the system had lost its boldness to flaunt in front of Adam.

This time, the ability to actively call upon it left the system feeling pleasantly surprised. After all, it had hoarded resources earlier and ignored the task bugs, so it was only natural for it to feel a bit guilty.

"What's changed in the storage space after the upgrade?" Adam asked casually, lounging on his bed in the new room assigned to him by Serena Smith.

"Quite a bit! The space can now hold all large items exchanged by the host, even an aircraft carrier can fit in here!" the system chirped excitedly.

"So that means I can store things from the exchange mall too?"

"Absolutely! The storage backpack has unlimited expansion, so feel free to use it!"

"And how do I enter the space?" Adam inquired.

"Huh? What do you mean?" The system was a bit confused; this was new territory for it.

"For example, if I need an emergency escape, can I just enter the space?"

"That... should be possible? I’ve never tried it before. Why don’t you give it a shot now?" The system sounded like a rookie on their first day at a job, clearly lacking experience and finesse.

Adam sighed in exasperation, contemplating who was more unfortunate to have crossed paths with the other. "Alright, let’s try it."

The system responded with excitement, and in the next moment, Adam found himself in a pitch-black space. He called out, "Hey, is there no light in here?"

"Uh... no... I guess?"

Adam rolled his eyes and closed them for a moment. He fished out a small flashlight from his pocket. As he turned it on, he realized the space was indeed vast, giving him the sensation of floating. Though his feet were firmly planted on solid ground, when he reached out, it felt completely empty and surreal. Compared to Serena's space, this was embarrassingly inferior.

"Please don't look down on it, host! The storage space just needs to have enough capacity. It's definitely not the same as Miss Smith's mystical realm. Brother Ethan is on a whole different level; he’s super advanced, while I’m just a small fry here."

Deep down, Adam understood the disparity and nodded, acknowledging the truth. The system's pride was slowly deflating, its voice growing weaker.

Caught up in his thoughts, he didn’t notice the system's diminishing enthusiasm, and Adam himself was not particularly attentive.

"Alright, let's head out."

In the blink of an eye, he found himself back on the bed, not even having changed his position. It appeared that he could inject ability-enhancing serums within the storage space as well, which was a decent enough arrangement. He couldn't be too harsh on the system; despite its shortcomings, it hadn't ever caused him any harm.

Just a few days after Serena announced the arrival of the ability-enhancing serums through the radio, the ability users from the Longview Base arrived at the end-of-days fortress.

Paul had come with his brother, Peter, and a few of his trusted aides, fighting their way through zombies and collecting crystal cores along the way, preparing to enhance their abilities at the fortress before heading back.

Serena welcomed them warmly; this was a great opportunity for profit. Although they were allies, it was still essential to keep things clear, even among friends. Business was business.

Peter was meeting her savior for the first time. She had been excited on the way there, but now that they had arrived at the fortress, nerves took over. She wanted to approach the beautiful older woman but hesitated, gazing longingly. Paul gently ruffled her hair and laughed heartily, pointing at Serena, "You really know how to make money; I’m in total admiration."

"Alright, Mr. Howard, could you take them to the dorms? Just put them in the same place they stayed before," Serena instructed.

Mr. Howard politely led Paul's group to settle in. After a brief rest, they would discuss things further in the afternoon.

The twenty individuals from Longview Base who had arrived earlier were thrilled to see their leader and felt a sense of pride. Each was now an ability user, including Jack, who had a mutated wind ability and had previously enforced discipline in Paul's crew. In this post-apocalyptic world, without abilities, his authority had vanished entirely, and his former subordinates had surpassed him in status, leaving him frustrated for a long time.

Now, he too was an ability user, tightly embracing Paul, his voice choked with emotion as he said, "Boss, I can still follow you!"

Paul smiled widely, his eyes slightly moist. This group had been with him since his early days on the streets, remaining loyal through thick and thin. So even though the price for awakening their abilities was steep, he was more than willing to invest in them.

They shared heartfelt hugs, feeling touched for quite a while before starting to demonstrate their abilities, laughing joyfully.

Peter suddenly asked, "Where’s that girl, Wendy? Why haven't I seen her?"

The atmosphere grew tense as the others exchanged glances, searching for someone to speak on their behalf. Paul directly pointed to Jack, who had emerged as the strongest and most authoritative among them.

"Report, Boss, Miss Smith said she caught her causing trouble in the fortress and she’s been taken away for several days now."

Paul recalled his earlier conversation with Adam and nodded, reassuring Peter, "She's already been dealt with; don’t worry."

Peter was eager to see Serena again. She hadn’t even managed to have a proper conversation with her before; just a brief greeting had made her heart race. Paul teased her, saying that following stars wasn’t supposed to be this exaggerated.

By the afternoon, after Paul and Peter toured the fortress, they were left in awe. "Wealthy people are just different," he thought. While he had merely transformed an old building, Serena had gone ahead and bought a military base to convert into a project, unintentionally creating a paradise in the apocalypse.

Serena and Adam accompanied them, choosing not to address their astonishment but instead smiled gently. As they walked toward the training ground, they noticed that apart from the patrol teams and fixed guards, everyone else needed to engage in daily training. Ethan had trained the captain of the guard and several newly promoted ability users from the military to oversee training tasks, and even ordinary folks were required to participate.

Paul recognized that these ordinary people would eventually be arranged to awaken their abilities, and he felt a newfound respect for Serena’s generosity. She was willing to invest and had an undeniable charm.

No wonder so many people continuously sought to join her. With the ability-enhancing serums, it was entirely possible that the future’s strongest ability users would emerge from this fortress.

They all understood that zombies were becoming increasingly challenging to deal with, especially the wooden zombies—those plants couldn’t be cut down no matter how hard one tried. Only fire ability users could handle them. Serena hadn’t left the fortress for a while, and hearing Paul’s grumbles while catching Adam's eye, she sensed that the zombies must have evolved again.

Fortunately, she had injected the enhancement serum the night before, had a meal, and played with some newly hatched ducklings in the space. Her abilities had risen to level five, unlocking new skills.

Before she could announce this good news, Ann rushed in, breathless, to report, "Miss, that woman has died."
