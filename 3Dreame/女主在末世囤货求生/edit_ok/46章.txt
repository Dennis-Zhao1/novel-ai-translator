### Practice Makes Perfect

The only window without curtains offered a grim view. From the seventeenth floor, Ivy could see at least four or five zombies wandering through the office space. Several bodies lay on the ground, unclear if they were truly dead or about to turn.

The chaos on this floor likely mirrored the entire building, and the conditions on the lower floors remained a mystery. An even greater worry loomed over them: Uncle Smith's family was unaccounted for. Despite only a few days of training, they all sensed this mission would be extremely challenging.

Ivy retrieved the drone, scanning the area. Other survivors were noticing them. She spotted a young woman in her twenties, wearing a professional outfit, frantically waving from an office building near the entrance. Her face was streaked with tears as she tried to get their attention.

“Logan, should we go help her?” Anna asked.

Ethan and Charlie turned to Ivy, awaiting her decision. She hesitated, knowing their primary mission was to find Uncle Smith. Given their limited resources, rushing in to help might not be feasible.

But the hopeful expressions on their faces made Ivy reconsider. She radioed Mike, informing him of the situation on the seventeenth floor, and suggested they use this as an opportunity to practice their skills by scouting a building with fewer zombies.

Mike agreed with the training idea. They had enough supplies—food and water for three days—prepared for a challenging mission.

After exiting the vehicle, everyone drew their swords, falling in line behind Mike and Ivy as they approached the office building where they had seen the survivor.

Mike spotted the woman still waving and gestured for silence, understanding that noise could attract zombies. She wiped her tears but remained quiet.

The building seemed to be an administrative office for the park management. Given the widespread outbreak, this was likely the twentieth incident. On a typical workday, it would be bustling with employees.

The woman was on the third floor in an office facing northeast, allowing her to see the returning drone. The first floor appeared clear of zombies. The group formed a line, finding the fire escape. Mike led the way, with Charlie and Anna closely behind, moving cautiously to the second floor. This was practice, and they aimed to eliminate any zombies they encountered.

Ivy and Mike had planned this approach. Though the property management company wasn't large, the office spaces were vast and sparsely populated. On the second floor, they faced three zombies. Mike lured one over, swiftly dispatching it with his sword.

Zombie blood, thick and dark, oozed from the wound. The zombies weren’t particularly fast, and their recent training boosted their confidence. Courage surged through the group, each eager to face the next zombie.

Before they could argue, the remaining zombies, drawn by the noise, rushed toward them. Ethan and Charlie stepped up—Ethan stabbed his target, while Charlie slashed. They dispatched the zombies with ease, and Mike offered feedback on their techniques. “Ethan, you're still a bit hesitant; your strikes need more decisiveness. Charlie, you've got the bravery but conserve your energy; you're swinging too hard.”

Ethan nodded, determined to overcome his fear, while advising Charlie to conserve stamina instead of exhausting himself all at once. It was all about maximizing efficiency, like in gaming, where you aim for maximum impact with minimal resources.

Charlie nodded and switched places with Ben, Luke, and Anna. Ivy scanned the second-floor offices, finding no more zombies. Suddenly, she thought her intuition might help check the situation on the third floor.

Reaching out mentally, she sensed more zombies above. They kept quiet on the lower level to avoid detection.

Ivy didn’t share her findings with the team, knowing that revealing her abilities could be risky until they encountered other supernatural beings. Once she felt confident, she signaled they could move upstairs.

The group rearranged, with Mike leading again, moving cautiously upward. Ivy stayed in the middle, her intuition and Mike’s experience guiding the less experienced members.

Avoiding injury was crucial; gaining combat experience was the goal. These young men understood their mission, differentiating between humans and zombies, acting decisively when necessary—already setting them apart from many others.

The fire escape door on the third floor was closed. Mike listened carefully before easing it open to peek. Ivy, aware of the zombies' locations, wasn't worried about an ambush.

After scouting, Mike opened the door fully, waving the others to follow. Ivy moved to the back, allowing the eager young men to engage.

The sound of eight pairs of feet was loud, attracting a nearby zombie—a manager with a receding hairline. Its face was smeared with dark blood, claws ready.

Despite its bulk, it charged swiftly. Ben swung his sword, cleaving half its head off. The blade nearly stuck, but he quickly freed it, bringing the zombie down in seconds.

As Ben struck, he let out a shout, and the remaining zombies rushed toward them. He struck again, while Charlie used a chopping motion, Mike kicked a lunging zombie away, and Anna swiftly pierced through its skull with a follow-up strike.

The last zombie was taken down by Luke, who beheaded it with a clean slice. Though headless, it continued snapping its jaws. Luke, disgusted, drove his sword through its skull, destroying the brain and ending its aggression.

With this, the team, except Ivy, achieved their first zombie kills.

After clearing the third floor, Ivy found a closed office door. She knocked.

A voice, tinged with tears, asked, “Who is it?”

“It’s the drone team,” Ivy replied.

Furniture moved inside, and the door finally opened. The woman who had been waving now stood before them, her tear-stained face lighting up in hope, like an angel’s presence.

Tears still in her eyes, she rushed to thank Ivy. Quick on her feet, Ivy dodged, and the woman fell into Mike’s arms instead.

The young men watched, amused. Mike, experienced and composed, steadied the woman and asked about her situation.

Ivy chuckled at Mike’s serious demeanor, noticing his ears turning slightly red. She chose not to tease him about it.

Sometimes, it’s better to leave things unsaid; friends can continue their roles.

The woman introduced herself as Lucy, an employee of the park management office. The outbreak had occurred just before closing on Valentine’s Day. Some colleagues had left early to celebrate, leaving her behind since she was single. She had planned to clean up the break room before leaving when chaos erupted.

Crouched by the window, she witnessed the horror as people were chased down. A few ran into the office building, but fear kept her inside. She spent the time listening to the screams outside, starting with a manager, then others, until there was silence.
