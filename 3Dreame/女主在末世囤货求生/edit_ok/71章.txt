**Chapter Two: The Treasure Museum**

At the heart of the group was a striking young man, reminiscent of a Hollywood heartthrob, who appeared to be in his mid-twenties. The remaining team members shared a similar age range, likely fresh out of college and navigating the early years of adulthood.

Among them were two identical twin brothers—average in looks but significantly tall. Their movements while taking down zombies suggested some martial arts training. The group also included two women: one a high schooler, and the other a woman in her thirties, possessing a distinctive charm.

Observing from a distance, Ivy Morgan hoped they would leave soon. She had taken a significant amount of items from the museum, leaving noticeable gaps. If they were observant, they might suspect her involvement. Exposing her secret stash was not an option; otherwise, she might have to deal with them in a way she preferred to avoid.

Ivy wasn't one for unnecessary violence against strangers; she preferred to keep to herself when possible.

As the group settled down to eat, a young girl suddenly began to cry. Her soft sobs were the kind that grated on Ivy’s nerves, a sound she found particularly hard to bear.

"Alex, little Ruo is so pitiful!" the girl cried, her small frame trembling with each sob.

The group's expressions turned grim. One of the twins, leaning against the wall, spoke up, “We need to find food soon, or we’re in trouble.”

His voice carried frustration and anxiety, mixed with something Ivy couldn't quite identify.

“Alex, let’s save little Ruo!” the sobbing girl pleaded, clutching Alex’s shirt, her tear-streaked face full of hope and despair.

“If you want to go, go. I'm not risking it. It's too dangerous out there. Can you even handle a zombie?” the older woman retorted, clutching her backpack tighter. “If you can save her, do it. But don’t drag others into it. It’s easy to be brave with someone else’s life.”

Ivy, hidden behind a pillar, nearly applauded the older woman for her bluntness. She marveled at how the young girl had survived until now.

The twins nodded, indicating they wouldn’t go either.

“Alex, little Ruo grew up with me! Please, we can distract the zombies and give her a chance!” The girl continued to plead, her cries unrelenting.

“Little Ruo was supposed to join the Maple Forest community. She has a chance if she can get out. Please!” The girl’s pleas echoed, making Ivy feel the noise was almost dizzying.

Alex seemed swayed; he grabbed his bag and crowbar and stood, heading outside.

The little girl’s face immediately brightened as she followed, thanking him endlessly.

The twins exchanged looks, sighed, and followed. The older woman, unwilling to be left behind, cursed a few times but chased after them.

“Maple Forest community? That sounds familiar,” Ivy thought, trying to recall where she’d heard it. Unable to place it, she decided not to dwell on it and quickly left to avoid further encounters.

As she moved past the old city walls, remnants of the historical architecture loomed large, standing resilient despite the passage of time. What was once the political heart of a bygone era had become a solitary tourist attraction.

In the bleakness of the post-apocalyptic world, the place seemed even lonelier.

Her route, meant to avoid zombie gatherings, unexpectedly led her to a sign for the Treasure Museum. Her eyes lit up, and she parked in front of the entrance.

After securing her vehicle, she surveyed the area; it was remote, with no zombies in sight.

Finding no immediate threat, Ivy approached the museum's locked doors. With a swift motion of her enchanted sword, she cut through the iron lock.

The museum was not high-tech. With her flashlight, she scanned the interior. The hall was single-story, decorated in an antique style with exhibits displayed in glass cases.

Realizing time was short, she didn’t waste energy on her divination technique. The museum was teeming with treasures, and she quickly set to work.

Starting with the Buddha statue at the entrance, she methodically moved through the exhibits, collecting everything. It felt like moving house as she gathered supplies, even taking the plant racks.

The museum was a treasure trove of precious gems, gold and silver vessels, pearls and jade, a golden phoenix crown, ivory carvings, and unique treasures of unmatched beauty, including a massive jade sculpture.

She knew these treasures not just by their market value but for their irreplaceable historical significance.

“Is this a dragon robe?” Ivy marveled at a golden garment in a glass case, woven from traditional silk. The golden threads shimmered under her flashlight, and she added it to her collection.

“This coral bead is beautiful!” She admired the mixed treasure style and gathered it.

“Wow, the emperor’s jade seal—Tianhuang stone? The king of stones, this is a rare find!” 

Each item was meticulously crafted, and even market replicas couldn't compare.

Internally delighted, Ivy continued her collection spree.

For the first time, she gathered every item from the museum, almost to the point of scraping the walls and prying up floorboards.

When her mental energy waned, she sat in the corridor connecting the main halls, enjoying some strawberries she had stashed away. Eating fruit in the cold winter was refreshing.

She pulled out a steaming cup of hazelnut taro milk tea. The warm liquid was a comfort, making her feel blissfully content.

Unable to resist, Ivy entered her secret space, surveying the pile of antiques and jewelry. Looking into a mirror, she exclaimed, “Is there anything edible here?”

“I’ve already eaten,” came the quick reply.

Ivy was startled. Just how long had it been hungry?

She circled the display cases but couldn’t identify what had been consumed; there were simply too many items.

“What about the others? Aren’t you going to eat them?”

The remaining treasures were numerous; her face was full of questions.

“Not enough spiritual energy, not eating.”

“Can it upgrade?” she asked, hopeful.

“Insufficient spiritual energy, unable to upgrade.”

Feeling somewhat dejected, Ivy realized that despite all her efforts, she hadn’t found much to fulfill her needs.

Seeing that the mirror’s text no longer changed, she guessed it wasn’t too happy either. She knew she tended to get irritable when hungry.

Exiting the space, she noted the days were short in winter; darkness had already begun to fall.

Without hesitation, Ivy shut the museum doors and drove off.

Rounding a corner, she spotted several figures running from a group of zombies.

Ivy rubbed her forehead. The young girl had indeed risked the lives of four people to save one.

In these times, she realized the first rule should be to avoid those who put others in danger—remember this important lesson.
