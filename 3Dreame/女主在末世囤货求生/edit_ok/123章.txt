**Chapter Two: The Unveiling**

Ivy gripped the shopping cart's handle tightly, trying to push down the mix of resentment and anger bubbling inside her. "The ignorant can't comprehend the unknown," she reminded herself with a wry smile. What did they know, anyway? Keeping her head down, she returned to her duties at the store, where she worked part-time.

Later that evening, during a break, Adam leaned over to share some juicy rumors circulating around the neighborhood with Serena. Many of these rumors were deliberately spread by their own group, aiming to stir the pot and expose any hidden agendas among the residents.

To avoid raising suspicions, Serena feigned uncertainty about a list she had already crafted, claiming that public opinion was forcing her to reconsider. Yet, somehow, the list leaked. 

True to the rumors, several names from the community's security team appeared in the first batch of ten, but only three were actually listed; the others were ordinary folks from various walks of life. The first name on the list, shockingly, was Uncle Joe’s fourth son. An uproar ensued, with many believing that favoritism towards Joe’s family was at play, leading to increased dissatisfaction with them behind closed doors.

It seemed everyone believed that once they had the opportunity to gain new skills, the Joe family would be left in their dust. Funny how people work—once their basic needs are met, they seek ways to outdo one another, as if that would elevate their own status.

After the list was revealed, the ones not included were actually the most relieved. They figured that if the list was real, there’d likely be a reshuffle to avoid accusations of bias. If it was a fake, even better—everyone would have a shot.

Adam was puzzled by this mindset. The resources weren’t limited to just ten; people were so focused on the first batch without realizing this was meant for the whole community. What was all the fuss about?

Serena laughed softly; it was all part of her plan to make everyone believe resources were scarce, that only a fortunate few would get the chance. Everyone was eager to gain new abilities—before, they had no means, but now there was a way. How could they possibly wait?

The next morning, rumors swept through the neighborhood that the new training hadn’t been properly tested; the first batch of participants were merely guinea pigs. Whispers suggested it was a plot to cut down on community resources, concocting a scheme to reduce their numbers. Others speculated that the whole thing was a hoax—little Lu was just a secret genius pretending to be ordinary, waiting for the right moment to reveal the truth.

Liam and others were amazed at how quickly the narrative had shifted overnight, as if an unseen hand was stirring the pot, escalating the tension.

The tense atmosphere enveloping the neighborhood left many feeling anxious. Some people even started gathering to discuss topics that seemed utterly ridiculous in the eyes of Serena and her group, as if they had appointed themselves to decide who would be eligible for the first batch of training.

Adam and his friend took note of the chaos, and upon receiving a call from their contact, Serena smiled slyly. The plan was unfolding perfectly.

Adam had become quite adept at fanning the flames of discontent. His ability to incite frustration towards Mike had multiplied, to the point where people now gritted their teeth at the mere mention of Mike’s name, ignoring the fact that Adam was also part of the new training group—along with three others in his family.

Thanks to his youthful face and friendly demeanor, he had successfully rallied people to form an awakening society, vowing to fight for the benefits of being in the first training batch.

Serena couldn’t understand what leverage they had over the community. Was it merely complaints? Who would care about their grievances without her?

Casting a long line to catch a big fish, the entire situation was unfolding just as she had anticipated. Mike noticed unfamiliar faces sneaking around the outskirts of the neighborhood, but there were no direct confrontations.

The troublemakers were stirring; they wouldn’t stay hidden for long.

This time, Frank was being overly cautious, but it wouldn’t matter—Serena had the confidence to act decisively.

By the time several different methods of distributing the resources had spread through the community, even reaching key members late at night, whispers of hidden rules emerged. After dragging everyone along for a couple more days, on the third morning, Serena launched a lottery event.

As soon as this was announced, Uncle Joe’s fourth son felt a pang of recognition; the idea seemed oddly familiar.

The lottery was simple: everyone would receive a card with a number. Only those who drew matching numbers would qualify to participate in the training program. However, having this qualification didn’t guarantee immediate access. The qualification was transferable; if someone drawn was already skilled or under eighteen, they could pass it on to someone they deemed more suitable.

“Isn’t this just like a raffle for concert tickets?” his friend muttered.

Adam nudged him and pointed to the stage where a large lottery box filled with numbered ping pong balls was being shaken before their eyes.

It looked absurd and out of place, but with so much at stake, everyone held their breath, hoping for a win. Those already skilled appeared indifferent on the surface, though they were secretly anxious.

Some perceptive individuals sensed something was off, though the specifics remained unclear.

The lottery quickly commenced and was over in no time. The ordinary winners were ecstatic, with a few from Joe’s family among them, jumping and cheering. Naturally, there was a fifty-fifty chance for a skilled individual to be drawn. Adam had good luck; when he won, people immediately began trying to get close to him. He had never been so popular.

The old caretaker and Mrs. Li were in the crowd, tasked with monitoring any suspicious behavior. Most winners decided to keep their winnings, while two skilled individuals immediately passed their slots to family members, leaving three others to deliberate on who to share with.

Adam considered giving his slot to his mom or uncle, but his grandfather insisted that if his eldest son also became skilled, the family’s techniques would be lost. His mom’s health was fragile; she might not handle the potential failure that came with the training.

After the meeting concluded, Adam and the other three skilled individuals found themselves surrounded, with people eager to pull them aside for a private chat.

Serena and her friend slipped away from the scene, leaving the stage to them.

Before long, someone rushed in with alarming news.

At that moment, Uncle Joe was in a state of panic, never expecting a scuffle would erupt in the community. Two groups had clashed, and his ordinarily calm fourth son had lashed out at another winner. He couldn't believe his eyes; his fourth son was so envious of anyone else’s good fortune.

The injured person was already taken to the clinic for treatment, with his brother, who had healing skills, present. Unless it was a life-threatening wound, he would survive without any serious complications.

The nature of the incident was serious, yet Uncle Joe remained silent, refusing to defend himself.

Aside from the skilled individuals, most people in the community had split into two factions, with members of the security team mixed among them. The rivalries were so intense that it felt as if they were ready to stomp on Serena’s plans and declare a rebellion.

However, this was exactly what Serena wanted. She arranged for some instigators to stir the pot, fueling the conflict while separating the ringleaders for questioning.

Catching the culprits was simple. Set the bait, stir the waters, and it would be clear who was causing trouble. With Adam offering the training slots as a reward, the first person to report a troublemaker could directly receive a spot. No one cared about alliances or family ties anymore; they quickly turned on one another.

In the past few days, Serena had already sorted out the relationships among these individuals. With her keen insight and sharp senses, it was impossible for them to escape her notice. She was merely taking this opportunity to act with authority.

These people really wouldn’t learn; Adam recalled the actions of Joe’s family’s side branches in the past—how were they any different from today’s crowd?

Serena knew there were moles and traitors within the community, but she hadn’t anticipated there were so many. Frank’s ability to win hearts and manipulate minds had grown significantly.

To her surprise, some of these traitors even included family members of skilled individuals. Serena scoffed; those who played both sides wouldn’t fare well in the long run.

She called for Adam and gave him a few instructions. He nodded, and as night fell, he headed toward the lab.

At that moment, the phone rang, and a familiar voice came through:

“It’s time to prepare for action.”
