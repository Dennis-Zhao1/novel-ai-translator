**Action Three: Adapted Version**

Without any inside help, the group sent by Adam Smith was quickly apprehended by Serena Johnson and her team before they even got close to the secluded mountain wall. 

This advance team, made up of five members, was caught red-handed while still preparing explosives to breach the wall. It was almost laughable. They had received signals indicating chaos within the fortress, completely unaware that the discord had already ended before they even arrived.

Even more amusing was that out of these five individuals, only one had earth-based abilities. Their plan was to breach the wall, enter the fortress, and then somehow seal the hole behind them. After a lengthy interrogation, Serena discovered that their only plan was to send a signal once inside, leaving the rest of their intentions shrouded in mystery.

When Clara Joy received the call, she was slightly surprised. She didn't think Adam was short on manpower, so what was the purpose of this vanguard squad?

Back at her old family home, there had been about a dozen people with three different types of abilities, making this situation truly puzzling.

As they pondered Adam’s intentions, on the opposite hill, Adam's younger brother, Max Lee, was squinting through a pair of binoculars, his brow furrowed.

"Hey Max, by now our people should be inside the fortress. Why hasn't the signal been sent out?" 

"What do you expect me to say?" 

Max irritably tossed the binoculars to his sidekick. They had parked their car at the base of the mountain and climbed a long way to reach this point. Exhausted and now frustrated by the absence of the expected signal, his expression grew even darker.

"Wait, I've got something! Max, we have a signal!" 

Max's sullen face immediately delivered a sharp slap to his sidekick.

"Can you even speak properly?" 

The excited sidekick was stunned by the hit and stammered, "M-Max, we have a signal now!"

Max snatched the binoculars back and indeed saw the white smoke rising as a signal. He smirked, thinking he looked rather cool, and raised his hand with his index and middle fingers extended in a forward gesture.

The sidekick immediately shouted for the others to descend the hill. At the foot of the mountain was another group, concealed by their vehicles, who quickly started their engines to move toward the fortress upon seeing Max’s group.

Their vice-captain brushed off the dirt from his pants and looked up at Serena. 

"Captain, do you think this signal might be a diversion, a trick to lead us astray?" 

Serena was currently administering an electric shock to the captured individuals. She was fed up with their incessant proclamations of being saviors, filled with nonsensical ramblings.

The impatient Ethan Johnson was nearly ready to end them himself, tired of their superstitions and outdated beliefs.

Clara Joy observed the white smoke rising from the back mountain, already prepared for battle, waiting for Adam's group to appear.

By around four or five in the afternoon, a convoy of five or six vehicles gathered at the fortress gate. Max was seated in the central vehicle, well-guarded by ability users in front and behind.

"Max, we've arrived. The sentries are indeed absent; they must be busy fighting inside." 

"Right, blow the gate open." 

With a curt response, Max was well aware of his father’s capabilities. He had already stirred up trouble with several small bases and organizations, either recruiting those he could or letting the others self-destruct. In just a few months, their influence had expanded rapidly.

Although they weren’t as powerful as the folks from the Kunshan base, somehow his father had managed to enhance many ability users' powers, while he remained an ordinary person.

"Max, the gate is open. Should we just go in?" 

The sidekick hesitated. 

"What’s there to discuss? Do you want to wait outside for them to find us?" 

The sidekick, taken aback by the rebuke, quickly organized their entry, and the ability users in the vehicles prepared for combat.

Just as the last vehicle entered the gate, it slammed shut behind them with a loud bang. Nobody noticed that the gate they had blown open was a fake, crafted by earth and metal ability users. The actual military base's gate was not so easily breached by explosives.

Taking advantage of the panic among the vehicle occupants, Clara and her ambushed team sprang into action, unleashing a flurry of abilities. The ability users in the vehicles quickly reacted and began to fight back.

"Hey, don’t you think these ability users are surprisingly strong?" 

An Min released several wind blades, but to his shock, they barely inflicted any damage. He had just advanced to the fourth tier yesterday, qualifying him as a strong ability user, yet these opponents were hardly affected.

Clara Joy's ice spikes accurately pierced several bodies, but the adversaries showed no signs of pain, retaliating with fervor.

This intensity felt eerily reminiscent of battling zombies. A sudden thought struck her — could it be true?

Watching her side gradually falter under the relentless attacks, Clara activated her psychic abilities to target the opponents' cores.

With her mental prowess, she discovered that the cores of these opponents were indeed unusual. Normally, even mutated ability users had cores reflecting their own elemental colors; however, these cores were enveloped in a grayish mist, strikingly similar to zombie cores.

Holy crap, Adam has truly gone mad, creating such monsters! There was no time to dwell on it; locking onto an opponent's ability, she triggered an explosion within their mind.

With a loud pop, one ability user's head exploded, sending Max Lee into a panic, while the only other ordinary sidekick had already wet himself in fear.

Yellow liquid dripped from the vehicle to the ground, and Max, sitting right behind an ability user, found himself splattered with a mix of red and white, letting out a scream before fainting.

Triggering a core explosion consumed a great deal of Clara's mental energy. She needed to quickly absorb the core's power to replenish her strength, immediately locking onto the most aggressive metal ability user, who had already taken down several of her teammates. If it weren't for the earth ability user's shield, they would have been in dire straits.

This metal user’s core was a shiny, golden hue radiating dark mist. Upon closer inspection, Clara noticed a greenish tint to his skin, and he was wearing sunglasses; she could tell his pupils had changed color.

Adam was experimenting on living people!

His goal was to create an undead army — what a lunatic.

A surge of mental energy invaded the mind of the metal ability user, but she felt resistance. It wasn’t overwhelming, but the next moment, a tire with a metallic rim came crashing toward her.

The metal user had noticed her targeting him and retaliated fiercely. Clara was suddenly pulled into a broad chest, and upon looking up in surprise, she found Adam had returned to the fortress and joined the fray.

Their original strategy had been to attack from both inside and out, yet here he was, taking matters into his own hands.

The tire missed its target and crashed to the ground, sending dust flying.

In the next instant, they saw the metal user's head smoking, his sunglasses shattered, as he collapsed to the ground with a massive hole in his skull — he was dead.

Had his powers evolved? How incredibly strong!

Clara stepped out of his embrace, launching ice spikes continuously. With Adam’s involvement, she entrusted the task of executing their opponents to him, and soon, fewer and fewer of the enemy were left standing.

As Adam prepared to strike again, Clara stopped him.

"Leave an intact core for the lab to study."

Hearing this, Adam finally held back, using controlled electricity to strike the last few weakened foes, seemingly inducing paralysis. Those struck fell limp to the ground.

Brother Meng led the remaining live captives away to be taken to the lab, leaving behind a sidekick who had wet himself and Max, whose fingers were burned from the half-smoked cigarette he had been holding.

Clara directed her team to clean up the aftermath, gathering bodies and recovering usable equipment and vehicles. As she turned to approach Max, she asked, "Are we not killing him? Are we waiting for him to be useful?"

As Clara spoke, she raised her hand, causing Max's face to stiffen, his lips trembling as if he wanted to say something.

"What are you doing?" 

Clara's raised hand was seized by a large hand, and she turned to see Adam, towering over her.

Looking at the girl who was glaring at him, he chuckled. "We’ll keep him; he’s useful."

"Yes, yes! I'm not here to attack you guys; I’m here to join your side! Well done!" 

Max hurriedly chimed in, even clapping his hands in enthusiasm.

Everyone else could only stare in disbelief.
