Feeling like she had taken a big hit before, what unfolded before Ivy's eyes was a display case for firearms, the kind that could be folded for storage. The representatives from Saudi Arabia were busy clicking and tapping away, and Ivy watched in awe as they operated the equipment with impressive skill.

It was as if she were watching a Transformer morph from a car into a robot. After affirming her own imagination, she leaned over to Chris and whispered, "Can we buy all these weapons? Do you think they’ll be expensive?"

Without hesitating, Chris asked the representative for a price list. One of the aides handed over a tablet, logging in with a quick input of passwords before unlocking an app that was all set to go. He then passed the device to Ivy.

As she took the tablet, Ivy was pleasantly surprised by how user-friendly the product listings were. Not only did they include the names and models of the products, but also details such as the number of bullets, effective range, weight, dimensions, and bore diameter. Each item came with images and testing videos that showcased their capabilities.

Even better, the app featured a search bar and sorting options for pricing. If it weren’t for the absence of reviews, Ivy might have thought she was browsing an online marketplace, and she couldn’t help but be impressed.

She randomly clicked on a video featuring a rocket launcher. The test showed a soldier shouldering the launcher and firing it, creating a massive explosion that left a gaping hole in the ground—its power was nothing short of astonishing.

Another video displayed a rapid-fire machine gun. Although she wasn’t an expert on firearms, she had seen plenty of action movies and had witnessed the use of such machine guns during thrilling scenes.

However, the prices were still hidden, and when she clicked on the details of the AK-47 she had purchased from Uncle Joe, the price remained a mystery.

She nudged Chris and asked how much the AK-47 was per unit. Chris inquired, and after the representative unlocked the price with a fingerprint scan, Ivy felt a pang in her chest. It wasn't that the price was high; rather, it was surprisingly low—about 70% of what Uncle Joe had quoted her. Just like that, she felt herself losing a third of her investment, and the "buy three, get one free" was gone. For Ivy, this was a frustrating blow.

Seeing her distressed expression, the Saudi representative thought she found the prices too steep. He quickly reassured her, "Our products are of outstanding quality. Even though they are manufactured in-house, they’re renowned for their accuracy, power, and durability."

Ivy composed herself and continued to browse through the videos and images on the tablet. The combination of the testing videos and real products gave her a clearer understanding of the weapons. Ever since her mental powers had amplified, she felt like she had developed a photographic memory, allowing her to read quickly and retain everything.

After checking off her potential purchases, she handed the tablet to the aide for unlocking. As she pondered how much to buy, the Saudi representatives misinterpreted her furrowed brow and thought she was worried about her budget, hoping Chris could negotiate on their behalf.

Not wanting to interrupt her thought process, Chris leaned in and quietly asked in English, "Is the price not suitable? Too expensive?"

Ivy instinctively shook her head, "No, it's too cheap! I want them all."

Chris was left speechless, "..."

Ivy continued, "I bought some before at a much higher price. I lost so much; I need to buy more to bring the average cost down."

Chris felt his urge to translate wither away. "Alright then, I really can’t understand what you wealthy folks are up to."

While waiting for a response from the Saudi representative, Chris translated, "She’s looking to buy in bulk and needs some time to consider. The price is fine."

The representative finally relaxed, sending his aides to prepare coffee and snacks to entertain their high-profile client.

During this time, Ivy also asked her bodyguard about the ratio of firearms to ammunition and their consumption. Ultimately, she settled on a quantity, leaving her bodyguard confused. Was she planning to start a war? He had been under the care of Ivy's family for years and never dared to oppose her, but he really couldn’t understand her actions lately.

After gathering her thoughts, she watched as the Saudi representative returned the tablet. He carefully reviewed the order and the total amount, and a smile he couldn’t suppress crept onto his face.

It seemed like a lot; Ivy appeared to have ordered quite a bit, including explosives, and that didn’t even account for the ammunition and shells.

Before the representative could speak, Ivy turned to Chris and asked, "Do they have tanks or armored vehicles here? The kind with cannons?"

The bodyguard felt a chill run down his spine. "Miss, are you planning to take these somewhere and become a warlord?"

Chris shook his head, indicating that this factory specialized in firearms and that he had no resources for tanks or armored vehicles.

Ivy didn’t seem disheartened. She replied, "That’s okay. If you come across any, please contact me. For now, let’s just order these. I’ll likely need your help with more in the future."

Chris nodded as they calculated the final price and confirmed the delivery timeline. He even managed to secure a small discount and favorable terms. The parties reached an amicable agreement, with a ten-day lead time. During this period, Ivy would need to return home to handle other matters.

They agreed to finalize the transaction in ten days, and Ivy transferred 30% of the deposit into their provided account. However, she kept the password secure, ensuring both parties demonstrated their sincerity and preventing any potential defaults.

While they organized the product quotes and contracts, Ivy took out her phone to calculate her expenses, finally managing to lower the average price of the weapons she had ordered from Uncle Joe.

In the end, she realized that buying more to lower the average price was a savvy move. Compared to other scenarios, these firearms and ammunition were consumables. With the emergence of superhumans, the reliance on firearms had decreased significantly.

However, the stamina and energy of superhumans could still be quickly depleted, and they couldn’t function like perpetual motion machines. In such times, utilizing firearms could serve as a vital supplement.

As she contemplated this, Ivy turned to Chris and asked, "Do you know where I can find cold weapons?"

Chris thought for a moment before responding, "Actually, the U.S. has many places that produce high-quality knives and swords."

Ivy smacked her forehead. "Of course! There are plenty of places here. It looks like I have a destination for my next stop when I return."

Chris chuckled at her childlike excitement as the representatives printed out the quotes and contracts. Under Chris’s witness, both parties signed the agreement. To further express their sincerity, the Saudi representative gifted Ivy a compact, elegant handgun.

Holding the small yet powerful firearm, Ivy felt its lethal potential. With a silencer attached, it was not only low on noise but also capable of taking out a target with ease—truly a treasure for someone venturing out into the world.

As she was led to the testing range, Ivy took aim at a distant target and fired several rounds. It wasn’t surprising for someone with her background to be skilled with a gun.

Her family had encouraged her to learn self-defense skills after her last experience abroad, recognizing the importance of being prepared, and shooting was one of them.
