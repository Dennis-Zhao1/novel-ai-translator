**Disappearance**

They had set their course straight up the mountain, bypassing the winding trail below. Their team leader, a formidable figure known as Ethan, trusted his instincts and urged them to keep climbing higher. The rest of the team, fueled by a mix of loyalty and curiosity, followed without a second thought. As they reached near the summit, they found nothing—no hidden paths, no caves, just the whispering wind.

It was unexpected when they prepared to descend and retrieve their vehicle, only to be ambushed. In Ethan's words, “It felt like being trapped in a sea of hostile jellyfish.”

Ethan, a fire-type ability user, immediately unleashed a series of blazing attacks, creating a fiery barrier that kept the strange creatures at bay. However, one of the newer members, still green in the art of combat, panicked and accidentally fired a distress flare into the sky.

There was no time for reprimands. Ethan rallied them to fight together against the bizarre creatures. Even the wounded team member joined the fray, and the three of them managed to hold their ground for a while. But as their energy dwindled, they were eventually overpowered. Ethan barely escaped but collapsed from exhaustion before he could make it down the mountain.

Ivy examined him carefully; his injuries were minor. The lake water had served as an unexpected remedy, potentially saving his life at a crucial moment.

“What happened to your team leader?” she asked gently.

The injured man suddenly broke down in tears, haunted by the terrifying memories. Ivy didn’t wait for him to recover; she turned her gaze toward the mountaintop and began her ascent.

With her mental energy, she scanned the surroundings. The silence at the peak was uncanny, as if the mountain itself was holding its breath. As she approached, her heart pounded, and despite her experience, a wave of nausea hit her.

At the summit, she found a grotesque garden of mutated red plants, towering and menacing. In the center lay two skeletons, alongside scraps of clothing—remnants of Ethan's team members.

The injured man sobbed openly, collapsing into a heap. Ivy felt a surge of anger; she had invested so much in training alongside Ethan, only to see their lives snuffed out by these monstrous plants.

“Ryan, uproot these plants!” she ordered sharply. Then she unleashed her air cannon, obliterating the grotesque flora into tiny pieces.

The younger team members, including Lily, turned pale, shocked to learn that these plants could consume humans. The bones, stripped of flesh, lay as ghastly reminders of their potential fate.

After swiftly dealing with the scene, Ivy launched a signal flare to regroup her team. There was no time to waste; she couldn’t bear the thought of losing more members.

“Do you want to exchange these small crystal cores for points?” the system asked.

“Not right now. I’m good,” she replied tersely.

“How can you not need anything? I got you access to more options today—want to check them out?” The system's voice was almost playful, like a persistent salesperson.

Sure enough, the system shop had expanded. Beyond weapons, it now offered vehicles, ships, even aircraft carriers—absurdly, even UFOs! She wouldn’t be surprised if space stations were next.

While Ivy anxiously awaited the others, the injured team member sat in a daze, spent from his emotional outburst. Lily tried to comfort him but stopped when she realized he was unresponsive. She sighed, sitting beside Ivy on a large rock.

Ryan had uprooted the visible mutated plants, and Ivy obliterated them, her frustration and despair echoing in the aftermath. She couldn’t help but think about how the families of the fallen would react to their loss.

Soon, Uncle Joe led a team to find Ivy. He scrutinized her, relaxing only when he saw she was unharmed.

He quickly explained the situation, his disbelief evident. As others arrived, they too were stunned by the sight of the skeletons.

Noticing Ivy's low spirits, Uncle Joe took charge, organizing their next steps. However, the last group was still unaccounted for. When Ivy inquired, she learned they were led by the guard captain.

Uncle Joe pulled out a map and marked the guard captain’s location before leading everyone in that direction, hoping for the best.

They carefully gathered the bones, wrapping them in white cloth and placing them in bags to take with them. Together, they descended the mountain, heading toward the northwest where the guard captain was supposed to be.

“Don’t panic; they’re probably fine,” Jake reassured them. He had loaned his car to Uncle Joe, and they were all crammed inside, with Pete and Sam.

“What exactly did you encounter? Mutated plants?” Pete asked.

“Yeah, there were crystal cores too, but they were small and hard to spot,” replied Ivy.

Pete nodded, and the group fell silent as they reached the guard captain’s vehicle location.

“Follow your captain up the mountain, and if you encounter danger, shout out a warning. Don’t be afraid; we’re all in this together,” Ivy instructed as they began ascending. She used her mental energy to scan for any signs of life.

Strangely, the team led by the guard captain was nowhere to be found. The footprints led to a large tree, then vanished.

Ivy felt dread creeping in; her stomach tightened with anxiety.

“No abnormalities detected, Ivy,” Pete said softly as he approached her.

“Do you think it’s possible one of your team defected?” he asked.

Ivy shook her head firmly. “That’s unlikely. Our team is like family; bonds like that don’t break easily.”

She wasn’t sure what had happened, but she refused to leave it unresolved.

“Could they still be alive, somewhere on this mountain, and we just haven’t found them yet?” Jake suggested, standing beside her.

Ivy forced a bitter smile; she could only hope...

As night fell, they had to return. The loss of two team members and the disappearance of three was a heavy burden for Ivy.

After ensuring Ethan was safe, she prepared to lead her people back to the base, planning to return the next day to investigate further.

“Ivy, over here!” A voice called from the distance. It was Anna. Ivy hurried over to see what was happening.

There were bloodstains and signs of a struggle. Her heart leaped with hope as she followed the trail.

The blood droplets were faint, making them easy to lose track of, but finally, in a hidden spot, they discovered something unexpected.

Not the missing individuals, but a massive natural cave.

“Could this be the exit to the pit?” Ivy asked, curiosity piqued.

“We won’t know until we go in,” Jake replied, giving her shoulder a reassuring pat before leading the team inside.
