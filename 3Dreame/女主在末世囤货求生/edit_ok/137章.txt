**Copying Abilities**

Dr. Smith and young Lucas were so startled that their jaws dropped, while Lucy Bennett crossed her arms and thoughtfully pinched her chin.

“Hey there, what's up with your ability? Is there a kind of mutation like this?” Dr. Smith eagerly asked, holding a folder with various data from Leo's awakening process, which didn’t seem any different from others. Lucas was already perceptively grabbing a pen and paper to take notes.

Leo was equally shocked by this sudden ability and quickly composed himself, nearly knocking over the few medical devices in the room. Dr. Smith and Lucas rushed to catch the equipment, but Leo managed to regain control of his power and gently lowered the items, letting out a sigh of relief. Dr. Smith patted his chest, still shaken, and joked, “If you broke something, that would have been quite the bill!”

Lucy encouraged Leo to demonstrate his new ability. Once he realized there wasn’t anything too valuable around—just two tables and some scattered papers—he felt a bit more daring.

As he carefully sensed this unfamiliar power, he could feel the subtle changes it brought him. Unlike Mike’s metal abilities or Lucy’s ice powers, this one had a strong urge to destroy, compelling him to move without restraint. The items in the room began to float, and Lucy urged him to feel his ability more deeply and try to control it. At first, he struggled to balance his destructive impulses with the control he needed, and soon his face turned pale and sweat dripped from his forehead, his raised hand gradually lowering.

Lucy decided it was best to let him rest for a moment, giving his shoulder a reassuring pat, which instantly quelled the destructive urge within him. Taking a breath, he explained his situation to Lucy in detail, while Dr. Smith and Lucas exchanged astonished looks, feeling a chill creep up their spines.

However, Lucy knew that Jack’s ability was certainly created by Frank Boone. But why would he do that? He had previously set up a trap to have her take down Jack—was it a miscalculation on his part?

Still pondering, Leo spoke again about his feelings regarding his powers. “I feel like this ability not only has a strong destructive urge, but it also drains my mental energy.”

Dr. Smith’s interest in Leo intensified; not only Leo but also the unconscious Jack had peculiar powers—one that made everything float and the other that could copy others' abilities for personal use. They both held immense research value, but Leo was terrified of ending up like Jack, trapped in a state of deep sleep, and he quickly refused any experiments.

Dr. Smith wasn’t upset; he had Lucas draw two vials of blood from Leo without forcing him into cooperation. Meanwhile, Lucy assigned him tasks: first, to test the duration of his copying ability, and second, to stay close to metal-type ability users to avoid exposing his unique powers, which could potentially be dangerous.

Leo was still dazed by the rapid succession of events, but hearing the word “danger” made him more cautious, and he nodded in agreement. For typical new ability users, mastering their powers quickly, controlling the output of their mental strength, and improving their ability levels were paramount. For Leo, however, survival was the most important thing. With such a rare ability, finding the right crystal core was incredibly difficult; he could only hope that the ability-enhancement serum from Dr. Taylor would be available soon.

After explaining the situation to Leo, the young man understood his predicament and direction for development. It was truly a double-edged sword, and he agreed to cooperate with Dr. Smith in researching his ability, hoping it might lead to other avenues for improvement.

Lucy highly approved of his attitude. Despite having a mutation ability, he remained grounded and wasn't overly excited. In reality, the young man was quite distressed; leveling up was tough, and he had to rely on other ability users. What if everyone else was at level five or six while he was still a lowly level three? Would he even survive?

Lucy instructed Lucas to escort Leo out while she directly discussed Jack’s abilities with Dr. Smith. Previously, they had only monitored and drawn blood for testing. Now that they had Leo, they had to thoroughly study his abilities as well, since copying powers could be a double-edged sword. If used wisely, it could provide an edge against any mutants or abnormal ability users in the future; if not, it could backfire on him.

Dr. Smith was always one to tackle difficult problems head-on, and hearing this excited him even more. Lucy granted him access, stating that Jack’s life was not her priority; understanding the origin of these abilities was crucial. She had no idea how many similar power users Frank Boone had created or if he was manufacturing more zombie-like ability users. Either way, they couldn’t afford to halt their research or the enhancement of their abilities.

Turning to Dr. Taylor, she checked on the progress of the ability-enhancement serum. Thankfully, they had reached the data analysis phase, and the next step would be human trials. Some X-serum had already been sent over, ensuring that even if it had no effect, it wouldn’t harm the ability users.

The researchers were the second batch of awakened ability users, and they needed to be capable of self-defense. Moreover, having powers could inspire further research directions and methods.

Yet, how many more peaceful days they could enjoy was uncertain. There’s an old saying that when an opponent is quiet, they’re definitely plotting something big.

Back at the training ground, Mike was indeed treating the new ability users like rookies. Other ability users watched the newcomers with a hint of the “old soldiers bullying the fresh recruits” mentality. Lucy directly took Wanda to a quieter part of the training area to prevent the older guys from giving the young girl a hard time, as it would just be cruel.

Wanda hadn’t expected Leo to return. She admitted feeling a pang of jealousy when she saw him leaving with Lucy. Little did she know that fortune would soon come her way.

Lucy, who usually never took anyone under her wing, personally guided her, teaching her how to control her ice abilities and sharing many detailed techniques. It was a generous transfer of knowledge.

Wanda’s eyes widened in astonishment; her excitement was hard to contain, and she had to suppress it to stay calm and focused in her learning—not wanting to disappoint her mentor.

With one eager to teach and the other willing to learn, their progress was much quicker than the chaotic scene across the way. Before long, Wanda could shoot two ice spikes in quick succession, significantly increasing her offensive power.

After all, she was already a level three ability user, which meant she avoided many pitfalls and saved a lot of crystal cores. If they were all fresh level zero recruits, there wouldn’t be enough cores to feed these hungry kids.

The day passed swiftly, and by midnight, someone knocked on Lucy’s door. She sprang up alertly, her mental energy scanning to find it was Fred. Guessing what he was about to say, she opened the door and led him to a secluded corner, whispering, “Are you leaving?”

Fred, who had been hesitating on how to approach the conversation, nodded dumbly when Lucy got straight to the point.

Lucy nodded back and bluntly said, “Goodbye then.”

Fred found it amusing and exasperating, “Do you think I can just leave like this?”

“Why not? Are you planning to take something with you? You can’t just eat and run,” she teased.

“...”

“I mean, shouldn’t you return my car? How am I supposed to get back on foot? Are you not worried I’ll die on the way?”

Lucy wanted to retort, "So what if you die? Why should I care?" But she remembered she was waiting for this filial son to return and stab his father in the back, so she held her tongue and led him to the parking lot, picking a car that had barely half a tank of gas and was a bit old. As Fred eyed the powerful modified car beside them, he opened his mouth to say something, but Lucy interrupted him.

“Just consider this car on loan to you. There’s no need to talk about returns; we owe you nothing. You know what to do when you get back with your father, right? If you dare to break your promise, I’ll send someone to hunt you down,” she warned.

Fred was left speechless, choking on his words. Lucy shoved him into the driver's seat and floored the accelerator, sending him out of the base.

She didn’t drive far; once they were out of sight of the guards, she stopped and got out, ignoring Fred’s expression or mood, turning around and walking away without even a wave goodbye.

Fred finally caught his breath, watching the confident figure of the woman walk away, shaking his head. Partnering with someone like her was just bad luck, he thought, tsking in annoyance.
