**The Little Pig Faces the Old Fox**

This was the unique mark of the Lawson family, a symbol of the connections that Grandpa had left for himself. Initially, Bella Lawson thought that Zachary Davis had spoken to the elders about these matters, but she never expected that the Davis family was actually one of the protective charms in this scenario. No wonder Zachary had suddenly returned to the States and was so cooperative with her.

Suppressing the unease rising in her chest, Bella raised her head slightly and smiled. “Grandpa Davis, I can share my thoughts, but there are too many people in this room, and it’s not very convenient.”

As soon as she said this, aside from Grandpa Davis, all the other elders were taken aback, quickly realizing that Bella really didn’t adhere to traditional etiquette. In families like theirs, the younger generation had been taught since childhood to be polite and respectful, especially when visiting others’ homes. To say something like this was quite unconventional.

Grandpa Davis didn’t give his sons and grandsons a chance to lecture her; instead, he smiled and asked, “Then who do you think is suitable to stay?”

Feeling confident and unyielding, Bella replied firmly, “Grandpa Davis, Uncle Davis, and Young Uncle Davis—only you three are suitable.”

With Grandpa Davis present, the others didn’t dare voice any objections. Not a single disapproving glance was cast toward Bella as they silently left the study, with the last one out even thoughtfully closing the door behind them.

Uncle Davis, knowing the situation, took a seat at the coffee table and began brewing coffee for the others. The study fell into a quiet hush, interrupted only by the soft hissing of the coffee maker.

Grandpa Davis didn’t rush her; he held his cane and gazed at Bella. She placed her folder back on the table, adopting a serious tone as she said, “Grandpa Davis, let’s hurry and stockpile supplies; the apocalypse is coming.”

At this statement, the room fell into stunned silence.

Grandpa Davis was fine; after all, he had weathered many storms in his lifetime. But the expressions on Uncle Davis and Young Uncle Davis's faces were nothing short of shock. However, they wouldn’t dismiss Bella’s words as a joke.

While others might have been confused, Young Uncle Davis was the most like Grandpa Davis in his youth—sharp-eyed, resourceful, bold yet meticulous. Unlike his elder brother, who dedicated himself to biological sciences and innovation, he had the innate sharpness of a businessman.

Thus, Bella’s elaborate and flashy maneuvers appeared to Grandpa Davis and Young Uncle Davis as mere show. The underlying actions were simply quick asset liquidation, with the cash flow remaining a mystery.

It was precisely because they couldn’t trace it that Grandpa Davis had his speculations. He even wondered if Bella had been enchanted by some man and had been swindled out of her wealth. Little did he expect that this was the reason behind her actions.

The apocalypse had been predicted by scientists hundreds of years ago, yet no one took it seriously. So how did Bella come to such a conclusion?

Young Uncle Davis posed the question, and Bella found herself at a loss for words. How could she explain? Rebirth? That was absurd. The apocalypse was already far-fetched enough; adding rebirth into the mix seemed ridiculous, especially since these three weren’t avid readers of web novels.

After pondering for a moment, Bella countered with a question for Grandpa Davis. “Grandpa Davis, are you aware of the numerous ancient texts in my family’s library?”

Grandpa Davis hadn’t expected such a question and nodded instinctively.

Bella continued, “You know how our Lawson family came to be. Our main family used to be associated with metaphysics. It wasn’t until my grandfather’s generation that we started dealing in jewelry.”

Grandpa Davis nodded again; the elders still alive were aware that the Lawson family had originally served in roles that involved astronomical calculations and divination.

“Our Lawson family is still a branch of metaphysics, and we have some knowledge that isn’t meant for outsiders. The origins of the apocalypse prophecy I mentioned aren’t something for others to know.”

“Those willing to believe will believe, and those unwilling to believe can’t be forced. So, Grandpa Davis, do you believe me?”

Bella felt she could say no more. Belief was ultimately up to them.

After a moment of contemplation, Grandpa Davis’s voice was slightly strained as he asked, “What does your apocalypse look like?”

“Humans devouring each other, rising from the dead, free from disease and pain, immortal and indestructible.”

“That sounds like zombies,” Young Uncle Davis, the youngest among them, remarked, logically connecting the dots.

Bella nodded. “It could be explained scientifically—humans are forced to evolve. Some succeed and become what we call ‘superhumans,’ while others fail and become the so-called ‘zombies.’ But the apocalypse will undoubtedly come; it is a globally catastrophic event. Whether other disasters will follow, I do not know.”

Upon hearing this, everyone fell silent. Grandpa Davis was unsure how to respond, while Uncle Davis and Young Uncle Davis remained skeptical.

Such apocalyptic talk was often dismissed as an overused trope in online fiction. They’d rather believe that she had some cunning business strategy at play, which seemed more credible.

However, contrary to everyone’s expectations, Grandpa Davis believed her—not only did he believe, but he also hurriedly inquired about the specific timing and nature of the apocalypse.

His two sons stood by, dumbfounded.

Grandpa Davis’s belief had its roots in history. The Davis family and the Lawson family had once served together. The Lawson family had predicted a calamity that would befall the Davis family a hundred years later, but at the time, no one believed it. Only the Davis family head, who had close ties with the head of the Lawson family, took it seriously.

Some were unconvinced and split off to form their own branch, while the Davis family head turned to commerce, never returning to their former roles. A century later, the predicted calamity struck, and the branch that remained was wiped out. Had the Davis family head’s branch not separated nearly a hundred years prior and given away much of their wealth, they too would have fallen victim.

Grandpa Davis had witnessed the true capabilities of the Lawson family’s descendants. After the decline of the main family, the Lawson branch was left with only a single daughter, as ancient customs valued male heirs for lineage. The Lawson family branch was essentially severed.

Seeing the Lawson family reduced to this state, even if Grandpa Davis didn’t want to believe, he couldn’t convince himself that there was any better reason for Bella’s actions.

Now, if Bella claimed that her ancestors had appeared in a dream, he would believe it.

Having accepted the notion of the apocalypse, the next steps were clear: conserve strength and stockpile supplies.

Even trees shed their leaves to survive the winter; some willingly sacrifice their flourishing branches in order to protect their roots. When spring arrives, the leaves will grow back, and the tree will once again be lush and vibrant.

Families with a history spanning centuries understand this principle best: preserving the roots is paramount before discussing anything else.

Bella didn’t expect to convince Grandpa Davis so easily. There had been too many bizarre occurrences in her life that she couldn’t explain truthfully; the outcome was what mattered.

Thus, when Grandpa Davis asked her how she was currently organizing things, Bella awkwardly pulled out her phone and opened a certain blue app, clicking on the post from a specific user she had saved.

Young Uncle Davis was left speechless.

Internally, Bella thought, *This is so embarrassing; I’ve been caught copying homework!*

Grandpa Davis asked Young Uncle Davis to print it out directly, squinting through his reading glasses as he examined it closely.

“This mind map is indeed astonishing; it categorizes different situations in detail and comprehensively,” Young Uncle Davis commented.

“This is a bit much. Even with our wealth, this isn’t something ordinary people can manage,” Uncle Davis questioned.

Grandpa Davis, however, remained the most composed. “Ordinary people have their own ways of living; we should first consider our own situation.”
