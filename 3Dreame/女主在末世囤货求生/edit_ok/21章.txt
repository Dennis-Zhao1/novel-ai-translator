**Under the Shade of Many Families**

Ivy Thompson nodded thoughtfully. In a world where the unexpected could happen at any moment, she'd seen ordinary people survive and even thrive amidst chaos. Some individuals had risen from obscurity to become influential figures, while those who once held power found themselves struggling to adapt. 

In her experience, the apocalypse had no rules. Trust was scarce, and the absence of a reliable companion was a loneliness she felt deeply.

They say that in dire times, kindness is a luxury few can afford. 

Just as Ivy was lost in thought, the voice of Mr. Smith, an elderly neighbor, pulled her back to reality.

"Ivy, how much have you managed to gather so far?" he asked.

"I’ve only been able to gather a small portion of supplies. Though I’m the only one left in my immediate family, there are many elderly folk from my grandfather's side who depend on me, and I can’t just abandon them," Ivy replied, masking her true intentions.

The others nodded in understanding. Her small family might not have many members, but their extended family was large, with significant resources.

"Then it's settled. We'll handle your share of preparations. Since you're alone, just focus on funding it. Our family has plenty of capable people," Mr. Smith declared, his sons nodding in agreement.

"That sounds perfect! My recent trip abroad was to see if I could acquire any firearms or ammunition. I managed to secure a few through Uncle John, but I’m still unsure how I’ll transport them back," Ivy shared, revealing a tidbit she knew would soon come to light, hoping to keep harmony between the families.

Having decided to lean on the Smith family, Ivy added, "I also want to stockpile oil and gasoline. If the power goes out, we'll need fuel for generators and cars. Solar panels might be a good idea too."

Mr. Smith nodded, marking a few items on the supply list he held. He turned to his nephew, Alex. "You'll handle these personally. I’ll assign others to take care of the rest. Make sure it’s quick and discreet."

Ivy thought for a moment and asked Alex to print another copy of the supply list, highlighting the items she had already procured using money from her various ventures. She handed it to Mr. Smith.

"Grandpa Smith, these are the supplies I’ve already stockpiled and stored at the old family residence. Just deduct these from the total," she stated confidently.

Then, she added, "I can connect with the arms dealers. This trip abroad is a great opportunity because of the connections my grandpa left me."

Initially, Alex was hesitant, but realizing the importance of securing firearms, he understood that Southeast Asia wouldn’t do—there were too many eyes there. Procuring supplies from Europe and America was the best option.

Alex sat down with Ivy to discuss their next steps. She explained the situation with Chris, an enigmatic broker who wouldn’t accept new clients without a proper introduction.

After some discussion, it was decided that Ivy would take charge of securing the arms and supplies, while they would handle the logistics of getting everything back to the country.

This arrangement suited Ivy perfectly, allowing her to conduct business under the guise of important work while being watched by the Smith family.

At this point, Ivy hesitated and tentatively asked, "Grandpa Smith, do you know which family my grandpa entrusted to watch over me besides yours?"

"Are you thinking of notifying these families?" Mr. Smith replied with a question.

"Not necessarily. You know that aside from you, no one would believe me. But I can’t just stand by and watch them unprepared. Even if they dismiss it, at least I’ve done my part. That way, I won’t feel guilty when I see my grandpa again," Ivy explained.

She hadn’t intended to share this, but given her ties to the families her grandpa had arranged, she couldn’t bear the thought of him seeing her as cold-hearted.

Mr. Smith fell silent for a moment before smiling. "Alright then. I’ll find a chance to inform them. You don’t need to worry about that. As for the supplies, hoarding them all in the city is too conspicuous. It’s best to gather them from several places. Let’s leave domestic supplies for our fellow citizens; it might save lives."

Hearing this reassured Ivy, providing her with the perfect excuse to be actively involved while knowing Mr. Smith would help manage things.

With that topic nearly wrapped up, Mr. Smith turned to assign duties to his other relatives. After Ivy took her leave, she went directly to find her friend, Emma, to talk.

Feeling a mix of envy and something she couldn’t quite name, Ivy thought how fortunate Emma was to have her family supporting her, while her own support system had crumbled.

Emma noticed Ivy’s low spirits and simply sat with her in silence until Ivy came to terms with her feelings. The two friends chatted and laughed for a while before Ivy eventually drove away.

In the following days, Ivy kept in touch with Mr. Smith through daily calls, entrusting him with liquidating her joint ventures. This allowed her to relax.

However, an underlying sense of urgency pushed Ivy to prepare as much as possible.

Two days later, when Ivy visited the Smith family’s logistics warehouse, she understood what true efficiency looked like. Talent was the most valuable asset; it was people who made things happen.

Her share of supplies was stored separately in a large warehouse, meticulously organized. Seeing the packaging of items from various countries, she realized Mr. Smith was genuinely working to stockpile resources, offering hope.

Seeing the warehouse full, Ivy sincerely thanked everyone in the Smith family.

“Thank you, Grandpa Smith, and all the uncles and aunts.”

Mr. Smith waved his hand, as if remembering something. He leaned closer and asked in a low voice, “Do you think we should build some kind of fortress or community? Otherwise, with the chaos outside, how can we protect so many supplies?”

Those words struck Ivy like a bolt of lightning. A stronghold seemed like a necessity after all.

Seeing Ivy nod in agreement, Mr. Smith nodded back, a silent understanding passing between them, setting them apart from others.
