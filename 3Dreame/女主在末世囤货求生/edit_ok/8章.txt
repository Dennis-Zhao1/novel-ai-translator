**Welcome to the Swap Circle**

After a quick shopping spree, I treated myself to a relaxing spa session—who could blame me? As part of the well-known Smith family, it's only natural to grumble about sore muscles after a long day.

It was still early, and the bar wouldn't really get lively until around 10 PM. With over an hour of pampering behind me, my timing was perfect.

As my friend Yidan likes to say, “What kind of VIP shows up right on time? Let's take it easy.”

By about 10:30 PM, we were all dolled up, and the stylist had worked her magic. Feeling fabulous, we linked arms and headed to the bar.

The parking lot was filled with luxury cars, but we didn't pay much attention. Suddenly, a woman burst out of one of the flashy vehicles, sprinting toward us with wild abandon, a bald man in a suit hot on her heels. 

I quickly nudged my friend Yidan, and we sidestepped to let her pass.

The bald man was tall and muscular, moving with surprising speed. The woman’s hair was a chaotic mess, strands flying everywhere as she ran for her life.

I didn’t catch a clear glimpse of her face, but her frantic form seemed oddly familiar for a fleeting moment. In the blink of an eye, they were gone, and I shrugged off the strange feeling—it wasn’t our problem.

**Inside the Bar’s Private Lounge**

The vibrant lights pulsed in sync with the music, creating an electric atmosphere. The bar owner was a friend of mine, who’d already arranged an impressive spread of drinks, snacks, and games for us.

Friends began to trickle in, mostly waiting for Yidan and me to arrive.

As we chatted, the girls clustered together, discussing beauty tips, fashion trends, and celebrity gossip. The guys, on the other hand, were still buzzing about their car purchases from earlier that day, boasting about their new “babies”—the ones shining under the showroom lights.

Some were eager enough to arrive early, parking right out front without a care in the world.

As I parked the car, I noticed several familiar “daughters of privilege” milling about, including that limited edition peacock blue Ferrari from earlier. Under the club’s lights, it had a strikingly cool sheen that made me chuckle at their need to show off...

Once Yidan and I arrived, the party truly kicked off. People darted around, mingling, chatting, and drinking, but many gravitated toward Yidan and me, drawn by our prestigious family backgrounds.

After we raised our glasses in a toast, one of the girls boldly asked me about the price of my estate. A few others looked surprised by her directness, unsure if it would provoke me, but curiosity won out; they had never bought anything like it and had no idea about the costs involved.

Instead of revealing the price outright, I handed her the appraisal report, which had a hefty number. The report was long, filled with pages of details.

She stared wide-eyed, her shock stripping away the composure expected of someone from a wealthy family. Who would have thought owning an estate would cost so much? It wasn’t just the price that was shocking; some of them could actually afford it, but the value-for-money was questionable.

Whether out of envy or admiration, her words dripped with a hint of bitterness.

“I’m so jealous of you! A little princess like you should live in a castle! Out of all of us, only you have one. My dad always says I’m a princess, but where’s my castle? It’s a lie! What kind of princess doesn’t have a castle?”

I chuckled at her comment, wanting to ease her discontent. “Don't say that. I’ve never even been to the estate, and my dad passed away before he could give it to me. It just reminds me of him; I don’t feel happy about it. It doesn’t belong to me; it’s meant for the true princess waiting to take her place.”

Her mood lightened a bit, but she still lamented the fact that liking something was irrelevant if you couldn't afford it. The price of that estate equated to all her family’s cash flow, and there was no way her parents would let her use it to purchase a foreign estate.

The other girls sitting nearby were also calculating whether they could accept such a price, knowing that anyone who saw the estate would agree it was worth every penny.

Unlike the typical image of a castle, the one my father gifted me was a sprawling complex, complete with a moat, a vineyard, a vast farm, and a racetrack.

You could easily film an ancient European movie there, with wide streets, shops, a market, and the majestic main castle standing tall in the center.

It was practically a small city. As I talked about it without boasting, a few of the guys leaned in to listen, intrigued by the winery’s fine wines and the thrill of the racetrack.

Maintaining such an estate wasn’t cheap, given it was a historical artifact needing proper care. The paintings inside were genuine pieces by deceased masters, and many of the decorations were antiques, adding to its value.

When considering the appraisal and the actual situation, the estate was not just a building; it was a combination of the structure, antiques, paintings, and the vineyard and racetrack.

Furthermore, wealth alone didn’t guarantee ownership. My father must have invested significant time, money, and connections to acquire it—a stroke of luck, really.

The girls were mainly enchanted by the estate's beauty, while the guys with sharper minds quietly began discussing this with their families. They understood that I didn’t seem particularly attached to the estate, as if I was yearning for something else instead.

As the conversation shifted, I answered the questions posed to me, similar to how I had responded to Yidan. Everyone nodded in understanding; it seemed I and Yidan were the only ones without the must-have luxury toys like yachts.

However, I expressed a desire for other things—specifically, helicopters and snowmobiles, which piqued their interest.

Everyone around me assumed I had been under strict control for too long, and now that I could finally make decisions for myself, I was eager to fulfill my wishes.

While searching for the estate’s asset appraisal, I hadn’t tried to hide it from anyone. Some had even caught glimpses of my other asset reports, though the images were too small to discern any details.

Seeing that I wasn’t bragging or concealing my financial situation, those curious about my family’s wealth began to inquire.

“Ivy, do you have other industries you don’t particularly like? Would you consider letting them go?”

I smiled and nodded; there were indeed many industries I didn’t fancy. “Some might seem valuable, but I don’t understand their operations. I just get a share of the profits. If I could trade them for something I like, that would be even better!”

Everyone quickly realized what I was aiming for—cruisers, yachts, helicopters, and the like. While their value was comparable, their practical significance differed greatly.

Cruisers, yachts, and helicopters depreciate over time like cars, unlike the businesses I held, which generated profit every year.

Aware of this foolishness, those who understood didn’t warn me, while those who didn’t kept affirming my reasoning, figuring it was reasonable to swap out what I didn’t like for what I did, especially since money was no object.

Those with foresight began discussing it with their families, knowing their elders were more aware of the Smith family's industry layout. If they heard the young lady was about to squander her wealth, they’d be foolish not to take advantage of the opportunity.

However, as elders, they had larger goals in mind. It would be more fitting for the children to handle such matters, avoiding any suspicion from others while explaining that adults shouldn’t interfere in kids’ affairs.

Deep down, they were concerned that my grandfather’s connections and protection over me were something they couldn’t fully understand or confront.

With subtle hints from their elders, the second-generation heirs flocked around me. Yidan looked a bit bewildered, but as she watched me animatedly discuss my “unloved yet profitable” industries, a sense of surrealness washed over her.

Hearing about my desired items stirred their suppressed desires as well, prompting them to chime in about their own “unwanted” industries, their delight impossible to mask.

I kept an eye on everyone’s reactions, and when they heard me say those things were too cumbersome and complicated, I planned to leave it to the professionals to manage. I was merely venting to my close friends.

The second-generation heirs seemed to see a duck fly away just out of reach. They hastily urged me not to act impulsively, assuring me they could offer more advice.

I nodded, like a good child who listens to advice about eating well. Then, guided by their suggestions, I encouraged them to propose ways to trade existing assets, which aligned with my goal.

I swiftly created a separate group for those interested, renaming it the “Swap Circle.”

I followed up with a message: “Welcome to the Swap Circle!”

Everyone else was just left speechless. 

There was something about it that felt like it would easily be censored.
