**The Struggle Between Two Forces**

Lori Bennett stepped back, her heart pounding as she absorbed the seriousness in Jason Hart's voice. The chill in his tone made her shiver, rubbing her arms to ward off the cold creeping over her skin.

“What’s going on over there?” she asked, her curiosity piqued.

After encountering various mutated plants and animals, Lori couldn’t imagine what could still surprise her.

“Nothing good, but The Whisper has discovered some new issues,” Jason replied, his calm demeanor doing little to ease Lori's growing concern. She wondered if this was connected to their ongoing struggle with the system.

“The Whisper wants to consult with Specter about something. Do you think now’s a good time?”

Nodding, Lori grabbed Jason's arm, and together they entered a peculiar realm. The Whisper flitted in and out, seemingly in a hurry. They sat on the grass, gazing up at Specter's large screen, waiting for Jason to explain.

“There were spider webs everywhere. Black widow spiders from the caves near the fortress have infested this place, leaving cocoons and eggs. We shouldn’t stay long; we need to find them and get out quickly.”

Jason's tone was steady, but Lori felt a chill run down her spine. This place was crawling with dangers.

“Why does The Whisper want to consult Specter?” Lori wondered aloud.

“The Whisper detected abnormal energy fluctuations here and suspects there might be organisms similar to it,” Jason explained.

“The system is an organism?” Lori asked, surprised.

“Yes, The Whisper also has a physical form on its world.”

“Then it must be similar to Fred's system. Our previous analysis wasn’t wrong, was it?” Lori pondered aloud, confused by The Whisper's agitation.

“It doesn’t believe it and insists on finding out for itself,” Jason said.

“So, is this matter confirmed then?” Lori asked.

“Yeah, Fred's system might be more powerful; otherwise, it wouldn’t be so anxious.”

A sudden voice chimed in, “Hey, I can hear everything! Who said that old thing is stronger than me? If it was really more powerful, I wouldn’t have detected it. It’s clearly a low-level system.”

“What’s going on? Have you reached any conclusions?” Lori looked up at the screen displaying The Whisper's words, eager to know what Specter could do.

“No conclusions yet. Specter doesn’t recognize it; this complicates things. I should report to the main brain, but…”

“Hold off on that; there are too many unanswered questions,” Specter suddenly advised, the subtitles changing to English. Lori felt uneasy but couldn’t pinpoint why.

“Well… okay, I’ll listen to Specter. What do we do next?”

“Wait until we find its location; I’ll have a plan.”

“Alright, let’s find it quickly.”

Lori and Jason watched the screen, seeing the two mysterious beings converse. With a sigh, they exited the realm.

Lori suspected the blockage of her mental energy and senses was Fred’s system's doing. If so, it was indeed stronger than The Whisper.

The Whisper urged Jason to find Fred quickly. Wanting to eliminate the spiders, Jason hesitated, glancing at Lori.

“The Whisper wants us to find Fred, so let’s ignore the eggs for now.”

“Are we risking being surrounded by hatching spiders?” Lori asked.

“Quick action is key. I checked; there are no signs of hatching yet. We have some time. Let’s go find them.”

“Alright, let’s call Andy,” Lori suggested.

They hurried back to the office where their team, weary but alert, awaited. Lori handed out bottles of spring water, hoping to boost their energy.

After briefing the team, they set off. The zombies they had led to the upper floors had cleared enough of the way to make their ascent swift.

The Whisper was pushing them on; it couldn’t wait to confront the rival system.

As they moved, Jason relayed The Whisper’s actions to Lori, showing it could indeed disrupt their opponent. With her senses restored, Lori felt the oppressive presence of countless creatures, sending shivers down her spine.

This was beyond anything she’d experienced. Suppressing her fear, she closed her eyes, focusing on locating her friends’ crystal cores amidst the chaos.

She needed to act quickly. After locating them, she planned to destroy the building, eradicating the threat.

Watching her determination, the others followed her lead, dealing with threats as they arose.

With her mental energy back, Lori found she could control some small, non-intelligent mutated plants, putting them into a dormant state, but it drained her. She needed to conserve energy for the search.

As they climbed, they took care with their weapons; the air gun was powerful, and they risked damaging the building before rescuing anyone.

Andy and the team, initially reckless, realized the danger after Jason’s warning. They couldn’t afford mistakes; a collapse could be catastrophic.

Endless waves of zombies, sporadic mental energy disruptions, and constant threats from mutated creatures kept them on edge. The smaller insects and reptiles were especially unnerving.

Hearing Lori complain, Zoe, her best friend, said, “What do you mean they’re small? Did you see that spider? It was as big as a basketball!”

Lori had to admit, compared to their original sizes, these creatures were enormous.

“Alright, alright, my bad!” she conceded.

As a girl afraid of insects, Zoe’s reaction was understandable. Lori felt her own mental resilience was decent; others might have lost their minds by now.
