**Breaking Up**

After exchanging glances with Ethan, the unspoken understanding between him and Mike was clear. Anna, along with the team members and Mr. Johnson, quickly stepped in to mediate the escalating argument. Sarah, witnessing the sudden outburst, fiercely defended Ethan, countering anyone who dared to challenge him, which left Mr. Johnson feeling overwhelmed.

Meanwhile, Chloe seemed to be reveling in the chaos, her sharp and cutting remarks contrasting starkly with her calm demeanor. It was as if the argument had triggered a split in her personality.

Everyone was left bewildered; the situation had spiraled out of control. Those who should have persuaded others to calm down rushed to intervene.

Outside the door, the noise escalated from muffled voices to a full-blown shouting match, with the sounds of physical scuffles breaking out. Just as someone leaned in to catch the details, Ethan burst through the door, his voice booming as he chastised everyone.

“The awakening plan for our abilities should strictly filter volunteers in private. They must be physically capable and loyal to the community. Announcing it without any prerequisites is foolish and shows blatant disregard for us, the awakened. We are chosen for a reason, and such actions are an insult to us natural abilities!”

With that, he slammed the door shut with great force. Moments later, Sarah pushed the door open, shouting, “I’m incredibly disappointed in all of you!”

Following closely behind were the team members, their expressions dark as they trailed Ethan and Sarah. The door slammed again, leaving Mr. Johnson and Anna in a state of panic as they chased after them, calling out, “Ethan, don’t be angry! It’s not that serious! There’s been a misunderstanding. Sarah, stop fanning the flames! Get Ethan to come back!”

It was then that they saw Mike’s face dark as thunder as he opened the meeting room door. Chloe emerged from her office, her arms crossed and an expression of indifference plastered on her face. It was clear that the conflict had escalated significantly, with no one directly stating the intention to oust Ethan and his team from the community. Whispers began to spread through the community during the night, suggesting Chloe was going to break up with Ethan, leading to speculation about a love triangle and infidelity, even hinting they should leave by tomorrow.

“Let them go! Just don’t regret it later!”

As if to confirm the rumors circulating within the community, the next morning, in the community square, Chloe and Ethan’s group erupted into another argument, this time escalating to the core issue that no one wanted to confront—the inherent hierarchy between awakened individuals and ordinary people.

In the post-apocalyptic world, most awakened individuals carried a sense of superiority. While the community had appeared peaceful, this sense of superiority had never been openly expressed. After all, they were the ones risking their lives to fend off zombies and protect the community, while also gathering resources and crystal nuclei on missions.

If everyone became awakened, some might feel their advantages dissolved, especially if the efficacy of the awakening potion was deemed better than natural awakening. How could those who were ordinary feel balanced in such a scenario?

It was akin to the difference in beauty between someone who was naturally beautiful and someone who had undergone cosmetic enhancements. The naturally beautiful often harbored a sense of superiority, resentful of those who had artificially enhanced their looks.

In any group, conflicts arise. Even in a community that espoused equality and fairness, every individual harbored their own thoughts, scheming for their trivial interests.

Chloe observed this undercurrent of desire for awakening. She didn’t oppose self-interest; rather, she found it reasonable. In this world, anyone who didn’t think of themselves was a fool.

She scrutinized those who were desperate to awaken their abilities, keen to identify the potential traitors among them. To her surprise, the first person to vehemently attack Ethan with words was John, the unfortunate father whose son had been killed by a traitor from the Smith family. Chloe understood his yearning for power and revenge—it mirrored her own feelings from the past.

Convinced that John wouldn’t become a spy for the other side, she noted that he had seized the interrogation scroll that day, uncovering the entire conspiracy and realizing that the enemy was behind it all. His hatred was so fierce that it would be impossible for him to collaborate.

She crossed John’s name off the suspect list and added it to the awakening plan, thinking, “John, don’t let me down.”

The expressions of others were more varied. Chloe had already coordinated with Mr. Johnson and Lisa. After collecting the registration list, she kept a close watch on those who were overly eager and stirring up trouble behind the scenes.

She prepared everyone for a day of unrest, knowing that the community wouldn’t calm down until the first batch of injection lists was announced.

Ethan’s team made a grand exit from the community, and unexpectedly, Sarah also declared her departure, insisting on following Ethan, even abandoning her family. The group made a dramatic departure, leaving Mr. Johnson unable to stop them.

Chloe, feeling her acting skills were lacking, wore a sorrowful expression, turning away to wipe away what seemed like tears, eliciting sympathy from the onlookers. Then, as if regaining her composure, she rallied all awakened individuals, reorganized the patrols, and filled the positions previously held by Ethan and his team.

Mike and Anna remained dejected, clearly affected by the upheaval. On the contrary, the other awakened individuals hid their glee, thinking, “Good riddance! The dissenters are gone, and soon we will have our abilities.” They all assumed that Ethan had chosen Sarah over Chloe, and now they could seize Ethan’s former position, ensuring they would be favored by Chloe in the future, thus acquiring more crystal nuclei and resources.

Chloe noted these subtle movements, keeping them in mind. She had always been a generous leader, never rejecting ambitious and eager team members, provided they were loyal and obedient.

After dismissing the crowd gathered in the square, Mike and Anna accompanied Chloe back to her office. Both were still dazed from the series of events, their expressions a mix of confusion and disbelief, as they struggled to comprehend the unfolding situation.

Chloe pulled out three bottles of soda from her stash, adding ice before handing them to the two. Once her spiritual perception confirmed no one was outside, she relaxed and spoke, “What are you so tense about? It’s all just a show. There are traitors in the community, and we need to stir things up to flush them out.”

Anna finally let out a large sigh of relief, saying with a carefree attitude, “I thought you and Ethan were having relationship problems and creating such a ruckus!”

Before he could finish, Mike slapped the back of his head, “Can’t you think before you speak? If you don’t have anything useful to say, just keep quiet. You’re always the one running your mouth.”

Chloe laughed at this, “What relationship problems? There’s nothing of the sort.”

“Then was Miss Sarah just putting on an act? I doubt that,” Anna boldly chimed in, completely ignoring Mike’s warning glare.

Chloe took a sip of her cold soda, savoring it before burping comfortably. In truth, Ethan had visited her the night before, but they hadn’t discussed anything outside the plan. Before leaving, he had given her something that caught her completely off guard.

Seeing their surprised expressions, she could sense their curiosity rising as they pressed her, “Isn’t it a love triangle?”

“It’s more like Ethan is playing both sides,” she replied.

“Maybe a love triangle is more fitting—Ethan likes our Miss, and Miss Sarah likes Ethan,” Anna suggested.

“That shouldn’t be the case. They were hugging each other yesterday. I heard Miss Sarah confessed her feelings to Ethan!”

“I didn’t hear about this. You must be making it up, or perhaps the girl has a hidden crush? It’s too well concealed,” Mike interjected.

Chloe smirked internally at their gossiping. A hidden crush? That was completely contrary to Sarah’s personality. Before the apocalypse, Sarah would have boldly declared her feelings for anyone she liked, catching everyone off guard with her straightforwardness. But now, post-apocalypse, she was supposedly harboring a secret crush? That was highly unusual.

Having known Sarah for so many years, it was impossible not to notice this inconsistency. A mischievous thought crossed her mind, and she slowly remarked, “You guys should stop speculating. It’s just that they’re both pursuing each other, and it has nothing to do with me. I have no intention of getting involved in their romantic affairs. Besides, aren’t there more pressing matters at hand?”

Mike and Anna immediately fell silent, sipping their sodas, while internally they thought, “Right, like one day you won’t be the one softening up.”
