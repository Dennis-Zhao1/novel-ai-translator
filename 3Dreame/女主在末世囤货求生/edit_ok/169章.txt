**Confusion**

Meng had mentioned before that they'd arrived at this backup base, yet now with the group missing, it felt absurd. Even if a horde of zombies had appeared, the ability users should have been safe.

Lo Bingting decided to search the perimeter of the bar for clues, determined to find them despite the darkness of night. Anxiety and frustration bubbled within her; these were important people she had promised to protect, and now they were just... gone.

“Let’s not panic,” Ethan suggested to the group, his voice steady. “I just remembered another place we should check. Come on, let’s go take a look.”

Lo Bingting retrieved a modified SUV from her storage space, and everyone piled in, with Ethan taking the wheel. As they sped down the road, cutting through zombies, he explained, “Before the chaos, Meng and I had scoped out several backup locations. The bar is one of them, but I think Meng might be at another spot.”

Lo Bingting raised an eyebrow. “Why multiple bases? Isn’t one secure enough?”

Ethan shrugged, a small smile playing on his lips. “Meng likes to be prepared.”

Lo Bingting nodded. “So, how many backups did you pick?”

“Three or four,” he replied. “The bar was the best overall—spacious, secure, and well-equipped.”

“Let’s head to the closest one first,” she suggested.

“Sure, we’ll check them one by one. I refuse to believe people can just disappear into thin air,” he replied confidently.

They drove through the night, taking down zombies along the way, until they reached a gated community that resembled an upscale neighborhood. The large houses stood with sprawling yards, but the plants had grown wild and unruly.

Lo Bingting didn’t appreciate the plants. Every time she saw them, she was reminded of the mutant flowers and other monstrosities they had encountered.

The group faced the zombies head-on, especially Lo Bingting, whose frustration fueled her strength.

Zoe gently patted her back, trying to calm her down, while Lo Bingting squeezed her hand in thanks.

Meanwhile, Alex was on high alert. Sensing something off, he quickly used his wind abilities to signal Lo Bingting. Just as he returned to her side, he felt a tightness around his ankle and was yanked backward. He swiftly unleashed several wind blades, severing the creeping vine-like tendrils.

Lo Bingting was at her wit's end. After a day of searching and battling mutant plants, she was ready for it all to end.

Her attacks became increasingly fierce, and she had mastered the combination of a boomerang and an air gun. Both were instant-fire, allowing her to inflict damage on mutant plants both when thrown and when returning. The power of the air gun was impressive, making Alex and Lucas envious, while Zoe buzzed with questions.

Lo Bingting mentioned that the weapons were rare but not impossible to obtain—it just required time and opportunity. The others could only watch with longing.

Alex winked at Lucas, implying they were using the same weapons, like a couple. Unfortunately, his flirtation was lost on Lucas, who was completely focused. However, Zoe quickly caught on and began whispering excitedly with Alex, gossiping about it.

Surprisingly, even with the dense cluster of giant flowers nearby, Lo Bingting remained unfazed. Meanwhile, the previously cheerful duo went pale at the sight of the hideous flowers illuminated by the flames.

Suddenly, a realization struck her; maybe this was a trap. The perpetrator might have intended to use these mutant plants to ensnare her, not realizing it presented a perfect opportunity to rack up points.

If it weren’t for the others around, Lo Bingting would have shouted, “Thanks for the seeds, my friend!”

Her points were likely in the millions at this point.

Seeing that the others couldn’t help much, Lo Bingting sent out a bucket and a small net, instructing them to collect seeds. The obedient group began to follow her and Ethan, diligently picking up seeds.

When they finally finished over an hour later, Zoe complained about her aching back, lamenting her age and bone density, suggesting she might need to boost her calcium intake.

Lo Bingting’s concerns only deepened. What was the person behind all this planning?

After cleaning up the mess and setting fire to the remaining damaged seeds and flower heads, Lo Bingting suddenly remembered that these plants also had crystal cores. She wondered how they could burn everything without finding anything valuable. She asked Ethan, who replied:

“The crystal cores in these ugly things start depleting when they shoot out seeds. Once they’re done, the energy is completely used up, all distributed into the seeds.”

Ethan’s explanation made sense. No wonder the perpetrator wanted the seeds; they were packed with energy.

They quickly moved to another location, and as Lo Bingting pondered their situation, she thought about what benefit it brought the other party to lead her around like a fool.

The neighboring city was huge, and the backup base was still quite a distance away. By the time they got close, dawn was breaking. Fortunately, this time, they didn’t come away empty-handed.

The group spotted a nearly extinguished bonfire, scattered luggage, and leftover food, knowing something must have gone wrong.

There were no clear signs of a struggle, but the footprint patterns and the state of the belongings made it obvious that outsiders had intruded and forcibly removed their companions.

Ethan had some tracking skills, having previously followed footprints to a cave. This time, he used the clues left behind to find their direction.

Driving along the lead, he was concerned they might miss something, so Zoe took the wheel while Lo Bingting dealt with the nearby zombies, and Alex protected Ethan as he focused intently on observing the trail.

They drove and fought their way through the zombies, their speed surpassing that of a bicycle. By the time the sun fully rose, they finally arrived at a building.

When they looked up, they were shocked to find it was the Biotech Tower, known before the apocalypse as the headquarters of a renowned biotechnology company.

Lo Bingting felt a sinking sensation in her stomach; there was no doubt that the mastermind, Blake, was involved. He had always wanted the researchers from the lab and had gone through all this trouble to get them.

“Good news and bad news. Which do you want to hear first?” Ethan asked, breaking the tension with a wry smile.
