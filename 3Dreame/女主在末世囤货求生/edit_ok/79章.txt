Inside, Ivy cursed silently, Why did I have to choose this place? People were pacing back and forth outside, making her feel trapped.

She quickly put away her protective gear and pulled out a sleek, modern knife. This was a new model designed by the Smith family, made from high-tech materials, sharp and convenient.

In this situation, she couldn’t afford to make a sound, much less fire a gun. Ivy tensed her entire body, waiting for the intruder to enter.

As soon as the shadow leaped inside, he seemed to sense something was off. Ivy was swift, and within moments, the two engaged in a fierce exchange of blows.

The familiar moves made them both pause. The shadow removed his black mask, and Ivy gasped in surprise and delight.

Quickly, she pulled down her own mask, and his smile widened.

Outside the door, a search was already being organized, likely with the approval of Mr. Johnson. Ivy pointed upstairs, and Ethan nodded in understanding.

Feigning to pull her backpack from the corner, she retrieved her protective gloves. After putting them on, she began to climb up the window.

Her upper body strength was decent, but climbing up from below was a bit more challenging. Ethan went first, reaching the second-floor window and turning back to pull Ivy up. The two pressed tightly against the outer wall in the night, balancing on the narrow window ledge.

Before long, the search team found the room they had just hidden in. They turned on the lights and inspected the area before moving on, causing Ivy to breathe a sigh of relief.

The search was quick and thorough; they flipped over anything that could potentially hide someone, even pulling back curtains. Ivy could hear them rummaging through the room and the leader’s precise orders.

Fortunately, they were still plastered against the second-floor wall, as there were also searchers combing the first floor. If anyone looked up, they would surely spot them.

Heart racing, they managed to evade one wave after another of searches until the row house fell silent.

The two returned to the recently searched small room to hide, both eager to ask the other questions.

Ivy pulled out her phone and began typing in the notes app. Seeing her actions, Ethan couldn’t help but smile. “How did you end up here?”

She passed the phone to him, and through the screen’s glow, he could see his reflection, which left Ivy feeling a bit puzzled. Is this guy for real?

Ethan took the phone back and typed, “There’s been a lot of movement at the Mountain View base. Someone asked me to come check it out.”

Understanding dawned on Ivy; Ethan came from the Mountain View base, where he had seemingly been under Mr. Green’s wing. It seemed the political struggles there were fierce.

He continued typing, “What about you? What are you doing here?”

Ivy responded, “Do you think I’d get caught by a bunch of small-time thugs and brought here? You believe that?”

Ethan couldn’t contain his laughter, his smile stretching wide as he tried to suppress it, causing his chest to shake.

Ivy looked at him in disbelief, her mind racing with four words: “What an idiot.”

Quickly, she typed again, “Someone is deliberately causing chaos here. I took the opportunity to slip out. We need to leave.”

Ethan pointed toward the outer wall, and Ivy nodded.

“But I still have some things to confirm.”

Ethan hesitated; he certainly wasn’t comfortable with her wandering out alone at night. “What do you need to confirm? Maybe I can help.”

Ivy typed and handed him the phone again. “I need to confirm if Mr. Carter is here and who attended tonight’s gathering. I need to get the guest list.”

Ethan received the phone back. “Mr. Carter is here. Someone is trying to take him out. Getting the guest list will be harder now that the whole base is on lockdown. If we don’t leave soon, we might not be able to.”

Hearing the word “take out,” he looked at Ivy in shock. She nodded seriously, then pointed at the wall.

Ethan could only nod in resignation. Taking advantage of the cover of night and the recent search, they quickly climbed over the wall and escaped the Pinewood villa base.

It was unbelievable—just ten minutes ago, they were hiding, terrified of being discovered, and now they were sitting in Ethan’s modified car, distancing themselves from the brightly lit Pinewood villa.

The ride was quiet; Ethan’s route encountered a few stray zombies, which he dispatched with ease.

Ivy reflected on how hectic the day had been, filled with non-stop action. As her adrenaline faded, hunger and fatigue began to creep in.

She rummaged through her backpack for a small loaf of bread and some milk, eating quietly. A bite of bread followed by a sip of milk; it was so cold outside that the milk, stored at room temperature, felt chilly when she drank it.

Suddenly, Ethan spoke up, “Were you the one trying to take out Mr. Carter?”

“Cough, cough, cough...” 

Ivy was caught off guard by the sudden question and choked, coughing violently.

Ethan casually handed her a couple of tissues, noticing the tears at the corners of her eyes from coughing.

“Those explosions were your doing too, huh? Impressive, Miss Ivy.” 

Ivy looked at him in surprise, not understanding his intention. Isn’t it wiser to keep things unspoken?

She maintained her composure, holding the unfinished milk in one hand while her other slipped into her backpack, her gun already gripped tightly.

“Don’t be nervous. I don’t know what kind of deep hatred you have with Mr. Carter, but I have to say—well done.” 

Ethan observed her vigilant yet composed demeanor, his voice carrying a hint of unintentional amusement and mockery.

Ivy remained silent, her guard still firmly in place despite his words.

It wasn’t until the rearview mirror no longer captured any trace of the Pinewood villa base that Ethan slowed the car down. 

“I’m being sincere. I came here to deal with him too. I’ve been tracking him for a while now, managed to catch him a few times, but he always slipped away. He’s problematic.” 

Ethan’s voice was earnest, but he wore a puzzled expression with his last statement.

“Why do you have a grudge against Mr. Carter?” Ivy countered.

“Mr. Carter has always framed me, tried to take me out without reason. I had to strike first.” 

Ethan frowned, puzzled by this point. He couldn’t find the motive or reason behind her actions.

Ivy felt a flicker of realization; it seemed Ethan and Mr. Carter were in a deadly feud. 

From her understanding of Mr. Carter, he never made enemies lightly. If he personally targeted someone, it meant they posed a significant threat or impediment to him.

But the word “first” sparked something in her mind, something just out of reach.

Looking at Ethan’s earnest face, her guard lowered a notch. 

“You mean our goals align?” 

Ethan nodded seriously as he drove. 

“If you manage to deal with Mr. Carter today, it would mean you avenged my grudge. I owe you one.” 

“He’s as good as gone. I’ll take him out with one shot today.” 

Ivy replied confidently, her pride and assurance evident in her tone.

Seeing her expression, Ethan refrained from dousing her enthusiasm with cold water, merely nodding in acknowledgment. 

Yet, doubt lingered in his mind; he had once been very confident too. 

The outcome would be revealed in a few days. 

They drove the car into a forest free of zombies, turning off the engine and lights, waiting for dawn.

Driving on low beams through the night was already perilous. They could crash into a few wandering zombies, but if a horde appeared, it would be easy to flip the car and be surrounded.

Ethan assured Ivy to rest easy while he kept watch. Thinking that she would drive tomorrow, she reclined her seat and fell asleep.

They returned to the stronghold without incident. Everyone saw Ivy and Ethan return together without raising an eyebrow.

Feeling as if she had shed the heaviest burden of her life, Ivy’s eyes sparkled with ease and contentment. The Smith family noticed the change in her demeanor.

It was as if she had reverted to her relaxed self before the apocalypse, lounging in the old residence. They speculated it might be too cold, causing the young lady to hibernate.

Only Ethan understood that the cold wasn’t the real reason.

He showed no signs of relaxation, occasionally going out. A week later, the news he brought back left Ivy in shock for a long time. 

“What? Mr. Carter isn’t gone? Impossible!”
