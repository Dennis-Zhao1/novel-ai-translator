**Global Travel Stockpiling II**

Chris’s knack for efficiency was something Lottie admired. Given their tight schedule, they needed to streamline their travels across various countries. Their mission was straightforward: procurement. Chris avoided unnecessary detours, preferring to use technology—emails and calls—for large orders rather than globe-trotting.

Lottie, however, saw their worldwide trek as a chance to mix business with pleasure, rationalizing her international inexperience by combining her tasks with sightseeing.

Time was of the essence. Even with rapid international logistics, nothing was guaranteed. Sending decoy packages to divert attention or focus was risky, especially with the looming chaos of the apocalypse.

Lottie didn’t mind the whimsical scenarios she imagined about their travels. Standing side by side with Chris and their companion on a cargo ship, they snapped carefree photos while waiting for a delivery from the ice wine factory, feeling the sea breeze against their faces.

The viral news about the jade stone gambling scene in Myanmar had highlighted Lottie's luck, reassuring stakeholders about her absence. After all, as the major shareholder, her family's business was secure.

Lottie had made it clear she needed a break from the uncomfortable tactics of various families, using her travels to stay out of the spotlight, allowing the families to maneuver without her in the picture.

After taking a picture, Lottie sent it to Grandpa Smith, cleverly hiding her stockpiling activities by maintaining a guise of leisure.

Her friend, Emma Smith, stuck at home, couldn’t help but send voice messages filled with envy and teasing, accusing Lottie of being heartless for having all the fun. It wasn't until Lottie promised to bring back local specialties that Emma finally calmed down. They laughed and chatted until Chris’s arranged vehicle arrived.

Lottie wasn’t keen on stockpiling too much ice wine. She had already collected a variety back home, just not ice wine. She preferred to grab whatever was ready, not wanting to waste time waiting for the factory to prepare her order.

In less than half an hour, the truck from the ice wine factory arrived at the port, coincidentally with a batch of export orders. Lottie’s order was conveniently added. After a quick inspection and payment, she repeated the process.

Once in the vehicle Chris had arranged, Lottie marked her procurement list with satisfaction. Chris, puzzled by the shopping desires of women, found himself unexpectedly influenced by her enthusiasm, deciding to stock up on essentials too.

Their next stop was Australia, known for its grain-fed steaks. Lottie’s mouth watered at the thought of marbled texture and the rich aroma of seared steaks. She was determined to turn her stockpiling trip into a culinary adventure.

Private jets, less affected by air traffic control, ensured they could take off without delays. The weather was exceptionally clear, the calm before the impending chaos feeling almost surreal.

On the plane, Lottie flipped through a guide to Australian specialties, noting items to acquire aside from steak—wine, kangaroo meat, and king crabs, all of which she planned to savor.

Their next destination was the Land of Romance, famous for its wines, wheat, and chocolate. Chocolate had been a rare commodity in her past life, making her eager to stock up.

Chris, observing Lottie scribbling in her notebook, felt remarkably relaxed, showing patience and resourcefulness in supporting her shopping spree.

A few hours of flight brought them to their next stop as night fell. After checking in, Lottie couldn’t resist slipping into her secret space to admire her haul.

She had tons of seafood waiting—fresh and abundant, with boxes of caviar stockpiled. Yet, compared to her grains, it felt lacking. She needed better planning.

Riding her excitement, Lottie compiled an inventory of her accumulated goods. Despite her seemingly vast collection, she felt underwhelmed, having only filled a sixth of her expansive secret space.

In reality, she had enough materials for movable houses and furniture, far exceeding her initial list. With enough stock to open large supermarkets, she reminded herself not to compare.

With plenty of funds still available, she vowed not to return home until her space was full—though she dared not dream of completely filling it.

The following morning, Lottie accompanied Chris to the largest steak export factory in Australia. Chris had communicated the required quantities, and now they were inspecting and shipping the goods, ensuring freshness using the latest preservation technology.

Lottie provided the address for the doomsday bunker, listing her uncle from the Smith family as the contact. It was normal to go abroad for shopping; it would be odd not to bring anything back.

Next, they headed to Australia’s largest grain processing company. Feeling she hadn’t stockpiled enough food, Lottie insisted on acquiring more flour and supplies, ideally some wheat for both consumption and cultivation.

Following their routine—inspect, pay, load—Lottie felt a weight lifted from her shoulders.

Afterward, the group enjoyed a hearty meal at a famous steakhouse. Lottie realized she had purchased too little steak. If she shared with the Smith family, she might have just enough.

Consoling herself, she reminded herself that beef from the Land of Romance was equally renowned. She could always stock up more there.

Kangaroo meat skewers paired with Australia’s famous wine made for a delightful meal, leaving Lottie pleased. She rubbed her chin, noting her face felt rounder from all the eating. She’d check for a double chin later.

Watching her eat, Chris found it amusing. Their friend, Jack, continued to devour his meal, ordering another steak and two servings of pasta. Lottie persuaded him to swap the pasta for another steak.

“Come on, after traveling so far, you’re not going to eat beef? Are you trying to save me money? Is that how little you think of me?” she joked.

That afternoon, they visited the largest and most famous winery. After sampling a few varieties, Lottie selected two renowned ones and ordered two hundred barrels each.

With no time to wait for bottling and labeling, she bought the barrels outright. Even Chris and the winery owner were surprised at her boldness. Lottie brushed it off, saying it would avoid any doubts.

She also picked up empty bottles and labels, planning to bottle them herself at home. The oak barrels were ideal for transport, and the winery owner was accommodating, even throwing in extra bottles.

These orders also needed shipping, so she followed the delivery to the port. After a series of quick operations, Lottie felt that if everything required port delivery, they might as well make a single trip.

Chris hadn’t anticipated her buying so much. He couldn’t fathom spending all your savings in one go. Surely, she wasn’t planning to return to run a business? It wasn’t as if she was preparing for the apocalypse, right?

Returning to their hotel from the port, it was already dinner time. They feasted on seafood—lobsters, king crabs, and white oysters. It was said red meat pairs with red wine, and white meat with white wine, so Lottie brought the white wine gifted by the winery owner, her eyes sparkling as she savored the meal.
