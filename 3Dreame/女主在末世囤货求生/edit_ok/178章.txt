**Confusing the Enemy**

“C’mon, let’s get close enough to him, and I’ll find a way to neutralize his abilities!” 

The persistent voice of the system echoed in Ethan’s ears as he focused intensely, clearing away the mutated plants blocking his path and fending off the mutated insects attacking from behind.

Across the field, Ivy wasn’t having much better luck. She had planned to outmaneuver Ethan, but now found herself surrounded instead.

Seeing both of them trapped, Ben couldn’t help but grin smugly. For the moment, he was free from any immediate danger. The system's voice flashed through his mind. “Host, Ethan is emitting strange energy signals. If you can control him and absorb his energy, you could have everything you’ve ever wanted!”

The tone was as tempting as ever, yet laced with a hint of respect that had been missing. For a while now, the system had kept Ben on a tight leash, leaving him with little say in his own actions. He had to admit, though grudgingly, that the system's choices usually turned out to be the right ones.

Yet, Ben had longed for power for too long to remain a mere puppet. But now, things felt different.

“System, we need to work together to achieve real success. We have to be a team!”

The system didn’t respond immediately. It had realized that Ethan’s luck and abilities were far superior to Ben’s. Initially, it couldn’t bind Ethan as a host over Ben because it hadn’t absorbed enough of the world’s energy.

Even now, with enough energy, binding Ethan wasn’t possible. Initially, it thought it was still entangled in some kind of binding process, but now it suspected Ethan might be bonded with another system.

Still, the energy emanating from Ethan was incredibly alluring. It was like a starving person catching the scent of a delicious meal, unable to resist the urge to devour it.

“Don’t worry, host. Our goals have always been aligned.”

The system’s voice and attitude gave Ben a sense of immense satisfaction. He shot a fierce look at Ivy, thinking he would deal with her first. The supplies were insignificant to him; he didn’t lack resources. What he needed was to vent his frustration.

Soon, the system received Ben's command and unleashed a torrent of mutated plants, attempting to corner Ivy while the mutated insects would swarm her.

Ivy unleashed a stream of fire, seemingly sensing Ben's intentions. She countered by moving towards Ethan, pushing back against the onslaught.

The system noticed the increase in energy from their side, realizing that they were using energy to amplify the attacks from the mutated plants and insects. It quickly formulated a plan.

“Host! They must have detected my presence and increased their energy output. I have a way to deal with them. You pretend to be overwhelmed, and I’ll shield our energy output. Let’s see if they try to capture you. If they do, that’ll be our chance!”

Ethan agreed; it was a clever strategy. If the mountain wouldn’t come to him, he would go to the mountain.

When the system finally activated the energy shield, both his and Ivy’s weapons vanished simultaneously.

Caught off guard, Ivy gasped but quickly regained her composure, unleashing her ice powers and psychic abilities. The ice decimated all the insects, while her psychic energy caused the mutated plants to explode.

The small crystal cores allowed her to control the energy with minimal output. If it were zombies or larger mutated insects, it would be a different story.

As she caught her breath, she noticed Ethan wielding his lightning powers.

What was happening? She stared, confused by the situation, noticing that Ethan seemed to be considering retreating.

He wanted to run?

“Host, quickly control him! His energy is weakening. Now's the time to seize the opportunity!”

Even though Ben disliked these commanding tones, the system's urgency was somewhat acceptable. He reacted immediately, moving towards Ethan.

“Ethan, watch out!”

Ivy felt her psychic energy was reaching its limit. If she didn’t recover soon, she would risk exhaustion. With all her might, she shouted this warning, but the next moment, she saw Ethan looking in her direction, shaking his head. Before she could hear what he wanted to say, he was suddenly wrapped up in the tendrils of the mutated plants, being pulled towards Ben.

In the next second, it looked as though Ethan had been poisoned; he was limp, eyes closed, head drooped. The sight made Ivy's heart ache with rage.

“Got him!”

Ben heard the system's excited voice, a tone he had never heard before.

He felt a surge of confidence, believing he was truly powerful. Even someone as revered as Ethan, with his strong abilities, was nothing more than a puppet in his hands. This showed that the rumors about Ethan’s prowess were exaggerations; true strength was what mattered.

“Host, quickly bring him to me! His energy is too overwhelming and too tempting!”

But at that moment, Ben suddenly stopped in his tracks. The tendrils tightly binding Ethan halted as well, and he stood frozen in place.

The system was momentarily taken aback, still inquiring, “Host, what’s wrong? What happened?”

Ben sneered inwardly. He finally realized the system’s tone was highly unreasonable. This urgency was reminiscent of the time it had urged him to summon zombies. What on earth did the system want with Ethan?

Was it because of the abilities he possessed? There was no denying that Ethan’s lightning abilities were formidable, but wasn’t the system supposed to assist him in controlling the universe? Why did it seem more eager than him?

It didn’t make sense. Ben thought that if the system couldn’t provide a reasonable explanation, he wouldn’t easily hand over Ethan.

In truth, after regaining control of these energies, he had no intention of relinquishing power to the system again, nor would he allow it any chances to suppress him.

The system, seemingly anticipating this thought, also chuckled coldly in its heart. It had seen through this host quite well. He was selfish and arrogant. While he was indeed smart and emotionally intelligent, his heart was too dark and vengeful. If he weren’t still of great use to it, he might have already devised various ways to deal with it.

“Host, what are you hesitating for? Don’t forget, only when my energy is fully charged and upgraded will you gain the true ability to control the world.”

The system calmly reminded Ben, unafraid that he would let Ethan escape. Even if he didn’t hand him over, it would kill the other party.

“What exactly do you want with Ethan?” 

Ben began to suspect that the system didn’t want to change hosts, but was rather eyeing Ethan for himself.

Indeed, Ethan was stronger than him in terms of abilities, age, and physical prowess, but when it came to intelligence, he was nowhere near Ben’s level.

Ben was confident in his intellect. If Ethan were truly formidable, how could he be dragged around like a limp dog?

“Host, there’s a powerful energy within Ethan’s body. Absorbing it will allow me to upgrade rapidly,” the system explained.

This part was true, but the core reason behind it was something it would never reveal to Ben.
