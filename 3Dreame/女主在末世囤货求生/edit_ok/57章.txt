**Elevator Horror**

In the dimly lit elevator shaft, Ivy clung to Ethan's arm, her expression a mix of frustration and determination. Despite her simmering anger, she knew she had to stay focused on their precarious situation.

"Let Aaron handle the heavy lifting," she thought, deciding to let the professionals take charge. Aaron, a skilled climber, nodded, understanding the importance of conserving their strength during the crisis.

Ethan's team was already making their way up the ladder, each member securely fastening ropes around their waists for safety. The drop from the elevator door to the bottom of the shaft was over thirty feet; a fall could mean serious injury or worse. The military personnel, trained for emergencies, coordinated seamlessly, using their tools with precision.

With swift movements, they managed to pry open the elevator door. As Lara and the others climbed up, they followed immediately. If there were any threats outside, it was safer for those with combat skills to scout ahead. The rest could remain sheltered in the shaft until it was clear.

Lara peeked out and noted the absence of a significant threat. Ethan and his team could handle anything that came their way. Soon, more team members joined them, eager and ready for action.

Next, more individuals climbed up, securing their safety ropes to the elevator door. They instructed others below to tie the ropes around their waists for additional security as they ascended, working together to pull Mr. and Mrs. Smith to safety.

After that, they began hauling up the stacks of crucial documents. The younger group, more daring than the others, climbed up without waiting for the rope. Those more cautious stayed in line below. The situation outside was looking promising; the feared zombie horde had not materialized. Perhaps the explosions from the previous day had less impact than anticipated.

As more people continued to ascend, Sam and Joe had just helped their sister up when a piercing scream echoed from the elevator shaft. Lara turned back and realized the car, which had been stuck on the first basement level, was now being pushed inward by the zombies. Most of the vehicle was wedged into the elevator shaft, leaving only the rear wheels stuck at the entrance.

They had to maneuver around the car to climb up the walls. If the vehicle fell, those below would either be crushed or attacked by the zombies jumping down. The screams weren't just from women; the terror was universal, leaving many paralyzed with fear.

Sam and Joe hurried to climb higher. Most of the lab researchers had made it up, leaving only Mark still below. Sam reached the elevator door on the first floor and turned to pull his brother up, but just as he extended his hand, the car lurched forward again.

The brothers scrambled onto the first-floor ground as their teammates helped drag them up. Once inside, they shouted down, “Mark, hurry up! No time to waste!”

Mark, still in shock, finally snapped to attention and began to climb. Their call also motivated a few hesitant survivors, who began to scramble up, inadvertently kicking Mark several times in their haste. Despite his good-natured disposition, he waited until they were all safe before continuing himself.

Sally, wearing a skirt, hesitated, worried about maintaining her dignity even in this dire situation. She decided to be the last one to go up, trusting the group would assist her. Ivy, however, climbed swiftly, no longer pretending once the men were no longer watching.

As Mark climbed to the first basement level, he felt a tug at his pants. Looking down, he saw a young woman with an innocent expression asking for help. Despite feeling a bit cowardly himself, Mark waited for her to climb closer before offering assistance.

“You go ahead; there are still two more girls below, and I can help them too,” he said.

Ivy was eager to ascend, fully aware of the car's impending fall, while the two girls below still hesitated. She thanked him softly, complimenting his chivalry and bravery, while internally criticizing the men ahead for their slowness. Every second inside was dangerous.

Mark managed to pull the second girl up as well. When it was Sally’s turn, she refused, urging him to climb faster. Confused, Mark didn't argue, turning back to ascend. Ivy had already been pulled up, but just as Mark reached the edge of the first basement, the car finally plummeted.

The crash was deafening, followed by screams. A horde of zombies surged into the elevator shaft through the broken doors, nearly grabbing Mark. At that moment, Lara reached the elevator entrance, witnessing the chaos.

She urged Mark and Sally to climb faster. Terrified, Mark felt his legs turn to jelly as he scrambled upward. Below, Sally screamed for help, her voice cutting through the panic.

When Mark glanced back, he saw zombies beginning to step over one another to reach Sally’s ankles. Realizing he had to clear the ladder quickly, he pushed himself harder and was finally pulled up by someone above.

But when he turned again, he saw Sally being grabbed by a zombie at her ankle. With a brutal yank, she was pulled down into the pile of undead. Blood erupted from her chest and neck as she let out a few horrified screams before falling silent.

Everyone watched in horror, the scene etched into their memories. Lara had seen people devoured by zombies in her previous life, but this brutality was still shocking. She adjusted quickly, but the others weren't as fortunate.

Many faced their first encounter with such raw, bloody horror. The fear was palpable, leaving them momentarily speechless, their thoughts consumed by the haunting image of Sally's demise. This would likely remain their greatest trauma and fear.

Lara glanced at Ivy, whose face had gone pale, contemplating whether to push her down in the chaos. Ivy had a history of hiding behind others, and right in front of her was Mark, who had only just climbed up. Remembering how Ivy had previously sacrificed someone to save herself, Lara knew she was capable of that.

But looking at Mark, who seemed to be an essential ally of Mr. Smith, she decided against it for now. For the sake of that naïve girl, she would let Ivy off this time; there would be opportunities in the future.

When Ethan returned, Sally had already been lost. He quickly organized the group to exit the building; the loud screams would surely attract more zombies. By this point, Lara had teamed up with Aaron, arranging for the Smith's young men to protect Mr. Smith and his researchers.

Ethan focused on leading the survivors, silently dispatching any zombies they encountered with precision.

The Smith family’s young men, witnessing such horror for the first time, felt their hatred for the zombies surge, fueling their every attack. They cleared a path until they reached the management office where Lucy had been the day before.

Lara instructed everyone to take a brief rest on the first floor before taking Anne upstairs to retrieve Lucy. Though she claimed not to care about anyone unimportant, she had promised Lucy she would come back for her before leaving.

Not long after, the three returned quietly downstairs. When Lucy saw the crowd outside, including what appeared to be a team of soldiers, she felt a wave of relief wash over her.
