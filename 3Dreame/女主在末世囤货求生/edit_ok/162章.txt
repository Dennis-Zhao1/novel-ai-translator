**Unknown Cave**

Lila Bennett walked cautiously, scanning the cave with her flashlight, but found nothing out of the ordinary.

The rest of the group followed her lead, and Jake Harrison used his flashlight to illuminate the narrow passage ahead.

"This cave is naturally occurring, not man-made. But everyone, watch your step; don't trip," Jake called back to the group.

Lila handed out flashlights to the others. They had brought along a good supply, but this time, they only needed one flashlight for every two or three people.

They had walked nearly two hundred yards into the cave, which twisted and turned, making it hard to pinpoint their exact location. The compass on Lila's watch spun erratically, likely due to magnetic interference.

Jake had noticed the disarray of footprints at the cave's entrance, which is why they ventured in. However, it was strange; just like when they encountered the bones earlier, the trail had suddenly stopped.

As they paused, Lila pulled Jake back a few steps. A dark object flashed by in the shadows and would have struck Jake squarely in the face if not for her quick reaction.

"What was that?" someone in the group exclaimed, and they all instinctively took a few steps back. After a brief moment of chaos, they calmed down when they saw that Lila and Jake were composed.

"It's a mutated plant. Everyone, be cautious," Lila announced, detecting numerous black-red dots glimmering in her mind's eye, suggesting this might be a nest for these troublesome things.

Jake's arm was firmly held by Lila, and he focused on her expression. She looked serious, indicating that things were about to get complicated.

"All fire-capable folks, come to the front," Lila instructed. Their team had plenty of fire and earth abilities but not much else.

Seven or eight people moved to the front, ready for action.

"Anna, you and Luke coordinate. Wendy, team up with me. Jake and the others, keep a lookout. Earth users, be on guard. Wood and water folks, you can rest for now."

Lila rummaged through her backpack and pulled out a makeshift Molotov cocktail, igniting it and tossing it toward the area with the most black-red dots. With a loud pop, the fuel splashed everywhere, and flames erupted across a large area.

The crackling sound of burning filled the cave, a noise that seemed particularly loud in the otherwise quiet space.

"So, these mutated plants react to fire," Lila noted, her curiosity piqued.

"Anna, make the fire bigger!" she commanded.

"Got it!" Anna replied, using her wind abilities to accelerate the flames, causing the fire to spread even further.

"Earth folks, try turning the soil about fifteen yards ahead!" Lila suddenly remembered earth abilities could be used this way. The earth users stepped forward, soon uprooting the mutated plants along with their roots.

"Strange, why aren’t they attacking us? What was that thing just now?" Wendy, who had poked her head out from behind Lila, asked.

"Just burn them first, and we’ll figure it out later," Lila replied. She scanned the area again with her mind, but the black-red dots remained unchanged, still densely packed together. She began to ponder whether there could be other mutated plants hiding.

The firelight illuminated that section of the cave, and Lila added more gasoline to intensify the flames. To avoid smoke inhalation, she instructed Anna to use her wind abilities to blow the smoke back.

After about twenty minutes, the flames finally subsided, and the crackling noises disappeared. Lila couldn’t afford to collect the crystal cores this time; finding her teammates was more important.

Anna led the way, and they moved through the cave with ease, almost like a walking wind machine.

After walking for another ten minutes, they reached a crevice that seemed to have formed from tectonic movement. It was over three feet wide, splitting the cave in half, and the other side was dark and increasingly narrow.

As everyone hesitated about crossing, Jake took a few steps back before sprinting forward and easily leaping across. Wendy looked down into the seemingly bottomless crevice, fear evident in her eyes. Lila decided not everyone needed to follow; she instructed Max to take Wendy and the others back to regroup at the camp.

With that, Wendy was sent back, and following Jake were six of his team members, along with Lila, Anna, Luke, and Peter, among others—about ten people in total.

As they moved forward, a faint metallic scent wafted through the air. Lila, sensitive as ever, immediately alerted everyone, "Stay alert and don’t get hurt."

Jake slowed his pace as well. He had been leading, but he sensed they were nearing something significant.

Suddenly, the flashlight beam focused on a wall, and after scanning the surroundings, it seemed they had reached a dead end.

"Why aren’t we moving? Is there no way forward?" Anna asked curiously from behind.

"Yes, there’s no way forward," Lila confirmed.

"Shh, everyone be quiet," she suddenly interrupted. The smell she detected was growing heavier, and the rustling sounds around them were becoming increasingly loud.

"They’re coming. Luke, be careful!" she warned.

Just then, she threw a Molotov cocktail, which struck its target. Luke raised his hand, and they watched as the bottle ignited on a creature, only to freeze mid-air in an unexpected turn of events.

Lila scrutinized the situation; it appeared to be a gigantic version of the mutated plant, and indeed, it had jumped towards them. Before she could fully assess where it had come from, she was yanked backwards into a warm embrace. The cave was suddenly illuminated by the unique silver-blue glow of lightning abilities.

Lila reacted quickly, sending out several ice spikes. Luke's face turned pale as he retreated to the back, while Anna quickly grabbed a handful of crystal cores from her backpack and shoved them towards him. Luke, fearing he might bump into Anna, dodged and insisted on stashing them in his own bag.

Anna was just about to make a joke about Luke's social anxiety when a sudden wave of mutated plants surrounded them.

"This really is the nest!" someone exclaimed.

"Stop talking and get to work!" Peter, with his mental abilities, found it challenging to deal with the mutated plants, while Chris exerted considerable effort.

Fire users unleashed various skills, while Lila continually doused the area with gasoline. Anna was focused on conjuring winds but had to ensure the fire did not reach her teammates, which was a bit tricky.

"Lila, it’s getting tough here. We need to find a more spacious area," someone shouted.

"Yeah, I feel like I’m about to stick to the wall," another added.

"Don’t stick to the wall!" Lila urgently warned, noticing that the wall was sprouting many mutated plants with long tendrils that could cause serious harm upon contact.

"That scared me! No way, burn it all!" 

Fire users positioned themselves in a circle around the area, and Lila distributed several barrels of gasoline and Molotov cocktails to get everyone moving quickly.

"Stop burning! We’re running out of oxygen!" Jake suddenly coughed a few times, and the group, previously focused on the fire, realized that the cave, which had once had airflow, now felt blocked, suffocating them.

"This is bad; at this rate, we’ll suffocate!" Lila quickly checked for abnormalities, and upon closer inspection, she saw a cluster of black-red glimmering dots above them, including a particularly dark one that blended in but was still noticeable amid the glowing black-red dots.

"Jake, Chris, there should be a vertical hole above us, but it's blocked by mutated plants. We need to clear them out first," Lila instructed.

After her command, she noticed Anna at the back of the group trying to break free.

The mutated plants feared fire, but that didn’t mean they were afraid of Anna.

"Anna, come back! The big boss is right here," she said lightly, but the grim reality of their situation was far from optimistic.
