**No Regrets in Being Hit**

Ivy had long given up on trying to get into the van and was seriously considering smashing the window open. Just as she raised her hand, Ethan stopped her. She guessed he might be reluctant to let her confront Lily, considering their earlier behavior hadn’t exactly been ordinary. As if he'd care.

Before she could make a move, she noticed Lily trembling as if she'd been shocked. She slid off her seat and collapsed to the floor. The others in the van, witnessing her sudden fall, hurriedly opened the door to let Ivy in.

Ivy was taken aback. Lily’s abilities were so finely tuned that she could control them with precision. It was more than just admiration; Ivy felt a pang of envy.

After calling the driver and another team member to help the incapacitated driver onto the last row of seats, Ethan finally approached the driver's seat to deal with Lily.

In a moment of desperation, Ethan had used a small portion of his powers, and after a brief moment of unconsciousness, Lily managed to pull herself up. The first thing she did was lunge for the control panel, desperately shielding the door-opening button.

Ivy couldn’t hold back her anger any longer. She'd seen teammates betray each other before, and she'd encountered those who were downright devious, but never anyone so foolish and malicious. The thought of Lily staying at the fortress for a few days to awaken her abilities made her stomach churn.

With a grim face, Ivy shot a look at Ethan, whose expression was even worse. It ignited her fury as she questioned him, “Ethan, get it straight! This woman has no morals or conscience—she lives off her looks! Is she really worth wasting resources on to awaken her abilities at the fortress?”

“Don’t you worry that she’ll cause even more trouble for others once she gains her powers? Open your eyes and see!”

Ethan paused, then replied calmly, “Sending her there was Matt’s decision, and the payment has already been made.”

Ivy was furious, spitting out, “What a scumbag! Neither of you are worth a dime!”

The people in the van were equally outraged. Some were still in the dark about what had happened, but now that they realized the unconscious driver’s condition was caused by Lily, those with tempers were rolling up their sleeves, ready to confront her. The principle of treating others with kindness had long been thrown out the window.

Lily, finally recovering her composure, began her pitiful act, weeping like a rain-soaked flower, claiming her fear. She repeatedly insisted she hadn’t meant to hurt anyone and expressed her shock that the driver was an ability user who could be so easily injured.

Her melodramatic display of innocence was enough to sway some of the people who were unaware of the truth, as they remembered her previous behavior at the base, where she had cultivated a somewhat sympathetic image. Ivy, rage boiling inside her, felt the urge to leap over Ethan and confront Lily.

“You scheming little actress! Let’s see how well you can perform when your hypocritical mask is ripped off!”

Seeing Ivy seething, Ethan hurriedly gestured for the vice-captain to step in. The vice-captain, equally helpless, couldn’t bear to see this chaos; it gave him a headache.

He swiftly carried Ivy back into the modified vehicle, leaving her sputtering, “You… you…!” without any further words.

Ethan left one teammate to drive while assigning a sturdy teammate to accompany them. He ignored Lily, even when she requested to board the modified vehicle, acting as if he hadn’t heard her at all.

With the situation escalating, allowing her onto the modified vehicle would mean Ivy could confront her.

They wrapped up the chaos and signaled to hit the road quickly; the longer they delayed, the later they would return to the fortress.

Once in the passenger seat, Ivy fumed from the back, “Honestly, you’re not actually falling for that scheming girl, are you?”

Ethan looked at her like she was insane, not bothering to respond as he gestured for the vice-captain to drive. Ignored, Ivy straightened up, glaring at him.

“What’s with the silence? Feeling guilty? Just wait until I tell Brittany on you!”

Ethan rubbed his temples, feeling exasperated. Both women were relentless, but he patiently explained, “We can’t get rid of her yet. Sending her to the fortress is meant to draw out whoever is behind her.”

Only then did Ivy begin to understand. So there was a deeper layer to this—she had thought these two men had lost their minds over a pretty face. Her focus shifted as she contemplated who this mysterious figure might be.

Finally, it quieted down. The vice-captain and Ethan exchanged glances, both sighing in resignation.

The journey continued, stopping several times to clear out the obstacles that had been attracted along the way. The van doors remained shut after that.

Perhaps they were too scared; Lily didn’t act out again. Instead, she obediently nestled in the first row of seats, dutifully maintaining her image as the innocent little flower, and managed to persuade quite a few oblivious men to defend her.

By the time they reached the fortress, it was already afternoon. Alex was stationed at the watchtower with his team, spotting Ethan’s vehicle in the distance and excitedly notifying Brittany via the intercom.

Meanwhile, Brittany was busy training Jess. Recently, Jess had been progressing rapidly, even participating in a real mission with the team. The group had been praising her, remarking how different a disciple of Brittany was.

Upon hearing that Ethan had arrived with a van full of people, Brittany gathered Jess and the other new recruits in training, driving to the gate.

A group of over a dozen stood on the city wall, peering down. Brittany quickly spotted Ethan, and remembering their rather awkward public relationship, she signaled for her team to put on a show.

Ivy, seizing her moment, began to act, fully embracing the drama. The few who knew the real story buried their faces, unable to watch the spectacle.

Yet, those unaware of the truth were captivated; no matter the time, dramatic conflict always drew attention.

“Brittany, we are sisters at the end of the day. Since Ethan has chosen me, you should be magnanimous. After all, you two never really started anything, right?” Ivy said loudly, her tone theatrical. If not for her exaggerated quiver at the end, her performance might have been more convincing—better than some reality TV stars before the apocalypse, at least.

“Hmph, what nonsense is that? Your affairs with him have nothing to do with me. What do you mean by being magnanimous? Don't spout words that make no sense,” Brittany retorted coldly, feeling utterly indifferent, yet those around her interpreted it as a fierce rivalry between two women vying for the same man.

“Oh come on, that’s just boring. Brittany, if you say it’s no big deal, then it’s no big deal, right?”

Just then, Lily emerged from the van and walked over to Ethan, whispering sweetly, “Ethan, what’s going on? Why is Ivy arguing with someone?”

Lily didn’t recognize Brittany at all, but the sharp-eyed Brittany instantly remembered her as the one who had so generously shared others’ misfortunes and had a penchant for melodrama. The last time she saw her was at the old base when she was whisked away by a group of influential figures. She hadn’t expected her to end up at this base and come here with Ethan—was this to awaken her abilities?

Now, she found herself in the audience, amused as she watched the exchange between Ivy and Lily. Just as she decided it was time to let them in, she instructed Alex to prepare to open the door, only to witness the two women break into a physical altercation.

To be precise, it was one-sided; Ivy had held in her anger all the way back and couldn’t take it anymore. With a slap, she delivered a stinging blow to Lily’s face.

“Ah! How dare you hit me?”

Lily clutched her face, and instead of retaliating, she looked up with tear-filled eyes at the nearby man, her voice weak and trembling, “Ethan…”

Brittany raised an eyebrow at this. Oh, so there’s more to this scene?
