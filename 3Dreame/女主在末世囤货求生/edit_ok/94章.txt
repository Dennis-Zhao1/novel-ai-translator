**Ruthless Green Tea**

In the following days, Laura Bennett made a concerted effort to integrate herself into the Springfield base, trying to get a better grasp of the situation there. The promised assistance from the self-proclaimed "queen bee," who had said she would arrange a guide for Laura, never materialized. It seemed like she was being kept under tight surveillance, too afraid to act impulsively.

During every meal, Laura could feel the weight of several curious eyes on her. Acting oblivious, she continued to use her points card to buy various items around the base. Five hundred points wasn't a lot, but it wasn't negligible either. By being frugal, she could easily stretch it to last a month, spending only ten or so points a day. With the wedding ceremony approaching, and her plans to leave shortly after, she couldn't help but wonder who would end up benefiting from those points. So, she spent them without hesitation, sending a clear signal that she was a character driven by desire—someone who didn't understand finance. A person with such obvious flaws was easy to manipulate and control.

As expected, the scrutinizing gazes around her faded away during meal times. The queen bee was cautious and had a decent understanding of human nature, but she still underestimated Laura.

After two days of exploring the base, Laura had gained considerable insight. Aside from the guards checking identification at the villa area, she had managed to scope out every corner of the base, even slipping into the wedding venue disguised as a staff member. 

The wedding ceremony was set to take place in the central hall of the base, featuring soaring ceilings that reached nearly thirty feet high, adorned with extravagant chandeliers made of crystal in various shapes. A dozen round tables were already laid out, covered in champagne-pink tablecloths. The entrance and stage were decorated for the occasion, complete with massive welcome portraits of the couple. It was a testament to the talents within the Springfield base; they had even managed to create the artwork when there were no photos available for printing.

The LED screens on stage were currently cycling through testing videos and audio clips. Laura recalled the USB drive she had in her possession—would the queen bee attempt to use the LED screens for some nefarious purpose? It was a classic yet effective tactic.

As Laura pinpointed the locations of the weapon and supply depots, she realized that the tight security at the entrance was a clear indication of their importance. Was this all part of Ethan's plan? Laura had no intention of following the queen bee's reckless orders, but that didn’t mean nothing would happen. With the queen bee's all-or-nothing approach, sending only one person to disrupt the wedding seemed dangerously naive.

The queen bee insisted on personally handing something to the bride. Before she saw the LED screens, she might have believed it. But once she laid eyes on those screens, even Laura instinctively thought of using them for something. How could the queen bee miss such a golden opportunity?

As expected, prior to the ceremony, armed forces had intensified patrols around the villa area and the hall, forbidding ordinary people from lingering or walking about in those regions. Consequently, the security at the weapon and supply depots relaxed a bit.

During these days, Laura not only scouted around but also learned the routines of the patrol shifts and pinpointed the queen bee's whereabouts. She discovered that the queen bee was staying next door to the villa she had lived in during her previous life, specifically in Ethan’s villa. She decided it was time to deal with this queen bee once and for all, ensuring she would never dare to betray her again. After living for so long, it was time for revenge.

Using her psychic abilities to sense her surroundings, Laura found the right moment to slip into the villa area. The guards consisted of only a few ability users, and Laura's psychic power far exceeded theirs. Even if there were psychic users among them, they wouldn't be able to detect her. She easily scaled the barbed-wire fences, evaded three rounds of patrolling soldiers, and, just after seven o'clock, found herself outside the queen bee's villa.

Sure enough, guards were stationed at the entrance—two ability users and four regular soldiers. Fortunately, the queen bee was alone inside. With a swift move, Laura sent ice spikes to take out the soldiers patrolling outside the villa. She quickly stored their bodies in her space, then climbed to the second floor through an ajar window, disposing of the bodies in an empty room. Following her psychic sense, she made her way to the queen bee's bedroom door.

Inside, she could hear the queen bee cursing, expressing her hopes for everything to go smoothly, calling Ethan's father and son bastards. If it weren't for her space abilities, she would have ended them by now. There were also mentions of a baby, with promises that she would make them the sole heir to the base, and claims that everything stored in her space was for the baby. She even declared that the father was also for the baby and that no one could take them away.

From Laura's observation, the queen bee was definitely no more than four months pregnant, with barely any visible signs yet. The child was likely just a developing embryo, and yet she was already subjecting it to her brainwashing prenatal education.

What shocked Laura even more was the revelation that the queen bee was also a space user. This explained why Ethan had not disposed of her directly, and why they had become entangled in her previous life.

Reflecting on her past life and this one, Laura realized that without her engagement to Ethan, the queen bee had seduced him instead. Ethan was now in a position to control everything. It made sense why the queen bee held a relatively high status within the base.

Determined, Laura pushed the door open unnoticed, firing ice spikes that pierced through the queen bee's wrist and knee joint. Before she could scream, Laura stuffed a rag into her mouth. 

This entire sequence unfolded in a matter of seconds. The queen bee was on the brink of fainting from the pain, desperately trying to see the face of her assailant. When she recognized Laura, her eyes widened in disbelief. She knew exactly who Laura was—the woman who had once wanted her dead, who had influenced several of Springfield Base's actions against the Apocalypse Fortress.

Yet, how had Laura managed to slip in so quietly? And what could be her motives for such an attack?

The queen bee herself couldn't fathom why she felt a surge of jealousy and resentment upon seeing Laura. Why did they have to be so different? Both were women, both not bad looking, yet their backgrounds were worlds apart.

One was an heiress to a multi-billion-dollar fortune, a celebrity on the Forbes list, frequently trending online, living a life of luxury without a care in the world. The other was desperately clawing her way out of the shackles of poverty imposed by her family, working tirelessly despite her talents, feeling nothing but envy and hatred.

Laura watched the queen bee, drenched in cold sweat, her face pale as blood oozed from the wounds caused by the ice spikes, soaking her delicate dress. It was a familiar scene; in her past life, she had been in the same position. Now, the roles had been reversed.

Drawing a dagger, Laura emulated the actions the queen bee had once used against her, tracing lines from left to right, top to bottom, her voice cold and devoid of empathy. 

“So, you’re a space ability user, huh? If you want to live, then offer me something in exchange. Otherwise, I’ll carve your face and give you two slashes in your belly. Without beauty and a baby, how will you stay by Ethan’s side?”

With rage in her eyes, the queen bee’s expression twisted, and muffled cries escaped her lips. But Laura didn’t give her the chance to waste words; time was of the essence.

Counting down, “Three, two, one…”

Before the queen bee could react, Laura slashed her face, just below her chin. 

The queen bee was in a frenzy, trying to escape Laura's grasp, but it was futile. 

Laura stepped down on her injured knee, the sickening crunch of shattered bone echoing in the air. 

As the queen bee writhed in agony, her vision blurred, and she couldn't lift her wrist. 

“There's no other choice for you. I could just kill you outright, but out of consideration for your child, I’m giving you one chance to live. If you refuse, then you can die.”

The queen bee felt Laura's murderous intent piercing her like a tangible force, and her tears streamed down her face as she nodded frantically in agreement.

Struggling, she raised her pierced wrist, and in an instant, the room filled with an array of supplies. Understanding dawned on Laura—this was why Ethan felt secure enough to invite other base leaders and powerful ability users to the wedding ceremony, and why the guards at the weapon and supply depots had become lax.

Everything was part of Ethan's plan. He must have made promises to the queen bee, using her while also keeping an eye on her.

However, the queen bee’s ambition was to become the rightful Mrs. Ethan, and the Ethan family was likely aware of the child already. If they weren't, she would have been eliminated long ago.

Laura couldn't help but recall that just three or four months ago, Ethan had been in critical condition from a gunshot wound. How could he be orchestrating this wedding under such circumstances?

Could it be that her son was actually his brother? What a tangled web of family drama!
