**Internal Strife**

As the conversation drew to a close, Laura Benson watched the doctor administer the last two doses of the special medication into the IV bag. Emily Parker sat by her sister Sarah's bedside, gently holding her hand. Not wanting to intrude, Laura and her friend quietly left the hospital room.

Descending the dimly lit staircase, illuminated by the flickering overhead lights, Jack Thomas considered asking Laura about her recovery and what had truly happened. But he opted to hold back, deciding it was best to let her share at her own pace.

Laura, meanwhile, felt utterly drained from the day's events. The internal struggle she had faced left her exhausted, and all she could think about was getting back to her room for some much-needed rest. They walked in silence until reaching their quarters. After exchanging greetings with Megan and the others, Laura collapsed onto her bed, eager for sleep.

The next day, feeling refreshed, Laura carried two bottles of herbal tea upstairs for Emily. Building alliances was crucial, and knowing Emily’s character—loyal to friends and unyielding to foes—Laura believed that offering a gesture of kindness now would strengthen their bond for future challenges. After all, facing adversaries was always easier with strong allies.

By then, Sarah's health had visibly improved. Her once pale and gaunt face now had a healthy glow, a subtle blush that caught Laura by surprise. She marveled at the remarkable recovery and briefly considered trying the treatment herself but quickly dismissed the idea with a chuckle.

After checking in on Sarah, Emily called her trusted team to strategize with Laura and her group. They focused on the report about Frank Butler, a man with unique abilities who had fled the safe house with his partner amidst the chaos of the previous night. His escape had been swift and calculated.

As they delved into their discussion, an unexpected wave of unrest erupted at the Longview Base. Lower-tier ability users had formed an alliance and launched a surprise attack. In the meeting room, filled with Emily's closest aides, everyone reacted instantly. Even some non-ability individuals found the courage to confront the rebels, standing firm against former allies. Emily remained calm, as if nothing was amiss.

She knew Frank was a formidable adversary, but she hadn’t anticipated such rapid destabilization at Longview. It seemed Frank was a master manipulator. Yet, was it really all in these few days? Memories of her and Sarah's own awakening and subsequent battles crept into her thoughts, sowing seeds of doubt.

Laura observed the escalating conflict and whispered to Jack, "Didn’t you say Longview was rock solid? How did things unravel so quickly?"

Jack merely smiled, observing the faces in the room. Nobody seemed surprised; they all appeared prepared, ready for a chance to eliminate hidden threats.

Having witnessed similar situations before, Laura quickly understood. She settled in to watch the drama unfold, assessing the abilities of Emily's team. The internal strife was surprisingly brief and one-sided. Some rebels lay dead, others were captured by Emily’s loyalists. Emily surveyed the defeated dissenters with the disdain one might afford pesky insects, uninterested in any bribes Frank might have offered them. Her gaze fixed on the apparent leader, whose defiant expression only heightened Emily's impatience. With a cold smile, she instructed, “Remove them all. Take their energy crystals and dispose of them.”

Cries for mercy echoed, yet Emily’s expression remained unchanged. As pleas fell on deaf ears, the room thickened with a chilling silence, broken only by the terrified murmurs of those who hadn’t joined the revolt. Fear was palpable, but mingled with it was a sense of respect; decisive leadership was crucial in their harsh world.

Emily addressed the crowd firmly, “Anyone unhappy with my leadership is free to leave Longview. No one will stop you. If you wish to challenge me, do it openly instead of lurking like cowards, ambushing under the guise of loyalty.”

She then brandished a crystal taken from a rebel, causing some attendees to tremble. “This is the fate of traitors. Next time, the end won’t be so swift.”

Her icy gaze swept the room, and no one dared meet her eyes. A few guilty individuals had already lowered their heads, understanding that by eliminating these threats, Longview would only grow stronger.

Laura watched Emily’s show of strength, contemplating whether the crystal or a more dramatic display would have been more effective.

After quickly wrapping up the interrupted meeting, Emily left, allowing Lisa, Anna, and Laura to finalize the details.

With Sarah’s condition steadily improving, it was only a matter of time before she fully recovered. With Emily and the others now wary of Frank Butler and harboring a deep grudge, any future encounters were unlikely to be friendly.

Once communication was established and future plans set, Laura felt satisfied with the successful venture. She had gained both allies and the activation of her psychic abilities.

It was a double blessing, and she found herself eager to head home, enjoy some comfort food, and perhaps sing along to her favorite playlist.

Suddenly, she remembered her earlier intention to visit her old family home. She arranged for Megan and the others to return to the base while she drove to the old house.

Jack and the others didn’t pry about her destination, only advising her to be cautious of the strange creatures, especially after the previous night’s attack. Laura was confident her psychic abilities could handle any threat; in fact, she welcomed the chance to test them.

Insisting on going alone, she waved cheerfully to her friends and drove away.

Humming a tune, Laura felt good driving back to the old house until she found herself confronted by unexpected visitors. Her smile vanished.

Frank Butler had some nerve, sending his men to occupy her family’s property—was he turning the Benson estate into his base?

This was unacceptable!

Seeing Frank’s men patrolling near her home, including the notorious "Mover" Mike and his crew, Laura’s mood darkened. How had he survived the explosion at the villa? He was a problem that wouldn’t go away.

If this were elsewhere, she’d have attacked without hesitation, but she couldn’t risk damaging her ancestral home.

Now, as a level four dual-ability powerhouse, she wasn’t afraid of the creatures. It was a perfect chance to confront them. Driving boldly past, she conjured an ice spike, catching Mike completely off guard. He’d assumed she was just another ability user, but before he could even react, he and his lackeys were swiftly taken down.

The swift execution did little to quell Laura’s anger. She drove straight to her home’s entrance, her psychic energy mapping out all living beings inside and out.

After parking, she stored her car and quickly prepared as an opponent rushed out from the gate. With a flick of her wrist, she sent several ice spikes flying, and he fell instantly. The remaining ability users, witnessing their comrade’s sudden fall, fled in terror.
