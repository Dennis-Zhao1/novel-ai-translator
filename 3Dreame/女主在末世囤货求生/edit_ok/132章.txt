**Smart People Often Fall for Their Own Cleverness**

Dr. Smith sat in her office, engaged in a crucial discussion with her colleague, Ethan. Over the past few days, she had been analyzing data related to Jack Anderson, enhanced ability users, and the enigmatic elements surrounding them. The conclusion she reached left her astounded.

"Jack Anderson is also an enhanced ability user. What we can rule out is that his enhancement method is unrelated to the usual methods. Moreover, his ability core is unlike those of ordinary people. Currently, both zombies and ability users exhibit single crystal systems, while he possesses a multi-crystal system," Dr. Smith explained.

As she spoke, she opened a file on her computer that contained scans of Jack's ability core alongside those of others. It was evident that Jack's core was not only larger than the others but also structurally distinct.

Pointing at Jack's core, Dr. Smith elaborated, "Look here, it was once just a small surface, but now it has developed a sharp point, and it's growing bigger every day. If a crystal represents a specific ability, I suspect he might be able to awaken multiple abilities."

Lily Jackson understood how her dual abilities came to be. In reality, her psychic power wasn't derived from her core but was a gift from a different realm. Once her mental power reached a certain level, it could naturally manifest as an ability. This was classified as a pseudo-ability, whereas true dual or even multi-ability users like Jack were likely one of a kind.

She recalled how Matt Taylor managed this. Initially, Lily learned from Jack that he had previously been in a similar laboratory, subjected to tranquilizers meant to control him. Matt wouldn’t use such tactics against ordinary people; this unique situation was simply astonishing.

Suddenly, she pondered what methods she would employ if she lost someone as significant as Jack. It struck her that Matt’s recent actions seemed juvenile and illogical.

Dr. Smith continued, "If he is a multi-ability user, and if we can discover how he transforms, we could replicate it, enabling all ability users to potentially become multi-ability users. Even ordinary ability users might awaken anomalous abilities, significantly enhancing their power."

This was a wake-up call for Lily. Her previously muddled thoughts suddenly clarified.

Indeed, if ability users became stronger, zombies would be suppressed. Matt had deliberately placed Jack under her command, believing he would never let any of his subordinates slip away. What was once humanity's hope could end up dead at her hands. If this were to come to light, her reputation within the community would undoubtedly suffer a massive blow. Psychological warfare was Matt’s forte.

Unfortunately for him, he didn’t know that Lily possessed both psychic abilities and the art of foresight, allowing her to uncover the hidden dangers and discrepancies. It was as if he had personally delivered such a valuable experimental subject right to her.

Smart people often fall for their own cleverness; it was almost laughable.

Lily clapped her hands in admiration. "You truly are remarkable, Dr. Smith! This research direction could be your new project. I believe you'll crack it soon!"

Dr. Smith looked at the charming Lily, feeling an influx of motivation. This was her area of expertise, one she was both passionate and confident about. She was determined to solve this problem—just wait and see!

With the answers in hand, Lily was overjoyed. The prospect of multi-ability users was enticing; even she began to dream of what other abilities she could awaken. The allure of such power was simply irresistible, explaining the excitement and fervor of ordinary citizens.

However, she knew that progress must be made step by step. The most pressing tasks at hand were the ability awakening plan and collaboration with the Phoenix Base. She was eagerly awaiting the delivery of the ability cores.

Once she left the lab and settled into her office, Sarah promptly handed her a well-organized list. All twenty-two members of the security team were on it, along with four others, including Mike and three members of the Johnson family. The only unfamiliar names were four, but Sarah had kindly annotated each name with specific positions, arrival dates at the base, and names of their relatives, confirming that they were all families of ability users. Lily nodded, thinking that it was better to start with people who had family ties rather than those who were solitary; the first batch of ‘loners’ was indeed unsuitable.

This was merely the elimination of the traps Matt had set; who knew what deeper layers might still exist? The likelihood of encountering more ‘loners’ was too high, and there was no need to risk wasting precious resources.

The thirty-person list would be posted on the bulletin board outside the cafeteria that afternoon, but the injection schedule would not be disclosed. As a result, those who didn’t make the list began to speculate. Fortunately, there were no instigators around to stir up trouble like before.

However, there was some dissatisfaction regarding Mike’s inclusion on the list. Many felt it was unfair that he was not punished for his previous violent behavior. Just as the murmurs of discontent were about to grow, someone pointed out that the person Mike had killed was a spy who had infiltrated from outside and had actively exposed the undercover plot, naming several other spies and thereby achieving great merit.

This revelation quelled the unfair rumors. With tears in his eyes, Mike knew that Lily had been secretly observing and assisting him. She had even given him the opportunity first, a stark contrast to the unscrupulous person who had harmed his father and son.

At long last, he was ready. Once he awakened his abilities, he would apply to go out and avenge that scoundrel for his father and son.

Matt, seizing the moment while everyone’s attention was fixated on the bulletin board, glanced at the list and realized his name was absent. His anxiety grew to the point of distress.

Desperately, he caught Lily alone and said pitifully, “Miss Lily, my name isn’t on the list—was it an oversight?”

Lily couldn’t bear to see his despair and shook her head helplessly. “You’re not a member of our base, so you can’t be listed directly. But don’t worry; I’ve set aside a spot for you in that group. In a few days, once preparations are complete, you’ll receive your injection.”

Finally receiving an answer, Matt’s genuine smile lit up his face, a stark contrast to the façade he usually wore. Lily shook her head, letting him revel in his happiness while she got back to her tasks.

Apart from her daily duties in the community, her time was consumed by practicing her abilities and enhancing her mental strength. She knew that Alex Carter must have found some way to level up again, and she couldn’t afford to fall behind, especially now that the possibility of multi-ability users had emerged, filling her with hope for the future.

Her intuition told her that multi-ability users might just be the key to defeating Matt.

As she organized her spatial realm, new changes began to manifest. Previously, she had taken a laissez-faire approach, viewing the space merely as a storage area. But having realized the unique qualities of the lake within, she finally began to explore the unknowns of her spatial realm with newfound curiosity.
