All eyes turned towards the speaker. As soon as he began, those familiar with him knew exactly who he was.

"Captain Alex, you've become a top ability user with power and influence, basking in fame and success. What gives you the right to oppose this?" a frail, pale man asked angrily.

"Yeah, what gives you the right?" The crowd erupted in angry shouts, highlighting the tension between ability users and non-ability users.

It was already the apocalypse; every method to increase survival chances needed to be tried, and the opportunity was right in front of them. It wasn't something that could be easily halted by one person's words.

"Let's not create divisions here. Captain Alex hasn't even stated his reasons yet, and you're all jumping to conclusions. It's unnecessary." At this moment, Sarah, who had regained her composure, spoke up. Ethan raised an eyebrow, seemingly surprised. Were these two really on the same page?

Watching the ordinary folks getting riled up, each anxious and demanding a stance from Ethan, who was on stage, she furrowed her brows and looked at Alex. Wasn't the ability awakening program something that had been decided before they left? Why was he opposing it now?

Alex also looked across the crowd at Ethan on stage, his expression cold and silent.

Jamie was puzzled too. What were Alex and Sarah up to? To prevent the situation from escalating, he hurriedly stepped onto the stage to mediate.

"Everyone, please calm down. The ability awakening serum has just been developed and is still in the trial phase. It hasn't been mass-produced yet. Today is merely a rally to gauge interest in awakening abilities. Those interested can come to me or Lisa after the meeting to sign up. But this awakening process carries risks; it's not guaranteed to succeed. You all need to be mentally prepared for the possibility of failure. Moreover, we're not accepting applications from anyone under 18 for now."

The crowd remained unsatisfied with Alex, their frustrations boiling over as they continued to shout accusations. While no one dared to directly insult him, given his well-known strength, many interpreted his thoughts in the most malicious ways. Upon hearing they could sign up, their attention quickly shifted, and they began discussing who to sign up with after the meeting.

At this point, Ethan had already left the stage. He needed to find out what Alex was really doing. After he spoke up, many possibilities began to swirl in her mind. Since her rebirth, it had been difficult for her to genuinely trust anyone. Most important matters were in her own hands. However, she had a higher degree of trust in Alex compared to others.

They had exchanged secrets, knowing each other's deepest and most hidden cards. Moreover, Alex had never betrayed her. Even when she deliberately delegated authority to him, she never saw him make any small moves. His actions today were completely unexpected. A voice in her mind sarcastically noted that what was meant to come would eventually arrive.

Just by looking at Sarah’s attitude towards him, it proved that her understanding of him might only be the tip of the iceberg. Even the system, which was an external aid, might only represent a small part of him.

Reminding herself to stay calm, reason told her that even if Alex truly had something going on with Sarah, it was essential to consider how much of their secrets he had shared with her. He could share his secrets with anyone he chose, but if...

She braced herself for both the best and worst outcomes, letting out a soft sigh. Of course, she hoped for the best.

Alex remained silent, offering only his three-word opposition, and stood aside, watching coldly as if he were not the one stirring the pot.

Ethan wasn’t the only one wanting to hear Alex’s explanation. Core members like Mike and Anna also wanted to understand his reasoning.

Of course, they couldn’t just dismiss him because of his opposition; they had to give him the opportunity to speak.

The group with heavy expressions made their way to Ethan’s office, where the sofa and chairs were filled with people. They left the guards at the door, and everyone inside the office focused their gaze on Alex, eager to find out what he was really planning.

Alex met their unwelcoming gazes with a smile. "Don't look at me like that. I can explain."

Unexpectedly, everyone around him spoke in unison, their expressions and actions eerily synchronized, arms crossed in a "let's see what you come up with" stance.

"Then go ahead and explain."

Feeling a little guilty, Alex rubbed his nose and said seriously, "Today I inspected the power station maintenance points and the route the zombies took toward the fortress gate, and I discovered several issues."

"Do we really need you to say there’s a problem? Stop wasting time. What does this have to do with opposing the awakening of abilities?" Mike, impatient, interrupted. He had considered Alex a brother, but now, during such a critical moment, he found him rambling about obvious matters.

Alex didn’t get angry over this. Sarah immediately jumped to his defense, saying, "Mike, don't be so harsh. Let him finish."

Mike was taken aback by her response. He looked at his lady, who seemed indifferent as if she hadn’t heard anything, then exchanged a glance with Anna. He decided not to press further. Both of them were overwhelmed with unspoken thoughts.

Jamie, who had been playing the role of a silent observer, felt a sense of foreboding.

Clearing his throat and not bothering to argue, Alex continued, "The normal maintenance points connect to the most turbulent section of the river. Even if the zombies found the entry point, how could they immediately discern the direction and accurately locate the maintenance point?"

Upon hearing this, the sharp-minded individuals quickly grasped the implications. Indeed, while the power station was large and easy to identify, the idea that the zombies could pinpoint the maintenance point so quickly and easily break through the iron net of the maintenance area amidst the raging waters was highly improbable.

Alex, Mike, and the others had not been gone long to assist Ethan. The hooded zombies were still on the mountainside near the winding mountain road. Even with their speed, it would take them at least an hour to traverse from that side. After calculating the time Ethan and the others took to eliminate the zombies and gather the crystal cores before seeing the blue smoke signal, it became evident that the timeline was tight. This left only one possibility.

There was a mole inside the fortress, and they had guided the zombies to the precise location of the maintenance point.

What was baffling was why they would risk entering through the maintenance point. In reality, the zombies could have easily broken through a random wall surrounding the fortress. Alex seemed to anticipate the crowd’s confusion and explained, "Breaking through a wall would create too much noise, easily alerting the patrols and triggering the alarm. Entering through the maintenance point has its advantages: first, the power station is relatively remote, and the noise from the machines is already loud; second, the maintenance point is easier to breach without much effort; and third, the zombies chose this route because it’s the quickest and shortest path from the power station to the gate, taking only ten minutes."

Mike still remained puzzled. "What does this have to do with the awakening plan?"

Alex looked at his confused expression, patiently elaborating, "All the ability users have been dispatched. Only those stationed at the watchtower and at the power station have the capability to fight back. Zombies don’t distinguish who the infiltrators are. The real infiltrator would never take the risk of exposing themselves to danger. Moreover, the remaining ability users in the fortress were mostly bitten by zombies, making it highly likely that the infiltrator is a non-ability user. If this person then acquires abilities through the awakening plan, it would make their subsequent actions much easier and harder to eliminate."

As soon as he finished speaking, Mike suddenly understood, while Ethan had already linked his inspection of the maintenance point to broader implications. If this person was indeed a spy sent by an enemy, she started to think about how she would utilize this pawn. What if there were more than one?

As this realization struck her, she felt a chill run down her spine. The enemy had long been in contact with the group and could be said to know the inner workings of the fortress quite well. If his people successfully became ability users through the awakening plan, they would essentially turn into a group of enemies against her.

In the midst of the crowd's uncertain gazes, Ethan suddenly conceived a plan. The office was filled with trusted allies, but to avoid too many voices and distractions, she needed to put on a show. If Alex was willing to take the blame and draw fire, then she could use that to her advantage and lay out her strategy behind the scenes.
