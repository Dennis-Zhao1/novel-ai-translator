**Preparing for Battle**

Everything was meticulously arranged, each item carefully gathered, transforming what had once been a mere warehouse into a hidden stockpile. Ready for combat, each of the ability users received their supplies: crystal cores, bottled water, and easy-to-carry snacks.

The guard team, as usual, was equipped with firearms, while those lacking shooting experience wielded swords and daggers, crafted by the skilled Smith family. Though the arsenal was limited, it was sufficient for the team’s needs.

Surveying the scene, Ivy Smith, the leader, felt a surge of pride seeing the progress the group had made, resembling a team of well-trained soldiers. Her Uncle James took a moment to confer with her privately, sharing his observations. Nodding in acknowledgment, Ivy requested a list from her younger uncle. She circled a few names and assigned them to the most isolated positions, ensuring discreet monitoring of their movements.

Training and patrolling continued as usual, albeit with increased frequency and caution. Ethan, Ivy's loyal second-in-command, shadowed her closely. New recruits, Jake and Lucy, frequently reported any anomalies. Ethan’s gaze lingered a bit too long on the pair, unusual for someone typically indifferent to such matters.

“What’s caught your eye? Is there a problem?” Ivy asked, eyebrow raised.

“Uh, not really. Just surprised those two aren’t bickering today. It’s almost... harmonious.”

Ivy chuckled, recalling how often Jake and Lucy used to clash. It seemed even the fiercest rivals could find peace.

Time trudged on, or so it seemed to Ethan, who found the unusual calm disconcerting. His thoughts were transparent, drawing a laugh from Ivy.

“If you’re bored, why not spar with me? I’ve been itching to try a new move.”

Ethan perked up, excitement replacing his earlier unease. He assumed a stance, and Ivy took her time, allowing him to prepare. As Ethan launched his first attack, Ivy casually dodged and unleashed a flurry of ice spikes.

Ethan scrambled to evade the barrage, eyes wide with a mix of panic and thrill. “Whoa, this is intense!”

Seeing Ethan still had the energy for banter, Ivy smirked. She skillfully blocked his escape routes, prompting him to shout, “I give up! Mercy, please!”

With a flick of her hand, the ice spikes halted, forming a shimmering dome around Ethan. He gave Ivy a mock bow, earning a laugh as she dispelled the icy prison.

Ethan returned to her side with a wide grin. “That was incredible! Your powers have definitely leveled up. I could barely keep up!”

Ivy nodded, pleased with her progress. She had indeed reached new heights with her abilities, wielding ice with finesse. She particularly enjoyed the spikes for their sleek, satisfying strike.

Their sparring session attracted onlookers, all keenly aware of Ivy’s rapid ascent. Witnessing Ethan, once a formidable opponent, overwhelmed so effortlessly, stoked their ambitions.

“Miss Ivy, I want to level up too!” Ethan exclaimed, ever straightforward.

Ivy chuckled. “Patience, my friend. The lab’s been moved, and without our researchers, there’s no one to administer the enhancements.”

“Oh, right. We need to ensure their safety until they return.”

This reminder prompted Ivy to consider their precious resources, making sure Meng, their chief researcher, stayed secure.

Nightfall brought Xander, a trusted ally, back to the fortress. Alert to the sound of approaching vehicles, Ivy awaited their arrival. Once Xander and his team disembarked, Ivy quickly shared her strategy.

Xander promptly contacted Meng, advising him to delay his return. The journey was fraught with danger, and only a handful of ability users accompanied him, clearing a path through hordes of zombies. Knowing his team was safe relieved Xander, who reminded Ivy to look after their well-being.

Jake and Lucy reported in once more, and Ivy instructed them to guide Xander’s team to gather weapons and supplies, treating them as allies. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement, providing a chance to earn crystal cores in exchange for ability-enhancing potions.

Checking on a deep pit that had recently appeared, Ivy warned Xander. “See this massive hole? It’s deep, so keep your distance. If anything changes, stay clear to avoid getting hurt.”

Ivy rolled her eyes at the playful banter between Xander and his partner, amused by their camaraderie.

“Come on, you should make a move. Waiting for her to come to you? That’s frustrating!” Ethan teased Xander, nudging him toward Ivy.

Xander chuckled, knowing he needed to take the initiative. But Ivy’s reactions had been a mix of surprise and distance, leaving him hesitant to push further. He had learned to respect her boundaries, understanding that true care involved restraint and consideration.

Later, as they returned to their quarters, Xander and his partner exchanged knowing smiles, aware of the chemistry between Ivy and Xander.

The mountain wind howled at night, stirring the air around the mysterious black hole. Ivy’s sharp ears caught faint hissing noises within the gusts. Quickly, she ordered everyone to move back to the edge of the square. Just as confusion spread among the group, a shadowy figure erupted from the depths of the pit.

“Run!” Ivy shouted, instincts kicking in as chaos ensued.
