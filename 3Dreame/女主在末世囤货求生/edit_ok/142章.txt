**Sneaky Shenanigans**

Adam Carter watched as a woman suddenly rushed forward, effortlessly stepping in front of Serena Thompson, as if her very presence was meant to uphold the idol’s purity. Who did this shameless girl think she was?

Megan was taken aback by Adam's boldness. Just as she considered lowering her raised leg, she felt an urge to kick that pretentious woman. Thankfully, she managed to hold back.

The haughty girl with the delicate features, known as Lily, feigned innocence, her voice dripping with faux sadness. “Ethan, why is this young man blocking me?”

Her tone was so pitiful, it was as if someone had bullied her.

Adam scrutinized Lily, who wore a flowing white dress with her hair casually styled in a loose braid. Her fair skin and stunning appearance made her stand out, but he quickly cast a glance at his friend Leo Sterling. Despite the difference in looks, it was clear that Leo had an undeniable charm that attracted admiration from women, especially with his combination of strength and good looks.

Just then, Zara returned, escorted by her uncle, and the group formed a small cluster at the entrance of the dormitory. The other staff exchanged glances, wondering if a scene was about to break out. 

Three women and one man—was drama about to ensue?

Everyone silently questioned, their gazes flitting between the four of them. Leo, uncomfortable with the scene, had initially come to watch but now found himself unwittingly embroiled in the theatrics. After offering a brief greeting, he decided it was time to leave.

Lily giggled, relishing the attention. “Oh, Ethan, why are you ignoring me? Just the other day at the Harper Base, you called me ‘cutie’!”

Leo halted mid-step, recalling Lily’s previous antics. Intrigued by her boldness, he chose to stay and watch.

Feeling emboldened by the attention, Lily sidled closer to Ethan, attempting to wrap her arm around his. However, Zara, caught up in the unfolding drama, yanked Lily away. In a dramatic twist, Lily fell to the ground, feigning tears. “Ethan, Zara is bullying me! I’m in so much pain!”

“Stop pretending! Do you think this is the Harper Base? Your usual crew isn’t here to witness your act. Open your eyes and see this is the Phoenix Fortress,” Zara snapped, her hands on her hips, disdain evident in her voice.

“Ethan, you need to control her! She’s so vile and spreads rumors. I’m not like that! She pushed me, look at my hand, it’s all scraped!” 

Lily raised her hand, showing off a barely-there scratch that would heal completely in no time.

Zara rolled her eyes dramatically, glaring at Ethan several times, who merely shook his head. He had come to enjoy watching the chaos unfold, and Adam stood nearby, grinning mischievously.

Megan, linking her arm with Leo’s, was thoroughly entertained. She had only seen such antics in TV dramas.

When Lily noticed no one was rushing to help her after her fall, she climbed back to her feet, dusting off her dress. Turning, she spotted several men from the Harper Base standing by the dorm entrance.

“Help! They’re bullying me!” she cried, putting on her best pitiful expression. But this time, her usual tactic fell flat; the men had seen through her facade. They only viewed her as a black-hearted opportunist.

The men adopted a “watch and don’t interfere” attitude, leaving Lily without her usual supporters. The show was over; she cast a few sorrowful glances at Ethan before covering her face and running back to her dormitory, her exaggerated display eliciting involuntary shudders from Leo and Megan.

Before long, both girls burst into laughter, and Adam couldn’t hold back his chuckles, laughing even louder. Zara’s uncle didn’t understand the young people’s love-and-hate dramas and sighed, waving his hand as he left. Others, seeing the entertainment had ended, began to disperse.

As they walked back, Leo and Zara exchanged glances. “Keep an eye on that Lily girl. If anything happens, let me know,” Leo instructed, before leading Megan back to their dorm. Adam waved goodbye to his idol, unwilling to part just yet, before following them.

Zara frowned, her brows knitting together. She turned to Ethan and whispered, “Why don’t you use your charm to figure out who’s behind her? It’s too bothersome; let’s get this over with.”

Ethan nodded seriously, then replied, “I can’t just use my charm on a whim. Don’t be ridiculous.”

With that, he strode into the dormitory, leaving Zara to glare at his retreating figure. “Hmph, it’s not like he wants to lose that black-hearted lotus, jerk.”

In their shared dorm room, which was small and cramped, Zara was unlucky enough to be assigned to the same room as Lily. The two single beds were positioned on either side, and Zara had already set up her belongings on the window side. To her annoyance, she discovered her things had been moved to the door side.

Lily, on the other hand, flopped onto her bed, carelessly tossing her shoes aside, and began to sob into her pillow. Her cries were neither too loud nor too soft, but they were undeniably irritating.

Exasperated, Zara opted to ignore her and simply wished for a different place to stay. Unfortunately, due to the limited dorm rooms designed to isolate the residents from the outside world, there was no option. The adjacent rooms were all four-person setups, with twenty people from the Harper Base split into five dorms. Ethan had his own room, while Zara’s teammates were cramped into a room with bunk beds. She had inquired about switching to a different dorm, but ultimately decided to tough it out for just one night.

As per their plan, the chosen ten would undergo health checks the next day and be assigned to the awakening observation room. That night, everyone retired to bed early.

Zara fell asleep quickly, wishing to avoid looking at Lily’s face. To her surprise, she slept quite well, perhaps due to a lack of proper sleep for a long time. Just as she was tossing off her blanket to get up, a loud, obnoxious voice broke the silence.

“Shut up! If you can’t sleep, don’t disturb others!”
