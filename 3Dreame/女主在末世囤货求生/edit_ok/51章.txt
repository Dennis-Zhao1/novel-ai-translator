**You’ve Dirtied My Eyes**

Not only was Ethan skeptical of the other group's intentions, but Mike was growing wary too. A disciplined soldier would never invite outsiders on a mission without good reason. What were they plotting? Maybe they wanted to use them as bait to distract the zombies and conserve their own strength.

In this post-apocalyptic world, the rules were no longer clear. Only those who hadn't yet faced the grim reality acted as if things were normal. Ethan had seen too much darkness, and his wariness of others was as sharp as Mike's.

Mike rejected the proposal outright, saying their mission was too dangerous. The other party had survivors with them, and it would be unjust to drag them into danger. After saying this, he glanced over at the three women standing in the corner. Jenny and Sally nodded immediately in agreement; they just wanted to leave and get home quickly.

"Captain Smith, we really need to prioritize safety. Let's get out of here sooner rather than later," Jenny said, approaching Captain Smith with a look of concern.

Ethan suppressed his frustration, not wanting to stir up trouble, but he couldn't help shooting a glare at Jenny. The urge to confront her was intense, yet he didn't want her to get away so easily. If he missed this chance, who knew when they'd cross paths again? What if, like in his past life, she cozied up to someone like that beast, Frank?

Then again, if they were going to team up, he'd deal with both of them—why should he fear their partnership?

Perhaps his negative emotions were too evident, as Captain Smith noticed, his gaze shifting between Ethan and Jenny several times.

Sally, accustomed to confronting Jenny, seized the moment, “Jenny, don’t you find it disgusting? Being with you feels the least safe. Who knows if you’ll push someone into a zombie horde again?”

Jenny had been gazing warmly at Captain Smith, but at this, she looked even more aggrieved. Lowering her head, she replied softly, “I didn’t! I told you I didn’t. Don’t accuse me!”

In that moment, Ethan thought of a clever solution and addressed Sally, “If you don’t want to be with her, you can come with us. Just take care of this Jenny problem, and I promise your safety. I can tell you’re not fond of her, and you can get back at her for that incident with Tom.”

Ethan spoke in a teasing tone, but the content shocked everyone. Jenny's face went blank with disbelief, instinctively hiding behind Captain Smith, who happened to be her shield. She exclaimed, “Ethan, why are you targeting me? I’ve never offended you! Just because I’m wealthy, I can’t do as I please?”

Ethan looked at her affected demeanor, feeling nauseated. “Do I need a reason to be wary of you? Just looking at you makes me uneasy—doesn’t that count?”

Ethan adopted the demeanor of someone with nothing to lose, unbothered by being recognized. After all, he was a man who had made headlines multiple times.

“Don’t joke around. I can’t allow indiscriminate hostility here,” Captain Smith said, subtly brushing off Jenny’s hand that clung to his arm.

Ethan scoffed; he was merely baiting Jenny. If danger arose later, Sally would undoubtedly blame Jenny, who would cling to those special forces like a lifeline. With such dead weight, why fear them getting in their way?

Mike didn’t want to linger any longer. He bade everyone farewell and led the team away. Ethan followed, keeping his head high and his eyes straight ahead as they left.

Captain Smith hadn’t missed the expression in Ethan’s eyes earlier, and now that he was so easily giving up, it made him suspect they had something up their sleeves. This group was too mysterious; what secrets were they hiding?

As he watched Ethan and his group depart, Captain Smith didn’t rush to send his own team out. He was curious to see if they’d make any moves.

Meanwhile, Ethan and his group made their way to the surface via the parking lot exit. They circled the building but still couldn’t find the lab’s entrance. The sun was beginning to set, and if they didn’t hurry, they’d have to spend the night in the Dawn Building.

Everyone's anxiety began to rise. Ethan pulled out a brochure from the biotech company and examined it closely. He noticed the room number for the basement level was B22010. Was it possible that the basement could only be accessed via the elevator, which was located in the lobby and parking lot?

The lobby elevator required descending two levels, while the parking lot elevator only needed to go down one. After voicing his hypothesis, the team agreed; they had climbing ropes in their gear, which could help in this situation.

With a plan in place, Ethan and his group returned to the underground parking lot. When they got there, Captain Smith and his team had already left. Ethan felt a twinge of regret over missed opportunities, knowing they wouldn’t let him act on impulse. To others, Jenny seemed innocent and pure.

Finally, they found the elevator on the east side of the parking lot. The power had been cut, and even the elevator indicators were dark, making it challenging to spot in the shadows. Ethan was still pondering how to access the elevator when Mike spoke up, suggesting they first determine where the elevator was positioned during the power outage. If it happened to be at the basement level, they could jump from the first basement to the elevator and open the vent on top to get inside, then open the elevator doors. If it were in any other position, they would have to climb to the basement elevator entrance and force the doors open.

It sounded simple, but it wasn’t easy. Ethan nodded; having a method was better than having none. Unfortunately, they didn’t have a crowbar, and while he was calculating what tools could work best, Mike produced a fire axe and a fire hose from a nearby fire hydrant.

The others came over to help, while Ethan continued to search his space mentally for tools, having hoarded many supplies. Yet, he couldn’t immediately think of anything suitable and had to find a legitimate way to retrieve them.

Mike inserted the fire axe into the gap of the elevator door, while the others helped to push it open. Anmin cleverly wedged the metal head of the fire hose into the door crack, giving them a better leverage point to pry it open.

With effort, they successfully pried the elevator doors apart, revealing a dark elevator shaft. Everyone felt a surge of excitement; this meant they were one step closer to success. Mike had exerted great effort and now needed a moment to rest. They’d still have to pry open the door to the basement level, which posed a different challenge than the first basement.

The previous effort had been to push inward from the outside, which had provided leverage. Now, they needed to pull it open from the inside without any leverage, increasing the difficulty significantly. They also had to be wary of whether zombies might rush out when they opened the doors; the situation below was unclear. Ethan decided he needed to descend as well; at the very least, his instincts could help him assess the surroundings.

Anmin volunteered to go down first; he was the most accustomed to climbing. He secured himself with a rope and took the fire axe down. Following him was Ethan; being lighter, he only needed two people to lower him, while Anmin required three. Just as Ethan was about to secure his rope, a loud explosion erupted from the underground parking lot, followed by the deafening sound of gunfire.

Ethan looked up towards the source of the explosion, his heart racing with alarm. “This is bad! Pull Anmin back up!”
