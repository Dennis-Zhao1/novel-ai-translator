**Little Fanboy**

"Guess what, Lolo! You won't believe it, that kid is such a good actor. She made Ethan mad back at the Longxiang Base and then took it out on me. But she's got people protecting her everywhere—in Longxiang Base, it's Peter, and when she comes back, it's Jack. It's driving me nuts!"

Laura glanced over at Jack, who suddenly felt a bit uneasy. He quickly explained, "That girl's got a complicated background. Peter and I are just letting her slide for now to see who she's connected to. If we take her out, we lose our lead on their plans."

"I followed the addresses given by Fred, but couldn't find Sam, which means he's keeping a close eye on us. Maybe we can find a breakthrough through her."

Laura nodded and reassured Zoe, who was clinging to her side. "Okay, okay. I promise, once this is all over, you can vent all you want. But for now, just hang in there and play along."

Zoe, who thought coming back would be a break, let out a dramatic sigh, as if she were about to burst into tears. "I regret it!"

They sent Zoe off with her uncle to meet her family, while leaving Jack and Mike in the office to plan their next moves. Jack meticulously recounted everything he'd discovered while tracking Sam, raising several questions for analysis. Mike frowned deeply as he listened.

"Are you sure you're not being tracked with something like GPS? How can they respond so quickly?"

Jack felt the same way; even before everything went downhill, such quick reactions were rare. Now, it was even tougher. He had also asked the Noisy Ghost system if it had similar capabilities, but the answer was vague, leaving everything open to interpretation.

Laura remained optimistic. Over the past few days, the new ability users had made incredible progress. After training, they formed a formidable team, and with the medicine in hand, the collective power of everyone at the Longxiang Base was immense.

After reassuring Jack for a moment, Mike noted that it was time to attend the patrol team meeting and left. This left the two in the office, staring at each other in silence.

Suddenly remembering something important, Laura began discussing the new ability users. She mentioned that there were two with mutated abilities. Jack raised his eyebrows in surprise, particularly intrigued by Logan, who had the replication ability, and expressed his desire to see Logan's test results in the lab.

For the past few days, Logan had been undergoing various ability tests with Dr. Smith from 4:30 to 5:30 PM. The blood tests showed nothing unusual, and the crystal core had been CT scanned with no special findings. Dr. Smith, undeterred, decided to shift his approach to explore the limits of Logan's abilities.

Logan was eager to learn more about himself; understanding his boundaries would help him surpass them. Going now would allow them to catch today’s tests just in time. When Dr. Smith saw Jack arrive, he was surprised and quickly adjusted the testing plan, allowing Logan to interact with Jack.

Logan was actually a huge fan of Jack. He had always hoped to awaken lightning abilities. Now, as soon as he touched Jack, a strange energy surged through him, entirely different from anything he had felt before.

It wasn't like the destructive impulses of Will, nor the sluggishness of other abilities. The sensation of the lightning ability felt like his nerves were soaking in a hot spring—tingly and slightly painful.

He described his experience honestly, while Dr. Smith recorded everything. Laura shot a curious glance at Jack; the description seemed eerily similar to her own experience with spiritual energy in her space. Could it be that Jack had a similar sensation?

Yet Jack showed no particular reaction, perhaps due to the nature of his abilities, refocusing his attention on Logan.

After a moment of closed eyes and concentration, Logan raised his hand and unleashed a bolt of lightning at the dummy hanging on the lab wall. With the full power of a Level 3 ability user, the dummy's head exploded, scattering pieces all over the floor.

Logan realized that the gap between ordinary abilities and mutated abilities was vast. He often replicated Mike's metal abilities, which he thought were the strongest among ordinary abilities, but lightning and ice abilities were on a whole other level.

Before his mental energy ran out, he unleashed a flurry of attacks, pounding the dummies into a pulp. Dr. Smith recorded the destruction values, and soon the analysis report came out, revealing that the highest destruction still belonged to Will's unique ability. Dr. Smith referred to this ability as "mental manipulation," also categorized as a mutated ability, which both Laura and Jack concurred with.

Moreover, Will's ability proved to be highly unstable, a conclusion drawn after several tests and comparisons by Logan.

Seeing Dr. Smith’s enthusiastic demeanor, Laura encouraged him to continue his work, having already received plenty of surprises.

As they brought Logan back to the training ground, he normally wouldn’t need further training, but he still returned every day to refresh his metal abilities.

Reluctantly, Logan hooked his arm around Mike’s shoulder. Noticing his intentions, Jack said, "From now on, you’ll go out with my team. Do whatever you want."

Logan nearly jumped for joy at his idol's promise, unable to hide his excitement, even as Wendy shot him a few exasperated looks.

After Laura briefed Wendy, she addressed everyone, explaining that they would need to team up to hunt zombies during training, mixing the old with the new. The crystal cores they obtained could be used to enhance their abilities without needing to turn them in to the fortress.

Everyone cheered; they knew the awakening potion sold for a hefty price. Soon, the number of ability users would only increase, and their futures would hinge on their ability levels, making upgrades their top priority.

Jack's status had changed, and he could only reside in the outer housing of the fortress. He didn’t mind, but Zoe looked longingly at the old dorm building, wishing to cry at the thought of her warm and cozy room, hoping these troubling days would end soon.

Laura made a special trip around the exterior of the dormitory, curious to see if Little White Lotus truly no longer recognized her after they had spent so much time together.

Logan was equally reluctant to part with his idol so soon, insisting on following him to see Jack off. Wendy had grown accustomed to sticking to Laura and tagged along, leading the four of them—two boys and two girls—as they walked towards the dormitory. Along the way, they encountered many people who saluted and greeted Laura.

After about ten minutes, they still hadn’t reached the dorm area when they spotted Little White Lotus standing by the guard, her delicate figure swaying as she animatedly spoke to someone.

Little White Lotus had her back to them, gesturing vivaciously, her words dripping with a kind of affected charm. As they got closer, their expressions grew increasingly strange.

Wendy looked puzzled and frowning, Logan was curious, Laura was speechless, while Jack wore a neutral expression.

Hearing their footsteps, Little White Lotus turned around. Seeing Jack, whom she hadn’t seen all afternoon, she cheered and dashed towards him.

"Hey Jack, you're back!"
