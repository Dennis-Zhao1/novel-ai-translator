**Personnel Transfer**

After Lauren finished speaking, both she and Ethan were momentarily taken aback, especially her. She didn’t understand why those words had slipped out so spontaneously. Ethan nodded thoughtfully.

“It seems the rumors are true. Relationships among young people today can be quite complicated,” he remarked, his gaze toward her filled with an unspoken complexity, as if he had a lot to say but couldn’t find the words.

Lauren realized he misunderstood the situation but chose not to elaborate further. After all, Zoe was also his niece. She simply said, “That was just for show, a smokescreen.”

Ethan nodded again, appearing to grasp the situation—though he might not have fully understood. “Then I’ll take my leave. If I notice anything amiss, I’ll let you know.”

Lauren stood up and watched him exit, feeling a wave of annoyance wash over her. She tapped her forehead lightly, chastising herself for her thoughtless response. She promised herself to be more careful in the future.

She headed to the lab next, needing to confirm the details about the enhancement serum with Dr. Smith. They also needed to finalize the list for the second batch of awakened individuals and make arrangements as soon as possible.

While discussing the order of enhancements for the superhumans and awakenings for ordinary people, someone reported that the hole in the square was growing larger and that strange sounds could be heard emanating from it. Lauren immediately stood up, leading the group that was in the meeting to investigate.

Sure enough, the superhumans guarding the hole had expanded the security perimeter significantly; it was now about sixty feet wide. The area in the square wasn’t large, but if this rate of expansion continued, the entire fortress would soon be in jeopardy.

Lauren signaled for Alex to help her deploy a drone into the hole. Since mental energy couldn’t penetrate very deep, they hoped the drone might capture something useful.

After some adjustments, they attached a small flashlight to the drone, ensuring it wouldn’t affect its flight while still providing illumination. The buzzing sound of the drone gradually faded as it disappeared into the darkness of the hole. Lauren held the controller while Alex stood beside her, both intently watching the screen of her phone as the drone descended deeper into the abyss.

After a long while, they still hadn’t reached the bottom. Alex gasped as the tension in the air thickened. Lauren felt her palms begin to sweat; this was becoming a serious problem. If the hole collapsed, it could happen in an instant—the fortress was in danger.

They continued flying for a while longer, but the connection to the drone began to flicker, suggesting it was nearing its operational limit. Lauren quickly maneuvered the drone to hover, then cautiously inched closer to the hole. Alex hurriedly pulled her back, cautioning her to maintain a safe distance.

Fortunately, the drone was nearing the bottom, where the flashlight illuminated some details. Lauren noticed two horizontal tunnels in addition to the vertical shaft. Although they were smaller, their height definitely exceeded six feet. What were they for? A potential underground assault?

She carefully observed the orientation of the two horizontal tunnels and realized they didn’t connect to the main entrance. One of them appeared to lead directly toward the hydroelectric plant.

A fleeting thought crossed her mind, vanishing almost as quickly as it came; she needed to verify some details to confirm her suspicions. She slowly retracted the drone, then instructed everyone to disperse before taking Alex with her to the hydroelectric plant.

During their journey, Lauren chatted casually with Alex, appearing completely unfazed by the gravity of their situation. “Alex, if this big hole was created by the enemy, what do you think their intentions are?”

Alex shook his head, exasperated. He simply couldn’t fathom why they would dig such a large hole. “If they wanted to bring zombies in, they wouldn’t need to dig this shallow. It’s hard to believe the zombies could even climb up.”

“The hole is too deep. Unless they can fly, how would they get inside?” Lauren mused, her brow furrowing slightly. In her previous life, there hadn’t been any mutated animals yet, but what if they had discovered a way? Plants had mutated; it wasn’t impossible for animals to follow suit.

She pulled out her satellite phone and called Daniel, urging him to return with his team and prepare for battle. After hanging up, she and Alex arrived at the hydroelectric plant. Since the zombies had breached its defenses, security and patrols had tightened significantly. On the surface, everything seemed fine, but when they ordered the previous maintenance entry to be opened, Lauren’s hunch was proven right: the turbine blades were heavily entangled with vines, significantly reducing their rotational speed.

But what was the purpose of sabotaging the circuitry? They still had incineration power generation equipment, and the hydroelectric plant wasn’t crucial for their operations. Remembering the two large holes, she began to understand the enemy's intentions.

She instructed Alex to bring in fire and earth ability users to clear out the area. They couldn’t afford to sit idly by; they needed to quickly evacuate the ordinary people and researchers before all hell broke loose.

After delegating to Alex, Lauren notified Zoe, Jack, and the others to begin preparations for the move. Daniel had previously provided her with the address of their new location. They arranged for all ordinary people and researchers to board buses and leave, simultaneously packing up the lab’s equipment into a spatial storage.

Henry and Lucy were reluctant to leave, but Lauren reminded them that ordinary people and researchers needed the protection of superhumans, which finally persuaded them to depart. Jack led the group, taking them away while there was still daylight.

The superhumans understood that a fierce battle might be imminent. Even though they were loath to part with their families, rationality dictated that this was the best course of action.

The captain of the guard shared a final embrace with his child, and others exchanged bittersweet farewells with their loved ones.

Once everyone boarded the buses, Jack turned to Lauren. “Lauren, take care of yourself. I’ll escort them to safety and return immediately.”

“Don’t worry about me. Just take this; if anything happens, call Daniel. He’ll be back tonight,” she replied, handing him a device.

“Alright, I’m off then.”

Jack efficiently hopped into the bus, closed the door, and led the convoy out. Chloe was also leaving this time, accompanied by the housekeeper, Mrs. Green; at least she wouldn’t be alone.

As she watched them leave, Lauren gathered the remaining superhumans together.

“You all have seen the large pit in the square; it’s expanding rapidly, and we might face unpredictable events soon.”

“If anyone wants to leave, I won’t stop you. Those who stay will receive a free dose of the ability enhancement serum.”

Upon hearing this, a ripple of murmurs spread through the crowd but quickly subsided.

Ethan stood among them, his expression neutral as he carefully observed those around him. After this round of discussions, he had a better understanding of the situation.

“Tonight, our allies from Longview Base will join us to assist. Even if a fierce battle ensues, there’s no need to worry. As long as we stand united, victory will belong to us,” Lauren declared confidently.

Once she finished her speech, she instructed Jack to organize the duty roster and assign roles to the others. After the ordinary people working in the kitchen, like Mrs. Green, evacuated, the pressure of food supply fell squarely on Lauren.

This pressure was actually nonexistent; she had stockpiled a significant amount of business meal packages and various snacks, and there were plenty of food supplies ready. With no time to cook, she thought it would be better to have someone whip something up in the kitchen quickly. But after getting used to Mrs. Green’s cooking, she doubted whether anyone could stomach anything less delicious. Eating ready-made meals would be their best bet.
