**Drifting with the Current**

To pass the time, Ivy Parker returned to her homestead to tidy up the farm and collect eggs. She marveled at the large pile nestled in the hay and diligently gathered several stacks.

After finishing her chores, she stepped outside, only to find a group of people still lingering nearby.

"Hey, Sam, the mark's right here!"  
"Yeah, I see it. Let's check if we can find the folks around."  
"Got it."

Footsteps echoed, and Ivy's senses heightened. There were at least ten people in that group. Could it be someone sent to pick her up? Something felt off about the scene.

"Sam, over here!"  
The excitement in the voice was unusual, prompting Ivy to curiously peer out the window.

There stood a blonde-haired guy with an air of mischief, gesturing to his leader in the open space in front of the farmhouse.

Suddenly, the sounds of kicking doors and shouts erupted, and Ivy's instincts screamed danger. This was no friendly pick-up; it looked like a kidnapping.

She saw three women tied up with ropes, discarded near the door.

The blonde-haired thug pinched the face of one of the bound women and said to his leader, "Sam, these three are lookers. The boss will be pleased!"  
"Yeah, they are pretty good. Let's hurry and get them out of here."

Bending down, the leader inspected the women closely, oblivious to Ivy's presence.  
"And what about these three guys?" he asked, pointing to three young men pressed against the wall by other thugs.

"Do we need to ask? Just follow the protocol."  
"No! What are you planning to do? Don’t hurt my brother, Lance!"  

Sarah, one of the captives, made another attempt to protest, trying to rise and shove the thug holding her down, causing a commotion.

At that moment, someone kicked open the door to Ivy's room. She chided herself for being too engrossed in the drama outside to notice the chaos unfolding and that someone would be searching the place.

As soon as their eyes met, Ivy hadn’t even had time to reach for her phone before the thug shouted, "Sam, there’s another pretty girl here!"

Ivy quickly tucked her phone back into her pocket. She only had limited options, and it would be tough to call for help without drawing attention. Maybe she should have used a different strategy; she had some experience from her encounter with Jordan in a similar situation. It felt quite satisfying at the time.

The leader, Sam, approached, and upon seeing his face, Ivy was surprised. Wasn’t this the same delivery guy, Luke, from before everything went south?

What luck! She might just have caught a break.

As the attention shifted, Lance and the twins seized the opportunity to kick down the thug holding them and make a break for it.

The three bound women, initially sobbing, joined the fray and fled. The thugs quickly reacted, and chaos ensued, with some chasing after the escapees while others ran after the captured women.

"Sam! Those three got away!" the blonde-haired thug reported, panting.

Sam looked at Ivy, taking in her stunning features—her clear skin, bright eyes, and that unique charm caught between womanhood and girlhood. His gaze flickered before he barked, "Let them go; as long as we have a woman, it’s fine. Tie her up and take her back."

Feigning fear, Ivy acted compliant, as if she was in shock. The thug tying her up found it odd; he had never encountered someone so cooperative in a kidnapping.

The group arrived in modified vans, and Ivy, along with Sarah and the others, was shoved into one. The so-called modifications involved removing all the seats except the driver and passenger, turning it into a makeshift cargo van, which was common for transporting goods.

Finding a corner to huddle in, Ivy adjusted herself into a more comfortable position, maintaining her terrified facade while plotting her next moves once she infiltrated the enemy’s ranks.

Clearly, this was all about Jack Donovan's shady dealings. What were they planning to do with the women they captured? Was it human trafficking or perhaps something even more sinister?

During her sheltered life, she had only seen the facade created by the Donovan family, unaware of the darkest and cruelest realities lurking beneath the surface.

Now that she had personally experienced that dark side, she felt awakened. With the Donovan family’s infamous reputation, her suspicions were credible, and she was determined to see it for herself.

This was just the beginning; this group had been running around the area all day, gathering a van full of women, all young and attractive.

Ivy witnessed firsthand how the women who resisted were beaten and how the men who fought back were killed. This so-called safe haven after the disaster was nothing more than a facade, a cover for bloodsucking schemes and murder.

Surrounded by sobbing women, Ivy felt a twinge of helplessness. What good was crying? 

No one was going to hand out free meals; if she wanted to survive, she had to figure out a way to save herself.

Beside her, the elegant older sister remained expressionless. Ivy didn’t care to speculate on the thoughts of others, focusing solely on infiltrating the base. Her excitement was bubbling up; she was eagerly anticipating what lay ahead.

Their supplies and backpacks had been confiscated before getting in the van, but fortunately, Ivy’s bag held nothing of value—just some bread meant for show and nearly empty water bottles.

Though her supplies were scant, it didn’t prevent her from feeling displeasure at the sight of the blonde-haired thug munching on her bread.

Sitting in the passenger seat, he acted all cocky and arrogant, rummaging through the bags piled at his feet, eating whatever he found. To her surprise, he stumbled upon a gun hidden in one of the bags.

He jumped back in shock, nearly hitting the roof of the van if not for his seatbelt. After a shaky moment, he opened the gun's magazine and, finding it empty, relaxed.

He turned to the group of women, still tightly bound and crying pitifully, and waved the gun, asking, "Whose is this?"

No one answered. He raised his voice, "Speak up! Whose is it?"

Finally, the women fell silent, their tear-filled eyes darting among each other.

Ivy had a good idea whose it was, glancing at the elegant older sister, who kept her head down, lips pressed tight, not saying a word.

"Fine, if you won’t say, just remember, when we get to the base, don’t regret it," he warned.

Ivy rolled her eyes inwardly, thinking, "When we get to the base, who will be regretting what? You’re going to regret messing with my bread."

She tried not to show it too obviously, putting on a pitiful expression as she buried her face into her knees.

On the way back, Ivy discreetly memorized the route. She recognized this villa area, named after the largest natural maple forest in the state. In autumn, the hills would be ablaze with colorful leaves, a picturesque sight.

Jack Donovan had a knack for picking locations; he truly insulted the beauty of this place by making it his lair.

The winter air felt sharp and brisk, even the maple villa area seemed barren—one word: bleak.

Ivy noted the reality of the situation. Whether the scenery was beautiful or not was irrelevant. If it came down to it, she’d destroy the place; the stockpiled explosives were meant for this very purpose.
