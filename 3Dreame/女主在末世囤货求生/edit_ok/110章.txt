**Collaboration Achieved**

At this moment, Alex had also gotten out of his single bed, rubbing his tired eyes and muttering, “What’s up with Jake?”

Mike and two other team members were already fully dressed, staring intently at Jake Hudson.

Lori could hear the sounds of fighting intensifying from downstairs, mixed with the horrifying cries of zombies, causing her to furrow her brow. “Just now, Anna mentioned that there are traitors at Longview Base. We need to stay cautious and check out the situation.”

Seeing everyone nod in agreement, Lori continued, “It’s not just internal conflict; zombies might be involved too. It could turn into a chaotic battle. Everyone, pay attention and observe the situation first before we act.”

The group responded in unison, and as they pushed the door open, Alex was energized by the unfolding events, eagerly rushing to see the commotion.

Fear was not an option. Anyone who had faced a horde of thousands of zombies wouldn’t easily be shaken—this was just a minor skirmish.

People from Longview Base were rushing down the stairs, and Lori and her companions had to step aside multiple times to let them pass. In comparison, they seemed overly calm.

As the group reached the glass doors beside the lobby, the searchlights from Longview Base activated, illuminating a distance of about four hundred yards from the lobby entrance. The Longview Building had once been a bustling commercial office, with a large plaza and lawn at the entrance but no underground parking. Everything was planned on the sides, and their vehicles were parked within a walled-off area, creating a first line of defense in this apocalyptic world.

The main entrance was shared by both vehicles and pedestrians, but the barrier had been transformed into a sliding iron gate. Outside, numerous sandbags and iron spikes had been set up to block zombies. It looked chaotic, but the defense was effective.

A rundown cargo van was parked at the entrance, appearing quite shabby, as if it intended to force its way through. Peter stood among the empowered individuals from Longview. Aside from the searchlights and headlights, there was no other illumination. Some of the empowered members were already outside, clearing away zombies attracted by the light.

Lori noticed Peter’s expression, a mix of anger and restraint, his eyes cold and fixed on the van. The empowered individuals around him were attacking the van but seemed hesitant, not daring to go all out.

Under normal circumstances, a van would be no match for empowered individuals, especially with so many present. Earth-type abilities were digging trenches to prevent the vehicle from moving, while plant-type powers were attempting to pull the van's doors open with vines.

Other empowered individuals were hesitant to unleash fireballs, but those inside the van were merciless in their counterattacks, putting Longview Base at a disadvantage.

It was evident that someone or something crucial to Peter or Longview Base was inside the van, leaving them as confused bystanders.

Alex excitedly exclaimed, “Did you see that? The empowered individuals in that van look strong too. The earth-type is digging pits, and the other side is fighting back. The van is about to break through—why isn’t the boss of Longview making a move?”

No one replied; in this tense situation, they awaited Peter's decision, wondering if he was indeed the super strong powerhouse that Jake Hudson had described.

As the van was pulled and tugged by various abilities, its front was nearing the tightly shut main gate. If they could break the wood-type vines, the van could speed away.

Lori fixed her gaze on Peter, still not seeing him take any action.

Suddenly, a stocky man behind Peter leaped onto the van's roof, ripping it open with a violent display of strength. He was a metal-type empowered individual, and his method was brutally effective. The driver was yanked out and thrown aside. Two other metal-type individuals rushed to the driver’s seat and passenger seat, tearing off the doors and dragging the occupants out to throw them at Peter’s feet.

The plant-type empowered individuals swiftly restrained their opponents, hoisting them up for a beating. Only then did everyone see that there were four ordinary-looking individuals inside, their faces pale and expressions panicked. They were terrified by the brutality of Longview Base's members, and one of them even coughed up a mouthful of blood from the beating.

At this moment, Jake, seemingly relaxed, began to introduce the names of these individuals, explaining that the man who had just acted violently was named Lee, a former known small-time boss from the underworld, and Peter’s childhood friend. After Peter had cleaned up his act, Lee had followed suit, assisting him ever since.

Jake provided a brief overview of the other empowered members, but Lori noted that none of them seemed to be friends from Jake's previous life.

The back doors of the van were quickly pried open and thrown to the ground by the metal-type individuals. With the light of the flashlight, everyone could see that inside the cargo area lay a stretcher with a person on it—someone with very pale skin, their features obscured, lying silently without even a covering.

Peter ordered his men to take the traitors away and personally carried the individual on the stretcher toward the office building, moving swiftly yet carefully, as if afraid to jostle the person in his arms.

In those hurried moments, Lori caught a glimpse of the face Peter cradled—delicate, cold, and fragile, as if completely devoid of vitality. The person's eyes remained closed, leaving her uncertain whether they were asleep or unconscious.

Peter's expression was grave, and no one dared to speak. They silently watched as he and his group ascended the stairs.

At this point, the metal-type empowered individual named Lee invited Lori and Jake upstairs, saying Peter needed to discuss something with them.

The two instructed Mike and the others to rest and followed Lee upstairs.

On the 11th floor, they entered a makeshift medical room that had been converted from an office. The remnants of chaos from earlier were still evident—bloodstains on the walls, shards of glass on the floor, and scattered medical supplies and instruments that had yet to be cleaned up. Peter ignored the mess and strode directly to place the person back onto a relatively clean bed.

The medical room was far from sterile now, as doctors and nurses surrounded the patient, hastily connecting them to a ventilator and various monitoring devices, working with a fervor that made it seem like they needed eight hands.

Lori and Jake stood outside the room, observing the disarray within, unsure of why Peter had called them up.

After the doctors and nurses finished their tasks and checked the data for a while, one turned to Peter and said, “The condition is stable for now; they don’t need to stay in the sterile room. Most of the data is back to normal, but the blood oxygen level is a bit low. We’ll need to keep monitoring it, but the special medicine cannot be interrupted. If we don’t administer it today, after going through this, I fear they would…”

The doctor’s unfinished sentence was understood by everyone present. Upon hearing this, Peter’s icy gaze deepened, and his entire aura darkened even further. Lori couldn’t help but shudder at the thought that he might be gearing up for a dramatic turn.

However, Peter didn’t dwell in that emotion for long. He quickly reined in his intensity and turned to Lori and Jake, leading them into the adjacent room. Once the door was closed, he spoke seriously.

“Today’s incident was orchestrated by Frank. He bribed and incited my subordinates to abduct someone as leverage against me. Ha! Does he think I, Peter, am easy to manipulate? I don’t care how you plan to deal with him, but he must not leave here alive.”

It turned out that when Lori and her group arrived at Longview Base that afternoon, Frank had already received word, intentionally misleading Anna to provoke them into conflict and sabotage their cooperation. Unexpectedly, once Anna recognized Jake and realized it was a misunderstanding, Frank resorted to plan B—buying off several empowered individuals from Longview Base to kidnap Peter’s most important person in exchange for control over the base.

That evening, Anna led a team to capture them, but Frank had been well-prepared, fleeing at the first hint of trouble and leaving behind a ticking time bomb. Fortunately, they managed to discover and stop it in time; otherwise, who knew what might have happened.

Lori fell silent. Initially, Longview Base had maintained a neutral and somewhat ambiguous stance, sending out signals that leaned more towards Frank. Today, however, Frank’s actions had turned potential allies into enemies. Peter looked like he could hardly wait to skin him alive—Frank had played a dangerous game and had done it beautifully.

Quickly suppressing the smirk that threatened to rise on her lips, Lori spoke up, “Boss Peter, you’re being too polite. Our goals align; why don’t we collaborate to take him down? It would be disastrous if we didn’t communicate properly and ended up hurting our own people.”

Peter nodded, then asked, “Do we have any of the special medicine left? My sister urgently needs it.”

Lori replied, “No problem. If you need it, I can provide it. Since we’re partners, this is easy to arrange.”

The two parties happily reached an agreement. Meanwhile, they remained oblivious to the pair of dark, hollow eyes watching them from a rooftop not far from Longview Building.
