**Revenge is a Dish Best Served Cold**

The moment Ivy spotted him, memories from her past came flooding back—a deluge of pain and humiliation replaying in her mind's eye. Even without Ethan’s urging, she would have confronted him on sight, for he was among those she vowed to face in this life.

He was the man who had tormented her without reason, deceived her love, and shattered her trust.

Rage flared in her eyes as her mind sharpened, ready for the confrontation.

Ethan had been watching the chaotic scene unfold and quickly noticed that Jake’s side was faltering, with many teammates injured and a relentless force bearing down on them.

He motioned to redistribute their efforts, but before he could speak, several gunshots pierced the air. Ivy decisively fired, instantly taking down a few adversaries, throwing them into confusion.

Someone shouted, “Jake, it’s confirmed you’ve been scheming with outsiders and betraying us from within. Today, you won’t escape!”

The arrogant declaration only fueled Ivy’s fury, her anger searing her very soul. She imagined countless ways to bring him down, each more excruciating than the last, leaving him begging for mercy.

She fired two more shots toward the taunting voice, pulling the trigger even after her handgun ran empty, her finger mechanically squeezing the trigger.

The opposing side was clearly unsettled by her unexpected attack, their fire momentarily weakening.

Understanding Ivy’s unusual fervor, Ethan seized the momentary lull and pulled her toward Jake’s cover.

They ran while returning fire, providing cover. Ethan called her name several times, trying to break through her rage.

Unaware of how deeply her old wounds ran, Ivy’s eyes were bloodshot, her movements robotic as she reloaded and shot back.

Ethan, though puzzled by her intensity, admired her cold focus and precise shooting. He decided to let her be while he checked on Jake’s situation.

At first glance, Jake seemed fine, although a few of his teammates bore wounds of varying severity. Ethan realized his bag was still in the truck, now engulfed in flames from the explosion, leaving them with nothing.

Once Ivy emptied her magazine, the burning sensation in her chest eased slightly. She turned to see Ethan scratching his head in frustration, unsure of how to proceed. Without hesitation, she yanked her backpack off her shoulders and clutched it tightly, rummaging through it for medical supplies and equipment.

Ethan knew she was meticulous, always packing a large bag full of items for their missions—medications, weapons, and even extra snacks. Little did he know that the backpack was just a facade, its hard outline hiding a spatial storage that allowed her to retrieve what she truly needed instantly.

When she pulled out adrenaline syringes, Jake’s usually stoic face cracked, surprise flickering across his features.

Ethan took the syringe and swiftly injected it into the arm of the most critically injured teammate, whose face had turned ashen. The lab-produced syringe was user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to administer.

They had plenty of useful items, and as Jake watched, he yanked off his empty magazine and replaced it with a new one from his pocket.

With someone aiding his teammates, he needed to capitalize on this opportunity to create some time for them.

Jake darted to a different cover, unleashing a hail of bullets at the opposing side while drawing their fire. “Dave, you traitor! You schemed with outsiders, betraying the base and causing Captain Stone’s downfall. And now that I’ve uncovered your treachery, you want to silence me? Are you that afraid?”

Without waiting for a reply, he fired again. “Your father is a hypocrite, and you’re no better! You think I don’t have evidence? If you can’t take me down today, tomorrow the base will see undeniable proof of your betrayal!”

“Get him! Whoever takes him out gets a promotion and 500 points!”

Dave’s face was a mask of cold fury as he roared, “Silence him! We must eliminate Jake today! Follow my orders—taking him down will promote you three ranks and earn you 2000 points!”

Ivy felt a sense of camaraderie as she agreed with Jake’s accusations; the enemy of her enemy was her friend. She felt slightly better about that despicable man.

She swiftly bandaged Jake’s teammates. Fortunately, their injuries were mostly superficial. The most severe wounds had been stabilized with adrenaline, and the bleeding was under control.

Ivy snatched an AK47 from an injured soldier, unconcerned by its empty magazine. She ducked and dashed toward a nearby cover, reloading as she ran.

As the gunfire intensified, she found herself pinned down behind cover, unable to pop her head out. The pressure mounted as she witnessed Jake braving the bullets, making her heart race.

He was insane, she thought, observing his chiseled profile, cold as ice, radiating a deadly allure.

Perfect. They had a common enemy, and it was time to fight together.

With determination, Ivy gestured to Jake, and he responded with a nod, their coordination seamless as if they had trained together for years.

They moved forward, covering each other with suppressive fire. Ivy seized the moment to use her mental acuity to pinpoint Dave’s position, firing a few shots in quick succession.

“Ah…” a scream echoed, but she couldn’t tell if she had hit the coward.

“Cover me, hurry!”

Now certain it wasn't Dave who had been shot—he sounded too confident—Ivy didn’t dwell on it. The enemy unleashed a barrage, and the two of them were barely holding on.

Finding another cover, she vented her frustration, “I shot a whole magazine at him, but I couldn’t hit the target! That coward just hides behind others!”

“He’s that type of person—sycophantic and treacherous,” Jake replied, changing magazines with practiced ease as he inquired, “Do you have a grudge against him too?”

“Can’t I just dislike him? He blew up my car! And you’re partly to blame for this mess!”

Ivy couldn’t reveal her past grievances, so she made up an excuse, wrinkling her nose in annoyance.

Jake was left speechless; it was a fair point, but all of this had been a series of unfortunate coincidences.

Seizing the moment, Ivy pressed on, “This chaos is all on you. We saved you and your teammates, so you owe me one.”

Jake hadn’t anticipated this turn of events and nodded slowly. “Alright, then I owe you one. But remember, you agreed to it. When I ask, you have to comply.”

“What do you want?”

Realizing this could likely backfire, he quickly asked, “What do you want?”

“Nothing comes to mind right now. Let’s deal with that coward first. Just remember, you owe me one.”

With a lull in the gunfire, Ivy rolled to a shady corner of the street, signaling to Jake again.

He tightened his grip on the trigger, poking his head out to cover her as she dashed toward the side of a building, climbing the stairs.

Jake couldn’t help but think that this girl was quite interesting; she always surprised him whenever they met. They could indeed cooperate against a common enemy, he mused.

His thoughts mirrored Ivy's perspective.

Reaching the rooftop, she retrieved a sniper rifle from her spatial storage. It was clear that a rifle was ill-suited for high-altitude shooting, but she had plenty of weapons at her disposal, including a rocket launcher.

Fortunately, the area had been cleared of zombies before, but with all this noise, they needed to wrap things up quickly or risk being swarmed.

On Dave’s side, they were also feeling the pressure. Their ammunition was running low, and they had lost several men without managing to kill Jake. Meanwhile, they were being picked off by the enemy’s reinforcements.

“Dave, our ammo is almost gone, and we’ve lost too many brothers. Should we let it go for today?”

“Yeah, the zombies are closing in. It’s like Jake has an endless supply of bullets, even though we’re all supposed to have the same ammo supply for these missions,” a puzzled squad leader chimed in.

Dave wanted to retreat, but he feared the implications of what Jake had just said. He couldn’t imagine how the base commander would react if he saw the evidence of his betrayal—he couldn’t afford that risk.

“Shut up! We must kill Jake today. Listen to me—killing him will promote you three ranks and earn you 2000 points.”

His frenzied roar was a clear indication of a cornered rat. It was evident to anyone watching that he was desperate and panicking.

With a tempting reward on the table, some reckless individuals began shooting wildly, leading to an even more intense exchange of fire. Ivy worried whether Jake could hold on.

After climbing six flights of stairs, Ivy stood on the rooftop terrace. She pulled out her sniper rifle, loaded it, and adjusted her four-times scope.

Taking a deep breath, she found the right angle, aimed, and smoothly pulled the trigger.

“Ugh, without practice, my shooting skills have really gone downhill,” she muttered, watching Dave go down, clutching his chest. She had aimed for his head.

As she chambered another round, Dave’s nearby men quickly moved to carry him away.

Through her scope, she could see nothing but a flurry of moving bodies, making it hard to target Dave again.

Ivy wanted to fire a few more shots, hoping for some luck, but she spotted a horde of zombies approaching in the distance. Time was running out.

With urgency, she fired one last shot, not caring where it landed, and quickly headed down the stairs. Their vehicle had been destroyed; they needed to find transportation…

The thought only stoked her anger further.
