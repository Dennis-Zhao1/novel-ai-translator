**The Truth**

Ethan grabbed Alex's collar, pulling him down to face the screen like a ragged doll. He forced Alex's gaze onto the flickering images displayed, shouting furiously, "You've really lost touch with your humanity! Look at the destruction you've caused—people are homeless, innocent lives are lost for nothing! And what do you have left? Just a pathetic joke!"

Alex struggled to move, his limbs feeling heavy, yet his eyes remained fixed on the screen. Some of the chaos had been orchestrated by him, but not all. Lucy watched as Alex, in pursuit of a baseless dream, unleashed a virus that nearly wiped out humanity. To seize control of the base, he had sacrificed his wife and father-in-law. He had repeatedly released chaos for his so-called fortune, coercing scientists to create mutated creatures.

Yet, he was nothing but a complete fool, bound to a system that didn’t aim to help him succeed but instead used him to absorb all the fortunes of this world. The ultimate goal was to turn all of humanity into mindless beings, mere vessels for generating energy, to be harvested and discarded in one fell swoop. It seemed that Earth wouldn’t be the first nor the last.

The spectral voice was unusually enraged, as if attacking that doomsday system.

"Alex, open your eyes! If this were before the apocalypse, reliant on your wife and father-in-law, you would've struggled for at least two decades less. In the end, regardless of power, status, reputation, or wealth, you'd have something. Given your family's business situation back then, it wouldn't be that bad. And now? It’s the apocalypse! What do you have, besides this deceptive system that treats you as a tool? You've lost your home, your son is dead, and you're left as a shadow of a person, dreaming of becoming the king of the world? With everyone dead, who are you supposed to rule? The King of Nothing?"

Lucy reflected on Alex's past actions, struggling to understand why he had made such choices. Now she realized he was not only foolish but naive, believing he could rise above everyone else, forgetting that if the system possessed such great power, it wouldn’t need to bind him.

“Take a good look at the sins you’ve committed before you die. You don’t deserve a peaceful end.”

With this parting remark, Lucy signaled for Ethan to secure Alex, stuffing a makeshift gag into his mouth to prevent him from biting his tongue in despair. There were many who wished to take revenge on Alex, and she didn't want him to die so easily.

“Sam, we’re heading out now. Mike and the others are still waiting for us outside.”

After exchanging pleasantries, Lucy took hold of Ethan’s arm while he dragged Alex behind him, the three of them appearing in the aerial garden where they had previously stood.

At this point, the wind had scattered the gray remnants of the mutated plants and insects on the ground, leaving the garden desolate with only patches of bare soil visible.

“Lucy, Ethan, are you all okay?” 

Mike hurried toward them, visibly relieved once he confirmed that Lucy was unharmed.

“Mike, how are you holding up? You seem pretty beat; you shouldn’t be moving around so vigorously,” she remarked with concern.

“I’m fine. Just a moment ago, the mutated creatures attacking us suddenly turned to ash. I thought I was dreaming.”

“Lucy, Lucy!” 

The others who followed Mike all called out to her, their faces as pale as his, indicating they had endured their own share of suffering.

“Lucy, have you seen the others?” Mike suddenly inquired, making Lucy pause.

“They're all fine, in a safe place. Once we go down, we’ll see them,” she replied, choosing not to mention that they were all inside her protected area. Cramming so many people into her space felt a bit exaggerated, and she didn’t want to explain it all.

“Prepare yourselves. There’s nothing extra in here, so we’ll get ready to return to the fortress. And this is the biggest sinner of the apocalypse, Alex. Keep an eye on him; don’t let him die easily.”

Mike nodded, taking the rope-bound Alex from Ethan and splitting off with John and the others to clear out the remaining dangers lurking in the area.

“Hey, there's a surprise waiting for you,” Ethan called out to Lucy, but the spectral voice refused to elaborate, leaving both of them in suspense. Moments later, Lucy felt her body begin to glow, but there was no discomfort—just a sense of the extraordinary. A tall figure clad in a flowing robe, with dark hair, appeared before them.

Ethan felt overwhelmed by the spectral voice’s ecstatic screams, nearly causing his ears to ring.

“Ah! Ah! Ah! The figure has materialized! He absorbed the energy from that destructive system! Wow, isn't that super cool?”

“Quiet down; you’re too loud!” 

Ethan could no longer tolerate it and disabled the voice function, plunging the world back into silence.

Lucy gazed at the figure before her, gradually solidifying from a thin silhouette to a tangible presence, her shock rendering her speechless.

“Is that really you?” 

Seeing Lucy’s astonished expression, Ethan felt a pang of jealousy, questioning why he had been staring for so long. Was this figure really that captivating? He admitted that the figure had a striking appearance that could rival his own. But didn’t Lucy disregard her own looks? Surely she wouldn’t think much of the figure either. Yet the reality contradicted his assumptions, stirring frustration within him.

“Lucy, hello there.”

The figure’s long hair and flowing sleeves danced with the wind, embodying an ethereal grace.

“Y-you… hello?” 

Lucy stuttered, unsure how to respond, when suddenly a thought struck her. 

“I’ve seen your portrait somewhere before. Could it be that you’re an ancestor?”

Perhaps influenced by her past life’s dramas, she imagined a scene where her ancestor manifested to bless her descendants.

“I remember now; there’s a painting of you in our ancient texts.”

The figure smiled and nodded. 

“I’ve completed my task. Having absorbed enough energy, I can return to my rightful time. I’m here to say goodbye.”

“You’re leaving? Where to?” 

“To go home.”

The figure didn’t elaborate further, and Lucy felt a pang of disappointment as she nodded slowly. Memories flooded back to when she first discovered the space and began communicating with him, gradually growing familiar with him, appreciating his help as he accompanied her through her growth up to this point.

“Then… will we have the chance to meet again?”

Lucy wasn’t one to relish farewells. While she seemed surrounded by many, few truly held a place in her heart. Although the figure hadn’t been a person in the traditional sense, he meant a lot to her.

“We will, there will be opportunities to meet again.”

The figure maintained his gentle smile, a complex yet serene expression in his eyes, looking at her as if she were both a friend and a younger sibling.

Feeling the warmth of that affectionate gaze, Ethan’s jealousy subsided, replaced by a surge of strength and courage. He stepped forward, taking Lucy’s hand in his own.
