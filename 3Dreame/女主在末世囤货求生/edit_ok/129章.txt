**Not Living Off Others**

Ethan never imagined he'd find himself entangled in matters here. He raised an eyebrow at Zoe, who was glaring at him with a gaze reminiscent of a certain girl he knew—one who loved to give him the same piercing look. A smile involuntarily crept across his face.

Emma, thinking the smile was meant for her, beamed even brighter.

Turning to Peter, Ethan said, "Since everything's confirmed, I'll arrange things on my end and get back to you, Peter."

He completely ignored Emma. At his words, Peter nodded with a warm smile, "Alright. Get some rest, and we’ll catch up over dinner tonight."

Ethan nodded and followed Anna out, leaving Emma staring after him with a sulky expression, twisting her clothes in frustration.

Peter headed upstairs, internally sighing, "I’ve got to smooth things over with that spirited little troublemaker."

Next to Emma, a hot-headed young man mumbled angrily, though he kept his voice low. "These people, just because they have power and influence, think they're above everyone else."

Emma found him as annoying as a buzzing fly. Yet, she maintained her gentle and innocent persona, lowering her head to appear pitiful and lost, which only made her more endearing.

"Thanks for sticking up for me, big brother. Otherwise…"

Though cliché, these unfinished sentences worked. The young man's imagination ran wild as he looked at Emma's tear-filled eyes, feeling an overwhelming sense of sympathy.

"You're so kind. You don’t need to take risks for me. They're people we can't afford to cross, and we don’t even know their true power. Being looked down upon just reflects our own shortcomings."

The boy, having received the "good guy card," felt conflicted. He was just an ordinary person with nothing but passion and no abilities. He always envied those with powers, even if they were less talented than him, yet held much higher status.

"Hey, don't be so down. If we had powers too, we'd definitely not be looked down upon. We just lack a bit of luck."

He tried to comfort Emma, but unexpectedly, she responded softly, "It's not just luck we lack. It's power and connections."

The young man, confused, asked, "What does that have to do with power and connections?"

Emma looked at him innocently. "Did you not know? Before I came to the base, I heard that the Apocalypse Fortress developed a potion that can awaken abilities. With this potion, ordinary people can gain powers, even stronger than those who awaken naturally."

Her words were soft but hit him like a thunderbolt, leaving him speechless for a moment.

"Really? Is that true? It can't just be a rumor, right? They talked about a zombie antidote before, but we haven't seen it yet."

Emma internally scoffed, thinking, You naive boy only knows how to follow women; what do you understand?

On the surface, she maintained a look of doubt and innocence. "It's true! The people from the Apocalypse Fortress said the antidote was developed long ago. It's not fake news!"

Filled with excitement, the young man considered heading to the Apocalypse Fortress. He had dreamed of gaining abilities and was fed up with his life at Longhorn Base. His cousin, an ability user, often looked down on him. If he became an ability user himself and surpassed his cousin, he could regain his dignity.

"Why didn’t you go to the Apocalypse Fortress? If you did, you'd become an ability user!"

Emma, or rather, Lily, rolled her eyes internally but showed a helpless smile. "I don’t even know where the Apocalypse Fortress is! Besides, as an ordinary person, how could I possibly get there? I only came to Longhorn because of my cousin. I’m just not fortunate enough to enter such a good place."

With a few exaggerated sniffles, she expressed her sorrow. "If you hear anything about the Apocalypse Fortress, please let me know."

After smiling at him, she didn’t wait for an answer and hurried down the stairs.

Zoe had been following Ethan and the others into the suite arranged for them, the same room that Lucas and his group had stayed in last time.

"Hey, Captain Ethan, how many days are we staying here? When can we go back to the fortress and get a good night's sleep? I miss Lucas already."

Ethan didn’t reply immediately, deep in conversation with the Chattering Ghost in his mind. It had finally become somewhat useful after leveling up four times. Not only had it exchanged for a satellite phone, but it also obtained energy blocks that could enhance his abilities. Ethan's abilities had now reached the fifth tier, enabling him to paralyze and destroy crystal cores with lightning.

"Host, if you hadn’t leveled up so slowly, I could have shown off long ago. Fortunately, I'm finally at tier four now. Let me show you the good stuff from our Y Galaxy!"

While the Chattering Ghost was boasting, Ethan had already opened the system store. Previously greyed-out weapons and equipment icons lit up, along with various functional energy blocks. Looking at the long list of zeros next to all the items, Ethan felt like he wanted to scream.

Was this inspired by Zimbabwean currency before the apocalypse? The cheapest item was an energy recovery ball with no attributes, similar in effect to a basic crystal core. It couldn’t enhance abilities, only restore energy, and the recovery amount was limited—talk about poor value compared to a basic crystal core.

He considered uninstalling the system. The Chattering Ghost, who had been rambling on about its own greatness, suddenly caught wind of this thought and went pale.

Whether to bind with this host didn’t matter much to it, but if it got uninstalled, where would it find another host allowed to enter Lucas's space again? It wanted to continue having fun with Brother Xander. The space had all the air and water it loved; it couldn’t be uninstalled!

As the incessant chatter suddenly ceased, the quiet was almost eerie. Ethan was taken aback; he hadn’t realized how accustomed he had become to the Chattering Ghost’s incessant noise.

"Host, please don’t entertain such dangerous thoughts! We’ve come this far. You're about to rise to greatness; don’t you think it would be a shame to just give up now?"

The Chattering Ghost’s voice trembled slightly, almost sounding like it was on the verge of tears. Ethan was stunned.

"Sure, the points seem high, but our exchange rate is also steep. Just take a look at the exchange interface and see what you can get."

Ethan opened the exchange interface and was shocked. Aside from normal crystal cores, the system also had clean air and water available for exchange. Was it really that simple?

The exchange rate was far higher than the price of crystal cores. He couldn’t help but ask, "Chattering Ghost, what's the standard for this clean air and water?"

Hearing a glimmer of hope, the Chattering Ghost quickly replied, "It’s just like the air and water in the little fairy’s space! Boo hoo, I miss those days in the space. I miss my Brother Xander!"

"Can’t you just ask for something I can actually get?"

"You should have listened to me and clung to the little fairy’s leg! You insisted on going out to fight for yourself. Tsk, if you had listened to me, you could have simply exchanged for everything you wanted while lying down!"

Ethan was left speechless, thinking, What is this? Is it trying to force me to live off others?
