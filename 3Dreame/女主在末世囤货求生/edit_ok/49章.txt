**Reunion with Old Friends**

Ivy Bennett had built up her physical strength through rigorous training sessions, and it was paying off. Her friend, Mark Gray, had been relentless during their workouts, pushing them to their limits. Today, she felt only a slight ache in her wrists.

What surprised her was Alex Mason. Back at their old hangout in Chicago, he seemed more like the laid-back type. But as they fought side by side, Ivy realized Alex had impressive endurance. He later explained that his skills dated back to when he was a kid, swinging a hammer in his dad's workshop. All those years of practice had honed his physique.

After dealing with a few more zombies, they secured a conference room and took a moment to breathe. These zombies, having just mutated, moved slowly, but Ivy knew they’d need to up their game soon.

After a brief rest, they resumed their mission to clear the floor and look for survivors. The seventeenth floor was now free of zombies, but there were no signs of Uncle Joe or the young women they were hoping to find.

“Where could they be?” Ivy wondered aloud, puzzled. Uncle Joe’s lead had seemed solid.

They took a moment to gather their thoughts. Ivy was sure they were in the right place; the company's name and the location matched. But where was everyone?

Determined to find answers, she headed to the reception desk and picked up a pamphlet about a biotech company. The brochure confirmed the company was indeed on the seventeenth floor, with an underground lab on the second basement level.

“They might all be in the basement,” she suggested to her team, who nodded in agreement. They had to check it out.

Once everyone was ready, they headed for the lower levels. Ivy took the brochure with her; the management office had only given her a floor plan for the seventeenth floor, nothing about the basement.

Every unknown held potential danger. Even if the zombies were slow now, who knew what awaited below? Ivy decided to face whatever came head-on. She had come too far to turn back empty-handed.

Descending the stairs was faster than climbing. The building's soundproofing was impressive; they could hear the zombies above, but their own noise didn’t seem to draw attention. Maybe the zombies' hearing was still developing, which was a relief—it made their mission a bit easier.

They reached the first floor quickly. Ivy checked the fire door she had locked earlier. The atmosphere was different here; the stairwell opened into darkness. Safety first, she thought.

Mark held the flashlight, while Alex took charge of lighting the way ahead. Ivy focused on using her instincts to sense any nearby zombies. The first underground level was a parking garage, vast and difficult to monitor completely. So far, the stairwell area seemed clear.

They stayed cautious, quickly crossing the garage to find the way to the second basement.

The fire escape only led to the first basement; they had no clue where the entrance to the second basement was.

Ivy felt a growing anxiety. It made sense that the parking lot and the lab wouldn’t share an entrance—the lab was too important for that.

Mark advised sticking close to the walls, using the still-glowing emergency exit signs to guide them.

Following Mark, they reached the parking lot exit. The guard booth was empty, and there were no zombies, but the lot was full of cars, likely belonging to the employees.

Disappointment hit Ivy as they failed to find the lab’s entrance. It didn’t make sense for employees to access the lab through the parking lot exit. Surely there were elevators or staircases? What detail were they missing?

As she pondered, Mark suddenly stopped, turned off his flashlight, and signaled for everyone to crouch and hide.

As they concealed themselves in the shadows, they heard hurried footsteps. Ivy peeked through a car window and saw a man in tactical gear, holding a handgun, followed by three women using their phones as flashlights, one wearing a striking red dress. Behind them were four men in suits and four more armed individuals.

“Military? Special forces?” Ivy thought, choosing to stay hidden and not interfere.

Fate had other plans. The leader headed toward their hiding spot, making them hold their breath. He stopped nearby, the only sound their heavy breathing.

“Why aren’t the captain and the others here yet?” one of the armed men asked.

“Be patient,” the leader replied, trying to stay calm.

The questioner started to speak again, but a woman’s voice interrupted.

“Why aren’t you getting us out?” It was the woman in red.

Though dimly lit, their features were visible. The women were beautiful, but the red-dressed woman’s tone was entitled.

“The captain hasn’t returned, and we have a mission. We can’t leave,” the leader replied, irritation clear.

“But…” The woman in red began, only to be interrupted by another woman who gently urged, “Sally, relax. They’ll get us out.”

That voice made Ivy’s heart race. She focused on it, determined to see the face. That voice—like a haunting memory—was unforgettable. Her pulse quickened, yet she forced herself to stay calm. If she confirmed who it was, she couldn’t hold back.

Mark noticed Ivy’s tension and was ready to move, but she held him back, needing more information before acting.

Ivy felt a chill as she heard that voice. Memories of pain and betrayal flooded back. She had hoped to leave the past behind, but one word from that woman had shattered her defenses, reigniting her rage and fear.

She gripped the handgun hidden in her jacket. She resolved that once she was sure, she wouldn’t hesitate to act.

Fingers tightening around the cold metal, her heartbeat began to steady again.
