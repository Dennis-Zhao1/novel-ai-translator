**Spit Out My Ancient Jade: American Adaptation**

“Give me back my jade!” Ivy exclaimed, drawing out her words in frustration.

Suddenly, she noticed her reflection seemed to shift.

“I can’t return it; my apologies,” a voice echoed back.

The situation was tense, otherwise Ivy would have confronted it head-on. 

She sighed and settled back on the grass, her gaze lingering on the pile of gold bars and jewelry scattered before her. At least she had these, right?

As she began organizing the jumble, Ivy carefully set each piece of jewelry aside. After a rough count, she realized there were over seventy high-quality gemstone pieces and more than a hundred mid-range ones. While nothing was of average quality, her grandfather's once-loyal apprentice, Ben, had clearly learned well before his betrayal, utilizing his skills with impressive finesse.

The collection of high-end jade jewelry was even more staggering. Each piece was significant, and there were seven or eight complete sets of the coveted Emperor Green jade, each capable of making ripples in the jewelry industry if sold.

Her grandfather had mentioned owning a similar set, but never explained why it disappeared.

Adding up the individual pieces, there were over a hundred jade items, and more than two hundred high-end jade bracelets. The exquisite craftsmanship on the mid-range jade plaques numbered over four hundred.

After estimating the market value of these jewels, Ivy was taken aback; it had to be worth over a hundred million, not even counting the value of the four pieces of ancient jade that had vanished.

Thinking about the ancient jade made her want to cry again.

Now with a clear understanding of the market value, Ivy began rummaging through the scattered gold bars on the ground.

Calling them gold bars felt misleading; in the industry, this plain gold is marked only with purity and weight stamps. These were raw materials for jewelry processing, valued directly based on international gold prices. Each piece was standardized at a weight of 1000 grams, or one kilogram, making a single piece worth several hundred thousand, a luxury beyond the reach of most.

This batch seemed to have been melted and recast by Ben, lacking factory stamps from gold suppliers.

It was reasonable to suspect the source wasn't entirely legal, which was why Ben had melted it into plain bars. This was borderline illegal, but she wasn't worried about Ben discovering and reporting her; she just needed to be cautious when cashing it out.

For now, it was best to keep a low profile to avoid exposure. Timing was everything; when chaos hit, who would even care about this?

After stacking the gold bars neatly into piles of fifty, she realized there were over a hundred stacks. No wonder that guy, Ben, was so fit; dragging gold around was quite the workout. Why not just haul a person instead?

Based on current international gold prices, she calculated this gold was worth over two hundred million. Ben was something else; how had he amassed such wealth in just a few years? Now it was all turning to her advantage.

Ivy's previously gloomy mood brightened; the wind felt sweet, the clouds warm, and the grass soft beneath her.

Yet that annoying mirror still looked as frustrating as ever, hmph.

Thinking about Ben's reaction if he found out, and whether he'd be so furious he'd choke on his own frustration, lifted her spirits even more.

She tidied up the space, stuffing the pile of old newspapers into garbage bags, storing them with the clothes she had previously changed out of, planning to dispose of them all together later.

In the pre-chaos world, her main task was to cash out and gather enough supplies, planning to outsmart Ben financially and ensure she had the upper hand before confronting him.

She steeled her resolve; it was only a matter of time before the bad guys got what they deserved.

Having made up her mind, Ivy exited the space, unaware that she had overlooked many crucial points.

Back in the real world, it was already the afternoon of the 27th. Realizing she'd been inside for quite some time, no wonder she was feeling so hungry.

For the past few days, Mrs. Smith hadn’t come to clean or cook at The Heights; basic cleaning was left to the robot vacuum. After tidying up, Ivy planned to go out for a meal.

Just then, her phone rang—it was a familiar voice, Grace.

“Hey Ivy, have you adjusted to the time difference? Grandpa is inviting you over for dinner!”

Ivy's heart sank a little; she understood what was coming.

Maintaining a calm facade, she said she had just woken up and would head over after getting ready. She quickly washed up, applied light makeup, and changed into some clothes before heading downstairs to get her car. The garage felt particularly empty now; all the girls had moved on, leaving only her car and the ones her grandfather and father had gifted her.

She thought about whether she should sell this place at The Heights and put her cars into storage; such a large area couldn’t be wasted.

Driving her favorite understated black sedan, Ivy stopped at the mall to buy a gift. She hurried to the Smith family’s residence, arriving just before dinner. Unlike the Jones family’s old house located in the outskirts, the Smith family’s residence was situated at the heart of the bustling city, thriving for generations in the most prosperous and mysterious area of town.

Who else could say their neighbors were historical landmarks? Only the Smith family could.

The Jones family had been similar to the Smith family in the past, but after several generations of decline, they settled on the outskirts.

Now, thanks to her grandfather, the Smith family maintained their status and wealth.

With Grandpa Smith hosting, Ivy sighed lightly in her heart, presenting a bright and charming smile as she greeted him, along with the uncles and brothers.

The Smith family was large; as long as the old patriarch was alive, he wouldn’t allow anyone to think of splitting the family, similar to the Adams family. However, the Adams had long established the eldest son in charge, while the second son expanded overseas markets, securing resources to hold sway over the other brothers, sacrificing comfort for influence.

Back to the main topic, once Ivy sat down with Grandpa Smith and the elders, Grace thoughtfully sat close to her. The dinner, while not particularly lively, was still enjoyable.

After the meal, Grandpa Smith stood up first with the aid of his cane, inviting Ivy to his study for tea, calling along several of his sons and grandsons.

Grace wasn’t among those called, and with a slight pout, she said to Ivy, “I’ll wait for you in my room. Come find me after you’re done talking!”

Ivy nodded, following the elders upstairs to the old man’s study.

Once everyone was seated, the door to the study was shut. Ivy looked at the Smith family elders and brothers surrounding her, feeling like a little lamb surrounded by wolves, and forced a small smile.

She had thought her little tricks would go unnoticed by these wise elders; it had only been a few days, and she had already been too conspicuous.

Seeing Ivy’s worried expression, Grandpa Smith chuckled softly.

“Ivy, don’t be scared. I didn’t call you here to intimidate you. I just wanted to see what’s going on; why can't you hold onto your wealth?”

“Grandpa Smith, today’s setup is a bit overwhelming for me; it’s only natural that I feel a little anxious,” Ivy replied, cleverly sidestepping the question.

“Ivy, you and Grace grew up together. I have a deep connection with your grandfather, so you can tell me anything,” he urged warmly.

Ivy wanted to stretch the conversation and dodge the topic, but unexpectedly, a Smith family uncle directly pulled out a file folder from the bookshelf and handed it to her.

Ivy looked down, her heart skipping a beat, but her face remained calm.
