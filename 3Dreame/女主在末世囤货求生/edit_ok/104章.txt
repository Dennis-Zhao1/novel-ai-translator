**Celebration Feast**

Despite the intense firefight during the zombie siege, the group managed to collect a massive haul of crystal cores. In the past, they would stuff them into cloth bags, but now they needed boxes to hold them all.

Looking at the several boxes filled to the brim with crystal cores of various attributes, their colors shimmering and reflecting a kaleidoscope of light, it was hard not to admire their beauty—if one could ignore where they came from.

Always drawn to shiny things, Ivy had a keen interest in the lab's research on the zombie bodies, especially those with mutated abilities. She hoped for progress; the siege had made it clear that having more ability users was essential.

Once the zombie bodies were cleared away, the incinerator could finally take a break. The smoke it produced sometimes drifted towards the fortress, only to be redirected by Ethan’s wind abilities. At times, when the fire didn’t seem strong enough, he would fan the flames, showcasing his skills. Anyone who witnessed it couldn’t help but be impressed by the young man's talent.

The ashes were gathered by the farming team for compost, mixed with organic fertilizers. They wondered if the crops would taste even better this way.

Three uses for one corpse—impressive indeed.

After the battle, a ceremony was held to commend the heroes. Not only the ability users but also the guards contributed significantly, fighting side by side without a moment's rest.

Mr. Smith opened the proceedings as usual, and when it was Ivy's turn to speak, she hadn’t prepared a speech. She thought she’d just express her feelings as she went up. Her gaze fell on the crowd, landing on Jack, who was grinning at her. His smile reminded her of an embarrassing moment, and she found herself at a loss for words.

It was Mike who saved the day, clapping and stirring up the mood.

Ivy shot a playful glare at the grinning Jack, then turned her attention back to the crowd and began, “I’m not great with grand speeches. You all saw the scenes from the zombie siege on video. All the ability users, guards, and even the ordinary folks put in tremendous effort for this victory. Everyone fought tooth and nail to protect the fortress, to safeguard our home. Today isn’t just a celebration; it’s also a thank you. Thank you to all who fought bravely, to everyone who followed orders and worked together, and most importantly, thank you to ourselves for striving to survive.”

She then gestured for Mike and the others to bring the boxes of crystal cores up on stage. Pointing at the boxes, she continued with a smile, “The zombie siege wasn’t entirely a bad thing. Look at all the crystal cores we’ve gained! Today, after deducting the cores reported by the ability users based on their participation, we’ll divide the rest of these cores equally. Mike and Sarah will be in charge of recording the consumption data of the ability users. After that, we’ll distribute them based on attributes. Any unbalanced cores will be converted into points. If the crystal cores aren’t needed by the guards, they can also be exchanged for points. However, I suggest keeping one or two as a badge of honor for this victory.”

As her words concluded, applause and cheers erupted from the crowd. Guards and ability users stood together, basking in the glory of their achievements. In that moment, they felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude and relief for being part of the End Times Fortress, where they could protect their families and the safety of their home.

Even a squad member who had planned to anonymously report a fellow soldier’s lapse during the battle abandoned that thought, embracing their captain and shedding tears of happiness.

“Captain, I won't report that you were dazed during the fight! I’m just so excited and moved!” they exclaimed.

Inside, the captain thought, “Well, I guess I'm off the hook for now.”

Mr. Smith had originally arranged for representatives from the ability users and the guard captain to speak, but seeing the crowd laughing and crying in a joyful mess, he decided to skip that and jump straight to the feast.

Of course, the fortress's signature dish—rabbit served three ways—was a must. In the cafeteria, ability users, guards, and ordinary folks mixed freely, sharing tables together. They started with cold dishes, munching on spicy rabbit heads and savoring stir-fried rabbit chunks, relishing the simple pleasures of life.

This time, Mrs. Johnson and the others showcased their culinary skills, serving up all their best dishes, impressing everyone. The old steward looked at the young lady being toasted by various guests, wiping away a tear from his eye, and raised his glass in a toast to Mrs. Johnson and the somewhat unfamiliar guests at the table.

Ivy found herself cornered at the main table, where an endless stream of guests came to pay their respects with toasts. She was genuinely grateful, not just for herself but for the main table’s core members, all of whom were being toasted in turn.

After several rounds of drinks, she felt a bit dazed at the sight of the approaching army of toasters. Just as she hesitated, wanting to accept a drink, a long hand next to her snatched it away. The crowd began to cheer, “Double for the Black Knight!” Jack did not refuse, downing the drink easily. Ivy felt a warm rush to her face, her eyes slightly burning with heat.

Luckily, Mike and Ethan, laughing, managed to divert the toasters away. After downing his drink, Jack said nothing and returned to his seat. Gradually, the toasters became less frequent, and the atmosphere lightened as everyone drank and joked around. Some even playfully challenged each other with fistfights, filling the room with laughter and commotion.

When it was Ivy’s turn again, she found herself surrounded by toasts of beer, white liquor, red wine, and foreign spirits—anything went. They had a wide variety of drinks, so it wasn’t a problem at all. But when a younger guy filled a glass to the brim with cooking wine, she couldn’t help but wonder what he was thinking. Was cooking wine really that intoxicating?

The younger guy, now being pulled away by others, shouted, “Ivy, boss, goddess, cheers!”

Ivy facepalmed, realizing just how strong the cooking wine was.

Mike, with an arm slung over Jack’s shoulder, was in high spirits, reminiscing about how he had watched the once soft, innocent princess transform into the queen of the End Times Fortress, his heart swelling with pride. As he spoke, he nearly teared up.

Jack could only sigh helplessly; Mike’s enthusiasm seemed to have intensified his grip, making it impossible to escape.

The guards were surrounded by their families, children looking up at them in admiration, relatives filled with pride and joy. The atmosphere among the ability users was markedly different; where one side was warm and cozy, the other was chaotic and silly.

Just as Jack finally managed to pry himself away from Mike, Ethan plopped down next to him, insisting on sharing a drink. As Ivy finally sat down to enjoy some food, she couldn’t help but notice Ethan tugging on Jack, crying out, “Jack, let’s toast! If you don’t drink, I’ll throw a fit!” She secretly regretted not just sticking to some soda; after all, who said a celebration feast had to involve alcohol?

Zoe, allergic to alcohol, didn’t participate at all. After eating, she took the lead in returning to their post. With people getting this drunk, they wouldn’t even notice if the enemy invaded.

Feeling a bit tipsy herself, Ivy quickly organized the sober ones to help those who were out cold, sending them back. Those who couldn’t walk were left to lounge in the cafeteria, as long as they didn’t choke on their own vomit, everything else was secondary.

After assigning tasks, she shook her head to clear the dizziness and headed outside. Sarah, who hadn’t had any drinks, came over to help her, but she declined, insisting Sarah check on Mike, who was sobbing into a pillar, calling out to his buddy Jack.

Sarah had never seen anything like this and hurried back to pull Mike away. Turning back, she saw Jack supporting the swaying Ivy as they made their way out. That eased her worries, and she went back to deal with her boyfriend, who was still clinging to the pillar.

Inside Sarah’s mind, she thought, “A tough guy who doesn’t shed a tear in the face of danger turns into a blubbering mess after a few drinks. What a sight.”

But what could she do? She couldn’t just abandon her boyfriend.
