**The Secret to Unlocking the Mystic Realm**

As the evening's get-together wound down, the lively chatter and laughter gradually gave way to the tranquility of the night. Guests departed one by one, some with a sense of triumph, others simply content. Ivy Bennett, however, remained silent, her gaze slightly downcast as she watched them leave, her mind a swirl of countless thoughts. With her friend Clara Johnson, she bid farewell to the last of their acquaintances before Clara's family whisked her away. Once they were gone, Ivy made a quick phone call, and shortly thereafter, slipped into a car heading towards her family's ancestral estate.

Though she hadn’t indulged much in the evening's drinks, her mind was racing, pondering how long it would take for the older generation to catch on to her plans. She needed to act swiftly, to conclude what she started decisively.

As the car cruised steadily toward the old estate’s farm house, the effects of the evening wore off, and she exchanged a few words with her driver, who doubled as her bodyguard, before setting off to inspect the storage situation in the barn. The bodyguard kept a respectful distance, ensuring her safety without being intrusive. Ivy hoped to find everything as she remembered it. Having survived a metaphorical apocalypse in her own life for over five years, her recollection of the estate’s layout and paths had faded significantly.

She needed to scout the place in advance; it would be easier to plan her actions later in the quiet of night.

Once she confirmed her memories were accurate, Ivy decided against checking the barn's contents and instead returned to the estate, where the old caretaker, Mr. Collins, awaited her by the grand entrance, looking spry and alert.

Hearing that Ivy was returning to the estate, he had stayed up, organizing the remaining staff to tidy up her already pristine bedroom and prepare some late-night snacks, just in case she needed anything.

Back in the familiar confines of her childhood home, Ivy felt a wave of nostalgia. Her recent asset evaluation had overlooked this place; perhaps subconsciously, she had never intended to sell it. Sitting in the living room where she had grown up, memories of her grandfather, parents, and her younger self, carefree and full of laughter, lingered in every corner.

In her past, she had left the estate with only the valuable jewelry from the storeroom, leaving behind countless ancient texts, valuable paintings, and other precious relics. This time, she was determined to protect even the smallest scrap of paper within those walls.

After sending Mr. Collins and the staff off to rest, Ivy washed up, feeling surprisingly alert. She made her way to her grandfather’s study.

The storeroom's location and the methods to access it were known only to her, so it was safe from discovery if emptied. The study was meticulously cleaned every day, and her grandfather's unfinished calligraphy was still pressed under a weight, the ink in the nearby inkstone long dried. The brush remained poised as if ready to dip into the ink, stirring a wave of emotion within Ivy.

Realizing the time, she gently closed the study door behind her, leaving only the soft, warm glow of a lamp beside the bookshelf. She approached the desk and opened the third drawer, rummaging through its contents.

After a moment, she heard a faint click, and the bookshelf shifted silently to reveal a dark, narrow gap just wide enough for her to slip through. Without leaving even a trace of light behind, Ivy stepped into the hidden chamber.

As she entered the secret room, the bookshelf smoothly closed behind her, sealing her in darkness. Suddenly, bright lights flickered on, and even though she had been through this many times before, the intensity still momentarily blinded her.

Shaking her head to regain her composure, Ivy began surveying the room, which was just as she remembered—filled to the brim with books, scrolls, and stacks of boxes brimming with jewelry and precious stones.

She had never considered how many generations of her family had amassed these treasures, but as the sole heir, she vowed to protect them fiercely this time around. As she contemplated how to move both the bookshelf and its contents into her personal storage, her eyes landed on an ancient tome.

"Art of Observation" — this was a manual for honing perception, filled with cryptic verses and notes from generations of ancestors. It contained insights and methods related to mastering the art of observation.

In simple terms, the Art of Observation allowed practitioners to discern the quality and essence of high-grade gemstones through meditation, providing precise assessments during auctions and stone dealings—a skill she found invaluable as a certified gemologist.

Ivy felt a pang of nostalgia, recalling how her grandfather had mentioned it once or twice but had never insisted she learn it. Given her current wealth and resources, she no longer needed to study the Art of Observation. Yet, the words of a certain mentor from her past rang in her mind—his father possessed an immense reserve of gemstones; mastering this skill could help her navigate that world with clarity.

She chuckled at her own absurd thoughts and began busily packing the books from the shelves into her personal space. After several trips back and forth, she found herself utterly exhausted.

Wasn’t there a more efficient way? Sitting cross-legged on the earthen floor of her space, she pondered how long it would take to move everything this way.

Suddenly, she remembered that in her previous life, practitioners of spatial abilities could retrieve items with mere thoughts. Determined, she stepped out of the space and began attempting this method. After several failed attempts, she finally managed to pull a very thin booklet into her space.

At this point, her head was spinning, her energy depleted, as if all her mental faculties had been drained.

Mental energy?

Ivy suddenly grasped a crucial point; ever since her rebirth, her way of thinking and mental strength felt different than before.

This wouldn’t do—she had to find a way to enhance her abilities. Otherwise, how could she possibly transport all the supplies from the farm house?

Turning back to the bookshelf in the secret room, she meticulously searched for any literature that might aid in enhancing her mental prowess.

During this search, she inadvertently discovered a fragment of an ancient text titled "The Complete Book of the Jade Dragon's Mystic Realm," wedged between two books, easily overlooked.

Pulling it out, she realized it was indeed a fragment, but it contained essential information, such as the significance of two sundials representing time within and outside the space, indicating that time flowed slowly within the space, almost in a state of stasis.

This implied she could test the preservation capabilities of her space. In her previous life, space practitioners could only store items; they couldn’t enter or preserve anything, as the flow of time was the same as in the outside world.

The fragment also detailed the method to unlock the Jade Dragon Mystic Realm, with conditions that were rather stringent: one must possess Bennett blood, the Jade Dragon must make contact with blood, and the person unlocking the realm must have impaired mental strength.

Ivy was torn between feelings of relief and despair; it was unfortunate that she needed impaired mental strength to access the space, yet ironic that once opened, she wouldn’t be able to utilize it properly. What a headache!

Fortunately, she also found a method for mental strength restoration. Without delay, she began to comprehend the incantations, quickly learning from the notes left by her ancestors.

But where could she find the spiritual energy needed to mend her meridians? Sitting cross-legged in the secret chamber, she scratched her head in frustration, then remembered that her phone was still in the space. As she flashed back in, she suddenly felt a gentle current of air brushing against her body, even in the stillness of the secret realm.

Was this spiritual energy? It wasn’t that it didn’t exist; she just hadn’t fully grasped the method to draw it in.

Without hesitation, Ivy began to meditate, focusing on guiding the currents of energy to cleanse her meridians, opening up every blocked point along her energy pathways.

It was hard to describe the sensation; had it not been for her strong willpower, she likely would have given up. Unblocking her meridians without external assistance could easily lead to harm, such as reversed energy flow. But with unwavering determination, she pressed on, enduring the challenge.

The results were worth it! Every part of her body ached delightfully as she allowed the spiritual energy to circulate freely through her meridians. Ivy lay back on the earthen floor, exhausted yet invigorated, her face weary but her eyes shining with resolve and unyielding spirit.
