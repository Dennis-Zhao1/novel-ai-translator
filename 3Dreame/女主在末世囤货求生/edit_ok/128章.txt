**The Young Hothead and the Innocent Lily**

"Lily, even if you don't like me, there's no need to be so harsh, is there?" 

Lily, with a classic look of innocence, tugged at the hem of her shirt, her head lowered as tears welled up in her eyes. Passersby at the community center couldn't help but notice her vulnerable demeanor, sparking sympathy for the newcomer who appeared to be overwhelmed.

Just then, a young man with a fiery sense of justice stepped forward to defend her. "Lily's been through enough; there's no reason to make it harder for her."

His words, along with the concerned glances from those around them, only fueled Pei Smith's frustration. Recently recovering from an illness, her complexion was pale, but now flush with indignation, contrasting sharply with the tearful Lily beside her.

"You all keep saying I'm making it hard for her—what exactly am I doing? Am I yelling at her, or kicking her out?"

Pei crossed her arms, glaring at the young man. His confidence faltered; he had assumed Lily was being bullied simply because she looked so helpless.

"Why are you silent? If you have no evidence, then aren't you just slandering me? Should I start claiming you're bullying me?"

The young man stepped back, stung by her retort, feeling sweat trickle down his forehead as his confidence ebbed.

"Lily, please, don't make this harder for him; he's just trying to stand up for what's right." 

Lily suddenly moved in front of the young man, her demeanor one of quiet defiance against perceived injustice.

The young man, touched by her defense, felt his resolve reignite. He opened his mouth to speak but stopped short as Anna, who had been on a break, witnessed the entire scene.

Anna clapped her hands, her sarcasm as sharp as Pei's earlier words. "Well, what a performance! Really captivating stuff!"

"I've never seen such blatant manipulation before—it's something else!"

Pei, too angry to appreciate the humor, snapped back, "If you're going to watch, just watch! Spare us the commentary!"

Lily burst into tears. "Why is everyone treating me like this?"

Her unexpected sobs made both Anna and Pei roll their eyes. In all their years, they'd never encountered someone quite like Lily.

"Lily, don't cry. It's not your fault they're being unreasonable; we just don't have the same status or power."

The young man gritted his teeth, looking like he wanted to shout but felt helpless, patting Lily's back in a comforting gesture.

"What's going on here? Why is traffic blocked on the stairs?"

At that moment, Sarah, the patrol captain, strode up, noticing the crowd clogging the stairway, obstructing the patrol team's passage.

"Captain Sarah, please help us out!"

The young man, seeing a lifeline, hurriedly recounted what he had seen.

Anna, fed up with the melodrama, sighed. It was clear Lily had accidentally bumped into Pei at the stairwell, and now it was being spun into a tale of oppression worthy of a soap opera. This wasn't just naivety; it was a masterclass in storytelling.

Sarah listened patiently before addressing them with a stern expression. "Is this it? You're blocking the stairway for this? Pei can tell you off if she wants, and you better deal with it. You're at Greenwood Community now. If you don't want to stay and behave, then you can leave!"

Anna couldn't help but admire Sarah's no-nonsense approach. Pei was practically family to the community leader, and these two were clearly not endearing themselves to her.

"Lily, it's alright. It's my fault for provoking Pei," Lily said, covering her face, her voice a mix of tears and resignation.

Zhu, who'd been observing, was about to comment when Pei's brother, Jack, and his friend Ethan emerged from a nearby office. Noticing the crowd, Jack frowned, asking, "What's going on here? Why is everyone gathered?"

Already upset, Pei's mood soured further at Jack's presence. Wanting to escape the chaos, she tried to push past Lily and the young man.

As Pei reached out, Lily stumbled backward dramatically, pulling the young man with her.

Zhu was left speechless, her mouth agape.

This was a performance worthy of an acting class, Zhu thought. Despite witnessing plenty of drama before, she'd never seen anything quite like this.

From an outsider's perspective, it looked like Pei had intentionally pushed the pair. As Pei was known for her strong will, while Lily and the young man were ordinary folks, Pei's actions seemed questionable. Sarah's expression suggested that Pei had the right to act as she did, while Jack raised an eyebrow, "Pei, are your powers back?"

Pei, already frustrated by Lily's antics, turned to Jack, momentarily stunned. "No, you know my situation better than anyone."

Jack paused, quickly piecing together the situation, and his gaze toward Lily turned chilly.

Sensing the shift, Lily quickly offered an excuse. "I’m sorry, I was trying to move aside and lost my balance."

She helped the young man to his feet, attempting to maintain her innocent facade.

Seeing that the situation hadn't escalated further, Jack motioned for everyone to disperse. However, Pei felt betrayed by Jack's apparent leniency toward Lily, and stormed off to her room, slamming the door.

Lily stayed behind, her gaze lingering on Ethan, who stood beside Jack, his presence even more striking than Jack’s. Her heart fluttered; a man like Ethan, with his calm demeanor and obvious strength, was intriguing.

If only Pei hadn’t been so protective, Lily thought, she might have charmed her way into a better position ages ago.

But as they say, when one door closes, another opens. With a coy smile, Lily thanked Jack, lowering her gaze, giving a subtle peek of her neckline. The young man beside her couldn't help but stare.

Zhu rolled her eyes; she hadn't seen such blatant flirtation since her college days. Even the apocalypse hadn't wiped out all the absurdity of human behavior.

Sadly, men often missed the subtleties. Jack, with a gentle smile, told Lily, "No need to be so formal; consider the community your home. You're welcome here."

Lily beamed, her eyes sparkling as she nodded enthusiastically. If not for the over-the-top sweetness in her tone, she might have been convincing.

Zhu rolled her eyes again. Oh, men!

Just as she was about to step back, Lily sidled up to Ethan, tilting her head with curiosity. "Are you new here too? Hi, I'm Lily. Nice to meet you!"
