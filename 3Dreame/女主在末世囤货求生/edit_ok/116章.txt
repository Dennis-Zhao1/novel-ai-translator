**Delivering Supplies Squad**

Jack spotted Sarah swiftly entering the spatial realm, only to be besieged again by that hooded zombie. It seemed that the electric shocks it received last time hadn’t been enough to teach it a lesson.

Lightning struck repeatedly, and other zombies surged toward Jack. Mike and his team were still caught up in their own battles, lagging behind and leaving a considerable distance between them and Jack.

At that moment, Jack didn’t care how many zombies surrounded him; he only wanted to fry that grotesque-faced creature.

After entering the spatial realm, Sarah instantly replenished her energy. Her pounding heart and the pressure in her temples eased. Not resting for long, she exited the space and found Jack surrounded by zombies, the encirclement not exceeding six feet.

Watching Jack effortlessly deal with the zombies under the trees was impressive. He unleashed bursts of lightning with one hand while wielding a machete like he was slicing through vegetables, decapitating and dismembering the zombies with ease.

She hadn’t expected to see cold weapons used in such a way. Quickly, she summoned a few ice spikes to help Jack break free from the encirclement, alleviating some of the pressure he was under.

Seeing that Sarah was unharmed, Jack’s racing heart settled back into place. They had encountered a significant number of zombies on their journey, and she had taken down so many alone, with an endless tide of zombies still pouring in. The peril of the situation was evident.

With renewed fervor, he intensified his attacks. Mike and the others finally realized they had been too absorbed in their own zombie slaying and hadn’t managed to regroup with Captain Jack and Sarah. They began to move while fighting. Fortunately, after the hooded zombie’s psychic abilities were hindered, no more zombies joined the fray. Currently, there were still over two hundred standing in the forest, so the fight wasn’t as overwhelming.

The encirclement of zombies was kept within a six-foot radius, which, while not a safe distance, was manageable. Sarah thought for a moment before removing her automatic grappling hook and tossing it toward Jack.

“Jack, catch!”

She shouted, sending a few ice spikes flying to dispatch two zombies attempting to sneak up on him.

Jack caught the grappling hook and turned to shoot toward the direction of the tree where Sarah stood. This time, the shot was more accurate, the hook embedded deep, and in a swift motion, he stood on a branch beside her, forming a left-right duo.

The hooded zombie was infuriated. It had been shocked multiple times, and just as it planned to launch a psychic attack on the male human while he was distracted, he darted up a tree. Fine, that wouldn’t hinder its plans.

As Sarah unleashed a barrage of ice needles, she sensed a distinct fluctuation in psychic energy. The hooded zombie was attempting its old tricks again. This time, she transformed her psychic power into fine threads like cow hair, weaving them into the zombie’s attack and reversing it.

The hooded zombie immediately sensed something was off, cutting off its psychic energy. Realizing its situation was precarious, it wanted to take advantage of its zombie minions as cover to escape.

Mike was already charging in from behind, and this time, they truly had the zombie sandwiched from both sides, striking fear into the makeshift horde of zombies, which was left with no spirit to fight back.

The zombies couldn’t even get close; any attack aimed their way was disrupted by ice spikes or electricity. It was infuriating.

Especially for the intelligent earth-type zombie, which was communicating with the hooded zombie. Both were hiding behind other zombies, dodging attacks. Sarah unleashed her psychic abilities, attempting to control the zombies below to see if she could make them turn on each other. Unfortunately, it didn’t work, only causing a brief moment of confusion, but for Jack and the others, that was already impressive.

Sarah, however, felt her abilities were lacking. She initially thought she was on equal footing with the hooded zombie but realized she was just a novice compared to true psychic masters.

Unbeknownst to her, the hooded zombie had used all its tricks just to regain control of the situation.

Unable to pinpoint the hooded zombie’s location and not facing any further psychic attacks, she assumed Jack had taken it down. Just then, the tree began to tilt—thanks to the earth-type zombie causing trouble.

They were currently about ten feet off the ground; a fall wouldn’t be fatal, but it could still cause injury. Sarah locked onto the sneaky earth-type zombie and, taking advantage of its movement, launched several ice spikes at it. At the same time, Jack’s lightning followed suit, creating an electric net that blocked the earth-type zombie’s escape route, reminiscent of Sarah’s earlier predicament.

One ice spike struck it, leaving a gaping hole in its neck, its head drooping to the side. Yet, it continued to flee desperately as the tree tilted precariously, just over three feet from the ground. They both jumped from the tree, rolling to absorb the impact.

Zombies gradually closed in, and their view on the ground was obstructed, forcing them to focus on the approaching zombies, leaving no time to deal with the two most troublesome foes.

When they regrouped with Mike and the others, the ground was littered with zombie corpses, but the hooded and earth-type zombies had vanished. Sarah sighed to the group, “I initially wanted to lure them to the stronghold, but that ugly-faced hooded zombie controlled the horde and chased me all the way. I didn’t expect them to stop pursuing once we reached the ring road. I didn’t want to miss out on this harvest, so I climbed the mountain. That earth-type zombie was clever, managing to evade and cooperate, causing me quite a bit of trouble. What a shame, it must have had a fourth-level earth crystal core. It got away.”

Her words made the earth-type ability users in the team groan in frustration. Yes, a fourth-level earth crystal core would have directly leveled them up. It was such a pity to let it escape.

Jack suppressed a smile; he could tell the lamentation was more for her than anything else. That hooded zombie’s crystal core would have been valuable too. It hadn’t been a psychic user before, so it was no big deal, but now that a substantial core was slipping away, how could one not feel frustrated?

Sarah shot a glare at the chuckling man, huffing. Just because he came to her rescue didn’t mean she was grateful. His laughter reminded her of an embarrassing incident she thought she’d never live down.

Mike, however, was more open-minded, bursting into laughter as he patted Eric, who was already pulling out his dagger.

“No worries, we’ll get it next time!”

The others began to dig through the zombie remains, and Jack sheathed his machete, seemingly oblivious to the glare from the girl. He joined his team in searching for crystal cores.

Now that felt more appropriate, Sarah thought. She didn’t feel as awkward as before. Meanwhile, Eric and Mike, who had been observing everything, exchanged glances, winking at each other.

Considering Sarah’s keen hearing, any disparaging remarks about her would be picked up, so the two communicated non-verbally, sharing a knowing smile before they resumed their serious work.

How could they not be diligent? During that brief exchange, their team had already extracted several crystal cores. It felt like opening blind boxes, and when one member dug up a water-type crystal, they rushed to rinse it off, washing it clean before stashing it away, afraid someone might snatch it.

Thanks to Sarah’s rules, every mission only allowed them to keep a certain number of crystal cores for submission, with the rest to be evenly distributed. Each crystal extraction session was filled with joy, like children showing off their good luck.

At that moment, the vice-captain shouted, “Hahaha, look! I dug up a fourth-level fire crystal core! Fourth-level!”
