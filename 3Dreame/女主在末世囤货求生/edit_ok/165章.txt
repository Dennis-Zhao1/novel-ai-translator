### Chapter Title: The Unknown Depths

The small drone zipped through the air, ascending rapidly. Ethan felt a twinge of anxiety that they might exceed the operational limits and lose control. Just then, his tech-savvy friend, Mark, chimed in, “Don't sweat it! This little guy won't lose connection unless it's damaged beyond repair. So take a breather!”

Ethan ignored him, focusing intently on the tablet screen. At this speed, the vertical void ahead looked exceptionally deep. After the drone climbed a few more feet, the screen flashed, revealing another void. These two voids seemed to intersect at a right angle. Ethan quickly reduced the drone's speed, even pausing momentarily to confirm whether he was seeing things or if it was real.

The drone began to descend slowly until Ethan could clearly see the void. Without hesitation, he navigated the drone inside, only to be met with a sight that made him feel queasy: a dense mass of grotesque growths. They weren't as large as the ones they'd seen just a couple of days ago, but they were just as unsettling.

One of those growths had already given them a hard time—how were they going to handle so many?

In a low voice, just loud enough for Ivy to hear, Ethan shared his findings. Ivy realized why she hadn't sensed them with her mental energy; it was simply too far away. It seemed they still had a good distance to cover.

They couldn’t let these hideous growths continue to multiply. Who knew when they would completely surround or take over the refuge? Ignorance was bliss, but seeing them would only gnaw at her peace of mind.

Ethan shared her concern. But how were they supposed to ascend through that vertical passage? This mountain range was the tallest surrounding the refuge. If they couldn’t go up from below, they’d have to come down from above.

As the drone neared the end of the void, a glimmer of light appeared on the screen. As the drone ascended higher, the light grew brighter. Once the display lit up entirely, Ethan knew they had emerged. The drone hovered above the void, scanning the surroundings, effectively becoming Ethan’s external eyes, providing him with a clear view.

He didn’t immediately retract the drone but allowed it to hover near the opening of the void, using it as a GPS locator.

After discussing their findings, the two reached a consensus: they would lead the group back the way they came. By now, Hannah and the others should have returned to the refuge. Without lingering, they quickly made their way back.

The group easily jumped over a fissure about three feet wide and soon arrived at a spot teeming with small crystal-like formations. Ivy was still contemplating the points system, debating whether to collect some for points. But Ethan grabbed her arm, leading her directly past the area of uncollected formations.

Ivy understood he didn’t want to waste time and didn’t press the issue further. They could always come back to mine these after handling the immediate crisis; they wouldn’t go anywhere.

The time spent inside felt drastically shorter than outside. Everyone perceived the return journey as swift and smooth, and before long, they exited the cave and headed straight down the mountain.

Upon arranging for everyone to return to the refuge, Ethan and Ivy announced they would search for the entrance of the void. Some wanted to follow, while others urged them against it, fearing for their safety.

“Don’t worry, everyone. The sky is darkening. Hurry back to avoid any unforeseen incidents. Finding the entrance is something Ethan and I will take care of; you don’t need to fret,” Ivy instructed, watching the others leave until only she and Ethan remained.

Everyone knew Ivy had a spatial ability, but no one had ever asked her how vast it was, what it could hold, or what her limits were.

After Ethan meticulously described the location, he could see on the system’s screen where the drone was hovering. Ivy nodded, realizing it was time to deploy some of their resources.

They stood on the highway, and Ivy gestured for him to step back. Ethan complied, and in the next moment, a massive, vibrant pink helicopter appeared in the middle of the road.

She called for him to check the helicopter’s condition. Although she had ensured it was in good shape beforehand, safety always came first; a pre-flight check was essential.

After quickly completing the inspection, Ethan motioned for Ivy to board, ready to take off.

Ivy had never learned to pilot a helicopter; in fact, she initially bought it for her friend, Melissa. Now, sitting next to Ethan, she realized how unpredictable life could be.

Watching Ethan expertly control the helicopter, she settled into her seat, content to be a passive observer.

Despite the large mountains beneath them, flying was significantly faster than traveling on foot. Thanks to the system’s guidance, Ethan quickly located the area where the drone was stationed. He had seen a broad, treeless clearing not far from the void, perfect for landing the helicopter.

Ivy assumed they were merely scouting the area, but was pleasantly surprised to find an ideal landing spot nearby—absolutely perfect.

Once they had landed, they glanced at the sky, noting that time was of the essence.

“I couldn’t say much in the cave, but the three members of the guard team might not have even entered the cave,” Ethan remarked.

“Hmm? Where could they have gone?” Ivy inquired.

“I’m not sure. However, there are indeed adult male footprints leading from the cave entrance a distance inside, but they vanish unexpectedly. I thought they might be the guard team, but I haven’t found any traces of them along the way. If they had encountered the red-haired demon, the mad sea urchin, or the grotesque growths, they would have been dead by now—there would be no way they would leave no trace behind.”

Ivy nodded, contemplating who else could have left those footprints if not the guard team. Was it Alex?

The thought of this possibility heightened their urgency to uncover the secrets hidden in the mountain. Was Alex inside? They needed to unveil the truth.

They reached the edge of the void, which appeared distinctly different from the previous cave—they could tell it had been artificially excavated.

Ethan, having accumulated ample points, exchanged them for various equipment. He secured a climbing rope to a nearby tree and tossed the other end into the void. Ivy followed suit. Although she hadn’t piloted a helicopter or parachuted before, she had experience with climbing and had grasped the basics.

As she donned her gear and secured her safety rope, Ethan hastily finished his preparations before checking on her. She had fastened everything correctly and just needed minor adjustments. Giving her an approving nod, he released the drone again. It flew down, tethered by a thin rope.

Ivy watched as the rope wound tighter around the drone, marveling at how deep it must be. Soon, Ethan called out that it was time.

He was the first to grasp the rope and slowly descended, back toward the void. Ivy followed closely behind, the two of them moving cautiously downward.

Ethan wore a safety helmet that Ivy had collected during a resource run, and she had equipped her own helmet, complete with a headlamp for illumination.

After a considerable descent, they approached the horizontal opening. The drone remained quietly at the entrance, waiting. Once Ethan reached the bottom safely, he secured the rope to the rocky wall of the opening, turned around, and carefully assisted Ivy down, ensuring she landed securely on solid ground before untying their ropes.

Taking a deep breath, Ethan turned to Ivy and said, “From here on out, even if you don’t have a fear of dense crowds, just be careful.”
