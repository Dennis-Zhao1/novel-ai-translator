**Return to the Fortress**

They exchanged a couple of boomerangs, and as Ethan explained their use to Ivy, his team was constantly on the move, leaving her amazed. The boomerangs shimmered with a vibrant blue hue, and when thrown into the darkness, they emitted a bright glow, creating shimmering rings in the air. No matter how he repositioned himself, they returned to Ethan's hand with precision.

Ivy was eager to try them out several times, feeling that this type of weapon could be quite effective. Given the current situation, using guns wasn’t ideal; these were just perfect.

One was on the offense while the other provided support. They had long since realized that the grotesque flowers would only spit out seeds when they were close to dying, as if their last mission was to reproduce and leave their offspring in this world. They struck decisively, cutting off tendrils and severing roots. Ivy was determined to eliminate the threat entirely, but the more they attacked, the more seeds were sprayed out.

They had filled several jars to the brim. While Ethan took a moment to gather the seeds himself, trading them for points, he was baffled by the system’s display. The points showed a long string of zeros without any units—no hundreds or thousands in sight. Staring at the endless zeros, he lost interest in counting and focused instead on trading for equipment and weapons.

“Hey, Ethan! You're the best! And I must say, the little helper in my head is quite happy!” 

Ethan’s face remained calm, dealing with the relentless attacks of the vine-like tendrils and the seeds being shot from all directions, while also keeping an eye on the shop for weapons that could enhance efficiency. At the moment, he had no time to entertain the system; it would be better if Ivy praised him.

“Ethan, that should be enough. These are all full!” 

Ivy brought over two more jars of seeds, and Ethan finally took a moment to accept them, offering her a gentle smile.

His smile was so charming that it made her ears turn slightly red, and she immediately shifted her focus back to the grotesque flowers. Using her mental energy, she scanned the area—there must be more than half left. Working together was indeed tiring; with an air gun in one hand and a boomerang in the other, she managed to keep the rhythm with impressive coordination. Before long, they had cleared another section.

Ethan stopped splitting his attention to browse for weapons; there were too many options and no effective way to filter them. Flipping through pages was a waste of precious time; he might as well keep hacking away at the flowers.

With one hand shielding them with a protective barrier and the other wielding a freezing gun, he supported Ivy’s efforts. Their synergy became evident, with their rhythm perfectly synchronized. No longer distracted by seed collection, they focused on clearing the area and were soon nearing the end of the long corridor. The darkness ahead was thick, and while Ethan initially planned to send a small drone to scout ahead, Ivy had already filled a pouch with seeds along the way.

They couldn’t afford to waste time on the scattered seeds; over an hour had already passed since they entered. If they delayed too long, nightfall could bring unexpected attacks, and the people inside the fortress might not withstand it.

Once Ethan had struck down all the grotesque flowers, he looked back to see only fallen limbs and withered leaves scattered across the ground.

Both raised their flame-wielding weapons and unleashed a torrent of fire onto the ground, primarily to exterminate the seeds, as the flowers had nearly withered away. Just when they thought they were halfway done, Ivy's sharp senses detected something amiss—a disturbance coming from behind them.

“Ethan, behind us!” 

In an instant, Ivy spun around and unleashed a long stream of flames. The corridor lit up, revealing a horde of densely packed spiders crawling out. These spiders were larger than fists, ugly, and moved with incredible speed. Was this the leap from mutated plants to mutated animals?

“Be careful! Black widow spiders have mutated! Look at their abdomens—they're massive and surely very venomous!” 

Ethan immediately recognized the species. It was absurd, as this type of spider didn’t exist in their city before, but then again, neither did these mutated plants. After the apocalypse, anything could happen.

Ivy felt goosebumps crawl over her skin. She had already come to terms with the grotesque flowers, but seeing these spiders for the first time almost made her lose it.

They frantically sprayed flames at the spiders, quickly turning the ground into a graveyard of charred spider remains. This weapon was truly durable; if she had been using her flame gun, she would have needed to replenish fuel or let it cool down after a short time due to overheating.

Ethan was also spraying flames towards another direction, but with so many spiders in the corridor, they found it hard to defend themselves effectively.

Ethan exchanged for two more flame weapons, one in each hand, and they began to shoot back and forth, finally managing to halt the onslaught of the attacking black widow spiders.

These creatures seemed to carry potent venom, their distended abdomens decorated with colorful patterns. Upon closer inspection, Ivy noticed they bore a resemblance to the grotesque flowers. She quickly shared her observation with Ethan, who agreed that there seemed to be some connection between the two.

With Dr. Smith still absent, they had no way to analyze or study the seeds. While contemplating the idea of bringing back a spider sample, they heard an unusual sound—something large was nearby.

The two braced themselves, wary of what might suddenly emerge. Fortunately, whatever it was seemed to fear fire, stopping at a considerable distance from them. After a long pause, it finally turned and left. Ethan was reluctant to let this unknown creature escape, but with so many spiders blocking the way and lacking the ability to fly, he felt powerless.

Ivy had already sensed it with her mental energy; the crystalline core was about the size of a zombie, possibly a zombie or a spider the size of one. If these spiders could grow to human size, it would spell trouble.

After burning for a while longer, the spiders were mostly dead, and those that remained retreated as the large creature left. Ivy breathed a sigh of relief. She wanted to pursue it, but the scattered seeds were also significant, so they had to focus on the task at hand.

The two continued clearing the leftover seeds, most of which were in ruins. As they neared the cave entrance, Ethan helped Ivy remove her fireproof suit, allowing her to pack it away while he did the same, organizing and storing his gear.

The watch showed it was nearly eight o’clock. Before leaving the cave, Ethan hesitated over whether to blow it up. However, considering the large creature still inside, he decided it was best to preserve it for potential future cleaning, focusing instead on getting back quickly.

By the time they settled back into the helicopter cockpit, it was already past nine. The ascent had been more challenging than the descent, but thankfully, they made it out successfully, with a substantial haul.

Starting the engine, they flew straight back to the base. Ivy specifically reminded him to land outside the fortress, as the large hole in the square hadn’t been filled yet, leaving no room inside. Ethan nodded and turned towards the fortress.

The drone of the helicopter at night was more pronounced, likely attracting a fair number of zombies. But the real issue wasn’t the zombies; it was these mutated plants and animals. Ivy felt a heaviness in her heart, realizing that the apocalypse had progressed to a level she couldn’t have predicted.
