**Her Plans**

The physical prowess of the special forces was truly impressive, surpassing that of ordinary folks. The Smith family had already taken breaks in two rounds, and if it weren't for Ivy's relentless daily training, she would have been struggling to keep up by now.

Ethan was deftly controlling two uniquely designed metallic constructs that efficiently took down zombies. His metal-based abilities were somewhat akin to hers; he could manipulate metal to change its trajectory and use it as a concealed weapon. Unlike her, though, he didn’t generate metal from within himself but rather used the existing metal around them. No wonder Ethan had specifically requested the Smith family to provide him with two metal shuttles. The way he maneuvered them had an oddly satisfying aesthetic.

At this moment, Jack still stood out as the strongest among them, and Ivy keenly noticed his ability to precisely control the release of his powers. The lightning strikes he summoned landed with impressive accuracy, directly hitting the zombies' brains without causing any collateral damage.

She realized that his impressive endurance stemmed from this precise control, and she began to understand it better. Following his example, she tried compressing three ice spikes into one, boosting the speed of her instant release. After practicing this a few times, she saw significant improvements. Nothing made Ivy happier than enhancing her own strength.

Meanwhile, her teammates, who were recovering their abilities, weren’t idle either. They were tasked with dispatching the zombies, creating an efficient assembly line. If it weren't for Ivy's innovative approaches to practicing her powers and validating her methods, this monotonous work would have been too easy to dull the senses.

Those digging into the zombies' heads likely shared similar thoughts. Who would want to remain bent over, rummaging through those yellowish, red-stained, foul-smelling remains if it weren't for the purpose of obtaining crystal cores?

The teammate whose water abilities were used to rinse the cores probably felt exhausted, thinking, "I’m completely drained, wrung out..."

The harvest in the high-rise complex was quite good. By the end of the day, they had collected over three hundred crystal cores after clearing three units. As darkness fell, they decided not to return to the stronghold. Ethan sealed the rooftop door with his abilities.

Ivy watched curiously, feeling as if Ethan had transformed into a skilled welder; that door was sealed tight!

Several earth-type ability users built an earthen wall to fortify the door and the surrounding walls, providing double protection. They no longer had to worry about water or firewood. Ivy mused that if it were summer, she could have prepared ice for everyone, and Alex could fan them with a cool breeze.

After finishing their tasks, it was time for dinner. Ivy was reluctant to eat the same dry, tasteless energy bars from lunch; their overly sweet taste dulled her palate.

She pulled out a saucepan from her backpack and had Alex fetch some canned meat. Ethan brought out a large bag of pasta. Using her water abilities, she filled the pot with water, while a fire-type teammate eagerly started the fire. They set up the pot on the rooftop, planning to make meat sauce pasta.

Disposable plates and forks were distributed, and Ethan and Mrs. Smith took on the role of chefs while the rest of them eagerly watched, their mouths watering. It may have been simple, but it smelled amazing, especially the aroma of the canned meat heating up in the pot—absolutely divine.

They boiled three pots of pasta before enough was prepared for everyone. Alex and his dad took it upon themselves to wash the pots and clean up. They didn’t let Ivy lift a finger, allowing her to rest her chin on her hand, observing the busy men. It was nice; she had more important matters to attend to.

Spreading her backpack across her lap, she sorted through the more than three hundred crystal cores they had collected that day, categorizing them by attributes and tallying the number of non-attribute cores.

When everyone had finished and gathered around again, Ivy began distributing the crystal cores. Jack had never seen such a distribution method before. In his past life, he had only received rewards after completing tasks, and crystal cores usually had to be earned through personal effort. Collective resources were rarely evenly shared.

However, he kept his thoughts to himself, recognizing that she must have her reasons for doing so.

This time, there weren’t many attribute crystal cores; splitting them among the three earth-type users left them with very little. The most abundant were the blue cores belonging to the water-type abilities, but their combat effectiveness hadn’t yet been demonstrated. Apart from relying on physical strength and weapons, they couldn't kill zombies using just their water abilities.

Ivy wasn't worried, though; once the water abilities leveled up, they would become formidable. Besides, they truly needed a strong water source to help wash the cores.

Because there were too few earth-type attribute cores, the non-attribute cores were redistributed, ensuring everyone was satisfied and that the distribution was fair.

Ivy had yet to collect any ice-type crystal cores; she even doubted if they existed. Staring at her pile of non-attribute cores, she felt distressed, wondering when she would be able to upgrade.

Jack shared her predicament, but he understood that no matter how many low-level zombies he defeated, he wouldn’t obtain mutated cores because they needed to level up too. Once they reached intermediate status, corresponding cores would emerge.

After scheduling three shifts for night watch, they spent a calm night without incident. The following days continued with the same routine of killing zombies, extracting cores, and rinsing them in an assembly line process.

They managed to clear an entire complex of zombies, surpassing a total of twelve hundred crystal cores. That night, Ivy started distributing the cores before dinner. The proportion of attribute cores remained low, but at least there were some.

After the distribution, everyone was in high spirits. With this new influx, the team's overall strength should improve significantly. Even Mrs. Smith, who had once been terrified of zombies, could now expressionlessly ensnare them using her wood abilities.

Jack treated this mission as a training exercise, correcting positioning, movement, and coordination during the cleanup, with Ethan assisting him. They were almost ready to practice formations.

On the last night in the high-rise complex, Ivy leaned against the railing, gazing into the distance. In reality, there were no lights; the darkness was thick like spilled ink, devoid of stars.

Jack approached her and stood beside her, following her gaze. After a moment, he said, “You’re so quick to distribute the crystal cores? Aren’t you afraid of raising their expectations?”

Ivy turned to look at him, smiling as she replied, “Raising their expectations isn’t ideal, but I want them to understand that following me is the right choice. There aren’t many generous leaders like me. What I can offer, others can’t. If they want more, they need to contribute more. Even if they decide to leave, I won’t be at a loss.”

“A true leader never makes a losing deal. What about the Johnson family?” 

Ivy pondered for a moment about the Johnson family, which appeared calm on the surface but was rife with undercurrents. She smiled nonchalantly. “Allies need to possess a certain strength to be considered allies. If they can’t be allies, they can be subordinates. Just like before, no one can permanently hold the leading position. Now, positions can change, and that’s fine. As for the other pests, whether I take action or not, they will be crushed one by one.”

Jack nodded, chuckling, but then he seemed to remember something. “Regarding the chaos at the Maple Forest base, Sam is convinced I’m behind it. I’ve taken a huge fall for you.”

Ivy raised her eyebrows in surprise. She had thought she had been exposed from the very beginning, especially since Lisa had recognized her right away. With Sam's cautious and suspicious nature, how could he attribute it to Jack?

Ah, that’s right. In this life, they hadn’t had any interactions yet; they hadn’t even met. When he betrayed the Smith family, she hadn’t existed. His eldest son had been shot while capturing Jack, so it made more sense for him to suspect him.

She chuckled lightly and said, “Are you afraid? Then find a way to get rid of him. I don’t believe he can escape every time.”

“Yeah, I don’t believe that either.”
