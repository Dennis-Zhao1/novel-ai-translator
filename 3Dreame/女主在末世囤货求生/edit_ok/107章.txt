**Phoenix Base Chronicles**

After some contemplation, it became evident that they couldn't reveal the true circumstances surrounding the potential-enhancing serum just yet. Their mission to Phoenix Base had two primary goals: first, to gauge the position of the base's leader, Paul Quinn, and second, to evaluate the base's actual capabilities. The fact that Paul Quinn had his eyes set on them suggested they were not to be underestimated.

A powerful base aligned with Paul's interests could easily be dealt with, but if that base was indifferent to Paul's survival, then there was ample room for negotiation. They could simply trade benefits, as long as Paul was out of the picture.

Noticing the serious expressions on their faces, Dr. Carter also sensed the precariousness of the situation and decided to keep things under wraps for now, even within their own team. Lucy Bennett hoped they could conduct more experiments or closely observe Sam, to ensure there were no adverse reactions or side effects; the development timeline for the serum had been rushed, and they needed extensive data for validation.

Ethan proposed waiting until they returned. If Sam remained healthy, they could select volunteers from the escort team to participate in the ability activation tests; surely, many would be eager.

Lucy jokingly suggested they could develop a serum that negates abilities instead, but she wasn't sure if Dr. Carter took her seriously.

Ultimately, the first vial of the ability-enhancing serum was given to Lucy. Dr. Carter looked at her with determined eyes and said, "This is the first time I've undertaken such a groundbreaking project; you absolutely must accept this first vial!"

Feeling slightly awkward under his intense gaze, Lucy quickly accepted the vial and made her exit.

Ethan shot Dr. Carter a look, gave a soft chuckle, and followed her out.

Left alone, Dr. Carter remained animated, rubbing his hands together like a child with a new toy. Sam entered the room to find his mentor celebrating as if he had just discovered a treasure, completely ignoring Sam as he returned to the data console to conduct his tests.

They set off with just one vehicle, a modified seven-seater SUV with ample space. The roof was stocked with weapons and ammunition. Mark drove, with Ethan in the passenger seat, Lucy sitting in the middle row, alongside Alex, who was sharing snacks with two team members in the back.

Ethan observed their lighthearted banter, especially Alex, who had become quite chatty, sharing amusing tales of sparring with other ability users, causing Lucy to laugh heartily. However, Ethan felt a twinge of annoyance—how could they have snacks and not share any with him? Did they really not see him sitting there?

Not wanting to appear petty in front of the team members, he maintained a composed demeanor and directed Mark on their route.

Phoenix Base wasn't located in the capital city but rather near it, in Springfield. There was only the Phoenix Base there, a large-scale facility with a substantial number of ability users, but even more ordinary people.

Paul Quinn had been a businessman in Springfield before the apocalypse, but he was also the leader of an underground organization. He emerged from the criminal underworld and went legitimate, dabbling in real estate and entertainment, while being savvy in finance. He managed to acquire funds through legitimate channels, paying taxes properly, and more importantly, he knew how to conduct himself with propriety. Even being so close to the capital, authorities turned a blind eye to him; after all, numerous inspections had failed to find any wrongdoing.

Those who conspired against him were dealt with swiftly, leading to the core team at Phoenix Base being largely comprised of his former associates, all of whom had made names for themselves in their respective industries—far from the small-time thugs fighting over street corners.

Thinking about this trip to Phoenix Base, Ethan felt a flicker of hope; perhaps he'd run into an old friend, and maybe he could convince him to leave, helping him avoid a certain fate.

He glanced over at Lucy, who was now munching on spicy beef jerky, expressionlessly extending her hand, making it impossible for him to ignore his request.

Rolling her eyes, she begrudgingly handed him a piece of jerky. Not angered, Ethan took it and began to munch.

Lucy then turned to assemble a plate of vegetarian snacks made from kale chips, edamame, potato chips, and lotus slices, handing a bottle of her specially chilled soda to Alex, who was tearing up from the spiciness. She couldn’t help but laugh along with the team members in the back, teasing Alex about how he, a New Orleans native, couldn’t handle spicy food.

When she looked up again, she saw Ethan's hand pointing at the soda, making a gesture as if to ask for it. This time, she shot him a glare but ultimately relented and passed him a bottle.

Mark watched the group eating and drinking through the rearview mirror, feeling a bit left out. Before he could comment, Alex shoved a half-eaten piece of jerky into Mark's mouth.

"Here, Mark, you eat it! I can't take this heat anymore; it’s killing me!" Alex exclaimed, guzzling the soda while wiping away tears, glancing enviously at the others who were still enjoying their snacks.

"Unfair! Why are you all so good at eating spicy food? What’s wrong with me?" 

Without even turning around, Ethan coolly remarked, "Some people just can’t handle their spice; a little brother is just a little brother."

His teasing sent everyone into fits of laughter, while Alex nearly exploded with frustration. Thankfully, Lucy quickly handed him a five-spice marinated egg to calm him down.

"Lucy, your abilities are too powerful! Why do I only have one ability? I’m so envious!" 

Seeing that the marinated egg couldn’t sufficiently silence Alex, Lucy decided to dig out some homemade sticky rice balls she had stashed away and stuffed one into his mouth.

The world went quiet except for Alex, whose mouth was now stuck shut with the sticky rice ball, making him whine helplessly.

Ethan nearly burst out laughing but coughed lightly into his fist to cover it up.

Their journey was not without obstacles; the city’s ring road had been cleared before, but after the last wave of zombie attacks, the road conditions were far from ideal. Luckily, among their two team members was a terrain manipulator who used quite a few resources to restore some level of smoothness to the road.

Mark supervised the operation while Lucy and Alex cleared the zombies that wandered too close, which now were far more resilient and had abilities of their own. They seemed well aware of their surroundings, and before Lucy could even spot them, they were already drawn to the sound of the vehicle.

As they moved along, clearing zombies and collecting resources, what should have taken an hour stretched into half a day due to the constant stops and starts.

Eventually, they exited the highway and meandered through the city until Ethan pointed out a building, announcing, "We’re here."

Lucy looked up, realizing that Phoenix Base had actually been converted from the Phoenix Tower!

Suddenly reminded of her own projects, Ethan explained as he saw her lost in thought, "On the day of the outbreak, Paul Quinn happened to be holding a shareholders' meeting in Phoenix Tower with his core team. When the zombies attacked, he decisively took out a number of them and organized a resource search, sheltering many survivors. He reacted faster than the government, which greatly boosted his reputation locally. Our fortress hasn’t had anyone from Springfield come to seek refuge because their first choice has always been Phoenix Base."

Lucy nodded in understanding. Paul was indeed a strong leader with sharp decision-making skills, which explained why in her previous life, he overshadowed other bases and became the top base.

Just as their vehicle approached the main entrance of Phoenix Tower, a group of ability users suddenly surrounded them. Mark and Ethan reacted instantly; one slammed the brakes while the other quickly launched an electric net, startling the opposing ability users.

Before long, a striking woman with long hair emerged from among the ability users. In the early June heat, she wore a tight black top, faded blue overalls, and flat black boots, her figure striking and her demeanor commanding. However, her expression was less than pleasant as she approached and ordered them to leave.

Lucy was momentarily taken aback; she assumed Ethan had previously angered this woman, and now he was being confronted directly. To her surprise, Ethan looked just as bewildered.

Just then, the woman launched a fireball toward them. Ethan responded with a precise bolt of lightning that extinguished the fireball mid-flight.

With her ability interrupted, the woman now focused intently on their vehicle, her gaze locked in.

It felt as if time had stopped for everyone present, with Alex readying his wind blades, waiting for the signal. What would happen next? Would they fight or not? This group was really driving him crazy!
