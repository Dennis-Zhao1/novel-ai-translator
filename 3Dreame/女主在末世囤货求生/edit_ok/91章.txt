**Stirring the Pot**

When Ethan's team of skilled individuals became adept at handling tasks independently, he assigned them missions to team up and venture out for resource collection, such as hunting zombies, gathering crystal cores, and securing supplies.

Meanwhile, the arsenal from Chris's hidden storage was cleverly disguised and made available for the team members to exchange for points, further incentivizing their efforts.

Ethan and Jake rarely embarked on missions together, but Chris would sometimes accompany one of them to evaluate the team's progress. The zombies had evolved, and the crystal cores they collected for missions were now at least grade two, complete with unique attributes. Despite this, ice attribute cores were still exceptionally rare. Yet, Chris's abilities had advanced, defying the expectations of many.

One evening, after entering her personal sanctuary, Ivy discovered that after a long two-month interval, her space had finally upgraded. It now resembled a mystical realm from a fantasy novel, full of intrigue and wonder.

At first glance, the transformation seemed subtle, but with a closer look, the changes were evident. A newly framed mirror, adorned with the words "Mystic View," appeared, adding a touch of ancient elegance.

The screen of the Mystic View had expanded significantly. It still featured a split display, with a sundial occupying one-third of the space. The remaining area was now a dialogue box, with the upper section awaiting further discoveries. The dialogue read: "Upgrade complete, explore at your leisure."

With playful disdain, as if teasing the mirror for showing off, Ivy surveyed her expanded domain. What was once a large area now seemed endless. Distant hills had transformed into rolling green mountains, lush and verdant.

The faint rush of a waterfall reached her ears. The small pond she once knew had grown into a substantial lake, making her previous markers seem out of place.

The wheat seeds she'd accidentally scattered had matured into a golden field, their sturdy stalks swaying gently in the breeze, inviting her to draw closer.

Ivy touched the heavy wheat heads, deciding to harvest them later when she needed flour—not in a rush.

Unfamiliar trees in her space had grown taller and sturdier. She experimented by transplanting fruit tree seedlings from their base's back mountain to see how long it would take for them to bear fruit.

Cattle and sheep had given birth to young ones, naturally expanding their numbers. They roamed freely, with plenty of meat still in storage, even canned goods remaining untouched.

With the recent influx of newcomers, they had gradually depleted a large stockpile of eggs and rabbits. This brought immense joy to Ivy, who once despaired at the sight of baskets of unhatched eggs and rabbits everywhere.

The most significant change, however, was the spiritual energy within the space. After the last upgrade, the overwhelming energy left Ivy faint, but upon re-entering, she felt no discomfort.

Instead, the energy flowed through her, a warm sensation soothing her entirely. Her mental strength quickly recovered, allowing her to freely expend her powers, becoming a perpetual motion machine. Her training yielded remarkable results, and she became more adept at utilizing her abilities. Without realizing it, her mental power surged to level three, and she developed a unique skill set for releasing her ice powers. By intense exploration, she mimicked the attack style of traditional hidden weapons: "Rain of Ice Needles."

If ice spikes were single-target damage, then the Rain of Ice Needles represented area damage. With greater mental power, the ice needles became as hard as steel, covering a larger area. Once melted, they left no trace, allowing her to strike unnoticed—much like a shotgun's effect.

She also experimented with dual-handed techniques, using one hand for attack and the other for defense, forming an icy armor to withstand incoming attacks. This sufficed against ordinary abilities, but against equally ranked opponents, she needed to attack proactively or evade their skills.

Without many ice attribute crystal cores, she opened new possibilities through mental power enhancement. Perhaps ordinary people could become extraordinary too.

Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of the apocalypse fortress transformed what was once an idyllic sanctuary into a battleground for resources against other bases, naturally attracting unsavory characters with various schemes.

Ivy no longer feared these plots; in fact, she welcomed the opportunity for conflict. The enemies embedded within the fortress as spies needed a chance to be uprooted.

Returning to the fortress, Jake brought news that the eldest son of a rival base leader was hosting an engagement banquet, inviting many leaders and strong individuals from other bases. Invitations had been sent out.

This engagement ceremony was not merely about celebration but also a means to bolster influence and power. Given previous entanglements, it was unlikely the fortress would receive an invitation. It was possible the banquet could incite alliances against the fortress.

Hearing this, Ivy lowered her gaze, a cold smile playing on her lips. She wondered who was fated to marry that scoundrel this time—likely another daughter of a powerful family, as the rival leader always pursued power and status, much like in her past experiences.

After pondering briefly, Ivy looked at Jake and said, “This engagement banquet might not be as straightforward as it seems. What do you think? Should we stir up some trouble?”

Jake had already considered this and wanted to confirm Ivy's thoughts. He nodded and said, “Stirring up trouble is definitely on the agenda.”

“Great! How about we take advantage of the chaos and launch a surprise attack?” 

Jake, infected by Ivy's mischievous grin, joined her in finalizing their plan. They decided to leave Ethan in charge while Uncle Joe and Lisa assisted with daily operations. Under the guise of collecting crystal cores, they led a team out in broad daylight.

From the start, they noticed undisguised spies from unknown forces tailing them. After several attempts to shake them off using zombies, they finally managed to lose their pursuers. Midway, they coordinated with their team, assigning the vice-captain to lead the others. Ivy planned to sneak into the rival base alone, and Jake had the same intention. They seemed to leave together but separated midway.

After disguising herself, Ivy climbed into the oldest, beat-up van in her space, filling it with near-expired supplies, purposefully making herself look shabby as she headed toward the rival base.

Originally, the base only accepted gifted individuals, making it unthinkable for ordinary people to join. However, the fortress had cleverly adapted the rule to allow two ordinary people to accompany each gifted individual, leading many to switch allegiance to the fortress. This changed the dynamic, as the rival base's ranks dwindled, forcing them to accept ordinary people to retain their gifted members.

When Ivy, looking worn and weary, arrived at the base gates in her van, there were less than three days until the engagement ceremony. She needed to gather information quickly to set everything up before the event.

The base, a former military district, exuded reliability with its towering walls and strict guards. Today marked the second day they allowed ordinary people entry, resulting in long queues.

After an hour and a half of stop-and-go traffic, it was finally her turn.

Clutching Lisa’s identification, Ivy had altered her appearance to resemble Lisa's features. When the guards checked her ID, they scrutinized it carefully and asked questions beyond the information provided.

Fortunately, Ivy had communicated with Lisa before departing and knew many details about her life, allowing her to answer smoothly. Expecting a bribe, Ivy discreetly slipped two packs of cigarettes and a chocolate bar to the guards.

These items were scarce commodities in the apocalypse. The guards acknowledged her savvy approach, clearing their throats as they pocketed the items, handing her a pass and waving her through.

Just then, a female voice called out: “Wait a moment!”

Ivy turned toward the sound, her pupils narrowing in shock.

“It’s her!”
