**No Unprepared Battles**

After confirming there were no restrictions on coming and going, Ivy Bennett finally felt the gnawing pangs of hunger settle in.

Her phone read 8:17 PM, well past her regular dinner time. During the apocalypse, she rarely felt hunger, a stark contrast to her current life. Since her grandfather passed away, Ivy preferred solitude, keeping only a couple of assistants who came by to help with cooking and cleaning. The old family estate had been reduced to just essentials, and now she lived in a cozy apartment, with her assistants on a schedule.

Her thoughts drifted back to the doorbell that had woken her earlier. Could it have been one of the assistants coming to prepare dinner? Sure enough, she checked her messages and found one saying they assumed Ivy wasn’t home. After waiting for half an hour with no response, they left a message saying they would head back.

Feeling a bit embarrassed and apologetic, Ivy replied to the assistant and sent a small bonus as a gesture of goodwill. She made sure to slip on her slippers this time; the cut on her foot wasn’t serious, but she quickly treated it before summoning the cleaning robot to sweep up the glass shards. After that, she headed straight to the kitchen.

Opening the fridge, she noted the fresh ingredients, courtesy of her assistants who restocked them daily. The fridge only held a few drinks and some eggs, so she moved to the freezer, stocked with frozen items. Neatly packed dumplings and wontons, prepared by the assistants, were arranged like a store display.

Shelves! She thought about the barren yellow land in her space, realizing she needed to set up some sort of storage; otherwise, accessing her supplies would be inconvenient.

As she pondered over her storage plans, her hands instinctively gathered ingredients for a meal, determined to satisfy her hunger. The dumplings were fragrant, and with each sip of her soda, she felt so happy that her toes curled in delight. Yet, deep down, she wished the assistants would make more dumplings—enough to last her through the apocalypse, when she could eat to her heart's content.

Her speed at eating was still influenced by her experiences during the apocalypse; she finished much faster than she used to. After clearing the dining table, she glanced at the dishwasher and the cleaning robot recharging itself at the base, marveling at how much happiness technology brought to her life.

The impending apocalypse was unavoidable, but if she had a second chance, she would cherish it, planning carefully to avoid any unprepared battles.

With this thought in mind, Ivy poured herself a cup of coffee and began strategizing in her study. After all, she had only experienced a few years of the apocalypse; when the zombie outbreak occurred, she was at the family estate, surrounded by people who had fought alongside her grandfather and watched over her as she grew up.

Had it not been for their protection, she might have been overwhelmed by the zombie tide, unable to reach safety. Many of them later discovered their own abilities, while some remained ordinary like her. However, after the class divide emerged, they were all fragmented and weakened by that conniving Ethan, leaving her without any allies.

Not wanting to dwell on those thoughts, she took a sip of her coffee and focused on organizing her supplies. Suddenly, her mind was flooded with ideas, making it hard to find any logical order.

Determined to avoid chaotic thinking, Ivy opened a blue app on her phone. It was filled with highly educated individuals. Entering keywords related to survival during an apocalypse, she quickly found a plethora of creative discussions.

Clicking on the most popular topic, she was amazed to find a highly-upvoted answer that included a detailed supply list formatted as a mind map. The post had been published two years ago and updated over the following months.

What a genius! After finishing her coffee, Ivy compared her plans with the mind map. She was surprised to see it included hot weapons and military equipment, which would be challenging to acquire.

Pushing aside the thought that the person behind the post might also be a reincarnator, she chuckled at herself and turned her focus to the section about daily essentials.

The list was incredibly comprehensive, detailing everything from clothing and food to disaster relief supplies, medicine, and sanitary products, all clearly categorized and suggesting preferences based on gender and circumstances. There were even must-have items, like sanitary pads.

Intrigued, Ivy began to read through the comments. The top comment read, “According to this list, I’d have to be the richest person in America!” Beneath it, a chorus of replies echoed the sentiment of being unable to afford it, prompting Ivy to pull out her phone and check her available funds.

Although she was the sole heir to America’s top jewelry brand, and her family business had a history of several hundred years with substantial assets, her liquid cash was still limited to a few minor goals.

There was nothing to be done; after graduating from a prestigious school with a degree in jewelry design, she reluctantly took on the role of CEO, relying heavily on her staff and a few assistants to help manage the company.

Her other businesses were handled by professional managers, who reported quarterly and annually. Since taking over, she had grown disinterested in managing those earnings; otherwise, her liquid funds would likely be even less.

With the apocalypse looming, her assets would soon dwindle to worthless scraps. Looking at the total amount on the genius's list, she realized that she would need to prepare for at least dozens of minor goals to gather everything.

She didn’t want to let down the people her grandfather had left behind. They had all contributed to her survival in one way or another, and some had even sacrificed themselves for her. She didn’t want this life to end up the same way.

As for the connections and resources her grandfather had left her, Ivy chuckled to herself. If it weren't for her surname and the fact that people valued their promises, who would pay her any attention in the morally bankrupt world of the apocalypse?

Realizing she had let her thoughts wander too far again, Ivy contacted her executive assistant to compile a list of her assets.

Her assistant had long since gotten used to Ivy’s unpredictable work hours, and for the sake of a high salary, he followed her every instruction. The more tasks he was assigned, the more it reinforced his importance to Ivy, as if he were her central processing unit.

Work was work; what was there to fear about complexity? He wasn’t the only assistant available. With a few quick strokes, he organized the tasks based on the different industries of her assets, collaborating with several others to complete Ivy’s requests.

Ivy printed out the genius's mind map, categorizing it with different colored file tabs before placing it all into one folder. The list of hot weapons and military equipment was kept in a separate file at the back.

Feeling particularly pleased with herself for having borrowed from the genius’s work, Ivy took her glass of red wine and strolled out onto the balcony. Living in a spacious apartment had many perks, but nothing captivated her heart quite like the breathtaking view it offered.

Before her, the city was ablaze with neon lights, skyscrapers piercing the clouds. Little did anyone know that a month later, the apocalypse would arrive, bringing hordes of zombies and chaos across the world…

Moreover, the genius's post had predicted extreme weather events, such as extreme heat, severe cold, eternal night, earthquakes, and tsunamis. Looking at the robust city before her, how long could it withstand such natural disasters?

Feeling a twinge of melancholy but with her gaze becoming increasingly resolute, she reflected on how well she had managed in her previous life without any preparation. In this life, things would only get better. Holding onto this hope and expectation, Ivy raised her glass in a toast to the cityscape before her, smiling brightly in the night.
