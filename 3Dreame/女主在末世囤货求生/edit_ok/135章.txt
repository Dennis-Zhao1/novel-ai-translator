**No Trash Abilities**

After dinner, a group of ability users were casually chatting, speculating on who would be the first to awaken, what powers they might get, and their initial levels. What began as a lighthearted discussion gradually evolved into a betting game, with stakes as low as a second or third-level crystal core or some snacks like cookies or tissues.

Logan didn't discourage this behavior; after all, a little gambling could lift spirits. The more people engaged, the stronger their sense of unity would be, and eventually, they would all become ability users, fighting side by side to protect the community.

No one expected the biggest gambler to be Andy. Always lively and eager to join in on the fun, he organized this betting pool. Logan secretly chuckled at the thought that Andy might end up losing all his money, but Andy just grinned, treating it like a welfare program. Though he joked about needing a little financial support if he lost too much, he still hinted that he didn’t want to end up with nothing.

Since Logan had a special advantage, he automatically withdrew from the betting. Dr. Carter, Lucy, and a few others were tasked with monitoring data, and they were prohibited from participating or sharing answers, leaving them with expressions of exasperation.

To everyone’s surprise, the first one to wake up was one of the two girls, a young woman named Wendy. She had come to the community with her brother, who had a water-based ability and had been helping in the kitchen. Just barely twenty, she was one of the early recipients of the awakening serum and had fallen into a feverish coma shortly after. It seemed those who passed out early might also wake up early.

The unexpected jackpot left everyone else feeling like losers, except for Andy, who was all smiles—at least he hadn’t lost everything. After bringing her out, he arranged for her to eat and wash up. After sleeping for a day and a night, Wendy felt sore all over, and the sweat she had worked up had a slightly sour smell. Embarrassed, she received a big bear hug from her goofy brother, who cheered her on before they started testing her abilities.

They used targets in the training room, and Wendy focused intently, raising her hand to unleash a shard of ice. Logan couldn't help but smile softly.

“Wow, it’s a mutated ability, just like Logan’s! The awakening serum is amazing!”

“Seriously? A mutated ability? Oh man, the first one is a mutated ability. What if everyone who received the serum becomes a mutated ability user?”

“I have no idea... if that’s true, then...”

Dr. Carter calmly recorded Wendy’s abilities and announced to everyone, “Wendy has awakened with a mutated ice-type ability at initial level two.”

Buzzing discussions erupted among the crowd. Some keen observers noticed the expressions of certain ability users darkening. In this apocalyptic world, strength reigned supreme, and the awakening serum had given ordinary people a head start over those who had awakened naturally. Some began to recall the words of Ethan, who had defected from the community.

Although some had seen Ethan return with Zoe once, they still believed the negotiations had failed. Ethan was truly someone who thought from the perspective of the ability users.

Inwardly, some felt a twinge of dissatisfaction towards Logan. However, family members of ordinary ability users didn’t share this sentiment, particularly Wendy's brother, who was practically in tears, clutching his sister’s hand and declaring that he would give all his crystal cores to her, proudly saying his sister was successful and had brought honor to the family.

Logan and the others observed these mixed emotions in silence, remaining impassive.

Those who had guessed wrong about the ability type began to lament, realizing their cookies and tissues would soon be scooped up by the grinning Andy.

Only a few who had correctly guessed the initial levels were in high spirits, feeling like they hadn’t lost too much.

The second to awaken was a boy who had just turned eighteen, a younger member of the Johnson family, though he didn’t actually bear the Johnson surname. Logan had seen him a few times at the family estate; he was the child of the Johnson family’s second aunt. The Johnson family was large, and he was the youngest left, following the death of his uncle’s son.

When the apocalypse first hit, he had just turned sixteen and hadn’t participated in any rescue missions with Logan and the others, so they weren’t very familiar with each other.

Upon waking, his second aunt burst into tears, hugging him tightly and repeatedly saying, “If your grandfather could see you, he would be so happy.”

This drew a wave of sentiment from the Johnson family members. After a normal wash-up and meal, they saw he looked quite spirited. They initially planned to test abilities once everyone had awakened, but Johnny immediately insisted on testing him.

Coincidentally, he had also awakened a fire-type ability, marking the third fire-type user in the Johnson family.

Someone suddenly quipped, “Does the Johnson family have a genetic predisposition for fire abilities? Can abilities actually be inherited?”

Laughter erupted among the group at the absurdity of such a notion.

With the second awakening being another ordinary ability, the tension among the ability users eased slightly. It would be tough if they were all mutated ability users; that would be seriously discouraging.

As night fell, many returned to rest, but the families of the awakened were reluctant to miss witnessing their loved ones’ awakening moments and stubbornly remained below.

One by one, members of the guard team began to awaken. This time, not just one or two, but several awakened in quick succession. Logan instructed Mrs. Lewis and the kitchen staff to prepare food and have it ready.

The captain of the guard awakened in the middle of the night, exchanging smiles with his teammates. The feeling of power was exhilarating.

After completing the process, he eagerly began to demonstrate his abilities. Most were ordinary elemental powers, but two additional metal-type abilities emerged, filling a gap in their team. The captain himself was an earth-type user and felt slightly let down; he had heard about a mutated ability user being a girl, and it seemed like discovering them also required some luck.

By four o'clock the next morning, half of the thirty awakened had come to, and Logan was feeling tired. He noticed Fred waking up next door. He quietly entered the room, standing by the bed and waiting for him to awaken.

The crystal cores really had formed well. In fact, Logan could tell at a glance what Fred’s ability was; the colors made it easy to distinguish. Fred had a wood-type ability, which was unfortunate since he had hoped for a more offensive power. Heaven had given him wood-type instead.

But it was still better than water-type; at least level three water-type users didn’t have an advantage in combat. Wood-type could at least entangle and restrict—better than nothing.

As Logan had expected, Fred’s expression shifted from exhilaration upon discovering he was a level two wood-type ability user to deep disappointment, his mood changing faster than any woman’s.

His innate talent and physique were indeed lacking; he was even inferior to the girls in the community. However, with his identity and resources, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to improve. Mr. Brooks would surely be willing to support his only son with abilities.

Logan wasn’t interested in comforting him; he suggested that Fred take this opportunity to return to his residence or leave the community altogether, as the transaction was complete, and staying wouldn’t be beneficial.

Fred seemed to ignore him entirely. Logan didn’t push him; if he wanted to stay, then let him. Without saying much, he turned to leave.

As he reached the door, he looked back and said, “There are no trash abilities, only trash ability users. Wood-type can also be very powerful.”

Fred finally snapped out of his daze, watching Logan’s departing figure, lost in thought.

Is that really true? Can wood-type truly be powerful?
