**Rising Ashes**

Both of them exclaimed in unison, their voices tinged with surprise. If it weren't for Ethan's earlier caution, Alex would have rushed in to join the action, his curiosity getting the better of him.

Feeling a surge of impatience with no further explanation, he called out, "What’s going on? Is something happening?"

Once again, there was no response. A wave of heat rolled in from behind, startling him into action. He quickly used his wind manipulation ability to blow the hot air toward Ethan and the others. Ironically, this turned out to be the right move, as it helped Ethan and his team spread the flames further, with the increased wind speed feeding more oxygen to the fire, making it blaze even more fiercely.

Alex was quite the little firestarter.

Ethan felt goosebumps rising under his fireproof suit, a shiver of dread coursing through him. He couldn't find the right words to describe the horrifying sight they had just witnessed. If the black widow spider was a nightmare, then these creatures were a descent into hell. It was enough to trigger a full-blown panic in anyone suffering from claustrophobia, leaving ordinary folks in sheer terror.

They had switched into new fireproof suits, and the non-slip shoes they wore felt uncomfortable, slick, and sticky against the ground. At first, it was manageable, but once the fire of the Flame Dragon illuminated the space, they discovered the walls and ceiling crawling with an overwhelming mass of worms—like maggots and caterpillars, their grayish-black bodies adorned with bright yellow spots. Under the flickering flames, the writhing bodies and the surrounding slime were nothing short of revolting. The sheer density of them sent chills and a prickling dread straight to Ethan's scalp.

Jake, who prided himself on being well-traveled and knowledgeable, couldn't help but tremble. What on earth were these things? Who in their right mind played around with maggots?

He couldn't help but internally scoff; it was utterly disgusting. He would rather wrestle with giant pythons and crocodiles in a tropical jungle than face these creeping, non-biting, non-stinging creatures.

The two of them stood there, silently blasting flames at the worms, unsure if the slime was hindering their efforts. The fire simply wouldn’t catch properly unless aimed directly at the worms. Thankfully, these creatures weren't aggressive; otherwise, they would be in serious trouble.

It was only a matter of time before they cleared this mess. Initially, Ethan had considered bypassing the swarm, but his keen eye caught sight of a rubber band that had been corroded by the slime, revealing just how dangerous these worms were.

Fortunately, the fireproof suits they wore were obtained from a specialized shop, completely resistant to corrosion—perfectly suited for this challenge.

This was such an obvious trap, layer upon layer, designed to block their mental faculties and ensure they were trapped here forever. Yet, to his surprise, Max had made it to the third floor, witnessing all this unfold through a remote system, his heart racing with both anxiety and anger.

How could this be? He had painstakingly set up so many traps, waiting for the perfect moment to ensnare them, and they had passed through so easily!

It was as if the system knew his inner turmoil, calmly assuring him, “Don’t worry, Max. Below are just a few insignificant pests. No harm done.”

That same old reassurance. Max closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. He understood that everything he wanted depended on the system now. Gone was his previous arrogance, replaced by a growing respect and humility.

The system, well aware of his thoughts, had initially bound itself to him because it recognized his ability to read the situation and his naïve aspirations.

Dreams were the rarest treasure these days, weren't they?

As the system soothed Max, it also set up various traps that he deemed utterly pointless. Aside from being disgusting, they posed little threat.

He couldn't bring himself to voice his concerns, and the system wouldn’t provide answers unless prompted. So, he continued to watch, not needing to confer further.

After about forty minutes, Jake was still holding up, but Ethan was starting to struggle. Although the weight wasn’t unbearable, maintaining his position for so long had left his arms stiff and sore.

He had to admit that he lacked the talent for monotonous, assembly-line work. This mindless, tedious task was clearly not his forte.

In reality, they hadn’t cleared much of the swarm. Ethan, frustrated, patted Jake on the shoulder, signaling him to check on Alex and the others.

Alex had long been itching to join the excitement. Upon seeing Jake and Ethan coming down, he immediately urged Jake to take over, eager to head up himself and see what was happening.

“Just a heads up, there are corrosive substances up there. Don’t get too close, or I can’t predict what might happen,” Ethan warned, gripping the back of his collar before releasing him, leaning against a clean wall to rest. His brows were still tightly knit as he pondered how to handle those disgusting worms.

“Holy cow!” 

Moments later, Alex shouted, racing back down the stairs, his finger pointing upward, but he was too flabbergasted to articulate his thoughts.

“Spit it out! You’ve only taken a few steps; how are you already out of breath?” 

“Ethan, there are so many maggots up there! It’s absolutely revolting!”

“Didn’t you just say you liked disgusting things? Who was it that wanted to go up there and take a look?”

“Hey, I enjoy watching the chaos, not looking at maggots! Those things need to be wiped out with a bucket of lime!”

“Lime?” 

“Yeah! Back when my grandma was still around, if we found maggots at home, she’d just sprinkle some lime on them, and they’d be dead in no time!”

“Is it really that effective?” 

“Absolutely! The older generations have their tricks. Salt works too, but it’s too pricey. Lime is much cheaper!”

Ethan stroked his chin, considering Alex's suggestion. It was time to show some real skills.

He had stockpiled a large supply of lime, leftover from his plans to build a fortress that had gone unused. Apart from lime, he had plenty of other building materials, but lime was in the highest quantity.

Casually, he pulled out several bags of lime and placed them on the ground, instructing Alex to use his powers to spread it around. He even handed him a set of protective gear and goggles from Max's personal stash to ensure he wouldn’t get any lime on himself or in his eyes while working.

Although Alex found the worms utterly revolting, there was no one else to do this job; after all, he was the walking wind machine.

Ethan wasn’t about to forget to share the plan with Jake and the others, earning him a few well-deserved praises.

Alex protested, “This brilliant solution was my idea; I should be the one getting the credit!”

He received nothing but a few half-hearted compliments in return.

The wind machine was clearly irked. He was determined to show everyone just how powerful his ability was and how clever he could be. Once geared up, he grabbed two bags of lime and dashed up the stairs, with Ethan hot on his heels. He wasn’t worried about Alex’s performance; he just wanted to see if his grandma's method truly worked.

Could insecticide be effective too? After all, they were all just bugs, right?

Before he could contemplate further, he saw Alex toss a bag of lime into the air. As it fell, the wind blades he conjured shredded the bag, and he immediately unleashed his power, scattering lime everywhere.

The impact of two bags landing in such a dense mass of worms yielded minimal results. Ultimately, the outcome was an increase in the slime surrounding the worms, which did nothing to kill them as Alex had claimed.

After finishing one bag, Alex immediately grabbed and dispersed the second bag, and the effect was instantly different. Ethan noticed that the slime, which had originally been slightly transparent with a hint of gray-green, was now yellow-brown after being mixed with lime. What was going on here?
