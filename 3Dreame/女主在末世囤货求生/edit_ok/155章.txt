**Injured Team Leader**

“Hey, what are you doing over there? Get behind me, now!” 

Serena quickly yanked Ethan Smith back, shielding him from the danger ahead. The walls were crawling with mutated plants, their tendrils wrapping around the legs of unlucky bystanders. If they hadn’t reacted so swiftly, they might have been caught too.

The sharp smell of gasoline filled the air as a barrel tipped over. When the flamethrower was ignited, a fierce blaze shot out, scorching the bizarre "sea urchin" creatures that were part of the chaos.

Serena stood her ground, keeping Ethan safe as she scanned their makeshift arsenal. Guns were their mainstay, but the real heavy-hitters like the rocket launcher were not ideal for this close-quarters fight. Missiles? They’d just end up blowing the whole place to smithereens.

“Ethan, got any weapons on your side that might help?”

“What?” 

Serena leaned in closer, but the difference in their heights made it tricky. Ethan was nearly six and a half feet tall, and she was barely five foot five. She had to stretch up on her toes to whisper without drawing too much attention.

She clung to his shoulder, repeating her question close to his ear.

Feeling her breath, Ethan tensed for a moment before registering her words.

“Not enough points yet, but taking down these plants will earn me some. I’ll handle a few more.” 

Serena nodded, understanding that Ethan’s abilities were tied to the tasks he completed in this world.

As her ice spikes dissolved in the flames, she and their water-type ally stood by, watching. Meanwhile, Ethan and their teammate, Max Carter, were busy keeping the chaos at bay.

Max was in his element. As a kid, he’d been scolded for playing with fire, but now he was fully in his element, showing off his skills in front of his dad and aunt.

The scene was a testament to fire-type abilities, while the earth-type users built barricades to slow the advancing plants. Unsurprisingly, the plants broke through the barriers—they were, after all, born from the earth itself.

Made sense.

Wood-type abilities struggled against these mutated plants. They were outclassed, their damage minimal in comparison, especially with only a few high-level wood users around.

The fire raged on for nearly an hour. By the time Serena had used up most of the gasoline, the flamethrower was running dry. Thankfully, the threat of the mutated plants had diminished. Ethan and Max, replenished by the energy they’d absorbed, stepped in to finish the job.

Just as everyone thought it was over, Serena noticed something off. She pointed her flashlight in another direction, her palms growing sweaty with unease.

“Ethan, come here.” 

Her voice wavered, but Ethan, always attuned to Serena, came over. “What’s up?” 

She pointed to the illuminated spot. “Over there, look.”

Ethan followed her gaze, spotting a massive plant at the base of the city wall. Its most notable feature was a dark red bud, veins snaking around it as if something inside was struggling to escape.

“What is that?” he asked quietly.

“I don’t know, but it gives me a bad feeling.”

As she spoke, a vine shot towards Serena’s face.

Ethan reacted instantly, sending a bolt of lightning at it. Serena, flamethrower in hand, was ready to torch it.

Unexpectedly, Ethan's lightning traveled down the vine, straight to the bud. Silver-blue arcs of energy crackled through the veins, causing the bud to thrash violently. Just as Serena was about to take a closer look, the bud burst with a pop, sending a flurry of black seeds hurtling towards her.

She instinctively grabbed Ethan, swiftly dodging the barrage.

“Ugh!”

Ethan grunted, momentarily thrown off balance. Serena steadied him, her heart pounding. “Ethan, are you hurt?”

Ethan leaned heavily against her, his legs giving way beneath him.

A quick glance revealed a nasty bruise on his arm, dark and red—poisoned.

Those seeds were toxic! How vile.

Serena rifled through her supplies for an antidote, coming up short. She did find some antibiotics. Seeing Ethan’s paling face, his eyes fluttering shut, she forced herself to stay calm.

Wait! The lake water! She grabbed a jug and prepped it for Ethan.

But Ethan was fading fast, his breathing labored. In a rush, Serena injected him with a modified antidote, splashing some lake water on his wound. As he winced, she tilted the jug to his lips, coaxing the water into his mouth.

Finally, after a struggle, Ethan managed to swallow. Once he was drinking, she took a sip herself, feeling a wave of relief.

Thankfully, nothing more emerged from the bud’s explosion, but what had it unleashed? What kind of toxin was that?

Max sensed something was wrong and joined the fray, finding Ethan slumped on the ground, his head on Serena’s shoulder, pale and unconscious. He couldn’t tell if Ethan was merely out cold or worse.

“Serena, what happened?” 

Max inquired softly.

“There was a mutated plant. When it exploded, it released toxic seeds. Ethan got hit while protecting me.”

She explained swiftly, urging Max to inform the team, including Mr. Johnson, to handle the cleanup. The black debris shouldn’t be touched barehanded; it needed careful collection and analysis by Dr. Carter.

Max hurried off to relay the message, but when he returned, both Serena and Ethan were nowhere to be found.

By then, Serena had already moved Ethan to a safer space. She wondered if his system could still connect while he was unconscious. Calling out, the screen above flickered to life.

“Hey, Serena! Long time no see!” 

Though the system saw and heard Serena daily, it felt like a reunion.

“Is Ethan okay?” 

Her voice shook with concern. She’d never seen such a strong man look so fragile.

“He’ll be alright! It’s a badge of honor, getting hurt while protecting you. Don’t fret, Serena, he’s a tough cookie! He’ll be around for a long while!” 

The system’s cheerful tone suggested Ethan wasn’t in any real danger.

“Thank goodness! You scared me there.” 

“Worried about him, are you?” 

The system teased, but didn’t wait for an answer.

Serena was already moving Ethan to the old house.

Maybe it was the nature of this space, but moving him felt effortless. Outside, she wouldn’t have been able to lift him.

“If you don’t answer, I’ll take that as a yes! Hehe!”
