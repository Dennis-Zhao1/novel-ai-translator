"Do you want the short version? I’m not up for chit-chat."

"Five thousand points, and not a penny more."

The Noisy Ghost was making a last-ditch effort; it was do-or-die time. The main system had a liking for it, so no matter the cost, it had to be acquired.

"You said you’d double the points."

"Yeah, I said double."

"Alright, then give me forty thousand points."

Ethan grinned slightly as he spoke to Ivy, "I traded four seeds for forty thousand points. Now I can get that air gun."

Ivy's eyes widened in surprise. "Why are the seeds suddenly worth so much? Didn’t the last system update mean points were worth less?"

Ethan nodded, a hint of pride in his voice. "I tried doing business your way, and I seem to have caught on pretty well."

Ivy's attention shifted to the air gun. She glanced at the jar in her hands and suggested, "How about this? Keep two seeds for Dr. Smith to study later, and exchange the rest for points. This thing is too risky; it shouldn’t be left lying around."

Ethan nodded in agreement. Ivy took out a crystal storage box she had previously used for jewelry. Following advice from a friend, she used a pair of tongs to pick out the seeds, specifically choosing those without sprout points and with thicker skins, thinking it would be safer that way.

She handed all the remaining seeds, jar included, to Ethan. "Make sure to count how many there are. If they’re ten thousand points each, then exchange them all."

"Got it. Besides the air gun, is there anything else you want?"

"Is the air gun for me?" Ivy was a bit surprised; she thought it was for Ethan himself.

"Of course! Didn't you mention wanting one last time? We should be able to exchange for quite a few things now. Let me know if there's anything else you want."

Ivy was taken aback. She had mentioned it casually last time, and he remembered?

Ethan had already opened the system panel and began listing weapon names. Sitting beside him, Ivy listened to his calming voice, feeling a bit mesmerized...

It seemed like she had discovered many things she hadn’t noticed before. She pinched the back of her hand gently; the pain brought her back to reality. It wasn’t the time for daydreaming.

"Let’s just go with the air gun for now. We can test its power, and we can save the points and exchange them when needed."

Ivy made her decision quickly. Although Ethan had mentioned several weapons that intrigued her, having points in hand meant she could exchange for them later, so there was no rush.

Mainly, she was thinking about the mutated plants. What if what they had encountered so far was just the beginning?

This speculation was grounded in fact; some adversaries had been lying low, clearly having some tricks up their sleeves.

"Alright then, all weapons are unlocked now. Just let me know if you want something."

After saying that, Ethan stored the glass jar in the system space. The next moment, the sound of coins dropping echoed, indicating, "Account credited with three hundred fifty-seven thousand points."

"Host, wow! That’s amazing! The main system praised me!"

The Noisy Ghost once again chimed in, and Ethan was speechless. He immediately exchanged for two air guns.

Gone were the days when defeating a zombie only netted you one point; the rush of newfound wealth was genuinely uplifting…

"Here, let’s see how well it works tomorrow."

Ethan handed one of the air guns to Ivy. He had checked the weapon demonstration in the system, but only now, holding it in his hand, did it feel real.

Ivy shifted the sleek air gun in her hand, admiring its futuristic design. The overall silver finish was accented with glowing blue details. Even if it wasn’t used as a weapon, it looked like a piece of art.

It was a standard handgun size, lightweight, not cumbersome or straining on the wrist—truly impressive.

The aesthetics made Ivy smile. "Why wait until tomorrow? Let’s give it a whirl now!"

In the next moment, Ivy and Ethan found themselves back in the space, and the Noisy Ghost cheered before scampering off to play with the Mirror of Mystery.

"Come lend me a hand."

Ivy naturally directed Ethan, and together they moved two large empty barrels that had previously contained gasoline. After positioning them, she walked about thirty feet away, raised the air gun, aimed at the barrels, and pulled the trigger. Almost silently, as she got closer to the barrels, the sound of slicing air became more pronounced.

With a loud "bang," a ten-inch-wide hole appeared right in the center of the barrel, completely penetrating it.

"The power is incredible!" Ivy exclaimed, playing with the air gun in delight.

Ethan also took a shot at the second empty barrel, standing a few feet further back than Ivy. His shot created a hole as well, but it was slightly smaller, around eight inches in diameter.

The two exchanged glances, both surprised. Ethan was aware that the system's weapon information didn’t specify this detail.

They repeated the tests several times, discovering that the closer they were to the shooting target, the greater the damage; conversely, the further away they were, the less damage was inflicted.

The limit was about a quarter of a mile. Without a scope, Ethan couldn’t make out small targets clearly, but Ivy, with her enhanced senses, could barely see enough to hit a target, leaving a small hole similar to that made by a sniper rifle.

"This is amazing! The damage remains strong even from such a distance. The most important part is that the weapon is compact and, with a scope attached, it can be used effectively!"

Ethan nodded and exchanged for two scopes. The scopes were also beautifully designed, entirely silver with fine glitter, and only the markings were in black. Adjusting the magnification was simple; just turn the dial to the desired setting.

Attaching the scope to the air gun was easy and could be adjusted with one hand.

"This gun is incredible; it can fire continuously without needing to load bullets, and it won’t jam or explode. Most importantly, it’s silent—unbelievable!"

The more Ivy used it, the happier she became. She felt that technology and hard work were a better match than abilities.

Seeing her so joyful, Ethan couldn’t help but laugh. He secured the gun and tucked it into his waistband.

"Let’s go; it’s time to head out."

Ivy copied him, tucking the gun in place. She had to admit, it did look pretty cool.

After all the commotion, dawn was breaking. The two finished breakfast and began discussing their next steps.

They gathered the core team and Alex for a meeting. They had put in tremendous effort this time, so Ivy decided to charge half price for everyone to receive the ability enhancement serum, but first, they needed to fill the big pit and bring back the researchers.

"What ideas does everyone have for this pit?" Ivy opened the floor, resting her chin on her hand as she looked at everyone.

"Can’t we transport the stones from the back mountain to fill it?"

"I think we should leave the back mountain alone; let’s just dig up a barren mountain."

"Are we moving a mountain here? Isn’t that a bit over the top?"

Everyone began discussing in turns when suddenly, Ethan posed a crucial question, "Has anyone thought about where all the dirt from such a big pit went?"

Ivy’s heart raced at his words. Right, where did the original soil go? She quickly instructed all the ability users to search outside, sending all but a few to stay behind for protection. If they found anything, they were to signal.

They formed groups of three, each carrying a signal flare, and set off. Thankfully, there were plenty of vehicles in the fortress, and they split into different directions, with a rule that everyone must return to the base by sunset.

Ivy teamed up with Tracy and Chris, while Ethan led Mike and his teammates. The vice-captain took two others, and two followed Sarah. Alex took Robin and an assistant, forming ten small teams that quickly drove away from the fortress.
