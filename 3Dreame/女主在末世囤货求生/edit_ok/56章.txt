**Chapter 1: The Unspoken Tension**

Uncle Tom let out a heavy sigh as he stood before the storage cabinets, his frustration evident. Ivy Bennett, unable to resist her curiosity, strolled over with a bright smile and asked, “Uncle Tom, what's wrong? Why the long face?”

“Ivy, thank goodness you’re here! I’m so worried,” Uncle Tom lamented, gesturing to the cabinets. “Look at all these projects we’ve been working hard on. It’s such a shame—without power, once we leave this controlled environment, the cultures in these petri dishes will die off. And all those precious formulations? They can’t be stored without proper conditions. The emergency power supply is running low too; see the red light? All our previous research may go to waste.”

“Don’t be upset, Uncle. We’re still here, the data’s still here, and we can always start over,” Ivy reassured him. A few students nearby echoed her sentiments, encouraging Uncle Tom to gather whatever materials he needed to take with him.

Once the area cleared and she was sure no one was around, Ivy quickly raised her hand, utilizing her spatial abilities to discreetly store the connected cabinets. This way, she could preserve the reagents perfectly and later surprise Uncle Tom with them. She wandered around, collecting some office supplies and computers that looked relatively new—no files were left behind, and no one was around to notice her actions.

Not lingering too long, she returned to where the others were. Mike and the team had divided the supplies among themselves, items they had brought along just in case.

Ivy decided to act as if she had also given away her share, not wanting to draw attention. After grabbing a quick bite, fatigue washed over her. The girls teamed up to find a quiet room to rest, while the boys stayed outside, taking turns to keep watch.

At that moment, Mike struck up a conversation with Ethan. They were both on the same mission, having fought against unforeseen dangers together for a while now. Despite not starting off on the best of terms, they had developed a camaraderie, sharing stories and bonding over their experiences.

Ivy found herself brooding over her desire to toss a certain troublesome woman down the elevator shaft or into a pack of zombies, fantasizing about various ways to deal with her. Yet, she couldn't shake off the feeling that Ethan, that intriguing man, had been watching her closely for the past few hours.

Fearing exposure, Ivy resolved to tread carefully, longing for the dawn to come when they could part ways and return to their own lives. If he wanted to protect his precious acquaintance, so be it; the world wasn’t that big, and there would always be another opportunity.

She consoled herself with the age-old adage that revenge is best served cold, hugging herself in a moment of self-pity, and ultimately blaming Ethan for the predicament she found herself in.

The night passed quietly, without any surprises. Although the researchers were unaccustomed to physical hardship, most were young and resilient. Uncle Tom and Auntie, though older, had recovered enough to be on their feet again.

The only one who had fainted, Jack, woke up after several bottles of glucose had been administered. The first thing he did upon waking was to seek out his “guardian angel.” Uncle Tom chuckled, “Jack is finally back on his feet! Young people bounce back fast!”

Ivy, however, was taken aback by the puppy-dog look in Jack’s eyes. Why was he grinning like an idiot?

Was this guy really a PhD? It didn’t seem possible!

Jack paid no mind to what others thought of him; to him, it felt as if he had come close to death and had witnessed a divine being descending from the heavens to save him. In his mind, it would be rude not to express his gratitude.

If he knew what others thought of his feelings, they would undoubtedly say, “No need for that!”

Ivy remained relatively calm, but Alex was not as composed. He didn’t care whom Jack liked, but he definitely found it annoying how talkative he was. Every time he asked Ivy a question, he wouldn’t wait for her response before providing his own answer.

“Ivy, do you like roses?” he asked, not waiting for her reply.

“I love roses too, especially red ones! They’re the most passionate, lively, and beautiful!” he proclaimed, gazing at her with stars in his eyes, seeking her agreement.

This kind of behavior made Alex want to pull his hair out. He hadn’t needed to deal with this kind of nonsense since elementary school!

Ivy was at her wit's end. “Someone, please help me!”

Mike noticed that his little lady was struggling under the relentless attention from the overly enthusiastic boy, and he couldn’t help but chuckle. When he first became Ivy's bodyguard, she had just turned eighteen and was still very innocent. Now, she was at an age where discussions of relationships were becoming relevant.

It felt like watching his daughter grow up while knowing a pig was coming to the trough.

He took a closer look at the recovering Jack, who wasn’t bad-looking at all. He was the kind of pretty boy often discussed online, the type that could easily be described as a “little puppy.” Despite being so young, he was already a PhD, which spoke to his high intelligence. Pairing him with Ivy was a stretch, but not entirely unreasonable.

Having evaluated the situation, Mike decided not to intervene with Jack’s persistent attention and chatter. Even if Ivy looked a bit exasperated, he believed she should enjoy the feeling of being pursued; it would add completeness to her life. This was how he justified his lack of action, embracing the role of a protective father figure as he navigated his thoughts.

As dawn broke, everyone prepared to move out. They learned they could only access the laboratory through the elevator, so they decided to retrace their steps.

Meanwhile, the three women and two men still in the elevator shaft had huddled together all night, too afraid to move.

On the way back, Mike stated that they would not be concerned about the survivors; their primary focus was to retreat quickly. Ethan shared the same sentiment, arranging for his team to transport the packed research materials.

Once everyone had exited the laboratory, Ivy seized the opportunity to sneak back inside unnoticed, determined to salvage the valuable equipment she had spotted earlier.

She stored all the irreplaceable materials and computers in her spatial pocket, collecting them as she went. When she finally left, she cleverly shut the outer door of the laboratory behind her. Once the emergency power ran out, no one would be able to open it again, ensuring that her actions remained undiscovered.

There was no specific reason for her to do this other than the fact that she found the equipment impressive and deemed it a non-renewable resource. Ivy would never admit that her space was too vast and empty, and leaving it unused felt wasteful.

In the eyes of the others, she had only lagged behind a bit, rejoining the group without drawing any suspicion.

At that moment, all of Ethan’s attention was focused on how to escape the elevator shaft. The elevator door on Basement One was completely blocked by a car, making it impossible to enter or exit.

The front half of the car was wedged into the elevator, leaving barely eight inches of space. Zombies couldn’t get in, but they couldn’t get out either.

Thus, they devised a new plan to exit via the elevator on the first floor, still uncertain about the number of zombies lurking outside. Teamwork would be essential.

When the group saw Ethan and the others return, the three women and two men in the elevator shaft were overcome with emotion, tears welling in their eyes as they apologized profusely.

Uncle Tom and the others were well aware that Ethan had sacrificed two rescue team members for these individuals, and they gave them the cold shoulder, ignoring their pleas.

Ivy was indifferent; as long as they didn’t get in her way or follow her, she didn’t care if they lived or died. However, her desire to take out that troublesome woman was impossible to hide.

Noticing Ethan’s gaze fixated on her once more, Ivy cursed internally at that intriguing man. Couldn’t he just focus on that woman for a while?

Was it against the rules for him to look at her? If he was so capable, he should be protecting her at all times. Otherwise, humph!

Knowing that glaring at the troublesome woman wouldn’t solve anything, Ivy began discussing the plan for leaving with Mike. With Ethan no longer watching her, it confirmed her suspicion—they were definitely involved with each other!
