**Chapter: Strategic Plans and Unwavering Bonds**

Ivy Collins finally felt a sense of relief. Her earlier approach had been misguided; the Mindful Observation technique was a gentler way to harness her powers. If she kept unleashing her abilities at such a rapid pace, she'd have to pause mid-battle and joke, “Hold up, folks, my powers need a breather!” That would be downright ludicrous.

Channeling her mental strength directly proved far more effective; the ice spikes she released varied greatly in hardness. Meanwhile, those training nearby stared in disbelief, wondering what on earth was happening.

As others began to sense changes within themselves, they noticed Ivy and Ethan Carter's actions. Inspired, they instinctively tried to unleash their own powers. Even before reaching the assembly area, the training ground was awash with vibrant colors.

Ivy and Ethan sat cross-legged, watching in silence as those who had awakened their abilities tried to use them.

When the assembly time arrived, Mr. Smith finally descended the stairs, and it was clear his health was declining. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Taylor supported him as they approached the group. Mr. Smith offered a brief greeting, and then Mr. Johnson took over the speaking.

Ivy stood before the members of the Collins and Hayes families, flanked by Ethan and his team. Mr. Johnson’s speech was concise; he explained why everyone had fainted and the purpose of their gathering. Then he called Ivy and Ethan to demonstrate their abilities.

With calm expressions, the two displayed their powers, leaving first-time witnesses astounded. Following that, those who felt they had awakened abilities stepped forward to showcase their talents.

Ivy and Ethan had a rough idea of the situation from earlier, but they were surprised to see several members of the Smith family had also awakened powers.

Though Ivy maintained a calm facade, her mind was racing with thoughts. Some issues would need to be confronted eventually. She glanced toward Mr. Smith and then shifted her gaze away after a moment.

Among the elders of the Collins family, the old butler and Aunt Mary had not awakened any powers. Jack, who hadn’t lived to see the changes in his previous life, had awakened a powerful metal-based ability, which pleased Ivy immensely.

Ethan’s small squad, perhaps due to their special forces background, all awakened abilities. Besides Ethan, who had a unique lightning ability, the others had standard powers: two earth-based, one water-based, one fire-based, and one wood-based, making them a formidable team.

Zachary Hayes had awakened a wind-based ability, while his father had an earth-based ability and his aunt had a wood-based ability. Jack's girlfriend, Lily, remained an ordinary person.

There were also a couple of younger children who awakened abilities but couldn’t sense or use them yet; all were under fifteen years old.

Mr. Johnson, the last to demonstrate, surprisingly revealed a fire-based ability. About a third of the fortress’s residents had awakened abilities, and the younger Smith generation had significant representation with many standard powers.

Among the unique ability users, only Tim Smith had a healing ability, quite rare in the apocalypse. Coupled with his biomedical science background, it was a fitting match.

Emma, a close friend of Ivy, had also awakened a fire-based ability. She excitedly waved her hand to create a small flame, raising an eyebrow at Ivy.

At the research institute, another ability user emerged: a bespectacled researcher named Henry, a student of Mr. Johnson. He was usually very low-key and not well-acquainted with Ivy, but he had awakened a water-based ability. When he first released it, the water flow was surprisingly strong. It made Ivy wonder if those with strong mental powers also had enhanced abilities.

However, the research institute's personnel were not included in the position adjustments, as their main task was studying zombies.

Ivy noticed that no one with spatial abilities had emerged, which was understandable. In her previous life, only two out of hundreds of ability users at the base had spatial powers, making them scarce.

After Mr. Johnson registered the status of all ability users, he instructed everyone to carry out their respective duties until position assignments were released. He also specified that, aside from normal sparring, using abilities to fight within the fortress or against ordinary people was strictly forbidden.

Ivy called Ethan, Jack, and members of the Hayes family to her room for a meeting. She expressed her concerns directly.

“There are more ability users from the Smith family branches than from the main family. I think this is a bad situation.”

Ethan felt the same, especially seeing the fervor mixed with a strange light in the eyes of the branch family when they unleashed their powers. He spoke in a low voice, “The main Smith family’s strength is indeed being overshadowed. This will undoubtedly lead to disputes over control of the fortress in the future.”

Ivy nodded in agreement. “We need to ensure we hold part of the power ourselves. In terms of ability strength, we’re not lacking, and we have a significant number of ability users, especially since we also have unique offensive powers.”

Everyone knew the branch family’s previous actions. Though they maintained a mutual aversion, they hadn’t interfered with each other when all were ordinary people. Now, with the awakening of powers, things had become more complicated.

“Mr. Smith didn’t look well today,” Zachary’s grandfather sighed. “Mr. Smith is older than me by several years. This winter has been long, and the old man’s health isn’t great. It’s hard for him.”

Zachary’s grandfather patted his leg and lamented. “As long as Mr. Smith is around, he’ll still hold sway over the Smith family. Moreover, Mr. Johnson and several direct descendants have awakened powers, so there shouldn’t be any major issues in the short term.”

Everyone could hear the underlying meaning in Ivy’s words, and their expressions turned serious as they exchanged glances.

Ivy habitually tapped her fingers on the sofa armrest, murmuring “George Carlin” a few times, which distracted Ethan from his thoughts. Then, she snapped her fingers.

“Rather than sitting back and waiting for something to happen, we should take the initiative. Let’s do as I suggest. To prevent the branch family from causing trouble, we need to secure some key positions and prepare a backup plan early.”

Ethan and Jack exchanged glances, and Jack cleared his throat. “Ivy, we’ve actually prepared a little something already.”

Ivy looked at Jack in surprise. “What is it?”

Jack glanced at Ethan, who showed no intention of speaking up, so he braced himself to continue. “Remember when you were bullied by the Smith branch family? Mr. Smith just brushed it off. Both Ethan and I were furious, so we thought about what we would do if we had to part ways with the Smith family, and then...”

As Jack spoke, he paused, and Ivy didn’t rush him. The others, however, grew impatient and urged, “What happened next? Don’t keep us in suspense!”

Seeing Jack’s slow pace, Ethan couldn’t take it anymore and took over the conversation. “We went out to scout for a potential base to develop. It’s not within the capital city but somewhere in the Midwest, and we’ve also collected and transferred some supplies there.”

Ivy felt a mix of emotions—gratitude, sadness, and joy—swelling in her heart. Those who had always protected her, treating her like family and fighting for her, were still thinking of her in this life.

She smiled, nodding her head, then shook it. “It’s not time for that yet. Besides, I’ve invested so much in this fortress; I shouldn’t be the one to leave.”

Many times, she had thought that her ability to avoid becoming a cold-blooded killer stemmed from knowing that there were still people who loved, cherished, and cared for her. With them around, she could maintain that thread of warmth and her true self, not allowing the hatred from her past life to twist her into something cruel.

In their eyes, she would always be the little princess in need of protection, and she felt that sentiment deeply.

But in this life, she wouldn’t be weak and helpless, lacking any ability to resist. Instead, she would protect those who loved her and those she loved, growing stronger in the process.
