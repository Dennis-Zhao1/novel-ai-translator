Ethan Clark headed to the girls' dormitory as the sky began to darken. Emma Thomas was quietly painting in the backyard. As Ethan walked into the living room, he asked Grace Gonzalez, "Hey Grace, where's Emma?"

"She's in the backyard," Grace replied, setting the dishes on the dining table.

Through the glass doors, Ethan could vaguely see Emma on the swing, absorbed in her book. He made his way to the backyard, curious about what she was reading. "What are you reading?" he asked, strolling over the stone path to join her by the swing.

Emma, slightly startled by his voice, closed her book and replied, "Just brushing up on some finance basics. I start at your company on Monday."

Ethan grinned and gently ruffled her hair. "No worries, you'll start from the ground up, so don't stress."

Emma shifted away, not wanting him to touch her, and added, "Please, don't do that. I don't like it."

Ethan nodded, taking her words seriously, and agreed, "Okay, I respect that."

"Dinner's ready," he announced, taking her book and motioning for her to get up. Remembering his promise not to touch her, he pulled back his hand and walked towards the dining room. "Come on, let's eat."

Emma followed him, puzzled by the array of dishes on the table. "Grace, what's the occasion for all these dishes?" she asked.

"Mr. Clark requested them," Grace replied, placing the last dish on the table.

Ethan, with a warm smile, gestured for Emma to sit down as Grace brought out the drinks. Emma looked at Ethan, curious about the feast. "Is today special or something?" she wondered aloud.

Ethan handed her a glass of cranberry juice and said, "We're celebrating you agreeing to join my company."

Emma rolled her eyes playfully. "That's it?" she asked, taking a sip of the juice.

"Yep," Ethan confirmed with a nod.

Emma then mentioned, "Oh, by the way, I need to go out tomorrow."

Ethan, while serving her some fish, asked, "What's up?"

"Sophia Wright is moving, and I'm helping her out," Emma explained.

"When are you heading out?" Ethan inquired.

"I plan to leave around 8 AM," Emma replied, worried about having enough time to finish.

"I'll come with you," Ethan declared, adding more food to her plate.

Emma was a bit annoyed. "Do you not trust me or something? It's just a move," she said.

Ethan chuckled. "It's not that. It's just you two girls could use some help with the heavy stuff. I'll bring John along."

"Fine, suit yourself," Emma conceded.

After dinner, Emma went to the gym for a run, while Ethan retreated to his study to handle some work.

The next morning, Ethan and Emma drove to the dorm. As Emma entered, she called out, "Sophia!"

Sophia Wright, busy packing, looked up in surprise. "Emma! You're early!"

"I wanted to make sure we get everything done today," Emma said, setting down the large box she was carrying.

Sophia grabbed her phone. "I'll call a moving truck."

Emma stopped her. "No need. Ethan's here with a driver to help."

Sophia was taken aback. "Your husband came too?"

Emma shrugged. "He insisted."

"Well, in that case, dinner's on me tonight," Sophia offered graciously.

As they packed up the last of Sophia's things, Ethan and John arrived to help carry the boxes to the car. "Thanks for coming," Sophia said with a smile.

"Emma's friends are my friends," Ethan replied, loading the car.

With everything packed, they drove to Sophia's new place. Seeing the old building, Emma was concerned. "Sophia, is this place safe?"

"It's affordable," Sophia reassured, pointing to the nearby police station and the uniforms hanging on the balconies. "I think we're good."

Ethan, observing the surroundings, nodded in agreement. "Seems safe enough," he concluded.
