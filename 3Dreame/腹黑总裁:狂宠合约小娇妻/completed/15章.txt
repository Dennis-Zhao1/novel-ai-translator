Chapter One: The Deal

"Ma'am," came the voice of Grace Gonzalez from the doorway, pulling Emma Thomas out of her thoughts. She turned around, trying to focus.

"What's up?" she asked.

"Breakfast is ready, and Mr. Clark called to say not to wait for him to eat," Grace said while tidying the room.

"Grace, do you know where Ethan went?" Emma asked softly, moving closer to her.

"Ma'am, I really don't know where he went. Why don't you go have breakfast first? He'll be back once he's done with his business," Grace suggested as she grabbed Ethan's suit jacket from the night before.

"Hold on," Emma stopped her, noticing something odd about the jacket. She took it from Grace and smelled a mature, alluring perfume on it. "You might want to just throw this away. That scent is not coming out," she said, handing it back to Grace. Emma headed back to the window to continue her painting.

"Go ahead, I'm not hungry right now," she added, picking up her paintbrush and getting lost in her art again. But soon enough, her stomach growled loudly, betraying her. Sighing, she put down the brush and headed downstairs.

"Grace, is there any food left?" Emma called from the staircase, spotting Grace tidying up the living room.

"Yes, ma'am, I'll get it for you," Grace replied, hurrying off to the kitchen. Emma slowly descended the stairs and settled at the dining table, where Grace soon laid out the breakfast spread.

Emma's eyes widened with joy seeing her favorite corn cakes among the dishes. "Ma'am, Mr. Clark asked me to prepare these. I hope it's to your liking," Grace said as she placed the last plate.

"I love it," Emma replied, grabbing a corn cake and taking a big bite. Just then, the doorbell rang.

"I'll get it," Grace offered, heading to the door.

"Is Ethan home?" a familiar male voice called out from the entrance.

Emma knew that voice. "Why is he here?" she muttered to herself as the man followed Grace into the dining room.

"Emma, where's Ethan?" It was her father, Oliver Thomas.

"Dad, what brings you here? Ethan left early this morning and hasn't returned yet," Emma replied calmly, taking a sip of her milk.

Seeing her alone, Oliver didn't press further about Ethan. "Last night, Ethan and I met with Michael Young to discuss an investment plan. This morning, I received Michael's acquisition proposal. Do you think Ethan is involved in this?"

Emma's heart raced at her father's words. "Is he making a move already? Does that mean the acquisition will be completed soon?" she thought, trying to maintain her composure.

"Dad, he's never involved me in his work," Emma said innocently.

"Emma, the company is a legacy from your mother and me. Half of it is your mother's hard work. You don't want it to fall into someone else's hands, do you?" Oliver said, his eyes searching hers.

Emma gave a small smile, trying to reassure him. "Don't worry, Dad, I'll ask him when he gets back."

"Our family can't afford to mess around, Emma. Your uncle's medical bills are a hefty load," Oliver added, his tone more serious.

Emma felt a pang of frustration. Her uncle's medical expenses had been a constant worry. "Dad, you promised to take care of the bills before I got married," she said, a hint of anger in her voice.

Oliver's gaze hardened slightly. "The house your mother left you is joint property. I won't agree to sell it, so you can't liquidate it."

"Father, how could you..." Emma's anger flared, but Oliver cut her off. "Think it over. Your uncle's medical bills are non-negotiable."

Emma stood her ground. "I'll talk to Ethan about the acquisition," she said firmly before heading back upstairs.

Grace came over with a cup of tea for Oliver. "Thank you," he said, taking a sip before leaving.

Alone in the study, Emma sat with her head in her hands, deep in thought. "I need to find a way to transfer my uncle to a better hospital," she mused. "But how can I afford it?"

Ethan entered quietly, noticing her deep in thought. "What are you thinking about?" he asked softly, startling her.

"You scared me!" Emma exclaimed, pushing him away.

"I've been here for a while. What has you so lost in thought?" Ethan asked, trying to gauge her mood.

"Nothing," she replied evasively.

Sensing something was off, Ethan pressed on. "Did your dad say something to upset you?"

Emma hesitated, then finally asked, "Did you start the acquisition?"

Ethan's lips curled into a slight smile. "Isn't that what you wanted?"

It was true; Emma had hoped for this outcome. But now, with her father going back on his word and using her uncle to pressure her, she felt trapped.

"Do you have any contacts in the healthcare industry?" Emma asked, her big eyes pleading.

Ethan was puzzled. "Why do you need that? Are you unwell?" he asked, concerned.

Emma felt she had no choice but to confide in him. "My uncle is in the hospital. I want to transfer him to a better facility, but I don't have the resources."

"Leave it to me," Ethan offered.

"But the cost..." Emma faltered, unable to voice her concerns.

Ethan met her gaze. "I've got it covered."

"I'll pay you back," Emma said urgently, standing to leave.

"Pay me back now," Ethan teased, grabbing her wrist gently, his eyes warm.

"Let go," she said, trying to pull away but finding her strength lacking.

Ethan leaned in closer, his voice soft. "Let's get our marriage license first. Then I'll handle the hospital and the contract issues."

Emma looked at him, surprised. "A marriage license? That means we'd actually be married."

"No way," she replied firmly.

"In that case, I'm afraid I can't help," Ethan said, releasing her wrist and turning to leave.

"Wait, it's not impossible," Emma said, stopping him.

A smile played on Ethan's lips as he turned back. "Let's get our marriage license then."

"Let's redo the contract first," Emma insisted, sitting down to draft a new agreement on her laptop.

"Here it is," she said, handing the printed document to Ethan.

He read it over carefully.

Marriage Agreement

Clause 1: From the month of obtaining the marriage license, Party B shall cover the full medical expenses of Party A's uncle.

Clause 2: From the month of obtaining the marriage license, Party B shall assist Party A in obtaining 30% of Group Thomas's shares.

Clause 3: Both parties may terminate the agreement upon completion of the first two clauses.

"The last clause needs revision," Ethan said, sitting down to edit the document.

He handed the revised version back to Emma.

Clause 3: Termination rights are exclusively held by Party A; unilateral termination by Party B is invalid.

"Ethan, that's too controlling," Emma protested.

Ethan chuckled. "I didn't get any benefits from the first two clauses."

Emma sighed, accepting his terms. They both signed and sealed the agreement.

"Let's go get the license," Ethan said, heading for the door.
