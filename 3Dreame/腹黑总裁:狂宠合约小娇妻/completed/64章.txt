**Keeping Us Under Wraps**

"Time to get up."

"Hmm? I'm awake."

The first rays of sunlight crept into the bedroom, and Ethan Clark was already up, sitting by the bed, gently coaxing Emma Thomas to start her day. He watched her face tenderly, reluctant to break the peaceful moment.

Ethan leaned in closer, staring deeply into her eyes, momentarily lost in her presence. Just then, Emma sensed his breath nearby and slowly woke up.

Why do I hear breathing? Is he right next to me?

Emma opened her eyes, and their gazes met. Feeling a bit bashful under his gaze, she gently pushed him away and pulled the blanket over her head.

"You... go wash up," Emma murmured from under the covers, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment.

Ethan chuckled softly, pulling the blanket down. "I'm ready. Do you want to get up and head to work together?"

Already ready? But I haven’t even gotten up yet!

Emma shot him a surprised look, and just as she was about to speak, Ethan whipped the blanket off and scooped her up. "No sleeping in today."

Emma nestled against his chest, shyly resting her head on his shoulder.

"I'll wait for you downstairs," Ethan said, gently placing her in the bathroom before closing the door.

Emma stood there, watching him leave, feeling surprisingly happy. After getting ready, she slipped into a sharp business outfit, paired with modest heels, and made her way downstairs.

When Emma reached the dining table, Ethan was already there, having breakfast. "Come on, eat up," he said, looking up at her in amazement.

She wore a sleek business suit, with her hair pulled back into a high ponytail, showcasing her refined features.

"What?" Emma asked cautiously, noticing his astonished expression.

Is it that I don’t look good, or does this outfit not suit me?

"Not good? I can go change," she offered, seeing his prolonged silence.

"No, no, I'm just stunned. You look fantastic," Ethan finally said, coming to his senses.

"I thought it might not be suitable," Emma replied, pulling out a chair and sitting down.

Ethan noticed she had applied a touch of makeup, enhancing her charm. He peeled a boiled egg and placed it on her plate, his gaze soft. "Here, have an egg."

"Thanks." Emma took a bite, only to find Ethan still watching her.

"Why are you staring at me? Is there something on my face?" she asked curiously.

Why is he staring? Is he thinking about something?

"Nothing, it's just that you look so stunning today with that light makeup. You're more exquisite than usual," Ethan remarked, taking a sip of his orange juice.

Emma lowered her head shyly and whispered, "Well, I should look presentable for work."

She turned and smiled at Ethan, who was clearly pleased to see her so happy.

"Eat up," he encouraged, sharing in her joy.

Emma glanced at her watch and suddenly realized she was running late. "Oh no, I'm going to be late!" She jumped up, ready to dash out, but remembered she needed to catch a ride with Ethan. She quickly ran over to him.

"Are you finished? I'm running late," she urged.

Ethan chuckled, "In such a hurry?"

"Of course! It's my first day on the job; I can't be late," Emma insisted, her eyes full of urgency.

"And we can't let anyone at work know about us."

"Drop me at the subway station, and I'll walk the rest of the way."

Even in her rush, Emma was mindful of their secret. She didn't want office gossip to interfere with her career.

"Hiding our relationship, huh?" Ethan set down his fork and looked at her.

Why does she want to keep it a secret? Wouldn't it be better for her if people knew?

"Please, can you promise me?" Emma asked, her eyes full of hopeful anticipation.

Ethan softened at her earnest gaze and quickly agreed. "Alright, I can't say no to you."

Emma smiled warmly. "Thank you."

They locked eyes for a moment before Emma remembered the time crunch. "Are you done? We should get going."

Ethan laughed, setting his utensils aside and wiping his mouth. He quickly stood, grabbed his briefcase, and wrapped an arm around Emma as they headed to the door.

"What should I be aware of on my first day?" Emma peppered Ethan with questions as they drove.

"Just don't stand out too much," Ethan advised patiently.

"Can I just keep quiet all day?" Emma continued, curious.

"In your role, it's important to get along with your supervisor," Ethan explained.

"My supervisor? Aren't I your assistant? So, you're my boss?" Emma wondered aloud.

"You're my assistant, but you'll report to my chief assistant. She'll guide you and assign tasks," Ethan explained with a smile.

"Oh, what's she like?" Emma asked, intrigued by the mention of her new boss.

"She's patient with newcomers but quite strict. Be prepared," Ethan warned, glancing at Emma.

"I'll be ready," Emma nodded confidently.

As they chatted, Emma noticed the subway sign outside the window and called for Ethan to stop. "Here, stop here."

"This is still a bit of a walk to the office," Ethan pointed out, surveying the area.

"No, this is perfect. If anyone asks, I can say I took the subway," Emma insisted, her eyes firm on Ethan.

"Alright, just be careful," Ethan said, pulling over by the subway entrance and reminding Emma to watch for traffic.

Emma nodded, quickly exiting the car. "You go on ahead. I'll see you soon."

"I'll be at the office. See you later," Ethan whispered as she closed the door.

Emma straightened her outfit, slung her bag over her shoulder, and confidently made her way to the office, ready to tackle her first day.
