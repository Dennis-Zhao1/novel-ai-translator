Dinner Table Showdown

"Hey, youâ€”"

"Enough," Grandma cut off Uncle just as he was about to speak, her gaze shifting to Emma Thomas and Ethan Clark, clearly siding with them. "Ethan, I want you to get to the bottom of this," Grandma instructed as she rose from her seat, heading towards the door. "Guests will be arriving soon, everyone should head back and prepare," she added before leaving.

Everyone stood up to leave as Ethan Clark wrapped an arm around Emma Thomas. Uncle called after him, "Ethan, if you can't be fair, I won't let you off the hook."

"Uncle, Charlotte, don't worry," Ethan reassured them with a nod, noticing the sadness in their eyes.

"Take care of yourself," Uncle said, adjusting Charlotte's blanket as he consoled her.

"Go on," Charlotte replied weakly.

"I'll be leaving too," Aunt said, glancing at Charlotte with a slight smile tugging at her lips.

Everyone departed from the room, leaving Charlotte alone in tears.

"It'll be okay, don't worry," Ethan Clark soothed Emma Thomas as their car pulled up to the Clark estate. Emma's face was still tense with worry.

As they stepped out of the car, they saw a familiar vehicle approaching. It stopped, and out stepped Ethan's parents and a stunning young woman.

"Mom, Dad, you're here," Ethan greeted, pulling Emma closer as they approached the car.

"Shishi, you're here too," Ethan smiled warmly, greeting the young woman.

"I was at Samuel's discussing a project yesterday, and your mom invited me over," Shishi explained, her gaze lingering on Emma.

"This must be your wife, hi, I'm Shishi," she said, extending her hand. Emma, caught a bit off guard, shook it, "Hi, I'm Emma."

"Why are you both outside? Are you heading out?" Ethan's dad asked, curiosity evident in his voice.

Ethan hesitated, knowing fewer people aware of the situation was better, so he fibbed, "No, we're just here to greet guests."

"Come on, let's head in. Everyone's almost here," Ethan tried to shift the topic, eager to get inside.

"Emma, how have you been settling in here?" Ethan's mom asked, holding Emma's hand with genuine concern.

Emma, still preoccupied with finding who framed her, was distracted and anxious.

Shishi and Ethan walked behind them, deep in conversation. Emma noticed, but Ethan's mom pulled her along too quickly for her to eavesdrop.

They reached the front room where guests were entertained. Ethan's mom released Emma's hand and approached Grandma. "Mom, we're here," she announced.

Emma turned her head slightly, watching Ethan and Shishi with a sidelong glance. Something about their interaction seemed too familiar, and Emma couldn't shake the feeling of being an outsider.

As everyone settled at the table, Grandma called out, "Come, everyone, take your seats. It's almost time to eat."

Emma sat at Ethan's right, with Shishi on his left, at Grandma's insistence. Emma wondered why Shishi, unlike other guests, was seated with the family. What was her story?

The meal began, and Aunt took the opportunity to stir the pot. "Shishi, eat up. It's been ages since you and Ethan were together."

Most people overlooked the comment, but Emma caught it. Was Shishi his ex-girlfriend? It seemed likely. Why else would Aunt say that?

Emma quietly ate while Ethan, noticing her lack of appetite, ladled some soup for her. "Have some soup," he offered gently.

Emma met his gaze with a questioning look, whispering a small "Thank you."

Ethan was taken aback by her formality. "No need to be so polite with me," he replied softly.

Emma gave him a small smile and sipped her soup.

Aunt couldn't resist another jab. "I thought you and Ethan would end up together, Shishi. But I guess this is fine too. Staying friends lasts longer."

Shishi glanced at Emma, embarrassed, and said, "Ethan and I have always been just friends."

Emma, head down, wondered why Aunt had been so antagonistic. Could she be the one who framed her? Was it about the inheritance split, where Aunt got more last time?

"Emma, you don't mind, do you?" Shishi asked, noticing Emma's silence.

Emma was lost in thought, focused on finding evidence, and hadn't paid attention to Aunt's comments. "Oh, it's nothing. Everyone has a past. As long as Ethan and I truly love each other now, that's all that matters, right, Aunt?" she replied, testing the waters.

She knew she couldn't back down in this family; she had to stand her ground.

Aunt was taken aback, her eyes narrowing at Emma as if to say, "You cheeky girl."

Ethan watched Emma with a mixture of surprise and admiration. She was unlike most women, never one to be at a disadvantage.

He patted her shoulder gently. "Let's eat."

"Mom, look at her, no respect for her elders! Who taught her to speak like that?" Aunt whined to Grandma.

"Enough, enough, you too," Grandma interjected, silencing Aunt.

"Mom," Aunt protested, sensing Grandma wouldn't support her, and pouted.

"Ethan, your mom was angry at Aunt for her harsh words," she said, defending Emma.

"Let's just eat first. We'll talk later," Grandma commanded, and the room fell silent. Emma kept her head down, swallowing her tears along with her meal.
