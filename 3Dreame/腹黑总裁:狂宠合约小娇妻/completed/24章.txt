Chapter One: Unexpected Encounters

The bell rang loudly, signaling the end of class. Emma Thomas waved goodbye to her friend Sophia Wright and started making her way to the school gate. Just as she was getting into her stride, she heard someone calling her name. Turning around, she saw James Campbell approaching with his usual sunny disposition.

Despite her initial surprise, Emma's eyes darted away awkwardly. "What's up?" she asked coolly.

James, unfazed by her demeanor, explained, "I was just heading to the bookstore near the entrance and happened to see you." 

Emma nodded and continued walking, with James following silently beside her. The air between them was thick with unsaid words.

Trying to break the tension, James asked, "Have you found an internship yet?"

Emma shook her head. "Not yet. What about you?"

"Got an offer from an investment bank," James replied, glancing at her to gauge her reaction.

Emma stopped in her tracks, looking up at him. "I thought you wanted to work at a bank? Why the change?"

James's face fell slightly. "Emma, you know my family situation. Without money, I can't have anything, including you."

Emma's gaze flickered, memories of what Ethan Clark had told her flashing through her mind. She couldn't let James's future be jeopardized because of her.

"James, I've never liked you that way. Plus, I'm married now. Let's not have these conversations anymore." With that, Emma turned and saw Ethan Clark's car parked at the entrance. Her heart skipped a beat. She was pretty sure he had seen everything.

Emma opened the car door and got in, forgetting to fasten her seatbelt in her nervousness. "You're back early," she remarked, trying to sound casual, though she was surprised to see Ethan. 

Ethan gave her a sideways glance. "I told you to cut off contact with him," he said, a hint of jealousy in his voice.

"We just ran into each other by accident..." Emma started to explain, but Ethan interrupted.

"Accidentally? In a school this big?" he pressed.

Before she could respond, Ethan leaned in and kissed her, his grip firm and possessive. Emma tried to pull away but eventually gave up. It was only after he stopped that she managed to fasten her seatbelt.

"Let's go home," Ethan said, his voice softer but still firm. The ride was quiet, with Emma gazing out the window, lost in thought.

Breaking the silence, Ethan spoke again. "Don't meet him again. I'll let it slide this time."

Emma sighed, "We're graduating soon. I won't see him again."

Ethan glanced at Emma, feeling a twinge of guilt for his earlier behavior. "I'm taking you somewhere tomorrow," he announced, trying to change the subject.

"I have plans," Emma replied, eyes still on the passing scenery.

"Class?" 

Emma showed him her phone, displaying a chat about a part-time job. "Work," she said.

Ethan took the phone, dialed the number, and said, "Sorry, Emma can't make it tomorrow." He hung up and looked at her, ignoring her protests.

"What does it matter to you if I work?" Emma fumed.

"You need money?" Ethan asked directly.

"If you come with me tomorrow, I'll give you $5,000," he offered, resuming the drive.

Emma thought it over. It was a lot more than her part-time job would pay. "Where are we going?" she asked tentatively.

"You'll see," Ethan replied cryptically.

Emma mulled it over. More money was always welcome. "What do I have to do?"

"Just be yourself," Ethan said with a smile. 

They pulled up to a high-end boutique. Ethan wanted to buy her some clothes and accessories, but she hesitated. "I'm still a student. I don't need fancy clothes," Emma protested.

Unwilling to argue, Ethan scooped her up and carried her inside. "If you won't walk, I'll carry you," he teased, ignoring her protests.

Inside, a sales associate greeted them warmly. "How can I assist you today?"

Ethan responded, "Could you show my wife some of your latest collections?"

The associate eagerly led Emma to the fitting room. "This dress seems like it was made for you," she commented, drawing the curtain aside.

Emma stepped out, and Ethan was momentarily speechless. She looked stunning in a simple white dress that complemented her perfectly.

Ethan managed to compose himself. "It's a bit short. Let's try something else," he said with a hint of possessiveness.

The associate brought out more dresses, and Ethan waited patiently, his eyes catching a blue purse he liked. 

"This is one of our newest arrivals," the associate mentioned. "It's been quite popular even before it hit the shelves."

"I'll take it," Ethan decided.

After what felt like a marathon of trying on clothes, Emma was worn out. Ethan, however, was unfazed. He scooped her up again, much to her embarrassment. "You'll get used to it," he assured her.

"Package everything she tried on," he instructed as they left the store.

Back in the car, they drove towards the villa, leaving the boutique behind as the sun dipped below the horizon.
