Title: Certified Husband

Emma Thomas handed her phone over to Ethan Clark, her eyes filled with frustration. Ethan took a quick glance at the screen and offered a reassuring smile. "Don't worry, I'll get to the bottom of this."

"I already know who's behind it," Emma fumed.

"Tell me," Ethan urged, a steely determination in his eyes. He couldn't stand the thought of anyone messing with her.

Emma took a deep breath, reclaiming her phone. "No, it's fine. I can handle it."

She changed the subject with a growling stomach. "Let's head home. I'm starving."

Ethan nodded, starting the car for the journey back. Once they arrived, Grace Gonzalez greeted them warmly. "Welcome back, Mr. and Mrs. Clark."

"Dinner is ready as you requested," Grace added, heading off to the kitchen.

Emma made her way to the dining table when Ethan stopped her, gesturing for her to sit beside him. "Sit here."

She hesitated, but Ethan's insistence won over her reluctance. "Alright, alright," she relented, settling in next to him.

Grace soon returned with a dish of grilled salmon, setting it in front of Emma. "Fish?" Emma looked at Ethan in surprise, having never seen fish on their table before.

Ethan served her a piece. "I remembered you liked it."

Emma paused, touched by the gesture. "Thanks," she said, taking a bite and savoring it. "It's delicious."

Ethan watched her enjoy the meal, feeling content. After dinner, Emma went upstairs while Ethan made a quick call from the living room. "Can you check the university forum for any trending topics?"

He pondered for a while, and soon his phone buzzed with an incoming call. "Got it," Ethan replied, having identified the source of the rumors and planning to address it the following day.

Meanwhile, Emma was rummaging through the study, searching for something. "Where could it be?" she muttered to herself.

"Looking for something?" Ethan asked, noticing the disarray.

Caught off guard, Emma froze. "Uh... I was looking for our marriage certificate," she stammered.

"Why do you need that?" Ethan walked over, his gaze inquisitive.

"I want to show everyone we're legally married, not just some fling," Emma explained, frustration in her voice.

"You didn't want the school to know before," Ethan reminded her gently.

"I know, but now I have no choice," she sighed.

Understanding her resolve, Ethan opened a locked drawer, handing her the certificate. Emma snapped a few photos and logged into the school's forum, leaving a comment under the rumor post: "Certified Husband," along with the photos of their marriage certificate.

The comments flooded in, filled with surprise and admiration. Her phone buzzed with a call from Sophia Wright.

"Is it true? You're really married?" Sophia's excited voice rang through, causing Emma to hold the phone away from her ear.

"You're not still considering James Campbell, are you?" Sophia's question was loud enough for Ethan to hear.

"We'll catch up at school," Emma replied, ending the call and glancing at Ethan.

Ethan's expression was slightly sour. "You still keep in touch?"

Emma met his gaze steadily. "No, I don't."

Ethan seemed satisfied with her answer, leaving the study to let her be.

Emma joined him in the bedroom later, noticing Ethan had already gone to shower. Soon enough, his phone buzzed on the nightstand.

Curiosity piqued, Emma noticed the caller ID: "Lisa Song." She hesitated, then took the phone to the bathroom door, knocking softly. "Your phone's been ringing."

Ethan opened the door, hair damp and a towel around his waist. Emma couldn't help but notice his toned physique, cheeks turning pink as she looked away. "Your call," she mumbled.

"Are you blushing?" Ethan teased, taking the phone from her.

Emma stammered, "Just... answer it," and retreated to the bed.

Ethan returned to the bathroom to take the call, his voice a low murmur. Outside, Emma tried to brush away her flustered thoughts. "Get it together," she told herself.

"Lisa Song," she pondered, recalling the name.

Ethan emerged, announcing, "I'm heading to Green City tomorrow."

"Oh," Emma replied, feigning nonchalance.

"You're not curious when I'll be back?" Ethan asked, sitting beside her.

Emma smiled faintly. "You can come back anytime."

Ethan chuckled, leaning closer. "Be good while I'm gone," he whispered, his breath warm on her ear.

Emma shivered, pushing him gently. "Move over."

Ethan grinned, giving her space. "Relax," he said, brushing a kiss on her ear before settling down.

Emma pulled the covers up, heart racing. "Goodnight," Ethan murmured, watching her with affection as she turned away.
