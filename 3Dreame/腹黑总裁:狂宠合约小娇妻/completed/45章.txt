Moving into the Old House

"Seeing you both getting along makes me so happy," Grandma beamed as she ushered everyone to the dining table. "Come on, everyone, take your seats. Dinner's ready."

"Come on, come on, sit down," Aunt Eleanor encouraged everyone to hurry up and start eating.

"Emma, it's been a hectic day, and I wasn't sure what you'd like to eat. Try a bit of everything," Grandma suggested as she gestured towards the dishes. Ethan, sitting beside Emma, picked up some food and placed it on her plate.

"Emma, how are your parents doing?" Aunt Eleanor asked with genuine concern.

"Aunt Eleanor, they're doing well," Emma replied, placing her fork down for a moment.

"I heard your dad is no longer the chairman of Thomas Group?" Aunt Eleanor asked, her curiosity piqued.

Emma felt a bit awkward, unsure of how to respond. Sensing her discomfort, Ethan quickly interjected, "Aunt Eleanor, as the eldest daughter, Emma will eventually take over Thomas Group."

With that, Ethan glanced around the table, encouraging everyone to dig in.

Emma's mind was racing. "To the outside world, I might seem like the daughter grabbing the family fortune, the ungrateful one. But does anyone see it from my perspective?"

"Eat up," Ethan said, placing a piece of rib on her plate and giving her arm a reassuring pat.

Emma turned to look at his face, a mix of gratitude and suspicion. "It seems like he's the only one who treats me well, but what are his true intentions?" she pondered.

"If it's genuine, maybe it's not so bad," she thought as she picked up the rib and started eating.

"How is it?" Ethan leaned in slightly, speaking softly.

"It's nothing," Emma replied, snapping out of her thoughts and nervously returning to her meal.

"Emma, how is it?" Grandma asked, smiling warmly at her.

"This rib is amazing! I've never tasted anything like it," Emma exclaimed, surprised at how delicious it was.

"Our chef used to work at national banquets, so every dish here is unique," Aunt Eleanor said proudly as she picked up more food.

"National banquets?" Emma was astounded. They had hired a chef of such caliber to cook at home. Just how wealthy was this family?

"If you like it, you can have it every day," Ethan whispered, glancing at Emma with a smile.

Emma looked at him curiously, but before she could say anything, he interrupted, "Eat more."

At the table, everyone was discussing family matters. Emma listened, feeling slightly out of place, so she focused on her food.

"Fanfan, how long will you be staying this time?" Aunt Eleanor asked Fanfan with a smile.

"This is Emma's first time away from home, and I worry she might not adjust well, so we're planning to head back at the beginning of next month," Ethan replied casually, glancing at Emma.

Emma was surprised, staring at him with curiosity. "The beginning of next month? That's more than ten days away. What's he playing at? Weren't we just visiting for a few days?"

She nudged Ethan with her foot and whispered, "That long?"

"Stay for now, and there will be more opportunities in the future," Grandma smiled, looking at them fondly.

"Yes, yes, Grandma's 80th birthday is coming up soon. We need everyone's help to prepare," Aunt Eleanor said happily.

"Oh, Grandma, I've already prepared the guest list. Please check if anyone's missing," Aunt Eleanor said, signaling a servant to bring a booklet.

Grandma took the booklet and browsed through it, her brow furrowing. "Why isn't Uncle Lee's family on here?" she asked, placing the booklet on the table.

"Mom, they're going abroad in a few days, so..." Aunt Eleanor said nervously.

"Even if they're going abroad, isn't Sisi at home? She can come. They might not attend, but it's our duty to invite them," Grandma said, taking off her glasses and looking at the food on the table.

"I'll add them right away," Aunt Eleanor replied, flustered.

"Yes, although the marriage didn't work out, the friendship between our families remains. These things should be handled with proper etiquette," Aunt Eleanor added.

"Why discuss this now? Fanfan and Emma are still here," Aunt Eleanor said loudly, ensuring Emma heard.

"Huh?" Emma looked up, puzzled by their conversation. Being new to this family, she was still trying to understand the dynamics.

"It's nothing," Ethan reassured her, placing his hand on her back to encourage her to continue eating.

Emma ate quietly, feeling a bit awkward overhearing their conversation. "Could it be that the Lee family was supposed to marry into Ethan's family? Why else would they mention me being here?"

After dinner, everyone dispersed, and Ethan led Emma to the backyard.

"It's been a while since you came back, young master," Xiaoxue said as she guided them to their quarters.

"Xiaoxue, how are the preparations for Grandma's birthday going?" Ethan asked as they walked.

"Well, young master and mistress, you wouldn't know. The preparations were initially handled by the first lady, but the old lady wasn't satisfied, so she handed it over to the eldest daughter," Xiaoxue explained.

"How are uncle and aunt doing?" Ethan continued.

"Uncle hasn't visited in a long time," Xiaoxue said, stopping to open a large wooden door.

Emma was taken aback by the grand hall before her. "Let's go," Ethan said, taking her inside.

"See if anything's missing," Ethan said, leading Emma around the room.

"Mistress, let me know if you need anything, and I'll get it for you," Xiaoxue offered.

Emma surveyed the house for a while. Downstairs was a large living room with traditional furniture, and a screen separated a small study. She followed the stairs upstairs, where there was a small bedroom with minimal furniture, and further down the railing was the master bedroom.

Xiaoxue opened the master bedroom door, revealing a traditional mural. Walking through the gallery, Emma saw the high-end furnishings and arrangements. It was the largest bedroom she'd ever seen.

Emma was so absorbed in observing the room's layout that she didn't speak for a while, her face showing sheer amazement.

"Is anything missing?" Ethan asked, concerned.

"No... everything's here," Emma replied awkwardly, looking at him before sitting down on a chair. "I'm a bit tired, I'll rest for a while."

"Xiaoxue, you can leave now," Ethan instructed.

"I'll be just outside in the courtyard. Call me if you need anything," Xiaoxue said before leaving the room and closing the door behind her.
