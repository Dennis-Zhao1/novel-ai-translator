Sorry, She's Already Got a Dance Partner

With just two hours to go until the wedding ceremony, the dressing room was buzzing with excitement. A group of people were gathered, chatting about the wedding schedule.

"We're almost there," Henry Baker said, taking a sip of his coffee before heading over to grab a fruit platter.

"Alright, let's head out for some photos," the wedding planner reminded the photographer, steering everyone outside for some scenic shots.

"Alright, groom, put your arm around the bride's waist. Yes, just like that, now look into each other's eyes. Perfect," the photographer enthusiastically directed.

"Let's get a few more of just the couple, then we'll snap some group shots," the photographer guided everyone slowly across the lawn.

"Okay, now let's have the bridesmaids and groomsmen join in. Each groomsman, hold your bridesmaid by the waist, bridesmaids, look up at your partner's face, and groomsmen, look towards me," he instructed.

Ethan Clark gently took Emma Thomas's hand, pulling her close, sliding his right hand across her back to rest on her waist. She felt the warmth of his hand and blushed slightly. Ethan looked down at her and said, "Let's take a good photo."

"Come on, you two, let's keep it moving," the photographer encouraged, glancing over at them.

Ethan held her close, his eyes fixed on the camera in the distance, while she slowly looked up at him, noticing his sharp jawline and feeling a soft glow of affection in her eyes.

"Alright, we're done with this set," the photographer announced after taking the shot.

Henry Baker, full of curiosity, rushed over to the photographer to borrow the camera and check out the photos. "Wow, didn't realize I looked this good today," Henry said, admiring himself before turning to the bride and groom. "But honestly, the star of the day is still William Jones, and Chloe Robinson looks stunning."

"You look beautiful today, Chloe Robinson," added one of the bridesmaids, Lily.

"Thanks, but I gotta say, this picture makes Ethan and Emma look like a married couple already," Chloe commented, pointing at the photo.

"You're right!" Henry exclaimed, glancing at Ethan Clark with surprise.

"Emma, with her tall and graceful figure and fair skin, really complements Ethan," Chloe continued, making Emma blush even more, her hands wrapped around Ethan's arm.

"The rehearsal's about to start, right?" Ethan said, breaking the teasing atmosphere as they all headed back to the dressing room.

"Hey everyone, how's it going?" The wedding host asked as they entered, not even having a chance to sit down.

"We're ready for the rehearsal," Henry announced, gathering everyone to head back out to the lawn.

"Alright, let's go."

The group moved outside for the rehearsal, and soon after, the wedding officially began.

"Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon," the host cheerfully opened the ceremony.

As the wedding unfolded, guests began to enjoy themselves, some dancing on the lawn, others chatting casually with drinks in hand.

"Ethan, that's Mr. Chen from LS. He's the one investing in the thermos project you're working on. Want to say hello?" Henry Baker suggested, nodding towards the man.

Ethan glanced over and said, "You go ahead."

Henry then slowly made his way over, and Emma Thomas watched him go, turning to Ethan, "You should go too. I'll be fine."

"Wait here for me," Ethan gently brushed her hair back, giving her a reassuring look.

"Okay."

He too moved towards the group, leaving Emma sitting by herself at the table, observing the varied crowd around her. Many seemed to be here for networking.

She scanned the crowd for Ethan, seeing him mingling with several suit-clad individuals. "Looks like he's here for business too," she thought.

"Hey, Emma, want to join for a dance?" Lily appeared beside her, interrupting her thoughts.

"Oh, you go ahead. I'm not much of a dancer," Emma replied awkwardly.

"Alright, I'll see you later," Lily said, heading off into the crowd.

Emma sat alone at the table, looking at her glass of red wine, just about to take a sip when a guy stopped her.

"Hey there, drinking alone isn't much fun," he said, taking her glass and placing it in front of himself.

"Excuse me, that's my drink. Please give it back," Emma said, trying to keep her cool despite the rudeness.

"Don't be upset; it's a wedding. Let's keep the mood light," he continued, teasing her.

"If you know that, why be so disrespectful?" Emma challenged him.

"Just messing around, no need to take it seriously," he said, placing the glass back in front of her. "I just thought a pretty girl like you shouldn't be sitting alone. Wanted to get to know you."

"Sorry, I'm not interested," Emma said firmly, taking a sip of her wine.

"Okay, then how about a dance?" The guy asked, trying a different approach.

"Sorry, she's already got a dance partner," a clear voice called out from nearby. Ethan Clark approached, holding his glass.

Emma felt a wave of relief wash over her as she saw him.

The guy looked at Ethan, then back at Emma, "He's your partner?"

Before Emma could answer, Ethan stepped next to her, taking her hand, "Sir, I'm sorry, but this lady is my dance partner."

With that, he led Emma to the dance floor. Emma wrapped her arms around his neck, both feeling each other's breath.

"In the future, just say you're married," Ethan said with a hint of jealousy, looking down at her.

"I think I handled it okay," Emma replied, slightly pouting as she met his gaze, a spark passing between them.

"People out here are more complicated than on campus," Ethan gently reminded her.

"By the way, my dad asked about the Thomas Group acquisition. I didn't tell him," she shared something personal, perhaps the start of love?

"He probably guessed I was involved, but it's alright. Soon, the Thomas Group will have a new leader," Ethan said softly, looking at her warmly.

"You're a great dancer," Ethan complimented her before she could respond.

"Thank you," Emma smiled back at him.

After the wedding, guests gradually left, and once everyone had gone, Ethan and Emma drove home together.
