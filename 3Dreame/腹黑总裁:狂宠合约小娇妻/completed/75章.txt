A Year of Love: Emma and Ethan's Story

A year had flown by in the blink of an eye. Sunlight trickled into the bedroom, nudging Emma Thomas awake. She turned over and snuggled into Ethan Clark's arms, her voice still thick with sleep. "I don't want to get up today," she murmured, closing her eyes again.

Ethan wrapped her small frame even tighter, his voice soft and indulgent. "Then stay in bed until you feel like getting up."

"But I can't," Emma suddenly remembered, sitting up abruptly. "I have a meeting today." As she tried to get out of bed, Ethan pulled her back.

"I'll go for you. You stay and rest," he offered, his tone tender and reassuring.

"Are you sure you can handle it?" Emma asked, her eyes full of hope as she gazed at him.

"I've filled in for you countless times this past year. What's one more?" Ethan said, playfully flicking her nose.

Emma grinned, holding onto his arm like a happy kid. "You're the best."

"Why don't you just hand over Thomas Group to me entirely?" Emma teased, a mischievous glint in her eye. "That way, I can kick back a little."

"Are you suggesting I become the CEO?" Ethan laughed, amused by her antics.

"Why not?" Emma replied with mock seriousness, clearly warming to the idea.

"You know, this could actually work," she mused, her mind racing with possibilities. "I wouldn't have to attend any more boring meetings."

"I was just kidding. Don't take it seriously," Ethan quickly clarified, worried she might actually consider it.

"But I think it’s a fantastic idea. Let's do it!" Emma chuckled.

"No way," Ethan said firmly. "I can cover your meetings, but the Thomas Group is yours. Consider me your right-hand man."

"Fine," Emma pouted, giving in.

"Alright, my little foodie, what do you want for dinner?" Ethan asked, looking at her with a tender smile.

"Hmm... I haven't decided yet," Emma admitted, glancing at Ethan and feeling grateful to be with him.

"Take your time deciding while I get ready for work," Ethan suggested, heading to the bathroom.

"How about those desserts from that place downtown we tried last time?" Ethan called back over his shoulder.

"They were pretty good!" Emma replied, her face lighting up at the memory.

"I'll bring some back at lunch," Ethan promised, then headed off to get ready.

"Okay," Emma smiled, sinking back into the bed.

"I'm off to the office," Ethan said, leaning down to press a kiss on her forehead.

"Drive safe," Emma called after him, watching him leave with a smile.

"Will do."

Once Ethan had left, Emma lay back, basking in the warmth of their life together. Their days were filled with love and laughter—a forever kind of love.

The End.
