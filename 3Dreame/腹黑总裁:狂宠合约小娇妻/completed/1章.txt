Emma Thomas Agrees to the Marriage

In the bustling heart of Oakridge, a grand mansion sat majestically on Serenity Street. The lavish second-floor living room echoed with the voices of two women deep in conversation.

Lounging lazily on a plush sofa was a young woman in her early twenties, her skin pale and smooth. Her long, honey-brown hair cascaded over her shoulders, and she wore a silk robe while holding a glass of vintage red wine. "Mom, do you think she'll agree?"

"Don't worry, she doesn't have a choice," replied a middle-aged woman with short, curly hair, dressed in a blue robe. She picked up her wine glass and moved to sit beside her daughter. "I'll handle your father. You can relax."

Upstairs, in the master bedroom, a deep voice belonging to a nearly fifty-year-old man, Oliver Thomas, resonated, "Zoe, let me think about this."

Samantha Williams, a woman with an alluring presence, massaged Oliver's shoulders as she spoke, "Dear, Samuel Clark is a well-known entrepreneur in River City. Emma Thomas marrying into their family is a big step up for us."

"Our company is in a tight spot and desperately needs a cash injection. Would you really let your life's work go to waste?" Samantha continued, "Look around Oakridge and River Cityâ€”where else can we find a company willing to invest $30 million into Group Thomas?"

"Alright, I'll consider it," Oliver replied.

"Oh, and Ethan Clark mentioned visiting on Saturday. I didn't refuse. Maybe they should meet then?"

"Let them meet. I'll talk to Emma Thomas tomorrow."

Samantha's face lit up with satisfaction. Her plan was to marry off Emma Thomas, paving the way for her daughter, Ava Thomas, to seamlessly take over Group Thomas. That way, she and Ava would become the true controllers of the company.

"If Ava were in Emma's place, would you want her to marry into the Clark family?" Oliver asked slowly.

"Darling, we have no other choice. In the face of family interests, I know where my priorities lie," Samantha answered, her conscience tugging at her words as she sighed.

"Don't worry; I won't let Ava follow her sister's path," Oliver reassured, patting Samantha's hand gently.

The next day, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Oliver and Samantha sat down for dinner. As they started eating, Oliver suddenly realized Emma Thomas hadn't joined them.

"Linda, where's Emma?" Oliver inquired.

"Sir, Miss Emma said she's not feeling well and went upstairs to rest," Linda replied.

"Not feeling well? What's wrong?" Oliver asked, putting down his fork.

"She mentioned having a slight fever, but she said she'd be fine after some rest."

"Alright, I'll go check on her." Oliver wiped his mouth and headed upstairs.

"Emma, are you resting? Can I come in?" he asked, gently knocking on the door.

"Come in," Emma replied.

"Emma, are you feeling alright? Let me check on you," Oliver said, stepping inside.

"I'm fine, Dad. I took some medicine, and the fever's gone down."

"Linda, go to the kitchen and make some chicken soup with veggies, and prepare a few side dishes for Miss Emma," Oliver instructed.

Emma felt uneasy with this sudden display of concern. Since her mother's passing and her father's remarriage, all his affection had shifted to her younger sister. She'd been raised by her grandmother and had never received this kind of attention.

"Sure," Linda said, leaving the room.

"Dad, I'm okay. I'll just rest a bit longer," Emma reassured.

"Since you're up, I wanted to discuss something with you," Oliver said cautiously.

Emma's heart sank. She knew her father's newfound attentiveness must come with strings attached.

"What is it?" she asked, bracing herself.

Oliver paused briefly. "Do you remember Samuel Clark, whom I used to mention when you were little?"

"Vaguely. You said he was a business partner."

"That's right. Now, Samuel Clark has a son, a handsome young man who's already achieved quite a bit in his career. He's of marrying age, and our families have more than just business ties; we have a strong personal bond. He's expressed interest in marrying you. What do you think?"

Marriage? A business alliance? Emma was taken aback. She hadn't even graduated yet and now faced a marriage proposal from someone she'd never met.

"Do you want me to marry for business reasons?" Emma asked incredulously.

"Emma, to be honest, our company is struggling financially. We can't gather the funds we need right now," Oliver explained. "If we align with Group Clark through marriage, they'll not only help us financially but also support our business in River City. I'm out of options here."

Emma's anger flared as she processed her father's words. She couldn't believe he was willing to sacrifice her future for financial gain.

"Just because of the company's issues, you want me to marry a stranger? Dad, I'm your daughter too!" Emma exclaimed.

Oliver moved to sit beside Emma, taking her hand gently. "Emma, this company is my life's work. I can't think of any other solution," he sighed. "I've known Samuel Clark for years. You won't be mistreated."

"But if Group Clark is so powerful, why do they need to marry into our family?" Emma questioned, puzzled by the Clark family's motives.

"I think it's about establishing a foothold for their branch office here," Oliver speculated. "Ethan Clark doesn't have much influence within his company. The board is full of scheming individuals, and Ethan needs support to gain their confidence. By managing their new branch here, marrying into our family offers him significant advantages."

"Dad, I don't want to marry someone I've never met," Emma said firmly.

"He's coming by on Saturday. Why don't you meet him first?" Oliver suggested.

"And if I refuse?" Emma countered.

"The hospital called this morning. Your uncle's condition has improved. With continued treatment, he might recover. You wouldn't want his treatment to stop, would you?"

"You're blackmailing me," Emma accused, her voice filled with anger.

Growing up with her grandmother and living with her uncle's family, Emma couldn't bear the thought of her beloved uncle's treatment being halted. She faced a tough choice: sell the house her mother left her or agree to the marriage. Selling the house was out of the question; it held too many cherished memories.

"I'll agree, but you must promise my uncle's treatment continues until he recovers," Emma bargained.

"Then it's settled. Ethan Clark will visit on Saturday. Dress nicely," Oliver said, leaving the room with a satisfied smile.

Emma stared blankly out the window, her heart heavy. A faint, ironic smile played on her lips as she lamented her misfortune in being born into such a family, where even her right to choose her own marriage was denied, envying the freedom of children from ordinary families.
