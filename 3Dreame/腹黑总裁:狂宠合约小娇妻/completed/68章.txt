"Remember to Wait for Me"

Emma Thomas woke up after what felt like an eternity of napping. She glanced at the clock: it was 1:20 PM. Yawning, she stretched and sat up, feeling a bit disoriented. Turning around, she noticed Ethan Clark sitting at the desk, his eyes focused on the takeout beside him. 

"Did you not eat yet?" Emma asked, curiosity piqued.

Ethan looked up, a gentle smile playing on his lips. "I didn't want to wake you. You seemed to be having such a nice nap."

Emma chuckled awkwardly. What a goofball. It was late, and he still hadn't eaten.

"I'm heading out. Make sure you eat, okay?" Emma said as she tidied up her clothes and left the office.

Ethan watched her go, then turned back to his meal, finally digging in. The afternoon passed slowly, with Emma busy all day until it was finally time to clock out.

"Ready to head out?" Sophia Wright asked quietly, swinging her backpack over her shoulder as she approached Emma's desk.

Emma glanced over at Ethan's office. He was deep in conversation with Lily Lewis.

"Let's go," Emma said, shifting her gaze from Ethan's office back to her own desk.

"You're not waiting for him?" Sophia asked, a hint of curiosity in her voice.

"I'll go with you," Emma replied softly, packing up her things and standing up.

Meanwhile, Ethan noticed Emma leaving from the corner of his eye. Is she leaving already? He thought, a bit flustered. "Let's wrap this up for today," he said to Lily, closing the files on his desk.

"You can go now," Ethan said hurriedly to Lily, seeing that Emma had already left. He quickly tidied up his documents and rushed out of the office.

Emma and Sophia made their way to the subway entrance. Just as Emma was about to enter, she heard someone calling her name across the road.

"Emma Thomas," Ethan called out loudly.

Emma turned around, scanning for the voice, and finally spotted Ethan's car parked by the curb.

"It's Ethan," Sophia noted, following Emma's gaze to the car.

"Go on," Sophia urged, letting go of Emma's arm and motioning her to cross the street.

"I'll head home, then."

"See you tomorrow," Sophia said, waving as she headed into the subway station.

Emma crossed the street and got into Ethan's car. 

"Why didn't you wait for me?" Ethan asked, genuinely curious.

"I had plans with Sophia to take the subway home," Emma replied, a bit embarrassed.

"Next time, remember to wait for me," Ethan said softly.

Emma looked down, not saying a word. Ethan glanced at her, wondering if he had upset her somehow.

"It's not convenient for you to take the subway with how far our home is," Ethan said, gently taking her hand.

"Okay," Emma nodded, feeling a bit flustered at how earnest he looked.

"How was your first day?" Ethan asked, trying to gauge her feelings. He didn't want his wife to have a bad first day at work.

Emma smiled, looking at his face. "It was good. My coworkers are really nice."

Seeing her smile, Ethan felt relieved. "That's great."

After a short drive, they finally arrived home.

"Welcome back, Mr. and Mrs. Clark," Grace Gonzalez greeted them warmly at the door.

"Mrs. Clark, you must be exhausted after your first day," Grace said, taking Emma's bag.

Emma smiled at Grace. "I adjusted pretty well today, actually."

"That's wonderful to hear," Grace said happily, leading them inside.

"What’s for dinner, Grace?" Emma asked, curiosity getting the better of her. She was starving after a long day.

"All your favorite dishes, Mrs. Clark," Grace replied cheerfully.

"I’ll just head upstairs to look over some files," Ethan said as he parked the car and entered the living room.

"Okay, I'll call you when dinner’s ready," Emma said, watching him go.

Emma followed Grace into the kitchen, where the delicious aroma hit her immediately. "Smells amazing."

"Just waiting on the chicken soup," Grace said, lifting the lid for Emma to see.

"Smells heavenly," Emma said, her mouth practically watering.

"Dinner will be ready in about twenty minutes. Why don’t you rest for a bit?"

Emma nodded and settled onto the couch, taking a moment to reflect on her day.

Work isn't too hectic; I have plenty of free time. Plus, chatting with coworkers beats being alone at home any day. Not bad at all.

She picked up her phone and opened Instagram, curious about what her coworkers were up to. She found Lily Lewis’s profile and noticed it was full of motivational quotes and pictures.

"Day 1592 of working out," Emma read aloud, her eyes widening. Wow, no wonder she seems so sophisticated. She's definitely someone I should learn from.

She clicked on another coworker’s profile and was again amazed.

"Project wrap-up for the day," Emma read, glancing at the timestamp. "Posted at 4:37 AM."

Wow, my coworkers are really dedicated. Compared to them, I'm living a pretty relaxed life.

I wonder what time Ethan goes to bed? He's always up when I wake up. If his employees are this dedicated, he must be even busier.

Emma pondered this, staring in disbelief at her phone.

"Mrs. Clark, dinner's ready," Grace announced, coming over to the sofa.

"Great, I'll go get Ethan," Emma said, standing up and heading upstairs.

She approached the study, noticing the door was ajar, and walked in quietly.

"Busy? Dinner's ready," Emma said, seeing Ethan focused at his desk.

"Okay," Ethan replied softly.

Emma noticed his furrowed brow, sensing he was stressed. "Everything okay?" Emma asked, concerned.
