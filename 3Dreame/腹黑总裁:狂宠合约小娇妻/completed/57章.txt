"Are you really that into my nose?" Ethan teased with a playful smirk.

"Hey, you two, chat away while I go grab us some lunch. Emma, Ethan, why don't you stick around and eat with us?" Aunt Linda stood up, ready to head out, when Ethan suddenly had a thought.

"Aunt Linda, do you always get food from outside?" Ethan asked, curiosity piqued.

"Yeah, I usually go out to buy it," Aunt Linda replied, looking a bit flustered.

Ethan noticed her discomfort and realized why. This place was a pretty upscale nursing home, and the cafeteria prices were a bit steep for an average family.

"Aunt Linda, you all chat, I'll go get it," Ethan offered, giving Emma a quick wink. "Be right back," he whispered.

Ethan left the room and made his way to the sixth floor, knocking gently on an office door.

"Come in," a voice called.

"Ethan Clark, what brings you here?" Dr. Wang, the head of the facility, looked up in surprise as Ethan walked in.

"It's been a while, Dr. Wang," Ethan greeted warmly.

"Ethan, you should have let me know you were coming. I would have come to meet you," Dr. Wang said, ushering Ethan to a seat.

"I actually need a small favor," Ethan mentioned casually.

"You could have just called. No need to come all this way," Dr. Wang replied, handing Ethan a cup of water.

"My wife's uncle is currently in room 207. The family's finances are a bit tight, so could you arrange for the cafeteria to send meals over?" Ethan explained.

"Consider it done. Starting right now, we'll deliver three meals a day," Dr. Wang assured him, reaching for the phone to make the arrangements.

After hanging up, Dr. Wang asked, "Why didn't you mention this earlier? We would have made arrangements."

"I didn't want to trouble you with something so minor," Ethan said, standing up to leave. As he reached the door, he added, "Please send lunch for four today."

Ethan returned to the hospital room, greeted by Emma's curious glance.

"Back already?" Emma asked, puzzled. "Where's the food?"

Before Ethan could respond, there was a knock at the door.

"Mr. Meng, here's your lunch," a staff member announced, wheeling in a cart laden with food.

"What's all this?" Emma asked, eyes widening at the spread.

"The head of the facility arranged for it. Starting today, I'll be delivering meals every day," the staff member explained while setting the food on the table.

"The head of the facility?" Emma looked at Ethan, bewildered. Was he the one behind this? Did he own the place? Suddenly, the smooth admission process made sense.

Ethan clarified, "I know Dr. Wang, so I asked for a little help."

"Ethan, you've already done so much for us. We can handle our own meals," Aunt Linda said, clearly uncomfortable.

"Yeah, we can manage," Uncle Tom chimed in.

"Aunt Linda, Uncle Tom, honestly, it's no trouble at all," Ethan reassured them.

Emma watched Ethan, speechless for a moment.

"Let's eat," Ethan urged, gesturing for them to sit.

"Aunt Linda, join us," Emma echoed, inviting her over.

"The meals are tailored for patients, so make sure to check the yellow bag for Uncle Tom's special diet," Ethan instructed. "The hospital customizes meals to meet his dietary needs."

"Thank you," Aunt Linda said, taking note.

Emma sampled the food. "Wow, the cafeteria food is really good. It's got a nice mix of everything," she marveled, savoring the taste.

Ethan chuckled at her delight. "You're easy to please."

Emma glanced at Ethan, about to retort, but Uncle Tom interjected, "Emma's never been picky. She'd eat whatever her grandma made, always praising it even if it wasn't great. She's always been a little flatterer."

Emma blushed, embarrassed but happy to see Uncle Tom in better spirits.

After lunch, as Uncle Tom seemed to tire, Emma prepared to leave.

"Uncle, you should rest. Don't overexert yourself," Emma advised, pulling a chair close to the bed.

"I'm okay, I'll nap in a bit," Uncle Tom said weakly, his eyes lingering on Emma.

Feeling protective, Emma decided not to disturb him further.

"Uncle, it's getting late. We'll head out now, but we'll visit again soon," Emma promised, reluctant to leave.

"Take care," Uncle Tom whispered before lying back down.

With goodbyes said, Emma and Ethan stepped out of the nursing home. Ethan opened the car door for Emma, but she paused, looking at him thoughtfully.

I should really thank him. This wouldn't have been so smooth without his help. I've been too hard on him before.

Lost in thought, Ethan noticed her hesitation. "What's up?" he asked, concerned.

"Nothing," Emma replied, shaking her head lightly before getting in the car.

On the drive, Emma finally spoke up. "Ethan."

"Yeah?" Ethan responded, curious about the long silence.

"Thank you," Emma said, her voice tinged with embarrassment.

"For today?" Ethan asked, giving her hand a reassuring squeeze. "It's nothing, really."

Emma admired his sharp jawline, suddenly captivated by his features.

He's really handsome, she thought, her eyes tracing the curve of his nose.

Without thinking, she reached out, gently touching the tip of his nose with her finger. Ethan froze, surprised by her unexpected gesture.

Ethan caught her finger, his voice soft and teasing. "You really like my nose that much?"

Emma snapped back to reality, embarrassed. "Not just today, thanks for the help with the shares too."

Ethan smiled, "We're partners, no need to thank me."
