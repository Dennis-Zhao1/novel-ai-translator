Ethan Clark finally managed to escape the clutches of the Xu Mansion. The next morning, he woke up with a pounding headache, the kind that made him question every decision from the previous night. Flashes of Emma Thomas yelling his name came to mind. Did he really mess up that badly?

Turning to his side, he saw Emma, still asleep but with swollen eyes, as if she had cried all night. Guilt hit him like a tidal wave. What did he do to her?

While Ethan was busy mentally kicking himself, Emma stirred awake. The moment she saw him, her eyes widened in fear, and she pulled the covers tightly around herself.

"Emma..." Ethan started, feeling a pang of regret. He reached out, then thought better of it and withdrew his hand.

"Don't come near me," Emma whispered, her voice laced with disappointment.

"I'm sorry," Ethan muttered, feeling utterly useless.

Like a sorry could fix everything. Did he even realize the damage he'd done?

A knock on the door interrupted their tense silence. "Mr. Clark, Ms. Thomas, breakfast is ready with Grandma," called out Xiao Xue, the family's long-time housekeeper.

"We'll be right there," Ethan replied, trying to sound normal. But internally, he was a mess. How could he make it up to Emma? Last time, she asked for shares in the company, but if he gave away more, he'd be left with barely anything.

Ethan racked his brain for a solution and finally sat down next to Emma. "I'll give you a million dollars," he offered gently.

Emma's eyes widened in disbelief. A million dollars? Was he seriously trying to put a price on everything she had been through?

She let out a bitter laugh. So that's all she was worth to him—just another transaction.

"I want shares," Emma stated coldly.

Ethan had expected this. "No shares. How about three million?"

Emma chuckled sadly. Three million? He really thought he was a shrewd businessman. Shares were worth way more than that.

"Ten million, now," Emma said, pulling out her phone and sending him her bank details. She was done. Done with feeling anything for him. It was just business now. If she had to go through this, she might as well get something out of it.

"Done," Ethan said after transferring the money. He felt a pang of something—was it sorrow, regret?—as he watched Emma's expression harden.

"Let's go," Emma said curtly once the transaction was complete.

Ethan watched her walk away, feeling a deep sense of loss. Why did he have to drink so much? Why did he do things that hurt her?

They both got ready and headed to Grandma's dining room. As soon as they entered, Grandma's face lit up with joy.

Emma plastered on a smile, masking her inner turmoil. "Good morning, Grandma."

"Emma, Ethan, you're here!" Grandma beamed, motioning for Emma to sit beside her.

Ethan took the seat next to Emma, feeling the weight of her cold shoulder.

"You're leaving today?" Grandma asked, her voice tinged with sadness.

"Yes, Grandma, but we'll visit you often," Emma reassured her, managing to sound sincere despite the chaos inside her.

Ethan found himself amazed at how quickly Emma could shift her emotions. Her resilience was something he hadn't appreciated enough.

"Emma, this bracelet has always been my favorite. I'm too old for it now, so I'd like you to have it," Grandma said, taking off an elegant bracelet and offering it to Emma.

Eleanor Murphy, Ethan's mother, gasped. "Mom, that's your dowry bracelet!"

"Yes, Grandma, you never gave me anything like that," Ethan's cousin chimed in, a hint of jealousy in her voice.

Emma understood the bracelet's significance. It was too much for a contract wife like her to accept. "Grandma, this is too precious. I can't take it," she said, trying to return the bracelet.

"It's meant for my future granddaughter-in-law. Keep it. I gave your sister-in-law a jade pendant before," Grandma insisted.

The table fell silent as Emma struggled with what to do. Future granddaughter-in-law? She wasn't really Ethan's wife, just a temporary stand-in. How could she accept such a valuable gift?

"Grandma, why don't you hold onto it for now? You can give it to your great-grandchild when the time comes," Emma suggested, hoping it was a foolproof excuse.

What did she mean by that? Was she really not planning to stick around?

Ethan pondered her words, realizing just how deeply he had hurt her. He needed to find a way to make things right.

"Alright, I'll keep it safe for you," Grandma said, smiling as she took back the bracelet. "I can't wait for a great-grandchild."

I'm so sorry, Grandma, Emma thought. She hated deceiving her, but one day, she'd make things right.

"Let's eat. Finish up so you can pack," Grandma said, placing a piece of cake on Emma's plate.

"Thank you, Grandma," Emma said, focusing on her food to avoid further conversation.

After breakfast, everyone dispersed. As Emma and Ethan prepared to leave, Grandma stopped them. "Ethan, Emma, take care."

"You should come back and visit often," Grandma added. "Ethan, you better treat Emma well. And Emma, if he doesn't, you tell me. I'll set him straight."

Emma's heart ached with guilt. They hadn't spent much quality time with Grandma, and now they were leaving. "Grandma, next time I visit, I'll bring you the best pastries from Woodtown."

"Oh, I'm looking forward to that," Grandma said, patting Emma's hand warmly.

"You two get going. The sun's getting hotter by the minute," Grandma urged as she watched the sun climb higher in the sky.

Hand in hand, Ethan and Emma bid farewell to Grandma and left the dining room.

Emma's beauty was striking, with a face that reminded Grandma so much of someone she used to know. Ethan would take care of her, Grandma reassured herself, sitting alone with her thoughts as she removed her glasses.

And so, the day unfolded with a mix of farewells, promises, and unspoken emotions, leaving Ethan and Emma to navigate the complicated path their lives had taken.
