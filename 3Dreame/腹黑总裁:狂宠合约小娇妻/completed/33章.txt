Emma Thomas was sitting in the waiting area, fiddling with her resume, when a young woman escorted her and a few other recent college grads up to the third floor waiting room. Emma had been waiting for nearly half an hour, feeling a mix of excitement and nerves.

"You went to Woodsville University too?" a guy next to her asked, glancing at the university logo on her resume.

"Yeah, I did," Emma replied with a friendly nod.

"Small world! I'm from the finance department. What about you?" he continued, clearly eager to chat.

"I'm actually from the..." Emma started, but a woman interrupted her.

"Next up, Emma Thomas," called a voice from the conference room door.

Emma stood up, giving the guy a polite smile as she headed in for her interview. "Here I go," she said, following the woman into the room.

Facing the panel of interviewers, Emma took a deep breath. "Hello, I’m Emma Thomas. I just graduated from Woodsville University, and I’m here to interview for the engineer position at your company."

The interview was intense, but Emma felt she handled the questions perfectly. Then came the big one: "Why did you choose to apply to Moan Corp?" one of the interviewers asked.

"I believe your company is a leader in the industry, and your vision aligns perfectly with my career goals," Emma answered sincerely.

"Okay, final question: when can you start?"

"Tomorrow!" Emma replied, her excitement barely contained.

After the interview, Emma was relieved. As she stepped out of the building, her phone buzzed. She had an offer from HR. She couldn’t help but jump for joy. Flagging a taxi, she headed home.

At home, her good mood was apparent. Grace Gonzalez, her housekeeper, approached her with a knowing smile. "You seem happy today, Mrs. Thomas. Did you see Mr. Clark?"

Emma paused, nodding slowly. "Yeah, I did."

She headed up to her study, clutching her offer letter, thrilled beyond words. “Starting the day after tomorrow. How am I going to tell him?” she mused aloud.

Outside, a sleek car pulled up. Ethan Clark stepped out, greeted by Grace. "Welcome home, sir. Dinner’s ready."

Loosening his tie, Ethan moved toward the dining room. "Where’s Emma?"

"She went upstairs after returning from seeing you," Grace replied, a bit puzzled.

"She went out?" Ethan seemed surprised. "She said she was worried about you eating out and took you lunch."

"I didn’t see her," Ethan said, realizing Emma might not have delivered lunch at all.

Heading upstairs, Ethan found Emma in the study, lost in her phone. He took it from her gently.

"Hey!" Emma exclaimed, turning around, her words dying on her lips. She watched as Ethan glanced at the offer on the screen. His brow furrowed slightly. "You got an offer?"

He opened a job app, reviewing her resume. "Your resume is impressive."

Emma’s mind raced. "What does he mean by that?" she wondered.

"You went to an interview today under the pretense of delivering me lunch?" Ethan asked, his gaze softening.

"Yeah, I..." Emma took back her phone, feeling sheepish.

"Do you really want to work that much?" Ethan leaned closer, causing Emma’s cheeks to flush as she met his gaze.

"I want to earn my own money," she replied softly. Growing up, financial independence had always been crucial to her.

"Why not work at my company? I’ll pay you double," Ethan offered, watching her intently.

Emma lifted her eyes, momentarily tempted, but then shook her head. "I don’t want to work at your company," she said quietly.

"Why not? A job’s a job," Ethan persisted gently.

"You don’t have a position that suits me. I can’t just be your assistant," Emma pointed out.

"Why not? It could work," Ethan teased.

"I graduated in computer science. I need something in my field," Emma explained, her voice tinged with urgency.

"You’ll need to learn finance eventually to manage the Thomas Group," Ethan said, laying it out plainly.

"I can learn while working elsewhere," Emma insisted.

"Learning on the job is crucial, and I can help you advance faster at my company," Ethan countered.

Emma stood firm. "No, thanks."

Ethan sighed, backing off. "No rush. Think about it. Let’s have dinner."

As Ethan left, Emma sat pondering his offer, feeling a twinge of regret about her hasty decision to interview elsewhere.

"Ethan," he called someone as he left the room.

"Yes, boss," came the voice of his assistant, Daniel Johnson.

"I need you to handle something for me. I'll send the details to your phone," Ethan said before hanging up.

Soon after, as Emma headed downstairs, her phone rang.

"Hello."

"Hi, is this Emma Thomas?" The voice was familiar.

"Yes, this is Emma. Are you from Moan Corp's HR?" she guessed, feeling a knot in her stomach.

"Yes, we met earlier. I’m sorry, but our leadership has decided not to fill the position at this time. I apologize for the inconvenience."

"You mean I don’t start tomorrow?" Emma asked, stunned.

"Unfortunately, yes. If the position opens up again, you will be our first consideration."

Emma hung up, feeling deflated. Her excitement had soured into disappointment, and she trudged downstairs, her mood as turbulent as a rollercoaster ride.
