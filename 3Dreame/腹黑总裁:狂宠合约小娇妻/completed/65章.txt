Day One on the Job

Emma Thomas stood in front of the Clark Group building, looking up at the towering skyscraper. 

"This is my first real job. You got this, Emma!" she told herself, taking a deep breath and putting on a determined smile as she walked to the reception desk.

"Hi, I'm here to start today," Emma said in a low voice, trying to sound confident.

"Starting today? Hold on a second," the receptionist replied, glancing at her computer before turning her attention back to Emma. "Are you Emma Thomas?"

"Yes, that's me," Emma replied, maintaining her calm demeanor.

"Follow me," the receptionist said, standing up and leading Emma toward the elevator.

As they entered the elevator, the receptionist gave Emma a curious look. "Have we met before? You seem familiar."

Oh no, she thought. Did she remember me from when I delivered lunch last time? I hope she doesn't connect the dots about my relationship with Ethan Clark.

Emma quickly composed herself and replied, "Yeah, you helped me when I came for the interview."

"Ah, that's why you seem familiar," the receptionist said, seemingly satisfied with the explanation.

Emma breathed a sigh of relief, grateful her secret was safe for now.

When they reached the office, Sophia Wright spotted Emma and jumped up with excitement. 

"Emma Thomas!" Sophia exclaimed as she hurried over to greet her friend.

"You two know each other?" the receptionist asked, surprised.

"We were college classmates, and she's also... Ow!" Sophia yelped as Emma pinched her arm to stop her from revealing too much.

Emma quickly interjected, "And I was recommended for the interview by her."

The receptionist seemed to accept this explanation and left Emma in Sophia's capable hands. 

"Sophia, why'd you stop me from finishing?" Sophia asked curiously once they were alone.

Emma glanced around before leaning in to whisper, "I’m trying to keep my relationship with Ethan Clark under wraps here, so please don’t spill the beans."

"Why hide it? With your connection to Ethan, you'd have it easy here. No one would mess with you," Sophia said, puzzled.

"Just trust me on this one, okay? Are we friends or not?" Emma insisted.

"Alright, alright. I won't say a word," Sophia promised, agreeing to keep Emma's secret.

"Let's go meet your new colleagues and take a tour of the company," Sophia said, linking her arm with Emma's.

"Sounds good," Emma agreed, feeling grateful for Sophia's support.

After a quick tour of the workspace, Sophia clapped her hands to get everyone's attention. "Hey, everyone! I'd like to introduce our new assistant, Emma Thomas!" she announced to the room.

Emma felt a wave of shyness wash over her as she noticed the busy colleagues pausing to look at her.

"Emma, this is Lily Lewis, who will be guiding you," Sophia said, nodding toward a woman at a nearby desk who had been reviewing some documents.

Lily Lewis? Emma thought. That name sounded familiar. Then it hit her—that was the woman who answered the phone that day. So, she's my supervisor?

"Hi, Lily, I'm Emma Thomas," she introduced herself, trying to sound professional.

Lily gave her a once-over before saying, "So, you're Ethan Clark's new assistant, huh?"

Sophia quickly added, "Yep, she'll be working with you. Thanks for taking care of her."

Emma felt a bit nervous; Lily seemed like a tough, no-nonsense person.

"Alright, you can take the desk next to mine," Lily said, gesturing to the empty workspace beside her.

"Okay," Emma nodded, moving to settle into her new spot.

"Sophia, I'll take Emma around in about ten minutes once she’s settled," Lily said before stepping away.

Emma nodded, organizing her desk and trying to shake off her nerves. She noticed the hustle and bustle around her, feeling a bit of social anxiety creeping in.

Just then, the phone at Lily's desk rang. She answered it swiftly and then headed into Ethan Clark's office.

Emma glanced in their direction and saw Ethan sitting at his desk, looking over some papers while Lily prepared a coffee for him. Watching them interact made Emma feel a pang of jealousy.

What is wrong with me? Do I actually have feelings for him? Why am I feeling so upset about this?

"Emma, how’s it going?" Sophia's voice snapped her out of her thoughts as she returned.

"All set here," Emma replied, grateful for the distraction.

Sophia seemed to sense Emma's mood and whispered, "That’s Ethan Clark’s office, remember when you came last time?"

"You sure you want to keep this thing with Ethan a secret?" Sophia asked once more.

"Absolutely. Now show me around the company," Emma replied firmly.

"Alright, follow me," Sophia said, leading Emma through the office.

Sophia showed Emma the break room, pointing out the amenities with enthusiasm. "Here's where we relax—tables, a coffee maker, even a couch! Pretty cool, right?"

"Really nice. So, do we eat lunch here?" Emma asked, taking it all in.

"Yep! We can eat here together," Sophia said cheerfully.

"Let's check out the meeting rooms next," Sophia suggested, guiding Emma further along.

"Is this where meetings happen?" Emma asked, noticing the array of conference rooms.

"Yes, this floor has several. You’ll need to book them in the company system if Ethan needs a meeting," Sophia explained.

"Got it, I'll note that down," Emma said, jotting it into her notebook.

Just then, a group of people passed by, and Emma immediately recognized Ethan Clark among them. She quickly looked away, feeling awkward.

Is that Ethan? Right now? What timing. Should I say hi or pretend I didn’t see him?
