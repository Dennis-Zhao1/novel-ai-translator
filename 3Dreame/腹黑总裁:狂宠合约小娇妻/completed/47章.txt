Unexpected Encounter with Charlotte Jones

"Let's go for a walk before dinner," Ethan Clark said, pulling Emma Thomas towards the door.

"Dinner? Didn't we just have lunch?" Emma Thomas looked up at Ethan, surprised.

"You took a nap after lunch, and now it's already 4 PM," Ethan replied with a fond smile.

Emma blushed, looking down at her feet. "Are we having dinner with your grandma and everyone else too?" she asked nervously, fidgeting with her dress.

"Why? You don't want to join them?" Ethan teased, glancing down at her.

"It's not that," Emma stammered, trying to explain, but Ethan cut her off with a gentle chuckle. "I know," he said.

As they reached the lake, Ethan pointed towards the water. "Look at those lilies. Aren't they beautiful?"

Emma followed his gaze and saw the pond filled with blooming lilies. "They're gorgeous," she agreed.

"Let's get a closer look," Emma suggested, releasing Ethan's hand and jogging ahead.

From a distance, they heard a middle-aged man's apologetic voice. "Please, calm down, ma'am." Emma looked up to see a graceful woman approaching them.

"Let go of me! Why wasn't I invited to lunch?" the woman demanded, shaking off the man's hand.

"Ma'am, please..." the man began but stopped when he noticed Ethan and Emma nearby. He quickly let go of the woman's hand and adjusted his suit jacket.

"Ethan, you're back," the man greeted, eyeing Ethan with a smile.

"Uncle, Charlotte Jones," Ethan acknowledged, introducing Emma. "This is Emma Thomas, my uncle."

Emma was taken aback. If this man was Ethan's uncle, then this woman must be the one she'd heard about.

"Hello, Uncle. Nice to meet you, Charlotte Jones," Emma greeted politely.

"Emma Thomas, right? You've grown even more beautiful," Ethan's uncle said, scrutinizing her with a smile.

"Uncle, you're too kind. Emma's beauty doesn't match Charlotte's elegance," Ethan joked, winking at his uncle.

"Haha, your brother was always more accomplished, so of course, he'd find an exceptional wife. But you and Emma make a great pair," his uncle laughed.

"Absolutely," Ethan nodded. Emma frowned slightly, about to speak, but Ethan gently held her back.

"Well, it's almost time for dinner. I'll head over first," Charlotte said haughtily, turning away.

"Ma'am, wait up!" Ethan's uncle hurried after her.

Ethan turned to Emma, pulling her close and smiling. "What are you laughing at?" Emma asked curiously. "Is she the one your mom mentioned who lives in the side wing?"

"Yes, that's Charlotte Jones," Ethan confirmed. "You saw her. She's expecting a child, which is why my grandmother hasn't sent her away."

"And Eleanor Murphy is okay with this?" Emma asked, bewildered by the family drama.

"Eleanor has no choice but to let her have the baby first," Ethan explained, meeting Emma's gaze. She blushed and pushed him away playfully.

"Okay, enough with the affection. We're in public," she said, glancing around.

"But we're surrounded by people," Ethan grinned, pulling her back into his arms. "When we're outside, you need to stay within arm's reach."

"Don't stray more than half a meter from me," he added decisively.

Emma rolled her eyes but smiled. "Let's explore a bit more before dinner," Ethan suggested, leading her around the grounds.

They wandered for a while before heading to the dining area. As they approached, they saw others heading in as well.

"Everyone's here early," Emma noted, watching the group enter.

"It's not early. It's past 5 PM," Ethan replied, checking his watch.

Emma was surprised. "Time flies! Wasn't it just 4 PM?"

Ethan chuckled. "It takes at least 20 minutes to walk here from the bedroom, even without stopping."

"This place is huge," Emma marveled, stunned by the size of Ethan's family estate.

"Yeah, let's head inside," Ethan said, guiding her into the dining area.

"Finally decided to show up, Ethan?" A man's voice greeted them at the door. Ethan's brother came forward, extending a warm welcome.

"Hey, big bro," Ethan greeted, introducing Emma. "Emma, this is my brother."

"Hello," Emma said, smiling shyly.

"Emma's quite the beauty," a woman commented as she joined them, her presence commanding attention.

"You flatter her. Compared to you, she's still just a kid," Ethan said, holding Emma tighter.

Emma was awestruck by the woman's elegance, her tall frame and alabaster skin accentuated by a snow-white dress.

"Everyone's here!" Ethan's grandmother called out, ushering them to the table for dinner.

"Let's sit," Ethan's brother suggested, gesturing for Ethan and Emma to join them.

"Since everyone's here, I have an announcement," Ethan's grandmother began once seated.

"What is it, Mom?" Ethan's aunt asked curiously.

"I've been managing the family's properties in North City, but it's becoming too much for me," the grandmother explained, signaling a servant to bring out some documents.

"Grandma, you're still young at heart," Ethan's brother assured her.

"Indeed, Grandma," his sister-in-law agreed. Ethan and Emma remained quiet, but Emma nudged Ethan under the table.

Ethan was about to speak when his grandmother continued, "I've prepared a simple division of the properties for you to review."

After a moment, Ethan's brother protested, "Grandma, this isn't fair!"

"Exactly, Mom," Ethan's aunt chimed in. "He's the eldest, and his son is your first grandson. This division seems biased."

"During the first division, your brother and his son received 40%, you got 30%, and Ethan and his father only took 20%," the grandmother reminded them sternly.

Silence fell over the room. Ethan's brother placed the documents back on the table, grumbling, "That was Grandpa's decision. And now, this is the second division."

"Who's in charge here?" the grandmother demanded, her voice firm.

No one dared to speak, each lowering their gaze in respect and apprehension.
