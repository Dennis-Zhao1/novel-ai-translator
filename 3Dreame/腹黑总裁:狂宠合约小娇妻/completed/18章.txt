After a long drive, Ethan Clark and Emma Thomas finally made it to the city hall. It was a quiet day, and they breezed through the paperwork, posed for a photo, and just like that, they emerged as a married couple.

Emma stood outside, staring at the unfamiliar marriage certificate in her hands. "Is this for real?" she thought. "Did I just marry someone I barely know?"

Ethan, ever the bold one, snatched the certificate from her grip. "I'll hold onto this," he declared with a smirk.

"Let's get going." Ethan led the way to the car.

Once they were buckled in, Ethan mentioned, "I saw a big supermarket on the way. Let's pick up some stuff before heading to Aunt Linda's."

Emma rolled her eyes at how naturally he called her aunt by name. "Aunt Linda... already?"

Ethan chuckled, "We're legally married now, remember?"

Emma, always the careful one, reminded him, "Keep your eyes on the road."

The car was quiet until Emma's bag vibrated. But it wasn't her phone. Ethan reached into his pocket, pulled out a second phone, and answered it with a cold "Hello."

Emma's curiosity piqued. Why did he have two phones? Just then, a sultry voice on the line asked, "Ethan, when will I see you again?"

Emma cringed and covered her ears. Ethan nonchalantly replied, "I'll let you know tomorrow," before hanging up.

Emma teased, "Quite the ladies' man, aren't you?" But Ethan just focused on driving.

"Was that the girl from the bar the other night?" Emma pressed on. "She's pretty and seems like your type."

Ethan slowed down and looked at her, "Jealous?"

Emma laughed it off, "Jealous? I don't even like you that way."

They parked at the supermarket, picked up groceries, and drove to Aunt Linda's house.

At the door, Emma knocked politely. Aunt Linda answered, munching on a cucumber, her hair a mess.

"Emma! It's been ages," Aunt Linda exclaimed, pulling her inside. Ethan followed with their bags.

"When did you get back?" Aunt Linda asked, looking at Ethan.

Ethan introduced himself, "I'm Ethan, Emma's husband."

"Husband?" Aunt Linda's eyes widened as she looked at Emma, who awkwardly confirmed, "We just got our marriage license."

"Come in, sit down." Aunt Linda ushered them to the couch.

"We brought you some gifts," Emma said, nodding at Ethan, who placed the bags on the table.

"Oh, there's no need for gifts," Aunt Linda waved it off.

But her face turned somber. "Emma, your uncle..."

Emma handed her a tissue, comforting her, "He'll be okay. The doctors said there's hope."

Aunt Linda's tears fell as she explained, "The doctor called yesterday. It's not looking good... and Connor is still so young."

Ethan chimed in, "I spoke to a doctor about transferring him to a private rehab. There's a good chance of recovery."

Emma was taken aback. He'd researched her uncle's condition before they'd even gotten their license.

"Really?" Aunt Linda looked to Emma for confirmation.

Emma reassured her, "Yes, there's hope."

They stayed a while longer, but as it got late, Aunt Linda invited them for dinner. Emma politely declined, "We should get back to Grandma."

At Grandma's house, they shared the news about Uncle with her. Grandma, teary-eyed, thanked Ethan.

"Emma's a handful sometimes," Grandma added, "but she's got a good heart."

"Grandma, you don't have to—" Emma started, but Grandma cut her off.

"Let me finish. She went to live with her dad to help her uncle. She gave her mom's company to her dad to pay for the treatment."

"Grandma, enough," Emma interrupted.

"Emma, I hope Ethan treats you well. You've been through so much," Grandma said, looking at Ethan.

"Don't worry, Grandma. I'll take good care of her," Ethan promised, placing a piece of fish in Emma's bowl.

They exchanged glances before Emma quickly looked away, focusing on her food.

Later that night, Emma was already in bed, engrossed in her favorite show, when Ethan finished a call on the balcony and joined her in the bedroom.

"Where are you sleeping tonight?" Emma asked as Ethan walked in.

"On the bed, with you," Ethan replied, making Emma dive under the covers.

"No way."

"Do you expect me to sleep on the couch?" Ethan reasoned, sitting on the bed.

Emma pondered for a moment. He had a point. "Promise you won't try anything."

"No guarantees."

"You—" Emma started, but Ethan interrupted with a chuckle, "Just kidding."

"I only meant sharing the bed, nothing more. Why so tense?" Ethan teased, shifting closer. Emma shyly hid under the blankets.

Ethan lay down next to her and fiddled with his phone. Just as he was about to speak, he noticed Emma had already drifted off, her back turned to him. Smiling, he tucked her in, set his phone aside, and fell asleep too.
