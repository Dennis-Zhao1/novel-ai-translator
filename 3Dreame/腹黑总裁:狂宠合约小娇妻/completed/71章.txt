Rumors were flying around faster than a viral TikTok video. Emma Thomas had only been working at the company for a week, but whispers about her relationship with the CEO, Ethan Clark, were already spreading like wildfire.

"Emma, could you come in and make Ethan a cup of coffee?" Lily Lewis called out as she stepped out of Ethan's office.

"Sure thing," Emma replied, quickly heading into the office.

"Close the door behind you," Ethan said as Emma entered, his eyes meeting hers for a brief moment.

"Do you want it sweet or bitter today?" Emma asked softly, moving closer to Ethan's desk.

"Just like yesterday," Ethan replied with a slight smile, his gaze lingering on her as she moved to the coffee corner.

Outside the office, colleagues were exchanging glances and whispers.

"She went in again."

"And the door's closed."

"Do you think they're... you know?"

"Is she really the other woman?"

The office was buzzing with speculation about Emma and Ethan’s relationship. Every time Emma went into Ethan's office and closed the door, the rumors only grew.

Emma placed the coffee on Ethan's desk, whispering, "Here you go."

"If there's nothing else, I'll head out," Emma said cautiously, trying to keep things professional.

"Wait," Ethan's deep voice stopped her.

He looked up, his eyes softening as he asked, "How did the files I gave you yesterday go? Did you get through them?"

"I've pretty much got it all down," Emma said, nodding.

"I have a meeting with Mr. Wang tomorrow. Would you like to join?" Ethan offered, knowing how eager Emma was to learn and get involved in projects.

Emma's face lit up. This was her chance to finally step into the world of client meetings. "Really? Can I?"

"Of course," Ethan assured her. "Just come along, listen, and learn."

Emma hesitated, "But Lily usually goes with you on these projects. Wouldn't it be awkward if I suddenly took over?"

"I've already assigned Lily to another project with Mr. Wu," Ethan said, reassuring her with a gentle look. He had everything planned and was ready for Emma to step up.

"Alright, I'll go with you tomorrow," Emma agreed, her excitement barely contained.

She left the office, her heart lighter and her step quicker.

"She's out."

"Look how happy she is."

"Alright, let's get back to work."

Emma's colleagues simmered down when she returned to her desk, their curiosity momentarily satisfied. 

Lily noticed Emma's cheerful demeanor and asked, "What's got you so happy?"

Should I tell her?

Emma hesitated, wondering whether to spill the beans about the meeting. Eventually, she decided to share, leaning in closer to Lily. "Ethan wants me to join him for a meeting with Mr. Wang tomorrow."

Lily was taken aback. "Really? That soon?"

Emma nodded, feeling a bit guilty. "I know this was your project. I'm sorry."

Lily chuckled softly, "It's fine. As long as the project succeeds, it doesn't matter who leads it."

Emma felt a wave of relief. She had been worried that Lily might be upset.

"You're not mad at me?" Emma asked curiously.

"This is just business. Don't worry about it," Lily reassured her.

Emma smiled and turned back to her work, but soon her phone buzzed. It was a text from Sophia Wright.

"Emma, people are talking about you and Ethan. What's your plan?"

Emma read the text, her mood dampening slightly. She replied, "What are they saying?"

Sophia didn't text back. Instead, she appeared at Emma's desk a few moments later.

"Emma, can we talk?" Sophia asked loudly, drawing everyone's attention.

"Sure," Emma replied, following Sophia to the break area.

Once seated, Sophia poured them both a cup of coffee and leaned in. "You can't keep this under wraps much longer."

"You mean with Ethan?" Emma asked, taking a sip of her coffee.

"Yeah. The office is buzzing with rumors that you're... well, involved with him. It's getting pretty nasty," Sophia said, clearly upset on Emma's behalf.

"Let them talk. I know who I am," Emma said, trying to brush it off.

"But you and Ethan are married! How can you stand people talking about you like this?" Sophia protested, clearly frustrated.

Emma shrugged, giving Sophia a small smile. "I can't control what people say. It's their problem, not mine."

"You're really not going to tell anyone?" Sophia pressed.

Emma shook her head. "No need. I don’t want people finding out that the chairwoman of Thomas Group doesn’t know basic finance and is working as an assistant."

Emma chuckled, taking another sip of her coffee, trying to keep the mood light.
