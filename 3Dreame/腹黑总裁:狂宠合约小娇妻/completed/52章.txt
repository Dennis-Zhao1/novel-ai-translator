**Vindicated at Last**

After dinner, Emma Thomas found herself in a bit of a predicament. The house was buzzing with guests chatting away in the living room, but she barely knew anyone from this family. Feeling a bit like a fish out of water, she wandered down a path by the side garden, following the sound of a gentle stream, until she reached a serene lotus pond in the backyard. She plopped down on a bench in a small pavilion by the water, staring blankly at the blooming lotuses, her mind swirling with thoughts.

"How do I find the evidence, Auntie?" she murmured to herself. "There must be security cameras in the house, but not in the Western-style kitchen. How do I investigate?"

She replayed the events in her mind. She had poured the water, and shortly after Charlotte Jones drank it, her baby was gone. The water in the kettle was tested and was fine, so could it have been the cup?

"I took the cup from the rack," Emma thought. "There were so many cups there; she wouldn’t have known which one I'd pick. It shouldn't be an issue."

"When exactly did the water become tainted?" she pondered, lost in her thoughts.

Just then, Ethan Clark strolled up from behind and took a seat beside her, snapping her out of her reverie. "What are you doing out here?" he asked with a half-smile.

Emma hesitated, debating whether to share her suspicions with him. Then she decided to let him in on her thoughts, hoping for some insight. "I've been piecing some things together. Want to hear it?" She whispered, glancing around to ensure no one was within earshot.

"I think Auntie might be involved," Emma ventured, watching Ethan's reaction closely. She wasn't sure where she stood with him, given that this was about her family.

Ethan remained unfazed. "You already knew?" Emma asked, puzzled by his calm demeanor.

"Go on," Ethan encouraged, looking at her with a reassuring smile.

"First, Auntie was the one who insisted I go to the kitchen. Once we got there, she made an excuse to leave, leaving me alone with Charlotte Jones. Charlotte asked for water, and I poured her a cup. When Auntie came back, Charlotte's stomach pain started. It was like she wanted me alone with Charlotte so I couldn’t clear my name," Emma explained.

Emma frowned, deep in thought. "But when did the chemical get into her system? Auntie left and didn't come back, so she didn't have a chance to poison it."

"Could it be... Charlotte herself?" Emma's eyes widened in shock as the realization dawned on her.

"That's the only explanation," Emma concluded. "I gave her the water, and before drinking, she must have dropped a pill in. They conspired to set me up—one lured me to the kitchen, and the other used it against me."

"Is that really it?" Emma asked, incredulously, looking to Ethan for confirmation.

"You guessed it," Ethan affirmed, giving her hand a reassuring squeeze.

Emma still couldn't wrap her head around it. Why would Charlotte harm her own child? She was about to become a mother, after all. What reason did she have to use her baby to frame Emma?

"Why would Charlotte do this?" Emma turned to Ethan, hoping for a satisfying answer.

Ethan pulled out his phone, opened a photo, and handed it to Emma. As she looked at it, everything clicked. "She knew she couldn't keep the baby, so she decided to use the situation to her advantage."

"Come on, the guests are mostly gone. It's time to clear this up," Ethan said, pulling Emma gently as they headed back to the main house.

As they reached the entrance, they saw the family gathered around Grandma, deep in conversation. Ethan, with a determined look, led Emma inside. "Grandma," he greeted with a cool tone.

"Ethan, Emma, you're here," Grandma acknowledged, beckoning them to join.

"I've figured out what happened this morning," Ethan announced casually, drawing everyone's attention.

"Tell us," Grandma said, her smile fading as she turned serious.

"This is a copy of Charlotte Jones' medical records," Ethan said, handing his phone to Grandma. He gestured for someone to bring a USB drive and a laptop.

Grandma looked at the photo, her face falling with sadness. "So the baby was never going to make it," she sighed heavily.

The room was filled with shock. Uncle, angered, demanded to see the phone. "Even so, there's still the issue of the water," he pressed, refusing to let Emma off the hook. Auntie leaned in, nodding in agreement. "Yes, the water is the real problem."

Ethan called out, "Come in," as a young woman entered with a laptop.

"Grandma, this morning Auntie insisted Emma go to the kitchen. Once there, she left on some pretext, implicating her in this mess," Ethan explained, inserting the USB and playing a surveillance clip for everyone to see.

"Grandma, see here, on the 22nd at 9:08 PM, Auntie went into Charlotte Jones' room and didn't leave until 9:32 PM. I also asked the kitchen staff; they said Auntie's maid told them to deliver something at that time," Ethan continued.

Emma finally understood—it was a setup, orchestrated by Auntie and Charlotte Jones. Thankfully, Ethan had gathered the evidence, or she might never have cleared her name.

This family was more terrifying than she had imagined. They seemed so nice on the surface, yet they were capable of such cruelty, even using their children.

Ethan, sensing Emma's unease, gently patted her head. "With me around, we'll handle anything," he assured her with a smile.

Emma looked up at him, his smile somehow comforting. He really was reliable, always there to give her a sense of security when she needed it most.

"Auntie, is it true?" Uncle asked, visibly hurt by his sister's actions.

Auntie, flustered, tried to explain, "I just went to check on her. And I really did want dessert this morning."

Grandma, taking off her glasses, sighed deeply. "Enough, the evidence is clear. What do you have to say for yourself?"

Uncle, torn, couldn't bring himself to be harsh with his sister. "Auntie, how could you?"

The cousins chimed in, urging Grandma to forgive Auntie. "We're all family," they pleaded.

Emma thought for a moment. She wouldn't be staying here long and would soon return home. Might as well be the bigger person. "Grandma, maybe Auntie's learned her lesson. Perhaps you can forgive her this once," Emma suggested, comforting Grandma with a gentle pat on the shoulder.

Everyone was stunned. After everything Auntie had put her through, Emma still stood up for her.

Ethan watched Emma with admiration, silently vowing to protect her from any future troubles.
