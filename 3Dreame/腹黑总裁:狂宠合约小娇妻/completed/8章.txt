The rain was pattering softly against the window as Emma Thomas checked the time on her phone. It was already 9:30 AM, and she had plans to meet her friends for lunch and karaoke. She grabbed her backpack, ready to head out.

"Dad, I'm meeting up with some friends for lunch, so I won't be home to eat," she announced, heading for the door.

"I'll give you a ride," Ethan Clark said, gently grabbing her wrist. His eyes conveyed it wasn't just a suggestion.

Emma hesitated, then nodded. "Oh, okay."

"Dad, I have to swing by the branch office, so I won't be back for lunch either," Ethan added, guiding Emma out the door.

"You really don't have to drive me. I can manage on my own," Emma protested as Ethan opened the car door. But she lingered, eyeing him.

"What, am I that embarrassing to be seen with?" Ethan teased.

"I just don't want my friends to know I'm married before I graduate," Emma mumbled.

"It's on my way. I need to pick something up from the office," he replied, sliding into the driver's seat.

As the car rolled out of their neighborhood, Ethan handed Emma his phone. "Tell me where to go. Use my phone for navigation."

Emma took the phone, noticing it was locked. "Password?" she asked, raising an eyebrow.

Ethan quickly unlocked it with a series of numbers before handing it back to her. Emma punched in the address of the restaurant, and Ethan followed the directions, arriving at their destination after about twenty minutes.

Emma stepped out of the car just as two of her friends came running from a distance. "Hey, Emma! Over here!" they called out.

"Lingling, happy birthday! Here's a little something for you," Emma said, handing over a beautifully wrapped gift.

"Thanks, Emma!" Lingling beamed.

Sophia Wright, standing nearby, shot a curious glance at Ethan. "And who's this?" she asked.

Emma hesitated, fumbling for words just as Ethan was about to drive off.

"Hey, Lingling!" called a familiar voice. They turned to see two guys approachingâ€”one was Lingling's boyfriend, and the other was James Campbell. James, holding a bouquet, looked meaningfully at Emma, who was chatting with her friends. Sensing the situation, Ethan quickly got out of the car and walked over to Emma.

"Emma, introduce me to your friends," Ethan said, pulling Emma into a side embrace with a gentle yet possessive look.

"Ohhh," the friends chorused, their eyes twinkling with mischief.

"What's going on, Emma?" they teased. "Who's this?"

Emma blushed furiously. Ethan was definitely not sticking to the plan. She tried to pull away, but Ethan was both tall and strong, making it impossible.

"Isn't he your cousin?" James asked, looking puzzled.

"Cousin?" Sophia and the others chimed in, laughing. "Everything starts with 'brother and sister,' doesn't it?"

Ethan interrupted before Emma could respond. "Hi, I'm Ethan Clark," he introduced himself, keeping Emma close. "I'm her boyfriend."

"Boyfriend?" the friends exclaimed. "Emma, how could you keep this from us?"

James looked crestfallen, his eyes meeting Emma's. "Is that true?" he asked quietly, unable to believe it.

Emma nodded, not wanting to reveal that she was actually married. It was easier to say he was just her boyfriend.

The atmosphere grew awkward as James stood there with the flowers, clearly planning to confess his feelings. Lingling quickly tried to lighten the mood. "Let's go inside and eat. We can talk more there."

"Hey, handsome, join us for lunch," Sophia invited Ethan, her curiosity piqued.

"Yeah, come on in," the others chimed in.

Emma didn't want Ethan to stay, but before she could voice her thoughts, Ethan had already agreed. "Sure," he said decisively, glancing at Emma.

Emma smiled awkwardly as they all headed into the restaurant. Ethan noticed that James lingered back, looking defeated. "You shouldn't like her," Ethan said, his voice low and possessive.

James didn't reply, simply walking into the restaurant. Ethan smirked slightly and followed.

During lunch, Sophia couldn't help but probe into Emma and Ethan's relationship. "Emma, is your boyfriend from our school? I've never seen him around."

Emma, caught off guard while eating, nearly choked on her food.

"Careful," Ethan said, pouring her a glass of water and gently patting her back. "Take it slow."

Emma gulped down the water, grateful for the distraction from the spicy food.

"I'm not from here," Ethan explained, continuing to pat her back.

"Oh, so how did you two meet?" Sophia pressed on, eager to know more.

"It's a long story. Maybe another time," Emma deflected, hoping to change the topic.

Ethan glanced at her, then added, "We met on a blind date."

"Blind date? Emma..." Sophia began, but Emma quickly interrupted, "Let's raise our glasses and toast to Lingling's birthday."

Emma stood up, lifting her glass to the center of the table. "To Lingling's birthday!"

Everyone joined in, raising their glasses and offering birthday wishes. Emma felt a wave of relief; the topic had finally been dropped.

After lunch, they all headed to a karaoke bar. With no reservations, only a small room for five was available.

"You guys go ahead. We need to head back," Emma said, looking at Ethan. "My boyfriend has some things to do."

Hearing her refer to him as her boyfriend made Ethan smile. He found it endearing, even if it was meant to keep things under wraps.

After bidding farewell, Emma and Ethan got back into the car. As they drove off, Emma couldn't contain her curiosity. "Why did you say you're my boyfriend?"

Ethan, unfazed, buckled his seatbelt and started the engine. "What else was I supposed to say? That I'm your husband?" he countered.

"You could have continued with the cousin story," Emma suggested.

"Cousin? That'd only give him hope," Ethan pointed out. "What's the deal with you and James Campbell? Was he planning to confess today?"

"There's nothing between us," Emma insisted.

"Nothing? He practically had 'I like Emma Thomas' written all over his face," Ethan teased.

"Even if he did, it's not possible now," Emma sighed, turning to look out the window.

She had once had a crush on James, but was relieved she never confessed. It would have made this situation unbearably awkward. Now, being just friends was easier.

"I'm her boyfriend," Ethan's words echoed in Emma's mind. At least they hadn't exposed their marriage. Being just boyfriend and girlfriend was enough for now, especially in front of her classmates.
