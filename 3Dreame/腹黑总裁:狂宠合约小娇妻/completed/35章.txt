Oliver Thomas left the next morning at 8 a.m. 

"Mm~Mm~Mm," Emma Thomas heard her phone vibrating on the nightstand. Slowly waking up, she groped for the phone, squinting at the incoming call. She hesitated, unsure whether to answer. The phone rang persistently until she finally hung up, setting it down just as it began to ring again. With a sigh, she answered the call.

"Hello?"

"Hey, Emma Thomas," a male voice came through. 

"What do you want?" Emma whispered, as if she were afraid someone might overhear. 

"I'm heading to Greenfield City," he said, seemingly hoping for a plea to stay. Emma froze, taking a moment to process. "Okay," she finally replied.

"Maybe we'll meet again," he said, his voice tinged with hope.

"James Campbell, you deserve better," Emma said, before ending the call. She held onto the phone, feeling the weight of her words. She didn't want James to waste his time on her.

As she sat there lost in thought, the bathroom door opened and Ethan Clark emerged, toweling off his hair.

"Awake already?" Ethan said warmly, and Emma quickly composed herself, sitting up on the bed with her phone. 

"Yeah."

"James Campbell called you?" Ethan asked, this time without the harshness of before.

"I made things clear," Emma said, trying to sound convincing.

"Okay, get ready. We'll go grab breakfast before heading out," Ethan said as he left the bedroom. Emma stayed behind, worrying about Ethan's reaction to James, puzzled by his unexpected calmness. 

Ethan was already at the breakfast table when Emma joined him. As she sat down and reached for some toast, Ethan interrupted her, "Drink your coffee first."

"I want toast," Emma said, ignoring him and biting into the bread. Ethan took the toast from her hand, spread some jam on it, and handed it back.

Surprised, Emma looked at him. "Not everyone's into jam, you know," she said, trying to return the toast to his plate.

"Just try it," Ethan encouraged.

Emma took a tentative bite and smiled contentedly. "Is this blueberry jam?" she asked, taking another bite.

"Yep," Ethan nodded.

"Ma'am, this isn't just any blueberry jam," chimed in Grace Gonzalez, their housekeeper. "Mr. Clark had it specially brought from New Zealand."

"No wonder it tastes better than any I've had before," Emma said, happily finishing her toast.

After breakfast, they headed to Thomas Group. As they approached the entrance, a receptionist stopped them. "Do you have an appointment?" she asked.

"I'm Ethan Clark," he said coolly, not slowing his pace.

"You're... Ethan Clark?" The receptionist was stunned and hurriedly called someone as they walked toward the elevator.

"David Williams, Ethan Clark is here, waiting for the elevator," she said urgently into the phone.

Standing by the elevator, Emma took in the surroundings. She'd never been to her mother's company before; her father had always kept her away.

"What are you looking at?" Ethan asked, noticing her curiosity.

"Nothing," Emma replied softly, watching the numbers change above the elevator.

"Once we're in there, just follow my lead, don't worry," Ethan reassured her, taking her hand as the elevator doors opened.

They stepped inside and hit the button for the 6th floor. "Where are we going?" Emma asked, her curiosity piqued.

"To see Oliver Thomas, of course," Ethan said, pulling her into his embrace. Emma blushed, not sure where to look.

When the elevator doors opened, they exited together.

"Hey, Ethan Clark, you came all the way here. Why didn't you let me know? I would have come to greet you," David Williams hurried over, trying to be hospitable.

Ethan bypassed the pleasantries. "How's everything going? Where's Oliver Thomas?"

"Mr. Clark, everything's been arranged as you asked. Oliver Thomas is in his office. Let me take you there," David said, leading them to the executive office.

"Oliver Thomas, Ethan Clark is here," David announced politely after knocking.

Oliver, deep in thought, looked up, masking his irritation as he saw Ethan and Emma at the door.

"Come in," Oliver gestured. Seeing Emma, he added, "Emma, you're here too."

David discreetly closed the door, leaving the three of them alone.

"Father, Emma and I are here to take charge of Thomas Group," Ethan declared bluntly.

Emma watched her father nervously, having never seen him this intense. Sensing her unease, Ethan interlaced his fingers with hers.

"You're in such a hurry?" Oliver asked, bewildered. 

"Emma, haven't I always been good to you?" Oliver said, his frustration evident.

"Since Mom passed away, have you ever cared for me?" Emma retorted, sitting up straight, her anger palpable.

"If I didn't care, would you have grown up like this? Attended such good schools? Yes, you lived with your grandmother, but she insisted on taking you," Oliver defended himself.

Emma stood, a bitter smile on her face. "Caring for me means bringing that woman into our home soon after Mom's death, letting her treat me coldly? You never cared about me. I even wonder if you ever loved Mom."

Oliver's anger flared, and he raised his hand to strike Emma, but Ethan stepped in. "She's my wife. No one harms her," he said, pushing Oliver's hand away and pulling Emma close.

"Oliver Thomas, please leave Thomas Group immediately and donâ€™t come back," Ethan said coldly.

"Fine, have it your way," Oliver said, glaring at them both before storming out of the office.
