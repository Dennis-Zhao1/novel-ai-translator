Ethan Clark, You're Annoying Me

7:00 AM

Emma Thomas was nestled in her dreams when a man's voice started to seep into her consciousness.

"Just do as I said."

"What time is breakfast?"

"I'll head over soon."

Ethan Clark hung up the phone and stood by the window, lost in his thoughts, staring out at the world beyond.

"Ethan Clark, you're annoying me!" Emma murmured in a sleepy, childlike voice before flipping over and diving back into her slumber.

Ethan chuckled as he walked over to the bed, amused by Emma's lobster-like sleeping position. For someone who was the heiress of the Thomas Group, her sleeping posture was anything but graceful. He sat down gently on the edge of the bed, contemplating whether to adjust her position.

"You’re annoying me," she mumbled again, half-conscious.

"Oh, really?" Ethan leaned in close, his heartbeat inexplicably quickening as he gazed at her. Her lips were so inviting, and her cheeks were flushed from sleep. He swallowed hard.

Emma stirred, sensing a presence. "Is someone breathing nearby?" she thought hazily. Opening her eyes, she was startled to find Ethan's face right in front of hers. She yanked the covers over her head in shock.

"What are you doing here? Go away," she said, trying to push him away with her right hand.

"You still want my help with that contract, right?" Ethan asked, his tone firm.

Emma peeked out from under the covers, her curiosity piqued. "What do you want?"

"Just be good, and we'll get it done soon," Ethan said softly, leaning in closer.

"Uh... okay..." Emma muttered.

Ethan gently held Emma's head and kissed her, his lips meeting hers. She tried to pull away, but his grip was firm.

"Let go of me," she pleaded, tears escaping her eyes. Her first kiss was stolen, and not in the way she ever imagined.

Ethan tasted the salt of her tears and paused, looking at Emma with a mix of surprise and tenderness. He hadn't expected her to cry, and now he was at a loss, though he quickly put on a tough facade.

"You’re my wife. These things are inevitable," he said as he straightened his clothes and headed for the door.

Emma lay there, her head buried under the covers, her heart aching. "Jerk," she muttered as she threw off the covers and headed to the bathroom.

The sound of running water filled the space as Emma brushed her teeth furiously, tears streaming down her face.

Meanwhile, Ethan made his way downstairs, wiping his lips, still replaying the morning's events in his mind.

"Up early, Ethan?" Oliver Thomas, Emma's dad, was sipping tea in the living room.

"Morning, Dad," Ethan replied, snapping out of his thoughts and joining him on the sofa.

"Breakfast will be ready soon. Why don't you sit for a bit?" Oliver offered.

"I'll have to skip breakfast today. I need to borrow your car for some errands," Ethan said.

"Sure, take it."

"Thanks, Dad," Ethan said, politely excusing himself as he headed to the garage.

As he got into the car, Ethan couldn't help but recall Emma's sleepy voice: "Ethan Clark, you're annoying me." A smile crept across his face, bringing a warmth he hadn't felt in a while. Her adorableness was something he found himself increasingly drawn to.

Back in Emma's room, her phone buzzed with a vibration, but she was in the bathroom, oblivious to the sound.

"Is she mad?" Ethan wondered, dialing her number once more.

Emma emerged from the bathroom just as her phone buzzed again. She picked it up, surprised to see an unfamiliar number. It had been a while since she'd received a call from someone she didn't know.

"Hello?" she answered hesitantly, her voice still a bit raspy.

"It's me," Ethan's voice came through, cool and composed.

Emma blinked in surprise. "How do you have my number?" she asked.

"I'm handling the contract," Ethan replied before hanging up, revving the engine, and speeding off to his destination.

"What? Did I hear that right? If he finishes the contract today, can I finally get a divorce?" Emma's eyes widened with disbelief, a glimmer of hope lighting up her face. She longed for freedom, and the thought of it being so close was exhilarating.

After a twenty-minute drive, Ethan arrived at his destination: the prestigious Royal Hotel.

Earlier, Ethan had received a call from his secretary, informing him that David Williams, the investment director, would be having breakfast at the hotel at 8 AM. This was a golden opportunity for the Clark Group's expansion, and Ethan was determined to seize it.

"David Williams, nice to meet you. I'm Ethan Clark," he introduced himself at the hotel lobby, handing over his business card.

"You're Ethan Clark from the Clark Group?" David paused, putting down his pastry and taking Ethan's card.

"That's me."

"Are you here for breakfast too?" David asked, a hint of curiosity in his voice.

"My wife insisted on having the Royal Hotel's pastries in the middle of the night, so here I am, early and ready to buy them," Ethan chuckled.

"Your wife has excellent taste. These pastries are renowned in Wood City, and people line up every morning to get them," David noted, savoring another bite.

"There's more to it than that. Shall we sit and talk?" David invited Ethan to join him.

Ethan didn't beat around the bush. "David, I have something I'd like to discuss," he said, pulling a document from his briefcase and handing it over.

"What's this?" David asked, intrigued.

"The latest quarterly financial report from the Thomas Group. Take a look."

The two men discussed business at length, and Ethan eventually left the hotel with a signed document in hand. As he walked out, he pulled out his phone to call Emma.

"Mm~mm~mm~" Emma's phone buzzed again, pulling her from her nap.

"Hello?" she answered groggily, her voice soft and sweet.

Ethan was taken aback. "You're still in bed?" he asked.

"Yeah..." she replied weakly.

"Did you finish what you needed to do?" she asked, snapping back to the matter at hand.

"Not yet," Ethan admitted.

"Oh, okay," she said, disappointment lacing her voice.

"The business world isn't as simple as you think," Ethan added before hanging up and heading back to the car.

Emma pondered his words. He was right. If it were that easy, her dad wouldn't have worked so hard all these years. She nodded slightly in understanding.

"Mm," she murmured in agreement.

Ethan put his phone away and was about to start the car when he noticed a guy at the hotel entrance, holding pastries in one hand and chatting on the phone, promising his girlfriend he'd bring them home.

"I woke her up this morning. I wonder if she'd like these," Ethan thought, torn between wanting to surprise Emma and fearing she might not appreciate the gesture.

Ultimately, he decided to go back inside and queue up for the pastries.

With the pastries in hand, Ethan returned home, climbing the stairs to their bedroom. He found Emma absorbed in her painting, her back to him. He approached quietly and held out the bag of pastries.

"Jeez, you scared me!" Emma jumped, startled by his presence.

Ethan stayed silent, gesturing to the bag in his hand.

Emma caught on and took the bag, peeking inside. "Butterfly pastries?" she exclaimed with delight.

"Yeah."

Emma took a bite, savoring it. "These are from the Royal Hotel. They're super hard to get!"

"You can tell?"

"They're the best, with just the right amount of sweetness," Emma said, a smile spreading across her face.

Seeing her so pleased, Ethan felt a sense of relief. Maybe she wouldn't hold a grudge after all.
