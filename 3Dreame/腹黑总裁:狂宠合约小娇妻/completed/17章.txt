Chapter 1: Emma's Resolve

Emma Thomas strolled out of the kitchen, leaving behind the swirling aroma of fried goodies and her grandma’s bustling energy. "Ethan Clark, where are you?" she muttered while scanning the living room.

Her grandma, a force of nature and the culinary queen of the household, waved her off with a gentle command. "Go get some fresh air, Emma. This kitchen’s no place for a young lady to linger too long."

Emma slipped into the hallway, her eyes darting around until they landed on her bedroom door. There he was, Ethan Clark, caught in the act of examining an old photograph.

“What are you doing in my room?” Emma asked, inching closer. Ethan held up the picture, a fragment of her past that she’d rather forget. “This person you scratched out—is that Oliver Thomas?”

Emma’s eyes flicked to the photo, memories tugging at her heart. “That’s none of your business,” she retorted, snatching it back and tucking it securely into her photo album.

“Because he left your mom, remarried, and you’re aiming to reclaim Thomas Group, am I right?” Ethan’s eyes were earnest, filled with a sympathy that Emma found both comforting and annoying.

“Stop guessing about my life,” Emma mumbled, locking the drawer and dropping the key into a piggy bank on her desk for safekeeping.

Ethan leaned back in the chair, unfazed. “I’m helping you get those shares, Emma. I think I deserve to know the story.”

Emma settled on her bed, eyes drifting to the window. Her mind replayed the day her father walked out, and she started recounting it to Ethan.

She remembered the cold words her father uttered to her mom, “Lynn, let’s divorce.” Her mother’s shock was palpable. “No, Alex, we’re fine. I’m not divorcing you.”

“We argue every day, Lynn. I can’t live like this anymore,” he complained. 

“Is there someone else? Your secretary?” her mother’s voice crescendoed in desperation.

“Lynn, it’s not about her,” he said heartlessly, leaving her mother to weep alone. Emma, just a little girl then, had woken from her nap to her mother’s tears, joining in without understanding why.

Her mom, resolute, had packed their bags and taken her to Grandma’s, leaving Emma behind as she walked away, never looking back.

"And your mom?" Ethan prodded gently.

Emma’s voice hitched, "She was upset, crossed the street without looking, and got hit by a truck. She didn’t make it."

“Thomas Group was her life’s work with him. How dare he think he can just take it all?” Emma’s eyes blazed with determination.

Ethan reached out, his voice steady, “I’ll help you, Emma.”

Emma met his gaze, a glimmer of hope sparking between them. “The acquisition’s underway. I’ll hand it to you as a graduation gift,” Ethan said, standing up as Grandma’s call for dinner echoed through the house.

As they headed to the dining room, Emma’s eyes lit up at the sight of her favorite foods. “Grandma, you made my favorite stir-fry!”

“And your beloved sweet and sour pork!” Grandma laughed, her face glowing with pride.

“Plus, your ultimate favorite—braised fish,” Grandma added, her eyes twinkling.

Emma dug in, her taste buds singing praises. “This is perfect, Grandma!”

Her grandmother chuckled, adding more fish to Emma’s plate. “You never tire of this, do you?”

Ethan, politely taking some fish, was coaxed by Grandma’s welcoming smile, “Eat up, Ethan. No need to be shy here.”

“This is delicious,” Ethan agreed, savoring the flavors.

“Emma’s always missed this when she’s away,” Grandma boasted, basking in the praise.

After dinner, as they prepared to leave for the courthouse, Grandma handed Emma a red envelope. “Visit your aunt after, alright?”

Emma tried to refuse it, but Grandma insisted with a loving push, “Take it, you’re still in school.”

Emma glanced at Ethan, then looped her arm through his. “Grandma, Ethan’s got money. What’s his is mine, right?”

Ethan grinned, wrapping an arm around Emma, “Exactly, Grandma, keep it.”

Grandma relented, waving them off with a smile, “Be back for dinner, okay?”

“Got it!” Emma called back, stepping out with Ethan.

Once they were outside, Emma let go of Ethan’s arm, “Thanks for playing along.”

Ethan just opened the car door for her, and they set off toward the city.

“Give me directions,” Ethan requested as they drove.

Emma smirked, pointing out the window. “Three lights up, left, then straight and another right.”

“You know your way around,” Ethan noted.

“Grew up here,” Emma replied, her voice tinged with nostalgia.

Sensing her mood, Ethan shifted topics. “You really like fish?”

“Yeah, reminds me of my grandpa taking me fishing. Grandma’s cooking always tastes like home,” Emma said, checking the time on her phone.

“I’d like to stay for dinner tonight,” she hinted, glancing at Ethan.

Ethan chuckled, “Of course, we’ll stay over. Head back in the morning.”

As they drove, Ethan pondered the best places to eat fish, realizing he had never paid much attention to it before.
