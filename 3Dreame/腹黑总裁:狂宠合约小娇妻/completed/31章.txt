Title: The Negotiation

Ethan Clark was silent for a moment, then he asked, "What are your plans after graduation?"

"I'm planning to join Thomas Group," Emma Thomas replied, watching him closely.

He paused briefly, then looked at her with a commanding gaze. "You're not allowed to."

Emma blinked in surprise, clearly puzzled. "Isn't it my choice where I work?"

He was silent for another moment before explaining coldly, "The acquisition is underway. If you join now, Thomas Group might be tipped off."

"You've already started?" Emma looked at him, astonished.

"Yes."

Hearing his firm response, Emma felt a surge of joy. "So, I'm about to become the successor to Thomas Group?"

He glanced at her, face lighting up with happiness. "Just like the contract promised."

"Alright, I won’t join Thomas Group for now. I'll wait until you've sorted things out. Plus, I need to gain some experience, so I’ll work somewhere else first," Emma said, enthusiastically planning her future.

"No working at all," Ethan said coldly, shattering the cheerful atmosphere in the car.

Emma looked at him in confusion. "I’m not joining Thomas Group. I’ll just interview elsewhere."

"No," he replied, just as coldly.

Emma's expression changed, her eyes fixed on him. "Why not?"

"I can take care of you," Ethan said with a touch of indulgence.

Emma was taken aback, her cheeks flushing. It was the first time she’d heard something like that. "I can work," she murmured.

"Isn't staying home better?" Ethan asked, stopping the car, a hint of frustration in his eyes.

"I've got hands and feet. Why shouldn't I work?" Emma said, locking eyes with him.

"I disagree," Ethan said, stomping on the gas pedal and driving off.

"I'm an adult. I have my own thoughts," Emma muttered.

After a ride that felt like an eternity, they finally arrived home. Just as they walked through the door, Grace Gonzalez greeted them.

"Welcome home, Mr. and Mrs. Clark."

Ethan handed his coat to Grace, loosening his tie as he walked. "Grace, from today, make sure Mrs. Clark doesn’t leave the house."

Grace glanced at Emma, unsure of how to respond.

Emma's temper flared. She quickly caught up to Ethan. "You can't do this. It's illegal confinement."

"Then go ahead and sue me," Ethan said, stopping briefly before heading down to the basement.

"Ethan Clark, you jerk!" Emma shouted, fuming, as she stood her ground.

"Ma'am, please calm down. Mr. Clark must be thinking of your best interests," Grace tried to soothe her.

Emma said nothing, storming off to the second floor.

In the basement, Ethan sat in the lounge with a glass of wine, pondering his decision. He didn’t want her embroiled in the cutthroat business world. She was too pure and kind for that battlefield.

He sat there for a long time until Grace came down.

"Sir, dinner is ready."

"Where's Emma?" Ethan asked, concerned.

"She went upstairs and hasn't come down."

Ethan said nothing, setting down his glass and heading upstairs.

He found the bedroom door slightly ajar and peaked in. Emma was quietly painting by the window. He couldn’t see what she was creating from afar, so he entered quietly.

The painting depicted a bird in a cage—he understood the metaphor immediately. Without saying much, he called out, "Dinner’s ready."

Emma pretended not to hear, continuing to paint and ignoring him.

Seeing her reluctance, he bent down and scooped her up. Her paintbrush accidentally stained his white shirt collar.

"Put me down," Emma protested.

He glanced at the paint stain, then carried her towards the door.

"Ethan Clark, let me go!" Emma struggled, but his grip was strong.

"Don't move," Ethan said, holding her tighter. Hearing his steady breathing, she suddenly felt shy.

He set her down at the dining table and handed her a fork, pulling out a chair for himself.

"Sir, should I wash your shirt?" Grace asked, noticing the stain.

"No need," Ethan replied.

"Why won't you let me work?" Emma finally spoke after some silence.

"You're too young for the business world," Ethan said, placing a piece of sweet and sour pork in her bowl, gazing at her tenderly.

"I'm an adult. I need to grow up and work someday," Emma replied, taking a bite.

Ethan added a piece of fish to her bowl. "You never have to work a day in your life," he said, starting on his meal.

Emma choked on her food, coughing.

"Take it slow," Ethan said, patting her back and offering her a glass of water.

"We're in a contract marriage. Once the terms are met, we can divorce," Emma whispered, not wanting anyone else to hear.

"I have veto power," Ethan stated, eating his celery.

Emma looked at him in disbelief, wondering if he was serious—was there more to his feelings, or was it just business?

Seeing her pause, Ethan nudged her. "Eat up," he said, placing another piece of fish in her bowl.

After dinner, Emma was just about to return to her painting when she noticed Ethan's car driving away. Seizing the opportunity, she dashed downstairs.

"Grace, where did Ethan go?" she inquired.

Grace paused her cleaning. "He got a call and left."

Emma's heart leaped with excitement, and she hurried upstairs.

Grabbing her laptop, she headed to the study. After spending some time crafting a resume, she paused when she saw the time: 7 PM.

"Too late to send applications now," she mused. "I'll just bookmark some job listings for tomorrow."

And so, she browsed job sites, saving positions that caught her interest.

Before she knew it, it was past 9 PM. "Time flies," she thought, surprised.

"Should be back soon. I’ll continue this tomorrow," she decided, closing her laptop and tucking it into her bag before leaving the study.
