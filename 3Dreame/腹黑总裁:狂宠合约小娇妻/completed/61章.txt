It was one of those sweltering summer afternoons, the kind where the only thing keeping you going is the promise of something sweet. Sophia Wright and Emma Thomas had found refuge in a cozy dessert shop, trying to cool down with some ice cream sundaes.

Emma’s phone buzzed, interrupting the serene moment. She fished it out of her bag and saw Ethan Clark’s name on the screen.

“Hey, where are you?” Ethan’s voice came through, gentle and kind.

“We’re at the amusement park near your office. It’s like a ten-minute drive from you,” Emma replied, looking around for anything that might help describe her location further. She was about to ask Sophia when Ethan interrupted.

“Stay put. I’ll come get you,” he said, already on the move to leave his office.

Emma was puzzled. How did he know exactly where she was? She couldn’t help but ask, “You sure know where I am, huh?”

Ethan chuckled, “Well, there’s only one amusement park within a ten-minute drive from my office. Just hang tight.”

“Alright, we’re in the dessert shop at the entrance,” Emma said softly before hanging up.

Sophia, who had been observing the conversation, teased Emma, “Ethan’s coming to get you, huh?”

“Yeah,” Emma nodded, digging into her dessert. The heat was unbearable, and even a brief stint outside had left them both exhausted.

Sophia grinned, “See, this proves what I said. Ethan’s really into you. I mean, who else would brave this heat to come pick you up?”

Emma pondered this, sitting back in her chair. The idea of Ethan leaving his air-conditioned office to fetch her was indeed touching. She wondered where he planned to take her in this heat, especially since it wasn’t even time for dinner yet.

Her thoughts were interrupted by Sophia’s excited greeting, “Ethan, you’re here!”

Emma turned to see Ethan standing there, his forehead glistening with sweat. She quickly pulled a napkin from her bag and handed it to him, “Here, wipe off the sweat.”

Ethan accepted the napkin, a big smile spreading across his face. Emma’s gesture, small as it was, meant a lot to him. It was a sign that she was gradually warming up to him.

Sophia, sensing the moment, grabbed her purse and said, “I’ll leave you two to it. Have fun!” She gave Emma a quick shoulder pat and left the shop.

Now alone, Emma and Ethan sat in the dessert shop, an awkward silence settling between them. Ethan, who wasn’t used to such casual settings, and Emma, who found herself at a loss for words, both felt a bit out of place.

“I want to take you somewhere,” Ethan finally broke the silence, his eyes full of anticipation.

“Where to?” Emma asked, curiosity piqued. Was this going to be their first date?

“You’ll see. Let’s go,” Ethan said, reaching for her hand. But just as they were about to leave, Emma stopped him, “So, is this our first date?”

She wasn’t sure why she asked. Maybe she was ready to open her heart a little.

Ethan’s eyes widened in surprise, “Are you saying you’re accepting my confession?”

He held her arms gently, looking down at her with hopeful eyes. Emma, feeling a bit shy under his gaze, whispered, “We can give it a try.”

Ethan, overjoyed, pulled her into a hug, holding her tight like a kid with a new toy. “Let’s go,” he said, beaming, and led her out of the shop.

“Take it easy,” Ethan said, gently helping Emma into the car. He got into the driver’s seat and drove them away from the amusement park.

After a short drive, Ethan parked the car outside a charming little Italian restaurant. The place exuded romance with its candlelit tables and soft music playing in the background.

“Right this way, sir, ma’am,” the waiter greeted them warmly as they entered.

Ethan guided Emma to a table by the window, pulling out a chair for her before sitting down across from her. The view outside was a mix of city lights and towering skyscrapers.

“What would you like to eat?” Ethan asked, glancing at the menu before looking up at Emma.

Emma, feeling bashful, smiled softly, “I’m good with anything.” She clasped her hands in her lap, trying to calm her nerves. Why was she so nervous? It was just dinner, something they’d done countless times before.

“It’s okay, just relax,” Emma told herself, taking a deep breath.

“I’ll order some of your favorites,” Ethan decided, noticing her slight unease. After placing their orders, he looked at her warmly, “Emma, I’m not sure what kind of dates you like. Andrew told me it’s usually dinner, movies, maybe a trip somewhere. What do you think?”

Emma was taken aback. Ethan, usually so confident and composed, seemed a bit uncertain. Was this really his first date?

She quickly masked her surprise with a smile, “I like all of those ideas.”

As the evening unfolded, their dishes arrived one by one. Ethan, attentive as ever, moved Emma’s plate closer and cut her steak into bite-sized pieces.

Emma was touched. It was the little things he did that made her feel cherished and warm inside.

“Try the steak here, see if you like it,” Ethan suggested, placing the plate in front of her. Emma shifted her gaze from him to the perfectly cooked steak, taking a bite.

“It’s delicious,” she said, meeting Ethan’s eyes with a smile.

“I’m glad you like it,” Ethan replied, his own smile mirroring hers.

They enjoyed their meal, chatting and laughing, until a voice interrupted them from across the room. “Ethan, fancy seeing you here!”

Emma turned to see a woman in a stylish dress and high heels approaching. Her heart skipped as she recognized the woman from a previous encounter at a bar.

The woman sauntered over to their table, eyeing the dishes with a playful smirk, “Ethan, you sure know how to order. These are all the best dishes here.”

Before Ethan could respond, a man who had followed the woman over chimed in, “And this must be your lady, Ethan?”
