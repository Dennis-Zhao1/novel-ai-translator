The next morning, the first rays of sunlight streamed through the window, gently waking Emma Thomas. She turned over and, not seeing anyone beside her, slowly got up and headed to the walk-in closet to change.

Once dressed, Emma made her way to the bathroom to wash up, only to be interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing. She picked it up to find a text from Ethan Clark: "I've arranged for William Jones to drive you to school. He should be there soon." With a slight sigh, she put the phone down.

After getting herself ready, Emma descended the stairs at a leisurely pace.

“Good morning, ma’am. Mr. Clark left early and asked me to prepare breakfast for you,” Grace Gonzalez announced as she headed to the kitchen to fetch the meal.

Emma had just settled at the dining table when William Jones strolled in from outside. "Morning, Emma," he greeted with a friendly smile.

Emma felt a bit shy but responded, "I can get to school on my own, you know."

William chuckled, twirling his car keys. "With looks like yours, Ethan would never forgive me if anything happened while he’s not around."

Blushing, Emma focused on her breakfast, then suddenly remembered her manners. "Oh, have you eaten?"

"I had breakfast already. Take your time; I’ll just wait over there." William gestured to the sofa and sat down.

Emma finished her meal, glanced at her phone, and realized she was close to being late. She grabbed her backpack and jogged toward the living room. "Come on, we need to hurry," she called to William, who quickly followed her to the car.

"Don’t worry, Emma, I drive fast," William reassured her as they set off.

Emma recalled his impressive driving skills, but the morning traffic was notoriously bad. Just the other day, Ethan had been stuck for ages while dropping her off.

“Where are you taking us?” Emma asked as William navigated down an unfamiliar path.

“It’s a shortcut. This way, and then a right, and we’re there,” he explained.

Emma thought about it and realized he was right. "Well, then I guess we have plenty of time."

She smiled at William, who continued to drive. "Did you and Ethan grow up together?" she asked curiously.

"Yeah, we’ve been friends since third grade."

“Was he always so cunning?” Emma asked, half-joking.

William paused, choosing his words carefully. "Let’s just say none of us wanted to get on his bad side."

“Figures,” Emma muttered to herself.

"Do you know who Lisa Parker is?" she finally asked.

"Lisa? Oh, she was one of the kids we used to hang out with when we were younger," William replied fondly. "She always followed Ethan around."

"You mean childhood sweethearts?" Emma asked tentatively.

William glanced at her. "Before you two got married, I thought Ethan and Lisa were an item. But seeing how he treats you, I figure he only ever saw her as a friend."

Emma sat quietly, lost in thought. "Our marriage is beneficial for both of us. Without that, we wouldn’t be together."

"But hey, it’s a win-win situation," she mused aloud.

“Sis, we’re here,” William announced, pulling up at the school gate.

Emma looked around, surprised at how quickly they’d arrived. “Thanks,” she said, grabbing her backpack and getting out of the car.

William called out after her, "I’ll pick you up later," before driving off.

Emma watched him leave, then turned and walked toward the school entrance.

“Emma, over here!” A familiar voice called out as she entered the classroom.

She joined her friend Sophia Wright, who was already seated. “Emma, is it true, what I heard on the phone?”

Noticing others whispering about her, Emma nodded and explained quietly to Sophia.

“So, you’re not seeing James Campbell anymore?” Sophia inquired, ever the gossip.

“I might have liked him once, but I can’t now,” Emma replied, opening her textbook.

“How long have you known Ethan Clark?” Sophia persisted, pulling on Emma’s arm.

“Not long.”

“You married him right after meeting? Were your parents pushing you?” Sophia asked incredulously.

“Sophia, it was my decision,” Emma said, gently freeing her arm. "But hey, shouldn’t you be happy for me?"

Sophia pouted, “I haven’t even given you a wedding gift yet; you moved so fast!”

Emma found her friend’s expression amusing, teasing, “Well, you can give it to me now.”

“In your dreams, I’m broke,” Sophia retorted playfully, making Emma laugh.

Just then, Emma’s phone dinged with a new message. She checked it: "Are you at school?" It was from Ethan.

"Yeah, I’m here," she replied curtly.

"I won’t be back today, but I’ll be home early the day after tomorrow," he texted back.

Emma thought for a moment before typing, "No rush, enjoy your time with your childhood sweetheart." She set her phone to silent, tucked it away, and resumed her studies.

Meanwhile, Ethan stared at his phone in confusion. "Childhood sweetheart?"

"Is she talking about me and Lisa?" he wondered, just as a knock sounded at his office door.

“Come in.”

In walked a tall, sharply dressed girl with an air of confidence. "Ethan, are you busy?"

“Lisa! Come on in, have a seat,” Ethan said, getting up to make some coffee.

“How’s your side going? Did the board approve the funding?” he asked, handing her a mug and taking a seat himself.

“The project’s passed the internal review. We’re just waiting for the evaluation results, which should be ready the day after tomorrow,” Lisa replied, sipping her coffee.

“Thanks,” Ethan said with a relieved smile.

“I was out of town for your wedding, but here’s a little gift,” Lisa said, handing him an elegantly wrapped box.

Ethan hesitated for a moment, then accepted it. “I’ll take it. Drinks on me next time.”

Lisa chuckled, “Aren’t you going to open it?”

Ethan glanced at the box, “I’ve got a pretty good guess.”

“Oh yeah?”

“A watch,” he said, carefully opening the box to reveal he was right.

“Boring,” Lisa teased, setting her coffee down and preparing to leave.

“Thanks,” Ethan said, gesturing with the box.

“When you bring your lovely wife over, we’ll go out for dinner,” Lisa suggested, grabbing her bag and heading out.

After she left, Ethan put the watch in his desk drawer and returned to work.
