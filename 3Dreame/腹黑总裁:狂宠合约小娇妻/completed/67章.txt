As the office buzzed with post-meeting activity, Lily Lewis stepped out of the conference room with the boss and Ethan Clark, the two of them chatting as they headed towards the exit. Emma Thomas, meanwhile, kept her eyes on the documents spread across her desk, trying to remain inconspicuous.

It wasn't long before Ethan returned, quietly approaching Emma's desk. "Can you come with me?" he asked softly, his eyes meeting hers.

Emma's heart skipped a beat. She nodded, feeling a mix of curiosity and nervousness, and followed him into his office. "Close the door," Ethan instructed once they were inside.

"What's up?" Emma asked, curiosity getting the better of her.

"Take a seat," Ethan gestured towards the sofa.

Emma hesitated. "Isn't it a bit... visible? I mean, the office is practically see-through."

"Don't worry," Ethan reassured her, "Lily's gone out with the boss for lunch. No one's watching."

Emma sighed and took a seat, trying to relax. Ethan took a sip of his tea and smiled, "You make great tea."

Emma chuckled, feeling a bit more at ease. "So, why did you call me in here? We shouldn't give our colleagues the wrong impression."

Ethan leaned forward, his expression turning serious. "What do you want for lunch?"

The question caught Emma off guard. "Lunch? I haven't really thought about it."

"There's a nice restaurant nearby. I'd like to take you there," Ethan offered, his gaze warm and inviting.

But Emma was hesitant. "It's too close to the office. What if someone sees us?"

"Trust me, our coworkers rarely go there," Ethan assured her, trying to ease her concerns.

Emma mulled it over. The thought of being spotted by her colleagues was too daunting. "Maybe I'll just order in," she suggested, glancing up at him.

Ethan nodded, respecting her decision. "Alright, what would you like to order?"

Emma smiled, grateful for his understanding. "Let's order separately then," she suggested.

"Okay," Ethan agreed, handing her his phone to browse options.

Emma stood up. "I'll head back to my desk and figure it out."

Ethan watched her go, a soft smile on his face. "Sure."

Back at her desk, Emma scrolled through the delivery options, still unsure about what to eat. Just then, a message popped up on her phone.

"What are you having for lunch?" Sophia Wright had texted.

"Not sure yet," Emma replied.

"I usually order in, but today, let's go out," Sophia suggested.

"Sounds good," Emma texted back, feeling a bit more at ease.

The two of them headed downstairs to a cozy little spot Sophia recommended. "This place has great sandwiches. Want to try it?" Sophia asked.

"Sure," Emma agreed, following her friend inside.

As they ate, Sophia leaned in with a knowing look. "So, are you ever going to tell anyone about you and Ethan?"

Emma pondered for a moment, choosing her words carefully. "It's just easier to keep it to ourselves for now," she admitted.

Sophia nodded. "Your secret's safe with me," she promised, taking a bite of her sandwich.

After their meal, the two friends took a leisurely stroll before heading back to the office. By the time they returned, most of their colleagues were still out, leaving the office peacefully quiet.

Emma settled back at her desk, her eyelids growing heavy. She drifted off to sleep, her head resting on her folded arms.

Ethan, stepping out of his office, noticed Emma sleeping uncomfortably at her desk. He gently lifted her and carried her back to his office, laying her on the sofa. He draped a blanket over her, watching her sleep with a soft smile.

As he sat beside her, sipping the tea she'd made, Ethan felt a sense of contentment. This quiet moment, with her by his side, was everything he had hoped for.

Emma stirred, slowly waking to the unfamiliar comfort of the sofa. Confused, she blinked and looked around, realizing she was in Ethan's office.

"How did I end up here?" she asked, more to herself than to anyone else.

Ethan looked up from his work, a gentle smile on his face. "You fell asleep at your desk. I thought you'd be more comfortable here."

Emma remembered the sensation of being carried and couldn't help but feel touched. "Did you eat yet?" she asked, concerned.

"Not yet," Ethan admitted.

"You should grab something. It's bad for your stomach to wait too long."

He chuckled, clearly pleased. "Are you worried about me?"

Emma blushed, a bit flustered. "Let's just say I am."

Ethan picked up his phone to order food. "I'll get some delivery."

"Alright, I'll leave you to it then," Emma said, preparing to go.

"Wait a second," Ethan called out.

"Hmm?" Emma turned back, curious.

"It's quiet out there right now. Why don't you rest here a bit longer?" he suggested, his voice gentle.

Emma hesitated but eventually nodded. "Okay, I'll stay."

They agreed she would leave at half-past one, just before their colleagues returned. Emma settled back onto the sofa, feeling grateful for the extra rest.

As she closed her eyes, she felt a wave of contentment wash over her. These quiet moments, shared in solitude, were more precious than any grand gesture.
