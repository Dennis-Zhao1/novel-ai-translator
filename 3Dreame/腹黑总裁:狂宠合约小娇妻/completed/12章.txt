Emma Thomas was having one of those days. She'd just changed into a new outfit, standing in front of her closet pondering which shoes to wear. Her husband, Ethan Clark, handed her a pair of white high-top sneakers. 

"I want to wear heels," she said, brushing past him and grabbing a pair of modest white heels from the closet.

Ethan shook his head, taking the heels from her hands. "Heels aren't really your thing."

Emma rolled her eyes. "Do you have to control everything I do?"

"Well, you are my wife," Ethan replied, stepping closer with a teasing grin.

Sensing the shift in the air, Emma relented, slipping on the sneakers he’d picked out. "Fine, let's go," she said, heading toward the bedroom door.

Downstairs, they were greeted by their friends, William Jones and Henry Baker. "That outfit looks great on you, Emma," William remarked, eyeing her up and down. "You look like a fresh college grad," Henry added with a chuckle.

Emma glanced back at Ethan, feeling a bit on the spot. "My husband picked it out," she admitted, a shy smile spreading across her face as she clung to Ethan's arm.

Ethan was pleased by her response; the word "husband" had never sounded so sweet. He pulled her close, and they exchanged a knowing look. "She is a recent grad," he teased.

Henry groaned, "Okay, okay, enough with the lovey-dovey stuff, let's get moving."

Ethan led Emma to the car, helping her inside before sliding in next to her. As they drove, Emma leaned forward. "How far is this place again?" she asked.

"About 50 minutes to Clear Spring Bar," William replied from the driver’s seat.

Henry, ever the curious one, prodded, "So, Emma, how did you meet Mr. Cool and Mysterious over here?"

Emma rolled her eyes again, glancing at Ethan. "We met on a blind date."

"A blind date?" both William and Henry echoed in disbelief.

Henry pressed on, "But Ethan's like every girl's dream guy. Why would he need a blind date?"

"Maybe he just wanted to try something different," Emma laughed, casting a sidelong glance at Ethan.

As the car ride continued, Ethan found himself lost in thought, staring out the window. He’d never expected to feel this way; originally, their marriage was just a business move. But now, he found himself wanting more, getting jealous for no reason. Maybe he was really falling for her?

"Hey, Ethan, aren't you going to say something?" Henry called from the front.

"Did you finish your mid-year report?" Ethan shot back, pulling out his phone to scroll through social media.

Henry gulped and turned back around, silenced.

Emma eventually drifted off to sleep, her head gently resting against Ethan's shoulder. He looked at her, a soft smile on his face. "Fell asleep already?" he mused.

In her sleep, Emma murmured, "Mom, don't go," clutching Ethan's arm tightly.

Curious, Ethan leaned in to listen. "Dreaming about her mom," he thought, a pang of sympathy hitting him as he recalled the loneliness he sensed in her artwork back at home.

The car pulled up to a vibrant skyscraper, the neon lights of Clear Spring Bar illuminating the night. "We're here," William announced, unbuckling his seatbelt.

Ethan gently shook Emma awake, guiding her out of the car. Together, they entered the lively bar, a mix of awe and disbelief on Emma's face. "Wow, this place is amazing," she exclaimed.

Henry explained, "It's a high-end bar, not your average spot."

Emma noticed the fashionable crowd. "Everyone here looks so stylish."

They all settled into a plush booth, Henry ordering drinks. "Four whiskeys, please."

"Make that three whiskeys and an orange juice," Ethan interjected with a smile.

"Three? But there are four of us," Henry questioned.

"Emma's too young for whiskey," Ethan teased.

Emma shot Ethan a look. "I'm not that young, you know. Almost graduated, remember?"

Ethan leaned in, whispering, "Stay sharp. You'll want to see this."

William excused himself to scout the bar, returning with news. "I found them, over in the corner."

Emma followed their gaze, spotting two middle-aged men with young women draped over them. One of the men was her father. Calmly, she snapped a picture with her phone. "Let’s see how they explain this."

Ethan softly instructed, "Stay here, I'll handle it," before heading off with the guys.

"Handle it?" Emma thought, feeling a strange mix of relief and irritation. Despite their complicated relationship, she felt a sense of comfort when Ethan took charge. Maybe, just maybe, this marriage was more than just a business deal. But deep down, she knew better than to hope too much.
