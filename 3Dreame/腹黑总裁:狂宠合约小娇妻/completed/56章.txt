Emma Thomas and Ethan Clark walked back into the house, grabbing their bags as they prepared to leave. The car ride was mostly silent, with Ethan stealing glances at Emma, who had her eyes shut, trying to catch some rest. He felt a pang of guilt seeing her like that.

After a while, Emma slowly opened her eyes, gazing at the buildings passing by. Something about the route seemed familiar, yet not quite the way home. Intrigued, she turned to Ethan and asked, "Where are we going?"

Ethan glanced at her, noticing her tiredness, and replied gently, "To the wellness center."

Emma felt a twinge of guilt for doubting him earlier. She had planned to sneak off to the wellness center herself later that afternoon. Surprised by his thoughtfulness, she settled back into her seat.

"Just a bit longer. Rest while you can," Ethan said, brushing her hair softly and pulling her into a comforting embrace. This time, Emma didn't resist. Instead, she found herself enjoying the warmth and sense of security his arms provided. Her cheeks flushed slightly as she leaned into him, listening to his steady breathing.

What am I doing? Why am I thinking like this? Emma forced her mind to quiet and closed her eyes again, drifting back to sleep.

Ethan looked down at her, a soft smile playing on his lips. He admired her delicate eyelashes and the gentle curve of her nose. "Don't worry," he thought, "I'll make sure nothing ever troubles you again."

"Sir, we've arrived," the driver announced quietly, pulling up to the wellness center's entrance.

"Shh," Ethan whispered, putting a finger to his lips, signaling the driver not to disturb Emma. He continued to hold her, letting her sleep peacefully.

Eventually, Emma stirred awake. Confused by the stillness, she looked around. "Why aren't we moving? Is it a red light?" she wondered, slowly opening her eyes to find they were parked in a lot. She turned to Ethan, who greeted her with a smile. "You're awake."

"Why didn't you wake me when we arrived?" she asked, taking in her surroundings and realizing they were at the wellness center.

"I wanted you to rest a bit more," he replied, genuinely concerned.

Emma was touched by his kindness, though she tried not to show it. She opened the car door and stepped out, looking back at Ethan, who was still sitting in the car.

"What's wrong?" she asked, noticing his arm seemed stiff.

"My arm's a bit numb," he admitted, showing a slight grin. She realized she had used his arm as a pillow the entire ride and felt a pang of guilt.

"Let me help," Emma said, leaning back into the car to massage his arm gently. Ethan watched her, a soft smile on his lips.

"Why are you smiling?" she asked, noticing his expression.

"It's rare to see you being so nice to me," he said, a hint of pride in his voice.

Emma rolled her eyes playfully, giving his arm a light tap. "Let's go."

Together, they walked into the wellness center.

"Ethan Clark, welcome," the head physician greeted them warmly. After all, Ethan’s family, the Clarks, were major stakeholders in the facility.

"How's Mr. Meng doing?" Ethan inquired, pausing to speak with the physician.

"He's recovering well and has woken up. With continued care, he should fully recover," the doctor explained.

Ethan pulled Emma closer, whispering, "Did you hear that? Uncle's going to be okay."

Emma felt a weight lift from her shoulders, relief washing over her. "Let's go see him," Ethan said, leading her down the corridor.

At the door to the recovery room, Emma hesitated, peering through the glass. Inside, her uncle was propped up on the bed, chatting with her aunt. She knocked gently before entering.

"Emma, you're here!" her aunt exclaimed, ushering her inside. "Your uncle is awake."

Emma's eyes welled up with tears of joy. "Uncle," she managed, rushing to his bedside, her voice catching in her throat.

"Emma, you've come," her uncle said, reaching out for her hand. She quickly took it, worried he'd strain himself.

"You’re finally awake," she said, her voice choked with emotion.

Ethan watched from a distance, feeling a deep sympathy for Emma. Her family was her Achilles' heel. She was so strong and independent in front of others, yet with her family, she was vulnerable, willing to sacrifice her happiness for their well-being.

"Doctor, when can I be discharged?" her uncle asked, attempting to sit up.

"You’re improving, but you need to stay for further recovery," the doctor advised, holding his chart.

"Uncle, please focus on getting better here," Ethan said, standing behind Emma, reassuring her with a gentle pat on her shoulder.

"Emma, your aunt told me it’s all thanks to you," her uncle said weakly.

"It’s what I should do," she replied.

"Come, sit and talk," her uncle invited.

Ethan took a seat on the sofa, observing Emma with concern as she conversed with her uncle.

"How do you feel, Uncle? Please don’t rush to leave. You need to fully recover first," Emma urged, her expression full of worry.

"I’m fine, really," her uncle reassured her, his voice soft. "See, I’m doing well."

Emma noticed a fruit platter on the table. She peeled an orange, handing it to her uncle. "Remember when I was little? You loved the oranges I peeled for you."

Her uncle chuckled, eating a slice. "You used to say that, but you’d end up eating them all yourself."

Emma laughed, relieved to see her uncle in good spirits, joking with her. Her earlier anxiety faded away.

So, her favorite fruit was oranges, not blueberries? Ethan thought, amused by the revelation.

Watching Emma, her face brighter than before as she enjoyed an orange, Ethan felt a warmth in his heart, glad to see her happy.
