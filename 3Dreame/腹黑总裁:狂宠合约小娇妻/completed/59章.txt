The whole arranged marriage thing had its reasons, but love? Love was something else entirely. Emma Thomas nestled against Ethan Clark, her mind swirling with thoughts. Just as the moment felt too perfect to be real, Ethan's phone shattered the silence with a persistent ring.

"Ring, ring, ring."

Ethan reluctantly let go of Emma to grab his phone. "Hello?" he answered.

"Ethan, it's urgent," came a frantic voice from the other end. "Oliver Thomas is causing a scene at your office right now."

"Got it," Ethan replied calmly, standing up and preparing to head out, his demeanor unfazed by the chaos described on the call.

"Is my dad really at your company?" Emma asked, overhearing enough to piece together the situation.

Ethan nodded, reassuring her, "I'll handle it and be back soon. We'll go grab food after." He had no intention of dragging her into the mess of corporate shenanigans.

But Emma wasn't having any of it. "I'm coming with you," she insisted. This whole situation revolved around her, after all. She couldn't let Ethan shoulder it alone.

Ethan met her gaze, recognizing the sincerity in her eyes. "Alright, let's go," he conceded, wrapping an arm around her as they headed out the door.

As they arrived at the company, they were greeted by a flustered Sophia Wright on the eighth floor. "Emma, Ethan, you're here."

Ethan gave a polite nod. "We're just going to handle a little situation. Catch up with you later, Sophia," Emma said with a nod before they continued on to the office.

At the door, Daniel Johnson, the assistant, stood looking visibly stressed. "Ethan, thank goodness you're here. I can't deal with Oliver Thomas."

Ethan gave a nod of thanks, then turned to Emma, giving her hand a reassuring squeeze as they entered the office together.

"Finally, Ethan, Emma, you’ve arrived," Oliver Thomas said from his seat on the couch, sipping tea as if he’d been expecting them all along.

"Oliver, what brings you here?" Ethan asked, guiding Emma to the couch beside him, his tone polite but firm.

Oliver chuckled, setting his cup down. "Ethan, since you married my daughter, shouldn't you at least call me 'father-in-law'?"

"Father-in-law, then," Ethan replied with a slight smile. "What can I do for you?"

Oliver got straight to the point. "We had an agreement when you married Emma. You'd invest in Group Thomas and keep only your shares. Now you've teamed up with Michael Young and taken over everything. What gives?"

Ethan met Oliver's gaze, unflinching. "Plans change. At first, I wasn't interested in Thomas Group's shares, but then I realized—why not take what I can get?"

Emma, sitting next to Ethan, felt a pang of guilt towards her father. She opened her mouth to speak, but Oliver cut her off.

"Emma, talk some sense into him. Group Thomas was meant for you. It's your mother and my life's work."

Emma hesitated, feeling her resolve waver. After all, Oliver was her father, and despite everything, there was still that bond.

Ethan, sensing her turmoil, stepped in. "Father-in-law, you have another daughter. If Group Thomas is truly for Emma, then there's nothing to worry about. It's already hers."

Oliver didn't seem convinced. "You two planned this all along, didn't you? This isn't just a business arrangement."

Emma gave a small, knowing smile. "Dad, if the company was meant for me, then you have nothing to worry about. Ethan's already transferred most of the shares to my name."

"What?!" Oliver was taken aback, disbelief painted across his face.

"We may have started as a business alliance, but Ethan's intentions are genuine. Like he said, arranged marriages have motives, but liking someone? That's just pure."

Ethan turned to Emma with a warm smile, and she returned it with a look of newfound affection. Maybe he really did care for her.

Oliver sighed, a mix of admiration and resignation in his eyes. "Emma, you really are your mother's daughter."

He stood, knowing he couldn't change the current course. "Take good care of the company, Emma," he said, a note of pride in his voice.

"Don't worry, I'll help Emma manage it," Ethan assured, holding her hand. Emma stayed silent, her thoughts a mix of relief and sadness.

As Oliver left, the office felt quieter, almost peaceful. Ethan turned to Emma, noticing her expression. "What's on your mind?"

Emma shook her head. "Was I too harsh on him?"

Ethan squeezed her hand gently. "Group Thomas is your mother's legacy. It's right back where it belongs."
