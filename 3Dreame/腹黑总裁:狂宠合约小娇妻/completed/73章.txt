Ethan Clark parked his car in front of a fancy restaurant, and he and Emma Thomas stepped out together. "Let's go," he said, gently taking her hand as they made their way inside.

"Take a look and see what you want to eat," Ethan offered, handing Emma the menu. 

Emma just smiled, "I'm good with anything." She wasn't picky, so she was happy with whatever Ethan chose.

"Let's go with the house specials, and add a dessert," Ethan decided, passing the menu to the waiter. "When the dessert comes, you have to try it," he teased Emma with a smile.

Emma nodded, returning his smile, when suddenly Ethan's phone rang. 

"Hello? Oh, where are you?" His voice lit up with surprise. "I'll head over soon," he said before hanging up.

"Is everything okay?" Emma asked, glancing up with concern.

"A client just showed up at the karaoke bar with Henry Baker," Ethan explained, looking apologetically at Emma. 

"Let's hurry over then! This is such a good opportunity," Emma encouraged, understanding the importance of the situation.

Ethan felt guilty for having to leave so soon after sitting down. "We'll take the dessert to go," he promised.

Emma, always understanding, smiled and said, "We can eat anytime, but a client is hard to come by."

With a shared understanding, they took the dessert to go and headed to the karaoke bar.

The moment they opened the door to the private room, the smell of alcohol hit Emma. "You're here, Ethan!" Henry Baker greeted, rushing over. Spotting Emma, he added with a grin, "And Emma, you came too!"

Emma nodded politely. 

"Ethan, you go ahead. I'll be fine here," she assured him, knowing he didn't want her caught up in the drinking scene.

"Alright," Ethan nodded, leaving Emma in a quieter corner. 

The room was loud and bustling, so Emma pulled out her phone to pass the time. A girl soon sat beside her, offering a bottle of beer. "Hey there, why aren't you singing?"

Emma looked up at the pretty girl, shaking her head, "I don't really sing."

"You came with Ethan, right?" the girl asked directly.

"Yeah," Emma replied.

"Well, if you're Ethan's friend, you're mine too! Let's have a drink," the girl said, handing Emma the beer.

Emma, feeling thirsty, took a sip. "I'll catch you later," the girl said, getting up to leave.

Left alone, Emma continued sipping the beer, losing track of how much she drank until she felt a little tipsy.

"Emma," Ethan's voice brought her back as he returned to her side.

"You're back!" she greeted him with a flushed face.

"You've been drinking?" Ethan asked, surprised by her tipsiness.

"I was just so thirsty," Emma explained, gesturing with her fingers to show how little she'd intended to drink.

Ethan couldn't help but laugh. "Drinking beer like it's waterâ€”you're one of a kind," he said, feeling both amused and guilty for leaving her alone.

"Let's get you home," Ethan decided, gently picking her up. Emma wrapped her arms around his neck, resting her head on his shoulder.

He called for a driver and settled Emma into the back seat, letting her lean against him. "So comfy," she murmured, clutching his arm as she dozed off.

Ethan watched her with a fond smile, charmed by her sleepy demeanor.

Once they got home, Ethan carefully carried Emma upstairs to her bed. She reached up, poking his cheek, "How is your face so pretty?" she wondered aloud.

Ethan paused, smiling. "Do you like it?"

"Mm-hmm," she nodded sleepily.

"Do you like me?" he asked, hopeful and a bit nervous.

Emma hesitated, her face turning red. "I think... I might," she confessed.

"Might what?" he pressed, leaning closer.

"Like you," she admitted shyly.

Ethan's heart soared at her words. He leaned down, planting a gentle kiss on her cheek, then couldn't resist kissing her lips.

"How about we have a baby?" he asked, half-joking, half-serious, as he gazed at her.

"A baby? Sure," Emma giggled, nodding.

Ethan kissed her again, deeper this time, as they lost themselves in the moment. Later, as they lay together, Ethan wrapped her in his arms, whispering softly as they drifted to sleep.

When the morning light peeked through the curtains, Emma woke up, feeling a bit disoriented. She glanced at Ethan beside her, still sleeping peacefully. Did we really... last night? she wondered, blushing at the memory.

Just as she reached to touch his face, Ethan stirred. "You're awake?" he asked, his voice gentle.

"Yeah," Emma replied, feeling sheepish.

"You sleep well?" he asked, pulling her close.

"Very," she admitted, feeling a mix of embarrassment and happiness about the night before.

"I'm starving. Let's get some breakfast," Ethan suggested.

"Okay," Emma agreed, getting out of bed to freshen up, Ethan following suit.

And with that, a new chapter in their lives began, filled with the warmth and promise of shared mornings.
