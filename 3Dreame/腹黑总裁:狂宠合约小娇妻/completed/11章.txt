Emma Thomas stood frozen in place, wrestling with her thoughts. "Am I really going to move in with him?" she wondered, her mind a whirlwind of doubt. "Living together isn't exactly ideal, but he has a point. If we live separately, it might raise suspicions."

Lost in her contemplation, she was brought back to reality by Grace Gonzalez's voice. "Dinner's ready, ma'am. Shall we head down?"

Emma nodded, snapping out of her reverie, and made her way to the dining table. She chose the seat farthest from Ethan Clark, hoping to avoid any awkwardness. But Ethan noticed immediately. "Sitting so far away, how are you going to reach the food?"

"I'm eating just fine," Emma replied nonchalantly, trying to brush him off.

"Who doesn’t eat?" Ethan shot back with a smirk as he took a bite of his meal.

Emma muttered under her breath, "Eat more, maybe you'll get chubby."

Seeing that Emma still hadn't moved closer, Ethan motioned for Grace to bring the dishes over to her. Just then, two men strolled into the dining room with teasing grins.

"Hey, Ethan’s actually sitting down for a meal?" one of them quipped as they approached. William Jones leaned over Emma, scrutinizing her with curious eyes. "So, this is your new wife, huh?" he asked, glancing at Ethan.

Emma put down her fork, offering a polite smile despite feeling uncomfortable. "She’s as stunning as a goddess," William continued to tease, clearly enjoying himself.

Andrew Baker chimed in with a respectful nod. "Hello there, sis-in-law."

"Sis-in-law?" Emma was taken aback, glancing over at Ethan for some kind of clarification, but he offered none. She hastily waved her hands. "No... I'm not."

Andrew, as serious as ever, explained, "We've been like brothers with Ethan since we were kids. Now that you're married to him, you're naturally our sis-in-law."

"Hey, sis-in-law, you’re so good-looking. Are all your friends this pretty too?" William added, playfully. "I heard there’s a campus queen at your school named Lisa. Can you introduce us sometime?"

Ethan finally intervened, putting down his utensils and wiping his mouth. "Enough teasing, guys. Let me introduce you to Emma Thomas, my wife." He got up and walked over to Emma, picking her up in a gentle embrace and moving toward the couch.

"Don’t move," he whispered in her ear. "This is crucial for the Thomas Group's acquisition."

Emma, playing along, wrapped her arms around his neck, nestling into his chest. Ethan was momentarily stunned by her convincing act. His friends were equally amazed, having never seen Ethan, who had never shown interest in dating, act so tenderly.

"Wow, marriage really changes a guy, doesn't it?" William remarked.

"Yeah, he used to never even look at girls, let alone pamper one like this," Andrew agreed.

As they reached the couch, Ethan set Emma down gently, brushing her hair back with his fingers. Her large, bright eyes looked up at him, and he leaned in to kiss her softly on the lips.

"Really, Ethan? Making us single guys feel even lonelier?" William joked, shaking his head.

Emma blushed, pulling away slightly and curling up in Ethan's arms. "Embarrassed?" Ethan asked, smiling down at her.

"We came to tell you that the VP from Ling Corporation and the president of Thomas Group are meeting at Clear Spring Bar tonight to discuss the acquisition," William informed them as he settled into a chair.

Ethan turned to Emma, "Want to come along?" He began peeling an orange, offering a slice to Emma.

Emma took the orange, nodding. "I'd like to see how it goes."

Ethan grinned, "Great, we’ll go together."

William and Andrew were shocked. Ethan had always insisted on handling business meetings alone. Bringing Emma along was unprecedented.

"I’m tagging along too. It's been ages since I hit a bar. Maybe I'll run into my dream girl," William said with a wink.

"Count me in," Andrew added, sharing a grin with William.

"It's still early. How about we play some basketball?" William suggested.

Ethan looked at Emma, then shook his head. "You guys go ahead. I’ll stay with my wife."

"Aww, so sweet!" Andrew teased.

"Come on, sis-in-law, join us. We can head to the bar right after," William suggested enthusiastically.

Emma's cheeks flushed red, her heart racing. "Sure, that sounds fun."

"We’ll just change clothes upstairs," Ethan said, lifting Emma again and carrying her up to their room. Emma draped her arms around his neck, resting her chin on his shoulder.

"Okay, hurry up! We’ll wait here," Andrew called after them, plopping down on the couch.

"Put me down," Emma said once they were in the bedroom, trying to wriggle free.

Ethan set her down on a table, smirking. "What’s wrong? Done playing the dutiful wife?"

"You asked me to act along. The scene’s over now," Emma replied, attempting to slide off the table.

Ethan blocked her path, leaning closer. "Who was that kissing so earnestly just now?"

"You...you were just too aggressive," Emma retorted, slightly flustered.

Ethan found her flustered expression adorable, whispering in her ear, "You look so cute when you’re mad."

Feeling a warm flutter at his words, Emma tried to get up, only to be stopped by another kiss.

"What are you doing?" she protested. "We should keep our distance when no one's around."

She slipped away to the walk-in closet, leaving Ethan smiling to himself, savoring the moment before following her. 

"I had some outfits prepared for you. See if any suit your taste," he said, picking out his own clothes.

"That one’s not right for you," he commented as Emma picked a blue off-the-shoulder dress.

Emma shot him a look. "I think it’s nice."

As she reached for the dress, Ethan stopped her. "You’ve never been to a bar, have you? No one dresses like that there."

Emma hesitated, her eyes betraying her uncertainty. "Fine, I’ll pick another," she conceded, searching for something more appropriate.

"Try this one," Ethan suggested, handing her a simple white dress that fell just below the knee.

Emma took the dress and headed to the bathroom to change.
