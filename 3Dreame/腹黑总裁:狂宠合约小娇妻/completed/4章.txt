Linda Williams was bustling around the kitchen when Mrs. Thomas called out, "Linda, make sure to get extra groceries today. We have guests coming over."

"Sure thing, Mrs. Thomas," Linda replied cheerfully, heading towards the door as the doorbell rang.

"Wow, the milk delivery is early today," Linda commented as she opened the door, only to be greeted by an unfamiliar face.

"Who are you looking for?" she asked, slightly puzzled.

"Is this Mr. Thomas's residence?" the young man inquired.

"Is that you, Ethan Clark?" came Mrs. Thomas's voice from down the hall, as she hurried over to greet the visitor.

"Hello, Auntie. Yes, it's me, Ethan Clark," he confirmed with a polite smile.

"Come on in, come on in! It's been what, ten years since I last saw you? My goodness, you've grown so much!" Mrs. Thomas exclaimed, ushering him into the living room.

"You’re here early! Mr. Thomas went fishing this morning. Let me give him a call," Mrs. Thomas said, motioning for Ethan to take a seat while she reached for her phone.

"No need, Auntie. I’m here for the day, so I’ll just wait. I brought a little something for you and Uncle," Ethan said, presenting a neatly wrapped gift.

"Oh, you didn’t have to bring anything! You’re too kind," Mrs. Thomas chuckled, instructing Linda to bring some tea.

"When did you arrive in town?" she asked, settling into the conversation.

"I got here yesterday around noon and checked into the Maplewood Hotel," Ethan replied.

"A hotel? Oh, those places are so impersonal. Why don’t you stay here? Mr. Thomas could use a chess partner," Mrs. Thomas suggested, her intentions clear.

"Well, if you insist, I’d be happy to stay," Ethan agreed with a knowing smile, seeing through Mrs. Thomas's matchmaking plan, which aligned perfectly with his own intentions regarding Emma Thomas.

The sound of footsteps on the stairs caught everyone's attention.

"Emma! Come down here, we have guests!" Mrs. Thomas called out, waving her daughter over.

Emma Thomas glanced at her mother before her eyes landed on Ethan. Wait, isn't this the guy I bumped into at the hotel yesterday? What's he doing here?

Emma's curiosity piqued as she slowly made her way to her mother’s side.

"Ethan, this is Emma, our daughter. She’s still in college, about to graduate this June," Mrs. Thomas introduced.

"Nice to meet you, Emma. I’m Ethan Clark," he said, extending his hand.

Emma's mind was racing. Ethan Clark? The one I joked with yesterday? And he's the one I'm supposed to marry? Oh, this is awkward. But he’s acting like we’ve never met. What a smooth operator.

"Emma? Are you alright?" Mrs. Thomas nudged her.

"Uh, yeah, I’m fine," Emma replied, shaking off her surprise.

"Why don’t you show Ethan around town after lunch?" Mrs. Thomas suggested, hoping to encourage some bonding.

"Sure, if Emma doesn’t mind," Ethan replied, looking at her expectantly.

Caught between a rock and a hard place, Emma nodded, "Yeah, sure."

As everyone settled on the couch, Mr. Thomas returned from his fishing trip.

"Ethan! It’s been ages. You’ve grown into quite the young man," Mr. Thomas greeted warmly.

"How’s your father doing?" he asked, engaging in a bit of small talk.

"He's doing well, thank you. And you, sir?" Ethan responded courteously.

"Oh, I’m getting on in years, but still kicking," Mr. Thomas chuckled before turning serious. "Ethan, let’s have a chat in the study."

Emma watched them disappear into the study, her mind filled with anxiety over the inevitable conversation about their arranged marriage.

Two hours passed with Emma fidgeting on her phone, growing more anxious by the minute. They must be hashing out some serious terms, she thought.

Finally, the study door creaked open, and her father's voice rang out, "Linda, lunch is ready!"

Mr. Thomas emerged with Ethan, both looking pleased and sharing a laugh, signaling a successful negotiation.

After lunch, Ethan and Emma found themselves on Main Street, a popular hangout spot.

"We met yesterday, didn’t we?" Emma finally blurted out, unable to contain her curiosity any longer.

"Yesterday you were a stranger, but today you’re Emma Thomas," Ethan replied smoothly.

"What did you discuss with my dad in the study?" she pressed, trying to cut to the chase.

"What do you think?" Ethan teased.

Frustrated with his evasiveness, Emma decided to be direct. "Why do you want to marry me?"

Ethan stepped closer, his gaze steady, "Why? Do you not want to marry me?"

Emma blushed under his intense stare, her heart racing. She backed away slightly, "We hardly know each other. How can there be any real feelings?"

"Well, we know each other now," Ethan said, amused by her flustered demeanor.

"But if this marriage is happening, I have a condition," Emma declared, trying to regain her composure.

"Oh? Let’s hear it," Ethan replied, intrigued.

"I want 30% of Group Thomas’s shares in my name, not as marital property," Emma stated firmly.

"And if I refuse?" Ethan challenged, clearly enjoying the negotiation.

"You must have struck a deal with my dad. If we don’t ally, I’ll sell the property my mother left me, and that would affect your agreement," Emma explained.

"Alright, I agree," Ethan conceded after a thoughtful pause, understanding the leverage she held.

"Words are cheap. Let’s get it in writing," Emma insisted.

Spotting a print shop, she dashed inside, with Ethan following curiously.

"Can I use your computer to draft a document?" Emma asked the shop owner.

"Sure," he replied, moving aside.

Emma quickly typed up a prenuptial agreement stating her terms, printed it, and handed it to Ethan along with a pen.

"Sign here. It’s better to have things written down," she said.

Impressed by her decisive nature, Ethan signed without hesitation, knowing the informal document held no real legal weight.

"Here’s your copy," Emma handed him a signed sheet.

"How much do I owe you?" she asked the shop owner.

"Two bucks."

Emma paid and left the shop, feeling a sense of accomplishment. Both she and Ethan had secured what they wanted from this unconventional union.
