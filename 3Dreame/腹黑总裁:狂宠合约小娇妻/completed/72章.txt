Emma Thomas finally figured out why Ethan Clark had been in such a bad mood that day.

As the clock hit quitting time, the office slowly emptied, but Emma Thomas stayed glued to her desk, working away. "Emma, I'm heading out. See you tomorrow," Lily Lewis called as she packed up and left.

With the office now deserted, Ethan Clark emerged from his own workspace and strolled over to Emma's desk. "Ready to go?" he asked.

Emma glanced up at him, a hint of frustration in her eyes that didn’t go unnoticed by Ethan. "What's up?" he asked, concerned.

She shook her head and forced a smile. "Just a tough project," she replied as she gathered her things, and they both headed out.

Back at home, the two discussed the project for the next day before Emma called it an early night, hoping a good rest would help sort her thoughts.

The next morning, her alarm buzzed, and Emma was up, shutting it off and going through her morning routine. By the time she came downstairs, Ethan was already captivated by her polished appearance. "Wow, your outfit and makeup are really on point today," he complimented, making Emma beam with happiness.

After breakfast, they drove off to a business meeting. Ethan parked the car at a corporate complex, and they made their way to Mr. Wang's company, navigating through the maze of hallways.

"Mr. Clark, you’re here!" Mr. Wang greeted them as they entered the lobby.

"Hey, Mr. Wang! It's been a while. Your new place was tricky to find," Ethan teased.

"Not at all, Mr. Clark," Mr. Wang replied with a chuckle. As they were about to head upstairs, Mr. Wang noticed Emma and asked, "Isn't Lily Lewis usually with you?"

Ethan responded casually, "This is my new assistant, Emma Thomas. You met her last time when you visited our office."

"Oh right, the one who made tea," Mr. Wang recalled, teasingly.

"Hello, Mr. Wang. I'm Emma Thomas, but you can just call me Emma," she introduced herself warmly.

In the meeting room, the team launched into a discussion about the project. After Mr. Wang finished outlining the plan, he turned to Ethan for his thoughts.

Ethan glanced at Emma with a smile, "Emma, what do you think?"

Surprised murmurs echoed in the room—a big shot like Ethan Clark asking his assistant's opinion!

Emma, unfazed, responded, "Mr. Wang, I really like your proposal, but isn't the timeline a bit tight?"

Ethan was impressed. He hadn't expected her to spot that issue so quickly.

Mr. Wang, removing his glasses, replied with a serious tone, "Emma, this project is urgent, so we need to maximize efficiency."

"Mr. Clark," Mr. Wang continued, "even though the timeline is short, we can allocate more resources to maintain quality."

Ethan closed his file and said, "Emma's right. The timeline is too tight. Even with more resources, without a proper preliminary report, we're just spinning our wheels."

"Mr. Wang, I suggest we start with the research and also talk to the clients to see if we can extend the timeline. If not, we need to execute Plan B quickly."

"Okay, you handle the research, and I'll negotiate with the clients," Ethan concluded, looking at Mr. Wang.

Mr. Wang was pleased and agreed enthusiastically.

"Sounds like a plan," Mr. Wang echoed.

"Thanks, Mr. Clark," Mr. Wang said as he closed the file, inviting Ethan to chat in his office.

"Sorry, Mr. Wang, we have other commitments," Ethan politely declined, leading Emma out of the building.

"Take care, Mr. Clark. Let’s catch up soon," Mr. Wang called as they reached the elevator.

"You too, Mr. Wang. See you next time," Ethan replied, waving off any further farewells.

In the elevator, Emma turned to Ethan, puzzled. "Why did you agree to talk to the clients about the timeline?"

"You noticed Mr. Wang didn’t want to handle that. His company prides itself on quick turnarounds, but we're focused on quality. I can’t risk Group Clark's reputation for this project," Ethan explained while driving back.

Emma nodded, understanding his motivation. He was thinking beyond just this branch, considering the entire Group Clark's reputation. "I get it now," she said softly.

"Was it the timeline issue that bothered you that day?" Emma finally pieced it together.

"Yeah, I’ve been racking my brain for solutions, but extending the timeline is our best bet," Ethan admitted.

Emma looked at him, intrigued. "I feel like I understand you a bit more now."

"Do you? Tell me how," Ethan asked, curious about her perception of him.

"Let's keep some mystery," Emma replied with a smile.

"You'll do great. I believe in you," she reassured him.

"So, what do you want for dinner, little foodie?" Ethan teased, ruffling her hair affectionately.

"Isn't it a bit early to be thinking about dinner? Aren’t we heading back to the office?" Emma asked, surprised.

Ethan chuckled, "Let's celebrate this new phase of the project."

Emma looked at him curiously. "We haven’t really started, though."

"It’s a new phase because we’ve divided the tasks. Once I sort out the timeline, everything else falls into place," Ethan explained.

"True," Emma agreed upon reflection.

"I heard about a new restaurant with great desserts. Let’s give it a try," Ethan suggested as he turned the car around.

"Sure," Emma agreed, feeling more at ease now that Ethan seemed more relaxed.
