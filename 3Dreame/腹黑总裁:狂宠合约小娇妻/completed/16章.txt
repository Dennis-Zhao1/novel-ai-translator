Emma Thomas followed Ethan Clark as he made his way to the study. Ethan opened a drawer with a fingerprint scanner and pulled out an official-looking document, handing it to Emma casually. "Let's go to the Mengs' place," he said.

Emma glanced at the document and hesitated. "My records aren't with the Mengs."

Ethan stopped, turning to look at her suspiciously. "You better not be up to something."

"My records have always been with my mom," Emma replied, sighing as she looked at him. "Come on, I'll take you there." She turned and headed for the door.

They drove for over half an hour, and Ethan finally couldn't hold back his curiosity any longer. "Where are we going?"

"My grandma's place."

"By the way, can you stop at the department store up ahead? I want to pick up some things," Emma said, pointing the way.

The car pulled up in front of a busy department store. "You go on ahead. I'll find a place to park," Ethan said, eyeing the bustling entrance.

Inside on the first floor, Emma navigated through various snack shops. She found her favorite pineapple pastries and her grandma's beloved butterfly cookies, treats she brought every summer.

Ethan parked and entered the store, spotting Emma amidst the crowd. He jogged to catch up. "There's nothing much further ahead," he said, a bit out of breath.

Emma turned, surprised to see Ethan. "What’s up with you?"

"Nothing," Ethan replied, taking the gift bags from her hands. "Let's go."

Emma was puzzled. "Where are we going?" Ethan just smiled and led her toward the elevator.

They reached the fifth floor, and Ethan steered Emma down a corridor to a hidden pastry shop. "This place is famous for its sweets. Pick some for your grandma," he suggested, releasing her hand to let her browse.

Following the delightful smells, Emma found the pastries tempting, but the price shocked her. "Smells amazing, but wow, that's pricey," she muttered to herself.

"I've got it," Ethan said, reaching over to pay with his phone.

"Thanks," Emma said sheepishly.

Ethan took the pastries from the cashier, signaling Emma to follow him out of the store. "I'll pay you back," Emma promised as they walked.

Ethan just smiled, not saying a word. They drove for another hour before reaching a small, worn-out neighborhood. Ethan surveyed the surroundings. "Here?"

"Yeah, let's get out," Emma said, unbuckling her seatbelt and grabbing the gifts.

Ethan, sensing her struggle with the bags, took them from her. "Let me."

They climbed the stairs to the second floor of an old building, stopping at a door surrounded by discarded boxes. Emma knocked gently.

"I'm coming!" came the voice of an elderly woman from inside.

When the door opened, Emma threw her arms around her grandma. "Grandma!"

"Emma! Oh my, it's you!" her grandma exclaimed.

"I've missed you so much," Emma said, snuggling into her grandma’s embrace.

Ethan watched this side of Emma, seeing her drop the tough act he was used to at the Mengs' and become genuinely affectionate.

"Why are you here before summer break? Is something wrong?" Grandma asked, pulling back to look at Emma.

Noticing Ethan, Grandma asked, "And who might this be?"

With a smile, Ethan introduced himself. "I'm Ethan Clark."

"Grandma, let's go inside. I brought your favorite treats," Emma said, eager to change the subject and ushering her grandma inside. Ethan followed, taking in the cozy, modest two-bedroom apartment.

"Have a seat. I'll get us some fruit," Grandma said, heading to the kitchen.

Ethan and Emma settled on the couch, and soon Grandma returned with bowls of grapes and cherry tomatoes. "Emma, these are your favorite."

"Grandma, I... we..." Emma stammered, unsure how to start. Ethan glanced at her and took the lead. "Grandma, Emma and I got married."

Grandma was taken aback, turning to Emma. "Emma, is this true?"

Emma nodded, hesitant but confirming it.

"Oh, dear, such a big event, and you didn't tell us?" Grandma's voice was tinged with concern.

Ethan explained, "We had a ceremony in Green City. Once we're settled here, we'll have another one, and you must come."

"Of course, I'd never miss Emma's wedding," Grandma said, her mood lifting with the news.

"We haven't registered our marriage yet, and since Emma's graduating soon, we're here to do that," Ethan added, looking warmly at Emma.

"Emma, is this what you want?" Grandma asked, squeezing her hand.

"Yes, Grandma. Ethan and I truly love each other," Emma confirmed, sharing a glance with Ethan.

Emma hugged her grandma tightly, resting her head on Grandma’s shoulder. "Please, Grandma, can we have the document?" she pleaded.

Relenting, Grandma patted Emma’s back. "Alright, alright."

"Thank you, Grandma," Emma said, looking gratefully at Ethan. Ethan echoed her gratitude. "Thank you, Grandma. I'll always take good care of Emma."

"Now, I'll make us some food. After eating, you can go get your papers sorted," Grandma said, heading to the kitchen.

Emma quickly followed. "I'll help you, Grandma."

Grandma turned to Ethan. "Ethan, you've been driving a long time. If you're tired, rest in Emma's room."

"Thank you," Ethan smiled, accepting the offer. He was indeed worn out and headed to Emma's room to rest.

Inside, he noticed a wall filled with awards. A cabinet displayed dolls, and the desk held a photo album. Flipping through it, he found childhood pictures of Emma with her parents.

Ethan chuckled to himself, thinking how Emma had always been beautiful, even as a kid.
