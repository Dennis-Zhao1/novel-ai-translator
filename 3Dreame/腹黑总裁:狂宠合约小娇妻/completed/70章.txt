Emma Thomas glanced up, her cheeks slightly flushed as she protested, "Who said I want to sleep with you?" She kept her head down, focusing on her dinner.

"Eat up," Ethan Clark said with a warm smile, adding more food to her plate.

After dinner, the two of them got busy with their respective tasks.

"I've got some work to finish upstairs," Ethan said gently as he finished his meal.

"Go ahead," Emma replied softly, waving him off to his duties.

Left alone in the living room, Emma felt a bit lost. She thought back to everything that had happened at work earlier that day. Everyone was so driven and ambitious, and she knew she couldn't slack off either.

Sitting on the couch, she pondered for a while before picking up her phone to research some topics.

Her mind wandered back to Ethan. He's like a live-in tutor, she thought. If I follow his lead, I could probably learn a lot quickly. But he's so busy, where would he find the time to teach me from scratch? No, I need to rely on myself. I'll start with some books and then ask him if I get stuck. That might be a better approach.

Determined, Emma got up and headed to the second floor. She approached the study door, knocking softly before peeking in. "I'm just here to grab something," she whispered.

Ethan looked up, a smile on his face. "You don't have to be so polite at home. Just come in whenever."

Emma grinned and moved toward the bookshelf, searching through the volumes.

Ethan watched her rummage through the books in silence before asking, "Looking for something? I can help."

"I don't know much about finance, so I thought I'd find some books to study," Emma said, turning to face him.

Ethan raised an eyebrow, a bit surprised. "What made you suddenly interested in finance?"

Emma's gaze shifted to his desk. "I need to learn about it eventually, and I have the time now, so why not? Besides, I've got to be ready for when I take over Thomas Group. I can't let it fall apart under my watch," she said with a smile.

Ethan nodded, understanding her motivation. He stood up, scanning the bookshelf before pulling out a book. "Try this," he suggested, handing it to her, his eyes soft and encouraging.

"Thomas Group won't crumble on your watch. I'll be here to help you. You've got me," Ethan said, his voice filled with reassurance.

Emma nodded, feeling a pang of gratitude. But deep inside, she couldn't shake the feeling that she needed to stand on her own. She'd grown up learning not to rely on anyone, and even with Ethan, she was cautious.

Ethan seemed to sense her hesitation and added, "This is a beginner's guide. Start with this, and if you have questions, just ask."

He gently ruffled her hair, his touch tender and comforting.

Emma smiled brightly, taking the book. "Thanks," she said, moving to sit across from him, ready to dive into her studies.

"Little foodie, you don't need to thank me," Ethan teased, affectionately tapping the back of her head.

The nickname felt oddly endearing to Emma. "Little foodie? I guess that's kind of cute," she admitted.

Ethan chuckled, "You definitely are one."

He motioned for her to take his spot, grabbing his documents and moving to the opposite side of the desk.

Emma watched him, appreciating his attention to detail. She settled into the chair, glancing at Ethan with a small smile.

"What's up?" Ethan asked, noticing her gaze.

"Nothing," Emma replied softly, returning his smile before focusing on the book.

They sat in companionable silence, each absorbed in their work, as the moonlight spilled through the windows. Ethan occasionally glanced at Emma, feeling more assured about their future together.

As the night wore on, Ethan noticed the time. "Shouldn't we call it a night? It's getting late."

Emma looked up, admiring the way the light played on Ethan's features. "I'm not tired yet. Just a little longer."

"Oh, are you waiting for me?" Ethan teased, a playful grin on his face.

Emma hesitated, realizing her behavior was unusual. She usually went to bed early, and now it was close to midnight. "Don't flatter yourself. I'm really studying," she insisted, diving back into her book.

But as the night dragged on, sleepiness crept in, and Emma eventually dozed off on her book.

Ethan noticed her sleeping form, a soft smile tugging at his lips. He quietly finished his work, then walked over, gently scooping her up and carrying her to their bedroom. As he laid her down, she instinctively wrapped her arms around his neck, murmuring something he couldn't quite catch.

He waited until she settled, then gently untangled himself and tucked her in, pressing a tender kiss to her forehead. After turning off the bedside lamp, he headed back to the study to finish up his work.
