**Title: The Sweet Transfer**

Emma Thomas stepped out of the bathroom, all fresh and ready for the day, and noticed Ethan Clark glued to his phone. Curiosity got the best of her.

"Why aren't you brushing your teeth?" she asked.

Ethan flashed a quick smile, "I'm on it," and off he went to the bathroom.

Weird, she thought. Why is he so chipper this morning? Did something good happen? After his unusual morning cheer, Emma couldn't help but wonder.

After giving it a shrug, Emma left the bedroom.

Downstairs, Ethan greeted Grace Gonzalez, the housekeeper, with a question about breakfast. Grace looked surprised. "Same as usual, sir, but I did bake some pastries. Give them a try!"

It had been a while since Grace had seen Ethan this happy.

Ethan sat at the dining table, pulling out a chair for himself. He leaned slightly towards Emma, who was digging into her toast, and whispered, "After breakfast, I'm taking you somewhere special."

Emma paused, bread halfway to her mouth. "Where to?"

Ethan gave a mysterious smile, sipped his milk, and said softly, "The shares of Thomas Group are now in your name."

Emma's eyes widened. "What did you just say?"

"You heard me right," Ethan confirmed, grinning. "Thomas Group is all yours."

Emma, now ecstatic, grabbed Ethan's arm, shaking it in disbelief. "You mean Thomas Group is mine from today?"

"Yep." Ethan looked at her with so much affection, clearly enjoying her excitement.

But Emma couldn't shake off her curiosity. Why would Ethan give her the shares so easily now? When they first made the business deal, she had to negotiate hard. Was it because of last night?

She pondered Ethan's sudden generosity. "Why are you giving them all to me?" she finally asked, needing to hear his reasons.

Ethan looked at her lovingly. "Isn't this what you've always wanted?"

"Yes, but I had to ask you for them before. Why now?"

Ethan leaned in, his gaze tender. "Because we're married now. What's mine is yours."

Emma beamed at him, jokingly nudging his arm. "So, by that logic, do I get a piece of Clark Group too?"

Ethan chuckled at her playful greed. "Well, if you want it, I could arrange that."

Emma laughed, "Just kidding! I'm only interested in Thomas Group. It's my mom's legacy."

Ethan nodded, understanding. "And what about me, the heir to Clark Group? Any interest there?"

Emma blushed, her cheeks turning a soft pink. "Well, that depends on your performance," she teased.

Ethan laughed, brushing a stray hair from her face. He handed her a glass of milk. "Try this fresh milk, little foodie."

Emma grinned, taking a sip. "Not bad! Keep it up, heir of Clark Group."

Their laughter filled the room, and Emma's mind drifted to where Ethan might be taking her. "Are we going to Thomas Group later?"

"Yes," Ethan confirmed, "I've called a shareholders' meeting."

"I'll be officially announcing the transfer of shares to you. From now on, you're the CEO of Thomas Group," Ethan said, his eyes full of pride.

Emma was stunned by how smoothly he had arranged everything. She felt increasingly reliant on him.

"You're amazing," she admitted, looking at Ethan with admiration.

"Well, we have a meeting at ten," Ethan glanced at his watch, noting it was only eight-thirty.

"So, your morning grin was about this?" Emma asked, recalling his happy expression earlier.

"Yes, I sorted everything out with the shareholders, and it's all set for today," Ethan explained.

Emma realized how much Ethan had done behind the scenes. No wonder the shareholders had been so agreeable. He had paved the way for her.

"Ethan," Emma said, setting her breakfast aside and looking at him with teary eyes.

"Yes?" he responded, concerned.

"I'm just... really touched," Emma admitted. She hadn't felt this cherished in a long time.

Ethan always prioritized her needs, finding solutions to her problems.

"Little foodie," Ethan teased, patting her head gently. "I'll always be here."

Emma nodded, smiling.

"Finish up, we need to get going soon," Ethan reminded her, watching her eat.

He promised himself that he would always be by her side, protecting her from any harm.

Ethan looked at Emma with deep affection, feeling incredibly protective of her.
