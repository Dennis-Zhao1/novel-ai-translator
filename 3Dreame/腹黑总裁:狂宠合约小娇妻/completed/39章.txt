Chapter 1: Sneaking Out

Emma Thomas was feeling suffocated. She needed to get out of the house, even if it was just for a little while. As she made her way to the front door, Grace Gonzalez, the housekeeper, intercepted her.

“Mrs. Thomas, where are you headed?” Grace asked, concern lacing her voice.

“I just need some fresh air, I’ll be back soon,” Emma replied. The car was already waiting outside, but Grace wasn’t about to let her leave easily.

“Mr. Thomas has instructed that you shouldn’t go out. Please, think of my position here,” Grace pleaded, trying to bar her way.

Emma, determined, gently pushed past her. “I’ll be back soon, Grace. Don’t worry,” she said, climbing into the car and shutting the door behind her.

Grace watched helplessly as the car pulled away. “Please, Mrs. Thomas, it’s so hot today. If something happens, how will I explain it to Mr. Thomas?” she shouted after the departing vehicle.

“Just drive,” Emma instructed the driver, staring out at the road ahead. They drove in silence for half an hour before the driver hesitantly asked, “Where to, ma’am?”

Emma needed to be discreet. She couldn’t let anyone in the family find out she was headed to the pharmacy. “Pull over up there,” she said, spotting a small alleyway with a pharmacy and a bookstore.

“I’ll just be a minute, grabbing a book,” Emma told the driver, stepping out and quickly ducking into the pharmacy where she hoped no one from the car could see her.

Inside, Emma browsed the aisles nervously. “Can I help you find something?” the pharmacist asked kindly.

“I’m just looking around,” Emma replied, her voice shaky. She couldn’t bring herself to ask for what she needed.

After a few minutes of futile searching, she approached the counter, her cheeks flushed. “Um, I was wondering if you have something for… you know, last night my husband and I didn’t… take precautions,” she finally managed to say, barely meeting the pharmacist’s eyes.

The pharmacist nodded understandingly and handed her a box. “You’re not ready for parenthood yet, I assume?”

Emma nodded, feeling embarrassed yet relieved. “Just take one of these later. But remember, it might have some side effects, so take it easy for a few days,” the pharmacist advised. “And remember, it’s important to take care of yourself. Be sure to use protection next time.”

Emma thanked the pharmacist, paid for the medication, and quickly slipped into the bookstore next door, grabbing a random book before heading back to the car.

“Let’s go home,” Emma instructed the driver, tossing the book onto the backseat as she climbed in.

On the ride back, Emma leaned her head against the window, thinking about the pharmacist’s advice. “Take care of yourself,” echoed in her mind. She couldn’t help but feel a bit of self-loathing for the choices she’d been making lately.

When they arrived back at the house, Grace was waiting anxiously. “Mrs. Thomas, where did you go?”

“I just went to buy a book,” Emma said nonchalantly, brushing past her and heading to the living room.

“Grace, it’s so hot today. Could I get some ice cream?” Emma asked, settling onto the couch.

“Of course, Mrs. Thomas. I’ll get your favorite, blueberry,” Grace replied, hurrying to the kitchen.

As she handed Emma the ice cream, Grace couldn’t help but worry aloud, “Please, next time, just let us know if you need something. This heat can be dangerous.”

“I know, I know,” Emma replied, starting to eat her ice cream. “You can go now. I’ll just rest here for a bit.”

“Alright then,” Grace said, taking her leave. “Oh, wait,” Emma called after her, “Could you bring me a glass of water?”

“Sure thing, Mrs. Thomas,” Grace said, leaving the water before heading to the backyard.

Emma took a moment to ensure she was alone before pulling the medication from her bag. With a quick glance around the empty room, she swallowed the pill, washing it down with a gulp of water.

“Hopefully, this will work,” she thought, a pang of anxiety hitting her. “If it doesn’t, maybe it’s just meant to be,” she mused, trying to push the worry aside. She had more pressing things to focus on, like her new job at Group Clark starting on Monday.

Her phone buzzed, interrupting her thoughts. “Hey, Sophia Wright,” Emma answered.

“Emma, what’s up?” Sophia’s voice crackled through the line.

“Just chilling with some ice cream,” Emma replied casually.

“Living the dream, huh? Did you find a job yet?” Sophia asked, a hint of envy in her voice.

Emma realized she might have sounded a bit too carefree. Sophia was still in the job hunt, and Emma didn’t want to make her feel bad. “I’m starting at Ethan Clark’s company tomorrow,” she explained. “What about you? Where are you now?”

“I’ve found a place to rent. Been moving my stuff in. I’ll get back to job hunting on Monday,” Sophia said, filling Emma in.

“I’ll come help you move tomorrow,” Emma offered eagerly. She knew how tough it could be to move alone, especially in a big city.

“No, really, it’s not much,” Sophia tried to decline.

“Don’t be silly. I’ll call a car and head over,” Emma insisted, determined to help.

“Then dinner’s on me tomorrow,” Sophia conceded, grateful for Emma’s friendship.

Emma valued her friendship with Sophia, one of her closest friends from college. Despite Sophia’s modest background, she never took advantage of Emma’s wealth, and she understood Emma in a way few others did. Maybe that’s why Emma found comfort in their friendship.
