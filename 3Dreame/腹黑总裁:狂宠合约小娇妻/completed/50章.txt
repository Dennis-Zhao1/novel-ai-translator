**Emma Thomas's Predicament**

Emma Thomas stood rooted to the spot, unable to move, while Ethan Clark gently turned to look at her. Seeing the distress in her eyes, he felt a pang of sympathy and pulled her into a comforting embrace. "It's okay, don't be afraid," he whispered soothingly.

"Is it true? Will the baby really be gone?" Emma's voice quivered with the question.

"It's going to be alright," Ethan reassured her, stroking her hair softly. "Do you think people will believe me?" Emma asked worriedly.

"I believe you," Ethan replied, letting her go and meeting her tearful gaze. The fear in her eyes tugged at his heartstrings. "Can you tell me what happened?" he asked cautiously, eager to help clear her name.

Emma nodded, looking at him with trust. "Let's walk and talk," Ethan suggested, guiding her towards the door.

They made their way to the hospital, and as they approached the room, they heard the voices of Emma's uncle, Mr. Jones, and her aunt, Mrs. Jones. Emma instinctively shrank back, but Ethan held her closer, looking into her eyes with determination. "It's okay. I'm here."

Ethan knocked on the door and entered. "You dare come here?" Mr. Jones, enraged, stepped towards Ethan, pointing an accusing finger at Emma. "Emma Thomas harmed my child. I want her life as compensation today."

Mr. Jones tried to pull Emma away, but she hid fearfully in Ethan's embrace. Ethan gently held Mr. Jones's arm, speaking softly, "Uncle, the truth hasn't been uncovered yet. Please show some respect to Emma."

Ethan then turned to Charlotte Jones, lying on the bed. "Charlotte, can you tell us what happened?" he asked loudly.

Just as Charlotte was about to speak, the voice of Grandma Jones came from the door. "What's going on?" she asked, entering the room slowly.

"Mom, thank goodness you're here," Mr. Jones said, rushing forward to support Grandma Jones as she walked to the bedside. "Mother, you must help me," Charlotte pleaded, trying to sit up, but Grandma Jones gently urged her to rest.

"Alright, you can talk while lying down," Grandma Jones said, helping Charlotte settle back. Emma, watching the expressions around her, felt anxious and unsure of how to defend herself. She nervously tugged at her shirt.

"Frank, close the door," Grandma Jones said, noting the people passing by outside. Family matters should remain private. Ethan closed the door, observing everyone's expressions, pondering how to uncover the real culprit.

"Everyone, have a seat," Grandma Jones said, settling onto the couch. Mrs. Jones sat by the bed, and Ethan led Emma to sit beside Grandma.

"Emma, can you tell me what happened that day?" Grandma Jones asked gently, seeing Emmaâ€™s anxiety.

"Grandma, that morning, Frank and I had just arrived at the front yard when Aunt invited me to taste some desserts she had prepared. Initially, I hesitated, but then Charlotte also invited me, so I agreed."

"We went to the kitchen, and it was empty. Aunt said she would call someone, and Charlotte sat down to rest while I looked at the desserts."

Emma paused, and Grandma encouraged her to continue, "What happened next?"

"Then... Charlotte said she was thirsty and asked me to get her a glass of water. I took a glass from the rack, filled it, and handed it to her."

"A while later, Aunt returned," Emma said quietly, realizing she hadn't actually seen Charlotte drink the water after handing it to her.

"I came back, and shortly after, Charlotte was in this condition," Mrs. Jones said calmly from the side.

"I am very cautious about my diet. Today's breakfast was the same as usual, so it couldn't be that. The only thing different was the water from the kitchen," Charlotte said tearfully.

"This doesn't..." Ethan began but was interrupted by a knock at the door. "Come in," Mrs. Jones called.

A doctor entered and approached the couch. Grandma stood up to greet him. "Dr. Wu, what's the verdict?"

"Madam, the tests show there's a chemical in her system that could induce a miscarriage," Dr. Wu said, looking at Grandma.

"Do you know which type of food it came from?" Grandma asked further.

"It's not specific, but it seems to have entered through liquids like soup, water, or drinks," Dr. Wu explained, reviewing the report.

"So it was you, Emma," Mr. Jones accused in distress.

"Enough!" Grandma interrupted firmly. "Thank you, Dr. Wu," she said, taking her seat again.

"Ensure the patient rests well. I'll be outside if you need me," Dr. Wu said before leaving.

"What else do you have to say?" Charlotte demanded angrily, glaring at Emma from her bed.

Emma sat beside Ethan, lost in thought. "Who could have done this to Charlotte? Why frame me? I've just joined the Jones family and haven't offended anyone. Could they be targeting Ethan?"

"If I'm framed, Ethan will be implicated. Could this be about the inheritance discussion at dinner? If so, wouldn't Mr. Jones's family be the prime suspects? Could he really harm his own child over inheritance?"

"Mom, what should we do? The evidence is all here," Mrs. Jones added fuel to the fire, catching Emma's attention.

The more Emma thought about it, the more suspicious she became. "Why is Aunt so eager? Could she be involved too? Where should I start investigating?"

"This requires further investigation. I'll have someone look into it," Ethan said calmly.

Emma snapped out of her thoughts, hearing Ethan's words. "Does he have a lead?" she wondered.

"Frank, are you covering for her? Did you instruct her to do this?" Mr. Jones asked in shock.

"No wonder... What benefit does Emma gain from this? But if you did it, things would be different. We would divide among fewer people, giving you more," Mr. Jones speculated excitedly.

"Uncle, there are many doubts about this case. We can't lay all the blame on Emma now," Ethan said firmly, holding Emma's hand.
