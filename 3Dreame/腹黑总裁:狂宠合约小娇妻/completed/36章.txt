Blurred Consciousness

"Ethan, are you okay?" Ethan Clark looked down at Emma Thomas cradled in his arms, asking gently.

Emma shook her head, her eyes drifting to the bookshelf behind the desk. Just as she was about to speak, Ethan interrupted, "I'll have someone pack these up and send them over to the Meng family later on."

"Thanks," Emma replied, glancing up at Ethan. For the first time, she didn't feel the urge to pull away. There was something comforting about being in his arms when she felt like she couldn’t handle things on her own.

A knock echoed through the conference room.

"Ethan, there's a document that needs your signature," Lulu, dressed in a revealing outfit and teetering on eight-inch heels, sauntered in, handing the paper to him.

"Just leave it on the desk, and get the office things sent over to Oliver Thomas' place later," Ethan instructed before turning his gentle gaze back to Emma.

He took Emma's hand, leading her out of the office and into the main workspace. "Everyone, please pause your work for a moment," he called out loudly.

"From now on, Emma Thomas here will be taking over as the chairperson of Thomas Group. All decisions should go through her," Ethan announced, looking warmly at Emma, nodding for her to say something.

"Hello, everyone. I hope we can work together to bring benefits to the company. Let's do our best," Emma said shyly, speaking in the company for the first time.

"Our dear Oliver Thomas is a bit shy, so let me add something," Ethan continued, causing Emma to blush. "Not only is Oliver Thomas the chairperson of Thomas Group, but she's also my wife. She might lack some social experience, but I'll be guiding her. In the meantime, I entrust company matters to David Williams."

Ethan looked over at David Williams, whose surprise was evident. Ethan continued, "I trust David Williams will lead the company to new heights."

David Williams stepped forward from the crowd, visibly moved. "Ethan, Oliver, rest assured, I'll do my utmost to help the company thrive," he said earnestly.

"Let's head back," Ethan said softly to Emma, who felt a surge of happiness. "Mom, I've got Thomas Group now. Don't worry; I'll take care of your hard work."

"Hmm," Emma nodded as Ethan wrapped his arm around her, guiding her to the elevator.

Inside the elevator, Ethan's phone rang. A sultry woman's voice came through, "Hey, Ethan."

"Hello," Ethan replied coldly.

"Ethan, I've been missing you. How about tonight..." she cooed, just as another woman's voice interrupted.

"Ethan, Michael Young has invited you for drinks tonight to discuss that project."

"What time?" Ethan inquired.

"I'll text you the details," the mature-sounding woman replied before hanging up with a final, "I'll be waiting."

Emma heard the entire conversation clearly. Ethan took the call right in front of her without any hesitation, even when the woman on the other end was inviting him for drinks.

Emma felt a twinge of jealousy. "Maybe he never really liked me," she thought. "We're just contractually married, after all."

"Let's go," Ethan said, pulling Emma along quickly. She looked at him, feeling as if he were a stranger. "Sometimes gentle, sometimes cold. What kind of person is he?" she wondered.

They reached the entrance of Thomas Group, where Ethan opened the car door for her. "You head home first. I’ve got some things to handle," he said, arranging for someone to take Emma back.

Through the car's rearview mirror, Emma watched Ethan flag a taxi heading in the opposite direction. She sat there, feeling down. Where was he going? Who was that woman? Her voice sounded so familiar.

Emma returned home with these questions spinning in her mind, while Ethan was in a high-end bar, discussing business with Michael Young.

At the bar, Ethan found himself sitting next to a woman in a tight-fitting dress, the same one from the phone call. She was trying to ply him with drinks, smearing lipstick on his collar as she did.

After a while, feeling slightly drunk, Ethan decided it was time to leave.

"Ethan, stay the night, will you?" the woman purred, pressing herself against him provocatively.

Feeling hot and aware that something was amiss with his drink, Ethan insisted, "Michael, let's reschedule. Sorry, I need to head home."

He stumbled out of the bar, hailed a cab, and made his way home.

"Whoa there, sir, you’ve had quite a bit to drink," Grace Gonzalez remarked as she helped Ethan to the door.

Ethan's arms flailed as he tried to steady himself. "Little Chen, help me upstairs," he mumbled.

Emma, who had just entered the living room from the backyard, saw Ethan in his disheveled state. "Drank that much, huh?"

"Little Chen, take him to the bedroom," Emma instructed, assisting in getting Ethan to his room.

"You can leave. I'll take care of him," Emma told the helper.

Once alone, as Emma reached to remove Ethan’s suit, he grabbed her wrist, muttering, "Get out of here."

Surprised, Emma looked at him. "You don’t want me to take care of you? Fine, I’ll go," she said, trying to pull away.

"Wait," Ethan whispered, pulling her into his arms.

Emma struggled to break free, his grip too tight, feeling a mix of annoyance and fear. "What are you doing?" she asked, a hint of apprehension in her voice.

Ethan gazed at her drunkenly, ignoring her protests. "Let go of me," Emma insisted, trying to wriggle free but to no avail.

"Ethan, you jerk, let go," Emma said, genuinely scared this time. He seemed drugged, not himself, barely conscious, unaffected by her words.

Eventually, he regained a bit of clarity, his eyes meeting Emma's tearful gaze. "I'm sorry," he murmured, full of guilt.

He turned over, pulling the blanket up to cover her, then lay on his side, watching her as she continued to cry silently, ignoring him completely.

Emma couldn't hear his apology. She was furious with this man who had married her for convenience, now seemingly costing her happiness.
