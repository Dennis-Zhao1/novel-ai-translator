Chapter 1: Rumors in the Air

The first ray of morning sunshine pierced through the window and gently woke Ethan Clark. He blinked a couple of times, taking in the sight of Emma Thomas sleeping peacefully beside him. He tenderly adjusted her blanket and watched her serene face, her hair splayed out on the pillow. He couldn’t resist the urge to lightly brush her cheek, noting her slightly swollen lips.

“Awake?” he whispered as Emma stirred and slowly opened her eyes.

Emma was momentarily startled but quickly recalled the events of the previous night. She nodded, feeling a little awkward but not regretful.

“I’m getting up,” Ethan announced, tossing the blanket aside as he climbed out of bed.

Emma stretched lazily, glancing out the window at the bright sun before she, too, got out of bed.

“Rise and shine! Come have some breakfast,” Grandma called from the kitchen, her voice warm and inviting.

“Grandma, I’ll head back in a bit. I’ve got classes this afternoon,” Emma replied, munching on a slice of toast.

“Eat up and then you two can head back. Come visit Grandma again soon, alright?” Grandma said, a hint of sadness in her voice.

“We’ll be back after Emma graduates,” Ethan reassured her, exchanging a glance with Emma.

After breakfast, they said their goodbyes and hit the road, driving back to the city. An hour later, they arrived.

“Heading straight to school?” Ethan asked, glancing at Emma.

Emma hesitated. “Both you and the car are way too flashy. If I show up like this, everyone will start talking.”

“We’re legit,” Ethan replied with a grin, steering the car towards the campus anyway.

“My classmates don’t know yet. They just think you’re my boyfriend,” Emma explained, a little flustered.

“Wanna get dropped off a little early?” Emma suggested nervously.

Ethan didn’t oblige, pulling right up to the school entrance instead. As they arrived, whispers started circulating among the students:

“Whoa, is that a Maybach? The guy must be loaded.”

“He looks like some rich kid.”

“That’s Emma Thomas from computer science, right?”

“She’s probably being kept by some rich guy.”

Emma overheard the gossip and felt a pang of embarrassment. Ethan, unfazed, got out and walked around to open her door.

“Just go,” Emma muttered as she got out.

Ethan leaned in close, whispering in her ear, “So you’re just going to take that ‘kept woman’ comment lying down?”

“Whatever,” Emma replied, rolling her eyes as she headed towards the school gates.

As she walked away, her phone buzzed with a new text: “I’ll come pick you up after class.”

Emma glanced back at Ethan, still by the car, then continued on her way.

“Did you see that guy at the gate?”

“Looks like she’s totally being kept.”

Emma tried to ignore the murmurs as she made her way down the quiet path to her class.

“Emma, over here!” Sophia Wright called out once Emma entered the classroom.

Emma joined Sophia, but soon after, the school’s queen bee, Chloe Wang, approached. “No wonder you’re ignoring James Campbell. You’ve clearly found someone better.”

Laughter erupted around the room, but Emma kept her composure. She stood up and said, “James and I are just friends. That was my boyfriend who dropped me off.”

“Boyfriend?” came the skeptical voices.

Sophia chimed in to support her, “Seriously, Lin and I have both met him. He’s Emma’s boyfriend.”

“Sure, you call him your boyfriend, but maybe he’s just toying with you,” Chloe scoffed.

“What’s it to you anyway?” Emma snapped back, tired of Chloe’s attitude.

“Just wait,” Chloe smirked, heading back to her seat.

After class, Emma and Sophia were on their way to the next lecture when a familiar voice called out to Emma.

“Emma.”

She turned to see James Campbell standing there with a book in hand.

“I need to talk to you,” he stammered.

Sophia caught the cue and excused herself, “Emma, I’ll grab some water. See you in class.”

Left alone, James finally spoke up, “Emma, was that guy really your husband?”

Emma hesitated, knowing she couldn’t keep it a secret any longer. “James, I married for other reasons. Can you keep it between us?”

“Do we still have a chance?” James asked, a flicker of hope in his eyes.

“Sorry, James. I’m married now,” Emma replied quietly.

James, still in denial, insisted, “I can wait. I know this isn’t what you really want. Emma, I like you.”

Emma stopped, feeling conflicted. “I think I’ve made myself clear,” she said before hurrying away.

James stood there, watching her leave, while Chloe observed the whole scene from a distance.

“Why her?” Chloe fumed. “Emma Thomas, you’ll pay for this.”

Emma rushed to her next class, just making it on time.

After class, as she stepped outside, she spotted the conspicuous Maybach again. Ethan was already out, opening the door for her.

“Get in,” he said, shielding her from the curious eyes around them.

“What’s wrong?” Ethan asked, noticing her silence and the troubled look on her face.

Emma stayed quiet.

“Did someone give you a hard time?” Ethan pressed gently.

“It’s nothing,” Emma finally replied.

Ethan wasn’t convinced. “Is it about those ‘kept woman’ rumors?”

Emma shot him a glance, confirming his suspicion. “Don’t worry about them. If it really bothers you, I’ll take care of it.”

“Maybe you shouldn’t drive me tomorrow,” Emma suggested awkwardly.

Ethan looked at her, “If you don’t want to hear rumors, why not just tell them the truth?”

“No, graduation’s around the corner. I’d rather they not know,” Emma quickly countered.

“Alright then,” Ethan said, focusing back on the road.

Emma’s phone buzzed in her bag, breaking the tension.

“Hey, Sophia,” Emma answered, her eyes widening at the news. “What?”

She hung up and clicked the link Sophia had sent. The school’s forum was abuzz with a post titled: “Computer Science’s Emma Thomas Kept by Rich Guy.”

It was filled with pictures of her and Ethan at the school gate, along with snide comments.

“1. She must be a side piece.
2. Totally kept. I saw it at lunch.
3. How could someone so pretty stoop to being a kept woman?”

Emma, infuriated, tossed her phone back into her bag.

Ethan noticed her distress and pulled over to ask what was wrong.
