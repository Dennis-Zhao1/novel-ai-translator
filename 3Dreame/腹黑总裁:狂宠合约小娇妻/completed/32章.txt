Sneaking Out for an Interview

The next morning, a ray of sunshine peeked through the bedroom window, hitting Emma Thomas right in the eyes. She slowly opened them, stretched lazily, and turned over to find that Ethan Clark wasn’t there. "Did he head out already?" she wondered.

Emma quickly got up and dashed downstairs. She found Grace Gonzalez in the kitchen, busy making breakfast. Emma tiptoed over and whispered, "Grace, where's Ethan?"

"Ma'am, he’s in the backyard reading," Grace replied, not missing a beat as she continued cooking.

Emma glanced out the kitchen window, spotting Ethan’s familiar silhouette sitting outside. With a sigh, she headed back upstairs to freshen up. A while later, she came down for breakfast.

“I won’t be home for lunch or dinner today. Be good while I’m out,” Ethan said warmly at the table, looking at Emma with a gentle smile.

Emma felt a spark of excitement but kept her expression neutral. "Okay," she replied nonchalantly.

“You could do some painting or hit the gym today.” He spread some tomato jam on a slice of bread and set it on her plate.

"Sure," Emma muttered, feeling a bit guilty as she picked up the bread.

“Take your time eating. I’m off now,” Ethan said, leaving his breakfast unfinished as he headed back to the bedroom.

Ethan returned with his briefcase, ready to leave. At that moment, Emma was savoring her meal.

“This is your painting. I made some tweaks. If you’re bored, you can finish the parts I didn’t get to.” He handed her a canvas.

Emma took the painting, about to say something, but Ethan was already making his exit.

"This is my painting… the one I messed up with paint. Wasn't it in the scrap bin? How did he... Oh, he turned the smudge into something new. Not bad," she thought, admiring his work.

With the painting in hand, she watched Ethan’s car pull away, then dashed upstairs with it.

“Grace, I’m going to paint upstairs. No need to clean up here,” she called out.

Once upstairs, Emma grabbed her backpack and headed to the study. She powered up her laptop, noting it was just after 9 a.m.

“Perfect timing to send out resumes,” she mumbled, quickly submitting applications to several companies. She closed her laptop and looked at the painting, deciding to add the finishing touches Ethan had suggested. Once done, it was hard to tell it had been a collaboration.

"He's quite talented," Emma mused, appreciating Ethan’s work before a vibrating phone interrupted her thoughts.

"Hello?"

"Hi, is this Emma Thomas?" a sweet voice asked on the other end.

"Yes, who’s this?"

After a short conversation, Emma hung up and jumped up in excitement.

"Yes! Finally, an interview," she cheered, humming a tune as she grabbed a glass of water. "This is great."

"It's 10:30 now, and the interview’s at 2. I need to leave by 1. How am I going to get out of here?" Her excitement dimmed slightly as she pondered a plan.

"I know! I’ll say I’m visiting Ethan. Grace will definitely let me out for that." Emma grinned, feeling clever with her plan.

"There's still time. I should prep a bit." She sat down, reviewing her resume details to improve her chances.

Time flew by, and soon there was a knock at the study door. "Ma'am, lunch is ready."

Emma glanced at the clock—it was almost noon. She closed her laptop, realizing she needed to print her resume too. "Oops, I need to print this. Leaving at 1 might be too late. Better hurry."

She closed her laptop, grabbed a flash drive, and headed downstairs for lunch.

“Ma'am, Mr. Clark specifically requested a cool meal for you today since it’s hot outside,” Grace said, bringing out a series of dishes.

“Here’s my chance,” Emma thought, jumping on the mention of Ethan. “Grace, it’s so hot today. I bet Ethan would appreciate a home-cooked meal. I’ll bring it to him after lunch.”

“Let John do it; it’s too hot for you to go out,” Grace suggested.

“It’s just a little gesture of love," Emma said, flashing a smile at Grace.

“I promise I’m just going to Ethan’s office and nowhere else,” Emma continued, trying to reassure her.

“Well…” Grace hesitated, glancing at Emma.

“How about this—let John drive me there,” Emma proposed.

“Alright, I’ll pack the meal,” Grace said, heading back to the kitchen.

Emma ate quickly, her mind racing with plans to slip away. She checked the time—it was already 12:30. "John will take me to Ethan’s office, and then I'll find a way to sneak off. No time to waste," she thought, setting her chopsticks down.

“Grace, is it ready?” she called, urging Grace to hurry.

“Are you done already?” Grace asked, surprised as she handed Emma the packed meal.

“Yep, I’m off to deliver this,” Emma said, grabbing the container and heading out.

A short while later, John pulled up outside Clark Group. “Ma'am, we’re here.”

Emma looked up at the imposing sign: "Clark Group." Even the branch offices were impressive.

“John, you can head back. I’ll return with Ethan,” Emma said, stepping out and heading toward the lobby.

As she entered, she saw through the glass that John’s car was driving away. She quickly moved to the side and called for a ride on her phone.

“For Ethan Clark,” she said, handing the meal to the receptionist at the front desk before rushing off.

“Hey!” the receptionist called out, but Emma was already gone.

“Driver, to Mount Ann Building, please,” she instructed as she got into the waiting car.

“Driver, I’m in a rush. Is there a place to print along the way?” Emma realized she still needed her resume printed.

Seeing her urgency, the driver picked up the pace. “Take a right up ahead; there’s a shop.”

“Please drop me there,” Emma requested.

“I’ll wait at the entrance. I’ll give you extra for your time,” Emma assured the driver as she hurried to print her resumes.

Back in the car, the driver asked, “Heading to an interview, huh?”

“Yep,” Emma replied.

“No wonder you’re in such a hurry,” he joked. Before long, they arrived at her destination.

Emma hopped out and made her way to the lobby, where she filled out a form and joined the others waiting for their interviews.
