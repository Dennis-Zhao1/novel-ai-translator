From a Young Age

"Alright, alright, I'm sure Mom has her reasons. Let's just eat, okay?" Aunt Liz tried to ease the awkward tension hanging over the room.

"Grandma, I'm sorry," my older brother, Mark, realized his mistake and apologized to Grandma in front of everyone.

"Grandma, try this," Ethan Clark said as he picked up a piece of stuffed lotus and placed it in Grandma's bowl.

Grandma sighed deeply and looked over the table of food, speaking slowly, "I've always divided the portions based on the number of people. Last time, Ethan and his family got less, so this time they should get more."

"Grandma, are you saying you divide by headcount?" Charlotte Jones asked curiously from the side.

"Then what about the fact that I'm carrying a Clark family child in my belly? Shouldn't my child and I get two shares?" Charlotte Jones patted her stomach, trying to gain sympathy from Grandma, who was visibly upset.

"Yeah, Mom, Charlotte's carrying my brother's child; they should get an extra share too," Aunt Liz chimed in, trying to smooth things over.

"The child in your belly is a Clark, that I recognize, but you, I do not," Grandma said firmly, setting down her chopsticks.

"Grandma, you..." Charlotte Jones started to get up, but Uncle Rick held her back.

"I got it, Mom," Uncle Rick said soothingly, pulling Charlotte back to her seat.

Emma Thomas watched the drama unfold, amazed at how chaotic things could get in a wealthy family. On the surface, everyone seemed to be all smiles and politeness, but when it came to dividing up the inheritance, their true colors showed.

After dinner, everyone gradually left. Just as Ethan Clark was about to leave with Emma Thomas, Grandma called them back, "Ethan, Emma, wait a moment."

"Come, sit down," Grandma gestured for them to sit.

"Your grandfather misunderstood the situation back then and wrongly accused your father. Today, I want to make amends on his behalf," Grandma sighed, holding Ethan's hand.

"Grandma, the past is past. Let's just leave it behind," Ethan comforted his remorseful grandmother.

"I'm getting old, and I just hope that after I'm gone, this family stays together," Grandma said softly.

"It will, don't worry," Ethan reassured her.

"I hope so. By the way, Emma, how are you finding everything here today? Do you like the food?" Grandma asked kindly.

Emma smiled, "Grandma, I love it here, and the food is great. Ethan even showed me around the house today." She leaned closer to Ethan as she spoke.

"That's good to hear. Ethan, make sure you take good care of Emma," Grandma said, looking pleased.

"I will, Grandma," Ethan replied affectionately.

"Emma, if you need anything, just let us know, okay?" Grandma continued to give her advice.

"I will, Grandma," Emma responded sweetly.

"Alright, you two go on. I need some rest too," Grandma waved them off with a smile and left the dining area herself.

Ethan wrapped his arm around Emma as they walked outside. Once they stepped out, Emma asked quietly, "What was all that about at dinner with the inheritance? What was Grandma talking about?"

"It's nothing. These kinds of things are common in rich families. We just need to focus on living our lives," Ethan whispered back, trying to reassure her.

Emma looked at him curiously, "Grandma seems to like you a lot."

Ethan smiled down at her, "Maybe it's because she likes you, so she likes me by association."

"Likes me?" Emma was surprised.

"Yeah," Ethan said casually. "Grandma said when she was living in Oak Town, your mom was her goddaughter. You used to visit her a lot when you were little."

"Goddaughter? When I was little? How come I don't remember that?" Emma was puzzled.

"You were really young. Grandma mentioned that you had a high fever when you were four, and your memories before that are fuzzy. Also, no one else knows about this," Ethan explained.

"Now that you mention it, I kind of remember. My mom did take me to a place often," Emma said, piecing things together.

"So I have another identity: Grandma Clark's god-granddaughter. I guess my status just shot up," Emma joked, incredulous.

"Let's keep this to ourselves for now. If Mark finds out, it might put Grandma in a tough spot," Ethan said quietly.

"Okay," Emma nodded, then asked, "Why did Grandma tell you?"

"Wait, did Grandma suggest our marriage?" Emma paused and looked up at Ethan.

"Originally, my parents wanted to pair me with someone from the Jones family, but then Grandma called and told me all this," Ethan explained.

"So you agreed to marry me because it would benefit you more?" Emma asked, feeling a bit down.

"Grandma told me we were engaged when we were kids. Only she and your mother knew," Ethan shook his head, looking serious.

"Engaged?" Emma was astonished. Ethan chuckled, "Yeah, maybe it's destiny."

"I don't believe it," Emma said skeptically.

"Don't you have a silver bracelet?" Ethan asked.

Emma paused, "Most girls do, don't they?" Ethan continued, "Yours has a red bead with the word 'Tong' engraved, right?"

"Yes," Emma said, finally convinced.

"That's the engagement gift from Grandma," Ethan explained.

"I see," Emma thought aloud, just as she was about to say more, Ethan urged, "Let's go."

He led Emma back to their quarters.

Meanwhile, Charlotte Jones returned to her room, only to hear a knock at the door just as she sat down.

"Who is it?" Charlotte asked as someone opened the door, revealing Aunt Liz.

"Sister-in-law, it's me," Aunt Liz walked in cheerfully.

"What are you doing here?" Charlotte asked, surprised, motioning for the door to be closed.

"You saw what happened today. If you don't act soon, you won't last in this family."

"What do you suggest?" Charlotte asked, sipping her water calmly.

"Well, since you can't keep the baby, you might as well use the situation to your advantage."

"Do you think I'm stupid? If I lose this baby, I won't last a day here. It doesn't benefit me," Charlotte replied coolly.

"I'll give you a share of what I get," Aunt Liz offered.

"Ha, you think you can buy me off with just that?" Charlotte laughed.

"Don't forget, Grandma still has the Tang Corporation she brought as a dowry," Aunt Liz reminded her.

Charlotte paused, setting her cup down, "Two shares," she countered, her eyes sharp.
