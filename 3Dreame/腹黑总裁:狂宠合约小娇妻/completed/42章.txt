"Hey, wanna grab a bite?" Emma Thomas turned around to see Ethan Clark and John heading their way, with a casual pace that suggested they'd just enjoyed a leisurely stroll.

"How'd you get here so fast?" Emma asked in surprise, holding a skewer of beef kebabs.

"I just knocked on her door, it's not far from here," Ethan replied, eyeing the spread of food on the table.

"Why don't we join in, Ethan?" John said, already finding himself a seat as he eyed the barbecue with interest.

"I..." Ethan started to protest but stopped short.

"Wanna grab a bite?" Emma asked again, a bit awkwardly, expecting a refusal. To her surprise, Ethan grabbed a chair and sat down.

He glanced at the food with a hint of reluctance, but seeing everyone else enjoying it so much, he felt a twinge of curiosity.

"Yeah, come on, dig in," Sophia Wright encouraged Ethan, nodding towards the skewers.

"Try it," Emma said, noticing Ethan's hesitation and handing him a beef skewer.

Ethan looked at her, took the skewer, and cautiously took a bite. Slowly, his expression softened as the flavor sunk in.

"How is it, Ethan? Good, right?" John asked, savoring his own skewer.

"What do you think?" Emma turned to Ethan, curious.

"It's alright," Ethan replied nonchalantly, taking a swig from a soda.

"See? This place is really good," Emma said, picking up a shrimp skewer before Ethan interrupted her, "Hold on."

Emma looked at him, puzzled, "What is it?"

Ethan gently took the shrimp from her, peeled it, and handed it back.

Embarrassed, Emma accepted the shrimp with a shy smile, taking a bite.

"You really spoil Emma," Sophia teased, watching them with a grin.

Flustered, Emma retaliated by placing a chicken wing in front of Sophia, "Here, eat up."

Sophia laughed and obliged, munching on the wing.

"Hey, Sophia, how's the job hunt going?" Emma asked between bites.

Sophia's face fell, "Ugh, I've applied to so many places with no luck. I'll try again on Monday," she said, sipping her Sprite.

"Don't worry, you're a top grad, finding a receptionist job should be easy," Emma reassured her.

Ethan, overhearing, put down his skewer and turned to Sophia, "Our company needs a receptionist. If you're interested, you could start with us."

Emma looked at Ethan in surprise, "You mean at Clark Group?"

"Yeah," Ethan nodded subtly.

Emma looked excitedly at Sophia, "Sophia, would you be interested?"

"Of course! Can I really?" Sophia asked, incredulous.

"Our branch just opened, and while most positions are filled, we still need a receptionist. I've seen your communication skills today, and I think you'd be a great fit," Ethan explained, picking up another skewer.

Emma couldn't help but laugh at Ethan, who was now eating more skewers than she was.

"If you join, your salary will match what's on the job listings. I'll inform HR, and you can start at 9 AM on Monday," Ethan added casually.

"That's awesome, Sophia," Emma cheered, glancing at Sophia.

"Thanks," Sophia raised her Sprite in gratitude.

"You'll be colleagues now," Ethan murmured to Emma, who sat beside him.

"Colleagues?" Sophia exclaimed, "Emma, you work there too?"

"Yep," Emma nodded.

"That's great, we can be together again," Sophia beamed as they all raised their drinks for a toast.

After a while, they drove Sophia home, and John drove them back. The car was quiet, and Emma glanced at Ethan, softly saying, "Thank you."

Ethan adjusted in his seat, replying, "She deserves it."

Just as Emma was about to speak, Ethan interjected, "We'll be heading to Greenfield to visit Grandma tomorrow. She's been asking about us."

"Grandma's place? So we won't be working on Monday?" Emma asked curiously.

"We'll go when we get back," Ethan said, looking out the window. Emma sensed he had something on his mind but decided not to press him.

"Grandma's house is a bit complex. My uncle's family lives there, including a cousin who's married with a three-year-old, and my aunt with her kid. Plus, my younger uncle's family. It's a big household," Ethan explained.

"My cousin's marriage isn't great; he lives with another woman in a separate part of the house. Grandma likes everyone to have breakfast together at 6 AM," Ethan continued.

"What should I prepare?" Emma asked, glancing at her phone, feeling unsure about meeting his extended family.

"I had Grace Gonzalez prepare gifts for everyone. I'll remind you when it's time. We'll leave early in the morning," Ethan reassured Emma, sensing her nerves.

Holding her hand, he gently comforted her, "If you don't want to go, I can decline."

Emma turned to him, determined, "We're married now, we have to face these things. Besides, we have our contract to fulfill."

Realizing John was driving, Emma quickly added, "Remember, our contract says no secrets between us?"

She glanced at Ethan, signaling him about John's presence. Ethan, quick on the uptake, nodded.

"Don't worry, I'm here," Ethan said, holding her hand.

Emma relaxed slightly, hugging herself, "Okay," she said, eyes on the road ahead.

Emma was relieved she covered up in time. If news about their contract got out, it could spell trouble with Chairman Xu, and her company, Thomas Group, might end up under Clark's control.

Finally, they reached the gates of their neighborhood, and the two got out of the car and headed home.
