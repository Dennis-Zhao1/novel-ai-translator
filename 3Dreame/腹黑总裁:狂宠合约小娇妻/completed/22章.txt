Graduation Defense

Emma Thomas finished her lunch, grabbed her laptop, and headed to the library to prep for her graduation defense. She was constantly editing and re-editing her presentation, never quite satisfied with the result. Her phone buzzed, and she pulled it out to see who was calling. The caller ID read "Demon."

She stepped into the break room and answered quietly, "Hello?"

"Hey," Ethan Clark replied, sensing something was off in her voice. "Where are you?"

"In the library," Emma whispered back.

"I’m afraid I won’t make it back tomorrow either. Be good at home," Ethan said softly, adding a touch of affection. He probably didn’t realize how much he cared for her, always considering her feelings.

"I'm busy. You don't need to call if there's nothing important," Emma snapped, feeling the pressure.

Ethan picked up on her anxiety, "What’s wrong?"

Emma hesitated, debating whether to tell him, but finally decided to, "I’m preparing for my graduation defense."

Ethan immediately offered comfort, "Need my help?"

Emma thought for a moment, "You’ve been out of school for a while. Do you even remember how to do this?"

"Besides, you weren’t even in my major," Emma mumbled, though Ethan could still hear her over the phone.

"I have resources," he stated confidently.

Emma relaxed a bit, considering his offer. "But you can’t come back right now."

"We’ll do it remotely tonight," Ethan suggested before hanging up.

Emma was a bit stunned but returned to her library desk, pondering Ethan’s words. "Remote help? He’s not in my major, so who’s going to guide me?"

"Never mind, I’ll sort it out myself first," Emma decided, refocusing on her defense document.

After class in the afternoon, Emma walked out of the campus gate and found William Jones waiting for her. She greeted him and got into his car, fastening her seatbelt as they drove off.

"William, what was your major in college?" Emma asked, breaking the silence.

"I was in the management department at Greenwood University."

"And Henry Baker?"

"He was in the same major as Ethan Clark, finance."

"Ethan’s in finance too?" Emma thought, realizing the vast difference from her computer science defense.

"Yeah, but he also studied computer science. He graduated with a double major."

What? Emma was floored—a double major, and a top student no less.

William, noticing her shock, added, "And he maintained the top spot in the finance department for all four years."

He chuckled, focusing back on the road.

"A double major? Top grades for four years? Handsome and a rich kid? Seems pretty perfect," Emma mused.

"But he’s so serious and cunning. If he were more cheerful, he’d be really popular," Emma commented, looking at William.

"Are you kidding? You don’t know how popular he is at his company?" William was surprised at her ignorance.

Emma realized her mistake. Of course, someone like Ethan would be admired in school too.

"But seriously," William joked, "Once you get to Greenwood, keep an eye on him. Lots of people are trying to get into the family."

"Though he’s turned them all down," William laughed.

Emma smiled politely.

Later that night, around nine, Emma, freshly showered, sat down with her laptop in the study. She diligently worked on her defense document when her phone rang.

"Hey," she answered.

"Are you still up?" Ethan’s caring voice came through.

"Still working on the defense?" he asked cautiously.

"Yeah."

"Open the remote access software, and I’ll take a look," Ethan suggested gently.

"Aren’t you busy? I can manage," Emma hesitated, not wanting to disrupt his work.

"Not right now. You don’t have to handle everything alone. Otherwise, what’s the point of having a husband?"

Emma found a bit of truth in his words and slowly replied, "Okay, I’ve opened it. I sent you a screenshot; can you see it?"

"Got it."

"Is this the right one?" Ethan started reviewing her document remotely.

"Yeah."

Ethan scrolled to the top and began meticulously analyzing, highlighting errors in red.

"You missed this," he pointed out a glaring mistake, making Emma cringe, "I was too tired that day and misread it."

"Go on," she said, sipping water as he continued guiding her.

"This answer could confuse your professor," Ethan noted, highlighting another issue and smoothly rephrasing the content. Emma was impressed by his quick, insightful edits—clearly, a top student.

Ethan continued through the document, finally reaching the last page, "Not many issues left."

"But your formatting needs work. I’ll fix one, and you can adjust the rest based on it," Ethan offered, returning to the first page.

"Okay," Emma replied, sleepiness creeping in.

Ethan noticed the change in her tone, glanced at the clock—it was past midnight.

"Are you tired?" he asked gently.

"A bit," Emma yawned, rubbing her eyes.

After a few minutes, Ethan finished, disconnecting the remote access.

Emma breathed a sigh of relief, seeing the revised document. She picked up the phone, "Thank you."

"No need to thank your husband," Ethan teased.

Emma blushed, speechless. Ethan, sensing the silence, added, "It’s late; you should sleep." Then he mentioned, "William will drive you to school tomorrow."

"No need to trouble him; I can go myself," Emma said, a bit embarrassed.

"I’d rather not take chances," Ethan replied, a hint of concern in his voice.

"I’m not a kid. I’m in my twenties, about to step into the real world," Emma retorted, her pride making Ethan chuckle.

"You’re a kid in my eyes," Ethan asserted before adding, "You should get some rest."

"Okay," Emma agreed, about to hang up when Ethan softly said, "Goodnight, my dear."

She paused, then hung up, glanced at the clock—it was almost 12:30. Stretching in her chair, she felt a sense of accomplishment.

She left the study, turned off the lights, and headed to her bedroom.
