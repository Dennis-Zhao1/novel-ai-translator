Title: Tea Time Drama

---

Emma Thomas was nervously fidgeting with her shirt as she stood beside Sophia Wright. They were in the office hallway, and Sophia had just politely greeted Ethan Clark as he walked past them. Sophia gave Emma a gentle nudge, signaling her to say hello too.

"Uh, hi, Ethan Clark," Emma mumbled, keeping her eyes fixed on the floor. She didn't dare make eye contact, but Ethan's peripheral vision picked up her timid posture as he continued into the meeting room.

Sophia and Emma let out a collective sigh as soon as Ethan was out of sight. "Come on, Emma, let's go," Sophia said, leading her away from the scene.

Emma returned to her desk, which was conveniently located next to Ethan's empty office. She stared at his barren workspace, wondering where Lily Lewis had disappeared to since she hadn't seen her earlier.

Moments later, Lily returned, escorting a client into Ethan's office. "Mr. Wang, please have a seat. Ethan Clark is currently in a meeting. He'll join you shortly," she said with a warm smile.

Lily then turned to Emma, "Hey, can you go upstairs and let Ethan know that Mr. Wang has arrived?"

"Now?" Emma was taken aback. She had just started her first day, and they already had her running errands.

"Yep, hurry up," Lily responded before disappearing back into Ethan's office.

Emma hesitated, unsure how to approach Ethan. Should she just knock and walk into the meeting room? After a moment's contemplation, she decided to go for it.

Standing outside the meeting room, she heard a jumble of voices through the door. The discussion sounded intense, indicating the meeting was in full swing. Emma paced back and forth, anxiety gnawing at her.

Screw it. She knocked lightly and cracked the door open. The meeting host turned towards her, curiosity etched on their face. "Yes?"

"Uh, I'm here for Ethan Clark," Emma stammered, scanning the room until her eyes landed on Ethan.

Ethan, engrossed in his documents, looked up, recognizing Emma's voice. "I'll step out for a moment," he announced, grabbing his phone as he exited the room.

Back in the meeting room, murmurs erupted. "Who's that?" one voice asked.

"She's the new assistant from this morning," another replied.

"Oh, I thought she was Ethan's girlfriend," someone quipped.

"Me too. She's quite the looker," another agreed.

Outside the meeting room, Ethan approached Emma, concern in his eyes. "What's up?" he asked gently, almost reaching out to steady her before she stepped back.

"Remember, we're at work," Emma reminded, glancing around to ensure no one noticed their interaction.

Clearing his throat, Ethan asked, "What did you need?"

"Mr. Wang is here and waiting in your office," she relayed, relieved to have completed her task.

"Let's go," Ethan said, motioning for her to follow as they headed to the elevator.

"How's your first day going?" Ethan inquired as they stood in the elevator, trying to bridge the gap between them.

Emma maintained a professional distance, wary of others discovering their connection. "It's been good. Not too busy," she replied.

Their conversation was cut short as the elevator doors opened to reveal two colleagues. "Hi, Ethan Clark," they greeted, and Ethan nodded in acknowledgment before stepping out.

In his office, Ethan greeted Mr. Wang warmly, shaking his hand and glancing at the coffee cup in Wang's hand, then at Lily. "Mr. Wang deserves some of our finest tea," Ethan suggested.

"My bad," Lily chimed in. "I should've thought of that."

"Don't worry, Ethan. I'm a coffee fan," Mr. Wang laughed.

"Well, I've got some excellent tea here. You should try it," Ethan insisted politely.

"Alright, I'm game."

Lily beckoned Emma into the office. "Brew some of our special tea for Mr. Wang," she instructed.

Emma, unsure which tea was which, hesitated until Lily pointed out the right container. Feeling slightly out of place, Emma prepared the tea and brought it over to the guests.

Lily took the tray from Emma, serving Mr. Wang and Ethan. "Please, enjoy."

Mr. Wang sipped the tea, nodding in approval. "This is excellent."

"I'm glad you like it," Lily beamed.

Ethan, sipping his tea, couldn't resist a smile as he glanced at Emma. "You've got a knack for making tea," he complimented her.

Emma blushed slightly, responding, "It's your tea that's exceptional, Ethan."

"Your team is top-notch, Ethan," Mr. Wang remarked, setting his cup down.

"Thanks for your help," Lily said to Emma, dismissing her.

Finally out of the office, Emma exhaled deeply. The corporate world was more intricate than she'd anticipated.
