Ethan Clark was determined to marry Emma Thomas, and he wasn't going to let anyone change his mind. In the towering office building, a middle-aged man wearing glasses sat behind a desk, looking quite serious. Next to him, a tall, lanky assistant named Lin Shu offered a freshly brewed cup of premium tea.

"Where's Ethan now?" Samuel Clark asked, taking a sip of tea to calm his nerves.

"He's on his way here," Lin reassured him. "Why don't you enjoy the tea for now?"

Just then, there was a knock on the door. "Dad, you wanted to see me?" said Ethan as he entered. Standing at an impressive 6'4", Ethan wore a sharp black suit and carried himself with confidence. His well-groomed dark hair and deep-set eyes made him look every bit the part of a leading man.

Samuel gestured for Ethan to sit on the sofa. "Ethan, I hear you're planning to marry Oliver Thomas's daughter?" he asked directly, wasting no time.

Ethan had anticipated this conversation. "Yes, Dad. I was going to tell you. I've seen her. She's beautiful and seems kind and gentle," he said, grabbing a bottle of water from a nearby cabinet.

"The Thomas Group is already a business partner, and they're facing some financial issues. You've always told me to strengthen our ties where possible."

"Is it really just about business, Ethan?" Samuel questioned, raising an eyebrow.

"Dad, you want to hand over the company to me, right? The board is watching my every move; I need to prove myself. Besides, in Woodsville, we could use Thomas Group's connections to expand faster. It's a win-win."

Samuel nodded approvingly. "I'm glad you're thinking this through. But are you sure about marrying someone you haven't met properly?"

Ethan flashed a confident smile. "I'll be meeting her this weekend when I visit Oliver Thomas. It'll be fine."

Just as Samuel was about to speak, a tall woman in a blue dress walked in. It was Ethan's mother, Grace Clark, and she was not pleased. "I don't agree with this!" she announced.

"Mom, what are you doing here?" Ethan asked, surprised.

"I heard my son is planning to marry someone from the Thomas family without even consulting us!" Grace exclaimed, clearly upset.

Ethan knew his mother had always hoped he'd marry Lily Jones, a family friend. But the benefits of aligning with the Thomas Group outweighed that with the Jones family, especially since he'd always seen Lily as a sister, nothing more.

"Grace, Ethan has explained his reasoning," Samuel chimed in, trying to calm her down. "We've met Oliver Thomas's daughter when she was little, remember? She was lovely."

"But I've always imagined Lily as my daughter-in-law. She's perfect for Ethan!" Grace protested, her voice full of urgency.

Ethan looked at his mother sincerely. "Mom, I know you want the best for me, but I've never had feelings for Lily beyond friendship. I don't want to stand in the way of her happiness."

Grace sighed, seeing the determination in Ethan's eyes. "You grew up together. She's always liked you. And I've already talked about this with her family."

"That's exactly why I want her to find her own happiness," Ethan replied gently.

Grace's expression softened, though tears glistened in her eyes. She understood that in their world, marriages were often strategic alliances. "Ethan, whatever your reasons, treat your future wife well. You're a team now," she said, conceding to her son's decision.

With that, Grace left the room, and Samuel followed, leaving Ethan alone. He knew his choice might be questioned, but his resolve was firm. As the sole heir, he couldn't let the Clark Group fall into others' hands. He had to grow stronger.

Ethan sat for a while, contemplating his next move. He checked his watch and got up to leave.

"Where to next, Ethan?" Daniel Johnson, his assistant, called from the car.

"Back to the apartment," Ethan replied, and they drove off. At the apartment, Ethan picked up a well-crafted gift box and a scroll paintingâ€”presents for his visit to Oliver Thomas.

"Let's head to the Woodsville Hotel," Ethan directed once back in the car.

"Are you taking over now?" Daniel asked casually.

"Just drive," Ethan replied, evading the question. Daniel noticed Ethan's serious expression in the mirror and decided not to press further.

After a few more hours on the road, they arrived. Daniel checked them in while Ethan relaxed, scrolling through his phone.

"All set," Daniel said, handing Ethan the room key. "I'll take you up."

"No need. I'm good," Ethan said, taking his luggage and heading to the elevator.

"Call me if you need anything," Daniel said before leaving.

Ethan found his room and, after a long shower to shake off the travel fatigue, changed into casual clothes. He felt lighter, almost like a college student again, ready to explore.

With a quick glance at his phone, he headed out to grab a bite, leaving the hotel with renewed determination for the days ahead.
