In a cozy little restaurant, Ethan Clark was catching up with his old friend Michael Young. "Hey, Michael, glad you could make it," Ethan greeted, rising to shake his hand. "Emma Thomas, meet Michael Young."

"Nice to meet you, Michael," Emma said, smiling politely as she stood up to greet him.

Michael gave Emma a once-over, his eyes lighting up with admiration. "Ethan, you're one lucky guy. Your wife is absolutely stunning."

"Absolutely," chimed in a nearby girl, her voice dripping with irony. "It's really unfair for us mere mortals who don't have such perfect faces or figures."

Emma blushed a little, clearly flattered yet slightly embarrassed by the attention. Ethan quickly shifted the conversation, asking Michael, "Are you guys here for dinner too?"

The girl, with a touch of sarcasm, replied, "We've already eaten."

Emma found herself curious about this girl. She seemed awfully candid, even in front of Ethan and Michael. Who was she? She didn't look like Michael's wife.

Michael soon excused himself, "Ethan, enjoy your dinner. I'll catch you later." The girl cast a longing glance at Ethan and whispered, "Goodbye," before following Michael out.

Emma watched them leave, her curiosity piqued. She glanced at Ethan, who, knowing he couldn't keep anything from her, decided to come clean.

"Michael's the guy who helped me secure a deal with the Thomas Group," Ethan admitted, noticing Emma's intrigued expression. "When I first arrived here, Michael wanted to strike a partnership with my father. He approached me, and although I didn't want to get involved, I knew it was crucial not to upset him. Otherwise, the Clark Group would struggle to establish itself here."

"So, I agreed to facilitate the partnership. In return, I asked for shares in the Thomas Group. We ended up spending a lot of time together, and he introduced me to some clients."

Ethan looked earnestly at Emma, like a husband explaining why he was late coming home.

Emma couldn't help but smile at Ethan's earnestness. "Why are you smiling?" Ethan asked, puzzled. He had been so nervous about explaining everything to her, and here she was, smiling.

"I don't know much about business," Emma replied, still smiling. "All I know is that networking and client meetings are standard, so you don't have to explain every detail."

She took a sip of her orange juice and looked at her steak, casually asking, "And that girl..."

Ethan, not waiting for her to finish, jumped in, "She's the intermediary for Michael and me. She helped broker one of our projects, and Michael often brings her to meetings."

"And..." Ethan hesitated, glancing at Emma, who was now focused on her meal.

Emma raised an eyebrow, curious about what more he had to confess. "What's up?"

"The lipstick stain on my shirt... it was hers," Ethan mustered the courage to admit, looking at her with sincere eyes. "But nothing happened between us."

"Why are you so nervous?" Emma asked, not surprised at all. She had already pieced it together.

"Most women don't like their partners getting too close to other women, so I wanted to assure you that nothing happened. It was just business."

Ethan's honesty was refreshing, though Emma had already suspected it. She recalled the time when there was something off about his drink, thinking it might have been her doing. She was clearly trying to take her place.

"Yeah, it can be bothersome," Emma said, looking up from her steak. "But don't worry about it."

Ethan felt a wave of relief. "If it bothers you, I won't work with her anymore."

Emma paused, fork in hand, and looked at Ethan. He was genuinely sincere. She chuckled, "I was just kidding. Business is important. Don't let me interfere with Clark Group's progress."

"Business used to be my priority, but now, you're what's most important," Ethan said earnestly. "Emma, I've married you, and I want to treasure you. I'll keep you safe, even from myself."

Emma felt a warmth spread through her, whether he was joking or not. She realized having someone to rely on wasn't so bad. She smiled and nodded, "Okay."

"Try this," Emma said, placing some food on Ethan's plate, and they continued their date with light-hearted banter.

"How about a movie after dinner?" Ethan suggested, looking at her warmly.

Emma thought for a moment and shook her head. "No good movies out today. Let's wait for a new release."

"Okay, your call."

"Want to go shopping instead?" Ethan ventured.

Emma almost choked on her orange juice. Shopping? That could be awkward, considering they didn't talk much when they were out. Plus, he was a busy guy. Where did he get the idea?

"Uh, I didn't plan to buy anything. Do you need to shop?" she asked, trying to politely decline.

"Just humor me. Consider it a favor," Ethan said with a hopeful grin.

"Alright," Emma agreed, unable to refuse him again.

"All done?" Ethan asked, noticing Emma had stopped eating.

"Yeah, I'm stuffed," she replied with a smile.

"Let's park the car here and walk. It'll help you digest," Ethan suggested after paying the bill.

"Sounds good. There's a mall about a mile from here," Emma pointed out, happy for the excuse to walk off her meal.

She realized that without regular exercise, she'd soon gain weight, something she wanted to avoid right after graduation.

"Let's go," Ethan said, taking her hand as they headed out.

"What's up?" Ethan asked, noticing Emma looking at their joined hands. His hand enveloped hers, offering a sense of security she hadn't felt in a while.

Emma felt a rush of comfort. It had been a while since she felt so safe, and today, she was savoring every bit of it.
