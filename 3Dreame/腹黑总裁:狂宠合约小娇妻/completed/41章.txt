Emma Thomas Secretly Enjoys Street Food

"Yeah, Emma Thomas, when I was checking out the apartment, I ran into my downstairs neighbor, Mr. Johnson. He works at the local police department," Sophia Wright chirped happily.

"He mentioned that several of his colleagues live in this complex, and nothing much ever happens here," Sophia continued as she set down the cardboard box she was holding.

"Alright, let's tidy up, and then I'll treat you all to dinner," Sophia offered, dusting herself off and looking at Emma Thomas.

"No way, you've got so much stuff. If you don't get it sorted today, sleeping tonight will be a hassle," Emma Thomas replied, eyeing the living room where the sofa and dining table were covered with items. She joined Sophia in organizing the chaos.

"Take a seat for a bit, or you could head back," Emma suggested to Ethan Clark, who was standing on the balcony, pointing to a chair by the table for him to sit or leave.

"Mr. Clark, take a break," Little Lee said as he brought a chair to the balcony for Ethan Clark, noticing he hadn't moved for a while.

Just then, Ethan Clark's phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out and answered, "Hello, Grandma."

"Hey, Ethan, has Emma Thomas graduated yet?" came the voice of Mrs. Clark from the other end.

"Yes, she has."

"Your grandma mentioned she hasn't had much time with Emma Thomas since you two got married. Now that she's graduated, why don't you bring her over tomorrow?" Mrs. Clark suggested, hoping Emma might stay home more now that they're married.

"Got it," Ethan Clark replied softly, glancing at Emma Thomas, who was busy tidying up. She looked up, sensing his gaze.

"What's up?"

"I need to run to the office. I'll come back later to pick you up," Ethan said, moving closer to her.

"You go ahead. I can get home on my own," Emma Thomas assured him, noticing his hurried expression.

"Alright, I'll be back later," Ethan said before leaving, with Little Lee following.

"Wow, Emma Thomas, your husband is really good to you," Sophia gossiped, watching them.

"You two are such a great match. You're so beautiful, and he's so handsome and successful. I genuinely wish you all the happiness," Sophia said earnestly, holding Emma's hand.

"So, how is he at home?" Sophia continued, her curiosity getting the better of her.

"Enough about that, are you treating me to dinner or not?" Emma countered playfully.

"Alright, alright, I won't pry anymore. Seeing how well he treats you today, I'm relieved," Sophia said, resuming their cleanup.

"It's almost lunchtime. How about I order us some takeout so we can eat and then finish up?" Sophia suggested, checking the time and pulling out her phone.

"Sounds good."

"What do you feel like eating?" Sophia asked, scrolling through the food delivery app.

"I'm easy, you pick," Emma said nonchalantly, not being picky about food.

"Alright, I'll order then."

"Sure."

Once the food arrived, Sophia cleared the table and set out the takeout.

"Time to eat," Sophia called out to Emma, who put down her cloth and joined her at the table.

"Smells amazing," Emma said, her stomach growling as the delicious aroma wafted through the air.

Sophia chuckled. "I ordered your favorite crawfish," she said, opening the box, and the enticing aroma of spiced crawfish filled the room.

"Yum!" Emma eagerly sat down, donning gloves to dig in.

"Tastes great," Emma said, savoring a piece of crawfish and giving Sophia a thumbs up.

"I haven't tried this place before. Glad it wasn't a miss," Sophia said with relief as they both happily indulged.

"Here's to you, Emma." Sophia handed Emma a can of Sprite, and they clinked their drinks in cheers.

"Cheers," Emma replied, raising her can to meet Sophia's.

After their meal, they continued tidying up the apartment, finally finishing as evening approached.

"It's late, time for dinner. There's a highly-rated barbecue place nearby. Want to check it out?" Sophia suggested, her eyes gleaming with excitement.

"Let's go, my treat," Emma said, grabbing her backpack. Sophia stopped her, "Wait, what if Ethan comes looking for you?"

"He probably won't. When he goes out for work, he usually gets back really late," Emma reasoned.

"Alright then, let's head out," Sophia said, linking arms with Emma as they walked to the door.

After leaving the complex and strolling for a bit, they spotted the barbecue joint.

"Is this it?" Emma exclaimed, pulling Sophia's arm as they approached the sign.

"Yep, this is the one. Let's go," Sophia replied, leading Emma inside.

"Excuse me, is there a place to sit?" Sophia asked the bustling owner.

"There's a table over there. Most folks prefer to sit outside," the owner replied warmly.

"Let's go," Sophia said, guiding Emma to a small round table.

"What do you want to eat? My treat," Emma said, handing the menu to Sophia.

"No fighting over the check," Sophia warned, glancing at the menu.

"If you still consider me a friend, let me treat you, Sophia. You've helped me through so much these past years. Let this meal be my thank you," Emma said, holding Sophia’s hand gently.

"Alright, alright, you can treat this time," Sophia conceded, laughing. "I'm going to order a feast then," she teased, diving back into the menu.

The food took a while, but when it finally arrived, the owner brought over their signature lamb skewers.

"Try these, our house specialty," the owner said, placing the skewers down.

"Thanks," Emma said, handing one to Sophia. "Give it a try." She picked one up for herself and took a bite.

"Wow, this is really good," Emma said, surprised at how delicious the skewers were from such an unassuming place.

"Yeah, definitely worth it," Sophia agreed, giving it a thumbs up.

Just then, Emma's phone vibrated on the table. She glanced at the screen, whispering to Sophia, "It's Ethan."

"Hey."

"Where are you?" Ethan asked gently over the phone.

"I'm... at Sophia’s," Emma fibbed, glancing nervously at Sophia.

"I'm at her place, no one answered the door. Send me your location," Ethan said assertively before hanging up.

Emma sighed, thinking for a moment. "Is Ethan coming to get you? Invite him to join us," Sophia suggested.

Emma sent her location to Ethan and continued eating. Within minutes, Sophia spotted Ethan approaching. "Hey, over here," Sophia waved to him.
