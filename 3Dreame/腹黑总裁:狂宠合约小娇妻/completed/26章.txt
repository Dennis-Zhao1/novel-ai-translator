It was 4 a.m. when Emma Thomas slowly awoke from her slumber, feeling wide awake with no trace of sleepiness. She was eager to head to the hospital. The room was eerily quiet, and she could distinctly hear the soft breathing of the person next to her. Turning to her side, she was surprised to find Ethan Clark asleep facing her.

In the dim light, she could clearly make out the contours of his face, prompting her to wonder, "What kind of person achieves so much at such a young age?" Her curiosity about him spiked. Ethan was a puzzleâ€”sometimes gentle, sometimes aloof, and always enigmatic.

Emma turned onto her back, staring at the ceiling as a slew of thoughts raced through her mind. "We started with a sham marriage, and now it's official," she pondered. "I haven't secured the shares yet. At least my uncle's situation is resolved. It's like I used the marriage certificate to solve his treatment issue. Once I get the shares, I can make my exit."

Reflecting on recent events, Emma felt a weight lift from her shoulders as she realized she had finally taken care of the threats that loomed over her.

She was so lost in thought that she barely noticed when Ethan shifted and placed an arm around her, murmuring softly, "Go to sleep." She was taken aback but decided against saying anything when she heard his steady breathing, indicating he was already asleep.

"This guy..." she thought quietly, carefully moving his arm off her before shifting a little closer to the edge of the bed. She turned her back to him, closed her eyes, and waited for the dawn.

Gradually, she drifted back to sleep, and after a few hours, morning finally arrived. At 6 a.m., her phone alarm blared. She quickly sat up to silence it, then turned to look at Ethan.

She gently patted him, whispering, "Time to get up." He was a light sleeper, and his eyes opened slowly. "What time is it?" he asked, glancing at her from the bed.

"Six," she replied. He looked at her with surprise but didn't say anything or make any move to get up.

Emma got out of bed, picked up her phone, and made a call. "Hi, Aunt," she said. "Uncle's transfer papers are ready. I'm planning to visit him today. Are you coming?"

"Great, I'll send you the address. Call me when you get there," she continued before heading to the bathroom. Ethan watched her for a moment before getting up slowly.

Downstairs, Grace Gonzalez was setting breakfast on the table. Emma and Ethan joined her, ready to eat. Emma grabbed a slice of toast, preparing to spread some jam on it. Ethan noticed and quickly took the jar from her.

He inspected the label carefully before turning to Grace Gonzalez, "Could you bring some ketchup instead?"

"I wanted that," Emma said, pointing at the jar he held.

"This has peanuts in it," Ethan said, scooping some onto his own toast.

Emma fell silent, and Grace Gonzalez handed her a bottle of ketchup. "Grace, please make sure not to buy anything with peanuts in the future. Mrs. Thomas is allergic," Ethan instructed carefully.

Emma paused mid-bite, wondering, "How does he remember I'm allergic to peanuts? I think I only mentioned it once."

"Finish up. We should get going soon," Ethan gently interrupted her thoughts, looking at her warmly. Emma glanced at him, then focused on finishing her meal quickly.

After breakfast, they drove to the care facility. On the way, Emma's phone rang. "Hi, Aunt," she answered. "You're already there? Okay, I'll be there soon. Wait for me at the entrance."

After hanging up, she didn't say much. Ethan glanced at her, "Your aunt's there already?"

"Yeah, she came right away after getting the call. Probably didn't have breakfast," Emma replied with concern.

Ethan surveyed the area, spotting a convenience store nearby and pulling over. "Why are we stopping?" Emma asked, puzzled.

"Hold on," he said, unbuckling his seatbelt and heading inside the store.

A few moments later, he emerged with a brown paper bag. "Here," he said, handing it to her as he got back into the car.

She looked at the bag, confused. "This is..."

"For your aunt," he explained, resuming their drive.

Emma gazed at him, touched by his thoughtfulness. "Thank you," she said, realizing how attentive he was, always finding solutions.

They arrived at the upscale care facility, and Emma admired the surroundings. The place looked impressive.

"Aunt," Emma called out, rushing to her side as soon as she got out of the car. Ethan parked and joined them shortly after.

"Emma, Ethan, you're here," her aunt said softly, sounding tired and unrested.

"Let's go inside," Ethan suggested, leading them to the reception to inquire about the room number.

They proceeded to the fifth-floor intensive care unit and entered her uncle's room. Emma was heartbroken to see him covered in tubes, tears welling in her eyes as she called out to him.

"How is he?" she asked Ethan, her voice choked with emotion, clinging to his arm. He was about to respond when a knock at the door interrupted them.

"Doctor, how is my uncle now?" Emma asked urgently as the doctor entered. The doctor nodded at Ethan before addressing them.

"The patient's condition is stable for now, but without intervention, he won't wake up. I recommend surgery as soon as possible."

"What's the success rate?" her aunt asked anxiously.

The doctor sighed, "We don't perform many of these surgeries here. Based on our records, the success rate is about thirty percent."

Emma looked at her uncle, then back at the doctor. "Are there any other options?"

"None," the doctor replied. "This is his only chance to wake up. However, if you can get an expert from Germany, the success rate could be as high as eighty percent. They are very advanced in this field."

Ethan considered this for a moment, then assured them, "If you decide, let me know. I can arrange for an expert from Germany."

Emma turned to her aunt, holding her hand as tears filled her eyes. "Aunt, what do you think?"

"I want to try," her aunt said, her voice firm. "I believe he would want to try too."

"Okay, let's do it," Emma said with determination, looking at Ethan with resolve.
