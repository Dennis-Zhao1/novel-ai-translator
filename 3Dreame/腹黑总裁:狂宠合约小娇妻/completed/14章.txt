Ethan Clark gently carried a tipsy Emma Thomas into their cozy home. As he made his way upstairs, he called out to Grace Gonzalez, their ever-reliable helper, "Hey Grace, could you bring up some honey water?" 

Once in the bedroom, Ethan laid Emma on the bed. She clung to his neck, clearly not ready to let go. Just then, a soft knock interrupted the moment. It was Grace, ready with the honey water. 

"Mrs. Thomas, this will help with the hangover," Grace coaxed, trying to offer the straw to Emma. But Emma, in her drunken stubbornness, mumbled, "Nope, not drinking."

Ethan sighed, took the cup from Grace, and sipped the honey water himself. Then, with a mischievous grin, he gently pinched Emma's cheeks, opening her mouth and feeding her the honey water with a kiss. Emma, surprised by the warmth, tried pushing him away but only managed a weak protest.

Grace, sensing the need to leave, quietly excused herself, closing the door behind her. Ethan, undeterred, continued to transfer the honey water, a playful yet gentle exchange that left Emma coughing a bit as she adjusted to the sudden sweetness.

"You're so handsome," Emma giggled, suddenly pulling Ethan closer. "Have I seen you somewhere before?"

Ethan chuckled, amused by her hazy memory, "I'm your husband, remember?"

"Husband?" she repeated, squinting at him as if seeing him for the first time. Her hands traced the sharp lines of his face. "Wow, such strong features."

Ethan, blushing from her unexpected compliments, gently caught her hand. "Alright, time to get some rest," he suggested, trying to ease her back into bed.

"I'm not sleepy," Emma protested, pulling him closer still. "Unless you sleep with me."

Ethan, not one to resist such a request, replied, "Okay, your husband will keep you company." He leaned in for a soft kiss, savoring the sweet taste left by the honey water.

Emma, feeling a bit overwhelmed, pushed him away gently, "Ouch."

Realizing he might have been a bit too enthusiastic, Ethan apologized, "I'm sorry," he said, brushing his fingers through her hair. "There, it won't hurt."

As Emma drifted into a peaceful sleep, Ethan watched her, lost in thought. "What will happen when you learn the truth about our marriage?" he mused silently. "If only things could stay this way."

He pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead before quietly leaving the room.

Later that night, as Ethan was heading out, Grace saw him from the top of the stairs. "Heading out, Mr. Clark?" she inquired.

"Take care of Mrs. Thomas," he instructed. "Remind her to drink honey water in the morning." With that, he disappeared into the night.

The next morning, Emma awoke with a start, a sharp pain at her lips. Staring at her reflection in the bathroom mirror, she was shocked by her swollen lips. "What happened last night?" she wondered aloud, piecing together fragments of memory. 

She remembered meeting Joy, then James Campbell. But how did she get home? Did Ethan bring her back? What did he do to her? Her mind raced with possibilities.

Determined to get answers, she grabbed her phone and called Ethan, whom she half-jokingly referred to as "the devil." After several rings, a woman's voice answered.

"Hello?"

"Uh, Ethan?" Emma asked, taken aback.

"Hi Emma, this is Lily Lewis, Ethan's assistant. He's not awake yet. Can I take a message?"

"No, it's fine," Emma replied curtly, hanging up and feeling a pang of jealousy. "Could she be the woman from last night?" she wondered.

Trying to shake off her frustration, Emma stepped into the shower, hoping it would clear her head. But when her phone buzzed again with a call from Ethan, she hesitated, remembering the assistant's voice. She almost ignored it but decided she needed to know what happened.

"Why didn't you pick up earlier?" Ethan demanded when she answered.

"I didn't hear it," Emma fibbed, trying to keep her cool. "What happened last night? And why is my mouth swollen?"

Ethan chuckled softly on the other end, "Is that all?"

Emma, growing impatient, pressed on, "Did you do this? What exactly did you do?"

Ethan's voice was smooth and teasing, "We did what married couples do."

Emma's anger flared, "You took advantage of me while I was drunk? You jerk!"

"You're my wife," Ethan replied confidently.

"We have a contract, remember? After this is done, we're going our separate ways. We aren't even legally married," Emma retorted, her frustration palpable.

"If you leave now, the Thomas Group will be finished. Can you afford that?" Ethan's voice was cold and final before he hung up.

"Jerk," Emma muttered, staring at her phone. 

She knew she had to protect the Thomas Group, her mother's legacy. "I have to stick with the Clark Group to get back the Thomas Group," she thought, pacing by the window. "I need to find out Ethan's plans. How long do I have to keep up this charade?"

Lost in thought, Emma continued to pace, questions swirling in her mind as she plotted her next move.
