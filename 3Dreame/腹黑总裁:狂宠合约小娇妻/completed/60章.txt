Emma Thomas finally had a moment of clarity as she sat silently on the plush conference room sofa. The quiet was interrupted by a knock at the door.

"Come in," she called out.

Daniel Johnson entered, arms laden with paperwork. "Ethan Clark, I've got some documents for you to sign and a couple of project proposals that need your review."

Seeing Ethan Clark still swamped with work, Emma got up to leave. "I'll head home," she said hurriedly, hoping to slip out unnoticed.

But Ethan wasn't ready to let her go just yet. "Hold on," he said, picking up his phone. After a brief call, Sophia Wright entered the room.

"You needed me, Ethan?" she asked.

"Yes, take Emma out for some fresh air," he instructed, granting Sophia the rest of the afternoon off.

"Emma, what's wrong?" Sophia asked, noticing the sadness etched on Emma's face.

"Nothing, really. Ethan, I don’t want to impose..." Emma started to decline but Ethan insisted.

"Sophia, take her out," he said firmly.

"Let's go," Sophia said, gently pulling Emma towards the door. Ethan watched them leave, then returned to his mountain of paperwork.

"Sophia, give me a minute," Emma said as they reached Sophia’s desk. Sophia quickly gathered her things, and soon they were off.

"Emma, I'm taking you somewhere special," Sophia announced as they hopped into a cab.

The cab ride ended at an amusement park. Emma glanced at the park through the window and then at Sophia, teasing, "Aren't you a bit too old for this?"

Sophia just laughed. "I love this place. Come on, let's have some fun."

They bought tickets and wandered into the park, the air filled with laughter and the scent of popcorn. "How about the roller coaster?" Sophia suggested, her eyes gleaming with excitement.

Emma shook her head vigorously. "No way," she said, laughing nervously at the thought.

Sophia looked slightly disappointed. "That's too bad. It always cheers me up."

Emma pointed to the carousel. "I’ll ride that," she said, smiling.

Sophia was taken aback. "You still like carousels?" she asked incredulously. Emma's childlike choice amused her. "Ethan must spoil you rotten," she teased.

"Come on, join me," Emma said, dragging Sophia to the ticket booth. As Emma pulled out her phone to pay, Sophia stopped her.

"This one's on me," Sophia insisted. "Think of it as a thank you for Ethan's help in getting me this job."

Emma relented, touched by Sophia's gratitude. "How's it going at Group Clark?" she asked as they waited in line.

"It's great! Everyone's been so supportive," Sophia replied, her eyes shining with happiness.

"I'm glad," Emma said, relieved to hear that Sophia was settling in well.

Sophia linked arms with Emma. "When are you joining us full-time? We could spend more time together!"

Emma blushed slightly. "Soon, I think," she said softly, accepting the tickets from the booth attendant as they moved forward.

As they rode the carousel, Sophia exclaimed, "This is surprisingly relaxing!"

Emma smiled, a wave of nostalgia washing over her. "When I was upset as a kid, my grandma would take me on the carousel," she confided, feeling a bit of her burdens lift.

Afterwards, as they sat on a nearby bench sipping water, Sophia asked, "Feeling better?"

Emma nodded, a genuine smile on her face. "I think I am."

Sophia was visibly relieved. "Seeing you smile makes me happy."

Emma hesitated before voicing her thoughts. "Sophia, do you think if someone initially gets together with you for some ulterior motive, but then claims to have genuinely fallen for you, is that possible?"

Sophia immediately understood. "Are we talking about you and Ethan?" she asked, raising an eyebrow.

Emma nodded, hoping for some clarity.

"Look, even if people start out with other intentions, spending time together can lead to real feelings," Sophia reasoned. "From what I've seen, Ethan's feelings for you seem genuine."

Emma pondered this, feeling a bit more at ease. "You're probably right," she admitted, warming to the idea.

Sophia grinned. "Whatever the reason, it's clear he really cares about you."

Emma blushed, sipping her water to hide her embarrassment. "Enough about me," she said, trying to change the subject.

Sophia laughed, playfully sealing her lips. "Alright, no more gossiping about the bosses!"

Emma playfully swatted at Sophia, who darted away. "I'll catch you!" Emma called, as she chased after her friend, the burden on her heart finally lightened.

As they ran through the park, Emma realized something important. She decided to give her marriage with Ethan a chance, knowing she could always protect her heart if things didn’t work out.
