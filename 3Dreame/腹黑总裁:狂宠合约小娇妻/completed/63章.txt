Emma Thomas had made up her mind to be Ethan Clark's assistant. She snapped back to reality, quickly shaking her head. “Oh... it’s nothing,” she said, brushing off her thoughts as they strolled into the mall together.

Ethan felt a bit out of his element. He had never gone shopping with a girl in a place like this before; he usually got his clothes custom-made. He wasn’t quite sure what he was supposed to do.

Emma chuckled, “You’ve never been shopping with a girl, have you?”

Ethan turned to her, flashing an awkward smile. “Well, after a few more times with you, I’ll get used to it.”

They exchanged a glance, sharing a moment before moving forward. “Let’s check this out,” Emma said, dragging Ethan into a clothing store. The cheerful sales associate greeted them, “Hello, sir, ma'am, come in and take a look.”

As they wandered through the racks, Emma’s eyes landed on a yellow dress on a mannequin. She seemed captivated by it.

“Do you want to try it on?” Ethan asked, noticing her interest.

“Yes, ma'am, this dress is one of our brand’s new arrivals this year. It's been selling really well,” the sales associate chimed in.

“Could you take her to try it on?” Ethan handed the dress to the associate, who then led Emma to the fitting room.

Emma glanced back at Ethan, who nodded encouragingly. She followed the associate, disappearing into the fitting room, while Ethan took a seat in the waiting area, his eyes trailing after her.

His gaze caught a white jacket hanging nearby. “Sir, your wife looks great in that dress,” the associate said as the fitting room door opened, and Emma emerged.

Ethan was momentarily stunned. The dress fit her perfectly, as if it was made for her. Emma felt a bit shy, noticing Ethan’s stare. She walked over to him, asking, “How does it look?”

Ethan, still entranced by her beauty, finally managed to say, “Um... it suits you.”

Was that it? Just suits me? But I think it looks great.

Emma thought Ethan didn’t like the dress, unaware he was simply mesmerized. She returned to change back, and when she came out, Ethan immediately stood up.

He walked over to the white jacket, took it off the rack, and handed it to the sales associate. “Wrap up both, please,” he said, gazing warmly at Emma.

Emma was taken aback. He seemed indifferent about the dress earlier, so why was he buying it? And what about the white jacket? Did he like her in this style?

“Let’s go,” Ethan said, taking the bags from the sales associate and leading Emma out of the store. “We should get some shoes and bags, too.”

Emma followed, amused by Ethan’s eager searching for shoe and bag stores. She found his earnestness endearing, and a soft smile played on her lips as she glanced at their intertwined hands, then at his profile.

After finishing their shopping spree, they headed out of the mall.

“Can I start work tomorrow?” Emma asked softly, looking at Ethan in the driver’s seat.

Ethan smiled, glancing at her. “Do you want to spend the day with me?”

Emma blushed slightly, “I... don’t have anything to do at home.”

“Then come to work with me tomorrow,” Ethan said warmly.

“What position would I have?” Emma asked, her eyes full of anticipation.

Ethan pondered for a moment. “We have roles in HR, finance, and as an assistant.”

Emma was about to respond when Ethan interrupted, “Why not be my assistant?”

He sounded quite enthusiastic about the idea. An assistant? I graduated from a top computer science program. Isn’t that a bit beneath me?

“Don’t you have any positions in IT?” Emma asked, slightly disappointed.

Seeing her hopeful expression, Ethan didn’t want to let her down. He confessed his thoughts. “You’re already the largest shareholder of Group Thomas. Its future depends on you.”

“So, I thought it’d be good for you to learn more about finance. It’ll benefit you in the long run. But if you don’t want to be an assistant, I can set you up in IT.”

Emma realized he had a point. She was going to take over Group Thomas someday, and learning finance would be crucial. She turned to Ethan, feeling a newfound appreciation for his foresight.

“Well? Have you decided?” Ethan asked, catching her gaze.

“Yeah, I’ll be your assistant. Please teach me well,” Emma replied with a smile.

Ethan was over the moon. He hadn’t expected her to agree so readily. “What does an assistant do, anyway?” Emma asked, curious.

“Everything from getting coffee and managing schedules to meeting clients,” Ethan explained while driving.

Emma was surprised. She hadn’t realized an assistant did so much. How would she have time to learn? Could she really gain valuable skills?

She looked at Ethan skeptically, but he understood her concern. “An assistant stays close to the boss, hears all the important conversations, and learns from them. You'll gain plenty of insights that way.”

Emma thought over his words. Spending more time with Ethan might help her develop a business mindset. “I'll guide you step by step,” Ethan reassured her.

“Then I’m in your hands,” Emma joked, making Ethan’s heart swell with happiness. Her words meant so much to him.

“Don’t worry,” he replied with a smile, though Emma didn’t seem to catch his words.

They parked the car in front of their villa and headed inside together, ready for whatever tomorrow would bring.
