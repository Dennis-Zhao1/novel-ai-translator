In the early morning, as the first rays of sunlight streamed into the bedroom of her villa, Emma Thomas slowly opened her eyes. She stretched, yawned, and was about to get out of bed when she heard a gentle knock on the door.

"Mrs. Thomas, are you up?" Grace Gonzalez, the housekeeper, called from outside.

"Mr. Clark asked me to wake you at 9 so you could have breakfast," Grace continued, tapping on the door again.

"I'm up," Emma replied groggily as she headed to the bathroom. Just as she was about to brush her teeth, she noticed something missing from the laundry basketâ€”Ethan's white shirt was gone.

Quickly, she dashed back to the bedroom and called out, "Grace!"

Grace entered immediately, looking concerned. "Mrs. Thomas, is everything alright?"

"Did Ethan come home last night?" Emma asked, her eyes wide with surprise.

"Yes, he returned early this morning, changed clothes, and left again. He mentioned he'd be back for lunch," Grace explained.

"Ah, that makes sense," Emma thought, realizing Ethan had probably tried to cover his tracks. Fortunately, she had snapped a few pictures as evidence.

"Is something wrong?" Grace asked again, her voice full of curiosity.

"No, it's nothing," Emma replied casually. "Just noticed some clothes missing."

"Ethan gave me a shirt to throw away this morning. I disposed of it right away," Grace said, still looking a bit puzzled.

"It's fine," Emma reassured her as she continued to the bathroom.

"Would you like breakfast upstairs, or will you come down to eat?" Grace inquired.

Emma called back from the bathroom, "I'll come down."

After getting ready, Emma headed downstairs, noticing a change in the living room setup. "Grace, did we change the coffee table?" she asked.

"Mr. Clark thought you'd prefer something more modern, so he had it replaced," Grace said, placing a glass of orange juice on the table for Emma.

At the dining table, Emma was surprised by the spread of breakfast items. "Wow, Grace, why so much food today?"

Grace chuckled, "Mr. Clark said you sometimes prefer sweet and sometimes savory, so he asked me to prepare a variety."

Emma couldn't help but feel astonished. How did he become so thoughtful all of a sudden? Was it because of what he said last night about taking responsibility?

"It's too hot; I'm not too hungry," Emma said, eyeing the breakfast, unsure where to start and not really wanting to eat what Ethan had arranged.

"Mr. Clark mentioned you could only have ice cream and chilled watermelon if you ate your breakfast," Grace teased, knowing Emma's weakness.

"Grace," Emma whined, giving her a pleading look.

Seeing Grace unmoved, Emma reluctantly began eating, picking up a muffin. "Can I have the watermelon now?" she asked after finishing most of her meal and sipping the last of her juice.

"I'll bring it right out," Grace said with a knowing smile.

Emma was thrilled to see a fruit platter with strawberries and blueberries. "He remembered I love these?" she mused, amused and slightly touched.

Just as she was about to dig in, her phone rang. Glancing at the screen, she saw "Evil Boss" and hesitated before answering.

"Hello?"

"Morning! Are you up?" Ethan's voice came through, warm and teasing.

"Don't you have work to do? Isn't this the busiest time for meetings and stuff?" Emma retorted, her annoyance barely masked.

Ethan chuckled, sensing her lingering frustration from last night. "Have you tried the strawberries yet?"

Emma was momentarily taken aback. How did he know she'd be eating them right now?

"No," she replied curtly.

"Well, enjoy them. I have a meeting, so I won't be back for lunch," Ethan continued.

"Why tell me?" Emma snapped, not really caring.

"Because you're my wife. Who else would I tell?" Ethan teased.

"You destroyed evidence this morning, but I have photos," Emma said, biting into a strawberry.

"Are you jealous?" Ethan asked, fishing for the answer he hoped for.

"In your dreams," Emma replied, hanging up and diving into her watermelon slice.

Ethan, hearing the click of the call ending, was amused and put his phone down with a smirk.

Emma, munching on her watermelon, plotted her next move. She needed to find Ethan's weak spot, and the best way was to be around him more.

"I need to spend more time with him to find out what he's hiding. If I'm around during the day, I'll surely catch something," Emma resolved.

She drafted a message on her phone, hesitated, then rewrote it: "Ethan Clark, I'm joining your company tomorrow!" Satisfied, she hit send.

Ethan, busy in his office, received her message. Reading it, a satisfied smile spread across his face as if everything was going according to plan.

"Alright," he replied, before getting back to work.

Emma, seeing his response, began pondering what role she might take on at his company.

"I need a position where I can see him often. Maybe his assistant?" she mused aloud.

"Yes, his assistant. That way, I'll manage both his work and personal life. I will find his weak spot," she thought, feeling victorious.

Just as she was gearing up with enthusiasm, the thought of last night crept back in, bringing a twinge of fear. "What if...?" she wondered, dread filling her thoughts. "I can't be pregnant. I'm too young for this!"

Determined, she rushed upstairs, changed, and called for the driver, hoping to address her newfound concern discreetly. Grace noticed her hurried exit but said nothing, just watched with a knowing smile.
