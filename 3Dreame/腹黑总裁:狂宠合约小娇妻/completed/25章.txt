Chapter 1

"Hey there, Ethan, Emma!" Grace called out as she saw them walking in, with Ethan carrying Emma like she was some kind of princess.

"Is dinner ready?" Ethan asked, pausing in the living room.

Emma gave him a playful shove. "Put me down, will you?"

"All set. I'll bring it right out," Grace replied, heading toward the kitchen.

Ethan set Emma down by the dining table and took a seat next to her. "Time to eat," he said, with that familiar cold edge in his voice.

"I'm not hungry," Emma declared defiantly. But Ethan's stern look made her sit back down.

Grace returned with the dishes, presenting them with a smile. "Emma, all your favorites, courtesy of Ethan's orders."

Emma glanced at the spread, then at Ethan. With a surprising tenderness, he placed a piece of fish in her bowl. "Eat up," he instructed, following it with a piece of sweet and sour pork. "Have some more."

Emma was puzzled. Just a moment ago, he was as cold as a winter breeze, and now he was all sweet and caring. Talk about mixed signals.

She took a bite of the fish, savoring the familiar taste that reminded her of dinners at her grandma's house. Ethan seemed to notice her nostalgia. "Does it taste like home?"

Emma nodded, and he added some salad to her bowl. "Try this."

Before she knew it, she had eaten quite a bit, thanks to Ethan's persistent efforts. "Wow, you must have been starving," Ethan teased, setting his chopsticks down.

Emma blushed, finishing her last bite. As she tried to stand, Ethan pointed out, "Aren't you going to eat those peanuts?"

"I can't. I'm allergic," Emma murmured, eyeing the peanuts awkwardly.

Without missing a beat, Ethan took her bowl and polished off the remaining peanuts and mushrooms. Emma watched him, slightly shocked. "I already ate from that."

"Doesn't bother me," Ethan shrugged, heading over to the sofa. Emma followed, checking the time before starting upstairs.

"Don't forget your shopping bags," Ethan reminded her.

Emma grabbed her new clothes and purse, making her way to the bedroom. She put everything away, pondering Ethan's bizarre behavior. "He's acting so strange today," she mused.

Just then, her phone buzzed with a call. She answered it, hearing a sweet voice on the other end.

"Hi there."

"Hey, sorry, something came up. I can't make it tomorrow," the voice apologized.

Emma hung up, lost in thought. "What are his plans for tomorrow? It's the 29th... nothing special, right?"

Shrugging it off, she headed to the study to get some homework done.

Downstairs, Ethan was on the phone. "It's all set? I'll be there tomorrow."

After hanging up, he made his way upstairs, searching for Emma. Finding her diligently working in the study, he approached silently.

"Your handwriting is beautiful," he remarked, leaning over her with one hand on the back of her chair and the other on the desk.

Startled, Emma's pen slipped, ruining her neat script. She looked up, meeting his gaze. Her heart skipped a beat, her cheeks flushed.

"You..." she stammered, trying to break the tension. She gave his arm a gentle push, but it barely moved him.

Ethan, noticing her rosy cheeks and pink lips, felt an urge to kiss her. Emma, sensing the change in his demeanor, quickly diverted her eyes to her textbook. "Can you help me with this problem?"

Ethan glanced at the book, effortlessly providing the answer. "Sure, here's how you do it."

Emma, eager to move past the awkward moment, resumed writing. Ethan leaned in, catching the scent of her hair. "You smell nice," he murmured near her ear.

His warm breath sent a shiver down her spine. She shifted uncomfortably. "Could you, um, give me some space?" she asked nervously.

He straightened up, sitting across from her. "Keep going."

Emma returned to her work, but Ethan's words lingered. "Your uncle's transfer is complete."

She looked up, hope lighting her eyes. "Really?"

"Yeah."

"Can I visit him?" Emma continued.

"I'll take you tomorrow." Ethan smiled, a rare warmth in his expression.

"So that's your plan for tomorrow," Emma said, feeling guilty for doubting him.

"Will you go?" Ethan teased.

"Of course. And I don't need any money," Emma replied quickly.

Ethan chuckled at her eagerness, maintaining his stoic demeanor. "You should take it. You earn it."

"Don't your parents support you?" Ethan asked, probing gently.

Emma's eyes shifted back to her book. "They cover the basics."

"And that's not enough?"

"Not really," she admitted softly.

"Starting tomorrow, I'll give you a monthly allowance," Ethan declared, standing up.

"It's really not necessary. I canâ€”" Emma began, standing as well.

"We're partners, Emma. What's mine is yours. Isn't that what you said at your grandma's?" Ethan reminded her, heading back to the bedroom.
