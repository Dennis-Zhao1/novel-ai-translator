He Discovered Her Secret

"Let's sit and chat, Aunt Mary," Emma Thomas gently guided Aunt Mary to the sofa in the hospital room. Aunt Mary's face was lined with worry, her gaze fixed on the floor.

"Uncle Jack will be fine," Emma reassured her, seeing the concern etched deeply on her aunt's face.

"You guys sit tight. I need to step out for a bit," Ethan Clark said, making his way to the door and closing it softly behind him.

Now, the room was just Emma, Aunt Mary, and Uncle Jack, who lay quietly on the bed.

"Aunt Mary, don't worry. Ethan said he could find a specialist, and if he says he can, he definitely will," Emma comforted her, gently patting her back.

"Emma, we owe you so much over the years, both your Uncle Jack and I," Aunt Mary said, holding Emma's hand, her eyes resting on Emma's face.

"You're family. That's what we do," Emma smiled warmly.

"But your rushed marriage, was Oliver Thomas pushing you?" Aunt Mary asked, her voice filled with concern, as if she could see right through Emma's marriage.

Emma hesitated for a moment, "Aunt Mary, this was my decision." Her eyes were determined as she looked at her aunt.

"Don't think I can't tell. When you both came over last time, you didn't look like newlyweds at all. It was obvious you hardly knew each other," Aunt Mary said, her expression full of understanding.

"Is Oliver Thomas threatening you because of your uncle, or is it for his own gain?" Aunt Mary pressed on.

Emma didn't reply, her head lowered, eyes downcast, hands nervously fidgeting.

Seeing Emma like this brought Aunt Mary back to Emma's childhood, "Look at you, just like when you were little, playing with your hands when upset."

"Well, no matter what, it seems like Ethan truly cares for you. He won't treat you poorly," Aunt Mary assured, gently shaking Emma's arm. They exchanged a smile.

Ethan Clark had been standing outside the door for a while, having overheard their conversation. His face was serious, a sense of pity swelling within him.

"Who would have thought someone so young would carry such burdens," he mused. "I initially thought she agreed to the marriage for the sake of shares, but it turns out her uncle is the main reason. Her uncle must mean a lot to her."

After contemplating for a moment, he pushed open the door and walked in.

"I got in touch with a specialist from Germany. Coincidentally, he's in the country for research and can perform the surgery next Tuesday," Ethan announced, his gaze lingering on Emma.

"Really?" Emma's eyes lit up as she looked at him.

"Yes," he replied with certainty, his eyes meeting hers.

"That's wonderful," Aunt Mary said, her face breaking into a teary smile as she held Emma's hand.

Aunt Mary and Emma embraced, with Emma softly patting her aunt's back. "Don't worry," she said, glancing at Ethan.

"Emma, before coming here, I left Kiki with your grandma. I won't be going back this week; I'll stay here to take care of your Uncle Jack," Aunt Mary said, releasing her hold on Emma and looking at her.

"Aunt Mary, why don't you stay at our place this week?" Ethan suggested. Emma glanced at him and then playfully hugged her aunt's arm, "Yeah, Aunt Mary, please stay at our place."

"I'll stay here with your uncle, so I can keep him company and talk to him," Aunt Mary replied, patting Emma's hand with a smile.

Seeing her aunt's insistence, Emma let her stay in the hospital room.

"There's nothing more to do here. You two should get going," Aunt Mary said gently to Emma.

"I'll come by another day," Emma replied, picking up her bag and slowly leaving the hospital with Ethan.

"Thank you," Emma murmured softly, her head lowered.

Ethan didn't respond, but after recalling the conversation he had overheard, he opened the passenger door for her. "Get in," he said, giving her a look.

The ride was mostly silent, with Ethan eventually breaking the awkwardness. "Join me at a friend's wedding tomorrow."

Emma looked at him, surprised. "Your friend?"

"Yeah, why?" Their eyes met.

"Our relationship isn't real. If we meet your friends during the contract period, when we... separate, it might..." Emma trailed off, her words hesitant. Ethan suddenly hit the brakes.

"For as long as we're married, we should act like it," he stated firmly, his expression stern and a hint of anger in his eyes.

Emma glanced at him and, feeling a familiar unease, shifted towards the window. She remembered a similar moment in the car before. "Alright, I'll go. Don't be mad," she reassured him.

Ethan calmed down a bit, unsure why his emotions had flared so suddenly. "I'm not angry," he said coolly, resuming driving.

"What do I need to do tomorrow?" Emma asked tentatively.

"Just be Emma Thomas," he replied while driving.

"Okay," Emma whispered.

After some time, they arrived back home. Emma got out and slowly headed to the bedroom, planning to take a shower and change into something more comfortable.

As she reached the closet to grab some clothes, Ethan walked in.

"What are you doing up here?" Emma asked nervously, almost dropping her clothes.

Ethan's eyes moved from her face to the clothes in her hands. He bent down, picked up the clothes she nearly dropped, and handed them to her. "I need to change and head to the office," he said gently.

"Oh, go ahead then," Emma said, putting down her clothes and heading for the door.

She waited by the door for a bit, watching as Ethan, dressed in a navy suit with a black tie and sleek shoes, walked towards her.

"Isn't he the perfect clothes model?" she thought. "So tall and handsome."

Emma was momentarily entranced, her mind racing with thoughts, until Ethan reached her side. "You can go in," he said, his voice like a gentle current.

Startled, Emma fumbled for words, her hands clasped nervously behind her. "Oh, okay," she said, quickly retreating to the bedroom closet.

"By the way, I have plans tonight. Make sure you have dinner at home," Ethan said before heading downstairs.

Emma turned, watching him as he descended, noting how even walking down stairs he looked effortlessly cool.

"Grace, no need to cook for me tonight," Emma heard Ethan's voice echo from the first floor.

"And remind Mrs. Thomas to go to bed early. I'll be back late," Ethan instructed before heading out.

Upstairs, Emma caught bits of Ethan's last words but wasn't entirely sure. Deep down, she still believed Ethan was just using her, that their marriage was merely a contract.

After standing in thought for a moment, Emma moved to the closet, changed into comfortable clothes, and began painting. Art was her solace in solitude.
