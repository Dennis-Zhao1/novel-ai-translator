Charlotte Jones' Tragic Plot

"Don't forget, if I don't help you, you'll end up with nothing but a little inheritance from my big brother. You want so much right now, but I could easily choose not to help you," Charlotte Jones' aunt warned her.

Charlotte thought it over, then agreed, "Alright, we'll make our move during Grandma's birthday celebration."

"Okay, since you've made up your mind, I'll head out." Her aunt left, leaving Charlotte sitting in deep contemplation. After a while, she picked up her phone and made a call.

"Hello, are you ready with what I asked for?" Charlotte inquired over the phone.

"Ma'am, rest assured, everything's set," replied a middle-aged man's voice.

"Deliver it to me the day after tomorrow," Charlotte instructed before hanging up. She sat alone, gently patting her stomach.

Two Days Later

Sunlight streamed into the bedroom as Emma Thomas applied her makeup in front of the mirror. Ethan Clark was sitting on the sofa, waiting patiently.

"Alright, let's go," Emma said, standing up and looking down at Ethan.

Ethan slowly raised his head, put down his book, and stood up. He smiled at the sight of her. "You look beautiful."

Emma pouted playfully, "It's all your fault. You didn't tell me about Grandma's birthday before coming here, so I didn't have time to prepare a gift. Now I can only give this."

"I've already taken care of it," Ethan reassured her, signaling a servant to bring out an exquisite box.

"What's this?" Emma asked curiously.

"Grandma loves collecting jade. I had this fine piece brought in from overseas," Ethan explained, looking at Emma.

"Good thing you prepared something," Emma finally relaxed.

"I couldn't possibly let my lady be embarrassed in front of everyone," Ethan teased, looking down at her.

Emma blushed slightly at his words and said shyly, "Let's go." She turned towards the door.

"Wait," Ethan called after her. Emma stopped and turned back to him. He walked over with his hands in his pockets.

"Hold my arm," he suggested gently. As they locked eyes, Ethan smiled warmly.

Emma glanced at his arm, thinking to herself, "Well, he's the one funding me. I'll just consider this part of the job."

With a small sigh, she wrapped her arms around his as they walked out together.

Crossing the backyard, they reached the front hall, which was bustling with servants setting up decorations. Emma was amazed. "Wow, they're going all out."

"Yeah, everyone's home this year, so we wanted to make it special," Ethan explained.

"Emma, Ethan, you're here!" Their aunt rushed over excitedly, grabbing Emma's hand. "Emma, I had some desserts made. Want to help me taste-test them?"

Emma glanced awkwardly at Ethan, who was about to speak when Charlotte Jones interrupted, "Emma, let's try them together."

"Okay," Emma agreed, unable to refuse since both insisted. Besides, she hadn't contributed much to the celebration.

"Let's go." The aunt led Emma towards the western kitchen.

"Where is everyone?" They arrived to find a table full of desserts but no people.

"Maybe they're busy elsewhere," Charlotte suggested, sitting down in a chair.

"You sit tight. I'll fetch someone," the aunt said before leaving.

The kitchen fell silent. Just as Emma was about to speak, Charlotte beat her to it, "Emma, my stomach feels heavy. Could you get me a glass of water?"

Without thinking twice, Emma replied, "Sure, one moment." She found a clean glass, filled it with water, and handed it to Charlotte.

Charlotte took the glass, and as Emma turned to admire the desserts, she discreetly slipped a pill into the water and drank it.

After a while, the aunt returned with two servants. "Here they are. Heat them in the microwave, and we'll taste them," she instructed the servants.

"Just a moment," the aunt said, sitting down casually.

Emma nodded, about to sit when Charlotte suddenly screamed, "Ah!" Emma froze, quickly moving to help Charlotte, worriedly asking, "What's wrong?"

Charlotte clutched her stomach, her face contorted with pain, looking at Emma. "It hurts so much," she said, her voice filled with urgency.

"What did you eat? How did this happen?" the aunt asked, concerned, crouching beside Charlotte and holding her hands.

"I... I didn't eat anything. Just a glass of water Emma gave me," Charlotte said tearfully, clearly in distress.

Emma was anxious, fumbling for her phone. "Ethan, come quickly," she called, her voice trembling.

As soon as she hung up, unsure of what to do, the aunt called their family doctor, who arrived swiftly.

"What happened?" Ethan arrived, taking Emma's hand gently, noticing her anxiety.

"Charlotte..." Emma began, but the aunt interrupted, "Ethan, Charlotte's stomach's in agony after drinking a glass of water Emma gave her."

"Let's have the doctor take a look first," Ethan said calmly, helping Charlotte to a resting room where the doctor attended to her.

"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you won't be able to keep the child," the doctor said sadly, standing up.

"What?" Charlotte exclaimed, grabbing the doctor's coat desperately. "How could this happen? I didn't do anything."

"Ma'am, you should get to a hospital for a thorough check-up," the doctor advised.

"Was it the water? Emma, why would you harm my child? I never wronged you. Why?" Charlotte cried, leaning against the bed, devastated.

Emma was terrified, stepping back, "No, I didn't do it," she stammered, scared.

Ethan wrapped an arm around her, whispering softly, "Don't be afraid."

Ethan looked at everyone gathered, his expression cold. "Let's get to the hospital. We'll discuss it once we have the results."

He signaled for the servants to take Charlotte to the hospital, and the aunt accompanied her.

The story unfolds around the birthday celebration, with Charlotte using her pregnancy to frame Emma.
