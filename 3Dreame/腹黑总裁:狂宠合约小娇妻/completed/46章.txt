Title: A Game of Pretend

---

Emma Thomas glanced around the room, realizing it was just her and Ethan Clark left. She stood up, nervous curiosity getting the better of her. "Are we really leaving at the beginning of next month?"

Ethan nodded reassuringly, moving closer to her. "Yeah, we are."

"Does that mean I shouldn't start my new job on Monday?" Emma asked, concerned about getting her first paycheck sooner rather than later.

"I've already taken care of your employment paperwork," Ethan replied as he sat down, pouring himself a glass of water. "Don't worry, you'll get paid this month."

Emma sighed, plopping down onto the couch. "But acting like we're madly in love is exhausting."

A mischievous thought crossed her mind. If ever there was a time to negotiate, it was now. With a sly grin, she took Ethan's cup, refilled it, and handed it back to him. "Can we talk about something?"

Ethan looked at her, curiosity piqued by the twinkle in her eyes. "Go ahead."

"Staying here was your idea, so shouldn’t there be some compensation for me?" Emma suggested, her voice a little uncertain, eyes darting away briefly.

"Oh? What do you have in mind? Anything but shares, and I can make it happen," Ethan said, intrigued.

Emma hesitated, a bit frustrated that Ethan seemed to see right through her. "Fine, I won’t ask for shares, but I want money."

Ethan chuckled, amused by her straightforwardness. "How much are we talking?"

"Half a million," Emma stated boldly, taking a sip from her glass.

Ethan's smile widened as he stood up. "I'll give you three hundred thousand now, and if you behave, I'll give you the rest when we get back."

Emma thought for a moment, eyeing Ethan skeptically. "To be safe, why don't you transfer it now?"

Ethan pulled out his phone, offering it to her. "Enter your account details."

Emma quickly typed in the numbers, handing the phone back. "Done."

Ethan transferred the money and handed the phone back to her. "There you go."

Emma checked her account balance, grinning from ear to ear. "It's there."

"Alright, you'll get the rest later," Ethan said, heading towards the bathroom.

"Don't back out!" Emma called after him, her voice carrying a hint of playfulness.

As she lounged on the couch, she couldn't hide her delight. Despite being a Thomas heiress, she had never had so much money to herself. Her thoughts drifted to the complex dynamics of the household. "Seems like Aunt and Eleanor Murphy don't get along. I wonder whose side Mrs. Clark is on."

Fatigue from the morning's journey took over, and Emma drifted into a deep sleep.

Ethan emerged from the bathroom, hair damp, a towel slung over his shoulders. He approached the couch to find Emma fast asleep. Smiling, he gently scooped her up.

As he carried her to the bed, Emma mumbled sleepily, "Don't go," her face etched with worry.

Ethan's heart softened at her words. He laid her down, removed her shoes, and tucked her in, gazing at her with a tender smile. Unable to resist, he kissed her forehead and gently stroked her hair before starting to leave.

But Emma, still asleep, clutched his hand tightly. "Mom, don't go. Don't leave me," she murmured, pulling him back down beside her.

Ethan sat there, stroking her hair. "You're missing your mom," he whispered softly.

He watched over her until she awoke, startled to find herself in bed, clutching his hand. "How did I end up here? Wasn't I on the couch?"

Ethan stirred awake, smiling at her. "Did I carry you to bed? Yeah."

Emma looked at him, his sleepy expression endearing. "Your arm must be numb. Let me help."

She started massaging his arm, concern etched on her face. "Feeling better?"

"Much," Ethan replied, watching as Emma returned to the couch.

He followed her, sitting down with a curious look. "Did you have a nightmare?"

Emma shot him a surprised look. "How did you know?"

"You were talking in your sleep," Ethan said with a teasing grin.

"What did I say?" Emma asked, eyes wide with anxiety.

Ethan paused for a moment, then teased, "You were telling a tiger not to bite you."

Emma squinted at him, realizing he was messing with her. "You're teasing me!"

Ethan chuckled, standing up. "Come on, let's take a walk in the garden."

"Do I have to?" Emma asked, a bit hesitant.

"Remember, you took my money," Ethan reminded her with a smirk.

Emma sighed, realizing she had agreed to play along. "Alright, let's go."

As they left the room, a housekeeper named Snow greeted them. "Where are you two headed?"

Ethan replied casually, "Just showing Emma around the place. No need to follow us."

Once outside, Emma whispered to Ethan, "Do all the staff keep such close tabs on everyone?"

Ethan wrapped an arm around her, leaning close to whisper, "This is Grandma's place, not ours. Lots of eyes around."

And with that, they stepped into the garden, the intricacies of their pretend relationship unfolding one step at a time.
