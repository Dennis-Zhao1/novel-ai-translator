Ethan Clark adjusted his mood, flashing a smile as he looked at Emma Thomas. He didn't want to bring any negative vibes home, and Emma could see right through him. She walked behind him, gently massaging his temples. "There's nothing we can't get through," she said softly. "Look at me—I made it through, didn't I?"

Ethan was a bit startled by her tenderness, pulling her into his embrace. "I'm sorry," he murmured, gazing into her eyes. 

Emma was puzzled, "Why are you apologizing?" she asked, curious about his sudden confession.

He took a deep breath, "Back then, I wasn't respectful or understanding enough. I pushed you too hard." His arms tightened around her.

Reflecting on the past, Emma recalled how annoying he used to be. But that very annoyance had sparked her curiosity and eventually led her to fall for him. Who knows what her life would be like now if it weren't for him?

She freed her arms, wrapping them around his neck instead. "If it weren't for who you were back then, we wouldn't be here now," she smiled, looking down at him.

Ethan's spirits lifted at her words. The past was behind them, and it seemed fate had brought them together. "Let's eat? Everything will pass, don't worry," Emma suggested, moving to stand up, but Ethan held her back.

"So, does this mean I get the promotion?" he teased gently, looking up at her.

Emma blushed, her hands fidgeting. "W-What are you talking about?" she stammered, pretending not to understand.

"You said we'd give it a try. I'm ready for the real deal now." He pulled her closer, his eyes soft and full of warmth.

Emma's heart raced, and she averted her gaze, too shy to meet his eyes. Ethan leaned in, placing a gentle, gentlemanly kiss on her lips. She found herself melting into him, responding to his kiss with a warmth that spread throughout her being.

Just as they were lost in each other, a knock on the door startled them. Emma quickly pulled away, adjusting her collar. "Dinner is ready," Grace Gonzalez called from the other side.

"We're coming," Ethan replied, grinning at Emma as she straightened her clothes. They exchanged a smile, the moment not lost between them.

"Let's go," Emma said shyly, standing beside him.

"This time, it was mutual," Ethan chuckled, getting up and taking her hand as they headed downstairs.

As they reached the dining room, Ethan held Emma's hand tightly, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth. "All my favorites," she exclaimed, eyeing the spread on the table.

Grace Gonzalez brought out another dish. "Mr. Clark had everything prepared for you," she said, glancing at Ethan.

"He's not great with words, but he cares deeply," Grace added, placing the dish on the table.

Emma looked from the food to Ethan, surprise and affection in her gaze. He simply smiled back without saying much. Ethan pulled out a chair for her, and they settled in.

Ethan started peeling a shrimp, and Emma noticed he hadn't served her first like he usually did. Feeling a bit skeptical, she reached for her chopsticks just as Ethan offered her the peeled shrimp.

"Try this," he smiled, holding it up to her.

I was overthinking it. 

"You should eat too," she said, watching him peel another shrimp.

"You little foodie, eat up," Ethan chuckled, peeling more shrimp.

Emma laughed, but a piece of food went down the wrong way, and she coughed. "You okay? Slow down," Ethan said, concerned.

“Why do you call me that?” she asked, curious about his playful nickname.

Ethan leaned closer, whispering, "You looked like a little kitten, clinging to my neck."

Her cheeks flushed red, and she quickly looked away, embarrassed.

"Shy now?" he teased, noticing her evasive gaze.

"Can you be serious for a minute?" she mumbled, focusing on her food and avoiding his eyes.

"Alright, I won't tease you," Ethan relented, serving her a bowl of chicken soup.

"Drink some soup," he said gently, and they continued eating.

"So, what time do you usually go to bed?" Emma asked, remembering a conversation from earlier on social media.

Ethan paused, "If I'm not busy, around 1 AM. Busy nights, maybe 3 or 4 AM."

"That late?" Emma was surprised. "And when do you wake up?"

"Usually around 7 AM," he replied.

"Why, planning to join me tonight?" he asked, his eyes twinkling mischievously.

The evening continued with warmth and banter, a testament to their journey from past misunderstandings to a present filled with understanding and affection.
