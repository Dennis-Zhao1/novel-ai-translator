**Ethan Clark and Emma Thomas's First Encounter**

The late afternoon sun streamed through the windows of Emma Thomas’s small apartment as she dozed off on her worn-out couch. The soft hum of the city outside was interrupted by the sharp, insistent ring of her phone. Groggily, she fumbled for it on the coffee table, squinting at the screen before answering.

“Hello?” she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

“Emma, it’s Sophia Wright,” came the familiar cheerful voice on the other end. “There’s an event tomorrow evening at the Woodside Hotel. Mr. Chen specifically requested you as the host and outside coordinator. He felt bad about canceling on you last time, so this is his way of making it up. Are you available?”

Emma blinked a few times, now fully awake. “Tomorrow night? I think I can manage. What’s the pay?”

“Four hundred for the event, and it’s a big one—a matchmaking party,” Sophia explained, her voice tinged with excitement. “It’s a pretty high-profile gig. Good exposure for you.”

Emma hesitated. “Matchmaking party? I’ve never hosted one of those before.”

“Relax! It’s the same as any other event—just with slightly more awkward small talk,” Sophia teased. “I’ll send you the details, along with Mr. Chen’s number in case you have questions.”

“Alright, send it over. Thanks, Sophia.”

“You got it. Talk soon!” Sophia hung up, leaving Emma staring at her phone, a small smile tugging at her lips. Another gig meant more money—a step closer to her goals.

For as long as Emma could remember, she had been fending for herself. Her mother had passed away suddenly when Emma was just four, leaving her father, Oliver Thomas, to manage both his grief and his responsibilities. Within six months, he had remarried his secretary, Samantha Williams. A year later, they had a daughter, Ava, and Oliver’s attention shifted entirely to his new family.

Emma had spent most of her childhood being raised by her grandmother, with little more than an occasional phone call from her father. Samantha, her stepmother, was cold and indifferent, making it clear that Emma was an inconvenience. By the time she was a teenager, Emma had developed a fierce independence. Her part-time jobs weren’t just a necessity—they were a way of carving out her own path.

Her ultimate dream was to save enough to move her grandmother and uncle into the city with her. The house her mother had left her was more a keepsake than a real option for financial relief—it was her last link to a happier time. Selling it wasn’t something she could bring herself to do.

The next afternoon, Emma’s phone buzzed with a text from Sophia. The event was scheduled for 6 PM at the Woodside Hotel on the 9th floor. Emma immediately got to work, jotting down notes and preparing for her role as the evening’s host.

Friday arrived, and the city was bathed in golden light as Emma rushed out of her last class. She was running late and could already feel her nerves kicking in. Waving down a cab, she climbed in and gave the driver her destination.

“Woodside Hotel, please. I’m in a bit of a hurry,” she said, fastening her seatbelt.

“Got it,” the driver replied, weaving deftly through traffic.

Minutes later, they pulled up to the grand entrance of the Woodside Hotel. Emma handed over a few bills, grabbed her bag, and dashed inside. She didn’t notice the man stepping out of a black sedan at the same time. In her hurry, she collided with him just inside the entrance, sending her notebook and event program scattering across the polished marble floor.

“I’m so sorry!” she blurted out, crouching down to gather her papers. 

The man bent down to help her. “It’s fine,” he said smoothly, his deep voice sending a jolt through her. When their eyes met, Emma was momentarily caught off guard. He was tall, with strikingly handsome features—strong jawline, sharp cheekbones, and piercing dark eyes that seemed to see right through her.

“Emma Thomas?” he read aloud from one of the scattered papers, his brow arching in curiosity.

“That’s me,” Emma said, quickly taking the paper from his hand. “And you are…?”

The man hesitated for a moment, then handed her the rest of her notes without answering. “Be careful next time,” he said, standing up and straightening his blazer.

Emma frowned slightly, watching him walk away toward the elevators. She shook her head and hurried toward the event space. “What a strange guy,” she muttered under her breath.

The same man was waiting for the elevator when Emma arrived. She stepped in beside him, her curiosity getting the better of her. “So, you know my name, but I didn’t catch yours.”

He glanced at her, a faint smirk on his lips. “Ethan,” he said simply. “What floor?”

“Ninth,” she replied, watching as he pressed the button. “Ethan who?”

“Does it matter?” he replied, his tone teasing.

Emma crossed her arms, both amused and annoyed. “You’re a bit mysterious for someone who’s reading my personal details off my paperwork.”

Ethan chuckled but didn’t respond. The elevator dinged, and he stepped out without another word, leaving Emma to puzzle over him as she walked into the bustling event space.

By 6 PM, the matchmaking party was in full swing. The ballroom on the ninth floor had been transformed into an elegant venue, with soft lighting and floral arrangements adorning the tables. Emma, now dressed in a sleek white gown, took the stage.

“Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,” she began, her voice ringing clear and confident. “Welcome to tonight’s matchmaking event, where connections are made, and sparks might just fly.”

From a corner of the room, Ethan Clark watched her with mild amusement. He had decided to check out the event after all, his curiosity piqued by their earlier encounter. Seeing her on stage, he was struck by how different she seemed now—poised, professional, and entirely in her element.

For a brief moment, Ethan allowed himself to admire her. He had attended countless events like this, but Emma’s genuine energy set her apart. Still, his reason for being here wasn’t purely out of curiosity. He had recognized her name from his family’s discussions. Emma Thomas—the woman his parents were trying to push him to marry. 

By the time the event wrapped up, Ethan had slipped out, content to keep his presence unknown for now.

Emma was exhausted but satisfied as she gathered her belongings. The event had gone off without a hitch, and she couldn’t help but feel proud of her work. As she waited outside for a cab, she couldn’t stop thinking about the enigmatic Ethan. 

“Who is he, really?” she wondered aloud as the city lights twinkled around her. Little did she know, their paths were about to cross again—and this time, it wouldn’t be by chance.
