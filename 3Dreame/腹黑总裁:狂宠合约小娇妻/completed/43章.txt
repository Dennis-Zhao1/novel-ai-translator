Returning to Evergreen City

Emma Thomas and Ethan Clark hit the road early, cruising for about three hours before finally pulling up to the grand entrance of a lavish mansion. 

“Mom, Dad, we’re back,” Ethan announced, gently guiding Emma by the hand as they stepped into the opulent living room.

“Ethan, Emma! You’re home!” Mrs. Xu greeted them warmly, rushing forward to embrace them.

“Mom, Dad,” Emma said softly, acknowledging their presence.

“Come in, come in, have a seat,” Mrs. Xu ushered Emma to the plush sofa.

“Mom, this is a gift Emma picked out just for you,” Ethan said, presenting a carefully wrapped package to Mrs. Xu.

“Oh, you didn’t need to bring a gift, just having you here is enough,” she said, smiling as she accepted it. “You must be hungry! We’ll eat soon.”

“Ethan, how’s everything going at the branch office?” Mr. Xu asked, his tone serious, eager to hear about his son’s progress.

“Dad, everything’s running smoothly. Our collaboration with Michael Young is becoming more solid,” Ethan replied, matching his father’s seriousness.

“Alright, alright, our son’s home for a rare visit, let’s not talk business,” Mrs. Xu interjected, pulling Emma towards the dining room.

“Okay, okay, let’s eat,” Mr. Xu agreed, leading everyone to the table.

“Come, sit down,” Mrs. Xu invited them to take their seats.

Ethan courteously pulled out a chair for Emma before sitting beside her.

“Try these shrimp, flown in from North America,” Mrs. Xu suggested, nodding towards the platter.

Ethan picked up a shrimp with serving tongs, peeled it, and held it up to Emma’s mouth. “Have a taste,” he coaxed.

Emma blushed slightly, taking a bite and accidentally brushing his fingers with her lips. She glanced up at Ethan.

“How is it?” he asked with a smile.

“Delicious,” Emma replied, smiling back at Mrs. Xu.

“Good, good. Ethan, you’ve become quite considerate since getting married. Makes me happy,” Mrs. Xu said, clearly pleased.

“Yes, he’s maturing. Emma, you’ll have to help keep him in line,” Mr. Xu joked, taking a bite of his meal.

Emma blushed and focused on her food, feeling a bit shy.

Ethan looked at her, “Mom, Dad, Emma and I truly love each other, and I intend to treat her well.”

“That’s what matters,” Mrs. Xu said, placing a piece of rib in Emma’s bowl.

“Thank you, Mom,” Emma smiled at Mrs. Xu.

“Emma, after dinner, join me for some shopping. We need to pick up a few gifts for your grandmother,” Mrs. Xu suggested happily.

“Mom, we’ve already taken care of the gifts. Don’t worry,” Ethan assured her.

“Who did you prepare gifts for?” Mrs. Xu asked curiously.

“For Grandma, Uncle Jack’s family, and Aunt Lily’s family. We’ve thought of everyone,” Ethan explained.

“Did you hear? That woman’s pregnant with Uncle Jack’s child. She’s been causing a scene. Grandma’s already given her a room in the guest house,” Mrs. Xu remarked, looking at them.

“Eleanor Murphy agreed?” Ethan asked, his tone icy.

“What choice does she have? Grandma’s made her decision,” Mrs. Xu replied, nudging Mr. Xu. “All you men are the same.”

Mr. Xu awkwardly patted her arm, “That’s them, dear. I’m devoted to you,” he said, then turned to Ethan with a chuckle.

“And you, now that you’re married to Emma, no fooling around,” Mr. Xu warned, his expression stern.

“Don’t worry, I only love her,” Ethan declared, turning to Emma and gently taking her hand.

Emma’s cheeks flushed as she thought to herself, “He sure knows how to put on a show.”

“Emma, how’s the meal?” Mrs. Xu asked kindly.

Emma felt a bit awkward, but smiled, “I’m full, thank you.”

“Let’s go then, the store closes soon,” Mrs. Xu said, getting up from the table. Ethan jumped up, “Mom, I’ll drive you.”

Emma quickly stood, as Ethan wrapped an arm around her waist, “I’ll come along and help carry things.”

“Alright, you just can’t stay away from Emma,” Mrs. Xu teased, happily heading towards the door.

Ethan kept his arm around Emma as they followed her out.

“It’s just a mile ahead, drive carefully,” Mrs. Xu instructed as they settled into the car.

Ethan parked outside a luxury boutique, and they all got out.

Mrs. Xu linked arms with Emma, leading her inside while Ethan trailed behind, feeling a bit like the third wheel, but amused nonetheless.

“Mrs. Xu, welcome!” the sales associate greeted them warmly.

“The bags you reserved are here. Let me show you to them,” the associate said, guiding them to the counter.

“Let’s go,” Mrs. Xu responded.

“This is the large handbag you ordered. I’ll fetch the smaller one now,” the associate said, handing the large bag to Mrs. Xu before heading off.

“Emma, what do you think of this one?” Mrs. Xu asked, holding up the bag.

Emma examined it, “It’s beautiful. I haven’t seen anyone else with this style yet.”

“Mrs. Xu, here’s the small handbag. Have a look,” the associate returned, presenting the smaller bag.

“I’ll take both, please,” Mrs. Xu decided, handing them back to the associate.

“Here you are, Mrs. Xu,” the associate said, handing over the wrapped bags. Ethan stepped forward to take them.

They all piled back into the car, ready to head home.

“Ethan, pass me the bags,” Mrs. Xu instructed from the back seat.

Ethan handed the package to her, watching as she pulled out the large handbag and handed it to Emma.

“Emma, I thought this design matched your style perfectly,” Mrs. Xu said, beaming.

Emma was surprised and tried to decline, “Mom, this is too much. I can’t accept it.”

“We’re family, it’s not too much. Please, take it,” Mrs. Xu insisted, placing it on Emma’s lap.

Emma looked up at Ethan in the front seat. He caught her eyes in the mirror, “Emma, accept it. It’s a gift from Mom.”

“Alright, thank you, Mom,” Emma said, holding the bag and smiling at Mrs. Xu.
