Congratulations on Graduating

The next afternoon, in the sleek office of the CEO of Ling Corporation, a conversation was taking place.

"Ethan, how's everything on your end?" Michael Young asked, handing Ethan Clark a cup of coffee.

"Michael, I sent you the proposal for the Ferris Wheel project. We're still short on funds by a bit," Ethan replied, taking the coffee and sitting down on the plush sofa.

Michael chuckled, "You're the heir to the Clark Group in Greenfield, and you're worried about such a small amount?"

Ethan smiled, "Don't tease me. When I set up the branch, my father didn't plan on investing much. That's why I'm turning to you for help."

"You were thinking about acquiring Thomas Group, right? After the acquisition, you could sell off some shares to solve the funding issue," Michael suggested.

Ethan furrowed his eyebrows, setting down his coffee. "Michael, you know my wife is Oliver Thomas's daughter. I'm trying to win her favor by acquiring Thomas Group."

Michael looked at Ethan, shaking his head with a smile. "You sly dog." With a mutual understanding reached, Ethan left the office and drove home.

"Mr. Clark, you're back," Grace Gonzalez greeted him at the door, taking his coat.

"Where's Emma?" Ethan asked, loosening his tie.

"She's in the backyard," Grace replied, heading to the kitchen to get him a glass of water.

Ethan took the water and headed towards the backyard, where he found Emma Thomas lounging on a swing with oversized glasses, her hair in a messy bun, sketching on a small pad.

He approached quietly from behind, peering over her shoulder at the sketch. "What brings you to the backyard?"

Emma, startled, clutched her sketchpad to her chest. "When did you get back?"

"Seems like you're quite the artist," Ethan remarked, sitting on a nearby stone bench.

Emma glanced at him, contemplating whether to leave. "You're home; you can be wherever you want."

He continued, "Your environment sketch really captures the essence here."

Surprised, Emma paused. "You know about art?"

"A bit," he replied.

"By the way, when's your graduation ceremony?" Ethan asked.

She hesitated, unsure if she should tell him. Seeing her reluctance, he pressed, "Hmm?"

"Tuesday afternoon," she mumbled.

"Great, I'll come by the school then," Ethan said, standing up to leave.

Emma felt a hint of nervousness. What was he planning? But she knew once he decided on something, there was no changing his mind.

The day of the graduation ceremony arrived quickly. Ethan parked outside the library, calling Emma.

"Hey, I'm here."

"Where... are you?" Emma stammered.

"Library."

"I'll come find you," Emma said before hanging up and leaving her classroom.

Spotting his car from a distance, she jogged over. "Park over there," she gestured to a nearby spot.

After parking, he joined her, and she instructed, "Remember to say you're my boyfriend."

Ethan nodded, "Got it."

At the ceremony, Emma searched for her classmates in the crowd.

"Emma, over here!" Sophia Wright called, waving enthusiastically.

Emma spotted her and carefully navigated through the crowd to join her.

"Finally! It's about to start," Sophia said, making room for them to sit.

"You go first," Emma told Ethan, letting him take the inner seat before sitting beside him.

The ceremony commenced with speeches from the principal and faculty, while students exchanged tearful goodbyes.

"Emma, is it our turn soon?" Sophia asked excitedly.

"Yeah, we should get ready," Emma replied, preparing to leave. She glanced at Ethan, "I have a performance, so I'll head over there."

Ethan watched her go, surprised by her unexpected performance.

Next up, the host announced, "This next song is a graduation classic. Let's welcome the Computer Science department with 'My Classmate.'"

A group of students hurried onstage, and Ethan's eyes immediately found Emma. Though not in the spotlight, she shone brightly, captivating his gaze.

As the ceremony wound down, students began to leave. Ethan grabbed Emma's arm gently, "Wait a second."

"Sophia, you head back to the dorm. I'll go home later," Emma told her friend, who waved goodbye.

With the venue almost empty, Ethan stood, "Let's go."

Emma followed him to the car. He opened the passenger door for her before retrieving a bouquet from the trunk and getting in.

"Congratulations on graduating!" Ethan handed her the flowers.

Emma stared, stunned. She'd never received flowers from a guy before, her face frozen in disbelief.

"Take them," Ethan insisted, placing them in her arms.

"Oh, thanks," she muttered awkwardly.

Ethan glanced at her, "No need to thank me," and started the car.

Emma, clutching the bouquet, imagined scenes from TV dramas. Did he like her? Was he just trying to make a better deal with the Thomas Group? But she wasn't of any value to him now, was she?

"You know, giving flowers isn't something you do lightly," she said tentatively.

Ethan was silent for a moment before replying, "You're not just anyone." The silence hung between them until he added, "Today, I'm celebrating your graduation."

Emma watched him drive, "Thanks."
