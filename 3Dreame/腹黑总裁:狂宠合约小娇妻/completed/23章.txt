Thanks, Ethan Clark

It was a rainy morning, and Emma Thomas was still in dreamland when her phone started buzzing incessantly. 

"Mmm... Mmm..." Emma groaned, stretching her hand towards the nightstand to grab her phone.

"Hello," she answered in a sleepy voice, slowly opening her eyes.

"Emma, how's that thing I asked you about going?" The familiar voice on the other end instantly woke her up. She sat up straight, clutching the phone tightly.

Her eyes darted to the screen, confirming it was indeed him.

"Dad, he doesn't bring work home," Emma explained, trying to keep her voice steady.

"Then I'll have to stop your uncle's treatment," he said curtly before hanging up.

"Dad... I..." Emma's words trailed off, realizing the call had already ended. She held the phone in her hand for a moment, deep in thought, before dialing another number.

"Hello," came the slightly distorted voice on the other end.

"Hey, Ethan Clark," Emma said urgently, trying to keep her composure.

"Do you remember the contract we signed last time?"

"What's up?"

"My uncle's situation... it's moved up. He just called me," Emma said, her voice catching with emotion as tears welled up in her eyes. She held them back.

"Don't worry, I'll take care of it," Ethan reassured her, having picked up on the distress in her voice.

"Have you had breakfast yet?" he asked, smoothly changing the subject.

"Not yet," she replied softly, glancing at the clock. It was almost 8 AM, and she was already late for class.

"I'm late."

"Grab some breakfast and head to school. Leave your uncle's situation to me."

"Okay." Emma hung up and quickly headed to the bathroom to get ready for the day.

After Ethan ended the call, he thought for a moment before dialing another number. "Hey, Daniel Johnson, how's that thing I mentioned last time?"

"Ethan, everything's arranged. We can proceed with the hospital admission anytime."

"Thanks," Ethan said, hanging up as he tossed his breakfast aside and grabbed his jacket to head to the office.

Later that morning, after class, Emma walked to the cafeteria with her friend, Sophia Wright. "Emma, I haven't seen Ethan Clark dropping you off lately. It's been some stranger," Sophia commented with a curious look.

Emma gave her a knowing glance. "He's back in Green City."

"Then who's been driving you?" Sophia pressed, linking arms with Emma as they walked.

"That's Ethan's good friend. Ethan asked him to give me a ride."

Sophia's eyes sparkled with envy. "Wow, he really cares about you. Even when he's not around, he makes sure his friend looks after you. He must really like you."

Emma forced a smile, knowing the truth was far from what Sophia imagined. "We're just under contract, Sophia. There's no real affection involved."

"Emma, can we eat on the second floor today? I'm craving their wontons," Sophia begged, tugging on Emma's sleeve.

Unable to resist Sophia's pleading, Emma relented. They headed to the second floor of the cafeteria, ordered wontons and dumplings, and just as Emma was about to dig in, her phone rang.

"Mmm... Mmm..." Emma fished her phone out of her bag.

"Is that the devil?" Sophia exclaimed, dropping her dumpling back into her bowl in surprise.

Emma shot her a look, putting a finger to her lips to shush her. "Hello," she said, setting aside her wonton.

"Hey, have you had lunch yet?" came the concerned voice from the other end.

"Just about to."

"What are you eating today?" Ethan's persistence was evident.

"Is there something you needed?" Emma attempted to steer the conversation, hoping he'd get to the point.

Sensing her urgency, Ethan didn't beat around the bush. "It's done."

"The transfer for my uncle?" Emma asked, her voice filled with hope.

"Yes, send me your uncle's current hospital address, and I'll arrange the transfer."

"Okay, I'll send it to you. Please don't let my dad find out, or it'll be difficult to proceed," Emma cautioned him.

Ethan understood. "I got it." He knew if Emma's father, Oliver Thomas, found out, he wouldn't allow the transfer, as it was his leverage over Emma.

Emma set her phone down, ready to finish her call, but paused to say, "Thank you, Ethan Clark."

Hearing her gratitude, Ethan couldn't help but smile a little.

"Emma, is your uncle getting transferred?" Sophia asked, having overheard the conversation.

"Yeah, he's helping me out," Emma replied.

Sophia leaned in closer, whispering, "He's so good to you. Why do you have him saved as 'the devil'?"

Emma rolled her eyes and pushed Sophia's head gently away. "He's not as nice as you think. He's got a dark side."

"Dark side? How so?" Sophia persisted.

Emma wasn't ready to share the details of her contract marriage with Ethan, so she kept it vague.

"Alright, if you don't eat soon, I'll finish all this food myself," Emma teased, eyeing Sophia's dumplings and wontons.

Sophia, still hungry, decided to drop the subject. "No way, I haven't even started."

Emma received a text, confirming the arrangements for her uncle's transfer. A weight lifted off her shoulders, knowing that once the transfer was complete, her father would lose his hold over her, and she'd be free from the clutches of the Thomas family. The thought brought her immense relief.

"Thanks," Emma typed out in a message before pausing and replacing it with, "Thank you, Ethan Clark."

Hitting send, Emma felt a sense of peace as she sipped her wonton soup.

"Emma, you must be starving. Are you sure you've had enough? I have some left," Sophia offered.

Emma looked at Sophia, smiling brightly. "I'm good, thanks."

"Then let's head back to the dorm. We've got some time before afternoon classes," Sophia suggested, resting her head on Emma's shoulder affectionately.

"How about we grab some iced treats from the back street first?" Emma suggested, glancing at Sophia with a playful look.

"Iced treats? Yes, please! We haven't had those in ages. It's so hot out; we definitely need to cool down. Let's go!" Sophia excitedly pulled Emma along as they made their way to the back street.
