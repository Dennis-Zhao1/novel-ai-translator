The next morning, Emma Thomas woke up early and glanced at Ethan Clark, who was still asleep beside her. "He's got a handsome face, smooth features, and such nice skin. What a pity," she thought to herself, amused by the irony.

Unable to resist, Emma reached out and gently touched his cheek. "It's so soft," she whispered to herself, marveling at how smooth his skin felt.

Ethan slowly opened his eyes, catching her in the act. "Is my face that fun to play with?" he asked, a teasing smile playing on his lips.

Emma recoiled her hand quickly, caught off guard. "I...," she stammered, unable to finish her sentence as she hastily got out of bed. "I'll just get ready for breakfast," she said, trying to change the subject.

Ethan watched her hurry away, a grin spreading across his face. He got up, stretching lazily before heading to the bathroom.

"Good morning, Mom and Dad," Ethan greeted as he descended the stairs, holding Emma's hand.

"Come on, breakfast is ready," Mrs. Clark called them over to the dining table.

Mrs. Clark looked at Emma warmly, asking, "Emma, did you sleep well?"

Emma smiled back, "I slept great, Mom."

Ethan chimed in, "Of course she did, with me beside her," pulling out a chair for Emma with a playful wink.

After breakfast, Ethan and Emma hopped into the car and drove away from the villa. As they drove for about half an hour, Emma started looking pale. She glanced at Ethan, "How much longer?"

Ethan noticed her discomfort. "Are you feeling okay?" he asked, concerned.

"I... not really," Emma admitted, clutching her stomach.

"We're almost at a rest stop. Just hang in there," Ethan reassured her, handing her a water bottle.

Emma's discomfort grew, and she leaned back in her seat, silent. Ethan had a hunch about what was going on.

Finally, they reached the rest stop. "Wait here for a sec," Ethan said, hopping out of the car and heading into a store. He returned with a black bag shortly after.

"Here, take this," Ethan said, opening Emma's door and placing the bag on her lap. Seeing her discomfort made him uneasy.

Emma peeked inside the bag and blushed, "You bought this?"

"First time," Ethan replied, ready to help her out of the car.

"How did you... know I needed..." Emma stammered, embarrassed.

"I'll wait for you outside," Ethan said, escorting her to the restroom.

After what seemed like forever, Emma emerged, relieved that her clothes were still clean. "Let's go," she said, feeling awkward as she caught Ethan's eye.

"You go ahead," Ethan said, watching her head to the car before he ducked into a convenience store. He returned with a thermos and a packet of brown sugar.

"Here you go," Ethan said, handing her the thermos as he got back in the car.

Emma was surprised. "You bought a thermos?"

"Drink some warm water; it might help," Ethan said gently, unscrewing the cap and offering it to her.

Emma took a sip, only to pull back quickly. "Ow, it's hot."

"Careful," Ethan said, amused at her reaction.

After a cautious sip, Emma realized, "It's brown sugar water."

"Thought it might help; I heard itâ€™s good for this time of the month," Ethan explained, handing her the lid as they prepared to hit the road again.

Emma felt a wave of gratitude. "He's so thoughtful," she thought, glancing at Ethan.

"How much longer?" Emma asked, breaking the silence.

"Almost there, about fifteen more minutes," Ethan replied, glancing at her warmly. "Try to rest a bit."

"Okay," Emma nodded, closing her eyes for a nap.

After about an hour, they finally arrived at the impressive Clark estate nestled halfway up a hillside. Emma blinked in awe at the grand sight.

"This is..." she began, stepping out of the car and looking at Ethan, unsure how to express her amazement.

"This is where we used to live. We come back here every year for a bit, especially now that we're married. Grandma wants to spend some time with the family and get to know you better," Ethan explained, wrapping an arm around her.

"It's huge," Emma exclaimed.

"Let's go," Ethan said, guiding her toward the entrance.

"Young Master, you're back!" Linda Williams, the housekeeper, greeted Ethan warmly.

"And this must be the young mistress. She's truly beautiful," Linda commented, making Emma blush slightly.

"Linda, where's Grandma?" Ethan asked, pausing to chat.

"She's in the back garden, waiting for you two. We've been looking forward to having lunch together," Linda said, leading the way.

"Let's go," Ethan said, keeping Emma close.

As they walked into the garden filled with a distinct traditional charm, they spotted a group chatting on the sofas. Ethan called out, "Grandma," as he and Emma approached.

"You're back, Ethan and Emma!" Grandma exclaimed, waving them over happily.

"Eleanor Murphy, long time no see," Ethan greeted, nodding to his aunt.

"Hello, Grandma. Hi, Eleanor," Emma greeted shyly.

"Emma, come sit with Grandma," Grandma said, beaming as she invited Emma to join her.

Emma sat beside Grandma, who took her hand gently. "Emma, are you doing okay? Is Ethan treating you well?"

Emma glanced at Ethan, their eyes meeting briefly. "He's been wonderful, Grandma."

"If he ever gives you trouble, you come to me. I'll set things right," Grandma said, giving Ethan a playful look.

"Don't worry, Grandma. Emma and I are great together. I'll take good care of her," Ethan assured, patting Emma's shoulder as they shared a smile.
