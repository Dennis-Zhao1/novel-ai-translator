Emma Thomas fidgeted nervously, her hands clasped tightly as she stared at the ground. 

"We're married, no need for thanks," Ethan Clark said with a smile. 

Emma, I like you.

Were these real feelings or just part of the game? Emma pondered this for a long time. She felt herself becoming increasingly reliant on Ethan, but she still couldn't fully trust his kindness toward her. Over time, she'd sensed his feelings, but the truth of them remained elusive.

"Let's go home," Ethan said gently, giving Emma's arm a comforting pat. 

Surprised by how quickly they arrived, Emma looked up to find they were already at their doorstep. Stepping inside, they were greeted by Grace Gonzalez, who beamed at their return. "Welcome home, Mr. and Mrs. Clark," she said warmly. 

"It's scorching today. Why don't you two sit down while I grab some drinks?" Grace offered, heading toward the kitchen.

As Emma settled onto the couch, Ethan joined her, noticing the beads of sweat on her forehead. He pulled out a tissue and gently dabbed her face. "It's a scorcher today, hasn't been this hot in ages."

Emma, a bit flustered, snatched the tissue from his hand. "I can do it myself," she mumbled, offering a shy smile. Ethan chuckled and let the matter drop.

"Mr. and Mrs. Clark, I've got some new desserts for you to try," Grace announced, bringing over bowls of sweet treats and drinks. Emma's eyes lit up, and she eagerly dug into the dessert.

"Grace, this is amazing! I haven't tasted anything this good in ages," she exclaimed, savoring the treat.

Ethan watched Emma with a fond smile. "If you like it, you can have it every day," he said teasingly.

Emma laughed, glancing over at Ethan. "I can't eat sweets every day; I'll gain weight."

"That's fine," Ethan replied with a grin. "You're too skinny anyway. I want to fatten you up a bit."

Emma rolled her eyes. "Typical, you don't understand girls at all."

Grace chimed in, "I found this new dessert shop by accident. The flavors are excellent. I thought you'd like it, Mrs. Clark, so I went over early this morning to pick some up."

"Thank you, Grace," Emma said, happy and focused on her dessert.

"Mr. Clark was the one who suggested it. I'm just the messenger," Grace laughed, heading out to the backyard.

Emma looked at Ethan in surprise. "You? When did you plan all this?"

"Just enjoy," Ethan replied, a small smile playing on his lips.

"How did you know I'd like this particular dessert?" Emma wondered aloud. They'd only been married a short time, and she hadn't shared her preference for less sweet, more natural flavors.

"You're my wife. Of course I'd know," Ethan said softly, his eyes warm with an unspoken promise.

Emma felt a strange mix of emotions. Could she really trust him? Was this another ploy? She shook her head slightly, unsure.

Ethan seemed to sense her hesitation. "Don't worry. You can take your time," he assured her quietly.

Was he serious? Or was there some hidden agenda? Emma couldn't help but wonder.

"I... I need some time," she admitted softly.

He nodded, understanding. "I'll wait."

Ethan held her close, his mind racing with thoughts of how to make amends for the past and build a future together.
