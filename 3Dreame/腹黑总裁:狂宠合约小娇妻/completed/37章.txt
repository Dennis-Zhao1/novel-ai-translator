In a cozy bedroom, Ethan Clark tried to comfort Emma Thomas with a gentle touch on her arm, but she brushed him off defiantly. With a sigh, Ethan retreated to the bathroom, leaving Emma alone on the bed. Her tears silently traced a path from the corner of her eye to her lips as she seethed with anger towards Ethan, contemplating her next move for revenge.

After a few moments, Ethan emerged from the bathroom. Emma, now dressed in her pajamas, was about to head to the bathroom herself when Ethan caught her arm. "Join me for a late-night snack downstairs," he suggested, but she shook him off and hurried into the bathroom.

Under the shower, Emma scrubbed her skin vigorously, as if trying to cleanse herself of the night's events. Meanwhile, Ethan noticed a stain on the pristine white sheets and discreetly instructed a housekeeper to change them. As he descended the stairs, he asked Grace Gonzalez, the housekeeper, to prepare some desserts. A glass of honey water in hand, he pondered his actions and the regret that gnawed at him. He knew he needed to make things right with Emma, but she was likely too upset to join him.

Determined to mend things, Ethan carried two plates of dessert upstairs. "Have something to eat," he coaxed, placing the treats on the bedside table. Emma lay curled up, her face a portrait of anger and hurt.

When she didn't respond, Ethan crouched beside her, trying to catch her eye. "Hmm?" he prompted gently, hoping she'd acknowledge him.

Emma remained silent, but Ethan, ever persistent, resorted to a distasteful tactic. "If you don't eat, forget about getting any shares from Group Thomas," he threatened.

Her eyes snapped to his, fury blazing, but after a moment's thought, she sat up and began to eat the pastry with a fierce determination, glaring at him all the while. "That's better," Ethan murmured, attempting to reach out and stroke her hair. She flinched away, her voice sharp, "Don't touch me."

Ethan withdrew his hand, watching her with a lingering gentleness as she finished the snack and lay back down. "Have some more?" he offered, holding out a minty macaron.

"No, thank you," Emma replied coldly.

"Alright, I'll leave it here in case you get hungry," Ethan said, setting the macaron down and inching closer to the bed. "About earlier, I'll take responsibility," he added softly.

Emma couldn't help but scoff. "Transfer me the shares from Group Thomas."

"Okay," Ethan agreed, surprising her. "How much do you want?"

"Twenty percent," she stated firmly, meeting his gaze unflinchingly.

He nodded. "I promise you." Ethan was ready to do whatever it took to ease her resentment. He had planned to gradually give her the shares anyway, hoping it would bind them together.

"I have some things to take care of. If you get hungry, eat something, and try to rest," Ethan advised before leaving the room.

Alone, Emma mulled over his unexpected compliance. "I thought he'd haggle, but he agreed so easily. Should've asked for more," she mused. "I need another twenty percent to be free of him. But if anyone turns against him, he'll retaliate."

She considered her next steps. "If I work at his company, maybe I can find his weaknesses and finally break away." With a plan taking shape, Emma felt a newfound clarity. Since what was done was done, she might as well gain something from it.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. "Mrs. Thomas, are you awake?" Grace Gonzalez called softly from outside the door.

"Come in."

Grace entered, carrying a glass of milk. "Mr. Clark thought this might help you sleep."

Emma nodded, studying Grace with curiosity. "I'll drink it later."

"Mr. Clark asked me to wait until you finished it," Grace admitted, embarrassed.

Emma sighed, picked up the milk, and drank it down in large gulps. "You can tell him it's done," she said, setting the glass aside and heading to the bathroom.

"Goodnight, Mrs. Thomas," Grace said, gathering the dishes before leaving.

In the bathroom, Emma's eyes landed on a white shirt in the laundry basket, a faint lipstick stain on the collar catching her attention. She paused, holding the shirt up for inspection, her mind racing. "Lipstick?" she murmured, the implications clear.

"Of course, it's just a contract to him," she whispered, tossing the shirt back and leaving the bathroom. A sudden idea struck her, and she grabbed her phone, snapping a photo of the stained shirt.

"This lipstick stain must be worth five percent of the shares," she typed, a wry smile playing on her lips, and sent the message to Ethan along with the picture.

At that moment, Ethan was in a meeting, his phone buzzing with her messages. He glanced at them, initially hopeful, but his expression darkened as he read. "Does she not care?" he wondered, typing a reply before setting his phone facedown.

Emma read his response: "Everything today counts toward the twenty percent. That's my limit."

"Unbelievable," she fumed, tossing her phone aside. "Tomorrow, I'll tell him I want to work at his company. I'll find his weakness and finally get out of here." Determined, she plotted her next move, ready to seize control of her future.
