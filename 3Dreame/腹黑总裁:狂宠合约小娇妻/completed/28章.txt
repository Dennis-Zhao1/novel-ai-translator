### An Unexpected Wedding Adventure

Emma Thomas had just finished dinner and was back at her favorite spot by the window, painting away as the rain drummed harder against the glass. She glanced outside, her mind wandering to Ethan Clark. *"I wonder if he remembered to take an umbrella?"* she mused, shaking her head at herself. *"Why am I even worried about him? Get it together, Emma."* But the distraction caused her hand to slip, leaving an unintended mark on the canvas.

"Darn it," she grumbled, eyeing the painting with regret. Her evening's work now seemed ruined. With a sigh, she set the brush aside, removed the canvas, and placed it in a box meant for discarded pieces before heading to bed.

Much later, Ethan Clark finally returned home. He tiptoed upstairs, hesitating at the bedroom door. With a soft touch, he flicked on his phone's flashlight and carefully entered the room. Emma was already asleep, her face serene in the dim light. Ethan's lips curled into a small smile before he headed to the bathroom.

After his shower, Ethan noticed the discarded painting. Holding his phone's light over the canvas, he scrutinized the errant stroke. *"Did she accidentally smudge it?"* he wondered, detecting a subtle change in the piece's mood—it seemed less lonely than before. He set the painting down and quietly slipped into bed beside Emma, ensuring he didn't disturb her.

### Morning Preparations

The next morning, Ethan was quick to silence the alarm. Emma stirred slightly, turning over to face him. Ethan watched her, his gaze lingering on her peaceful expression. Just then, his phone buzzed with a call, prompting him to retreat to the bathroom for privacy.

Emma awoke to find his side of the bed empty. *"Always up so early,"* she thought sleepily. As she made her way to the bathroom, she overheard Ethan talking on the phone. Deciding to give him some space, she headed to the closet to pick out her outfit.

When Ethan emerged, he found Emma at the door. "Sorry if I woke you," he apologized.

"Oh, I woke up on my own," she replied, still groggy.

Ethan glanced at her, then moved past. "We won't have time for breakfast. Get dressed—we need to head out soon," he advised, making his way to the closet. He selected a sharp suit for himself and picked out a simple white gown for Emma.

"You're kidding, right? This is too formal," Emma protested, eyeing the dress with disbelief.

"You're the bridesmaid," Ethan explained, placing the gown in her hands. Emma was taken aback. How did she suddenly become a bridesmaid? She'd heard somewhere that married women couldn't be bridesmaids, and here she was, already married.

After a prolonged moment of disbelief, Emma changed into the gown and descended the stairs. Ethan, waiting on the couch, was momentarily speechless at the sight of her. The dress hugged her figure perfectly, showcasing her elegant collarbone and cascading black hair that contrasted beautifully with the white fabric.

Ethan's gaze traveled from her face to her shoes. "Are those heels too high for you?" he asked, concerned.

"I think I can manage. They match the dress best," Emma replied, adjusting her handbag.

"Alright, let's go," Ethan said, sweeping her off her feet and carrying her to the door.

"Hey! Put me down!" Emma exclaimed, her cheeks flushed with surprise.

Ethan chuckled, calling out to their friend, Grace Gonzalez, to grab a box for them. Once Emma was settled in the car, Ethan handed her the box. "Here, have some breakfast," he suggested as he started the engine.

Emma opened the box to find a selection of pastries. "You got these this morning?" she asked, surprised.

"I had someone pick them up for us. Try them," Ethan encouraged, focusing on the road.

Emma took a bite and groaned in delight. "These are amazing."

Ethan smiled, pleased with her reaction. He had, in fact, stood in line the previous night until the early hours to get them.

### At the Wedding

They arrived at the outdoor wedding venue, the sun shining brightly. As they stepped out of the car, a familiar voice called out, "Ethan! Emma!"

It was Henry Baker, jogging over to meet them. "Hey there, Emma, looking stunning today. Ethan, you're in trouble," he teased, making Emma chuckle awkwardly.

Ethan nudged her gently, signaling her to take his arm as they made their way inside. "Whose wedding is this, anyway?" Emma whispered.

"William Jones," Ethan replied casually.

Inside the bridal suite, William greeted them warmly. "Ethan, is this your wife? She's gorgeous!" exclaimed William's fiancée, Chloe Robinson.

"Emma, this is Chloe, today's bride," Ethan introduced.

"You look stunning," Emma complimented Chloe, genuinely impressed by her bridal glow.

Chloe beamed, "Emma, you're the most beautiful person here today. I'm sorry for the last-minute call yesterday, but my original bridesmaid had an emergency, and Ethan said you'd help out."

"No worries. I'll do my best not to mess it up," Emma laughed, feeling more at ease.

As everyone gathered for the ceremony, Henry rallied the group, "Alright, let's review the schedule, folks. Time to shine!"

And with that, the wedding festivities began.
