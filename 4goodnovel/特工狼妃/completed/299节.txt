**Final Chapter! 9**

The tunnel led directly to the back mountain of Nangong Villa, where the entrance opened up to a steep cliff. Nangong Yulou had taken Tuoba Tianye to the edge of the precipice, with no way to retreat.

“Nangong Yulou, let him go! I can plead with the Emperor to spare your life,” Heren Yichen implored, his voice filled with urgency. If anything happened to Tuoba Tianye, it would cause chaos in the waterways, and he could not allow that to happen.

“Spare my life? What’s the difference between that and a lifetime in prison? Ha ha…” Nangong Yulou laughed, a bitter sound echoing in the still air. He knew better than anyone what fate awaited him once the truth was exposed. The consequences would be severe, and the thought of it only made him laugh harder.

“Even ants cling to life. So what if it means prison? If everyone thought like you, what would be the point of dungeons? You need to own up to the things you’ve done, Nangong Yulou. Don’t let people think you’re a coward who can’t face the consequences of your actions,” Nangong Nuoer said coldly, her voice dripping with disdain as she watched him laugh.

“If it’s prison they want for me, I’d rather die,” Nangong Yulou retorted, his laughter fading into a chilling silence.

“Yulou, what do you intend to do?” Realizing the resolve behind his words, Tuoba Tianye’s heart sank as he reached out to grip Yulou's arm tightly.

“Tuoba Tianye, you betrayed me. I should kill you, but that would be too easy. I want you to live on, carrying the weight of my hatred,” Nangong Yulou's gaze was fierce, his eyes burning with deep resentment. Once, he had believed in the sincerity of Tuoba Tianye’s feelings, but in this moment, he understood that every approach had been a means to an end. Tuoba's betrayal had placed him in an inescapable abyss, and his hatred was overwhelming—he wanted to consume him, to drive a soft sword into his throat, yet despite the rage surging within him, he couldn’t bring himself to do it.

“Yulou, I may have deceived you, but I never lied about my feelings. I truly cared for you. I had no choice but to betray you. I don’t expect your forgiveness, but I hope you can survive this,” Tuoba Tianye's voice shook with desperation. "Even if the court condemns you, I will find a way to save you. Please, don’t do anything foolish."

“Cared? Ha ha… You used me, betrayed me, and now you dare say such things? Who cares for your sincerity? Nangong Villa is already destroyed, and I have no motivation left to live. Tuoba Tianye, I curse you to never find someone who can move your heart again,” Nangong Yulou spat, suddenly drawing the soft sword across Tuoba Tianye's arm. With a sharp 'swish,' the blade sank into flesh, blood gushing forth like a fountain. In that moment, Yulou shoved him away, his body flying back, teetering on the edge of the unfathomable cliff.

“Yulou… no!” Tuoba Tianye shouted, horrified at Yulou’s fierce determination. Ignoring the pain of his own injury, he turned and leaped after him.

“Tuoba Tianye, are you trying to die?” Heren Yichen, witnessing their struggle, rushed forward, grasping Tuoba’s arm just as he was about to leap into the abyss after Nangong Yulou. Yulou's death was one thing, but he could not allow anything to happen to Tuoba.

“Let go! I have to save him! He can’t die! I won’t allow it… Let me go…” The calm resolve on Tuoba’s face melted away, replaced by panic and sorrow. It was his fault that Yulou had come to this point.
