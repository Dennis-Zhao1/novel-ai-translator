### Shameless Man! 1

“Y-You shameless, filthy man! Barbarian! Stop it, just stop!” She had seen shameless men before, but never one as audacious as this. How could he restrain her freedom by tearing her clothes off? Nangong Nuo’er’s eyes were practically blazing with fury. If she had a gun in her hand right now, she wouldn't hesitate to pull the trigger and send a bullet straight to his heart, sending him off to accompany the King of Hell.

“What kind of clothes are these? They’re impossible to take off. Forget it; I’ll just tear them apart!” Helian Yichen had been struggling for a while, trying to figure out how to get her clothes off, but now he simply decided to rip them. Just as he was about to make his move, he caught the sound of Nangong Nuo’er’s desperate pleas.

“Please, don’t! Don’t rip my clothes!” She knew he wasn’t joking; he would actually shred her outfit. With urgency, she gripped his shoulders, her fiery gaze now dimmed as she reluctantly lowered her voice. “Just... don’t.”

“Then are you still asking to leave this room?” Looking at her pitiful demeanor as she begged, a hint of unnoticeable sympathy flickered in Helian Yichen’s eyes, but his lips curled into a mocking smile as if to say she could never win against him.

“I’ll stay here, is that what you want?” That despicable, shameless man! He better pray that one day he doesn’t fall into her hands, or she would make sure to pay him back in full. Nangong Nuo’er shot him a look filled with resentment, silently urging him to remember this.

“If you’d just behave and stay here, why would I need to be so rough with you? I don’t want to make things difficult for you. What’s wrong with following me? I can treat you well; whatever you want, I can give it to you.” Helian Yichen sat down on the edge of the bed and reached out his large, sturdy hand to gently stroke her slightly pale face, feeling pleased that she had finally given in.

“I don’t want anything. I just want my freedom.” Even if he could give her the world, so what? He wasn’t her; how could he possibly know what she truly wanted? His sweet words meant nothing when he was the one making her life difficult. This man, who didn’t match his words with his actions, made her want to stab him right then and there. Nangong Nuo’er scoffed, her voice dripping with disdain.
