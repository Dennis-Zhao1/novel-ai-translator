**Don't Resist Me! 4**

"Back then, I was blinded by anger. I thought you had ignored my warnings and ate it anyway..."

Helian Yichen buried his head in her neck, inhaling her unique, captivating fragrance. A look of intoxication crossed his face. "I was too impulsive. But when it comes to caring, it can lead to chaos. I care too much about you, I’m too anxious about you—it made me lose my rationality. Nuo'er, please forgive me! I believe you can overcome it."

She was the most resilient woman he had ever met. He had never heard of anyone who could kick the habit after becoming addicted to the black jade balm. He had been watching her situation closely; she was genuinely working hard to break free from her addiction, and he believed she truly could.

"Your Highness, let go. We have no future. Even if I manage to kick this habit, I used to be an addict. I could ruin your reputation, and if the Emperor were to blame you for it, you wouldn’t be able to bear the consequences." She knew he was investigating the smuggling of black jade balm. Given her past with addiction, could the royal family tolerate her?! She wasn't foolish enough to care about others' opinions.

"I don't care. No matter what the future holds, I want you by my side. Nuo'er, don’t resist me." He had never been so persistent with any woman before; it was only her. Helian Yichen lifted his head and softly kissed her pale neck. His deep voice was laced with a seductive timbre, his warm breath teasing her, drawing her in. He didn't want to think about what lay ahead; all he knew was that he couldn’t live without her right now.

"Helian Yichen, what are you planning?!"

As his lips grazed her neck, Nangong Nuo'er couldn’t help but shiver. She instinctively reached to push him away, but before she could, his large hand firmly grasped hers and rested it against her chest, landing on that soft and alluring curve.

"I want you, Nuo'er. I know you feel something for me too." His voice was low and sultry, brushing over her heart like feathers, stirring an unsettling tremor within her. Helian Yichen held her hand tightly with one hand while the other deftly slipped into her clothing, caressing her soft, delicate skin.

"Helian Yichen, stop it! Who gave you permission to do this? Stop!" Although they had shared a bed for a while, he had always been a gentleman, especially since she had injured her foot. The most he had done was hold her while they slept.
