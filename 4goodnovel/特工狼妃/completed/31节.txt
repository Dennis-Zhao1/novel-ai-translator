**Chapter 2: He Still Wants to Take Advantage of Her!**

“Wow, what a huge black eagle! Catching it and stewing it would definitely be a great boost for the body!” Nango Nuo’er looked up at the shadow above her, revealing a sly smile as she spotted the enormous black eagle soaring in the sky.

As the eagle glided through the air, searching for its master, it suddenly sensed two malicious gazes fixated on it. With a sharp cry, it circled midair and caught sight of Nango Nuo’er standing not far away. The eagle felt an intense wave of hostility directed at it, and if it wasn’t mistaken, she was eyeing it with greedy intentions.

This proud and majestic black eagle had long been a loyal companion to its master, basking in their affection. It couldn't tolerate being looked at like a mere meal, as if someone was sizing it up for dinner. After a few more loops in the air, it decided to swoop down and teach that rude human a lesson for coveting what belonged to its master. You’ll regret this!

As a trained agent, Nango Nuo’er had a keen sense of danger. The moment she noticed the eagle circling toward her, she felt its hostility radiate. Watching it dive toward her, claws extended, she couldn’t help but smirk. 

With a swift motion, she yanked off the sweat towel wrapped around her neck, gripping it tightly in her hand. Her bright eyes narrowed as she calculated the eagle's speed. Just as the eagle reached above her, ready to slash at her face, Nango Nuo’er dropped her body into a perfect 90-degree angle, flicking the towel like a living serpent and wrapping it around the eagle’s claws.

The eagle hadn’t anticipated such agility from her. It regretted its decision to attack, but it was too late. 

Its claws were tightly ensnared by the towel, and as it attempted to take flight, Nango Nuo’er was quicker, crossing its wings to trap them. In a panic, the eagle opened its beak, attempting to peck at her face in retaliation.

“Do you really think you can take me on? Just behave and become my meal. I bet your meat is incredibly tender! Who would have thought my luck would be this good today, catching such a massive black eagle? Now, don’t struggle, or I promise you’ll regret it deeply.”

Nango Nuo’er's playful yet dangerous tone echoed in the air, a mix of mischief and confidence as she prepared to subdue her feathery adversary.
