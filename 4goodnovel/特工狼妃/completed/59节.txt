**Strip Down in Front of Her! 3**

"Brother, why don’t you want me to marry him? He’s good-looking and comes from a distinguished family. Even my second sister wants to marry him. Why do you think it would be bad for me to marry him?” 

She knew her elder brother had a protective nature when it came to her, but she couldn't deny that Helian Yichen was a dragon amongst men. Even marrying him as a concubine wouldn’t be a bad deal. Shouldn't he be happy for her? Why was he trying to stop her? Nangong No'er looked at him with a hint of confusion in her eyes.

"Little sister, big brother is just worried that you might suffer if you go to live with them. After all, you’re the little treasure of our family, and I don’t want you to face any hardships," Nangong Xudang’s gaze flickered for a moment. He slowly released her shoulder, unable to hold her gaze.

"If you’re worried I’ll suffer there, what about second sister? Aren’t you afraid she’ll suffer if she marries him?" When Nangong Qian'er expressed her desire to marry Helian Yichen, he didn’t show any concern at all. Although they were only half-siblings, he shared the same mother with Nangong Qian'er. The way he treated them felt vastly different.

"You’re gentler, so I’m naturally more worried about you. Qian'er is stronger, so I don't have to worry about her," Nangong Xudang replied as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.

"Who says marrying me will bring her suffering?" Just as Nangong No'er was about to find humor in her brother's naive thinking, she noticed Helian Yichen had returned, his face etched with displeasure as he strode in, a sleek black eagle perched lazily on his shoulder, its sharp eyes half-closed.

"Your Highness, you’re back," Nangong Xudang’s expression changed upon seeing Helian Yichen, but he dared not say anything further.

"No'er may be marrying me as a concubine, but I assure you her status in my household will be equal to that of the main wife. I hope this satisfies you, future brother-in-law?" As Helian Yichen stepped into the room, the already spacious area felt constricted, and an invisible pressure filled the air, making it hard to breathe.

"Your Highness, you misunderstand. I’m just worried my little sister might not adapt to such a distant place," Nangong Xudang clearly didn’t want to offend Helian Yichen, his voice filled with a hesitant tone.
