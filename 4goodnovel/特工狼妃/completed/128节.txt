**Under the Influence Again! 2**

Her mind was a blank slate, devoid of any thoughts. She found it impossible to concentrate on anything else, feeling an overwhelming sense of happiness wash over her. All her worries faded into the background, and she completely forgot about her plans and ambitions.

“Norah! Norah! What are you doing here?!” Just as she rolled on the ground, laughing uncontrollably, a deep, astonished voice broke through her haze. She opened her eyes, trying to focus on the figure before her, but his image kept expanding in her vision. Although she couldn’t make out his features, she recognized his voice. Why was he here?

“What are you doing here? Get out! I don’t want to see you again!” Anger surged within her as she halted her rolling. Propping herself up, she struggled to regain focus on his face, but dizziness clouded her mind. He spun in her vision, eluding clarity.

“Norah, I talked to Xiaoxiao just now. I’m sorry, I misunderstood you. Can you forgive me?” His face drew closer, and when he saw her reaction—one that resembled the effects of some potent drug—his brows furrowed in confusion. What was going on? Wasn’t she supposed to be in recovery?

“Haha... The lofty prince is groveling to me. I can’t bear such humility! And let me tell you, it doesn’t matter anymore whether you misunderstood me or not. What matters is, I don’t want to see you again. Get out! I never want to see you again!” A fleeting moment of clarity struck her when she recognized him. With a finger pointed defiantly at his face, she shouted for him to leave.

“Norah, let me help you up, and then we can talk.” Helian Yichen wanted to ask her what was happening, but he held back, deciding to simply help her to her feet.

“Don’t touch me! Go away, just leave…” Norah struggled against his grip, but he disregarded her protests, wrapping his arms around her waist and lifting her off the ground. After days apart, her body felt soft against his. The moment he made contact, he didn’t want to let go, captivated by the familiar scent that belonged only to Norah.

After a few more attempts to break free, she realized she couldn’t escape his hold. In a moment of frustration, she raised her hand and slapped him across the face. The sound echoed sharply in the air, and as her palm fell back to her side, silence enveloped them. He didn’t try to dodge the blow; he could have, but he didn’t.
