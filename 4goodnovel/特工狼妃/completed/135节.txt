**Kicked Out of Bed! 3**

“Honestly, you and I are a perfect match, aren’t we? What are you doing here? Didn’t you say you’d never fall for a junkie? Why are you here looking for me?” Nango Noer slowly climbed out of the chaotic mess that was the bed, her clothes finally put together. Damn that Helian Yichen! If she had a gun in hand right now, she wouldn't hesitate to put a bullet in him.

“I know the things I said before hurt you, and I’m really sorry,” Helian Yichen said, his voice earnest. “I realize now that you’re a passive addict, not an active one. You don’t want this. I shouldn’t have spoken so impulsively, Noer. Please forgive me; I didn’t mean to hurt you.” He reached out, wanting to help her, but she shrugged him off with a wave of her hand.

“I’ll kill your whole family first, then I’ll ask you if you can forgive me for that!” Nango Noer’s tone was icy, her expression cold enough to send a chill down his spine.

“Noer, please don’t do this. I know I misunderstood you, but I genuinely want your forgiveness now.” Helian Yichen felt his pride slipping away, but he swallowed it down. She was the first woman to make him lower his voice like this; with anyone else, he would have walked away without a second thought.

“Sorry, Your Highness, but I’m not one to forgive easily. If you don’t have anything else to say, please leave. We’re done here.” Nango Noer moved to the table and sat down, pouring herself a cup of tea.

“What do you mean we’re done? What was that just now, Nango Noer?!” Helian Yichen’s frustration boiled over. Did she really want to cut ties with him so desperately?

“What was that? Consider it your final parting gift. You wanted me, and you were only after my body. That little encounter we just had? Think of it as the last present I’m giving you before we say goodbye. You looked like you enjoyed it quite a bit,” she retorted, the warmth of the tea soothing her throat and easing her dry feelings as she deliberately belittled him.
