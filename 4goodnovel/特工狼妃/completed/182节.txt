**Active Sacrifice! 5**

"Did you come to our Nangong Manor just to seek my favor? Ziyan, you should leave now. I can pretend tonight never happened, but if you don't go, I'll have to deal with you according to family rules." Tempting the master was always a serious offense.

"Young Master, please don’t be angry. I’ll leave right away." Seeing the cold resolve in his eyes, Ziyan knew she had no choice but to go. She gathered her scattered clothes from the floor, her face covered in embarrassment as she turned away.

"Oh my god, what have I done?!" Nangong Xudan rubbed his slightly dazed head, relieved he hadn't made a bigger mistake. Just as he was about to stand up and return to bed, something pink on the floor caught his eye. He reached down to pick it up—it was the bellyband Ziyan had dropped.

“This bellyband?” Nangong Xudan brought it to his nose, inhaling its faint, delicate fragrance. He recognized it immediately as belonging to Nangong Nuo'er. A spark of surprise lit up in his eyes. He closed his eyes, pressed the soft fabric against his face, and breathed in the subtle scent, imagining that the owner of the bellyband was right in his arms. A look of bliss spread across his face.

After attending to Nangong Nuo'er and ensuring she was settled for the night, Xiaoxiao returned to the servant quarters only to find that Ziyan, who had gone to deliver clothes, had not yet returned.

"Ziyan has been gone for a long time. Could she have gotten lost?" This was Ziyan's first day here, and although Xiaoxiao had shown her the way earlier that afternoon, she couldn't guarantee that Ziyan would remember all the paths. Quickly, Xiaoxiao rushed out to look for her. Just as she stepped outside, she spotted Ziyan returning, looking utterly dejected.

"Ziyan, you’re back! I was worried you might have gotten lost and was just about to come find you," Xiaoxiao exclaimed as she hurried towards her. Upon getting closer, she noticed something was off. Ziyan's hair was a mess, and her clothes looked disheveled; she appeared quite distressed. Xiaoxiao paused for a moment, then asked with concern, "Ziyan, what happened? Are you okay?!"

"Xiaoxiao, I’m fine. I just got a bit lost," Ziyan replied, lifting her head to meet Xiaoxiao’s gaze. She choked back her emotions, forcing a brave face as she spoke.
