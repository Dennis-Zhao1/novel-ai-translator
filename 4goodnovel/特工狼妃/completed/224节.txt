### What Are They Up To? 5

“After all, this is the territory of Nangong Villa. As a member of Nangong Villa, I think I have the duty to understand what’s happening here.” She felt like she was repaying a debt; she didn’t want to owe anything to the real Nangong Nuo'er.

“This kind of thing is best left to men. You’re still not feeling well; you should head back,” Heren Yichen said, pulling her hand towards Nangong Villa.

“They’re unloading cargo right now. Don’t you want to know where it’s headed?!” He was just going to walk away like that? Not interested in investigating their warehouse? Nangong Nuo'er understood that he was a typical male chauvinist, so she wasn’t angry or going to argue with him when he said that.

“I’ve already sent Qintian to follow them,” Heren Yichen replied, his expression tense. What he really wanted to do was strangle this woman for constantly worrying him.

“You let Qintian do such a dangerous thing? Aren’t you afraid he might get into trouble?” Nangong Nuo'er raised an eyebrow.

“Don’t worry. If he couldn’t handle this little task, how could he have stayed by my side for so long? Look at you, you’ve come all the way out here, so I assume you’re feeling much better now. Does your lower abdomen still hurt?” Heren Yichen lowered his head, studying her flat abdomen with a furrowed brow.

“I’m not some frail woman; a little thing like this won’t take me down. But since I rarely get to go out, it feels like a waste to just head back now.” She hadn’t even caught a glimpse of what that man looked like. If he was using this shipment as a cover, what was he really transporting? Was it that black jade ointment? Could he really be a big-time drug lord? Her curiosity about him was only growing.

“So what do you want to do?” Heren Yichen, still holding her hand, gradually came to a halt, observing her closely.

“I want to see what the leader of the Fengshui Gang looks like,” Nangong Nuo'er unabashedly revealed her intentions.

“You want to meet another man?” His eyes narrowed, a shadow of jealousy flickering across his face, and his voice dropped several degrees.

“Even if it’s a woman, I still want to see for myself.” Was he jealous? Nangong Nuo'er looked up at him, unfazed by the sudden chill radiating from him.

“I think you won’t have the chance to see him. He wears a mask, and unless you defeat him, don’t even think about it,” Heren Yichen said coldly.
