**Chapter 1: A Public Kiss**

She had been kissed forcefully in front of everyone!

Suddenly, she noticed Helyan Yicheng standing right behind them, his alluring face tense and serious, his half-closed violet eyes locked onto her. She froze for a moment, contemplating whether to ignore him and leave. Just then, a sharp pain shot through her thigh, causing her to let out a small gasp as her body swayed slightly.

"Nuoh, what's wrong?" Tuo Ba Tianye, who had been about to leave with the steward, noticed her discomfort and quickly reached out to support her.

"Let her go." Before Nan Gong Nuoh could respond, a chilling voice, cold as ice, cut through the air. Instantly, she found herself pulled into a familiar embrace. Oh my, his speed was astonishing! Just a moment ago, he had been standing far away, and in the blink of an eye, he was right by her side.

"Helyan Yicheng, what are you doing? Let me go!" Upon realizing who it was, Nan Gong Nuoh pushed against his chest, trying to break free. But his arms were firmly wrapped around her waist, not allowing her to escape.

"I won’t let go." Damn it! He had only stepped away for a moment, and here she was, practically throwing herself at another man. The mere thought of her being in contact with anyone else was enough to drive him mad. Helyan Yicheng tightened his grip around her slender waist, his icy voice reverberating in her heart.

"Let go of me, you uncouth barbarian! I said let go! Did you hear me?!" Nan Gong Nuoh was both furious and anxious. It felt as if he was trying to crush her waist with such force.

"My lord, Nuoh doesn’t like you holding her. A man shouldn’t force a woman." 

Tuo Ba Tianye observed Helyan Yicheng’s tense demeanor, a smirk forming on his lips as he prepared to enjoy the spectacle. Though he had never interacted with Helyan Yicheng directly, he had heard tales of his infamous reputation. Seeing him so worked up over Nuoh, it was clear he had strong feelings for her.

"Apologies, but she is my woman. If I want to hold her, I will hold her. I also don’t like her having any physical contact with other men." Helyan Yicheng, the notorious leader of the Golden Dragon Society, emanated an undeniable aura of dominance that made the air feel heavy. As he held onto the still-struggling Nan Gong Nuoh, his sharp gaze scrutinized the man before him.
