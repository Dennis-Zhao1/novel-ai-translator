**Who Betrayed Her? 3**

"Xiao Qi, why are you acting so happy when the Third Miss is fine?!" This damn Xiao Qi, could it be that he actually tampered with her medicine? Xiaoxiao shot him a suspicious look, yanking his hand away from her collar with a mix of annoyance and concern.

"Shouldn't you be happy that the Third Miss is stable? We won't have to see her suffer anymore! What’s wrong with you?!" Why did her expression suddenly turn so serious?! Xiao Qi felt his smile fade, a knot of unease forming in his stomach. Was something wrong?

"Happy? I’m on the verge of losing my mind! You brainless fool, you're driving me crazy! Let’s go already; the Third Miss is waiting for us." 

That damned Xiao Qi. Although the Third Miss's suffering had eased up in recent days, it wouldn’t simply disappear. What did it mean that she was stable now? Xiaoxiao genuinely wanted to take a knife and dissect his brain to see what nonsense filled it.

"Xiaoxiao, what on earth is going on?!" He noticed something was off; her harsh words were unexpected. Why was she scolding him so fiercely? Alarm bells rang in Xiao Qi's head. Could it be that something went wrong with the medicine? No way—the Second Master wouldn’t harm the Third Miss. He must be overthinking things. Rubbing the back of his head, he shook it vigorously.

"Hmph, you don’t need to ask anything. Once we see the Third Miss, you’ll understand." After Xiaoxiao finished speaking, she fell silent. If Xiao Qi had really betrayed the Third Miss, she wouldn’t let him off the hook.

Seeing that Xiaoxiao refused to say anything more, Xiao Qi decided not to pry further, his heart racing with anxiety as they approached Nangong Nuoer’s chamber.

"Reporting to the Third Miss, Xiao Qi is here," Xiaoxiao knocked on the door softly and announced.

"Come in," a voice from inside responded. Only then did Xiaoxiao lead Xiao Qi into the room.

"Xiao Qi, even though I can be a bit strict with you, I’ve treated you fairly. Why would you betray me?!" Nangong Nuoer stood up from her seat, walking over to Xiao Qi, who appeared flustered and unsure. Her gaze turned icy, and she scrutinized him closely. Was he feeling guilty?

Xiao Qi’s heart raced as he felt the weight of her stare, confusion swirling in his mind. What was he supposed to say?
