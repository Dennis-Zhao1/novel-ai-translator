**"You Will Not Insult Her!"**

"Shouldn't I?" Nangong Nuo'er scoffed dismissively, uninterested in continuing the conversation. She turned on her heel and strode away toward her room.

"Women truly are as unpredictable as the sea—one moment they’re passionate as fire, and the next, they’re as cold as ice." As he watched her graceful figure retreat, Helian Yichen couldn’t help but let out a soft sigh. He followed her inside, casting a casual glance at the fleeting flash of white that was her silhouette. Just as he turned his head, that flicker of white vanished into a hidden space, and an enigmatic smile crept onto his lips as he entered the room, pretending as if nothing had happened.

Once they stepped inside, the figure cloaked in white with a veil covering her face slowly emerged, her bright, autumn-like eyes glinting with a flash of anger.

Tonight was the night of the new moon, the sky adorned with a large, luminous moon casting a silvery glow over the land. A cool night breeze rustled through the trees, creating a soothing sound like whispers in the dark.

"So, after our last unpleasant encounter, you’ve invited me here again. Are you finally ready to apologize for your previous behavior?" she said, recalling the time he had been on the receiving end of her kick, leaving a bruise on his leg.

"Do you really have the audacity to ask me for an apology? You despicable little coward." The masked man’s face bore an expression as fierce as a demon, igniting a fire in the white-clad woman’s eyes.

"Are you on some kind of medication tonight? You’re so fired up! There’s a stall in town that sells herbal tea; you should definitely go get a bowl tomorrow. It’ll cool you down," he teased, a wicked glimmer dancing in his eyes.

"You... you think you can gloat for much longer? You probably don’t know this, but they’ve already come up with a plan to deal with you," the veiled woman replied, her eyes narrowing in a smirk.

"I knew they would try to deal with me the moment they arrived. That’s hardly a surprise," he shrugged, feigning indifference.

"Do you know how they plan to handle you?" she sneered.

"Why don’t you enlighten me? I’m curious," he replied, raising an eyebrow.

"If you agree to help me get rid of Nangong Nuo'er, I’ll tell you," the woman pressed, seizing the opportunity to negotiate.

"I already told you, there’s only one chance, and you missed it."

"So you’re refusing, huh? But you must not know that the current Nangong Nuo'er is probably not the same person she was before," she continued, watching his expression shift at her words. This topic should pique his interest.

"What do you mean by that?" A cold light flickered in his enchanting eyes.

"After all these years together, haven’t you noticed her drastic change in temperament? Even her daily eating habits have shifted. Don’t tell me you think that’s all due to her amnesia. A person can forget past events, but their inherent habits are not so easily altered." She smiled smugly, knowing she saw things more clearly than those blinded by familiarity.

"Yes, she has changed a lot, but that doesn’t mean she isn’t the real Nangong Nuo'er. Do you have any evidence? If not, don’t spread baseless rumors," he snapped, his mood darkening as the once playful gleam in his eyes turned to a stormy shadow.
