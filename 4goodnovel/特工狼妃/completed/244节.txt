Section 244: Take Off Your Clothes! (Part 3)
"Enough talking. Are you going to take them off or not? If you don’t, you can forget about getting it back." Nangong Xudan’s voice turned icy as he noticed her hesitation, his piercing gaze locking onto her.

“No... don’t... I’ll do it. I’ll take them off,” Ziyan stammered, her voice trembling. Despite her unwillingness, the weight of his threat left her no choice. Placing the clothes in her hands carefully on the table, she steeled herself and reached up with shaking fingers, slowly undoing her outer robe.

“Hurry up! At this pace, do you want me to help you?” Xudan’s patience wore thin, his sharp tone cutting through the air like a blade. His words only deepened Ziyan’s shame. Stripped of her dignity and pride, she felt her eyes sting with unshed tears, the humiliation weighing heavy in her chest. But with his leverage over her, she had no way to resist his demands.

“It’s just taking off your clothes—why are you making such a fuss? You weren’t like this that night, were you? Weren’t you eager to throw yourself at me? If you want to please me, then do as I say and stop acting so pitiful. She never behaved like this. Do you hear me?!” His cold words pierced her heart, each syllable a reminder of her mistake and the constant comparison to the Third Miss.

“Yes, Young Master,” Ziyan replied, her voice barely above a whisper. His harsh tone and unrelenting gaze deepened the wound in her heart. Once again, everything was about the Third Miss. Bitterness bubbled within her, the memory of that fateful night haunting her. What had possessed her to act so foolishly? She clenched her fists briefly, then wiped away the tears that threatened to spill before forcing herself to continue.

Xudan’s eyes narrowed slightly as he watched her, his gaze unreadable. When she was down to her undergarments, her slender figure revealed hints of delicate curves and a graceful, willow-like waist that seemed fragile enough to be held in one hand. Just as she reached for the ties of her last layer of clothing, his voice broke the silence.

“Stop. That’s enough.”

Ziyan froze, startled by his sudden command. She hesitated, her fingers halting mid-motion, unsure of what to do.

“Put this on.” Without meeting her questioning eyes, Xudan picked up the clothes from the table and tossed them at her with a curt, commanding tone.
