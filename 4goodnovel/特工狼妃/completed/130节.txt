**Under Control Again! 4**

The blood coursed through Nan Gong Nuo'er’s veins like a raging river, an unknown catalyst within her igniting her nerves, pushing her into a state of heightened agitation. She longed to stop, to regain control of her mind, but all she could do was surrender to the overwhelming surge of negative emotions that swelled within her.

“Nuo'er, can you please calm down?!” Helian Yichen cursed under his breath, having never before witnessed such a wild reaction from her. Her nerves were in overdrive, much like someone who had just consumed a potent drug. He struggled to restrain her as she thrashed against him, frustration boiling within him.

“I hate you! I loathe you… you filthy bastard! Who do you think you are? I’ll kill you!” Nan Gong Nuo'er couldn’t contain her rage. She was consumed by hatred for the man before her, wishing she could tear him apart, piece by piece.

“Nuo'er, please, just calm down! What did you take earlier?!” Watching her teeter on the brink of madness twisted Helian Yichen's heart, a painful grip tightening around it. He could see that she was suffering, and he felt the weight of her turmoil as if it were his own.

“Let go of me… ah…” Nan Gong Nuo'er’s struggles intensified, her screams echoing in the confined space as she fought against his hold.

“Nuo'er…” Her loud cries were bound to attract unwanted attention. Helian Yichen's grip tightened instinctively, the worry etched on his face. He feared her outbursts would raise suspicion, and in a desperate attempt to silence her, he instinctively moved to cover her mouth.

But he quickly realized that if he used his hands to muffle her, he might lose control of her entirely. She was stronger than most women, fighting with a ferocity that was surprising. With no other options left, he leaned down and captured her lips in a fierce kiss, swallowing her cries whole.

“Mmm… you… let go…” The audacity of this man—how dare he kiss her? Nan Gong Nuo'er’s eyes widened in disbelief, her heart racing. She wanted to push him away, yet her hands were firmly confined by his grip.

She turned her head to evade his kiss, but his warm, persistent lips clung to hers like a shadow, leaving her with no escape. All she could do was stare into the magnified features of his face, a whirlwind of emotions swirling within her.
