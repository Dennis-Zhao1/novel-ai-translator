Your hands are truly perfect!  

"I just feel a bit cold. Let me be quiet for a moment, just hold me like this." Her voice became hoarse, almost inaudible, as she nestled into his embrace, drawing warmth from him. She wasn’t used to sharing her innermost thoughts, even with those closest to her.

"Alright, I won’t say a word." He understood her well; her demeanor was cool, and she preferred to keep her thoughts to herself. He didn't like that she bottled everything up, but he could empathize with her. So, he held her tighter, allowing her to lean peacefully against him.

The room fell silent, both of them refraining from speaking. Yet beneath this calm exterior, a tempest was brewing, signaling that a fierce storm was about to break.

In the tranquil yard, only the occasional sound of chiseling could be heard. Everyone in the Nangong family knew that the second master was indulging in his hobby again—wood carving. Aside from this, he seemed disinterested in everything else.

The morning sun was gentle, pouring into the yard without a hint of heat, almost like a spring breeze caressing the face, bringing a sense of comfort. Nangong Yulou was intently working on a piece of wood, shaping it into what appeared to be a sword. His focus was unwavering, completely absorbed in the task at hand. He didn’t even notice when someone approached him until he stood right in front of him.

"You really have a refined taste, getting up early to work on wood. Is this what you do every day?!" Looking at his devoted expression, almost sacred in its intensity, the speaker hesitated to disrupt the serenity. However, he was eager to converse, and ultimately decided to follow his impulse.

"Tuoba, what brings you here?!" It was only when he heard the voice that he realized someone had joined him. He glanced around but saw no one else, which meant it was just the two of them. Nangong Yulou’s face showed a hint of surprise, his bashful expression betraying him.

"I heard you’re a master craftsman, so I wanted to come see for myself. I hope I'm not interrupting you." Tuoba Tianye offered polite words, yet his actions were anything but courteous as he boldly took a seat on a nearby wooden stool, resting his chin on one hand, looking at him with a hint of arrogance.
