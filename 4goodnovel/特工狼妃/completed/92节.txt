**You Bite Me! 4**

"Leave me alone." Nan Gong Nuo Er's voice was tinged with pain and impatience. She truly didn't want to be disturbed at this moment. It was infuriating how annoying everyone was; if she had a gun right now, she would have shot them all without hesitation because they were just too loud.

"You’re mine. How could I not care about you? Nuo Er, lift your head and look at me. What’s wrong with you?!" The more she pushed him away, the more worried He Lian Yi Chen became, his voice laced with urgency.

“I’m fine! Just stop bothering me, will you?!” Her head was pounding like it was about to explode, and he just kept asking question after question. Did he want to drive her crazy?! Finally, Nan Gong Nuo Er lifted her head. The sight was shocking—her eyes were dark, her face pale, and her lips were almost white. The bangs on her forehead were drenched in cold sweat, and she looked utterly miserable.

"Nuo Er, what on earth happened to you?!" Seeing her like this, He Lian Yi Chen was taken aback. She had been fine when she left, so how could she return in such a state?!

"Just leave me alone! Go away!" Her head was pounding as if it were about to burst, and her vision was beginning to blur. He Lian Yi Chen appeared in front of her as two shadows. In a panic, she reached out to push him away, but her hand accidentally brushed against his injury. A faint gasp escaped his lips, and that sound caused her to pause momentarily. However, the intense pain in her head surged again, making her scream as she clutched her head and fell from her wheelchair.

“Nuo Er.” He Lian Yi Chen felt a sharp pain as she had pushed against his injury. He could feel blood seeping from the wound, but before he could dwell on his own discomfort, he saw Nan Gong Nuo Er tumble out of her wheelchair. He rushed over to help her up, turning to Xiao Xiao and Xiao Qi, who were anxiously looking on, unsure of what to do. With a commanding tone that left no room for argument, he addressed them, “There’s no need for both of you here; I can handle this. You can leave.”

“But Your Highness…” Xiao Xiao couldn’t shake off her concern; his face was pale, and he was clearly unwell. Could he really take care of Miss San all alone?

“Don’t make me say it a third time. Get out!” He Lian Yi Chen's voice was icy, cutting through the tension.

“Xiao Xiao, let’s go outside. If the prince says he can manage, then he can. Let’s not overstay our welcome.” 

The atmosphere was tense, filled with worry and urgency as the two servants reluctantly stepped back, leaving the prince to handle the situation alone.
