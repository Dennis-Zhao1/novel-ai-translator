**Who Could Have Been So Cruel to Her? Part 2**

"Miss, it's perfectly normal for you to have a headache if you don't take your medicine on time. But why do you think there’s poison in that bowl of medicine?!" Xiaoxiao shook her head, still unable to comprehend the situation.

"Honestly, you wouldn't understand, Xiaoxiao. Just remember what I said: you must never speak of what happened today. Continue sending the medicine, but it needs to be secretly disposed of. We can't let anyone catch wind of this." Who could possibly want to harm her? If only she could find out who it was, they would pay dearly. Could it be her? Nangong Nuo'er suddenly recalled Nangong Qi'er, who had been sending her nourishing soup for days. It made perfect sense; Qi'er had always had a thing for Helian Yichen and had likely wanted to replace her as his concubine. Out of jealousy, it was not impossible for her to resort to such treachery. But how could she? After all, she was her sister!

"Third Miss, I've disposed of the medicine. But what about your own?" Xiaoxiao asked, concerned about what she would drink.

"Xiaoxiao, go find a doctor in secret and have him write a new prescription. Find a discreet place to brew the medicine—remember, no one can know about this, do you understand?!" Nangong Nuo'er instructed, her fists trembling slightly with urgency.

"Yes, I'll go find the doctor right away!" Xiaoxiao nodded before hurriedly leaving.

Helian Yichen sensed that Nangong Nuo'er was hiding something from him. Whenever he asked, it was like trying to pry open a clam—no matter how hard he tried, she remained tightly shut. Frustrated, he felt utterly powerless against her; she was a woman who was not easily dominated. Yet, it was precisely this elusive nature that captivated him, driving him to madness.

Helian Yichen had always possessed a stronger constitution than most. Despite the severity of his wounds, after a few days of rest, they had begun to heal. Recently, he had been sleeping particularly soundly, which was unusual for him. At first, he attributed it to his injuries, but gradually he began to realize something was amiss. In the past, even when hurt, he had never slept so deeply. Then it struck him: each night before he drifted off, Nangong Nuo'er would brew him a cup of tea. After drinking it, sleep would envelop him, and he would remain in slumber until dawn. 

As these thoughts swirled in his mind, he couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this than met the eye.
