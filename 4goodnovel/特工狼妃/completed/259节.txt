He wants to take a concubine! 

---

He had once said that he would never give her less than he would give a legitimate wife. The seriousness and determination on Helian Yichen's face were so palpable that there was no room for doubt.

What’s the point of all this grandeur? In the end, she would only be a side wife, sharing a man with others. Nangong Nuo'er let out a cold snort, refusing to argue. She knew that no matter what she said, it would be futile, and she had no desire to bicker with him in front of everyone.

Although her cold huff was barely audible, it still reached Helian Yichen's ears. He was confused; he had already made such a significant concession, yet she still seemed unhappy. Every time this topic came up, she would always react this way.

"Your Highness, I've always cared for Nuo'er since she was a child. You must not let her down," the elderly lady said, her voice tinged with concern. Though she was aging, her heart remained youthful. She could see that Helian Yichen genuinely cared for Nuo'er. Even though Nuo'er appeared aloof, the way she looked at him was telling. Perhaps it was the perspective of an onlooker; she herself had not realized how much she cared for him.

"Grandmother, you can rest assured that I will never let Nuo'er down," Helian Yichen promised with utmost sincerity. As he made this vow to her, he was also indirectly assuring Nangong Nuo'er, though she seemed indifferent to his promise.

Hmph, is this some kind of solemn vow ceremony?! Every word the old lady spoke was laced with thorns. Perhaps it was a case of sour grapes; after all, it was only natural for her to feel unbalanced at the thought of Nangong Qian'er marrying Helian Yichen in her place.

"Remember what you said today, and I will feel at ease. Nuo'er, once you marry the prince, you must not be so willful, understand?!" While she didn't know much about their relationship, she could tell Nuo'er was not entirely convinced.

"Grandmother, as long as I’m not married to him, I am still me, and he is still him. Don’t confuse the two of us," Nuo'er replied firmly. She hadn’t come out to discuss their marriage; watching their back-and-forth felt as if they had already settled on it. The tension in her temples began to throb painfully.
