**Do You Really Want My Hand to Be Disabled? 2**

"Do you really want my hand to be disabled?!" This girl—does she not feel comfortable unless she curses him at least once a day? Helian Yichen's facial muscles twitched involuntarily, a bitter smile curling at the corners of his lips.

"Don't misunderstand me; I never said that," he replied, trying to maintain his composure. She just couldn’t stand the sight of him having two perfectly functioning hands while he forced her to feed him medicine. Here she was, still a mere servant, and Nanguang Nuo'er deliberately refused to blow on the medicine to cool it down, instead bringing it straight to his lips.

"You might not have said it, but surely that’s what you think in your heart, right? You’re really a cold-hearted woman." Yet, ironically, he found himself drawn to her type—so many gentle and considerate women around, yet he was inexplicably attracted to this prickly one. He was indeed his own worst enemy.

"Say whatever you want," Nanguang Nuo'er shrugged, indifferent. After all, it wasn’t like she would lose anything from it.

"Don’t you have any curiosity about what happened last night?!" Typically, after something like that, who wouldn’t feel the urge to ask? Yet, she didn’t even bother to inquire, which left him feeling a bit restless. Helian Yichen tested the waters with his question.

"I don’t see anything interesting about it," Nanguang Nuo'er replied, her disinterest palpable. If she asked too many questions, he might assume she had ulterior motives. Since discussing such topics could lead to misunderstandings, why bother? She wasn’t a gossip, nor did she enjoy meddling in others’ affairs; it was none of her business, after all.

"If you won’t ask, it makes me want to tell you even more." Soon, they would be husband and wife, yet she acted completely indifferent to his injuries. It was truly infuriating. The more she feigned disinterest, the more he felt compelled to share. Helian Yichen stared at her intently.

"The words come from your mouth; you can say whatever you like, and it’s none of my concern," Nanguang Nuo'er replied, still nonchalant.

"Actually, let me tell you—a huge secret is hidden in your mountain villa, one that concerns the fate of the world." As he gazed at her cold profile, Helian Yichen's voice suddenly dropped to a low, eerie tone.

"Is that so?!" She was not even from this era. Even if their country were to fall, it seemed irrelevant to her. Nanguang Nuo'er raised an eyebrow, not the slightest bit intrigued, and shot back with a casual question.
