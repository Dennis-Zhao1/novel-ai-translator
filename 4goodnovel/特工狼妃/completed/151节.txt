She’s here, and now the show is about to start!

“I can’t go right now, so you all should think it through.” However, she knew there was a way for her to return; she just needed to follow Xianle’s instructions and retrieve her enchanted zither. Once she did that, she could choose whether to leave or stay. There was nothing in this world that made her want to stay; she was determined to go back to the twenty-first century.

“Third Miss, you’re so mean! You give people hope and then cruelly shatter it, leaving them in despair!” Xiaoxiao pouted and complained.

“It’s not that I’m mean; it’s just that the world itself is so cruel. Many things happen that I don’t want, but they still occur for reasons I can’t understand.” She had no intention of coming to this world, yet here she was, caught in an unexpected twist of fate, forced to help Xianle while gaining nothing in return.

As Nangong Nuo’er walked along the stalls, she paused when she reached a vendor selling whips. Her gaze landed on a brown whip that looked strikingly similar to one she had used before.

“Miss, would you like to buy a whip? These are top-quality goods made from the finest materials!” The vendor, noticing the luxurious clothing Nangong Nuo’er wore, immediately greeted her with enthusiasm.

“Hmm, let me take a look first.” Nangong Nuo’er reached out to grab the brown whip, but just as her fingers closed around the upper part, a hand suddenly shot out from the side, gripping the lower half of the whip.

“Miss, I saw this whip first.” Nangong Nuo’er pulled gently on her end of the whip and looked up to see a woman clad in green standing in front of her, her hand firmly clutching the whip. The woman narrowed her eyes, her tone icy.

“Who says you saw it first? Our hands landed on the whip at the same time, so we both saw it at the same time.” The woman in green flashed a bright smile, despite the chilly atmosphere.

“Shopkeeper, tell me, who are you going to sell this whip to?” Nangong Nuo’er couldn’t be bothered to argue; she directed her attention straight to the vendor.

“Uh…” The vendor stared nervously at the two women, each holding onto opposite ends of the whip, a bead of cold sweat trickling down his face.

———

The scene was tense, a palpable energy crackling in the air as both women eyed each other, unwilling to back down. The vendor, caught in the middle, felt the weight of their gazes, each one demanding his attention and decision. Would he side with the elegantly dressed Nangong Nuo’er or the equally striking woman in green? The choice was anything but simple.
