**Chapter 8: He Still Wants to Take Advantage of Her!**

"Mei, are you really a maid from the Nangong Manor?" His tone dripped with skepticism, his alluring lips curling into a wry smile that suggested he did not believe a word she said.

"Since you don’t believe me, why even bother asking?" Nangong Nuo’er retorted with a cold laugh. This man was far too perceptive, stirring a primal instinct within her to flee.

"Why push me away? After all, we shared a night together. One day as husband and wife means a hundred days of affection, don’t you think?" His words dripped with a flippant charm. He found her icy demeanor intriguing; it was the kind of thrill he craved. Too compliant a woman lacked flavor, and he relished the challenge she posed.

"That was nothing but a transaction—mutual and without strings attached. I don’t dwell on it, and I hope you won’t be petty enough to remember," Nuo’er replied coldly. She would not let their fleeting encounter give him any leverage over her.

"Are you saying you’re that kind of woman?" His eyes narrowed, irritation flaring at her dismissal of their night. No woman could belittle him like that. While her audacity was commendable, it was also foolish to provoke him. He grasped her shoulders, turning her to face him fully.

"You have no claim over me, so why should it matter if I’m casual or not?" This was the first time Nuo’er truly took in his features under the morning sun. Bathed in its golden light, she noticed the subtle hint of purple glimmering in his deep-set eyes. They were captivating, almost otherworldly, exuding a sense of danger that only added to his allure. She found herself momentarily entranced, fighting to regain her composure.

"My little enchantress, your first time belongs to me, and I intend to take responsibility. I will bring you home and make you my concubine." He had known from that night how stunning she was—a wild beauty, filled with challenges that he couldn't find in any other woman. Just holding her ignited a fire within him.

"What? You want me to be your concubine?" Nuo’er’s beautiful eyes widened in disbelief at his words. Had she misheard him, or was he truly suggesting such a thing?
