**Disfigured! 2**

“What do you mean by that? I’m the second madam of the manor! Are you saying I can’t ask you to do something?!” Haoyue Lian Si raised her voice, visibly displeased by the retort.

“I...” In truth, she only followed the Third Miss's orders in the manor, but dealing with this second madam was always a hassle. Every time she saw her, a chill ran down her spine.

“Xiao Xiao, if the second madam needs you for something, just go. I’ll be fine here,” Qin Tian interjected, unable to bear seeing Xiao Xiao being scolded.

“Exactly! With Qin Tian here, you’ll be fine. You can’t really help much anyway. Don’t worry, I won’t take too much of your time. You can return here to stand guard in no time. Now hurry up and come with me!” Haoyue Lian Si shot her a sidelong glance before turning to leave. Although Xiao Xiao was reluctant to leave, she worried that the second madam might cause a scene and disturb the Third Miss, so she ultimately followed her.

“Second madam, what do you need me for?” Xiao Xiao asked quietly as she walked behind her.

“Xiao Xiao, tell me honestly—how is Nuo’er doing? What did the doctor say?” Haoyue Lian Si lowered her voice as they exited the courtyard, glancing around to ensure no one was listening.

“Second madam, the Third Miss only sustained a minor injury. She’s not seriously hurt; it’s just that the prince was too worried about her and summoned a doctor,” Xiao Xiao’s eyes flickered with a hint of disdain as she spoke, keeping her gaze lowered.

“Is that all? Xiao Xiao, I know you’re loyal to Nuo’er, but I’m her second mother too! I care about her well-being as well. Just tell me the truth—what’s really going on with her?” 

If there wasn’t something serious happening, why would they summon a doctor? Qin Tian wouldn’t answer her either, nor would he let her see Nuo’er. There had to be something more going on, Haoyue Lian Si insisted earnestly.

“Second madam, you’re overthinking it. The Second Miss is just a bit tired and resting in her room,” Xiao Xiao thought to herself, determined not to let slip any negative information about the Third Miss.

“Xiao Xiao, here’s the deal: if you tell me what’s going on with Nuo’er, I’ll give you this hairpin. It’s encrusted with gold and jewels, and it’ll last you a long time.” 

The atmosphere shifted as the promise of wealth dangled tantalizingly in the air, pulling Xiao Xiao’s attention toward the glimmering adornment, but her resolve remained firm. She was not going to betray the Third Miss’s trust, no matter the temptation.
