**The Temptation of the Night Coast! Part 5**

As she struggled with her overwhelming sensations, her hands instinctively began to explore her own body. Suddenly, the bright moon in the night sky was veiled by a thin, blood-red mist. In that moment of haze, the waves of the sea began to surge violently.

Before she could fully comprehend what was happening, a powerful force swept her away, leaving her disoriented and gasping. The impact of the torrent against her body jolted her awake, pulling her from her haze of desire.

In the crimson moonlight, she found herself caught in a whirlpool, the relentless currents dragging her deeper into the ocean's depths. Panic surged within her as she tried to swim toward the shore, but it was futile. All she could do was watch helplessly as the whirlpool swallowed her whole, her consciousness fading with the tide.

On the shore, her bodyguards witnessed the tumultuous waves pull her under. They exchanged worried glances, convinced that this was a grim fate for her. With heavy hearts, they turned away, heading back to report to Mr. Jin.

Time passed in a blur; eventually, Menghan slowly regained consciousness. As she opened her eyes, she was greeted by a blanket of stars twinkling against the deep blue sky, along with the delicate crescent moon hanging high above.

She blinked her enchanting eyes and shifted her body, only to realize that her lower half was submerged in water. To her shock, the only piece of clothing she had—her sheer undergarment—was nowhere to be found.

In that moment, she understood the gravity of her situation: she was completely exposed. A soft gasp escaped her lips as she instinctively wrapped her arms around her bare body and stood up from the water. A rush of warmth surged from her lower abdomen, spreading rapidly through her limbs.

"Damn it," Menghan muttered, memories flooding back of her last moments before losing consciousness. She had been on a mission to eliminate the crime lord, Mr. Jin, but had unwittingly fallen into his trap, succumbing to the aphrodisiac he had used against her. To her dismay, she realized that even after soaking in the sea for so long, the effects of the drug hadn’t faded.

It was now the dead of night, and she doubted anyone would come looking for her. The heat coursing through her body was becoming unbearable. If she didn't return to the water soon, she feared she'd be overwhelmed. Frustration bubbled within her as she scolded herself for being so careless—how could she have fallen for his scheme?

With no other choice, Menghan reluctantly stepped back into the chilling embrace of the water, hoping it would provide some relief from the intense heat that threatened to consume her.
