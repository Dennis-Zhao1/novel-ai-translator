**He’s Testing Her, Right? 2**

“He’s definitely trying to test her!” 

"Uncle brought me this osmanthus cake today; what exactly is he trying to probe?" Nango Nor was extracting a silver needle, finding nothing unusual. But she already knew that if he wanted to poison her, he wouldn’t be so blatant about it.

“Uncle is really strange. This osmanthus cake is something the Third Miss used to hate. He must have remembered it wrong." Xiaoxiao had planned to voice her thoughts but, upon seeing Uncle’s intense gaze, she held her tongue.

“What? Xiaoxiao, you mean I used to hate osmanthus cake the most?” A flicker of suspicion crossed her mind. Could it be that he was using this cake to test her loyalty?

“Yes, every time the Third Miss saw osmanthus cake, her mood would sour. I’m not sure what Uncle is up to. Third Miss, let me take this cake away.” Xiaoxiao gently picked up the osmanthus cake from the table and walked out.

“Nor, you’re up early for breakfast?” The man who had stormed out the night before now stood before her, looking somewhat sheepish.

“No, Uncle specifically went out to buy what he said was my favorite osmanthus cake from before. What about you? Are you really so free? Why are you here so early?” Nango Nor settled down beside the coffee table, taking a sip from the cup with a casual air, feigning indifference.

“I came to invite you to join me for breakfast. You can’t just let your uncle’s good intentions go to waste.” He had caught a whiff of osmanthus from Xiaoxiao’s hands; clearly, she had taken the cake away.

“Your Highness, you’re not telling me you can’t eat without me around, right?” A teasing smirk danced on her lips as she raised an eyebrow.

“Exactly. Without you by my side, I can’t eat at all. So, you better stick to me like glue.” Helian Yichen noticed her evasive nature but decided not to press further.

“I’m not your savior. If you starve, that’s your problem, not mine. Plus, my feet have a mind of their own; they’ll go wherever they please. No one can control me.” The idea of him trying to restrain her freedom was simply laughable.

“You heartless woman! I’ve gone out of my way for you, even breaking off my engagement with Ya Qing to please you. Can’t you show me a little kindness in return?” Was she truly that cold-hearted?

“I seem to recall you saying that you broke off your engagement not because of me, but because you had no feelings for her. Don’t pin that guilt on me; I can’t carry that weight.” Nango Nor stifled a yawn, fatigue washing over her.

“So you heard everything, huh? Then you should know I did all this for you. You must be tired; you didn’t sleep at all last night, did you? Why not go take a nap in your room?” Though he loathed her lack of affection, he couldn’t bear to see her suffer.

“If you hadn’t come to bother me so early, I would’ve gone back to sleep long ago. I’m off to rest now; do as you wish.” Nango Nor shot him an annoyed glance before turning to head back to her room.

“Isn’t it because I care about you that I came? Did you finish making the explosives last night?” Helian Yichen followed her inside.

“I’ve made two underwater mines that can detonate underwater. Everything is ready; just waiting for the right moment.” A cold smile flickered across Nango Nor’s face as she spoke.
