Here Comes the Show!

"Well, you have a point. Just this once, but you better not follow me around asking for my company again." Tuoba Tianye shot a secret signal to his subordinate, Chengde, who nodded in understanding. Chengde halted his steps, not following along but instead waiting for them to walk far enough away before returning to the street vendor selling whips to buy that soft whip.

"Miss, didn't you love that whip? Young Master Tuoba said he would give it to you. Why don't you want it?!" After leaving, Xiaoxiao asked in confusion.

"What’s to understand? The Third Miss isn't short on money; she just doesn’t want something from him. That cousin of his is just so annoying," Xiao Qi said, making a disgusted gesture.

"Stop speculating. I just don't want to owe anyone a favor," Nangong Nuoer interjected coldly, annoyed by their back-and-forth chatter.

"That's true; the hardest debt to repay is the debt of gratitude," Xiaoxiao nodded vigorously in agreement.

"Forget it, let's call it a day and head back to the villa," Nuoer said, her good mood already spoiled. It was a pity about the whip; if it weren't for her, it would have already been hers. A hint of regret crossed her face.

"We just got here! Why are we heading back so soon?" They had barely strolled around, and Xiaoxiao felt a bit reluctant to leave.

"Nuoer, you were reluctant when we left, right? Now that I'm saying we should go back, shouldn't you be happy?" Nuoer shot her a sideways glance.

"Hehe, I’m just worried something might happen to the Third Miss!" Xiaoxiao said, scratching her head in embarrassment.

"Everyone, step aside! Step aside!" Just as Nangong Nuoer and her friends were about to head back, several fierce voices reached their ears. The already bustling street suddenly erupted into chaos as pedestrians and street vendors hurriedly cleared the way.

"What’s going on up ahead?!" Xiaoxiao's cheeks twitched as she saw the commotion in front.

"It seems like some big shots are coming," Xiao Qi said, standing on her tiptoes to peer toward the chaotic scene. She spotted a few menacing thugs pushing through the crowd, quickly making their way toward them, shouting as if they were chasing someone.
