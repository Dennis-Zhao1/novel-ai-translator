He Still Wanted to Take Advantage of Her! 3

Just as his beak was about to peck at her face, Nanguo Nuo'er gripped one of its wings with one hand while pressing down on its neck with the other, effectively preventing it from pecking her at all.

The black eagle, realizing it had fallen into the hands of an enemy, quickly understood that escaping wouldn’t be easy. Fortunately, it still had its beak to call for help. It raised its head high and let out a sharp cry, directed towards its master who was practicing swordplay nearby.

“Oh, so you want to signal your master for help, huh?” Nanguo Nuo'er smirked with a hint of sarcasm, pulling a ribbon from her pocket to tie its beak shut, rendering it unable to call out.

She patted its head mockingly and said, “Lowly creatures are lowly creatures, lacking any sense of danger. You see a powerful creature like me, and instead of keeping your distance, you come right to me. Are you bored with life or something?”

The black eagle had always enjoyed a high status by its master’s side, cherished and never disturbed by anyone. It never expected to find itself in such a predicament, and now it glared at Nanguo Nuo'er with its shiny dark eyes, as if it wished to bore two holes right through her.

“What are you glaring at? Do you want me to dig your eyeballs out and soak them in wine?” It seemed this black eagle wasn’t just any ordinary bird; it understood the concept of glaring. The more it did, the more Nanguo Nuo'er wanted to cook it. She flashed it a sinister smile and said, “Given that you’re quite nutritious, I might consider giving you a quick end when I prepare you. But for now, let’s head to the kitchen together.”

With a smile on her face, she lifted the black eagle and started towards the kitchen, eager to prepare a dish with such untainted game—it was her favorite.

“Mmm-mmm-mmm…” The poor black eagle, now stripped of its former bravado, found itself unable to make a sound.

“Miss, hold on!” Just as Nanguo Nuo'er turned to leave, she suddenly felt a breeze as light as smoke brush against her. Following that was a deep, magnetic voice that came from behind her.

Hmm, that deep, magnetic voice sounds a bit familiar. There aren’t many people I know here. Nanguo Nuo'er’s body stiffened for a moment. Damn it, it was him. A quick recollection made her realize who was standing behind her.
