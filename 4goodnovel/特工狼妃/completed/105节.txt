As they blocked the door, Helyan Yichen's expression instantly turned icy. The violet hue in his eyes gleamed with a sharp, piercing light that bore down on them.

"Third Miss... she... no, Your Highness, we can't say anything. The Third Miss said not to tell anyone," Xiao Xiao stammered, flinching back behind Xiao Qi when met with Helyan Yichen's cold glare. Xiao Qi, feeling the pressure, had no choice but to speak up.
