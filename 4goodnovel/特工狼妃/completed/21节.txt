**The Mischievous Little Sprite Who Stole His Clothes!**

This is the bedroom of Nora Nangong, and it’s clear that being wealthy has its perks. The room is spacious, yet its decor is surprisingly understated, lacking any ostentatious extravagance. Menghan settles down at the vanity, gazing into the copper mirror, and can't help but frown at her reflection.

This face is undeniably hers, yet could it be that this Third Miss truly looks just like her? It’s astonishing to think that in this alternate world, there exists someone who mirrors her so closely. Menghan feels a twinge of melancholy at the thought. But from this moment on, she will step into the shoes of Nora Nangong. Although the name evokes an impression of fragility, she knows this is no weak woman. From now on, she is the Third Miss of Nangong Manor, Nora Nangong!

When Heryan Yichen finally awakens, the sun is high in the sky. He slowly opens his eyes, the sound of waves crashing against the shore fills his ears. With a sudden burst of energy, he pushes himself up off the ground. As he sits up, a few strands of hair fall from him. He squints at those black strands, and memories of the night before flood his mind—scenes of passion with a woman who resembled a sprite.

"Damn it! How could I have slept so deeply? I didn't even notice when she left." Heryan curses under his breath. He has never been the type to fall asleep after making love, so why did this happen?

He notices several dark red spots on the ground, the remnants of her virgin blood. He recalls her wild expression and initially assumed she must have been with many men before. To his surprise, she was still a virgin.

"Who gave you the right to leave after taking everything? No woman can take what isn’t hers from me. No matter where you flee, I will find you." 

Heryan reaches for the stray strands of hair, bringing them closer to his face. He breathes in deeply and is instantly hit by a faint, enchanting fragrance. Yes, this scent—it’s unique. He has never smelled anything like it on another woman.
