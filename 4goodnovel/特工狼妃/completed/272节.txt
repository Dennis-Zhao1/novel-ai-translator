Section 272: Don’t Beg for Mercy Later! (Part 2)
"I’ve always been this indifferent. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to force yourself to accommodate me." Her response was calm and unyielding, as if it carried no weight at all.

"You... You know, sometimes you make me so mad I just want to strangle you!" Helian Yichen growled, his frustration spilling over. That same infuriatingly detached tone, time and time again, made him grit his teeth in anger. He leaned down abruptly, his lips grazing the delicate curve of her neck before biting down firmly.

He hated how she could appear so cold, yet in fleeting moments, he could sense her warmth—only for it to slip away before he could grasp it. It was maddening, this endless dance of closeness and distance.

"Do you realize how childish you sound right now?" she said, her voice laced with an almost teasing composure. If he truly wanted to strangle her, he would have done it long ago. The sting of his bite caused her to furrow her brows slightly, but she made no move to push him away.

"Did you just call me childish?" Helian Yichen’s eyes darkened, a fiery anger surging within him. No one had ever dared to say that to him before. In one swift motion, he spun her around to face him, his lips crashing down onto hers in a fierce, unrelenting kiss.

His emotions were spiraling out of control, and she knew it. The slightest provocation could send him into a frenzy, and yet she couldn’t help the faint smile that tugged at the corners of her lips. Half-lidded eyes met his fiery gaze as she felt the intensity of his kiss deepen.

She neither resisted nor pushed him away, and her lack of rejection only emboldened him. His kiss grew more daring, his half-closed eyes scanning her expression for any hint of protest. When he found none, a spark of joy lit up within him. Could it be that this woman was finally starting to accept him?

"Let’s move to the bed," she murmured softly, her words laced with a subtle allure. The flames of desire were unmistakable in his eyes as he pulled back slightly, his lips hovering over hers. She wasn’t one to feign modesty; sometimes, even she wanted to give in to her desires.

"Are you inviting me?" he asked, his tone a mix of surprise and amusement. Bold as ever, this woman had just openly beckoned him. A wicked smile curled on his lips, his gaze darkening with anticipation as he watched her closely.
