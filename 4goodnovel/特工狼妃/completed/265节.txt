### A Relationship of Empty Promises! 1

"Don't worry, little sister, I’ll treat her well," Nankong Xudan reassured, thinking she was concerned about how he would treat Ziyan.

"That would be the best outcome. Grandma, I’m still feeling a bit unwell, so I think I’ll head back to rest for a while," Nankong Nuoer said as she stood up, addressing the elderly matriarch.

"You need to take care of yourself and rest more," the old lady replied with concern.

"Yes, Grandma, I’ll take my leave now," Nankong Nuoer said before turning to leave, with Helian Yichen following closely behind.

Despite Haoyue Liansi's strong opposition to Nankong Xudan taking Ziyan as a concubine, the approval of the elderly matriarch rendered her objections futile. In the end, she could only grudgingly accept this bitter reality.

Nankong Xudan’s union with Ziyan was understated; there was no grand banquet or even a celebratory outfit prepared. They merely conducted a simple ceremony, and just like that, Ziyan became his concubine.

In truth, he never intended to take a concubine, agreeing only out of necessity. When he arrived at the door of the bridal chamber that night, he lacked the courage to step inside. However, to avoid attracting attention, he had no choice but to go in, despite his reluctance.

"My lord, you’re back," Ziyan greeted him shyly, rising from her place as she approached. She was just a concubine, lacking even the basic red bridal veil, but she didn’t mind.

"You’re still awake?" Nankong Xudan glanced at her with an expressionless face before walking to the table and sitting down.

"Tonight is our wedding night. How could I dare sleep before you, my lord? Let’s drink the nuptial wine first," Ziyan suggested, pouring two cups of wine and pushing one toward him.

"You should know that I never truly wanted to take you as a concubine. Why do you cling to these empty rituals?" Nankong Xudan looked at the cup placed before him but made no move to lift it. He didn’t like her—no, he actually hated her. If she had rejected him that night, he wouldn’t have had to take her as a concubine. A sardonic smile crept onto his cold face.

"Even if you’re not sincere, things have come to this," Ziyan’s expression darkened, unable to hide her disappointment.
