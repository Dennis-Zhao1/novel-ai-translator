**She Wants to Go Out with Her Cousin!**

“Sanlang, how many times have I told you? A real man should remain calm in the face of danger. Are you acting like the sky has fallen or the earth has cracked?!” In the finance room, Tobias Tianye was reviewing the ledgers submitted from various locations. His voice was deep and resonant, carrying a hint of rich magnetism. Anyone who hadn’t seen him would guess he was a middle-aged man due to his authoritative presence, but in reality, he was just shy of thirty, a remarkably charming man radiating a captivating, sunny aura.

“Big brother, I really can’t stay calm this time. Just take a look.” Di Sanlang pulled a secret letter from his pocket and handed it over. “If this matter gets tied to us, it will tarnish the reputation of our Golden Dragon Society.”

“That's just your nature.” Tobias shook his head at him, opening the letter. As his eyes fell on the contents, his brows knitted together slightly.

“Look at this! They’ve gone and done something like this. Isn’t it obvious they want the court to grab hold of our weak spots?!” Di Sanlang’s face turned red with anger as he shouted.

“Sanlang, the damage has already been done. What good does it do to shout and scream here? The most important thing now is to find a way to resolve it.” After reading the letter, Tobias's expression shifted only momentarily before returning to its usual calm. It seemed the matter described in the letter didn’t faze him in the least.

“I know we need to find a solution, but I’ve heard the court has already sent people to intervene. If they catch us off guard, won’t they take the chance to strike at us?!” Di Sanlang remained worried.

“Though the court is somewhat displeased with our control over the grain transport, the taxes we pay each year are one of their main sources of income. For now, they won’t dare to act against us.” Tobias crumpled the letter into a ball and held it in his palm. When he opened his hand again, the letter had turned to dust, which he gently blew away into the air.

“While that may be true, if something really happens, it’ll still tarnish the reputation of the Golden Dragon Society.” Di Sanlang was clearly thinking of their organization’s well-being, still looking anxious.

“Tomorrow, I’ll personally go and inquire about the situation. But I can’t say when I’ll be back. Sanlang, I’m leaving the Golden Dragon Society in your care for the time being.”

In this moment, the tension in the air was palpable, as the weight of responsibility rested heavily on both their shoulders. Di Sanlang nodded, his expression a mixture of determination and concern. The fate of their society hung in the balance, and he was acutely aware that every decision they made could lead to their downfall or their salvation.
