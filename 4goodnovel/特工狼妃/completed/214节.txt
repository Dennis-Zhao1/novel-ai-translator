**A Strong-Willed Woman! 2**

She seemed like a delicate little woman, yet her stubbornness was off the charts. It was perplexing—why was she so headstrong? Oddly enough, he felt no embarrassment at her defiance; instead, he found it amusing. He must be losing his mind, or perhaps he had simply fallen for a woman who thrived on challenges.

Nangong Nuo’er ignored his frustrated outburst and stepped outside. The dining table in the hall was already laden with a variety of light dishes. She glanced around but noticed that Xiao Xiao was missing. Only Ziyan and Xiao Qi were present, and they both looked a bit downcast.

“Xiao Qi, where’s Xiao Xiao? Why isn’t she here?!” Where could that girl have gone? She was usually glued to Nuo’er’s side, and now that Nuo’er needed her, it was even less likely she would leave. Taking a seat at the table, Nuo’er couldn’t help but notice that the food had just been served, steam rising from the dishes. Her stomach was already growling in protest.

“Third Miss, Xiao Xiao suddenly felt unwell, so I sent her back to rest. She probably won’t be able to take care of you for the next couple of days,” Xiao Qi said, his eyes downcast, his face pale and somber.

“Xiao Xiao is unwell? But she seemed fine this morning!” Nuo’er paused, her chopsticks hovering mid-air as she fixed a sharp gaze on Xiao Qi. His demeanor was tense, and his eyes flickered, revealing a hint of discomfort. He was a simple, honest boy, and his feelings were always evident on his face. She was certain he was hiding something from her.

“Third Miss, I assure you, Xiao Xiao really isn’t feeling well. Women can be sensitive like that; if they say they’re unwell, they are. For now, let me take care of you for these couple of days,” Ziyan chimed in, her calm demeanor contrasting with Xiao Qi’s distress. Having been in service before becoming someone’s concubine, she was no stranger to looking after others, and it didn’t faze her at all.

“Hmm,” Nuo’er nodded slightly, a lingering sense of unease gnawing at her, but she chose not to press the matter further.

“Nuo’er, weren’t you starving? Why did you suddenly stop eating?!” Helyan Yichen finally emerged, having composed himself in the inner chamber. He took a seat beside her and began serving her dishes.

“I just found it strange that Xiao Xiao would leave me at this time,” Nuo’er replied coolly before lifting her chopsticks again and continuing to eat. She accepted the food he offered without protest, even as her mind drifted back to her missing companion.
