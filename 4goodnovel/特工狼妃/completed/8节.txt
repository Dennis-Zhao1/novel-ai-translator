Section 8: The Temptation by the Night Coast
“Woman, you’ll regret those bold words,” he said, his voice a mix of challenge and intrigue. Her appearance exuded innocence, but her actions were anything but. The contradiction was mesmerizing—a pure and untamed spirit coexisting in one person. It stirred something primal within him, an allure he found impossible to resist.

“That depends on whether you’re up to the task,” Dream Han replied, a playful smile curving her lips. Before he could make a move, she glided effortlessly through the water toward him. Her graceful, fluid motions were like a water serpent as she wrapped herself around him, her touch both warm and disarming.

“You’re bold, but I like it,” he murmured, his tone a mixture of admiration and desire. As her lithe body pressed against his, her warmth seeped into his skin, igniting sparks between them. Her behavior, so unrestrained and uninhibited, rivaled even the most practiced courtesans. He wasn’t naïve enough to believe she was innocent, but the mystery around her only deepened his fascination.

One arm circled her slender waist, his fingers tracing the curve of her back. With his other hand, he gently tilted her chin upward. Her flushed face resembled a delicate bloom, her eyes smoldering with unspoken promises. Her lips, soft and slightly parted, seemed to beckon him, tempting him to close the distance.

“Well, if you’re so willing, what’s stopping you?” Dream Han teased, her voice a sultry whisper. Her hand rested on his chest, her fingers exploring the firm muscles beneath the thin layer of fabric. Even through his clothes, she could sense the strength of his body, sculpted and refined. Her touch glided downward, and she couldn’t help but marvel at his perfect proportions and lean, powerful frame.

“Hold on,” he interrupted, his voice sharp yet steady. “Before anything else, I need to know—are you clean?”

His question was blunt, but not unexpected. She was breathtakingly beautiful, with delicate brows, enchanting eyes, and skin as smooth as jade. Her petite frame exuded elegance and allure, her presence almost hypnotic. But as captivating as she was, he wasn’t reckless enough to let desire cloud his judgment. After all, charm could be a dangerous weapon, and even the most beautiful flower could hide a deadly sting.
