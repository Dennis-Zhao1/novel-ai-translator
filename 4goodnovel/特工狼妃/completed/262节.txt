**He Wants to Take a Concubine! 6**

The bright moonlight spilled over the room, casting soft shadows as it landed on Nangong Nuo'er’s face. She sat there, calm and composed, as if nothing had ever happened. A slight narrowing of her eyes hinted at a deeper thought—why was she so unfazed?

Did she even feel the slightest surprise? Was it her doing? Did she know that she had marred Xiaoxiao’s face and was now taking it out on his son? Xiaoxiao was just a servant, and he was her elder brother; how could she be so cruel?

“Grandmother, Mother, I want to take a concubine.” Nangong Xuduan’s gaze remained fixed on Nangong Nuo'er as he made his declaration. A faint, ambiguous smile played on her lips. In front of everyone, there was no refusal of Helian Yichen’s indulgence. She accepted even when he fed her morsels of food, clearly performing for his eyes. When he announced his intention to take a concubine, he could almost hear his heart shattering at the thought.

“What? You want to take a concubine? Who do you want to take?! I’ve never heard you mention taking a concubine before!” Upon hearing his words, the color drained from Lianyue's face. He hadn't even married yet, and he was already thinking of taking a concubine?

“Mother, I’ve made up my mind to take a concubine; it’s my sister’s maid, Ziyan. We’ve been involved for some time now,” Nangong Xuduan stated, taking a deep breath before speaking.

“What? You want to take Nuo'er’s maid as a concubine? Are you out of your mind? You’re the eldest son of Nangong Manor; there are plenty of noble ladies out there for you to choose from! Why would you pick a servant?” Lianyue’s voice rose in anger, her reaction immediate and fierce.

“Mother, although Ziyan is just a maid, she comes from a respectable family and is a good woman. What’s wrong with taking her as a concubine?!” Nangong Xuduan’s expression remained unchanged, but his voice was firm against her opposition.

“No way! If you want to take a concubine, she must be a noble lady, not some servant girl! Absolutely not!” Lianyue was livid. She had always urged him to marry and take a concubine, and he used the excuse that he was too busy managing the manor to find a bride. Now he was involved with a maid from his sister’s household? Wasn’t this going to bring her shame? Was this Nuo'er’s scheme?

The tension in the room thickened, emotions swirling like the autumn leaves outside, each gust of wind carrying whispers of discontent and looming conflict.
