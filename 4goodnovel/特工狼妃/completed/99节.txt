**Chapter 5: Moderation Prevents Addiction**

Nangong Nuo'er was unfazed by his words. She wheeled herself out into the spacious hall, where she picked up a book she had already flipped through several times before, deciding to read it from cover to cover once again.

As she immersed herself in studying the history of the Helian Kingdom, urgent footsteps echoed from outside. A familiar medicinal scent wafted through the air. For some unknown reason, the moment she caught a whiff of that scent, an intense craving surged within her, compelling her to drink the medicine that had been brought for her.

"Third Miss, I’m so sorry! I had prepared the medicine for you, but then I was knocked over by a stray cat, so I’m late in delivering it. I’m truly sorry!" The maid, Xiaoxi, rushed in, cradling a bowl of medicine in her hands, her voice laced with urgency.

"No wonder the Third Miss has been feeling dizzy today. It’s because you didn’t deliver the medicine on time! Xiaoxi, do you even realize that your negligence could harm the Third Miss? She was in agony just a moment ago, all because of you!" Upon recalling how Nangong Nuo'er had appeared in distress earlier, Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but scold Xiaoxi sternly.

"It wasn’t on purpose! Third Miss, please drink your medicine!" Xiaoxi said, slightly trembling as she presented the bowl to Nangong Nuo'er.

"Okay." Nangong Nuo'er set her book aside, reaching for the bowl. Just as she brought the edge of the bowl to her lips, a jolt of hesitation coursed through her mind, freezing her in place.

"Third Miss, what’s wrong? Is the medicine too hot? Let me cool it down for you first," Xiaoxiao suggested, noticing that Nangong Nuo'er was holding the bowl but hadn’t taken a sip.

"Mm." Nangong Nuo'er fought against her urge to drink the medicine and instructed Xiaoxi, "You can leave now; there’s no need for you to stay here."

"Third Miss, I think I should wait until you’ve finished your medicine before leaving. I need to take the bowl back with me," Xiaoxi replied, her eyes flickering nervously as she glanced at Xiaoxiao, who was poised to take the bowl.

"Once I finish the medicine, I’ll have Xiaoxiao return the bowl to the kitchen. You can go now," Nangong Nuo'er said, narrowing her eyes and adopting a tone that allowed no room for refusal.

"Since that’s the case, I’ll take my leave then." Xiaoxi had intended to wait until Nangong Nuo'er had finished her medicine, but she knew she had to obey her master’s order and reluctantly exited the room.

As the door closed behind Xiaoxi, the atmosphere shifted slightly, leaving just Nangong Nuo'er and Xiaoxiao in the hall. The space felt quieter, the air thick with unspoken tension. Nangong Nuo'er stared at the bowl of medicine, her mind swirling with conflicting thoughts. The familiar scent was both comforting and suffocating, reminding her of moments when she had felt weaker than she wished to admit.

Xiaoxiao stood beside her, her expression softening as she noticed the internal struggle on Nangong Nuo’er's face. "Third Miss, it’s okay to take your time. You don’t have to rush," she said gently, her voice a soothing balm against the anxiety brewing in the room.

"Thank you, Xiaoxiao," Nangong Nuo'er replied, her voice barely above a whisper. She took a deep breath, calming the storm within her, and finally brought the bowl closer, ready to confront the medicine that had become a symbol of her reliance.
