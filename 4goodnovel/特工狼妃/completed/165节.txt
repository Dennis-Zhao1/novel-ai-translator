"Jump off the cliff if you want to follow me!"

She always felt as though two sharp gazes trailed her like a shadow. Just moments ago, she had single-handedly defeated a group of ten henchmen, and she was well aware that she had drawn considerable attention. There were many eyes on her, but none compared to those two piercing looks that seemed capable of devouring her whole. She turned her head abruptly, attempting to locate the source of those stares, but found nothing suspicious. Instead, she noticed that the girl they had just rescued was limping along not far behind them. She couldn't help but furrow her brow and said, "Xiao Xiao, go ask her if she has any questions."

"Yes, Miss San." Xiao Xiao had already noticed the girl trailing them from a distance but understood that it was quite rare for Miss San to have intervened to save someone. Therefore, she had kept quiet. Hearing her now ask her to inquire, she immediately turned and dashed over.

"Miss San, what kind of martial arts were you using back there? It looked strange but was incredibly powerful. What exactly was that?" As Xiao Xiao approached the girl, the curious boy, Xiao Qi, couldn’t help but ask with wide eyes.

"What I used just now is called Tai Chi." In this era, there shouldn’t be anyone like Zhang Sanfeng yet, and Nangong Nuo’er maintained a stoic expression as she replied.

"Tai Chi? What kind of martial arts is that? I've never seen it before. The moves you used seemed quite simple, yet the power they unleashed was immense," he said, admiration evident in his tone.

"It was taught to me by a master. He only showed me how to perform it, and I’m not very clear on the rest." If he knew about this technique, it would be strange indeed. Nangong Nuo’er paused, choosing to downplay the details.

"Oh, I see." Xiao Qi scratched his head, still a bit baffled.

"Miss San, this is Ziyan. She wants to ask you for shelter," at that moment, Xiao Xiao returned with the girl named Ziyan.

"Miss San, I know you're from the Nangong family. Please take me in. If I fall into the hands of the Lord, I will die." After witnessing one of his men being thoroughly humiliated by a woman in front of so many people, he would undoubtedly feel a significant loss of face. If she were captured and taken back, it would be a one-way ticket to doom for her.
