**Chapter 4: A Willing Sacrifice!**

But he was the young master of the Nangong Manor, so much better than the man she had been with before. Yet, she didn't want to be anyone's substitute.

Nangong Xudan, seeing her persistently refusing to open her lips for him to kiss her deeply, couldn't help but feel a surge of frustration. He pulled away from her mouth, his eyes flashing with anger as he growled, “Why won’t you let me kiss you? Why? Is he the only one in your heart? I’ve been by your side for so long, don’t you have any feelings for me at all?”

“Young Master, wake up. I’m Ziyan, not the Young Lady,” Ziyan replied softly. Looking at the pain etched on his face, her heart suddenly ached. At this moment, she should have felt fear and dread, but instead, she felt a rush of sympathy for him. He had fallen for her sister; he must be suffering immensely. Their love was taboo, a forbidden romance that society would never accept. She couldn’t help but pity him.

“Your heart only belongs to him. You don’t care about me at all…” Nangong Xudan seemed deaf to her words, as he became listless, rolling off her and sitting despondently to the side, covering his pained face with his hands.

“Young Master.” Watching him in such agony shook Ziyan to her core. She bit her lip and, surprisingly to herself, loosened the belt around her waist. With unexpected resolve, she opened her arms and embraced Nangong Xudan. Looking up at him, she said, “Young Master, I know you’re hurting. If I can comfort you, I’m willing to…”

“You…” He was taken aback by her sudden embrace, and his eyes widened in shock. Slowly, he lowered his head, as if finally realizing the person before him wasn’t the one he had longed for. He pushed her away, as if she were a hot potato.

“Young Master, you want me, don’t you? Even if I’m not the Third Young Lady, I can’t bear to see you in such pain.” Ziyan hadn’t expected him to reject her so brutally. Feeling the sting of rejection, she didn’t give up.

“No, you’re Ziyan, not her. It can’t be…” Nangong Xudan gripped his hair in frustration, turning his back to her as he said painfully, “Just go. You’re not her. I don’t want to hurt you. Please leave…”

“Please, Young Master, don’t send me away. I won’t tell anyone,” Ziyan pleaded, as if under a spell. 

The air around them grew thick with tension, each heartbeat echoing the unspoken emotions swirling between them.
