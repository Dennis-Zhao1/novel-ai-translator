He Actually Encouraged Her to Keep Eating! 3

“Uncle, how can you encourage me to keep consuming this harmful stuff?! If you came here just for that, you can leave. I don’t want to see you again.”

Nangong Nuo'er was furious. She couldn’t believe he would actually suggest she continue taking the black jade ointment. Was he really looking out for her or trying to do her harm?

“Nuo Nuo, I’m doing this for your own good. I don’t want to see you become someone who looks neither human nor ghost,” Nangong Yulou said, his voice tinged with urgency as he saw her refusing to listen. He was genuinely worried about her.

“If I keep taking that cursed stuff, I’ll definitely end up looking like a monster. I believe I can quit this addiction,” she declared firmly. She had brushed death too many times to count and refused to believe she couldn’t overcome this poison. 

“Nuo Nuo, why put yourself through this?! It can kill you.” Nangong Yulou’s face flushed with anxiety. No one could resist the allure of the black jade ointment; at least, he had never heard of anyone being able to quit it.

“Hmph! Even if I die, I won’t touch it again. You should just give up on that idea.” She had thought he was coming to support her in her fight against addiction, but to her dismay, he was there trying to pull her back into the abyss. Angrily, Nangong Nuo'er pushed her wheelchair away, feeling betrayed. She had once held him in such high regard, but now she realized how wrong she had been.

“Nuo Nuo, you’ll need it eventually. You won’t last long without it.” Watching her leave, Nangong Yulou’s clear, spring-like eyes suddenly flickered with an unsettling gleam.

She had moved out, and the spacious courtyard felt eerily quiet, devoid of any life. Helian Yichen’s injuries had mostly healed, but his mood was far from good. He stood by the window, feeding his black eagle while glancing back towards the table repeatedly, yet no matter how many times he looked, the charming figure in the chair was no longer there.

“Master, the black eagle is already full. If you keep feeding it, it might just suffer from indigestion.” Qin Tian, who was standing nearby, noticed his distracted state. He was aware that Helian Yichen was missing the third young lady, even if he stubbornly refused to admit it.

“Black eagle, you’re already full! Why do you keep eating? Are you trying to become a gluttonous bird?!”
