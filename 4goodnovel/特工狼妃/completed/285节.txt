She was just waiting to see his show! 

"If we didn’t have any humanity left, do you think you’d still be alive to stand here? You understand what I’m saying, so hurry back to the capital. I don’t want to see you again." He knew she was a spoiled little princess, but he had no idea that her methods of causing harm were just as ruthless as those of any villain. Since she was his fiancée, he could let her off this time, but there would be no second chances because he wouldn’t allow it.

"What are you talking about? You need to explain yourself clearly, or I’m not going anywhere." As she watched him turn away with a dismissive flick of his sleeve, Yaoqing quickly tried to catch up with him. But just a few steps in, a tall figure blocked her path.

"Princess, please return. The prince doesn’t wish to see you right now," Qintian said, standing firm to prevent her from following Helyan Yichen any further.

"Qintian, how dare you! You actually have the audacity to block my way!" Yaoqing, already burning with rage, raised her hand to slap his face.

"Princess, I’m just following orders. Please understand," Qintian replied, maintaining a calm demeanor. He was no ordinary guard; he was fiercely loyal to Helyan Yichen and had no need to tolerate her tantrums, especially since she was just an ordinary princess. He raised his arm to block her hand, his voice steady and unfazed.

"You—get out of my way! Why is everyone picking on me today?" Yaoqing seethed, feeling utterly aggrieved.

"Princess, allow me to escort you back to the inn," Qintian suggested politely, seemingly ignoring her outburst.

"Back to where? You must know what they were talking about just now, right?" She pressed, convinced that as someone who always stayed close to Helyan Yichen, he must be aware of the conversation.

"Princess, do you really want me to say it?" Qintian's expression remained unchanged, but he hoped she would retract her words. After all, bringing this to light would only make her look bad.

"I demand you say it! Why do you have so much nonsense to waste?" Unfortunately, the headstrong Yaoqing didn’t grasp his intentions.

"Very well, since the princess insists, I suppose I must comply." 

"Then hurry up! I’ve never met such a picky man before."

"Just now, Miss Nuo and the prince were referring to the incident involving you and Miss Nuo, such as when you mixed black jade ointment into her medicine..." Qintian paused when he noticed her face go pale, deciding not to say any more.

"Are you implying that I poisoned her?" How could they possibly know? She had never revealed herself in front of them.

"Princess, whether you did or not, everyone is already aware. Now that you’ve learned what you wanted to know, can you return to the inn?" The sun was setting, and while she didn’t need to sleep, he was eager to catch up on rest.

"Hmph! I have my own feet; I don’t need an escort." The realization that they had known all along struck Yaoqing deeply, but she refused to show weakness. With a cold snort, she turned towards the inn, her heart filled with rage at the events of the night. If they thought she would just back down easily, they were sorely mistaken. She would make them regret underestimating her. 

The night had just begun, and she was far from finished.
