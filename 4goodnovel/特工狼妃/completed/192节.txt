**Chapter 2: Kissed in Public!**

“Turns out Nuo’er is your woman, Your Highness. I apologize; it seemed like she was having some trouble with her foot, so I just helped her a bit.” His gaze was sharp, the deep purple of his eyes flashing with a warning light. The intensity of his possessiveness was surprising; it was as if he was defending his most precious treasure. A hint of an apologetic smile crossed Tuoba Tianye's face as he spoke.

“Helian Yichen, you’re going too far! Big Brother Tianye, don’t listen to his nonsense! I’m not his woman! Helian Yichen, let me go! Did you hear me? Let me go!” Nanguang Nuo’er shouted, her frustration boiling over. She was truly incensed; since she couldn’t break free from his grasp, she raised her fist and pounded against his chest with all her might.

How long had they known each other? And here she was calling him Big Brother Tianye so quickly? Hearing Nanguang Nuo’er’s words, Helian Yichen's face immediately darkened.

“Your Highness, Nuo’er just said she isn’t your woman. Forcing a woman like this doesn’t seem right,” Tuoba Tianye interjected. He hadn’t intended to meddle, but since Nuo’er had already called him ‘Big Brother,’ he felt he couldn’t just stand by.

“She’s just throwing a tantrum. Give it some time, and she won’t be pushing me away anymore. I don’t like outsiders interfering in our matters,” Helian Yichen replied, his eyes narrowing as he sized up Tuoba Tianye. He was clearly asserting his territory, not wanting anyone to intrude on their affairs.

“Bullshit! Don’t think just because you’re a prince, you can control how others feel! Let me go... let go of me!” Nanguang Nuo’er continued to struggle, ready to unleash her fury on him. But before she could finish her sentence, his lips suddenly descended on hers, forcefully sealing her mouth shut. He actually had the audacity to kiss her in front of so many people! Nanguang Nuo’er’s beautiful eyes widened in shock, disbelief flooding her expression.

Ignoring the stares around them, Helian Yichen pressed her back firmly against him, holding her tightly against his tall, muscular frame. His tongue, filled with wild rage, plunged deep into her mouth, as if declaring to everyone that she belonged to him alone. No one else could touch her. 

He was relentless, making her squirm and writhe in his embrace. But slowly, she began to lose strength, her body feeling weak, gradually melting into his hold. Only then did he seem satisfied, shifting to savor her sweetness with tender teasing. 

As the crowd looked on, the tension in the air crackled, a mix of shock and intrigue swirling around them.
