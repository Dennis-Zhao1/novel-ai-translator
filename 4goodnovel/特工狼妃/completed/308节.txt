**Final Chapter! 17**

In a desperate attempt to fulfill his prison sentence, General Helian Yichen had to exert every ounce of strength and negotiation skills to convince himself to part with Ziyan, ultimately agreeing to relinquish her contract of servitude.

As Helian Yichen let out a sigh of relief and hurried out of the mountain villa, he was dismayed to find that aside from the soldiers still busy with the villa's confiscation, no one else was around. His handsome brows knitted together in frustration. Where the hell was Qin Tian? Hadn't he ordered him to block off Nangong Nuo'er and her companions before he emerged?

"Have you seen the Third Miss Nangong? Where did she go?" Helian Yichen caught hold of a soldier, his expression darkening menacingly.

"Your Highness, the Third Miss Nangong left the villa not long ago," the soldier stammered, flinching at the intensity of Helian's gaze.

"And my guard, Qin Tian? Where is he?" Helian Yichen's expression grew even more thunderous.

"He left with the Third Miss Nangong," the soldier replied, his voice trembling.

"What?!" Helian Yichen couldn't believe his ears. He pressed for confirmation, his disbelief morphing into rage. That damn Qin Tian—he ordered him to stop Nuo'er, not run off with her! Who was his master now?

"Your Highness's guard, Qin Tian, has left with the Third Miss Nangong. I heard they were heading for the most luxurious inn in town."

"Damn it, Qin Tian! When I find him, I swear I'll make him pay!" Helian Yichen's frustration boiled over as he let out a long, howling shout into the sky.

Almost immediately, a sharp call echoed in response, and a dark shadow swooped down from the sky like a bolt of lightning. The astonished crowd watched as a jet-black eagle landed on Helian Yichen's shoulder, affectionately nuzzling his neck.

"Black Eagle, you’re the only one who understands me," Helian Yichen murmured, seemingly oblivious to the astonishment around him as he stroked the soft feathers of the bird before swiftly making his exit.

By the time the onlookers regained their composure, he had vanished without a trace.

As expected, Nangong Nuo'er was someone who knew how to indulge herself; anything less than the most luxurious inn was unacceptable. Helian Yichen quickly tracked them down, and when he arrived at the inn, he found that Nuo'er was already resting.

"Your Highness, my sister is very tired and has already gone to sleep. If you have something to discuss, please wait until she wakes up," Xiaoxiao, Nuo'er's companion, blocked his way just as he was about to enter.

"I only want to see her; I won’t disturb her," Helian Yichen replied, his patience wearing thin as he faced the obstinate guard.

"But she’s a light sleeper! If you go in now, you’ll surely wake her," Xiaoxiao insisted, clearly caught in a dilemma.

"Xiaoxiao, once we return to the capital, I will make your sister my princess. Do I need your permission just to see her?" Helian Yichen's violet eyes flashed with irritation, a clear warning sign of his brewing temper.

"Your Highness, please forgive me; that wasn't my intention. I’m just following my sister's orders," Xiaoxiao stammered, her scalp prickling under his intense gaze. A sinking feeling settled in her stomach; she sensed that the days ahead would not be easy.
