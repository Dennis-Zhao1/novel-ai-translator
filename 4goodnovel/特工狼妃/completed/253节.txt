**I'm Here for You!** 

Seeing him look utterly terrified at the mention of Helyan Yichen, the woman in white couldn't help but feel a swell of anger. She had never encountered a man so utterly spineless before, and without thinking, she raised her hand and slapped him across the face. 

“You… why did you hit me?!” Nangong Xudan exclaimed, bewildered and clutching his stinging cheek. Even with his usually calm demeanor, he couldn't help but snap back, his eyes narrowing dangerously at her.

“Exactly! This is how you should be! Don’t let me see you acting like such a coward again, or I won’t go easy on you next time,” the woman in white said, satisfaction gleaming in her eyes as she took in his fierce expression.

“What do you want from me? You said you were going to help me—how exactly are you going to do that?!” Nangong Xudan stammered, momentarily taken aback as he realized she was trying to ignite his fighting spirit.

“As long as you obediently listen to me, the person you desire will eventually fall into your embrace,” she replied, her gaze locking onto him, her eyes glinting with a strange and ominous light.

After leaving Nangong Xudan’s residence, Nangong Nuo'er didn’t return to Helyan Yichen’s dorm but instead went back to her own place. 

Once inside her room, she retrieved the whip that Tuoba Tianye had gifted her. Stepping into the courtyard, she began to practice with it, each crack of the whip echoing like an extension of her own fists—each strike sharp and fierce. In no time, the potted plants and flowers scattered around the courtyard were left in disarray as if a powerful storm had swept through.

“Haah…” After venting her frustrations, Nangong Nuo'er tossed the whip to the ground, breathing heavily. As her heart rate began to slow, a clean handkerchief suddenly appeared in front of her, accompanied by a familiar male voice that made her heart skip a beat. “Practicing whip techniques alone in the dead of night, don’t you think that’s a bit lonely? Not even a single audience to cheer you on.”

“It’s you! How did you get here?!” Nangong Nuo'er didn’t need to look up to know who stood before her. She reached out to take the handkerchief from him, but he pulled back just out of her reach. Surprised, she felt a hand lift her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze.

“No matter where you are, I can always find you.”
