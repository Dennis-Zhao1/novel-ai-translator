He Had Hit Her Hard with a Fist! 2

"Norah." The moment his fist struck her body with force, he regretted it deeply. But it was too late—the arrow had already been released. He could only retract some of his strength, but it was still enough to injure her. As he watched her body slowly collapse, he hurriedly extended his trembling arm to catch her.

"Miss Norah!" Upon seeing Nangong Norah fall, Xiao Xiao let out a sharp scream and rushed toward her. What she saw made her heart drop; Norah’s face had turned as pale as a sheet of paper, and a trickle of bright red blood seeped from the corner of her lips. Her eyes were half-closed, as if she lacked the strength to even keep them open.

"Miss Norah!" Observing the prince's punch land squarely on Nangong Norah, Xiao Qi was taken aback. He genuinely thought the prince wouldn’t lay a hand on her. He followed Xiao Xiao closely, running toward them.

"Norah, Norah, how are you? I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to do that." Seeing her cheeks, whiter than paper, Hélian Yicheng felt a sharp pain in his heart. He quickly scooped her up and shouted to Xiao Qi, who was approaching, “Hurry and fetch a doctor!”

"Yes, Xiao Xiao, keep an eye on them. I’ll go get the doctor right now!" Xiao Qi cast a worried glance at them before turning and racing out to find help.

"Ah... it hurts..." Nangong Norah felt a searing pain in her lower abdomen, as if it were being torn apart. She clutched his shoulder tightly, her sharp nails nearly digging into his flesh. Cold sweat poured down her forehead, and she tried to move her lips to speak, but all that escaped her was a cry of anguish.

"Norah, how can you be in such pain?!" Hélian Yicheng saw the beads of sweat glistening on her forehead and the deep purple in his eyes shimmered with regret. How could this be happening? He had clearly reduced some of his strength with that punch. She was more than capable; that punch shouldn’t have affected her this way. Confusion swirled in his mind as he hurriedly carried her toward his courtyard.

"Because Miss Norah is on her period today, and the prince's punch was too heavy. She will definitely suffer repercussions from this." Xiao Xiao usually feared him, but this time, he had hurt the most important person to her. There was no way she could give him a good look now. She glared at him furiously—how could he raise his fist against Miss Norah?
