**Chapter 4: Holding His Hand Relentlessly!**

“That’s a pity. I was hoping to have a detailed discussion with the Second Master, but it’s alright. I’ll be staying at the Nangong Manor for a while, so when you have some time, I’ll come find you again,” Takuba Tianye said, a glimmer of interest dancing in his strikingly handsome features as he watched Nangong Yulou turn away.

“No need. I’m busy every day. If you have anything to discuss, just go directly to Xudan,” Nangong Yulou replied, his tone unyielding as he brushed off Takuba’s advances.

“Is that so? Then I won’t disturb you for now; I bid you farewell.” Takuba Tianye gazed at the slightly frail silhouette of Yulou as he walked away, a thoughtful sparkle flickering in his deep-set eyes.

“Takuba, now that you have seen enough of the Nangong Manor, where else do you want to go?!” Once they left Yulou's courtyard, Nangong Nuoer felt a bit fatigued. She wasn’t a tour guide; why should she exhaust herself showing him around the estate? It seemed like a thankless task.

“Third Miss, you look a bit tired. Let’s call it a day,” Takuba Tianye said, his keen perception allowing him to see through her thoughts. She made no effort to hide her weariness, so he chose to let it slide.

“Alright, then I’ll have someone take you to your guest room. Steward, please help Takuba arrange his accommodation,” Nuoer instructed the steward trailing behind her.

“Understood, Third Miss,” the steward nodded in agreement.

“Third Miss, since we’ll all be living together from now on, how about you just call me by my name? It feels a bit awkward to call me ‘the head’ here, after all,” Takuba Tianye’s face broke into a subtle smile, but his resolute gaze carried an air of insistence that was hard to refuse.

“Calling you by your name seems a bit inappropriate. How about ‘Brother Tianye’ instead?” Nuoer mused, noting that he was likely older than Nangong Yulou. Addressing him as ‘brother’ felt a little youthful, but it felt right in her mind.

“Alright then, from now on, I’ll call you Nuoer,” Takuba Tianye said, a rich laughter escaping his lips.

“Suit yourself. It’s getting late; let the steward show you to your room. I must excuse myself now,” Nuoer replied nonchalantly, giving him a slight nod. Just as she turned to leave, she suddenly felt two searing gazes fixed on her from a distance. Instinctively alert, she turned her gaze towards the source of that intense scrutiny.

As she looked up, the atmosphere around her shifted subtly, the air thickened with unspoken tension. What she saw sent a shiver down her spine. Two figures leaned casually against a tree, their expressions unreadable, yet their eyes burned with curiosity and something else she couldn't quite place. 

“Who are they?” she wondered internally, her heart racing. Nuoer felt an instinctive need to retreat, but curiosity anchored her feet to the ground. It was a strange mix of fear and intrigue, drawing her nearer to the enigmatic duo. 

“Maybe it’s just my imagination,” she tried to convince herself, but the intensity of their gazes only deepened her concerns. Having spent her life in the relatively safe confines of the manor, the sudden sense of being watched was both exhilarating and unsettling.

Nuoer took a deep breath, steadying herself as she prepared to confront whatever this situation was leading to. She knew that the world outside the manor was filled with unpredictable elements, and she was about to step into that unknown.
