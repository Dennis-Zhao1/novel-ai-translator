**Chapter 4: He Still Wanted to Take Advantage of Her!**

As soon as Darkhawk heard its master’s voice, it perked up, excitedly looking back at him, clearly seeking help.

"Sorry, I’m really busy. Excuse me." After that night, she had no desire to interact with him again. Besides, she didn’t care about that flimsy piece of virginity; one-night stands were common these days. With that thought, Nango No'er quickly stepped away.

"Miss, you’ve caught my Darkhawk. Please, have mercy and let it go." This Darkhawk had been by his side for years; watching it being taken away was hard for him to accept. He couldn’t understand why she was leaving as soon as she heard him, and seeing her hurry away made him stubbornly follow her.

"This Darkhawk is yours? It attacked me on its own, and I was startled. I need to stew it to restore my strength." The fact that someone could raise such a bird suggested their character couldn’t be too far off. The thought of him possibly being that kind of person clouded Nango No'er’s expression.

"If you need to restore your strength, I can have the finest ingredients sent to you—just please let my pet go." 

Who was this strangely dressed woman? Helian Yichen’s deep, almost dangerous gaze followed her from behind. Most women would wrap themselves up tightly, except for those from brothels. Given her presence in Nango Manor's territory, she was definitely not a courtesan.

"No, thank you. I’ll return the Darkhawk to you; just stop following me." Feeling his intense stare on her back, Nango No'er understood he was no ordinary man. Anyone who could be treated as an esteemed guest by the Nango family was surely wealthy or powerful. She didn’t want any entanglements with him, so she decided to return the Darkhawk without looking back, even as she released it.

The freed Darkhawk didn’t wait for Nango No'er to tear off the cloth binding its feet. It soared into the sky, and the cloth flew back in the morning breeze. Helian Yichen instinctively reached out and caught it. Just then, a familiar scent wafted through the air—one that had been haunting his dreams for days.

Could it be her? Helian Yichen’s sharp eyes narrowed slightly as he turned his head, giving a subtle signal for the Darkhawk to leave his shoulder.
