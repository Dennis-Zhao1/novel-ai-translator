He Wants to Take a Concubine! 1

"He wants to take a concubine!" 

“Don’t overthink it; I was just asking casually,” Nangong Nuo’er shot him a sideways glance, but couldn’t help musing to herself. The celestial music had given her only five years, and she had already spent several months here. She was completely in the dark about the situation in the palace. If she didn’t start to investigate soon, she truly worried that time would run out. She had no desire to turn to dust; she wanted to return to her original world.

“We should be able to go back soon.” With Tuoba Tianye around, it was likely they would soon uncover the hidden hands behind the scenes. A cryptic glint flashed in Helian Yichen's deep purple eyes.

This morning, Nangong Nuo’er and Helian Yichen had already joined the old matriarch for breakfast in the hall. The old lady's health had improved over the past few days; she seemed in good spirits. She loved reminiscing about their childhoods, and seeing the old matriarch so joyful, Nuo’er couldn't just ignore her, even if she didn't particularly want to hear it. Helian Yichen, on the other hand, appeared to be thoroughly enjoying the stories, showing no signs of annoyance.

“Ah, Your Highness, Nuo’er, why are you two having breakfast out here today? It’s quite rare! Don’t you usually prefer to eat in your own rooms?” As the old lady continued her cheerful tales, a light jingle of jewelry announced the arrival of Second Madam Haoyue Lianxi, who entered with a silk handkerchief swaying in her hand. Upon seeing Nangong Nuo’er seated at the table, she raised her voice in surprise.

“I thought I was unwell recently, so I stayed in my room and didn’t come out for meals. Now that I’m feeling better and have the rare chance to accompany Grandmother, I decided to join,” Nuo’er replied, her eyes flashing with a fleeting glint of bloodthirst as she faced Lianxi. A cold smirk curled at the corner of her lips, and her hand, hidden beneath the table, instantly clenched into a fist.

Noticing the tension in Nangong Nuo’er’s body, Helian Yichen, seated beside her, immediately reached out to grasp her clenched fist under the table. He offered her a reassuring smile, urging her to relax. Under his soothing presence, Nuo’er’s taut muscles gradually loosened.
