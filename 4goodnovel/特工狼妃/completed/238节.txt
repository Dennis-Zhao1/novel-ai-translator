"Your hands are truly perfect!"

"Your hands are truly perfect!"

As he boldly took a seat right in front of him, Nangong Yulou's expression soured slightly. He couldn't have invited him to sit down, could he? Closing his eyes for a moment, when he opened them again, his gaze remained clear and untainted. A faint smile gradually appeared on his lips as he said, "They’re just exaggerating. I simply enjoy carving wood to pass the time."

"You’re too modest. Everything in this place is crafted by your own hands. People like us—mere fighters—know nothing beyond combat and business," Tuo Ba Tianye said, his deep, dark eyes half-squinting as if he could see right through someone’s soul but lingered on his hands—the nearly perfect, beautiful hands.

"To manage such a large gang, shining like golden dragons, Tuo Ba, you’re already impressive. How could we humble carpenters compare to you?!" His gaze was a bit too intense, sharp enough to feel like it could pierce through one’s spirit, making Nangong Yulou feel a slight discomfort rising within him. He was beginning to feel annoyed.

"You’ve known each other for a while; there’s no need for such formalities." His voice was rich and smooth, reminiscent of fine wine aged in a cellar. His face was handsome yet bore the ruggedness of a man, especially when a subtle smile graced his lips, making it hard for anyone to look away.

"Uh?!" Staring at his charming face, Nangong Yulou found himself slightly dazed. Just for a moment, but it was enough to irritate him. Damn it, he was actually entranced by a man! Shaking his head to clear his thoughts, he struggled to understand what he meant.

"I mean, you don’t have to be so formal. Just call me Tianye," Tuo Ba Tianye leaned forward, and a strong masculine presence surged towards Nangong Yulou. Startled by the sudden closeness of his face, Nangong Yulou felt like a rabbit caught off guard by a hunter, his body instinctively jolting backward.

"Yulou, watch out! Don’t fall; I’d feel terrible about that!" Tuo Ba Tianye’s long arm shot out just as Yulou was about to tumble over, his sturdy hand firmly grasping his shoulder and steadying him.
