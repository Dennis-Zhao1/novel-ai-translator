He must be testing her!

"Xiaoxiao, let him wait for me in the lobby. Tell him I'll be out shortly." Nangong Nuo'er quickly checked her clothes, noticing they carried the lingering scent of gunpowder. She swiftly changed into a clean outfit, washed her face, and after ensuring everything was in order, she finally stepped out to meet Nangong Yulou.

"Uncle, why did you come to see me so early? Is there something on your mind?" As she approached the coffee table, Nuo'er noticed a package wrapped in oil paper, from which a faint, sweet osmanthus fragrance wafted.

"Nuo'er, you don't look well. Did you not sleep last night?" Nangong Yulou wore a gentle and harmless smile, his gaze never leaving her face as she stepped out.

"I'm fine. I had some things to do last night, which kept me up late." Nuo'er couldn’t shake off the feeling of curiosity about why he was really here.

"You haven’t had breakfast yet, have you? This is your favorite osmanthus cake. I specifically went out to buy it for you. Give it a try," he said, smiling as he opened the oil paper, revealing several warm pieces of osmanthus cake.

"Third Miss," at that moment, Xiaoxiao, looking puzzled, called out to Nuo'er.

"Xiaoxiao, what is it?" Nuo'er glanced at her.

"Nothing, nothing at all." Xiaoxiao exchanged a wary look with Nangong Yulou, hesitating before shaking her head, choosing to remain silent.

"Nuo'er, come on, try it! This is your favorite. You wouldn’t want me to make the trip in vain, would you?" Nangong Yulou continued to smile, beckoning her as he noticed her hesitation.

His overly friendly demeanor felt suspicious—was he testing her? Nuo'er lowered her eyes slightly and approached him, carefully observing his expression. Although he seemed calm, the warm glint in his eyes carried an unsettling chill.

"Is that so? This osmanthus cake is really my favorite?" Nuo'er asked coolly as she reached for a piece, yet her brow furrowed involuntarily.

"Yes, it’s your favorite. Eat it while it's hot," Nangong Yulou encouraged her with a smile.

"Maybe I used to love it, but... for some reason, the moment I smell it now, I feel a bit uneasy. Uncle, I’m really sorry, but I might have to disappoint you this time. I just can’t stand this smell anymore." Nuo'er placed the cake back down, apologizing sheepishly.

"You don’t like osmanthus cake anymore?" Nangong Yulou looked at her in surprise.

"Well, I’m not sure why, but the smell makes me uncomfortable. I didn’t mean to waste your time, Uncle, but I really can't handle it now," she explained, feeling a mix of guilt and firmness.

"That's alright. Since you don’t want osmanthus cake anymore, I won’t insist. You don’t seem to be in great spirits today; you should rest well. I won’t disturb you any longer," he replied, standing up to take his leave.

As soon as Nangong Yulou left, Nuo'er swiftly pulled a silver needle from her hair and stabbed it into the cake.
