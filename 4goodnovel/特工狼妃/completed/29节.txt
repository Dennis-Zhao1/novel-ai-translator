**The Man Who Intruded Her Chamber! 7**

It was the dead of night, a time shrouded in silence and solitude, yet he was sweating. Could it be that Nangong Xudan had done something unspeakable to the real Nangong Nuo'er? She couldn’t help but furrow her brow in speculation.

“It’s nothing, nothing at all. I’m just worried about my little sister’s health,” he stammered, his eyes reflecting a hint of panic under her scrutinizing gaze.

“Is that so?” A faint, cold smile curled at the corners of Nangong Nuo'er’s lips. In truth, she had little interest in meddling in his affairs. She couldn’t be bothered by what he had done to the actual Nangong Nuo'er in the past. As long as he didn’t provoke her moving forward, she wouldn’t hold it against him.

“Of course! Now that I see you’re fine, I can rest easy. It’s late, so I won’t disturb you any longer,” he hurriedly replied, his composure faltering under her piercing gaze. It seemed even breathing had become a challenge for him. Feeling overwhelmed, Nangong Xudan quickly took his leave.

“How many normal people are there in this Nangong Manor?” Watching him scurry away in embarrassment, Nangong Nuo'er couldn’t help but let out a cold laugh.

After staying at Nangong Manor for a few days, Nangong Nuo'er discovered that the original Nangong Nuo'er was very much beloved here. From what she gathered, everyone spoke of her as a cultured and gracious person, known for her kindness and willingness to help others—almost like a modern-day Lei Feng. Even a mere cough from a servant would elicit her concern and inquiries.

It was no wonder the household staff cherished her so much; they had all benefited from her goodwill. It made sense why she was held in such high regard at Nangong Manor. Yet, the truth was that she herself was quite aloof and preferred solitude. She had no intention of extending a helping hand to anyone. As the third young lady of Nangong Manor, she had completely upended the former image of the previous third young lady.

Of course, not everyone in Nangong Manor was fond of her. Take her second mother’s family, for instance. When she first arrived, the second young lady had been somewhat polite, but within a couple of days, her true colors emerged. It was no wonder that the old matriarch, who usually doted on the third young lady, also seemed to dislike her. Her second mother was particularly sharp-tongued. Thankfully, Nangong Nuo'er was not a petty person; otherwise, living under the same roof would surely lead to more arguments than meals.

The most perplexing of all was the elder young master of Nangong Manor. On the very night he returned, he had boldly intruded into her bedroom without a hint of hesitation.
