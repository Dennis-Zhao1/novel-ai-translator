**Chapter 3: The Arrival of the Monthly Visitor**

The arrival of her monthly cycle meant one thing—she wasn't pregnant!

This time, Tuo Ba Tianye's visit was merely a brief one, accompanied only by his aide, Cheng De. He hadn’t summoned his mischievous cousin, which was a relief. As soon as he saw Nangong Nuo'er enter the hall, he couldn’t help but feel a surge of admiration. She was a strikingly proud woman, and their brief encounter yesterday had left a lasting impression on him.

Seated at the head of the hall, Nangong Xudan’s gaze flickered momentarily as he spotted Nangong Nuo'er. He tried to divert his attention from her, but almost immediately, his eyes were drawn back to her. Her indifference stung, a sharp reminder of how she had never truly acknowledged him since her return.

“Master Tuo Ba, I heard from Xiao Qi that you wished to speak with me. May I know the reason?” Nangong Nuo'er surveyed the room before elegantly taking her seat across from Tuo Ba Tianye. A servant named Xiao Xiao quickly stepped forward to pour her a cup of tea.

“Third Miss, I sincerely apologize for yesterday's incident. It was entirely my fault for spoiling my cousin, which led to her rudeness. This whip was the one you admired, and I specifically had someone purchase it as a gift to you, a token of our meeting,” Tuo Ba Tianye explained, gesturing to Cheng De, who stood at his side.

“Understood, Master,” Cheng De replied, stepping forward with the whip in hand and presenting it to Nangong Nuo'er.

“This whip was chosen by your cousin, wasn't it? Why would you give it to me?” Nangong Nuo'er recognized the whip as the very one she and Mu Rong Lanqin had both admired during their market visit yesterday. She couldn't hide her surprise.

“Honestly, my cousin only fancied it on a whim; she doesn't genuinely desire it. Consider this a meeting gift from me to you, and I hope you will accept it,” Tuo Ba Tianye said earnestly, his gaze fixed on her.

“Did you come here just to give me this whip?” She raised an eyebrow, a teasing smile tugging at the corners of her lips as she accepted the whip from Cheng De. Although she had no weapons at her side and truly needed this whip, she couldn’t quite shake the feeling of having her pride stroked. Since it was a sincere gift, she found it hard to outright refuse.

“I’ve always had business dealings with your Nangong Mountain Villa, and I rarely come to the south. This visit is, of course, to pay my respects to your esteemed villa. Wouldn't you agree, Young Master Nangong?” 

The atmosphere in the hall shifted, charged with unspoken tension and curiosity, as the two exchanged glances laden with meaning.
