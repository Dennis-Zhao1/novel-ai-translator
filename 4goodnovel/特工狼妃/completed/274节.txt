**Hold On, Don't Beg for Mercy! 4**

Upon hearing his words, she didn’t respond immediately. Her eyes, filled with confusion, curved slightly as she reached out once more, pulling his head closer. Their lips met in a fervent kiss, plunging them once again into the whirlpool of desire.

Though Ziyan and Nanguang Xudan were technically married, their relationship was more of a formality. At night, he would sleep in the bed while she took to the floor. This marriage had been deemed unfavorable from the start, and Haoyue Lianxi paid them no mind at all. She was a thousand times unwilling to acknowledge Ziyan as her daughter-in-law; seeing her would only remind Haoyue of her former identity before she became the second wife, a thought that filled her with disdain.

Nanguang Nuo'er observed this dynamic with a cold smirk of her own. She thought to herself, let her flaunt her arrogance for a little while longer.

"Third Miss, what are you writing?" Xiaoxiao asked, her scar now had healed and faded to a light mark. With a flick of her bangs, she could easily cover it up, making it difficult for outsiders to notice.

"I'm writing a letter," Nanguang Nuo'er replied, carefully picking up the completed letter and gently blowing on it to dry the ink before sliding the paper into an envelope.

"A letter? Who could it possibly be for?" Xiaoxiao said, her curiosity piqued.

"A person you wouldn’t expect. Xiao Qi, come in!" Nanguang Nuo'er smiled mysteriously as she called for the attendant who had been waiting outside.

"A person I wouldn’t expect? Do I know him?" Xiaoxiao pressed, intrigued.

"You don’t know him, but he can help you get some satisfaction," Nanguang Nuo'er replied, as Xiao Qi entered and handed her the letter. She leaned in, her tone serious, "Xiao Qi, personally deliver this letter to General Xing at the General's mansion in the neighboring county. Make sure it reaches him directly, understood?"

"Yes, Third Miss," Xiao Qi nodded, though he found it a bit odd, he didn’t question further. He tucked the letter into his robe and set off to fulfill his task.

"Third Miss, when did you get to know General Xing?" Upon discovering who the letter was addressed to, Xiaoxiao was both touched and astonished. She had never realized that the Third Miss had any connection to General Xing.

"I never said I knew him," Nanguang Nuo'er stretched lazily, her tone indifferent.

"Third Miss, it’s strange to write to someone you don't know, isn’t it?" Xiaoxiao’s mind was spinning from the confusion.

"You don’t need to understand now, but you will soon enough," Nanguang Nuo'er thought, a whisper of resolve in her heart. She would not let anyone bully Xiaoxiao without recourse. A chilly breeze blew through the window, lifting her bangs and revealing a subtle scar on her face. Despite having used the best ointments, the mark remained; the wound had been too deep to vanish completely.

"Alright then, I'll wait. It seems your health has improved, Third Miss. Does that mean you don’t need to take the medicine anymore? Have you finally broken free from that addiction?" Xiaoxiao hoped earnestly that Nanguang Nuo'er could overcome her dependency on the dark feather ointment.

"Don't worry. Although I'm not completely free yet, the cravings have diminished significantly. I believe it won't be long before I can cut ties with it entirely," Nanguang Nuo'er replied, a faint smile tugging at the corners of her lips.
