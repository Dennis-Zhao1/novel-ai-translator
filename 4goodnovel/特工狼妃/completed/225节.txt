### What Are They Up To? 6

“Oh, he’s wearing a mask! Could it be that he’s so ugly he can’t show his face?!” Nangong Nuoer smirked slightly, intrigued by the mystery surrounding him.

“Woman, curb your curiosity. I don’t want to see you get hurt again.” Helian Yichen felt a sudden wave of foreboding rise within him as he noted the spark in her eyes. He issued a warning, his tone laced with concern.

“No one can extinguish my curiosity. If you don’t want me to get hurt, you could just capture him yourself. Aren’t you a prince? Just team up with the local officials, and if you take down his lair, that should solve everything,” Nangong Nuoer replied nonchalantly.

“Do you think we can just arrest someone without evidence?” Helian Yichen’s face darkened. If they had enough evidence, they would have acted long ago instead of dragging it out this far. It was never easy to be underestimated, especially for a man like him who wasn’t easily belittled.

“After all this time investigating, and you don’t even have any evidence? Your efficiency is truly laughable,” Nangong Nuoer mocked without hesitation.

Helian Yichen fell silent. It was true that they had been looking into this matter for several months without finding anything substantial to warrant an arrest. Their ineptitude was undeniable, but it wasn’t entirely their fault; the Fengshui Gang was exceptionally crafty.

“I told you so. Honestly, why don’t you let me help?” Seeing him speechless, Nangong Nuoer couldn’t help but find the situation amusing.

“Our operations are going just fine.” Helian Yichen replied coolly, thinking of all the ways she could complicate matters rather than help.

“Helian Yichen, I’ll show you that women are not inferior to men.” With a confident smirk lingering on her lips, she glanced towards the docks and then turned on her heel, striding away without a backward glance.

Watching her self-assured figure fade into the distance, Helian Yichen felt a strange sensation wash over him. Nuoer was far from the simple girl he had imagined; no, she had always been anything but simple. What kind of spell did this elusive woman cast over him, making him utterly captivated against all reason?
