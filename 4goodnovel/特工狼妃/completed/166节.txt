**"If you want to follow me, then jump off the cliff!"**

"Three Miss, you should take her in; she’s really pitiful." Before Nangong Nuo'er could respond, Xiaoxiao jumped in eagerly.

"Yeah, Three Miss! Ziyan's background is truly tragic. Why don’t you take her in?" Xiao Qi added, looking at her with pleading eyes.

"Three Miss, as long as you let me follow you, I’m willing to do anything you ask. Just don’t send me back!" Ziyan raised her tear-streaked face, her eyes shimmering with desperation.

"Is that so? You really would do anything for me?!" Nangong Nuo'er’s gaze flickered as she studied Ziyan's somewhat attractive face.

"Yes! Whatever you command, I will make it happen," Ziyan nodded vigorously, her eyes glistening with sincerity.

"Very well, once you say it, there’s no going back. Come with me," Nangong Nuo'er declared as she walked towards the edge of the cliff.

What is she planning to do?! Xiaoxiao and Xiao Qi exchanged uncertain glances, puzzled about Nangong Nuo'er’s intentions, but they chose to follow nonetheless.

"Ziyan, you just said you'd do anything I asked. I’ll ask you again: do you truly want to follow me?!" Nangong Nuo'er asked, her gaze fixed on the bottomless cliff.

"Yes, I sincerely want to follow you," Ziyan replied, her heart racing as cold sweat began to bead on her forehead while staring at the abyss.

"Good. Then you should jump from here. If you survive the fall, I’ll accept you," Nangong Nuo'er said, her finger pointing at the gaping chasm, her expression as calm as if discussing the weather.

"How can that be? Jumping from here would surely mean death!" Xiaoxiao and Xiao Qi gasped, unable to suppress their shock.

"Jump or don’t jump, it’s up to you. This isn’t me forcing you; it’s your choice." Seeing Ziyan’s complexion turn pale at her words, Nangong Nuo'er smirked, her sharp gaze fixed on her without acknowledging Xiaoxiao and Xiao Qi’s astonishment.

"Three Miss, do you really want me to jump?" Just when Xiaoxiao and Xiao Qi thought Ziyan would back out, she suddenly took a step toward the cliff's edge, stopping just inches from the precipice. With one more step, she would plunge into the abyss.

As the wind howled around them, the tension in the air thickened. Ziyan stood there, teetering on the brink, her heart pounding in her chest. The depths below seemed to call to her, a mix of fear and exhilaration coursing through her veins. Would she really take that leap? Would she trust this seemingly cold-hearted girl, Nangong Nuo'er, enough to risk her life for a chance at belonging? 

Xiaoxiao and Xiao Qi held their breath, eyes wide with disbelief, as they witnessed Ziyan's moment of truth. Would she dare to jump? Would she embrace the unknown? The cliff loomed ominously, and the world around them faded, leaving only the heartbeat of the moment echoing in their minds.
