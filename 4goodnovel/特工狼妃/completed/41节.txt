He still wanted to take advantage of her!

"Let’s just wait and see," he accepted her challenge with a smirk.

At that moment, two maidservants approached, and upon seeing Prince Helyan Yichen holding their Third Miss in his arms, they froze in shock.

Prince? She had known he was someone special, but she hadn’t realized he was a prince. No wonder he was so arrogant. Nangong Nuo'er subtly lifted her gaze and shot him a sidelong glance, a mix of irritation and disbelief crossing her features.

“She’s injured! Quickly, go fetch the best doctor!” Helyan Yichen didn’t even spare the maidservants a glance as he carried Nangong Nuo'er past them, his voice cold and commanding, leaving no room for refusal.

“Yes, Your Highness!” The two maids exhaled with relief upon hearing that Nangong Nuo'er was hurt. After all, it was considered inappropriate for men and women to be too close. If anyone saw them like this, they would surely be the subject of gossip.

“Bring the doctor to my chamber,” Helyan Yichen added, and just when the maids thought they could relax, his next words left them gasping in astonishment. Oh my, even if the Third Miss was hurt, shouldn’t she return to her own room? How could she possibly go to the prince's chamber? This was going to be interesting!

“Hey, why are you taking me to your room? I want to go back to my own room! Put me down!” 

“Hey, why are you taking me to your room? I want to go back to my own room! Put me down!” Was he for real? Her room was right here in the Nangong Manor! He was brazenly carrying her into his room, as if he wanted to announce to the world that they had some sort of relationship. There were already many people who didn’t like her; she didn’t want to give them more fodder for gossip. Nangong Nuo'er was so furious that she felt like hitting him.

“Wait a moment; I’ll ask your grandmother for your hand in marriage. Once your foot is healed, I’ll take you back to the palace. You don’t have to worry about your reputation being tarnished,” Helyan Yichen replied, his words leaving no room for argument, as if they were a royal decree that demanded compliance, making it clear that resistance was futile.

“What? When did I ever say I wanted to go back with you? I don’t want to!” This arrogant pig thought he was someone important, didn’t he? Just because he said she should go with him, she had to? Nangong Nuo'er’s eyes widened in disbelief, staring at him as she raised her voice in protest. Perhaps women in this ancient society placed great importance on their reputation, but as a modern woman, she certainly didn’t care for such outdated notions.
