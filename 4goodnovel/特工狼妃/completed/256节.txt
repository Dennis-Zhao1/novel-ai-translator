**Chapter 4: I’m Just Concerned for You!**

“Are you feeling pain for him?!” Nangong Nuo’er shot back, a playful smirk dancing on her lips as she regarded him. “Those two slaps were just a down payment.”

“No, I’m not feeling pain for him. I’m feeling pain for you. This kind of thing should be left to me,” Helian Yichen replied, gently taking her hand, the one she had used to strike him. He brought her palm to his lips and pressed a soft kiss against it. “Does it still hurt?!”

As she watched him care for her, a warm rush of emotion surged through Nangong Nuo’er, filling her heart with a pleasant warmth. She shook her head slightly, saying, “You know I’m not some delicate flower. If just slapping him twice made my hand hurt, then how could I…”

“Why did you stop there?” Helian Yichen pressed, noticing her sudden hesitation. He gave her palm a gentle squeeze, urging her to continue.

“Nothing, I just don’t want to talk about it,” Nangong Nuo’er replied softly, lowering her gaze. She didn’t want to linger too long on the past; her identity and history were things he couldn’t know.

“You’re avoiding it again. Every time it comes to you, you shy away. Nuo’er, what secret are you hiding in your heart?!” On the surface, she was the third young lady of the Nangong family, but her actions and demeanor were completely opposite to what he had learned through his investigations. He was eager to understand why. From what he had observed over this time, she didn’t seem like someone who had lost their memory at all. Helian Yichen held her hand, his deep, inscrutable gaze locked onto her.

“I’m not avoiding anything. I just don’t think there’s much to say. You’ve been here for quite a while now; when are you going home?!” Nangong Nuo’er deftly shifted the subject, her voice low.

“Are you that eager to go home with me?! Hmm?!” This was the first time she had ever asked him this question. Her sudden inquiry caught Helian Yichen off guard, a small smile spreading across his lips as he regarded her with a teasing glint in his eyes.

The atmosphere hung thick with unspoken words, yet the connection between them deepened, like a thread woven into the fabric of their shared moments. The tension of the past lingered, but in this brief exchange, a flicker of something new sparked between them.
