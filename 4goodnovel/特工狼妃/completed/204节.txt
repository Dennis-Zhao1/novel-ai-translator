He was actually toying with Nora's bellyband!

They had only met once, yet Taoba Tianye wanted Nora to guide him around the estate. What exactly did Taoba Tianye want from Nora? Did he, like Helian Yichen, have ulterior motives for her?!

Nangong Xudan locked himself in his room, gently fiddling with a delicate bellyband in his hands. Occasionally, he brought it close to his nose to inhale its fragrance. Remembering Taoba Tianye's request from earlier, a surge of anger bubbled up within him, making him want to lash out at someone. With so many servants in the estate, why did he have to use Nora as his guide?

"Nora, my Nora, why won’t you even glance at me? Have you forgotten who has always been by your side, protecting you since childhood?! How can you treat me like this? How can you?!"

Seeing her with another man made his heart feel like a piece had been ripped away. Nangong Xudan's expression shifted between various emotions, and he raised a bottle of wine from the table, pouring it straight into his mouth, hoping the fiery sensation would numb his heart.

Just as he was seething over the bellyband, a knock on the door interrupted him, followed by a melodious voice, "Eldest Young Master, are you inside?!"

Hearing this voice, Nangong Xudan recognized it as Ziyan's. His brow furrowed; what did she want at this hour? His gaze fell on the bellyband in his hand. Did she come to ask about Nora's missing bellyband? No way—he couldn't let her have it! Panicking, he quickly stuffed the bellyband into his embrace before replying nonchalantly, “I’m here. Come in.”

Outside the door, Ziyan looked a bit nervous. After the embarrassing incident last night, she really didn’t want to return. However, the third young lady’s bellyband was missing, and despite searching high and low, she still hadn’t found it. It seemed the most likely place it could be was here. Losing a woman’s bellyband was a significant matter, and she couldn’t let the third young lady suffer injustice. Ziyan took a deep breath and steeled herself to push the door open.

"What brings you here?" Nangong Xudan shot her a sidelong glance, acting as if nothing had happened the night before. He continued drinking, his tone somewhat cold as he asked.
