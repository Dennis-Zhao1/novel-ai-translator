**Strange Dream! Part 4**

"What if I get the celestial zither? How am I supposed to give it to you?" She couldn’t shake the feeling that this place was otherworldly, like something that floated in and out of existence.

"When you find the celestial zither, you simply need to drip your blood onto its strings. Once it absorbs your essence, it will automatically return to me," replied Celestial Melody with an enigmatic calm.

"Celestial Melody, did you orchestrate for Helian Yichen to appear by my side? And what about the true Third Miss of the Nangong Manor—where did she go? Why does everyone in the manor confuse me for her? Is this all part of your plan?" She was desperate to unravel the mysteries surrounding her.

"It's not the right time to reveal everything. When the moment comes, you will understand," Celestial Melody said. With a swift motion of her hand towards her, a sudden surge of power enveloped Nangong Nuo'er, pushing her away. She couldn't help but let out a piercing scream, "Ah…"

"Third Miss, Third Miss! Are you alright?" A worried voice broke through the chaos as Nangong Nuo'er screamed.

"Ugh… what just happened?" When she opened her eyes, she found Xiaoxiao gazing at her with concern. She took a deep breath, the remnants of the bizarre dream flooding back into her mind. Her expression shifted sharply; had it really just been a strange dream? If it were just a dream, how could she remember every single word Celestial Melody had said so vividly? A chill ran down her spine at the thought.

"Third Miss, did you have a nightmare? I was just tidying up your things when I suddenly heard your scream; it startled me!" Xiaoxiao said, still shaken.

"If it were just a nightmare, I wouldn’t be so worried. What troubles me is the possibility that it wasn’t," Nangong Nuo'er replied, recalling the dream’s details, a sharp pain flaring in her forehead. She reached up to massage the throbbing area, feeling a sense of helplessness wash over her. Glancing around the room, she noticed her belongings scattered across the vanity. Her lips curled into a grimace as she muttered, "Damn it, Helian Yichen really had you move all my things here."

"Third Miss, the prince said you are now his. He believes that if you rest here, he will be a little more at ease," Xiaoxiao explained earnestly.
