**Addicted to... Her?**

"Young Master, Miss San wants some time alone; you should head back for now." Knowing how impatient Nangong Nuoer was feeling, Xiaoxiao quickly urged Nangong Xudan to leave. If he stayed any longer, Miss San would surely lose her temper again.

"Fine, I’ll go," he replied, trying to keep his tone light. But as he caught a glimpse of the annoyance in her eyes, his heart sank. Why was she so irritated with him? He had devoted himself to her, even after Helian Yichen had cast her aside. He genuinely wanted to protect her and provide her comfort. With a heavy heart, Nangong Xudan stood up and slowly walked away.

"Miss San, are you alright? You look unwell," Xiaoxiao asked, concern painting her features as soon as Nangong Xudan left.

"I’m fine, Xiaoxiao. Just wheel me out to the lakeside; I need some fresh air," Nangong Nuoer replied. Although her living space was spacious and well-ventilated, an inexplicable sense of suffocation weighed on her. She longed to be outside, away from the confines of the room.

"Alright then." Xiaoxiao had initially intended for her to rest, but seeing the distress on her face, she decided to honor her wishes.

The Emerald Willow Lake lay in the backyard, a serene spot rarely visited by others. It was the perfect place for someone feeling overwhelmed to find solace and clarity.

"Xiaoxiao, I want to be alone here for a while. You can go back to your tasks," Nangong Nuoer said calmly upon reaching the lakeside.

"Miss, let me stay with you. I really don’t have anything else to do," Xiaoxiao insisted. She couldn’t shake the worry off; how could she leave her here alone in this state?

"If you’re worried I might jump into the lake, you can save your breath. I’m not foolish enough to throw my life away over a man," Nangong Nuoer replied coolly. He wasn't worth it.

"Okay, I'll come back to fetch you later." With that assurance, Xiaoxiao finally felt at ease to leave.

Finally, the air around her felt peaceful. It was just a man after all—what could he possibly do to her? Taking a deep breath, Nangong Nuoer closed her eyes and listened intently. The sounds of koi splashing in the water and the gentle chirping of birds and insects surrounded her. Gradually, her turbulent emotions began to settle, and a sense of tranquility washed over her.
