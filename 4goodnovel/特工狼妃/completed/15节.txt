**Still lingering with his presence!**

But she couldn’t deceive him. Taking a deep breath, Meng Han said firmly, “Xiao Qi, I’ll say this one more time: I am not your Third Miss. I don’t even know you.”

“No, you are the Third Miss! You look exactly like her. How could you not be her? You must be lying to me! Are you trying to play some kind of game with me?” Xiao Qi shook his head vigorously, already convinced she was the person he was searching for.

“There are all sorts of coincidences in this world; it’s not strange for people to look alike,” Meng Han replied, seeing his naive determination. She didn’t want to scold him any further.

“No, you are the Third Miss! Don’t play with Xiao Qi!” He refused to accept her denial, shaking his head stubbornly.

“I really am not your Third Miss.” Could it really be that someone in this world looked exactly like her?

“You are! Unless you come back with me to the Nangong Villa and let everyone see. If they all say you’re not, then…” Xiao Qi’s voice trailed off, twisting his fingers in a gesture of frustration.

“Nangong Villa?” Watching his persistence, Meng Han realized she had to visit Nangong Villa. Given his impressive lightness skill, if she didn’t go with him, he might just keep following her.

Meng Han was an agent, someone with a mission to eliminate powerful figures, all of whom lived in luxurious mansions. But when she arrived at Nangong Villa, she couldn’t help but reveal her astonishment.

The villa was enormous, its architecture grand and imposing. Every detail showcased the finest materials, coupled with unique designs that made it a marvel of construction. It was clear that the Nangong family was not just wealthy; they were incredibly rich.

“Third Miss is back! Third Miss is back!” As soon as Xiao Qi stepped through the villa’s entrance, he couldn’t contain his excitement, practically shouting it to the heavens.

“Xiao Qi, I told you, I am not your so-called Third Miss! I came back with you to put your mind at ease, so can you please keep your voice down?” He seemed to have forgotten her purpose for returning, and Meng Han couldn’t help but roll her eyes at this idiot.

“Third Miss, let’s hurry inside! Everyone has been so worried about you during your disappearance. No, I should say, the old lady has been worried sick! Ugh, I shouldn’t say such ominous things. Anyway, everyone has been very concerned about you, Miss.”

As Meng Han stepped into the lavish villa, she felt a mixture of anticipation and trepidation. She had to keep her identity a secret while figuring out how to handle this unexpected twist. The grandeur around her was overwhelming, but she needed to stay focused on her mission.
