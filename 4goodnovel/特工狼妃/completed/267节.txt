**Chapter 1: The First Glance**

He said he fell in love with him at first sight!

Nangong Xudan cast a disdainful glance at her, then pushed her aside and lay back on the bed, ignoring her completely.

Watching his indifferent back, her enchanting eyes flickered with a strange glimmer.

Today was the day of the young master from the Nangong Manor taking a concubine, yet it felt surprisingly quiet, devoid of any festive atmosphere. As night fell, the manor seemed to sink into a deep slumber.

The night sky enveloped the entire estate, and from the back mountain, faint sounds of birds and beasts echoed. Just when the night had settled into a stillness, a shadow darted out from the back courtyard like a swift crane, followed closely by another agile figure chasing after him.

The figure in front quickly sensed that he was being followed. His bright eyes flashed, and he abruptly changed direction, heading toward the riverside, as if intending to lead his pursuer away.

It seemed his alertness was commendable; he realized he was being tracked so quickly. The person following, with a handsome yet resolute face, revealed a hint of appreciation before no longer attempting to conceal himself, continuing the chase.

“Tuoba, you really are hard to shake off,” the tall figure stood at the riverside, the night breeze lifting his garment as the soft moonlight cast a silvery glow over him, giving him an ethereal, almost divine quality.

“Well, that depends on who the target is. Yuluo, you’re usually so punctual with your schedule, rarely coming out at night. What brings you out of the manor tonight?” Tuoba Tianye said with an unbothered smile, walking closer to stand beside him, both gazing at the river’s surface, shimmering under the moonlight.

“I just felt a bit stifled and wanted some fresh air… Wait, why am I explaining this to you?” Nangong Yuluo abruptly realized he was justifying his actions to him, and irritation flared in his voice.

“Haha, that’s obviously because you’re starting to care about me,” Tuoba Tianye laughed wildly at his remark.

“Ridiculous! How could I possibly care about you? You must be overthinking things, Tuoba,” he retorted through clenched teeth.
