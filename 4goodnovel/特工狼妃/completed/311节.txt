**Final Chapter! 20**

"Come on, do you think I'm made of paper?" It’s not like she was going onto a battlefield; there was really no need to worry about it.

"But I'm worried your body can’t handle it." If anything were to happen to her, it would break his heart. Helyan Yichen held her hand, concern etched across his face.

"I know my body well enough; I won't be in any trouble." What else could she do? Should she really wait here to give birth before returning to the capital? Even with five years ahead of them, she didn’t want to waste a year just sitting around.

"Are you really sure you won’t have any issues? No, I still think we should find a doctor to check." Helyan Yichen remained apprehensive.

"I’ve already consulted a doctor about this, and as long as I take care of myself, everything will be fine." Seeing his anxious expression made Nángōu Nuò'ér chuckle softly.

"Really? The doctor doesn’t foresee any problems?"

"I promise, or you can ask Qin Tian. He heard it too, and he’s your man; he wouldn’t lie to you."

"Alright then. But you’ve been working hard these days; you need to rest properly here for a few days." There was no rush to return to the capital.

"Aren't you in a hurry to report to the Emperor about this matter?"

"Nothing is more important than your well-being right now. I’ve already instructed the local officials to handle everything else."

"Okay, if you’re not in a rush, then let’s just take a few days to rest here before we set off." Honestly, she wasn’t too eager to get married quickly anyway; staying behind for some good rest sounded nice. Nángōu Nuò'ér could barely hold back a yawn, feeling a bit sleepy.

"Are you tired? You should lie down and get some rest." She had been particularly exhausted lately, and Helyan Yichen felt his heart ache a little for her as he gently helped her lie down.

"Yeah, this time I want to sleep until I wake up naturally. You’d better not wake me up again, or I won’t hold back." Nángōu Nuò'ér warned him playfully.

"Sleep well; I promise no one will disturb you." He pulled up the blanket for her, assuring her.

"I’m not worried about anyone else." If it weren’t for him, she would still be peacefully asleep.

"I guarantee I won’t wake you. Is that alright?" Helyan Yichen couldn’t help but chuckle at her seriousness.

"Just make sure you don’t forget me when I wake up," she warned him with exaggerated gravity.

"I’ll leave once you doze off," he replied, smiling wryly.

Hearing this, Nángōu Nuò'ér finally closed her eyes slowly.

As he watched her face gradually transform into a serene expression, Helyan Yichen held her delicate hand, his purple-hued eyes fixated on her, as if he couldn’t bear to part with her even for a second.

Since returning to the inn with his cousin, Tuo Ba Tianye had remained silent, even when the doctor treated the wound on his arm. His gaze was distant, as if his thoughts drifted far away.

"Cousin, what’s going on?" After the doctor had left, Murong Lanqin could no longer hold back her curiosity.

"I’m fine. You stay here; I have some business to attend to," Tuo Ba Tianye said abruptly, standing up and heading for the door.

"Cousin, where are you going? I’ll come with you." How could she let him go out alone looking like that? Murong Lanqin hurriedly followed him.

"Do as you wish." Tuo Ba Tianye had intended to stop her, but seeing the worry in her eyes, he relented and allowed her to tag along.
