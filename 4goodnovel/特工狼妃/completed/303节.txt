**Final Chapter! Part 12**

As Nanguang Nuoer and Helyan Yichan returned to the hall, bringing with them the incriminating evidence against Nanguang Xudang and his associates, the moonlight seemed to shimmer in disbelief. Haoyue Liansi’s eyes were wide with shock, nearly popping out of her head—she never imagined that all this chaos stemmed from Nanguang Nuoer.

“General Xing, His Majesty is taking this case very seriously. This is the ledger detailing the smuggling of prohibited goods by Nanguang Xudang and Nanguang Yulou. It records their money laundering activities,” Helyan Yichan stated, his voice steady and authoritative. “We just pursued Nanguang Yulou, but he fell off the cliff. Nanguang Xudang is now in your hands, to be dealt with by the local authorities.” He handed the ledger over to General Xing Tianba.

“I never thought your Nanguang family would stoop to such inhumane acts. Your Highness, I will not disappoint you,” General Xing replied, flipping through the pages of the ledger. His expression grew serious as he read the sordid details, and he quickly commanded his men to seize Nanguang Xudang.

Nanguang Xudang seemed to sense his doom approaching. His face turned ashen, and his eyes were hollow, devoid of any spark of life.

“Your Highness, surely there’s been a mistake? My son Xudang is just a simple merchant; how could he be involved in such criminal activities? You must be mistaken—my son would never do such things. He’s innocent!” Haoyue Liansi’s previous shock at discovering her son’s entanglement with General Xing’s concubine was nothing compared to the devastation she felt now, realizing her son faced execution. She could barely stand, swaying on her feet, and if it weren’t for Nanguang Qi’er supporting her, she would have collapsed.

“Nanguang Second Lady, the evidence is irrefutable. Nanguang Manor will soon be sealed off; you should prepare for the worst,” General Xing replied coldly, handing the ledger back to Helyan Yichan, his eyes narrowed in cold resolve.

“You’ve arrested my son and now intend to seal our manor?” Haoyue Liansi looked as if decades had been stripped away from her, her voice barely a whisper.

“Mama,” Nanguang Qi’er said, holding her up, tears streaming down her face as she imagined their bleak future.

“I can’t believe my son would do such a thing. He must have been framed! It’s you—you vile woman—who has harmed my son! I’ll kill you!” Haoyue Liansi suddenly went wild, fists clenched, charging at Nanguang Nuoer, who stood calmly beside Helyan Yichan.

“Hmph, you’re overestimating yourself,” Nanguang Nuoer scoffed, effortlessly restraining Haoyue Liansi’s wrist with just one hand. With a mocking smile, she continued, “If you want to know if your son is innocent, why don’t you ask him? It will all be clear then. Taking your anger out on me won’t help you, especially since I’m not one to be bullied without a fight.”

“Even if I’ve treated you poorly, Nanguang Xudang has always been good to you. Why would you conspire with outsiders to frame him? He’s still your older brother!” Haoyue Liansi’s fury surged, her eyes turning red as she watched her brother being led away to his doom, while their family was being dismantled before her eyes.

“Nanguang Second Lady, I believe I forgot to mention something important,” Nanguang Nuoer said, a mocking smile spreading across her face. Leaning closer, her voice low but dripping with sarcasm, she continued, “I am not the real Nanguang Nuoer. The real Nanguang Nuoer has gone missing, and perhaps her disappearance is linked to your son. I never claimed to be the true Nanguang Nuoer; you’ve welcomed the wolf into your home.”
