**Is She Addicted to...?! Part 2**

“Third Miss, why put yourself through this?!” Xiaoxiao and Xiao Qi exchanged worried glances. Xiaoxiao quickly shoved a piece of wood into Nangong Nuo'er’s mouth, urging her to bite down on it, before snuffing out the candlelight. The two stepped outside, anxiously waiting.

As they stood outside the cabin, their hearts heavy with concern, two low, ominous screeches suddenly echoed from above. They were taken aback and instinctively looked up at the night sky. Beneath the flickering moonlight, a dark figure was circling overhead, seemingly guiding someone.

“Oh no! How did the black hawk end up here?!” Both of them recognized it as the prince's beloved black hawk. Its presence could only mean one thing: the prince likely knew they were here. But hadn’t he already drunk the sleep tea that Third Miss prepared for him?! How could he awaken so soon?

“I bet the black hawk is just hungry and out looking for food. It should be fine,” Xiao Qi said optimistically.

“Are you out of your mind? The black hawk has a specific feeding schedule. If it's here, something must be off. Third Miss ordered us to keep this under wraps. What do we do now?!” Xiaoxiao fretted, her eyes fixed on the hawk that continued to circle ominously above them.

“You’ve really stumped me; I have no idea what to do!” Xiao Qi scratched his head, panic washing over him. If the prince truly was on his way, they wouldn’t be able to stop him.

“Xiao Qi, you’re a man! How can you not know what to do?!” Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but stomp her foot in frustration.

“You know I’m not good at thinking on my feet! I can fight, but coming up with a plan? That’s just not my thing!” Xiao Qi exclaimed, looking genuinely innocent.

“Can you both tell this prince if Nuo'er is in this little cabin? What is she doing in there?!” Just as their argument reached a peak, two figures silently descended before them—it was Helian Yichen and Qin Tian.

“P-Prince… how did you get here?!” Xiaoxiao and Xiao Qi gasped, startled, instinctively stepping back and blocking the entrance with their bodies.

“I’ll ask you again: Is Nuo'er in the cabin, and what is she doing inside?!”
