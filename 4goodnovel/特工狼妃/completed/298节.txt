**Final Chapter! 8**

Looking at the serious expression on his face, Nanguo Nuo'er felt her heart skip a beat. Their paths were ultimately different, and maybe one day, he would want to kill her. In a daze, she instinctively averted her gaze and focused on the two people locked in a fierce struggle. Just then, she noticed that Tuoba Tianye was gradually beginning to falter.

“He’s almost at his limit. Aren’t you going to help him?” 

“Nuo'er, you're avoiding the issue again,” Helian Yichen sighed in a tone of resignation. 

“Whatever happens, we should wait until this matter is resolved,” she replied, trying to maintain her calm. They weren’t facing a life-or-death separation, so why rush?

Suddenly, just as Tuoba Tianye was about to lose the fight, he moved closer to Nanguo Yulou. It seemed he had abandoned his weapon, opting for close combat. As he grappled with him, Nanguo Yulou was ready to strike back when he heard a barely audible whisper: “Take me hostage.”

Nanguo Yulou froze for a moment. Seeing Tuoba's fist coming at him, he was about to retaliate when he noticed the other man winking repeatedly at him. It was clear that Tuoba had indeed spoken those words; it wasn’t just a figment of his imagination. Reacting quickly, Nanguo Yulou executed a swift maneuver, seizing Tuoba’s arm and pulling him towards himself. He had managed to gain control over Tuoba's vital points, with his soft sword poised against his throat.

“Nanguo Yulou, if you don’t let him go, are you trying to make your situation worse?” Helian Yichen, who had been about to rush in to help, shouted angrily upon seeing the hostage situation.

“Hmph, my crimes are already numerous. Adding one more for hostage-taking won’t make a difference. Don’t come any closer, or I swear I’ll kill him,” Nanguo Yulou sneered, a cold smile playing on his lips.

“What do you plan to do? Take a hostage and escape? General Xing’s men have surrounded Nanguo Mountain Manor. Even if you manage to get outside, you won’t be able to escape,” Nanguo Nuo'er replied, maintaining her composure. She seemed unfazed, as if even if he killed Tuoba right there, she wouldn’t bat an eye.

“That’s not something you need to worry about.” Nanguo Yulou began to move towards the exit, but when everyone thought he was heading for the upper ground, he unexpectedly approached a wall and kicked it. To everyone’s surprise, the wall slowly began to slide apart. Before they could react, he dragged Tuoba Tianye inside through the opening.

“So there’s a secret passage here,” Nanguo Nuo'er realized, exchanging glances with Helian Yichen. They quickly followed after him.

It was clear this was a tunnel. Thanks to Tuoba's cooperation, they moved swiftly. Although Nanguo Nuo’er was quick on her feet, she couldn’t match their agility. As the distance between them widened, she felt a surge of frustration.

“Let me give you a boost,” a deep voice came from beside her, and before she knew it, a strong arm wrapped around her waist, propelling them forward like lightning in pursuit of the two men.

He carried her effortlessly, and she didn’t have to exert any effort at all. The wind howled past her ears as Nanguo Nuo'er turned her head slightly to admire his handsome profile, momentarily lost in thought.
