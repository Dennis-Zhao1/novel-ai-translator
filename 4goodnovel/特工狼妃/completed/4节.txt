**The Temptation of the Night Coast: Part 4**

"Despicable, shameless scoundrel." The piercing laughter echoed in her ears like a thorn in her back, igniting a fire within Menghan’s heart. Her snow-white skin seemed to be painted with a layer of rouge, transforming into an alluring crimson. An unfamiliar heat surged from her lower abdomen, radiating through her limbs.
