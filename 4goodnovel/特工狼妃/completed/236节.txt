**Let Me Stay and Accompany You! 8**

“Xiaoxiao, your face is injured. You should go back and rest for a few days. I’ll have someone bring you the best ointment for scars shortly,” Nangong Nuo’er said, gently arranging Xiaoxiao's hair before stepping back and giving instructions. “Ziyan, you accompany her back. You don’t need to stay here to serve me anymore.”

“Third Miss, you just had an episode yourself; your body is weak too. You should rest more. I’ll be back to serve you soon,” Xiaoxiao replied with a nod, and with Ziyan by her side, they left the room.

As soon as they were gone, Nangong Nuo’er felt a wave of weakness wash over her. Helian Yichen, who had been closely observing her reactions, immediately stepped forward and wrapped her in his arms. Her body felt even colder than before, and he sighed softly, “You’re tired.”

“You must know who did this, right?!” Nangong Nuo’er could hardly push him away at this moment. She felt an intense chill that penetrated deep into her bones, while he felt like a warm furnace. Leaning against his chest, she allowed his warmth to envelop her.

“It was your stepmother,” Helian Yichen said as he guided her back into the room. He knew her temperament well; she would always find a way to uncover the answers she sought.

“My stepmother?! I thought she was just a loud, brash woman.” Nangong Nuo’er couldn’t believe that she would go so far as to hurt Xiaoxiao. She clutched his clothing tightly, her expression calm but her trembling fingers betrayed her fury. Memories of her dream flashed through her mind; she had sensed that someone close to her would be harmed. Yet, as their mistress, she felt utterly powerless to protect them. Guilt and self-blame surged within her like a tidal wave.

“Nuo’er, this isn’t your fault. That woman is just too cruel. You didn’t want this to happen, and it’s not your mistake, so don’t blame yourself,” Helian Yichen said, disliking how she took all the burdens upon herself. It only made things harder for her, and it pained him deeply.

“I’m not,” Nangong Nuo’er stubbornly denied.

“Do you still want to pretend in front of me? Your body is trembling,” Helian Yichen pressed her head against his chest and sighed softly.
