He still wants to take advantage of her!

The way he looks at her makes her feel a bit nauseous. She had encountered that kind of gaze many times before. In her previous life as a spy, she often disguised herself as a dancer to lure her targets, and his stare was reminiscent of those men who had eyed her with predatory intent. It made her stomach churn. Wasn’t he supposed to be siblings with Nangong Nuo'er? Although they shared the same father but had different mothers, they still had the same blood running through their veins. Did he harbor any inappropriate desires for Nangong Nuo'er? Did he want to claim her for himself?

As long as he didn’t provoke her, she had no interest in getting involved in his scandals. However, if he dared to lay a hand on her, that would be a different story altogether.

For Nangong Nuo'er, living in this ancient time had a single advantage: the air was fresh, and the surroundings were quiet, unlike the bustling, oppressive sounds of the big city that made one feel anxious. Yet, there were no phones, computers, or cars. But since she was here, she might as well make the best of it.

Being a martial artist, Nangong Nuo'er had a habit of exercising in the morning, enjoying a run before breakfast. However, she found the traditional clothing of this era quite inconvenient for running. So, she had someone craft a few simple T-shirts and shorts for her to wear during her morning jogs. 

When she stepped out in her short-sleeved T-shirt and shorts, she nearly terrified the servants of Nangong Manor. In ancient times, women were not supposed to expose their arms or thighs, and her outfit was nothing short of scandalous. 

But she didn’t care about others’ opinions. She continued to do as she pleased. Though people whispered behind her back about her lack of modesty, no one dared to confront her directly.

That day, as usual, Nangong Nuo'er donned her short attire and headed to the back mountain for her run. As she jogged along, she suddenly heard the sound of swords clashing. Her pace slowed as she noticed that the normally tranquil area, where she usually exercised alone, was now disrupted. Who could be practicing their swordplay here?

She had heard rumors that a distinguished guest had arrived at the manor yesterday. Could it be that guest honing their skills in this secluded spot? Intrigued, Nangong Nuo'er curiously moved closer to the source of the sounds. Just as she was about to reach the place where the swordplay was taking place, a shadow suddenly zipped past her, followed by a sharp, piercing scream.
