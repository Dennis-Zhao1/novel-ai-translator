**Final Chapter! 5**

“Turns out you guys at the Nangong Manor are all show and no substance. No wonder you’re resorting to such desperate measures. You’re in charge of the perimeter, while Nangong Xuduan is responsible for laundering the dirty money. You’ve done a clean job, but the heavens are vast and all-seeing; you won’t escape this fate,” he said, revealing the cracks in their once-mighty facade. Their generation was dwindling, and they hadn’t realized that even the manor itself was merely a hollow shell.

“Whether you’ll escape or not, it’s too early to say. Ziyan is the person you planted by Xuduan’s side, right? And the sudden visit from General Xing Tianba—it’s all part of your scheme, isn’t it?” Nangong Yulou replied coldly, clearly underestimating her.

“Indeed, Ziyan was placed next to Nangong Xuduan by me. I wouldn’t have known about these things without her discreet warnings. If there’s blame to assign, it should go to him for being so twisted, harboring greed for his own sister. With General Xing’s arrival, I doubt he’ll escape his fate,” she said, a smirk playing on her lips.

“Why are you doing this? Xuduan hasn’t wronged you, has he? In fact, he has treated you quite well. Why go to such lengths to destroy him?” The confusion in his voice was evident; he truly couldn’t fathom her motives.

“Originally, I didn’t want to harm him. Blame his mother; if she hadn’t ruined Xiaoxiao’s beauty, I would’ve just healed my wounds and left this place. But now…” Nangong Nuo’er’s expression darkened, a glint of bloodlust flashing across her face.

“Is everything you’ve done really because of this?” Nangong Yulou was taken aback, realizing that it was Xuduan’s mother who had ignited this fuse.

“Surprised? I have a flaw; I’m protective of those I care about. Anyone who crosses those I love will face my wrath,” she declared, her brows arched as she emphasized every word.

“You’re truly chilling. For the sake of a maid, you can go this far? I don’t even know what to say about you anymore,” he replied, shaken by her coldness.

“Aren’t you just as chilling? Doesn’t Nangong Xuduan make your skin crawl? None of you from the Nangong family are normal,” she shot back, feeling justified in her actions.

“Since you’re not the real Nuo’er, where is the real Nuo’er? Is she dead or alive?” Hope flickered in Nangong Yulou’s eyes as he looked at her. After all, blood runs thicker than water, and he still cared for her.

“I’m sorry, but I’ve never met the real Nangong Nuo’er. However, I suspect her disappearance is linked to Nangong Xuduan,” she replied, recalling the unusual look in his eyes when they first met, right after her memory loss.

“I appreciate you sharing this with me, but I still can’t let you go. If you have any wishes you’d like to fulfill, tell me. I’ll do my best to help you realize them,” Nangong Yulou said slowly, drawing a soft sword from his waist, his gaze piercing as he focused on her.

“My wish is to lock you all up in a cell,” Nangong Nuo’er declared, knowing that a fight was inevitable. She had prepared for this moment; his soft sword was formidable, but she wielded a whip—a gift from Tuoba Tianye.

“Your wish is rather greedy. Make your move,” he challenged. The day had finally arrived. Though she was not the true Nangong Nuo’er, he had grown reluctant to end her life after spending time together. But unfortunately, she knew too much; if he didn’t take her down, it would mean their end.
