still lingering scent of him!

For now, she would stay here. Freshly arrived with no money to her name, she couldn’t pass up such a good opportunity. She turned to the second young lady and nodded, saying, “Alright, I accept your offer, but I have one condition: I will stay, but you must not interfere with my freedom. I want absolute freedom.” She emphasized this point strongly.

“Of course, that’s not a problem at all. Welcome home, Third Sister!” The second young lady’s tense expression eased as soon as she heard Dream Han agree to stay, and a glimmer of joy danced in her eyes.

“That’s wonderful! Third Miss, you finally acknowledge that you are the Third Miss!” Dream Han’s decision to stay brought unbridled joy to Xiao Qi, who jumped up and down like an excited child.

“Just because I agreed to stay doesn’t mean I accept that I’m your Third Miss. What’s your name, anyway?” Seeing him act so childishly despite being a grown man, Dream Han couldn’t help but roll her eyes at him before turning back to the second young lady.

“Third Sister, let me walk you back to your room while I explain. In our family, there are three siblings. Our eldest brother is away on business and hasn’t returned yet. His name is Nangong Xudan. My name is Nangong Qian’er, and your name is Nangong Nuo’er. You are the child of our stepmother, while my brother and I are from our biological mother,” Nangong Qian’er explained, taking a pause to gauge Dream Han’s reaction, which remained neutral.

She continued, “Our father and stepmother tragically met with pirates during one of their travels and perished, leaving only our grandmother, my mother, the three of us siblings, and our eccentric uncle, Nangong Yulou. He rarely interacts with people and tends to stay hidden away, so you can just pretend he’s invisible.” Nangong Qian’er detailed their family dynamics with a sincerity that Dream Han found oddly unsettling.

“Mm!” Although Nangong Qian’er was warm and welcoming, Dream Han sensed a peculiar dissonance in her demeanor. As a skilled operative, her memory was exceptional; she only needed to hear something once to retain it.

“From now on, you’ll live here under the identity of Nangong Nuo’er. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me anytime,” Nangong Qian’er said, offering Dream Han a friendly smile.
