**Chapter 2: A Bold Move**

She took action after all!

“I don’t care who I am, what matters is that I want you to let her go.” Little Qi stepped forward confidently, pointing a finger at the panicked girl, his voice strong and unwavering.

“Hero, please help me! Save me… I don’t want to go back! Just let me go!” The girl’s face lit up with hope at the sight of someone standing up for her. But as she realized that her savior was just a skinny young boy, her heart sank, and her hope dimmed.

“If we let you go, how are we supposed to explain this to the master? You vile woman! You should just accept your fate and die! Don’t drag us down with you!” One of the men shouted at the girl, whose eyes were brimming with tears, a picture of despair.

“The master is a monster! He’s a beast, a devil! I don’t want to go back! Please, I’m begging you, let me go! If I get the chance, I will repay you!” The girl pleaded, her voice filled with desperation.

“You’ll repay us by obediently coming back with us. Stop wasting time with her; take her away!” Another man, growing impatient, barked out the order.

“Hey! I said let her go! Are you all deaf?!” Little Qi couldn’t believe they were ignoring him completely. Just because he wasn’t built like a tank didn’t mean he was easy to push around. He protested loudly, frustration boiling over.

“Hero, I appreciate your bravery, but you’re all alone against so many of them. You won’t stand a chance,” the girl said, her voice tinged with sorrow. She shot a glance at Little Qi, knowing that she was probably destined to fall back into their hands, and resigned herself to leaving with them.

“Kid, did you hear that? You should know your place and not bite off more than you can chew. Watch out; your head might get too big for your own good, and you won’t see the road ahead!” One of the thugs laughed heartily, and the others joined in, mocking Little Qi as if he were just a foolish child.

“Little Qi, why are you wasting your breath on them? If you want to save her, stop stalling and take action!” Seeing the group, Nan Gong Nuo’er felt a wave of discomfort and spoke sternly.

“I’m sorry! I’ll deal with them right now!” Little Qi realized that Nan Gong Nuo’er was growing impatient. He stepped forward, determination etched on his face. “Today, I’m not leaving without this girl. Get ready!” 

With those words, he prepared to confront the men, a fire igniting within him as he prepared to stand his ground, ready to fight for what he believed was right.
