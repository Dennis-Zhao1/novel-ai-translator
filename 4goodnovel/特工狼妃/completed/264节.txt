**He Wants to Take a Concubine! 8**

---

As the full moon hung brightly in the night sky, Lian Si’s face grew increasingly grim as she witnessed her daughter advocating for him.

“Mother, I’m not a child anymore. I can make my own decisions,” Xiudan Nangong pleaded, her eyes searching for the old matriarch’s understanding.

“Lian Si, given that Xiudan is of age and clearly has feelings for Ziyan, I think you should support him,” the old matriarch declared. She had longed for a great-grandchild and had been eager for this moment. Now that he finally expressed a desire to take a concubine, she wholeheartedly approved.

“But her status…” Lian Si's heart sank. Her son was the heir of the Nangong estate, yet he intended to take a concubine before marrying, and worse still, it was a lowly maid with no worth to him. The color drained from her face.

“Don’t forget, before you married my son, you were just a maid too. If Xiudan truly loves Ziyan, then he should take her as a concubine.” The old matriarch’s words sealed the fate of the situation.

“Hmph, I’m done here,” Lian Si huffed, knowing further protests would be futile. With a face like thunder, she turned and stormed away.

Watching Lian Si's furious retreat, a sly glint flickered in Nuo’er Nangong’s eyes. This was just the beginning; Lian Si, prepare to pay for your actions.

“Xiudan, later bring that girl Ziyan to my courtyard. I want to see her,” the old matriarch instructed.

“Yes, Grandmother,” Xiudan Nangong nodded eagerly.

“Big Brother, I never expected you to be so smitten with Ziyan so quickly, wanting to take her as a concubine. Is it her cleverness or your own restlessness that drives you?” Qian’er Nangong, seated beside him, provocatively glanced toward Nuo’er.

“Qian’er, don’t speak out of turn. I just think Ziyan is a good woman, and Grandmother has always wished for me to marry soon, which is why I want to marry her,” Xiudan’s face reddened at her insinuations, shifting from pale to flushed.

“Indeed, Ziyan is a fine woman. Big Brother, you must treat her well and not let her down,” Nuo’er said with a smile, though her eyes betrayed no mirth.
