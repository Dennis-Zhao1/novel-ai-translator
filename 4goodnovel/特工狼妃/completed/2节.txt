Section 2: The Seductive Temptation by the Night Coast
As she untied the delicate silk belt around her waist, the sheer fabric fell away, revealing an alluring figure clad only in an enchanting lace bodice and soft pink undergarments. Her snow-white skin, glowing faintly with a rosy hue, caught the dim light and drew his gaze irresistibly. Framed by her elegantly radiant face, she seemed like an intoxicating enchantress—impossible for any man to resist, especially someone like Mr. Jin, known for his indulgence in beauty.

A surge of heat rose within him, his breath quickening and his blood surging as if aflame. Desire coiled tightly in his chest, and he felt an almost uncontrollable urge to pull this bewitching woman into his arms and lose himself in her charms.

Dream Han moved with calculated grace, her every motion laced with a fatal allure as she straddled his lap. Fighting back her inner revulsion, her delicate hands traced slow, deliberate patterns over his chest, the warmth of her touch igniting sparks along his skin. A subtle, elegant fragrance drifted between them, further clouding his mind. Her soft voice carried a hypnotic edge, and the sensation of her fingertips left him frozen in anticipation.

"Ah... my little beauty, I can't resist anymore—I need you." His voice was hoarse as her hand grazed him with teasing intent. Overwhelmed, Mr. Jin’s restraint snapped. Wrapping his arms around her slender waist, he lifted her effortlessly, moving towards the expansive bed. He dropped her onto its azure sheets, his passion blazing.

Dream Han landed softly on the bed, her movements serpentine as she twisted her lithe form, casting him a playful, sultry glance. With a deliberate slowness, she extended her pink tongue to wet her lips, the gesture almost spellbinding. Mr. Jin’s desire peaked, and he climbed onto the bed with an urgency he couldn’t suppress. Yet just as he reached for her, she slipped from his grasp like a fleeting shadow.

"Mr. Jin, there’s no need to rush," she said, her sweet voice laced with flirtation. "Let me relax you first. I promise, you’ll feel so good you won’t even remember the world outside." With a charming laugh, she placed her soft palms on his back, urging him to lie down on the bed.

"Be quick, my beauty," he murmured, his voice thick with impatience. "I can hardly wait to lose myself in your sweetness."
