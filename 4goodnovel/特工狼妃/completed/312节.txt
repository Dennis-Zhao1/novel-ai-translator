**Final Chapter! 21**

After leaving the inn, Tuo Ba Tianye ventured into a remote area, gradually moving deeper into a place where few dared to tread. The landscape became increasingly desolate, teeming with overgrown weeds and buzzing mosquitoes.

“Cousin, what exactly are we doing here?” Murong Lanqin trailed behind him, her delicate skin already attracting a swarm of mosquitoes. Yet, despite the discomfort, she held her ground, determined to stay close to him.

“There are a lot of mosquitoes here, and who knows—there might even be snakes. You should head back; this place isn’t suitable for you.” Tuo Ba Tianye’s expression remained calm as he ventured further, his tone indifferent.

“No way! Wherever you go, I’ll follow. As long as you’re with me, I’m not afraid.” Murong Lanqin quickly stepped forward, wrapping her arm around his.

“If you truly want to follow me, then don’t ask questions.” His face remained stoic.

“Alright, since you don’t want me to ask, I won’t. I understand you're in a bad mood, so I won’t push it.” Murong Lanqin recognized his troubled spirit and decided against pressing him further.

Upon her reply, Tuo Ba Tianye fell silent. However, a hint of anxiety flickered in his half-closed eyes, as his sharp gaze roamed around, seeking a trace of someone while simultaneously fearing what he might find. If he couldn’t locate that person, he could tell himself they were not dead—not yet alive, perhaps.

What is Cousin truly searching for? Murong Lanqin soon realized they were at the base of the cliff beneath Murong Manor’s rear mountain. After pushing her hand away, Tuo Ba Tianye began to search the area. Though his face showed little, she sensed the urgency beneath his calm façade.

“Cousin, did you drop something down there? Tell me what it is, and I’ll help you look for it.” Seeing his unexpectedly forlorn back, a wave of inexplicable sadness washed over Murong Lanqin. It felt as if he had become distant during their brief separation.

“I’ve lost my heart here.” He had come filled with hope, only to be met with disappointment. Just as despair threatened to consume him, a flicker of hope reignited within him—perhaps the person he sought had left before his arrival, still alive.

“Your heart?” Murong Lanqin gazed at his silhouette, her heart heavy with a sudden and profound sorrow.

To take care of Nangong Nuoer, Helian Yichen had intended to stay a few more days. Unexpectedly, he received a secret imperial decree, urging him to return to the capital swiftly.

“Since the Emperor has summoned you back with urgency, you should go without worrying about me,” Nangong Nuoer replied with surprising calmness.

“You cold-hearted woman! Even if you weren’t pregnant, I’d still care for you. How could I abandon you now that you are?” Helian Yichen couldn’t bear the thought of leaving her. He lifted her chin and, unable to control his emotions, kissed her fiercely.

“I’m just being considerate! I worry that if you delay your return, the Emperor might punish you. You really don’t recognize a good heart when you see one, do you?” she quipped, a teasing smile playing on her lips as she complained, her eyes sparkling with mischief.
