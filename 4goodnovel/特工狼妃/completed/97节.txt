**Chapter 3: Moderation Keeps Addiction at Bay**

“It’s… it’s the Black Jade Ointment!” The doctor hesitated for a long moment before finally speaking. This substance was banned by the court; its dangers were undeniable, but its effectiveness was equally high.

“Black Jade Ointment?! You damned doctor, how could you allow Nuo’er to take such a cursed thing?!” Upon hearing the doctor’s words, Helian Yichen’s expression darkened immediately. He shot the doctor a fierce glare, his voice laced with anger.

“Please calm down, my lord. It’s only addictive in excessive amounts; if controlled properly, it won’t lead to addiction.” The doctor had seen his fair share of things in life and, despite feeling intimidated by Helian Yichen’s imposing presence, he stood his ground.

“But it’s still strictly forbidden by the court! Haven’t you seen the imperial edict? Those who defy it face the extermination of their entire clan!” Helian Yichen retorted sharply.

“Nuo’er, you absolutely cannot touch that stuff. Doctor, you should find another way.” Helian Yichen shot the doctor another glare, firm in his resolve.

“Because I care about you! You have no idea how dangerous Black Jade Ointment is. It can reduce a stalwart man to nothing more than a worthless pile of mud, even less than a dog. Nuo’er, I’ll find a way to cure your headaches. You must not touch that damned ointment.” Helian Yichen sat on the edge of the bed, holding her hand tightly, his expression serious and earnest.

“I think I understand what you’re talking about regarding the Black Jade Ointment. While it is indeed a drug, you can’t deny its medicinal value. I know you’re concerned for me, but…”
