She was just waiting to see his drama unfold!

"Yaoqing, are you really unable to understand human speech? I said it's impossible! I will send someone to take you back to the capital. If you don't propose to break off the engagement by the time I return, don't blame me for disregarding your pride." Helian Yichen, who despised women clinging to him, ruthlessly shook her hand off. Just as he was about to call Qin Tian to deal with the mess, a cold, mocking voice rang out nearby.

"Tsk, tsk, who would have thought that as soon as I stepped out for a stroll, I would witness such a fine performance of 'Chen Shimei abandoning his wife'? Truly disheartening." Nangong Nuoer strolled over with Xiaoxiao and Xiao Qi, her striking eyes glinting with sarcasm as she regarded them.

"Nuoer, we haven't even gotten married yet." This damn woman, how dare she compare him to Chen Shimei! Helian Yichen's dissatisfaction was palpable.

"Even if you haven't married, you're still a man with a betrothal." That damn man! He already had a beautiful fiancée, yet he still dared to provoke her. Nangong Nuoer walked past, her gaze landing on Yaoqing, who was crying like a wilted flower. Though her face was veiled, under the bright moonlight, it was clear she was a stunning beauty.

"This marriage wasn't even my choice, Nuoer. Are you angry?" Helian Yichen had not missed the flicker of anger in her eyes. If she was upset about this, it would prove she cared for him, and a wave of joy washed over him. Being with her made him uneasy, as if she was forced to be with him, never having said she liked him. If she was angry now, it meant she was jealous—what a delightful thought.

"Yes, I'm angry! How could you make such a tender young lady cry? Even if you have no feelings for her, there's no need to hurt her like this. Miss, dry your tears. It's not worth shedding them for a heartless jerk." Nangong Nuoer stood before Yaoqing, offering her a handkerchief.

Hearing Nangong Nuoer’s words directed at Yaoqing, Helian Yichen's expression darkened. He had thought she was jealous of him!

"Hmph! You're the shameless woman who has bewitched my brother Yichen, you vixen... ugh!" Yaoqing glared at Nangong Nuoer, jealousy and rage clouding her judgment. She was about to unleash a torrent of insults, but before she could finish, a loud slap echoed through the air. The strike knocked her veil aside, revealing her beautiful face, though now marred by a bright red handprint.

"Tsk, I may pity you for being abandoned by that scoundrel, but that doesn’t mean I will tolerate anyone insulting me." Nangong Nuoer retracted her hand, casually brushing a stray lock of hair from her face. Her voice was soft and delicate, as if she hadn’t just done anything at all.

"You... how dare you hit me? Do you even know who I am?" Yaoqing pressed her hand against her stinging cheek, disbelief shining in her wide eyes.

"Does it really matter who you are? You can insult me, but I can't hit you?" Nangong Nuoer raised an eyebrow, looking at her as if she had just heard something utterly ridiculous.
