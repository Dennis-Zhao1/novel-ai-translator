**You Can Bite Me! 1**

"Sure." Nankong Noer snapped back to reality, her gaze caught by his clear, black eyes that sparkled with laughter. Feeling a bit shy, she quickly turned her head away. With the help of Xiaoxiao, she settled into the specially designed wheelchair and began to push the wheels, gliding around the courtyard a few times.

"How does it feel? Is there anything uncomfortable?" Watching her maneuver the wheelchair with ease, Nankong Yulou stepped in front of her, reaching out to touch the wheels. His expression was intensely focused, as if he were caressing not just the wheels but his beloved.

"Well, it's great! Uncle, you're really amazing." Just from a single image, he crafted this exquisite wheelchair. Truly, he lived up to his reputation as a master craftsman. Nankong Noer seldom admired anyone, but at this moment, she couldn’t help but be impressed by the handsome man in front of her, who resembled an approachable neighbor boy.

"As long as you're satisfied," Nankong Yulou replied, his smile growing more bashful as he noticed the admiration in her eyes.

"Third Miss, having this wheelchair will make things much more convenient for you. You can go anywhere you want!" Little Qi exclaimed happily.

"Isn’t that right?! With the Third Miss’s brilliant ideas combined with the Second Master’s extraordinary craftsmanship, they’re simply a match made in heaven…" Xiaoxiao’s proud words were interrupted by Little Qi, "Xiaoxiao, you can’t use that idiom randomly! 'A match made in heaven' is for couples, you know?!"

Hearing their banter made Nankong Noer chuckle. She glanced at Nankong Yulou, finding him also looking back at her, smiling softly. His smile seemed just like an ordinary person's, yet to her, it felt slightly off—maybe she was just being overly sensitive.

"Oh, right! Second Master, Third Miss, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to offend you," Xiaoxiao quickly apologized after realizing she had misused the idiom.

"It’s okay!" Nankong Noer and Nankong Yulou both chimed in simultaneously, exchanging amused glances afterward.

"Since I can’t say 'a match made in heaven,' what should I use instead?!" Xiaoxiao, seeing the two of them laugh, felt a bit nervous about saying something wrong again. She was determined to find the right words, even if she knew she was at a disadvantage with her limited education. After all, she had only learned a bit while being by the Third Miss’s side, so it couldn’t really be her fault.
