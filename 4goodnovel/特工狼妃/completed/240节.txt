Your hands are truly perfect! 4

He had already made himself clear; he should know what to do by now. A cold glimmer flickered in Nangong Yulou's clear eyes. He couldn't understand why Tuoba Tianye had suddenly taken an interest in him. In front of others, he was just an ordinary carpenter. Was he doubting something?!

"So that's how it is. What a pity! I’m sorry to disturb you and distract you," Tuoba Tianye said, his mouth forming the words of apology, but there was no trace of remorse on his face.

"It’s fine, you..." Nangong Yulou was about to say that he could leave now, but before he could finish his thought, Tuoba Tianye interrupted, "Really? Then I’ll just keep bothering you."

"You..." When did he ever say he could keep bothering him?! Nangong Yulou was once again left speechless by his audacity.

"Don’t be so agitated, Yulou. You spend all day in the yard messing with these lifeless objects. Don’t you ever feel bored?!" After saying he wouldn’t interrupt, he had already shifted to another topic.

"My interest is being a carpenter. I enjoy working with wood, so why would I feel bored?" Nangong Yulou realized that he wouldn’t be leaving anytime soon, so he simply set down what he was working on and waited for him to get to the point.

"Oh, and what about at night? Don’t men usually like to go out to the flower streets in the evening? You’re not that young anymore; why haven’t you married yet?!"

Seeing him frustrated as he put down his tools, a playful smile spread across Tuoba Tianye's face. Finally, he was willing to set aside his work. This was amusing.

"Tuoba, whether other men enjoy that is none of my concern. As for whether I am married, that seems to be my business, doesn’t it have anything to do with you?" They had only met twice; were they close enough to care about each other's marital status?!

"Alright, if you don’t want to talk about it, I won’t pry. But I am curious; your hands often wield knives to carve things, yet how do they remain so perfect?!" Perfect enough that anyone could tell whose hands they were at a glance, even without needing to see his face.
