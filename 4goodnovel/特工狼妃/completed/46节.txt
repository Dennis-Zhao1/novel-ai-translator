**Shameless Man! 4**

---

However, due to his status as a prince, she couldn’t afford to offend him. With a composed expression, she feigned politeness to Helian Yichen. 

“No need for courtesy; it’s I who wishes for her to stay here.” By the time they entered, the expression on Helian Yichen’s face had already turned cold, exuding an unapproachable indifference.

“Your Highness, this seems rather inappropriate. If word gets out, it might tarnish my sister’s reputation,” Nangong Xuandan exclaimed in shock, his face darkening as he spoke.

“Yes, Your Highness, Nuo’er is still in her maidenhood. If she stays in your room, it will be difficult for her to find a suitable husband in the future,” Nangong Qian’er added, her tone a bit agitated as she opposed the idea.

“Oh dear, Your Highness, our Nuo’er is currently injured and needs someone to care for her. If you’re feeling bored, perhaps you could play with my sister Qian’er instead. As for Nuo’er, let her return to her own room to recuperate. Xuandan, why don’t you take your sister back to her room?” 

Hearing Helian Yichen’s tone, it seemed he had a keen interest in Nuo’er. This wouldn’t do; the prince was a prized catch for her own daughter, and she absolutely couldn’t let this shameless man ruin her daughter’s prospects. Haoyue Liansi subtly signaled to Nangong Xuandan.

“Yes, if Your Highness is feeling bored, you can find my second sister. As for my little sister, I’ll take her back to her room for now,” Nangong Xuandan said, moving forward to carry Nangong Nuo’er away. However, before he could reach the bedside, he was blocked by Helian Yichen’s imposing figure.

“It seems you have not understood my intentions. I have already decided to take Nuo’er as my concubine. Once her foot injury has healed, I will take her back to the royal residence, so you need not worry about her reputation,” Helian Yichen stated, his purple-tinted eyes glinting with ice-cold disdain as he gazed at them, making it hard for anyone to meet his gaze.

“What? Your Highness, you want to take my sister as your concubine?” The first to snap back was Nangong Xuandan, his eyes widening in disbelief. When did they become close? How could he have been so oblivious?

Upon hearing that he intended to take Nuo’er as a concubine, Nangong Qian’er’s face went pale, clearly struggling to accept this shocking reality.
