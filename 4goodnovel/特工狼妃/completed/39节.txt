**Chapter 10: He Still Wants to Take Advantage of Her!**

“You really are a heartless little vixen, but what you don’t realize is that the more you resist a man, the more it ignites his desire to conquer you. The more you act this way, the more intrigued I become, little vixen. I’ve made up my mind; you are the one the Moon Goddess sent to me, and I’m taking you back with me.”

Just a single kiss was enough to stir his desires—a feeling he had never experienced before. No matter the cost, he was determined to bring her back to his estate. Helian Yicheng’s tone was heavy as he announced this to her; he wasn’t asking for her permission; he was telling her this was going to happen, and she had no right to refuse.

“Hmph, self-righteous pig, go die!” Nangong Nuo’er narrowed her beautiful eyes. Suddenly, she thrust her jade-like foot upwards between Helian Yicheng’s legs in a swift, almost lightning-quick motion, trying to kick him.

By the time Helian Yicheng noticed her sudden attack and tried to retreat, it was already too late. He could only hastily raise his hand to block her foot. In that split second, his palm landed on Nangong Nuo’er’s thigh.

Worried about hurting her if he used too much force, he didn’t push too hard. However, he underestimated Nangong Nuo’er's strength—her foot didn’t drop at all, continuing its upward trajectory, forcing him to exert his internal energy to push her foot away.

As his strong hand pressed against her thigh, a sharp pain shot through Nangong Nuo’er. Her body swayed slightly, and if it weren’t for Helian Yicheng steadying her waist, she would have collapsed onto the ground.

“Little vixen, are you okay?” Seeing her face turn pale instantly made him realize that her leg was probably injured badly by his slap. Yet, he was surprised that she didn’t utter a single sound. She truly was a stubborn woman.

“I’m fine, you don’t need to worry about me, let me go.” Nangong Nuo’er had endured pain a hundred times worse than this before. Her face was as pale as a ghost, her brows knitted tightly, and beads of cold sweat were forming on her smooth forehead. Despite this, she remained silent, showcasing a level of endurance that even the toughest man would find hard to rival. Helian Yicheng admired her willpower, but he didn’t appreciate her pushing him away.

“Your leg is definitely fractured from my hit; you need to see a doctor immediately.” Ignoring her struggles, Helian Yicheng scooped her up in his arms and quickly made his way towards the Nangong residence.
