She did it after all!

Little Qi darted in front of them, swiftly extending his hand to strike one of the thugs holding the girl on the left. His palm forced the thug's hand back, and without missing a beat, he launched a kick at the thug on the right. Seizing the moment they stumbled back, he grabbed the girl's hand, pushing her behind him for safety, and then he engaged in battle with the group of thugs.

“Go, Little Qi! Go, Little Qi! Beat them until they're all a mess, rolling on the ground!” Xiao Xiao shouted, pulling the girl close to shield her while cheering for Little Qi at the top of her lungs.

Nangong Nuo'er observed the scene for a moment and quickly realized that the thugs lacked any real martial arts skills. It seemed that this time, a blind cat had indeed stumbled upon a dead mouse.

Though Little Qi's martial arts were only average, he was more than capable of handling them. Just as she began to relax, a sudden commotion caught her attention. A new group of men dressed in the same attire as the thugs approached, and her eyes narrowed instinctively. While Little Qi could handle the initial group, the arrival of reinforcements posed a serious threat.

“You've got some guts to come out here alone and take us on! Everyone, let's show him what we’re made of and turn him into a punching bag!” The newcomers shouted, ready to gang up on Little Qi.

Seeing the sheer number of opponents compared to Little Qi’s two fists—and knowing his martial arts weren’t exactly top-tier—Nangong Nuo'er sighed, realizing she could no longer stand by. She bent down, grabbed the hem of her skirt, and tore it, making two knots in the fabric.

“Miss Three, what on earth are you doing?!” Xiao Xiao gasped, astonished by the sight of her ripping her skirt in public.

“If I don’t tear this skirt, how am I supposed to help Little Qi fight?” Nangong Nuo'er replied nonchalantly, tying the skirt into a makeshift fighting garment as she stretched her limbs.

“What? Miss Three, you’re really going to help Little Qi?!” Xiao Xiao was in disbelief. Had she misheard? When had their Miss Three learned martial arts?

“If I don’t help him, he’ll be dead for sure,” Nangong Nuo'er stated calmly. While Little Qi might have managed against the first few thugs, he clearly wouldn’t stand a chance against this new wave. 

“But Miss Three, you don’t know any martial arts! And your leg injury is barely healed!” Xiao Xiao protested, her concern evident as she watched her friend prepare to jump into the fray. 

Nangong Nuo'er, however, remained resolute. “I can’t just stand by and watch. We have to help him!”
