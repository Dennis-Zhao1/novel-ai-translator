**Chapter 1: Devouring Her Tofu!**

In this world, she had nothing. What she needed most were loyal subordinates who would risk everything for her.

"As long as I can be by Miss San's side, I'm not afraid of anything," Ziyan said, her face filled with earnest devotion as she gazed at her.

"If one day you betray me, I will make your life a living hell. You better remember that," Nangong Noer warned, her expression darkening, a chilling hint of menace lurking beneath her low voice.

"I, Ziyan, have decided today to follow Miss San. If I were to betray her, may I be struck down by lightning and suffer a terrible fate," Ziyan declared boldly, swearing to the heavens without flinching.

"Good. Remember what you said today. I might be merciful and take you in now, but if you betray me, you'll find out just how cruel I can be." She was someone who repaid grievances tenfold, and Ziyan better figure that out quickly, or she’d have no one to blame but herself.

"Yes, Miss San." Under the piercing gaze of Noer, whose eyes were as sharp as an eagle's, Ziyan suddenly felt a chill run down her spine. Had she followed a good person or a devil?

When Nangong Noer returned to the Nangong Manor, she found Nangong Xuduan pacing at the entrance, seemingly waiting for someone. As soon as he spotted them, he sighed in relief and approached her. "Little sister, where have you been? I went to your courtyard looking for you and found out you left with the servants. Your thigh has only just healed; you should be resting more."

"Big brother, I just went out to shop for a bit. My leg is fine now, so there's no need to worry," Nangong Noer replied, her expression blank as she brushed past him, as if they shared no bond at all. In truth, they really didn’t have much of a relationship.

"Little sister, hey, who is this? I don't think I've seen you before!" Nangong Xuduan exclaimed, eyeing Ziyan with curiosity. The girl looked decent, with a kind of beauty that stood out among the household servants. He couldn’t help but ask, intrigued.

"Young Master, this is a maid that Miss San just brought back from outside. She will be serving alongside me for Miss San in the future. Ziyan, quickly greet the Young Master," Xiaoxiao urged, tugging at Ziyan's sleeve.

"Ziyan greets the Young Master," Ziyan quickly stepped forward and bowed respectfully.

"Ziyan, nice name. You can rise, no need for such formalities," Nangong Xuduan said, seeing her bow. He hurried to help her up, his hand inadvertently resting on the back of her hand. 

The tension in the air was palpable as Ziyan felt the warmth of his touch, a mix of nervousness and excitement swirling within her. Little did she know that her new life was just beginning, filled with unexpected challenges and alliances.
