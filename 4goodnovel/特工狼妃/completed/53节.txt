**Strange Dreams! 1**

Oh my god, am I dreaming? And not just any dream—this one features a woman who looks exactly like me.

"You are a part of my body, of course you look like me. Nola, I’ve waited for you for a thousand years, and you’ve finally come," the woman, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Nola Nangong, said with a gentle smile that brightened her otherwise serene face as she noticed Nola's shocked expression.

"Are you joking? You’ve waited a thousand years for me? What on earth is going on?" This must be a dream, but why is it such a bizarre one? Nola furrowed her brows, completely bewildered. Could it be she was seeing a ghost? No, rather a celestial being, for ghosts lack the ethereal aura this woman radiated.

"Nola, I’m not joking; this is real. I cannot meet with your true self, so I can only summon your soul," the ethereal woman explained, seeing the confusion still etched on Nola's face.

"How can this be?" It dawned on Nola that maybe this wasn't a dream but rather an out-of-body experience. This was too unbelievable! She was a secret agent from the twenty-first century and had never bought into superstitions or myths. How could she possibly accept this as reality? Shaking her head in disbelief, Nola struggled to come to terms with her situation.

"I know it’s hard for you to accept this truth all at once, but you must remember, you came to the Helian Kingdom for one purpose: to retrieve what belongs to me from their land. The ancestors of Helian made a promise—they vowed to return my divine artifact after using it to defeat their enemies, yet after they repelled the invaders, they claimed my artifact for themselves. Worse, they sealed me in this place, preventing me from escaping or returning to the celestial realm."

When she spoke of her plight, a flicker of resentment darkened the woman’s gentle eyes. Being trapped in this place, forever denied the light of day, would infuriate even the most serene of celestials.

"What artifact? What seal? Who are you?" Nola was utterly lost, her head swirling with questions as she struggled to grasp the meaning behind the woman’s words.

"My name is Xianle. I was once a musician serving the Queen Mother. During a celestial event, I descended to gather melodies from the mortal realm and met the ancestor of the Helian Kingdom, Helian Nige. At that time, their nation was under siege, and he sought my help. I gifted him my enchanted instrument, the Xian Zheng, infused with my spirit, to help him repel the invaders. We had an agreement—once the enemy was defeated, he would return the Xian Zheng to me."
