### She Wants to Follow Her Cousin Out! 3

"Lanqin, you really shouldn’t keep bringing your parents into this. Even the deceased, you use them without hesitation. Your face is getting thicker by the day," Tuo Ba Tianye said, feeling helpless. He could only cast an apologetic glance at the somber-looking Di Sanlang.

"As long as you agree quickly to let me tag along, I won’t mention them again. Thank you for letting me go, Cousin! Lanqin loves you the most!" Murong Lanqin stepped closer, linking her arm with his, her smile bright and infectious.

"You’re not a child anymore; shouldn’t you be finding someone to marry? Do you really plan to cling to me for the rest of your life?!" Tuo Ba Tianye's heart swelled with affection for his cousin, the girl he had watched grow up. Although they were only cousins, he had come to care for her as if she were his own sister.

"Cousin, you’re nearly thirty, and you’re still not married. I’m not in a rush! You promised my parents you’d take care of me for life, so I’m just going to hold you to that," Murong Lanqin replied, her tone cheerful, but a fleeting hint of bitterness flashed in her eyes. Everyone in the Golden Dragon Society knew of her feelings for him, but he seemed oblivious, always reminding her to find a suitor or risk being left alone in her old age.

"I'm different from you. Anyone connected to me could be in danger at any moment. I have no plans to marry in this lifetime, and right now, you’re in your prime. I need to help you find a good husband to repay your parents for raising you," Tuo Ba Tianye said with a hint of melancholy.

"Alright, I won't pressure you to get married. Just don’t worry about my marriage; I have my own plans." She had heard this sentiment many times before. She thought she would eventually grow numb to it, but each time, it still pricked at her heart. Changing the subject, she asked, "Cousin, when will we set off south?"

"Let’s leave tomorrow. We need to resolve that matter quickly, or it’ll get complicated," Tuo Ba Tianye replied, his tone suggesting there was more beneath the surface.

"Okay, then I’ll head back to pack my things. Cousin, Sanlang, you two keep busy; I’ll go prepare." With that, Murong Lanqin skipped away, full of energy.

"Sanlang, I’m sorry. I initially wanted her to stay and develop feelings with you, but you know how I can never refuse her requests," Tuo Ba Tianye said, giving Di Sanlang’s shoulder a gentle pat, feeling a bit guilty once Murong Lanqin had left.
