**Chapter 2: Bite Me!**

"Of course, we can't use 'a perfect match' to describe the Second Master and the Third Miss. I think they work so well together that they should be called partners," Xiao Qi scratched his head, pondering for a moment. Then, he slapped his thigh in excitement and declared, "Yes, that's it! Let's call them the Best Partners."

"Wow, Xiao Qi, you're amazing! The Best Partners! The Second Master and the Third Miss are definitely the Best Partners!" Xiao Xiao clapped her hands in delight.

"You little rascal! Well, since the wheelchair is ready, I want to take it for a spin. Uncle, we won't disturb you any longer. Thank you for making me such a wonderful wheelchair," Nangong Nuo'er smiled brightly at Nangong Yulou.

"No need to be polite. Come visit me more often. I haven't had a good chat with you in ages," Nangong Yulou replied, a fleeting look of disappointment crossing his eyes as he noticed she was leaving, but he still maintained his cheerful demeanor.

Not long after Nangong Nuo'er and the others left, a serious-looking Qin Tian entered the room.

"Master, you took a huge risk last night. If the Third Miss had revealed your identity, it would have exposed your true status," Qin Tian approached the bedside, reproaching him for his recklessness. He could have stayed outside, but he insisted on coming back. If he hadnâ€™t managed to divert those who were pursuing him last night, his identity would have certainly been compromised.

"I trust her. I believe she won't tell anyone about my injury," Helian Yichen said firmly, though he wasn't quite sure why he felt that way. Perhaps it was simply because he knew she was a cold-hearted person.

"Better safe than sorry," Qin Tian sighed, shaking his head. His master had a stubborn nature; once he believed something was right, no one could argue with him. He could only hope that the Third Miss was truly worthy of the trust the Master placed in her.

"When you distracted them last night, did they suspect anything?" Helian Yichen leaned back against the bed, half-closing his violet-tinted eyes. Despite his pale face, an air of languid elegance emanated from him, reflecting his noble status.

"Rest assured, the people from Nangong Manor didn't suspect us. They just thought a petty thief had sneaked into the manor. However, your actions last night were far too careless. You should have brought your subordinates along. It would have been better to have someone with you for support," Qin Tian expressed his disapproval of his master's impulsive decision.
