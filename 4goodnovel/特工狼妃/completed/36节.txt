He Still Wanted to Take Advantage of Her! 7

But his grip was as solid as a mountain, completely beyond her strength to break free from. All she could do was sulk in frustration and give up.

“If you want to know my name, just ask me directly. I’m Helian Yichen. From now on, you can call me Yichen, little enchantress. What’s your name?” Helian Yichen easily held her down with just one hand, deliberately twisting her words to share his name with her.

“Helian Yichen? There really are people with the surname Helian, huh? That’s quite a rare surname.” She couldn’t help but feel that the names in this world were all unusual combinations of rare surnames. Nángōng Nuò'ér’s lips twitched slightly as she spoke.

“Helian is the royal surname of the Helian Kingdom. Haven’t you heard of it?” Helian Yichen was astonished by her words. The fact that Helian was the royal surname of the Helian Kingdom was something every citizen in the realm should know. Even if she hadn’t received an education, she should at least have this common knowledge. What kind of strange woman was she?

“Oh, so it’s the royal surname of the Helian Kingdom. My apologies, I’m a bit ignorant.” Nángōng Nuò'ér felt a pang of annoyance. After arriving here, she should have asked more about this dynasty. Right now, standing before him, she felt like an idiot who didn’t even understand the basics. She promised herself she would catch up on the history of this era when she got back.

“Little enchantress, what’s your name? You haven’t told me yet. You appeared in the back courtyard of Nángōng Manor early this morning. Are you someone from Nángōng Manor?” If she was indeed from Nángōng Manor, it would be a piece of cake for him to take her back to the royal residence. Helian Yichen continued to tempt her with a low, smooth voice.

“My name... I’m Menghan, a maid from Nángōng Manor.” He was a distinguished guest of the manor and someone with a royal surname—his status was undoubtedly noble. If she told him her real name, Nángōng Nuò'ér knew it would be even harder to shake him off in the future. She decided to use the name she had in the twenty-first century and fabricated a false identity. Nángōng Manor was vast, and with so many maids, it wouldn’t be easy for him to find her. A strange glimmer flickered in Nángōng Nuò'ér’s eyes as she spoke.
