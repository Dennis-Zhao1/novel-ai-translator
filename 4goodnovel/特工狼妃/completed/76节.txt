**Inviting the Wolf into the House! 4**

“It's rare to meet a man I truly like. Can my sister really let him go so easily?!” Nangong Nuo'er pushed the empty bowl away from her, her tone casual but with a sharpness that cut through the air.

“He doesn’t belong to me. No matter how stubborn I am, it won't change anything. Rather than torturing myself, I might as well open my heart and find a better match, right?!” Each question she posed became more piercing, and Nangong Qian'er felt as if she was struggling to keep up.

“It’s great that you can think that way, sister.” But is it really that simple? Nangong Nuo'er narrowed her eyes, noticing the flicker of uncertainty in her sister's gaze. How dare she try to lie in front of her? She was still too naive.

“Little sister, ever since you came back from being missing, you’ve really changed. You didn’t used to speak like this.” In the past, Nuo'er didn’t have such a sharp gaze. Qian'er felt as if she were exposed under a harsh light, her sister’s cold expression radiating an aura that warned strangers to stay away. It terrified her—something that had never happened before.

“On the very first day I stepped into Nangong Manor, I believe I told you that I am no longer the old Nangong Nuo'er. What I used to be doesn’t matter anymore; it’s who I am now that counts. Sister, I hope you can remember that clearly.”

Seeing the panic in her sister’s eyes, a smirk crept onto Nangong Nuo'er’s lips, her voice chilling enough to send shivers down one’s spine. Good, this woman is starting to fear her; from now on, she wouldn’t have to worry about her scheming behind her back. Right now, she was at a disadvantage, and Nuo'er feared that love could easily turn to hatred, making things difficult to untangle.

“Alright, sister won’t bring up your past anymore. You’ve had your soup, so rest well. I’ll be heading out now.” Nangong Qian'er felt suffocated in the presence of her sister. This woman was too terrifying. In such a short time, what had happened to make her so cold and unfeeling?

“Take care, I won’t see you out.” Watching Nangong Qian'er leave in a flustered state, Nangong Nuo'er’s lips curled into a smirk as she scoffed coldly. She had been very clear with her sister from the start.
