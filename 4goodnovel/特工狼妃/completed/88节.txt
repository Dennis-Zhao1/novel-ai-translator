**Chapter 5: Do You Really Hope My Hand Becomes Disabled?**

“Too kind, thank you!” Nango Nuoer took his compliment as praise. Once he released her hand, she leaned on her cane and began to leave, while Xiaoxiao hurried forward to support her.

“Be careful not to hurt your foot, and remember to come back early.” Just as Nango Nuoer was about to reach the door, Heliang Yicheng’s calm reminder floated to her from behind.

“When I want to come back, I will naturally return,” Nango Nuoer replied, surprised by his words. The tone felt oddly like that of a husband reminding his wife as she stepped out. Her heart skipped several beats; moments ago, she thought he would be furious enough to want to kill her.

“Regardless, just be careful,” Heliang Yicheng thought to himself, feeling frustrated. He was vexed enough to wish he could strangle her, yet he couldn’t help but worry about her. It seemed he had truly fallen under her spell, utterly captivated.

“Don’t worry, I won’t let the same thing happen to me again,” Nango Nuoer responded, pulling herself away with a determined grip on her cane, Xiaoxiao assisting her as she hobbled off without looking back.

“I must be going insane. I definitely am insane,” Heliang Yicheng muttered to himself, rapping his fingers lightly against his head as he watched her retreating figure.

When Nango Nuoer hurried to the courtyard of Nango Yulou, she found Nango Yulou and Little Qi fiddling with the wheelchair she had requested.

“Nuo Nuo, you’re here! Come see if the wheelchair your second uncle made is alright.” Nango Yulou smiled bashfully, waving her over with his handsome face lighting up.

“Second Uncle?!” At her first glance of Nango Yulou, Nango Nuoer felt as if she had encountered the boy next door. She thought he should be in his forties, but he looked incredibly young—definitely not over thirty. He exuded a clean vibe, not just in appearance, but in an indescribable aura. He truly was a remarkably charming homebody.

“Nuo Nuo, why don’t you try sitting in it? If there’s any issue, I can adjust it further,” Nango Yulou said, a faint smile gracing his lips as he noticed her scrutinizing gaze. There seemed to be an inexplicable sense of intimacy between them.
