"Don't you dare mess around!" 

"Don't you dare mess around!" 

"You're such a shameless jerk, a disgusting pervert! Let go of me! Do you hear me? Let go!" She was caught in his embrace, his bare upper body pressing against her. The scent of him, infuriatingly intoxicating, filled her nostrils, making her heart race. Her hands flailed, unsure where to land, every attempt only making contact with his exposed skin. The heat radiating from him was overwhelming, and she felt trapped in an embarrassing situation, wishing she could disappear. This insufferable man had the thickest skin imaginable. 

“Shh, I suggest you stay still. Men are easily provoked, and if you keep moving around, I can't guarantee what I might do next.” Heryan Yichen's grip tightened around her slender waist, his deep, mesmerizing eyes shimmering with a seductive glint. His low, alluring voice whispered warnings in her ear; if she ignited the fire of desire, it would be entirely her own doing. 

“I knew it! All you men think with your lower halves!” Nangong Nuo'er’s face flushed with indignation, her anger turning her complexion a shade of greenish frustration. But she kept her body still; she had seen enough men to know how their lustful impulses could spiral out of control beyond anyone's imagination. 

“If you think you can provoke this beast next to you, I suggest you say something that really gets him going. Otherwise, he might just act on those primal instincts.” Heryan Yichen’s lips curled into a teasing smirk, his tone laced with mischief. 

“I...” Nangong Nuo'er swallowed her retort. To avoid giving this beast an excuse to unleash his desires, it seemed the best course of action was to stay silent and keep her body still.

“Good girl!” Heryan Yichen’s satisfaction was evident as she ceased her struggles and stopped bickering with him. A pleased smile crept across his face. 

Nangong Nuo'er had thought that sleeping in his arms would be impossible, yet strangely, she found herself slowly drifting into a peaceful slumber within his warm, spacious embrace. 

She never imagined she would feel so secure sleeping in his arms, and surprisingly, she slept soundly through the night. When the cheerful chirping of birds outside finally roused her, she found Heryan Yichen had already left the room. It seemed he was quite busy, rarely around the villa. But what he was up to was none of her concern, and honestly, she didn’t want to know.
