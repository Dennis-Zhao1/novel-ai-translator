We Will Meet Again! 3

“I told you not to be so easy to deal with. Now you can’t handle my retaliation, can you? Alright, it’s getting late, and I’m not going to play with you anymore. See you next time.” The masked figure suddenly turned and winked playfully at the brooding Helian Yichen, who was just descending from the tall tree. Taking advantage of his momentary distraction, the figure vanished into the night, leaving no chance for pursuit.

“Damn it!” Helian Yichen glared at the receding shadow, fury coursing through him as he struck the tree trunk with a powerful slap. Leaves cascaded down like confetti against the dimly lit night sky.

Habits aren’t always a good thing; they can easily turn into dependencies. Nangong Nuo’er disliked this feeling. In her world, she was used to being independent, but now she found herself surrounded by too many people.

Her feelings toward Helian Yichen had shifted from initial rejection to a growing acceptance. She realized he had begun to influence her in ways she hadn’t anticipated.

She was accustomed to having Xiao Xiao by her side, catering to her every need. Now, after just two days without her, she felt out of sorts. It wasn’t that Ziyan wasn’t attentive; she simply felt that Ziyan couldn’t compare to the closeness she shared with Xiao Xiao. She preferred Xiao Xiao's company.

“Why are you daydreaming by the window so early?” A deep, concerned voice broke into her thoughts, and she felt a warm cloak drape over her shoulders. Helian Yichen had noticed her thin attire and had taken it upon himself to cover her.

“It’s nothing, I was just thinking about Xiao Xiao.” Nangong Nuo’er glanced down at the cloak draped over her shoulders, her voice slightly hoarse, likely due to staying up too late the night before.

“I thought you were thinking about me.” Helian Yichen’s warm breath enveloped her as he pulled her into his embrace, burying his face in her neck and inhaling her fresh, subtle scent. A glimmer of satisfaction flickered in his deep purple eyes at the fact that she didn’t push him away.

“With you always clinging to me, there’s hardly any space to miss you,” Nangong Nuo’er relaxed into him, letting her entire weight rest against him.

“Is it that when I’m not by your side, you start to miss me? Hmm?” Helian Yichen’s lips curled into a teasing smile at her words.
