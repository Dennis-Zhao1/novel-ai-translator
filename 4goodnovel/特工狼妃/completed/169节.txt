**Chapter 2: Devouring Her Tofu!**

The soft, delicate skin was too tempting to resist, and he couldn't help but squeeze her wrist lightly. He never expected that this maid would have such smooth skin—it felt just like silky tofu, and he found it hard to let go.

Ziyan froze for a moment, caught off guard by his grip. She didn't know how to react; part of her wanted to pull her hand away, but she was also worried about offending him.

“Big Young Master, the Third Miss has gone far ahead. We need to catch up,” Xiaoxiao said, flashing a quick, apologetic smile at him before tugging at Ziyan to hastily follow the departing Nangong Nuo'er.

As they left, Ziyan couldn't help but glance back at Nangong Xuduan. A strange glimmer flickered in her eyes for a brief moment before she hurried after Xiaoxiao.

"What a fresh and lovely girl! To waste her as a maid seems like such a pity!" Although she wasn't as stunning as his own sister, she was still a beauty who could make fish sink and birds fall. Nangong Xuduan brought the hand that had touched Ziyan to his nose and inhaled deeply, catching a faint, enchanting fragrance that made his heart flutter.

“Brother, did you enjoy your taste of beauty?” A teasing voice broke into his thoughts.

“Nangong Qier, how can you say such things? You know who I like. How could I ever like someone else?” Nangong Xuduan stiffened at her words, turning to face Nangong Qier, who had been watching them for who knows how long.

“I know who you like, but do you think you still have a chance? The prince spent the night in her room. He can, but can you?!” Nangong Qier's voice dripped with bitterness. She had thought their hopes were dashed, but now it seemed like they were back together. It was infuriating! Why did that girl have to return to the Nangong family after leaving? If she hadn’t come back, Nangong Qier was certain she would have been able to marry Helian Yichen as a secondary consort.

“Nangong Qier, don’t go too far.” Nangong Xuduan felt a rush of anger at her words, veins throbbing at his temples. Just the thought of them together made him feel like he could explode. He had stood by her side for so long; she was meant to be his. If it weren't for that cursed prince, they would still be like they were before. 

The tension in the air thickened, each word exchanged laden with unspoken desires and frustrations, as the day unfolded with the promise of complications yet to come.
