“You cold-hearted, heartless woman!”

She wasn’t Nangong Nuo’er; it was she who insisted on keeping her around. By now, she should have realized the danger of inviting a wolf into her home. But would Helian Yichen really fall for a woman like her? Surely, his taste couldn’t be that poor.

“Damn it, why am I thinking about him again?!” Nangong Nuo’er froze for a moment, utterly perplexed by the thoughts that had unexpectedly surfaced in her mind.

Ever since Nangong Qian’er personally delivered medicine to Nangong Nuo’er and experienced her sharp tongue, she had never come to deliver any more. Instead, she had the servants bring it after boiling it in the kitchen. They were always punctual, arriving at the same hour every day.

Sometimes, Nangong Nuo’er felt that something was wrong with her. Before taking the medicine, she would occasionally experience dizziness, headaches, and a bit of coldness, her demeanor feeling somewhat ethereal. She had only sustained an injury to her foot; it wasn’t like she had lost a lot of blood—why was this happening? Nangong Nuo’er could never quite understand. Yet, after taking the medicine, she would feel unusually energetic and excited.

Although she felt puzzled, it didn’t seem serious enough for her to pay much attention. Nangong Xuandan came to visit her every day, trying everything he could to cheer her up, but his efforts had the opposite effect. When he gifted her gold and silver jewelry, she would simply turn and reward the servants with it. When he brought her animals, like a little white rabbit, she would hand it over to the servants, commanding them to take it to the kitchen for dinner. This left him furious, with no outlet for his frustration.

Helian Yichen had been unusually busy lately, coming and going at odd hours, seemingly involved in some important matters. He never spoke of it, and Nangong Nuo’er rarely inquired. As long as he kept his hands to himself, she felt grateful enough.

She just wanted to quietly recover from her foot injury in the Nangong Manor, then head to the capital to gather information about Xianzheng. She understood the meaning behind Xianle’s intentions; she wanted her to make use of Helian Yichen. However, she believed that with her own abilities, she could accomplish the task without relying on this unruly man.

In the bustling city of the twenty-first century, the night only grew more vibrant, but in ancient times, the nights became increasingly silent. After midnight, everything around her fell into a profound stillness; even the sound of a needle dropping on the ground could be distinctly heard.

Nangong Nuo’er’s mind wandered as she sat in her dimly lit room, the shadows dancing along the walls, mirroring the turmoil in her heart. She wrapped her arms around her knees, trying to find comfort in her thoughts. Each day felt like a monotonous cycle, yet every moment was tinged with anticipation. Would she truly be able to uncover the truth about Xianzheng? And what role would Helian Yichen play in her journey? The uncertainty gnawed at her, but she was determined to stand firm, no matter what challenges lay ahead.
