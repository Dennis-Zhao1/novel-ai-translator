**Who Betrayed Her?**

“Xiaoxiao, when you were brewing the medicine, did anyone see or come into contact with the potion cauldron?!” Nangong Nuo'er asked, her tone serious and probing.

“Third Miss, no one did! I followed your instructions to brew it in secret. Only you, me, and Xiao Qi know about it. Is there something wrong, Third Miss?!” Xiaoxiao replied, her voice laced with concern.

“I suspect someone added unnecessary ingredients to the medicine. My cravings haven't flared up tonight, which means I must have taken the black jade ointment today. Xiaoxiao, tell me honestly—did you betray me?!” Nangong Nuo'er’s piercing gaze felt like a laser, scrutinizing every flicker of Xiaoxiao’s expression. There was nowhere to hide.

“Third Miss, I only wish for you to overcome your addiction! How could I ever betray you? You saved my life! Even if it cost me mine, I wouldn't turn against you. My loyalty to you is as clear as day—I truly did not betray you,” Xiaoxiao exclaimed, dropping to her knees in front of her, sincerity dripping from every word.

“Nangong Nuo'er, the one who brewed the medicine is you, and the one who delivered it is Xiao Qi. If you didn’t betray me, then it must have been Xiao Qi. Go bring him to see me,” she snapped, rage bubbling within her. Damn it, she had been so close to kicking this addiction once and for all. Did he want to kill her?! It infuriated her to think that all those nights of suffering might have been for nothing. She couldn't believe Xiao Qi would do this, yet only the two of them had handled that bowl of medicine.

It was either Xiaoxiao or Xiao Qi, and either way, it broke her heart. She had considered them both her right hands.

“Third Miss, it can't be Xiao Qi! Just like me, he is loyal to you. He would never betray you,” Xiaoxiao insisted. She knew Xiao Qi too well; she couldn't fathom him turning against the Third Miss.

“Hmph, talking is pointless now. Just get him here. Don’t tell him what’s happened yet—let him come first.” At that moment, doubt gnawed at her. Was there anyone left in this world she could trust?!

“Understood, Third Miss. I’ll go find him right away.” With a heavy heart, Xiaoxiao stepped outside, anxiety swirling within her. How could this happen? Why was there a problem with the Third Miss’s medicine? It should have been the time for her to be stable! 

As she made her way through the corridors, her mind raced with concern. What was happening to their carefully constructed world?
