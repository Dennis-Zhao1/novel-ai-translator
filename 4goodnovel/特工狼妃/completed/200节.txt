His fist came down hard!

"If you're going to say it like that, you can turn around and say it to me directly. Let me be the mouse, and you can be the cat." She was the one who struck first, yet now he was the one taking care of her. It could be said that he was a mouse repaying kindness with kindness. Watching her pale face slowly regain a hint of color, Helyan Yichen finally felt like joking. Her earlier appearance had nearly scared him to death.

"Hmph!" In response to his well-meaning suggestion, Nangong Nuoer merely let out a cold huff. There was no need to show too much mercy to an enemy, and he certainly fit the bill—whether he was a cat or a mouse, it didn’t matter. Still, the way he massaged her was surprisingly pleasant, making her want to drift off to sleep. His long fingers, working through a warm towel, gently massaged her lower abdomen with just the right amount of pressure, gradually easing her pain.

Seeing her relax little by little, Helyan Yichen felt his worried heart finally start to settle. He whispered softly to her in his mind, “Sleep now. When you wake up, you won’t feel so much pain anymore.”

Under his tender care, Nangong Nuoer gradually slipped into a deep sleep. His fingers didn’t withdraw just because she had closed her eyes; instead, they continued to massage her gently, as if he were caring for the most beloved woman in his life.

Time passed, though how long it was he couldn’t tell. Eventually, Xiaoxiao brought the doctor in. Reluctantly, Helyan Yichen pulled his hand away from her abdomen, covered her up with the blanket, and turned to the others with a gesture for silence. She had just fallen asleep, and he didn’t want to wake her.

Once the doctor finished examining Nangong Nuoer, Helyan Yichen took one last lingering glance at her peaceful face before he quietly exited the room with the doctor.

“Doctor, how is my fiancée?! Is she going to be okay?” Once outside and after closing the door, Helyan Yichen couldn’t contain his worry and lowered his voice to ask. He didn’t want anything to happen to her.

“She just started her period today, and her lower abdomen took a heavy blow,” the doctor replied. “I’ve just examined her, and I’m afraid that this impact might leave her with lingering issues. She’ll likely experience pain for several days every month from now on. As her fiancé, you shouldn’t have let her suffer such a near-fatal injury.” The doctor only knew that Nangong Nuoer had been hit hard in the abdomen, but he was oblivious to the fact that the culprit was standing right in front of him.
