"Take off your clothes!" 

The words echoed in the air, causing his face to shift between shades of green and white. Yes, she was right; he indeed had improper thoughts about her. He thought he had hidden it well, but hearing it spoken aloud from her lips made him feel ashamed enough to want to bang his head against the wall.

"If you don’t do as I say, just wait and see what happens! What is this?!" Nangong Nuoer lowered her head and noticed a familiar silk fabric peeking out from his embrace. In a flash, she reached out to pull it out, only to discover with fury that it was her own bellyband. The realization that he had hidden her bellyband in his possession made her blood boil. Imagining how he might have desecrated it, Nangong Nuoer could no longer hold back her anger. She raised her hand and slapped him hard, her voice ringing with fury as she exclaimed, "How dare you hide my bellyband, you shameless beast! I’m your sister!"

As if one slap wasn’t enough, she followed it up with another, the sharp sound cutting through the heavy silence, leaving Nangong Xudang’s face swollen and red. She struck without mercy, each slap fueled by indignation.

"Little sister, I was wrong. Please don’t tell Grandma about this," Nangong Xudang pleaded. The moment he saw her bellyband in his hands, he knew he was in deep trouble. He didn’t even try to evade her slaps, accepting them as he desperately wished for her to keep this incident from their grandmother.

Ziyan, who had already known about the Third Miss's ruthless methods, was genuinely shocked. She didn’t dare to breathe, wanting to speak up for Nangong Xudang but lacking the courage to do so.

"You’ve gone too far this time, Nangong Xudang. Are you going to marry Ziyan or not?!" Nangong Nuoer gripped the bellyband tightly, her face turning pale with rage as her body trembled.

"I will, I will! Just don’t be angry, little sister," Nangong Xudang quickly replied, seeing her face contort with fury and knowing he couldn’t afford to defy her at that moment.

"Ziyan, let me ask you one more time. Do you regret marrying him as a concubine?!" Nangong Nuoer took a moment to calm her tumultuous emotions before directing her icy gaze toward the trembling Ziyan, her tone sharp as she questioned her again.

"Ziyan will follow the Third Miss’s decision. Ziyan has no objections," Ziyan managed to stammer, shaking with fear.

"Don’t you really want to think it over?!" 

The air was thick with tension as the siblings confronted one another, their destinies hanging in the balance.
