**The Man Who Intruded Her Chamber! Part 3**

However, she always felt that her smile was forced, her exaggerated expressions betraying a hint of hypocrisy. Nangong Nuo'er furrowed her brow slightly and replied dismissively, "What’s there to be embarrassed about? He’s your elder brother, and you’re his sister. It’s only natural for an older brother to be concerned about his younger sister. But once he returns, he will surely come looking for you first. If you have something to say, you can talk to him directly."

Hao Yue Lian Si’s smile grew even brighter. 

“Oh, really?” Did this so-called brother of hers have a good relationship with the real Nangong Nuo'er? Nangong Nuo'er responded with a blank expression.

“Of course! You two have always been close, haven’t you forgotten?” Hao Yue Lian Si looked puzzled at her indifference, clearly unaware of Nuo'er’s amnesia.

“Sorry, I’ve lost my memory. I’ve forgotten everything here, including my brother,” Nangong Nuo'er knew that no matter how much she explained, they wouldn’t believe she wasn’t the real Nangong Nuo'er. To avoid being pestered, playing the fool and pretending to have amnesia was a practical approach, so she decided to just go along with it.

“What? Nuo'er, you’ve lost your memory? Oh my gosh, how did that happen? During the time you were out, did anyone bully you?” Upon hearing about her amnesia, Hao Yue Lian Si’s voice, already sharp, became even sharper, as if she truly believed Nuo'er had been mistreated.

“Bullied?” The only one who bullied was herself; who would dare to bully her? A smirk of mockery curled at the corners of Nangong Nuo'er’s lips. This second aunt was quite amusing.

“You’re a young girl wandering outside, and you’re so beautiful. There are many bad people out there—did you… did you get bullied at all?” Hao Yue Lian Si’s suspicious gaze roamed over her, as if trying to find some clue.

“Aunt, are you wishing for me to be bullied?” Seeing the sparkle in her eyes, Nangong Nuo'er felt a strong urge to kick her out. But realizing she was in a new place, she decided to endure her for the time being.

“How could I think that? I’m just concerned about you,” Hao Yue Lian Si replied with a big grin, clearly not smart enough to realize she was contradicting herself.
