He Actually Encouraged Her to Keep Eating! 2

"Uncle, don't worry! I won't let a man make me unhappy. What did Xiao Qi tell you?!" Did Xiao Qi really spill the beans about her being addicted to the black jade ointment? She hadn't had much contact with him, and she wasn't sure what kind of person he was.

"Nuonuo, I'm your family. Can’t you trust me? Xiao Qi has told me everything, including your..." Nangong Yulou started but trailed off, leaving the air thick with unspoken words. Yet, Nangong Nuonuo already knew where the conversation was heading.

"Xiao Qi really told you everything?!" Nangong Nuonuo felt a pang of annoyance. She had explicitly asked Xiaoxiao to keep her matters private, yet Xiao Qi had gone and informed Nangong Yulou without even asking her first.

"Nuonuo, don’t blame Xiao Qi. I sensed he was troubled, so I pressed him for more details, and he let it slip. I just want to help you, as we are family. You should confide in me; I can assist you," Nangong Yulou said earnestly, placing his hand on her shoulder.

"Uncle, you don’t need to worry about me. I can handle my own problems. I didn’t tell you because I didn’t want you to be concerned," Nangong Nuonuo shook her head, trying to dismiss his worries.

"Nuonuo, being addicted to black jade ointment is no small matter. The court is cracking down hard on it, and it's tough to even find it outside. Let me help you; I can’t bear to see you suffer like this," Nangong Yulou’s expression shifted, and he spoke with a serious tone.

"Uncle, are you suggesting I keep using it? No way! I can’t continue this; I need to quit," she exclaimed, her voice turning cold as she pushed his hand away, her resolve hardening.

"Nuonuo, listen to me. Ever since this substance appeared, I’ve never heard of anyone successfully quitting their addiction. Some people go mad when they can’t afford it, they self-harm, and many have even taken their own lives. I've heard enough of these stories, and I don’t want to see you become one of them. Trust me, Uncle will find a way to help you get it," Nangong Yulou looked at her with deep concern.
