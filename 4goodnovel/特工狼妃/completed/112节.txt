He actually encouraged her to keep eating!

At that moment, a light footfall came from behind her, followed by a soft breeze brushing past her ear. Something had sliced through the air and landed on the surface of the lake, creating a series of splashes that broke the tranquil water.

Nangong Nuo'er paused, wondering who had intruded upon her private space. Slowly, she turned her head only to find Nangong Yulou approaching her with a faint smile, holding some broken tiles in hand. Surprised, she exclaimed, "What are you doing here?!"

"I came because Xiao Qi told me you were here. What's wrong? You seem a bit down," Nangong Yulou replied as he walked over to her side. He tossed a piece of tile lightly onto the water. The tile arced gracefully before landing and skipping several times on the surface, splashing up white droplets before finally sinking to the bottom. Holding out another piece to Nuo'er, he said, "Want to give it a try?"

"Sure." Nangong Nuo'er took a piece of tile, tilted her wrist slightly, and with a swift motion, flicked the tile out into the air. It soared across the space, hit the water, and danced up, splashing bright silver droplets before disappearing beneath the surface.

"I didn’t realize you still remembered how to skip stones. I thought you’d forgotten," Nangong Yulou observed, his eyes sparkling at her skillful technique.

"This is easy. It’s not that I remembered; it's just that I grasp things quickly. There’s no challenge in this for me," Nangong Nuo'er replied nonchalantly.

"Don’t you think that playing this can help wash away your worries?" Nangong Yulou encouraged her to continue.

"Uncle, I’m not feeling unhappy," Nangong Nuo'er insisted, continuing to toss the tiles. With each piece that flew off, she felt the weight on her heart slowly lifting.

"You don’t have to hide it from me. Xiao Qi has already told me everything. Fate can be quite a torment, you know? Just think of it as having a connection but not the right timing. The forest is vast; there’s no need to give up the whole forest for a single tree," Nangong Yulou said, watching her fiercely send the tiles flying. A smile of satisfaction spread across his face, pleased to see her engaging in something joyful. Truly, she was a pupil worthy of guidance.
