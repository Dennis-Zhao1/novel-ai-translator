**My Woman Doesn’t Need Others’ Concern! 2**

"You make a good point, but their dam is so high, and the flood prevention measures are so solid. How do you intend to flood them?" Tuo Bao Tianye expressed genuine interest in her insights.

"This is simple. We have to discreetly divert the water in an unexpected manner. If we can sabotage their dam, once it’s destroyed, it will certainly catch them off guard." She explained. Once the dam was breached, the torrent would rush into their camp, and in the ensuing chaos, they would instinctively prioritize saving their cargo, providing the perfect opportunity to capture them.

"Your plan isn't unfeasible, but how do you intend to destroy the dam in such a short time?" Helian Yichen stroked his chin, pondering her question.

"If you trust me, I have a way to bring down the dam," Nangong Nuo'er raised her glass and took a sip, a confident smile spreading across her face.

"With that kind of confidence, as your man, I’ll be the first to support you," Helian Yichen said, his gaze filled with affection. Even if she was just toying around, he was willing to let her play.

"Since His Highness has expressed his approval, I have no objections either. Xi’er, I’m looking forward to the surprise you’ll bring!" Tuo Bao Tianye added with an encouraging smile.

"Give me two days, and you won’t be disappointed," Nangong Nuo'er said, her face glowing with self-assurance.

As they gazed at her confident expression, both men couldn't help but share looks of admiration, eagerly awaiting her performance.

After Xiao Qi delivered the message to General Xing, he returned to report back.

"Xiao Qi, you personally handed the letter to General Xing, right?" Nangong Nuo'er asked, a hint of concern in her voice.

"Miss San, please rest assured. I personally handed the letter to General Xing," Xiao Qi replied earnestly. After all, Miss San had repeatedly instructed him to do so; he wouldn’t dare let someone else handle it.

"Very good. What was his reaction after reading the letter?" Nangong Nuo'er leaned back on the cushion, carefully trimming her long nails with a small knife, her tone casual as she inquired.

"After reading the letter, General Xing's face turned grim, as if he wanted to kill someone. It scared me so much; I almost thought he was going to murder me," Xiao Qi recounted, still feeling the lingering fear.

"What, are you afraid of dying?" Nangong Nuo'er lifted her eyelids, her expression unreadable.

"I’m not afraid of death. As long as it’s something Miss San instructed, even if it means dying, I won’t back down," Xiao Qi replied boldly.

"Silly boy, you’re my subordinate. Why would I send you to your death? If you die, who’s going to help me in the future? Listen carefully, without my permission, you better protect your own life and don’t let it slip away." Her tone was cold and unfeeling, not even glancing at him, but to Xiao Qi, it felt deeply touching.

Miss San is concerned about him. If she wasn’t, why would she care for his well-being? Xiao Qi’s heart swelled with gratitude as he replied, "Miss San, please rest assured! Xiao Qi will definitely make sure I don’t die so easily."
