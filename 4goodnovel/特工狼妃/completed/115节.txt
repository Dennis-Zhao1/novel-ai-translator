"Don't mention her in front of me!" 

Herlian Yicheng heard Qin Tian's reminder and finally realized he had indeed fed the bird too much. He quickly retracted the birdseed in his hand, not allowing it to eat any more.

"Master, if you can't let go of Miss San, why not go find her?!" Qin Tian didn't want to see him sulking like this.

"I told you not to mention her in front of me, didn't I?!" Herlian Yicheng was playing with the black eagle, but upon hearing her name, his tone immediately turned icy.

"That’s true, you did say that. However, it's not I who brings her up now, but your own heart that can't let go of Miss San." Qin Tian had never been one to cling to the past, but this time it seemed Herlian Yicheng truly couldn't forget her, which prompted his bold suggestion.

"Qin Tian, you should understand the purpose of our trip here. She has fallen into a drug addiction, and you want me to feel at ease?! Are you suggesting I bring a junkie back to the manor?"

He genuinely wanted her to be his, but why did she have to become addicted to those damned drugs at such a time?! He loathed her for not taking care of her own body, and he loathed himself even more for still yearning for her. A sharp pain throbbed at his temples.

"Master, shouldn’t we clarify this matter before jumping to conclusions? I can't shake the feeling that there's something off about Miss San's situation. If she willingly took the black jade ointment, then why is she trying to quit now? As far as I know, no one in the Herlian Kingdom has ever successfully kicked this addiction. If it was truly self-destruction, why wouldn’t she just continue using it?!"

As an outsider, he had a clearer perspective. Ever since that night, he had thought it over many times and felt there must be something more to the story. It wasn't fair to Miss San for the Master to remain indifferent.

"If she didn't take it herself, then did someone force it on her? If she is innocent, why hide it from me? And why did she give me the sleeping tea? If I hadn't sensed something was off that night and secretly poured out that cup of tea, how much longer would she have kept this from me?!" Herlian Yicheng's face was taut with tension.

"I still believe that Miss San has her reasons," Qin Tian insisted. He did not think she was the type to willingly spiral into ruin. "I truly believe she isn’t as reckless as she seems."

The tension hung thick in the air, each word weighing heavily as the truth of Miss San’s predicament began to unravel before them.
