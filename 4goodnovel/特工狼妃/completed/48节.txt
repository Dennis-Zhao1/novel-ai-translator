**"Don't Touch Me!" Part 2**

The chilling light made them shiver. Although each of them had their own opinions and wished that Helian Yichen wouldn’t marry Nuo’er, at that moment, no one dared to speak up. After all, who would be foolish enough to offend such a distinguished guest? Unless they were courting death.

“Very well, it seems everyone has no objections now. Let’s not disturb Nuo’er’s rest. Qin Tian, see our guests out,” Helian Yichen scanned them with a cold gaze before issuing his dismissal.

“Yes, Master! Please, everyone!” Qin Tian, who had been lurking unnoticed in the shadows, stepped forward at his master’s command to escort the guests out.

The faces of the Nangong family turned increasingly grim. Despite their disapproval of the marriage, they couldn’t afford to offend Helian Yichen, a member of the royal family. They had no choice but to leave in disgruntled silence.

“Little sister, take care of yourself,” Nangong Xudan turned back with a tinge of concern before they exited.

“I will,” Nuo’er replied, watching them leave and finally letting out a sigh of relief.

The raucous crows had finally departed, and Nuo’er thought that with them gone, she would enjoy some peace. But she was mistaken. Even with only two people left in the room—herself and, of course, Helian Yichen—it seemed he had no intention of letting her have a moment's quiet.

“So your name is Nuo’er, such a lovely name. Why did you hide it from me?” He remarked, his tone laced with curiosity. She had not only concealed her name; she had deceitfully claimed to be just a maid, proving to be quite an unlikable woman in his eyes. Helian Yichen perched himself on the edge of the bed, gently stroking her slightly cold cheek with his long fingers. Her face was indeed small; his hand could easily encompass it, giving her an adorable, youthful appearance.

“A name is merely a code,” Nuo’er replied, allowing his fingers to linger on her face. 

“A name is merely a code,” she repeated, feeling drained and lacking the energy to resist him. She was too weary to argue any further.

“Don’t deceive me again. You must understand that I dislike being lied to.” Even if it was just a name, to him, it was an unforgivable offense. Helian Yichen's attitude was domineering, and his tone left no room for refusal.

“I’ll try my best,” she retorted with a hint of defiance, though internally she scoffed. Who would enjoy being deceived? Did he really think she liked being tricked?
