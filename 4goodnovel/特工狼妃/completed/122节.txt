**She Wants to Follow Her Cousin Out! 2**

---

It seemed that this matter couldn't be resolved without him taking charge. After a moment of contemplation, Tuo Ba Tianye made up his mind to head south personally. 

"What? Cousin, where are you going? I want to go too!" At that moment, a girl dressed in a green outfit burst in from outside. Hearing Tuo Ba Tianye was about to leave for a long journey, she immediately shouted.

"Lanqin, I have important business to attend to. It’s not appropriate for a young lady like you to follow me," Tuo Ba Tianye frowned as he saw his troublesome cousin, Murong Lanqin, come in.

"I don't care! I just want to go with you. I haven't been out in ages! Cousin, please take me along. I can help you with whatever you need," Murong Lanqin tugged at his sleeve, her voice sweet and pleading.

"Lanqin, I’m going to handle something very important. It's not a trip for leisure; you should stay here obediently. If you're feeling bored, just let Sanlang keep you company," Tuo Ba Tianye knew that Sanlang had always had a soft spot for Murong Lanqin. He subtly winked at Sanlang, signaling him to step in.

"Yes, Lanqin, big brother is going south this time, and who knows when he’ll return? There might even be dangers involved. You should stay at the Golden Dragon Society. During this time, I’ll help big brother manage things here. If you feel bored, I can keep you entertained," Sanlang quickly chimed in, catching onto his brother's cue.

"No way! I refuse to stay at the Golden Dragon Society. I want to follow Cousin wherever he goes! As long as Cousin is with me, I’m not afraid of any danger," Murong Lanqin shook her head vehemently. She had no intention of hanging out with the dull Sanlang; that would be so boring!

"Lanqin, listen to your cousin. Stay at the Golden Dragon Society obediently. If something happens, how am I supposed to explain it to your parents?!" Tuo Ba Tianye said, feeling a bit of a headache coming on.

"I don’t care! When my parents died, you promised to take good care of me. If you abandon me now, I’ll go cry at my parents' graves until I die!" Murong Lanqin knew that bringing up her deceased parents would put Tuo Ba Tianye in a bind. It was a card she played well, and she wasn’t about to waste such a useful tactic.
