**The Enchantment of the Night Coast! Chapter 12**

She never intended to get entangled with anyone, primarily because she was an agent—one whose life could be in danger at any moment. Adding to that, her identity was a closely guarded secret, making her wary of forming connections with ordinary people. After spending a night entwined with him, he had taken her virginity, while all she managed to take away was one of his garments.

As Menghan left the beach, feeling both exhausted and hungry, she arrived at a town that left her momentarily stunned. For several seconds, her mind seemed to stop functioning as she took in the sight before her: an incredibly ancient town, where not only the buildings looked old, but everyone walking down the street was dressed in traditional clothing.

Staring at this dramatically surreal scene, she frowned slightly and bit down gently on one of her pale fingertips, immediately feeling a twinge of pain. 

"Oh my god, this isn't a dream. I'm wide awake!" Her eyes widened in disbelief as she began searching her surroundings, desperately trying to spot any hidden cameras. But after looking for a long time, she found nothing.

“What’s going on? Did I just time travel? Damn it, what is happening?” Menghan furrowed her brow and rubbed her eyes, still confronted by the antique market filled with ancient people.

“Third Miss, you are the Third Miss! I finally found you! Where have you been these past few days? It’s been so hard to track you down!” Just as Menghan was still trying to digest the fact that she might have crossed over from the 21st century into ancient times, a handsome young boy, who looked no older than sixteen or seventeen, came running up to her. Upon seeing her, his face lit up with excitement.

“What Third Miss? I’m not anyone’s Third Miss! You must have the wrong person!” Menghan frowned at the sudden approach, assuming he was just another bored person trying to strike up a conversation. She turned on her heel and attempted to walk away.

“You are the Third Miss of the Nangong family! I’m the little boy you saved, Qi! Don’t you remember me?” The boy, Qi, looked momentarily dejected when she turned to leave, but his expression quickly brightened as he rushed after her, speaking with enthusiasm.

“What Nangong family? I’ve never even heard of it! And you can’t even recognize your own savior? You really are hopeless.” Menghan didn't halt her steps, her tone icy and devoid of any warmth.
