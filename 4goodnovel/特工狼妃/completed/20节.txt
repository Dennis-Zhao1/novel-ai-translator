still lingered in the air!

“Thank you for your kindness! I will definitely take your advice,” Meng Han said with a gentle nod. Since she had already decided to stay here for a while, she wouldn’t hold back.

As they chatted, they arrived at a quaint little courtyard. Upon entering, a young woman dressed as a maid stepped out from inside. When she saw Meng Han, her eyes lit up with surprise and delight. It seemed she wanted to rush forward to speak with her, but upon noticing Nangong Qian’er, she restrained her impulse.

“Third Sister, this is where you used to live. This is your personal maid, Xiaoxiao. Xiaoxiao, your young lady has lost her memory, so you must take good care of her. If anything goes wrong, I’ll hold you responsible, understand?” Nangong Qian’er spoke to the maid with a tone that left no room for argument, treating her sister as if she had never faltered.

“Yes, Second Miss!” Xiaoxiao seemed to shrink a little under Nangong Qian’er’s stern gaze.

“Third Sister, let someone help you bathe and change. After you rest for a bit, we’ll have a meal together. I have some matters to attend to, so I'll take my leave for now,” Nangong Qian’er offered an apologetic smile before excusing herself.

“Miss, you’ve finally returned! Where have you been these past few days? I was worried sick!” As soon as Nangong Qian’er left, Xiaoxiao’s demeanor changed completely; she eagerly stepped forward, her face beaming with happiness.

“I don’t want to talk about it. Please prepare for my bath,” Meng Han replied coldly. After returning from the beach that morning, she had only bought a new outfit to change into before coming here. Even now, she could still faintly smell the essence of that man on her, which made her uncomfortable. In the past, if she had to come into contact with a man, she would soak in the bath for hours afterward, scrubbing away any trace of their scent.

“Yes, Third Miss!” Xiaoxiao noticed the chill in her expression and hesitated for a moment. It felt as if her mistress had become a different person entirely. Her demeanor was unrecognizable compared to before. Could it be that her memory loss had altered her personality as well? Poor Third Miss, Xiaoxiao thought sympathetically, although she decided to keep her thoughts to herself and turned to prepare for the bath. 

As she left, Meng Han stood still for a moment, her mind swirling with memories that felt just out of reach, like shadows slipping through her fingers. The courtyard, once a familiar haven, now felt foreign and distant, a reminder of a past she couldn't grasp.
