**Chapter 1: Stripped of Pretense**

“Wait, what? He actually said that to you?” The shock was evident in Nan Gong Nuo Er’s voice as her expression darkened. While it was true she had a connection with him, did he really need to broadcast it to the world? 

“It wasn’t the prince himself who told me. It was his subordinate, Qin Tian. People like us, who are of lower status, hardly get a chance to speak with the prince directly. He mentioned that the prince has already decided to take Third Miss as his concubine. So, before leaving the Nan Gong Manor, you must live with the prince,” Xiao Xiao said cautiously, glancing at the increasingly pale Third Miss.

“Oh, so he said I belong to him because of this whole concubine situation.” Nan Gong Nuo Er realized that she had misunderstood him, her anxiety had clouded her judgment. It seemed that a guilty conscience really does make one paranoid! With that thought, she finally exhaled a sigh of relief.

“Then what did you think it was about?” Xiao Xiao asked, confusion evident in her gaze.

“Nothing much. I’m just a little hungry. Could you please go to the kitchen and bring me something to eat?” Nan Gong Nuo Er’s hand instinctively went to her flat stomach, which had been grumbling for food.

“Of course, Third Miss. Please wait a moment,” Xiao Xiao nodded and hurried out.

“Ugh, what a nightmare. I suddenly find myself in this bizarre world, then I have to deal with that infuriating Helian Yichen, and now this mysterious Xian Le pops up. Seriously, is the universe just playing a prank on me?” 

Nan Gong Nuo Er turned to gaze out the window at the clear blue sky and fluffy white clouds, unable to suppress a deep sigh. There was nothing more tragic than discovering that she was merely a pawn in someone else’s game. Was her earlier dream just an illusion, or did it truly carry a deeper meaning?

If it was true, did that mean she only had five years left to live before finding the Xian Zheng? Damn it, Xian Le hadn’t even answered her question earlier. Was she the one pulling Helian Yichen closer to her?

Even if she didn’t respond, it was likely she understood that it was her who needed to manipulate Helian Yichen. Who else could it be? And what about the real Nan Gong San Miss? Where could she possibly be? Was she also a pawn in Xian Le’s game?

“Little sister, are you awake?” Just as Nan Gong Nuo Er was wallowing in her frustration, a voice broke through her thoughts. It was Nan Gong Xu Dan.

“I’m awake. What’s going on?” Nan Gong Nuo Er replied upon recognizing his voice.
