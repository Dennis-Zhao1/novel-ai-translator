**The Seductive Temptation of the Coastal Night! Part 3**

Mr. Jin lay on the waterbed, his anxiety palpable as he gazed at her with his squinting green bean-like eyes, looking as if he couldn't resist the urge to devour her whole.

"Don't rush, soon I will make you feel an overwhelming desire," she replied, a mischievous glint flashing in Meng Han's sharp eyes as she slowly straddled his waist. With deft hands, she began to massage his back, her fingers dancing skillfully across his skin. As she worked, she exhaled softly, her voice like fragrant whispers. "Mr. Jin, does it feel good?"

"Mm, it feels nice..." Under her skilled touch, Mr. Jin couldn't help but let out a series of low, satisfied moans. Her technique was impeccable, each movement precisely hitting the right spots, sending waves of euphoric sensations through him.

"Your comfort is my greatest wish," she said, her seductive gaze fixed on his spine. As Meng Han's right hand slid gently down his back, she felt her palm land on his vulnerable spine. Just as she intended to apply pressure in just the right spot, a sudden flash from the glass mirror on the bedside caught her attention.

In that instant, a bullet shot toward her from outside the door.

Without a moment to spare, Meng Han rolled off the bed just as she heard a loud 'bang'—the bullet that was meant for her struck the wall instead.

At that moment, Mr. Jin, who had been lying on the bed, sprang into action, launching himself toward Meng Han. She cursed herself silently, realizing the danger. Swiftly dodging his advance, she braced herself against the bed's railing and propelled herself toward the exit.

"Catch her! Don’t let her escape!" Mr. Jin shouted, hastily throwing on a nearby robe before chasing after her.

At that same time, the security team of the mansion sprang into action, sharp gunfire echoing through the halls, yet none managed to hit their target.

Mr. Jin dashed out onto the balcony, catching sight of Meng Han, clad only in her minimal lingerie, as she leapt from the second floor into the garden, trying to flee.

He called out to her retreating figure, "You can't escape! That drink you just had was laced with an aphrodisiac. It won’t be long before you feel desperate like a starving wolf, seeking any man to satisfy your urges. I suggest you stay and keep me company instead, haha..."
