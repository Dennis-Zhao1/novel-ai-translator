"Don't mess around!" 

As the candlelight flickered and extinguished, the room was immediately engulfed in pitch-black darkness. Nangong Nuoer took a moment to steady her breath, which had become a bit ragged due to the earlier tension. She was surprised he had let her off so easily; after all, he was notoriously difficult to deal with.

In the dark, he noticed her eyes seemed even brighter, like luminous pearls shining in the night, making it hard to look away. He knew she was glaring at him and couldn’t help but chuckle softly, "If you don't want to sleep, we can continue where we left off."

"Shameless!" Nangong Nuoer shot him a furious glare before turning her body away, not wanting to face this detestable man who made her so angry she felt like she could stab him.

"If you keep calling me shameless, I might just take that as an invitation to do something truly shameless to you." Watching her indignantly turn her back, Helian Yichen slowly moved closer, his bare chest nearly pressing against her back. He leaned in close, his lips brushing against her ear as he whispered in a low, teasing tone, his breath warm and intimate.

"You..." Nangong Nuoer was well aware of his mischievous nature; if he said it, he would certainly follow through. To avoid falling into his bizarre trap, she decided it was best to keep her mouth shut, lest she say something she would regret. But did he really need to be that close? He seemed completely at ease, while she felt utterly embarrassed.

"What’s wrong? Did your tongue get bitten off by a cat? Why are you suddenly quiet?!" Seeing her fall silent, Helian Yichen felt a wave of boredom wash over him. However, he noticed her body stiffen as he drew nearer, which sparked a mischievous thought. He reached out, gently massaging her shoulders, "You’re so tense. If you keep sleeping like this, you’ll wake up feeling all blocked up. Relax a bit; your foot is injured, so I won’t touch it for now."

"If you could just move a little farther away, I think I’d sleep a lot better." His hands were large, warm, and sturdy, kneading her shoulders with just the right amount of pressure, slowly easing her tense muscles. A flicker of something unusual passed through Nangong Nuoer’s eyes.

"That’s not happening. You’re my woman, and of course, I need to be by your side. How does that feel? Comfortable?"
