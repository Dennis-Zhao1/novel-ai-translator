**An Empty Relationship! 2**

She was well aware that becoming his concubine was a thousand times against his will, especially since the one he truly loved was his sister, Nanguang Nuo'er.

"So, you mean for me to accept my fate?" Her cold laugh dripped with disdain.

"My lord, please don't be angry. That's not what I meant. It's just, now that I've become your concubine, even if you can't accept me right now, we're still going to have to live together. If Third Miss finds out that we're not getting along, I can only imagine what she would say," Ziyun spoke timidly.

"Don't mention her in front of me." His temper was already flaring, and hearing her bring up Nanguang Nuo'er pushed him over the edge. He slammed his hand down hard on the table, causing the wine cups to tremble dangerously.

"Yes, my lord." Ziyun flinched at his sudden outburst, her face going pale, and she fell silent.

"Hmph." Seeing her frightened expression didn’t stir any sympathy in him; instead, it only annoyed him further. He glanced disdainfully at the shaking wine cups, and despite her pitiful demeanor, a flicker of reluctance crossed his mind. He lifted a cup and downed the wine in one go.

"Thank you, my lord." Ziyun's face brightened with a smile at the sight of him drinking, and she quickly followed suit, finishing her own cup.

"I’ve had my drink; don’t bother me anymore. I want to sleep. You know how to leave now, right?" Nanguang Xuduan tossed the empty cup aside and walked toward the large bed.

"Ziyun will help my lord to bed." Ziyun stepped in front of him and reached out to help him out of his outer robe. He made no objection, allowing her to assist him.

Seeing he didn’t stop her, Ziyun's smile grew wider. As she removed his robe, she noticed the key tied to his belt. Just as she reached for it, his large hand came down and swatted hers away.

"Who told you to touch my key?" Nanguang Xuduan glared at her with fierce eyes.

"My lord, what is this key? Why are you so protective of it?" Ziyun's hand was red from his forceful swipe, but she remained unfazed, maintaining her curious demeanor.

"What does it matter to you? You're nothing but a lowly concubine. Stay out of my affairs, or you’ll regret it."
