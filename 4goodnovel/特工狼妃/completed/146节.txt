**Chapter 2: You Demon!**

The man, with an air of cold charm, smirked as he looked at her. 

"I... fine, I'll take the blame. But you said that as long as the prince discovered she had eaten the black jade ointment, he wouldn't pay her any mind. So how do you explain what happened today? He went into her room during the day and didn't come out until the middle of the night. You can't seriously believe they were just chatting all night, can you?" The woman's voice grew more agitated with each word, her jealousy sharpening to a deadly edge, as if she longed to tear Nanko Nuo'er to pieces.

"Maybe he still finds her intriguing. You know better than I do what kind of person he is. But he came this time under the emperor's orders to crack down on smuggling. I doubt he would be foolish enough to bring her back to the palace. He's a smart man; he knows how to handle risky situations." The masked man spoke with a firm conviction.

"No, you don't understand. The prince doesn't easily give his heart. The fact that he's gone back to her means he really likes that wretch. I absolutely cannot allow him to bring that wretch back to the palace. You need to find a way to get rid of her for me!" The woman spoke with a hint of arrogance, demanding his assistance.

"No. I've already done everything I can for you. Beyond that, I won't harm her, nor will I allow anyone else to." The man's eyes suddenly turned icy, as if a chill had settled in the air around them.

"Hmph, don't forget who was the one that tipped you off about the prince's ambush. Are you really thinking of pulling back now? I've shared the secrets you wanted, but you still haven't completed what I asked of you. Aren't you afraid I'll expose your true identity?!" Anger flared in the woman’s eyes as she raised her voice.

"You think you're the only one with leverage? Let me remind you, you better not overreach. Otherwise, if the secret of your leaking court information comes to light, do you think the emperor would spare your family?!" The masked man's figure shifted suddenly, closing the distance between them, his cold gaze glinting with a terrifying light that sent shivers down her spine.

"You... you dare threaten me?!" The woman’s bright eyes widened in disbelief. This damn man hadn’t done a single thing she asked, and now he had the audacity to threaten her?
