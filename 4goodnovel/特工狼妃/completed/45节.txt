**Shameless Man! 3**

A deep, hearty laugh erupted from him as if he had stumbled upon a rare treasure. He had a feeling that with this woman by his side, his days would never be dull again. Coming here this time felt like striking gold.

“Boring.” Seeing him laugh so boastfully, Nango Noer coolly spat out just two words. If he wanted to marry someone, he should go find another woman. She had no interest in such matters; in her mind, there was no so-called virginity complex.

She was an agent, always prepared to sacrifice herself at any moment. Even if he were the best man in the world, it wouldn’t make much difference in her heart. Besides, she didn’t know when she would leave this world, so in the end, everything might just be in vain.

Upon hearing that Nango Noer was injured, aside from not alarming the matriarch, the rest of the Nango family rushed in. This included her sharp-tongued second aunt, her second sister, who harbored inexplicable hostility towards her, and her elder brother, who had strange feelings for her. However, her second uncle, who always hid in his own courtyard, had yet to make an appearance.

“Little sister, I heard from the servants that you were hurt. How did you end up injured?” Nango Xudan had just stepped into the room and eagerly began to inquire about her injury, a worried look plastered across his face.

“Brother, there’s no need to worry. I just accidentally fell while jogging today. Thankfully, I happened to run into Young Master Helian, who carried me here,” Nango Noer casually fabricated a small lie, leaving out the fact that it was Helian Yichen who had injured her.

Upon hearing her words, Helian Yichen's lips curled up slightly. He realized this woman was no simple character; she could lie without even batting an eye.

“Is that so? Your Highness, thank you for discovering that my little sister was hurt in time. But this is your room; my sister's room is just in the courtyard nearby. It wouldn’t be proper to disturb you. I’ll take her back now,” Nango Xudan replied, his expression darkening when he learned that Helian Yichen had carried her here. His little sister was still an untouched flower; how could she allow a man to bring her into his room? If this got out, where would she put her face?
