**We Will Meet Again!**

On a brightly lit dock, workers were bustling about, tirelessly transporting a sizable shipment of goods. At the center of the commotion stood He Lian Ting, the leader of the Fengshui Gang, flanked by four loyal aides. His presence was commanding, radiating an arrogance that suggested he ruled the scene. As he arrived, a man responsible for overseeing the cargo stepped forward and leaned in to whisper a few words in his ear. He Lian Ting appeared pleased with the report, nodding lightly before striding toward the rows of crates stacked on the dock. The man quickly moved to open one of the crates for him to inspect.

Just as He Lian Ting reached into the crate to check its contents, a sharp flash of light shot from his palm, zipping toward a large tree not far off. In the blink of an eye, he leaped into action, his figure soaring like a shooting star, his right hand reaching for his waist to draw a flexible sword, aimed straight at the thick canopy of the tree.

The sudden movement sent the crowd into a frenzy. Two of his aides dashed after him, while the other two remained behind to calm the startled workers. 

Almost simultaneously, figures hidden in the shadows emerged, surrounding the tree where He Lian Ting had directed his attack.

“Who are you? Sneaking around here like a thief—are you trying to rob this shipment?” He Lian Ting floated down gracefully to the other side of the tree, his fingers lightly tapping the blade of his sword. His long, elegant fingers danced across the weapon, producing a crisp sound that echoed in the quiet night air. His voice was low and deep, his beautiful eyes carrying a hint of cruelty.

“It doesn’t matter who I am. I just want to know what your Fengshui Gang is really up to. Are you dealing in antiques and jade? Or are you hiding something illicit behind that facade?” A tall figure clad in black, his face concealed, perched on a branch opposite He Lian Ting. With narrowed, sharp eyes, he scrutinized the elegant hand that now glimmered in the moonlight, each finger resembling a piece of finely crafted jade.

“So, you’re here to investigate. Let me be clear: the Fengshui Gang engages in legitimate business. If you have doubts, feel free to take a look for yourself. Just remember, if there’s nothing wrong with this shipment, I expect an explanation from you.” He Lian Ting noticed the stranger's gaze lingering on his hand and, far from being offended, he boldly displayed it, inviting the scrutiny. 

The tension in the air was palpable, a silent challenge hanging between them.
