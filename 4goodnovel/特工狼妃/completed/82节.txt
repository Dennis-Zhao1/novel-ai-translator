"You cold-blooded, heartless woman!" 

"I don’t want to say anything more, so please stop asking. I’ve already treated your wound. Just take some time to rest, and I believe that with your resilience, you'll recover quickly," Nango Nuoer said decisively, lying back down in her spot to rest.

"Fine, if you don't want to talk, I won't push you. Your skills in applying medicine and bandaging are quite impressive. Have you studied medicine?" Helian Yichen asked casually, glancing down at the neatly bandaged chest she had tended to.

"Yeah, I learned some emergency techniques for treating wounds," she replied matter-of-factly. In their line of work, it was essential to have some medical knowledge; otherwise, one would be clueless about how they met their end.

"Your movements are very practiced. Are you doing this for others or for yourself?" That night, although he had been a bit intoxicated by desire, he faintly remembered noticing several faint scars on her body. His silence didn’t mean he hadn’t noticed.

"This is the first time I’m treating someone else," she said flatly. As a special operative, her job was to kill, not to save. The only person she had saved was herself.

"I'm truly honored. You must have endured a lot in the past." Helian Yichen couldn't help but wrap his arm around her shoulder, pulling her closer. Just the thought of someone hurting her made him want to tear them apart.

"I can endure." If she couldn't tolerate the hardships, she would have been eliminated long ago. Nango Nuoer's tone was calm, but her eyes betrayed a tumult of emotions as memories surfaced. No one could imagine the struggles they had gone through without having experienced them firsthand.

"I don’t know what you’ve been through, but I promise, no one will ever hurt you again." Knowing she had suffered so much made his heart ache slightly. He felt a sudden urge to protect this woman, even if she was cold and reluctant to get close to others. He just wanted to warm her heart.

"How long is the validity of your promise?" Nango Nuoer let herself lean against him, a sardonic smile curling her lips as she recalled the incident with the celestial music. If he knew she intended to help Xianle retrieve their national treasure, the fairy zither, would he still say such things? He would probably wish he could kill her instead.
