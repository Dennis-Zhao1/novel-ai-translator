**Disfigured! 1**

Good news travels slowly, but bad news spreads like wildfire. The story of Nan Gong Nuo'er and Helian Yichen's fight, which ended with injuries, quickly reached the ears of the Second Madam. After such a significant incident, Second Madam Haoyue Liansi rushed over under the guise of concern, but in reality, she was just eager to witness the drama. The last time, for reasons unknown, they had parted ways, and now they were back together, only to end up in a fierce confrontation. It seemed that this time, things really did not bode well for them.

As Haoyue Liansi approached the door, she was stopped by Qin Tian, who barred her entry.

“Qin Tian, I am Nuo'er’s second mother. She’s injured—can’t I at least check on her?” Being blocked at the door, Haoyue Liansi recognized that he was the prince's favored subordinate. Not wanting to offend him, she forced a polite tone.

“Second Madam, I’m sorry, but the prince has given strict instructions. Unless he says otherwise, no one is allowed to disturb the Third Miss's rest. I’m just following orders; I hope you can choose another time to visit,” Qin Tian said apologetically.

“Is Nuo'er seriously injured? I heard a doctor was just here—what did he say?” Since she couldn’t go in, asking for information seemed reasonable. Haoyue Liansi managed to squeeze a semblance of concern onto her face as she pressed for details.

“I’m sorry, but I can’t share any information about the Third Miss without the prince's orders,” Qin Tian replied, his lips sealed tighter than a clam. Getting any news from him felt like a pipe dream.

“Well then, I won’t press you,” Haoyue Liansi said, turning her gaze to the worried expression of Xiaoxiao, who stood nearby. She shot Qin Tian a glance filled with discontent before commanding Xiaoxiao, “Xiaoxiao, I have something for you to do. Come with me.”

“Second Madam, I’m sorry, but I must stay here to watch over the Third Miss. If you need something done, please ask another servant,” Xiaoxiao replied, determination in her voice. She wasn’t leaving; she needed to stay put.

“You little brat, are there not enough people here? Are you defying my orders?” Haoyue Liansi’s mood soured instantly at Xiaoxiao’s disobedience, her face darkening as she glared at her.

“Second Madam, I’m not ignoring your command. I’m just worried about the Third Miss,” Xiaoxiao said, feeling the tension rise as she nervously tugged at her sleeve.
