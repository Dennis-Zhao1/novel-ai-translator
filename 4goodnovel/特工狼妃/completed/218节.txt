**Chapter 3: Please Spare Me, Young Master!**

“No way. This is an order. You must stay here and watch over Nuo’er. If anything happens to her, I will hold you responsible.” Helian Yichen’s tone was unyielding. He was deeply concerned about leaving her alone, especially given the gravity of the situation. He stole a glance at Nangong Nuo’er, who appeared to still be sleeping peacefully.

“Master, it’s dangerous for you to go alone,” Qin Tian said, worry etched on his face.

“Qin Tian!” Helian Yichen didn’t say much, but he softly called his name, a warning in his voice.

“Yes, I will stay,” Qin Tian replied reluctantly. He recognized the ominous tone; he had been by Helian Yichen’s side long enough to know that this was a precursor to anger, and he had no choice but to comply.

In her hazy state, Nangong Nuo’er seemed to hear murmurs about some operation, something about a dock, before sensing that people were leaving. The familiar presence surrounding her gradually faded away. She struggled to awaken, but fatigue pulled her back into the depths of slumber.

Time passed, and suddenly, a commotion outside broke the quiet, their voices not loud but enough to rouse her from her dreams.

“Who dares disturb my sweet dreams? Are you looking for trouble?!” Nangong Nuo’er’s temper flared as she woke up. Blinking her eyes open, she felt a pang of disappointment when she didn’t see him. She had hoped he would be by her side. The room was dim, with no lights on, yet a soft, multi-colored glow illuminated the space, allowing her to see the surroundings clearly. 

Her eyes fell on a vase of flowers on the table, and she was taken aback. When had he brought those in? She hadn’t noticed them during dinner, and the vibrant blooms from the morning now appeared slightly wilted. Was it because of her poor health?

“Let me in! I need to see her!” A frantic voice broke through her thoughts. It sounded like Nangong Xudan. What was he doing here at this hour? She quickly threw on a robe and made her way to the door.

“Master, I’m sorry, but the Third Miss is already asleep. The Prince has instructed that no one is to disturb her,” Qin Tian stood in front of Nangong Xudan, blocking his entry.
