How could she hold on? 

A hint of distress flashed across Nangong Yulou's face as she spoke. 

“Alright, I promise you. I won't even mention Xiao Xiao, is that good enough?” Xiao Qi nodded seriously, reassuring her. 

“Very well. Since you’re so loyal to your master, I’ll give you some medicinal powder to try,” Nangong Yulou said, giving his shoulder a gentle pat. A strange glimmer flickered in her deep-set eyes. 

Nangong Nuo'er had a strong recovery ability; the wooden board on her foot should be coming off soon. With a bit more physical therapy, she wouldn’t need crutches for long, and she hardly needed to sit in a wheelchair anymore.

“Third Miss, you seem to have walked in the courtyard for quite a while now. Why not sit down and rest for a bit? Xiao Xiao has already prepared the medicine for me to bring to you,” Xiao Qi said, his brow furrowing with concern. Nuo'er had been out there for two hours, and while she didn’t feel tired, he worried about her strength.

“I can’t be lazy with this exercise! I need to be diligent so my foot can heal faster,” Nangong Nuo'er declared, determined. As soon as her injury was fully healed, she planned to head into the palace and find that damned fairy zither, then return to the twenty-first century. She had had enough of this place—she didn’t want to stay in this desolate, nothing-having hellhole any longer.

“Third Miss, do you really think this will be effective?” Xiao Qi asked, watching her drag her injured foot back and forth. He had never seen someone with an injured foot refusing to rest comfortably indoors, choosing instead to endure this agony outside. He stepped forward to assist the already tired Nuo'er towards the stone table.

“Of course! Or do you think I’m just bored out of my mind, looking for trouble?!” Nuo'er retorted as she sat on the stone bench, pulling out a handkerchief to wipe the sweat from her forehead.

“Oh, Third Miss, hurry and drink this bowl of medicine while it’s still warm; otherwise, it’ll cool down and lose its effectiveness,” Xiao Qi said, presenting the bowl to her.

“Xiao Qi, are you particularly free today? How come you have time to bring me medicine?” Nuo'er asked casually, surprised. Usually, he was busy at this hour. Yet, she held no suspicions. From her observations over the past few days, both Xiao Xiao and Xiao Qi seemed genuinely loyal to her. She lifted the bowl and drank it all in one go.

The sun hung high above the courtyard, casting its warm glow over the stone pathways and the small potted plants that adorned the edges. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, mingling with the earthy aroma of the freshly turned soil. As Nuo'er sat there, her heart raced with a mixture of hope and determination. Each step she took, despite the pain, brought her closer to freedom—the freedom to escape this life and return to her own time, where she could finally be the person she wanted to be. 

But for now, she had to focus on healing, on getting stronger. The journey ahead would not be easy, but she was ready—ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
