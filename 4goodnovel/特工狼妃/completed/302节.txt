**Are You Telling the Truth? 2**

“Hmm? Not talking, huh? Well, don’t blame me when my baseball bat has no mercy. Have you ever seen what brain matter looks like? O(∩_∩)O~” The young man holding the baseball laughed as he turned to his friends beside him.

“I haven’t seen it, but I heard it’s like soft tofu—white and slippery. \(^o^)/~”

“Me neither! I’m curious too! Hey, big brother, why don’t you just smash his head and see if his brain flows out like fragrant tofu pudding? (*^__^*) Hehe…”

“…”

Listening to them taunt the man into smashing his own head, Li Ming’s face turned a mixture of green and pale, and even his fingers trembled in fear. T^T

“Alright, since everyone wants to see some brain matter, I can’t let you down! Just watch me smash his head open with one swing.” The man called “Big Brother” rubbed his hands together and raised the baseball bat, pointing it at Li Ming’s head. “Don’t say I’m not giving you a chance. I’ll ask you one more time—are you going to talk or not?”

“I... do you dare to hit me? If you hurt me, you’ll end up in jail. -_-|||” In this law-abiding society, Li Ming found it hard to believe that the man would actually smash his head open. He gritted his teeth and braced himself.

“He actually thinks I wouldn’t dare smash his head! Isn’t that hilarious? O(∩_∩)O Haha~” Big Brother erupted into laughter as if he had just heard the greatest joke in the world.

“Are you stupid or something? Our boss has killed before. Do you really think he wouldn’t dare to smash your head? \(^o^)/~” The guy beside him chuckled, clearly amused. Did Li Ming really think they were just trying to scare him? How naïve!

“You... you’ve killed someone? Aren’t you afraid I’ll report you?” The moment Li Ming heard that, his face went even paler.

“Pfft, we often hang out at the precinct for tea. We know the officers inside really well! But once we take care of you, do you think you’ll get the chance to call for help?” The man sneered, a cold glint in his eyes.

“You guys... -_-#” He wanted to escape, but there were people blocking him on all sides. It seemed like his chances of survival tonight were slim.

“My time is precious, you know. Since you don’t want to cooperate, just bear with it. It might hurt a bit. O(∩_∩)O~” Big Brother waved the baseball bat as if he were just giving a friendly reminder. But just as Li Ming was caught off guard, he suddenly swung the bat down toward Li Ming’s head, the air slicing past with an ominous whoosh…

“Wait! Don’t hit me! I’ll talk! I’ll talk! T^T” As he saw the bat coming down, fear gripped Li Ming, and he nearly lost his mind. He shouted desperately.

“(⊙o⊙) Oh! You’re willing to talk now? You could’ve said so earlier! Look at you, drenched in cold sweat! Let me help you wipe that off.” The bat halted mid-air as soon as Li Ming spoke. Big Brother exchanged glances with his friends, and their faces transformed into warm smiles. They even offered a tissue to help wipe away the cold sweat streaming down Li Ming’s face.

Li Ming had genuinely thought they were just trying to scare him, but when the bat actually came down, he realized he had to prioritize his life. Apologies to Senior Ling Zhiruo, he thought, hoping she could forgive him for what he was about to do. T^T
