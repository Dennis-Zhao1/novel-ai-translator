**Let Me Stay and Accompany You! 3**

“No, I don’t want to… Please, just go. I’m begging you, just leave!” Nangong Nuoer’s voice was choked with desperation. She couldn’t bear to let him see her in such a vulnerable state. She pounded her fists against him, but when he refused to let go, she found herself weakly leaning against him.

“No, I won’t leave. Nuoer, let me help you. I won’t let anything happen to you.” He Lian Yichen held her tightly, feeling her body tremble against him. He knew she was struggling with the cravings raging inside her. Despite her usual strong self-control, he couldn’t shake the worry gnawing at him.

“Why do you care? Why can’t you just leave me alone?!” Nangong Nuoer gripped his arm, her situation better than when she first succumbed to her addiction, but the withdrawal was still unbearable. It felt as if she were being scorched in flames while frozen in ice. This kind of suffering was beyond what most could withstand. Yet, she believed if she could just hold on a little longer, she would be able to overcome it. She would rather endure the pain alone than let him see her in such agony. But despite his insistence on staying, a part of her felt relieved. Why was that?

“Nuoer, because you are mine, and I can’t just ignore you. You’ve already fought this battle for so long; soon it will pass. If it gets too hard, just bite me. As long as you don’t hurt yourself, that’s what matters.” 

He Lian Yichen pressed her cold body against his, as if trying to transfer his warmth to her. His voice was hoarse, barely audible, and seeing her in such distress felt like a knife twisting in his heart. His mind raced back to that dreadful night when her addiction had tortured her endlessly, and he had said such cruel things. She must hate him for it. No matter what he did, it would never be enough to make up for his past mistakes; this was all his fault.

“Ah… ugh…” She felt so much pain, wanting to scream and shout, but she couldn’t let herself go mad in front of him. Instead, she bit down on her lip, using the pain to fight against the turmoil and desire churning within her.

“Nuoer, don’t hurt yourself. Just bite my hand.” She clenched her jaw, biting her lower lip so hard she was on the verge of drawing blood. He Lian Yichen quickly brought his wrist to her lips, offering it for her to bite.

In the dim light of the room, the tension hung thick in the air, a silent battle between addiction and the warmth of companionship. The flickering shadows danced around them, creating a stark contrast to the turmoil within. He Lian Yichen could feel the weight of her struggle resting heavily on both their shoulders, but he refused to let her shoulder it alone. The resolve in his heart grew stronger; he would help her through this, no matter the cost.
