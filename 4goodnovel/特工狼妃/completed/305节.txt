**Final Chapter! 13**

"Can't you say anything without a jab?" What should have been a warm moment turned into an insult about his lack of ambition. Heryan Yichen's expression darkened immediately.

"That's just how I speak. If you don't like it, you can choose not to listen. I don't recall forcing you to, right?" She shot him a cold glance, unfazed by his mood.

"Forget it. Getting mad at you is like punishing myself," he sighed. After spending so much time with her, he had long since understood her personality. If he let her antics get to him, he’d be a complete fool.

"Since you have nothing to say, shouldn’t you discuss Ziyan's situation with General Xing?" Now that things had settled down, it was time to find a resolution for Ziyan.

"You seem awfully eager for someone else's affairs." Though he said this, he still headed to find General Xing.

"Miss San, do you think Ziyan will be okay?" Watching Heryan Yichen walk away to find the general, Xiao Xiao and Xiao Qi felt anxious.

"Although General Xing is a valiant general with countless achievements, he has already retired. Do you really think a retired general would dismiss the prince's authority?" Heryan Yichen was favored by the Emperor, and he had just made a significant contribution. If she were General Xing, she wouldn’t be foolish enough to make an enemy of Heryan Yichen.

"That’s true. After all, the prince is someone the Emperor values. General Xing would definitely show him some respect. That means Ziyan should be fine; she’ll be overjoyed!" Xiao Qi said cheerfully.

"Don't celebrate too soon. Ziyan is still General Xing’s concubine. He might not let her go that easily. But regardless of whether he agrees or not, I intend to keep Ziyan. She’s already mine, and I won’t allow her to return to him," Nangong Nuoer said, her indifferent face revealing a cold glimmer in her eyes.

"I support Miss San in keeping Ziyan. She risked becoming the eldest young master’s concubine just to help Miss San; her loyalty is truly commendable." Xiao Xiao gently touched the scar on her face, her eyes betraying a hint of sorrow.

"Xiao Xiao, the person who disfigured you has already faced their karma. You can’t keep looking like you're on the verge of death, or I’ll get angry." A significant amount of time had passed, and Nangong Nuoer didn't want to see that sorrowful expression on her face any longer. She purposefully put on a stern face.

"Don't be sad, Xiao Xiao. If you let your bangs down, no one will even notice your scar," Xiao Qi chimed in, trying to cheer her up.

"Yes, Miss San, don’t worry. Actually, my scar has faded quite a bit. I won’t let it keep me down anymore." She agreed with Miss San; the scar was merely a mark left by Madam Nangong, but what she truly lost was the eldest young master, whom she had always cherished, and the Nangong Manor. That price was far too steep. Miss San's actions for her made her feel both cherished and resolute in her decision to follow her for life.
