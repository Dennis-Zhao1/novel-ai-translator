**Are Women Destined to Be Inferior to Men? 1**

"Third Miss is truly impressive! She managed to quit that devilish substance all on her own. You're the first person in our dynasty to successfully quit Black Feather Ointment. If the world knew, they would surely admire you."

"Honestly, it's not something to be admired. Anyone can quit if they have strong enough willpower," Nangong Nuo'er shrugged, dismissing the idea. "Those who haven't quit just didn’t stick with it."

"Of course, it’s admirable! Just your unwavering determination alone is something many people should learn from," Xiaoxiao chimed in enthusiastically.

"What’s worthy of admiration?" A steady set of footsteps approached from outside, followed by a warm, male voice that filled the room with a hint of playfulness.

"Third Miss, the Prince has arrived. I’ll step out for now." Xiaoxiao recognized it was Helian Yichen and knew they had important matters to discuss. After serving tea, she exited the room.

"Nuo'er, you seem to be in good spirits today. Would you like to join me for a little outing?" Helian Yichen looked at her flushed cheeks, a cheerful smile spreading across his face.

"An outing? Prince, you really have too much free time," she said, raising an eyebrow, skeptical about whether he was here for work or leisure.

"Mixing work with play is essential. You spend all your time here; don’t you get bored? Let me take you out to clear your mind. It’ll be good for your health. Besides, don’t you want to savor this place a bit more before heading to the capital?"

He stepped closer, gently taking her hand and kissing it lightly, his smile warm.

"Before heading to the capital? Have you found evidence regarding the smuggling operations of the Fengshui Gang?" Nangong Nuo'er asked, surprise evident in her gaze.

"I’m just hoping to relax with you right now, not discuss official matters," Helian Yichen raised an eyebrow at her perceptiveness.

"But I’m more interested in official matters," she retorted, not shy about her curiosity.

"It’s a waste of your talents to be a woman." He casually implied that if she were a man, the court would gain another capable talent.

"So what if I’m a woman? Does that mean I’m destined to be inferior to men?" Nangong Nuo'er scoffed, sensing his condescending tone.

"That’s not what I meant. I just believe women have a harder time achieving things than men do."

"Fine, say whatever you want. You came to invite me for an outing, right?"

"Yes. Are you interested in joining me?" His lips curved into a subtle, alluring smile.

"Why not? Let’s go." But she couldn’t shake the feeling that his invitation was more than just a simple outing.

"We’ll be going to a windy place, so put on this cloak," Helian Yichen said, thoughtfully draping a cloak over her shoulders.

"I don’t feel cold right now at all; I’ll be fine," Nangong Nuo'er frowned, a bit reluctant.

"Put it on. It’s not wise for your body to catch a chill," he insisted with an air that brooked no argument.

"If I get too hot, you can hold it for me," she conceded, too weary to argue further given his insistence.

As Helian Yichen stepped out the door, a dark shadow darted toward him like lightning, landing on his shoulder. The figure instinctively pulled back its neck upon seeing Nangong Nuo'er.
