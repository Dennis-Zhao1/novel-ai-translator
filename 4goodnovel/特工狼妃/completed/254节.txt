**Chapter 2: My Heart Aches for You!**

His deep, resonant voice seemed to reverberate within her heart, carrying an irresistible allure that both captivated and bewildered her. She stared at him with an icy expression, her eyes devoid of warmth, as he gently tilted her chin up. With a tender touch, he wiped the sweat from her forehead with a handkerchief.

“Is that so?” She couldn't shake off the skepticism in her gaze. Could he really find her no matter where she was? Nangong Nuo'er questioned him silently.

“If you don’t believe me, then you must be punished.” Recognizing the doubt in her eyes, his heart sank a little. He lifted her chin higher, a wave of assertive aggression washing over him as he captured her still-breathing lips with his own.

“Mm…” The sudden kiss caught Nangong Nuo'er off guard, her wide eyes locking onto the handsome face that had magnified in her vision. Her hands hung limply by her sides, neither pushing him away nor struggling against him. She simply stared, her heart, which had just settled, now rippling with newfound excitement.

“Close your eyes and enjoy when I kiss you.” After a brief moment, he pulled back, noticing that she still gazed at him with wide eyes. Helian Yicheng let out a low, rich chuckle that was both enchanting and deep. With a firm hand, he gently covered her eyes, enveloping her in his warm, masculine scent before leaning down to kiss her again. This time, his kiss was soft, like a feather gliding over her skin, igniting a tingling sensation deep within her heart.

“Faster…” His gentle kisses left her feeling dizzy, stirring a wild craving within her. Nangong Nuo'er wrapped her arms around his neck, no longer passive as she had been before; instead, she leaned into him, eagerly intertwining herself with him.

“Nuo'er.” Helian Yicheng hadn’t anticipated that his actions would elicit such a strong response from her. His heart raced as he drew her close, his arms tightening around her waist as if he wanted to fuse their bodies together. One hand cradled the back of her head, deepening the intimate closeness between them as their kisses grew more fervent.

After what felt like a torrential storm of passionate kisses, both of them were left breathless. Helian Yicheng rested his forehead against hers, their breaths mingling, chaotic and intertwined. They could no longer distinguish whose breath they were inhaling, and at this moment, it didn’t matter anymore.
