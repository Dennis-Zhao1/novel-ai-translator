What are they up to? 2

“What are they up to?” 

“Your master must have gone to the docks. I think I heard you all talking about some movements by Tuoba Tianye while I was sleeping. Did they all head to the docks?” Nango Nuo'er furrowed her brows and inquired.

“Third Miss, it’s getting late. You should head back and get some rest. If the prince finds out you haven’t rested well, he’ll blame it on me,” Qin Tianming said, firmly deciding against revealing any details regarding their activities.

“Okay, if you won't tell me, I’ll just go check out the docks myself,” Nango Nuo'er declared, turning to stride further into the house.

“What?!” Did she just say she’s going to the docks herself? As he watched her retreating figure, Qin Tianming suddenly questioned his hearing. At a time like this, she wanted to head to the docks? If the prince found out, he’d surely be in deep trouble.

As Qin Tianming began to panic, it wasn’t long before Nango Nuo'er re-emerged, changed into a set of casual clothes. In her hand, she held a whip—the one Tuoba Tianye had gifted her. Helian Yichen had found himself nearly tossing it out multiple times.

“Third Miss, you were just injured today; you can’t go out!” She should be resting comfortably in bed, yet seeing her dressed for action made Qin Tianming feel as if he might faint from distress.

“Don’t worry, I’ve had plenty of rest. I’m curious about what they’re really up to,” Nango Nuo'er stated confidently. After both Helian Yichen and Tuoba Tianye had shown up at Nango Manor, she’d sensed something was off. With nothing else to occupy her time, investigating the situation seemed intriguing. Besides, she wasn’t one to owe favors, so if she could help, she would.

“Third Miss, you really shouldn’t go. There could be a fight breaking out at the docks, and it could be dangerous,” Qin Tianming said, his face contorted in worry. If she insisted on going, he would be the one facing the prince's wrath.

“I’ve never been afraid of danger. Qin Tian, if you want to come along, stop talking and follow me,” Nango Nuo'er replied decisively, wrapping the whip around her waist and heading toward the back door of the manor.

Realizing he could no longer stop her, Qin Tianming resigned himself to following her, silently vowing to protect her. He trailed behind her, tilting his head to the sky and letting out a sharp whistle.
