**The Man Who Sneaks Into the Bedroom! 2**

“Hey, I heard our third miss, Nora, is back!” At that moment, a sharp voice belonging to a middle-aged woman rang out from outside the door, accompanied by the light sound of jingling jewelry that followed her light footsteps.

As soon as Xiaoxiao heard her voice, her expression changed instantly.

“Xiaoxiao, who is she?” Noticing the change in Xiaoxiao’s expression, Nora Nangong couldn’t help but frown. Just hearing the woman’s sharp voice gave her an uncomfortable vibe, and even before she arrived, a strong scent of gold and silver wafted through the air.

“Third Miss, she’s the second wife of the Nangong Manor, the mother of the eldest son and the second daughter, Lian Si.” Xiaoxiao lowered her voice to explain.

“Oh, so it’s the second mother.” In other words, this was Nora Nangong’s stepmother. She wondered if this woman was on the same level as the wicked stepmother from Snow White. A strange smile crept onto Nora’s lips as she eagerly awaited her arrival. She never expected that in this ancient setting, she would encounter such a melodrama; however, a little excitement was just what her monotonous life needed.

“Yo, Nora, you’re back! You don’t know how much your second mother has missed you!” Lian Si, adorned with so much gold that she jingled with every step, approached with an overly enthusiastic demeanor. Though she was the second wife of the Nangong Manor, her excessive jewelry did nothing to lend her an air of elegance. As soon as she saw Nora, she rushed forward to take her hands, showering her with exaggerated warmth.

“Sorry to have worried you!” Nora subtly pulled her hand away, unable to bear her overwhelming enthusiasm. Her tone was somewhat cold.

“Nora, poor child! You must have suffered a lot while you were away. It’s not just me, your second mother, who was worried about you; even your elder brother has been concerned. Though he tells others he’s out doing business, I know he’s just using that as an excuse to look for you. If he knew you were back home, he would rush back to see you without a second thought.”

For a moment, the smile on Lian Si’s face stiffened when Nora withdrew her hand, but she quickly regained her composure. It took skill to maintain a cheerful demeanor when faced with such indifference.

“If my brother comes back, please tell him I’m sorry,” Nora said lightly, despite the seemingly caring expression plastered across Lian Si’s face.
