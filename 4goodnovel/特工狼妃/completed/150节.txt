She’s arrived, and the show is about to begin!

“Third Miss, what kind of weapon are you looking to buy here?!” Xiao Qi asked, his enthusiasm palpable. As a martial arts practitioner, he had a keen interest in weaponry.

“I want to buy a handgun!” Nangong Nuo’er’s sharp gaze swept across the various stalls. She casually replied to Xiao Qi’s question, fully aware that there were no handguns to be found here.

“A handgun?!” Xiao Qi’s brow furrowed in confusion. Was that a type of long gun you held in your hand? He pointed towards a nearby stall, asking, “Is it short or long?!”

“Of course it’s short.” Did he expect her to carry a long gun around?! Nangong Nuo’er said distractedly.

“Short gun? Well, it seems there’s something over there.” Xiao Qi’s eyes lit up as he excitedly pointed to a stall selling both long and short spears.

“Oh.” She had only mentioned it casually, yet there actually was something? Nangong Nuo’er followed his gesture, and her lips twitched slightly when she saw the display of various long and short spears. “Xiao Qi, I meant a handgun, not these spears.” As she thought, how could there possibly be handguns in ancient times? It turned out he was referring to those ancient long spears.

“A handgun is just a type of gun you hold in your hand, right?!” Xiao Qi questioned, perplexed. What else could there be?

“Definitely not! The type you’re talking about wouldn’t easily kill someone, but the handgun I’m talking about can take someone down from a distance. Just like this,” Nangong Nuo’er said, demonstrating by gesturing at his heart.

“Seriously? Is it really that powerful?” Xiao Qi’s eyes widened in awe, his curiosity piqued. “What kind of weapon is it?!”

“It’s a handgun, but that kind of weapon only exists in places I’ve been to. There’s none available in this area; you’re out of luck.” Nangong Nuo’er coolly doused his enthusiasm with a bucket of cold water. She regretted not bringing a handgun with her that night. Anyone who dared to offend her would receive a bullet as a parting gift. Would their ancient martial arts be more impressive, or would her advanced technology prevail? She mused with a hint of regret.

“That’s such a shame! Third Miss, where is this place you’re talking about? It sounds like a treasure trove of novelty items that we don’t have here. I really want to see it!” Xiao Qiao asked, her curiosity evident.
