**Chapter 3: Seizing Her Heart**

"Big Brother, wake up! She’s not yours to claim. Just give up already. Her foot injury has healed, and it won’t be long before the prince takes her back to the palace. I suggest you find someone else to focus on. That girl from earlier, what was her name? Zi Yan? She’s quite pretty. Need I say more?" Nanjing Qianer couldn't hold back her laughter, the sound ringing through the room.

"Nanjing Qianer, let me tell you, I won’t let her leave here. There’s no way I’ll allow her to marry the prince. Just wait and see!" Nanjing Xuduan retorted fiercely, slamming his sleeve as he stormed out.

After dinner, Nanjing Nuoer went to check on Grandma Nanjing, who was not in good health and spent her days resting in her courtyard. Nanjing Nuoer hadn’t told her about her injury, not wanting to worry her.

Once she finished her visit, she returned to her own room. Her cravings for the black jade ointment were fading. What had once been daily urges had stretched to several days between episodes. During those moments, she no longer needed to bind herself with rough ropes; the discomfort was bearable. She felt confident that soon, she would be completely free from her addiction.

As night fell, she lay down, ready to sleep, when she suddenly felt a dull ache in her thigh.

"It must be from overexerting myself today," Nanjing Nuoer thought, wincing as she reached down to massage the sore spot. Just as she was about to get up to find some ointment, she heard light footsteps outside her door—so soft they seemed to barely touch the ground. But her ears caught them easily; it wasn’t Xiaoxiao or Xiao Qi, nor was it Zi Yan. It was him—a man she wasn’t sure if she wanted to see or not.

"Nuoer, are you still awake?!" As expected, a charming, deep voice accompanied a familiar figure who pushed the door open and stepped inside. With him came a subtle floral fragrance that filled the air.

"Whether I’m awake or asleep is none of your business!" Nanjing Nuoer frowned as she watched him enter her room as if it were his own. Was his hand broken? Did he not understand the basic courtesy of knocking? Her gaze fell on the bouquet he held—a peculiar arrangement that seemed to emit a faint, colorful glow under the flickering candlelight. Mesmerized by its soft luminescence, she couldn’t help but wonder about its origin.
