**"No One Can Hurt You!"**

He rushed over, only to find Haoyue Liansi smiling triumphantly at Xiaoxiao, her hand gripping a golden hairpin that was dripping with blood. Xiaoxiao's face was pale as she pressed her hand against her right cheek.

"I..." Xiaoxiao tried to say something, but the words choked in her throat, and she was unable to express herself. In the end, she said nothing and turned to dash toward her room.

"Xiaoxiao, what’s wrong?!" Seeing her sudden departure, Xiao Qi didn't care about Haoyue Liansi anymore and hurried after her.

"Hmph, let’s see if you still dare to underestimate me after this. Don’t think that just because she’s backing you up, you can act so recklessly." Watching their retreating figures, Haoyue Liansi took out a handkerchief from her pocket, leisurely wiping the blood from the hairpin before carelessly inserting it back into her hair.

At this moment, Nanguang Nuoer, who was deep in sleep, suddenly felt a wave of unease wash over her, as if something terrible was happening beyond her control. She couldn't help but furrow her brows, cold sweat trickling down her forehead.

"Nuoer, what’s wrong?!" Heliang Yicheng, sitting by her bedside, noticed her changed expression and the cold sweat on her forehead. Thinking she must be having a nightmare, he reached for a handkerchief, gently wiping the sweat away as he spoke in a low, magnetic voice, “Nuoer, don’t be afraid. I’m here; I’ll always be here with you.”

“Mmm… no… don’t…” Nanguang Nuoer was tossing and turning in her restless sleep. She dreamed of those close to her being hurt. She wanted to stop it; she wanted to protect them, but she felt utterly powerless, forced to watch as they were bullied and harmed. Anger surged within her, a desire to kill, but worry gripped her heart, causing it to ache painfully. In the midst of her struggle and murmurs, she felt a gentle hand caressing her face with concern. She instinctively reached out, grasping that sturdy hand tightly, pressing it against her cheek, unwilling to let it go.

“Nuoer.” As Heliang Yicheng watched her clutch his hand against her face, his heart was shaken in that instant. She had actually reached out to grab his hand. Such a thing, not even during their most intimate moments, would she ever do. Even now, lost in a dream, she had crossed that line.
