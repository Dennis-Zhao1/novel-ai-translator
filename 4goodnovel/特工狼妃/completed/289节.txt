He Actually Couldn't Bring Himself to Kill Him! 3

“Are you really going to kill me? I fell for you at first sight, and not only did you refuse to respond, but you also want to silence me? Do you really hate me that much? This is my first love.” Tuo Ba Tianye looked at him, his face twisting into a tragic expression.

“I don’t have time to play this ridiculous game with you.” Nangong Yulou's hand swept to his waist, and a soft sword, sharp enough to cut through iron, fell into his grasp, its point aimed straight at Tuo Ba Tianye. “I’ve given you a chance. You chose to come here and seek death. Don’t blame me.”

“I only accidentally took off your mask. There’s no need for you to draw your sword on me, but I must admit, you look even more charming wielding it. I think I like you even more now.” Tuo Ba Tianye squinted at him, his eyes filled with a mix of admiration and mischief.

“You damn rogue, you should just die!” Even at the brink of death, Tuo Ba's sweet talk only served to infuriate Nangong Yulou. His face flushed with anger, and he raised his sword to stab at him.

“It would be an honor to die at the hands of a beauty.” Tuo Ba Tianye narrowly dodged the thrust of Nangong’s sword, feeling the rush of air as it passed by.

“Then don’t dodge! Stand still and let me kill you with one strike!” Nangong Yulou sneered, the gleaming soft sword lunging forward again.

“Want to know if I have the guts? I don’t mind letting you test that.” 

“You lewd scoundrel, I’m going to chop you into pieces!” Nangong Yulou had never heard such vulgar words before, and his anger boiled over. He wanted nothing more than to dismember Tuo Ba Tianye, yet he failed to realize that his own words were the lines of a submissive character.

“Fine, I won’t play with you anymore. Let’s call it a night. I’ll say it again: stop while you still can.” Tuo Ba Tianye suddenly jumped back, flying several yards away.

“My affairs don’t concern you.” At this point, hiding the truth was futile. As Nangong Yulou watched Tuo Ba Tianye’s retreating figure, his instinct to pursue faltered, halting him in his tracks.

“A child who can’t be taught—this is quite troublesome. Since you’ve chosen the road of no return, then take care of yourself.” By the time those words reached him, Tuo Ba Tianye was already far away.

“Have you lost your mind today? He already saw through your identity, and you just let him go?” Nangong Yulou stood there, stunned for a moment. After retracting his sword, he knocked on his own head in disbelief. How could he have let him leave? Their skills were almost matched, and he had the sword on his side. He was not a match for him!

Why had his heart suddenly softened? He should have killed him to keep him quiet. Standing there, Nangong Yulou gazed at Tuo Ba Tianye’s departing back, his mind flashing back to the half-serious, half-joking confession that Tuo Ba had made about falling for him at first sight.

“Have I really lost my mind? Why would I think of such things? Tuo Ba Tianye, you better pray you don’t fall into my hands again, or I won’t let you go.” Next time, he promised himself he would kill him without hesitation. He was never one to show mercy. Next time, he would make it happen.

To create explosives capable of blowing up the dam, Nangong Nuoer spent the entire night in her room working tirelessly. Just when she finally perfected the explosive’s composition and was about to catch up on some much-needed sleep, she received a report from Xiao Xiao that Nangong Yulou had come to see her.
