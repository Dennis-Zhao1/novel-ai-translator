"Don't touch me!" 

“Your Highness, it’s true that Nuo’er is still quite young. She doesn’t really understand how to serve others properly. If you were to marry her, she might not be able to meet your needs. Why not consider our Qian’er instead? She's much more gentle and sensible, and she's excellent at serving.”

Hao Yue Lian Si was shamelessly promoting her own daughter in front of so many people. 

“Hmph!” Nangong Nuo’er, who had been quietly observing from the sidelines, couldn’t help but find it utterly amusing. What kind of mother tries to sell her daughter like this? It was clear she was eager to climb the social ladder by marrying into royalty. Unfortunately for her, it was obvious that this arrogant prince had no interest in her biological daughter at all. Her little scheme was destined to fail. Rumor had it that this second wife was born a maid; no wonder she spoke without any grace.

“Madam Nangong, does this prince need to consult you on whom he wishes to marry?” Nangong Nuo’er’s cold snort, though not very loud, was crystal clear in Helian Yichen’s ears. He cast a sidelong glance at her, catching a glimmer of schadenfreude in her expression. The corners of his lips twitched upward slightly, but it was only a fleeting moment before a mocking smile replaced it as he turned to Hao Yue Lian Si with a dark glare. The Nangong family was a well-respected household; how could this Madam Nangong be so utterly clueless?

“Oh dear, Your Highness, you really are quite the jokester. How could a humble woman like me dare to offer you advice? I just think our Qian’er is more suitable for you than Nuo’er. But if Your Highness wishes for Nuo’er, the unfortunate one, then I have no objections,” Hao Yue Lian Si quickly switched her tone, trying to appease the prince.

So, I’m now considered unfortunate, am I? This stepmother truly knows her role well, constantly belittling me in hopes that Helian Yichen will shift his attention to her daughter. Hmph, thinking back to my first day here when she pretended to be so warm and welcoming, it’s all so ironic. Truly, you can never know a person’s heart.

“I’ll tell you this—no matter who Nuo’er is, I’m determined to marry her. If anyone has objections, I suggest you step forward now,” Helian Yichen warned, his gaze turning cold as it swept over the gathering, his purple-hued eyes narrowing slightly. He had noticed the sarcastic expression on Nangong Nuo’er’s face and couldn't help but feel a flicker of amusement at her boldness. 

As the tension in the air thickened, everyone held their breath, unsure of what would happen next.
