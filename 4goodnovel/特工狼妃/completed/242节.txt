"Take off your clothes!" 

Even the dullest person could hear the sting in his words, yet Nangong Yulou’s expression remained largely unchanged.

"It seems I should go find the young master today. My apologies for bothering you," Tuo Batianye said, without a hint of regret, as if he had expected this outcome all along.

"No need to be polite," Nangong Yulou replied through gritted teeth, having been pestered by him for so long that her frustration was boiling just beneath the surface. However, she maintained her composure and responded with a civil tone.

After the sun dipped below the horizon, a new crescent moon once again appeared in the sky's path, as if it had an endless duty to fulfill.

As night fell, Nangong Nuoer lay quietly alone in her room, her mind racing with images of the scar she had seen on Xiaoxiao's face earlier that day. Remembering the dream she had, she felt utterly useless—unable to protect even those closest to her. She turned her head to gaze at the bouquet of flowers on her desk. The seven-colored lilies still emitted a delicate glow in the darkness, but they appeared far more withered than they had that day, seeming to lack vitality.

“Could it be that these flowers really have a spirit? When I'm feeling down, they droop sadly; but when I'm happy, they bloom so brilliantly. It's truly fascinating,” she pondered.

Seeing the flowers’ droopy demeanor, a faint smile crept onto Nangong Nuoer’s lips.

"Xiaoxiao has been so loyal to me. If I, as her master, remain indifferent, it just doesn’t feel right. Don't worry, Xiaoxiao, I will seek justice for you," she thought, her sharp eyes flashing with an enigmatic glimmer. She suddenly flipped out of bed, swiftly changing into a set of practical clothes. From her drawer, she pulled out a dagger and tucked it into her boot. She quietly approached the window, knowing that Qintian was stationed right outside the door. If she left through the entrance, he would surely notice, leaving her with no choice but to escape through the window.

As Nangong Nuoer climbed out of her dorm room, Qintian and Black Hawk stood vigil outside, completely unaware that the person they were meant to be guarding was no longer inside.

Nangong Nuoer made her way directly to Haoyue Liansi’s residence. Halfway there, she suddenly spotted a familiar silhouette ahead—it was Ziyan, holding her clothes in her arms.
