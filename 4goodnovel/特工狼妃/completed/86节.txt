**"Do You Really Wish for My Hand to Be Disabled?"**

“Is this really how you react?!” He had expected at least a flicker of surprise when he revealed his plans, but to his disappointment, her expression remained calm and cold, as if nothing he said mattered to her. If it weren't for the occasional flashes of anger that crossed her face, he might have believed she was a soulless deity, devoid of any human emotions.

“What should my reaction be?!” she shot back, raising an eyebrow. She wasn’t a savior; their lives and deaths had nothing to do with her! Nangong Nuo'er questioned him with a touch of sarcasm.

“Nothing, never mind,” he mumbled, realizing just what kind of person she was—a person who couldn’t even be bothered to look after her own family. Expecting her to care about others was a wild fantasy. Helian Yichen felt a profound sense of disillusionment, his admiration for her now tinged with helplessness.

“Since there’s nothing to say, you should hurry and take your medicine,” Nangong Nuo'er said indifferently.

Once Helian Yichen had finally finished the bitter concoction, Xiaoxiao entered with a bright expression, informing her that the wheelchair she had requested was ready.

“Wow, it’s done so quickly?! Where is it?!” Nangong Nuo'er couldn’t believe how efficient they were. A wave of excitement washed over her—she couldn’t wait to see the results. With that wheelchair, she could go anywhere she wanted without issue.

“Of course! With our second master’s incredible skills, nothing is a problem,” Xiaoxiao said, her face glowing with admiration as she mentioned him.

“Second master?! Who is that?” He looked at her, intrigued by her evident admiration. This second master must be quite remarkable to have completed the wheelchair in just a few days. His interest in this mysterious figure grew.

“Miss, you don’t even remember the second master? He’s your second uncle!” Xiaoxiao couldn’t help but sigh as she watched her forgetfulness. It seemed that the third young lady’s memory loss was truly complete; she had forgotten everyone.

“Oh, so it’s my second uncle.” The memory clicked for her. She recalled Nangong Qian'er mentioning that they had a second uncle who was reclusive and never engaged with the world. He preferred to stay in his own courtyard, focusing on things he loved. Despite being here for quite some time, she had never met him. It seemed he was quite the homebody, a true introvert who didn’t even join them for meals. 

The realization made her curious about this second uncle, and she wondered what kind of person he truly was.
