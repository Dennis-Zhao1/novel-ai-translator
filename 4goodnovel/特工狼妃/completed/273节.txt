Section 273: Don’t Beg for Mercy Later! (Part 3)
"Don’t tell me you’re not up to it today," she teased, her tone laced with playful mockery.

"You, of all people, should know whether I am or not," he retorted, his voice dropping an octave. Her words had already stirred a heat within him that was impossible to ignore. With deliberate intent, his hands found her waist, pulling her closer so she could feel the undeniable evidence of his desire.

"In that case, what are you waiting for?" Nangong Nuo’er smiled seductively, her delicate, lotus-like arms wrapping around his neck. Her breath, warm and fragrant, brushed against his ear, drawing him further into her web.

"You little temptress," he murmured, a wicked grin spreading across his lips. "Don’t beg for mercy later." Her boldness only fueled his determination to show her exactly how wrong she was to provoke him.

"Beg for mercy? Are you sure you have the energy for that?" she replied, arching an eyebrow, her tone dripping with challenge.

"Little vixen, just for that, you’re done for," he growled, his grin turning devilish. She dared to question him, and he would make sure she regretted it. With a swift motion, Helian Yichen scooped her into his arms, striding purposefully toward the bed.

"Who’s done for? We’ll see about that. O(∩_∩)O haha!" she laughed brazenly, her confidence shining through even as he carried her.

"I love a good challenge," he muttered, his voice a mixture of amusement and raw intensity. Reaching the bed, he tossed her onto the soft mattress with little ceremony, wasting no time as he loomed over her. His lips found hers with an unrelenting fervor, the kiss searing and possessive.

His hands moved with practiced precision, loosening the sash at her waist. Even before her clothes were fully undone, his touch sought the warmth of her skin, eliciting an involuntary shiver from her.

"Mm..." Her breath hitched as his fingers brushed over her, leaving a trail of warmth that made her skin tingle and her senses whirl. The sensation was overwhelming, a mix of discomfort and inexplicable exhilaration. Refusing to remain passive, she mustered what strength she had and reached for his shirt, her hands fumbling to rid him of the barrier between them.

"You’re such a fiery little temptress," he said, his voice low and rough, laced with admiration. His gaze burned into hers, a mix of hunger and reverence, as his hands roamed with a confidence that left no doubt of his intent. "But I like that about you."

The intensity of his words, combined with the heat of the moment, left no room for doubt—neither was willing to yield.
