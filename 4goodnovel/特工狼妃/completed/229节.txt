**Let Me Stay and Accompany You!** 

“Absolutely not.” Nango Noer replied without a moment's hesitation.

“Do you realize how much that hurts my feelings?!” He Lian Yichen sighed, a hint of exasperation in his voice. “You’re being a bit too straightforward, don’t you think? At least put some thought into your answer before shutting me down.”

“Is that so? Well, it doesn’t matter. You have plenty of women to comfort you anyway.” Nango’s voice was soft and indifferent, making it impossible to gauge her true feelings or the thoughts swirling in her mind.

“Can I take that to mean you’re feeling jealous on my behalf?!” He Lian couldn’t help but ask, even though her tone was devoid of any bitterness. The mere idea that she might feel jealousy for him filled him with unexpected joy.

“Has anyone ever told you that you’re incredibly self-absorbed?” She shot back, unimpressed. Just because they had shared a few intimate moments didn’t mean she would act like the other women who flocked to him, desperate for his affection. Sorry, but she wasn’t at that level yet.

“I know you don’t, but if you didn’t deny it, I’d be quite happy.” He Lian Yichen opened his mouth and playfully bit down on her delicate neck, not hard enough to hurt but enough to send a jolt through her.

“I don’t think I owe you the obligation of making you happy. My neck isn’t a snack, so please don’t bite it without reason.” The sensation of his lips brushing against her skin sent tingles down her spine. Although his bite wasn’t painful, it left a mark. She didn’t particularly care about what others thought, but she wasn’t interested in giving them something to gossip about either.

“Who says it isn’t? Don’t you know you’re quite the delectable little thing?” He Lian chuckled, his deep, rich laughter resonating in the air. He wanted to devour her whole, savoring every inch. The more she protested, the more amused he became.

“Your Highness, it seems you’re here for something important. Don’t you find it a bit dull to just hang around chatting with me all day?” Nango glanced up at him with a sideways look, unimpressed by his suggestive comments.

“How could I be bored? I’m just worried you might feel lonely, so I’m keeping you company.” He Lian feigned a look of innocence, though she had a point; in the context of their current relationship, it did seem like he was a dark cloud hanging over her.

As the playful banter continued, both of them felt the undeniable tension in the air, a dance of emotions and unspoken desires lingering just beneath the surface.
