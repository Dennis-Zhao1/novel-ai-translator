**You Bite Me! 3**

"Don't worry, my lady," he reassured her. "The reason I didn't let you go last night was that I need you for something else today. I want you to gather some intel about the situation. I suspect they are colluding with the local officials, and their smuggling operations are quite serious. I need to uncover the mastermind behind this as soon as possible." He was reluctant to waste any more time here; all he wanted was to take Nuo'er back to the royal residence. A sharp glint flashed in Helian Yichen's dark eyes; he was done playing games with those people.

"Understood, Your Highness. I will take care of it right away," Qin Tian replied, bowing before exiting.

Just then, a rush of hurried footsteps echoed from outside. As Helian Yichen wondered what was happening, a familiar voice called out, "Quick, hurry and fetch a doctor!"

Why do they need a doctor? Did Nuo'er get hurt?! His heart tightened at the thought. Clutching his wound, he rolled out of bed. At that moment, Xiaoxiao and Xiao Qi wheeled in Nangong Nuo'er, who was sitting in a wheelchair. Nuo'er had her hands clutched tightly around her head, her body trembling violently. Seeing this made his heart sink, and he quickly stepped forward, his voice heavy with concern, "What happened?!"

"Your Highness, I don’t know!" Xiaoxiao exclaimed, her voice frantic. "Just a moment ago, Xiao Qi and I were walking with Miss Nuo'er in the courtyard, but suddenly she had a severe headache and started shaking with chills. I had no choice but to bring her back here."

"A headache?! How could she suddenly have a headache?!" Helian Yichen knelt beside her wheelchair, observing her inability to lift her head as her body continued to tremble. His heart ached for her as he gently stroked her hair, softening his voice, "Nuo'er, are you alright?!"

"My head hurts so much; please don’t make any noise! I just need some quiet," Nangong Nuo'er cried, her hands clutching her head tighter. Her teeth were gritted, and she felt a pain so intense it was as if her head might explode. She had always been healthy, so she couldn’t understand why this sudden headache was hitting her now, accompanied by inexplicable chills and spasms.

"Nuo'er, what on earth is happening to you?!" Helian Yichen's heart raced with worry as he tried to lift her face from where it was buried in her knees, but the moment his hand brushed against her cheek, she fiercely swatted it away.
