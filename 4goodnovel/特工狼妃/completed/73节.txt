**Bringing the Wolf into the House!**

After finishing her breakfast, Nanguo Nuo'er had her maid, Xiaoxiao, prepare the four treasures of the study for her. She settled into her room and began to paint. As she held the brush in her hand, a wave of nostalgia washed over her for the pencils and pens of the twenty-first century. Thankfully, she had learned how to use a brush, so it wasn’t too difficult for her, though it certainly wasn’t as convenient.

"Third Miss, what are you drawing? It looks like a chair, but why does it have wheels?!" Xiaoxiao asked, peering over Nuo'er’s shoulder with curiosity about the unusual image she was creating.

"This is called a wheelchair," Nuo'er explained, her eyes lighting up with enthusiasm. "It's designed for people with disabilities in their lower limbs. Without someone to assist them, they can't go anywhere. But with this wheelchair, they can venture out even without a companion or crutches."

A bitter smile crept onto Nuo'er’s lips as she realized that she, too, was now part of that community of the disabled. It had never occurred to her to design a wheelchair for herself in this strange new world.

"Oh, so that's how it works! Once it's made, can the person push it themselves without needing someone to help? That's amazing! I've never seen a wheelchair like this before," Xiaoxiao exclaimed, her eyes wide with wonder as she studied the rough sketch of the model.

"Of course! This way, anyone sitting in the wheelchair can go wherever they please without bothering anyone else," Nuo'er nodded enthusiastically.

"Third Miss, how did you come up with such an idea?! If people with lower limb disabilities could have one of these wheelchairs, it would be truly fantastic," Xiaoxiao said, her excitement bubbling over.

"In my home..." Nuo'er started to say, but suddenly remembered her current identity as Nanguo Nuo'er, not Menghan. She forced a smile and added, "What I meant was, I saw this type of wheelchair while I was away from the Nanguo Manor, and it just came to mind. I thought I’d have someone make it to give it a try."

"Third Miss, you’re so impressive! You can just draw it after seeing it!" Xiaoxiao said, admiration filling her voice.

"Ah, it’s nothing really," Nuo'er chuckled lightly at Xiaoxiao's exaggerated praise. After finishing the sketch of the wheelchair, she handed it to her and instructed, "Xiaoxiao, take this design to Xiao Qi and have him find the best craftsman to make this wheelchair in the shortest time possible, alright?!"
