remnants of his presence lingered!

“Grandma, you shouldn’t be out and about if you’re feeling unwell. When my sister returns, she will come to pay her respects to you,” the second Miss gently urged, concern etched on her face as she noticed her grandmother coughing.

“I know my own body. I haven’t seen Nuo’er in such a long time; of course, I worry about her. Cough, cough…” The elderly lady spoke, her voice frail. Menghan couldn’t shake the feeling that her grandmother seemed less fond of her second granddaughter than she was of her—a complete stranger. The warmth in the old lady's eyes when she looked at Menghan was missing when she gazed upon her own granddaughter.

“Grandma, I understand how much you miss your granddaughter, but I must tell you—I'm not Nuo’er. You’ve mistaken me for someone else,” Menghan said, her heart heavy. While she didn’t want to shatter the old lady's hopes, she couldn’t lie to her. She simply wasn’t Nuo’er.

“What? What are you saying? Cough, cough…” The old lady’s excitement turned to alarm, her breathing quickening and her cough worsening.

“Grandma, please don’t get upset. My sister might have hit her head and forgotten who she is,” the second Miss quickly interjected, trying to soothe the situation.

“What? Nuo’er, my Nuo’er has lost her memory? How could that be? Child, you must have suffered so much while you were away. You must be so tired; go rest for now,” the old lady’s voice softened, her concern for her granddaughter evident. She then insisted that Menghan take a break while she was guided back to her quarters by the second Miss and a maid.

“Sister, Grandma’s health is failing by the day. Whether or not you truly have amnesia, I hope you won’t upset her anymore. After all, she cares for you the most,” the second Miss said, her gaze following the old lady’s retreating figure with a hint of sadness.

“What do you want me to do, then?” Menghan raised an eyebrow, sensing the distrust in her tone toward her younger sister.

“Do you have anywhere to go? If not, I’d like you to stay here. It doesn’t matter if you’re my sister or not; I just hope you can help comfort my grandmother,” the second Miss pleaded, a hint of desperation in her voice. It was clear she wanted Menghan to remain.

“Well…” Menghan hesitated. This was her first time in this place, and she didn’t have anywhere else to turn. After a moment of contemplation, she decided to heed her request.
