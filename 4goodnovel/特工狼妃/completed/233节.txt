**Let Me Stay to Accompany You! Part 5**

“However, I won’t feel at ease until I see Miss San safe and sound. Don’t worry about me; I’ll be fine! If she finds out, I’ll just say I have a huge pimple on my face, so I’m covering it with gauze to avoid being seen.” It had only been two days since she last saw her, but it felt like an eternity.

“Right! Girls do love to look pretty. If you say that, she definitely won’t suspect anything,” Little Qi nodded vigorously.

“Little Qi, go fetch a basin of hot water.” Just as they were discussing this, the door swung open, revealing Helyan Yichen, his expression grave. He glanced at Little Qi and ordered.

“Yes, Your Highness.” Little Qi immediately turned and dashed away.

“Your Highness, how is Miss San doing now?!” A muffled groan had come from inside earlier; it must have been Miss San experiencing her withdrawal symptoms. Xiaoxiao stepped forward, worry etched on her face.

“She’s fine now, Xiaoxiao. For now, you shouldn’t see her. I don’t want to agitate her emotions,” Helyan Yichen replied, his gaze lingering on the right side of her face, partially hidden by her hair.

“Yes, Your Highness. I was just worried about Miss San. If she’s okay now, I’ll head back,” Xiaoxiao said, covering her face with her hand before turning to leave, her eyes dim with concern.

“Stop.” Just as Xiaoxiao was about to turn away, a weary voice called from behind her. The sound made her freeze in place, her body stiffening as if weighed down by a thousand pounds, unable to lift her feet.

“Nu’er, why did you come out? Your body is still weak; you should be resting in bed,” Helyan Yichen said, a hint of worry crossing his face as he stepped forward to support her, attempting to guide her back inside.

“If you don’t want me to hate you, don’t stop me,” Nangong Nu’er replied, glaring at him with fierce, cold eyes that sparkled with a hint of intimidation.

“Nu’er, I’m doing this for your own good.” Helyan Yichen sighed helplessly, feeling a mix of frustration and concern. Why couldn’t she just listen to him for once? It seemed that only by opposing him could she find any happiness.

“Hiding things from me is for my own good? Hmph, Xiaoxiao, come here!” Nangong Nu’er commanded, her tone leaving no room for argument.
