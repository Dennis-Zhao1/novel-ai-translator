**The Man Who Intruded the Boudoir! Chapter 6**

Nangong Xudan gently shifted his arm, surprised to find that his dislocated joint had been set back in place. He stared at her in astonishment and asked, “After all these years, I never knew you could do this.”

“Learned it from someone outside. What are you doing sneaking into my room in the middle of the night?” Nangong Nuoer casually grabbed a coat and threw it over her shoulders, her tone icy.

“Little sister, wasn’t it always like this before? Every time I returned home, my first stop was always to see you. I only found out about your amnesia after I got the news from the family. What happened to you out there? Have you really forgotten everything?” Nangong Xudan looked at her with a mixture of anxiety and concern.

“I don’t want to talk about what happened outside, but I will say this: regardless of how things were before, if you want to come into my room in the future, please do so during the day and make sure to knock first.” She emphasized the importance of knocking, a basic courtesy. After all, they were only half-siblings, not close enough to sneak into her room at such late hours. Nangong Nuoer’s voice was cold.

“Little sister, they said you’ve changed, but I didn’t believe it until now. You really have changed.” At her words, Nangong Xudan’s expression stiffened, and he spoke with a hint of disappointment.

“People change.” Who could remain innocent forever? Nangong Nuoer replied flatly.

“But you used to be so warm towards me.” Nangong Xudan’s face showed a tinge of sadness. Could amnesia really alter someone’s character?

“Well, big brother, you’ll just have to get used to the new me.” She wasn’t truly Nangong Nuoer anymore; she didn’t need to please them. All she needed to do was be herself. After all, she had already made it clear that she wasn’t the third young lady of the Nangong family. If they didn’t believe her, it wasn’t her problem, and she didn’t need to mimic the old Nuoer.

“Little sister, have you really forgotten everything from before?” Nangong Xudan pressed again, his eager gaze seeming to seek confirmation.

“Absolutely. Why do you keep bringing this up, big brother?” Nangong Nuoer’s sharp eyes assessed him, and she noticed a thin sheen of sweat forming on his forehead, as if he were hiding something.
