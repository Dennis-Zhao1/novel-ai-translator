She’s here, and that means the show is about to begin!

“That’s where you’re wrong. Nuo’er isn’t just any ordinary girl. I think this time I need to come up with a solid plan to win her back,” He Lian Yi Chen thought to himself that night. He had deeply hurt her feelings, and asking for her forgiveness would not be an easy feat. But that was alright—he had all the time in the world to wait her out. Eventually, she would give in. He maintained a calm demeanor.

“Winning a woman over usually involves gifts—gold, silver, jewelry, luxurious silks and satins. Would you like me to find someone to arrange that for you, sir?!” Qin Tian inquired eagerly. Whatever gifts he gave should be the best. Even a simple hairpin should be exquisitely designed, top-quality stuff. 

“Qin Tian, since when did you become so nosy?!” He Lian Yi Chen retorted. If Nan Gong Nuo’er was interested in material things, then what made her different from any ordinary woman? His Nuo’er was anything but typical.

“I just want to see you and Miss Nan Gong reconcile quickly,” Qin Tian replied honestly. He didn’t want to see them in a cold war any longer.

“I can handle her matters myself, no need for you to meddle.” He Lian Yi Chen asserted. He preferred to deal with his own woman without relying on anyone else’s help.

“Yes, sir.” Seeing that his master was displeased with his involvement, Qin Tian fell silent.

As He Lian Yi Chen quietly sipped his wine, a flash of white light suddenly darted past him. With a soft thud, a pure white dove landed on his table. He didn’t even blink as the dove settled in front of him.

Qin Tian, without needing to be told, approached the table, taking the small note tied to the dove’s leg before opening it. The moment he read the note, his expression changed dramatically. He spoke in a low voice, “Sir, something major has happened.”

“Oh? What’s so major? You look pale as if the royal city has collapsed or something!” He Lian Yi Chen asked casually, tapping his fingers lightly on the table.

“Well, it’s not that, but Princess Yue Qing has arrived. It seems she is also here, and according to the note, she arrived not long after we did. It’s strange she hasn’t come to see you; she should know you’re staying at the Nan Gong villa.” Qin Tian said with a hint of confusion. The only reason Princess Yue Qing would come here was for him, yet she hadn’t sought him out. Was something wrong? Qin Tian couldn’t help but feel a twinge of worry.
