**He Actually Can’t Bear to Kill Him! 2**

He actually can’t bear to kill him!

“I don’t have time to play with you. You should go.” The man wearing the Asura mask attacked with precise strikes aimed at critical points, clearly intent on ending his life.

“Do you really want me dead that badly? You’re so heartless! It’s a shame I found you so interesting.” Tuo Ba Tian Ye countered each of his aggressive moves, realizing that the man was genuinely trying to kill him. He dared not let his guard down, yet he couldn’t resist the urge to provoke him.

“Yeah, right now, the thing I want most is to kill you.” The man’s expression twisted with disdain. He was relentless in his assault, his attacks growing increasingly fierce.

“You want to kill me? But I’d much rather care for you.” Hearing his words, Tuo Ba Tian Ye feigned heartbreak, clutching his chest dramatically.

“I don’t need your care; I just want you dead.” The masked man nearly choked on his words, his fury intensifying as he targeted Tuo Ba Tian Ye’s vital points with unyielding ferocity.

“What a ruthless man you are! Here I am, giving you my heartfelt attention, and you throw it back in my face! You truly break my heart.” It seemed he was genuinely serious, prompting Tuo Ba Tian Ye to muster eighty percent of his internal energy in response.

“If you really had feelings for me, you’d dig out your heart and give it to me,” the Asura-masked man sneered, his long, elegant fingers suddenly curling like claws as they lunged toward Tuo Ba Tian Ye’s heart.

“You want my heart? No problem, but it has to be a trade for yours.” Tuo Ba Tian Ye stood his ground, not flinching. Just as the man’s hand reached his heart, Tuo Ba Tian Ye mirrored the action, their hands halting over each other’s chests. The moment one of them moved, the other would surely follow.

“Why did you suddenly stop? Didn’t you want to carve out my heart? I’m waiting.” With both of them locked in a standoff, Tuo Ba Tian Ye winked and smiled at him.

“You think you can trade your heart for mine? You don’t have what it takes.” The masked man suddenly stepped back, widening the distance between them.

“Am I really unable to pay the price?” A sharp glint flashed in Tuo Ba Tian Ye’s eyes as he swiftly reached for the man’s heart. The Asura-masked man thought he was being ambushed and instinctively lowered his guard, but that left his upper defense wide open. Seizing the opportunity, Tuo Ba Tian Ye redirected his hand toward the man’s face, aiming for the mask.

“You despicable little sneak!” Realizing he had been outmaneuvered, the masked man saw Tuo Ba Tian Ye's hand reach for his mask. He tried to stop him, but it was too late; the mask was already being ripped away.

“Deception is part of the game, and it’s definitely you! Didn’t you say you were only interested in wooden dolls? Why are you suddenly playing such a dangerous game now? This mask is quite nice; it looks mysterious and charming.” Tuo Ba Tian Ye held the mask triumphantly, his smile widening.

“Now that you’ve seen my true face, I won’t let you go, Tuo Ba Tian Ye. Prepare to die.” During the day, his beautiful eyes sparkled with soft light, his face adorned with a shy, gentle smile. But now, he seemed like a vengeful spirit risen from hell, his gaze still enchanting yet now filled with a bloodthirsty intent.
