"You’re quite the strong man yourself, aren’t you?"

Nangong Nuo'er turned her head to glance at the creature beside her, unable to suppress a joyful smile. Ever since that day she had subdued it, the black eagle trembled every time it saw her, truly a cowardly bird.

"Nuo'er, if you keep smiling at it like that, I might just get jealous," Helian Yichen couldn't help but comment, noticing the way she chuckled at the black eagle while rarely smiling at him.

"It makes me laugh. If I don’t laugh at its funny expressions, wouldn’t that be a waste of its efforts?" She teased, noting how possessive he seemed even over a bird.

"I can make you laugh too, but you hardly smile for me," he retorted, a hint of dissatisfaction creeping into his voice.

"Come on, you’re a big man. Can’t you be a little more generous?" She rolled her eyes at his jealousy, finding it amusing.

"If I weren’t generous, I’d have already choked you out," he replied, leaning down to nip at her lips lightly.

"That’s not the point. Just because you don’t choke me doesn’t mean you’re generous; it just means you can’t bear to do it." Nuo'er was not one to let herself be bullied without a fight. Seizing the moment while his lips were still near, she bit down on his lips hard.

"You fierce woman," he exclaimed, pulling back swiftly from the unexpected bite.

"Aren’t you a fierce man too?" She shot back, challenging the notion that men could be strong while women could not. Seeing his frustrated expression only made her smile shine brighter, captivating him even more.

"You should smile more. Did you know that when you smile, you’re incredibly beautiful and enchanting?" Helian Yichen remarked, lost in her charm. Her laughter seemed to have an enchanting quality, making him want to gaze at her endlessly.

"Thanks for the compliment, but smiles depend on one’s mood. Who smiles foolishly all day long? Besides, if you smile too much, it loses its value," she replied, her confidence shining through. She was a strong and self-assured woman, difficult to grasp, but once held, never to be released.

Nangong Nuo'er had thought that the outing would be just her and Helian Yichen, but upon stepping outside, she realized that Tuoba Tianye and his entourage were also joining them.

In front of Tuoba Tianye, Helian Yichen possessively wrapped his arm around Nuo'er’s waist, as though marking his territory. Tuoba Tianye observed quietly, a faint smile gracing his lips. He understood that Helian Yichen was still bothered by that day’s events; indeed, lovers often see the smallest faults in each other. But it didn’t matter, as he wasn’t interested in Nuo'er anyway.

While the excursion was billed as a picnic, it was actually a reconnaissance mission to gather intel on the Fengshui Gang. Their headquarters was located upstream along the river, and they intended to observe its operations under the guise of enjoying the scenic views.

The river was wide and majestic, with enchanting landscapes lining its banks. It was not unusual for them to take a boat to admire the scenery, and Helian Yichen and the others lounged on the deck, appearing to engage in casual conversation while taking in the sights.

"Your Highness, I’ve investigated. Over half of the Fengshui Gang's transactions are with the Nangong family," Tuoba Tianye said, stealing a glance at Nuo'er. Only after receiving a nod from Helian Yichen did he continue.

"Indeed, at least eighty percent. The Nangong Manor is significant, but such a large portion of the dealings raises suspicions," Helian Yichen responded, furrowing his brow in contemplation.
