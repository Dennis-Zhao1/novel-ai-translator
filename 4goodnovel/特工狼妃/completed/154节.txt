Here comes the good show! 7

“Miss, I apologize. My cousin, Lan Qin, has a mischievous nature and loves to joke around. Please don’t take her too seriously. I am Tuo Ba Tian Ye, and I’m new to this area. I haven’t had the chance to visit your manor yet,” Tuo Ba Tian Ye said, bowing politely to Nangong Nuo Er.

“Tuo Ba Tian Ye, you’re the president of the Golden Dragon Society?!” Nangong Nuo Er exclaimed in surprise. She had expected someone in charge of such a large organization to be much older, so she was taken aback to find that he looked to be in his thirties. To achieve such a position at such a young age certainly meant he was no ordinary person.

“Indeed, that’s me. Third Miss, you seem quite surprised. Is there something about me that astonishes you?” Tuo Ba Tian Ye asked with a curious smile. He had heard from Xiao Xiao that she was the third miss of the Nangong Manor.

Before coming here, he had done some research on the Nangong family. Reports indicated that this third miss was both intelligent and charming, with a gentle demeanor that treated servants like family, earning her deep affection from the people. However, seeing her in person, he was a bit taken aback; she didn’t seem gentle at all. Her expression was cold, as if she were owed something by everyone around her.

“It’s nothing. I’m just a bit surprised that the president of the Golden Dragon Society is such a young man,” Nangong Nuo Er replied flatly.

“Of course! My cousin is exceptionally talented and skilled in martial arts. He rightfully deserves to be the president of the Golden Dragon Society,” Murong Lan Qin boasted proudly.

“Cousin!” Tuo Ba Tian Ye shot her a disapproving look. Immediately, Lan Qin covered her mouth with her hand, signaling that she wouldn’t speak out of turn again. He then turned back to Nangong Nuo Er with an apologetic expression. “Third Miss, I’m sorry. My cousin lacks proper upbringing. To show my apologies, I would like to gift you this whip.” He took out a gold ingot from his pocket and handed it to the vendor. “Boss, I’ll buy this whip and gift it to the third miss.”

“President Tuo Ba, one should not receive favors without merit. Let me pay for the whip myself,” Nangong Nuo Er said, feeling displeased that he had so casually offered to pay for her. She wasn’t short on money and didn’t want to owe anyone any favors. 

As she watched the vendor’s eyes light up with excitement at their generosity, she felt a sense of discomfort rising within her.
