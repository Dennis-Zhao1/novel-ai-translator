**Strange Dreams! 3**

“When you find the divine zither, you will have three paths to choose from. The first is to return to my body and merge with me. The second is to remain in this world forever. Of course, the last path is to go back to the world you are familiar with.”

Xianle’s face broke into a serene smile as she continued, “You are a part of my soul reincarnated. I won’t make it difficult for you, so you must obtain the divine artifact. Only then will you have a choice.” In other words, she had no option but to follow her words.

“You expect me to help you find the divine zither within five years, or else I’ll vanish? You think that’s not making things difficult for me?” Nangong Nuo’er scoffed at her words. She realized that her life had already been limited to just five years, a mere blink in the grand scheme of time. It was truly laughable and tragic.

“No matter how you see it, this is your only choice. Go back with Helian Yichen. Staying by his side will give you a much greater chance of encountering the divine zither,” Xianle replied, unfazed by Nuo’er’s retorts. Her expression remained unchanged.

“It seems I have no other choice but to become this thief,” Nangong Nuo’er said with a cold smirk tugging at her lips.

“The zither originally belongs to us. What you’re doing isn’t stealing; you’re merely reclaiming what is rightfully yours,” Xianle corrected her once again.

“I am me, and you are you. Don’t confuse the two of us. By the way, how am I supposed to know what this zither looks like or where it is now?” She wouldn’t expect her to just hand over a dream and expect her to easily steal that cursed zither. After all, she was new to this place and knew nothing about it. Nangong Nuo’er furrowed her brow in question.

“You are a part of my soul reincarnated. Though incomplete, my essence lingers on the zither. When it appears near you, you will feel an intense urge to play it,” Xianle said, looking at her with a smile.

“Is it really that magical?” Nangong Nuo’er couldn't help but poke at her fingertips, skeptical of the claims.

“You don’t have to believe it now. When you see the zither, you’ll believe it then,” Xianle replied, a faint smile still gracing her lips.
