"You cold-hearted, heartless woman!" 

"I mean what I say, and my promises are forever. As long as you don't betray me, I'll protect you for life," Helyan Yichen said earnestly, his dark eyes serious.

"A promise with conditions isn't worth having," Nangong Nuo'er replied, her tone suddenly turning icy. She truly didn’t value such a conditional promise—not at all.

"You ungrateful woman! Do you have any idea how many women would kill for my promise?" 

Helyan Yichen's face darkened, frustration boiling beneath the surface at her indifferent words. He had lowered himself to plead with her, yet she insisted on defying him at every turn.

"How would I know? I barely know you! But I’m sure you don’t realize how many men would want me either." She huffed, a mocking smile creeping onto her lips. From domestic suitors to international admirers, there were countless men vying for her attention. Did he really think he was a prized possession while she was just some unwanted trash? The audacity! 

"I don't care how many men want you. Since that night, you belong to me and only me." Helyan Yichen's voice turned sharp, frustration flickering in his eyes as he grasped her shoulders firmly, asserting his claim over her. She had stirred this fire, and she would be accountable for the consequences—she would never have the chance to fall into another man's embrace.

"I can only belong to you, but you can’t belong to me alone. Can't you be fair about this?!" It seemed that this man was not only domineering but also lacked emotional intelligence; he was easily riled by her taunts. As she glanced at his flushed face, an impish glint sparkled in Nangong Nuo'er’s cold eyes. She realized she had discovered the perfect way to provoke him.

"This isn't about fairness; it's about us," she said, a hint of amusement dancing in her voice. It seemed she took pleasure in riling him up. Helyan Yichen suddenly felt like nothing more than a jester in front of her, a source of entertainment for her amusement. The realization left him both infuriated and oddly amused. He wanted to hold this woman tightly, to have her in his grasp, but unfortunately, he found himself unwittingly dancing to her tune, completely at her mercy.
