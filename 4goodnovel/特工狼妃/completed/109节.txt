**Addicted to…? Part 7**

“Take me back to where I used to live.” Nuan Xiao had already decided that she couldn’t go back to Helyan Yichen’s place. Hadn’t he just made it crystal clear? No matter how much he liked her, he would never marry a junkie. Honestly, it was for the best. She had never really thought of marrying him in the first place. In fact, she had been pondering over what excuse she could come up with to break things off once her foot healed. But now, it seemed she wouldn't even need to think of a reason. That saved her quite a bit of mental energy.

“Miss San, it’s all my fault. If only my martial arts skills were better, that scoundrel wouldn’t have barged in here,” Xiao Qi lamented, pushing Nuan Xiao’s wheelchair alongside Xiao Xiao as they made their way out.

“Xiao Qi, please stop blaming yourself. What’s meant to happen will happen, no matter how hard you try to prevent it. I never wanted to be with him anyway; he was the one who insisted. Isn’t this just aligning with my wishes?” Nuan Xiao replied lightly, her tone steady.

“But…” Xiao Qi wanted to argue further, but was silenced by a sharp look from Xiao Xiao. “Xiao Qi, Miss San is tired. Let’s give her some space to rest, alright?”

“Oh, then Miss San, please take a good rest. We will wake you when we return to the dormitory,” Xiao Qi conceded reluctantly.

“Okay.” Nuan Xiao softly acknowledged, her heart warmed by their thoughtfulness. Yet, her downcast eyes shimmered with suppressed tears, the chilly night breeze brushing against her face felt almost biting, sending a chill straight to her heart.

News of Nuan Xiao moving out of Helyan Yichen’s place spread quickly throughout the villa. The residents buzzed with excitement and speculation, claiming that Nuan Xiao's dream of soaring high had come crashing down. Her second mother, second sister, and elder brother came one after another to inquire about the situation.

Upon confirming that their engagement had fallen through, they were all so ecstatic that they felt like setting off firecrackers in celebration. This infuriated Xiao Qi and Xiao Xiao, who were protective of Nuan Xiao, to the point where they wanted to kick the others out. Meanwhile, Nuan Xiao remained utterly calm, as if this was none of her business.

“Little sister, didn’t I already tell you? That despicable prince isn’t worth committing your life to. Once you’re better, I’ll help you find a man who’s far superior to him,” Nuan Xiao’s elder brother, Nuan Xudang, said as he squatted beside her wheelchair, mistaking her stoic expression for sorrow over Helyan Yichen’s abandonment.
