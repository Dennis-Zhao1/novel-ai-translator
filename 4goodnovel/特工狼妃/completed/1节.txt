**The Allure of the Night Coast!**

As the night deepened, a gentle breeze quietly caressed the earth beneath the darkening sky. A golden moon hung overhead, bright and round like a shimmering yolk, casting an eerie glow across the landscape. The silver, ethereal moonlight spilled out over the quiet ground, while the scent of night wafted through the air, weaving a soft web that enveloped everything in its embrace.

In the stillness of the deepening night, just as the earth was about to succumb to slumber, a luxurious mansion perched halfway up the mountain was alive with dazzling lights. The air was filled with intoxicating music that poured from the main room, spilling out through the partially open door.

Despite feeling like she might vomit inside, she maintained a facade of enjoyment, putting on a smile that masked her distaste.

"And how do you plan to serve me?" Mr. Jin asked, raising an eyebrow in anticipation, his rough hands continuing to wander over her delicate waist.

"Please, Mr. Jin, just be patient." She noted his eagerness; it seemed he was a man who couldn't contain himself for long. Menghan stifled a cold laugh in her heart as she slowly withdrew her soft hand from his chest, preparing for what lay ahead...
