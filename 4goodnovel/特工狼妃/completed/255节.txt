**Chapter 3: I’m Heartbroken for You!**

“Norah, do you have something you want to tell me tonight?!” Helian Yichen pulled her hand and led her to sit on the steps in front of the dormitory. He let her soft, weakened body lean against his strong embrace, casually toying with her smooth hair with his rough fingers.

“Nothing.” Nangong Norah relaxed against him, her wildly beating heart slowly calming down, a charming and drowsy blush spreading across her face…

“Are you really not going to let me in on what’s going on with you?!” Helian Yichen, feeling unsatisfied with her cold response, pinched her waist playfully, punishing her for hiding everything deep in her heart and not sharing it with him.

“I don’t have anything worth telling you.” Nangong Norah gently pushed his hand away, taking a soft breath before replying.

“Still insisting you don’t? If I hadn’t come looking for you tonight, would you really have continued hiding it from me?!” What a disobedient little girl, Helian Yichen leaned down and playfully bit her sensitive ear, noticing her instinctive flinch. A glimmer of amusement flashed in his purple eyes.

“Did you see that?!” Surprised by his words, Nangong Norah looked up into his deep purple gaze, not expecting so many people would have time on their hands tonight.

“I saw and heard everything, and I even taught him a lesson for you.” Helian Yichen took her icy hand and wrapped it in his warm grasp, his gaze fiercely locking onto hers.

“Oh, how did you teach him a lesson? You didn’t make him unable to get out of bed tomorrow, did you?” She had already issued him an ultimatum to go talk to her second mother about taking a concubine. If he injured that guy and made it so he couldn’t go tomorrow, who would go for her? If he ruined her plans, she would definitely be angry.

“Don’t worry, he’ll definitely be able to go to your second mother tomorrow to discuss taking a concubine. I hit him in places that outsiders can’t see, but those two slaps you gave him? He’ll have a hard time showing his face tomorrow.” Mentioning Nangong Xudan, a shadow flickered in Helian Yichen’s eyes. If he hadn’t known she had other plans, he would have made sure to leave him incapacitated.

As the night deepened, the air around them felt charged with unspoken words and emotions. Helian Yichen’s protective presence enveloped Norah, making her feel safe yet torn between expressing her thoughts and keeping her secrets. The tension crackled like electricity, and the promise of tomorrow loomed heavy over their conversation.
