**Chapter 1: Residual Echoes of His Presence**

This guy was really strange. He could even mistake his own savior. Seriously, his attempts at flirting were just pathetic.

"You’re clearly the Third Miss! How could you not have heard of the Nangong family? You saved my life five years ago. There’s no way I could mistake you! You’re the Third Miss, aren't you? Have you lost your memory? How can you forget who you are?" Xiaoqi’s frustration bubbled over. The resemblance was uncanny; even identical twins wouldn’t look so alike.

"You're really odd. I’ve already told you that you’ve mistaken me for someone else. Why are you dragging this out? My memory is just fine, thank you very much. If anyone’s lost their mind here, it’s you. I advise you not to follow me, or I won’t be polite," Menghan said, half-closing her eyes as she shot him a dangerous glare. She had zero tolerance for these kinds of persistent flirts.

"I haven’t mistaken you! You are the Third Miss! Where have you been all this time? I’ve searched everywhere for you. I finally found you, and I’m not leaving your side no matter what," Xiaoqi pleaded earnestly, his expression genuine, as if he had no reason to lie.

"I’m not joking. If you keep following me, I will seriously kill you." The nerve of someone mistaking their own savior! In her eyes, letting someone like him live was just a waste of resources. Menghan's hand clenched into a fist, a cold glint of murderous intent flashing in her eyes.

"I owe my life to you, Miss. If you want to kill me, I have no complaints," Xiaoqi replied, looking at her with a hint of sorrow, though it wasn’t because she threatened him. It was because she no longer recognized him.

"Killing you would just dirty my hands. If you want to die, do it far away from me." Hearing his response surprised Menghan, causing her murderous intent to dissipate unexpectedly. However, her mood was still sour. Arriving in this bizarre place had already put her on edge, and now he was pestering her. What a nuisance! Menghan didn’t even want to spare him a glance, quickening her pace to put distance between them.

"Third Miss, please don’t drive me away. If you don’t want to hear me talk, I can be quiet, but please just let me follow you,” Xiaoqi said, a hurt expression crossing his face at her harshness, as if he had just been dealt an unfair blow.
