**Here Comes the Show! 6**

As soon as she arrived, there was bound to be a spectacle! 

The girl in the green dress, surprised by the sudden turn of events, felt the whip’s handle slip through her fingers as two-thirds of it was firmly in her grasp. She quickly pulled it towards herself, as if they were engaged in a tug-of-war—each refusing to yield. Just as they were locked in this silent struggle, a deep, magnetic voice broke through the tension: “Cousin, are you causing trouble again?”

“Cousin, you’re here! I’m not causing any trouble; she’s the one who snatched my whip! I had my eyes on it first, but she just won’t let go and insists on fighting me for it!” The girl in green immediately released her hold and scampered over to the young man’s side, nuzzling against him like a child seeking comfort.

“Miss, do you enjoy speaking in contradictions? This whip was clearly mine first! I was here looking at it before you even arrived! Right, boss?” The young lady, holding the whip, glanced pointedly at the vendor.

“Who says so? My hand was on it first! Boss, don’t play favorites here—tell us, who rightfully deserves this whip?” The girl in green shot a threatening glare at the vendor.

“Um…” The vendor gulped nervously, feeling the weight of the situation. Both parties were formidable; he couldn’t afford to offend either of them, and this left him in a bit of a quandary.

“Boss, no need to say anything. I saw everything that happened just now. Cousin, it’s clear that this young lady saw the whip first. You’re the one trying to snatch someone else’s belongings. How many times have I told you? Don’t be so competitive!” The man with the charmingly deep voice reached up and gently tapped her on the head. Although his tone was filled with reproach, a hint of indulgent affection sparkled in his eyes.

“Cousin, how could you tap my head in front of all these people? That’s so embarrassing!” The girl in green glared up at him, protesting.

“No more nonsense, or I’ll send you back to the Golden Dragon Society,” he warned. His handsome face was striking, particularly with those deep, sharp eyes that resembled an eagle’s, keen and observant. It was evident to anyone watching that she harbored a crush on him, yet he treated her like a disobedient little sister.

“Alright, I won’t say anything more. Just don’t send me back!” The girl in green quickly covered her mouth with her hand and retreated to his side, obediently falling silent.
