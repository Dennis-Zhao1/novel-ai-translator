**Final Chapter! 15**

As General Xing mentioned the matter concerning Ziyan, his expression darkened, a flicker of anger flashing across his face. However, with so many people around, he refrained from losing his temper, opting instead to summon Helian Yicheng to discuss things privately in a guest room.

In the hall, everyone felt a shared sense of unease. Ziyan had already been brought in, standing beside Nangong Nuo’er, a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. Although she hadn’t been by General Xing’s side for long, she knew him well enough to understand his prideful nature.

“Ziyan, don’t worry. The prince will convince him,” Nangong Nuo’er reassured her, gently patting her shoulder.

“Mm.” Ziyan nodded, but when she looked up, she caught sight of Haoyue Liansi glaring at her with a ferocious intensity, as if she wanted to devour her whole. A chill ran down her spine.

“You wretched girl! I knew you had malicious intent! You will surely face retribution for what you’ve done! You’ve ruined my son!” Haoyue Liansi shouted at her, venom dripping from her words.

“You’re the one who should face retribution! Your son was complicit with Nangong Yulou in smuggling black jade ointment! Do you even have any idea how many lives were harmed because of your greed? You’ve profited off the suffering of others, and yet you can still eat and sleep soundly!” Nangong Nuo’er shot back, her voice laced with scorn.

“They only did it to keep the Nangong Manor afloat! They’re not at fault!” Haoyue Liansi bellowed defiantly.

“Fine, if you truly believe they’re innocent, then you can go ahead and file a complaint. You can seek justice for your son—it's your freedom and choice. Ziyan, let’s go.” Nangong Nuo’er, feeling a sense of futility, turned to leave. Just then, a cold and sinister voice sliced through the tension behind them.

“Nangong Nuo’er, you’ve caused our family so much suffering! You deserve to die!” A figure, glinting with malice, lunged toward her.

“Third Miss, watch out!” Xiaoxiao and the others shouted in alarm, recognizing the attacker as Nangong Qi’er. Her face twisted in rage, she brandished a sharp dagger, aiming it at Nangong Nuo’er’s back with a swift thrust.

Hearing the commotion behind her, Nangong Nuo’er remained calm. As everyone held their breath in anticipation, she suddenly spun around, her long legs kicking up just in time to meet Qi’er’s wrist. With a resounding clink, the dagger flew from Qi’er’s grasp, and a loud gasp escaped her lips as her wrist nearly dislocated from the force.

“Third Miss, are you okay?” After a brief moment of shock, Xiaoxiao and the others rushed over, concern etched on their faces.

“I’m fine. The one who should be concerned is her.” Nangong Nuo’er assessed her hand, which was probably swelling from the impact, then casually adjusted her slightly disheveled clothing, a serene expression on her face.

“Nangong Nuo’er!” Nangong Qi’er, now restrained by guards, spat her name out with a mixture of hatred and desperation.

“Those who commit wrongdoings will meet their own demise. Your brother has done enough evil; even without my interference, it’s only a matter of time before he faces consequences,” Nangong Nuo’er said, her gaze piercing into Qi’er’s eyes. She had her reasons to despise her, after all; it was her actions that had led to their downfall. Yet, she felt no remorse.
