**Chapter 6: She Made Her Move!**

She really did make her move!

Nangong Nuo’er clenched her fists, bringing them to her lips, and gently exhaled. Facing the dozen or so burly men rushing toward her, her expression remained unchanged; she was calm and collected, as if she were not confronting a group of opponents, but rather a gathering of friendly acquaintances.

The street was already packed with onlookers, all eager to witness the drama unfolding. They watched in disbelief as this small woman dared to take on such a formidable group. Many felt a cold sweat trickle down their spines for her, but they were just ordinary people. Even if they wanted to help, they didn’t dare to step in.

“Third Miss, please be careful! Oh heavens, bless our Third Miss, let her defeat them soundly!” Xiaoxiao clasped her hands together in prayer, while Xiao Qi anxiously watched the scene unfold, waiting for an opportunity to act.

As the tension in the air reached its peak, the fight erupted. Nangong Nuo’er stood her ground, calm and composed, as she settled into a horse stance. She wasn’t armed with any weapons; in fact, her only tools were her seemingly delicate hands, which were surprisingly packed with internal strength.

Her moves appeared slow at first, and just as the crowd thought she would be struck by their fists, her palms danced in a flurry of motion. Not only did she deflect their punches, but she also redirected their force, causing them to strike their own comrades instead.

“Wow, what kind of martial arts is Third Miss using? It looks slow, but it’s actually incredibly fast and versatile. I’ve never seen such an elusive style before,” Xiao Qi remarked in awe, realizing that she was handling herself perfectly.

“Whoa… Third Miss is so cool!” Xiaoxiao exclaimed, her previous worries melting away into admiration. Watching her single-handedly take on ten opponents made them feel utterly useless in comparison.

As the sounds of the thugs’ pained cries echoed through the air—like the anguished squeals of pigs—the crowd erupted into applause, unable to contain their admiration for Nangong Nuo’er. They cheered and gave her thumbs up, praising her prowess.

In less than fifteen minutes, all the burly men sprawled on the ground like defeated hounds, groaning and whining. They hadn’t just been bested by her, but had also inadvertently injured themselves with their own attacks, thanks to her skillful use of their own strength against them. Some were nursing bruised limbs and fractured ribs, a testament to her unmatched ability.
