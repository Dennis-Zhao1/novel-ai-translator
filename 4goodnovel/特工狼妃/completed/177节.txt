Her slender, pale fingers came to rest on the bedcover, and she couldn't help but splay them out, gripping the fabric tightly until her knuckles turned white.

“No, even if I’m truly possessed, I’m willing.” Regardless of whether he was under some spell or truly bewitched, he wanted her—there was no doubt about it. Even after the last angry words he had spoken, he regretted it almost immediately; he shouldn't have been so impulsive.

“You’re beyond saving.” Watching him so infatuated with her, Nangong Nuo’er felt at a loss for words.

“I’m willing.” Helian Yichen slowly reached out to unfasten her clothes, his heated gaze never leaving her face. Even in her expressionless state, to him, she was a stunning sight—one he could never tire of looking at.

Nangong Nuo’er breathed softly. She looked into his eyes as if trying to peer into his very soul. His gaze was sharp and dangerous, yet in this moment, it was so gentle and affectionate. Until now, this kind of look had only appeared in front of her.

“I’m truly willing to be possessed for you, to lose my mind over you.” Helian Yichen removed her clothing, his eyes drinking in the beautiful sight displayed before him. A hint of desire colored his deep purple gaze, and his heated stare roamed freely over her body.

Under his watchful gaze, Nangong Nuo’er lowered her eyelids. Her face appeared calm, but inside, her heart was anything but steady; it was racing out of control.

“Nuo’er, my Nuo’er.” Even though she acted so indifferent, it couldn’t mask her shyness. Helian Yichen waved his hand to draw the curtains, obscuring the vibrant scene that filled the bed, leaving only the faint moonlight to illuminate the cold room outside.

After arriving at the Nangong Manor with Nangong Nuo’er, Ziyan changed into the attire of a maidservant of the Nangong family. Once a favored concubine of a wealthy household, she had now fallen to the status of a maid serving others, yet she felt no regrets.

Her sole responsibility here was to attend to the Third Miss, Nangong Nuo’er. She didn’t have to worry about anything else, being new to the household. Xiaoxiao and Xiaoqi took special care of her, ensuring she didn’t have to perform any heavy labor, limiting her tasks to delivering clothes.

The atmosphere in the room was charged, filled with unspoken desires and the weight of their emotions, as the moonlight cast a gentle glow on the floor, illuminating the complex interplay between innocence and longing.
