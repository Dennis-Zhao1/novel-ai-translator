**No One May Insult Her! 2**

“What's wrong? Are you scared? Are you afraid that the real Nangong Nuo'er has met with misfortune? But have you ever considered that if she isn't the real Nangong Nuo'er, maybe she did something to the real one? Aren't you worried about the true Nuo'er, or are you only concerned about this fake one in front of you? Haha…” The woman in white suddenly burst into laughter, as if mocking him for his cowardice and inability to face the truth.

“Enough! Stop talking!” The man’s anger flared, his enchanting eyes flashing with a dangerous glint.

“Deep down, you’re doubting too, aren’t you? If not, you wouldn’t have so readily used the black feather ointment on her back then.” She continued her taunts fearlessly.

“You wretched woman, do you really not know when to stop? Do you think I wouldn’t dare to kill you?” In a blur, he moved, and a long, nearly perfect hand grasped her throat.

“You can kill me if you want, but I’ll tell you this: if something happens to me, someone will definitely expose your identity.” The woman in white was confident, knowing that dealing with a soulless character like him meant she had to have backup plans.

“Your thinking is truly naive. Ever since you approached me, every move you’ve made has been under my control. I know exactly where you’re staying, even which inn you’re at. Oh, and here’s an extra piece of information for you: your fiancé is already aware that you’re here, and his people are searching for you. You’ll need me to inform him where you’re hiding, and the mastermind behind the scheme against his woman is you.” He smirked coldly, tightening his grip around her throat. He was prepared to teach her a lesson for underestimating him.

“You… I’m a princess! Do you dare to kill me?” Caught off guard by his investigation, the woman’s face paled. Although fear coursed through her veins, she refused to succumb, holding onto her pride.

“Do you really think I wouldn’t? Want to test me, dear princess?” His enchanting eyes glinted with a fierce chill, his fingers tightening around her throat.

“Ugh… Let go… of me…” Caught by surprise at his willingness to act, the woman’s partially visible face was now filled with terror as she struggled desperately.

“Those who think they’re clever usually meet an early demise. Dear princess, remember in your next life not to be so self-important,” he warned coldly, and just as he was about to choke the life out of her, a flash of cold light shot through the air, targeting his face. Startled, he released her and dodged the lethal projectile.

“You filthy—cough… cough cough cough…” The woman, now on the ground, rubbed her throat, which felt like it had nearly snapped, and began to curse violently.

“Remember our agreement; if you say anything you shouldn’t, prepare for your entire clan’s annihilation.” The man turned to see that it was Helian Yichen and Tuoba Tianye who had arrived. A shadow of darkness crossed his gaze as he warned the woman before swiftly making his exit.
