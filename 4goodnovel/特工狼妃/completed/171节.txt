**Don't Resist Me! 1**

"Don't resist me!" 

A flicker of barely perceptible surprise flashed across her eyes. It was fleeting, but it was still caught by Helian Yichen's sharp gaze. He knew she liked it.

"Of course I care; you're mine, how could I not?" Helian Yichen had grown accustomed to her indifference. He was no stranger to her sharp retorts and cold demeanor. 

When he noticed her rubbing her thigh, he realized his guess was right. Her foot injury from the fight earlier had indeed affected her. He presented her with a stunning bouquet of vividly blooming flowers, saying, "This is for you. It's called the Seven-Color Rainbow Orchid. Its name comes from the fact that it emits a mesmerizing spectrum of light in the dark. Do you like it?"

A flower that could emit a spectrum of colors in the dark? Wasn't this flower already extinct? How did he get it? Nangong Nuoer had studied the history of Helian Country and had come across mentions of this flower, but the historical texts claimed it had long been extinct. How did he manage to find it? She couldn't help but gaze in astonishment at the miraculous bouquet in his hand; she thought she would never have the chance to see it.

"You must be curious about how I found this flower. You're right; the historical records say it's extinct. But by a stroke of luck, I discovered that there's still one last bouquet here, so I went out of my way to bring it to you."

Helian Yichen spoke casually, but what she didn't know was the effort he put into persuading the flower's owner to part with the Seven-Color Rainbow Orchid. He had noticed the longing in her eyes when she read about this flower, so when he heard rumors that someone possessed it, he did everything he could to convince that person to give it to him. He rarely asked others for favors, but for the sake of winning her favor, he made an exception.

"The last bouquet of the Seven-Color Rainbow Orchid." Wasn't it worth its weight in gold? How could he have managed to acquire it so easily? Nangong Nuoer looked at him, astonished.

"Well, do you like it?!" Helian Yichen waved his hand to extinguish the candle on the table. As the flame flickered out, the bouquet of Seven-Color Rainbow Orchids began to emit mesmerizing waves of colorful light, more enchanting than a sky full of fireflies, captivating and intoxicating.
