He Still Wanted to Take Advantage of Her! 11

"Let go of me! I don't want your embrace, put me down, do you hear me?" Nangong Nuo'er exclaimed, her fingers gripping the fabric of his shirt as she glared at him with fury. If he carried her back like this, he would undoubtedly discover her true identity, making it even harder for her to shake him off later.

"What I want to do is nobody’s business but mine. You'd better understand that," he replied, irritation lacing his voice. His grip was firm, and despite the pain radiating from her thighs, she still struggled against him. Did she not feel the pain? If she truly didn’t, why was her face so pale, her brows knitted so tightly? Cold sweat beaded on her forehead, and Helian Yichen couldn’t help but feel a flash of anger at her stubbornness. What an ungrateful woman.

"As long as it’s not related to me, I won’t stop you. But when it comes to my affairs, I have the right to refuse. Calling you a self-important pig is an understatement." She spoke with a chilling tone that matched his intensity. He could do whatever he wanted as long as it didn't involve her; that was all she cared about.

"Do you really want to go against me? I’m a pig, and you’re the pig’s woman," he shot back, recalling how she had been so warm to him that night. What had changed since the dawn broke? She had left without a word, and now their paths crossed again, with her standing against him. What was going on? Helian Yichen narrowed his eyes dangerously, a hint of violet gleaming within. No one could treat him like this—not even her.

"I’m not trying to oppose you; I simply don’t have the time for that. I’m not your woman, and I definitely don’t want anything to do with you." 

She scoffed defiantly, "Why would I want to oppose you? I have better things to do." 

"Sorry, little woman, but from the moment you offered yourself to me that night, we were destined to be intertwined," he retorted, a mix of irritation and determination in his voice. No matter her willingness, he had no intention of letting her go. For the first time, he felt what it was like to be thwarted, and he was not the type to back down easily.

"Hmph, I’m not a porcelain doll that you can keep in your palm without fear of it slipping away." Nangong Nuo'er replied coldly, a hint of provocation in her tone.
