### Chapter 3: What Are They Up To?

At the moment his whistle pierced the stillness, a rough cry from a black hawk echoed through the night sky, followed by a shadow streaking like lightning overhead, landing just above them.

“Why did you let it come along?!” Initially, she found the hawk too arrogant, and even now she still looked down on it. The hawk, in turn, seemed to share her disdain. Nangong Nuo’er shot a sideways glance at the black hawk hovering above and spoke with a hint of irritation in her voice.

“I’m worried something might go wrong later. Having it with us means it can alert me if there’s trouble,” Qin Tian replied, glancing at the hawk. With its presence, her danger would be lessened, at least by a fraction.

“Is that so?!” Nangong Nuo’er responded curtly, her tone devoid of enthusiasm as she fell silent.

The two moved in silence toward the river dock. As they approached, they noticed the dock was brightly lit, bustling with activity, and it seemed many people were busy hauling something.

“What’s going on over there at the dock? It’s already late, and they’re still unloading cargo?!” They were being far too enthusiastic, in her opinion. Nangong Nuo’er’s sharp gaze flickered; there was definitely something amiss with this shipment.

“That’s a ship from the Golden Dragon Society. The Fengshui Gang brought a batch of antique jade south from the north. The items are too valuable for them to use their own ships, so they rented one from the Golden Dragon Society,” Qin Tian explained. The Golden Dragon Society’s flag carried significant weight on the seas; their cargo ships had a reputation for never encountering problems.

“But if it’s just antiques and jade, why unload it at night?” This didn’t quite add up. Was the transport of antiques merely a cover? As Nangong Nuo’er pondered this, she keenly observed the scene unfolding before them.

“Third Miss, we should keep our distance. Did you notice? The area around the dock is filled with hidden archers,” Qin Tian whispered as they concealed themselves in a shadowy corner.

“Yeah, I noticed. If it were just ordinary goods, there wouldn’t be such a fuss. Qin Tian, is it your intention to investigate them while you’re here with your master?” Nangong Nuo’er lowered her voice, keeping an eye on the commotion ahead. She had initially thought they were here to investigate Nangong Mountain Manor, but the ones unloading at the dock weren’t from their family; it was the Fengshui Gang.

“It’s not just them. We investigate anything that seems unusual,” Qin Tian replied firmly.
