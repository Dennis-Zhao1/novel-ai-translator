**Chapter 5: He Still Wants to Take Advantage of Her!**

Despite not wanting to leave, the black eagle reluctantly took off at its master’s command. 

After releasing the black eagle, Nangong Nuo'er quickly hurried away, anxious that it might recognize her. Her palms were slick with cold sweat from the tension. Just as she believed she had evaded it, a powerful, commanding presence suddenly enveloped her from behind. A firm hand landed on her shoulder, and a low, magnetic voice followed, “Miss, wait a moment. Haven’t we met before?”

“You’ve got the wrong person. I don’t know you, so let go,” Nangong Nuo'er replied, her eyes narrowing as she felt his hand on her shoulder. In a flash, she attempted to grab his arm and throw him over her shoulder. However, his reflexes were quicker; before she could even pull him off balance, he had already seized her wrist.

“Are you really sure you haven’t seen me before? If you haven’t, why are you speaking to me with your back turned?” Helian Yichen twisted her hands behind her back, pressing his body closer against hers. He leaned down, inhaling the unique fragrance that surrounded her, a scent that had captivated him since that night. His warm breath brushed against her exposed skin, causing her to shiver involuntarily.

“Damn it, what do you want? Let me go!” His nearness sent shivers through her body, reviving memories of their intimate encounter from that night. Nangong Nuo'er felt her cheeks flush with heat. She struggled to push him away, only to discover the immense strength he possessed. In his grip, she felt like a helpless little rabbit caught in the claws of a wolf—there was no escape unless he chose to release her.

“I’m quite curious about what I want too. Do you know? After that night, you vanished without a trace, and I’ve been looking for you ever since.” He was entranced by her scent; ever since that night, he had yearned to see her again. It was a stroke of luck that he found her so effortlessly. Leaning against her delicate neck, he couldn’t resist pressing his heated lips against her cool skin.

“You… don’t do anything reckless! Please, let go of me!” As his warm kisses touched her skin, Nangong Nuo'er gasped sharply, her eyes widening in disbelief. Her body trembled slightly under his touch, caught in the whirlwind of emotions.
