**My Woman Doesn’t Need Anyone’s Concern!**

“If we can get our hands on the transaction ledgers of the Nangong family and the Fengshui Gang, we can pin the money laundering charges on them,” Tuoba Tianye said as he raised his glass and took a sip.

“The ledgers are probably in Nangong Xudan’s hands,” Helian Yichen said confidently.

“But it’s also possible that they’re with the leader of the Fengshui Gang. I doubt he would trust anyone else with them,” Tuoba Tianye replied.

“Don’t you think that if he’s not wise enough, he might actually trust them to keep it safe?” Helian Yichen raised an eyebrow.

“You mean… the most dangerous places are often the safest?”

“That’s possible, but even if we find the ledgers, we can only charge them with money laundering and smuggling of the black jade ointment. We still don’t have enough evidence for anything else,” Tuoba Tianye said, stressing the importance of solid proof.

“I have a way to make them reveal their true colors. Would you like to hear it?” Nangong Nuoer, who had been observing the terrain of the Fengshui Gang, pulled her gaze back and slightly smiled.

“Oh? I’m all ears,” Tuoba Tianye said, intrigued.

“I’m from the Nangong family—aren’t you afraid I might spill the beans?” Nuoer couldn’t help but wonder if they trusted her too much. After all, she was currently carrying the title of the Third Miss of the Nangong family, and they were so confident that she wouldn’t betray them.

“I think you’d be quite interested to know who got you addicted to the black feather ointment and who disfigured your maid,” Tuoba Tianye remarked with a calm smile. Although he hadn’t witnessed these events firsthand, they were not difficult for him to deduce.

“It seems you know quite a bit about me,” Nuoer said, her eyes flickering.

“We’re living under the same roof now; I’m just concerned for your well-being.” Seeing her composed demeanor, he couldn’t help but chuckle heartily.

“You can keep your concern to yourself. My woman doesn’t need anyone’s concern.” Before Nuoer could respond, Helian Yichen had already answered for her. His people didn’t need the sympathy of outsiders.

“Your Highness, we’re all in the same boat. We should support each other and show some concern,” Tuoba Tianye interjected.

“If you don’t want to sever ties with us, it would be wise to choose your words carefully,” Helian Yichen replied, a hint of a smirk on his lips. His tone might seem casual, but it carried an unmistakable warning.

“Alright, let’s cut the chit-chat. Let’s talk business. Didn’t Nuoer just say she had a way to deal with the Fengshui Gang? I’m very interested to hear it,” Tuoba Tianye asked, his curiosity piqued.

“Have you guys noticed the location of the Fengshui Gang?” Nuoer pointed towards their direction.

“That place is a bit dangerous. While it’s convenient for transporting goods, it’s prone to flooding,” Helian Yichen said, studying the Fengshui Gang’s direction.

“To prevent flooding, they’ve built the dam very high and sturdy,” Tuoba Tianye observed, gazing up at the imposing barrier.

“You’re both right,” Nuoer said, a cold smirk flashing in her eyes.

“And then? You’re not suggesting we flood the Fengshui Gang, are you?” Helian Yichen looked at her, surprised by the boldness of the idea.

“Exactly. If we flood the Fengshui Gang, their goods won’t be able to be traded due to your presence, and they’re likely still stored in their warehouses. You don’t have enough evidence to search, and even if you did, it would be too much of an operation. If word gets out, they’ll be prepared, and you’ll end up with nothing,” Nuoer explained, laying out her plan clearly.
