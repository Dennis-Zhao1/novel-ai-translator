**Final Chapter! 11**

“Are you really sure you want to take me back to the capital?” Looking into his deep, affectionate eyes, Nangong Nuo’er couldn’t help but hesitate. If she went back with him, he would inevitably be used by her, and sooner or later, she would have to hurt him.

“Well, it’s already been decided, hasn’t it?” His determination to take her back had never wavered.

“Do you even know what my identity is?” Was he really willing to take such a risk by bringing her back?

“Of course I know. You are my future princess,” he replied with resolute conviction.

“I mean my current identity. You should understand that I’m not the real Nangong Nuo’er. The person you love might just be an illusion, a fleeting shadow that could vanish at any moment.” What she had to do was in direct opposition to him, but if she didn’t do it, she would eventually be left with nothing.

“I don’t care about your past identity. All I know is that you are my princess, and I won’t let you disappear. I will hold onto you tightly.” With that, Helian Yichen abruptly pulled her into his embrace.

At that moment, Nuo’er wanted to voice her thoughts, but the words caught in her throat, and she remained silent.

Just then, Xiaoxiao and Xiao Qi rushed up from the mountainside, followed by Ziyan.

“Ziyan, you did a great job this time. You truly deserve my trust for taking you in,” Nuo’er said as she walked towards Ziyan and took her hand, expressing her gratitude.

“Third Miss, please don’t say that. I’ve told you I’m willing to do anything for you,” Ziyan replied without a hint of regret.

“Ziyan, I’m sorry for putting you in this position. The prince will plead with the general to release you, and you will follow me from now on.” Finding a loyal subordinate wasn’t easy, but Nuo’er felt incredibly fortunate.

“Thank you, Third Miss!” Ziyan exclaimed, overjoyed at the prospect.

“This is what you deserve. Prince, I’m counting on you regarding Ziyan’s situation,” Nuo’er said, turning to Helian Yichen.

“Are you so sure that I can persuade General Xing to let her go? He’s not an easy man to deal with,” he said, raising an eyebrow and smiling lightly at her.

“If you can’t handle something as small as this, I’ll really have to reconsider whether to go back to the capital with you,” Nuo’er retorted with a cold laugh, well aware of his capabilities. It wouldn’t be so easy to fool her.

“Looks like I won’t be able to push this matter aside.” Truthfully, he wasn’t incapable of resolving the situation; he merely wanted to temper her overly confident attitude. Unexpectedly, she had outmaneuvered him, leaving him to smile wryly.

“Ziyan, hurry up and thank the prince!” Nuo’er urged, completely unfazed by his eventual agreement.

“Thank you, Your Highness, for saving my life!” Ziyan stepped forward, filled with gratitude upon hearing that he was willing to stand up for her.

“I only want to make Nuo’er happy,” he replied, acknowledging that if it weren’t for her, he wouldn’t have bothered with the trouble.

“Regardless, both the prince and the Third Miss are my saviors. Thank you!” Meeting them was the luckiest thing that had ever happened to her.

“Alright, no need for further words. Let’s head back to the manor,” Helian Yichen said decisively. There were still matters to address, and with that, he led them down the mountain and back to Nangong Manor.
