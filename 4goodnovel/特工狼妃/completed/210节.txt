**Chapter 3: The Disfigurement!**

"Disfigured!" 

As the moonlight glimmered, Haoyue Liansi pulled a dazzling golden hairpin adorned with gemstones from her head, using it as bait to tempt her. 

"Second Madam, even if you offered me mountains of gold and silver, I still stand by my words—the Third Miss is truly not in any serious danger. She's just a bit tired and is taking a rest." The hairpin was beautiful and captivating, but it did nothing to sway her loyalty to Nuoer. She wouldn’t utter a single word against the Third Miss.

"Xiaoxiao, I’m even willing to part with my favorite golden jade hairpin. Are you really going to turn down my offer?" Haoyue Liansi's patience wore thin as she saw Xiaoxiao's lips sealed tighter than a clam. Anger bubbled to the surface.

"Second Madam, if there’s nothing else, I must take my leave." Xiaoxiao sensed the changing tides in Haoyue Liansi's expression, a foreboding chill creeping into her heart. She hurriedly turned to exit, but just as she did, a hand suddenly gripped her shoulder.

Before she could react, a blinding flash of gold flickered in front of her eyes. Instinctively, she shut them tight, but in that moment, a sharp pain shot through her face. She couldn’t help but let out a scream, pushing away the hand that had clutched her shoulder.

"Ah... it hurts! What did you do to me?!" After shoving Haoyue Liansi aside, she immediately reached up to touch her painfully throbbing face, only to find her fingers met with a warm, sticky trail of blood. Panic gripped her as she realized her hand was smeared with crimson.

The color drained from her face, and a bone-chilling cold enveloped her, as if the very essence of her warmth had been sucked away. In Haoyue Liansi's hand, the golden hairpin dripped with her blood.

"Hmph! You brought this on yourself for being so disrespectful. You little wretch! I am the Second Madam of the estate; my status far surpasses that of your Third Miss. How dare you treat me with such disdain! Your face will bear the scar from my golden hairpin forever, even if it heals, that ghastly mark will always remain. Let’s see if you dare to flaunt yourself again, ha ha..."

She had long harbored a grudge against Xiaoxiao, always looking for an opportunity to teach her a lesson. But due to Nangong Nuoer’s unwavering protection of her close ones, she had held back—until now. Finally, her wish had come true.

"Xiaoxiao, what’s happening?!" Just as Xiaoxiao stood frozen in shock, Xiao Qi, who had returned after escorting the doctor out of the estate, stumbled upon the scene of confrontation. 

In that moment, the tension in the air crackled with unspoken words, and Xiaoxiao's heart raced as she grappled with the pain and the shame of her disfigurement, the stark reality of her situation dawning upon her.
