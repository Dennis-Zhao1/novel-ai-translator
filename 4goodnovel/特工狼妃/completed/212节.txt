**No One Can Hurt You! 2**

No one can hurt you!

Even if, at this moment, she only regarded him as a lifeline, a wave of uncontrollable joy surged within his heart.

“Don’t…,” don’t hurt the people around her. Nangong Nuo gripped his hand tightly, her dry, pale lips repeatedly whispering her plea.

“Nuo, what do you mean don’t? Tell me, what do you want me not to do?!” Helian Yichen struggled to contain his excitement, leaning slightly closer to her ear, his deep voice laced with a seductive charm that seemed to draw her in.

“Don’t… hurt…” It was as if she heard his words, her voice coming out in broken murmurs that weren’t entirely coherent.

“Nuo, don’t worry. No one will hurt you again, not even me.” Helian Yichen believed she was dreaming of someone wanting to harm her. He held her trembling hand, feeling how cold it was, and it pained him deeply. He spoke in the most reassuring tone, close to her ear.

“No…,” it wasn’t someone who wanted to hurt her; it was about harming those around her. But she couldn’t see who it was. Her mind was filled with drifting white objects, and she struggled to wake up, but her eyelids felt as heavy as lead, making it impossible for her to open her eyes.

“Sweetheart, no one can hurt you. I will always be by your side, protecting you. Just sleep peacefully.” Helian Yichen coaxed her, his gentle kisses like feathers brushing against her brow, nose, cheeks, and finally resting on her pale lips. His kiss was so light, so soft, filled with infinite tenderness and heartache. It felt almost soothing, calming her emotions as she stopped struggling in her dreams, though her brows remained tightly knitted.

“What a stubborn little woman, yet so endearing.” Helian Yichen’s warm lips delicately traced her cold ones, as if trying to transfer his warmth to her. Only in her sleep did she show such vulnerability. When awake, even if hurt, she wouldn’t easily yield to him, let alone reveal any dependence on him.

Nangong Nuo felt dazed, unsure of how long she had slept. When she finally awoke, the sun had already begun its descent in the sky, casting a warm golden hue across the room.
