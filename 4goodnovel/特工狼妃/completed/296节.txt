**Final Chapter! Part 6**

"My wish is the same as many people's wishes; how can that be considered greedy?" Nangong Nuoer replied with a light smile. With a swift motion of her hand, the whip she held coiled towards him. While it was a convenient tool for her, her opponent wielded a soft sword and was a martial arts master. Aware that she was no match for him, she used the whip to push him back, then quickly darted towards the exit.

"I told you, you won’t be leaving this basement today," he declared, and before she could take more than a few steps, his soft sword forced her to retreat once again.

"Is that so? Then it seems I’ll have to disappoint you. Watch out for my hidden weapons!" With a flick of her sleeve, Nangong Nuoer sent a flurry of silver needles flying toward his vital points, reminiscent of celestial flowers dancing in the breeze.

"Hmph, just a trivial trick." Nangong Yulou didn’t take her hidden weapons seriously. Like a swift serpent, his soft sword swept toward the scattered silver needles, using his inner strength to control them before redirecting the tips back towards Nangong Nuoer.

Reacting quickly, she rolled to the side, narrowly avoiding the barrage of needles. The sound of metal clattering echoed as they fell harmlessly to the ground.

"Feel free to show me what else you’ve got," Nangong Yulou said, a mocking smile dancing in his enchanting eyes.

"Tch, don’t think dodging my needles makes you invincible," Nangong Nuoer slowly rose from the ground, a serene smile gracing her lips as if she were the one in control, not him.

"Even with death looming, you can still smile; I admire that," Nangong Yulou remarked, a hint of appreciation flickering across his face.

"I can smile because I do not believe I will die at your hands," she replied confidently.

"What do you mean by that?" Nangong Yulou’s heart trembled slightly at the strange expression on her face. Just then, faint sounds from outside caught his sharp attention, and he turned to see two figures gradually emerging into view.

"Nangong Yulou, you might as well surrender," came the voices of Helian Yichen and Tuoba Tianye.

Seeing Tuoba Tianye’s face filled with regret, Nangong Yulou suddenly chuckled.

"Nuoer, are you alright?" Helian Yichen rushed to Nangong Nuoer’s side, concern etched on his face.

"I’m fine. This is the transaction ledger of the Fengshui Gang. The mastermind behind it is Nangong Yulou, and Nangong Xudan is the one laundering money for the Nangong Manor," she explained, handing the ledger to Helian Yichen.

"With this ledger, Nangong Yulou, there's no escape for you now. The entire manor is surrounded by General Xing's men. You have nowhere to run; just surrender," Helian Yichen said, flipping through the contents of the ledger, a look of excitement growing on his face. Finally, this matter would come to a close.

"Tuoba Tianye, why?" Nangong Yulou ignored them, his fierce gaze betraying a hint of profound sadness.

**PS:** The editor has been targeting this book, previously claiming it dealt with sensitive themes and now accusing it of being vulgar. They’re just fixated on it, so I’ve decided to split it into two parts. Sigh… what a hassle…
