**Don't Touch Me! 6**

Herlian Yichen leaned down and placed a gentle kiss on her lips, then gazed deeply into her eyes before turning to leave.

“Hmph!” Watching his commanding figure walk away, Nangong Nuoer huffed softly. She clutched the blanket and turned toward the inner side of the bed. This was the bed he had slept in; every inch of the blanket and pillow was imbued with his scent. Strangely, she didn’t feel any aversion to it at all—rather, it was comforting, even soothing. She had thought it would be difficult to fall asleep in a bed that still held his essence, but she was wrong. Not long after he left, she gradually drifted off into a peaceful slumber.

In her dreamy state, Nangong Nuoer seemed to hear someone calling her name. Her spirit, seemingly unbound, began to drift away from her body. There was a powerful draw pulling her soul outward, and she didn’t know how long she floated through this ethereal space until a breathtakingly beautiful scene unfolded before her eyes, reminiscent of a fairyland.

“Nuoer, Nuoer, you’ve finally come.” Just as Nangong Nuoer felt a sense of wonder, a voice as gentle as flowing water echoed in her ears.

“Who is it? Who is calling me?” she asked, her heart racing at the beautifully soft tone that didn’t quite sound human. It stirred an indescribable sensation within her, a mix of familiarity and confusion. She was certain she had never heard this voice before. Why did it feel so known? Her gaze darted around in panic, seeking the source of the voice.

“Nuoer, you are me.” Just as Nangong Nuoer frantically searched for the speaker, a radiant figure began to descend from above, shimmering with a silver light. The brilliance was almost blinding, making it hard for her to keep her eyes open. Before her floated a woman who looked exactly like her.

“What? I am you? Ah! How can you look exactly like me? What’s going on?” Nangong Nuoer forced her eyes wide open to stare at the woman before her, shock overwhelming her.

The woman, with long, beautiful hair and wearing what appeared to be ancient clothing, exuded an ethereal presence that was hard to ignore. She seemed to float effortlessly, radiating an aura of divinity that made her appear otherworldly.
