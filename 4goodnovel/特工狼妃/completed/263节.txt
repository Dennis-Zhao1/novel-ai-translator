**He Wants to Take a Concubine! 7**

She was already feeling perplexed about the random choice of a vixen-like woman to serve as a maid, and now it seemed that this woman had ensnared her son's heart. Haoyue Lianxi immediately cast a resentful glance at Norrie, who appeared indifferent to the unfolding drama.

“Mother, I've made up my mind. Even if you oppose me, I will take Ziyan as my concubine,” Nangong Xudan declared firmly, his stance unyielding and resolute.

“No way! Our family is of a different standing. Even if she's to be a concubine, she must be a refined lady; otherwise, I will never agree!” Haoyue Lianxi's tone was just as adamant.

“Second Mother, I've heard that when you married my father, your backgrounds were mismatched too. Before you became my Second Mother, you were just a maid in the Nangong estate. So why can’t my elder brother take Ziyan as his concubine?” Norrie set down her chopsticks after finishing her meal. At that moment, Heliang Yichen, sitting beside her, kindly offered her a napkin to wipe her mouth, his considerate gesture igniting a spark of jealousy in Nangong Qian'er, who had just entered the dining hall.

“Nangong Norrie, this is a matter for our branch of the family, and it’s not your place to interfere. I still disagree,” Haoyue Lianxi snapped, her face turning pale as if someone had struck a nerve, her voice sharp and tense.

“I initially didn’t want to get involved, but since Ziyan is my maid and now your son is entangled with her, I have to step in. Elder Brother, if you truly have a sense of responsibility and honor as a man, you should take responsibility for this situation. You can't just enjoy the benefits and pretend nothing happened; the consequences will be severe, so think it through,” Norrie remarked, a semblance of a smile playing on her lips. Though her words seemed polite, the underlying threat was unmistakable.

“Mother, since Elder Brother likes Ziyan, just let him take her as a concubine. After all, she is just a maid,” Nangong Qian'er chimed in, surprised to hear such sensational news right after waking up. From the first moment she saw Ziyan, she sensed that the maid was exceptional, never expecting her brother would go so far as to risk his relationship with their mother to take her as a concubine.

“This is absurd! Our Nangong estate belongs to a reputable family; how can we just take an unknown maid as a concubine?”
