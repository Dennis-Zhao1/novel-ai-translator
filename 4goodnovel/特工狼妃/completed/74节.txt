**Bringing the Wolf into the House! Part 2**

“Sure thing, Miss! I’ll take this wheelchair design to Little Qi right away and have him find a craftsman to get it made,” Xiao Xiao exclaimed, excitement bubbling in her voice as she dashed off with the blueprint in hand.

“This place is such a hassle! We even have to design our own wheelchairs,” Nangong Nuo'er sighed, stretching her arms lazily. She then pulled a hefty history book detailing the chronicles of the Helian Kingdom from the table.

“Oh my gosh, what was the significance of that dream I had the other day?!”

At first, she thought the dream was merely a fleeting fantasy, but as she flipped through the pages of the history book, she stumbled upon a striking revelation: one of the monarchs of the Helian Kingdom from a millennium ago was indeed named Helian Nige. 

Moreover, the history book spoke of a mysterious artifact that was said to be incredibly powerful. Ever since a great battle a thousand years ago, this artifact had been hidden in the imperial palace’s forbidden grounds, accessible only to the emperor and the high priest of Helian Kingdom. No one else was allowed to approach that enigmatic sanctuary. Could this so-called artifact be the Celestial Zither?! But why was there no mention of it in the historical records? Was it because they felt guilty?

“Could it be that the historians chose not to record the Zither because they knew it had been obtained through dubious means?!” Nangong Nuo'er flipped to the page detailing Helian Nige’s battle against his enemies. According to the records, Helian Nige had obtained this artifact by sheer coincidence, yet the specifics of its acquisition were never elaborated upon.

“Was that dream I had really a message from my past life, a remnant of the celestial music? Am I truly just a fragment of her reincarnated soul? And is it true that I only have five years here?!”

Her mind was filled with a whirlwind of questions, but at that moment, there was no one around to provide answers. Unable to contain her frustration, she gently rubbed her aching temples. These queries were utterly bizarre—she had never believed in the supernatural, yet now she found herself grappling with these absurd notions, which felt incredibly daunting.

“That said, if the Celestial Zither is hidden in the imperial palace’s forbidden grounds and intruders are ruthlessly punished, isn’t it like sending me to my doom?! But come on, in ancient times, there were no heists or bombs; it shouldn’t be more dangerous than the gunfire of the twenty-first century, right? Whatever happens, I’ll cross that bridge when I get to it. How could storming the palace be any more perilous than breaking into the capital?!” With that thought, Nangong Nuo'er closed the history book, deciding to set this matter aside for now. The most pressing concern was to get her legs healed first.
