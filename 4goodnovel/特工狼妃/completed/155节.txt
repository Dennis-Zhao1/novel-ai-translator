She’s here, and the fun is about to begin!

"I've already paid for you, so consider this whip my little gift to you for our meeting, Miss Three. Please don't refuse my kind gesture," Tuo Ba Tian Ye said, flashing a friendly smile when he noticed the reluctant expression on her face.

"Why are you giving her a gift, cousin?!" Murong Lan Qin protested, feeling a twinge of jealousy. She liked that whip too; why wasn’t it being given to her?

"Here we go again," Tuo Ba Tian Ye shot her a warning look.

"Hmph, I like that whip too!" Murong Lan Qin pouted, feeling a bit wronged.

"That whip was chosen by Miss Three first. You can't just take it from her and then act all cute about it," he muttered to himself, regretting ever bringing her along.

"Fine, if she wants the whip that badly, she can have it. I'm leaving," Nangong Nuo Er said, placing the whip back with the vendor before turning to walk away.

Watching her abandon the whip and leave, Tuo Ba Tian Ye observed her slender figure and a thoughtful gleam flickered in his eyes. He had never encountered such a cold woman before. Hadn't she just said that the whip was important to her? Why was she so willing to let it go for Murong Lan Qin?

"Wait, she just walked away like that? She really doesn't know a good thing when she sees it. How rare for you to want to give her a gift, and she just turns it down," Murong Lan Qin couldn't help but voice her astonishment at how easily Nuo Er had given up on the whip.

"She doesn’t want this whip, and doesn’t that suit your fancy?" Tuo Ba Tian Ye replied, a hint of bemusement in his tone. Women were truly hard to understand.

"If she doesn’t want it, then I definitely don’t either! Cousin, let’s go explore somewhere else; this place isn’t fun at all!" Murong Lan Qin insisted, refusing to take something that someone else had discarded. That would be so tasteless!

"I came here with something to do. I don’t have the time to shop with you; let Cheng De take you around instead," Tuo Ba Tian Ye said, returning his gaze from where Nuo Er had disappeared.

"What could be so important that you need to get it done right away? You should take it easy today!" Murong Lan Qin argued, asserting her point. They had just disembarked, so they should take the time to familiarize themselves with the area and rest up a bit.

The atmosphere was charged with unspoken tension as Tuo Ba Tian Ye and Murong Lan Qin navigated their way through the bustling market, filled with vivid colors and enticing aromas. Each stall was a treasure trove of goods, but his mind seemed elsewhere, lingering on the enigma that was Nangong Nuo Er. What lay behind her icy demeanor?
