**"You Demon!"**

Nangong Nuo'er waved her hand, signaling for them to leave. She couldn't understand why Nangong Yulou wanted to harm her, nor could she fathom what Helian Yichen's purpose was in investigating the smuggling case of the black jade ointment. Could it be that he was behind it all?

The night was as silent as water, the only sound being the faint rustle of leaves as the silver moon cast its luminous glow over the earth. In the stillness of the forest, the distant cawing of crows echoed, adding a chilling touch to the already eerie atmosphere. Under the haunting silver light, a tall figure stood hidden among the trees, as if a ghost blending into the darkness. He wore a long black robe that fluttered with the night breeze, his face obscured by a terrifying Shura mask. His eyes, which should have been clear and bright, now held a wicked, demonic allure.

"Why?!" A woman's voice, filled with indignation, broke the silence as she confronted the masked man, her face partially hidden beneath a veil. Though her features remained concealed, the fury in her tone made it clear just how enraged she was.

"Are you asking why? Is it because you know that Nangong Nuo'er has figured out she’s been drugged, or because you’re aware that Helian Yichen has returned to her?" Compared to the woman's agitation, the man remained eerily calm. A slight smirk played at the corners of his lips, his expression a chilling blend of mockery and allure.

"You promised that your black jade ointment was specially made, that even those familiar with it would struggle to detect it! How could she realize it after only a few doses? Even worse, you assured me he would leave her because of this! What do you have to say now?!" The woman glared at him, her eyes blazing with anger. She had orchestrated so many schemes, yet all her efforts had come to naught. How could she not be furious?

"On this matter, I believe the fault lies not with me, but with your failure to administer the medicine on schedule. The concoction I provided you was meticulously crafted, infused with substances designed to distract her. If you had given it to her consistently, she would have remained oblivious until her rationality completely slipped away. I reminded you numerous times about maintaining the timing of her doses. Now that she has discovered the truth, the blame rests with you, not me."
