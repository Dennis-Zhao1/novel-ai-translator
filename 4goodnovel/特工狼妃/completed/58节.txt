### Chapter 2: Undress in Front of Her

“Woke up? Is there something you need?” Nangong Nuo’er heard his voice and her eyes flickered slightly. To be honest, Nangong Xudan was quite nice to her, but she couldn’t understand why she just didn’t like him. From the bottom of her heart, she felt no affection for him; even dealing with him felt tedious.

“I have something I want to discuss with you, little sister. I’ll just go in and talk,” Nangong Xudan said, pushing the door open without waiting for her permission once he realized she was awake.

“What do you want? Just say it quickly.” Seeing him enter her room without consent, a displeased expression crossed Nangong Nuo’er's face. Did he think this was his room? He could just waltz in whenever he wanted?

“Little sister, are you really going to marry the prince as a concubine? With your qualifications, you shouldn't have to demean yourself by becoming someone else’s concubine,” Nangong Xudan stepped closer to her, acting as a mediator for his own selfish reasons—he didn’t want his beloved little sister to leave him.

“If brother is here to persuade me not to marry him, then I think you’ve chosen the wrong person to persuade. I never said I was willing to be his concubine.” All of this was decided by Helian Yichen alone; she had no right to refuse. If she had a choice, she wouldn’t want to marry him as a concubine either. But did she have any choice? Nangong Nuo’er replied coldly.

“Well then, if you don’t want to marry him, why does he insist on having you?” Nangong Xudan’s voice carried a hint of reproach. He frowned at her; although the Nangong family wasn't a prestigious household, they were well-off. What was a mere prince to them? Other than that hollow title, he was nothing more.

“I’d like to know why he insists on me too. If brother knows the reason, please tell me so I can understand what he finds appealing about me. I can change.” Nangong Nuo’er rubbed her temples, which were beginning to ache, and said with a hint of exasperation.

“So, you’re saying the prince is forcing you? Little sister, is it true that he’s forcing you? If you really don’t want to marry him, I can help you find a way out,” Nangong Xudan said excitedly, gripping her shoulders as he pressed her for an answer. He still had a chance; this was great! As long as she said she didn’t want to marry the prince, he could find a way to keep her from leaving.
