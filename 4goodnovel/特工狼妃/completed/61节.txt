**Chapter 5: In Front of Her, Remove Your Clothes!**

Nan Gong Xu Dan didn't want to leave, but since she had already issued an eviction notice, he felt awkward lingering any longer.

“Tsk, your brother is really annoying,” Helyan Yi Chen openly expressed his irritation after Nan Gong Xu Dan departed.

“Believe me, I feel the same way,” she replied, having only been in this place for a short while and already finding her so-called older brother more bothersome than anyone else. She had sent him away several times right in front of his face, but unfortunately, he seemed to have a particularly thick skin, utterly oblivious to the fact that her actions indicated her annoyance.

“I have to wonder if you two are really siblings,” Helyan Yi Chen mused. Nan Gong Xu Dan was too overly protective; sometimes his gaze made her uncomfortable, as if he viewed her as someone coveted by others. Helyan Yi Chen reached out, gathering a handful of her silky hair to his nose, inhaling the fragrant scent that he found utterly irresistible.

“If I weren’t adopted, I would indeed be his half-sibling,” Nan Gong Nuo Er replied coolly, observing the way he was lost in the aroma of her hair, as if it were some enchanting perfume. A flicker of disdain crossed her eyes.

“But I don’t think he looks at you the way a brother should look at his sister. It’s as if you weren’t adopted at all. You two don’t even resemble each other,” Helyan Yi Chen’s voice was soft, yet there was an undeniable authority in his words that left no room for argument.

“Didn’t anyone tell you that I have amnesia? I’ve forgotten everything about Nan Gong Manor,” Nan Gong Nuo Er said expressionlessly.

“You’ve lost your memory? That’s fine. Just remember that in this new beginning of yours, I’m here. You don’t need any extra memories,” Helyan Yi Chen paused, his handsome face revealing an indifferent expression that carried a hint of danger.

This man was way too domineering!!! Nan Gong Nuo Er was at a loss for words in response to his proclamation.

Just as she was casting a disdainful glance at Helyan Yi Chen, Xiao Xiao returned, cradling a bowl of porridge.

“Third Miss, your leg is injured. The doctor advised you to eat something light. It’s not mealtime yet, so I had the cook prepare a bowl of porridge for you to fill your stomach,” Xiao Xiao said, approaching the bedside with the steaming bowl.
