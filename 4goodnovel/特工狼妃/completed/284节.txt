**She’s Just Waiting to See His Show! 2**

"Norah." Standing nearby, Hélian Yìchén was just as surprised as anyone else that Nángōng Norah had actually hit someone. She acted quickly, and by the time he decided to intervene, it was far too late. With a heavy sigh, he gazed at the clear palm print on Yàoqíng's face, feeling a mix of frustration and helplessness.

"You wicked woman... Yìchén, aren't you going to do anything? She hit me!" Yàoqíng covered her face, tears brimming in her eyes, looking pitiful as she turned to Hélian Yìchén for support.

"My apologies, Your Highness," Nángōng Norah said, her tone dripping with sarcasm. "I couldn't control my emotions and accidentally slapped your fiancée." A smirk played at the corners of her lips, as if she relished the unfolding drama.

"Yàoqíng, you started this by insulting her first. You have no right to meddle here. Why don’t you just go home?" Hélian Yìchén shot a sidelong glance at the troublesome woman, his annoyance evident. He knew she was provoking him, waiting for him to react.

"Yìchén, you’ve changed. You’re being bewitched by this vixen..." Yàoqíng continued, but as she spoke, she noticed Nángōng Norah raising her hand again, thinking she was about to strike her once more. Yàoqíng instinctively raised her hands to shield her face, heart racing with fear.

"I'm just trying to smooth my hair. Why are you so scared? Go on, keep insulting me. I'm all ears," Nángōng Norah said, raising her hand to tousle her unruly locks, her expression betraying a hint of amusement at Yàoqíng's reaction.

"You... you shameless witch! I’m going to slap you!" Realizing she’d been toyed with, Yàoqíng’s fury boiled over, and she raised her hand to strike, anger coursing through her.

"Yàoqíng, that’s enough. Don’t embarrass yourself here." Nángōng Norah didn’t flinch or defend herself; she stood there with an unshaken demeanor as if a mountain could crumble before her, her calmness only infuriating Yàoqíng further. Hélian Yìchén saw right through her façade; she was clearly waiting for him to intervene, knowing he could never stand by and watch her get hit.

"Yìchén, she hit me, and you do nothing! I try to hit her, and you stop me? You’re so cruel to me, boo-hoo..." With her wrist caught mid-air by his hand, Yàoqíng finally realized that in Hélian Yìchén’s eyes, she was far less significant than Nángōng Norah. Overwhelmed by feelings of injustice, she broke down into tears.

"She looks like just a little girl, but her heart is rather vicious. Whatever, I won’t stoop to arguing with a child. Let’s go," Nángōng Norah said dismissively, turning on her heel to leave. She had intended to settle the score with Yàoqíng, but the sight of her sobbing only added to her irritation.

What did she mean by that? Did she know about everything I’ve done? Yàoqíng paused, her tears momentarily forgotten as confusion took hold.

"Stop acting like a spoiled child. You’re not that young anymore; you need to take responsibility for your actions. I could pretend your past misdeeds never happened, but from now on, stay away from Norah. She’s not someone you can provoke," Hélian Yìchén warned, casting one last glance at the retreating figure of Nángōng Norah before turning back to Yàoqíng.

"What are you talking about? When did I ever provoke her? You two are the ones who are messing around behind my back, and now you’re accusing me of things? Where’s your humanity?" Yàoqíng shouted in anger, her voice echoing in the tense air.
