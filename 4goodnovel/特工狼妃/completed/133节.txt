**Kicked Off the Bed!**

With a swift motion, she kicked him off the bed!

“Ugh…” The whirlwind of excitement combined with the dull ache radiating through her body was almost overwhelming for Nango No'er. Desperate to push him away, she felt an unsettling emptiness the moment he left her, as if a swarm of ants were gnawing at her heart.

In her dazed state, time lost its meaning. Eventually, as Nango No'er began to regain consciousness, she felt a heavy fatigue saturate her limbs. Her head throbbed with a lingering dizziness, prompting her to instinctively rub her temples. But as she lifted her hand, a sudden chill coursed through her, making her frown. Slowly, she opened her eyes.

Her gaze landed on a man’s bare chest, and she gasped sharply, a wave of panic crashing over her. What the hell had happened?!

“No'er, you’re awake! How do you feel?” Almost as soon as Nango No'er opened her eyes, Helian Yichen had stirred from his slumber as well. It was midnight, and the outside world was cloaked in darkness, but fortunately, the room was lit with soft lamps.

“Damn it! How did you get here? Who gave you permission to sleep in my bed?!” Furious, she realized the pain radiating from her lower body was undeniable evidence of what they had done together. Enraged, Nango No'er snatched a thin blanket and rolled away from him into the inner side of the bed.

“No'er, have you forgotten? You were the one holding onto me so tightly! Your enthusiasm was quite flattering,” Helian Yichen observed her fiery expression with amusement. It had been ages since he’d seen her so upset, and now that he had, he found himself surprisingly nostalgic. The sight of her flushed cheeks captivated him.

“You… What nonsense are you talking about? When did I ever cling to you like that? If you keep babbling, I swear I’ll kill you! I wouldn’t want you to like me!” Panicking, Nango No'er realized her clothes were nowhere to be found. She glanced around the bed but only saw disarray. Then, looking down, she cursed under her breath; her clothes, along with his, lay haphazardly on the floor.

“I’m not lying! I’m only speaking the truth. Have you really forgotten what happened during the day? But I don’t mind reminding you—besides, do you really think you could bring yourself to kill me?!” 

With that, the tension in the room thickened, and Nango No'er’s heart raced as memories began to resurface, tangled in confusion and frustration.
