**"Don't Resist Me!" Part 2**

"How beautiful, how stunning." She didn’t answer his question directly, but her words clearly conveyed her feelings. Gazing at the strange, alluring glow that was even more captivating than modern lights, the coldness on Nangong Nuo'er’s face was replaced by a rare joy.

"This flower has a peculiar nature. Its life is intertwined with its owner’s. I’m giving it to you now. As long as your life endures, it will endure too. If you’re in a good mood, it will bloom even more vibrantly." It was like a mirror, reflecting its owner's emotions accurately. At that moment, the flower was blooming brilliantly, indicating that its owner was in high spirits. A smile unconsciously curled on Helian Yichen's lips; as long as she was happy, his efforts were not in vain.

"Is it really that magical?!" She had thought the historical accounts exaggerated, never expecting it to be true. She hadn’t considered for a moment that it could actually work this way.

"Of course! If it weren’t for its extraordinary powers, why would everyone be fighting over it?" Helian Yichen sighed with a chuckle. If it weren’t so sought after, it wouldn’t be on the brink of extinction.

"Why would you give something so precious away?!" Nangong Nuo'er looked at him, perplexed. Such a valuable treasure, and he was willing to part with it?

"Because you like it. Whatever it is that you love, I will find a way to get it for you." This seven-colored flower was indeed extraordinary and precious, but it paled in comparison to her smile. At that moment, she meant more to him than anything else. Helian Yichen gazed deeply at her, unable to comprehend why he was so drawn to her or why he cared so much, yet he willingly fell for her charm. It felt as if they had known each other forever, as if they had been lovers who lost each other during the world's ruin, and now, against all odds, had found their way back to one another. No matter what, he would never give her up.

His words plunged her into silence. Why was he being so kind to her? After having hurt her so deeply, how could he still utter such noble sentiments? She still harbored lingering thoughts about that night, but in this moment, Nangong Nuo'er’s heart was in turmoil.
