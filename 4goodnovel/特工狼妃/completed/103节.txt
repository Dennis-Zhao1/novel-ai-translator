**Has She Become Addicted...?**

The only response she received was a series of steady breathing sounds. Nangong Nuo’er knew he had fallen asleep. She whispered towards the outside, “Xiaoxiao, Xiao Qi, the prince is asleep now; you can come in.”

Waiting for her command outside were Xiaoxiao and Xiao Qi. Upon hearing her call, they tiptoed into the room, gently nudging Nangong Nuo’er out, carefully making their way towards the back mountain until they arrived at a small, abandoned wooden cabin.

Xiao Qi pushed open the door of the cabin and lit a candle, while Xiaoxiao helped Nangong Nuo’er inside. Inside the cabin, there was a wooden bed with a large bundle of thick rope resting upon it. Once they placed her on the bed, Xiaoxiao and Xiao Qi swiftly bound her limbs with the coarse rope and secured it to the bedposts.

“Third Miss, when will you be better? It’s already been two or three nights; I’m worried you might not be able to hold on much longer,” Xiaoxiao said, tying the rope tighter, unable to suppress the sadness in her voice.

“I don’t know when I’ll be free from this, Xiaoxiao. Don’t be upset; if I don’t do this, I’ll suffer even more in the future. Don’t worry, I’m much stronger than you think. I won’t be in any danger,” Nangong Nuo’er lay on the wooden bed, quietly allowing them to secure her tightly.

“Third Miss, why don’t you let the prince know? He might have a way to save you,” Xiao Qi’s face bore the same heavy expression. The suffering the Third Miss endured was something even a strong man would find hard to bear, yet she faced it alone each night. He truly wanted to tell the prince about her plight; at least with his support, she wouldn’t be alone in her pain.

“No, absolutely not! I can’t let anyone find out.” How could she let him know that, in truth, she was an addict?!

Don’t think that just because she was hidden away in her secluded chamber, she was unaware of everything. Ever since he was injured, she had replayed countless thoughts in her mind about his true intentions for sneaking into Nangong Mountain Manor. That day, when she inadvertently overheard his conversation with Qin Tian, she had already guessed the purpose of his visit. And the things he spoke to the doctor only confirmed her suspicions. Therefore, she absolutely couldn’t let him know that her medicine and nourishing soups had been secretly tampered with. If it hadn’t been for that day when she missed her dose and was struck with a severe headache, she might have continued to be oblivious.
