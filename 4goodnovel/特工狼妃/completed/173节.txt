**Don't Resist Me! 3**

No matter what, she was moved. As long as he could evoke some emotion in her, all his efforts would be worth it. A satisfied smile played at the corners of Helian Yichen's lips as he placed the bouquet of radiant seven-colored lilies into a vase in the room. Even without turning on the lights, the flowers' bioluminescence illuminated the space, casting a vibrant glow that felt like stepping into an unreal fairy tale.

“Nu’er, I was too impulsive last time, and I was wrong. What can I do to earn your forgiveness?!” He knew she was still brooding over that night’s events. Helian Yichen sat down beside her, acknowledging that he shouldn’t have rushed to judgment without understanding the situation. He never admitted wrongs to women, but this time, he genuinely wanted to apologize.

“How could I blame you? You're a dignified prince, and I'm just an ordinary commoner. Your Highness, if you want to play, you've had your fun. Please let me be.” The bed shifted slightly under his weight, his masculine scent wafting into her nostrils, causing her to stiffen momentarily. When he gifted her the seven-colored lilies, she had felt a flicker of warmth in her heart.

But… Nanguang Nu’er sighed softly. This man's heart was too fickle; one moment he was one way, the next another. She couldn’t decipher him. At that moment, she sought nothing more than to fully recover from her injury, to stop relying on the black jade ointment, and then return to the capital to retrieve her qin. Once she accomplished that, she could go back to her original world, convincing herself that everything that had transpired here was merely a dream.

“No, I won’t let you go. I’m not just playing around; I’m serious about you, Nu’er. I know I’ve hurt you, but I hope you can give me one chance to make things right.” 

This was the first time he had opened up so vulnerably to a woman. How could she think he was just looking for a fling? If he didn’t genuinely care for her, why would he go to such lengths to procure the rare seven-colored lilies just to win her favor? Helian Yichen reached out, wrapping his arms around her from behind, holding her tightly as if he wanted to meld her into his very being.

“Didn’t you say that no matter how much you like me, you’d never marry a drug addict? Have you forgotten? But it’s fine; let me remind you—I am a drug addict, and my cravings are still present. You’re here to investigate this matter on behalf of the court. If you get involved with me, do you think the emperor will let you off the hook?” Did he not fear that she would tarnish the royal family's reputation? Nanguang Nu’er did not push him away; she merely stiffened in his embrace.
