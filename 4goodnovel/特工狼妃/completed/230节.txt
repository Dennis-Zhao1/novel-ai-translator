**Let Me Stay and Accompany You! 2**

Who could blame her for catching his eye? Once he set his sights on a woman, there was no way he would let her slip away from his side. No matter how elusive she might be, he would find a way to keep her firmly anchored to him. Helian Yichen tightened his grip around her waist, pulling her closer as if he feared she might suddenly vanish from his embrace.

“No! It’s clearly you who…” Nangong Nuo’er began to retort, but her eyes flickered as a wave of dizziness washed over her. The warmth that enveloped her began to ebb away, leaving her feeling cold; a throbbing pain started in her head, and her complexion paled rapidly. She suddenly pushed Helian Yichen away with urgency, her voice strained, “I just want to be alone for a while. Please, just step outside for a moment.”

“Nuo’er, what’s wrong? Your hands are freezing!” Helian Yichen was taken aback by her sudden shove. He quickly reached for her hands, only to find them icy cold. Panic surged within him as he grasped her hands tightly, concern etched on his face. “What’s going on?”

“Stop asking questions, just go! Hurry!” Nangong Nuo’er fought to maintain control over her swirling thoughts. She pushed against him with all her might, desperate to force him out of the room. But he stood his ground, like an immovable mountain, and no matter how hard she pushed, he wouldn’t budge. Frustration bubbled inside her, and she felt the urge to strike him.

“Nuo’er, what’s really happening to you?” Helian Yichen scanned her face, noting the dark shadows under her eyes, her pale lips, and the shallow breaths she struggled to take. Suddenly, realization dawned on him. With a swift movement, he pulled her back into his warm embrace, his voice heavy with concern. “Let me stay with you during this time.”

“No… please, just go. I don’t want anyone to see me like this.” Especially not him. She couldn’t understand why, but the thought of him witnessing her in such a vulnerable state filled her with dread. His embrace was spacious and warm, yet… she couldn’t allow herself to become attached. Nangong Nuo’er began to struggle, pushing against him in a desperate attempt to make him leave.

“Nuo’er, I won’t abandon you when you’re suffering. Let me stay by your side. I don't want to only see the beautiful side of you.” Helian Yichen’s heart ached for her. He wanted to share in her pain; when her withdrawals struck, he wanted to stand by her, offering support and strength. He allowed her to hit him, believing that if releasing her frustration through physical blows could ease her suffering, he would gladly bear the burden.

As the tension filled the air, their fates intertwined in a moment of raw vulnerability, a silent promise lingered between them, destined to be tested as the night unfolded.
