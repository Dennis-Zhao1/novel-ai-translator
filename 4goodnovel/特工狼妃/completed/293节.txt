**Chapter 1: Caught in a Heavy Kiss!**

Caught in a heavy kiss!

However, if she was truly intent on impersonating Nora, she should have been intimately familiar with Nora’s likes and habits. Even if she claimed today that she disliked osmanthus cake, it didn’t necessarily mean anything. If she really was someone else, what was her purpose in infiltrating the manor?

“Yulou, what’s got you so lost in thought?” Just as Nangong Yulou was deep in contemplation, a handsome yet resolute face suddenly appeared before him, startling him so much that the piece of wood he was holding slipped from his grasp.

“Were you thinking about me so hard that you lost your mind?” Just before the wood hit the ground, a long leg expertly kicked it back up, and in the blink of an eye, the wood landed firmly in his strong hand. This entire sequence of movements was smooth and fluid, followed by a teasing remark that rolled off his sensuous lips.

“Has anyone ever told you that your skin is thicker than a cutting board?” Coming back to his senses, Nangong Yulou couldn’t help but twitch the corner of his mouth at the cocky display, feeling disdain for this self-assured, reckless demeanor.

“Well, if you’re included in that count, then yes. What were you thinking about just now? Care to share? Were you fantasizing about me, or were you plotting how to sell off your shady goods?” Tuoba Tianye placed the piece of wood aside, suddenly leaning in closer, his voice low and husky as it brushed against Yulou’s ear.

“Tuoba Tianye, I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t like people getting this close to me.” Nangong Yulou’s expression shifted dramatically at his words, and he immediately pushed him away, his gaze turning icy as he stared at him.

“You don’t know what I’m talking about? You don’t need to paint the tiger without its bones. I know you understand, so there’s no need to pretend otherwise. People like that are just hypocrites,” Tuoba Tianye replied, a half-smile lingering on his face.

“What exactly do you want? If you have evidence, feel free to report me. If you don’t have anything else, don’t get in the way of my work,” Nangong Yulou snorted coldly, then picked up the piece of wood that Tuoba had set aside, returning to his tasks.

“Nangong Yulou, why are you so stubborn? Just listen to me and destroy your goods. Otherwise, you’ll be in trouble sooner or later.” Nangong Yulou scanned the surroundings, ensuring no one was watching before he grabbed Tuoba’s arm, his tone taking on a harsher edge.

“Are you trying to warn me?” Nangong Yulou’s eyes widened in surprise as he looked up at him.

“I just don’t want to see you get hurt.” Under the weight of Yulou’s surprised gaze, Tuoba Tianye felt a tinge of embarrassment.

“If the prince finds out you’re betraying him, he certainly won’t let you off the hook,” Nangong Yulou said, his cold eyes softening slightly as he regarded him. This man, wasn’t he here for the same purpose as the prince? How could it be…

“Are you worried about me?” Tuoba Tianye noticed the warmth in his eyes and a hint of surprise flitted across his face.

“You’re quite the oddball,” Nangong Yulou responded, avoiding the question entirely and throwing out a non sequitur.

“Odd? I don’t think I’m odd at all.”

“I don’t have any connection to you, not even a semblance of familiarity. Why would you help me? And you still wonder why I think you’re odd?”
