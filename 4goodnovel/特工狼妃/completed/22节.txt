**The Little Pixie Who Stole His Clothes! 2**

Helian Yichen carefully wrapped a few strands of hair in a handkerchief and tucked it away into his pocket. Only then did he begin to gather the clothes that had been scattered across the sandy ground, now dried by the sun. As he put on the inner garments, he realized that his outer robe was missing.

“Having stolen my night, you’ve also taken my outer robe? You’d better pray I don’t find you. Otherwise, you’ll learn the consequences of taking what doesn’t belong to you.” Helian Yichen squinted slightly, a dangerous glint flashing in his deep-set eyes.

At that moment, a sharp, cold cry pierced the air. Hearing the sound, Helian Yichen raised an eyebrow and tilted his head back toward the source of the noise, letting out a low, prolonged whistle.

Before long, a dark shadow swooped down from the sky. It was a jet-black eagle that descended with pinpoint accuracy, landing on Helian Yichen’s shoulder.

Simultaneously, a figure clad in black shot toward him like a meteor from afar. The person knelt on one knee before him and respectfully said, “Reporting to you, Master.”

“Qin Tian, how many times have I told you? No need for such formalities when we’re outside. Have you gathered the information I asked for?” Helian Yichen narrowed his eyes, fixing a dangerous gaze on Qin Tian, who knelt before him.

“Yes.” Qin Tian rose from the ground and continued, “I’ve found out everything you asked me to.”

“Good. Since we have the details, our next destination is the Nangong Manor for a visit.” A strange light flickered in Helian Yichen’s dark eyes, and he couldn’t help but show a hint of interest on his face.

“Master, where is your outer robe?” Noticing that his master was only wearing the inner garments, Qin Tian hesitated before bravely inquiring.

“Stolen by a little pixie.” A smirk danced at the corners of Helian Yichen’s lips, half-smiling, yet his eyes sparkled with a hunter’s predatory gleam.

Someone actually managed to steal the Master’s clothes? Qin Tian was momentarily stunned. This was quite an unexpected turn of events.

After the maid, Xiaoxiao, helped Nangong Nuo'er change, she looked down at the cumbersome outfit she had on, her brows furrowing so tightly that one could almost imagine them crushing a fly.
