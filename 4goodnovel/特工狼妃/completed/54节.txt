**Bizarre Dreams! Part 2**

"However, he took the divine harp for himself and turned it into the sacred artifact of his nation. Without the harp, I can't return to the heavenly realm. I went to retrieve it from him, but he had his priests seal me in this place. He deceived me," said the ethereal figure, her voice trembling with emotion as a spark of determination ignited in her eyes.

"Are you saying you want me to help you steal the harp back?" Nan Gong No'er finally grasped the weight of her words, realization dawning upon her. It became clear that there was a purpose behind her presence here.

"It's not stealing; it's reclaiming. The harp rightfully belongs to me, but Helian Nige took it for himself. You need to go and take back what is ours," the figure urged, her excitement palpable. It was clear that the notion of theft should apply to Helian's people.

"You say I am part of you? I don’t understand," No'er replied, perplexed. What did she mean? What connection did they share?

"I am trapped here, unable to leave. The only way I can escape is by sending a fragment of my soul into the world, allowing you to be reincarnated. I guided you to the twenty-first century so you could learn the skills you need. Now is the time for you to fulfill your mission. No'er, you only have five years. If you fail to retrieve the harp within that time, you will cease to exist. So you must act swiftly," the figure warned, her tone serious yet soft.

"What? Five years? Why would I disappear? Was my arrival in this world all orchestrated by you?" Nan Gong No'er felt her heart race, as if every drop of blood had frozen in her veins. It turned out she hadn’t stumbled into this world through some time-travel tunnel, but rather, there were divine forces orchestrating her fate. She had already felt trapped in her modern life; now, it seemed she was still bound by the strings of destiny. She felt a surge of frustration.

"You are a reincarnation of a part of my soul, and your task is to help me reclaim the harp and assist me in returning to the celestial realm. I can only grant you five years; you must seize this opportunity, or you will disappear forever," the figure reiterated, her voice gentle but piercing, echoing in No'er’s ears like thunder. It was a bitter truth—her existence was merely a pawn in someone else's game.

"If I help you get the harp back, what will happen to me?" No'er asked, her gaze steady on the figure. Her emotions had leveled out; now, she simply wanted to know what her fate held.
