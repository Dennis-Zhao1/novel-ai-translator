**Her Monthly Cycle Has Arrived, Which Means She's Not Pregnant! 2**

"Well, she’s adapting quite well and is very diligent. However, she doesn’t look much like a maid who handles heavy labor," said Serena Zhou, observing the newcomer. The girl had delicate skin and slender fingers, giving off an air of someone who had never touched a drop of hard work. Serena wouldn’t dare assign her any heavy tasks, so she only gave her the simplest chores.

"She used to be a concubine from a wealthy family, so of course, she doesn’t resemble a common maid," replied her friend, Leo Sterling, casually. "Just keep an eye on her."

"Of course, Third Miss," came the reply. Though it wasn't necessary for Leo to remind her, she was already paying close attention.

"Third Miss," just then, a voice came from outside the door. 

"Xiao Qi, come in," Serena called, only allowing him to enter after she had finished dressing.

"What’s going on so early in the morning?!" After helping Serena with her makeup, her maid, Xiaoxiao, held out a bowl of medicine for her to drink.

"Well, we ran into that leader of the Golden Dragon Club, Tuoba Tianye, at the market yesterday. He’s come to request an audience with you, Third Miss. Do you want to see him?!"

Xiao Qi’s face lit up with excitement as he mentioned Tuoba Tianye.

"Tuoba Tianye from the Golden Dragon Club? Why would he come to see me out of the blue?!" Serena was taken aback. She had no prior connection with him. After finishing the medicine, she couldn’t help but ask curiously.

"I’m not sure. He just said he had matters to discuss with you. Right now, the eldest young master is in the reception room meeting with him. It turns out our villa relies on Tuoba’s shipping business for many of our maritime trades. The eldest young master and he are business associates," Xiao Qi explained.

"Are you sure he’s not here to see my brother but to see me instead?!" Tuoba Tianye had dealings with Adam Song, her older brother, and this was the first time she had met him. Why would he want to see her? Serena doubted Xiao Qi’s words.

"Third Miss, that’s what Tuoba himself said. He specifically asked for you. But if you’re not comfortable meeting him, I can turn him away," Xiao Qi offered, seeing her surprise and thinking she might not want to meet him.

"No, since he’s taken the effort to come find me, it would be rude to avoid him. Xiaoxiao, let’s go to the reception room and see." Serena rinsed her mouth with water to wash away the bitter taste of the medicine before stepping out.

As they walked through the corridors of the villa, the air was filled with the scent of blooming flowers from the gardens outside. The sunlight streamed in through the windows, casting warm patterns on the wooden floors. Serena could feel her heart racing as the prospect of meeting Tuoba Tianye loomed closer. What could he want from her? 

Xiaoxiao walked beside her, a mix of curiosity and apprehension on her face. "Do you think he’s here for business or something personal?"

"Honestly, I have no idea," Serena replied, shaking her head, her mind racing with possibilities. Whatever the case, she would handle it with grace and poise, just as she had been taught. 

The reception room loomed ahead, and with a deep breath, she prepared herself to face whatever awaited her inside.
