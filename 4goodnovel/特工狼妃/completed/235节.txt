**Let Me Stay and Accompany You! Chapter 7**

Nangong Nuo'er suddenly stepped forward, grabbing her chin with one hand while gently brushing aside the strands of hair that fell across her face. Her gaze fell on the bandage covering a portion of her skin, and she couldn't help but gasp, "Your face..."

"Third Miss, don’t worry. It's just a big pimple from heat, and the doctor said it’ll clear up in a few days with treatment," Xiaoxiao replied, feeling a twinge of guilt under Nuo'er’s piercing stare. She forced herself to adopt a light-hearted tone, hoping to avoid raising any suspicions.

"You’re lying." Seeing Xiaoxiao's eyes dart away, Nuo'er coolly spat out the words. She reached out to tear off the bandage.

"Third Miss, no!" Xiaoxiao exclaimed, her voice rising with panic as she realized what Nuo'er intended to do. But her protests couldn’t halt Nuo'er’s determined actions.

As the bandage was ripped away, a fresh scar, several inches long and still healing, came into view. Nuo'er’s fingers froze for a moment, and a flash of anger flickered in her icy eyes. But just as quickly, her expression returned to its usual calm. She gently pressed the bandage back into place and asked softly, "Does it hurt now?"

"It doesn't hurt anymore." The simplicity of the question stirred a deep sense of grievance within Xiaoxiao. Looking into Nuo'er’s composed eyes, tears welled up, threatening to spill over.

"Then why are you crying? No more tears, do you hear me?" Nuo'er scolded sharply, her gaze fixed on the glistening droplets in Xiaoxiao’s eyes.

"Yes, Third Miss, I won’t cry," Xiaoxiao quickly blinked away the tears, determined to keep them from falling. Though Nuo'er’s tone was strict, she felt a flicker of joy instead of resentment. The Third Miss cared about her; she was worried that crying would worsen the injury on her face.

Everyone present understood Nuo'er’s intentions, except for Ziyan, who struggled to comprehend her behavior. Xiaoxiao had already suffered so much, and it seemed harsh for Nuo'er to reprimand her so sternly. Ziyan had initially felt moved and guilty about her own plans, but now, her disgust for the situation lessened. What puzzled her was why Xiaoxiao appeared almost happy after being scolded. Was she a masochist?
