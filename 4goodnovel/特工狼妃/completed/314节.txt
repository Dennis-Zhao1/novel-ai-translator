**The Grand Finale! [The End]**

"The Grand Finale! [The End]"

"Whoever dares to laugh at you, I'll cut out their tongue," Harlan Yichen declared loudly, his voice piercing through the air.

"People might not laugh openly, but they’ll definitely be chuckling behind your back. I mean, bringing a doctor on the road was already a stretch, and now you want to bring a midwife too? I’m really at a loss for words with you," Nangong Nuoer shot him a sidelong glance, her expression a mix of disbelief and amusement.

"My lord, should we really call for a midwife?" Qin Tian, who felt like a pawn in this game, couldn’t help but voice his thoughts. Deep down, he agreed that the prince was making a bit too much of this situation. If it weren't for the prince's ghastly expression, he might have burst out laughing.

"Call for what? If you dare bring in a midwife, you might as well have her help you with your health!" Nangong Nuoer interjected decisively.

"Didn’t you just hear that the future princess isn't calling for one?" Harlan Yichen shot back at him with a glare.

"Understood, I’ll go fetch the doctor and skip the midwife," Qin Tian replied, feeling utterly innocent as he was being tossed around like a rag doll.

"Being your subordinate really is a tough gig. Did you see? Just now, Qin Tian got thrown under the bus without a second thought," Nangong Nuoer defended him, her tone slightly mocking.

"Are you implying that being your subordinate is a walk in the park? Is it because I’m too demanding?" Harlan Yichen squinted his eyes, clearly displeased.

"Even if my subordinates suffer grievances, I’ll always help them take revenge. Do you think being my subordinate is somehow better than being yours?" A sly smile danced on her lips.

"Don’t even think about poaching my people; they are fiercely loyal to me," Harlan Yichen snorted dismissively.

"Oh really? Are they truly loyal? If that’s the case, then why did Qin Tian follow me that day?" Nangong Nuoer laughed mischievously, her gaze challenging him.

"Nuoer, I just realized how cunning you are. You’re even playing tricks on the father of your child; you truly have no humanity!" He wondered how he had ended up tangled with a woman so shrewd.

"Are you regretting being the father of my child? If so, just say the word, and I won’t force any unwilling man to take on that role," Nangong Nuoer said with a teasing smile.

"Ha! Who said I didn’t want to? Anyone who dares to take that title from me will be dead meat!" His eyes flashed with fierce determination.

"Why are you being so fierce? Are you trying to scare my child?" She shot him a stern look, clearly unimpressed.

"I wasn’t trying to scare the child! I just lost control for a moment. Nuoer, don’t be mad; have some water to soothe your throat," Harlan Yichen quickly switched to a conciliatory demeanor, moving towards the coffee table to pour her a cup.

Watching his back, Nangong Nuoer’s smile slowly faded. Unbeknownst to her, he had gradually seeped into her heart, and his presence was becoming increasingly significant in her life. Being by his side, she had grown accustomed to her smiles and this happiness that came so easily. But how long could this bliss truly last?

If only there were no celestial music in this world, without her, perhaps they could remain this happy forever!
