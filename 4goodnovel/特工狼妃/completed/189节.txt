**Chapter 3: Holding On Tight!**

Under the piercing gaze of Tuoba Tianye, whose eyes seemed capable of peering deep into his soul, Nangong Yulou felt a flicker of uncertainty in his clear, bright eyes. He hesitated as he looked at the outstretched hand before him.

"Second Master Nangong, are you not going to shake my hand? Do you think my hands are dirty?!" Tuoba Tianye's deep-set eyes sparkled with a hint of amusement as he pressed on.

"I'm sorry, I just lost my train of thought for a moment. Why would I think your hands are dirty? I was actually worried you might think mine are!" Nangong Yulou seemed to snap back to reality, quickly reaching out to clasp Tuoba Tianye's hand.

Nangong Yulou’s hands were stunningly beautiful—long, slender fingers, fair and delicate, with palms perfectly shaped. On the other hand, Tuoba Tianye's fingers were long but dark and rough, creating a stark contrast as their hands intertwined. As Nangong Nuo'er observed their clasped hands, an unexpected feeling surged within her; she couldn't quite place it, but it was as if their hands were destined to be together.

"Second Master, your hands are really beautiful. I've never seen a man with hands so exquisite," Tuoba Tianye said, holding on a bit longer than necessary. His deep gaze remained locked on Nangong Yulou, sending a chill down the latter's spine.

"That's because I take good care of them. Tuoba, we've been holding hands for quite a while now; maybe you can let go?" A flicker of unnoticeable annoyance flashed in Nangong Yulou's lowered eyes, yet his face maintained an innocent, bashful smile, reminiscent of a harmless young man.

"I'm sorry; it’s just that Second Master Nangong's hands are so beautiful that I don’t want to let go," Tuoba Tianye remarked, his keen eyes having caught the fleeting hint of irritation in Nangong Yulou's expression. It seemed that this Nangong Yulou was not as simple as he appeared; while his words were apologetic, the look on his face betrayed no remorse.

What was going on here? They had only just met, yet the tension felt palpable. Tuoba Tianye's gaze toward his uncle was laden with something… Nangong Nuo'er furrowed her brow, scrutinizing them both.

"I'm sorry, but I do have some matters to attend to today," Nangong Yulou finally withdrew his hand from Tuoba Tianye's grip, speaking in a cool tone.

"Since my uncle is busy, why don’t we go check out another place, Tuoba? It seems Second Master Nangong isn't feeling too well," Nangong Nuo'er interjected, sensing the undercurrents in the conversation. She frowned, trying to diffuse the charged atmosphere.
