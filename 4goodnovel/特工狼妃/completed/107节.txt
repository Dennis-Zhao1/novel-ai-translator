**Addiction to... What? 5**

Nangong Nuo'er had no idea how many different substances she had been exposed to. Her rationality was gradually being overwhelmed by an insatiable craving. She felt miserable and desperately wanted to break free from her torment. She longed for the dark, soothing balm that could ease her suffering. Her thoughts became jumbled, and with a pleading look in her eyes, she gazed at Helian Yichen, begging, "Please, give me the black jade balm. Hurry... I need it... now..."

"You..." Helian Yichen couldn't help but feel a pang of heartache at the sight of the despair etched on her face. In a moment of frustration, he raised his hand and struck her across the face.

With a sharp crack, Nangong Nuo'er was thrown back onto the bed, a trickle of crimson spilling from her pale lips. The searing pain on her cheek brought her a fleeting moment of clarity. She struggled to rise, but her trembling body betrayed her, rendering her helpless.

"Nangong Nuo'er, no matter how much I care about you, I cannot marry an addict. You've truly disappointed me." Helian Yichen shot her a glance, a flicker of regret crossing his features for having struck her. But as he saw her pitiful state, he forced himself to turn away and left with a cold heart.

“Mmm…” Nangong Nuo'er slowly turned her head to watch him walk away, a single tear slipping down her cheek. In that instant, she wanted to explain that she had been set up, but deep down, she knew he wouldn't believe her. For so long, he had cared for her, spoiled her, and enjoyed teasing her until her face flushed in anger. No matter how much she mocked him or treated him with indifference, he remained unchanged. But now, was all of that about to come crashing down?

When did her disdain for him begin to morph into an acceptance of his presence?

Outside, Xiao Xiao and Xiao Qi heard the commotion inside. They watched as the Prince emerged, his face tense, exuding an aura that suggested he might snap at any moment. They wanted to say something, but the murderous look in his eyes silenced them, leaving their words caught in their throats.

"Let’s go." Helian Yichen glanced at them before turning away, leaving without a moment's hesitation. Following him were his loyal follower, Qin Tian, and his proud black eagle.

“Oh my God, what just happened?! We need to check on the Third Miss!”
