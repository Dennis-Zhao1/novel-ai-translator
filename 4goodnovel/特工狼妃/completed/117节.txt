**Get Out of My Way! 2**

“Miss Two, your intentions are appreciated, but the reason I allowed you in today is to be clear: I prefer tranquility and dislike interruptions. I think it’s best if you don’t come here anymore.” Helian Yichen’s tone was blunt, showing no courtesy whatsoever.

“Your Highness, I didn’t mean to disturb you. I came here just to bring you some health supplements. If I’ve intruded at all, please forgive me.” Nangong Qian’er had entered with a heart full of joy, but his words made her smile freeze. It dawned on her that he didn’t really want to see her; he just found her daily visits bothersome.

“If I want any supplements, I can easily ask Qintian to fetch them from the kitchen. There’s no need for Miss Two to come personally. That’s all I wanted to say. If there's nothing else, please leave.” Helian Yichen’s tone had grown noticeably colder.

“Your Highness, I truly have no other intentions. I just want to do something for you. I know my sister has upset you, and if you need someone to keep you company, I can be there for you at any time!” Nangong Qian’er took a bold step forward, reaching out to grasp Helian Yichen’s hand.

“Miss Two, please don’t make me feel as if I’ve stepped into a brothel with your actions.” Helian Yichen didn’t pull away from her, but his piercing gaze and sarcastic tone made her hesitant to advance any further.

“Your Highness, I merely wish to keep you company,” she pleaded. Did he really have to be so harsh? No matter how eager she was to gain his favor, the embarrassment was starting to get to her; he was truly heartless.

“Please go back; I despise women who throw themselves at me.” Helian Yichen picked up a wine glass from the table and poured himself a drink, savoring it slowly. The warmth of the alcohol burned its way down his throat, but his expression remained icy.

“Nor’er can, so why can’t I?! We are both young ladies from the Nangong Manor, both bearing the Nangong name. Your Highness, why is that?” Finally unable to suppress her frustration any longer, Nangong Qian’er confronted him, her voice rising with indignation.

“She is she, and you are you; you are nothing alike. Who I like and who I choose to have by my side is my business and none of yours.” The mention of Nangong Nor’er seemed to ignite something in Helian Yichen. He hadn’t expected her to bring up her sister, and his expression darkened even further.
