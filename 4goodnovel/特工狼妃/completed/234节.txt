**Let Me Stay and Accompany You! 6**

“Miss San, I really can’t meet with you right now. I’m still unwell, and I think it’s best if I step back for now. Once I feel better, I’ll come to serve you,” Xiaoxiao said, her fingers nervously clutching the hem of her clothes. She desperately didn’t want to face her like this, not wanting her to notice the disfigurement that had marred her face.

“Xiaoxiao, are you ignoring my words? Do you not want to serve me anymore?!” Nangong Nuo’er snapped, her displeasure evident when Xiaoxiao didn’t turn around.

“Of course not! I’ve never thought about not serving Miss San, but…” Xiaoxiao hesitated, her words trailing off as she struggled to find the right ones.

“Nuo’er, don’t pressure her. If she doesn’t want to say it, then let it go,” Helian Yichen interjected, trying to ease the tension.

“I don’t like my people keeping secrets from me. If she can’t do that, then she doesn’t deserve to be by my side. Prince, I’m sure you wouldn’t appreciate Qintian deceiving you either,” Nuo’er said, glancing at him with a smirk.

“Since you’ve put it that way, I have no further objections,” he replied. She was right; if Qintian were hiding something from him, he would react even more strongly than she was now. Helian Yichen sighed softly before addressing Xiaoxiao’s back. “Xiaoxiao, why don’t you turn around? Since Nuo’er is so eager to know, just let her in on it.” He understood that revealing this truth might disrupt their peace in the future, but secrets can’t stay hidden forever; the truth would come out eventually.

“Your Highness…” Xiaoxiao reached up to touch her face, her heart racing as anxiety gripped her, causing her fingers to tremble. Lowering her head, she slowly turned around.

Her hair was styled differently now; previously, it had all been swept up, but now one side hung down, as if she were trying to conceal something. Nuo’er’s fists clenched tightly at her sides, a turbulent wave of emotions surged within her, and a sudden fear crept in—fear of what she might see. At that moment, a sturdy hand landed on her shoulder, seemingly offering her courage and support. Taking a deep breath, she managed to say, “Lift your head.”

“Yes, Miss San.” Xiaoxiao hesitated for a moment but ultimately obeyed, raising her head. Just then, a gentle breeze swept by, brushing aside the strands of hair from her face, revealing a pale bandage. She quickly reached up to pull her hair down to cover it, but it seemed too late.

In that instant, the atmosphere shifted. Nuo’er’s heart raced, her breath catching in her throat as she processed the sight before her. The revelation hung in the air, heavy and fraught with unspoken words.
