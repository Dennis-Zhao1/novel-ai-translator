He’s testing her, isn’t he?

“Are you absolutely sure?” After all, this was their one shot, and he wanted to double-check.

“If you don’t trust me, why hand such an important task to me? Didn’t anyone ever tell you, 'doubt those you don’t use, and don’t doubt those you do'? ” Nanguo Nuo’er could hardly be bothered to explain the basics. She returned to her dorm, casually shedding her clothes until she was left in her undergarments, before climbing into bed to sleep.

“Nuo’er, it’s not that I don’t trust you. Why do you always have to speak with such sharp words?” He felt utterly helpless against her, Helyan Yichen sighed inwardly at his own lack of backbone as he sat on the edge of her bed, reaching over to pull the blanket up for her.

“I don’t like being doubted, not even by you.” Nestled in her bed, Nanguo Nuo’er squinted slightly at his handsome profile. She knew he was annoyed with her, yet he was at a loss for how to deal with her, making her unable to suppress a light chuckle.

“Are you mocking me?” In her presence, all of his prince-like authority seemed to dissipate.

“No, I’m just laughing. You seem so helpless when it comes to me,” she replied, lying on the soft mattress, a wave of drowsiness washing over her. With her eyes half-closed, her expression became a bit languid, her exquisite and beautiful face losing a bit of its coldness, replaced by a gentle warmth.

“You’re happy knowing I’m at your mercy, aren’t you? Go ahead and mock me if you want.” He felt inexplicably ensnared by her charm; no matter how many words he had, he couldn’t clarify his feelings.

“Don’t say that. I don’t mean to mock you, my prince. I won’t be able to join you for breakfast this morning, so go eat on your own.” Nanguo Nuo’er reached out, taking hold of his strong hand, a subtle smile gracing her lips.

“I’ll wait until you fall asleep before I eat. If you could smile at me every day, I’d be even happier,” Helyan Yichen replied, tenderly holding her delicate hand, gazing at her with warmth.

Nanguo Nuo’er simply smiled again, not responding further, and closed her eyes, drifting slowly into sleep.

As Helyan Yichen watched her gently sleeping face, he noticed the faint shadows under her eyes. He knew she must have pulled an all-nighter, as she wasn’t the sort to oversleep. The only reason she could sleep during the day was that she had likely been restless all night.

“It’s the first time I’ve met such a strong-willed woman. It’s infuriating, yet I can’t help but feel a pang of affection for you, Nuo’er. What kind of magic do you possess that leaves me so enchanted?” As he gazed at her coldly beautiful expression, even in slumber, Helyan Yichen couldn’t help but gently rub his forehead. Sometimes, he felt inexplicably drawn to her, yearning to understand her better, but he had no clue where to start.

Today’s weather was delightful, with a gentle breeze and bright sunshine, the sky clear of clouds.

After testing Nanguo Nuo’er, Nanguo Yulou stood in the courtyard, lost in thought as he held a piece of wood he intended to carve. He pondered the words of Yaoping, reflecting on all that had transpired since Nanguo Nuo’er’s return.

She had indeed changed, becoming more resilient, more radiant—nothing like the kind-hearted Nuo’er of before. If she wasn’t the real Nanguo Nuo’er, how could she possibly have the same appearance? This morning, he had tested her with osmanthus cake, and she still detested the scent just as much as before.
