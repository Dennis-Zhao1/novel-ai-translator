**Chapter 6: In Front of Her, Undress!**

"Thank you, but it’s no trouble at all, as long as I can fill my stomach," she replied, her eating habits quite good and not picky at all. Nangong Nuoer reached out to take the porridge from Xiaoxiao's hands, but it was snatched away by Helian Yichen, who was a step quicker.

"Nuoer, let me feed you," Helian Yichen said, cradling the bowl of porridge. He cast a glance at the black eagle perched on his shoulder, which was eyeing Nangong Nuoer with a wary stare. Following its master’s cue, the eagle let out a hoarse cry before soaring out through the window.

"I have an injured leg, not an injured hand. I don’t think I need you, a so-called lofty prince, to serve me," she said defiantly, locking her gaze on him as if challenging him. The idea of him feeding her made her uneasy, as if it would shorten her lifespan.

"In front of you, I’m not a lofty prince; I’m just an ordinary man who wants to take good care of his future wife," Helian Yichen said, a teasing smile playing on his lips as he looked at her.

"As long as I haven't stepped into your door, I am me, and you are you. Don’t confuse the two of us," she retorted coldly, dismissing his concern without a hint of appreciation. Just because he was her first man didn’t mean she would regard him with any special interest.

"It seems your personality has changed quite a bit. Do you know what the people at Nangong Manor say about you?" He found her to be such a cold woman; despite his efforts to lower himself to her level, she remained proud like a peacock. Yet, oddly enough, he didn’t find this off-putting—instead, he was drawn to the radiant aura she exuded. He must be bewitched; otherwise, why would he be so captivated by this woman? Helian Yichen stirred the steaming porridge with a small spoon, trying to shake off the infatuation that he himself found irritating.

"The old Nangong Nuoer is dead. The current Nangong Nuoer is no longer the same," she asserted, fully aware of how people outside perceived her. She despised it when they mentioned her former self; she was not that person anymore. They were two completely different women, and how could she possibly resemble her?

"I don’t care how you were before, but I like the you of now. Come on, be good and open your mouth to drink the porridge," Helian Yichen said, lifting a small spoonful of porridge to her lips, wearing an enchanting smile as he coaxed her.

As she stared at him, an internal battle raged within her. Was she really ready to let someone in? To allow him to care for her? The warmth of the porridge seemed to reflect the warmth in his eyes, and for a fleeting moment, she found herself wavering. But could she trust him?
