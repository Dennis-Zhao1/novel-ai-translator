**"You Cold-Hearted Woman!" Part 3**

At that moment, a murmur of confusion echoed from outside.

“Hey, where did that man in black go? He disappeared once he reached the prince's courtyard. Captain, what do we do now?!”

“To ensure the prince's safety, we should send someone to knock on the door to see if the assassin disturbed him. If he has, we can't take responsibility for that,” the captain instructed, his voice laced with urgency.

Just as he was about to call someone forward to knock, a voice lowered, almost as if it feared causing a disturbance. “Captain, I just saw a shadow flicker by.”

“Damn it! Everyone, hurry and chase after him! Don't let him escape!” Hearing the report, the captain shouted, his tone firm and commanding.

“Yes, Captain!” At his command, the group of bodyguards rushed out, and within moments, they had all vanished from sight.

“Your Highness, what a lovely pastime you have, staying up in the middle of the night to play cat and mouse with others,” Nangong Nuoer remarked, her voice laced with sarcasm as she observed the unusual expression on his face after the commotion outside had settled.

“Yeah, I felt a sudden urge, so I decided to play a little. I’m sorry for waking you just now, but I’m feeling a bit tired now. Let me sleep for a bit, and I’ll talk to you later…” Before Helian Yichen could finish his sentence, his head drooped suddenly, and he fell unconscious.

“No way! Just like that? Your efficiency is impressive, Your Highness…” Though she teased him, a sense of dread gripped Nangong Nuoer as she quickly reached out to push against his chest, hoping to wake him up. But when her hand made contact, she felt a warm, sticky substance. Slowly, she raised her trembling fingers to inspect them, only to find them smeared with blood.

“Oh my God, how did you get hurt?!” The sight of blood sent her mind racing into chaos. In her recollection, he had always appeared invincible, a strong presence that never faltered. Never had she imagined he could be hurt, yet here he was, lying unconscious before her, leaving her in shock.

“Damn it! I thought you were always so strong! How could you be injured?” In a panic, Nangong Nuoer threw off the covers and climbed out of bed, grabbing her cane for support as she stumbled toward the table to light a candle. After a difficult return to the bedside, she inspected his wounds. His shirt was soaked in blood, indicating he had lost a significant amount and was now unconscious.
