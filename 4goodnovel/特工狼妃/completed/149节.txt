She’s here, and the show is about to begin! Part 2

“Quick, go get Little Qi,” he said, knowing that his skills could help clear a path for her. Nangong Nuo’er pondered thoughtfully.

The markets in ancient times were much like those you see on TV, bustling with stalls lining the streets, filled with vendors selling all sorts of goods. Little Qi became Nangong Nuo’er’s guide, while Xiaoxiao led her to a street dedicated to women’s accessories.

“Xiaoxiao, why did you bring me here?!” Seeing the street adorned with various cosmetics and women’s trinkets, Nangong Nuo’er couldn’t help but frown; she had no interest in such things.

“Uh, Third Miss, you used to love coming here to shop. Is there a problem?!” 

She had lost her memory; was it possible that her tastes had changed too? Ever since she had been found by Little Qi after her disappearance, she had indeed changed a lot—no, it was more accurate to say her personality had transformed completely.

“Past is past, and present is present. Don’t mention the old me again.” She knew that the original Nangong Nuo’er and her own personality were like two sides of a coin, worlds apart. However, she wasn’t trying to impersonate her. They had simply decided she was the true Nangong Nuo’er, and there was nothing she could do about it. Of course, she wouldn’t force herself to change her personality to fit someone else’s expectations.

“Oh, then where would you like to go, Miss?” Seeing that she didn’t care for feminine items anymore, Xiaoxiao had no choice but to ask for her opinion.

“To a place that sells weapons.” She was unarmed, with not even a single self-defense weapon on her. It was time to choose something for protection.

“A place that sells weapons?! Third Miss, what do you intend to do?!” Hearing Nangong Nuo’er’s response, both Xiaoxiao and Little Qi were taken aback; the Third Miss used to avoid weapons like the plague. She was more likely to be found playing the guqin than handling a sword.

“What do you think I’m going to do there? Of course, I’m buying weapons, are you really that dense? Let’s go.” It was surprising; the area wasn’t very large, but the commercial street was well-organized, vibrant with life. It was no wonder that such high-end black jade ointment was found here—wealthy areas often bred decadence.

The weaponry store was located on another street. Here, the foot traffic was noticeably lighter than on the other streets, yet the variety of weapons on display was still astounding, leaving one dazzled by the choices. 

The bustling atmosphere filled the air as they walked, the sounds of vendors calling out to potential customers, the clinking of metal, and the faint smell of oil from the weapons creating a unique ambiance that made Nangong Nuo’er feel invigorated. This was a world she was beginning to reclaim, one where she could forge her own identity and make her own choices.
