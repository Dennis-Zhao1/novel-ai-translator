**Final Chapter! 22**

“I really don’t see you caring when I actually need you to.” It was always when she didn’t need him that she found a way to meddle in his affairs.

“So what do you want to do now? Are you planning to go back to the capital, or do you want to stay here?” She leaned lazily against his warm, spacious embrace, her voice casual yet teasing.

“Do you really want me to rush back to the capital and leave you here all by yourself?” His purple-tinged eyes flared with a hint of fire, unable to hide his irritation.

“I’m not saying that! Don’t jump to conclusions. You are the father of my child, after all. I don’t want to be apart from you.” Despite her independent spirit, having someone by her side felt much better.

“Really?” Upon hearing this, a joyful expression broke out on Helian Yichen's face. Finally, this woman realized she didn’t want to let him go.

“I’ll say this only once, believe it or not,” Nangong Nuo'er chuckled lightly, then slipped out of his embrace.

“You can’t take back what you’ve said. Where do you think you’re going?” Helian Yichen quickly grabbed her hand, not wanting her to slip away.

“I’m not taking back anything. Didn’t you say you’re returning to the capital tomorrow? Shouldn’t we let them tidy up a bit first? You don’t expect me to just follow you on the road like this, do you?” A teasing smile danced on her lips as she looked at him.

“You mean you want to go to the capital with me tomorrow? But what about your health?” Helian Yichen was taken by surprise, gripping her hand tightly in excitement, but he couldn't shake off his concern for her well-being.

“Do you really think I’m made of paper? Helian Yichen, stop being so neurotic. I’m fine, really. If you keep nagging, I might change my mind,” she replied, rolling her eyes at his overprotectiveness. It was uncharacteristic of him to be so fussy, unlike a decisive man.

“I’m just worried about you. No, I need to hire a doctor to accompany us back to the capital. If anything happens along the way, we’ll need a doctor on hand. Someone!” Helian Yichen called out loudly toward the outside.

“Yes, my lord, what do you need?” Qin Tian immediately appeared upon hearing Helian Yichen’s call, standing ready for orders.

“Go fetch the most renowned doctor in this town and have him come with us to the capital tomorrow. Make sure to meet his demands, and it would be best to find a midwife as well.” Helian Yichen paused for a moment before issuing his instructions.

“What? A midwife? Your Highness, I just recently got pregnant! I won’t need a midwife for at least another seven or eight months. You don’t need to ask for one so soon!” Nangong Nuo'er’s face turned green at his suggestion. Had he lost his mind? Did he really think she would need a midwife this early?

“Midwives know a lot. I think it’s better to have one care for you.” He wasn’t asking for a midwife to assist in childbirth; he simply wanted someone to help her with her body’s recovery. Helian Yichen felt a bit put out by her reaction.

“Please, with a doctor present, he knows how to help me recover. I don’t need a midwife! If someone overheard, they might actually think I’m about to give birth! Do you want me to be the laughingstock?” She couldn’t help but roll her eyes at his foolishness. How long could it possibly take to get back to the capital? Even without modern conveniences like planes, it wouldn’t take months, would it?
