**In Her Presence, Let Down Your Guard! 7**

"I used to think that men in this era were all self-centered." Nangong Nuo'er lowered her gaze, staring at the small spoonful of porridge in front of her. Slowly, she opened her mouth, allowing him to feed her. She was too tired to argue with him and didn’t want to upset her stomach any further.

"When being self-centered, a little infidelity now and then isn't so bad," Helian Yichen remarked, his smile deepening as he watched her finally open her mouth for the porridge. His expression radiated a joy that felt as if he were feeding a beloved pet. But this little wildcat was quite unruly; it took a fierce struggle each time to make her submit.

Nangong Nuo'er swallowed mouthful after mouthful of the porridge he offered. When she lifted her head for a moment, she was suddenly struck by the coldness in his smile. What kind of man was Helian Yichen, really?

He was a prince, high and mighty, yet here he was, lowering himself to feed her. This was only their second meeting, and he was already talking about marrying her. What on earth did he want from her? Of course, she wasn’t naive enough to think he was marrying her out of love. Although she had never been in a romantic relationship, she didn’t believe in love at first sight. Sometimes, she even wondered if his infatuation with her was due to some trick of that cursed fairy music. She hoped she was just overthinking it.

As night fell, Nangong Nuo'er felt her nerves tightening. The maid, Xiaoxiao, had finished tidying up the room and taken her leave. Now, it was just her, the dangerous Helian Yichen, and his proud black eagle.

The eagle was indeed a resentful creature, seeming unable to forget the harsh lesson she had given it. It glared at her with a look of hatred. She couldn’t help but worry: once she let her guard down, would it swoop down and peck her eyes out? It was true what they said—people and their pets often reflected each other. The owner’s nature seemed to extend even to their pets.

"Alright, you've eaten enough," Helian Yichen said, having satisfied his pet. He reached out to gently pat the eagle's head. His low voice carried a sultry charm that resonated in the quiet night, making it particularly captivating.
