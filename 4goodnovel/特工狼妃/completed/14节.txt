【Chapter 2: The Remnants of His Presence】

But despite her irritation, the pace of her footsteps didn’t waver at all. Even if she despised him, he was determined to keep protecting her.

“I told you, I’m not your damned Third Miss! Can’t you leave me alone? You’re so annoying!” As he trailed behind her like a pitiful little thing being bullied, Menghan felt a wave of annoyance wash over her. She didn’t want to waste any more time tangled up with him. Narrowing her sharp eyes, she suddenly quickened her pace, hoping to shake him off.

“Third Miss, are you challenging me to a lightness skill competition?” Just as Menghan believed she had successfully lost the pest known as Xiaoqi, a calm voice rang in her ears. Confused, she glanced back, only to find Xiaoqi closely following her, running effortlessly without a single drop of sweat on his brow. His feet moved swiftly, and if he wanted to surpass her, it would be a piece of cake. Here she was, a top contender in her special forces unit, yet she couldn’t even outpace a mere boy. How embarrassing!

“Watch out, Third Miss, there’s a tree ahead!” Just as Menghan wrestled with her frustration, she failed to notice the environment ahead. Thanks to Xiaoqi’s warning, she hastily tried to stop, but it was too late. Her momentum was too great; retreating wasn’t an option. From a distance, it looked like she was about to crash right into the trunk of a massive tree. In that critical moment, Xiaoqi swiftly wrapped his arms around her waist from behind and performed a graceful pivot, safely landing her on the ground.

“Are you okay, Third Miss? Did you get hurt?” Xiaoqi asked anxiously as he set her down.

She had never experienced such genuine concern from anyone before. Menghan looked at his worried face, watching his mouth move as he anxiously inquired about her well-being. She was taken aback for a moment before softly replying, “I’m fine.”

“I’m just relieved you’re okay! You don’t know how much I worried about you. From now on, whether you’re walking or running, always watch where you're going. Hitting a tree can really hurt!” Xiaoqi’s face lit up with a joyful smile upon hearing her reassurances.

He really was a pure-hearted and kind child. His smile was charming, and somehow, it had a calming effect on her previously restless mood. It was hard for her to hold onto her irritation any longer.
