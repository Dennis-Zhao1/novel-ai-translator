**A Strong Woman! 3**

"The doctor said you’re very weak; you need to eat more," Helyan Yichen observed as he watched her finish the dishes in her bowl, then proceeded to help her serve more.

"I was the one who provoked you first, so you don’t have to treat me so well out of guilt." Nanguo Nuoer had initiated the fight that morning. Even though she ended up seriously injured, she didn’t want his sympathy. Slowing her eating, she noticed how he was only serving her and not touching his own food. A frown creased her brow; she didn't like being watched so intently while eating.

"You silly girl, I’m not being nice to you because I feel guilty. I simply want to pamper you; it’s that simple." No matter what she said, Helyan Yichen had grown accustomed to it. A calm smile graced his lips as he looked at her, as if he had always treated her this way long before, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

"I’m not a three-year-old child; I don’t need anyone’s affection." She had always scorned the sweet words that men often spoke. Yet, whenever he spoke to her with such tenderness, her heart couldn't help but tremble slightly. Lowering her gaze, Nanguo Nuoer continued to eat in silence. His intense stare made her feel uneasy; she didn't want to be a pampered little woman, a privilege reserved for the weak.

"You don’t have to pretend to be strong all the time. Every woman needs a man’s affection. Don’t just eat the rice; you should have more vegetables." Watching her quietly focused on her meal, a hint of amusement flashed in Helyan Yichen’s violet eyes as he continued to serve her.

Nanguo Nuoer remained silent, focused on her food, while Helyan Yichen watched her with a smile, as if he were admiring a stunning painting. He occasionally served her food and softly reminded her to eat slowly. They had never shared such a harmonious meal together, yet the atmosphere felt surprisingly warm, as if they were a loving couple.

After ensuring the third young miss was settled for the night, Ziyun took her clean clothes to the laundry room. This time, she had deliberately chosen a path that was far from Nanguo Xudan’s residence to avoid him. Night had fallen, and while there were streetlights along the way, the flickering flames cast eerie shadows that felt unsettling.
