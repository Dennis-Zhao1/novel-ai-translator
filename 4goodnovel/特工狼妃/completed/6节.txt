The Enchantment of the Night Coast! 6

She hoped to quell the burning desire within her by immersing herself in the icy sea water. The cool waves offered a slight reprieve, easing the heat on her skin just enough, but the fire inside her refused to die down…

Instead, it only intensified, making her feel an unbearable itch. Lost in the water, she had no idea how long she'd been submerged, but the effects of the potent aphrodisiac lingered on.

“Mmm…” Her enchanting eyes gradually took on a hazy look, the makeup washed away, revealing a delicate face that resembled fine porcelain. 

She appeared younger than her actual age, with trembling long lashes framing large, bright eyes that seemed to capture souls with every glance and smile. At that moment, her fair cheeks were adorned with an unusual flush, resembling the rosy hues of dawn.

The blush spread from her face to her tender, jade-like neck, and down to her rising and falling chest, making her resemble a shrimp scalded in hot water.

The itch felt like it was emanating from deep within her heart, making her want to scream in frustration. Menghan's mind slowly succumbed to the drug’s potent influence. She couldn’t help but run her hands over her body, fully aware of what she desired. Heaven help her, Menghan thought—she had survived bullets and chaos, but could she really be defeated by this mere aphrodisiac?

“Mmm… Ah…” The sensation was maddening, as if thousands of ants were crawling all over her. Soft moans slipped from her lips, and it was at that moment—

She heard the faint sound of footsteps approaching from afar. Under normal circumstances, she would have noticed, but her senses were dulled by the drug's grip.

It wasn't until she felt two burning gazes fixated on her that she suddenly realized how exposed and wanton she appeared to others.

“Mmm… Ugh…” The sensation was unbearable. Damn it, how could this aphrodisiac be so powerful? The night sea was already frigid, yet it couldn't extinguish the searing fire within her.

Just as Menghan reached the brink of her suffering, the water beside her suddenly rippled. Emerging from the waves was a figure, sleek and serpentine, backlit by the moon. In her haze, she couldn’t make out his features.
