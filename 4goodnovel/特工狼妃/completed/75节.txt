### The Wolf Has Entered the House! Part 3

“It's all that damned Helian Yichen's fault! If it weren't for him, my leg wouldn't be hurt like this.” Nangong Nuo'er sighed as she gently touched the splint on her thigh, her heart seething with a desire to skin the man alive.

Meanwhile, outside, Helian Yichen was handling some affairs when he suddenly sneezed out of nowhere. He rubbed his nose and thought to himself, "It must be that little vixen missing me."

“Little sister, are you inside?!” Just as Nangong Nuo'er was cursing Helian Yichen, a knock at the door interrupted her thoughts along with the voice of Nangong Qian'er.

“I’m here, come in!” Nangong Nuo'er replied, her expression gradually cooling. She knew that Nangong Qian'er had feelings for Helian Yichen and was eager to become his woman, so her visit today was likely not just for concern.

“Little sister, the weather has been dry lately, so I had the servants make a nourishing soup for your lungs. It will also help with your leg,” Nangong Qian'er said as she signaled for someone to bring in the medicinal soup and then personally served a bowl for her.

“Thank you, but you don’t have to come all this way for something like this. The servants could handle it,” Nangong Nuo'er said, taking the bowl with a faint smile.

“We're sisters, so there's no need for such formality. The prince has already decided to take you as his secondary consort. Once your leg is healed, you’ll be leaving home. Who knows when we’ll see each other again? I need to treat you well now!” Nangong Qian'er added, a hint of sentimentality creeping into her voice.

“Second sister, do you... like Helian Yichen?” Nangong Nuo'er asked casually as she sipped the soup, her tone deceptively nonchalant.

“Little sister, don’t misunderstand. I have no intention of competing with you for the prince. He’s made it clear that he only wants you, so how could I dare harbor any improper thoughts?!” Nangong Qian'er was caught off guard by the directness of the question and quickly shook her head.

“Really, second sister? You don’t need to deny it. Wasn’t mother quite eager to matchmake the two of you that day? And you didn’t really refuse, did you?” Nangong Nuo'er’s cold gaze flickered as she spoke straightforwardly.

“Well… with a man like the prince, who could resist his charm? But don’t worry, ever since I learned that he only wants to marry you, I’ve given up hope,” Nangong Qian'er hurriedly clarified, as if afraid of being misunderstood.
