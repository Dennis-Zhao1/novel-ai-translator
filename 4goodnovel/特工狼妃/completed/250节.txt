**Take Off Your Clothes! 9**

"Young Master, your face is really swollen. Let me help you apply some medicine first, and I promise I'll leave once I'm done." Despite being dismissed, Ziyan pleaded humbly, her heart aching to stay by his side.

"Are you leaving or not? If you’re not, then I’ll go." Disgusted by her presence, Nangong Xudan swept everything off the table, sending it crashing to the floor, and stormed off, his sleeves flying behind him.

"Young Master, where are you going?!" Watching him storm away in anger, Ziyan wanted to chase after him, but remembering Nuo'er’s earlier orders, she reluctantly stayed behind to tidy up, preparing to gather the clothes she had touched and burn them.

"Ah... ah..." Nangong Xudan ran towards the backyard, where it was quiet and empty. He recalled the anger in Nuo'er's eyes, the two stinging slaps she had delivered without mercy, and the thought of marrying a woman who had no interest in him as a concubine. It felt as if needles were stabbing at his heart, as if his insides were being sliced apart. In desperation, he let out a loud cry, wanting to release the pent-up frustration within him. 

He had only called out a couple of times when suddenly, everything went black. Someone had covered his head with a burlap sack. Before he could react, a sharp pain shot through his back, followed by agony in his stomach. The punches rained down on him, and the intensity of the pain made it impossible to fight back.

“Ugh... no... please... don’t hit me... it hurts... ugh...” Nangong Xudan struggled desperately, screaming, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. The assailant’s fists were ruthless and precise, each strike seemingly aimed at shattering his very insides. By the time the assault continued, he could no longer muster the strength to shout.

"Enough, Master! If you keep this up, he really might lose his life." Under the eerie glow of the moonlight, a tall man radiating an icy fury held Nangong Xudan in place with one hand while relentlessly pummeling him with the other, as though there were a deep-seated vendetta. Each punch was delivered with overwhelming force. Before long, Nangong Xudan was knocked unconscious. 

Standing to the side, watching the scene unfold, Qin Tian observed Helian Yichen as he unleashed his wrath like an enraged lion upon the unfortunate Nangong Xudan. Realizing it was time to intervene, he quickly spoke up.
