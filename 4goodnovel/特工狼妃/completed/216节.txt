“Please, Young Master, spare me!” 

She had just decided to quicken her pace and move ahead when she suddenly heard a light footstep behind her. Startled, she wondered who could be wandering around at this hour. Anxiously swallowing her saliva, she clutched the hem of Nangong Nuoer's dress, ready to take off running.

Just then, the footsteps behind her grew more urgent, almost as if they were chasing her. She had barely taken two steps when a strong hand landed on her shoulder, forcefully stopping her in her tracks.

“Ah... who are you? Let me go!” Ziyan felt her body temperature plummet, losing even the courage to turn around, and could only scream in panic.

“Shh, it’s me.” As Ziyan was engulfed in shock, her rigid body was turned around, revealing an impatient male voice in her ear.

“Y-Young Master, what are you doing here?!” She had deliberately tried to avoid him—how could he have found her here? Ziyan's face drained of color as she gazed at his intimidating expression, instinctively taking a step back.

“Why didn’t you come by last night? Have you forgotten the promise you made to me?!” Seeing her retreating from him, Nangong Xudan’s face darkened with a shadow of anger. He reached out, gripping her shoulder and pulling her closer, his furious gaze locked onto her as if she had committed an unforgivable crime.

“I-I didn’t forget! I just arrived at the villa... I got lost... I didn’t mean to avoid you,” Ziyan stammered, her body trembling uncontrollably under the weight of his intense stare.

“Lost? You got lost last night, and now you’re lost again? It seems your memory is exceptionally poor. Tell me, what can I do to help improve it?” The grip on her arm tightened painfully, cracking sounds echoing in the air.

“Ah... it hurts... please, Young Master, spare me... I promise I’ll remember!” Her arm felt as if it was about to dislocate, the agonizing pain forcing a cry from her lips.
