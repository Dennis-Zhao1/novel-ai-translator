**Moderation Will Prevent Addiction!**

"Cut the nonsense. It's your wound that I caused to split open. I believe it's my duty to remind you to hurry to the side room. The doctor should be arriving shortly, unless you've suddenly changed your mind and want everyone to know you were injured, especially by last night’s assassin!" The man really had no shame, taking advantage of the situation, and Nangong Nuoer shot him a glance filled with disdain.

Just then, a flurry of footsteps echoed outside the door, signaling the doctor’s arrival. Helian Yichen leisurely lifted the medicine box and slipped into the adjacent side room, preparing to tend to the wound himself.

"Third Miss, the doctor has arrived," came Xiaoxiao’s voice from outside as Helian Yichen vanished behind the door.

"Please let him in," Nangong Nuoer replied, rubbing her forehead with a faint sigh.

Before long, Xiaoxiao entered with the doctor in tow. The doctor appeared to be quite elderly, his gait unsteady. Upon seeing him, Nangong Nuoer couldn’t help but twitch her mouth in disbelief. This old man, who could barely walk, was supposed to help her?!

"Third Miss, Doctor Li is the best physician in our vicinity. Whatever ailment you have, just consult him, and he'll prescribe a remedy that will surely cure you," Xiaoxiao explained hurriedly, sensing Nangong Nuoer’s skepticism.

"Is that so?!" Nangong Nuoer raised an eyebrow, observing the doctor who struggled to place the medicine box down.

"Absolutely! Doctor, let me assist you with the box. Please, go ahead and examine the Third Miss," Xiaoxiao said, quickly stepping forward to help.

"Thank you!" The doctor approached the bed with shaky steps and asked, "Third Miss, please extend your right hand so I can take your pulse."

"Okay." Nangong Nuoer extended her hand.

After taking her pulse, the doctor examined her eyes and tongue, scrutinizing her closely before asking a few additional questions. His brow furrowed slightly.

"Doctor, feel free to speak plainly. Are you going to tell me I have some terminal illness?!" Given how her head had pounded earlier, she couldn't help but worry that there might be a tumor in her brain. Such things were notoriously difficult to treat in ancient times; it could very well be a terminal condition.

The doctor hesitated, his expression growing serious. "Well, Third Miss, your symptoms are concerning, but let’s conduct a thorough examination before jumping to conclusions." 

Nangong Nuoer bit her lip, her mind racing with possibilities as she awaited his next words, feeling a chill run down her spine. Would this be the moment her fate took a turn?
