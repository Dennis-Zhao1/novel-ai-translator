**A Punch to Remember!**

“Norah, I don’t want to hurt you.” Helian Yichen dodged her relentless attacks with a sigh that hinted at both frustration and exasperation. How had he ended up liking a woman like her? It felt like he was torturing himself, but somehow, he couldn’t bring himself to let go. It was as if he had really fallen under her spell.

“I want to defeat you.” Why was it that people from ancient times had such extraordinary martial arts skills? After training for over a decade, she still couldn’t match even one of his hands. She felt a burning sense of injustice, and in that moment, Nangong Norah unleashed her hidden talents that she rarely showed.

“You should know that with your current strength, it’s impossible for you to defeat me.” Helian Yichen held her hand firmly, feeling exasperated by her persistence. What an ungrateful woman! No matter how patient he was, she could drive him to the brink of madness.

“I don’t care!” At that moment, Nangong Norah was like a trapped wild beast, using every ounce of her strength to bring him down. With her hands immobilized, she resorted to kicking at him.

“Nangong Norah, can you be reasonable for once?!” Helian Yichen gripped her wrists, and when she started using her legs to attack, he had no choice but to block her with his own feet, all the while being careful not to hit her injured thigh.

“I won’t stop! If you want me to give up, then you’d better fight me seriously!” Her anger exploded as she yelled at him, refusing to back down.

“You…” She kept pushing forward while he retreated. Helian Yichen had always considered himself a patient person, but in front of her, his patience had limits. When he saw that she still wouldn’t relent, he could no longer hold back. With one hand, he seized her wrists, and with the other, he clenched his fist, aiming a powerful blow to her abdomen.

“Your Highness, no!” Watching Helian Yichen’s fist heading straight for Nangong Norah’s stomach, Xiaoxiao, who had been anxiously watching from the sidelines, gasped and cried out in alarm. The prince could hit anywhere else, but he absolutely must not strike the Third Miss’s belly. However, her desperate shout came too late to stop his punch.

“Ah…” Helian Yichen’s fist landed heavily, fueled by his anger. As the blow connected with her abdomen, an indescribable pain shot through Nangong Norah. It felt as if all her strength had been drained away in that instant. Her pale face contorted in agony, and her body fell forward, completely weakened.
