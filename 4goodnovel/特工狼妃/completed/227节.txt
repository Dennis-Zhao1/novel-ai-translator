**We Will Meet Again! 2**

“Now that you’ve said that, I think we should be fine. Of course, there’s no need to check, but I suddenly feel the urge to take off your mask. You remind me of a friend,” the masked figure in black said, a glint of mischief flashing in his eyes. Without warning, he leaped onto a nearby tree branch, closing the distance between them in the blink of an eye. His movements were so swift that it felt like he had teleported to Adam’s side.

“Fair enough, I’d like to take off that mask of yours too,” Adam responded, his dark eyes shimmering with intensity. Before the masked man could say anything further, Adam lunged forward, reaching for the cloth that obscured the stranger’s face.

“Is that how it is? We haven’t even finished our conversation, and you’re already trying to ambush me. That’s not very gentlemanly,” the masked man retorted, deftly blowing a whistle and deflecting Adam's hand with ease. At that moment, Adam’s assistant sprang into action, joining the fray. The masked man shot him a challenging look, “There sure are a lot of flies buzzing around here. If you have the guts, come after me.”

“Hmph, let’s see if you can escape first,” Adam shot back, his hand swatted aside, but he quickly adjusted his tactics and pressed on with his attack.

“Do you really think you can take me on, Gang Leader? Tell your underlings to go easy on me; I’m not ready to die just yet.” The masked man countered, pushing Adam back with a powerful strike. He sensed a crowd gathering outside the trees, but he brushed it off. After forcing Adam back, he pivoted and darted to the right. Just as he broke free from the cover of the tree, archers positioned outside released a volley of arrows, which rained down upon him.

“Must you be so courteous? I already asked you to tell them to hold back,” he sighed, his face partially covered as he soared through the air. Regardless of the situation, it seemed his body was destined to become a pincushion for arrows.

Just when everyone thought he would surely be hit, he suddenly flipped in mid-air, raising both hands to unleash a powerful gust that swept through the incoming arrows like a storm. To everyone’s astonishment, the arrows that were meant for him veered off course, returning to their origin. The ground below erupted with cries of shock and pain, as it became clear that the archers had been struck down by their own misfired shots.
