**Who Betrayed Her? Part 5**

"Get out of my way! Whether I live or die from now on has nothing to do with you all, just leave!" Nangong Nor was fed up with their pleas.

"No, Miss San, please don’t kick me out! I swear I didn’t betray you!" Xiaoxiao’s voice trembled with desperation as she clung to Nor’s pants, her eyes glistening with tears. "You saved me! You gave me a home again! If you send me away, it would hurt me more than if you killed me!"

"Miss San, please don’t drive Xiaoxiao away! It’s not her fault; it’s actually me..." Xiao Qi, panic rising within him, realized that if he didn’t speak up soon, both he and Xiaoxiao would be out on the streets. He struggled with his thoughts but finally decided to reveal the truth. Just as he was about to explain, Xiaoxiao, furious at his confession, raised her hand and slapped him across the face. "You useless fool! Why did you betray Miss San? After all she has done for you, how can you face her like this?"

"Xiaoxiao, let him explain! Who told you to do this? What did they offer you?!" Nor's voice was firm, though a hint of confusion lingered in her mind. She had always treated others kindly; who could possibly want to harm her?

"Miss San, Xiaoxiao, please let me explain! I didn’t mean to harm you or betray you! I only added some medicinal herbs to your medicine that would help your condition. I swear, I was only thinking of your well-being!" Xiao Qi's eyes were wide with sincerity, and he could see Xiaoxiao’s anger melting away, replaced by concern.

"If it’s a medicine that’s supposed to help, why keep it a secret? Why not just tell us?! Stop lying!" Xiaoxiao shot back, her eyes narrowing as she glared at him.

"The formula is confidential! He said it had to remain a secret, that I couldn’t tell you. But look, you didn’t have an episode tonight, right? It must mean the medicine is working!" Xiao Qi replied, his tone naive and earnest.

"Xiao Qi, have you lost your mind? Do you really think there’s a medication that can control the effects of the Black Jade Ointment? Who told you to give this to Miss San? Can’t you think for a moment?!" Xiaoxiao was fuming, her frustration boiling over. 

With every word exchanged, the tension in the room thickened, each character battling with their emotions and the weight of betrayal hanging heavy in the air.
