**The Allure of the Night Coast! Part 11**

Originally, he wanted to treat her gently, but her words instantly broke his calm demeanor. He no longer felt like teasing her, nor did he want to hear her recount the tales of how many men she had slept with in the past...

The night sky was adorned with countless stars, shyly blinking their bright eyes as they observed the scene unfolding below, retreating behind the clouds. The sound of the waves rolling in from the sea drowned out the soft whispers rising from the beach, as if the ocean itself was providing them with a veil of secrecy.

As dawn broke, Menghan slowly awakened, the sound of crashing waves whispering in her ears, reminding her that she was still by the sea. She shifted slightly, only to realize her entire body felt achingly sore.

Especially her lower body, causing her to furrow her brows in discomfort. It was then she noticed a man’s arm draped around her waist. Memories of the previous night’s passionate encounter flooded her mind. Although she was an agent trained for sacrifice, ready to give up her innocence at any moment, the reality of what had occurred was still hard for her to accept.

The man who had shared such an intimate night with her was still asleep. Carefully, she removed his arm from her waist, gritting her teeth against the soreness, and gradually slipped away from his side.

Menghan clenched her fists tightly, her alluring eyes shifting between uncertainty and resolve. This man had saved her, yet he had also taken away her innocence. She should have the heart to end him. Her palm hovered in the air, hesitating. But as she looked at his strikingly handsome and commanding face, she found herself unable to harm him.

“Fine, I’ll let you go this time. But if I ever see you again, I won’t hold back,” Menghan said, retracting her hand, her face cold and unyielding as she quickly departed without a backward glance.

Menghan had no idea what the man’s name was, nor did she care to find out. Although she had given him her innocence, she didn’t want any ties to him. Or rather, it should be said that she...
