**The Enchanting Temptation of the Night Coast! 7**

However, it was clear that he was tall. Despite the long, flowing hair cascading over his shoulders, she knew he was a man. His masculine aura was overwhelmingly strong, emanating a commanding presence that felt both intimidating and alluring. Though she couldn’t see his face clearly, there was no doubt he was not an ordinary man.

“I need your help, please!” While her senses were still clouded by the effects of the drug, Menghan stared intently at the man who had suddenly appeared before her. She was acutely aware of Jin Ye's ruthless nature. The aphrodisiac he had given her was undoubtedly potent, and if she didn’t find a man to satisfy her urges, she feared she wouldn’t survive this ordeal. At this point, she couldn’t afford to hesitate. To stay alive, she was willing to overlook everything, even if it meant surrendering herself to a stranger—after all, she could rationalize it as a surreal encounter.

“You’ve been drugged?” The man’s voice was deep and resonant, with a tantalizing timbre that sent shivers down her spine, the kind she found irresistible. Yet, it was evident he wasn’t a gentleman. His eyes were fixated on her, and once they landed on her, they didn’t stray. The heat of his gaze ignited her body further. She didn’t need a gentleman at this moment; she just needed a man.

“Yes, and the effects are taking hold. You're the only man here; if you don’t help me, I might not make it.” Menghan extended her tongue, languidly licking her dry lips. It seemed an unconscious action, but there was an undeniable sensuality to it, a beguiling allure in her misty, captivating eyes as they locked onto his.

“But you don’t know me.” His heated gaze roamed her body, as if weighing whether she was worth his effort.

“What I need right now is a normal man, not someone I know. Don’t tell me you’re incapable in that department—that would be the ultimate disgrace for a man.” 

Menghan delicately lifted her hand from the water, placing it on her chest, her fingers gently caressing her smooth, delicate skin. Her unwavering gaze pierced through to him, a silent challenge. She had learned many ways to seduce men; in this desolate wilderness, far from civilization, she was confident he wouldn’t be able to resist her charms. She believed he would inevitably take the bait.
