**Holding onto His Hand!**

A faint smile appeared on Tuo Ba Tian Ye's chiseled, handsome face, reminiscent of a finely carved statue.

"Of course! The waterways in the south are much more abundant than those in the north. Since Tuo Ba is visiting the south this time, I hope to extend a bit of local hospitality. If you don’t mind my humble abode, why not stay at my place?" Nan Gong Xu Dan offered warmly.

"Would that not be a bother to you?" Tuo Ba Tian Ye replied, feeling the invitation and not outright rejecting it.

"Not at all! Absolutely not. His Highness Helian Yi Chen is staying at my place as well. If you were to stay, it would certainly liven things up at Nan Gong Manor. We’ve never experienced such a lively atmosphere before!" Nan Gong Xu Dan said with a bright smile.

"Since the young master is so sincere in his invitation, I suppose I have no choice but to accept. I apologize in advance for any disturbance I may cause," Tuo Ba Tian Ye responded politely.

Having Helian Yi Chen around was already chaotic enough, and now to add the leader of the Golden Dragon Society to the mix? That would be chaos upon chaos! Nan Gong Xu Dan had the audacity to invite them to stay; it made her wonder if he had any sense. These men clearly had their own agendas. Watching them exchange polite words on the surface, Nan Gong Nuo Er practiced with her whip, deep in thought.

Nan Gong Nuo Er felt bored lingering in the living room. Just as she mentioned wanting to take her leave, Tuo Ba Tian Ye insisted she give him a tour of Nan Gong Manor. Though she felt a bit unwell due to her monthly cycle and wanted to refuse, his earnest demeanor compelled her to reluctantly agree to his request.

Northerners were indeed tall and robust. Thankfully, Tuo Ba Tian Ye was not difficult to look at; he had a charm that could attract women. As they walked through the manor, the maids couldn’t help but steal glances at him, finding him quite the captivating man.

"Why is this courtyard so secluded? It’s very quiet here. Who lives inside?" When they reached a particularly tranquil courtyard, Tuo Ba Tian Ye asked curiously, gazing at the serene surroundings.

"The one living here is my second uncle. He's a bit of an oddball—he doesn't like anything except for hiding away and working as a carpenter." There were sounds of wood being manipulated coming from inside the courtyard. At that moment, Nan Gong Yu Lou must be busy crafting something. As she mentioned him, Nan Gong Nuo Er's eyes flickered for a moment. Although she hadn't exposed her uncle’s secret regarding the black jade ointment he provided her through Xiao Qi, it didn’t mean she held any fondness for him.
