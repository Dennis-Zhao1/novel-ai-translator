**Chapter Two: Spare Me, Young Master!**

"Will you really remember?! Or are you just trying to toy with me?!" Nangong Xudan gripped her arm tightly, watching her face pale in pain. A dark glimmer flickered in his eyes.

"I wouldn’t dare! How could I possibly toy with you, Young Master?" Ziyan shook her head vigorously, the pain radiating from her arm causing her eyes to sting with tears.

Just as Nangong Xudan was about to speak again, a sudden sound of footsteps reached their ears. Ziyan felt a surge of relief at the thought of someone arriving to rescue her from this predicament. However, to her surprise, Nangong Xudan suddenly released his grip on her arm, instead pulling her hand and whispering urgently, "Don’t make a sound. Follow me."

"Where are you taking me?!" Ziyan felt her heart drop again after having just relaxed. She wanted to pull her hand away, but the fear of angering him kept her compliant, and she followed him obediently.

After finishing dinner, Nangong Nuo'er fell into a deep sleep once again. As Helian Yichen stayed in the room to keep her company, Qintian stealthily entered.

"Young Master, Tuoba Tianye is on the move." Qintian stood behind Helian Yichen, lowering his voice intentionally. The young master had long suspected that Tuoba Tianye's arrival at Nangong Manor was not just a simple visit. So, after nightfall, he had ordered Qintian to monitor him from a distance, and it turned out he was right—Tuoba Tianye had slipped away from Nangong Manor under the cover of darkness.

"Is he headed towards the dock?" Helian Yichen's tone was calm, as if he had anticipated this all along. His long fingers absentmindedly played with Nangong Nuo'er’s soft hair, his expression seemingly indifferent.

"Yes, I just followed him for a short distance and confirmed he's indeed heading toward the dock." Tuoba Tianye was formidable, and Qintian hadn’t dared to get too close for fear of being discovered.

"Qintian, you stay here and keep an eye on Nuo'er," Helian Yichen instructed, leaning down to kiss Nuo'er gently on the lips and tucking her blanket snugly around her before rising to leave.

"Young Master, let me go with you!" Qintian's voice was tinged with urgency. He couldn’t bear the thought of watching Helian Yichen get hurt again.

"Absolutely not. This is an order. You must stay and watch over Nuo'er. If anything happens to her, I will hold you responsible." 

As Helian Yichen spoke with authority, Qintian nodded reluctantly, his heart heavy with concern as he watched his master head into the night, the weight of impending danger hanging in the air.
