**"You Cold-Blooded Woman!"**

In the monotonous days of this ancient era, Nangong Nuo'er had slowly gotten used to going to bed early. That night, Helian Yichen sent a servant to inform her that he would be home later than usual. Her response was blunt—she hoped he would never return. Upon receiving her reply, Helian Yichen couldn't help but laugh heartily; she was truly an intriguing woman, and he knew he hadn’t picked the wrong person.

That night, Nangong Nuo'er fell asleep early. However, she remained vigilant even in the safety of her own home. She had grown accustomed to keeping her guard up, so when the door creaked open, she was already awake. Thinking it was Helian Yichen returning, she didn’t pay much attention. But when she saw a figure in black stealth gear slip inside, she instinctively gasped, her heart racing. Regaining her composure, she demanded, “Who are you?! An assassin?!”

“Shh!” The figure, noticing how quickly she regained her calm, had a glint of appreciation in his eyes. He swiftly moved to her bedside, lifting the covers as if to climb in.

“What do you think you’re doing?!” To her shock, he jumped onto her bed. Nangong Nuo'er quickly clenched her fist and aimed a punch at his face.

“Don’t panic, it’s me!” The figure blocked her attack with one hand while pulling down the mask covering his face with the other.

“It’s you? Why on earth are you sneaking around dressed like that? Were you out robbing someone?!” Realizing it was indeed him, Nangong Nuo'er retracted her fist, scrutinizing his stealth outfit with a scornful look.

“I don’t have time to explain right now.” Helian Yichen hastily stripped off the night gear, shoving it under the covers before lying down casually beside her.

Just as Nangong Nuo'er opened her mouth to ask more questions, a cacophony of footsteps echoed outside, suggesting a chase was underway. She instinctively turned her gaze to the man beside her.

“Shh!” Helian Yichen caught her questioning look and blinked at her with his violet eyes, placing a finger over his lips to signal her to remain silent.

Though confusion swirled in her mind, Nangong Nuo'er found herself obeying him this time. She stayed quiet, her eyes fixed on him. In the dim light of the moon, she noticed that his complexion seemed slightly off.
