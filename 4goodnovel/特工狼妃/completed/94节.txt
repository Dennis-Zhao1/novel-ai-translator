**"Bite Me!" Chapter 6**

“I’m fine as long as you’re okay. By the way, how did you suddenly get a headache? Have you ever felt this way before?” Helyan Yichen asked, a hint of concern creeping into his serious expression as he tucked his hands behind him, trying to downplay the situation.

“No, I rarely get headaches. It’s just that recently, for some reason, I’ve been feeling dizzy and struggling to see clearly. I thought it was just related to my foot injury, so I didn’t pay it much mind. But I didn’t expect today’s headache to be this bad. I’m sorry for worrying you.” Nangong Nuoer said, a touch of embarrassment coloring her cheeks.

“You should have noticed this problem sooner and gone to see a doctor,” Helyan Yichen said, his heart tightening at the memory of her pain-filled expression. He couldn’t bear the thought of seeing her suffer like that again.

“Xiaoxiao has already sent someone to find a doctor. I think it should be fine,” she replied, although a nagging worry crept into her mind. Why was her headache so intense all of a sudden? Was it somehow related to the time travel? That couldn’t be right. If the dream she had that day was real, her body should have adapted to this era by now.

“From now on, if you feel any discomfort, you must see a doctor or at least tell me, okay?!” Helyan Yichen said, frowning in a slightly possessive manner as he held her hand, annoyed by her casual response.

“Okay, I understand,” Nangong Nuoer replied, not wanting to bicker with him. Suddenly, something seemed to strike her, and her gaze fell on Helyan Yichen’s chest. His outer garment was black, obscuring whatever injury he might have, but as an agent, she was keenly sensitive to blood. She looked at his chest and said, “You reopened your wound.”

“It’s nothing serious.” He brushed off the concern, trying to sound nonchalant about the pain.

“You lost a lot of blood last night. How much do you think you have left to spare? Go take care of your wound; I can’t stand smelling that awful coppery scent anymore,” she said, her gaze lowered, a note of seriousness in her voice.

“If you’re worried about me, just say so. There’s no need to say things that sting.” He couldn’t help but admire her resilience, though he also felt a spark of irritation at her frankness. Still, he decided to let it slide since her concern was genuine.

The atmosphere hung heavy as he continued to hold her hand, the warmth of their connection a stark contrast to the worries that loomed over them both. Deep down, he knew that her well-being was just as important as his own, and he silently vowed to protect her, no matter the cost.
