**Final Chapter! 13**

“What? You…” Haoyue Liansi’s expression twisted in disbelief as she pointed at her, unable to find her voice, as if struck by lightning on a clear day.

“Do you have any idea how twisted your son is? He fell in love with his own sister, Nangong Nuo’er. I caught him in the act, and it was me who threatened him to take Ziyan as a concubine. Ziyan is my mole planted beside your son. He’s done all sorts of awful things and even desecrated his own sister. Tsk, I can hardly find a reason for him not to die,” Nangong Nuo’er said, relishing the satisfaction of revenge as she watched Haoyue Liansi crumble under the weight of the revelation.

“You’re lying! How could he possibly…” Haoyue Liansi’s face drained of color as she glanced over at the already captured Nangong Xudan, who was now slumped over, silent and defeated.

“I originally didn’t want to get involved, but you were just too self-righteous. You’re selfish and cold-hearted, treating your son as if he were a treasure while others are worth less than grass. You ruined Xiaoxiao’s beauty, and now you’ll pay a heavy price for it. How does it feel to be on the verge of losing your most treasured son and the wealth and power you can’t bear to part with? Isn’t that a complex feeling?” Nangong Nuo’er’s eyes sparkled with a fierce determination, ready to show Haoyue Liansi just how ruthless she could be.

“You’re actually targeting us for some lowly girl?” Haoyue Liansi stared at her in disbelief.

“Yeah, so what if I’m just a lowly girl? As long as it makes me happy, I don’t care if I’m just a lowly girl, or even a lowly dog. I’ll do everything in my power to make your life miserable.” As she spoke the last words, a smile graced Nangong Nuo’er's face, but it was a smile that could chill the bones.

“You wretched girl, I’m going to kill you!” Haoyue Liansi’s fury boiled over, and she lunged for Nangong Nuo’er's neck.

“Second Madam Nangong, murder is a serious charge. Perhaps you should save your energy for thinking about how to live your life from now on,” came a voice as guards rushed in to pull her away before Nangong Nuo’er could lift a finger.

“Nuo’er, don’t you think that was a bit too harsh?” Helian Yicheng, who had been watching coldly from the sidelines, couldn’t help but shake his head with a bemused smile, though he maintained an indulgent attitude.

“Do you think I’m too heartless? Are you scared?” Nangong Nuo’er feigned innocence, a sweet smile spreading across her face.

“No, I don’t think you’re heartless. I just think you’re too biased. You’re willing to do this for Xiaoxiao. If one day I’m bullied, would you stand up for me like this?” Helian Yicheng looked at her with hopeful eyes.

“Your Highness, are you joking with me? Who else would dare to bully you?” Nangong Nuo’er replied, pretending to be shocked.

“You little enchantress, are you destined to take advantage of me?” His tone held a hint of helplessness, but more so, a deep affection.

“Bullying you is my exclusive right. If anyone dares to infringe on my right, I’ll make them suffer a hundred times over. Does that make you feel a little better?” This petty man was actually getting jealous over a girl; Nangong Nuo’er found it amusing, half-jokingly, half-seriously.

“Are you serious?” Helian Yicheng’s eyes lit up, looking at her in disbelief.

“Is this all you can manage, Your Highness? Needing a woman to stand up for you when you’re bullied?” She looked at him with a disdainful gaze.
