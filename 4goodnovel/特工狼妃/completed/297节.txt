**Final Chapter! 7**

“Yulou, I’m sorry.” Takuba Tianye felt a wave of shame wash over him as he met his companion’s resentful gaze. This time, he was the one who had betrayed him.

“Do you really think a simple apology can erase your betrayal?” Nangong Yulou tightened his grip on the soft sword, a flash of bloody killing intent igniting in his eyes.

“If I hadn’t done this, you would have remained lost in your own delusions,” Takuba Tianye sighed, attempting to justify his actions.

“You tricked me into moving the goods, letting me believe you would actually raid the Fengshui Gang, forcing me to find a new place for the cargo. You’ve been deceiving me all along! If I have to die, I’ll drag you, the hypocrite, down with me.” With that, Nangong Yulou lunged forward, thrusting his soft sword at Takuba Tianye.

“Yulou, please let me explain! You won’t die; I won’t let you die!” Takuba Tianye, realizing Yulou was seemingly mad with rage, reluctantly drew his weapon to defend himself.

“Nuo’er, you played a crucial role in capturing them this time. You have done the court a great service, and the emperor will surely reward you. What kind of reward do you want?” While the two fought fiercely, the others were casually chatting away.

“I’m worried that what I want, your emperor cannot give me.” She was helping them purely out of a desire for revenge for herself and Xiaoxiao, never considering any reward. If it came down to what she truly wanted, they might not be able to fulfill it. Nangong Nuo’er smirked coldly.

“Oh? Something even the emperor can’t offer? Now I’m really curious. What could that possibly be?” Helian Yichen asked, intrigued.

“Do you really want me to say it?” She suspected that once she revealed it, his face would turn sour.

“Just spill it. What could be so precious that even the emperor can’t provide it?” The emperor was the ruler of this world; there was nothing he desired that he couldn’t obtain. The fact that she claimed to want something beyond the emperor’s reach only piqued his interest further.

“I want your country’s sacred artifact, the Immortal Zither. Do you think your emperor would grant me that?” Nangong Nuo’er mocked, watching as his expression shifted at the mention of the zither.

“Nuo’er, don’t joke about such things.” The smile on Helian Yichen’s face faded, replaced by genuine concern.

“I’m not joking; I truly want the Immortal Zither. Without it, I will die.” Nangong Nuo’er spoke earnestly, her tone devoid of levity.

“Nuo’er, the Immortal Zither is a sacred and untouchable relic in our country. No one must desecrate it, or they will face execution.” Helian Yichen, seeing her nonchalant demeanor, thought she was merely jesting.

“Is that so? A sacred and untouchable relic that no one must violate?” Nangong Nuo’er felt an urge to laugh coldly, her voice steady.

“Yes, Nuo’er, please don’t make jokes like this. I can’t bear to see you in danger.” Helian Yichen reached out, gently caressing her face, his tone almost pleading.

“I’m not afraid of death; why should you be?” Did he really care so much about her life? If he knew the Immortal Zither was her only hope for survival, what would he do then?

“You may not fear it, but I do. I fear it deeply.” Seeing her indifferent attitude pierced his heart like a dagger.
