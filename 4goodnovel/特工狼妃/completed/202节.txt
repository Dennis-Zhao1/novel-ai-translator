**A Punch to the Gut!**

In the royal palace’s medical chamber, most of the court physicians focused on treating the concubines of the harem. If they could bring her back to the capital, there was a good chance they could restore her health, Qin Tian suggested earnestly.

"You're right. The palace physicians should be able to help Nuo'er recover," Helyan Yichen replied, his voice resolute. He couldn't bear to see her in pain any longer. "Qin Tian, prepare the carriage immediately. We’re going back to the capital right now."

"My lord, even if we’re returning to the palace, there’s no need to rush. Our matters are still unfinished," Qin Tian said, taken aback by the sudden decision. If they left now, what would they do if the Emperor held them accountable for not completing their tasks?

"I don’t care. I have to take her back to see the imperial physician," Helyan Yichen insisted, his brows furrowing as a determined glint flickered in his deep purple eyes. Nothing mattered more to him than restoring Nuo'er’s health.

"My lord, if I may interject, Miss San's condition is already so frail. Forcing her to endure the burdens of travel could be fatal," Xiao Xiao piped in, her concern palpable. It was good that he cared for Miss San, but couldn’t he at least consider the patient's well-being before making rash decisions? She couldn't bear the thought of Nuo'er collapsing from exhaustion on the way.

"Exactly, my lord. Miss San truly isn’t fit for a long journey at this moment," Qin Tian agreed emphatically, nodding his head vigorously.

"Fine, then we’ll wait until she’s a bit stronger before heading back to the capital. And let’s keep today’s events to ourselves—just say it was a sparring accident, and Nuo'er got hurt by mistake." Helyan Yichen realized they had valid points. He shouldn’t act so hastily. Rubbing his temples, he felt a throb at his temples; the thought of Nanguang Nuo'er facing complications during childbirth in the future made him want to tear his own hair out in frustration.

"Understood!" Both Qin Tian and Xiao Xiao recognized the gravity of the situation.

"And also, do not mention what the doctor said to Nuo'er. I don’t want to see her upset," Helyan Yichen instructed, taking a deep breath.

At that moment, Nuo'er was deep in slumber in her room. Helyan Yichen quietly moved to the bedside, sitting down and gazing at her pale face. His heart ached as he gently reached out to caress her cheek. Her face was so small that his hand could easily cup it, and in that moment, he felt a surge of tenderness mixed with the weight of his concern.
