**Don't Touch Me! 5**

She was truly an interesting woman. Every word she spoke was sharp and laced with barbs, not exactly sweet or flattering. Perhaps it was precisely this quality that made her intriguing to him, drawing him in with an inexplicable force. He would do anything, pay any price, just to have her.

"Then could you please move me somewhere else? I want to go back to my own bed to sleep. I forgot to mention that I have a habit of being particular about my sleeping arrangements," Nango Noer’s expression darkened as she shot him a cold glare.

“Besides my place, you can’t go anywhere else. I’ll ask your maid to bring over all your daily necessities shortly. If you have this sleeping habit, you’d better get used to my bed quickly,” Helian Yichen replied, a teasing smile playing at the corners of his lips as he leaned closer, his voice low as he announced his decision in her ear.

“Are you suggesting I live with you?” And share a bed at that? Nango Noer was not naive enough to think he would let her sleep alone in his lavish quarters. Her beautiful eyes widened in disbelief. Was he for real? She had already compromised significantly by being here, and now he was being so unreasonable as to expect them to share a bed?!

“It’s not a suggestion; it’s a requirement,” he said confidently. This wasn’t just a whim; he had already made arrangements. Helian Yichen’s eyes gleamed with a wicked light as he added, “Besides, we’ve already shared intimacy. You belong to me now. Once your foot heals, I’ll take care of matters here and bring you back to the palace to marry you as my concubine.”

“You’ve really thought this through,” Nango Noer retorted sarcastically. He was indeed overbearing and arrogant, doing whatever he pleased without considering anyone else’s wishes. Did he really think that just because he was a prince, he could dictate the fate of others? But she wouldn’t just accept her fate; he had no right to manipulate her life like this.

“Don’t be so polite! You should rest now. I have a few matters to attend to, but I’ll be back later. Remember to think of me,” he said, not even flinching at the sarcasm in her eyes. Today was a day worth celebrating, for he had finally found his little enchantress.

“I’ll be sure to think of you—just not in the way you’d like. I hope you never come back,” Nango Noer cursed him venomously.

“Ha ha... Unfortunately, that’s not something I can comply with, little enchantress. Rest well; I’m heading out,” he chuckled, leaving her with an air of playful defiance.
