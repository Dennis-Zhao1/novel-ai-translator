**Don’t Resist Me! 5**

Sometimes, a kiss from him didn’t lead to anything scandalous. The first time, she had been under the influence of a love potion, and the second time, it was because someone had slipped a concoction into her drink, causing her to lose her senses. But now, she was fully aware, and though she wanted to resist him and keep him from touching her again, he seemed to know her body all too well. With every caress, he effortlessly shattered her resolve.

“My Nora, don’t resist me. Your body craves this,” He Lian Yichen murmured, using his teeth to gnaw at the ties of her neck pouch. The stubble on his lips brushed against her smooth skin, sending tingling sensations coursing through her, gradually breaking down her defenses.

Nangong Nora fell silent, biting down on her lower lip to suppress any sounds that might escape. She wasn’t cold-hearted; how could she not react when someone caressed her so intimately? The physiological responses were beyond her control. She understood she could escape his grasp, but instead, she decided to remain still, letting him enjoy himself.

“Nora, you don’t think that silence will make me stop, do you?” Earlier, she had been struggling, but now she was completely quiet, even withholding any words of protest. If she thought her silence would diminish her allure, she was mistaken. With him here, he didn’t believe she could turn into a lifeless fish.

“Do whatever you want; I’ll just pretend I’m being haunted.” His insistence was overwhelming, as if he expected her to comply willingly. Nangong Nora narrowed her eyes, her expression devoid of emotion as she spoke.

“You must have forgotten how enthusiastic you were during our last two encounters. But don’t worry, I’ll help restore your memory. Nora, I won’t let you go,” his deep, resolute voice echoed in her ears, creating ripples in her calm heart.

“Do as you please.” She had come to understand the type of person he was; once he set his mind on something, he would stop at nothing to achieve it. He wouldn’t heed her advice, nor would he care about her protests. If resistance was futile, then she might as well surrender and enjoy it.

“I’m serious. The things I needed to do are nearly complete. I just need to take this final step. Once everything here is settled, I’ll take you back to the palace. Even if the emperor opposes it, I will marry you.” He had never felt such a strong desire to marry a woman before; this time, he truly wanted her, so much that it hurt in his heart.
