Section 132: Once Again Controlled by the Drug! (Part 6)
“Controlled by the Drug Again! (Part 6)”

“I didn’t... I didn’t take anything... hehe... Am I floating now? My body feels so light. Don’t hold me down... I’m going to fly... I’m going to float away...” Nangong Nuo’er giggled uncontrollably, her words dissolving into incoherent rambling.

“Nuo’er, if you didn’t take anything, then why are you acting like this? Why are you like this?!” Helian Yichen’s voice trembled with anguish as he watched her, her behavior unmistakably mirroring the symptoms of the Black Jade Salve’s effects. She had promised to stop. She had been fighting to quit. Why was this happening again?

“Let me go! I want to fly! I need to go outside and fly!” Nuo’er’s gaze was distant, her words devoid of logic. Like a carefree child, she seemed oblivious to everything around her. All she wanted was to escape, to soar beyond her constraints.

“No, I won’t let you go,” Yichen said firmly, pinning her down with restrained force. “Nuo’er, listen to me. You’re not a bird. You can’t fly!” Desperation etched across his face, he held her struggling form tightly. Yet, Nuo’er thrashed against him, her movements frantic. In the chaos, her clothes became disheveled, and the delicate curve of her shoulder was inadvertently exposed.

“Let me go! Let me go!” Nuo’er pleaded, completely unaware of her state. Her shoulder, pale and smooth, gleamed faintly in the dim light, while the rising and falling of her chest betrayed her erratic breathing. Her innocence and vulnerability tugged at Yichen’s self-control, which was already hanging by a thread.

“Nuo’er...” His voice wavered as his gaze fell on her exposed skin. The sight stirred something primal within him, his breath catching as a heat he could no longer suppress surged through his body.

“Let me go!” she cried again, her struggles intensifying. The movement only amplified the rise and fall of her chest, an unintentional allure that sent Yichen’s composure spiraling.

Gritting his teeth, he reached out, firmly grasping both her wrists with one hand and pinning them above her head. His other hand moved instinctively, brushing aside the last remnants of her clothing. When her radiant, unblemished skin was fully revealed before him, his gaze turned searing, a vivid mixture of longing and torment. For a brief moment, all rational thought was drowned out as he leaned down, his breath brushing against her delicate skin, as if drawn irresistibly to the warmth she radiated.
