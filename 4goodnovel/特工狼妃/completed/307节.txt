**Final Chapter! 16**

The Nangong Manor was on the verge of being sealed off. Inside the manor, the old lady had treated her quite well, even assigning someone to take care of her. Now that everything had settled, Nangong Nora took Xiaoxiao and Ziyan to leave the manor. However, as soon as they reached the entrance, they were blocked by Qin Tian.

"Third Sister, please wait," Qin Tian said, beads of cold sweat forming on his forehead as he saw them attempting to leave.

"Nangong Nora raised an eyebrow, her voice calm and measured. "Qin Tian, is there something you need?"

"The prince ordered me to inform you that if he does not come out, Third Sister cannot leave first." The prince’s foresight was indeed impressive, but the task of blocking them was not an easy one. Although Nora's expression remained unchanged, if she were angered, he would undoubtedly face severe consequences.

"I’m not one to wait for others. If he wishes to see me, he can meet me at the most luxurious inn in the town later," she replied, feeling a wave of fatigue wash over her. She had been so drained lately and just wanted to find a comfortable place to lie down and rest.

"Third Sister, I believe the prince will come out soon. Just wait for a little while longer," Qin Tian pleaded. He felt sorry for the prince—who was he even trying to appease by negotiating with General Xing? It seemed like an uphill battle that yielded no reward.

"Nora smirked, an amused glint in her eyes. "I won’t say this again. If you think you can stop me, go ahead and try."

"Third Sister, please don’t make this difficult for me. If the prince doesn’t get to see you, he will certainly have my head," Qin Tian insisted, feeling the pressure of the prince's orders weighing heavily on him.

"This isn’t about making it hard for you. Clearly, it’s your master who is testing you. If you want to blame someone, blame him. Or you can just come with us. If he catches up, I’ll speak on your behalf," Nangong Nora offered kindly.

"What? You want me to leave the prince and go with you? That’s not possible. I can’t abandon the prince!" Qin Tian shook his head vehemently without even thinking it through. He was a loyal guard, and leaving the prince’s side was out of the question.

"You’re really stubborn. Your prince isn’t a three-year-old who needs you to watch him that closely. I’m offering you a way out, but you’re refusing it. Just prepare to face your master’s wrath," Nora sighed, shaking her head at his obstinacy before taking a step forward again.

"Third Sister, are you really not going to wait for the prince?" Qin Tian asked, feeling a flicker of worry. Was she really going to leave him like this?

"Isn’t my attitude obvious enough?" she replied lazily, throwing a parting line over her shoulder as she continued on her way.

"Third Sister, if the prince catches up, will you really speak on my behalf?" After some consideration, Qin Tian decided that it was more beneficial to stay by her side.

"Of course, I’ll talk to your prince. You can’t stop me, so just stay close and protect me. That way, he won’t have anything to say."

"Alright then, I’ll go with you to find the inn first." And so, Qin Tian reluctantly followed Nangong Nora, leaving Helian Yichen alone to fight his battles back at the manor.
