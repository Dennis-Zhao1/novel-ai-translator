**Chapter 5: Just Bite Me!**

Little Qi noticed that Helian Yichen seemed to be getting angry, so he quickly pulled Xiao Xiao away. He could tell that the prince was genuinely worried about Miss San. He believed that as long as he was there, she would be safe.

Once they left, Helian Yichen's expression immediately changed. He gritted his teeth against the pain and reached down to pick up Nangong Nuo’er, who was rolling on the ground, unable to contain her agony. “Nuo’er, you’re going to be okay. I won’t let anything happen to you.”

“Ah... my head hurts so much... How could this happen... It hurts...” Nangong Nuo’er struggled in his arms, not even realizing she was pressing against his wounds. Her mind was clouded with pain, and all she knew was that her head felt like it was about to explode. What was happening? She tried to calm herself, but the intensity of the pain was unbearable.

“Nuo’er.” His wound opened up further as she thrashed, but there was no time to worry about that now. He carried her to the bed and then quickly found a black coat to put on, concealing the blood seeping from his chest.

“Ah... my head hurts so much! Just let me die!” In a desperate attempt to cope with the pain, Nangong Nuo’er bit down on her own hand, hoping that the sharp pain in her wrist would ease the throbbing in her head. Seeing this, Helian Yichen hurriedly pulled her hand from her mouth, only to discover a deep bite mark already forming. Without thinking, he thrust his wrist towards her, saying, “If you need to bite, then bite mine.”

“Mmm...” Nangong Nuo’er didn’t hesitate. As soon as his wrist was near her lips, she sank her teeth in hard, tasting the metallic tang of blood in her mouth.

Nangong Nuo’er had no idea how long she endured the pain. When her headache finally began to subside, she felt utterly drained. Weakly, she lifted her head and saw Helian Yichen, who looked as pale as a sheet of paper, anxiously watching her from beside the bed. Blood was already seeping from the bite marks she had left on his wrist.

“Is your headache any better?!” Helian Yichen asked nonchalantly, pulling his hand back as if nothing had happened.

“Much better, but your hand is bleeding.” Seeing the blood on his wrist sent a shock through Nangong Nuo’er. She had always kept a cool distance from him—how could he be so selfless?
