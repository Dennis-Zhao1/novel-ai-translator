**Chapter 1: The Arrival of the Month**

The arrival of her monthly cycle meant one thing: she was not pregnant. 

Thank goodness it was the 21st century; the sanitary products they had now were leagues ahead of what people used in the past. Even after using them for several months, she still hadn’t fully adjusted.

"Miss San, are you up yet? It's time for your medicine!" As Nangong Nuoer pondered over her situation, she heard a gentle knock at her door, followed by the familiar voice of Xiaoxiao.

"Yes, come in." Nuoer replied and slipped out of bed, wrapping a robe around herself.

"Miss San, did you sleep well last night?" Seeing the lingering traces of fatigue on Nuoer's face, Xiaoxiao cautiously inquired. This morning, she had spotted the prince leaving Nuoer’s quarters. He had specifically instructed her not to wake her too early. Xiaoxiao placed the medicine on the table, and her eyes were immediately drawn to a stunning bouquet of flowers. She couldn't help but smile and exclaimed, "Miss San, these flowers are beautiful! Did His Highness send them to you last night?"

"Yeah, I didn’t sleep well at all last night," Nuoer responded, glancing at the flowers with a frown. Having him around only made things worse.

"Oh, then let me help you get dressed." Surprised by Nuoer’s admission, Xiaoxiao stepped forward to assist her. Earlier that morning, she had noticed the prince looking vibrant and refreshed. If it weren’t for the fact that Miss San had been wronged, they would likely make a lovely couple by now. But after hearing her side of the story, the prince had changed his demeanor completely. He truly cared for Nuoer and often came by to inquire about her well-being. Xiaoxiao knew Nuoer didn’t like it when they mentioned him in front of her, so she refrained from speaking too much.

"Xiaoxiao, please help me prepare some supplies for my cycle. I think it’s starting today," Nuoer said calmly, showing no signs of embarrassment over such a private matter.

"Miss San, your cycle is a few days late this month compared to last month," Xiaoxiao, who always kept track of Nuoer's dates, said with a sigh of relief upon hearing that it had arrived. Being involved with the prince made her worry that Nuoer might become unexpectedly pregnant.

"Yeah, it’s good that it’s here." With no contraceptive pills or condoms available, she sometimes felt anxious about the possibility of becoming pregnant after sharing a bed with him. Thankfully, now that her cycle had come, those worries were momentarily alleviated.

"Xiaoxiao, how is Ziyan doing? Is she adjusting well since arriving here?" Nuoer stretched lazily and casually asked.
