**Chapter 3: Once Again Under Medication Control**

Herlian Yichen held onto her tightly, his arms wrapped around her as she tried to escape his grasp. The only way to avoid her slaps would be to let her go, but he didn’t do that. Instead, he continued to hold her, his handsome face bearing the force of her harsh strike. A sharp pain shot through his cheek, a testament to her unrestrained fury. Yet, he didn’t retaliate; he simply held her silently as he made his way toward the dormitory.

“Let go of me! I don’t want your touch, do you hear me? Let go!” Nangong Nuo’er cried out, landing another blow against him. She expected him to be angry, to respond with fury, but after waiting a moment, he didn’t even flinch, his expression remaining stoic as he carried her further inside. Frustrated, she began to struggle, using both her hands and feet to hit and kick at him, but he remained unfazed, tightening his grip around her instead.

“Nuo’er, please calm down. I don’t want you to hurt yourself,” he said, concern etched on his face as he watched her thrash about in his arms. He held her firmly, worried that she might accidentally fall to the ground.

“Haha... I don’t need your false sympathy! You said you would never like a woman with a drug addiction. I don’t need your concern; just leave! Get out! Arrogant pig, I don’t want your pity or your compassion!” she shouted, her fists pounding against his chest, producing a dull thud with each strike. She wanted him gone; she didn’t want any association with a man who had once looked down on her.

“I’m not here to pity you or to feel sorry for you. I know that whatever I say now, you probably can’t hear, but I need you to understand—I was wrong to misunderstand you. I thought you were the one who chose to take the black jade ointment, which is why I felt disgusted. Now I realize you were framed. Nuo’er, let me help you. I can help you get rid of it,” he insisted, his tone earnest as he carried her into the room, laying her down on the bed. 

When she attempted to rise, he worried she might hurt herself and pressed his body against hers to prevent her from moving.

“It’s too late for words now. Ever since that night when you said those things to me, you’ve been cut out of my life. Herlian Yichen, I am not something you can just pick up when you want and throw away when you don’t. I don’t want your help; just go... get away from me...” 

In that moment, the air in the room thickened with tension, her words slicing through the silence like a knife. Each heartbeat echoed the distance that had grown between them, a chasm filled with pain, misunderstandings, and unspoken truths.
