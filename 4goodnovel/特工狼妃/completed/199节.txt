He hit her with a powerful punch! 

"Humph! My family's third young lady was hurt by your prince, so there's no need for you to throw around sarcastic remarks here." Xiaoxiao's anger towards Helian Yichen had been inadvertently redirected at Qin Tian. Her master had mistreated her beloved third young lady, and there was no way she would give him any friendly treatment.

"My lord didn't mean to, he didn't know that the third young lady was already unwell. Otherwise, he would never have acted like this." Qin Tian felt it necessary to clarify for his master, who cared for her deeply and would never intentionally harm her.

"Humph! You’re not him; how would you know he wouldn’t do something like that? You’re just his servant, of course, you’ll speak up for him. You’re all in the same boat." Xiaoxiao scoffed, her disdain palpable. Regardless of the situation, the fact remained that he had injured her third young lady, and that was enough to warrant her ire.

"Believe it or not, my lord—" Qin Tian attempted to continue, but was abruptly cut off as Xiaoxiao raised her hand. "You don’t need to explain! It’s a fact that your prince hurt my third young lady. I want to sever ties with you from this very moment. I don’t want to hear your voice." They were on their turf; as long as they weren't driven away, they should consider themselves fortunate.

"Xiaoxiao..." Qin Tian wanted to say more, but seeing her look of determination, he found himself unable to continue. It wasn’t him who had harmed the third young lady; why was she directing so much hatred at him? Women could be utterly unreasonable.

"Humph." Xiaoxiao let out a cold snort. Whoever had hurt her third young lady, she would hold a grudge against their entire lineage. She couldn’t express her anger in front of the prince, but was it wrong to show it in front of his subordinate?

"Nu’er, relax a little. Being so tense isn’t good for your health." Since he couldn’t stop her, it was easy for him to lift the fabric of her clothing from her abdomen. He placed a warm towel on her belly and covered it with a blanket. Using his long fingers, he gently massaged her abdomen through the hot cloth. He could feel her muscles were taut, and he quickly soothed her with soft words.

"Just like a cat weeping for the mouse, pretending to be kind." Since she couldn’t stop him, she gave up struggling altogether. 

As the warm towel pressed against her abdomen, combined with his carefully measured massage, the pain in her belly indeed subsided a great deal, and under his gentle touch, her tight muscles gradually relaxed, accompanied by a warm sensation rising in her heart.
