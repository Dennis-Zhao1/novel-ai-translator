**Here Comes the Show! Part 5**

"Boss, you better be fair and just! Business should never deceive the young or the old. This whip is one I picked out together with her, so you can't play favorites! If you want silver, I can pay whatever it takes."

The woman in green pulled out a gold ingot from her bosom and placed it on the stall with a smile, "As long as you sell me this soft whip, this gold is yours."

"Wow..." The vendor's eyes lit up at the sight of the shimmering gold, and he couldn't help but swallow hard. That ingot could buy him several soft whips!

"Boss, you need to think this through. Our lady is the third miss of the Nangong Manor. If you dare offend us, you can forget about doing business here in the future." Seeing the audacity of the girl in green, who was tempting the vendor with gold, Xiaoxiao quickly stepped in, unwilling to back down, and dropped her master's name.

"You are the third miss of the Nangong Manor?!" The vendor's eyes, which were previously sparkling, dimmed immediately. He certainly wasn't foolish enough to offend the wealthiest family in the area. It seemed today he was fated to miss out on gold, which left him feeling defeated.

"So what if I am the third miss of Nangong Manor? I'm still a cousin of the Golden Dragon Society!" The girl in green paused momentarily upon hearing their association with the Nangong family but quickly regained her composure, smirking with pride.

"Miss, you are from the Golden Dragon Society?!" The vendor's expression changed at her words. There wasn't a merchant in the land who didn't recognize the Golden Dragon Society. Now, he was truly caught in the middle.

"Oh, so you are from the Golden Dragon Society? You northerners have the audacity to come to our southern lands and cause trouble?" Xiaoxiao retorted, unwilling to bow down.

"Xiaoxiao, mind your manners! Miss, this whip is very important to me. I hope you can let it go," Nangong Nuo'er interjected. She had learned about the Golden Dragon Society from her books and understood its significant standing in Helian Kingdom. They were responsible for transportation, and now one of their members was here. Could it be related to Helian Yichen’s purpose for being here too?

"What if I say no?!" The girl in green tugged at the end of the whip, her eyes challenging.

"Then don’t blame me for being rude," Nangong Nuo'er replied, suddenly pulling on the front end of the whip with a forceful yank.
