**So, Let's Get Married**

Serena Zhou wiped the sweat from her forehead as she looked up. 

"Since you've made it all the way here, why don't we find a shady spot to have a good chat? The house I bought is right next to that cornfield. Let’s sit there?" 

Without waiting for Leo Sterling’s reply, she shrugged off his grip on her arm and strode ahead.

Leo watched her retreating figure, his teeth clenched in frustration, but ultimately, he decided to follow.

Serena set up a small table in the entryway and brewed some tea, inviting Leo to take a seat. "Mr. Sterling, please have a seat!" 

As she moved the table and prepared the tea, Leo raised his camera, snapping pictures of the lush greenery around, with a cold expression that could rival ice.

It was as if the click of the camera could silence the storm of emotions swirling within him—emotions that had grown wildly chaotic every time he saw Serena.

"You've been living here alone this whole time?" 

Serena poured a cup of tea for Leo, then grabbed some cowpeas and vine vegetables she had picked earlier that morning to start prepping them.

"Yeah, I have."

"What about your phone? Haven't checked it? Not in contact with anyone?" 

Leo observed Serena’s clumsy and slow movements as she prepared the vegetables, struggling to suppress the urge to lend a hand.

At his question, Serena paused her task for a moment. 

"Are you asking if I know about the chaos you've stirred up in the shallow seas over the past six months?"

Leo narrowed his eyes, caught off guard by her sharpness. This woman was always so clever… How was he supposed to proceed now? Or rather, what was the point of this game?

"So you do know! I underestimated you. After I’ve turned Shang Zhou upside down, you're still so unfazed?" 

"I'm not unfazed…" 

Serena continued to focus on her vegetables, her tone serious. "…but you came here, didn’t you?"

"What do you mean by that?" 

She lifted her head and smiled at Leo, a smile that was both charming and enigmatic, one that he found maddeningly attractive.

"I know you targeted Shang Zhou to force me out of hiding. I did struggle with it for a while, but honestly, I don't care about Shang Zhou. As for the Zhou family… I trust you won't harm my family!"

"You really are… so unafraid!" 

Leo gritted his teeth in frustration.

Serena pushed aside the basket of vegetables on the table and leaned forward, looking directly into Leo's eyes with a captivating smile. "I’m not unafraid; I believe in your inherently good nature, Mr. Sterling…”

"Is that so? Inherently good?" 

The phrase only fueled Leo’s anger further.

"Just because I’m inherently good, you think it’s acceptable to scheme and hurt me time and again? Serena Zhou, I’ve never met a woman as ruthless as you!" 

…And he hadn’t met anyone who could ignite such a fire in him.

Despite their breakup, despite knowing she had once pursued him only to use him, despite the fact that he had a line of beautiful women waiting to throw themselves at him, he still couldn’t muster any interest in them. 

He was stubborn and had a bit of a cleanliness obsession. 

He felt like he had lived in a well for so long, convinced that the piece of sky above him was the most beautiful in the world—even after climbing out. 

Even now, he still believed that the view from the well was the most stunning.

The intense hatred he felt for Serena had faded somewhat during her sudden disappearance over the past six months. 

When he sent people to search for her everywhere and found no trace, it didn’t matter how hard he dealt with Shang Zhou; he still received no news from Serena. 

All that filled him was worry and panic—nothing else.

Serena was simply…

"I'm sorry!" 

When it came to past grievances, Serena never made excuses; she was straightforward in admitting her mistakes.

"I'm sorry? Just like that?" 

"I owe you, I know. I’ll repay you..." 

"You'll repay me?" 

Her nonchalant tone only served to infuriate Leo further, and he couldn’t help but laugh through gritted teeth.

“…How will you repay me?" 

Serena rested her chin on her hands, her gaze deep and sincere. 

"You tell me how, and I’ll do it."

"Is that so?" 

Serena nodded earnestly, her expression unwavering.

Leo tightened his grip on the camera, his knuckles turning white. 

"Then… let’s get married…"
