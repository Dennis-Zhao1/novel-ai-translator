Chapter 1: The Stolen Household Registration

Serena Zhou could see the look on her grandfather's face, one that clearly indicated he had caught on to her schemes. With a determined expression, she decided to stop hiding her intentions. “Don’t worry, Grandpa. I’m just looking for justice. Whether it was the last fire or the death of my parents… this is a debt that the Xue family owes us. No matter what it takes, I will get it back!”

Grandpa Zhou looked at her youthful face, so full of cold determination, and hesitated to speak. “The last fire… was it really his doing?”

Serena nodded. The man, Sheng Qingtang, was nothing but a remnant of his former self, and Yan Jiajun left behind a mess that was impossible to ignore. She had already placed people to keep an eye on them.

It certainly wasn’t Duan Kangyu. At that time, Duan had shown her a glimmer of compassion.

“So, do you want me to go stay with Duan for a while?” Grandpa Zhou’s furrowed brow deepened with pain.

After a moment of silence, he nodded, defeated. “I… I’ll talk to him…”

Serena thought for a moment and agreed with a simple, “Okay.” But she knew talking wouldn’t change anything. Her parents had lost their lives, and her brother had almost met the same fate. This man was completely lost to madness.

“Serena, about Duan Kangyu and Tang Ying…”

Serena’s gaze fell on the household registration document of Sheng Qingtang on her grandfather’s desk. “Don’t worry, Grandpa. Once I become part of the Sheng family, Duan Kangyu will be no threat. As for Tang Ying… she’s already in prison. The law will punish her for her crimes, and I don’t have the energy to care about her any further!”

Grandpa Zhou’s expression turned dark. “Is this little boy from the Sheng family the one you’re seeing?”

The word “seeing” stung Serena’s ears, but she didn’t want to explain too much to her grandfather. She vaguely replied, “We’ve been together for over six months. Our relationship is deep and stable…”

Grandpa Zhou narrowed his eyes, a sharp glint in his gaze. “Is that all there is to it? Are you planning to treat this boy like that summer gentleman treated your brother?”

His tone was laced with anger. “Serena, I won’t allow you to do this! Those methods are too dirty, too despicable! And I can tell you, if the Sheng family finds out about your plans, you won’t be able to enter their door!”

Serena ignored her grandfather’s reprimands and warnings, her tone flat as she asked, “Grandpa, have you investigated Xia Xiuhe?”

“Why do you ask that?”

Serena didn’t answer, continuing, “I think there should have been a thorough investigation. Did you find anything unusual before…?”

Zhou Jingchen and Xia Xiuhe were both young men. Although their relationship wasn’t public, they shared meals, lived together, and spent their leisure time together. Even though Xia Xiuhe was Zhou Jingchen’s assistant, their closeness was undeniable. Over time, it became hard to ignore the feelings that passed between them.

Zhou Jingchen had always kept his orientation a secret. His family knew, but before Xia Xiuhe, he hadn’t had any stable partner. Therefore, Grandpa Zhou turned a blind eye and didn’t question it much. 

But once Xia Xiuhe entered Zhou Jingchen’s life, always sticking by his side, it became a different story. Wherever Zhou Jingchen went, Xia Xiuhe was there too. Zhou Jingchen’s friends became Xia Xiuhe’s friends, and the Zhou family got along well with Xia Xiuhe, who seemed to grow into an indispensable part of Zhou Jingchen’s life.

They lived together, worked together, made money together, went on vacations together, and enjoyed the richness of life together. If this continued, how could Zhou Jingchen possibly lead a conventional life?

Naturally, Grandpa Zhou was worried and would investigate Xia Xiuhe. But before Xia Xiuhe dug a deep pit and successfully pushed Zhou Jingchen into it, Zhou Yunfang hadn’t discovered anything amiss about him.

Grandpa Zhou was furious, so when Serena brought this up, his anger flared. “What are you trying to say?”

Serena’s gaze was icy. “Grandpa, have you never considered he might be connected to the Sheng family?”

Grandpa Zhou’s expression froze again. “That Xia guy is also…?”

“As far as I know, he is…”

Serena bent down to pick up the household registration document of Sheng Qingtang from the desk. Her fingertips turned pale from gripping it too tightly as she spat, “If the Sheng family can use such dirty tricks against my brother, why can’t I repay them in kind?!”

Grandpa Zhou was at a loss for words. He opened his mouth as if to persuade her but ended up closing it helplessly. Zhou Jingchen was his most beloved grandson. How could someone who dared to scheme against him not face retribution? What more could he say?

After leaving her grandfather’s study, Serena went to find Ms. Meng and retrieved her household registration page. To her surprise, it was still intact despite the last fire, though the edges were slightly singed. Since there was no fire at home and she didn’t smoke, she had to borrow a lighter from Lin Cheng.

Lin Cheng, unsure of what was happening, handed her the lighter. Serena took it, lit the edge of the document, and set it ablaze. Lin Cheng, with a cigarette hanging from his mouth, was startled. “Miss Zhou, what are you doing…?”

Watching the flames dance, Serena released her grip, and the charred page fell to the floor. She quickly stomped out the fire and picked it up, brushing off the ashes before asking Lin Cheng to take her to Sheng Qingtang’s apartment.

Though it was late at night, Sheng Qingtang was still awake, anxiously waiting for Serena's return. As soon as they met, their passion ignited, and they indulged in each other’s warmth and affection.

Once they caught their breath and lay entwined, Serena, barefoot, suddenly jumped off the bed. She pulled out the charred household registration page from her pocket and presented it to Sheng.

“Little Qingtang, I snuck out my household registration! Let’s pick a good day to get our marriage certificate!”

Sheng Qingtang was taken aback. He thought Serena was only joking to appease him earlier… gazing at the now misshapen document in her hands, he exclaimed, “You… really stole it?”

Serena nodded earnestly. “Yes, I promised you! So, while Grandpa and Ms. Meng were asleep, I took it…”

She nestled into Sheng's embrace, her voice filled with sweet anticipation. “...This way, we can get our certificate, be together for a lifetime, and never part again. Little Qingtang, when do you think we should go to get our certificate?”

Sheng was surprised by how easily Serena was convinced, and while he felt a surge of joy and gratitude for her bold move, he sighed and said, “Sister, the reason I suddenly suggested going to get our certificate today was to test how you truly feel about me. You know, I’ve always felt insecure in this relationship…”

At this, Serena shot up from Sheng’s embrace, frowning as she asked coldly, “What do you mean by that? Are you saying that I stole my household registration for your sake, but now you don’t want to marry me?”
