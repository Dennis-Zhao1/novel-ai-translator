**We Should Be Together for a Lifetime**

"You did a paternity test when you were eleven, and your parents..." 

Leo Sterling gave a soft "Hmm," his voice calm as he continued, "My parents never really liked me. In my memories, they were hardly ever alone in front of me..." 

"Only when there were family matters or things at my grandmother's place would they show up. Whenever I saw them, they were always surrounded by many people..." 

"I don’t even have any memories of them holding me or speaking to me kindly. At first, I thought this was normal; I assumed other kids' parents treated them the same way..." 

"It wasn't until I started kindergarten and saw how my classmates interacted with their parents that I gradually realized, oh, others’ parents hug them, kiss them, smile at them, buy them candy, and comfort them when they fall..." 

These memories, Leo thought he had buried deep, were merely tied to a thin thread of rationality, reminding him that there was an insurmountable chasm between him and his family. 

So he could walk his own path without the Sterlings. 

Mom and Dad were just titles; they didn’t hold any real significance. 

In his childhood, he had certainly also gotten stuck in a rut at times. 

But over time, he had learned to let go. 

Serena Zhou never expected the relationship between Leo and his parents would be so distant and cold. 

Her heart ached as she watched him, quietly listening to his calm recounting of this painful chapter. 

Leo paused, sighed, and asked Serena, "You must be really curious about why my parents treated me like this, right?" 

Serena nodded gently. 

Leo's eyes glistened with moisture, and his tone suddenly turned heavy. 

He said, "I once had a brother and a sister, but they both passed away ten years ago..." 

Mentioning his siblings weighed heavily on Leo, and his voice quivered with sorrow. 

"I was a twin with my brother. He was born weighing less than two pounds, but I was over five. He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and several congenital diseases right after birth, and later they found out he had congenital leukemia..." 

"He hardly ever left the hospital after he was born. I, on the other hand, grew up almost never getting sick..." 

The contrast was stark and tragic. 

General Sterling and Professor Lin found it hard to accept this outcome. 

They were twins, yet one was frail from birth, while the other was vibrant and healthy, untouched by illness. 

"To cure my brother, my parents tried many methods. They even believed in superstitions and sought out so-called masters. The so-called expert told them that my brother and I were fated to oppose each other, destined for only one of us to live..." 

"I rarely saw my brother growing up. Even when I was taken to the hospital for matching tests, they would take me away as soon as it was done..." 

"I think I was about six when one day my mom took me to the riverbank, held my head down, and almost drowned me. If my grandmother hadn't appeared just in time, I probably would have died..." 

"That was probably why my grandmother kept me close after that, never allowing my parents to see me alone..." 

"As I grew a bit older, I secretly snuck into the hospital to see my brother, only to be caught by General Sterling, who gave me a harsh beating..." 

Later, Leo learned of the so-called master's prophecy and, having seen his brother lying in a hospital bed, he began to believe it. 

Maybe it was true that he was the reason his brother suffered. 

So he didn't blame his parents for their indifference and resentment toward him, nor did he hold it against them for wishing he were dead, an action they had attempted more than once. 

During those times of confusion and eventual clarity, Leo endured immense mental torment. 

In the end, he threw himself into the very river his mother had tried to drown him in, clutching a rock. 

Perhaps he was the most unnecessary and unworthy of existence. 

If he died, maybe his brother could live. 

But unfortunately, he didn’t die; he was pulled out by Adam Song. 

And then he got beaten up pretty badly. 

Later, his parents had a sister. 

Sadly, she was just like his brother, diagnosed with congenital leukemia shortly after birth. 

Once again, Leo was dragged into the hospital for a matching test. 

Though he matched successfully both times, in the end, his brother and sister both left the world. 

After that, he didn’t see his parents for several years. 

It wasn’t until his grandmother’s seventieth birthday that he caught a glimpse of General Sterling and Professor Lin from a distance at the banquet. 

That year, he had just been accepted into a prestigious university. 

When Leo left Qingheng City, he thought that his relationship with General Sterling and his wife would remain forever estranged, like two strangers passing in the night. 

But during his freshman year, General Sterling fell gravely ill, and Professor Lin was involved in a car accident. 

Having truly faced life and death, they seemed to have gained a bit of perspective. 

Though they still treated Leo coldly and distantly, they expressed a hope that he could return to the Sterling family a couple of times each year. 

Despite holding onto grudges from the past, Leo complied with his aunt and uncle's urging and returned to the Sterling family for a few days each year, fulfilling his duties as their son. 

The meals he prepared were never praised by General Sterling and his wife, but they still ate them. 

The gifts he bought were accepted, though he never saw them used. 

When he suggested hiking together, they would agree, albeit keeping a considerable distance between them. 

But they never shared their hearts; they never showed concern for his life or studies. 

Their relationship was just a little closer than that of strangers. 

They were both constrained by politeness. 

Today’s biting words were nearly unprecedented from Leo. 

This was the first time... 

He thought he had long given up on any expectations of General Sterling and his wife. 

But today... 

Mia said, "Leo, you need to understand your parents; they've had such a tough journey..." 

Adam added, "Once your parents are a bit older, maybe when you start a family and have kids, their relationship with you will naturally become closer..." 

After hearing all this, Serena said, "None of this is your fault, don’t blame yourself. Little Leo, I feel for you!" 

Serena urged Leo to pull over, then pulled him out of the car and hugged him tightly. 

Leo’s thoughts drifted back to his brother and sister, and his emotions began to spiral out of control. 

He quietly held Serena for a while, gradually calming down. 

He said, "I'm sorry, Serena, I shouldn't have told you about all this..." 

Serena gently shook her head, reassuring him, "There's no need to apologize, Leo. I want to know everything about you—good or bad..." 

Serena's voice was soft and near, "We should be together for a lifetime, so we can't just share the good parts of our lives; we need to bear the burdens of the bad parts too!"
