**What Do You Even Take Love For?**

Leo Sterling couldn't take it anymore. He stood up in anger, his hands pressed against the table, leaning in close to glare at Serena Zhou. His eyes were ablaze with fury, as if he wanted to consume her whole.

Serena Zhou, undaunted, continued to poke the bear. "You say you're worried he'll catch something... but there's nothing to be concerned about. I'll arrange for him to get a check-up later..." She lightly tapped her fingers against the stone table, her tone tinged with regret.

"...It’s a pity I didn’t get a chance to ask him for his number before you showed up. Leo, if you're not planning to date me, could you please give me Yang Yang's phone number?"

Leo's jaw clenched tightly, his eyes nearly popping out of their sockets, as if he was about to explode at any moment. "Serena Zhou, do you really have to chase after a man?"

Unfazed, Serena looked at him calmly. "My search for a man is my personal business. It's neither illegal nor immoral, so why shouldn't I?"

"Don't worry, Serena Zhou. I’m not someone who will cling to you. If you don't want me, I won't pursue you. But you can't refuse me and then try to stop me from finding someone else. I can't understand your reasoning. To be honest, Leo..."

Serena leaned a little closer, her voice soft yet sharp, "What exactly do you want?"

Leo himself didn’t know what he wanted. All he knew was that he couldn’t just sit back and watch Serena Zhou chase after another man. Especially not Yang Yang, who was a total loser.

But he also couldn't convince himself to be a kept man, especially not for a relationship that was set to last only three months.

He understood what Serena wanted, but the kind of intimacy he craved was not like this at all. Leo's jaw tightened as he felt the pressure build up in his cheeks. Under Serena's piercing gaze, he spoke in a low voice, "I want you to stay away from Yang Yang..."

"Why?" 

Leo's tone grew weaker, losing some of its coldness. "He's my classmate. You can't date someone I know; it makes me uncomfortable!"

"Is that really all there is to it?" 

Leo nodded slowly, turning his head away, gritting his teeth, "Yes!" 

Serena straightened up, contemplating for a moment before conceding. "Fine, I won’t look for someone at Qian University; I’ll transfer to another school."

Leo turned his head back around, "Do you have to look for someone at university?" 

Serena gazed directly at Leo, her eyes sparkling with admiration. "Before I met you, I didn’t feel the need to seek anyone from a specific group or age range. But after meeting you, I've found a reference point and set a standard. I want someone like you..."

Serena genuinely liked Leo—handsome, fit, with an air of aloofness and pride, both stubborn and quirky. He was utterly adorable!

Leo gritted his teeth, his anger flaring. "Serena Zhou, I’m not a kept man!"

The idea of her wanting someone like him did nothing to soothe Leo’s temper; in fact, it only stoked the flames of his irritation. He never expected Serena would see him as someone who could be taken care of like that...

Serena quickly explained, "I don’t think of you that way..."

"Then what did you mean by that?" 

Serena rested her chin on her hand, taking a moment to think. "Leo, I really like you, but right now I can't give you the commitment you want. I know you like me too. When you said you wanted to be with me, you meant it, and I take that seriously. At least until I get engaged, I want to date you sincerely. So can we…"

"No!" Leo interrupted sharply, rejecting her outright. He wanted far more than just three months with her. A relationship with an expiration date was even more tragic if taken seriously.

Even now, before they were officially together, she had already impacted him deeply. If they were to actually be in a relationship for three months, he knew he wouldn’t be able to let go.

Leo was painfully aware of his own stubbornness. Once he set his mind on someone or something, he would never let go unless it became utterly impossible to continue.

In that moment, Leo had to admit that he was craving something from Serena. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be so worked up about her business.

"Since you can’t..." Serena sighed in resignation, "then don’t waste my time!"

With that, she felt there was no need to continue the conversation any further. She stood up to leave, but as she passed by Leo, he grabbed her wrist.

"Serena Zhou, if all you want is a man to gently take your virginity, then I could reluctantly accept that..." 

Leo turned to face her directly, his eyes cold and expression harsh, devoid of any softness. He gritted his teeth, "…I can take you to a hotel right now."

He held onto Serena's wrist, seemingly serious about dragging her off to a hotel. 

Serena frowned and shook him off, looking weary. "Sorry, I'm not into one-night stands."

"You’re not into one-night stands?" Leo scoffed, infuriated. "Aren't you just looking for a guy to take your virginity?"

Serena’s tone was calm and steady. "You’re mistaken. I’m not just looking for a man to sleep with; I want to experience a relationship. I’ve never dated anyone before, and I don’t want to have any regrets..."

She envisioned herself, a pure woman, about to get engaged to an older man who clearly wouldn’t treat her kindly. Even if it was a last resort, there was an inner resistance she didn’t want to ignore.

"You want to find a man to date for three months? But, Serena, there’s no such thing as a relationship with a predetermined expiration date. What do you even take love for?"

Leo found himself increasingly bewildered by Serena's perspective. Was it because she had never been in a relationship that she could so naively think love could follow a script?

She said they could be together, and then if things didn’t work out, they could part ways. Three months would just be three months...

But where in the world did such a relationship exist? 

If she truly could treat it like a mere three-month fling, that would only mean she hadn’t truly fallen for him. Someone who was genuinely invested wouldn’t be able to let go so easily.

Did Serena really like him?

Serena’s emotions flickered in her eyes. After a moment of silence, she finally said, "If it’s kept private, I could date you for a lifetime!"

That cautious statement was made with utmost seriousness, but to Leo, it sounded completely different. 

He gently released Serena's wrist, shaking his head at her, his tone heavy with sorrow. "Serena Zhou, a woman who treats love so lightly doesn’t deserve to talk about a lifetime!"
