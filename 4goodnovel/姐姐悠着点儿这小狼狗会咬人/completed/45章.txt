**Chapter 1: A Youthful Obsession**

It was the age of youth, where passion and obsession intertwined. When Serena Zhou received a voice message from Leo Sterling, she hesitated to listen further after just the first few seconds, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.

It all started that night when the wind howled fiercely. After having a bit too much to drink, Serena found herself wandering alone by the river, the cold breeze brushing against her skin. She gazed at the flowing waters and the couples on the riverbank, and a wave of melancholy washed over her.

In a moment of impulsiveness, she called Leo. Amidst laughter and tears, she rambled on about everything and nothing. When the alcohol wore off, she had little recollection of what she’d said.

The very next morning, Leo sent her that voice message. Serena was perplexed, unsure of what he meant by sending just this one audio clip. After several days of internal conflict, she impulsively texted back: "Hey, little bro, want to hang out?"

As soon as she hit send, Leo replied instantly with an angry emoji. Then, her phone rang. Serena hesitated, staring at the screen. 

"Serena Zhou, pick up the phone!!!" Leo's message blared with urgency.

Imagining the fiery look in his eyes on the other end, she playfully stuck her tongue out at the screen. Just moments before, she had been cuddling with Qin Lili, and it felt utterly revolting. Teasing Leo had alleviated some of her discomfort.

Later that evening, her friend, Jamie Yan, called to invite her out again. This time, Serena didn't come up with an excuse to decline.

The next morning, her assistant, Daisy, walked into Serena's office carrying a stack of documents. Once they finished dealing with business, Daisy informed her that Qin Lili had been burned in a fire at a club near the university and was currently in the hospital.

"There was a sudden fire at the club last night; several people were injured, including Qin Lili and her sister…" 

Serena's hand trembled as she signed documents. Just yesterday, Jamie had mentioned how she would deal with Qin Lili first, and Serena thought she would ask her brother—the police chief—for some undercover assistance regarding the club. She never expected Jamie to take such a ruthless and extreme approach.

"Is Mrs. Shang back yet?" 

"She took a flight last night; she should arrive by noon."

"What about Mu Tingyao?" 

Daisy shook her head. "Mrs. Shang likely won't move against her for now."

Jamie was indeed cold-hearted. On the surface, she would probably maintain a caring facade, but her underlying methods were unpredictable…

After a moment of contemplation, Serena said in a low voice, “Make arrangements to get Mu Tingyao's child out of here first…”

Daisy nodded, then added, “By the way, Mr. Duan sent you a bouquet of roses this morning…”

Serena shot Daisy a surprised look.

Daisy, puzzled, asked, “What should we do with the flowers?”

Serena thought for a moment. “Just set them aside; I’ll take them home tonight.”

Daisy hesitated. “The bouquet is quite large. Should I ask Lin Cheng to help…?”

“No need,” Serena replied. “I’ll handle it myself.”

Daisy reluctantly agreed, not pressing further.

As night fell, when the office was empty, Serena finally freed herself from a pile of heavy work. Passing by Daisy's desk, she frowned at the massive bouquet of flowers. 

Was it really this big? How was she supposed to carry it?

Contemplating whether to call Lin Cheng for help, she ultimately decided to move it herself. It wasn’t heavy, just unwieldy. 

Cradling the bouquet in her arms, it completely obstructed her view. She took the elevator down to the parking garage.

As the elevator doors opened, Serena noticed someone standing to the side. Assuming it was Lin Cheng, she called out, “Hey, Lin, could you help me with these flowers?”

The figure reached out, taking the bouquet from her hands, but then coldly asked, “Where did these flowers come from?”

“Duan Kangyu sent them…” 

Serena instinctively started to answer, only to realize too late that the voice was not Lin Cheng’s, but…

She lowered the bouquet, looking up to meet Leo's intense gaze. A wave of surprise and joy washed over her. “Leo! When did you get back?”

Ignoring her question, Leo scowled and snorted dismissively, then turned and tossed the bouquet into the nearest trash bin.

“Hey—”

Serena tried to stop him, but she was too late. Leo spun around, grabbing her wrist with one hand and her shoulder with the other, pinning her against the wall.

“What are you doing?” she blurted out, her voice tinged with panic.

Leo leaned closer, his handsome face shadowed with intensity. “Were you not the one who wanted to hang out? What did you think I’d do?”

Serena gazed into his stormy eyes, captivated. “You came to see me…”

“Surprised? Did you think…?”

Not expecting Leo to be so forward, Serena’s face lit up with a smile. “Leo, I’m not surprised; I’m happy…”

Before she could finish, she suddenly rose on her toes and kissed him.

In that instant, all her worries evaporated. This feeling—the taste of his lips—was exactly what she had longed for. 

Even though Leo seemed momentarily stunned, Serena was utterly engrossed in the kiss.

Finally, when Leo's grip on her wrists loosened, she immediately wrapped her arms around his neck, deepening the kiss with fervor.

As their lips moved together, the tension between them ignited like a spark, filling the air with an electric energy. 

The anger Leo had felt melted away, replaced by the warmth of their shared memories and the desire that had built up during their time apart. His hands, which had instinctively wanted to push her away, instead found their way to her waist, pulling her closer.

The kiss grew more passionate, their breaths mingling as they lost themselves in each other. 

Finally, they parted, foreheads resting against each other, eyes locked in a gaze full of unspoken emotions.

Leo's eyes reflected a struggle, while Serena's were unabashed in their desire.

“Leo, where should we go?” Serena asked playfully.

After a moment of hesitation, he grumbled, “...the hotel.”

He wasn’t keen on hotels; his apartment had fallen into disarray with dust everywhere. But for the sake of the moment, he relented.

Serena smiled slyly, obediently replying, “You do all the planning; I’ll follow your lead!”

With that, Leo swept her into his arms and headed for the car, a mock huff escaping his lips. “You better pull your weight too!”

Serena nestled her head against his chest, listening to his racing heartbeat, the thrill of excitement coursing through her. 

“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure to feed my little wolf plenty…” 

Even before they got into the car, her hands began to wander, igniting a fire within him.

Leo, feeling overwhelmed by her teasing, couldn’t wait any longer. The moment they got in the car, he cupped her face and kissed her deeply.

Once they arrived at the hotel, as the door clicked shut behind them, the air thickened with an irresistible tension. 

In the month they had spent apart, neither had stopped longing for the other. Their shared love had blossomed into something beautiful and intoxicating.

At that moment, nothing else mattered. A single kiss, a locked gaze, spoke volumes more than any words could convey.

That night, they lost themselves in one another, savoring every moment until the first light of dawn crept in, finally surrendering to slumber in each other's embrace.
