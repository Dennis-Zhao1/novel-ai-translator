**Time Flows On**

Fu Nanchuan's serious apology caught Zhou Jingshu off guard. 

"You don't need to apologize; it's all in the past now..." 

"So, for you, this matter is completely behind us, right?" 

Zhou Jingshu nodded. "It's been behind me for a long time." 

"Then..." Fu Nanchuan hesitated, "Are we still friends moving forward?" 

Zhou Jingshu took a moment to think. "Of course." 

A joyful smile broke across Fu Nanchuan's face. "That’s great! You still consider me a friend..." 

Deep down, he wanted more than just friendship, but he didn't want to scare her away. He was back in the country now and had no plans to leave again. Plus, she had just broken up with that guy, Sheng. 

Time flows on. He couldn't rush this. This time, he was planning for the future!

With the weight of years of uncertainty lifted from his heart, Fu Nanchuan felt exhilarated. Although he hadn’t brought a gift, he visited Zhou Jingchen with a warm attitude that surprised him. After all, Fu had been abroad for years, and now he was back, joking and laughing with Zhou Jingshu, treating her brother with such enthusiasm.

Zhou Jingchen was a bit taken aback. 

He perked up and exchanged pleasantries for a while. 

Zhou Jingchen was about to start his rehabilitation, which prompted Zhou Jingshu to see him off. When he returned to the ward after his session, Zhou Jingshu was still waiting for him. 

"Fu Nanchuan left?" 

"Yeah!" 

"You and him..." 

"Huh?" Zhou Jingshu looked confused. "What about us?" 

Seeing her brother’s inquisitive gaze, she sighed in exasperation. "There’s nothing between me and Fu Nanchuan; we’re just friends." 

"But the way he looks at you, and how friendly he is with me... It seems like he wants more than just friendship," Zhou Jingchen insisted. 

At that moment, Zhou Jingshu had no mental space to speculate about others' feelings. She forced a smile and changed the topic. "Brother, didn’t you have something you wanted to talk to me about?" 

Once the serious topic was brought up, Zhou Jingchen’s expression turned grave. 

"It’s about Tang Ying..." 

Zhou Jingshu narrowed her eyes. "You’re not seriously asking me to let her off the hook, are you?" 

Seeing Zhou Jingchen’s silent demeanor, Zhou Jingshu felt a chill. "You really are considering that?" 

Furrowing her brow, she continued, "I’ve endured a lot to put Tang Ying behind bars..." 

If it weren’t about seeking justice for him, she wouldn’t have felt so humiliated in front of Duan Kangyu. 

But now... 

Zhou Jingshu didn’t know if she was being too ruthless or if her brother was too kind-hearted. 

"I'm sorry, Jingshu. I know you’re doing all this for me, but Duan Kangyu is dead, and the Duan family is left with just an old mother. Tang Ying..." 

"You know she isn’t inherently bad; I was the one who hurt her first..." 

Zhou Jingshu didn’t want to hear those excuses. She closed her eyes and interrupted him. "I’m sorry, brother, but I can forgive Xia Xiuhe, but not Tang Ying..." 

"At least not while I still have a say in this..." 

"If you want to change the situation, then quickly get better and come back to take charge of Shangzhou..." 

"That way, I can return to Hengxue sooner..." 

These past two years had truly drained Zhou Jingshu. She longed to leave everything behind in Qianhai and return to Hengxue or somewhere else... 

"Jingshu, that’s not what I meant. We’re family, and I hope we can discuss everything together..." 

"I know the weight you carry on your shoulders, and I’ll get better as soon as I can, but leaving Shangzhou... Perhaps it would be better in your hands than in mine..." 

"Brother, stop. I’ve never had any intention regarding Shangzhou. What happens to Shangzhou doesn’t concern me much. Once you’re well, I will definitely leave Qianhai..." 

This place made her feel suffocated. 

Sheng Tang had moved the Sheng Group’s headquarters to Qianhai. If she stayed, it would be hard to avoid running into him... 

She didn’t want to see him again. 

Though avoiding him was nearly impossible... 

Before the Sheng Group’s headquarters had officially opened, Zhou Jingshu had already run into Sheng Tang several times. Each time, he was accompanied by a girl named "Keke." 

Every time, he was surrounded by a crowd of admirers. Each time, the coldness in his gaze toward her sent shivers down her spine. 

Zhou Jingshu disliked this antagonistic state of affairs, especially after Sheng Group had snatched two bidding projects from Shangzhou. 

She had a terrible feeling about this development. 

After enduring it for a long time, she finally made up her mind to call Sheng Tang. 

But, unsurprisingly, her number had been blocked. 

Listening to the repeated mechanical voice on the phone saying her call was busy, she thought, is this what they mean by karma? 

But she was patient. Whatever she set her mind to, she would eventually accomplish. 

Sheng Tang ignoring her didn’t matter. 

His targeting of Shangzhou and the Zhou family didn’t matter either. 

She had all the time and patience in the world. 

It felt painful to encounter him. 

But Zhou Jingshu had a knack for acting. No matter the time or place, when facing Sheng Tang, she could always wear a smile and greet him politely. 

Even if he spoke mockingly. 

Even if the women around him changed styles like a wardrobe. 

She could still maintain her composure and respond with grace. 

On the day the Sheng Group officially settled in Qianhai, all the notable figures were invited—except for Shangzhou. 

Since she had ended things with Sheng Tang and he had become the president of Sheng Group, employees who knew the backstory felt uneasy. 

After all, Sheng Group’s actions toward Shangzhou had been rather unfriendly. 

Jiang Jiang said, "Sheng Tang is pretty intimidating now. Jingshu, do you think he will really go after Shangzhou?" 

Zhou Jingshu wasn’t overly worried about Sheng Tang attacking Shangzhou. 

He was just angry with her. It had nothing to do with Shangzhou. 

Her brother had been recovering well lately. Although he still relied on crutches for mobility, his discharge was just around the corner. 

Once her brother was out of the hospital and had recovered enough to take over Shangzhou, she would leave. 

As long as she had no ties to Shangzhou, Sheng Tang wouldn’t have a reason to target it anymore. 

"Jingshu, are you really planning to leave Shangzhou, leave Qianhai?" 

Zhou Jingshu nodded. "Yeah." 

"Going to Hengxue?" 

Zhou Jingshu took a piece of lettuce and wrapped it around the meat. The sizzling pork belly on the grill made her appetite surge. 

"I haven’t decided yet..." 

Although she was indeed hesitating about where to go, she was certain she didn’t want to stay in Qianhai. 

The Sheng Group headquarters had been established in Qianhai for nearly half a year, and Sheng Tang’s intentions toward Shangzhou and the Zhou family were too obvious. 

These past six months had been unbearable for Zhou Jingshu. 

She wished her brother would take over Shangzhou soon so she could finally breathe... 

That day, Fu Nanchuan asked her out for dinner again. 

Zhou Jingshu remembered that she had already turned him down twice before. It felt rude to refuse him a third time, especially since he was the CEO of Haiting. 

Just then, she heard Jiang Jiang mention a new barbecue place that was quite good. 

Zhou Jingshu decided to join Fu Nanchuan to try it out. 

Just as Jiang Jiang had said, the atmosphere, food, and service at the barbecue joint were all excellent. 

Zhou Jingshu had little appetite lately, but today the sizzling meat was too enticing to resist. 

However, just as she sat down and took a few bites, she caught a glimpse of a familiar figure at the door of the private room. 

It was Sheng Tang... 

Zhou Jingshu's gaze dimmed, and the appetite she had just rekindled instantly vanished.
