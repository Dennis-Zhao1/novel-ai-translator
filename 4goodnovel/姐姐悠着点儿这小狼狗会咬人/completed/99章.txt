I never truly gave you my heart."

Leo Sterling spat out the words with bitter resentment, "I wish that everyone in this world who betrays genuine feelings gets their comeuppance..."

Betraying genuine feelings...

Serena Zhou closed her eyes in pain, desperately trying to explain, "I'm sorry, Leo. Although my initial approach to you was not sincere, I truly meant it later on... I just..."

"I never intended to hurt you. From the very beginning, I knew we wouldn't end up together, that we would eventually go our separate ways..."

"But as we spent time together, I poured all my heart and passion into this relationship. When I told you those sweet nothings, they came from a place of sincerity, straight from the heart..."

"But Song Weiming is the true culprit behind my parents' poisoning. He’s the one who coerced and manipulated Xia Xiuhe to get close to my brother. He’s also the mastermind behind the fire that devastated the Zhou family, not to mention the imprisonment of Ms. Meng... He has done so much evil to our family..."

As she spoke about Song Weiming, a flicker of hatred ignited in Serena's eyes.

Even if Song Weiming's true identity was that he was Zhou Yunfang's illegitimate son, her uncle—that blood tie changed nothing. In fact, it only fueled Song Weiming's motives to poison her parents, to harm her and her brother, all to crush the Zhou family.

"Four years ago, my brother and I had already found irrefutable evidence of his crime. If it weren't for Sheng He intervening, Song Weiming would have been executed four years ago..."

"Your aunt... Every time Song Weiming wronged our family, she was there to clean up the mess. As for who’s behind her, I trust you can figure that out."

"Although I don’t know how you learned all of this, what you know may not be the full truth. Leo..."

Serena’s words were earnest.

"I understand that none of this is your fault. I know this surname has burdened you with so much. I truly just wanted to have a simple and pure relationship with you..."

"When the time comes for us to part ways, we would just go our separate ways... I never wanted you to know any of this..."

Her speech was somewhat jumbled, but Leo understood. He let out a cold "humph" and retorted fiercely, "You didn’t want me to know any of this? Do you think that if I didn’t know, your actions wouldn’t hurt me?"

"You say you were sincere, then why couldn’t you tell me everything? Were you afraid I would stop you or betray you? If you want revenge, if you want to deal with Song Weiming and my aunt, if you truly love me and want a future with me..."

"You should have told me all of this sooner instead of hiding it from me and letting me be oblivious, ultimately treating me as a mere pawn in your game..."

Leo’s voice was filled with indignation.

He glared at Serena, his voice strained, "You’ve always seen me as just a chess piece. You claim to be sincere... Ha! Was your sincerity only for those moments we spent together? It’s laughable!"

No.

Not just Serena was laughable.

He was laughable too.

Everything was ridiculous—so damn ridiculous!!

He had thought he could accept being treated like a kept man by Serena. Yet later, he found ways to rationalize it and resigned himself to the situation. He believed that was just how rich people were.

In her social circle, everyone acted that way.

But it turned out, Serena wanted far more than just his youthful body...

Yet no matter what her intentions were, as long as she didn’t treat him as a mere commodity in her schemes, he could accept any outcome. He would willingly choose to stay by her side forever...

"Don’t think that by dumping me, you’ll be better off, Serena Zhou. Listen to me, no matter how many unavoidable things you’ve faced in your past, I owe you nothing..."

"You can’t hold the actions of my uncle or even General Sheng against me..."

Leo's eyes reddened, his teeth clenched, "I refuse to accept this kind of outcome!"

Seeing Leo like this, Serena felt an unbearable pain in her heart.

But everything had happened.

They couldn’t change the outcome.

Even if Leo refused to accept it, it was futile.

Serena had to awaken to reality.

She had many people to protect behind her; she couldn’t take risks, nor could she be reckless. Even though she realized she had deeply, irreversibly fallen for Leo, she didn’t dare gamble everything on this treacherous fate.

The Sheng family... she could not afford to offend!

Serena took a deep breath, attempting to detach herself from her overwhelming emotions, and calmly said, "I know you don’t owe me anything; I owe you. I will always owe you..."

"I can give you everything I have in return, but I can’t continue with you. I’m sorry, Leo. Our relationship has come to an end..."

"...We are destined to have no outcome!"

Her expressionless words sent a whirlwind of anger churning in Leo’s chest, making him feel as if he were being stabbed all over. His cold gaze locked onto her.

Through gritted teeth, Leo said, "Who says we are destined for no outcome? Isn’t it you, Serena Zhou? I never expected you to be so cruel and cold-blooded!"

He pointed to himself, voice rising, "Tell me, Serena Zhou, what have I done to deserve this from you?"

"You haven’t done anything wrong..."

"Then why all this? Just because of the Sheng surname, I’m supposed to be deceived, used, and deeply hurt?"

Tears welled in Leo's eyes.

Serena's face turned pale, unable to counter his accusations.

"Or is it that if I didn’t carry the Sheng name, if I wasn’t Sheng Yuan’s son, you wouldn’t have given me a second glance?"

Serena knew what Leo was trying to verify.

But regardless of what he sought to confirm, the answer would only deepen his sorrow.

She didn’t want to see him hurt.

But she also didn’t want him to be entangled in these emotions, trapped in the past.

It was over for them.

So diving into this dead end wouldn’t change anything.

It would only leave him wounded and exhausted, without any benefit.

Serena understood the wisdom of cutting ties decisively rather than getting tangled up.

So she took a step back, her voice weak, "If I tell you the truth, will you let go and stop clinging to this?"

Clinging?

Ha!

So now in her eyes, his desire for a sincere answer from her was labeled as "clinging"? 

How wonderful!

Leo clenched his jaw, his face stiffening as he forced out two words, "You tell me!"

"Do you remember the accident when you saved me?" Serena spoke softly. "That wasn’t an accident; it was a carefully orchestrated beginning for the two of us..."

"You guessed right. From the very beginning, it was all a trap. I approached you, pursued you, not because you were handsome or because you saved my life..."

"It was simply because you are Sheng Yuan’s son. It was merely a means for me to have leverage in negotiations with Sheng Yuan..."

Serena watched the fierce and feral expression on Leo's face.

Her tone was calm, sealing the deal.

"I never truly gave you my heart, so I can easily trade away this relationship. That’s why I can say it’s over just like that..."
