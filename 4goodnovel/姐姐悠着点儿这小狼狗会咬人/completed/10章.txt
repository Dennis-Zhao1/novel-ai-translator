**My Woman**

“Serena Zhou!!”

Leo Sterling's voice boomed through the air, startling Serena, who had been caught up in conversation with her classmate, the rather flirtatious Yang Yang, whom she’d run into at the Japanese restaurant a few days ago.

Turning her head, Serena frowned slightly, clearly annoyed at the interruption. “Leo? It’s been a while!”

Leo was in no mood for pleasantries. His eyes were ablaze with fury as he glared at her, his voice cold and sharp. “Are you that desperate? Do you even know what kind of man you’re chasing? Do you have any idea how many women he’s been with? Are you not afraid of getting an STD?!”

Serena glanced at Yang, who looked taken aback by Leo’s sudden outburst, and quickly tried to intervene. “Leo, you’re misunderstanding…”

Before she could finish her sentence, Yang, catching on to the fact that Leo was indirectly insulting him, fired back incredulously, “Leo, are you out of your mind? What’s your problem with me? I didn’t do anything to you!”

Yang’s retort only fueled Leo’s anger further. He stepped closer to Yang, towering over him, his voice dripping with menace. “You’re the one who has a problem! How dare you flirt with my woman? Do you want a beating?”

Leo’s fists clenched, his handsome face twisted into a fierce expression. Serena blinked in confusion, glancing between the two men as tension crackled in the air. Finally, her gaze fell on Yang, her eyes lighting up with playful amusement. “Sorry, Yang, but I have some urgent matters to discuss with Leo right now. Could you hold off on your little feud for a moment?”

Without waiting for a response, Serena reached out and grasped Leo’s arm, dragging him out of the school gates. 

Leo’s anger still simmered beneath the surface, but he was conscious of Serena's left hand, which was still bandaged. He tried to pull away but ultimately relented, allowing her to lead him into a secluded park beside the school.

Once they found a quiet spot, Serena sat down, and Leo stood there for a moment, still brimming with unresolved anger, before finally taking a seat across from her. He didn’t bother to look at her; he was still brooding over her apparent eagerness to flirt with Yang.

But Serena’s demeanor was bright and cheerful, a stark contrast to his dark mood, causing a small thrill of satisfaction to bubble up within her. 

When she had noticed Leo had deleted her on WeChat, she had thought it meant the end of their connection. Little did she know that things could take such a dramatic turn.

“I didn’t come to see your classmate, Yang. I came to find you…” Serena started, feeling it was time to clear the air and dispel any misunderstandings.

Seeing Leo’s jealousy was amusing, but she was also a cautious person. She didn’t want to jeopardize the sweet connection they had built over something as trivial as a chance encounter with someone else.

Leo’s expression hardened, his voice cold as ice. “You came to find me? What do you want?”

He clearly didn’t believe her. After all, he had been pretty harsh with his words before, and their last encounter in the hospital had been painfully distant.

Serena pulled a small gift box from her pocket and placed it on the stone table between them, her tone tinged with sadness. “This is the gift you gave me before. I was planning to keep it as a memento, but when you suddenly deleted me from WeChat and blocked my number, I thought you really hated me. So I figured I should return it…”

Leo’s gaze fell on the delicate box, and the anger that had started to fade away surged back. “I don’t take back gifts. If you don’t like it, just throw it away. No need to return it to me!”

He had picked out that necklace with such care, hesitating for ages before deciding to give it to her. But now, his heartfelt gesture felt like it had been crushed beneath the weight of her indifference.

Noticing the darkness in his expression, Serena quickly realized she should drop that topic. “Okay, I’ll just keep it then. It seems a shame to throw away something so expensive,” she replied quietly, tucking the box back into her pocket.

She looked up at Leo, her eyes filled with warmth, but he remained unmoved, turning his gaze away from her.

What a stubborn, adorable guy! 

Serena bit her lip and leaned forward, her voice soft and coaxing. “Leo, have you thought things over these past few days? If you’ve come to a decision…”

Mentioning this again set Leo off. He shot her a fierce look. “Serena Zhou, don’t get ahead of yourself! I’m not going to be your secret lover!”

His words extinguished the smile on her face. She leaned back slightly, lowering her voice. “Then why did you just say I’m your woman?”

That outburst had been a reaction fueled by anger, and Leo was equally furious with himself for saying it. Why did he always lose control around her?

“I know you’re eager to find a man to keep you company… but Yang is a scumbag. If you get involved with him, it’ll be a headache. Besides, I already told you, he’s been with a lot of women. Who knows if he’s got an STD…”

The more he spoke, the tighter his brows furrowed, as if he found his own excuses increasingly ridiculous.

Serena, understanding where this was headed, softly replied, “So you only said I’m your woman to help me get rid of Yang’s advances?”

Leo didn’t answer.

Serena narrowed her eyes, deciding to turn up the heat. “But Leo, are you so sure it was Yang who was pursuing me and not the other way around?”

“What do you mean by that? Didn’t you just say you came to find me?” 

“I did come looking for you at first, but that was just to return your gift. But then I saw Yang, and I thought he was pretty handsome. You mentioned he's had a lot of women, so he must know what he’s doing. Perhaps he’s more suited for me. Maybe he wouldn’t mind being my boyfriend for three months…”

“Serena Zhou!!”
