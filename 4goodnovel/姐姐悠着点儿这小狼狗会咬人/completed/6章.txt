"Good night, Sister."

The title felt foreign on Leo Sterling's lips. He watched as Serena Zhou's mischievous smile danced at the corners of her eyes and mouth, a playful glimmer that made him feel unexpectedly vulnerable.

In a fleeting moment, he sensed that her calling him "Sister" was an intentional tease, meant to draw him in further. His gaze involuntarily slid to her lips, which were painted a luscious red, glistening like freshly ripened fruit under the soft glow of the evening light. Suddenly, Leo felt a wave of heat rush to his cheeks, his mouth dry, as if the air had thickened around them.

Without warning, Serena leaned in closer, her vibrant red lips mere inches from his face. Instinctively, Leo recoiled, and he could almost hear the soft sigh of disappointment escape her lips.

“Don’t be nervous. If you don’t want to call me by my nickname, just call me Sister; after all, I’m quite a bit older than you…” she teased, her tone light, yet laden with an undeniable charm.

“How much older?” Leo asked, trying to deflect the growing tension that was building between them. He attempted to shift his gaze away from her face but found himself captivated, unable to look away.

Serena held up three fingers playfully, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. “So calling me Sister wouldn’t be a loss for you.”

Seeing his brow furrow slightly, she pressed on, “What’s the matter? Is it really that hard? It’s just a title. Why don’t you try calling me Sister?”

Leo hesitated for a couple of seconds before finally uttering, “Sister Zhou…”

That single phrase nearly knocked the breath out of Serena. Her smile vanished in an instant, replaced by a pensive look. She straightened in her seat, her expression turning serious. “Forget it. Just call me Miss Zhou instead. Oh, by the way…”

She pulled out her phone and handed it to him. “Please input your number again. My last phone broke, and I lost all my contacts.”

Leo raised an eyebrow in surprise, realization dawning on him. So that’s why she hadn’t contacted him all week? The feeling of something heavy lifting from his heart was almost palpable. He took her phone and entered his number once more, careful and deliberate.

Serena accepted the phone back, saved the number, and glanced at the time. It was getting late. She opened the car door, ready to leave, but then paused, remembering something. She turned back, pointing at a bag in the backseat. “Oh, I heard you’re preparing for your doctoral exams. That bag is for you. Make sure to study hard! Drive safely; the driver will come by tomorrow to pick up the keys. I’m off now. Bye!”

Leo could sense the slight disappointment radiating from her. Watching her retreating figure, he opened his mouth, wanting to call out to her, but ultimately decided against it.

Serena had walked quite a distance when suddenly, her phone chimed with a text message. She opened it to find a simple yet potent message from Leo: "Sister, good night!"

Staring at those four words, a smile crept onto her lips, rising uncontrollably. In that moment, the deep night felt softer, almost tender.

She found herself gazing at her phone screen, reading those words over and over, battling the urge to turn back. Just as she contemplated how to reply, Leo sent her a friend request on WeChat. She accepted it and quickly typed back, "Good night."

Leo responded almost immediately: "Thank you for the materials, Sister. I’ll study them carefully. You should rest early, don’t tire yourself out. I’m heading home now."

Serena’s heart fluttered at his words, a mix of sweetness and a hint of bitterness lingering in her smile. Having finally obtained Leo’s number, she decided not to hold back any longer. She’d send him messages during her free time, mostly trivial chat, but it felt delightful nonetheless.

Even if Leo sometimes took ages to reply, as if he were busier than her as a CEO, his messages were always sincere. Over the course of the week, they exchanged calls and texts, slowly unraveling the layers of each other’s lives.

Feeling that the moment was right, Serena invited Leo out for dinner that weekend. To avoid interruptions, she chose a high-end, private restaurant with secluded booths for their meeting.

When she arrived, Leo was already waiting for her in one of the booths. Clad in a sleek black business suit, she exuded an air of professionalism and confidence. Today, Leo had also made an effort, sporting a crisp white shirt paired with black casual pants, giving him a more mature appearance.

“Sorry for making you wait. Have you been here long?” Serena asked, casually placing her folder on the empty seat beside her before settling in and calling the waiter for the menu. “You must be hungry. Take a look at what you’d like to eat.”

Not wanting to be rude, Leo accepted the menu and, while flipping through the pages, asked, “Sister… what do you want to eat?”

Despite their frequent contact over the past week, it was the first time he had addressed her as “Sister” in person, making it sound slightly awkward.

Serena laughed at the name. She popped a mint candy into her mouth and pointed to a steak and salad on the menu. 

After Leo ordered, he pulled out a small, exquisitely wrapped gift box and placed it on the table in front of Serena. 

She glanced at the box, surprised. “What’s this?”

“A return gift!” Leo replied lightly. “I thought it would suit you. Open it and see if you like it!”

Serena was taken aback, her heart fluttering. She hadn’t expected such a thoughtful gesture. It felt like he was taking the initiative, and she hadn’t even had to make a move yet…

Was this the infamous ice-cold school prince, Leo Sterling?

With a heart full of anticipation, she opened the gift box to reveal a stunning diamond necklace shaped like an "S," resting on a bed of crimson velvet. The diamonds sparkled brightly, almost blinding her.

“Do you like it?” Leo asked, his eagerness evident.

Caught off guard, Serena could only nod slowly, her eyes wide with surprise.

“Should I put it on you?” he asked, already moving to stand.

Serena suddenly realized. She quickly closed the box and set it aside. “Not yet! I still have something to say first. We can do that after!”
