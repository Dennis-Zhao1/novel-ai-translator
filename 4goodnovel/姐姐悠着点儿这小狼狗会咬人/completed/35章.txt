**Hidden Files on the Computer**

The more Serena Zhou spent time with Leo Sterling, the deeper her feelings for him grew, like a well that never seemed to run dry. She was unsure just how deep this affection would go, but she didn’t fear it. Perhaps, she thought, if this affection continued to deepen, it could blossom into love. She wanted his love!

A mischievous glint sparkled in Leo's eyes as he provocatively said, “What if I really, really, really like you, sis? What kind of reward would I get?”

“What does little Leo want?” Serena asked teasingly.

Leo stared directly into Serena's eyes, his tone a mix of sincerity and playfulness. “I want you to warm my bed… for a lifetime!”

Serena's gaze became dreamy, and she playfully bit his chin, murmuring, “You want me to warm your bed for a lifetime? That’s not impossible, but first, you have to warm me…”

Serena's moist lips brushed against Leo's ear, her voice barely above a whisper. “...Little Leo, I’m so cold. I want you to warm me up…”

In an instant, Leo’s eyes ignited with passion as he gently nipped at Serena’s shoulder, his voice thick with pleasure. “You’re such a tempting enchantress, sis…”

And oh, she truly was a captivating enchantress. With just a glance or a kiss, she could effortlessly capture his heart and soul, leaving him yearning to be forever trapped in this intoxicating, wild dream with her.

Just as Serena and Leo indulged in their passionate interlude, her phone rang, breaking the spell. The call was from Michelle Shang, who brusquely requested to meet. However, Serena had no desire to see Michelle. After all, the night she saved her was more about fate than gratitude.

Regardless of whether Michelle would continue her complicated relationship with Daniel, it was none of Serena's concern. She had a good grasp of Michelle's character. There was no way that Michelle would suddenly shift from disdain to gratitude just because Serena saved her life. Thus, Serena casually declined the invitation, returning to Leo's warm embrace.

“Are you not taking a break this weekend, sis?” Leo asked, feigning innocence.

Although the weather was pleasant, Serena didn’t dare let her guard down. Leo had asked her out on three consecutive weekends, eager to take her on a date. Yet, she had already made plans with Alan for a site visit in the city, leaving her with no choice but to turn him down with a heavy heart.

“City?” Leo pondered for a moment. “That place isn’t too far. Can I come along?”

Before Serena could respond, he added, “I promise not to disturb your work. I’ll just stay at the hotel and wait for you…”

Caught by the sincerity in Leo's pleading eyes, Serena relented. “Okay, then… how about you be my driver?”

Leo raised an eyebrow, feeling a mix of disappointment and acceptance. So he couldn’t be her boyfriend; he could only be her driver? Oh well. Right now, he was too happy in their blissful moments to let that bother him. After all, she was already his.

He gritted his teeth and said, “Alright. I’ll be your driver…”

Before he could finish, his hands slipped under the hem of Serena’s nightgown. Leaning closer, his voice dropped to a husky whisper near her ear. “...Sis, buckle up and hold on tight; I’m taking you on the highway!”

Leo’s voice was low and enticing, his warm breath dancing along Serena's ear, causing her to melt into a puddle of bliss. She wrapped her arms around his neck and praised him genuinely, “Little Leo, your skills are getting better and better…”

Leo’s gentle kisses showered her lips, chin, and neck, his voice thick with affection. “It’s all thanks to your guidance, sis!”

Serena's eyes sparkled with mischief as she shook her head slightly, licking her lips and teasingly replied, “No, it’s just that little Leo is naturally gifted and has an exceptional learning ability…”

She laughed playfully. “...Little Leo, I discovered your hidden files on your computer. Is that where you learned all your tricks?”

Leo froze mid-action. “Sis, that’s not fair! You took a peek at my computer while I was gone!”

“And how are you going to punish me for that?” she teased back.

“Hmm… I’ll punish you by making you practice all my hidden techniques with me!” he declared.

“How long will that take?” she giggled.

“How long? Well, let’s not waste any more time…”

The night deepened, and the soft glow of the bedside lamp cast a warm hue over the room, making the atmosphere particularly enchanting.

On the weekend, Serena brought along a few of her subordinates, including Lin Cheng and Leo, to the city with Alan and two employees from Tianxing Investments. 

Upon arrival, Leo was left at the hotel. It wasn’t until lunchtime that Serena called him to join them for a meal.

Before they sat down, Serena introduced him, “This is Leo Sterling, a college student and my boyfriend. Leo, this is Mr. Alan Lu from Tianxing Investments…”

The words “my boyfriend” exploded in Leo’s ears like fireworks. For a moment, he was at a loss for how to react, standing frozen while nodding awkwardly at the people Serena was introducing him to.

“Sorry, my boyfriend is a bit shy and not great with socializing, so please don’t mind him. Now…” Serena lifted her glass with a bright smile, “...let me toast to everyone for taking the time out of their weekend to be here!”

After a round of toasts, drinks flowed freely, and Leo watched as Serena gracefully poured drinks for others and received toasts in return, hardly touching her food. 

As the meal dragged on, Leo’s brow furrowed slightly in concern.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they finished the meal, and the dishes were already cold. Serena, Alan, and the others all looked flushed, clearly feeling the effects of the alcohol. 

Once the guests departed, Leo wasted no time and scooped up the slightly tipsy Serena, carrying her back to their room and tossing her onto the bed. As he turned to get her some tea to help her sober up, Serena grabbed his wrist.

Seeing her eyes sparkling with a mix of joy and confusion, Leo couldn't resist leaning down to plant a gentle kiss on her lips.

Seizing the moment, Serena wrapped her arms around his neck, shifting from passive to active, transforming their tender kiss into something heated and intense. 

After a passionate exchange, they both pulled back, breathless, and Serena softly teased, “Little Leo, I’ve sacrificed so much to clear my schedule for you this afternoon. How will you reward me?”
