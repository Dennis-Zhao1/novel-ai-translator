She had only granted Sheng Tang the privilege of entering her life.

The night breeze blew gently.

Zhou Jingshu's soft, tender voice sounded particularly sincere and moving. 

“…Little Tang, could you give me a little more time? I'm still waiting for someone to come back. Once she returns, I can be with Duan Kangyu…”

“No need for that.”

The fact that Zhou Jingshu came here to find him, taking the initiative to apologize and explain, brought a mix of joy and discomfort to Sheng Tang's heart. 

He interrupted Zhou Jingshu gently, saying, “I don’t truly want to know about the intricate plots and twists in your life. I just want to see your attitude… and I can see it now.” 

Zhou Jingshu looked a bit dazed. She murmured, “Oh… so you’re not angry anymore?”

Sheng Tang, feeling a rush of energy, quickly moved his flashlight around. 

His warm, clear voice blended with the whispering wind as it reached Zhou Jingshu’s ears. 

“There’s still a bit… but it’s not you I’m angry at, it’s myself!” 

“But you didn’t do anything wrong. Why be angry at yourself? It’s all my fault…” 

Zhou Jingshu’s tone was filled with guilt, her eyes glimmering coldly under the dark night sky. 

Sheng Tang replied softly, “...I have my faults too!” 

Upon hearing this, Zhou Jingshu chuckled lightly, “Little Tang, maybe we’re both fine; it’s just that our communication methods went wrong…” 

Sheng Tang tugged at the corner of his mouth, noncommittal to her statement. 

They were indeed fine. 

But there were real issues between them. 

Sheng Tang attributed the resolution of these issues to time, so he didn’t contradict Zhou Jingshu; instead, he said, “Let’s not talk about this anymore…” 

He waved the flashlight toward the valley, saying, “...Do you see the beam of light? I’m almost there; just wait for me a little longer!” 

Zhou Jingshu looked up and caught sight of the light flashing through the treetops, feeling reassured. 

The two continued to chat casually. 

Before long, the beam of the flashlight grew brighter, transforming from a fleeting shadow into a solid column of light. 

Sheng Tang appeared before Zhou Jingshu, dressed in a silk pajama. 

As soon as Zhou Jingshu saw Sheng Tang, she immediately put away her phone and nestled into his arms, pouting slightly as she whined, “Little Tang, you finally came. It’s so cold up here in the mountains…” 

Sheng Tang tightly wrapped his arms around Zhou Jingshu, finally releasing the breath he had been holding in. 

Hearing her mention the cold, he hurriedly took off his pajama and wrapped it around her. 

Zhou Jingshu hadn’t intended to wear his pajama. 

But upon seeing his bare waist and the hard muscles of his abdomen, she widened her eyes and tightened the fabric around her. 

It was cold at night. 

But with such beauty before her, she couldn’t care less about being modest. 

Zhou Jingshu, nestled in Sheng Tang's embrace, poked at his abs with her fingers and softly asked, “Little Tang, you’re really not angry anymore, right?” 

Sheng Tang’s expression was unreadable, but his gaze toward Zhou Jingshu remained warm and affectionate. 

He didn't answer her question but instead asked back, “What about you? Are you not angry anymore?” 

Zhou Jingshu seemed a bit confused. After thinking for a moment, she honestly replied, “I wasn’t angry at all…” 

Wasn’t he the one who didn’t want her to go on a date with Duan Kangyu on Qixi Festival? 

Why was he asking her? 

Sheng Tang let out a barely audible sigh and gently expressed his regret, “Then I should apologize to you too.” 

Zhou Jingshu blinked, puzzled, “Huh?” 

Sheng Tang said sincerely, “I’m sorry, sister. I was too harsh with you last night. I shouldn’t have vented my anger that way…” 

Zhou Jingshu was taken aback for a moment but then laughed it off casually, “I thought it was something serious. Just that? What’s there to be angry about…” 

Zhou Jingshu cupped Sheng Tang’s face with her hands, standing on her tiptoes to lightly nibble on his chin, whispering, “...You know, in this matter, as long as you don’t hurt me, I consider it a form of playfulness!” 

Although his actions last night were quite rough. 

There was no tenderness or sweet murmurs throughout. 

He had rejected Zhou Jingshu’s alluring pleas and gentle supplications. 

He acted silently, like a relentless, charging wolfdog, his eyes bloodshot. 

He had poured a stream of murky white onto Zhou Jingshu's delicate face. 

And he had forced her to finish with her glistening red lips… 

While Zhou Jingshu had felt a sense of offense and humiliation, she was nonetheless intoxicated by it all. 

She considered it an exhilarating encounter with the man she loved. 

What was done was done. 

There was nothing to dwell on. 

Sheng Tang lowered his head, resting his forehead against Zhou Jingshu’s, softly expressing his self-reproach, “Then I should also apologize to you. You can treat that as playful, but I shouldn’t use it as an excuse to hurt or punish you… I’m sorry, sister. Although I didn’t intend to humiliate you last night, my behavior was indeed over the top. I promise I won’t act that way again!” 

Sheng Tang’s self-reflective and remorseful words filled Zhou Jingshu’s heart. 

She gazed at the handsome young man before her, smiling gently, “It’s okay, Little Tang. I don’t blame you. Just don’t feel guilty.” 

With a thoughtful look, Zhou Jingshu added, “Actually, I found last night quite… thrilling and enjoyable. But next time you plan to do that, please ask for my opinion first. Also…” 

Zhou Jingshu recalled the heart-wrenching scene of waking up alone in bed that morning, her voice tinged with a hint of displeasure. 

“…Afterward, you can’t just leave me alone. You have to hold me while I sleep. When I wake up in the morning, I must see you the moment I open my eyes.” 

As she spoke, Zhou Jingshu remembered the tasteless meal she had at the cafeteria at noon… 

Pouting, she continued, “…And you need to make me breakfast and lunch. It’d be best if I could come home after work and find the soup you made waiting for me…” 

As she spoke, Zhou Jingshu suddenly realized that Sheng Tang had already intruded into many aspects of her life. 

In fact, this was the normal life she had yearned for. 

And this life… she had only granted Sheng Tang the privilege of entering. 

Zhou Jingshu gently caressed Sheng Tang’s handsome face, her expression earnest as she said, “...Little Tang, it seems I’ve shared my whole life with you. Those other people and matters are simply not part of my life…” 

Upon hearing this, Sheng Tang also had some realizations. 

Zhou Jingshu fought against those people in the business world; Duan Kangyu might just be one of her tools. 

Others could only see Zhou Jingshu’s calm, decisive, and upright side. 

But he could see many different aspects of her—playful, scheming, clingy, and passionate. 

With others, she was only cautious and calculating, presenting a false front. 

But with him, she was carefree and warm. 

They were practically in a semi-cohabitation state. 

Whenever Zhou Jingshu wasn’t on business trips, she spent her time at his apartment… Sheng Tang thought he shouldn’t hold Duan Kangyu in such high regard. 

He should trust Zhou Jingshu more and feel at ease. 

His gentle sister was strong. 

He should believe that she could manage her life and future. 

What he needed to do was to integrate himself into her life, and this… he shouldn’t rely solely on her! 

This was something he needed to accomplish!
