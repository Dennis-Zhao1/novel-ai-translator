Let's Be Together

Leo Sterling felt a strange shift in Serena Zhou's emotions in an instant as he noticed her gently pushing the gift box aside. For a moment, he thought perhaps she didn’t like the present he had given her. 

With a hint of anxiety, he asked, “What’s wrong?”

Serena met his gaze with a serious and intense expression, hesitating on how to begin. Just then, a server knocked on the door and entered, bringing their meal. 

“Let’s eat first, and we can talk afterward,” she suggested.

Leo couldn't shake off the unease stemming from her hesitation. Throughout dinner, he observed her deep in thought, her appetite noticeably lacking. He ended up setting down his utensils after only a few bites. 

“Is that all you’re going to eat?” he asked, elegantly wiping his mouth with a napkin, then leaned in with curiosity, “Aren’t you going to say what’s on your mind?”

Serena offered a bittersweet smile and replied lightly, “Oh, it’s nothing major. I just wanted to clarify our relationship…”

Leo’s back stiffened instinctively, and he straightened up in his seat. “How do you want to clarify that?”

Realizing that Serena might be about to confess her feelings, his heart began to race uncontrollably. It was as if, for the first time in his life, his heart was trying to leap out of his chest.

After all, Serena had already confessed to him before, so he wasn’t sure why he felt so nervous now.

“Leo, I…” Serena began, her expression serious as she looked straight into his eyes. Just as she was about to speak, the phone on the table vibrated unexpectedly.

Glancing at the caller ID, she turned to him and said, “Sorry, I need to take this call.” 

With a quick effort to compose herself, she answered the phone, her voice soft and gentle, “Uncle Duan… Yes, alright, I’ll be right there. Wait for me, bye!”

The sweet tone she used while speaking on the phone stirred something possessive in Leo. Though she referred to the caller as “Uncle,” indicating he was merely an elder, it still left a sour taste in his mouth.

Once she hung up, he grumbled, “Are you leaving already?”

Serena smiled lightly and said, “Not yet. I still have something I want to tell you…”

As she was gathering her thoughts, Leo suddenly interjected, “No need.”

“Hmm?”

His eyes brightened with determination as he asserted, “If you’re about to confess your feelings, then there’s no need. I’m willing. Let’s be together!”

Serena froze, her hand that was reaching for the folder halting mid-air, stunned by his sudden declaration. 

After several seconds of silence, she finally gathered herself. Though she found it hard to meet Leo’s gaze, she forced herself to look into his eyes. 

“Leo, I’m not…” 

Letting out a deep sigh, she steeled herself and continued, “...I’m really happy that you like me too, and we can be together. But the definition of being together might differ between us!”

Leo squinted, confusion etched on his face. “What do you mean by that?”

Serena held his gaze firmly, “Leo, I truly like you and sincerely want to be with you, but I must tell you that our time together has a deadline. Because in three months, I’m getting engaged to a much older man who is nineteen years my senior…”

The world seemed to tilt for Leo as he felt a storm brewing in his chest. His brows knitted tightly in shock as he stared at Serena in disbelief. “What?! You have a boyfriend?! And you’re getting engaged?!”

He slammed his hands on the table and stood up, ready to walk out.

Serena hurriedly reached out to stop his hand, desperation in her tone as she explained, “Please don’t go, and don’t be angry. Just hear me out…”

“…He’s not my boyfriend; he’s just a fiancé chosen by my grandfather. I don’t like him; in fact, I detest him. But I have to accept this marriage because our family needs his wealth…”

Serena’s heart raced as she watched the color drain from Leo’s face. 

“Leo, you don’t understand. He’s quite the flirt and has a notorious reputation for mistreating women. I’m scared of him, especially because…”

She couldn’t bring herself to say it, knowing the infamous reputation of Duan Kangyu in matters of the heart. She had never experienced love before, and she did not want to be tainted by him. 

She wanted to find a man she liked, one with good character, and happily give herself to him for the first time…

“…In short, I want to be with you before the engagement. Afterward, if you’re willing, we can still be together, just…”

Serena noticed Leo’s expression darkening, her voice dwindling with each word. She needed to deliver this warning because there was no avoiding her connection to Duan Kangyu. 

“…Our relationship can’t be public!”

Leo looked at her in disbelief, anger bubbling up inside him as he retorted with a bitter laugh, “So you want to… keep me as a secret?”

Serena tightened her grip on his hand, speaking softly, “If I’ve offended you, I’m truly sorry. I just want to be with you…”

Offended? 

Leo never imagined he’d find himself in such a ridiculous situation. This wasn’t just an offense; it was a blatant insult to him! 

A tempest of emotions surged within him, and without thinking, he leaned closer to Serena, his eyes wide as he scrutinized her.

The woman before him, who had occupied his thoughts, bringing him joy and laughter, now seemed utterly despicable. 

With an unfamiliar rage boiling inside him, he coldly corrected, “Miss Zhou, let me clarify your misunderstanding: you don’t want to be with me; you just want to find a man you like to be your cover!”
