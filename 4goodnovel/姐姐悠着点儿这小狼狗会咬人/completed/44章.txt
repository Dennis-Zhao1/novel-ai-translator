**Call Me Serena**

Qin Lili felt a bit taken aback; she never expected that Zhou Serena would share such personal thoughts with her. All along, she had thought of Serena as the epitome of grace, a favored daughter of heaven. It was surprising to learn that Serena's journey had not been without its hardships.

With genuine concern, Qin Lili called out, “President Zhou…” 

But Serena interrupted her softly, asking her not to call her that. “Lili, please, don’t call me President Zhou. It feels too distant.”

“Then what should I call you? Sister?” 

The word "sister" struck Serena like a punch to the gut. It was a term reserved for her little wolf cub; no one else should dare to use it, especially not someone like Qin Lili.

Serena corrected her gently, “Don't call me sister, just call me Serena!”

Qin Lili obediently sweetened her tone, “Serena!” 

Serena smiled warmly, her eyes softening. “Lili…” 

In that moment, they found themselves wrapped in each other’s embrace. 

Qin Lili felt as if she and Serena were cocooned away from the mundane world, tapping into the fragile, tender core of Serena’s soul. Together, they shared their pasts, weaving dreams of a warm, beautiful future.

Serena didn’t hold back; she revealed her ambitions to Qin Lili. She planned to expel the three business giants—Grandpa, Dad, and Son—from the board of directors of the Shang Zhou Corporation, ensuring that from then on, it would only bear the Zhou name. She also intended to sever ties with Duan Kangyu, paving her own path.

“Lili, the road ahead will be tough. Are you truly willing to follow me through the hardships?” 

Qin Lili nodded, her expression earnest. “As long as you don’t leave, I won’t abandon you!”

Serena smiled, satisfied. “I knew I picked the right person.” 

After some light-hearted banter, Serena, sensing the moment was right, cautiously broached the subject of how she planned to deal with Mrs. Shang. 

“Lili, there’s something I need to confess…” 

“What is it?” 

Serena replied, “I’m sorry, but before you started your internship at Shang Zhou, I had someone investigate you…” 

Qin Lili was taken aback. “You… investigated me? Why?” 

Serena was candid. “Because I’ve never fully trusted you…” 

Qin Lili froze, instinctively responding, “Is it because I used to work for Shang Ruzhen?” 

“That’s unrelated.” 

“Then why?” 

Serena met Qin Lili’s gaze directly, speaking earnestly. “It’s because of your sister!” 

“My sister… Serena, you know my sister…” 

Qin Lili felt a surge of displeasure at Serena’s clandestine investigation. She had always assumed that Serena's interest in her was impulsive. Even now, as they shared an intimate moment, she merely hoped Serena could help her keep her job at Shang Zhou. 

To her surprise, Serena had actually delved into her background. Did this mean Serena truly cared about her?

Serena nodded gently. “I’m sorry if you’re upset.” 

“I’m not angry,” Qin Lili replied, “You don’t have to apologize. I understand your position; you need to be cautious in your situation…” 

Serena smiled, her eyes sparkling with genuine admiration. “Lili, you’re so understanding; it’s wonderful!” 

Qin Lili bit her lip, hesitating before she asked, “Serena, since you’ve investigated me and know my sister’s ties to the Shang family, why would you still want me?” 

Qin Lili had a half-sister, Gu Yiyi, who was a trusted aide to Shang Ruzhen’s father, Shang Bingyan. 

Serena paused for a moment before being straightforward. “I don’t want to deceive you, Lili. If it weren’t for that incident where you accidentally found yourself in a compromising situation with Shang Ruzhen, I might have hesitated longer.” 

Qin Lili was taken aback by this unexpected response; it left her momentarily speechless. 

Seeing her confusion, Serena patiently elaborated, “But this situation made me realize it might be an excellent opportunity for us to build trust, deepen our bond, and even collaborate for mutual benefit!” 

Still looking puzzled, Qin Lili struggled to comprehend. 

Serena continued, “I’ve looked into you and your sister; I know you both have valuable connections…” 

Qin Lili straightened, suddenly alert. “You mean…” 

Finally, it clicked for her. Anxiety crept into her expression as she scrutinized Serena. 

Serena cut to the chase. “I do have that intention. You know Shang Zhou isn’t in great shape; I’m overwhelmed. I have to deal with Shang Ruzhen and Duan Kangyu, so I can’t afford to offend Yan Jiajia over you unless…” 

Serena pulled out a mint and popped it into her mouth, speaking softly, “...you convince me it’s worth it. But that worth isn’t just your affection and vows; I need something tangible.” 

Qin Lili bit her lip, torn. 

Serena leaned closer, softly coaxing, “You can discuss it with your sister. I don’t need much—just something on Duan Kangyu or other executives from the Donglou Group will suffice. Consider it your show of trust and affection towards me…” 

“But…” 

“Lili, you wouldn’t want to see me struggling, right? Besides, Yan Jiajia is formidable; she suspects your connection with Shang Ruzhen and knows about his affair with Mu Tingyao… I foresee chaos brewing within the Shang family.” 

“If Yan Jiajia stirs up trouble, the Shang family won’t divorce her, and they can’t lash out at Shang Ruzhen. Who do you think their wrath will fall upon?” 

“Your sister has a close relation with Shang Bingyan. If this escalates… Yan Jiajia’s mother-in-law is even more ruthless than she is!” 

Suddenly, Qin Lili shot up from the sofa, biting her lip, panic flooding her. 

“This matter is too significant. I need to discuss it with my sister…” 

Serena straightened, her expression understanding. “I get it. Lili, I entrust our future to your judgment. Take your time to ponder, but keep in mind that Yan Jiajia is impatient. Since she’s come to confront me about you, your sister’s club…” 

Serena let her words trail off. 

Qin Lili felt as though she had jolted awake from a hazy dream. She cast a hurried glance at Serena and said, “Serena, I… I need to go. I’ll call you after discussing this with my sister.” 

With that, she turned and rushed out. 

Once she left, Serena exhaled deeply, releasing a breath she had been holding. She pulled out her phone and called Lin Cheng, then sent a message to Jiang Jiang. 

After finishing, she stared at the recording sent by Leo Sterling, lost in thought once more.
