**The Best of Both Worlds, Why Not Enjoy It?**

Serena Zhou didn’t argue; her eyes gradually dimmed with each passing moment. Leo Sterling's cold, mocking words made her realize she might have gone too far. She hadn’t anticipated that Leo would react so strongly. 

But now that the conversation had taken this turn, her initial panic settled into a calm resolve. 

“I do want to share a bed with you, Leo,” she said, her voice steady. “But that’s all it is—just sharing a bed. Don’t worry; if you’re with me, I won’t shortchange you. As long as you can satisfy me, I can offer you the rewards you desire. It’s a win-win situation, Leo. Since you like me, why not enjoy it?”

The best of both worlds, why not enjoy it?

Leo felt like he was going to explode. He had thought that her feelings for him were a pure, mutual connection—a serious promise. He never imagined that she was merely attracted to his appearance, wanting to use his body for some base satisfaction…

Gritting his teeth, Leo shot back, “You’re mistaken, Serena. I don’t like you, and… you can’t afford me!”

With that, Leo yanked his hand away, attempting to storm out. 

But Serena wasn’t ready to give up. “Whether or not I can afford you… we can negotiate the terms…”

“You’re the kind of woman who doesn’t deserve to negotiate anything with me!”

He forcefully pulled his hand from Serena’s grasp and kicked a chair behind him aside, storming out of the private room with a fury that made him forget to grab his phone from the table.

Serena didn’t chase after him. 

Defeated, she slumped back into her seat, her mood plummeting. Yet, she still hadn’t given up. Leo… he was a prize she was determined to win!

Her gaze fell on the phone he left behind, and a complex smile crept onto her lips.

In a fit of rage, Leo stormed out of the restaurant and back to his apartment near the school. Frustrated, he smashed the figurine that Serena had given him, one he had long coveted, but even that didn’t quell his anger. 

How despicable! 

What did Serena think he was? A mere plaything? 

No one had dared to humiliate him like this in his entire life! 

To think she wanted to "keep" him? Who did she think she was? 

Leo found it absurdly laughable. He had finally found someone he was genuinely interested in, someone with whom he had considered a serious relationship, only to be slapped in the face like this.

A fire burned in his chest, one that no action could extinguish. The moment he paused to think, his mind was flooded with thoughts of Serena and her airy question, “The best of both worlds, why not enjoy it?”

Did she really believe that him rejecting her was a sign of insanity? 

After all, he was a man. For her, keeping him was merely a way to have him sleep with her without any responsibility, while he could even receive her so-called rewards in return…

To other men, this might be a dream come true. 

But not for him. He absolutely couldn’t stand being so belittled.

Leo lay back on the sofa, his mind replaying every word Serena had thrown at him, filled with anger yet utterly helpless. 

Looking at the shattered figurine scattered across the floor, he couldn’t help but wonder what was wrong with him. 

Why did Serena’s one comment make him lose control like this? 

Serena… no, he couldn’t allow a woman like her to invade his mind and spirit. He would never permit himself to be influenced by someone like her!

Leo got up and opened the fridge, thinking maybe he should drink some alcohol to drown his sorrows. A good binge could help him sleep it off, and when he woke up, he would be free of thoughts of Serena entirely.

But when he opened the fridge, he found not a single bottle of alcohol—there wasn’t even a soda in sight.

Should he go buy some? 

But the thought of sitting alone at home, drinking in silence, felt so pitiful.

Forget it; he’d call a couple of friends and go out for drinks instead.

With a furious slam, he shut the fridge door and rummaged through his pockets for his phone. But it wasn’t there. He searched every corner of the room, still finding nothing.

It finally dawned on him that he had lost his phone.

Damn it!

He slumped down on the sofa, realizing where he likely left it, but he had no intention of involving himself with Serena again.

After mulling it over, he dashed downstairs to borrow a phone from the florist to call Serena’s driver. He had contacted the driver a few times before, so he remembered the number.

When the call connected, the driver, a sturdy middle-aged man named Lin, was polite. “Mr. Sterling, your phone is with Ms. Zhou. She said you should come to the Spring Color Club to get it!”

Spring Color Club?

Hmph!

Serena really knew how to enjoy herself!

Though Leo was unwilling, Lin’s words had made it clear that Serena was deliberately making this difficult.

After a moment’s consideration, Leo decided to take a cab to the Spring Color Club.

“Mr. Sterling, you’re here…” 

As soon as he stepped out of the cab, Lin approached from under a nearby tree, having extinguished his cigarette. “Ms. Zhou might be a while longer; please wait here. I’ll check with Miss Dai to see how long they’ll be.”

Leo was seething with frustration but could only wait with a dark expression.

An hour passed before he finally spotted Serena rushing out the door with a middle-aged woman.

As he hesitated on whether to approach, Lin quickly made his way over to them.

“Ms. Zhou, Miss Dai… oh no, there’s so much blood! Ms. Zhou, your hand… what happened?”

Blood…

Lin’s panicked voice stabbed at Leo’s heart. 

Furrowing his brow, he hurried over, and indeed, he saw that Serena’s left hand was covered in blood. 

Before he could ask anything, Serena cast a pale glance at him, her expression marked by anger and sorrow, and calmly instructed Miss Dai, “Miss Dai, please hand him Mr. Sterling’s phone from my coat pocket.”

Miss Dai retrieved the phone and handed it to Leo. 

But he didn’t take it. His eyes were fixed on Serena’s blood-soaked hand, where a long, deep cut nearly exposed the bone.

Leo felt a sharp pain in his chest as he grasped her wrist, examining the wound closely. “What happened? How did you get this?”

Serena’s expression was stormy, but her tone was eerily calm. “Mr. Sterling, if you don’t plan on being part of my life, then don’t ask questions!”

After she spoke, she tried to pull her hand away, but Leo held on tightly.

“I’m taking you to the hospital!”

Serena shook her head, coldly refusing. “No need.”

Before Leo could protest further, Lin had already pulled up the car and opened the door. “Ms. Zhou, please get in. I’ll take you to the hospital!”

Serena gave Leo a deep look before pulling her hand away and getting into the car, leaving him standing there, filled with concern and confusion.
