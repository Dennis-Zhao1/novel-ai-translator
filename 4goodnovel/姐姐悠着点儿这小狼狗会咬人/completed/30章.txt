Serena Zhou was nothing but a nuisance in Leo Sterling's eyes.

But caught up in the throes of love, Leo couldn't bear the thought of being apart from Serena, especially not now when their romance felt as sweet and intoxicating as honey. He wished they could just stay wrapped up in their little bubble forever. 

“Where are you off to on your business trip, sis? I’ve got nothing going on right now; let me tag along!” Leo asked, his eyes sparkling with hope.

Serena shook her head, turning down Leo’s offer. Even in the midst of their love, she couldn't afford to slack off when it came to work. 

Disappointment flickered across Leo's face. Serena leaned in and pressed a soft kiss on his lips, whispering sweetly, “Once I’m done with this hectic period, let’s pick a beautiful spot for a vacation. Just the two of us…”

She raised an eyebrow at him, her eyes twinkling with mischief as she playfully pinched the front of Leo's shirt. 

Leo stifled a grunt of surprise, his heart racing. The elevator doors opened, and he leaned down, planting a gentle kiss on her forehead. “You better keep your promise.”

Serena nodded, a playful “Mm-hmm” escaping her lips as Leo set her down. But as soon as her feet hit the ground, they were back in each other's arms, reluctant to let go. They kissed again, lost in each other, but time slipped away, and Serena finally had to part from Leo.

Once in the car, she pinched the bridge of her nose, popped a mint in her mouth, and grabbed her phone to dive into a whirlwind of tasks for the day.

She was busy until six in the evening, finally taking a moment to style her hair elegantly before slipping into a refreshing summer dress and heading to the party in Ulsan.

As soon as Serena arrived at the venue, she spotted Dan Kangyu lounging on a beach chair in swimming trunks, wrapped around Sherry Shang, who was in a bikini, laughing and chatting.

Though over forty, Dan looked like he was in his thirties, his physique a testament to years of dedicated training, with not a hint of excess fat around his waist.

Serena walked over to greet them. Dan released Sherry and stood up, offering Serena a warm smile and a few concerned words.

Seeing this, Sherry pouted, her mood darkening as she shoved Dan’s arm off her waist, intent on leaving. 

Dan, however, held her close, whispering soothingly, “Honey, I know you're upset. I’ll make it up to you!”

That was exactly what Sherry wanted to hear. “Dan, you better keep your word! No favoritism later!” she shot back.

Dan’s gaze deepened, his smile affectionate as he leaned in closer to Sherry, lightly biting her ear and murmuring, “If I’m biased, it’ll be in your favor. Serena is nothing to me.”

His words hit like a drumbeat on the battlefield, igniting a fierce look in Sherry's eyes. Without a moment's hesitation, she picked up a glass of champagne and marched towards Serena, not giving her a chance to react. 

In one swift motion, Sherry splashed the entire drink across Serena's face. 

After tossing aside the empty glass, Sherry swung her hand toward Serena, who, caught off guard by the drink, instinctively stepped back—only to realize too late that she was at the edge of the pool.

With a startled gasp, Serena lost her balance and fell into the water.

As Serena splashed into the pool, Sherry, seemingly unaware of the situation, stumbled in after her.

Immediately, Sherry began to flail wildly, sputtering, “Help! Help! I... I can't swim!”

With her limbs thrashing about, Sherry inadvertently kicked Serena several times during her panic. 

Amidst the chaos, Serena heard Sherry's cries for help and a realization struck her: Sherry had asthma. She couldn’t afford to choke on water—if she did…

Just as Serena managed to surface and reached out to grab Sherry, the crowd erupted in cheers, and several people leaped into the water, oblivious to the emergency unfolding.

Panic gripped Serena as she shouted, “Move aside! Someone’s drowning!” But her voice was drowned out by the joyful shouts and splashes surrounding her.

Things got worse when Serena felt a sudden grip around her ankle, pulling her down. Not just her, but it seemed Sherry was also being dragged under.

The grip was strong, and despite her efforts to kick free, Serena couldn't break loose.

Sherry, meanwhile, was gulping down mouthfuls of water, her struggles growing weak and erratic.

If this continued, Sherry would surely drown.

Fear coursed through Serena, and cold sweat dripped down her brow. Summoning every ounce of strength, she kicked and yelled, not knowing how long it took, but finally, she managed to pull Sherry up to the edge of the pool.

But as they surfaced, Serena saw Sherry’s face turn pale, her breathing gone.

Ignoring her fatigue, Serena gasped for air as she began CPR on Sherry, calling out urgently to her friend Dai, “Dai, call for an ambulance!”

As Serena frantically worked to save Sherry, Dan stood at the sidelines, an outsider watching coldly.

It wasn’t until Dai finally called for help and took over CPR from Serena that Dan seemed to snap out of his stupor, staggering over, his movements heavy and unsteady.

The moment Dan approached, the lively atmosphere of the party fell silent, as if everyone finally realized something was wrong. They shifted their attention to the poolside, where Sherry was being revived and Serena was gasping for breath.

Serena felt her heart racing, almost threatening to burst out of her chest. 

She glanced up, casting a cold, furious look at Dan. Then, without hesitation, she hoisted Sherry, who had finally coughed up some water thanks to Dai's efforts, and rushed out of the party.

Though the parking lot was nearby, when Serena reached her car, Lin Cheng was nowhere to be found. 

Dai, panicked, tried calling him, but there was no answer.

Just as Serena was about to carry Sherry down the hill, a car pulled up beside her, revealing the faces of Mr. Su and Mr. Lu from Tianxing Investments.
