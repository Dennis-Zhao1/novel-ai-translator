**Chapter Title: Unraveling Tensions**

Serena Zhou maintained a slight smile, deliberately ignoring the words of her uncle, Leo Sterling. Instead, she posed a question that she already knew would go unanswered. “Uncle, do you remember how the shares of Shangzhou came to be in the hands of my cousin and your son?”

Serena was well aware that Leo would not respond. She continued, her tone steady, “Years ago, my grandmother, furious at my grandfather’s infidelity, withdrew from the management of Shangzhou. She transferred her shares to my father and your son, which is how your family gained a foothold in the company. After all these years, don’t you think the Sterling family has benefited enough from Shangzhou?”

Leo’s face flushed with anger at her words. He shot back fiercely, “Your grandmother willingly gave those shares to our family. You have no right to come here and taunt me!”

Serena’s smile faded, her eyes narrowing as a chilling coldness seeped into her gaze. “As for how willingly my grandmother acted back then, I believe you are more aware than anyone else…”

Her voice turned icy, “Uncle, after all these years of scheming against the Zhou family, don’t you think it’s time you paid a price?”

Leo sprang to his feet, disbelief and fury etched on his face as he glared at Serena. “You, a mere illegitimate child, dare to speak so boldly! You think just because you sit in that chair, you are the head of the Zhou family? Ha! Do you really believe that your little tricks can bring me, Leo Sterling, down?”

Serena regarded the enraged Leo with an air of calm. She had expected him to storm out in a huff, but instead, he grabbed the phone from her desk and threw it down in front of her. “Call your grandfather back! I want to ask him if he remembers his promises!”

Serena chuckled softly, “Perhaps I should ask my grandfather how he felt about that little secretary you both shared back in the day…”

At the mention of that particular subject, Leo’s face turned a deep shade of red. “You… you shameless, ungrateful illegitimate child…”

Serena let out a derisive snort, her expression dripping with disdain. It was absurd that someone so devoid of shame would dare accuse her!

Ignoring Leo’s insults, she picked up the receiver and dialed a number. Leo, caught off guard, didn’t expect her to actually call her grandfather. But as the phone rang, it became clear that Zhou Yunfang had turned his phone off, likely knowing that Serena intended to confront the Sterling family.

“Who are you calling?” Leo demanded, his eyes narrowing.

“Just a moment,” Serena replied coolly as the line connected, and a deep male voice came through. “Hello? Mr. Zhou, the documents have been signed.”

Serena’s eyes sparkled with satisfaction. “Good,” she said, before hanging up. She then looked at Leo with a calm demeanor. “You should be grateful that I, this illegitimate child, still have some conscience. If it weren’t for my sister’s critical condition, I wouldn’t leave a single share of Shangzhou for Dodo…”

Leo was momentarily stunned, his surprise evident. “What… what did you say? Serena Zhou, what do you mean by that?”

Leo Sterling had once been a notorious gambler who drank heavily, a true street thug in his younger days. Even after the Sterling family had risen to prominence thanks to the Zhou family’s grandmother, his rough edges had never fully faded. He tended to resolve issues with brute force and aggression.

Even with a clever son now in politics, Leo still had to clean up after his unreliable father and wasteful son. For years, Serena had wanted to take down the Sterling family, but Leo had connections in the government that made that difficult.

Last year, Leo was finally transferred to another province, where the current leader was none other than Ms. Meng’s brother. Although Ms. Meng was not Serena’s biological mother, she clearly understood the stakes involved in the Zhou family’s affairs.

Serena’s gaze turned cold. “I’m sorry, Uncle, but I don’t have the patience to explain my plans to an old man who’s half out of his mind. The Sterling family may be on the brink of bankruptcy, but I believe that Mr. Shang Ruzhen can still handle a little bit of cash to send you to a retirement home. Though, given his current situation with the casino, you may have to seek help from your wife or Dodo…”

With that, Serena dismissed Leo, calling for her assistant, Daisy, to see him out.

Leo refused to budge. It was clear he was still processing how the negotiation had flipped so suddenly before it had even begun. “Serena Zhou, you’d better clarify your words! Did you steal my things? What do you want from me? Do you think I’m easy to deal with? Wait until my son is out; he will know how to deal with you!”

Clearly, Leo was getting old and losing his edge, as he shouted incoherently. Meanwhile, Daisy’s assistant hurried over to support him.

“Mr. Sterling, you need to calm down. Let’s discuss this rationally with Ms. Zhou!”

But Leo was far from calm. He had come to confront Serena with everything on the line, armed with no real leverage. If not for the recent unfortunate incident, Serena wouldn’t even have returned to the Zhou family, let alone take charge of Shangzhou.

He had thought he could use Leo’s connection to gain something useful, but that had proven to be a miscalculation. 

Serena cast a meaningful glance at the assistant before coolly stating, “I have nothing left to discuss with the Sterlings. Daisy, please escort him out!”

Daisy nodded politely, “Mr. Sterling, let me help you out.”

As she reached for him, Leo, still fueled by rage, grabbed a picture frame from Serena’s desk and hurled it at her. 

With a loud crash, the frame narrowly missed Serena’s head and shattered against the wall behind her.

Serena glanced at the broken frame on the floor, unfazed, and pressed the intercom to summon security to have Leo forcibly removed. 

As Leo was escorted out, he continued to shout, “Serena Zhou, you little ingrate! Do you really think I’m your enemy? The Meng siblings are the ones responsible for your parents’ deaths; you should be going after them!”

Once the security team had Leo “invited” out of the office and into the elevator, the foul-mouthed tirade finally faded away. 

Daisy glanced at Serena, who was focused on her phone. “Ms. Zhou, I just got in touch with Mr. Sheng. He’s with his mentor and confirmed he’s fine, so you can relax now.” 

Serena nodded, her mind already racing with the next moves in this intricate game of power and family loyalty.
