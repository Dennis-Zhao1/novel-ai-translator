**Chapter Title: The Night of Choices**

That night, Leo Sterling cast aside his usual grace and gentleness. The atmosphere was charged, the air thick with unspoken tension. Meanwhile, Serena Zhou found herself in a cycle of emotional turmoil, her heart simmering as she replayed the events over and over in her mind.

The next morning was even worse. Serena awoke alone in a vast bed that felt emptier than ever. Leo hadn’t held her while they slept. After their encounter, he had simply gotten up, showered, and vanished without a word. She had hoped to talk to him, to navigate the confusion swirling inside her, but her body ached with fatigue, making the thought of moving unbearable. She lay there, drifting into a restless sleep once more.

When she finally stirred awake again, she waited for what felt like an eternity. Normally, Leo would be there, showering her with affection, asking if she wanted to sleep more or if she’d like breakfast, teasing her about her favorite dishes. But today, there was only silence.

With a heavy heart, Serena climbed out of bed and wandered around Leo’s apartment, searching for some sign of him. The kitchen was cold and lifeless; her beloved Leo was nowhere to be found. A deep sigh escaped her lips as she returned to her bedroom, changed into clothes, and headed to the office on an empty stomach.

The weight of her thoughts hung heavily on her as she entered the meeting room. Daisy, her assistant, reported on the company’s business dealings with a hint of caution, even when delivering good news. The old man of the business was embroiled in a never-ending debt lawsuit, the opposing party clearly stalling for time. Despite their willingness to negotiate outside of court, the other side remained unyielding, ready to drag things through the legal system.

The corruption case surrounding the businessman, Mr. Shang, was still under wraps but seemed all but confirmed, and he was likely facing prison time with stolen funds set to be reclaimed one by one. To add to the chaos, the city government had found that Mr. Shang's wife was embroiled in a homicide case, leading to her immediate detention.

And as if that weren’t enough, Mr. Shang’s gambling debts had doubled within a week, drawing him into another lawsuit. If he failed to settle the massive debts in time, he would be labeled a deadbeat. Even for a family as wealthy as the Shangs, producing a billion in cash overnight was no easy feat, especially with so many financial pits to fill. They had to realize they were being set up, but without knowing who the mastermind was or how to retaliate, they could only seek alternative methods to defuse the crisis.

Daisy added, “Mr. Shang and his wife went through with their divorce today. He’s walking away with nothing, and nearly all the family assets have been transferred to their daughter, Dora…”

Dora was the child of Mr. Shang and his wife. Daisy paused, raising her tone slightly, “Dora is now the second-largest shareholder of the Shang Group. However, since Mr. Shang is likely to be labeled a deadbeat and given the situation with his wife... until Dora turns eighteen, she won’t be able to participate in the company’s management.”

Serena didn’t feel elated about regaining control over the Shang Group’s decision-making. Instead, a sense of disappointment washed over her. After a moment of silence, she asked, “How are Li Li and her sister doing?”

“Goo Yi Yi’s burns are serious, and she’s still in the hospital. Li Li was discharged but was immediately taken into police custody…” Serena wasn’t surprised by this outcome. The divorce between Mr. Shang and his wife was just the prelude to a much larger drama.

She thought for a moment and instructed, “Keep a close eye on Li Li and her brother.”

Daisy acknowledged her request, then added, “Oh, by the way, Serena, Shang Yu Yan returned to the country yesterday. She’s very upset about the fake divorce agreement between Mr. Shang and his wife, and she reportedly made quite a scene at home…”

Shang Yu Yan had been through quite a bit since her near-drowning incident. Now that she was awake and realized she’d been manipulated by Duan Kang Yu, she was seeking justice. However, the three men of the Shang family had shown her no sympathy, leading her to leave the country in frustration. Before she left, she had sent Serena a heartfelt message containing some confidential information about Duan.

Now back, she was likely hoping to grab a piece of the pie from the divorce and the subsequent division of assets. But Serena knew all too well that she would be disappointed; the men in the Shang family had never considered her a threat.

Despite having once been favored by Duan Kang Yu, Shang Yu Yan was not someone Serena feared. “…Serena, should we take this opportunity to teach Shang Yu Yan a lesson? After all…”

Serena knew Daisy wouldn’t bring up gossip during work unless it was relevant. Shang Yu Yan was known for her poor character and low emotional intelligence; she thrived on drama and gossip. When Serena's brother, Zhao Cheng, severed ties with Xia Xiu He, it was Shang Yu Yan who had instigated the conflict, though it was uncertain whether she acted on her own or was influenced by others.

But Serena was not one to let things slide. She had a tendency to settle scores, and it was clear that she would not allow Shang Yu Yan to continue living unbothered.

“Let her learn a lesson; it’ll do her good,” Serena stated resolutely.

Daisy caught her drift and smiled. “I have just the plan to ensure that Miss Shang remembers whatever minor grievances she faces.”

Serena wasn’t interested in wasting her energy on Shang Yu Yan, but since Daisy had a strategy in mind, she decided to let it be. 

“By the way, Daisy…” 

Daisy was about to leave when Serena called her back. “Have the cafeteria send me a meal today!”

Daisy paused, surprised. Ever since Leo had returned and reconciled with Serena, he had been the one to take care of all her meals. During the summer break, he had devoted his time to her, delivering delicious, lovingly prepared meals at regular intervals. Over time, their relationship had become something of an open secret within the Shang Group.

Daisy had even heard rumors that Serena was living the best of both worlds, effortlessly managing the two men in her life, becoming something of a role model for the younger generation. But now, things seemed different…

Though curious, Daisy didn’t dare to pry further and simply nodded, “Understood,” before leaving the room.
