**My Treasure, I Will Definitely Take Care of You**

Serena Zhou pretended not to hear the double entendre in his words. 

In front of everyone, she put on a cheerful facade, timidly pinching the side seam of Leo Sterling's suit, as if afraid to wrinkle it. 

After Leo playfully pushed Serena away from his embrace, he affectionately patted her head, his gaze and gesture resembling that of a person doting on a cherished pet. Then, he led Mr. Su and the others from the East Tower into the elevator, leaving.

As soon as the elevator doors closed, Serena immediately dropped her smile, straightened her back, and returned to her office. 

With Leo's signed guarantee, the loan application went through swiftly. Later, Serena made a special call to thank him. 

Leo didn’t often answer Serena's calls, but he insisted that she pick up within three seconds whenever he called. 

In response to her gratitude, Leo generously replied that they were family and not to be too polite. He even invited her to dinner after work. 

Serena knew it was likely a trap, but she felt compelled to go. 

To her surprise, she was wrong. 

The lavish Western restaurant was empty except for her and Leo—no other patrons in sight. Instead of bright lights, the place was illuminated by the soft glow of red candles. 

Leo personally cooked a steak for Serena and presented her with nine hundred ninety-nine red roses before they began their meal. 

After dining, he brought out a dessert he had made himself. 

As Serena enjoyed the sweet treat, Leo leaned on the table, cupping his face with both hands, gazing at her with a look of pure, infatuated admiration. 

Serena dipped her spoon into the dessert, her mind racing as she silently cursed him. 

“Serena…” Leo said with deep affection, “…I had some misunderstandings about you before, but now I realize that you might just be the perfect person for me. Sure, you’re not the brightest, but you’re beautiful. You may not be ruthless, but you can endure. Honestly, I used to hate women who pretended to be innocent, especially those whose façade I could see right through. But you…” 

Leo leaned closer, his eyes burning with desire. 

“…you’ve maintained your act so consistently that it makes me curious—if I had you beneath me, would that innocent expression still linger on your face?” 

Serena set her spoon down after a few bites of dessert. Leaning forward with a bright smile, she replied, “So, Uncle Leo doesn’t like innocent little girls? I’ve been pretending to be pure for so long; it’s exhausting. But…” 

Serena twirled a strand of hair in her fingers, her eyes sparkling flirtatiously. “If Uncle Leo really wants to see me in a more passionate light, then we should just get married soon. Once we are legally recognized as husband and wife, I promise to show you my true self, and you can enjoy it to your heart’s content…” 

The atmosphere in the restaurant was delightful. Serena’s words and demeanor were undeniably seductive. 

But Leo wasn’t a naive boy; he was an experienced man. Having encountered all sorts of beauties, he could guess Serena’s intentions. 

With his current status, he had slept with countless stunning men and women, and many more would come pouring towards him. 

His emotional needs were not particularly strong. He enjoyed the thrill of the chase more than the act itself. Unfortunately, most people didn’t require much chasing to fall into his hands. 

Thus, Serena’s clear and active pursuit felt somewhat dull to him. 

Leo preferred a challenge, something difficult to conquer, believing that the harder it was to obtain, the more delicious it would be. 

But in his eyes, Serena simply wasn’t that enticing. 

With that thought, he leaned back in his chair, his expression shifting from longing to disappointment as he said, “Serena, your flirting skills are still too immature. Go practice with that pretty boy of yours, and I hope that the next time we go out, I’ll feel that the time spent on you was worth it…” 

Leo’s mood flipped quickly. Without waiting for Serena to react, he tossed the tablecloth onto the table and stood up to leave. 

Serena stared at Leo’s departing figure, momentarily stunned. 

When she snapped back to reality, she hurriedly stood up and called after him, “Uncle Leo, what exactly do you want from me?” 

Leo didn’t even bother to answer, his indifference only deepening Serena’s frustration. 

This little girl was still too naive; he found no equal fun in her. 

She needed experience, but he couldn’t be bothered to play along! 

After Leo left, Serena glanced at the bodyguard still waiting outside and returned to her seat, feigning frustration as she tousled her hair in annoyance. 

After sitting there for a while, Serena finally decided to leave. 

She had Lin Cheng drive her to Leo’s apartment. 

The moment she saw Leo, Serena felt as if the storm had passed, her soul entering another realm. 

Leo took care of Serena with meticulous attention, almost to the point of spoiling her. 

Serena relished this state of being treated like a delicate flower. 

When at Leo’s apartment, she often lounged on the couch playing on her phone, calling out for anything she wanted. 

“Little Leo, I’m thirsty!” 

In no time, a glass of cool water or juice would be brought to her lips. 

“Little Leo, I’m hungry!” 

Soon, snacks or freshly cut fruits would be offered to her. 

And more often than not, what reached Serena’s lips was the tender, smooth touch of Leo’s own. 

That was the most exquisite flavor she had ever tasted. 

Serena mused that what the ancients referred to as a ‘gentle township’ might just describe a place like Leo’s apartment. 

She often thought to herself that if she could, she would happily be a sloth and spend her days lost in that apartment… 

Yet, she worried that if she became too dependent, Leo might abandon her. 

With her head resting on Leo’s lap as he read, she asked sweetly, “Hey, little Leo, do you think I’m a useless person?” 

At times, Leo found it hard to respond to Serena’s sudden inquiries. 

He set aside his book, pondered for a moment, and gently pinched the tip of Serena’s nose. 

Leaning down, he kissed her lips softly, answering tenderly, “How could my sister be useless? You are my precious treasure, and of course, I will take care of you!” 

Under Serena’s influence, Leo’s words became sweeter, and he was becoming more skilled at charming her. 

Serena was pleased with this development; his words made her heart flutter. 

With a proud smile, Serena wrapped her arms around Leo’s neck and kissed him deeply on the lips. 

“Little Leo, I really, really like you so much…” 

Her big eyes sparkled with captivating light. 

“…You have to like me a lot too, okay?”
