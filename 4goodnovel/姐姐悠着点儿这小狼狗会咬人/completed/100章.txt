**I Will No Longer Love You**

Serena Zhou’s words made Leo Sterling let out a cold laugh.

He mocked her, “Serena, you can switch between lies and truths so effortlessly, all to achieve the results you want. I truly admire your skill…”

“Are you so afraid that I will cling to you, ruin your agreement with General Sterling, and bring disaster and trouble to the Shang family and the Zhou family?”

“Don’t worry, I wouldn’t dream of harming the Shang family or the Zhou family that you’ve fought so hard to protect…” 

He leaned slightly closer, his eyes filled with unrestrained hatred. 

“Don’t think for a second that everything will go according to your plan…”

“I’ll make you understand that I, Leo Sterling, am not a pawn in your game. Even if I foolishly played along before, this piece can’t just be discarded without consequences…”

“From this moment on, Serena, I will reclaim every bit of what you owe me…”

“From this moment on, I will no longer love you!”

“Prepare to face my fury and hatred!”

With clenched teeth, Leo finished his words and turned away, striding off. 

He hadn’t gone far when the driver pulled up beside him. 

Before getting into the car, Leo turned back for one last, deep look at Serena Zhou. 

In that glance, there was no softness or affection left—only an endless chill. 

Once Leo drove away, Serena struggled to crouch down by the roadside. 

Frowning, she pressed her hand against her chest, sinking to the ground for a moment, and finally settled on the curb… 

As dusk fell, fireworks suddenly erupted in the valley. 

Serena wiped her face, stiff and cold from the biting wind. 

It was as if she finally realized, oh, it’s still New Year’s…

But how could this New Year feel so devoid of joy? 

Instead, it was filled with sadness and despair. 

“I will no longer love you…” 

The words Leo had said to her echoed hauntingly in her ears. 

In that moment, she couldn’t help but feel a more profound sense of despair. 

She might have truly lost the most precious treasure in this world! 

Leo… 

She let out a bitter laugh. 

She shouldn’t have allowed herself to fall for him. 

After all, the example of her brother, Cheng, was right before her eyes. 

Yet, she had still let herself fall into what she thought was a manageable relationship. 

Facing the howling cold wind, Serena finally admitted that she had truly fallen in love with Leo Sterling… 

Unfortunately, there was no turning back now. 

Regrettably, she had never considered leaving herself an escape route. 

No matter how difficult the road ahead… 

From now on, she wanted to walk alone! 

“Serena! Serena…” 

At the sound of her name, Serena turned her head. 

In the distance, Mrs. Meng was coming toward her in an electric wheelchair, holding her phone up excitedly. 

Her voice was filled with uncontainable joy. “...Aunt Feng just called to say Cheng is awake! Hurry, let’s go to the hospital!” 

Cheng… her brother, is awake?! 

Serena immediately stood up, unable to believe what she was hearing. 

She rushed forward, her voice trembling with excitement. “Really? My brother… he’s awake?” 

Mrs. Meng, still in disbelief, was on the verge of tears from joy. 

She nodded vigorously at Serena, “Yes, your brother is awake! I’ve already called your grandfather; he’s on his way to the hospital too. We need to hurry!” 

“Okay!” 

The news of Cheng’s awakening made Serena feel as if she had come back to life, filled with strength and hope. 

She called Lin Cheng, who drove her and Mrs. Meng to the hospital. 

Upon arriving, they found Feng Lan examining Cheng. 

Zhou Yunfang had gotten there first. 

Cheng waking up after two years of coma was incredible news for the entire Zhou family. 

After finishing the examination, Feng Lan said that Cheng waking up meant that the damaged nerves in his brain had healed; he was out of danger. The next step was rehabilitation training. 

Due to the serious fractures in his legs from the accident, the priority was to focus on leg rehabilitation. 

“He’s awake; you can go in and see him!” 

As they pushed open the hospital room door, they saw Cheng, having been taken off the ventilator, reclining against the bed. 

Upon seeing his family, he smiled at first, but then tears welled up in his eyes, spilling down his cheeks. 

“Grandpa, Mom, Serena…” 

Cheng greeted them before bursting into tears. 

Zhou Yunfang rushed forward and embraced him tightly, tears streaming down his face. “Cheng, you’re finally awake! You have no idea how long I’ve been waiting for this day…” 

“I’m sorry for worrying you, Grandpa. I’m awake now, I’m fine. Please don’t cry, none of you…” 

How could they not cry? 

Serena considered herself cold and indifferent by nature. 

Yet, witnessing this scene made her nose tingle and her eyes well up. 

Though her life had been far from perfect before Cheng fell into a coma, it had never been as exhausting as it was now. 

Back then, no matter what happened, she at least had someone to rely on. 

“Serena, come here, give me a hug…” 

After hugging and crying with Grandpa Zhou and Mrs. Meng, Cheng smiled and opened his arms toward Serena. 

With a choked voice, she called out “Brother” and fell into his embrace. 

Cheng’s embrace was broad and warm. 

Despite lying motionless in bed for two years, his frail body still radiated strength. 

Her brother was awake. 

She no longer had to bear the burden alone. 

“I know I’ve been lying here for two years; you’ve worked so hard, Serena…” 

Cheng’s comforting words made Serena unable to hold back her tears. 

She wanted to say it hadn’t been hard, that everything was worth it… 

But ultimately, she couldn’t say a word, her voice choked with emotion. 

This embrace felt like it had activated the “injustice” gene within Serena; all she could feel was overwhelming sorrow, and tears streamed down her face, soaking Cheng’s hospital gown. 

If it weren’t for Zhou Yunfang and Mrs. Meng being in the room, 

she would have stayed in Cheng’s arms, crying to her heart's content, just like when she was a child, bullied and feeling wronged. 

“Serena…” 

Knowing Serena as he did, Cheng understood she wasn’t usually very expressive. But today… 

He called for her with unease. 

It was only then that Serena released him. 

“I’m sorry, Brother. I got too emotional…” 

She wiped the tears from her face and stepped back a little. 

Zhou Yunfang looked at her with a complex expression, while Mrs. Meng wore a face of heartache similar to Cheng’s. 

Mrs. Meng held onto Cheng with one hand and grasped Serena’s hand with the other, saying joyfully, “Today is a wonderful day; no more crying!”
