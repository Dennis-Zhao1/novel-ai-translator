**Serena Zhou Had Completely Captivated Leo Sterling**

Serena Zhou noticed Leo Sterling’s brows furrow for a moment before they smoothed out again. Her eyes glimmered mischievously as she continued in a soft tone, “If you think this isn’t enough, or if you feel like this kind of life is too precarious, then I might just have to have a baby for you. But honestly, I think having a child is a hassle; it would definitely affect our little world and the quality of our intimacy…”

Leo hadn’t expected Serena to suddenly steer the conversation in such an unexpected direction. Although he knew she was joking about the “baby,” his thoughts were still easily led astray. The idea of having a child with Serena…

He playfully bumped her forehead with his own, chuckling lightly, a mix of exasperation and fondness in his voice. “I swear, you’re something else, sis. No matter what the topic is, you always manage to twist it back to that. Sometimes I really wonder if you were a seductress in your past life…”

Serena heartily agreed with Leo’s assessment. Leaning in conspiratorially, she whispered teasingly, “I think I was a seductress too, and the wildest kind at that, but only for you…”

Serena had never been shy or bashful; when it came to flirting, she could say the most alluring things without flinching. She blinked at Leo, her eyes sparkling with mischief, and provocatively said, “...Little scholar, do you want to share your energy with your fox sister?”

As soon as she finished speaking, the hand that was cradling Leo’s cheek began to wander restlessly over his body. Leo was utterly enchanted by Serena. He inhaled sharply, unable to hide his helplessness as he replied, “Aren’t you working tomorrow? Come on, let me take you home…”

Serena shook her head defiantly, and Leo caught her wandering hand. She twisted her waist and swayed her hips, her crimson lips parting slightly, her enticing tongue peeking out, simply irresistible. 

“…No. I want to stay here.”

Serena tilted her head back to gaze at the starry sky above. The rocky ground behind them was smooth and clean. In a hushed tone, she said, “Tonight the moonlight is bright, the weather is perfect, and no one will disturb us. Opportunities like this don’t come around every day—are you really willing to pass it up?”

As she spoke, she leaned in closer…

Leo was acutely aware that they were outside in the wilderness. He remembered how Serena had called out his name to the mountains, not only startling him but also waking up the few uncles and aunties he had hired. But Serena was simply intoxicating. She had a way of wrapping him around her finger when it came to this.

Voices clashed in Leo’s mind. One urged him to seize the moment for the thrill that must not be missed, while the other warned against reckless abandon, insisting that passion should be tempered with restraint. But the moment Serena moved closer…

The arguing voices faded into silence. Even the sounds of cicadas and crickets ceased their serenade. At that moment, Leo felt only one thing: he was entwined with Serena in a way that he couldn’t escape, nor did he want to. He willingly surrendered, destined to follow her forever.

Serena had fully captivated Leo Sterling.

The flashlight flickered out.

The night breeze was cool, enveloping the wilderness. The air was infused with the soothing scents of crops, wild grasses, and flowers—a truly intoxicating aroma. Serena always spoke boldly before they embarked on such moments, displaying a carefree attitude, as if she were ravenous with anticipation. Yet, soon after, her energy would wane.

Leo, on the other hand, was usually more reserved. But tonight, bathed in the gentle night air, he felt invigorated…

Finally, Serena lay back against the rock where Leo had placed his sleeping bag, her dark eyes reflecting the vast starry sky, thoughts drifting in disarray. 

“Little Leo, my dear classmate, husband…”

Her whispers flowed like an incantation, dripping with the utmost sensuality.

Leo held Serena tightly, their hearts close, faces nearly touching, gazes locked, lips meeting. They finally transformed the coolness of the night into a burning heat, the dark hues brightening into vivid colors.

Afterward, Leo carried Serena down the mountain. Her clothes were torn in several places, and his sleeping bag was filthy. Concerned that they might frighten the innocent uncles and aunties, Leo quickly called one of the aunties to inform her before making his way back to the car with Serena on his back.

Serena obediently rested against Leo's shoulder, playfully swinging the flashlight from side to side like a mischievous child. As they passed a small stream, she suddenly gasped, her eyes sparkling at the flickering lights in the grass. 

“Wow, are those… fireflies? They’re beautiful! Little Leo, stop for a second; I want to take a picture…”

Serena had only seen fireflies once as a child when camping with her parents, and even then, they were too far away to admire properly. There certainly weren’t as many as there were tonight.

She hopped off Leo’s back and snapped several photos with her phone, enjoying the view for a while. She even considered taking off her shoes to catch a few fireflies to play with.

But Leo, unable to watch her recklessness, stopped her. “The water’s too cold; you can’t. Plus, fireflies are tricky to catch. You might slip… come on, let’s head back!”

Serena pouted, not pleased. “But I rarely get to see fireflies! Little Leo, please let me enjoy them a little longer…”

With a sigh, Leo replied, “If you keep playing, how will you get up for work tomorrow?”

Serena puffed out her cheeks in frustration, softly complaining, “Can’t you be a little more romantic? Don’t rain on my parade when I’m having fun! It’s not every day we get to go out like this…”

Leo raised an eyebrow. Was this even a date? Whatever. Seeing her happy was enough for him, so he decided to keep his mouth shut.

Serena crouched by the stream, dipping her hand into the cool water and shivering. The chill made her abandon the idea of catching fireflies. She took Leo's hand and pulled him to sit quietly in the cornfield beside the stream, appreciating the moment together.

Eventually, exhaustion took over. After yawning twice in a row, Serena finally decided to bid farewell to the enchanting fireflies. 

“Let’s go, Little Leo; it's time to head home!”

Serena dutifully climbed onto Leo’s back this time, lacking the energy to play around. She rested her head on his shoulder, holding the flashlight steadily as they walked home together.

Once they reached the car, Serena was already fighting sleep. She popped a mint into her mouth, trying to stay alert and chat with Leo, worried he might doze off while driving. 

But Leo reassured her, “I’m wide awake; you don’t have to keep me company. Just sleep, okay?”

Serena, overwhelmed by fatigue, couldn’t even muster the energy to joke around with him for a bit. 

“Little Leo, you’re the best…”

As she yawned and rubbed her eyes, it wasn’t long before her head leaned to the side, drifting off to sleep. 

Leo draped his sleeping bag over her, and on the not-so-wide rural road, their car was the only one in sight. 

The lush green corn stood tall on either side, like rows of sentinels guarding their path and their happiness. 

Leo’s gaze was gentle yet resolute, his heart filled to the brim…
