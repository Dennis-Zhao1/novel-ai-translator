**Only Beauty, Not the Kingdom**

Leo Sterling felt a bit inadequate in front of Serena Zhou. 

He had never considered that he could feel so small when it came to a woman. But now, he realized that this feeling of inadequacy wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. As long as Serena was by his side, he was willing to spend his life feeling this way.

Seeing Leo pouting and lost in thought, Serena decided to take matters into her own hands and began to weave a little dream. “... Just wait for me for six more months, okay? Once I rescue Ms. Meng, if I’m still swamped and can’t focus on the wedding, we can just go get the license first, and then we can discuss the wedding later. How does that sound?”

Leo was driving, and Serena couldn’t snuggle up to him, so she resorted to batting her eyelashes and using her softest voice to charm him. 

While waiting for the traffic light to change, he reached out, intertwining their fingers, his touch warm and reassuring. “Alright, I’ll do as you say. But you have to at least bring me back to your place first…”

Serena flashed a mischievous smile, teasing, “Oh, Leo, I could take you home right now…”

In reality, there was no one at the Zhou residence. Serena's brother was away, Ms. Meng had been detained, and even Serena herself spent most of her time at Leo’s apartment. When she thought about it, it had indeed been a while since she had been back home.

Leo was starting to find the nickname “Little Leo” a bit grating. Frowning, he said, “Serena, could you stop calling me that?”

“Why not?” 

Turning his head to give her a charming smile, he responded, “Do I look that small to you? You should know by now!”

Serena shot him a playful glance, scolding, “You rogue!”

Leo laughed, a warm sound that brightened the mood. “Who could possibly outdo you in that department?”

Serena pondered their past interactions and realized that, indeed, she had often been the one leading the charge in their flirtations. Taking it as a compliment, she grinned. “So, does Little Leo enjoy it when his big sister plays the rogue?”

As she leaned closer, whispering sweetly into his ear, Leo couldn’t help but chuckle, feeling a rush of affection. He parked the car, unbuckled his seatbelt, and gently pushed Serena back against the seat.

His eyes sparkled like stars in a cold night sky, radiating warmth and intensity. “Oh, I love it, I’m practically going crazy over it. But remember, you can only be a rogue with me. If you dare to do that with another guy, I’ll make you regret it!”

Leo rarely used vulgar language around Serena; he was usually gentle and considerate. But this side of him felt fresh and thrilling to her.

“Little Leo…” Serena wrapped her arms around his neck, gazing into his handsome face, her heart racing. “You’re so fierce like this, and I love it. What should I do? I feel like I’m becoming more addicted to you. Speaking of which…”

She licked her lips suggestively, leaning closer. “If I really flirted with another man, would you…?”

With a raised eyebrow, she teased, “Should we set a day to try this out in a similar scenario?”

Leo shook his head in exasperation but couldn’t hide the affection in his smile. He felt himself being swept away by Serena's playful spirit, his thoughts inevitably drifting along with her whims. 

“Big sister, how can you be so shameless...” he teased, pinching her nose before pulling her in for a passionate kiss, igniting the atmosphere in the car with undeniable heat. 

That night was nothing short of magical, a whirlwind of emotions and unspoken promises. 

Days passed like a calm river, but Leo couldn't shake the feeling that something had changed since he had suggested they get married and solidify their relationship. Serena seemed to be pulling away, her once clingy affection replaced with a more distant demeanor.

Though she still made time for romantic rendezvous and passionate nights, their interactions felt increasingly superficial. She was more often busy, disappearing for long stretches, sometimes not responding for an entire week. When he called her assistant, she always reported that Serena was occupied, promising she would return his call later.

Yet, no matter how long they went without contact, when they did meet again, Serena was as passionate as ever, whisking him away to bed as if nothing had changed. It was as though their connection revolved solely around their physical relationship, while Serena seemed determined to keep their love life free from the complexities of her work.

Even when Leo tried to pry into her professional life, Serena would brush him off with vague responses, maintaining a perfect facade that everything was fine. 

“We can’t let ourselves be burdened by all these trivial matters. You’ve never cared about this stuff anyway, so don’t force yourself for my sake…” 

“Little Leo, I just want you to be passionate for me. I want to see you love me like you did when we first met; pure, untainted, like a serene landscape that I can lose myself in forever…” 

Her earnest tone melted his heart. “Little Leo, please don’t change, okay?”

Serena was filled with love and tenderness. But Leo felt like he wasn’t in a relationship with Serena; instead, he felt like he was being enveloped by her. 

He wasn’t sure whether he had truly entered Serena's life, but he had given everything he had to her. Whether it was his own projects or collaborations with various local governments, he made sure that Serena had a share in all of it. 

Even when there were no funds for her independent ventures, he would make sure the gaps were filled, regardless of how substantial they were. 

The returns on the investments were notoriously low, and even though he knew he was likely to lose money, he continued to invest, almost as if he couldn’t help himself.

Once, after a night of heavy drinking, a buddy had jokingly remarked to Leo that he seemed to be playing with fire, only focused on the beauty and ignoring the kingdom. 

Leo couldn’t help but think that sometimes, it wasn’t that Serena needed his investments, but rather he was forcing them upon her. 

It seemed he had grown accustomed to giving everything away. 

Ever since he was a child, his parents had never given him anything, only demanding and ordering him to sacrifice for them. They even once considered taking one of his kidneys and half of his liver…

His cold exterior concealed the fact that he was both timid and insecure inside. It felt like he was always the one being rejected while never being the one to turn away from others. 

He was determined to love Serena, and as long as she was with him for life, he would be willing to give her everything. 

The more Serena distanced herself, the more he wanted to treat her better. 

He tried to extricate himself from this relationship, but whenever he found a moment of peace, his mind would inevitably drift back to Serena. It was an unceasing cycle. 

There was a spell where Serena was constantly traveling for work, flying from one part of the country to another. Every time Leo called, she was always busy. 

Frustrated, he decided to play a little game of his own: if she wasn’t contacting him, then he wouldn’t contact her, to see who would fold first. 

A week passed without a word from her. 

Leo felt ridiculous waiting for her call, almost like a lovesick fool. But whenever Serena finally did call, he couldn’t help but pick up excitedly, “Big sister, you’re back?”
