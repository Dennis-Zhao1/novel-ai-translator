"Take it easy, don't throw out your back."

The tone was light, but the meaning and attitude behind it were crystal clear and resolute. 

The words "break up" made Serena Zhou's body tremble involuntarily, as if a cold night breeze had suddenly swooped in, drenching her in autumn frost without any warning. She had thought that after more than two months together, her little wolf cub had been completely tamed. Little did she know that she would turn around and get bitten by him in such a bloody manner.

Facing the tall and chilling figure of the boy before her, Serena slowly stood up again, apologizing once more, "I'm sorry!" Then she turned and left.

Perhaps because both of them had their own plans in mind, they knew full well that neither would let the other walk out of their lives so easily. Thus, this breakup was surprisingly calm and mutually understood. One felt annoyed at how decisively the other had said "break up." The other was secretly fuming at the lack of any attempt to hold on. Yet, they both hid these emotions very well.

Serena returned to her bedroom calmly and changed clothes. She didn't bother packing anything else, leaving quietly.

The next day, Leo Sterling flew back to Qingheng, while Serena went to try on the engagement dress that had been prepared for her and Daniel Kangyu. The dress fit perfectly. As soon as she put it on, Daniel arrived. 

When he saw Serena in the gown, a flicker of something different danced in his eyes. But when it came to delaying the engagement, the words slipped from his mouth effortlessly. 

"Yingying lost her passport and won't be able to make it back before our engagement ceremony, so I've decided to postpone our engagement..."

This announcement was delivered as a notification, leaving no room for discussion. Moreover, the excuse he used was rather flimsy.

Serena froze. The dress that fit her so well suddenly felt constricting. After delivering the news, Daniel stared at her, capturing the fleeting emotions on her face and in her eyes with great detail. 

"Uncle Daniel..." Serena forced her mouth open, too shocked to know what to say.

Daniel reached out and affectionately patted her head, soothingly saying, "Serena, you know I've always considered Yingying like my own daughter. For such a major event as our engagement, I wish for her to be here. Don't worry, Uncle will make it up to you!"

Daniel's coaxing was insincere, and Serena's displeasure was palpable but held back. 

"Go change out of that dress, and I'll give you a ride back to the office!" 

Serena shot him a deep look, biting her lip to suppress her anger, before turning to change out of the gown. 

When she came out, Daniel was indeed still waiting in the lobby. Serena didn't even glance at him as she headed straight for her car. 

Daniel watched her retreating figure with a knowing smile. He took a long stride and quickly caught up to her, taking her hand without hesitation and leading her to his car. 

"Uncle Daniel, I brought a driver, there's no need for you to trouble yourself…" 

Daniel chuckled lightly, his tone soft. "We agreed I'd give you a ride, so stop being difficult. Get in!" 

He opened the passenger door, and Serena shot him a frosty glance before sulkily getting inside. 

Daniel laughed, clearly enjoying himself. He walked around the front of the car and got into the driver's seat, personally driving Serena back to the office. 

Throughout the ride, Serena kept her mouth shut, refusing to speak or even look at Daniel. 

Her sulky, pouty demeanor stirred something in Daniel. 

Once they arrived at the lobby of the Shangzhou Group, after parking, Daniel suddenly reached out and playfully pinched Serena's earlobe—a completely flirtatious move. 

Serena fought the impulse to pull away, turning to glare at him in fury before opening the car door and stepping out. 

She offered no polite thanks and didn’t bid Daniel goodbye with any grace. 

Instead of feeling offended by her rudeness, Daniel found it rather amusing. 

As soon as Serena settled into her office, Daniel called her. She ignored the call, letting it ring. 

Daniel quickly redirected his call to the secretary's office. 

After answering, Secretary Dai informed Serena that Daniel had invited her to dinner that night. 

Just as she was about to decline, Dai added, "Mr. Kangyu said he was hosting the president of the Shengyu Group tonight, along with several city officials." 

Shengyu Group… Serena pondered for a moment before deciding to return Daniel's call. 

As soon as the call connected, before Daniel could say anything, Serena sweetly and obediently called out, "Uncle Daniel." 

However, the response on the other end was heavy breathing and lewd moans. 

Serena's face turned pale instantly, as if that sweet "Uncle Daniel" was a slap across her face. 

She struggled to suppress the urge to hang up the phone. 

Daniel's shaky voice broke through, "Serena, what is it?" 

Serena steadied her emotions and replied coolly, "...I’m sorry, I didn’t realize you were busy. I just wanted to let you know I’ll arrive on time tonight. Oh, and just a kind reminder, take it easy, don't throw out your back!" 

With that, she hung up the phone. 

But before she did, she distinctly heard Daniel's mocking laughter on the other end. 

"Dang it…" 

Serena set her phone down, cursing Daniel in her heart. 

Just then, Dai walked in with a girl. 

Serena looked up to see that it was Qin Lili, dressed in a professional suit. 

Her eyes brightened, and all her earlier displeasure faded away. 

Qin Lili, standing behind Dai, respectfully greeted Serena with a "President Zhou." 

Serena stood up and approached Qin Lili, warmly smiling and asking about her wellbeing before directing Dai to take her to the marketing department. 

She specifically instructed, "Dai, have Manager Mu personally guide Miss Qin!" 

Dai agreed. 

Qin Lili beamed at Serena, saying "thank you" twice. 

As she turned to follow Dai out, she shot Serena a playful wink. 

Serena felt flattered by the attention from such a beauty. 

Hmph. 

Did Leo think that by breaking up with her, she would be left alone? 

If it weren't for her prior commitments, she could have taken Qin Lili out on a date tonight…

But thinking of Leo made Serena feel a bit down. 

She hesitated about whether to inform Leo about the engagement delay with Daniel. 

However, another wave of responsibilities hit her, and since Leo was not in Qianshui, she couldn’t just reach out to him for comfort when she felt pressured. 

Serena lacked enthusiasm for a long-distance relationship that only allowed for phone calls to ease her longing. 

After wrestling with her phone for a while, she decided against it. 

"President Zhou..." 

After leading Qin Lili to the marketing department, Dai quickly returned. 

She cautiously observed Serena's expression and prudently asked, "...Do you have any special instructions regarding Miss Qin?" 

Serena gave Dai a meaningful glance and replied coolly, "Nothing special. Just let her intern well in the marketing department!" 

Dai frowned, hesitating as she continued, "But about the apartment she requested…" 

Apartment? 

Serena raised an eyebrow, suddenly remembering that this was one of the conditions Qin Lili had set for getting close to her… 

Qin Lili wanted an apartment as a love nest for them to build their relationship. 

Serena squinted her eyes, coldly saying, "Not urgent. I just got dumped; I need some time to cool off!"
