This Is an Internal Disaster

As Leo Sterling and Adam Song exchanged puzzled glances over Grandpa Zhou's words, Serena Zhou quickly interjected, “Grandpa, you’ve had too much to drink. This isn’t my boyfriend—he’s not the one beside me. It’s actually him! You should rest, I’ll take him to see my parents!”

With that, she closed the car door and led Leo to her parents’ graves. Adam had initially hesitated about joining them, but with Grandpa Zhou’s insistence, he decided to follow along.

At the gravesite, Leo laid flowers and introduced himself to the tombstones of Serena’s parents, promising to take good care of her. Adam also offered flowers, but instead of saying anything sentimental like Leo did, he simply stood quietly to the side. He couldn’t help but notice that the photographs of Serena’s parents on the tombstones showed them as remarkably youthful.

For some reason, Adam felt a strange sense of familiarity when he looked at her father’s face—it was almost like he was looking into a mirror. He instinctively touched his cheek, and when he glanced up, he caught Serena’s gaze. She looked at him with a complicated expression, but as soon as their eyes met, she quickly averted her gaze.

Confused and somewhat anxious, Adam wondered if Serena had noticed their resemblance or if she was simply avoiding his eyes for another reason. It seemed he needed to find a chance to reveal his sexual orientation. Although he didn’t consider himself as charming as Leo, he had attracted his fair share of female admirers over the years.

When the trio returned to the car, they found Grandpa Zhou had already dozed off. Serena arranged for someone to take him home while she took Leo and Adam to a riverside barbecue.

Serena was more familiar with the area than she was with the shallow sea. The atmosphere during the meal was pleasant. No longer in the confines of the Sterling family, Leo was animated, and Adam didn’t feel the need to play the role of a mood lifter either. They chatted casually about various topics, letting their conversations flow freely.

Following Leo’s lead, Serena addressed Adam as “brother.” “Brother, with your great qualities, why haven’t you found a girlfriend yet?”

At the mention of this topic, Adam downed his drink in frustration, letting out a sigh. “Let’s be honest, I’m never going to have a girlfriend…”

“Why not?” Serena asked, intrigued.

Adam replied bluntly, “Because I like men…”

Serena’s reaction was rather muted; she simply responded with a soft, “Oh.”

“What’s with that reaction? Did you already know about my orientation?” Adam pointed at Leo. “Did this guy spill the beans?”

Leo remained silent, not offering any defense.

Serena shook her head. “I had no idea, but it’s nothing to be surprised about, right? My brother is also gay, and I once confessed to a girl…”

Leo’s eyes darted toward her.

Serena quickly added, “But that was just a misunderstanding!”

“Your brother…” Adam recalled a previous encounter with Xia Xiuhe at the shallow sea. Although Xia had only introduced Serena’s brother as a friend, their interactions had been too intimate and ambiguous for Adam to disregard.

“…He and Xia Xiuhe…” Adam muttered.

Serena explained, “They broke up over a year ago. Xia tricked my brother into losing a lot of money and even tampered with his car before escaping, leaving my brother bedridden…”

As she mentioned Xia, a surge of emotions welled up in Serena. She raised her drink and downed it in one go.

Adam’s memories of Xia were still stuck in high school, where they sat next to each other. Xia had always been shy and reserved, hesitant in everything he did—his posture was hunched, and he blended into the background with average looks and grades. If not for the fact that he sat right behind Adam, he would have been easy to forget.

Yet, despite the years that had passed, Adam still remembered Xia, perhaps because of Xia’s timid yet soothing voice that would respond softly each time Adam accidentally bumped into his things. “Sorry!” Adam would say, and Xia’s gentle voice would reply, “It’s okay!”

That voice had been sweet and delicate, almost feminine, wrapping around Adam’s heart with a touch of shyness. He had never imagined that the seemingly honest and gentle Xia would be capable of such treachery and deceit, especially against someone he once shared a bond with.

Adam couldn’t help but feel a pang of regret and nostalgia.

After their late-night snack, Serena arranged for someone to take the intoxicated Leo and Adam to a hotel while she returned to her grandfather’s residence. Grandpa Zhou was evidently awake now, a bit irritable. When Serena handed him a cup of detox tea, he grumbled, “I sent word. He won’t meet me…”

Serena hadn’t expected her grandfather to still be relentless in wanting to meet Song Weiming and urge him to surrender. She frowned, her tone icy. “Grandpa, you shouldn’t get involved. I’ll handle it.”

Zhou Yunfang looked at Serena, his gaze heavy with sorrow. “What do you plan to do?”

Her eyes were sharp like ice. “If you don’t intend to help, it’s best you don’t ask.”

This was an internal disaster. Serena was solely focused on avenging her parents and seeking justice for Zhou Jingchen and Ms. Meng. There was no time to consider Grandpa Zhou’s complex and delicate emotions.

“I…” Zhou Yunfang began, looking at Serena’s cold demeanor, his lips moved as if wanting to say something but ultimately fell silent. After all, this was all his fault from the start. If he hadn’t succumbed to temptation and gotten involved with the likes of Shang Xuehai, they wouldn’t be in this mess. If he had taken action when things went south instead of letting Shang handle the troublesome matters with Song’s mother and Song Weiming, perhaps Song Weiming wouldn’t harbor such resentment toward the Zhou family, leading to all this chaos and bloodshed.

The summer vacation passed swiftly.

Leo returned to school while Serena became even busier. This was the second time Leo had taken Serena to visit his grandmother, only to find her absent again.

Leo was frustrated, but there was little he could do as Serena struggled to find two full days to spare. She had too many obligations, and Leo couldn’t even manage to spend time with her. Even when they did meet, it was just for a meal or some intimate moments—there was barely any time for meaningful conversation.

When Leo was busy, it was manageable, but once he had a moment to breathe, his thoughts would spiral. Serena was no longer the same as before; she didn’t have the time or patience to coax him when she sensed he was upset, opting instead for a cold approach.

The more she ignored him, the more anxious Leo felt. He knew he shouldn’t expect her companionship during her busiest times, but he couldn’t help but crave her presence at all times.

As Serena grew busier and more distant, Leo’s frustration and unease only deepened.

However, he didn’t lose his composure. Instead, he participated in an online beauty contest. As the campus heartthrob of Qian University, Leo hadn’t actively entered but allowed the photography club to submit a few of his photos.

Soon, he stood out among the contestants, quickly rising to the top with a landslide of votes.

The website organized a seemingly grand awards ceremony. While Leo had no intention of attending, he still sent the invitation to Serena, asking if she could accompany him.
