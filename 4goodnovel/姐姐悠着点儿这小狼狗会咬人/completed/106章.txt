"I'll make you kneel before me and beg for mercy."

Serena Zhou didn’t drive. After finishing a barbecue meal with Adam Fu, he went to fetch the car while she waited by the roadside next to the restaurant. She had just lit a cigarette, but before she could take a drag, someone snatched it from her lips, crushed it, and tossed it into a nearby trash can.

Frowning in displeasure, Serena turned her head away, only to freeze when she saw who was beside her.

"Mr. Sterling..."

Despite knowing he didn’t have a high opinion of her, Serena managed to pull a polite smile and greet him. After all, the city was small. Although Leo Sterling seemed to have it out for her company, he couldn’t just kick her out of his projects either; there were several collaborations between his firm and hers that were already well underway. As the CEO of Sterling Enterprises, he had to consider the bigger picture—personal grudges aside, business interests came first.

Serena was used to socializing, and it seemed Leo was too, as they had crossed paths frequently lately. However, they had never encountered each other alone. The last time they met was at a spring gathering, where a mutual friend had insisted they settle their differences over drinks.

"To make money, it’s important to keep things amicable. Come on, Mr. Sterling, Ms. Zhou, do me a favor and drink with me..."

Serena had always been grateful to that friend. She stood up, raised her glass, and clinked it with Leo's.

"Mr. Sterling, I apologize for any past grievances. I’ll drink to that. Cheers!" 

She downed her glass of liquor in one go, but Leo didn’t move. His dark eyes held emotions that were difficult to decipher, and he coldly replied, “I’m sorry, but I’m a petty person. I can’t overlook the offenses you’ve committed against me.”

He didn’t bother to feign politeness. He pushed his glass away, sending it crashing onto the table, spilling liquor everywhere, making it clear he wasn’t interested in playing nice. Without another word, he stood up and left.

In future encounters, even those who had vested interests in both Sterling Enterprises and her company wouldn’t attempt to mend their relationship. As someone had said, Leo's demeanor was growing more composed, and his aura was becoming increasingly formidable. The cold, piercing gaze of Leo Sterling was intimidating.

Now, Serena found herself wanting to avoid him whenever possible.

"Waiting for your boyfriend?"

"Huh?" Serena was taken aback. She hadn’t expected Leo to engage her. After a moment of surprise, she forced a smile and explained, “Mr. Fu isn’t my boyfriend…”

When Leo heard her clarification, he scrutinized her intently. “Are you worried I might retaliate against him too?”

Retaliate? Serena raised an eyebrow, surprised. “Mr. Sterling, you’re quite straightforward…”

Leo replied, “I’ve never been one for beating around the bush or putting on airs…”

Feigning ignorance at his jibe, Serena lowered her head and leaned in slightly. “True, but not everyone has the capital to be as direct as you, Mr. Sterling.”

He scoffed, “Stubborn!”

After a brief pause, he suddenly asked, “Are you leaving your company?”

Serena nodded. “Yes.”

“You’ve fought so hard to keep your company… are you really willing to give it up?”

Frowning, Serena felt a painful tightness in her chest. “What’s there to hold onto?”

“True.” Leo’s tone was chilling. “If you can so easily discard the boyfriend you fought hard to win, who’s to say you won’t do the same with your company?”

“But if you think that once you leave your company, I’ll stop targeting it, you’ve underestimated me.”

Leaning slightly forward, Leo’s gaze bore into Serena's, icy and intense. “I won’t let you off the hook. Whether you cling to someone named Fu or someone else, no matter what means you employ… Serena Zhou, one day, I’ll make you kneel before me and beg for mercy!”

With that, before Serena could react, he turned and entered the restaurant.

Serena stood there, watching his retreating figure, narrowing her eyes slightly. 

Kneeling before him and begging for mercy… how simple a request. If he hadn’t turned away so quickly, she could have easily done it right there. As long as he could let go of the past and forgive himself, she would have been more than willing to kneel.

But alas, he left too fast.

Serena couldn’t help but smile bitterly at his back. Once she confirmed he was out of sight, she cautiously reached out where he had just stood, as if trying to grasp the air around him, longing to capture the essence he left behind. It was a futile gesture, but she missed the boyfriend she had once gone to great lengths to pursue.

How ridiculous, Serena Zhou. It had all been a meticulously orchestrated charade, and yet here she was, acting as if she had deep feelings.

Doesn’t she realize how insane she sounds?

Oh, right. If she didn’t leave this city soon, with him lingering around, she might genuinely lose her mind.

Looking up at the overcast sky, she thought it was indeed time to go. Although her brother, who had been in a coma for over two years, was finally returning to the company. Serena had managed the business well during his absence, and now, with the merchants no longer a hindrance, as long as he didn’t act foolishly and fall for someone like Xia Xiuhe again, the company wouldn’t collapse even under pressure from Sterling Enterprises.

As for external threats, like the Duan family… even if Tang Ying was released from prison, she likely wouldn’t dare to make any moves against her brother.

Then there was that old woman from the Duan family… but never mind. She was a lone wolf, easily monitored.

Now that Leo had taken over Sterling Enterprises, she wouldn’t be able to connect with the Sterling family anymore, nor would she try. After all, the “suicide” of Duan Kangyu was still fresh in everyone’s minds. The old lady must know how suspiciously sudden her son’s death was, but she wouldn’t dare investigate further. She was old, and the act of “suicide” would be much easier for her.

Just thinking about all this made Serena’s head hurt. So, once her brother returned and she had assisted him for about two weeks, she resolutely transferred all her shares in the company to him and resigned before leaving the city.

Before she departed, Adam Fu invited her to dinner once more. Serena found his approach—sending flowers, gifts, and inviting her out to eat—somewhat frustrating. It was all so conventional. Compared to how she had pursued Leo… ugh, better to think about Adam instead.

Adam Fu. Yes, Adam Fu. 

Oh, right, Adam was too much of a gentleman, too polite. Even when she agreed to go hiking and stargazing with him over the weekend, he would first ask, “This path is steep; may I hold your hand?”

…May I hold your hand? 

Well, how about no!

Serena shook her head when he offered his hand. “No thanks!”

Then she grabbed onto a nearby rock to ascend the steep steps. Speaking of that rock… it was smooth, just like the one she had rolled around on with Leo on Qishan Mountain. Ugh…

Forget it. 

She should just give up! Her mind was so full of thoughts about Leo that there was no room for Adam, or any other man, to occupy even a small part of it.
