**Chapter Title: Complicated Connections**

Serena Zhou wasn’t worthy of him. In the shallow waters, there were only a few families like the Zhou family who had interests intertwined with the business world. Although Serena never discussed the matters of the business world or her family with Leo Sterling, he still knew about her tactics—how she used Qin Lili to dismantle the Shang family, reclaimed shares from Yanjia, and exposed the skeletons in Yanjun’s closet. So when the Zhou family faced trouble, it was highly probable that it was connected to the Shang or Yan families.

Leo’s emotions regarding Serena’s life and her way of handling problems were complex. He recognized that underneath her driven exterior, Serena had a warm and compassionate heart. He wanted to cherish the pure and beautiful bond they shared forever. However, he feared that this desire might hinder his pursuit of his dreams.

Since childhood, Leo had aspired to be like his grandfather—he wanted to use his research to ensure that everyone in this world had enough to eat, to eradicate famine once and for all. But if he took on all of Serena’s burdens, he wouldn’t be able to spend his days in the laboratory… He couldn’t abandon his dreams, nor could he let go of Serena.

Perhaps it was time to deal with Duan Kangyu…

Serena’s brother, Zhou Jingchen, and Ms. Meng had spent a week in the hospital. Ms. Meng was discharged without serious issues, but Zhou Jingchen was advised by Feng Lan to stay for further observation. Despite the old house being burned down, Zhou Yunfang had become accustomed to living in Wangshan, prompting Serena to buy another apartment next door to their old home.

Thanks to the firefighters’ timely response, although the old Zhou residence was in ruins, many valuables were salvaged. During that chaotic time, Serena was so busy she could hardly catch her breath. Leo felt almost completely sidelined. 

He understood that Serena was not only investigating the truth behind the fire but also preparing for a counterattack against the Shang and Yan families, alongside managing other personal matters. He empathized with her struggles, but it didn’t mean she could completely cut him off. He prepared meals and brought them to the Shang business office, trying to reach Serena, but her phone either went unanswered or was picked up by her assistant, Dai Jie.

Leo felt a pang in his heart. He knew Serena was swamped and believed that he couldn’t help her in her eyes. Still, he longed for things to be like before—he would wait for her, no matter how late, ready to be her chauffeur. If she didn’t want to come to his apartment, he would at least drive her home. But Serena hadn’t even given him that chance again.

He texted her, asking if she was working overtime at the office or out for social engagements, telling her he’d made soup and was waiting for her. Serena never replied. He called Dai Jie and Lin Cheng, and their responses were eerily in sync: “Ms. Zhou is busy. She should reach out to you in a few days.”

A few days…

Leo waited and waited. Even after his contacts uncovered the truth behind that night’s fire, Serena still hadn’t contacted him. 

“...The doctor who was supposed to go to the Zhou residence was found collapsed in a patch of grass in Wangshan the next morning. Someone took his badge and impersonated him to enter Wangye…” Lu Xun placed a stack of documents in front of Leo.

He pointed to a bespectacled man in a photo and said, “...This man. He was caught on the gate’s surveillance when he entered Wangye. Our people took some time to find him since he was disguised…”

“Have we confirmed his identity?” Leo asked, narrowing his eyes.

Lu Xun nodded. “He was an employee at the power supply company, laid off six months ago. He was later diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer… His social connections are simple, and he has no personal grudges or dealings with the Zhou family. He was instructed to commit arson…”

Lu Xun pulled out a bank statement from the stack. “...Three months ago, his bank account received several million in installments. A month ago, he divorced his wife, leaving all the money to her and their daughter…”

Leo asked, “Did we trace the person who transferred the money?”

Lu Xun shook his head. “The money was wired from overseas, and we can’t confirm the sender’s information yet. However, I checked the Shang and Yan families—there’s no record of them having an account at that bank…”

Leo’s eyes narrowed further. So the mastermind was likely not from the Shang or Yan families. Who could it be?

“What about Duan Kangyu?” he inquired.

Lu Xun hesitated, his expression changing slightly. “It shouldn’t be someone from the Duan family, after all…”

“What do you mean?”

Lu Xun’s face paled. He shook his head. “Nothing. I’ll double-check the Duan family’s account information…”

Leo pointed to the criminal in the photograph. “Where is this person now? Has he been arrested?”

Lu Xun replied in a low voice, “He’s dead. The police found him before our people did. By the time they found him, he had drowned in the river. It’s hard to determine if it was suicide or if someone silenced him…”

Leo stared at the documents for a moment in silence before issuing a command, “Continue the investigation. We must uncover the mastermind behind this.”

Lu Xun acknowledged, gathering the documents. “By the way, Leo, your aunt is coming to Shallow Sea this weekend. She likely knows about your relationship with Serena…”

Leo remained calm, responding with a simple “Mm.” He had already received a call from his aunt regarding this matter. 

He wasn’t surprised that his aunt was aware of his relationship with Serena. Since childhood, she had cared for him more than his own parents. Leo often shared things with her that he wouldn’t tell his parents, and he planned to ask for her help regarding Duan Kangyu.

On the weekend, Leo arrived early at the restaurant to meet his aunt, Sheng He. After a warm embrace and some small talk, she inquired about his love life. Leo told her the truth, hoping she could assist him in dealing with Duan Kangyu.

However, Sheng He frowned, earnestly advising him to break up with Serena. “She’s not worthy of you. She’s older and more cunning than you, Toh. I’ve conducted a detailed investigation into her—this girl is not simple. I even suspect she approached you because she knows your background…”

Leo had entertained such doubts before. Yet, during the six months they had been together, Serena had never mentioned her struggles, nor had she hinted at any ulterior motives. She only shared moments of romance and beauty.

While Serena might have known he came from a decent background—enough to afford a penthouse and give her expensive gifts—he found it hard to believe she approached him with an agenda.

“Aunt, you’re misunderstanding her. She couldn’t possibly know my identity or approach me intentionally…”

“Why are you so certain?” Sheng He pressed.

Leo replied, “If she had ulterior motives, she would have asked for something in return. But she’s never made any demands of me…”

...Except for love and desire, of course.

Sheng He expressed her concerns. “She may not ask, but you’ve been actively helping her, haven’t you? The Shang family is struggling financially, and you had Lu Yan invest. She wants to break free from Duan Kangyu, and you come to me for help? Toh, that’s clever on her part. It’s much more sophisticated than someone who directly asks for help…”
