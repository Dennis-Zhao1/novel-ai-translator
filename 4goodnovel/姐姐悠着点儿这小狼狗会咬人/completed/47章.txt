### Blessing of the Qi People

Though she felt a hint of dissatisfaction, Zhou Jing Shu turned the car around and headed toward the Spring Color Club.

"Don't worry, Leo," she softly reassured Sheng Tang, thinking he was concerned for her safety. "Duang Kang Yu just wants to watch the show for now. He probably won't plan any unexpected surprises for me..."

On one hand, Sheng Tang was indeed worried about Zhou Jing Shu's safety. After all, Duang Kang Yu was a man of complex connections in shallow waters, and the more Sheng Tang investigated, the more he found that the man was cunning and ruthless, with ties even to his own family. 

On the other hand, he felt uneasy about Duang Kang Yu’s excessive attentiveness. 

Furrowing his brow, Sheng Tang thought for a moment before asking, "Can I be your bodyguard and go in with you?"

Zhou Jing Shu looked at him in surprise, a bit taken aback. "You can, but even if you go in, you'll only be able to wait at the door... and it’s a chaotic place inside..."

Sheng Tang turned to look at Zhou Jing Shu, his gaze filled with warmth. "That's okay. I just want to be as close to you as possible!"

Zhou Jing Shu felt a rush of sweetness at his words, her heart tinged with a bittersweet sensation. For a moment, she didn't know how to respond.

They quickly arrived at Spring Color. The night had just fallen, and the club was still relatively empty. Zhou Jing Shu guided Sheng Tang through the dimly lit corridors, taking several turns before finally stopping outside a large private room.

"I'm going in now..." Zhou Jing Shu cautioned Sheng Tang. "I don’t know how long it will take. If you get bored waiting, you can head back first. I’ve messaged Lin Cheng, and he’ll be here soon."

As soon as Sheng Tang heard the word “drink,” his expression soured. 

"I got it. You can go in now!" 

Zhou Jing Shu completely understood Sheng Tang’s worries and frustrations. But she could never let her personal life interfere with her work. That was her principle.

She kissed Sheng Tang gently and then, putting on a different expression, pushed open the door to the private room.

Sheng Tang's gaze followed Zhou Jing Shu's figure as she stepped inside. He immediately spotted Duang Kang Yu.

Upon seeing Zhou Jing Shu, Duang Kang Yu stood up, a bright smile on his face, and extended his hand toward her before she even got close.

Sheng Tang felt his jaw tighten as he watched Duang Kang Yu’s hand settle on Zhou Jing Shu’s waist. The change in Duang Kang Yu's demeanor toward her was too drastic and subtle. 

In the first three months of their acquaintance, Duang Kang Yu had seldom taken the initiative to invite Zhou Jing Shu out. Most of the time, it was Zhou Jing Shu who would go to the Duang household, using her visits to Duang Mu as an excuse to see him. Their moments alone were rarely interrupted by Duang Kang Yu.

But now, Duang Kang Yu not only sent flowers to Zhou Jing Shu daily but also frequently invited her out after work. 

Although Sheng Tang and Zhou Jing Shu had playfully broken up and made up again and he hadn’t explicitly stated his feelings for her again, he still considered himself her legitimate boyfriend.

Duang Kang Yu’s warm demeanor towards Zhou Jing Shu contrasted starkly with his previous intimidating presence, and it only served to irritate Sheng Tang further… yet he couldn’t express his anger.

Not long after, Lin Cheng arrived, but Sheng Tang didn't leave. He peered through the glass of the door and caught sight of Zhou Jing Shu lifting a glass to her lips. 

He couldn’t remember how many times he had seen her raise her glass, smiling and toasting to others. Each time he saw her drink, a wave of impulse surged within him to rush in and overturn the table.

That night, Zhou Jing Shu drank until two in the morning. 

When the gathering finally dispersed, Duang Kang Yu noticed Zhou Jing Shu’s dazed expression and how she could barely walk straight. Just as he was about to reach out to support her, Sheng Tang burst through the private room door and strode in.

In a swift motion, he scooped Zhou Jing Shu into his arms.

In the flickering lights, Sheng Tang’s face was as cold as ink. 

Zhou Jing Shu, in her drunken haze, was oblivious to Sheng Tang's dark expression and the pent-up frustration radiating from him. All she could think was how attractive he looked, prompting her to tease him playfully. 

“Leo, I really like you! I want to kiss you. Do you want to…?” Zhou Jing Shu slurred, her arms dangling around Sheng Tang's neck as she tried to lift herself up, her lips inching closer to his. “... Do you want to kiss me? The nearby private room... is empty…”

Sheng Tang paused at her words. 

Duang Kang Yu was not far behind them. 

Zhou Jing Shu was fanning the flames...

Sheng Tang couldn’t tell if she was doing it intentionally or if her drunkenness was getting the better of her.

He lowered his head, gazing deeply into her eyes, and said in a serious tone, “This is what you wanted. Don’t blame me when you sober up!”

Zhou Jing Shu seemed to barely grasp the meaning behind his words, her cheeks flushed with a hint of a mysterious smile.

As soon as she saw Sheng Tang leaning down, she straightened up and pressed her lips against his.

Sheng Tang’s eyes widened in shock, his body stiffening. 

Just as Duang Kang Yu moved closer, Sheng Tang kicked open a side door of the private room and carried Zhou Jing Shu inside.

After locking the door, he pressed her against the couch and kissed her fiercely.

Sheng Tang's abrupt movement startled Duang Kang Yu, causing him to stop in his tracks.

Duang Kang Yu stared at the slowly closing door, his gaze suddenly sharpening and deepening.

His assistant, trailing behind, cautiously asked, “Sir, should I…?”

“No need.” 

Duang Kang Yu tucked his slightly numb hand into his pocket and walked away from the Spring Color Club without looking back.

Inside the dim private room, desire simmered and boiled over.

Zhou Jing Shu, caught up in the moment, began to fumble with Sheng Tang’s clothes.

But Sheng Tang held back, unable to go any further. 

He couldn’t help but think about how many people had sat on that sofa in this room. There must have been traces of ash and spilled drinks…

The environment was too filthy for him to continue seeking thrill in such discomfort.

He ended the kiss abruptly, soothing Zhou Jing Shu for a moment before carrying her out of the private room, leaving the Spring Color behind.

Zhou Jing Shu, feeling drowsy and weak, behaved obediently and fell asleep in the car. Once they arrived at Sheng Tang's apartment, she drank some of the soup he had made and seemed to shake off her drunkenness.

Rejuvenated, she pulled Sheng Tang into the bathroom with her.

Sheng Tang couldn’t shake the feeling that Zhou Jing Shu was using their intimacy to vent her emotions and relieve stress.

He couldn’t quite define how he felt about it. Was Zhou Jing Shu seeking him out just for that?

Sheng Tang gazed at her, realizing he was becoming increasingly sentimental. 

But since Zhou Jing Shu was going through such a tough time, he didn’t want to burden her with his feelings. He focused on taking care of her more attentively in their daily lives.

Zhou Jing Shu never complained about her work troubles in front of him; she was only eager to indulge in pleasure with him. 

So, he chose to indulge in love without asking too many questions!

Before long, the Qixi Festival arrived. 

This was the first Valentine’s Day since Sheng Tang and Zhou Jing Shu got together. 

During the day, Zhou Jing Shu was naturally very busy. But in the evening, she decided to push aside her social engagements and plan a special date with Sheng Tang. 

Unexpectedly, Duang Kang Yu called to say he wanted to have dinner with Zhou Jing Shu that night. 

Zhou Jing Shu couldn’t refuse him, but she also didn’t want to neglect Sheng Tang. 

After much thought, she decided to have dinner with Duang Kang Yu first and then enjoy the night with her little wolf cub afterward.

Sheng Tang was not pleased about this at all. 

Zhou Jing Shu tried to soothe him with kisses and hugs, but Sheng Tang still wore a cold expression. 

Seeing that her usual tactics weren’t working, Zhou Jing Shu resorted to her ace: she nibbled on Sheng Tang’s ear, promising to try something new with him tonight.

To her surprise, her usual charm fell flat this time. Sheng Tang was not only unmoved but also retorted icily, “Zhou Jing Shu, how long do you plan to enjoy this blessing of the Qi people?”
