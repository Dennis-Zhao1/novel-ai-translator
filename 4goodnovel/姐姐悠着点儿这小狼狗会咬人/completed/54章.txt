Chapter One: The Arrival of Sister Fox

Standing by the door, gripping the doorknob, Serena Zhou was momentarily lost in thought. It took her a moment to process what was happening.

As she took in the vibrant scene before her, a bright smile broke across her face, and she shut the door with a soft click.

In the next instant, she transformed into a seductive vixen, playfully leaping onto the bed where Leo Sterling lay amidst a sea of roses. 

“Little Leo, Sister Fox has arrived…”

Serena dove into the fluffy bed of rose petals, her eyes sparkling as she gazed at the small mound of flowers atop Leo's body, her lips curling in anticipation as she licked them.

“...Has Sister’s gift been prepared? Let’s see what’s inside!”

With a playful flick of her tongue, Serena began to blow the rose petals off Leo’s body, revealing a heart-shaped gift box tied with a red ribbon nestled beneath.

But to her surprise, the little box didn’t spring open to reveal a cheerful greeting from Leo. Instead, it lay there, topped with a beautifully wrapped present.

Serena paused for a moment, glancing at Leo, who was propping himself on his elbows. His brows were slightly knitted, lips pressed tight, and his expression was a mix of pain and pleasure. She reached out and picked up the gift box, discovering that he had prepared something special beyond the fireflies dancing in the room and the bed of roses.

Her heart warmed as she shook the box, grinning at Leo. “What’s this?”

“It’s a gift. Open it and see if you like it,” he replied.

Serena obediently opened the box and gasped in delight when she saw a stunning set of platinum jewelry inside. There was a necklace, earrings, and a bracelet, each piece adorned with floral designs and shimmering gemstones.

The necklace featured a larger floral pendant studded with delicate blue and purple gems, while the earrings showcased two deep green jade stones. The bracelet had intertwining floral charms embellished with tiny pink diamonds that sparkled beautifully in the dim light.

As she lifted the floral pendant from the necklace, she noticed a raised engraving on the back. Turning it over, she discovered her initials engraved in elegant script.

Serena’s playful demeanor shifted, her eyes glistening as her heart swelled. This was not just a gift; it was a carefully crafted token of affection!

Seeing the change in Serena’s expression, Leo sat up, concern etched across his face. “What’s wrong, Sister? Do you not like it? This set is one of a kind, made just for you.”

“No, no! I love it! I’m just... really touched. This is so perfect for me! Thank you, Little Leo!” Serena exclaimed, her gratitude spilling over as she leaned in to plant a kiss on his cheek.

Holding out the necklace, she playfully commanded, “Put it on me!”

With a mischievous glint in her eye, she added softly, “Tonight, I want to be all decked out for… you know.”

Leo was enchanted by her teasing gaze, his heart racing. He cradled the back of her head and captured her lips in a passionate kiss before gently removing the necklace he had gifted her previously and placing it on the bedside table. Then, he adorned her with the new necklace, followed by the earrings and bracelet.

Serena twinkled with joy as she admired the dazzling diamonds on her wrist, feeling like a carefree firefly dancing in the room filled with warmth and light.

“Little Leo…” she teased, eyeing his bare form. “Sister wants to lie here, naked, among the roses. Come on, help me out of these clothes so I can give you your Qixi gift!”

Serena was always the one to initiate these flirtatious moments, while Leo had learned to take charge when she was nearing exhaustion.

Content and cheerful, Serena finally lay back into the sea of roses only to find that the sensation wasn’t quite what she had imagined. The cool petals scattered over her body, sending shivers down her spine.

“Little Leo, I’m so cold…” she murmured, unable to suppress a shudder.

Leo, ever attentive, leaned down with a soft chuckle. “Then let me warm you up…”

And soon enough, within the flickering glow of fireflies and the fragrant bed of roses, waves of heated passion rolled between them.

They pursued their desires with unrelenting fervor, always rising to meet each other’s energy and delight.

That night was no exception. They lost themselves in each other until the clock struck midnight, marking the end of the Qixi Festival, their vibrant bed of roses now wilted and scattered.

Typically, after such an encounter, Serena would be left exhausted, leaving all the cleanup to Leo. But tonight, she felt energized and, after they finished, they tidied up together while chatting.

Of course, Serena’s contribution to the cleaning was limited to opening the windows to let the fireflies out, while she lounged on the side, munching on fruit and watching her handsome partner work.

“Little Leo, where did all these fireflies come from?” she asked, her curiosity piqued.

Leo, busy clearing the rose petals, replied, “I caught them with my uncle and aunt by the creek on Flag Mountain.”

“How long did it take?”

“Over two hours.”

“Did your uncle and aunt know you were catching fireflies for me?”

“Nope, I told them it was for my thesis.”

Leo’s tone was serious and calm, but Serena couldn’t help but laugh. “Little Leo, I didn’t know you could lie so convincingly!”

She plucked a rose petal from the bed. “And these rose petals? You didn’t pick them from your garden on Flag Mountain, did you?”

“The roses weren’t picked. I bought them,” he clarified, turning to look at her.

Serena raised an eyebrow. “Can I ask how much you spent on this sea of rose petals?”

Leo finished tidying the bed and turned to face her, a playful glint in his eye. “Why do you want to know? Planning to do something romantic for someone else?”

Since learning that Serena had once confessed her feelings to Fu Nanyin, Leo had become inexplicably jealous about even the smallest things.

Serena found his jealousy adorably endearing. She picked up a slice of watermelon and held it up to his mouth, her voice soft and sincere. “If I ever do something romantic again, it’ll be with you. I don’t want to look at anyone else!”

Her sweet words brought a smile to Leo’s face.

“All right, we’re almost done here. You must be hungry. Why don’t you wait outside for a bit? I’ll go make dinner…” 

They wrapped up the cleaning and headed to the kitchen. As Serena surveyed the prepped rice and chopped vegetables, she teased Leo, “So you were cooking and then decided to take a break?”

Leo pouted slightly at the memory. “It’s all your fault! I thought you’d be gone for at least two or three hours visiting Duan Kangyu. I had no idea you’d be back so soon, especially looking so stunning and striking that pose at the door…”

…And leaning against a figurine he had coveted for ages!

When Leo caught a glimpse of Serena through the peephole, he felt an overwhelming urge to fling open the door, pull her inside, and pin her against it. But remembering the surprise he had waiting inside, he had to restrain himself, savoring the anticipation of their evening together.
