Serena Zhou was undeniably meant for Leo Sterling.

Though Leo often found himself in petty squabbles with Serena, especially as her wedding date with Duke Duan approached, he wore a cool demeanor outwardly. Inside, however, he was a tempest of anxiety and yearning. Despite this, his attentiveness to Serena had only grown more meticulous, as if he were trying to make every moment count before she slipped away forever.

In other ways, Leo showered Serena with an array of affection and care, pulling out all the stops to make her feel cherished. Serena frequently mused about the joys of youth — how delightful it was to revel in the tenderness and vitality of a young man like Leo. Life was meant to be vibrant and exhilarating, not just a dull existence of mere survival.

Due to Serena's deception, claiming her relationship with Leo was nothing serious, their encounters had become infrequent during this period. Whenever they did meet, they invariably ended up tangled together in bed. Sometimes, Serena would have time to sip on soup or nibble on a bite to eat. Other times, she would hurriedly get dressed and leave immediately after their passionate moments. Leo couldn't help but feel a twinge of disappointment, wondering if she merely viewed him as an outlet for her frustrations.

Whenever Serena texted him that she would come over that night, Leo would eagerly clean himself up, rush to buy groceries, and prepare a meal, waiting for her arrival. Yet, she rarely arrived on time, often showing up late or even canceling at the last minute. Each time he waited for her at home, he felt like a forgotten concubine in an ancient palace, longing for a moment of warmth from his emperor, who would soon depart, leaving him behind.

To keep her with him a little longer, he sometimes resorted to playful tactics, trying to exhaust her so completely that she would have no choice but to remain. But as time passed, Serena's stamina only seemed to grow, and she would always muster the willpower to rise again, even if she walked awkwardly afterward. Seeing her struggle to move, Leo couldn't help but ask softly, "Are you really leaving so late tonight, sister?"

Serena yearned to lie languidly in Leo's embrace like she used to, but with her wedding to Duke Duan looming, she had received the confirmation that Tang Ying had booked her flight back to Qianshui. She couldn’t afford to let her guard down now, so she had to coax and cuddle her little wolf cub, persuading him to drive her back home.

As Leo parked the car at their usual fork in the road, they held hands, reluctant to part. Watching their fingers entwined, Leo felt a wave of melancholy wash over him. "You're getting married to Duke Duan in two days. It feels... strange for us to be like this."

Leo was sensitive and deeply moral, while Serena's attitude was carefree, even playfully teasing him with a wicked smile. "Are you suggesting that this feels like an affair?"

Leo hesitated to admit it, yet their clandestine relationship certainly lacked transparency. Following her train of thought, Serena tilted her head and mused, "If you see it that way...," and before he could respond, she cupped his face and planted a teasing kiss on his lips, whispering softly, "...doesn't that mean I'm putting on a flashy hat in front of Duke Duan? Oh wow, that sounds thrilling! How about tomorrow night, I come over for some role play?"

Serena's tone was serious, as if she were fixated on the idea. Whenever something troubled her, she loved to indulge in daring games with Leo. The bolder she became, the more Leo sensed her underlying anxiety. He wrapped his arms tightly around her, his voice gentle. "Okay, sister. Whatever you want to do, I'll be there for you."

In truth, Leo wanted to reassure Serena that she had nothing to worry about. He would never let her become Duke Duan's wife. Serena was meant to be his, and his alone!

Engrossed in her own vivid fantasies, Serena didn’t perceive Leo’s complex thoughts. With a bright smile, she said, "Then I'll come see you early tomorrow night..." and punctuated her statement with a gentle bite on his earlobe. To Serena, Leo was like a delectable treat, and she loved to leave her little bite marks scattered across his skin. Leo had grown accustomed to it; each time he saw those marks, a sweet, indulgent smile crept onto his face.

The only inconvenience was that, to avoid attracting unwanted attention, Leo had to wear long sleeves and pants even in the sweltering summer heat. Though they'd only been together for half a year, Leo knew that Serena had changed him profoundly — yes, she had nudged him toward becoming a better version of himself! But perhaps it wasn’t Serena who changed him; it was his own desire to improve, to be worthy of a long-lasting relationship with her.

So, despite his deep resentment and frustration about Serena’s impending wedding to Duke Duan, Leo chose to remain quiet, trusting her completely. Naturally, he had faith in himself, too, believing he could protect everything he cherished without ruining Serena's future.

On New Year's Day, Leo found himself outside the hotel where Serena was to wed Duke Duan. He didn’t enter but instead sat on a bench on the hotel lawn, lost in thought as he gazed at her dressing room. He wondered if his sister had already donned a pure white wedding gown. Would she still be wearing the jewelry he had gifted her? He imagined how beautiful she must look in that gown, wishing that beauty belonged solely to him.

Leo was engulfed in his fantasies, his blood ablaze with a fierce intensity. In just two hours, Serena would be his — undeniably and openly! This anticipation slammed against his heart, making his breaths heavy and his thoughts whirlpool with desire. Serena… was destined to be his cherished sister, and he would possess her completely.

Meanwhile, high above, Serena’s thoughts were worlds apart from Leo's. She glanced at her watch — two hours remained until the ceremony began. Tang Ying's flight should have landed by now... Just then, she received a text from Lin Cheng: Tang Ying had been arrested at the airport.

Before she could process this news, the door to the dressing room burst open, and Duke Duan stormed in, his dark expression radiating anger as he shouted at the busy staff, "Get out, all of you!"
