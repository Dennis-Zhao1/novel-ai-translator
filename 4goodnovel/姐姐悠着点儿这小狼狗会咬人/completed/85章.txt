### Too Much Bullying

Serena Zhou was quite taken aback. “Mr. Sterling, how can you say that? I truly care for little Leo…”

“Stop pretending. I’ve done my homework on you. You started a magazine disguised as a private detective agency at Hengxue, and you hold many secrets about people. Since Leo was raised by his grandmother, not many know he’s a Sterling heir, but I’m sure you do…”

“A girl as cunning as you wouldn’t be welcomed into the Sterling family. Besides, your background is far from glorious, and your relationships are muddled… Your preferences are unclear, and it’s obvious you have entanglements with both men and women…”

Leo Sterling went on to list several of Serena's shortcomings, and as she sat there, her expression grew more defeated under his scrutiny.

Leo felt he had made his point and finally got to the crux of the matter. “Miss Zhou, I know you’re in a tough spot right now. I can help you deal with Duan Kangyu, stabilize your position in the business world, and even help you rise to greater heights…”

“…I can assist you with most of your troubles, but in return, I hope Miss Zhou can help me resolve some of my issues!”

His words were both a handout and a slap in the face. 

Serena’s reaction met Leo's expectations perfectly. She was flustered and helpless, attempting to explain and plead for mercy while battling humiliation and frustration.

“Mr. Sterling… what do you want me to do?” 

Leo replied, “First, you can’t keep the child in your womb. Second, you need to break up with Leo Sterling. Time is of the essence, and the reason for your breakup must be solely attributed to you…”

Serena bit her lip, silent.

Leo continued, “I believe you’re a smart woman. Leo is returning to Qianhai soon, and you’ll need to make a decision quickly…”

Her gaze was dim, and she murmured, “What if I refuse?”

Leo scoffed dismissively, his expression filled with contempt. “You don’t have that option. If you want to gamble everything, go ahead and try, but know that this is a narrow bridge, and once you step onto it, there’s no turning back…”

Serena narrowed her eyes slightly, her tone steady. “Leo loves me. I don’t believe he would betray me…”

“Of course, he wouldn’t betray you. But in the end, all you’ll have left is him. Your business, your family, everything else you care about will slip away. You’ve met my brother and sister-in-law; you should know that Leo has little presence in the Sterling family. He has no desire for power or wealth. If you marry him recklessly, all you’ll gain is the title of ‘Mrs. Sterling’…”

“And Leo… believe me, he won’t go against the Sterling family for you. He doesn’t have that kind of leverage. Instead of trusting him, it would be wiser to trust me. I’m sure you’re not just a naive romantic who disregards benefits!”

A compliment and a slap in the face—Serena couldn’t help but smile at the irony. 

Leo was surprisingly adept at this kind of relationship sabotage, handling it with a well-practiced finesse.

“You have until the end of this meal to think it over. If you’ve come to a decision, I’ll accompany you to the hospital. If not…”

He let the threat hang in the air, the silence more intimidating than any words.

Serena quietly watched Leo elegantly use his chopsticks, lost in thought. After a long pause, she finally spoke, her voice trembling, “I can break up with Leo, but I want to keep this child…”

“Impossible!” Leo rejected her outright, slamming his chopsticks down on the table with a sharp click. His gaze turned fierce as he glared at her. “Miss Zhou, do not entertain delusions about this child. On this matter, there are no conditions for negotiation…”

“What if I insist…” 

Leo was enraged, his words spilling out recklessly. “If you insist on standing on the edge of a cliff, someone will eventually reach out…”

Serena gasped, “Do you all see life as so inexpensive?”

Leo retorted coldly, “Serena, you know your situation well. You’re already on the edge of that cliff, and I’m the only one willing to pull you back. You’ve offended many in the Qianhai city government. Do you really think you can use those few secrets to make them play nice? You’re too naive…”

“Anyway, I’m saying all this out of goodwill. If you want to go against the Sterling family…”

Serena shot back fiercely, “If I’m determined to be with Leo and keep this child, what do you intend to do, Mr. Sterling? Have someone kill me or the child?”

Her voice dropped, chilling the air in the private room.

Leo said, “I believe you won’t force us to that point…”

Serena chuckled coldly, “Who’s really forcing whom here? Mr. Sterling, don’t push me too far!”

With that, Serena stood up, grabbed her bag, and left the restaurant without a backward glance.

Leo, however, remained seated.

A moment later, his assistant knocked and entered calmly. “Mr. Sterling, Serena Zhou was hit by a car. Should we…?”

Leo was about to rise when he paused, taken aback. “What happened? Was it one of ours or…?”

The assistant’s expression was meaningful. “…It was an accident!”

Leo shot the assistant a glance. “How is she now?”

“She’s already been taken to a nearby clinic by passersby. Her injuries are currently unknown, but they shouldn’t be serious. The car wasn’t going fast…”

“Keep an eye on her. Let me know immediately if anything changes!”

The assistant nodded and left.

Four hours later, Leo received a call from his assistant with the news that Serena was fine, but she had lost the baby.

Hearing this, Leo let out a huge sigh of relief.

On the fourteenth day of the first lunar month, three days after Serena's accident, Leo visited the business office.

Although Serena had been thrown a couple of meters by the car, she only suffered minor abrasions and was otherwise unharmed.

After her miscarriage, she had only rested for two days in the hospital before being discharged. There was a mountain of business to attend to at the Zhou family; she had no time to rest.

This time, Leo came to the business office with several hefty gifts—contracts for logistics bases, a significant investment from Tianxing, and a promise to rename the East Building…

“As long as you listen to me, you won’t suffer and will gain many benefits…” 

Leo pushed the documents across the table to Serena. “If you ask for these, I’m sure Leo will give them to you, but… that requires my approval!”

Serena’s face was pale, devoid of any color. She appeared weak and frail.

“Serena, don’t force yourself. You can’t handle it. Forget about the Sterling family; you can’t even handle Duan Kangyu. Why push yourself into a corner over a doomed romance…”

Leo coaxed gently, “You’re a smart person. Now that the child is gone, I believe Leo doesn’t need to know about this, right?”

Serena remained silent, her posture cold and desolate.

Leo continued, “You want to enjoy sweet moments with Leo, right? I can make that happen. I can give you another six months to enjoy your romance, but…”

His gaze turned icy, “…you wouldn’t be foolish enough to end up on the operating table again, losing another child. After all, that can be quite damaging to your health…”

Having said all this, Leo felt he shouldn’t push too hard.

So he left her with a feigned concern. “Take good care of yourself. If you need anything, just call me…” and he stood up to leave.
