**Chapter 1: The First Apology**

As soon as the door closed behind her friend, Serena Zhou immediately pulled out her phone to check for missed calls and messages. Unsurprisingly, there were none from Leo Sterling. This stubborn wolf cub was truly a headache when he decided to sulk.

Serena racked her brain, trying to figure out how to coax him back. She thought about seducing him again, but then recalled last night’s escapades—her waist still ached from their passionate encounters. So, that idea was off the table.

After struggling to find a solution, she finally decided to give him the cold shoulder for a few days. However, after having lunch from the cafeteria, Serena couldn’t help but grab her phone and send Leo a sweet message. It seemed her body had become accustomed to his cooking; eating cafeteria food felt like torture for her stomach.

Unfortunately, after sending the message, she waited anxiously for a reply, but Leo did not respond.

When work ended, Serena made her way down to the parking garage, only to run into Cheng Lin. Seeing him triggered a wave of disappointment in her chest. Without giving it much thought, she picked up her phone to call Leo, but he didn’t answer.

With her resolve faltering, Serena decided to muster up her courage and visit his apartment. But when she arrived, it was empty. Everything looked just as she had left it that morning. Leo hadn’t returned since he left in the middle of the night.

Slumping down onto the sofa, she sighed. She just wanted to enjoy a simple two-year relationship, but why was it so hard? It was all Leo’s fault for being so stingy. Did a big man like him really care so much about a label? He could just enjoy the benefits without complicating things!

Then she thought, maybe she was the one being unreasonable. Even if she couldn’t resolve her issues with Duan Kangyu for the time being, shouldn’t she at least give Leo some hope? Or perhaps explain the situation a bit?

Once Serena began reflecting on her own mistakes, she realized she had a lot of flaws. She could see where she had gone wrong. Leo wanted a proper title, and he wanted to enter her life, to understand her in every way. That wasn’t a bad thing at all. After all, he wasn’t just some kept man or hired help.

Every care and concession Leo made was driven by one thing—his love for her. Love should be something beautiful, and she didn’t want to tarnish it. Yet, by keeping her family and work matters from him, did he see that as a lack of trust?

Serena thought back to the words she had said to Leo, feeling regret and annoyance at herself. She was frustrated at her own foolishness and arrogance.

After a solid moment of self-reflection, Serena decided not to dwell on her confusion any longer. She stood up and headed for Qishan. Although she wasn’t entirely sure Leo would be there, she was following her gut instinct.

She chose to drive herself instead of letting Cheng Lin take her. By the time she reached Qishan, the sky was already dark. Parking at the foot of the mountain, she followed the winding path she remembered from her last visit.

To her surprise, the crops that had barely reached her knees last time were now towering well above her height. The pathways through the fields twisted and turned, creating a maze of routes.

Without a flashlight, she relied on the light from her phone to navigate as she pressed on, but the night outside was growing increasingly eerie. The cacophony of frogs and other bugs only added to her unease, especially when she stumbled upon a graveyard. A chill ran down her spine.

While trying to comfort herself—after all, she was an atheist—she quickened her pace. However, after walking for what felt like an eternity, she still hadn’t found the little white villa.

After a good amount of sweat, she finally had to admit to herself that she was lost. Forgetting about the surprise she wanted to give Leo, she hastily called him.

Damn it. No answer.

Frustrated, she sent him a text. As she walked and waited, still no reply from Leo.

Panic began to settle in. What if Leo had already gone to bed, or worse, what if he hadn’t come to Qishan at all?

Regretting her impulsive decision to rush out to this desolate place, she realized once again that acting on impulse was a devil’s trap. She had proven this rule true once more!

Recognizing her rashness, Serena paused to catch her breath, then climbed onto a smooth rock by the roadside. If she had no choice but to spend the night outdoors, she might as well make herself comfortable on this relatively flat surface. Fortunately, it was summer, and although the night breeze carried a chill, it wasn’t too cold.

Just as she settled in, Leo’s call came through. Glancing at the screen, a smile spread across her face as she answered, “Leo…”

But before she could finish her greeting, Leo’s voice cut through, cold and sharp. “Serena, where are you? Did you come to Qishan?”

Feeling a wave of guilt, she lowered her voice. “Leo, I’m sorry. I wanted to apologize in person, but I got lost…”

Leo’s breath hitched, a mix of anger and worry evident in his tone. “You fool, who cares about your apology? It’s late... Send me your location and don’t move from where you are.”

Serena meekly replied with an “Okay,” and obediently sent him her location.

Leo checked the map, relieved to see she wasn’t too far away. Just as he was about to reassure her not to worry, Serena’s warm, soft voice came through the phone.

“Leo, I’m really sorry. Don’t ignore me. I’ve never been in a relationship before, and I thought it was all about sweet nothings and romance. I thought boys didn’t care about titles. I should have explained my situation with Duan Kangyu to you earlier…”
