**Because of Fu Nanyin**

Serena Zhou naturally hoped that Leo Sterling would return soon. 

“Isn’t my sister going on her honeymoon with Duan Kangyu after their engagement? If I come back too early and you’re off enjoying your honeymoon, then we still won’t get to see each other…” 

Leo’s tone was cold and distant. Serena could feel the simmering frustration he was trying to suppress. 

With a gentle sigh, she replied, “Duan and I aren’t going on a honeymoon…”

Leo narrowed his eyes slightly, his displeasure still evident. “Why? Are you waiting until after the wedding?” 

Serena found herself at a loss for words and fell silent. 

Her silence only added to Leo’s frustration. He finally couldn’t hold back and pushed Serena away from his embrace. 

“I’m going to get some water…” 

He got up and left the bedroom. 

Serena could sense Leo’s increasing harshness during their intimate moments, which reflected his dissatisfaction with her. She accepted this punishment, thinking that she understood everything and felt fearless. But as she watched Leo’s retreating back, a heavy feeling settled in her heart.

After hesitating for a moment, she climbed out of bed. “Leo, let’s talk…” 

Leo seemed to ignore her words entirely, heading straight to the fridge for a drink. After finishing, he walked out to the balcony for some fresh air. 

Serena found it hard to endure being ignored like this. Yet, she had always prided herself on her resilience. If he wouldn’t acknowledge her, she wouldn’t back down. 

“Leo, I’m sorry. Please don’t be angry. I…” 

She wrapped her arms around his waist from behind, cautiously leaning against him. But the moment she touched him, he recoiled as if bitten by a snake. 

Serena held her awkward pose for a moment, stunned as she watched Leo. 

He seemed to realize his reaction was a bit excessive and softly said, “I’m not angry. You don’t need to apologize.” 

With that, he turned back to gaze silently at the dark night sky. 

Serena reluctantly let her arms drop to her sides, the atmosphere thick with unspoken tension. Leo wore a cold expression, and Serena didn’t dare to press forward with her usual teasing demeanor. 

“About tomorrow, you have a flight to catch, so you should get some rest tonight. I’ll head out now.” 

Serena sensed that the mood had soured, and she feared that staying longer would only make Leo angrier. At this moment, it was best for them to maintain some distance. 

Just as she was about to leave, Leo called out, “Don’t go yet. I still have something to ask you…” 

His expression was icy, and the tone of his voice carried an unmistakable chill, almost like a command that offered no room for refusal. 

Serena felt her confidence wane, and she obediently stood still, her voice barely above a whisper. “What do you want to ask?” 

Leo shoved his hands into his pockets, his demeanor as stern as ever, and posed a question that took Serena by surprise. 

“Are you bisexual?” 

Serena’s eyes widened in disbelief, and she stared at him, unsure if she had heard correctly. “What?” 

Leo’s cold gaze swept over her, and she felt a shiver run through her. 

“I heard Qin Lili say she’s going to intern at Shang Zhou this summer. Did you encourage her to go? You want to get closer to her to develop feelings?” 

Qin Lili… who? Oh, that girl who was always meddling! 

Why was she so talkative? 

Serena rolled her eyes internally and feigned nonchalance. “I thought you were going to say something serious. Are you upset about this?” 

Her dismissive attitude only fueled Leo’s annoyance. He shot her a hard look and spat out two words: “Explain!” 

Seeing that Leo was genuinely angry, Serena complied and replied softly, “Oh, okay. Let me explain. That Qin Lili… you misunderstood. It wasn’t me who arranged her internship at Shang Zhou. It was Shang Ruzhen who called her, you know their close relationship…” 

Leo narrowed his eyes, his tone cautious. “Really? You’re not lying to me?” 

Serena nodded, lowering her voice. “Of course not. While I’m currently the president of Shang Zhou, not everyone there has the last name Zhou. Shang Ruzhen, who oversees HR and marketing, could easily arrange for a female student to intern. It’s no big deal…” 

She paused and added, “…Leo, are you questioning me because of what Qin Lili said? Do you trust her more than me?” 

Leo’s expression softened slightly, but the clouds of doubt still lingered in his eyes, and his attention remained unyielding. 

“Stop dodging the issue. I’m not doubting you; I just want your explanation.” 

“Are you satisfied with this explanation?” 

Leo replied, “You can explain as much as you want. Whether I’m satisfied or believe you is my business. I’m not obligated to inform you of my thoughts.” 

Serena felt her face stiffen at his words… what did he mean by that? 

Blood rushed to her head, and she felt a flare of anger. 

“Fine. I’ve explained. Can I leave now?” 

Leo’s voice was low as he reminded her, “You still haven’t answered my first question.” 

The first question… whether she was bisexual? 

Serena suddenly felt a laugh bubble up, and indeed, she let out a cold chuckle. 

“Leo, you’ve been sleeping with me for almost two months. Don’t you know how I react in bed? Do you think my passionate responses are just an act?” 

Leo replied, “It’s precisely because I know how well we fit together in bed that I’m suspicious you might be bisexual instead of just gay.” 

That reasoning… Serena frowned. “You’re doubting me because of what Qin Lili said?” 

Leo stared straight at her, his voice icy as he added, “And because of Fu Nanyin…” 

The mention of “Fu Nanyin” caught Serena off guard. 

A fleeting sadness swept through her eyes. 

She didn’t want to bring this up again. 

However, she could let Duan Kangyu misunderstand, but she didn’t want to deceive Leo about this matter. 

But where should she start, or rather, who should she start with? 

After a moment of thought, Serena spoke calmly. “How do you know about my feelings for Fu Nanyin… did you hear that from Qin Lili too?” 

“No.” 

“Then how did you find out?” 

Leo shot back, his tone rigid, “Does that matter to you? Do you think that’s the main point?” 

It wasn’t particularly important, nor was it the focal issue. 

Serena sighed and suddenly turned around, grabbing a stool and sitting down on the balcony. 

Leo looked at her in confusion. 

He had thought she was going to leave when she turned around. 

He panicked for a moment, about to call her back. 

But then she suddenly returned, carrying a stool… 

As soon as she set it down and sat down, Leo felt the breath he had been holding on to. 

Serena… how could he be so afraid of her just leaving him behind?! 

As Serena looked up and saw Leo’s unusual expression, a wave of apprehension washed over her. 

In a gentle tone, she asked, “Do you want to bring a stool too? Let’s sit down and talk slowly?”
