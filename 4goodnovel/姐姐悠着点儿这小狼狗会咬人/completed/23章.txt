**The World’s Only Fresh Flavor**

Serena Zhou stared intently at Leo Sterling, her eyes wide and unblinking. His gaze made her feel a strange, fluttering anxiety...

“Can I take another look?” Leo asked as he reached out to peel back the covers that enveloped Serena. “I didn’t get to see it clearly the first time!”

Even though he hadn’t seen it in detail, that moment had hit him like a bolt out of the blue, leaving a lasting impression. Now it flashed through his mind repeatedly, an instinctive urge to see more, to see it better.

Typically bold and straightforward, Serena found herself feeling shy and reserved. She tightened the covers around her and frowned at Leo, asking hesitantly, “You’re not angry anymore?”

Leo chuckled softly, his voice soothing as he replied, “Look at how you’re wrapped up. If I were still angry, you’d have every reason to question my sanity!”

He moved closer to her, even with the thick blanket separating them. Serena could feel the intensity of his presence, a warmth radiating between them...

She fought the impulse to retreat, but with the bed right behind her, there was nowhere to go. Frowning, she asked in a low voice, “Is that all it is?”

Lowering his head, Leo pressed a gentle kiss on her forehead, locking eyes with her as he earnestly said, “I’m sorry, sis. I was too petty before. I promise I won’t let the opinions of others push you away or make you sad in the future…”

He had already chosen this remarkable woman before him, and it was time to set aside his pride and disregard the opinions of those who didn’t matter.

A wave of joy surged through Serena’s heart. “You mean, even if people think you’re a sugar baby, you won’t care?”

Leo nodded, his voice low and sincere. “No one is more important than you, especially not…”

He tentatively, gently began to pull away the covers draped over Serena. When he caught sight of her beauty, his breath caught in his throat. All his worries and doubts vanished; all that remained was the sight before him—a body as captivating as a rose adorned with glistening morning dew, vibrant and enticing...

Unable to resist, Leo lowered his head to place a tender kiss on her lips. Their lips met, and in that instant, he felt a soft, refreshing chill from her touch. Serena's lips were even more delicate than the dew-covered roses.

No, this was truly the world’s only fresh flavor.

“Are you… ready?” Leo whispered, his forehead resting against hers, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he struggled to keep his voice steady.

Some ribbons from Serena’s outfit had come loose, adding to her allure. She wrapped her arms around Leo’s neck and, on her tiptoes, leaned forward, gazing deeply into his eyes, desire pooling within her.

She playfully bit the tip of his chin and murmured, “I’ve been waiting for this night for so long, Leo…”

With a teasing lick of her lips, she leaned in closer, whispering in his ear, “...Let me see your perfect abs, and also…”

Her hands began to wander downwards, exploring…

Leo was in pure bliss.

As he lifted Serena and tossed her onto the plush circular bed behind him, a sudden gust of wind burst through the unlatched window, slamming it open with a loud bang. The heavy curtains billowed wildly.

But the two of them, now tangled in each other, were lost in their own world, oblivious to the chaotic winds and the torrential rain that soon followed. The thunder roared and rolled, shattering the tranquility of the night with an exhilarating intensity!

In the dead of night, the relentless thunder rumbled on, eventually lulling Serena into a deep sleep.

“Serena… the rain has stopped. Should we go watch the sunrise? If so, we need to get up now!” Leo’s voice gently roused her from her dreams.

The night was dim and hazy. Serena blinked, her eyes cloudy as she focused on Leo’s striking features, momentarily lost in thought.

“Serena, are you alright? Do you feel unwell?” Leo asked, concern lacing his voice.

She shifted slightly, instinctively muttering, “It hurts.”

“Where? Your waist? Let me massage it for you!” he offered, slipping his hand beneath the covers to gently knead her lower back.

“Is it better?” he asked, looking down at her with worry.

Serena nodded, then asked, “What time is it?”

Leo was surprised. “Your voice is hoarse! Does your throat hurt? Do you want some water?”

Only then did Serena realize her throat felt a bit scratchy. She frowned, nodding, “A little.”

“I’ll get you a glass!” Leo quickly jumped out of bed to pour her some water.

Serena turned her head to watch him as he moved, the shadows and light playing across his back. Suddenly, fragments of last night’s enchanting moments flooded into her mind, filling her thoughts entirely.

She licked her dry lips, replaying the night she had with Leo… it had exceeded all her expectations. Leo not only had the perfect abs but astonishing stamina...

Serena seriously doubted that he was being truthful when he said it was his first time.

But she never hid her desires... that must be why her voice had become hoarse.

Leo soon returned with a glass of water, asking, “Serena, can you sit up? If not, I can find a straw to feed you…”

“No need, I can manage.” She forced herself to sit up, accepting the glass from Leo’s hands and gulping it down. She had never felt this thirsty before; one glass wasn’t enough, so she had him pour another.

Seeing her exhausted and weak state made Leo’s heart ache.

“I’m sorry, Serena. I lost control last night…” he said, his cheeks flushing at the memory.

But it wasn’t entirely his fault; it was just that such a tempting sight had been right before him, constantly enticing and challenging his self-control.

He couldn’t help but lose himself.

“…It’s almost six o’clock now. You should rest well. We can go watch the sunrise another time.”

Serena nodded and curled back under the covers. She truly couldn’t get up.

“What about you? Aren’t you tired?” she asked.

Leo shook his head, diving under the covers beside her. Serena admired his youthful energy in the dim light, feeling a pang of envy.

He wrapped his arms around her and leaned down to plant a soft kiss on her lips, whispering, “Are you in much pain?”

Serena’s eyes sparkled, “A little, but it was also wonderful.”

Leo smiled knowingly. “As long as you’re satisfied!”

The two of them nestled together, sharing sweet, slightly embarrassing words of affection, before quickly drifting back to sleep.
