**Mutual Affection**

The next day, Serena Zhou did something unprecedented: she took a day off on a non-holiday. She cast aside all concerns and immersed herself in a world of indulgence with Leo Sterling, completely lost in the haze of passion.

Even though issues like identity and the future were taboo topics, they had an unspoken agreement that if it couldn't be discussed, then there was no need to mention it at all. During their time apart, Leo had come to a realization: as long as he and Serena were deeply in love and could always be there for each other, nothing else really mattered.

Once he accepted this, their days together returned to the sweet, honeyed routine they once enjoyed. Yet, the engagement between Serena and Daniel was still a lingering concern for Leo. However, since Daniel had voluntarily postponed their engagement, Leo speculated that he might not even need to intervene; perhaps Daniel would one day end things himself. After all, Daniel had always treated Serena with disdain, and whispers of his behavior had spread throughout the shallow waters of their social circle.

That day, Leo went to pick up Serena from work. As the elevator doors opened, he spotted her carrying a bouquet of roses. Frowning, he took the flowers from her, feeling a twinge of unease. He raised an eyebrow and asked, "And this is...?"

Serena, unbothered, replied, "Yeah, they’re from Daniel. Can you just throw them away for me?"

Upon hearing that the flowers were from Daniel, Leo immediately threw them into the trash can. Once they were in the car, he couldn't help but question her, "If you were just going to toss those flowers, why did you bring them down? Couldn't you have let Daisy handle it?"

Serena was focused on texting someone, her tone casual as she answered, "It’s just that Daniel sent them. I should at least show some respect; I can’t just throw them away in the office."

Leo fell silent for a moment before asking again, "What’s gotten into Daniel lately? Why does he keep sending you flowers?"

Serena set her phone down, a troubled look crossing her face. Recently, Daniel hadn't just been sending her flowers; he had also facilitated two investments for her. In both public and private settings, his attitude toward her had undergone a complete transformation. He was now gentle and affectionate, making Serena feel as if the previously harsh and disdainful Daniel had never existed.

Serena couldn't tell whether this was just another one of Daniel's manipulative games or if he had genuinely let go of his suspicions about her. Regardless, it didn't matter. Right now, her priority was to secure the business deal, and it was certainly a bonus to have Daniel's help. If he chose not to assist, his mere presence would not affect her as long as he didn't side with the company.

After the incidents involving the business, including the drowning of a key investor and the fire at the Shallow Love Club, Serena was confident that the investors would no longer seek to curry favor with Daniel. He wasn't one to show unnecessary mercy. Even if he suspected the club had suffered theft during the fire, the recent upheavals surrounding the business could not possibly escape him.

It was a chaotic time for the company, with the elderly patriarch suddenly being sued by a creditor claiming to possess a loan agreement written twenty years ago, and another key player being publicly accused of embezzlement. Meanwhile, a gambling addict’s debts had ballooned to millions, attracting the attention of the casino’s enforcers. Even the two-year-old illegitimate daughter of that gambling addict had mysteriously gone missing.

All of these events were intricately connected to Serena, but as long as they didn't impact Daniel's interests, he would likely stay out of the fray.

Serena paused for a moment before responding to Leo, "Daniel is unpredictable, his intentions hard to decipher. I don’t even know what kind of game he’s playing this time! Leo…"

She turned to him, her eyes sparkling with a playful smile, and asked sweetly, "Could you take me to Qishan before school starts so I can see the crops you planted?"

Suddenly inspired, Serena licked her lips, "The last time we didn’t get to enjoy the pea fields together... What a shame! Those flowers must have wilted by now. Are the flowers still blooming in that bend in the field? Can we still visit?"

She raised her eyebrows at Leo, lost in a beautiful daydream.

Leo looked at her, shaking his head in helplessness. He understood that Serena was shifting the conversation to spare him from worrying about Daniel. She didn’t want to discuss him or her work-related troubles with him. While he felt touched by her consideration, he couldn’t shake the sense of impending loss.

Serena loved him, but it seemed her affection was that of a lover rather than a partner. The realization left Leo feeling deflated. Should he just come clean about his identity and force his way into her life to solve everything for her? But Serena, despite often appearing cute and innocent in front of him, was not a fragile woman who couldn’t fend for herself. In fact, when faced with challenges, she was composed and fearless, capable of solving her own problems without relying on anyone.

The only times she displayed any vulnerability were when she was slightly tipsy or during their intimate moments. He loved Serena in all her forms, yet each time he hesitated about revealing his true identity, he couldn’t help but recall the last advice from Adam Song.

Adam had told him not to reveal his true self too soon. "You’re still young; there's no need to rush into marriage. Enjoy the relationship first. At the very least, you should date for a few years, getting to know your partner thoroughly before deciding to commit for life. Then, and only then, should you reveal your identity!"

He had given Leo a firm pat on the shoulder and said, "Just remember, it's normal for others to be attracted to your body, but if they have ulterior motives... you'll need time to figure it out!"

Before leaving, Adam had emphasized, "Above all, stay calm. Don’t let a woman lead you by your emotions!"

Taking a deep breath, Leo tried to remind himself not to let Serena sway his emotions. But it was a tall order. Serena had a way of effortlessly stealing his thoughts away.

When she mentioned wanting to share a romantic moment in that bend of the flower field, Leo found it impossible to suppress the images that flooded his mind.

"I can go any time, just let me know when works for you..." he said, his voice trailing off.

Serena pondered for a moment, "Hmm..."

Squeezing out an entire weekend would be nearly impossible, especially since they were currently in a crucial phase of negotiations with the investors. The thought of being entwined in the flower field was something she could only dream about for now.

Suddenly, her phone buzzed. She glanced at it and saw it was Daniel calling. After a brief hesitation, she answered, her tone sweet and obedient as always. "Uncle Daniel... Yes... Okay, I’ll be there soon!"

After hanging up, she looked at Leo, her expression conflicted. "Daniel wants to see me; he said to meet him at the Spring Color Club. Can you take me, Leo?"

The tender feelings that had just begun to blossom in Leo's heart were crushed in an instant. He clenched his jaw, his tone edged with dissatisfaction as he remarked, "Daniel has been asking to see you more and more lately..."
