The Most Notorious Rival

Serena Zhou waited outside the emergency room for what felt like an eternity, her heart racing until the storm of anxiety finally settled within her. Only then did she sincerely thank Mr. Lu and Mr. Su. If it hadn't been for their timely intervention tonight, she couldn't even begin to imagine what kind of predicament she might be in right now.

Both Mr. Lu and Mr. Su graciously waved off her gratitude, insisting that it was nothing. But Serena remained earnest, insisting that she must treat them to a meal as a token of her appreciation. Unable to refuse her insistence, the two men reluctantly agreed.

They stood with Serena for a while longer outside the emergency room until Mr. Su received a phone call and had to leave, telling Mr. Lu to keep her company. 

Serena protested, “How can I trouble you again?”

Mr. Lu replied with a warm smile, “I have nothing pressing to do. You're just a girl; it's only polite for me to stay with you!”

His sincerity caught Serena off guard, and she felt a wave of gratitude wash over her, leaving her speechless. Mr. Lu didn’t pry into what had happened; instead, he simply sat beside her, scrolling through his phone in comfortable silence, which eased Serena's tension.

Time passed slowly, and eventually, the light above the emergency room dimmed. Dr. Tong Wenzheng emerged first, delivering the good news that Shuang Yan was stable and would only need to stay in the hospital for observation for a couple more days.

Serena expressed her heartfelt thanks to Dr. Tong before dialing Shuang Yan’s sister-in-law, Yan Jiajia. After wrapping up her calls, Sister Dai, Lin Cheng, and a few others from Duan Kangyu's team arrived at the hospital.

Serena exchanged a few brief words with Sister Dai and Lin Cheng, and before the Shuang family could arrive, she prepared to leave. But Dr. Tong suddenly called out to her, “Wait, Miss Zhou…”

Surprised, Serena turned back, “Is there something else, Dr. Tong?”

Dr. Tong adjusted his glasses and smiled softly, “Not really. I’ve just always wanted to meet you!”

Serena’s intuition sparked; she sensed he was up to something but wisely chose not to respond. Dr. Tong continued, “Please don’t misunderstand, I have no ulterior motives. I’m merely curious about what my most notorious rival looks like!”

His casual mention of “rival” caused several heads to turn, particularly Mr. Lu, whose expression remained neutral, but surprise flickered in his eyes.

This left Serena feeling somewhat embarrassed. She quickly explained, “That was a long time ago. I only see Sister Nanyin as a respected elder now. You don’t have to worry, Dr. Tong!”

Dr. Tong raised his hand to show off his wedding ring, grinning, “I’m not worried at all. I was just curious about you, Miss Zhou. Now that I’ve met you, my curiosity is satisfied. I’ll be on my way now. Goodbye!”

With that, Dr. Tong turned and walked away. Serena stood frozen for a moment before collecting her emotions and leaving the hospital with Sister Dai.

As they exited, Mr. Lu graciously offered to drive Serena home. She politely declined, saying, “Mr. Lu has already helped me tremendously today. I truly appreciate it. If it weren’t so late, I would insist on treating you to a drink…”

Mr. Lu chuckled lightly, “You’re too kind, Miss Zhou. Today’s events were merely coincidental…”

After exchanging a few more pleasantries, Mr. Lu left in his car. As soon as he departed, Serena climbed into her own vehicle. Since she had asked Lin Cheng to wait outside Shuang Yan's room until Yan Jiajia arrived, Sister Dai drove Serena back to Leo Sterling's apartment.

Upon seeing Serena, Leo’s eyes widened in surprise and joy. “Sister, you’re here!” He remembered her mentioning earlier that she wanted to take a break.

But as he took in the bruise on her face, his expression shifted to one of concern, his tone turning serious. “Sister, what happened to your face?”

He gently reached up to touch the bruise, his eyes filled with sympathy. Serena shook her head, keeping her eyes closed, and replied softly, “It’s nothing. I just bumped into something.”

Leo bit his lip, clearly unconvinced by her words. However, he didn’t press further; instead, he took her hand and led her into the living room, gently settling her onto the sofa.

“Have you eaten dinner? Are you hungry? There’s still some red bean and mung bean soup warm in the pot…” he asked tenderly.

Serena relaxed into his embrace, shaking her head. “I’m not hungry, just a bit tired. Can you hold me for a while? Then please run some water for me; I want to take a bath…”

Leo tenderly brushed the strands of hair from her forehead and placed a gentle kiss there. “Alright,” he murmured, wrapping her tightly in his arms for a while before getting up to run the bath.

Once the water was ready, Leo returned, scooping Serena up from the sofa and carrying her into the bathroom. He set her down on the sink’s edge and noticed her weary expression. “Sister, do you need my help?”

Leaning against Leo’s shoulder, Serena shook her head gently. 

As he peered through the collar of her shirt, Leo was horrified to see another large bruise on her neck. 

“Sister, you’re hurt…” he said, his face darkening as he reached for her dress.

Serena gasped, looking up at him in confusion. “What are you doing?”

Leo paused, his expression serious as he gazed at her. “What happened today? How many bruises do you have? Let me see!”

Without waiting for Serena to object, he swiftly pulled off her dress. 

When he saw the numerous bruises covering her skin, his eyes narrowed, and he demanded, “Who did this? Was it Duan Kangyu? Did he hit you?”

Looking at Leo’s concerned face, a warmth spread through Serena’s heart. She tightly grasped his hand, whispering, “Duan Kangyu didn’t hurt me. If he really wanted to, he wouldn’t have done it himself. These bruises are from the chaotic pool party earlier today…”

Serena briefly recounted her experience at Duan Kangyu’s pool party, omitting any mention of her conflict with Shuang Yan. She explained that the drunken partygoers had accidentally bumped into her while fooling around in the pool.

But Leo wasn’t naïve. He stared at Serena, his tone sharp. “Are those people all martial arts experts? How could they leave these kinds of marks just from bumping into you…”

Serena’s eyes dimmed slightly, and she lowered her head defiantly. “Leo, don’t ask anymore. It was just an accident tonight; it doesn’t hurt too much…”

“Accident?” 

The word made Leo’s jaw tighten. 

He suddenly recalled what Lin Cheng had mentioned before, how every time Serena went out with Duan Kangyu, something would always go wrong. Was this incident just like those previous situations? 

Duan Kangyu… this man was becoming increasingly annoying!
