I Love You So Much

After Sheng He left, Serena Zhou's eyes sparkled as she gazed at the contract documents in front of her. This was all money—real money—and earning it was no easy feat! The corners of Serena's lips curled up in a cold, mocking smile.

It was the sixteenth day of the lunar new year when Leo Sterling finally returned to Qianhai. Serena drove to the airport to pick him up. The moment they met, they embraced tightly.

Serena was bold and unreserved. In Leo's arms, she tiptoed and wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling his head down to her level before eagerly kissing him.

Leo reveled in Serena's enthusiasm. She was always overflowing with warmth when it came to him. The two of them exchanged affectionate kisses in the bustling airport hall, their fingers interlocked, gazing sweetly into each other's eyes as they made their way to the car.

Curious, Serena asked Leo about his grandmother's condition. He replied that it was an old ailment; due to her age, they couldn't risk surgery, so she was just receiving palliative care.

Leo then inquired about Mrs. Meng, as well as Duan Kangyu... In fact, Leo had already heard most of this from Lu Yan. However, Lu had painted everything in a much more flattering light, claiming that Leo had practically resolved all the issues.

Serena had also mentioned in her call that Sheng He not only involved her in the project but also secured a significant investment from Tianxing. More importantly, she promised to support Jiang Jiang in the lawsuit against Duan Kangyu. Even Mrs. Meng's case would have connections facilitated through her...

Despite this, Leo wanted to ask Serena again if Sheng He's attitude toward her was really as friendly as Lu Yan had described. After all, if Sheng He genuinely treated Serena like family, it would alleviate many of his worries!

"Don't worry..." Serena replied nonchalantly, "President Sheng said that matters in Qianhai aren't a problem; she’ll help take care of everything!"

Serena spoke the words with ease, her smile bright. "I've been getting along splendidly with President Sheng these past few days. But she went back to Qingheng last night; otherwise, we could've invited her out for dinner..."

As they drove, Serena continued to casually discuss various serious matters with Leo. However, once they arrived at Leo's apartment, she was no longer interested in those topics. All she wanted was to throw herself at him without a care in the world.

"Little Leo..." Serena helped him take off his bag and then grabbed his hand, pulling him toward the bathroom.

Leo missed Serena just as much; it felt as if their passion for each other could burn endlessly. After the fervor faded into darkness, Serena felt hungry, prompting Leo to finally get up and cook.

As Serena savored the meal Leo prepared, pure satisfaction lit up her face. "Little Leo, your cooking is amazing! It’s just my taste! You’ve truly captured my heart with your culinary skills, and I adore you so much!"

Seeing Serena's delighted expression, Leo felt his heart swell with warmth. He couldn't help but pinch her nose gently and replied with a soft smile, "I love you too!"

Serena gazed into Leo's eyes, feeling a sense of gratification that he had become more obedient under her influence. Yet, a wave of sadness washed over her. Such a wonderful boy—who would ultimately claim him for themselves? No matter who it was, Serena felt she could bear the gratitude of that person.

After Leo returned to Qianhai, for the first couple of months, he spent most of his time at Tianxing. If it weren't for Serena's objections, he would have directly invested Tianxing under the Zhang family’s name to prevent Serena from being busy every day and attending social gatherings every night.

In the new year, their daily interactions remained similar to before. Serena was busy with business matters, Mrs. Meng's situation, and maintaining a clever back-and-forth with Duan Kangyu before the trial began. Meanwhile, Leo juggled his academic responsibilities while preparing various meals for Serena and planning dates and proposals.

Leo had always wanted Serena to take him to Hengxue to meet her grandfather, and he also wished to visit her parents’ graves for a memorial service... But Serena was too busy to find the time.

"Don't worry. This year during Qingming, I really can’t spare the time. I promise to take you to Hengxue next year..." Leo said, a hint of disappointment in his voice.

"What about our wedding?" he asked, feeling a bit aggrieved. Since his return to Qianhai, he had been contemplating taking Serena back to Qingheng to see his grandmother. If it weren't for her poor health, he would have brought her to Qianhai to meet Serena.

After visiting his grandmother, they would go to Hengxue to see her grandfather and pay respects to Serena's parents... After all, he had already met some of Serena's family, like Mrs. Meng, and he had visited her brother in the hospital.

Leo wanted to find a good time to discuss their wedding plans with Serena. However, she seemed disinterested, even though the business was thriving for the Zhang family, and Serena had even expanded the operations further...

Even with Jiang Jiang's lawsuit against Duan Kangyu for the illegal detention and abuse of her sister approaching, Duan Kangyu had voluntarily resigned as president of Donglou, further reducing the threat against Serena...

And even with Sheng He's assistance, Mrs. Meng's murder trial was postponed. Everything seemed to be going well, yet Serena remained incredibly busy—busier than she had been before the new year, to the point where she had almost no time for dates with Leo.

When they met, she was either busy enjoying his cooking or busy with him. Leo longed to take Serena on a proper date or a trip together. But seeing her even once a day felt like a blessing.

Before his defense presentation, things had been fine since he was busy too. But once that was over, he found himself with a bit more free time.

During her social events, he would drive her, occasionally letting Lu Yan join her if the guests were particularly difficult. In crucial meetings with city officials where Lu Yan couldn't manage, he would sometimes show up himself. 

Though Leo despised the drinking culture, he forced himself to put on a fake smile for Serena’s sake. Generally, after successfully getting Serena away from the social events, he would sweep her into his arms and take her away, just like tonight...

However, more often than not, by the end of the evening, Serena would have fallen asleep or passed out. But tonight, Leo wanted to have a genuine conversation with her, so he held back his desires.

As soon as he mentioned marriage, Serena practically wished he would knock her out. While fixing her hair and dress, she said, "Little Leo, Mrs. Meng is still in jail, and my brother is in that state. I really can’t think about marriage right now..."

Leo understood that discussing this topic might be inappropriate at the moment. Yet, he felt an undeniable sense of insecurity about their relationship, as if Serena still wasn’t entirely his. This unease fueled his desire to solidify their relationship through marriage; perhaps once they were married, he wouldn't have to overthink or feel anxious anymore!
