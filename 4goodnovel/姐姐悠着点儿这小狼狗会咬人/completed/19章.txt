**Chapter 1: The Unexpected Reunion**

“What's wrong, sister?” 

Kneeling on the bed, a young man with frost on his face but desire glimmering in his eyes looked at her in confusion. 

Serena Zhou crossed her arms, her expression icy. “Leo, what are you doing?” 

A hint of mockery shone in Leo Sterling's eyes as he replied, “What do you mean, what am I doing? Isn’t this what you’ve always wanted? You called me here for this…” 

Serena knew this situation wouldn’t be easy to gloss over. Her expression softened, her tone calming as she spoke gently, “I did call you for intimacy, but that’s not the only reason. If you have doubts, let’s clear them up one by one…” 

“Doubts?” 

Leo stood up from the bed, adjusting his clothes nonchalantly. “I don’t have any doubts. I just suddenly realized that your initial suggestion sounded pretty good…” 

Serena furrowed her brow. “What do you mean?” 

Leo’s eyes narrowed slightly. “When you first laid eyes on me, wasn’t your intention to take me?” 

Serena froze, her gaze turning cold. 

“Serena, I’m genuinely curious. Is the ‘boyfriend’ you speak of the same as the boyfriend I understand?” 

It felt as if they had come full circle. The sweetness of their month-long relationship washed away in an instant. 

Leo reminded himself not to let the words of that girl, Shang Ruzhen, get to him, yet he couldn’t help but think. If he and Serena were truly in a romantic relationship, how could she be so warmly submissive while intimately talking to another older man right in front of him? 

“Uncle Duan”… that damned “Uncle Duan”! And the damned practice sessions… 

Leo hated such intimate relationships that had ulterior motives from the start. But he couldn’t ignore the relationship between Serena and Duan Kangyu. At least for now, it seemed unavoidable. 

It wasn’t that he couldn’t avoid it; he had already sent someone to investigate Duan Kangyu’s background in secret. 

From the moment Leo resolved to be with Serena, he never viewed Duan Kangyu as an obstacle. His only uncertainty lay in the true feelings of the woman before him. 

She claimed she wanted to be with him simply because she liked him. Yet during their time together, Serena had seemed eager to push him towards intimacy. 

He understood that Serena was likely afraid of the inhumane methods she might face after becoming engaged to Duan Kangyu, which was why she sought him out… 

But he absolutely couldn’t accept that Serena was merely trying to please Duan Kangyu by being with him. 

And when Serena almost spoke the word “breakup” on the balcony earlier, Leo felt a wave of fear and panic wash over him. 

In the past, he would have avoided a girl like Serena, who had a complicated background and deep scheming. But now, he was deeply entangled. 

Leo loathed this feeling of wanting to hold onto someone but being unable to grasp them completely! 

If that was the case, it would have been better if he had never accepted the hollow title of “boyfriend” and just remained as a simple “friends with benefits.” Maybe then he wouldn’t feel so anxious! 

Serena rubbed her forehead, speaking softly, “Leo, listen carefully. If I were just trying to please Duan Kangyu, I wouldn’t have sought you out. I’d have found someone shallow like Yang Yang, who knows his place…” 

To be honest, Serena wasn’t fond of coddling others. 

“I thought you understood before we began this relationship that Duan Kangyu is an unavoidable presence. But he’s someone for the future; he shouldn’t affect our present…” 

Someone for the future… 

Leo’s hands clenched into fists as he gritted his teeth. “Don’t twist my words, sister! You initially wanted to find someone for practice because of Duan Kangyu, didn’t you?” 

Serena didn’t deny it. 

“Did you seek anyone else before me?” 

Serena shook her head. 

Leo leaned closer to Serena, his voice cold and fierce. “Don’t lie to me, sister!” 

Serena sighed and looked up at Leo, asking straightforwardly, “Leo, what will it take for you to believe that I’m genuinely in love with you, that I want to be with you and share intimacy with you?” 

“I believe you like me. I just can’t determine the purity, intensity, and longevity of your feelings.” 

Serena frowned. “How can I prove that? By not being intimate with you and just playing at a relationship?” 

“Not that extreme!” Leo lowered his head, cradling Serena’s face, his intense gaze locked onto hers as he spoke gently, “I just want you to honestly answer me one question…” 

“Go ahead, ask.” 

“What do you see Duan Kangyu as?” 

Serena pondered seriously before answering, “That’s a complicated question; I can’t summarize it in one sentence. I can only say that the Zhou family needs Duan Kangyu as my fiancé, but I personally don’t need him!” 

“So the one trying to please Duan Kangyu is the Zhou family’s Serena, not my girlfriend Serena?” 

Serena wrapped her arms around Leo’s waist, smiling softly. “Your girlfriend only wants to please you; she wouldn’t even spare a glance at other men!” 

“Then why did you say you wanted to break up earlier?” 

Serena shook her head vigorously. “That was just to show you how much I like you! How could I bear to break up with you?” 

To prevent Leo from asking more questions, Serena suddenly stood on her tiptoes and planted a gentle kiss on him. 

Leo watched as Serena, clearly wanting to entice him, felt a surge of annoyance at his own doubts. 

She didn’t want to part from him; that was good. He would make sure she never wanted to leave him for the rest of her life! 

With a steady heart, Leo took control of the kiss initiated by Serena, gradually deepening it. 

They only pulled away when their breathing was ragged and their faces flushed. 

“Are you washing up first, or should I, or shall we wash together?” 

Foreheads touching, Leo’s eyes sparkled with warmth and affection. 

Serena replied nonchalantly, “Of course, we should wash together! Otherwise, how could this night be considered wonderful?!” 

Leo had grown accustomed to Serena’s unabashed nature. 

During their time together, she always spoke flirtatious words so openly and confidently, often leaving him blushing. 

He leaned down and pecked Serena’s lips, whispering, “Alright, we’ll wash together…” 

Just as Leo picked Serena up and headed toward the bathroom, a sudden, unwelcome knock on the door interrupted the moment. 

Thinking it was room service, Leo shouted, “No need for cleaning, thank you!” 

But the knocking didn’t stop, continuing with rhythmic insistence. 

Now both Leo and Serena felt something was off. 

“Put me down; you go answer the door!” Serena urged. 

Reluctantly, Leo set her down and walked over to open the door. 

As soon as he swung the door open and saw the person outside, the cautious and guarded look on his face instantly transformed into disbelief and joy. “Bro, what are you doing here?!”
