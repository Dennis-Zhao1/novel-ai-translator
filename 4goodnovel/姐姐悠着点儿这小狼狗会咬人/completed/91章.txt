"You can leave now."

Serena Zhou’s words struck General Leo Sterling like a thunderclap. 

Leo's eyes narrowed into slits, glinting with a cold light that sent a shiver down Serena’s spine. It felt as if she were standing in the icy depths of the ocean. But she had come too far to turn back now, and she never intended to. 

After a long silence, Leo finally spoke, his voice sharp as a bell. "You once had a child with Leo Sterling..."

The mention of a child clearly struck a nerve, a painful point for the general and his wife. Serena hadn’t meant to provoke them with this information; she had never had a child with Leo. The whole charade had been a trap set for Leo's sister, and at that time, she hadn't known who in the Sterling family would fall into it. 

Eventually, it was Leo's sister who got ensnared, and Serena wasn’t sure if it only trapped her or if it also involved the general and his wife. But judging by Leo's reaction now, she felt almost certain that the trap had only caught his sister. A secret sigh of relief escaped her.

When it came to lying, Serena felt no guilt. "Yes," she replied, her gaze as deep and calm as an ancient well. "The Sterling family can be stained with the blood of the Sterling family. If I marry into the Sterling family, it is just a matter of inheritance..."

Throughout history, great families often began their decline from within. Serena believed Leo understood this truth all too well. So, he would never allow her to be with Leo Sterling, nor would he permit her to drag Leo into a power struggle within the Sterling family.

However, she held too many cards, and if Leo ever learned even a fraction of the truth, he would distance himself even further from the Sterling family… he was already quite far from them!

Serena aimed to force Leo to choose between his only son and his sister. She did not believe that the general and his wife truly despised Leo. Perhaps they had vented their frustrations on him because of the other two children, but after all these years, she was certain they did not wish to harm him further...

Leo coldly stated, "You will not marry into the Sterling family!"

Serena had anticipated this reaction and stayed silent. 

Leo continued, his voice icy, "My sister may have sinned, but not to the point of death. She made a mistake, and the Sterling family will punish her. I can hand over Song Weiming for you to deal with, but as for your Zhou family... I have no interest. However, Miss Zhou, allow me to give you a piece of friendly advice: my willingness to discuss these matters today is not because you threatened me with my son, but rather a small compensation for the loss of your child..."

"If you dare to appear before me again, I will make sure the entire Zhou family disappears from this world..."

"Leo must not know even a hint of this; everything must be an accident."

"You can leave now!"

Faced with the visibly furious General Leo, Serena did not comply. Instead, she smiled coldly, her voice sharp as a blade. "If I give General Leo the impression that he can easily manipulate me, that is my fault..."

She pushed a gift box containing audio and video files a little closer to Leo. "... These materials can be examined at your leisure, and you might find unexpected revelations. After all, these two good-for-nothings came from the Sterling family, and when a family closes its doors, darkness often prevails..."

Serena needed Leo to understand that she held the deadly cards against the Sterling family! They were evenly matched, even though she was merely posturing. But she could not let Leo see through her façade of weakness, though perhaps it was impossible to hide.

As for whether Leo and Song Weiming had done any harm to their own family... even if they hadn't, their hands were stained with blood, and they had been caught red-handed, threatening General Leo with that very truth... this was a disgrace for the Sterling family!

"I will borrow the Sterling surname for a year and will return the family’s tranquility when the time comes. Goodbye!"

After saying this, Serena stood up and left, her back straight, her demeanor calm and composed, neither servile nor arrogant.

As she stepped out of General Leo's study, she heard exaggerated exclamations from downstairs. "Wow, little Leo, your skills are really impressive! What other shapes can you make... Oh, Aunt, look, he made a heart-shaped one..."

Descending the stairs, Serena found three people gathered in the living room making dumplings, all turning to look at her.

"Serena..."

Leo approached her, holding a half-finished dumpling. "Did you finish talking with my dad?"

Serena maintained her composure, smiling lightly as she nodded. She glanced at the table covered with dough and filling and asked, "Are you all making dumplings?"

"Yeah, are you hungry? There’s fruit and milk on the table..."

Serena wasn’t hungry, but to calm the tumultuous emotions within her, she poured herself a glass of milk. After finishing it, she still felt a bit low on energy...

Noticing her fatigue, Leo gently offered, "I have mints in my pocket."

He leaned slightly toward Serena. 

Serena reached into his pocket, taking out a mint and popping it into her mouth. Gradually, her mind cleared up, and she felt energized enough to join the dumpling-making team.

However, despite the apparent simplicity of making dumplings, it actually required some experience. Serena and Lin Su struggled, earning laughter from Song Haizhou, whose dumplings were hardly any better.

"Leo, you should teach your aunt and sister! Look at what they’ve made; no one would believe they’re dumplings, they look more like buns..."

Serena and Lin Su shot sharp glares at Song Haizhou. 

"Hey, don’t look at me like that! My dumpling-making skills are about as good as yours. You can’t blame me; it’s just that little Leo’s dumplings look too good, each one like a piece of art..."

"The difference between our dumplings and his is just too obvious..."

Song Haizhou smugly implied, "... how can our little Leo be so exceptional!"

His words made both Lin Su and Serena feel a bit uncomfortable. 

Leo only found Song Haizhou’s chatter annoying, frowning as he said, "Why do you talk so much while making dumplings?"

Serena glanced at Lin Su and held the dough up to Leo, sweetly saying, "Little Leo, I want to make a heart-shaped dumpling too; can you teach me..."

Leo smiled at Serena, patiently guiding her until she successfully made a heart-shaped dumpling. 

Looking at Lin Su’s dumpling, which was a sad sight with no discernible shape, she turned to Leo and said, "Little Leo, can you also teach Aunt how to make a heart-shaped one? I think Aunt’s crescent-shaped one looks perfect already..."

Lin Su and Leo exchanged a perplexed glance at those words, while Song Haizhou shot Serena an appreciative look.

Lin Su, holding her dumpling wrapper, suddenly felt at a loss, while Serena tugged at Leo’s shirt.

Leo had no choice but to quickly finish his dumpling and then picked up a new wrapper to demonstrate to Lin Su, slowing down his movements to show her how to do it.

Lin Su, compared to the younger generation, such as Song Haizhou and Serena, could completely express her nurturing affection as an elder. But with Leo... that sense of distance, even disdain, seemed almost instinctual.

Whenever Leo approached Lin Su, she instinctively recoiled. 

Leo taught her earnestly, but suddenly Lin Su put down her dumpling and said, "Alright, I’ll wash my hands and get some water. You all take your time making dumplings!"
