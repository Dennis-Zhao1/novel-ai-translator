A Red Dress

"Miss Zhou, where do you live?" 

Leo Sterling quickly set down the gifts he had brought. He took the car keys from Serena Zhou's hand and politely opened the car door for her. 

"Thank you," Serena said as she settled into the car and provided him with an address. 

As Leo started the ignition, he paused for a brief moment upon hearing the address, frowning slightly. 

Noticing his reaction, Serena teased, "Is it too far?" 

Leo replied casually, "It's fine." 

Distance wasn't the issue; it was that the area she lived in was an affluent neighborhood located in the foothills. He worried it might be difficult to catch a cab on the way back. 

“By the way, I still don’t know your name.” 

“My name is Leo Sterling!” 

“Leo… that’s a nice name.” 

“Thank you. By the way, Miss Zhou, the police came to see me the other day…” 

Serena’s expression darkened. “Is it because of the accident that happened that day?” 

Leo nodded, asking, “Have you seen the police’s accident investigation report?” 

“I have. It was a brake failure.” 

Not wanting to dwell on the topic, Serena changed the subject. “What’s your major, Leo?” 

“Agriculture!” 

“That’s quite an uncommon field. What made you choose that?” 

Leo smiled softly. “I was influenced by my grandfather.” 

Serena responded with an “oh,” and then inquired, “Are you from around here?” 

As they drove for nearly forty minutes, Serena kept asking Leo various questions. She wanted to learn more about him. 

Leo was very patient; no matter what question Serena posed, he responded courteously, albeit briefly. 

The winding mountain roads had sharp turns, and the ground was slick from the light rain earlier, but Leo's driving skills were impressive, making the ride quite smooth for Serena. 

Before long, they arrived at the Zhou residence. 

Serena instructed Leo to stop at a fork in the road about a kilometer away from her home. 

“I’m here. Thank you for driving me back. It’s late, and it might be tough to catch a cab around here. You have class early tomorrow, so just take my car back.” 

Before Leo could respond, Serena pulled out her phone and continued, “Give me your number, and I’ll have my driver come to get the keys from you tomorrow.” 

Leo hesitated, a frown crossing his face. 

Noticing this, Serena raised an eyebrow and smiled. “What’s wrong? Are you planning to run down the mountain at this hour? Or do you not want to give me your number because you’re afraid I might… harass you?” 

The word "harass" made Leo suddenly recall the day of Serena's accident, when she had whispered her feelings for him in his ear and encouraged him to stay by her side. 

His expression stiffened, and he felt a warm blush creeping up his ears. 

“Miss Zhou, you misunderstood; I have no objections…” 

Serena’s voice took on a teasing tone. “So, no objections means… I can ‘harass’ you now?” 

Leo's cheeks flushed a deeper shade. “Miss Zhou, you…” 

“Don’t be nervous; I’m just joking.” 

Seeing him fidget in his seat brought a smile to Serena’s face. She extended her phone toward him. 

“… Can you just input your number?” 

Leo looked at her sparkling eyes that revealed her genuine interest in him and frowned slightly. He took her phone, quickly punched in a series of numbers, and handed it back to her. 

Serena dialed his number right in front of him. 

His phone vibrated in the pocket of his jeans almost immediately. 

After saving his contact, Serena waved goodbye with satisfaction, stepping out of the car. 

“Thank you, Leo. Drive safely. Bye!” 

Serena stood by the roadside, watching as Leo drove down the mountain. 

The headlights of passing cars occasionally illuminated the winding roads in the valley. 

Serena tightened her grip on her phone, standing at that fork in the road for a long time, the chilly night air brushing against her skin… 

Though she was eager to win Leo over, after their brief encounter the night before, she sensed that Leo had a somewhat aloof and proud demeanor, making it unsuitable to pursue him too aggressively. 

Even though she had gotten his number in a straightforward manner, she didn’t plan on contacting him first. 

After patiently waiting for two days, Leo finally called her. 

However, at that moment, Serena was in a meeting and couldn’t answer. 

When the meeting wrapped up, she called him back, but Leo happened to be in class and missed her call. 

When Leo returned her call again, her phone was switched off. 

Leo was surprised; he could guess that someone like Serena was likely from a wealthy background, and people like her typically wouldn’t stay unreachable for long. 

But when he tried again two hours later, her phone was still off. 

What if something happened? After all, the accident from that day was rather suspicious… 

While pondering this, Leo fiddled with his phone as he walked toward the school gate when he suddenly heard someone call his name: “Leo!” 

He looked up to see a sleek black convertible parked by the road, next to which stood a stunning woman in a flowing red dress, her makeup bold and striking. 

Her hair was elegantly styled, and she shimmered with jewels that sparkled brilliantly, almost blinding him. 

“Miss Zhou…” 

The enchanting figure was, in fact, Serena. 

Seeing her like this left Leo momentarily speechless, his eyes wide with surprise. 

He instinctively stepped forward, greeting her politely, “... What brings you here?”
