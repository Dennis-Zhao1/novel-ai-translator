I just want to seek justice for my brother. Unfortunately, the internet six or seven years ago was nowhere near as developed as it is today. The girl in the video, after publicly accusing Duan Kangyu, quickly found herself facing a backlash from public opinion instead. Some questioned the authenticity of her accusation, while others suspected she was merely trying to gain fame by targeting Duan Kangyu and the Donglou Group. There were even rumors suggesting that she had been Duan Kangyu's mistress before being discarded, and that her grievance was fueling her baseless slander.

At that time, Duan Kangyu had a famous movie star girlfriend, who overshadowed the girl in every aspect. Consequently, the girl was mocked, being dismissed as a "frog trying to eat swan meat," implying she was just seeking attention and stirring up trouble. However, the most damaging blow to her reputation came from a revelation by her university roommate, who disclosed that the girl was actually a lesbian. Back then, the stigma attached to the term "lesbian" carried far more weight than the content of her accusations.

The girl's video was swiftly taken down, but it was too late. Internet users dug up her personal information and that of her family, exposing them to relentless harassment. After the video was removed, there were no further news reports on the situation, and it was soon overshadowed by other public scandals. Duan Kangyu managed this situation with remarkable ease at the time.

However, seven years later, when this incident resurfaced, it was much harder for Duan Kangyu to replicate his previous tactics. Along with the resurfacing of the video, the girl's personal diary was unexpectedly leaked. In her diary, she detailed the abuse and torment inflicted on her by Duan Kangyu. She also candidly admitted that she indeed did not like men. Because her sexual orientation was inadvertently exposed, she and her family suffered prolonged online harassment. Some people vandalized their home with graffiti, while others called to verbally abuse her and her family. They were treated like pariahs, shunned by friends and acquaintances alike.

Duan Kangyu even sent people to threaten her family, warning them that if they dared to oppose him again, he would ensure they met a grim fate. The girl fell into a deep depression and ultimately took her own life by jumping from a building. Her tragic story and the heart-wrenching entries from her diary stirred deep empathy among the public. As a result, netizens clamored for the local government to investigate the truth behind the events of that time.

This wave of public sentiment was intense, and the local government found it impossible to suppress; they could only announce a thorough investigation. Before they could uncover the full truth, the stock price of Donglou Group began to plummet. Duan Kangyu's past misdeeds were being dragged out into the light, and any actions that strayed from legal and moral boundaries were met with public outrage. After seven years, the tide of online bullying finally turned against Duan Kangyu.

For the first time, he sensed he was caught in a storm from which he could not easily escape. Meanwhile, Zhou Jingshu had decisively announced before this public outcry that she was breaking off her engagement to Duan Kangyu due to his infidelity on the night before their wedding with his secretary. From that moment on, she and Duan Kangyu were no longer connected.

Not long after Zhou Jingshu unilaterally declared the annulment of their engagement, Duan Kangyu sought her out at Shangzhou amidst the swirling scandal. He presented enticing offers and laid out his reasoning. "Jingshu, you must know the ins and outs of what happened between Yingying and your brother. It was your brother who wronged Yingying first..."

Zhou Jingshu was aware that Zhou Jincheng should not have caved to the pressure from Zhou Yunfang and chosen to marry Tang Ying to completely expel the Shang family from the Shangzhou Group. However, his actions were not worthy of such dire consequences.

Still, Zhou Jingshu remained unmoved. "Uncle Duan, my brother is currently lying in a hospital bed, unable to move—practically a corpse. We can find many ways to compensate for the wrongs done to Tang Ying, but it will never include my brother's life..."

"And as for the harm Tang Ying inflicted upon my brother, I have not sought revenge in kind; I merely wish for her to face the legal consequences she deserves. I think I have already shown great mercy. What more do you want?"

Duan Kangyu understood that Zhou Jingshu had endured humiliation for so long, and now that Tang Ying had returned, she would not let the opportunity slip easily. However, Tang Ying was the only child of his late sister; he had to be her pillar of support. He could not bear to watch her go to prison. Tang Ying had lived a comfortable life; she would not survive the harsh reality of prison life.

"I hope you can let Yingying go. We can settle this outside of court. Whatever conditions you have, just name them, and I will find a way to meet them!" For Tang Ying, Duan Kangyu was willing to make substantial concessions. Zhou Jingshu never doubted this.

"Uncle Duan, to me, my family's lives are priceless. I know you are wealthy, but unfortunately, my family has never been on my list of items to trade!"

Duan Kangyu narrowed his eyes, a sharp glint flashing within. "So, we have no room for negotiation on this matter?"

Zhou Jingshu answered firmly and clearly, "None!"

A long silence enveloped Duan Kangyu. "Then what about us? Has there never been anything between us?"

A tinge of sorrow clouded Duan Kangyu's expression. Zhou Jingshu smirked slightly. "Of course there has been. I have spent over a year trying to please you in various ways. How could there be nothing at all…"

She raised her left hand, revealing a long, faint scar on the back of her hand. "…For example, this scar constantly reminds me that if I dare to show mercy, then I, my brother, and everything the Zhou family has suffered will have been deserved!"

Her tone was light, but her eyes were cold and sharp, like a blade. A deep chill radiated from her gaze, as if it could cut through to the bone. Zhou Jingshu's attitude spoke volumes; she would not compromise, would not bargain, and would not show him even a hint of kindness.

The softness she had previously exhibited was merely an illusion. The Zhou Jingshu who bared her fangs before him now was the true version of herself. She would fight him to the bitter end, just as she had done with the Shang family. And all the harm he had inflicted upon her in the past…

Duan Kangyu opened his mouth, only to swallow his words. What was there to explain? Zhou Jingshu was too clever to be unaware that his past difficulties for her were both to avenge Tang Ying and to suspect that Zhou Jingshu might possess evidence against Tang Ying. After all, as soon as Zhou Jincheng had an incident, Tang Ying had hastily left the country. How could such behavior not raise suspicion?

"Jingshu, are you really prepared to go against me to the end?" Duan Kangyu asked.

Zhou Jingshu replied coldly, "I just want justice for my brother. If Mr. Duan tries to stop me from achieving that, then I will have no choice but to accompany you to the bitter end!"

Mr. Duan… Duan Kangyu gritted his teeth. "So, you think you have the courage because of that pretty boy backing you up, allowing you to be so brazen?"

Zhou Jingshu was not surprised that Duan Kangyu had discovered Sheng Tang's true identity. Given that Duan Kangyu had sought help from the local government to no avail, he must have guessed that the opposition was not solely from her, especially since the Zhou family, while well-known, did not possess the power to sway the government significantly.

Moreover, with Donglou's stock prices plummeting multiple times, it was evident that someone was manipulating the situation behind the scenes. The Shang family had just been expelled from Shangzhou, which had allowed them to regain some vitality, but it was not enough to affect Donglou's operations. So, it was not difficult for Duan Kangyu to suspect that Zhou Jingshu had someone backing her!
