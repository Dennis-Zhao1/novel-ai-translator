I Like You

“Haha, your boyfriend?”

Before Serena could finish her sentence, Rachel already interrupted her with a teasing laugh. She pulled her hand away from the table and shot a sideways glance at Leo, who was sitting nearby. The young man in front of her, with his slightly green, handsome features, looked just like someone who was living off a rich woman.

Rachel pointed at Leo in disbelief and asked, “Serena, are you serious? Is it that he’s particularly good in bed? Or is it some kind of impressive size that made you lose your mind like this? Boyfriend… Haha, Uncle Duan only let you pay for the meal, but he didn’t say you could find a boyfriend! Do you want me to call him right now...?”

“No need to bother...” 

Serena glanced at her vibrating phone on the table and gently picked it up. 

“Uncle Duan… Yes, are you having fun? Oh, I’m just here with my boyfriend at Fanyin Mountain, but it seems there are no available rooms at the inns here. I heard you have a special suite at Qingmei Hotel; I wonder if we could borrow it for tonight… Oh, thank you, Uncle Duan, bye!”

After hanging up the phone, Serena dialed another number right in front of Rachel. 

Rachel had initially wanted to mock Serena for how obedient she sounded on the phone with Uncle Duan, but when she saw the number Serena was dialing, her expression immediately changed. 

“Serena, what are you doing? You’re crazy! Hurry up and hang up the phone...”

As Rachel spoke, she reached out to grab Serena’s phone, trying to hang up before it connected. 

But before her hand could touch Serena’s phone, the call was already answered. A crisp, bright voice came through, “Hello? Serena?”

Hearing that voice, Rachel froze and dared not move. She shot a half-threatening, half-pleading look at Serena, silently urging her to hang up. 

Serena smiled back at Rachel and softly replied to the woman on the other end, “Sister-in-law, are you at Fanyin Mountain?” 

“Me? No, why?” 

“Oh… if you’re not there, then I might have mistaken someone. When I was climbing earlier, I saw a couple ahead that looked just like you and my cousin. I thought you both came here for a vacation and I was hoping we could have dinner together. Since you’re not at Fanyin Mountain, I guess we’ll have to plan for next time!” 

“What! You said you saw them at Fanyin Mountain… Serena, I’ll get in touch with you later!” 

The call was abruptly cut off. 

Rachel glared at Serena, her eyes filled with fury, “Serena, you little…” 

Before she could finish her curse, her phone rang. 

With a resentful glare at Serena, Rachel picked up her phone and marched out: “Hello, babe, no, it’s not what you think. She must have seen it wrong; how could I possibly go on vacation without you...”

Her obsequious words faded into the distance as she disappeared around the stairs.

The sweet and romantic atmosphere dissipated, and Serena quietly looked at Leo, who had a dark expression on his face. She softly said, “I’m sorry for ruining the mood. Have you eaten well? If so, can we head back to the room?” 

Leo glanced at the few onlookers on the terrace who were pretending to be casual but were clearly eavesdropping on their conversation. He nonchalantly replied, “What, are you embarrassed?”

Serena knew he was upset; tonight should have been a wonderful night. But now...

She realized that when someone was angry, no matter how reasonable the explanation, it sounded like a defense. Especially for someone as proud as Leo.

If he wasn’t her boyfriend but just someone willing to be pampered by her, their interactions might have been much easier. But if he genuinely wanted to be that pampered guy, she would feel more disappointed.

Serena responded, “So you think it’s embarrassing? You really have thin skin!”

“I’m not just thin-skinned. Serena, I’m genuinely curious why you listen to Uncle Duan so much.” 

A wave of sadness surged within Leo. Rachel’s comment, “He wants you to find a pretty boy to practice with,” pierced through him like a sword, leaving him breathless.

“Do you think I look experienced, like I’d make a good practice partner?” 

Serena shook her head.

Leo’s voice turned cold again, “Then why did you choose me? Don’t brush me off; I want to hear the truth!” 

Serena met Leo’s intense gaze; his expression was stern and serious. She had no doubt that if the answer wasn’t what he wanted to hear, or if her confession didn’t sound sincere enough, he would immediately walk away.

But she wouldn’t allow such a beautiful moment to end like this.

“Alright, I’ll tell you everything...” 

Suddenly, Serena stood up and, under Leo’s astonished gaze, walked over to the edge of the terrace. 

She cupped her hands around her mouth and shouted into the night sky filled with overlapping mountains, “...Leo, listen up! The only reason I, Serena, sought you out is that I like you! There’s no other reason. I know you care about certain things, but don’t worry, I won’t pressure you. If you don’t believe me, we can just break up...”

Before she could finish the word “break,” Leo rushed forward and covered her mouth with his hand.

“Serena, what are you doing? Are you crazy?!”

Leo glanced around the terrace and saw that everyone’s curious whispers had transformed into open laughter and gossip. His cheeks flushed slightly. 

Serena, however, remained calm and collected. 

She pushed his hand away and looked up at him, her expression serious. “Leo, if you….”

“Shut up!” 

Leo furrowed his brows and interrupted her, “Let’s talk when we get back to the room.” 

He then took her hand and quickly led her away from the terrace and back into their room. 

Once the door closed, Leo suddenly turned and trapped Serena between the door and his chest. One arm encircled her waist while the other lifted her chin, and he descended upon her with a fierce, commanding kiss. 

This kiss was anything but gentle; it carried a sense of anger and punishment. 

Serena tried to regain control multiple times, but Leo wouldn’t allow it, skillfully targeting her weaknesses. 

Before long, Serena raised her hands in surrender, struggling in discomfort. 

“Leo...Leo...” 

His name tumbled off her lips, fragmented and breathless. 

Serena pushed against him, but he was too tall and strong for her to budge. 

In a swift motion, Leo scooped her up and carried her a few steps forward, tossing her onto a spacious round bed adorned with rose petals arranged in the shape of a heart. 

Before Serena could recover, Leo had already leaned over her. 

With a kiss that lingered, he pinned her hands on top of her head, pressing her into the soft bedding. 

The kiss continued, deep and unyielding. 

Serena stopped struggling. 

Leo then released her wrists, exploring other parts of her body. 

Their lips separated, and finally, Serena gasped for air. 

The night breeze brought a coolness that cleared Serena’s heated thoughts. 

“Leo, Leo, Mr. Leo...” 

Serena glanced at the fervent young man above her, calling out his name repeatedly. When he didn’t respond, she grew impatient and kicked him in the shoulder, taking the chance to roll off the bed.
