"I just want to be your wife, Leo Sterling!"

Leo was taken aback by Serena Zhou's sudden burst of emotion, but he quickly laughed and added the rest of his sentence, "…you need to listen to me first. It's not that I don't want to get a marriage certificate with you. I dream about us being together openly. I just can't take you to get a certificate secretly; that would be too unfair to you..."

Serena’s frozen expression softened a bit. "So, what do you mean? If you don’t want to sneak off to get a certificate with me, are you suggesting we announce it with a loudspeaker?"

Leo gently wrapped his arms around her, his brow creasing with warmth as he said seriously, "Serena, how about you come home with me for the New Year? Then, after the holidays, I’ll visit your family."

"Getting married is a beautiful and joyous occasion. We can't keep it a secret from our families; that would be disrespectful to you, and I can't allow myself to do that..."

Serena realized Leo was being sincere. She looked thoughtful, her eyes darting around. "But I… Leo, I'm already in deep trouble with Duan Kangyu."

"If we quietly get our marriage certificate, we can still be like before… During the day, I can outsmart them, calculating gains and losses, and at night, I can be affectionate with you."

"With the marriage certificate in hand, you'll have security and no more worries. I can dive into battle without looking back..."

"But if we have to meet our parents… the whole process of preparing for marriage can get complicated. I don’t feel ready to handle Duan Kangyu and the Donglou Group before the New Year..."

Serena had the capability to send Tang Ying to prison, and she could even pull Duan Kangyu down from his CEO throne at Donglou Group. However, the financial power of Donglou Group was formidable, and it wouldn't be easy for her to tackle it alone. She needed powerful allies—like the Sheng Group and Leo's family.

Serena expressed her concerns without hesitation.

Leo reassured her, "Serena, you don’t need to worry about Donglou Group or Duan Kangyu. I’ll take care of everything for you. Not just them, but any trouble you face in life, you can count on me to handle it!"

Serena pulled away from Leo's embrace, raising an eyebrow, her voice laced with skepticism. "You?"

He nodded confidently. "Yes, me!"

Serena scrutinized Leo, her expression cautious. "Leo, we haven’t really shared detailed information about our families."

"From what I can see from your lifestyle and the gifts you've given me, I know your family must be quite wealthy, but dealing with Duan Kangyu and Donglou Group… that's not something money alone can solve, especially since you’re not from here..."

Leo didn’t quite grasp her concern. "Just because I'm not local, does that mean I can't handle Duan Kangyu? Do I need to have a residence permit for Qianhai City to deal with him?"

Serena smiled helplessly and patiently explained, "Leo, you’re still a student. I don’t want you getting involved in these matters, and I definitely don’t want your family dragged into this because of me..."

"I don’t know your family’s situation in detail, but I can imagine they wouldn't appreciate having to clean up after a woman who hasn’t even married their son yet..."

"If they did that, they would surely look down on me, and they would try to stop us from getting married. I want to be with you openly and proudly, and I can’t let your family look down on me. So, I have to handle Duan Kangyu myself..."

"You just need to support me like you did when I handled the businesses, waiting patiently at home for me!"

Of course, she could borrow strength from others. But she couldn’t just straightforwardly ask for help without any shame. Serena wanted them to offer their assistance voluntarily, and she needed to push back against it as much as possible!

Leo lowered his head, contemplating Serena's words. He spoke softly, "But if you go head-to-head with Duan Kangyu alone, it will be very tough for you."

Serena smiled defiantly. "Tang Ying colluded with my brother’s mistress, causing my brother to have an accident and helping that Summer person steal away most of my brother's assets. From the moment I returned to Qianhai to take over the business, I’ve wanted to send her to prison."

"But she was hiding abroad, and I couldn't send anyone to catch her there. So, I had to find a way to trick her back..."

"As for Duan Kangyu, he initially looked down on me and made things difficult for me. But at that time, the business was on the brink of bankruptcy, and we desperately needed a large capital injection, so I had no choice but to beg him for a marriage proposal..."

"Leo, you have no idea how ruthless Duan Kangyu was during that time. He toyed with me in all sorts of ways and humiliated me, but I had to endure it..."

"These were my own doing. Who told me I needed his money and connections? Yet he thought he could use Shang Ruyan's life to control me..."

Serena briefly recounted the incident at Duan Kangyu's villa, where Shang Ruyan had drowned, her eyes glinting with cold fury. "He’s so cold-blooded and vicious. If I can’t work with him, then we’ll inevitably be enemies. Because of Tang Ying, there’s no chance for us to become partners..."

"So, I knew from the start that I would eventually have to face him head-on. I’ve been preparing for this battle for over half a year, and I’m not unarmed."

That was what she said. But if the Sheng family remained indifferent, Serena doubted she could take down Duan Kangyu within two to three years.

These topics were too serious and could unknowingly cast a somber mood over them. 

Serena smiled gently, pinching Leo's soft, pale cheek playfully. "I know you care about me, Leo, but from the moment I returned to Qianhai, I’ve been prepared for hard work."

"Honestly, if I hadn’t met you, my life might be a thousand times gloomier than it is now. So don’t think you haven’t helped me; just having you by my side is enough to help me through all these challenges."

Serena said earnestly, "As long as you’re with me, I won’t feel that it’s tough. So, Leo…"

She handed over her household registration page along with the household book he had given her earlier, her tone serious.

"I'm giving you my household registration page along with your household book. You can decide when and how we go to get the marriage certificate."

"Ultimately, what matters to me is you as a person. I just want to be your wife, Leo Sterling. Whether the title of Mrs. Sterling is known to the world or remains a secret, I truly don’t mind!"

Serena’s eyes sparkled with joy as she spoke, her words filled with sincerity.

This declaration moved Leo deeply.

Without thinking, he pulled Serena into a tight embrace again, his voice thick with emotion. "Sister, you’re so wonderful. You’re so good to me; how can I allow even a fraction of grievance to come your way..."

"You can continue not to mind the things you don’t care about. From now on, I’ll take on the burden of caring for you!"
