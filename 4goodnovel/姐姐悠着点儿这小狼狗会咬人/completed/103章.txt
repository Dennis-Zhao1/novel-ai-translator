**No One Else Could Be Him**

This torment made Serena Zhou nearly unable to sleep. No matter how much she tried to convince herself otherwise, it was futile. Her mind was simply… broken. It was filled to the brim with the image of Leo Sterling and the beautiful moments they had shared together, ready to burst.

"Serena, let me give you a piece of advice. If you really love him, go and bring him back while there's still time..." 

Is there still time? Serena bit her lip, unable to respond. If only she could just get through this period...

"Don't think that just because you’ve managed to hold on for a while that it will get better. If you truly love him, this feeling of being lost will never fade away…"

Zhou Jingchen seemed to see right through her thoughts and emotions with ease. 

"I'm not exaggerating; I’m just describing the reality as it is..." 

"You already find life hard to bear, feeling tormented, but I tell you, Serena, this is just the beginning..." 

"You'll increasingly depend on anything that can cloud your mind..."

His gaze was deep, his tone profound, like that of a prophet. 

"You'll end up hoping someone will come to pull you back, or perhaps you'll seek out something new to replace him... but in the end, no one else could be him!" 

"There’s only one Leo Sterling..." 

Zhou Jingchen's expression seemed to reflect his own past, as if he were a mentor imparting wisdom.

"Brother..." 

Serena could no longer bear to listen, gritting her teeth to interrupt him. 

"...I'll seriously consider what you said. Is there anything else you want to tell me? If not, I'll come visit you next time..." 

Zhou Jingchen looked at her with a mix of pain and helplessness. "Of course, I have more to say, but why don’t you step out for some fresh air first?" 

"Okay~" 

Serena felt the itch for a cigarette rising. After leaving Zhou Jingchen's hospital room and stepping out of the hospital, she pulled out a cigarette and lit it. 

She took a deep drag, and finally, her anxious heart began to calm down. She hadn’t expected that she was still in the first half of this ordeal. She was already feeling this way; what would it be like in the second half... 

"Serena Zhou?" 

As she stood wrapped in her coat under a tree, just having taken two puffs, she suddenly heard someone call her name. 

Turning around, she was surprised to see a tall, handsome man holding a bouquet of flowers. 

"What's wrong? Don’t you recognize me?" 

Serena stared at him for several seconds before finally responding, "Fu Nanchuan?" 

She extinguished her cigarette and tossed it into a nearby trash can, forcing a smile that masked her astonishment. 

"When did you come back?" 

"Last night’s flight. Just got back!" 

"Really? The reason for your return is..." 

Fu Nanchuan raised the bouquet slightly. "My sister is pregnant, and my parents and brother-in-law have strictly ordered her not to work anymore, so I had to come back..." 

Serena was taken aback. "Sister Nanyin is pregnant?" 

Fu Nanchuan nodded. "What kind of expression is that? Surprise or disappointment?" 

Disappointment? Serena shook her head helplessly. Her own disappointment had nothing to do with that. 

"That’s just me expressing happiness for Sister Nanyin. What about you..." 

"My sister is having a check-up today; she's not feeling well and needs to be hospitalized for rest. I came to see her." 

At this, Fu Nanchuan suddenly remembered that Zhou Jingchen was also in the hospital and asked, "By the way, I heard your brother woke up? How is his recovery?" 

Serena briefly touched on Zhou Jingchen’s situation. "He’s recovering well, thanks for asking!" 

"Don’t mention it. After all, we were high school classmates..." 

Fu Nanchuan clearly noticed the cigarette hanging from Serena's fingers as he spoke. "Are you now..." 

Serena patted her pocket. The craving had passed, and she felt her spirits lifting a bit. 

"It was stuffy in the hospital, so I came out for some fresh air. Let’s go; I’ll go in with you. I want to see Sister Nanyin too..." 

Fu Nanchuan squinted slightly, his expression complex. 

"You’re not still interested in my sister, are you?" 

Serena couldn't help but laugh at the question. She hadn’t anticipated that after all these years, the events from her confession to Fu Nanyin would still linger. 

"Your sister is already married with kids. What could I possibly want? Besides, back then, I..." 

In front of Fu Nanchuan, Serena found it challenging to explain the situation. 

"Forget it; the past is the past. By the way, how was your time abroad all these years?" 

The two of them walked side by side into the hospital, exchanging pleasantries about each other's lives. 

Fu Nanchuan was Fu Nanyin’s younger brother, a childhood playmate and high school classmate of Serena. They could be considered childhood sweethearts. 

After graduating from high school, Fu Nanchuan went abroad for seven years. He rarely returned during holidays. 

During high school, Serena and he had a good relationship, but after he left, they lost contact completely. 

She hadn’t expected to run into him at the hospital. 

After seven years, the boy from her hazy memories had grown into a tall, refined young man with an elegant aura. 

With Fu Nanyin needing to take a break due to her pregnancy, Fu Nanchuan’s return clearly meant he was stepping into her role at the Haiting Group. 

The Zhou and Fu families had long-standing ties. Zhou's mother and Fu's mother were close friends, so their families maintained a friendly business relationship over the years. 

If the president of Haiting changed, Serena naturally needed to maintain good relations. 

They first went to visit Fu Nanyin, but since she was feeling unwell, Serena only offered a brief greeting before leaving—after all, her brother had matters to discuss with her... 

Fu Nanchuan briefly shared his experiences studying and starting a business abroad over the years. 

Then the topic shifted back to her. 

"I heard you’re now in charge of the Zhou and Zhou Group. Should I start calling you Director Zhou?" 

"Don’t flatter me..." 

"Honestly, Serena, since you took over the Zhou and Zhou Group, I’ve heard a lot about your achievements..." 

Serena didn’t feel like reflecting on those stories at all, so she refrained from responding. 

Fu Nanchuan only had one curious question, showing little interest in anything else. 

"...There’s just one thing I’m quite curious about, if you don’t mind me asking?" 

Serena hesitated for a moment, guessing what he wanted to know. 

"What?" 

"I heard you’ve been dating the president of the Shengyu Group for two years. Is that true?" 

The hospital corridor was quiet and spacious. 

Fu Nanchuan stopped walking, looking directly into Serena’s eyes with a piercing gaze. 

Serena felt a bit uneasy but still nodded, "Yes." 

"Is it just because you want to use him to deal with Donglou and Duan Kangyu, or is it because... you really like him?" 

Fu Nanchuan's deep voice trembled slightly, filled with an unquenchable curiosity. 

"...Did you actually write that confession letter you read to my sister on the radio for her?"
