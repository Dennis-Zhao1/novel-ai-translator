**Only Them**

With warmth and softness enveloping him, Leo Sterling found it hard to hold back his feelings. 

"Sister, how can you be so bold? Aren't you afraid...?"

"I'm not afraid. Are you?"

Leo pulled Serena Zhou tightly into his embrace. Despite the fire she had ignited within him, the remnants of his rationality still held firm, grounding him with principles and decorum.

"I'm a guy; I fear nothing. But you’re different. I’m afraid for you. Be good; tonight, I’ll do whatever you want, but during the day, we can’t risk it. What if…"

The mere thought of being discovered sent a shiver down his spine. This wasn’t just thrilling; it was dangerous.

"...In any case, I won’t let you get into a situation that could lead to endless trouble. So, please, just behave a little, okay, Sister?"

In this dynamic, Leo consistently showcased a sense of rationality and steadiness that contrasted with Serena's more impulsive and romantic mindset. 

Serena, in her giddy infatuation, felt blissfully liberated, not needing to overthink things because Leo was always there to consider everything for her. 

Leo doted on Serena with meticulous care and thoughtful affection, making her feel profoundly loved and secure. 

"I really like you more and more, Leo," she expressed earnestly.

Leo smiled, his face blooming with joy whilst feigning disappointment. "Just like?"

Serena gazed up at him, taking in his gentle, handsome features, and replied earnestly, "No, I think it’s love. I’ve fallen for you!"

Leo's heart raced, pounding harder than the last time when Serena drunkenly confessed her love to him in bed. 

"Miss Zhou..."

He felt a sudden stiffness spread through his body. Their relationship was moving too fast, fueled by an intensity that felt overwhelming.

Leo knew that pouring all his passion into this was risky. But he couldn't help but dive deeper into this connection, finding it impossible to maintain any distance from her. 

He suspected Serena wanted this fiery fling before her engagement to Daniel Yuan, but resisting her was beyond his strength! 

Even with their three-month timeline drawing to a close, and despite Serena never explicitly stating she wouldn't marry Daniel, Leo couldn't contain his urgent desire to reciprocate her feelings. 

He cradled Serena's face in his hands, gazing into her eyes, which sparkled with affection like a deep, boundless ocean. 

"...I love you too, very, very much!"

Serena wanted to tease him playfully in response, but the sincerity in his gaze left her speechless. 

His declaration of love sent a delightful shiver through her, leaving her mind in a swirl of emotions. 

In this flower-laden field, Serena experienced the purest, most beautiful, and warmest love one could ever imagine. 

All words felt inadequate in that moment. Following her instincts, she rose on her toes, closed her eyes, and pressed her lips against Leo's. 

The kiss was intoxicating, filled with emotion, freezing time as it enveloped them in bliss. 

It was a kiss that would be etched in their memories as the warmest, most unforgettable moment.

Blushing, Serena murmured, "Leo, I’m really hungry…"

Leo affectionately pinched the tip of her nose. "Then let’s go make dinner."

Serena grabbed Leo's hand and said, "No, Leo, my legs are a bit wobbly right now..."

Leo feigned surprise and raised an eyebrow, chuckling, "Is that all it takes for you to feel weak in the knees?"

Clearing his throat to regain seriousness, he added, "Alright, hop on my back!"

With that, he turned and crouched down.

Serena giggled and happily leaped onto his back.

That day, Leo attempted to cook several dishes, though they didn’t quite meet his usual standards. 

Serena insisted on helping him in the kitchen, but Leo couldn't let her handle the ingredients, especially when her choices were less than ideal, so he urged her to rest instead. 

But unlike Leo's small apartment, the kitchen was far from the living room. 

Serena didn’t want to be away from Leo, wanting to see him every moment. 

When Leo wouldn’t let her assist, she playfully ignited a spark of mischief in him. 

Despite Leo's repeated warnings that if she kept teasing him, the dishes would turn out poorly, Serena didn’t care. To her, it wasn’t about the food; she wanted him! 

Ultimately, Leo's self-control faltered under Serena's playful advances, compounded by the fact that the kitchen had an old stove, making it difficult to manage the heat properly. 

Two of the dishes burned, and the others were merely passable. Leo was quite frustrated. 

But Serena was in high spirits, happily devouring two bowls of steamed rice alongside the charred dishes. 

That night, they naturally indulged in affectionate cuddles and playful embraces…

Leo had planned for them to sneak out to the pea field under the moonlight. 

He had even prepared a blanket. 

But just as they were about to leave, a thunderclap echoed through the sky, halting Leo's hand at the door. 

Serena felt a twinge of regret. 

Leo, too, was somewhat eager to visit the pea field, but being cautious and optimistic by nature, he thought that staying indoors with the sounds of the wind and rain while cuddling was equally romantic and warm. 

"Don’t be upset, Sister; we’ll come back another time!" 

As he held Serena tightly, he did his best to console her. 

That night, the storm raged outside, turning the tranquil night into a chaotic symphony. 

During that weekend, Leo and Serena felt as though they had retreated to a world of their own, free from bothersome distractions and unwanted guests. 

It was just them amidst nature’s beauty, surrounded by lush green hills… 

The holidays soon approached, and Serena's engagement to Daniel was looming closer. 

Despite their time together, as the engagement date drew nearer, Leo couldn't help but feel anxious and restless. 

Even though he was prepared for this, the unease still simmered beneath the surface. 

Leo wasn’t from around here; his home was in Qingheng. 

Naturally, he would be heading back home for the holiday. 

That night, after their intimate moments, they lay together and chatted. 

Since Leo would be leaving the next day, Serena felt a pang of sadness. 

Leo didn’t want to return home; if it were any other year, he would have lingered in the shallow waters a bit longer. 

But this year was different. 

He absolutely did not want to stay in Shallow Sea, watching Serena prepare for her engagement to Daniel. 

Even if it seemed that Daniel and Serena might not reach the altar, the preparations alone were unbearable for Leo. 

So, this year, he decided to head home early. 

Serena, though reluctant, couldn’t find a way to keep him from leaving. 

Thus, their conversation remained light and casual. 

"What time do you leave tomorrow?"

"Two in the afternoon!"

"That time..." Serena recalled her fitting appointment for the engagement dress the next day and frowned, "…I can’t see you off. Do you prefer flying or taking the train?"

"Flying. It's fine; you don’t need to come see me off."

"When will you be back?" 

Leo paused for a moment, considering, then said lightly, "It depends; it’s not decided yet. Do you want me to come back sooner or later?"
