She couldn’t see Leo Sterling at all.

Serena Zhou turned to Leo, who replied coolly, “If we have children in the future, we’ll raise them ourselves. We won’t irresponsibly leave them to be cared for by our elders. You two don’t need to worry about raising our kids.”

Lin Su’s expression changed immediately.

Moreover, Sheng Yuan’s gaze sharpened in an instant.

Sheng He quickly interjected, smiling to change the subject. “Leo, Miss Zhou hasn’t been to Qingheng City yet, right? Why don’t you take her around…”

Before Sheng He could finish her sentence, Lin Su suddenly stood up and apologetically said to Serena, “I’m sorry, Miss Zhou, but I have something to attend to. Please, take your time!”

Lin Su’s attitude toward Serena was polite, almost as if she were treating an ordinary guest.

Compared to Sheng Yuan’s aloofness, Serena sensed Lin Su’s demeanor was even colder.

It was as if she completely ignored Leo’s presence!

There was no warm embrace like other mothers would give their sons upon their return home, nor was there any concern for Leo’s studies or life.

It seemed like she couldn’t see Leo at all!

“You don’t have to leave…”

Leo suddenly took Serena’s hand and stood up. His words were directed at Lin Su, but his gaze seemed to focus on something far away.

“… I just brought Serena to show you guys today. I’ll take her to my grandmother’s house shortly. Dad, Mom, Aunt, we’re leaving!”

As soon as Leo finished, he led Serena out, ignoring Sheng He’s attempts to keep him back, striding out of the Sheng residence.

Serena was still dazed as Leo directly helped her into the car. “Serena, I’ll explain everything later. Just wait for me a moment…”

Leo shut the car door, then went to the trunk to retrieve several gift boxes that he and Serena had carefully chosen to give to the elders of the Sheng family.

After explaining which gift was for whom, just as Leo was about to get into the car, Sheng He came rushing out.

“Leo, your brother is coming back tomorrow morning. Are you really not spending the New Year at home?”

Leo replied with a calm “Mm” and said, “I already told my grandmother that I’d bring my girlfriend home to meet her this year… It’s getting late, Aunt. We need to go!”

“Wait a minute…”

Sheng He stepped around Leo to the front of the car, knocking on the window. “Miss Zhou…”

Serena quickly opened the car door and stepped out. “Mr. Sheng.”

Sheng He said, “Calling you Miss Zhou feels too formal. Can I just call you Serena instead?”

Serena nodded.

Sheng He continued, “I’m sorry you just got here, and you haven’t even had a sip of tea yet. Now Leo is taking you away…”

Serena smiled softly, standing obediently without responding.

“Actually, we’re all very happy to have you here. This…”

Sheng He handed over three red envelopes. “This… is a small token from us as elders. Please accept it!”

Serena hesitated a bit.

Leo stepped forward, taking the envelopes and placing them in Serena’s hands.

He smiled at Sheng He and said, “Thank you, Aunt. We really have to go now!”

Sheng He looked reluctant to let them leave, her eyes lingering on Leo, clearly wanting to say more.

Serena held the envelopes tightly, gratefully thanked Sheng He, and added, “I’ll get in the car and wait for you…”

After Serena got back into the car, Sheng He turned away and spoke seriously to Leo, “Leo, marriage is a big deal. You must think it through. If your parents aren’t willing to step in, I can go to the Zhou family to propose…”

“Don’t worry, Aunt. I won’t make a hasty decision about marriage. Whether they want to step in or not doesn’t matter. I can propose to the Zhou family myself…”

Leo gazed at Serena with deep affection and said, “I won’t let Serena feel wronged because of my parents’ disdain!”

Sheng He frowned. “Leo…”

Leo interrupted her impatiently, “I understand, Aunt. By lunar age, I’m twenty-two, not twelve. I’ve long stopped caring about their attitude!”

Leo looked at his watch, “It really is getting late. My grandmother is still waiting for me. We need to go!”

Before getting in the car, Leo hugged Sheng He and said sweetly, “Thank you, Aunt. Next time you come to Qianhai, Serena and I will treat you to a meal!”

Sheng He sighed, holding onto Leo for a moment longer, her thoughts racing as she frowned deeply.

After politely bidding farewell to Sheng He, Leo jumped into the car, his movements hurried as he started the engine, as if he couldn’t wait to escape this place.

This was his… home?!

Serena sat quietly in the car, carefully observing Leo’s expression.

She noticed that as they drove down the winding road, further away from the Sheng residence, Leo’s expression gradually transformed from gloomy to bright.

“I’m sorry, Serena…”

When they reached the first red light after descending the mountain, Leo suddenly turned to her, giving a sheepish smile. “I thought we could stay at the Sheng house until tomorrow morning…”

Reaching out, he held Serena’s hand, and she noticed how cold his hand felt.

Feeling a pang of sympathy, Serena leaned closer and held his hand tightly, unsure of how to comfort him given the situation.

She could only gently shake her head and offer him a small smile.

But Leo simply unbuckled his seatbelt and leaned over, wrapping his arms around Serena for a tight embrace.

The red light turned green.

When Leo released Serena, a relieved smile was back on his face.

“Is your grandmother’s house far?”

Actually, Serena wanted to ask Leo why his parents treated him with such indifference and coldness… After all, he was so outstanding — composed, independent, excelling in his studies, and a fantastic cook.

She couldn’t pinpoint anything about him that would warrant disdain.

But seeing the change in Leo’s expression, she didn’t want him to feel unhappy again, so she held back her curiosity.

Leo replied, “My grandmother lives on the outskirts of the city. It takes about half an hour to drive there. You must be hungry…”

He pulled out a mint candy from somewhere and handed it to Serena. “Here, have a candy.”

“Thank you!” Serena took it, unwrapped it, and popped it into her mouth.

“If you’re still hungry…” Leo continued, “there are snacks in my backpack in the back seat. Help yourself!”

Serena raised her eyebrows in surprise. She glanced back at his bulging backpack, unable to contain her curiosity. “What exactly do you have packed in that backpack?”

“Just a little bit of everything for you.”

“Everything for me… what do you mean?”

Leo explained, “I prepared a few things because I was worried you might not feel comfortable at the Sheng house. After all, I rarely come back here. It’s not just General Sheng and Professor Lin who don’t welcome me; even the servants don’t seem to like me very much…”

“Every time I return, I have to prepare my own toiletries and pajamas. I don’t have my own room, so I can only sleep in the guest room…”

Leo’s tone was very calm.

But Serena felt a wave of sadness washing over her.

Unable to hold it in any longer, she asked, “Why is it like this? The Sheng family… isn’t it also your home? Aren’t you their biological child, but adopted?”

No. If he were adopted, a family like the Shens should treat Leo very well.

Disappointment was evident in Leo’s eyes, yet a smile remained on his lips. “I’ve wondered if I was adopted too, but unfortunately, when I was eleven, I secretly did a paternity test…”

Leo sighed, “... I am their biological child!”
