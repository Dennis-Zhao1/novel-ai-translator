**"Your scent is quite special."**

Leo Sterling knew that Serena Zhou didn’t want to delve deeper into her issues with Duan Kangyu, so he gritted his teeth and said awkwardly, “I won’t ask anymore, just take your shower. I’ll go downstairs to buy you some ointment!” 

After that, he left the bathroom, frustration boiling inside him. 

The moment he stepped out, Leo clenched his fist and slammed it against the wall. The sight of Serena’s bruised skin ignited a fire within him. But what fueled his anger even more was the fact that Serena hadn’t given him a proper place in her life, a position from which he could protect her and love her openly. 

The cruel things Duan Kangyu was doing to her—that debt would surely be settled. But before that, he needed to understand what Serena truly thought about him. Did she see him merely as a plaything, someone she could toy with and toss aside? Or was there something deeper? 

If Serena dared to treat him like a kept man, he would make sure she faced the consequences!

When Leo returned with the ointment, Serena was still lounging in the bathtub. 

In the quiet, her mind replayed the events of the evening. She couldn’t shake off the nagging confusion about why Duan Kangyu would risk someone’s life—Shang Ruyan’s—to set a trap for her. If she hadn’t rescued Shang from the pool, it was likely that the girl would have drowned in Weishan. 

In that scenario, she could only imagine the turmoil that would ensue, being implicated in a tragic accident while having been so close to Shang. Even if she managed to find witnesses at the party to corroborate that Shang’s fall was not her fault, the law might absolve her. But the Shang family wouldn’t let it go so easily. 

And given that everyone at the party was connected to Duan Kangyu, who would dare speak up for her if he didn’t say a word? 

Duan Kangyu… 

Serena submerged her face in the water, hoping to clear her thoughts. But just as she descended, someone yanked her arm, pulling her back up. She heard Leo’s panicked voice, “Serena, what are you doing?!”

Wiping the water from her face, she looked at Leo, puzzled. “What do you mean? I’m just taking a bath…”

She glanced at his hand, which was gripping her arm tightly, the veins bulging with tension. The pain made her frown. “Leo, let go! That hurts!”

Leo’s face turned pale as he saw that Serena didn’t look like she was trying to harm herself. He slowly released his grip, letting out a breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding. 

“Have you been in there forever?” His tone was awkward, even his words seeming uncomfortable.

Seeing Leo’s flustered expression, Serena couldn’t help but laugh. She bent down, scooping a handful of water to splash at him, teasing, “I was just waiting for my little brother to help me. How can I wash properly without your help?”

Caught off guard by the sudden splash, Leo jumped back a couple of steps, his eyes wide. The sight of Serena laughing and splashing water at him stirred something warm within him. 

In a moment of spontaneity, he tossed aside his T-shirt and grabbed the showerhead from the wall, charging at her for a playful counterattack.

They spent the next ten minutes in a joyful water fight, laughter echoing in the bathroom until they were both soaked, their hair dripping. Finally, Leo scooped Serena up and gently pushed her back into the bathtub…

The next morning, Serena woke up with patches of ointment all over her body. She had initially resisted, not feeling much pain. The real issue was the pungent smell of the ointment that she found repulsive. 

But Leo insisted she keep it on, insisting she had to wear it for a full twelve hours before she could take it off. 

“No way! What am I supposed to do at work?” she protested.

Leo nodded earnestly, his expression serious. “Who was the one crying out in pain last night? Look at all these bruises; they’re still so obvious…”

After a moment of silence, Serena weakly countered, “I wasn’t crying in pain because of this…”

Leo shot her a blushing glance but remained unyielding. “You still need to wear it…”

Considering that Leo had gotten up early to wash her clothes and cook breakfast, Serena reluctantly conceded, heading to work with the strong herbal scent lingering around her.

As soon as she entered the office, her colleague, Dai, informed her that Duan Kangyu had brought a few people and was waiting in the reception room.

“Got it. Please attend to them. I’ll be there shortly,” Serena replied before sitting down at her desk. She opened her laptop and logged into a foreign video site, sending a private message to Jiang Jiang.

*Serena Zhou: There’s a leak on your end. Duan is seriously suspecting or may know that I have the goods, and he might be aware that we’re in contact. He could postpone our engagement and continue testing me in more dangerous ways. Stay cautious.*

After sending the message, Serena tidied herself up and steadied her nerves before making her way to the reception room.

Upon entering, she headed straight for Duan Kangyu. 

“Sorry for keeping you waiting, Uncle Duan,” she said, her usual gentle smile on her face.

After politely greeting Mr. Su, who stood to the side, she added with sincerity, “If I’d known you were here, I would’ve gone to the East Building instead of bothering you both.”

Duan Kangyu’s demeanor was different from before; he now seemed genuinely affectionate. 

“You’ve been working too hard lately. I wanted you to sleep in a bit more; you’ve lost weight!” he said softly, concern lacing his words.

Serena gazed at him, her smile warm. “You’re still so considerate, Uncle Duan.”

“Who else would I be considerate towards if not my fiancée?” 

Though Duan had initially brought his team to discuss business, the two began to display their affection for one another, oblivious to the awkwardness it created for Mr. Su, who had been in the business world long enough to know about the events from the previous night. 

Reluctantly, he chimed in with some polite remarks, but it was clear he was there for work, not for entertainment.

Once the small talk was over, the three finally settled down to discuss business. Duan had summoned Mr. Su for a loan regarding a project, and with a swift signature on the guarantee documents, everything progressed smoothly. 

Serena had expected Duan to drag things out or hint at something more, but instead, he signed the contract without a hint of hesitation, even kindly asking Mr. Su to personally follow up on the progress. 

Once the business was concluded, Duan made to leave, even politely declining Serena’s invitation for lunch together.

“You’ve just taken over the company; there’s too much on your plate. I’ll arrange for you to meet Mr. Su for drinks next time. Let’s skip today!”

Grateful for his thoughtfulness, Serena thanked him and accompanied him and Mr. Su to the elevator. 

While waiting, Duan suddenly pulled her into an embrace, disregarding their surroundings.

In a hushed tone, he whispered in her ear, “Serena, your scent today is quite special, and I really like it!”
