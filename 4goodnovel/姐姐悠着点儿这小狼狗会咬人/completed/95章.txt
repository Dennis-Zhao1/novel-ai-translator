He Can't Leave

The two spent two excessively indulgent days on the small island. By the following evening, as they were packing up to return to Qianshui, they realized that Leo Sterling's passport was nowhere to be found. They turned the hotel room upside down, searching every nook and cranny. Time was running out.

Serena Zhou needed to return to Qianshui that night because she had to sign a crucial project the next day. Leo didn’t want to hold her back, so he reluctantly agreed to let her go alone. 

Serena reached out and gently squeezed Leo’s sad cheeks, offering comfort. "Leo, the scenery here is so beautiful. You should stay a few more days, especially since your vacation is coming up soon..."

Leo wrapped his arms tightly around her, his heart aching. "But I want you to stay with me..."

Serena patted his hand reassuringly. "Next time I have a break, we'll come back together, okay? Be good..."

Serena's promises always had a magical effect on Leo. He held her close, kissing her multiple times, reluctant to see her go, before finally sending her off to the airport.

"Leo..." Just before entering the terminal, Serena suddenly turned around and confessed loudly, "I love you!"

With people bustling around them, Leo felt a bit shy. But remembering they were abroad, surrounded by faces that looked similar to theirs, he couldn’t help but respond loudly, "Serena, I love you too!"

In just a couple of days, Leo thought, he would get the travel documents sorted out and fly back. Then, during the winter break, he would pester Serena to let him intern at her company. This year for the New Year, he was determined to take her to meet his grandmother before heading to the Zhou family's reunion dinner.

After all, Ms. Meng had been granted bail after Ms. Meng's case was taken over again, with some favorable evidence provided. But until the Zhou family’s poisoning case was officially closed, Ms. Meng couldn’t leave Qianshui.

Things were looking up for Shangzhou, and the Zhou family seemed to be settling down too. Leo felt this was a good sign. Because as long as Shangzhou thrived, the Zhou family thrived, and Serena could thrive. If Serena was doing well, then he too could be happy.

With Shengyu and his aunt by his side, Leo believed Shangzhou would only get better, and Serena would too. And indeed, during the second half of the year, Serena's busy schedule seemed to gain more significance. 

Firstly, Shangzhou's business was improving, with several projects that had once been on the brink of failure being revitalized. The company was financially secure, and Serena's personal worth was skyrocketing. She even ranked first in Qianshui's Young Entrepreneurs selection at the end of the year.

Secondly, those who had previously oppressed the Zhou family or Serena were starting to run into misfortune one by one. Take the Duan family and Duan Kangyu, for example. Although Duan Kangyu was no longer employed at Donglou, he was still its actual controller. However, this year had been particularly unlucky for Donglou; their stocks almost plummeted below their issue price, with a flurry of rumors and gossip flying around, some seemingly true, others not.

Rumors about accounting fraud, tax evasion, bribery, and shady bidding practices were rampant. Although Donglou had always had a strong public relations team, the wave of accusations that began with Jiang Jiang suing Duan Kangyu had dragged on for nearly a year.

Initially, the rumors were about Duan Kangyu's personal conduct. But once he stepped down from Donglou, the rumors shifted to the company and the Duan family. At first, Donglou could manage to squash the rumors easily. But as time went on, it became impossible to suppress them. 

With each new revelation, government agencies started to intervene. Taxation, fire safety, commerce... After nearly a year of investigations, no matter how deep Donglou's roots were, they couldn't withstand the pressure.

Duan Kangyu was aware of the critical point, but maintaining relationships with the city government was challenging, while severing those ties was much easier. 

In the end, when Duan Kangyu found himself in dire straits and sought out Sheng He, threatening her to take care of Serena, the time for Serena's revenge was finally at hand. But this time, when Duan Kangyu approached Sheng He, it was a little too late. She had already been replaced during the internal power struggle at Shengyu Group and had retreated.

However, Sheng He's network of connections still remained. In fact, her strength didn’t lie in having been the president of Shengyu Group, but rather in her surname, Sheng. Duan Kangyu understood what the Sheng name represented, so he clung to Sheng He like a lifeline.

Overwhelmed by the pressure, Sheng He finally sought out General Sheng. She was filled with emotions regarding her forced retirement due to the internal turmoil within Shengyu. She knew very well that Sheng Yuan was the real head of the Sheng family. 

Currently, the person in charge of Shengyu was a cousin of Lin Su, who wouldn’t have stood a chance against Sheng He without Sheng Yuan's backing. Sheng He had already approached Sheng Yuan about this matter. However, before she could even question him, she was met with a series of damning evidence laid out on Sheng Yuan's desk, detailing her past misdeeds.

Sheng He tried to explain and beg for mercy, but facing such overwhelming evidence, all her eloquence fell flat. The truth was undeniable. Sheng He had been greedy, using illegal means to amass wealth, and Sheng Yuan could accept that. 

But her involvement in aiding Song Weiming in committing murder and the threat of evidence against him was a different matter entirely. This could potentially drag the entire Sheng family down with her. Sheng Yuan couldn’t just sit by and let that happen. 

Without hesitation, he removed Sheng He from her position as president of Shengyu Group. When she later confronted him regarding the evidence linking Song Weiming to the murder of Shang Xuehai and the arson against the Zhou family, Sheng Yuan wasted no time in telling her to leave the country for her own safety. 

"Go abroad and take a break..." Sheng Yuan said nonchalantly. "Come back once I’ve sorted everything out!"

"What about Weiming? Can he come with me?" 

Sheng Yuan’s expression remained calm. "He can’t leave..."

"Brother, even though Weiming and I have long since grown apart, going our separate ways, he is still my husband, the son-in-law of the Sheng family, and the father of Huan Zhou. You can't—" 

Sheng Yuan’s gaze turned sharp as he coldly admonished her, "Precisely because he is Huan Zhou's father, he can't leave. Huan Zhou has a bright future ahead of him, and he cannot have a murderer as his father..."

"If that scoundrel from Donglou, Duan, decides to recklessly expose all the dirty secrets you both have, Huan Zhou's future will be ruined, and the Sheng family will be finished..."

"You selfishly consider only yourselves, and now that the fire is burning at your feet, you want to save yourselves? If you weren’t my sister..." 

The implication of his unfinished sentence sent a chill down Sheng He’s spine. She knew there was nothing she could do at that moment, but she still bit her lip and couldn’t help but ask, "What will happen to Weiming?"

Sheng Yuan ignored her question and simply said, "If you’re worried about being bored overseas, you can bring that little assistant of yours along!"

Sheng He had been having a secret affair with her assistant for some time now. Sheng Yuan had never cared before, but now he brought it up so openly...

With a heart full of sorrow, Sheng He stifled a sob, shot a cold glare at Sheng Yuan, and turned to leave his office. Obediently, she took her assistant and flew abroad.
