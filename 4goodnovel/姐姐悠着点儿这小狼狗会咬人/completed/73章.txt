**I Found You a Helper**

Serena Zhou's eyes glimmered with curiosity. She understood that the more indifferent she acted about certain things, the more Leo Sterling would care.

“Well, about our household registration...” 

Leo responded, “Let’s just leave it with my sister. If I keep it, I’ll be staring at it all day, and who knows? One day, I might just impulsively take you to get the marriage certificate.”

Serena chuckled softly, not pushing back. “Alright then, I’ll hold onto it for now. I’ll take the chance to swap out my burned household registration page when I have time.”

“When we get the certificate… it's best to use a brand new, flawless page,” Leo said, pulling Serena into a tight embrace. “Sister, I can hardly wait for the New Year to come so I can bring you back home…”

“Me too!” 

The warm and beautiful future always made one eager. However, Serena had her worries. “But… what if your family doesn’t like me?”

Leo didn't expect Serena to share the same insecurities that many brides feel about meeting their in-laws. He comforted her, “You’re so wonderful; how could my family not like you? And even if they didn’t, it wouldn’t matter. You’re the one I want to spend my life with. My love for you is enough!”

Serena felt a rush of emotion and replied with an enthusiastic “Mm,” filled with energy. “I’ll try to resolve my current issues quickly, then we can go back together for the New Year…”

Leo couldn’t bear the thought of his wife being this stressed and tired. “I’ve arranged for a helper for you. Duan Kanyu will assist you with the Eastern Tower Group matters so you can sort things out faster…”

“A helper?” Serena asked, puzzled. “Who?”

“You know him. He’s coming to see you at Shangzhou tomorrow!” 

Leo brushed back the stray hair from Serena’s forehead and reassured her, “Don’t worry, you’re the one I, Leo Sterling, have chosen. I just want us to have a beautiful life together. Anyone who dares to get in our way, I’ll deal with!”

His tone was light, but Serena could feel a fierce determination behind it.

She smiled, “You can relax too, Leo. In my heart and eyes, there’s only you. I will work hard for our future!”

Leo playfully tapped Serena’s cute, chubby nose and gently corrected her, “Since it’s our future, we should tackle it together!”

Serena nodded in agreement, and the two shared a sweet smile before embracing, happily drifting into dreams.

The next morning, as soon as Serena arrived at Shangzhou, Leo’s helper showed up.

Sister Dai walked in with Lu Yan, leading him right to Serena’s office. 

Although Serena was somewhat prepared, she feigned surprise. “Mr. Lu?!”

She quickly stood up to greet him, “Please, have a seat!”

Lu Yan, calm and collected, sat down and exchanged a few pleasantries with Serena before getting straight to the point. “Miss Zhou, to be honest, I’m here at the request of Master Sterling to assist you. Starting today, you can direct me as you wish.”

Serena’s eyes widened in shock. “Mr. Lu is joking! How could I possibly direct you? And by Master Sterling… you mean?”

Lu Yan smiled lightly, stating frankly, “I’m referring to Master Sterling, your boyfriend.”

Serena raised an eyebrow in surprise. “Mr. Lu knows my boyfriend…”

Lu Yan nodded. “Your boyfriend is the only son of General Sheng from the Qingheng Sheng family and the nephew of the president of Shengyu Group. Naturally, he is also my boss!”

“Leo is Mr. Lu’s boss? Then Tianxing Capital…”

Lu Yan interjected, “The actual controller of Tianxing Capital is Leo.”

Serena narrowed her eyes slightly. “So, the investment in the Zhucheng project was also…”

Lu Yan affirmed with a nod, “Of course, it was at Master Sterling's behest. Otherwise, why would I leave Qingheng City for this place?!”

Serena felt dazed. She wanted to express her astonishment at Leo’s prominent background, but in front of the seasoned Lu Yan, any pretense would be too obvious. So, she gave up.

Lu Yan continued, “So what do you need me to do next? Should I go directly to Duan Kanyu to discuss matters, or…?”

In Lu Yan's view, if he represented Leo to the Duan family, Duan Kanyu wouldn’t be able to refuse to reconcile, regardless of his feelings. 

That would be the best outcome; as long as Duan Kanyu didn’t obstruct them in the future, there was no need to crush him completely.

Serena bit her lip. “I’m still a bit… confused. I’ll need some time, please…”

Lu Yan was somewhat surprised. He thought Serena would have some plans in mind. It was hard to believe she truly knew nothing about Leo’s identity.

After a moment of consideration, he agreed, “That’s fine. After all, Master Sterling only said to settle things before the New Year, and there’s still over a month, which is plenty of time.”

Lu Yan stood up and politely excused himself, “Then I’ll let you get back to work. If you need anything, just have your secretary call me…”

He kept his tone respectful.

Serena smiled and nodded, then politely escorted him to the elevator.

Leo really knew how to pick a helper for her…

Returning to her office, she had just handled a couple of urgent tasks when Sister Dai knocked and entered. “Duan Kanyu’s mother went to your home early this morning.”

“My grandfather is there; he knows how to handle it,” Serena said, her fingers flying over the keyboard as she asked without looking up, “Where’s Duan Kanyu? Did he go to find Pei Zhuang?”

Sister Dai shook her head, hesitating to speak. “No, he went to Qian University. I’m not sure if…”

Serena paused, surprised that Duan Kanyu would go to Qian University. 

She quickly grabbed her phone to call Leo but found it unanswered.

Damn it. 

Did Duan Kanyu know about Leo’s identity and her plans, and was he trying to cut her off?

Serena had been wondering why Duan Kanyu hadn’t contacted her yet. Even if he was leaving behind the mess from their wedding ruined by the accidental fire for his mother and grandfather to handle, he should have reached out regarding Tang Ying’s arrest.

She had seriously underestimated him.

Serena hadn’t expected Duan Kanyu to bypass her and go directly to her backer.

Unable to sit still, she thought for a moment and texted Jiang Jiang: Return immediately.

Originally, she wanted to give Duan Kanyu some face, but now she couldn’t afford to delay.

She absolutely couldn’t let Duan Kanyu thwart her plans.

All morning, Serena felt restless, waiting for Leo to return her call.

At lunchtime, Leo finally called back.

“Sister, did you call me earlier?”

Leo’s voice was clear and bright, like the carefree sunlight of April, warming her from the inside out.

Hearing Leo’s voice eased Serena’s tense body, and she tentatively asked, “Were you in the lab this morning?”

“No, I was attending a seminar with the professor earlier.” 

Serena quickly caught on to the key point. “So you weren’t at school this morning?”

Leo replied, “No, I’m heading back now. By the way, Serena, have you met Lu Yan yet?”
