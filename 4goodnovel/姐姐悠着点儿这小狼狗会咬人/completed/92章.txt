**He Should Pay His Respects Too**

As soon as Lin Su left, Leo Sterling's expression remained unchanged. Serena Zhou and Adam Song exchanged frowns, sensing the weight of the moment. Leo noticed Lin Su sitting on the couch, gazing blankly at the rain after finishing her drink, and thoughtfully told Serena to take a break and sit down.

Serena was usually swamped with tasks, and Leo didn’t want her to have to help out at the Sterling family’s home. After a moment's hesitation, Serena obediently washed her hands and joined Lin Su in the living room.

Lin Su's attitude towards Serena was noticeably warmer this time. She asked about Serena’s work and life in detail. Though Serena wasn’t sure how curious Lin Su was about Leo’s life by the sea, she still tried to share parts related to him. She talked about the crops and flowers Leo had planted in his experimental fields on Qishan Mountain, their date at Fanyin Mountain that ended in an argument, and the embarrassing moment when she confessed her feelings to him in front of a beautiful landscape, only for Adam to overhear. 

She also recounted amusing stories Leo had shared about their college days, when students would chase after the chickens and pigs they raised to complete their thesis projects. Lin Su mostly listened, her smile growing as she heard Serena speak with such enthusiasm.

Their conversation seemed to brighten Lin Su’s mood, and before long, she suggested that Serena visit more often. Serena agreed with a polite smile, even though she knew deep down that such opportunities would be rare in the future.

When they sat down to eat dumplings, General Sterling came downstairs. His expression was not pleasant, but he maintained his usual authoritative demeanor in front of Leo, and no one seemed to notice his slight change in attitude. He was calm when facing Serena, which she took as a sign of their tacit understanding. After all, Adam’s brother-in-law was a murderer, and that was hardly a proud family matter. 

It was best to handle such sensitive issues discreetly. Serena cared only about the outcome and was indifferent to whether the process was exposed under the glaring sun or quietly concluded in the dark.

As they enjoyed their dumplings, Leo continued to show special care and attention to Serena, while Adam, the mood-maker, couldn’t help but tease them. He was met with a fierce glare from General Sterling, leaving him utterly confused. Not wanting to let the atmosphere turn awkward, he pretended not to notice the general's intimidating gaze and asked Leo, “By the way, when are you guys planning your wedding? I need at least two or three months' notice if I’m going to take time off…”

Leo naturally hoped it would be soon, but he knew Serena was extremely busy this year. Plus, Mrs. Meng was still in detention... He glanced at Serena, thought for a moment, and said, “We haven’t set a date yet. Don’t worry; as soon as we do, you’ll be the first to know!”

Adam was puzzled by why such an outstanding guy like Leo would choose to marry young, especially since Serena, in his opinion, was just average. But then again, as a gay man, he acknowledged that his taste in women might not be the best gauge.

“I’ll make it clear: I’m not being your best man…” Adam declared.

Leo replied calmly, “Your looks aren’t up to par for that role, so don’t worry…”

Adam, feeling insulted, tossed his chopsticks onto the table and shouted, “What’s wrong with my looks? Don’t think you can look down on me just because you’re handsome! Let’s settle this with a fistfight!”

He flexed his arms, showing off his impressive biceps, which Leo knew he couldn’t compete with. Leo didn’t even glance at Adam’s muscular arms and said blandly, “If you’re just looking for trouble, you’ll be washing the dishes later…”

Adam was taken aback by the retort, “You’re dreaming…”

The two of them exchanged playful banter that livened up the dining atmosphere considerably. Even Lin Su couldn’t help but smile at Adam’s flustered reaction. However, General Sterling still wore a stern expression.

After the meal, the rain had stopped. Leo didn’t want to linger at the Sterling residence; he just wanted to take Serena to visit his grandmother. But Adam advised against it, suggesting they stay at the Sterling home for the night since the roads might be slippery, and head out in the morning instead.

After taking a phone call, Serena informed them that she had to rush to Hengxue because her grandfather was missing… 

Leo immediately insisted on going with her. Adam also chimed in, expressing a desire to help if he could. Serena thought for a moment but didn’t refuse. So the three of them hurriedly left the Sterling home and made their way to Hengxue.

Upon arriving in Hengxue, the staff under Zhou Yunfang informed them that the old man had already been found, but they couldn’t persuade him to come back. Serena frowned and led Leo and Adam to the Linhai Cemetery, where her parents were buried. Their death anniversary was just two days away.

When they reached her parents’ gravestone, they saw her grandfather sitting alone before her father’s grave, holding a bottle of liquor. The staff under Zhou Yunfang stood nearby, as they had been instructed not to approach.

Serena glanced at Leo and Adam and said, “You two can head back to the hotel for now. I want to spend some time with my grandfather and my parents…”

Adam didn’t mind, but Leo said, “Serena, I’d like to meet your grandfather and pay my respects to your parents. Is that okay?”

Serena considered it for a moment, “Alright, but please wait for me to talk to my grandfather first; it’s getting dark…”

Leo nodded, and as Serena walked toward her grandfather, he quickly pulled Adam along down the hill. This visit had come up so suddenly that he hadn’t prepared anything. He could always bring a gift for her grandfather later, but it wouldn’t be right to visit Serena’s parents empty-handed. At the very least, he should bring a bouquet of flowers.

By the time Leo bought the flowers and returned to the cemetery, Serena’s grandfather had already been persuaded by her to get back in the car. He appeared to have drunk quite a bit, his face flushed and his eyes red.

Leo and Adam approached to greet him. Serena introduced them, “Grandpa, this is my boyfriend Leo Sterling, and this is his cousin Adam Song…”

Zhou Yunfang seemed a bit tipsy; he didn’t react much to Leo but instead focused his gaze on Adam, mumbling, “Oh, you—you both, hello!”

Noticing this, Leo frowned slightly, wondering if her grandfather might prefer Adam over him as a potential son-in-law. 

“Little Leo, I’ll take you to meet my parents…” Serena said, intending to take the bouquet from Adam’s hands and lead Leo to pay their respects. 

However, her grandfather pointed at Adam and said, “Take him to meet your parents too; he should pay his respects as well!”
