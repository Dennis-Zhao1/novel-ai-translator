**I’ve Decided to Get Married**

Serena Zhou feigned dissatisfaction, "How can you say that? If you go ahead and do that, then I’ll really need to reconsider that whole business of stealing the household register..."

The two of them tangled together, reluctant to part, indulging in sweet moments for quite a while before Serena finally had to get out of the car and head home. 

Dai Jie was waiting nearby at the intersection. 

Seeing Serena still in her wedding dress, Dai Jie offered her phone while saying, "I have some clothes in the car; let me get them for you..."

"No need," Serena replied, taking the phone and starting to check her messages and missed calls. 

As expected, Duan Kangyu hadn’t started throwing a fit yet. 

Duan Kangyu was certainly much more powerful and composed than those from the business school, like Hai and Ruzhen. 

Noticing Serena was focused on replying to her messages, Dai Jie quickly helped her lift the hem of the wedding dress. 

"Miss Zhou, Madam Duan still doesn’t know about Tang Ying’s arrest; should we...?"

While responding to her messages, Serena answered, "No rush; it’s not time for her to find out yet..."

Walking in those high heels was truly uncomfortable. She bent down, took them off, and tossed them straight into a trash can by the roadside before heading home barefoot. 

As she passed the charred remains of the house that had burned down before, she paused. 

Grandpa Zhou had said that the burnt house contained many memories of him and Grandma Jing. 

It was the first house he bought after founding the Zhou Corporation, using his first earnings, making it exceptionally meaningful. 

Although the house hadn’t been completely destroyed, Grandpa Zhou had still decided to demolish it and rebuild it exactly the same. 

However, Serena had been too busy lately, so nearly all the rebuilding matters had been taken over by Duan Kangyu. 

Now, the workers had begun pouring the new foundation. 

As for Duan Kangyu... 

Serena let out a cold smirk. If his schemes were laid with genuine feelings, they might have been worth savoring. 

Unfortunately, he was rotten to the core... 

Once home, Serena changed out of her wedding dress before going to see Grandpa Zhou. 

Grandpa Zhou Yunfang sat as usual behind his solid nanmu desk, his expression serious, his gaze sharp. 

"Grandpa," Serena called out obediently, lowering her head, looking dejected, waiting for his scolding. 

"So, you know I’m your grandfather..." 

This familiar opening line made Serena lower her head even more. 

In front of Zhou Yunfang, she had always been obedient. 

Although she was his little granddaughter, she never dared to act spoiled or put on a show in front of him. 

Whether she had made a mistake or not, she had to present a good attitude of acknowledging her faults first. 

"…Now tell me, what’s up with Tang Ying? And what happened at the hotel? About your marriage to Duan Kangyu... Did you never plan to get married from the start?" 

Serena slowly raised her head. It turned out her grandfather wasn’t oblivious. 

"Grandpa, you’re well-informed; you even know about Tang Ying’s arrest?" 

"What, do you think your grandfather is deaf and blind now? Hmph, I know Tang Ying is your doing. Is it because of your brother?" 

Serena nodded honestly, "Yes, Tang Ying tampered with my brother’s car, causing him to have an accident. I have evidence in hand. If it weren’t for her hiding abroad, I would have sent her to prison long ago..." 

Tang Ying had been living it up abroad for a year. 

She claimed it was because Zhou Jingchen had broken off their engagement and that he had become a vegetable due to an accident, which devastated her, so she went abroad to recuperate. 

But in reality, she was hiding because she knew her crimes might be exposed. 

Zhou Yunfang narrowed his eyes, "You have evidence? What kind of evidence?" 

"I have solid evidence." 

"Such as?" 

"Such as the recording of Tang Ying inciting people to bribe Xia Xiuhe..." 

A look of disgust appeared on Zhou Yunfang’s face as he sternly said, "Don’t mention that name in front of me!" 

Serena lowered her gaze. 

Zhou Yunfang fell silent for a moment before saying, "This matter isn’t that simple. The Duan family has significant power. Tang Ying is currently only detained; Duan Kangyu has countless ways to get her out. If you act rashly, you’ll be completely at odds with the Duan family. That’s not a wise move..." 

Serena lifted her gaze and calmly looked at Zhou Yunfang, sincerely asking, "Grandpa, what do you think Duan Kangyu will do first?" 

Zhou Yunfang pondered for a moment, "He will definitely try to contact Pei Zhuang first..." 

Duan Kangyu would first seal off the news and then find a way to rescue Tang Ying. 

Serena confidently said, "Pei Zhuang won’t cover for her!" 

"How can you be so sure?" 

"I’ve sent gifts to him and his brother twice..." 

Zhou Yunfang’s eyes widened in shock. "You... Did you get those things from the Qianai Club?" 

Zhou Yunfang slammed his hand on the table, standing up, pointing at Serena as he scolded her, "Serena Zhou, how dare you! Are you planning to use the little things in your hand to shake the foundations of the Qianai? You’ve offended so many people; aren’t you afraid of being dealt with when they turn around?!" 

Serena frowned slightly, taking a step back, calmly saying, "Grandpa, you don’t need to worry. Pei Zhuang values his reputation; for now, he won’t act against me. As for Duan Kangyu..." 

A cold glint flashed in Serena's eyes, "…he’s done so many evil deeds; it’s about time he faced his retribution!" 

Zhou Yunfang knew that Serena had acted first and sent Tang Ying to prison. 

At this point, even if they rescued Tang Ying, the feud between Serena and the Duan family was already set in stone. 

After contemplating, Zhou Yunfang sat back down and asked in a low voice, "What are your plans moving forward?" 

Serena smiled playfully and replied earnestly, "I’ve decided to get married. Grandpa, my household register wasn’t burned in the last fire, right?" 

Zhou Yunfang was taken aback. "You want to get married?" 

Serena nodded seriously and then placed the household register of Leo Sterling in front of Zhou Yunfang on the desk. 

"Yes, I want to marry this person..." 

Zhou Yunfang thought Serena was joking at first, but when she pulled out a household register and handed it over, he was taken aback. 

Zhou Yunfang didn’t know what kind of trick Serena was playing this time. 

He picked up the household register from the desk, opened it, and at a glance, his expression changed drastically. 

"You..." 

Zhou Yunfang slammed the household register down on the table, his eyes wide as he stared at Serena, momentarily unsure if he was more excited or angry. His lips trembled as he urgently said, "…You want to marry someone from the Sheng family? Are you...?" 

Serena didn’t like playing guessing games; they were family after all, and she decided to be straightforward. 

"Yes, Grandpa, I know all about your past romantic escapades..." 

For once, a hint of embarrassment flickered across Zhou Yunfang's face. He avoided her gaze and said softly, "Then, why do you still..." 

Serena’s gaze turned cold, her brows knitting tightly, "I thought I should give you a heads-up in advance to avoid shocking you later!" 

Zhou Yunfang indeed looked as if he had been startled. 

He leaned back in his chair and silently stared at Serena for a long time, not saying a word.
