You Want to See Who Every Day?

The tumultuous events began after Leo Sterling took over as president of the Shengyu Group, ousting his cousin, Lily Sheng, and whisking her beloved assistant off to a foreign country. All this unfolded shortly after Serena Zhou had taken Leo on a vacation to a small island.

Leo had initially lost his passport on the island and thought he could spend a few days obtaining a travel certificate to return home. However, after dropping Serena off at the hotel, he returned to find all his luggage missing. Aside from his phone, every possession he owned had been stolen.

He reported the theft, and the police quickly got involved, but they made little progress in catching the thief. The hotel allowed him to stay for free, but Leo was low on cash, and the island didn’t support electronic payments. 

While money wasn’t the main issue, the real problem lay in the fact that his laptop contained his research papers and crucial experimental data. He had to get it back.

The local police were notoriously inefficient. After waiting for a week to no avail, Leo reluctantly called Ethan Lu, who promptly arranged for someone to help. But being abroad was different from being at home; their contacts could only work slowly to navigate local relationships.

When the local team struggled to make headway, Ethan decided to personally travel to the island. After spending a fortune and navigating through numerous connections, he finally managed to retrieve Leo's laptop nearly a month later, along with his missing passport. With that, Leo was able to return home.

However, upon his return, he received devastating news: his uncle, William Song, had died in a car accident, and the funeral was set for just two days later. His aunt, Lily Sheng, had stepped down from her position at the Shengyu Group and left for abroad. She only returned the day before the funeral.

Though Leo had flown back to Qianhai, he didn’t manage to see Serena. His calls went unanswered, and with the sudden nature of William's passing, he sent her a text explaining his situation before heading back to Qingheng.

During his time stranded on the island, Leo had not frequently contacted Serena. To avoid worrying her, he downplayed his misfortunes, simply mentioning he had found some interesting plants to study.

Serena, not suspicious at all, even encouraged him to explore nearby islands and countries, suggesting he might discover more fascinating plants.

After attending William's funeral, Leo returned to Qianhai as the New Year approached. Typically, Serena was swamped with work during this time, but Leo missed her deeply. So, as soon as he landed, he headed straight to the office.

To his surprise, when he arrived at the office, his colleague, Daisy, greeted him with an expression of shock. “Leo, are you looking for Serena? She’s already left for the day…”

Leo glanced at the clock; it was only 6:30 PM. Serena rarely left before 7 PM. Confused, he turned to Daisy, “She’s gone? I’ll just give her a call…”

But again, there was no answer, and his previous message had gone unanswered too. A sense of unease began to creep in.

“Daisy, do you know where Serena went?” 

Daisy hesitated, her brow furrowed. After a moment, she reluctantly said, “This afternoon, she asked me to book a table at a Japanese restaurant…”

Daisy urged him nervously, “Leo, if you see her there, please don’t mention that I told you…”

Daisy’s anxious demeanor only amplified Leo’s unease. He thanked her, saying, “I understand. Thank you, Daisy,” before heading to the Japanese restaurant.

It was right next to Qianhai University, and as Leo stepped inside, he realized it was the same place he and Serena had visited for the first time together.

He reserved a table and asked the waiter for the restroom's location, using the opportunity to wander through the dimly lit restaurant.

To his shock, he spotted Serena sitting at the same table they had shared over a year ago, laughing and playfully chatting with… Yang Yang, who was feeding her a piece of sashimi!

In that moment, Leo felt as if he had been struck by lightning, frozen in place. A chill ran from his toes to the top of his head. The scene was so surreal that it momentarily stripped him of his anger.

He moved forward, step by agonizing step, trying to confirm if the woman leaning forward, her chin resting in her hands, laughing flirtatiously with another man was indeed Serena.

As he got closer, he overheard Yang Yang asking her, “So when are you finally going to dump Leo and make it official with me?”

Serena lovingly pinched Yang Yang’s handsome face, just as she used to do with him. With a playful smile, she replied, “Not yet, even though I’m tired of him. He’s the son of General Sheng; I can’t afford to offend him. I’ve been ignoring him for quite a while…”

“I’m sure he’ll get tired of waiting and find someone else soon. I promise, once we’re together, I’ll help you land an internship at the company…”

Serena gazed at Yang Yang with infatuation. “Little Yang Yang, I wish I could see you every day…”

“Who do you want to see every day?”

Before Yang Yang could respond, Leo had stepped out of the shadows and arrived at their table. His gaze was as cold as ice, his tall frame casting a dark shadow over Serena. His fists clenched, radiating a furious chill.

Serena looked up, her expression shifting as she saw Leo’s face. Panic coursed through her, and she stood up, momentarily at a loss for words. She forced a smile, trying to ease the tension, “Leo, you… you’re back?”

At that moment, Serena's attempt at a charming smile felt like a slap to Leo’s face. He pointed at Yang Yang, glaring at Serena, his voice cold as ice. “Serena Zhou, what’s going on between you two? I want an explanation…”

Serena’s face paled as she glanced at Yang Yang, her eyes darting around, “I… I…”

Before she could finish, Yang Yang interrupted, standing up and confidently taking over the conversation. “Leo, Serena and I… it’s exactly how you see it, just like you imagined!”

Yang Yang moved around Leo to wrap his arm around Serena’s shoulders, grinning smugly at him. “Serena’s with me now. You’ve been sidelined. So, be smart and walk away quietly. No need to make a scene; it would only embarrass everyone involved!”

Leo's icy glare shifted slowly from Serena’s face to Yang Yang’s. The next moment, he suddenly raised his fist and brutally swung it toward Yang Yang’s smug, annoying face.
