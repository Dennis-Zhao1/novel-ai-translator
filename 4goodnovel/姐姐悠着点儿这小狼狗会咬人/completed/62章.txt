**I Only Want You**

Leo Sterling furrowed his brow, "So does that mean you can't stay over at my place anymore?"

Serena Zhou hesitated for a moment, then replied honestly, "Before I marry Dan Kangyu, my grandfather strictly forbids me from staying out overnight..."

Leo squinted in surprise, "You're getting married to Dan Kangyu?"

Serena looked directly at Leo, her expression serious. "I won't marry him; we just set a wedding date..."

Leo stepped back a little, confused. "I don't really understand..."

Serena didn't want any misunderstandings between Leo and Dan Kangyu. She nestled into Leo's embrace, explaining, "I told you before that I’m waiting for someone to return. That person is Tang Ying, Dan Kangyu's niece. Once she’s back, I can end things with Dan Kangyu..."

"But she just went abroad, and I think she won’t come back easily unless it’s for something serious in the family. Both Dan Kangyu and Grandma Dan are in good health, and I’m not patient enough to wait for either of them to pass away. So, I have to do my best to push forward with this marriage to Dan Kangyu..."

Leo still looked puzzled. "What does your situation with Dan Kangyu have to do with Tang Ying?"

Serena corrected him, "It’s not about me and Dan Kangyu; it’s about Tang Ying... Anyway, you can rest assured, I won’t marry Dan Kangyu. I only want you. As long as I have you, no other man in this world will catch my eye!"

Talking about plans always felt dull. Serena wanted to share some sweet nothings with Leo and enjoy their time together. Leo, too, wished nothing more than to whisper sweetly into her ear every day.

He held Serena tightly in his arms, speaking with deep affection, "I only want you, Sis. Just thinking about you makes it hard for me to control my feelings..."

Leo pressed down gently on Serena's slim waist, his voice low, "I really don’t want to let you go home tonight!"

Serena felt the same reluctance to leave, yet she had promised Dan Kangyu that she would cut ties with Leo. 

With a hint of sadness, Serena said, "Little Leo, I have so much going on right now. I don’t even know when I’ll see you next. You have to wait for me patiently, okay?"

Her words were sincere; she genuinely didn’t want to part ways with Leo. Unfortunately, many things were beyond her control.

Leo's demeanor was gentle and understanding. "I know. I’ll try not to disturb you and will wait for you at home. But you have to return my calls and texts, or at least allow me to see you occasionally. You have no idea how much I've missed you this past month!"

He buried his head in Serena's shoulder, inhaling her sweet scent deeply. 

That fragrance brought him comfort.

Serena responded with a soft "Mm," and earnestly added, "I’ll do my best to answer your calls and reply to your messages..."

Leo joyfully cupped Serena's face and kissed her again and again. 

That was all he needed!

Leo thought that he and Serena had a long future ahead of them. Some things couldn't be rushed; they had to take it slow and steady.

Serena had skipped the engagement with Dan Kangyu and headed straight for marriage. The date was set by Grandpa Zhou and Madam Dan for New Year’s Day. The remaining details of the wedding were to be discussed between Madam Dan and Mrs. Meng.

Dan Kangyu also took charge of certain aspects of the wedding, while Serena was busy with official business. Only after reclaiming her share of the family business did she truly take the reins of the Zhou family.

Many projects that had been stalled by the interference of Shang Ruzhen and the business factions could now advance rapidly under Serena's leadership.

Although the fire incident at the Zhou family home had turned into a cold case after over a month of police investigation, Dan Kangyu took it upon himself to help Serena clear up the aftermath in order to lift his own suspicions.

He bought the old Shang family mansion, claiming it was a gift for Serena to vent her anger.

"Jing Shu, if it makes you happy, feel free to set it ablaze!" 

Serena looked at Dan Kangyu with a "Are you out of your mind?" expression. "I won’t waste money!"

The Shang family mansion was worth much more than the Zhou family home that had burned down. However, when Dan Kangyu insisted on gifting it to Serena and had the documents brought to her for signing, Serena had Aunt Dai hold off for quite a while before finally rejecting it close to the wedding date with Dan Kangyu.

"I don't want the Shang family mansion..."

After the wedding date was set, Dan Kangyu's attitude toward Serena underwent a complete 180-degree shift. Serena often dared to give him the cold shoulder.

Following the Zhou family's tragic fire, Serena sternly proposed to Dan Kangyu that they annul the engagement.

She had thought he would be eager to agree, but he surprisingly did not.

Serena was straightforward, "Uncle Dan, I'm really busy. I don’t have time to play these foolish games with you. If you like me, let’s get married. If not, and you’re looking to settle scores from the Zhou family with Sister Yingying, then let’s do this properly..."

The fire at the Zhou family home seemed to have completely changed Serena's demeanor. 

In front of Dan Kangyu, she was no longer timid or submissive. 

Her once-confused eyes were now clear and sharp.

Dan Kangyu realized that some of his previous actions had been excessive. For instance, using her palm as an ashtray while drunk, or pulling her in front of him as a shield during a fight, causing her hand to get scratched. He had even attempted to frame her for a murder linked to Shang Ruyan, trying to manipulate her completely.

Yet despite all that, Dan Kangyu believed that the seemingly fragile and inexperienced Serena wouldn’t dare to distance herself from him, let alone propose to break their engagement.

So when Serena asked him to come forward and confront her seriously, he felt an unreal sense of disbelief. 

Dan Kangyu narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing Serena with intensity, and asked in a low voice, "Are you serious?"

Serena frowned, responding coldly, "Uncle Dan, you’ve helped the Zhou family a lot, and I’m grateful for that. I’ve come across some interesting things from the Shallow Love Club that you might be interested in. I’ll have someone send them over to you right away..."

The Shallow Love Club was a place managed by Shang Xuehai and Shang Ruzhen, meant to entertain various high-profile figures from Shallow Sea. 

Gu Yiyi and Qin Lili were particularly effective in this line of work, organizing a group of attractive men and women specifically to serve those influential individuals. 

Though it appeared they were merely running an escort service, in reality, they were professional actors who had left countless impressions on various people.

Shang Xuehai had used these connections to pave his way and make a fortune. 

Originally, those items had been stored in the basement of the Shallow Love Club. If not for Qin Lili realizing she had offended Yan Jiajia and fearing the club might be shut down, she would not have hurriedly moved those items.

Serena wouldn’t have had the chance to intercept such a disgusting cache of discs.
