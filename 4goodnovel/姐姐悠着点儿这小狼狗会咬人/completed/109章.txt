**Farmers and Their Bond**

Just as the conversation reached a turning point, Serena Zhou suddenly blinked, feeling an unexpected wave of discomfort wash over her. She had indeed been contemplating how she would obediently "repay" him no matter what he asked. However, she hadn’t anticipated him to utter those two words: "Get married?"

“How… how do we get married?” she stammered, desperately trying to regain her composure, but her heart was racing, and her body instinctively leaned back a little.

Seeing her reaction, Leo Sterling let out a soft, almost mocking chuckle. “How do we get married? It’s simple. We take your household registration book and mine, head to the civil affairs bureau, fill out an application form, take a registration photo, and get a little red book. Just like that, we’re married…”

He had thoroughly researched the process before, sitting outside the hotel where she and Duan Kangyu were preparing to tie the knot. He remembered handing his household registration book to her, confessing his love, and expressing his desire to obtain a marriage certificate together. 

Serena was the woman he had decided to spend his life with. This conviction hadn’t wavered for even a moment until he had so bluntly blurted out the word "marriage" just now.

“…What about the repayment? Are you brave enough? Are you scared?” Leo’s gaze was fixed on Serena, intent on capturing every flicker of emotion on her face.

Serena admitted, in that moment, she was indeed flustered and confused. She hadn’t expected Leo to be so straightforward, even though it was a desire she had quietly harbored in her heart. But she knew that the two of them getting married… it felt like an insurmountable challenge!

“Not scared? Afraid?” Leo pressed, noticing the way Serena froze, her expression momentarily blank as she struggled to respond. “Is it because of General Song…”

The mention of General Song made Serena’s brows furrow, and she quickly denied it. “No, it’s not because of him…”

“Then what is it? You don’t like me?” Leo’s voice took on a challenging tone.

Serena shook her head vehemently. “I like you, I like you so much it’s driving me crazy…”

Leo blinked in surprise, the coldness in his eyes momentarily melting as he bit down on his teeth. “Then why?”

Since she adored him to the point of madness… although he could easily pick up on her feelings from the way she looked at him, hearing her say it out loud made his heart quiver.

“Because of Song Weiming…”

Since Leo had come here to find her, Serena didn’t want to hide her feelings anymore. They should give each other a chance to explore this. It was a hurdle; if they could get over it…

“Song Weiming is dead!” Leo said coldly. “What else can he affect?”

Even though Song Weiming was his uncle and Serena had only approached him because of him, the events of the past six months had already tormented him enough. He couldn’t change the past, but he didn’t want to be shackled by it forever.

Serena narrowed her eyes, her expression turning sharp and cold. She spoke softly, “Oh, is Song Weiming really dead?”

Upon hearing her words, Leo suddenly felt his grip on the camera in his hand falter. 

“Leo, I really like you. I was genuinely moved by your proposal just now, and I want to agree to it. But once I do, you’ll definitely guess what the outcome will be…”

Leo clenched his jaw, his face rigid as he asked each word carefully, “What… will it be?”

“I will marry you, have children, and then make another deal with General Song. I will personally kill Song Weiming, and I will stir up trouble for the Song family, potentially ruining you completely…”

Although she had indeed considered such a plan when she believed Song Weiming might still be alive, it was born from her fury. If it weren’t for Zhou Jingchen suddenly waking up, she would’ve plotted to win Leo back without stopping until they reached the point of marriage and children!

If Sheng Yuan dared to play with her, she would make him pay the price!

During that time, she had been in a terrible mental state. Zhou Jingchen thought she was just heartbroken… which was true, but what truly devastated her was that Sheng Yuan had actually betrayed her trust. 

Song Weiming had indeed been in a car accident, but he hadn’t died. He had merely lost a leg. 

When Serena discovered this, she was still wary, fearing that Song Weiming would come looking for her. However, Sheng Yuan would not allow him to make a public appearance again. 

Serena had investigated and found that Song Weiming was being closely guarded by the Song family. It would be too difficult to find someone to take action against him. She couldn’t risk exposing this situation when she had already offended Leo; the backlash from Sheng Yuan against the Zhou family would be catastrophic.

“Then why don’t you do it?” Leo swayed slightly, believing that Serena was capable of following through on her words.

If she were to turn back to him, he believed he would undoubtedly follow her lead again. When he learned that Song Weiming was still alive, he had contemplated whether to reveal this information to Serena. Perhaps if she knew, she would return to him, seeking him out again.

But how could he bear to let her know that all her careful planning and efforts would ultimately lead to nothing?

“Maybe it’s because I’m not ruthless enough or insane enough…” Serena gazed into the distance, her eyes becoming distant and clear.

“…After my parents were murdered, I only had one goal: to avenge them. For that, I would sacrifice everything. But my parents… I think they wouldn’t want me to live as a monster who disregards everything for revenge. As for Song Weiming…”

“I only want him to survive for a little longer. If I can come to terms with everything and let go during this time of peace, it would be best if he naturally passed away…”

“If not, one day when my kindness runs out, I might resort to any means necessary to take his life…”

Serena’s gaze landed on Leo’s face as she spoke plainly. “This is my most genuine thought at the moment…”

Leo furrowed his brows, believing he understood. Her words seemed to speak about Song Weiming, yet they also reflected their own situation.

“So as long as Song Weiming is alive, there’s no possibility for us?”

“Not at all…”

The coldness on Serena’s face softened a little. “I still owe you; I will definitely repay that. If you want to get married, then let’s get married. However, I must remind you that if I repay you and have to face… those things and people I don’t want to deal with every day, I will ensure that General Song fulfills his promises that he failed to keep…”

Leo bit down on his lips, unable to respond. 

Serena smiled softly. “Leo, this is why I must leave Qianhai. I don’t want to destroy everything with my own hands…”

Her departure from Qianhai wasn’t a retreat but rather an opportunity for everyone to have a wide-open path. She wasn’t afraid of Leo or the Song family; she simply didn’t want to be mired in power struggles for a lifetime.

After all, if she had a knife in her hand, she would undoubtedly use it against Song Weiming without hesitation.

Leo had once been a pawn in her game, a tool to help her achieve her goals… now he had become someone she couldn’t hurt or didn’t want to hurt anymore. If she struck at Song Weiming again, it would inevitably harm him, and potentially the entire Song family…

Song Weiming had already caused the death of her parents. She couldn’t allow him to use her hatred to hurt more people.

So, until she found a solution that worked for both sides, she chose to set it aside for now.

“What about later? Will you never return to Qianhai? Are you going to grow old and die here?”

Serena’s statement left Leo in a state of turmoil, his mind a tangled mess. 

“I don’t know what will happen in the future, but I currently have no plans to leave here and go back to Qianhai…”

“What about us?”

That was the question Leo truly wanted to ask. What was to become of them?

“We…” Serena’s eyes darted around, “…depends on you!”

“Depends on me?” Leo echoed, slightly taken aback.

“You want me to give up everything and stay here to live like a pair of farmers?” 

“Isn’t that good?”

In truth, Serena felt uncomfortable about Leo dropping out of school. For her, he had given up his dreams and chosen to return to the Song family to take over Shengyu. The world of business, filled with deceit and superficiality, was not suited for him. 

Over the past six months, watching him flounder aimlessly, she felt worried for both the Song family and the executives of Shengyu. 

If he continued to muddle through like this, the Song family might collapse before the Zhou family did!

Was this his form of revenge against Sheng Yuan? It felt so childish, naïve, yet somehow… endearingly cute!

Leo huffed in annoyance, turning away awkwardly. “I’m worth billions now; how could I possibly…”

Serena interrupted him with a light laugh. “Oh, by the way, Dr. Leo, I have a question. Why aren’t my peanuts plump and full?”

“How would I know?”

“You’re an agriculture PhD, and you don’t know this?”

Serena stood up and walked over to him, pointing to a patch of ground. “See that area? They flower a lot, but they hardly produce any peanuts…”

As she spoke, she reached for his hand. 

The first time, he pulled away… 

Then she reached for him again.

He pulled away once more…

And she reached again…

Still, he resisted…

Hey! 

Serena pouted, annoyed. She decided to tiptoe and cup his face, kissing him thoroughly, leaving him dazed…

This time, he finally complied, letting her drag him along to see the patch of peanuts she had planted.
