**Chapter 1: Crossroads of the Heart**

"What do you mean by that, Leo?" 

Serena Zhou stared at Leo Sterling, her heart racing in a way that she couldn’t explain. The intensity of his presence seemed to linger, a heavy weight that pressed against her chest. 

“Why does he have to be so persistent?” she thought, frustration mixing with an undeniable attraction. No matter how hard she tried to convince herself otherwise, she couldn’t shake the memories of Leo. Each time she attempted to move forward, the shadow of their past would creep back in.

Rationalizing her feelings was a futile endeavor. She and Leo were done—over. If she conformed to the pressures of reality and practicality, then Fu Nanchuan would be a suitable match. She should at least consider dating him—he was stable, reliable. Yet, the memory of Fu’s dismissive words about being a “future daughter-in-law” stung, and her thoughts wandered back to Leo every time she sat across from Fu. 

Even during their light-hearted conversations, one wrong word from Fu could trigger memories of moments shared with Leo, leading her down a path of nostalgia and heartache, like being poisoned by a curse. Sometimes, Serena felt like she wanted to open her own head and extract the parts that remembered Leo, burying them deep where they could no longer haunt her.

With a heavy sigh, she rejected Fu’s invitation for dinner, informing him that she would be turning off her phone after leaving Qianhai. She needed time alone—a quiet escape from everything.

“Are you going to Hengxue?” Fu asked, concern lacing his voice.

Serena couldn’t bring herself to lie, so she answered honestly, “No.”

“Then where are you going?” 

“Sorry, I don’t want to say.”

There was a long silence before he pressed again, “Will you come back?”

That question made her freeze. 

“I will… but I don’t know when,” she finally replied.

“What do you mean? You’re not planning to return this year?”

“Yeah,” she confirmed softly.

“Is it because of Leo?” Fu’s voice tightened. 

Fu and Leo had only crossed paths a few times in public, yet there was an unspoken tension between them that Serena could sense.

“It’s not about Leo; it’s my own issue. There’s nothing left for me in Qianhai.” 

Staying in one place, doing the same things—it all needed to be for something. But now, Serena felt like she had nothing left she wanted. 

That wasn’t entirely true. Deep down, there were things she still yearned for, but she didn’t know if she could obtain them again, or how to reach for them, especially since they were things she had once given up so easily.

Fu’s confusion was evident. “Serena, Qianhai has your family, your friends… are you willing to give that up?”

“I won’t give up my family and friends…” she started, but the truth was, she was leaving for them. 

While she believed Leo wouldn’t take out his frustrations on her loved ones, everyone in Qianhai was aware of his disdain for her. It wouldn’t take long for someone with ulterior motives to try and harm her family or friends to curry favor with Leo.

“Then just tell me where you’re going. If I come to find you…”

“Don’t,” Serena interrupted. “When I’m ready to come back, I will. Thank you for everything, Fu, but please, don’t worry about me anymore. I’m leaving now. Bye!” 

After hanging up, she switched off her phone and tossed the SIM card into the trash. 

Serena left with a resolute heart. She hadn’t shared her destination with anyone—not even Jiang Jiang, her closest friend. Before the incident with her brother, she had always been a lone wolf, navigating life independently. 

But this time, she needed solitude. 

The Zhou family wasn’t worried about her. The other interactions she had were merely business acquaintances—now severed since she had left the trade. 

As for Leo… she thought, if she left, they would finally have peace. 

The location wasn’t far; it was a rural area. She bought a house from a local farmer and rented several plots of land to cultivate. One for peas, another for fruits and vegetables, and a flower patch… 

The work was exhausting, but she found joy in it. Physically and mentally, she felt liberated, as if she were breaking free from chains that had bound her for too long. Perhaps in another life, she had been a farmer. 

Days passed in a monotonous rhythm, yet they flew by quickly. Watching the peas sprout, grow, and bloom into vibrant purple flowers brought her simple joy. Each time she gazed at the flourishing pea blossoms, a pang of regret washed over her. 

She and Leo had once dreamed of making memories in this very pea field, but that dream had slipped away before they could fulfill it. If only… 

A long sigh escaped her lips as the thought emerged, only to twist into anger and pain. After all, the distance between her and Leo had only grown. 

“Click…” 

Lost in her thoughts, Serena didn’t notice the sound of a camera shutter behind her until it broke the stillness of the air. 

Turning around, she froze, her breath catching in her throat. 

“Leo…?” 

Standing there in casual attire was the man she hadn’t seen in months. The sight of him was a shock, leaving her momentarily speechless. 

Leo didn’t respond to her; he simply raised his camera and snapped another photo of the blooming peas. 

Was this real? Was she dreaming? 

Rubbing her eyes, she blinked at him, still there, undeniably present. 

Then, she pinched her cheek. Ouch… 

It wasn’t a dream, nor an illusion. The real Leo stood before her, no longer the naive student she once knew, nor the polished business mogul he had become. Instead, he exuded a calm confidence that spoke of maturity beyond his years. 

“What’s with the ghostly expression? Am I that scary?” 

Leo lowered his camera, squinting at her with a hint of amusement. 

Regaining her composure, Serena countered, “What are you doing here?” 

“Is this some kind of forbidden zone? Are you the only one allowed here?” 

His tone dripped with irritation, and she felt a spark of confusion. 

“Then, Mr. Sterling…” 

Suddenly, words failed her. What could they even say to each other? 

With a sigh, she looked down, preparing to walk away, but he caught her arm, blocking her path. 

“Serena…” 

His gaze bore into hers, filled with unspoken emotions. 

“…you’ve been hiding for half a year; isn’t that enough?” 

Furrowing her brow, she ignored his question and asked, “What do you mean?” 

“I mean nothing. I just wonder if there’s anyone in this world more heartless than you. You said you were leaving the trade, and then you really vanished without a trace for over six months. I thought you…” 

The memory of the foolish things he had done in her absence surged, igniting frustration within him. Yet, seeing her safe before him also sparked a deeper, more painful ache. 

“You thought I was… dead?” 

Serena’s laughter was light, but it carried a weight of bitterness. 

“Did Mr. Sterling send someone to find me during my absence? What’s the matter?” 

What’s the matter? Leo clenched his teeth, staring at her with barely contained irritation. 

“Miss Zhou, you haven’t forgotten about the debt you owe me, have you?” 

She rolled her eyes, “I only owe you a debt of gratitude, Mr. Sterling. Are you sure you want me to repay it?” 

Leo remained silent, his jaw tight. 

Serena found the exchange dull—tedious. 

With another sigh, she asked, “What do you want from me? Just say it. Let’s skip the games…” 

Now, it was Leo’s turn to inquire, “What do you mean?” 

And so began a new chapter in their tangled story, where unspoken words and hidden desires would lead them down a path neither of them could foresee.
