**A World for Two**

Leo Sterling had been waiting for Serena Zhou's reply ever since he sent her a message. By the time midnight rolled around, he had already drifted off to sleep when his phone rang.

“Leo! Are you asleep yet? Quickly grab your passport and ID and come down! We're going on vacation…” 

Still groggy, Leo initially thought he was dreaming and replied absentmindedly, “Where to?”

Serena's voice was filled with excitement, “To a warm place! This winter has come way too early; it’s only November and it’s freezing! Hurry up and get downstairs; I'm waiting for you!”

Leo rubbed his eyes, glancing at the time on his phone—1 AM. Who in their right mind would go on vacation at this hour?

Frowning, he asked, “Vacations… do you even have time off?”

“Of course! You have no idea how hard I’ve worked these past few months to clear this holiday! No more chit-chat, just grab your things and come down!” 

With that, Serena hung up.

Leo stumbled to the bathroom and splashed cold water on his face, staring at his reflection in the mirror. He was still half-asleep and couldn't fathom why Serena was reacting so strongly to his simple invitation. All he wanted was for her to realize he had an undeniable charm that kept other girls interested, to stir a little jealousy and make her pay more attention to him. 

But here she was, dragging him off for a… vacation? In the dead of winter?

Leo couldn't quite wrap his head around Serena's thoughts anymore. But not wanting her to wait too long, he hurriedly gathered his passport and ID, packed a suitcase, and dashed downstairs, still feeling a bit dazed.

True to her word, Serena was waiting outside. The moment she saw him, she rushed into his arms, exclaiming, “Leo! I've missed you so much…” 

As always, her warmth enveloped him. Leo pulled her close, burying his face in her neck, inhaling the sweet fragrance that had been absent from his life for nearly a month. 

Once they settled into the car, Leo finally remembered to ask, “So, where exactly are we going?”

Serena flashed him a mysterious smile. “To a place you’re definitely going to love. You'll find out when we get there…”

She snuggled against him, yawning softly. “Leo, I’m so tired. I’ll sleep for a bit and you can wake me when we get to the airport…”

“Sure,” he replied, adjusting his position to make her more comfortable.

By the time they reached the airport, Serena was nearly asleep on her feet, leaning heavily against him, her eyes barely open. 

Once they boarded the plane, she was out like a light, lost in a deep slumber. 

When she finally woke up, the plane was just touching down. After a series of transfers by car and boat, they arrived at their destination four hours later.

It was a secluded little island, completely cut off from the rest of the world, with only one boat coming in and out each day.

“Why did you choose such a remote place for a vacation?” Leo asked in confusion.

Serena stretched her arms wide, reveling in the breathtaking view of the azure sky and crystal-clear sea before them. “Because it’s warm here, and I don’t want anyone or anything disturbing our world for two…”

With that, she wrapped her arms around Leo's neck, tiptoed up, and kissed him deeply.

Her kiss was passionate and focused. “Leo, you can’t escape now. I’m going to make sure you can’t get out of bed while we’re here…”

Leo chuckled at her brazen words. “You’re quite bold!”

He pulled her closer, leaning down to whisper in her ear, “Let’s see who ends up not getting out of bed…”

“Here, you can be loud without being shy; after all, no one here understands our language…” 

Serena winked playfully, “Leo, I think I want to do it with you right here, in the water, on the beach, in the treehouse…”

She licked her lips and playfully nibbled on his chin, provoking a warm rush of affection in Leo.

“Alright, I’ll make sure to satisfy you…” 

Though their eyes locked, both filled with desire, it was still broad daylight, and public decency prevailed. They decided to first enjoy a hearty meal and settle in before exploring their more intimate urges.

Despite its small size, the tropical island boasted plenty of entertainment options. Serena was sure Leo would never get bored here.

Later, in their hotel room, Leo pushed her playfully into the bathtub, whispering, “As long as you’re here, I’ll never tire of this…”

Serena, caught in the moment, squirmed under him yet still flirted back. “I’m not worried about you getting bored; I’m worried you might run out of steam…”

To prove his vigor, Leo intensified his actions, insisting, “With all this fresh seafood here, I won't tire easily. You should be more concerned about yourself…”

After a long night of playful antics, Leo finally remembered to ask, “By the way, Serena, how many days off do you have?”

She lay languidly in his arms, looking a bit dazed as she mumbled, “Two days…”

Leo raised an eyebrow in disbelief, “Just two days?!”

“Yeah, just two…”

“Then why go through all this trouble to come here? I wish I’d known…”

Serena, still half-asleep, murmured, “I’m not letting you participate in that beauty pageant award show. You getting all those votes just from a photo? If those girls see you in person, they’ll do everything they can to steal you away…”

Leo couldn’t help but smile. His original intention for entering that boring contest was to see how Serena would react. Initially disappointed by her nonchalant response, he now felt a surge of happiness.

Serena’s reactions were always beyond his expectations, and he was utterly captivated by the surprises she brought into his life.

“Got it, I won’t go to that award show. But does that mean we have to head back tonight?”

Serena didn’t respond, and when Leo looked down, he noticed she had fallen asleep, breathing softly against him.

She looked so peaceful and adorable, like a little cat, and he couldn’t resist the urge to kiss her.

Leaning down, he pressed a gentle kiss on her forehead, wishing she wasn’t so exhausted.

As his thoughts began to race again, Leo pondered if he should be so fixated on his dreams. Perhaps he should focus on creating a reality for the person he loved.
