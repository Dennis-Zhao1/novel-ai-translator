**Meeting the Parents**

Leo Sterling's charm was intoxicating, and Serena Zhou found herself swept away by emotions she struggled to contain.

“Leo, let’s head to the lounge…” she suggested, her voice a mix of eagerness and anticipation.

With a playful smile, Leo responded, “Sure!” Then, without hesitation, he swept her into his arms and carried her into the cozy lounge area.

As the New Year approached, Serena had arranged for her grandfather to visit Hongxue. Deep down, she had hoped that Mrs. Meng could join them, but Mrs. Meng was too worried about her son, who refused to go. Thus, Serena had to go along with it.

Serena couldn't shake the feeling that Duan Kangyu's parting words—"We still don't know who will ultimately hold this bowl of prison food"—held a deeper meaning. While she couldn't decipher it, the remark filled her with unease. 

Even though Leo had assured her that he would return to Tianxing after the New Year, as he needed to prepare everything to take her back with him, Serena remained apprehensive.

On the afternoon of the twenty-ninth day of the lunar year, Serena and Leo traveled to Qingheng City together. Though she was typically bold, the closer they got to the Sterling family home, the more her nerves began to unravel. 

In moments of tension, she often teased Leo or playfully nudged him, wanting to ignite a spark of laughter between them. But upon landing, a driver sent by the Sterling family was waiting to pick them up.

Determined to appear poised and elegant, Serena sat in the backseat, maintaining a dignified composure. Leo couldn’t help but chuckle at her serious demeanor. 

He squeezed her hand reassuringly, saying, “It’s okay, sis. You can relax a bit. I’ve already told my parents about you…”

Serena's eyes widened in surprise. “And what did you tell them about me?”

Her reaction delighted Leo, who laughed softly but felt a pang of concern for her. Serena usually exuded confidence and grace, but now she seemed shy and reserved. Did this mean she truly valued this meeting and cared for him?

“What I said isn’t as important as the fact that I made it clear you’re the one I love and the person I see as my future partner. I trust that no matter who you are, they will respect you,” Leo reassured her.

“I’ve mentioned before that my parents have never been overly strict with me. They respect all my decisions, so I’m sure they won’t interfere with my choice of lifelong partner.”

Serena was curious about Leo’s relationship with his parents, noting that he rarely initiated contact with them. Instead, he seemed to communicate most with his grandmother, calling her nearly every day, along with occasional chats with his aunt and cousin.

While she wanted to ask more about his family, she held back, opting for, “Your parents are quite open-minded. That makes me a bit less anxious. But even if they’re accepting of my background…” she paused, linking her arm with Leo’s, “…I hope I can make a good impression and that they truly recognize me, rather than accepting me just because of you.”

Leo leaned in and placed a gentle kiss on her forehead, offering comfort. “Don’t worry. My parents have discerning eyes; they will see your worth and embrace you wholeheartedly. Just be yourself and relax!”

As they exchanged light conversation, Serena gradually felt her tension dissipate. The car wound its way along the twisting mountain roads before finally stopping in front of a traditional courtyard shrouded by bamboo groves.

“We’re here,” Leo announced, taking her hand as they stepped out. A few staff members approached to greet them and help with their luggage.

Leo acknowledged them with a polite nod, then turned to Serena. “These are the family drivers and housekeepers; they’ve been here for years. I rarely come home, so I’m not very familiar with everyone.”

Serena noticed that the staff greeted Leo with a mix of warmth and formality, which piqued her curiosity about how his parents would receive him.

As expected, when Leo held Serena's hand and guided her through the winding corridors to the living room, where three elders sat chatting on the sofa, his demeanor shifted. When he called out “Dad” and “Mom,” his tone was calm and neutral, but there was a hint of excitement when he addressed his aunt.

“This is my girlfriend, Serena Zhou. Serena, this is my dad, my mom, and my aunt. Please say hello!”

Serena stood up straight, offering a gentle smile as she greeted them softly, “Hello, Uncle and Aunt, and Mr. Sterling!”

Mr. Sterling and Mrs. Lin looked up, acknowledging her with polite nods and smiles. “Hello, welcome. It’s a long journey; please, have a seat!” they replied, their tone warm yet formal.

However, Mrs. Sheng rose enthusiastically to greet her. “Hello, Miss Zhou! I’m Sheng He. We’ve met before… Welcome to our home, please sit down!”

Serena recalled that they had dined together during a business trip to Shallow Sea, where she was still engaged to Duan Kangyu. Now, less than six months later, she was Leo's official girlfriend, brought home with all seriousness.

Mrs. Sheng was clearly curious and impressed by Serena. She warmly took Serena’s hand, guiding her to the sofa, while Leo sat beside her.

During their conversation, Mr. Sterling and Mrs. Lin asked Serena a few straightforward questions—her age, her family background, and her plans with Leo. The exchanges felt casual, almost like small talk, and despite Mr. Sterling not being as intimidating as she had imagined and Mrs. Lin being quite approachable, Serena answered each question obediently and honestly.

When the topic turned to her future with Leo, they exchanged a glance, and Serena replied shyly, “I’ll follow Leo’s lead.”

Leo smiled brightly, gripping her hand tightly. 

Mr. Sterling then said, “As long as you two are serious, we won’t interfere with your choices. Just focus on building a life together in Shallow Sea. However, if you have children, feel free to bring them back here. We’d be more than happy to help raise them!”

The abrupt shift in conversation left Serena momentarily speechless. She hadn’t expected Leo’s parents to be so accommodating, just as he had described. She realized that she hadn’t even felt like she had faced any real tests yet, and here Mr. Sterling was, granting a sort of approval for her and Leo's future together—talking about children already?

It felt odd to her that all they needed to do was live their lives in Shallow Sea… something about that left her feeling unsettled.
