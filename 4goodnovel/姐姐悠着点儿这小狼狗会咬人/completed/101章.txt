**Compared to Hatred, I Love Him More**

When Ethan Zhou woke up, his family was overjoyed. He himself was eager to be discharged from the hospital and return home. Unfortunately, he had suffered severe leg injuries and had been bedridden for two whole years. The rehabilitation process was slow and could not be rushed; everything had to progress step by step.

After Ethan regained consciousness, his sister, Serena Zhou, and their mother, Mrs. Meng, practically lived in the hospital to keep him company. Meanwhile, Serena had to continue her tireless work. When Ethan had his accident, Serena had stepped in to manage the company, facing immense difficulties and challenges. While they had managed to eliminate the biggest internal problem, the external competition was still fierce.

A new and powerful adversary was looming on the horizon: the Shengyu Group, which had recently changed its leadership. Originally, the Shengyu Group was headquartered in Qingheng, and its branch in Qianhai had not been particularly influential. But now, they were planning to move their headquarters to Qianhai. This decision would undoubtedly have a significant impact on the current business landscape of the area.

Serena was acutely aware that Shengyu's move was aimed directly at their company, Sheng Zhou. Since that day, she had wanted to have a proper conversation with Leo Sterling, the new head of Shengyu. Her thoughts were somewhat muddled during their last encounter, and she regretted not having been more composed. Unfortunately, after that day, Leo had left school, returned to Qingheng, and taken over Shengyu. Since then, he hadn’t made any effort to reach out to her.

So, Serena decided to liberate Leo’s contact information from her blacklist. During that time, he had called her numerous times, left many messages, and sent various texts. The messages still remained unread. Serena didn't dare to listen, knowing that pursuing it would lead to nothing but frustration. She had enough worries already and didn’t want to trap herself in the cage of emotions.

"When did you learn to smoke?" 

One day after work, Serena visited Ethan in the hospital. As soon as she sat down, Ethan frowned. She turned her head to sniff her sleeve but detected no scent. Before entering the ward, she had popped a couple of mint candies and left her jacket in the car, thinking she wouldn’t smell like smoke. However...

Feeling embarrassed, she replied, "Ethan, how is your sense of smell so sharp now?"

Ignoring her playful tone, Ethan spoke seriously, "Serena, I've been wanting to have a good talk with you since I woke up, but Grandpa and Mom have been glued to my side, leaving me no time to chat with you..."

Serena straightened up, her expression turning serious, "What do you want to say?"

Ethan took a deep breath, "I've heard a lot since I woke up. I know it’s been tough for you to hold up Sheng Zhou and the Zhou family alone these past two years, and I want to thank you for that..."

Serena gave a nonchalant smile, "We're family; there's no need for thanks..."

Ethan paused, "Yes, we’re family, and we shouldn’t be apart. So... I want to discuss something with you and hear your thoughts..."

"Just say it, Ethan."

"I hope you can drop all the charges against Summer Xiuhe..."

Serena narrowed her eyes in disbelief, "You want to let Summer go? Why? Do you still... have feelings for him?"

Ethan nodded honestly, his expression tinged with helplessness. "Serena, I can’t let go of him. Since waking up, my mind has been filled with memories of our time together. I think he’s the reason I fought to wake up; I wanted to see him, to say I’m sorry. That’s why I struggled to come back..."

"Even though he tricked me into losing most of my fortune and caused my accident, leaving me in this hospital for two years..."

"But ultimately, it was my fault first. I shouldn’t have been thinking about exploiting my marriage with Tang Ying while I was with him..."

Ethan sighed, "In the end, this is just my punishment!"

His words left Serena deeply troubled. 

"He’s been abroad for two years; I can only imagine how much he wants to come home. Serena, please, just drop the charges, okay?"

Ethan spoke in a tone that was almost pleading.

But Serena couldn’t refuse, even though she felt disgust towards Summer Xiuhe. After all, she had kept him under surveillance, uncertain about how to handle him.

"Fine, I’ll have someone withdraw the case tomorrow. But..."

Serena cautiously probed, "...Ethan, do you still want to reconcile with him?"

"That question..." Ethan chuckled ruefully, "...is not for me to answer, but for him. If he’s willing to come back... But I doubt he would want to be with me again!"

Ethan had lived with Summer for over a year; how could he not understand his feelings?

Serena was taken aback by how vulnerable her usually esteemed brother was in matters of the heart. 

"Ethan, after everything he’s done to you, you don’t hate him or resent him?"

"Of course, I do feel hate and resentment, but after staring death in the face, I know what truly matters to me. Compared to resentment, I love him more..."

Ethan’s eyes shone with an intense, unbreakable affection.

Serena was deeply shaken, momentarily at a loss for words.

"Enough about me and Summer. Let’s talk about you, Serena..."

"Me?" Serena replied coolly, "I don’t have much to say. It’s just work, socializing, and more work..."

"Have you not been dating anyone?"

Ethan pressed his lips together, wondering if she had been in a relationship. She had had one once, but it wasn’t worth revisiting. After all, it was over now, and the love she had given in that relationship was neither intense nor pure.

"I heard from Mom that you were dating a college student named Leo Sterling, and that you were planning to get married?"

At the mention of "Leo," Serena felt an urge to lash out. Instinctively, her hand reached for her pocket to grab her cigarettes and lighter. But looking at Ethan in his hospital gown, she reluctantly withdrew her hand.

"I did date Leo Sterling, but we’ve broken up now..."

Serena had no desire to discuss him or that relationship. She quickly shifted the topic, "Ethan, how does your leg feel now? Can you walk a few steps?"

Ethan looked at Serena with concern but didn’t follow her lead to change the subject.

"Serena, don’t dodge the topic. You dated the son of General Sheng, the current president of Shengyu Group. You must have known his identity from the start, so that’s why you chose to date him, right?"

Ethan’s question wasn’t sharp, nor was his tone harsh. In fact, his voice was almost gentle. But Serena felt as though she had been slapped in the face.

With each breath, it felt as if the air was igniting around her, causing her face to flush uncomfortably, as if she were coming down with a fever.

"I know a lot has happened while I was unconscious for two years. I also know you’re smart and capable, and that Sheng Zhou has flourished under your leadership. But I had no idea you could push the business to the brink of collapse, with Tang’s family almost ruined, Duan Kangyu committing suicide, and Tang Ying in prison, along with Song Weiming..."

Ethan could hardly believe that Serena had managed to handle all these challenging situations so efficiently in just two years. His sister was indeed someone to be reckoned with.

"...In the face of such dangerous situations, it’s understandable that you would choose a shortcut, but have you considered that this Leo Sterling might be more dangerous for Sheng Zhou than any of those people?"
