This Man is Quite Attractive

"This man is quite attractive..."

Before losing consciousness, Serena Zhou gazed at the young man who had dragged her out of the car and was now holding her, sprinting forward. 

She couldn't help but marvel to herself at how handsome he looked, his strong arms gripping her firmly. She could even feel the hard muscles of his biceps curving beneath her. If she survived this ordeal, she was determined to win him over!

“Miss, hang in there. Don't fall asleep. The ambulance will be here soon…” 

His voice was deep and clean, soothing to her ears. Blood flowed down Serena's face, yet she felt no pain at all. 

She stared intently at the handsome face hovering above her, a satisfied smile breaking through her distress. The young man carried her onto the main road, and it wasn’t long before the ambulance arrived. 

Serena was placed onto the stretcher inside the ambulance, and she felt the lovely face she had been admiring begin to withdraw from her view. 

She instinctively reached out, grabbing the hem of his shirt, her voice hoarse with desperation. “Please, don’t go…”

“What?” 

The young man leaned in, bringing his ear close to Serena's lips. He carried a faint scent, reminiscent of summer sunshine—fresh and pure. The aroma was comforting, making Serena feel at ease as her consciousness began to slip away.

In that moment, all her usual composure vanished, leaving only the urge to pour out her heart before it was too late. 

“Hey, handsome, what’s your name? You... are so good-looking, exactly my type. If I... if I survive this, would you... would you be with me?” 

The young man froze, his expression a mix of surprise and confusion, which only added to his attractiveness. Unfortunately, Serena didn’t have the chance to appreciate his looks any longer before she succumbed to darkness.

When she finally regained consciousness, Serena found herself in a hospital room, alone. The handsome guy was nowhere in sight, and the large room felt empty without him. 

After three days in the hospital, Serena was discharged and returned home. As soon as she stepped through the door, her grandfather summoned her into his study for a lengthy three-hour talk.

When she finally emerged from her grandfather's study, she wiped the sweat from her forehead, pondering whether it had been too soon for her to leave the hospital. Her head throbbed, and her right arm, still in a cast, ached painfully.

However, pressing matters loomed, and she had no time to rest. 

At the Shang Zhou Group, in the president's office, as soon as Serena walked in, her secretary, Miss Dai, entered behind her, clutching a large stack of documents. 

“President Zhou, these documents need your signature urgently. Could you take a look?” 

Miss Dai laid the papers out before Serena, who quickly scanned them, clumsily signing with her left hand. 

As she signed, Miss Dai began to inform her of upcoming meetings and work schedules. It was already three in the afternoon, but Serena still had three major meetings, two video conferences, and appointments with two board members and a supplier to attend to. 

Although there had been plans for dinner that evening, Miss Dai thoughtfully canceled them, knowing Serena had just been discharged from the hospital.

After a busy afternoon, by evening, Serena finally found a moment of peace. As soon as she had a break, the handsome face from earlier jumped to the forefront of her mind.

It was then she remembered to ask Miss Dai, “Miss Dai, how did the investigation into that person I asked about go? And have you gathered the gifts I requested?”

Miss Dai nodded. “All done.”

She handed over two pages of information to Serena. “Here’s the information you wanted, and the gifts are already in the trunk of your car!”

“Thank you, Miss Dai. You’ve worked hard. You can head home!” 

Once Miss Dai left, Serena delved into the documents before her. 

“Leo Sterling, 21 years old, graduate student at Oceanview University, majoring in Agriculture, from Qingheng City, height 6'2”, weight 154 lbs…”

Leo... what a nice name. His height and weight were right in line with Serena's ideal. The only downside was his age—21, three years younger than her. Still, despite being a bit younger, he was undoubtedly a fresh young man, and she imagined he would be quite tasty to pursue…

Setting the documents aside, she pulled a mint from her pocket to freshen up, then stood and left the office. 

According to the information, Leo didn’t live on campus, but his class schedule indicated he had a class that night. Serena calculated when he would finish and had the driver take her to Oceanview University’s main entrance. 

After waiting for nearly twenty minutes, she finally spotted that handsome face among the groups of students heading outside. 

As her awareness cleared, Serena realized just how striking Leo truly was. Not only was his face attractive, but his body was also perfectly proportioned. With broad shoulders, a slim waist, and long legs, he wore a simple white T-shirt and jeans yet exuded an ethereal charm—clean and elegant, the epitome of an ideal man.

She had to make him hers.

As Leo approached, Serena steadied her fluttering heart, mustering a soft, graceful smile as she elegantly greeted him. “Hi!”

Leo, distracted by his phone, looked up at the sound of her voice. His fair, handsome face wore a detached expression. 

“Who are you?” he asked, his brow slightly furrowed, a mix of wariness and surprise evident in his gaze.

That cool, assessing look sent Serena’s heart racing.
