“Carry me,” Serena Zhou said, her voice direct and calm, yet it sent a rush of warmth to Leo Sterling's cheeks. He turned his head slightly to hide the awkwardness in his eyes and affectionately rubbed the bridge of her nose, chuckling, “Sister, how can you be so thick-skinned? Saying something so straightforward without even blushing!”

“What’s there to be embarrassed about? What really makes one blush and their heart race…” Serena wrapped her arms around Leo’s neck, her breath warm against his ear as she whispered, “…is what I want to ask you for!”

Serena nestled herself into Leo's embrace, her petite frame fitting perfectly against him. He was mindful of her injury, worried she might lose her balance, and instinctively wrapped his arms around her waist. In that moment, Leo truly understood the meaning of “being enveloped by gentle warmth and soft jade.”

“So, about that…” Leo leaned down to gaze tenderly at Serena, his voice soft, “...what plans do you have, sister?”

Serena pondered for a moment, licking her red lips, her voice a teasing whisper, “Plans… you should stay tonight so we can discuss it properly!”

Serena’s eagerness was infectious, and Leo couldn't help but laugh. He playfully bumped his forehead against hers, gently saying, “The thing you’re thinking about… let’s wait until your injuries heal. We’ll pick a sunny day, find a beautiful spot… and then we can do it!”

“Does that mean we have to wait a long time?!” she pouted.

“If you’re in a hurry, then focus on recovering. And please, no more injuries. I refuse to be intimate with a woman who isn’t in good health!” Leo replied with a grin.

Serena rolled her eyes. “My injuries are nothing serious; they won’t affect anything. Besides, it’s you who’ll be doing all the work, not me…” She emphasized, almost playfully, “...you should take better care of your own body!”

Leo raised an eyebrow, feigning annoyance. “Do you want me to show you my perfect six-pack abs?”

With that, he made a move as if to lift his shirt. Serena giggled softly at his antics, continuing to tease him, “It’s not just about strength; it also depends on…”

“Depends on what?” Leo felt his own cheeks warming under her playful gaze.

“What do you think?” she responded, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

Leo leaned down and gently pecked her lips, his eyes bright with promise. “No rush; you’ll see it sooner or later.”

The two of them embraced, their foreheads touching for a moment longer. Eventually, Leo checked the time and realized it was getting late. He reluctantly steered the conversation back to reality.

“I don’t feel comfortable leaving you here alone tonight. Let me take you home!”

Serena was reluctant to let go, but since she had work in the morning, she finally said, “You don’t have to take me. I called Old Lin to pick me up. You can just drive my car back; the keys are…”

She bent down to pick up the car keys and handed them to Leo, but hesitated midway, biting her lip in indecision. Carefully watching Leo’s expression, she finally added, “…you should drive it so it’ll be convenient for us to go on dates in the future!”

Leo hesitated for a moment but eventually accepted the keys. “Alright!” It was their first day as a couple, and he didn’t want to argue over anything.

“Then I’ll carry you down!” he declared.

Serena shook her head. “I don’t want to be carried; I want you to give me a piggyback ride!”

With a resigned yet affectionate smile, Leo playfully pinched the bridge of her nose before lifting her onto his back, heading down to the parking garage.

Old Lin was indeed waiting for them, and upon seeing Leo carrying Serena down, he quickly opened the car door and turned away, giving them privacy. Serena climbed into the car, holding onto Leo's hand as if she couldn't bear to let go.

Once Leo settled into the passenger seat, they exchanged sweet nothings, stealing kisses and hugs, savoring every moment, until Leo finally stepped out of the car.

After Serena’s car drove away, Leo climbed into his own vehicle. Holding the keys, he found them strangely warm to the touch. He touched his lips with his fingers, unsure whether the heat he felt was emanating from his body or from the lingering memory of Serena.

Serena... Leo closed his eyes, wanting to take their relationship further, but knowing he had to plan carefully and not rush things.

Taking a deep breath, he dialed a number. As soon as it connected, he coldly said, “Find out everything you can about Qian Hai Dong Lou's Duan Kang Yu. The more detailed, the better!”

A voice on the other end acknowledged, “Understood.” 

“Don’t alert anyone else in my family!” Leo added before hanging up. 

He drove back to his apartment, where remnants of his earlier chaos remained scattered across the floor. As he picked up two broken pieces, trying to reassemble them, Serena called.

Seeing her name on the caller ID made him smile involuntarily. He walked into the study while answering the phone, sweetly conversing with Serena as he grabbed a blank sheet of paper and started doodling.

They chatted and flirted on the phone for nearly an hour before finally exchanging “goodnight” and hanging up.

Serena had the driver stop the car at a junction on Wangshan, slowly making her way back home while continuing to talk to Leo on the phone. Her toes ached, and what normally took fifteen minutes stretched into an hour due to her cautious pace.

By the time she reached home, she noticed the living room light was still on. Pushing the door open, she found Mrs. Meng still wearing her glasses, engrossed in selecting fabric samples.

Hearing the noise, Mrs. Meng looked up and briefly scanned Serena before returning to her task, saying coolly, “You’re back?”

“Mm,” Serena replied, moving toward the sofa, but Mrs. Meng raised her head again, this time with a piercing gaze that radiated anger.

Mrs. Meng’s eyes fixed on Serena’s bandaged toes, and she asked sharply, “What happened to your foot? Did it have something to do with Duan Kang Yu again?”

Exhausted, Serena sank onto the sofa, trying to appear nonchalant. “It’s nothing serious; just an accident…”

Mrs. Meng slammed her book shut with a “thud,” furious. “Another accident? How many times have there been in this past month? Do you want to end up like your brother, in a state where you can’t wake up again?”

After scolding Serena, Mrs. Meng began cursing Duan Kang Yu. “That scoundrel, I wish he’d hurry up and go to hell!”

Though Mrs. Meng had a fiery temper, her anger was fleeting, and her heart was not as harsh as her words suggested. Once she calmed down a bit, Serena gently asked, “Alright, I really am fine. Why are you still awake so late?”

Mrs. Meng huffed, “It’s your life; I can’t be bothered with you.”

Once her mood stabilized, she brought up the main topic. “Today, Duan Kang Yu’s mother came to visit. She brought a lot of good things to help you recover.”

Her disdain for Duan’s mother was evident. “She talked with your grandfather for over two hours and said she wants to bring Duan Kang Yu over for dinner this weekend. Make sure you come home early!”

Serena responded with a faint acknowledgment. 

Mrs. Meng added, “Your grandfather is still waiting for you in the study. Hurry up!”

“Okay. Don’t stay up too late; get some rest!” Serena got up and headed upstairs, suppressing the pain in her toes, trying to stand tall and gather her energy as she knocked on the study door.

“Come in!”
