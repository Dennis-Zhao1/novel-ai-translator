**Chapter Title: Mrs. Duan, I Demand You**

Duan Kangyu was not surprised that Zhou Jingshu had gone to such lengths to acquire items from the Shallow Love Club. On the contrary, he felt a strange sense of comfort in her attempts to barter these items with him. At the very least, it indicated that she no longer held anything of greater value against him. If she had, given her current cold demeanor, she would have likely kicked him to the curb long before now. Why wait until she had secured items from the club and finished dealing with the merchants just to bring up the dissolution of their engagement? 

If Zhou Jingshu really had other leverage, she could have easily used him as a sword to eliminate those merchants without breaking a sweat. If she were smart enough, she would know how to maximize the value of what she had…

Duan Kangyu had been watching Zhou Jingshu's struggles and endurance over the past six months. Therefore, he was nearly certain that the thing he feared most was not in her possession. However, being naturally cautious, he worried that her proposal to break off their engagement was merely a ruse. Playing hard to get might work on others, but he, Duan Kangyu, could see right through it.

He said coolly, "To me, those items may not hold much value. Jingshu, I do not agree to dissolve our engagement. Since I’ve publicly acknowledged you as my fiancée, I intend for you to be Mrs. Duan…"

Zhou Jingshu let out a scoff. "Please, Uncle Duan, spare me the pretense. I know you look down on me, and I’m well aware that you haven’t finished playing your pathetic games of humiliation. But I’m not interested in indulging you any longer. Those items…"

The cold disdain and contempt in her eyes were bright and unapologetic. 

"...whether they are useful to you is your business. This is all I can offer. Uncle Duan, I don’t want to ruin our relationship completely, but don’t push me too far!" 

With that, Zhou Jingshu turned on her heel and left, not giving Duan Kangyu a moment to process her reaction.

Back home, she immediately approached her grandfather Zhou to discuss the dissolution of their engagement. Zhou Yunfang cast a meaningful glance at Zhou Jingshu before calmly making a phone call to Duan Kangyu's mother to bring up the topic of breaking the engagement.

Confused, Duan Kangyu's mother visited the Zhou residence the following day. 

Zhou's grandfather sighed, "This child has never been close to me. Now that she has solidified her position in the Zhou family, she is even less inclined to listen to my nagging. Let’s just say this marriage isn’t meant to be…"

Although the Zhou family was nominally under Zhou Jingshu's control, everyone knew that the real power still lay with Zhou Yunfang. The fact that he agreed to call off the engagement was unexpected. 

Duan Kangyu thought maybe Zhou Jingshu truly wanted to sever ties with him. However, he was determined to have her, so he remained unruffled.

True to her word, Zhou Jingshu sent several video tapes to Duan Kangyu’s hands the very next day after discussing the engagement dissolution. He didn’t even have the slightest interest in glancing at them. Did she really think such paltry items could negotiate with him? How naïve!

After waiting a few more days, he watched idly as Zhou Jingshu clashed with the merchants, particularly the grandfather-grandson duo, and Yan Jiajun. Yan Jiajun was soon dismissed for investigation, while Shang Ruzhen fled to another city to escape debts, reuniting with Mu Tingyao, who had just found her child.

Meanwhile, Shang Xuehai was discovered hanging from a tree behind the Shang family estate on a stormy night.

From that moment on, the Shang family fell into disgrace, no longer able to compete with the Zhou family. 

During this time, Zhou Jingshu found herself plagued by insomnia. She felt as though she had initiated the chaos, but the unfolding events had spiraled far beyond her control. Yet, she knew she had no choice. The harsh reality was that if the Shang family didn’t fall, she could not hold onto the Zhou enterprise.

Zhou Jingshu didn’t care about being the president of the Shang Corporation; she simply needed it to serve her purpose. For that, she sacrificed much. Perhaps more losses awaited her in the future, but she didn’t mind.

In truth, she wasn't so busy that she couldn't spare a moment to call Sheng Tang or respond to his messages; she just lacked the motivation. Instead, she spent her free time at the hospital, keeping company with Zhou Jingshen, silently being there without saying much or doing anything.

One night, as Zhou Jingshu left the hospital, she ran into Yan Jiajia at the entrance. After several rounds of chemotherapy, Yan Jiajia had become emaciated and frail, like a flickering candle about to extinguish in the wind. Her gaze bore a venomous hatred toward Zhou Jingshu.

After all, it was Zhou Jingshu who had ruthlessly exposed Shang Ruzhen's infidelity right in front of her. Though Yan Jiajia might have suspected her husband’s affairs, if Zhou Jingshu hadn't revealed the truth, she might have continued to live in blissful ignorance.

Moreover, Zhou Jingshu didn’t expose these matters for Yan Jiajia’s sake; it was merely a means to an end.

Upon seeing Yan Jiajia, Zhou Jingshu instinctively braced herself, despite not believing that a terminally ill patient could pose any real threat to her. Just as she intended to walk past Yan Jiajia, the latter coldly remarked, "What, are you afraid I'll come after you for revenge after I die?"

Ignoring her, Zhou Jingshu strode past.

Suddenly, Yan Jiajia lunged, grabbing Zhou Jingshu's arm with surprising strength, making it impossible for her to break free.

Yan Jiajia’s voice grew frantic, "Jingshu, you can't treat me this way! I'm dying, and you can't be so cruel to someone who's about to leave this world! My precious Daodao is so young; she will be left without a mother! You can't let her lose her father and uncle too! You promised me that as long as I transferred the shares of the Shang Corporation to you, you wouldn't touch my brother! You broke your promise! Why did you go back on your word?"

As she spoke, Yan Jiajia suddenly erupted in manic laughter, seeming almost deranged. "…Zhou Jingshu, why did you break your promise? I believed in you! I thought you were a good person, but it turns out you’ve been deceiving and using me the whole time! How could your heart be so dark?"

Zhou Jingshu clenched her jaw tightly, frowning, refusing to answer Yan Jiajia’s accusations but firmly insisting, "Let go!"

Yet Yan Jiajia’s grip was too strong, and Zhou Jingshu couldn’t break free.

As the commotion attracted a crowd of onlookers, Zhou Jingshu, desperate to escape Yan Jiajia, was caught completely off guard when a knife suddenly aimed at her neck. 

The cold blade grazed dangerously close to her carotid artery.

But in the next moment, it fell straight to the ground, the fruit knife embedding itself in the grass before her.

"Shang Ruyan, how dare you touch my woman? You’re asking for death!"

Duan Kangyu appeared out of nowhere, executing a swift move that struck Shang Ruyan’s wrist, sending the knife clattering from her hand. He followed up with a powerful kick to her stomach, sending her crashing to the ground.

Shang Ruyan let out a pained cry, curling up on the ground, unable to rise.

The sudden turn of events stunned both Zhou Jingshu and Yan Jiajia.

Zhou Jingshu quickly regained her composure, forcefully shaking off Yan Jiajia's grip and rushing toward Duan Kangyu. 

But just as she called out "Uncle Duan," she turned to see Yan Jiajia picking up the fallen fruit knife, lunging it toward her…
