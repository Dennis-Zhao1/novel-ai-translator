**He’s My Boyfriend**

Serena Zhou pushed open the door to the study and respectfully stood beside the solid mahogany desk, calling out, “Grandpa!”

Zhou Yunfang glanced up at her, his brow slightly furrowed as he noticed the new wound on her foot. However, the topic at hand was entirely unrelated to her injury.

“…Without the East Tower Group’s guarantee, the loan from the Shallow Sea Bank won’t get approved, and the construction project will be in jeopardy. Serena, what do you plan to do about this?”

Serena hated discussing business matters with her grandfather in his study. Each time the conversation concluded, she felt a rush of anxiety and sweat. Even though he never raised his voice or scolded her, his sharp questions made her feel like she was already failing an exam that hadn’t even started.

“…I know that Duan Kangyu made some excessive demands and did some outrageous things to you, but right now, we need his support. If we want to turn things around, we have to think long-term…”

Regardless of what her grandfather said, Serena nodded obediently.

“…By the way, this year is the anniversary of your parents’ passing. I’ll go to Hengxue to pay my respects; you don’t need to come.”

Serena nodded in response, “Understood.”

“Don’t forget to come back early this weekend. Now, go get some rest!”

“Yes, Grandpa, you should also rest early!”

After leaving her grandfather’s study, Serena didn’t head straight to her room. Instead, she went downstairs to her brother’s room.

She moved quietly, taking a seat in the chair without waking the family doctor who was already resting outside.

Zhou Jingchen was her half-brother, nine years older than her. He had originally been the CEO of the Shangzhou Group, but after a car accident a year ago, he became a vegetable.

Reluctantly, Zhou Yunfang had called Serena back from Hengxue City.

Serena was an illegitimate child, having lost her parents at a young age. After their passing, she was taken in by the Zhou family.

As she looked at her brother, who lay peacefully asleep with a breathing machine, she took a mint candy from her pocket, popped it into her mouth, and gently held his hand. In the dark, her eyes glimmered with a cold brightness!

In some ways, she was just like any couple who had just started a relationship. Serena and Leo Sterling were deeply in love.

During the day, Serena was too busy; even with her injuries, she had social obligations at night. Leo, having fewer commitments in the evenings, often drove to pick her up.

During that time, he felt more like Serena’s chauffeur. After picking her up, if it was still early, they would either head to Serena’s riverside apartment or go to Leo's place. If it was too late, they would cuddle in the car, whisper sweet nothings to each other.

Now that Serena’s injuries were healing well, their intimacy had remained limited to kisses and hugs. She felt a bit impatient, and after several attempts to seduce Leo, she found herself pushing him onto the couch, but he rationally resisted.

Frustrated, she began to suspect her charm might be lacking. Even when she purposely dressed in sexy outfits, Leo always managed to hold back.

Unable to tolerate it any longer, she finally snapped, angrily asking, “You don’t have any issues with your body, do you?”

Leo chuckled while holding her, his expression a mix of amusement and tenderness. “You’ll find out soon enough whether I have any issues! Didn’t I say we should wait until you're fully healed and pick a sunny day in a beautiful place...”

Impatient, Serena interrupted him, “I’m already fine, and the weather is great today. If you think this place isn’t scenic enough, we could just go to a hotel…”

Leo gently pushed a strand of hair from her forehead, smiling affectionately. “You’re in such a hurry, huh? Let’s keep this weekend free; we’ll go to Fanyin Mountain to watch the sunrise…”

Serena felt her heart flutter. “A whole weekend…”

Leo nodded, pulling her into his embrace, his lips close to her ear as he whispered, “Don’t worry; I’ll arrange everything. I promise to give you an unforgettable night!”

The temptation was immense, and Serena found it hard to resist. Despite her mountain of work, she managed to clear her schedule for the weekend.

That day was bright and sunny. Leo picked her up early, and they drove for over two hours to Fanyin Mountain. They spent most of the day exploring the area and stayed overnight at a guesthouse on the mountain.

Leo had reserved a room in advance and even booked a candlelit dinner on the open-air terrace. The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was romantic. They sweetly fed each other, drawing envious glances from others.

“Hey, Serena, what a surprise to see you here…” 

Just as Serena swallowed a piece of bamboo shoot that Leo had fed her, she looked up to see Shang Ruzhen walking in, holding hands with a beautiful girl who had a pure appearance.

Serena shot him a glance, her expression briefly darkening before she forced a warm, harmless smile and greeted, “Cousin.”

Shang Ruzhen let go of the girl’s hand and walked over, sizing up Leo before bursting into laughter. “Haha, Serena, you really take Duan Kangyu’s words to heart, huh? He told you to find a pretty boy to gain some experience, and you actually found one. And this one…”

His gaze lingered on Leo, his eyes gleaming with desire. “He really looks like a great catch. Are you done playing with him? If you are, send him my way for a couple of days!”

Shang Ruzhen’s words completely objectified Leo, treating him like a toy.

Leo’s back straightened, his expression icy as he shot a glare at Shang Ruzhen, trying hard to suppress the urge to punch this obviously pathetic man.

Unfazed by Leo’s anger, Shang Ruzhen leaned over the table, continuing to mock Serena. “I’m not trying to be rude, but you’re just too naïve, Serena. Do you really think you can borrow Duan Kangyu’s light without shedding any blood? Let me tell you…”

He leaned closer, lowering his voice. “He took Ruyan to Hawaii for her birthday yesterday. Can you really count on him to propose? Tsk tsk, it’s hard to say. Instead of wasting your time trying to please him, why not collaborate with me? I’m tired of that yellow-faced woman at home; if you nod, I’ll kick her to the curb…”

Shang Ruzhen grew increasingly excited, as if Serena were already a delectable dish in front of him. “Let’s skip the formalities of engagement and just get married. If we have a kid, then Shangzhou would belong to our child. Our families wouldn’t have to fight like this anymore. What do you think?”

Serena set down her chopsticks and elegantly wiped her mouth with a napkin. She looked up at Shang Ruzhen with an impassive gaze.

“Cousin…” 

Her tone was soft and gentle, completely ignoring his words as she continued, “Let me formally introduce you. The gentleman sitting across from me is my boyfriend. You’re making him very unhappy with your teasing, and I’m quite unhappy as well…”
