Let's Go Get the Marriage Certificate

The staff in the dressing room were startled by Duan Kangyu's sudden shout, freezing for a moment before dropping their tasks and streaming out of the room. In an instant, the spacious dressing area was left with only Zhou Jingshu, who was elegantly seated in a wedding dress, her makeup and hair perfectly styled.

Unlike before, this time Zhou Jingshu didn't rise obediently or show even the slightest sign of fear or panic at the sight of Duan Kangyu storming in with fury. It was as if she had been anticipating his arrival all along.

Duan Kangyu strode forward, hands planted firmly on the arms of her chair, effectively trapping Zhou Jingshu between him and the back of the seat. Despite his eyes burning with rage, he couldn't help but feel a pang of admiration at the sight of her in the pure, immaculate wedding gown. If it weren’t for the incident where Tang Ying was arrested at the airport, Duan Kangyu wouldn’t have felt so exasperated by how stunning she looked.

Duan Kangyu glared fiercely at Zhou Jingshu, his voice cold and abrupt, “So it’s really you!” When he received a call from the person he sent to pick up Tang Ying at the airport, informing him that she had been handcuffed by the police as soon as she disembarked, everything suddenly clicked into place for him.

Though he had harbored doubts about this possibility in the past, after Zhou Jingshu had patiently endured his series of provocations, he had ultimately chosen to trust her. No. It wasn’t trust at all; Duan Kangyu was painfully aware of how much he was captivated by her at that moment, and how deeply he was infatuated with this girl who was almost twenty years his junior. This was why he found himself in such a predicament.

Faced with Duan Kangyu's fury, Zhou Jingshu didn’t play dumb this time, but she also didn’t respond directly to his words. She looked him up and down and sincerely complimented, “Uncle Duan, you look really good in this outfit today. With your handsome and elegant demeanor, it really makes me want to marry you…”

Duan Kangyu gritted his teeth, his anger boiling over, and ignored Zhou Jingshu's mockery, stating, “If you’re only here to call off the wedding, there’s no need to go this far!”

Zhou Jingshu’s eyes darkened slightly, and she let out a soft scoff, “Call off the wedding? Does Uncle Duan think he’s worth that much?”

Duan Kangyu understood Zhou Jingshu’s calculations all too well. He took a moment to steady his breathing, his voice lowering, “Jingshu, what do you really want?”

Just as Zhou Jingshu was about to respond, the fire alarm suddenly blared. Both Duan Kangyu and Zhou Jingshu were drawn to the piercing sound. Realizing it was a fire alarm, Duan Kangyu reached out toward Zhou Jingshu.

However, she deftly dodged him, a cryptic smile playing on her lips as she pushed her chair back and stood up gracefully. The voluminous skirt of her gown flared out, and she stood tall, her posture regal, chin lifted. In that moment, she looked like a queen, exuding an aura that was both majestic and untouchable.

“Uncle Duan, I advise you to be good if you don’t want to see Tang Ying suffer…” With that, she lifted her skirt slightly, bent her knees, and performed a ridiculously formal yet theatrical courtly farewell to Duan Kangyu. Then, she turned and strode confidently out of the room.

Duan Kangyu, frozen in place, watched Zhou Jingshu’s retreating figure, gritting his teeth in frustration as he yanked off his bowtie and tossed it aside. Only then did he walk out at a measured pace.

He never imagined that at his age, he would be toyed with by a young girl… Ignoring Zhou Jingshu’s warning to behave, he pulled out his phone and dialed Director Pei…

Meanwhile, the hallway was filling with smoke, and the alarm blared loudly. Zhou Jingshu clutched her layered wedding dress, shouldering her way through the heavy fire door and making her way down the stairs, following the panicked guests who were equally clueless about what was happening.

After what felt like an eternity, they finally saw a blinding light. In the doorway, against the backdrop of fleeing people, stood a tall and upright young man. As soon as Zhou Jingshu spotted Sheng Tang, her lips broke into an uncontrollable smile.

“Little Tang…” she called out joyfully, rushing into his arms.

Zhou Jingshu moved so quickly that Sheng Tang barely had time to process how stunning she looked in her wedding gown before she was enveloped in his embrace.

“Jingshu…” Sheng Tang felt a sense of unreality wash over him. He could only tighten his grip around her, confirming that this warm body in his arms was indeed real.

In that moment, they held each other tightly, resembling the protagonists who had finally overcome all obstacles to reach a happy ending, filled with infinite joy and hope!

Zhou Jingshu lifted her head from Sheng Tang's embrace, her face radiating innocence as she sweetly asked, “Little Tang, are you here to steal the bride?”

Sheng Tang gazed down at the woman in his arms and instinctively leaned down to place a gentle kiss on her forehead. With one hand, he intertwined his fingers with hers, while the other hand dramatically raised a household registration book, waving it in front of her.

“Yes, I am…” Sheng Tang’s expression softened, his gaze deepening with affection. He looked directly at Zhou Jingshu, speaking earnestly, “Jingshu, I love you. Let’s go get the marriage certificate!”

Zhou Jingshu’s eyes widened, her body stiffening in shock. It was then that she noticed Sheng Tang was dressed in a well-tailored black suit, complete with a delicate lily tucked into the pocket. He looked remarkably like a groom, perfectly matching her in her wedding gown.

Could it be that Sheng Tang really intended to marry her just like this?

Zhou Jingshu's smile faltered slightly, a hint of reluctance creeping in. “You… are you really planning to take me to get the marriage certificate just like this? Isn’t this… too…”

She found herself at a loss for words. Sheng Tang’s sudden proposal caught her completely off guard, leaving her stunned.

Noticing Zhou Jingshu’s flustered expression, Sheng Tang spoke calmly, “You seem a bit startled. Is marrying me really such an unbelievable thing for you?”

Zhou Jingshu’s smile grew even more strained. She wanted to respond with a lighthearted tease, but the words just wouldn’t come.

“Little Tang…” 

Sheng Tang held Zhou Jingshu’s hand tightly, his expression serious as he said, “Since you’ve ended things with Duan Kangyu today, can I finally have a legitimate claim to you?”

At the mention of a claim, Zhou Jingshu’s stiff thoughts warmed slightly. 

“Little Tang, I just had a confrontation with Duan Kangyu. For a long time, he will surely try to make deals with me. If we go public now, I’m afraid he’ll cause you trouble or try to use you…”

Zhou Jingshu didn’t need to say more; Sheng Tang understood her concerns perfectly.

He raised an eyebrow dismissively and said, “You don’t need to worry about Duan Kangyu. He doesn’t have the guts or the capability to cause me any trouble…”
