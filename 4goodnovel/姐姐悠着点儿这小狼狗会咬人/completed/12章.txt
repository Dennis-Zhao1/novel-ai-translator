**No Debts Between Us**

Leo Sterling turned in disappointment and walked away. 

Serena Zhou stood there, gazing at his retreating figure, her voice tinged with earnest inquiry, “So what do you think I should do? Just wait for three months until an old man comes and forces his way into my life, tormenting me at will?”

Leo halted his steps but didn’t turn around. His tone was cold and detached, “That’s your choice to make; the consequences are yours to bear. This shouldn’t give you the right to hurt me like this!”

“How did I hurt you…?” 

Serena stepped forward, blocking his path. Her big eyes were filled with innocence.

“…You said you wanted to be together; I agreed. You don’t want just three months, and I said we could be together for a lifetime—just not publicly. Leo, I don’t understand, what’s the downside for you in being with me, a strong man like you?”

Serena’s confusion was evident; to her, it seemed like a great opportunity for a man. Why did it feel like an offense to him?

Leo’s anger flared at her words, his eyes burning with intensity as he stared at her. “Serena Zhou, you…”

Suddenly, he felt there was nothing left to say to her. This woman had never considered his dignity. She saw him merely as a plaything…

“...Forget it. I can’t talk sense into you. You can go find whatever kind of man you want; let’s not meet again!”

With that, Leo stormed past her, leaving the small park in frustration. 

Serena turned to follow him, unwilling to give up. “Why can’t you explain? What are you really upset about?”

Leo strode away, his face dark and unyielding, ignoring her pleas. 

She quickened her pace, relentless in her pursuit. “Don’t you like me too? If we both have feelings for each other, why throw it all away?”

Upon hearing her words, Leo stopped abruptly by the roadside, turning to face her, his gaze icy. “Serena, you don’t deserve to talk about love. You have no clue what true love is about.”

“Why wouldn’t I know…?” Serena shot back defiantly. “Before I met you, I never wanted to kiss anyone, but now I want to kiss you; does that not count as love?”

The way she spoke so bluntly about kissing in the middle of the street was… shocking.

Leo glanced around, relieved that no one was nearby. If there were, he would have wanted to sink into the ground, his face burning with embarrassment. 

He felt a mix of discomfort and blush, his tone stiff. “Is this your understanding of love? So shallow, so vulgar?”

“How is that shallow or vulgar? Don’t you want to kiss me?” 

“I…” 

Leo was an honest man; he couldn’t deny the real feelings inside him. Late at night, he had thought about it, even dreamt about it shamelessly. But that didn’t mean anything.

Seeing him hesitate, Serena pressed on, “Then teach me what real love is. Is it love to want me but keep pushing me away for the sake of your so-called dignity?”

“I’m not just concerned about my dignity…” 

Leo felt his anger bubbling up again, nearly boiling over. “...We have different values, and our differences are too vast. Even if we were together, it probably wouldn’t last. Besides, you limited it to just three months from the start. I don’t want to waste my time on that, Serena, why…”

“Watch out!”

Before Leo could finish, Serena shouted sharply, interrupting him. 

Out of the corner of her eye, she spotted a motorcycle speeding towards Leo. Acting instinctively, she shoved him aside with all her strength. 

In the next instant, the motorcycle whizzed past Serena, barely missing her, before disappearing down the road. 

Serena stumbled to the ground, clutching her left foot and gasping in pain. 

“Serena, are you okay? Where are you hurt?” 

Leo rushed over, kneeling beside her, concern etched across his face. 

The tread marks of the motorcycle were visible on Serena’s shoe. He reached to remove her shoe to check her injury, but as soon as he moved, Serena winced in pain, inhaling sharply. 

“Don’t, don’t move; my toes… they hurt so much!” 

Cold sweat broke out on Serena’s forehead as she furrowed her brows tightly, her face pale. 

Leo’s brows knitted together with worry, his eyes filled with concern. “I’ll take you to the hospital…” 

He flagged down a taxi and, in one swift motion, picked Serena up, carrying her inside the vehicle as they headed to the hospital. 

Inside the taxi, Serena was still gasping in pain, and Leo felt helpless watching her suffer. He stammered softly, “We’ll be at the hospital soon; hang in there.” 

He then turned and urged the driver, “Sir, could you please go a bit faster?” 

Not knowing the severity of her injuries made Leo increasingly anxious. 

“Don’t worry; it’s just a minor injury; I’ll be fine…” 

Serena, noticing his distress, attempted to comfort him in return. 

“You… just now…” 

Leo’s mind raced back to the moment when, had it not been for her, that motorcycle might have crashed directly into him…

His emotions were a whirlwind of guilt and gratitude, rendering him speechless. 

Serena understood his thoughts, giving him a lighthearted smile as she said, “You saved me once; I’ll return the favor. Though my repayment doesn’t match your saving me, we can say we’re even now.” 

“After we get to the hospital, just go, okay? Otherwise, I might not be able to control myself and accept your earlier proposition…” 

Her earlier proposition? 

The thought of taking her to a hotel and… 

Leo felt a lump in his throat. “Let’s not talk about that right now.” 

Serena replied softly, “Okay,” but the disappointment was clear in her voice as she turned her head away. 

When they arrived at the hospital, Serena initially intended to gingerly walk in, trying to bear the pain. 

“I’ll carry you!” 

But Leo scooped her up again without waiting for her response. 

Serena couldn’t refuse; perhaps this was the last time they would be this close. 

At the hospital, while the doctor treated Serena’s injury, Leo waited in the hallway, his thoughts swirling like a storm. 

This situation mirrored when she had injured her right hand, and he had waited for her to heal. 

He was deeply torn about what to do with Serena. Should he take a step forward, accepting her as his secret lover, or take a step back, choosing never to see her again and becoming strangers? 

Had she not taken that blow for him today, he would have undoubtedly chosen the latter without a second thought. 

But now, he found himself unable to do so… 

Serena was willing to get hurt to push him away. 

He knew she had feelings for him, perhaps even unbeknownst to herself. Her affection for him was likely more profound than mere attraction to his appearance! 

But with so much uncertainty, was he willing to take that gamble?
