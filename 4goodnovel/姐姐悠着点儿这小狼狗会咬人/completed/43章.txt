**Chapter 1: Secrets and Shadows**

“I actually don’t like men.” 

No one would curse themselves with such a thing without reason, so there’s no need to verify it. 

Serena Zhou pondered for a moment before asking, “Does my cousin and Uncle Zhang know?” 

Jia Jia Yan shook her head. 

Serena was taken aback. “You’re not planning to tell them?” 

A flicker of desolation crossed Jia Jia's eyes as she forced a smile. “What’s the point of telling them? Your cousin… he has his mistress parading around in the company, flaunting her like it’s nothing. If they find out I have little time left…” 

Jia Jia’s voice trembled with the pain she tried to suppress. 

“…wouldn't that just make him more arrogant?” 

Serena’s eyes darted as she hastily clarified, “Sister, you might be misunderstanding. Even though my cousin and Manager Mu often come and go together, there shouldn’t be anything between them…” 

Jia Jia's eyes widened in shock. “What? Manager Mu? You mean Mu Tingyao and Shang Ruzhen…” 

Serena realized she had misspoken and was about to explain, but all she managed to utter was “Sister.” 

Before she could say more, Jia Jia had already declared, “Serena, I’ll come find you another day,” and stormed out. 

Once Jia Jia left, Serena instructed her assistant, Daisy, to bring in Li Li Qin. 

Li Li, who was interning in the marketing department, wasn’t on the same floor as Serena’s office. Daisy didn’t call ahead but went to find Li Li in person. 

Li Li followed Daisy through the long corridor, passing the comprehensive office, the president’s office, and the secretary’s room, until they finally reached Serena’s office. 

As they passed by Shang Ruzhen’s office, Li Li curiously exclaimed, “Huh? Isn’t this the CEO’s office?” 

Daisy glanced at Shang Ruzhen’s office. “That’s not the CEO’s office; that’s the office of Vice President Shang.” 

Li Li’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Vice… Vice President Shang? Shang Ruzhen…” 

Daisy nodded but didn’t pay much attention to Li Li’s sudden change in expression. She confidently knocked on Serena’s office door. “CEO Zhou, Li Li has arrived!” 

She then pushed the door open, leading a once-joyful but now somewhat lost Li Li into Serena’s office. 

Serena sat behind her grand mahogany desk, her expression grave, fingers interlaced and pressed against her lips, her gaze icy and sharp. 

Seeing Serena in such a commanding posture, Li Li felt a twinge of anxiety and timidly greeted, “CEO Zhou.” 

With a glance, Serena signaled Daisy to leave the office, which Daisy understood and obediently stepped out, closing the door behind her. 

Serena’s piercing gaze returned to Li Li. “Li Li, just now, the wife of Vice President Shang came to see me. She told me something shocking regarding you…” 

Before Serena could finish, Li Li rushed forward, eager to explain. “CEO, please let me explain! It was all a misunderstanding. That day, I thought the person in bed was you; I didn’t realize I had walked into the wrong office…” 

Li Li desperately recounted the mix-up from that day. “You know, I’ve only been to your floor once, and Vice President Shang’s office is right next to yours, so I got confused…” 

As she spoke, Li Li realized how badly the situation had escalated. “CEO, you have to believe me! There’s really nothing between me and Mrs. Shang. I’ve already cut ties with Vice President Shang. It was truly just a mistake…” 

When Li Li finished, she noticed Serena’s expression darkening even further, and in her panic, she bowed her head and began to quietly sob. 

Serena knew that Li Li would resort to playing the pity card. Though annoyed, she softened her expression, walked over, and offered her a tissue to wipe her tears. 

She even wrapped an arm around Li Li’s shoulder, lowering her voice to comfort her. 

Li Li looked up with tear-filled eyes, pleading, “CEO, do you really believe me?” 

Mentioning this topic made Serena’s expression more serious. 

“Of course I believe you, but it’s hard to say for Mrs. Shang…” 

Li Li was acutely aware that her relationship with Shang Ruzhen was anything but innocent. If Mrs. Shang investigated further, her internship would be the least of her worries… 

At that moment, she dared not approach Shang Ruzhen. If she did, Serena would likely suspect she still had ties with him. 

After a moment of thought, Li Li could only continue to look at Serena with hopeful eyes. “CEO, ever since you arranged for me to join Shangzhou, I’ve been dedicated to following you. You have to help me…” 

Serena sat down on the sofa, pulling Li Li closer. 

“I will definitely help you, but remember, the Shangzhou Group isn’t solely my decision to make. Mrs. Shang’s brother is the police chief. If she truly believes there’s something between you and Vice President Shang, I might be powerless!” 

Li Li shivered at the thought, leaning closer to Serena. “CEO, what should I do?” 

Serena pondered for a while, her tone heavy. “There must be a way, but…” 

Li Li’s eyes brightened. “CEO, do you have a plan?” 

Serena pinched Li Li’s chin, forcing her to look directly at her, teasing her with suspense. “Li Li, before I tell you how to resolve this, can you first tell me your true feelings about me? Do you genuinely want to follow me?” 

Li Li’s eyes darted as she replied urgently, “Of course! I truly want to follow you, even though I know we might not have a future…” 

“Who says we can't have a future? As long as you are sincere with me and willing to stay by my side, I can give you everything you desire and protect you, ensuring you don’t suffer even a little harm!” 

Serena’s heartfelt declaration almost made her choke on her own words. 

“CEO…” 

Li Li, feeling moved, nestled into Serena’s embrace. “Thank you! With your words, I feel so much more at ease. I thought you were cold towards me lately; I was worried you didn’t like me anymore.” 

“Fool!” 

Serena wrapped her arm around Li Li’s shoulders, her gaze cold as ice but her tone gentle. “How could I dislike you? I’ve just been overwhelmed with work lately. Plus, Leo Sterling broke up with me, and Duan Kangyu has postponed our engagement… It’s all just a chaotic mess that has left me feeling quite frazzled…” 

Li Li knew little about Serena’s situation with Leo and Duan. Hearing Serena bring it up now, she asked a few questions out of curiosity. 

Regarding Leo, Serena offered little more than, “I actually don’t like men. Leo was just a way for Duan Kangyu to annoy me, and I had to go along with it.” 

But when it came to Duan Kangyu, Serena’s tone became much more intense. 

She openly shared how Duan was angry with her for breaking off the engagement with Tang Ying and was taking it out on her. 

Now that she had taken over Shangzhou, she was constantly thwarted by Shang Ruzhen and, in an effort to keep the Shang family in check, she had to appease Duan Kangyu, which forced her into an unwanted marriage. 

It wasn’t just that. She poured out her troubled past, revealing her not-so-innocent background, having witnessed her parents’ tragic deaths as a child, being insulted and labeled a pervert when confessing to a girl she liked in high school, and other embarrassing experiences. 

Serena shared her story with rich emotion, pouring her heart out to Li Li.
