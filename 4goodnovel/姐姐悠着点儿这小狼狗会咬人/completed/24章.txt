**I Really Hope You Get Your Wish**

When she finally woke up, it was already the next morning. Serena Zhou hadn’t even opened her eyes when she heard Leo Sterling’s gentle voice floating down from above, “Sister, are you awake? Are you feeling any better?”

Leo's cool hand brushed against Serena’s forehead, and the refreshing touch brought her back to full awareness. The moment she opened her eyes, his strikingly handsome face was the first thing she saw, making her heart flutter. A smile spread across her lips, a natural reaction to his presence.

“Are you hungry? I had someone bring breakfast for you. Want to get up and eat?” Leo asked, offering his hand to help her sit up. Serena glanced at the breakfast spread on the table but didn’t feel hungry at all.

“I’d like to take a shower first…” she admitted, feeling sticky and uncomfortable while Leo looked fresh and rejuvenated.

“Then let me carry you there…” he suggested, his eyes sparkling with warmth and determination. Serena almost declined, but the eagerness in his gaze was impossible to resist. She relented, allowing him to scoop her up and carry her into the bathroom.

“If you’re still feeling unwell, I can help wash you…” Leo whispered playfully, nuzzling her ear with a tenderness that made her heart race.

However, their playful banter only stoked the flames of desire, filling the bathroom with a charged atmosphere. It was a rather mundane yet chaotic weekend; the two of them didn’t leave the room all day. By the time evening rolled around, Serena’s legs were too weak to carry her, so Leo had to carry her to the car.

Lin Cheng had originally come to pick Serena up the previous night, but she had insisted he leave without her. Thus, Leo was the one driving her back. Instead of taking her home to the Zhou family, he drove her to his rented apartment, claiming he wanted to show off his culinary skills.

He gently laid her down on the sofa, turned on the TV for her, and gave her a soft kiss, reminding her he’d be back soon after running to buy some groceries. Serena nodded, watching him with admiration as he bustled about.

She couldn’t shake the feeling of inadequacy, feeling like a burden. Leo was an exceptional cook and knew of her love for spicy food, preparing several classic Sichuan dishes that were simply to die for.

“Did you learn to cook somewhere?” Serena asked, resting her chin on her hands as she gazed at him with wide, admiring eyes.

“Isn’t it simple enough to figure out?” Leo raised an eyebrow, teasing her.

Serena felt a bit insulted. “I’ve lived on my own for five or six years too! I can cook, but it’s nothing compared to this.”

Leo’s dishes were not only delicious but also beautifully presented, making her wonder if he was an expert chef hiding in plain sight.

“Leo…” she said, propping her chin on her hands and looking at him with admiration, “How are you so skilled in everything? I think I’m falling for you more and more!”

Leo ignored her teasing, playfully pinching her nose before standing up to clear the table. Serena was known for her sweet words, and while Leo used to blush at her compliments, he had grown immune to her flattery over time.

After tidying everything up, he took off his apron and sat back down on the sofa with her, picking a romantic movie for them to watch together. Each time the male and female leads shared a kiss, they instinctively turned to each other, sharing sweet pecks.

Their heads leaned together, comfortably nestled on the sofa as they occasionally chatted about the film or other trivial matters, feeling an overwhelming sense of warmth and happiness.

“I really hope time can freeze at this moment…” Serena sighed wistfully.

Leo looked at her with a tender gaze, this time not dismissing her daydreams but gently agreeing, “I truly hope you can get your wish!”

Serena melted under Leo’s affectionate gaze, leaning into him with joy. “Leo, I didn’t see your cousin yesterday. He’s not angry, is he?”

Leo shook his head, “Don’t worry, my cousin isn’t the type to hold grudges.”

Serena let out a soft “oh” and casually asked, “Are you close with him? What does he do?”

Leo toyed with Serena’s delicate fingers, his eyes still glued to the TV, muttering, “He’s in the military.”

“Oh, so he must be busy and can’t come home often?” 

“Yeah, he only gets one leave a year.”

“Is he married?”

Leo frowned slightly, “He… isn’t.”

“Does he have a girlfriend?”

“Not yet!”

“No way! If he’s your cousin, he should be good-looking. Being in the military must mean he’s in good shape too… how old is he?”

Leo pursed his lips and turned to face Serena, raising an eyebrow, “Why are you so curious about my cousin? Sister, do you have some inappropriate feelings for him?”

Serena couldn’t help but laugh at Leo’s unexpected thought process, “Leo, the only guy I have feelings for is you. I’m only curious about your cousin because I care about you and want to know more!”

She leaned in and planted a soft kiss on Leo’s lips, grinning, “Don’t let your imagination run wild!”

That kiss felt more potent than any sweet words she could speak. Leo didn’t genuinely care; he simply wasn’t sure whether to share personal details about Song Hanzhou with her.

“If you don’t want me to overthink it, then you need to keep your heart and eyes to yourself. Don’t be swayed by other men or look at them too much, or else I’ll get jealous, and I might…” 

He emphasized the word “might” in a teasing tone, leaning closer to her ear, whispering, “...punish you!”

Serena was unfazed, even intrigued, “Oh really? I’m curious to know how you plan to punish me.”

Leo’s hands began to roam lower, his eyes burning with intensity. He nibbled on her earlobe and neck, his voice coming in breathless bursts, “Didn’t you guess? Yes, it’s time for me to punish you!”

He pulled Serena into his embrace, and as his warm breath tickled her skin, she burst out in giggles, playfully wriggling away.

Leo was losing his composure; right now, he had little self-control in front of her. With every twist of her body and every teasing glance, the fire in his eyes blazed hotter.
