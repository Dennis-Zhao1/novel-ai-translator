**I Love You**

That night, Leo Sterling stayed over. He playfully rolled Serena Zhou around in the pea field, and afterward, he rolled up his sleeves, returning to his old ways by preparing a feast that made her mouth water.

“Little Leo, I really treasure you… these hands…”

As Leo set the table, he lifted his gaze slightly, “Oh really? What do you treasure about me?”

“Everything! From body to soul!” Serena tilted her face up, her eyes sparkling with the warmth of spring.

Leo looked at her face, mesmerized, feeling as if he could lose himself in those depths. Unable to resist, he pulled her into his embrace, kissing her softly… The familiar taste, the familiar recipe, the shameless teasing, and the sweet nothings flowed effortlessly from his lips.

Serena…

Leo couldn’t quite articulate the feeling swelling in his heart at that moment. It was a sense of… completeness! The moment he spoke of wanting to marry her, he knew he would devote his entire life to her — utterly, completely. No matter how she treated him, he couldn’t let her go!

That was it! Resignation was unavoidable!

The last six months, when she left the shallow sea, had tormented him enough no matter what he did or what means he employed to find her. If she truly vanished from this world, he would likely not be far from disappearing himself.

“What’s this?”

After dinner, Leo suddenly pulled out an envelope and handed it to Serena.

“Betrothal gift!” he said while collecting the dishes. “Take your time to look it over. Let me know what you think once I’m done here!”

Serena weighed the envelope in her hands; it wasn’t thick, so it probably wasn’t something like funds, stocks, or real estate. What could it be…?

She opened the envelope and glanced at its contents. In an instant, she understood what it was.

Furrowing her brows, she set the documents down and dashed toward the kitchen.

Inside, Leo was washing the dishes when she snuck up behind him and enveloped him in a tight hug.

He paused, then put down the dish, washed his hands, and turned to hold Serena close.

“Serena…”

Leo’s voice was low, wrapped in a chill of longing.

“…Do you know what you did that hurt me the most? The thing that makes me resent and hate you? It’s that you never saw me as a man you could rely on or trust…”

“You always treated me like a pretty boy, a pawn you could use for your purposes…”

“To deal with Song Weiming, you only thought of bargaining with General Sterling, never considering to let me in on even the slightest bit…”

If he had known her target was Song Weiming and not Duan Kangyu, he would have sent Song Weiming straight to prison, regardless of the fact that Song was his uncle by marriage. Even if his relationship with Song Haizhou was closer than with anyone from the Sterling family, he would have done it for her. No, even if it weren’t for Serena, he wouldn’t have allowed someone as deranged and dangerous as Song Weiming to exist in their midst!

Leo had no interest in business or power. His agreement to take over Sterling Holdings was not about avenging Serena or trapping her with his capabilities. 

He was solely focused on Song Weiming.

During the funeral of Song Weiming, Leo had already sensed something was off. The car accident was publicly deemed an accident, but Song Haizhou had to have sensed the oddities behind it. Yet, he remained silent in front of General Sterling, which was so out of character for him.

After Leo sent people to investigate, they confirmed that Song Weiming was still alive.

Upon learning this, he laughed. He laughed at how Serena’s intricate schemes had ended up in vain. He laughed at how he, a pawn in their games, had shown no value at all. 

But laughing turned to fury! Because General Sterling had calculated him in as well, dismissing him entirely.

Although General Sterling and his wife had looked down on him since childhood, he had never felt such anger and humiliation before. 

Did everyone consider him a fool? A pawn? A soft target? Did they never consider if their blades would wound him?

They never regarded him as a living, breathing person!

Fine! If that was the case, he would play along. He would gamble his fate and see whose blood would spill when this despised pawn finally broke!

After taking over Sterling Holdings, Leo implemented sweeping reforms. The best part about a family business was how easily it could adjust directions and policies. But of course, there were always challenges and frustrations along the way.

Once Leo took over, he realized just how hard it had been for Serena to hold up the crumbling business and the Zhou family all on her own.

When busy, he could push thoughts of Serena aside. But in quiet moments, their sweet memories came flooding back, effortlessly taking over his mind.

Serena was too resilient. She had set up camp in his head, and there was no evicting her!

During that time, he often suffered from insomnia, pondering why everything had turned out this way.

In his quest for answers, Leo sadly discovered he could only vent his fury on Song Weiming.

Serena had hurt him, yet he was still hopelessly in love with her, fixated on her…

After all, General Sterling was his biological father. What could he do? Crush him underfoot?

Before Serena left the shallow sea, he had already begun plotting to send Song Weiming to prison. He initially thought if Serena didn’t leave, after he sent Song Weiming away, he would find a way to control the Zhou family business, forcing Serena to return to him.

Whether out of love or manipulation, he wanted her by his side for life, someone he could never let go of!

But then, when Song Qingchen woke up, she immediately began flirting with Fu Nanchuan and ultimately just disappeared without a trace…

She didn’t even give him a chance for revenge. And she left, just like that, without a word…

No matter how hard he tried to find her or force her to appear, she remained elusive for six long months!

Leo was tormented, drained of spirit.

However, after Serena left the shallow sea, he gradually unraveled the intense emotions of anger and hatred that had consumed him.

Leo had once been gentle and kind-hearted. What he sought was never power or fame. He had grand aspirations, hoping for a warm, simple, and stable life.

Though he knew from the start that Serena wasn’t the right match for him, the sincerity he had given could never be taken back.

“…Serena, if I could, I really want to hate you, I want to forget you!”

“I’m sorry…”

Serena’s eyes glistened with unshed tears. 

Though she deeply reflected on her mistakes and recognized her wrongdoing in this matter, the damage had already been done. 

She couldn’t turn back time; all she could do was hope for compensation in the future…

“…I promise to be a good little Leo from now on…”

She pulled away from his embrace, cupping his face in her hands, gazing at him with loving eyes as she earnestly said, “...Even though I can’t take back the hurtful words I said in the past, I need to clarify that those were never my true feelings!”

“My true feelings are only this one sentence right now…”

Serena pronounced with heartfelt conviction, “...I love you!”

**Extra: Serena By His Side**

Serena Zhou stepped into the Sterling household once more on New Year's Eve that year. 

Although she didn’t fear General Sterling, she wanted to avoid any awkwardness, so aside from Leo, she brought an ally along with her.

Using the word “find” might not be accurate. More precisely, she and Leo had “created” an ally together.

That’s right. Serena was pregnant as she accompanied Leo to the Sterling household. They had officially registered their marriage back on Qixi Festival. 

However, afterward, Serena remained in the suburbs, living the life of a farmer. Meanwhile, her farmer husband juggled work, studies, and occasional dates with her.

Seeing Leo running around was quite taxing. After the autumn harvest, they returned to Shallow Sea.

But she didn’t go back to the Zhou family; instead, she moved directly into the apartment Leo had rented before. After all, in that apartment, she had experienced the most beautiful and warm love in the world.

Leo was quick to act. Not long after Serena returned to Shallow Sea, he made sure she was carrying a little Leo.

Serena, with her growing belly, was taken by Leo to Qingheng City to meet his grandmother. 

Leo’s grandmother was a kind-hearted old lady who dote on Leo and, by extension, showed much affection toward Serena.

When Serena visited the Sterling family, General Sterling’s face was dark as thunder, but he managed to restrain himself. After all, Serena was radiant and cheerful, and as the saying goes, one does not strike a smiling face. Plus, Leo had already married her, turning their love into something solid.

General Sterling couldn’t lash out at a pregnant woman, no matter how dissatisfied he was with Serena.

As for Leo…

He had never been particularly close to his father. Even though he obeyed his orders by taking over Sterling Holdings, he did not comply with his expectations. Instead, he pushed for reforms and changed out most of the key positions within a year.

General Sterling had tried to intervene, but he couldn’t just stomp on his own son. Furthermore, the wound from the dealings between him and Serena ran deep, so he chose to turn a blind eye to Leo’s actions.

With General Sterling turning a blind eye, others naturally had little to say.

Lin Su even showed extra care and concern for the pregnant Serena. Upon learning of her pregnancy, she specifically visited Shallow Sea to check on her, giving her a long list of advice.

Everything was going quite well…

Of course, there were still a few people who rubbed Serena the wrong way. 

One was Song Haizhou. After all, Leo had sent Song Weiming to prison. Because of this, Song Haizhou had nearly severed ties with Leo, and his attitude toward Serena was easy to imagine.

As for Song He, that was another story altogether.

But the one who made Serena the most uncomfortable wasn’t these two. 

It was Xia Xiuhe, who had once been her brother’s boyfriend, but now was her cousin’s… Yes, Song Haizhou was her cousin… boyfriend, who came to celebrate the New Year at the Sterling family.

Although she was now pregnant and should ideally avoid emotional turmoil, she couldn’t help but mock, “Looks like Mr. Xia is destined to become my brother-in-law, whether it’s with my brother or my cousin. Doesn’t that mean I have a deeper connection with Mr. Xia…”

Xia Xiuhe had once spent New Year with the Zhou family. Back then, he was sweetly in love with Song Qingchen.

In the blink of an eye, just two or three years had passed, and he was now with someone else, yet Serena still had to sit at the same table for the New Year’s dinner with him.

It was truly unpleasant.

Very unpleasant!

Honestly, if it weren’t for Song Qingchen’s magnanimity and willingness to forgive Xia Xiuhe, Serena would have made sure he rotted abroad and never return!

“Serena, I know my father has done a lot of harm to you and the Zhou family, but he has been arrested and sentenced to twenty years, never to come out again. This is his just desserts, but Xia Xiuhe is innocent. Please don’t take it out on him…”

Serena scoffed at Song Haizhou’s words.

“Don’t worry, I won’t target him. I won’t for the sake of my brother, after all, he almost lost his life because of him…”

Song Qingchen loved Xia Xiuhe so much, and if Serena genuinely targeted Xia Xiuhe, her brother would likely end up back in the hospital.

“…But I still have to remind both of you: you continue your love, just remember to stay away from my brother!”

Song Qingchen had just woken from a coma and managed to hold up the Zhou family business. If Xia Xiuhe or Song Haizhou, or anyone else, like the Duan family matriarch or Tang Ying, dared to harm him again, she would no longer tolerate her brother’s merciful heart.

Although she brought an ally with her to celebrate the New Year at the Sterling family, the year was still rather unpleasant for Serena.

“If you’re unhappy, we won’t come back next year…”

Leo hadn’t initially planned to return to the Sterling household for the New Year. 

But Serena insisted. How could they not visit the in-laws during their first year of marriage and celebrate the New Year together?

If she was in a bad mood, then they could all be in a bad mood together! That might just make her feel better!

Before she got pregnant, Leo and Serena would bicker, and he would occasionally tease her with old grievances. 

But since her pregnancy, he had almost returned to the sweet times they once shared. 

Whatever Serena said went. He often hugged her, resting his hand on her belly, ecstatically exclaiming, “With wife and child, life is good. This is enough for this lifetime!”

Though the future was uncertain and life might not always go smoothly, as long as Serena was by his side, he felt there was no regret in life!

**The End**
