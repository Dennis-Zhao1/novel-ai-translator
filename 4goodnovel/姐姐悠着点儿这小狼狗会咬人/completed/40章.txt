**Let’s Break Up**

If it was merely because of Fu Nanyin that Leo Sterling was feeling agitated, then Serena Zhou decided it was time to speak the truth. After all, the unspoken taboos between them were numerous, but Fu Nanyin was definitely not one of them. In reality, this matter had very little to do with Fu Nanyin from the beginning to the end.

Leo shifted his gaze from Serena to the heavy night sky. He slowly exhaled the cold dread that had been building in his chest, standing tall and straight, his voice icy as he asked, “What, can’t you explain this in a few words?”

Serena’s voice rang out clear and bright, “I don’t need a few words; I can explain it all in one sentence.” Yet, her expression revealed a hint of desolation and loneliness.

Leo’s heart began to stir with compassion. “Do you need to pull up a chair to sit?”

Serena rested her elbows on her knees, cradling her face in her hands, her eyes fixed on a void in the night sky. She spoke softly, “It’s because when I’m standing here talking to you, it feels like I’m reporting to you. I’m not your servant…”

The word “servant” sent a wave of panic through Leo’s heart. “You’re not my servant, but this should be a serious conversation…”

Serena couldn’t help but interrupt him. “This isn’t a discussion at all… it’s just a misunderstanding!”

“A misunderstanding?” Leo looked at Serena, bewildered. “You read the love letter you wrote to Fu Nanyin over the loudspeakers at your high school, for more than two thousand people to hear, and you think that’s a misunderstanding?”

Serena knew that Leo must have heard about this incident, which was why he was questioning her sexuality and feeling upset! “This situation is indeed not a misunderstanding…” she said, her voice muffled. “But that love letter and the person I wanted to confess to… that’s a misunderstanding!”

Leo narrowed his eyes. “What kind of misunderstanding are we talking about?”

At first, Leo hadn’t taken the news seriously. He believed Serena liked him, and that kind of affection couldn’t be faked. There was no way she could like women; it had to be a rumor. But after hearing Qin Lili’s words and then listening to the recording of Serena confessing to Fu Nanyin, his conviction began to crack.

The love letter Serena wrote to Fu Nanyin was heartfelt, and she read it with such emotion. There was no way it could have been a prank or a misunderstanding. Over the airwaves, she had clearly pronounced Fu Nanyin’s name. And the conversation that followed just confirmed that Serena had genuinely liked Fu Nanyin. Although…

Leo was frustrated by this. He had always respected personal preferences, but he found it hard to accept that his girlfriend had once liked a woman—was bisexual. If Serena really was bisexual and was planning to take care of Qin Lili… Although Leo had convinced himself that the relationship with Serena was a mutual romance, he knew in reality, it wasn’t much different from being “taken care of” by her. He didn’t need her to pay or give him anything in return. 

Serena liked him now, so she pursued him, sweet-talking her way into his heart. But what if one day she grew tired of him and turned her affections elsewhere… and that someone could be a woman?!

Just the thought of that possibility made Leo feel unbearable.

But when Serena explained the matter, her words were straightforward and concise. “I never liked Fu Nanyin, and I’m not bisexual. I liked a boy in high school, and that love letter was for him. However, before I could confess, I found out he didn’t just dislike me but looked down on me. Out of anger, I decided to teach him a lesson…”

Leo felt a bit lost, but he quickly zeroed in on the key point: “You thought confessing to Fu Nanyin would teach that boy a lesson?”

Serena confirmed with a slight, cold “mm,” but it seemed she didn’t intend to elaborate further. She looked up at Leo with her big, innocent eyes and earnestly said, “Leo, I really don’t like women. Qin Lili coming to Shangzhou was truly arranged by Shang Ruzhen. Please believe me!”

With that display of vulnerability and charm, Leo couldn’t keep his cool facade anymore, despite his lingering doubts. He approached her, squatting down in front of her, and softly asked, “So, you really love me, only me?”

Serena’s eyes brimmed with tenderness as she gently caressed Leo’s face, softly saying, “Leo, do I make you feel so insecure?”

Was it because of the complicated matters surrounding her that he needed to keep confirming her love for him over and over again?! Did he really fear being abandoned by her?

Serena frowned, seriously declaring, “Yes, I love you. I really, really love you. I truly only love you. Trust me, as long as you don’t say we’re breaking up, I will never let you go first!”

However, Serena’s earnest declaration only deepened Leo’s discomfort. He reached up to touch her brow and asked softly, “But you’re about to get engaged to Duan Kangyu? Do you think after your engagement, we can still be the same as we are now?”

Serena stiffened; he was still concerned about Duan Kangyu…

“Leo, I…”

The hand that had been stroking Leo’s face fell weakly to her side. With a deep sigh, she replied helplessly, “I’m sorry, but I can’t cancel my engagement with Duan Kangyu…”

Leo stared intently at Serena, probing, “Is it that you can’t, or is it that you don’t want to?”

That question… Serena’s gaze faltered, unable to answer. 

“If you want to get rid of him, we can think of a way together. I…”

“Leo…”

Serena felt this was a dangerous thought, and she interrupted him, confessing, “I’m sorry, I don’t want to deceive you. It’s not that I can’t; it’s that I don’t want to!”

Leo’s expression turned cold, his heart feeling desolate. He managed a wry smile, his wounded eyes glistening with tears, piercing Serena’s heart and making her uneasy.

“If that’s the case, how can you still say you love me, that you only love me? Serena, what do you think I am to you? Are you planning to continue this half-hearted relationship with me after your engagement to Duan Kangyu? Have you thought about our future, or do you think I’m simply not worthy of a future with you?”

A series of questions left Serena’s face pale as a ghost. 

She instinctively called out, “Leo…”

She sensed something, but she couldn’t stop it. All she could do was watch as Leo stood up, step by step, backing away from her.

Leo closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, the emotions that had been there were replaced by a cold, hard distance. 

His voice was empty and chilling, “I said long ago that I could never be your secret lover. Since you’re determined to marry Duan Kangyu then…”

Leo couldn’t bear to witness the emotions that might appear on Serena’s face afterward. He turned his gaze to the weary night sky and softly said, “…Serena, let’s break up.”
