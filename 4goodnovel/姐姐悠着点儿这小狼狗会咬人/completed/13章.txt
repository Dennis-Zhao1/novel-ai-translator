This woman is not worth pity at all.

As Leo Sterling's thoughts spiraled in confusion and concern for Serena Zhou’s injury, his friend, Sister Dai, rushed into the hospital. Spotting Leo there, she paused for a moment, then quickly composed herself to ask about Serena’s condition.

Just then, the door swung open, and Serena emerged, supporting herself against the wall. She shuffled out step by step, her left foot clad in an open-toed slipper, gingerly avoiding putting too much weight on it.

Sister Dai and Leo hurried over to help her. “Ms. Zhou, what happened? Are you alright?”

Seeing Leo, Serena felt a surge of relief wash over her. She forced a smile despite the pain and replied, “It’s nothing serious. I accidentally kicked the curb, and my big toe is fractured. The doctor said it will heal in ten days to two weeks!”

Her left foot was wrapped in a thick layer of white gauze, concealing the extent of her injuries. 

Since Serena seemed so casual about it, Sister Dai took her words at face value and didn’t pry further. “Then let me take you home…”

As they started to lead Serena outside, Leo lingered a moment longer, asking the doctor a few more questions. The doctor confirmed that it was indeed just her big toe that was fractured; the other toes were merely swollen and would heal with some medication. However, with the big toe in a cast, Serena would need follow-up visits and should be careful not to injure it further. He gave Leo several precautions, including keeping her foot elevated while resting.

Leo diligently noted everything down on his phone and even asked for the doctor’s contact information before striding over to join the two women.

Serena was moving slowly due to her injury, prompting Leo to suggest, “Let me carry you, this way you can get home and rest sooner.”

To his surprise, Serena didn’t refuse, merely glancing at Sister Dai for confirmation. Understanding the situation immediately, Sister Dai stepped aside and politely said, “Oh, if that’s the case, then I’ll leave it to you, Leo!”

“Not a problem,” he replied, then hoisted Serena into his arms and headed toward the garage.

As they waited for the elevator, Sister Dai stole a glance at Serena. Once she caught Serena’s eye, Sister Dai expressed her apologies, “I’m really sorry, Leo, but I have to go pick up my daughter soon. Could you please drop Ms. Zhou off at home?”

Leo nodded, “Sure.”

Sister Dai sincerely thanked him and handed him the car keys. With both arms occupied, Leo turned to Serena, “Can you take the keys?”

Serena hesitated, pretending to weigh the inconvenience, “Is that too much trouble for you?”

“Not at all!”

Seeing Leo’s expression remain unreadable, Serena felt a flutter of anxiety but ultimately took the keys from Sister Dai’s hand.

The elevator arrived quickly, and as Leo carried Serena inside, they found themselves alone in the spacious cabin. Serena sensed the awkward tension growing between them and wanted to break the silence, but Leo’s cold demeanor made it difficult for her to gauge his thoughts, leaving her hesitant to speak.

Upon reaching the garage, Leo carefully placed Serena into the car, shut the door, and went around to the driver’s side. Just as he was about to get in, he found the door locked.

Through the window, Leo looked at Serena, puzzled. The keys were in her hand, clearly indicating that she had locked him out on purpose.

With a sigh, he walked back to the passenger side and knocked on the window, trying to understand her intentions. But Serena seemed determined not to lower the glass.

She waved her phone at him instead. The next moment, Leo’s phone buzzed in his pocket.

“Open the door, I’m taking you home!” he said, his tone low and firm.

Serena stared blankly ahead, her voice flat as she replied, “No need, I can manage. You should leave.”

Leo gritted his teeth, suppressing the storm of emotions boiling inside him. He asked, trying to keep his voice steady, “What do you mean by that?”

“I mean nothing… I just want to tell you that you don’t need to feel guilty about today. I certainly don’t need your sympathy. You don’t have to force yourself to be responsible. As you said before, I’m an adult, and I can take responsibility for my choices. So, just go.”

Leo narrowed his eyes, incredulous. “You really want me to leave?”

Serena paused for a moment before softly affirming, “Yes. Just get some rest. Don’t worry; like you said before, we won’t see each other again.”

With that, she ended the call decisively.

Determined, she slid from the passenger seat to the driver’s seat. Although her left foot was injured, she managed to maneuver her way over.

Just as she was about to succeed, there was a frantic knock on the window, and her phone rang again.

Serena glanced at the screen before tossing the phone aside, then focused on her task, finally achieving the transition.

“Serena Zhou...” 

Leo's voice was thick with urgency as he knocked on the window, his tone distant yet frantic. “You’re being reckless! Open the door! If you dare drive today, I won’t let you off easily!”

He leaned closer to the window, shouting, “Open the door, now!”

Serena remained defiant, refusing to unlock the door and instead turned the key to start the engine.

Leo’s heart raced in panic at her actions.

“Serena Zhou...” 

Seeing her nonchalance, Leo gave up on knocking and shouting. He moved to stand in front of the car, blocking her path.

With no other choice, Serena reluctantly picked up her phone again. Her voice carried a heavy weariness as she took the initiative, “Leo, what exactly do you want?”

Fury coursed through him, causing his fingers to tremble. “You’re asking me? I want to know what you think you’re doing, Serena Zhou!”

Her tone was eerily calm, “You know exactly what I want.”

He did know, but...

“I will never be your shameful secret!” Leo declared through gritted teeth.

As expected.

“Then there’s nothing more to discuss. Goodbye!”

“Serena, you can’t—”

Before Leo could finish, Serena had already ended the call.

A fire ignited in his chest, and he felt an uncontrollable urge to explode. 

This woman—why does she always have this power to make him lose control so easily? 

If he could, he would walk away without a second thought. 

But he couldn’t leave her alone; he just couldn’t!

Serena was fully aware of this weakness of his, which gave her the audacity to push him like this!

Serena Zhou!!

This woman is not worth pity at all. He needed to punish her—hard!
