**The Sweetness of Love**

Serena Zhou was startled, instinctively covering herself as she turned to see Leo Sterling standing at the door. 

She paused, noting that Leo was just standing there, frozen at the threshold, not rushing in as she had half-expected. A flicker of disappointment passed through her eyes, but she quickly pulled the blanket from the bed around her shoulders. 

“Did you see what I wrote for you?” Serena asked, managing a small smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. The expression felt more like a ghost of joy, tinged with a deep sense of loneliness.

Leo leaned against the doorframe, his body awkwardly angled, as if he were caught in an uncomfortable moment. The emotions swirling in his gaze seemed to freeze in that instant, leaving him momentarily paralyzed by the unexpected scene he had stumbled upon.

Seeing his troubled expression caused Serena's heart to sink. If her current state of dress didn’t stir something in Leo, perhaps there was no point in forcing the situation any further.

“Sorry for scaring you!” she said, settling herself on the edge of the bed, wrapping the blanket tightly around her. She caught sight of Leo crumpling the note she had written him just moments earlier, and she guessed he might be there to end things between them.

In this heavy moment, Serena knew she had to maintain her composure. With a graceful yet strained smile, she said softly, “You came to talk to me, right? If you’d like to come in, please close the door. I’m not dressed very appropriately right now. If you prefer to talk outside, just please shut the door; I can change quickly!”

Leo’s rigid form finally relaxed as he turned to close the door behind him. Inside, Serena felt a pang of discomfort; she really didn’t want to be in a relationship-ending conversation while wearing such revealing lingerie. After all, this was her first love—albeit a rocky and short-lived one. Yet, she had tasted the sweetness of love, however fleeting it might have been.

Silence hung heavily between them. Serena’s gaze remained fixed on Leo, but he averted his eyes, as if he couldn’t bear to look at her or perhaps felt disdain. His reaction stung, and she sighed deeply within herself, whispering, “Maybe we should just go outside to talk.”

Leo tightened his grip on the note, his voice low, “What do you want to talk about?”

Serena frowned; she disliked the heavy atmosphere, as if everything might spiral out of control at any moment. “Everything I wanted to say is already written on that paper. Since you’ve seen it, you should know…”

Her gaze deepened with sincerity as she continued, “I’m really sorry. I didn’t expect to run into a student from your school, and especially one who… I know she must have said some outrageous things to you. I can’t advise you not to take her words to heart, given that she said them because of me…”

Though she didn’t need to ask, Serena could guess what Lila had said to Leo. If Lila mistakenly thought that Leo was merely a kept man for her, she would certainly try to pull him into her camp in any way she could. Leo had always had a bit of an aloof reputation at school, and being caught in the hills with a wealthy woman would surely make Lila think his aloofness was just an act. Consequently, the things Lila said to him would hardly be polite or respectful.

The thought of this made Serena wish she could strangle Lila. “I was too selfish before, only thinking of my own needs without considering your position. Even if I try to explain that we’re in a relationship, I doubt that girl would believe me. But rest assured…”

A chill flickered in Serena’s eyes as she added, “I’ve already spoken to her. She’ll keep this matter quiet and won’t spread rumors at your school.”

Leo looked surprised. “You talked to Lila?”

In truth, after returning to his room, he had already called someone to confront Lila. He hadn’t expected her to act so quickly…

Serena nodded, her tone soothing. “Yes, so you don’t need to worry about her. As for…”

She glanced at the crumpled note in Leo’s hand, her voice dropping to a serious tone. “I think there’s a significant gap between us. If you feel this is where it ends, I’ll accept it. I’ve already called Old Lin; he’ll come to pick me up soon. You can feel free to stay here and enjoy your time; maybe go hike a mountain in the morning to catch the sunrise or something…”

Saying this made Serena feel a wave of discomfort wash over her. She had genuinely anticipated this night and the sunrise, but never imagined it would end this way. And with Lila’s meddling, she couldn’t even find the words to plead for him to stay.

If she had known earlier how things would turn out, she wouldn’t have pushed to keep their entire weekend together!

Leo lowered his gaze, disbelief etched on his features. “Serena, you want to break up with me again?”

Serena’s mind raced, unsure how to interpret his use of “again.” All she could say was, “I just feel that separating now might be better and easier for you. If we stay together, you might face more situations like today that would upset you, and I don’t want to see you sad. Besides…”

She didn’t want to see Leo hurt by these issues, but she was even less interested in having to comfort him time and again. It was exhausting. All she wanted was a lighthearted, intimate relationship…

“…You seem really uncomfortable with the idea of me desiring you physically, but I’m not looking for a platonic relationship right now, so…”

“Where do you get the impression that I’m uncomfortable with that?” Leo’s tone grew urgent as he stepped closer, standing directly in front of Serena.

His tall figure seemed to envelop her entirely, and Serena tilted her head to meet his gaze, biting her lip in silence. 

Leo’s eyes burned with an intense fire, as if a storm was brewing within him. “I promised to give you an unforgettable night, and I will keep that promise…”

Though being mistaken for a kept man was humiliating, and Lila’s words had indeed ignited his temper, Serena was someone he genuinely wanted to be with. Her background and current predicament were beyond her control; he shouldn’t let his minor frustrations add to her burdens!

Even without the note she had written, after taking a shower alone in his room, Leo had realized a lot. Moreover, when he walked in and saw her dressed as she was…

In that moment, it had been one of the most shocking sights of his life, so much so that his heart was still racing, thoughts swirling in a heated haze, making it impossible for him to think clearly.

Leo tucked the note into his pocket and then reached out, grabbing Serena’s arm to lift her up. 

“Serena…” 

He leaned down, his voice husky, eyes blazing with desire. “Did you wear that… just for me?”
