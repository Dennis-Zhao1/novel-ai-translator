Ms. Meng was arrested. 

A lifetime...

When Serena Zhou said this, Leo Sterling's mood shifted to a bright one. He couldn't help but respond, "Yes, a lifetime... We should be together forever, never apart!"

They stood quietly by the roadside, embracing for a moment. Once Leo gathered his emotions, they got back in the car and continued on their way to his grandmother's house. 

Speaking of his grandmother, a smile spread across Leo’s face, and he began to speak animatedly. "My grandma dotes on me the most. When I was little, she took me everywhere. No matter what I wanted, she always bought it for me..." 

"Actually, besides General Sterling and Professor Lin, the other elders in my family treated me really well..." 

Even though his father didn't care much and his mother was absent, there were still many others who loved him. So Leo didn't feel like he had anything to lament.

"You'll see when you meet my grandma; she’s the kindest, most loving grandma in the world..."

"I can't wait to meet her..." Serena replied.

At a traffic light, Leo held Serena's hand, his face lit up with anticipation. "My grandma is definitely going to like you!"

Raising an eyebrow, Serena replied, a hint of confidence in her voice, "Of course, I’m loved by everyone!"

Suddenly, Serena's phone rang; it was her sister, Dai. 

"Sis? What... Slow down, what's going on? What!! I’m coming back right now..."

Serena's face turned pale as she hung up the phone. She quickly turned to Leo and said, "I'm sorry, Leo, Ms. Meng is in trouble. I need to rush back to Qianhai immediately. I'll come with you to meet Grandma next time..."

"...Leo, stop at the next intersection!" 

While speaking to Leo, Serena's fingers flew over her phone screen, typing rapidly. 

Instead of stopping, Leo turned the car around. 

Glancing outside the window, Serena looked surprised for a moment before calming down. "You don’t need to take me to the airport; I can go back by myself..."

Although Leo didn't know exactly what had happened, he could see the worry etched on Serena's face after that phone call. He knew something serious must have occurred. 

"I’m going back with you!" he insisted. 

Once Serena finished replying to her sister's message, she said, "No, it's related to Ms. Meng being arrested. I found out it’s connected to the case involving my parents... Someone with ulterior motives decided to stir things up at this time. Ms. Meng will have to spend the New Year in detention, so you don’t have to come back. If we need to pull strings at the city government... it’ll have to wait until after the holiday."

"I'm sorry, Leo. Even if I may not be able to help by going back, I have to go..." 

They had prepared extensively for this trip to meet family, and now... 

Leo was taken aback. "Ms. Meng was arrested?"

Serena, initially shocked and flustered, regained her composure. She nodded and gritted her teeth, "This must have something to do with... Duan Kangyu!" 

Just before the New Year, Serena had used her connections to have a prison guard put Tang Ying in solitary confinement for three days. Duan Kangyu treated Tang Ying like his own daughter and had someone watching over her. How could he tolerate her being punished like that?

Unfortunately, the person Duan Kangyu found had been threatened by Serena using what she had obtained from the Qianai Club. 

Serena was now in a direct confrontation with Duan Kangyu. It was a matter of who would break first—the Zhou family’s CEO or the Donglou’s chairman—one of them was bound to lose their position. 

Perhaps even more than that!

Leo was puzzled, "How could your parents' case be connected to Ms. Meng? Serena, what exactly is going on?" 

This was a tragedy Serena never wanted to revisit in her life. 

"I'm sorry, Leo. I don’t want to talk about the connection between my parents and Ms. Meng... I just can’t!" 

Those past events were covered in a thick layer of painful dust that Serena didn’t want to unearth. 

More than a decade had passed, and she had not been able to seek justice for her parents. Now, it seemed like Ms. Meng might fall victim as well... 

She truly didn’t want to face her own helplessness!

Leo looked at her with concern. He understood her reluctance to revisit past pain. So he remained silent as he drove her to the airport. 

Throughout the journey, Serena received and made numerous calls, replying to countless messages. 

Upon arriving at the airport, she rushed to enter. 

Leo insisted on going back with her. 

Serena firmly refused, "I’m going to be extremely busy this New Year. Even if you come back with me, I probably won’t have time to pay attention to you. So just go back and spend the New Year with Grandma. And please tell her I'm sorry, I’ll come next time..."

Suddenly, Serena stopped speaking. She leaned into Leo’s embrace, holding him tightly. 

After a moment, she pushed him away, her expression calm as clouds after a storm. 

She smiled at Leo and said, "I have to go now, Leo. Happy New Year! You should go back!" 

Leo was reluctant to let her go, "Then... I'll come back after spending the first day of the New Year with Grandma!" 

Serena nodded, replying with a soft "Mm." 

Then, decisively, she let go of Leo and waved goodbye with a smile. 

"I'm leaving now, bye-bye!" 

Once Serena arrived in Qianhai, Lin Cheng and Dai were already waiting at the airport. 

As soon as they got in the car, Dai said, "We haven’t been able to find out what the police mean by 'solid' evidence yet, but your parents' case happened fifteen years ago. If they don’t have real evidence, I doubt they would dare to make such a bold move right before the holidays." 

"The only question is how they found such solid evidence..." 

After getting into the car, Serena sent a message to Leo to let him know she arrived safely. 

After a brief silence, she added, "It’s also possible that the police didn’t find it themselves. It’s been fifteen years; they haven't investigated the case in ages. It’s unlikely they suddenly found anything. Moreover..." 

Serena knew very well that Ms. Meng wasn’t the one who killed her parents! 

"Have you contacted Director Pei?" 

Dai nodded, "I couldn’t reach him." 

Whether it was Pei Zhuang or Yan Jiajun, both had been offended by Serena in the past. At a time like this, it was completely normal for them to ignore her. 

After a moment of silence, Serena decided to call Duan Kangyu. 

It went unanswered. 

Serena asked Dai, "Do you know where Duan Kangyu is?" 

Dai replied, "He’s at Donglou." 

Serena then turned to Lin Cheng, "Old Lin, take me to Donglou." 

Dai looked a bit worried, "Are you sure you want to see Duan Kangyu at this time? Do you suspect him..." 

Suspect? 

What was there to suspect? 

When Serena arrived at Donglou, she didn’t have an appointment. But Huang Liang was waiting for her at the entrance. 

Clearly, Duan Kangyu knew she would come to find him. 

"Miss Zhou, please..." 

At that moment, all the employees of Donglou Group had already gone home for the holidays, leaving only a few cleaning and security staff behind. 

Huang Liang opened the special elevator for Duan Kangyu, bowing and gesturing for her to enter. 

Serena walked in alone and headed straight to Duan Kangyu’s office. 

The employee area was bright and spacious. As soon as she stepped out of the elevator, she could hear the sounds of moans coming from Duan Kangyu’s office at the end of the floor...
