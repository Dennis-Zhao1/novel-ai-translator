I Can Raise Several Like Him  

Mentioning Duan Kangyu, Serena Zhou's expression turned slightly uneasy. To prevent Leo Sterling from noticing, she wrapped her arms around him from behind, resting her face against his back, exuding all the charm of a little girl seeking affection.  

“Leo, even though I'm a bit hungry right now, I'm really satisfied and happy tonight... I owe it all to you. Thank you for being by my side!”  

Leo was puzzled by Serena’s sudden bout of sentimentality. He thought perhaps Duan Kangyu had arranged some sort of “surprise” or unexpected incident for her, which had dredged up some unpleasant memories.  

Gently, he said, “Sorry, I didn’t mean to bring up Duan Kangyu…”  

“It’s fine. Duan Kangyu isn’t some taboo subject. Besides, he hasn’t done anything weird to me tonight…”  

Duan Kangyu’s attitude towards Serena had been erratic lately—sometimes warm, sometimes cold—making his emotions difficult to read. It had been a long time since he had tried to manipulate her or set traps to control her behavior. As for tonight, Lin Cheng had texted earlier to say that Duan Kangyu's car was still parked outside Leo’s apartment building.  

But so what? Duan Kangyu, high and mighty, would never stoop to ruining her good time. After all, letting her keep a toy boy was one of the conditions for their engagement. He wouldn’t do anything to undermine his own interests, and Serena didn’t think she was important enough for him to care about.  

So, he could stay wherever he wanted; she just wanted to enjoy sweet moments with her little wolf cub.  

After the Qixi Festival, Leo returned to school, and Serena was swept back into the whirlwind of work. Every day brought an endless list of tasks and unavoidable social obligations.  

One day, her colleague Dai Jie informed her that the business contacts had learned about Yan Jiajia’s illness, and in order to avoid harassment from them, Yan had checked into the hospital. Now, no one could reach her.  

“The business people couldn’t find Yan Jiajia, so they went to find Yan Jiajun instead.”  

Two days later, Dai Jie told Serena that Shang Ruzhen and Yan Jiajun had gotten into an argument. Yan Jiajun refused to see Shang Ruzhen anymore. The old man from the business family had personally come to visit the Yan family today.  

No sooner had Dai Jie finished relaying this news than Serena received a call from an unknown number.  

She couldn’t guess whether it would be someone from the business or Yan Jiajun on the other end, so she took a deep breath, composed herself, and answered in a serious tone, “Hello?”  

On the other end was a distorted male voice, processed through a voice changer. “Hello, Ms. Zhou. Your loved one is in our hands.”  

Serena’s eyes widened in disbelief, her brows knitting together in surprise. She never expected that before she could extort someone else, she would first be extorted herself.  

Determined not to show fear and avoid being passive, she coldly replied, “You have the wrong number. I don’t have a loved one,” and hung up.  

Quickly, she picked up the landline phone on her desk and set it aside. Then, without hesitation, she dialed Duan Kangyu’s number.  

It rang for a long time before he finally picked up. “Serena?”  

Her expression darkened, but her voice remained soft and obedient as always. “Good morning, Uncle Duan… I just wanted to talk to you. Um… I was wondering if you’d like to have lunch with me today. Do you have time?”  

Duan Kangyu declined, as she expected.  

While she was on the phone with him, Dai Jie was also in touch with one of Leo's classmates. She learned that Leo had gone to the experimental field with his mentor. Dai Jie asked that classmate to help get in touch with the mentor.  

After a while, the classmate called back, saying the mentor's phone went unanswered. Just as Serena hung up from her call with Duan Kangyu, that unknown number called again.  

The voice was still distorted, but it sounded more furious than before. “Ms. Zhou, Leo is in our hands!”  

Serena replied coolly, “Oh? And?”  

The caller seemed taken aback by her calm reaction and paused for a moment. “Ms. Zhou, if you don’t want to see Leo come to harm, please prepare ten million in cash by the end of the day…”  

“Ten million?” Serena interrupted, her tone steady. “You have quite the appetite. But I think you’ve miscalculated. I could raise several like him with ten million.”  

“Are you trying to bargain with us by putting your toy boy’s life on the line?”  

Serena replied, “You think too highly of me. I’m not that idle. I’ve already reported this to the police, so you better think carefully!”  

With that, she hung up decisively and turned off her phone.  

Meanwhile, Dai Jie was still in contact with Leo’s classmate.  

“Ms. Zhou, that classmate is on his way to the experimental field now. He should be back in about half an hour. Do you think this could be…?”  

The timing of Leo’s kidnapping and extortion was too suspicious. Serena felt a bit flustered, unsure of who was behind this scheme.  

But rather than the business people or Yan Jiajun, she leaned more towards believing it was Duan Kangyu…  

Just as she furrowed her brows in thought, Dai Jie received another call and said to Serena, “Ms. Zhou, the old man from the Shang family has arrived. He’s downstairs.”  

At this news, Serena’s dark eyes brightened slightly.  

Shang Xuehai had come first… Serena took a deep breath to gather her spirits.  

Before long, Shang Xuehai and his entourage arrived outside Serena’s office. In the past, she would have personally waited at the elevator to greet him. But this time, she remained seated in her office until Dai Jie brought him in before she put on a smile and stood to welcome him.  

“Uncle, what brings you here? Please, have a seat. Dai Jie, get some tea!”  

Serena respectfully greeted Shang Xuehai and exchanged pleasantries before asking, “You could have just called if you had something to discuss, so why come all the way here?”  

At nearly eighty, Shang Xuehai was still in good health and looked vigorous, walking without the need for a cane like Serena’s grandfather.  

However, he was known for being two-faced, unpredictable, and somewhat petty. Previously, he’d always appeared amiable towards Serena, but today, his expression was serious, and his gaze was heavy.  

With a cold “hmph,” Shang Xuehai said, “If I hadn’t come in person, would you, Ms. Zhou, back off?”  

Serena kept her smile intact but thought to herself: Even if you came in person, I wouldn’t back down.  

Yet her tone remained respectful, “What do you mean by that, Uncle?”  

Shang Xuehai’s eyes narrowed as he retorted, “Stop playing innocent, Serena. I know everything the Shang family has suffered recently is due to you manipulating things behind the scenes. Your methods aren’t very clever.”  

Serena’s smile faded slightly. “If you believe that, do you think I’m the one framing the Shang family?”  

Shang Xuehai glared at her fiercely. “The facts speak for themselves; you can’t deny it.”  

Serena simply replied with an “oh,” neither confirming nor denying, and asked, “So, why are you here to see me today?”  

Shang Xuehai didn’t beat around the bush. “I know the valuable item that went missing from Qianai Club is in your possession. Let’s cut to the chase: what do you want in exchange for its return?”  

Serena raised an eyebrow, feigning surprise. “It seems the item you lost is quite precious. But unfortunately, Uncle, it’s not in my hands!”  

Shang Xuehai didn’t take Serena’s insincere denial seriously. He continued, “Are you planning to keep it for trading with Gu Jiajun?”
