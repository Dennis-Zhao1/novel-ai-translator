**Title: The One Who Holds My Heart**

Serena Zhou didn’t dare bring Leo Sterling to meet her grandfather at that moment. Instead, she gently comforted him, “Be good, little Leo. Just wait for your sister at home. As long as Grandpa doesn’t break my legs tonight, I promise I’ll come find you…”

Leo couldn’t hide his disappointment, feeling a bit aggrieved as he replied, “I think I hear the word ‘wait’ come from you the most…”

Serena raised an eyebrow in surprise, “Really? More than when I say, ‘Sister loves you’ or ‘Little Leo is amazing’?”

Leo couldn’t stand it when Serena teased him like that, and whenever she got playful, he found himself getting flustered. Swallowing his yearning, he looked seriously at Serena and asked, “Serena, can I post a picture of us holding hands in my circle?”

Serena blinked, understanding that he felt suffocated by the secrecy of their relationship. “Sure…” she said, “as long as I don’t have to show my face, you can take pictures of any part of my body and post them!”

With that, the atmosphere turned playfully heated again.

Sometimes, Leo really wanted to have a serious heart-to-heart with Serena. But she always had the knack for twisting their atmosphere into something charged and spicy with just a few words.

“Besides my hands and face, the rest of my body can only be seen by me. If anyone else dares to look, I’ll gouge out their eyes…” 

Leo took out his phone, holding Serena’s hand tightly as he adjusted the angle and settings, making sure to position the bracelet he had given her—engraved with the initials of her name—just right. He took several shots in quick succession.

“Choose one…” 

After Leo finished taking the photos, he handed the phone to Serena. 

Just as Serena took the phone, a friend request notification popped up at the top of the screen: “Senior, I’m the girl from the English department who asked for directions that day (my measurements are 36, 24, 36), please accept me!”

The message was accompanied by an adorably shy emoji.

Serena stared blankly at the message, bewildered. What kind of friend request comes with measurements?

Her expression darkened instantly as she turned the phone screen towards Leo, angrily demanding, “Explain this! What is it?”

Leo glanced at the screen, confused by the sudden shift in Serena’s demeanor. “What do you mean? What’s wrong?” 

He thought she was referring to the photo. Peering closer at the screen, he couldn’t see anything off.

Serena turned the phone back to herself and tapped the screen a couple of times. As she searched for the friend request, she noticed that Leo hadn’t even added her on this social app.

A strange thought flickered through her mind. *Leo actually has a separate account for flirting with other girls!!!*

Serena’s anger flared up in an instant. “You dare mess around behind my back, Leo?!”

Leo quickly scanned the social app’s page and his expression changed. Seeing Serena’s furious face made him want to laugh. He grabbed her hand and explained, “I’m not messing around! This account is just for socializing. The people I’ve added are all teachers and students from our school. As for that girl who sent me a request… I’ve rejected her several times!”

He tightened his grip on Serena’s hand, adding, “It’s all your fault, you know. Those girls think I’m available, so they keep trying to get my attention…”

Seeing Serena’s eyes widen, Leo quickly added, “But my heart only belongs to you, Sister! Even if they throw themselves at me, I won’t be swayed. If you don’t believe me…”

He raised his chin, gesturing for Serena to check his contacts, “You can see for yourself if I have any random girls added!”

“I don’t have a habit of invading others' privacy…” 

Serena opened the request history and saw that Leo had indeed rejected that girl multiple times. How could she forget how attractive he was? But still, it was surprising that girls could be so persistent, trying to add him even after being turned down so many times.

Leo couldn’t help but find Serena’s furious expression incredibly cute. He reached out and gently pinched her cheek. “Sister, I love seeing you jealous. It’s so adorable!”

“Jealous?” Serena denied vehemently. “I just hate it when someone has their eyes on what’s mine…”

“Well, you better keep a close eye on me because I’m quite the catch…” 

Serena, always competitive by nature, felt her determination rise at Leo’s declaration. She lifted her chin proudly, her voice resonating with confidence, “Don’t worry, once I’ve claimed what’s mine, it’s forever mine. Unless I decide I don’t want it anymore, you’ll never escape!”

Seeing Serena so self-assured filled Leo with warmth. He smiled, “Got it! I’ll always be yours. As for anyone else… I won’t give them the chance to compete with you. I’ll take good care of myself!”

Serena felt reassured by Leo’s moral integrity and values.

“It’s good that you’re aware. If you’re not…”

Serena leaned closer to Leo and playfully bit his neck, whispering, “I’ll just bite down on your carotid artery and drain your blood!”

The moment she said the word “drain,” Leo’s heart suddenly thumped wildly in his chest. Damn it! 

Taking a few deep breaths, he realized that continuing this line of conversation would only leave him more flustered. He quickly redirected, “So, have you chosen a photo? If you pick one, I’ll post it with this account, and hopefully, there won’t be any more random requests coming in!”

Serena looked over the photos but couldn’t see much difference between them, so she randomly picked one and handed it back to him. “Let’s go with this one. Your hand looks almost the same size as mine…”

It was quite strange. His fingers were so fair and slender for a guy, while hers were short and dark for a girl.

“Okay, this one it is…” Leo said, taking the phone back and fiddling with it. He soothingly added, “Your hands are beautiful, Sister. My photography skills are just lacking. Once I learn more, I’ll make sure to capture your fingers looking delicate, long, and pale…”

Serena pursed her lips, “Once you’ve mastered photography, you only want to photograph my fingers?”

The conversation took a turn again.

Leo’s ears turned red as he glanced at Serena, following her lead, “Understood. Once I’ve learned, I’ll take some different kinds of pictures of you…”

Serena wrapped her arms around Leo’s neck, teasing, “Little Leo, you’re getting better at this…”

After Leo selected the picture and posted it, declaring he was off the market, he finally set his phone down, wrapped his arms around Serena, and kissed her a couple of times. “Sister, what kind of path are you leading me down? I feel like I’m getting more and more lost on this journey with you.”
