**A Token of Gratitude**

Serena Zhou shifted her right arm, which was encased in a plaster cast around her neck, and spoke softly, “I’m Serena Zhou. Thank you for saving me that day!”

Leo Sterling's eyes brightened, but his voice carried a hint of uncertainty. “You... are you the young lady who was in that car accident on Shutong Road?”

Serena smiled and nodded. 

Leo glanced at Serena’s injured arm, a mix of surprise and concern in his tone. “You were discharged so soon? Your hand…”

“It’s just a fracture, nothing serious. I’ll be fine in ten days or so!” Serena replied casually, as if a broken bone were nothing more than a minor scrape.

Leo was taken aback. He remembered the sight of her blood-soaked face that day and thought she might have been seriously hurt. He never expected it was just her hand.

“You looked pretty frightening with all that blood on your face. I thought…”

“Yeah, about that day—I really owe you my life. If you hadn’t rushed me to the hospital, I might not just have a broken hand; I could have been meeting the Grim Reaper instead of you right now. I really don’t know how to repay you for this kindness!”

Serena’s sincerity was palpable, her tone earnest.

Leo felt a wave of embarrassment wash over him. “I didn’t do anything; you don’t need to be so polite!”

“But you saved my life! How can you say you didn’t do anything?”

With a shift in tone, Serena continued, “Um… I prepared a small gift in my car, but I can’t lift it. Could you…?”

She turned to open the trunk of her car, gesturing for Leo to come closer and help her with the token of gratitude.

This made Leo feel even more awkward. “Miss Zhou, you really don’t need to go to such lengths…”

Despite his protests, he found himself walking over. After all, when someone does a good deed, it’s natural to hope for some acknowledgment, even if that recognition isn’t the goal of the good deed itself.

“What is this…?” Leo stared in surprise at the large gift box in the spacious trunk of her SUV.

Serena beamed, “I didn’t know what you would like, so I picked something from my brother’s collection as a token of my appreciation. I hope you can accept it!”

Leo frowned slightly. Items from collections are usually quite valuable. He pondered for a moment before politely declining.

“Your brother’s collection… I really don’t think I can accept this. I’m sorry!”

A flicker of disappointment crossed Serena’s eyes as she replied softly, “You don’t need to feel burdened. This item is heavy but not expensive. Besides, my brother has plenty of collectibles, and he doesn’t mind me giving them away.”

Serena gestured for Leo to try lifting the box. “Why don’t you see if you can manage? If not, I’ll have to send it to your home. But my driver had to leave for an urgent matter, so do you drive? If you don’t… we’ll have to wait for the driver to come back or call for a ride.”

Leo’s surprise returned, but he still felt it was inappropriate. Serena didn’t expect that expressing her gratitude would be so challenging. She lowered her head, her voice softening, “I feel like my life is priceless. You saved me, and whatever I give you feels trivial in comparison. Did you really think my life is worth less than a collectible?!”

Leo hadn’t anticipated Serena would take it this way and hurried to explain, “Miss Zhou, you’ve misunderstood. I didn’t mean it like that…”

Serena looked up at him, her big innocent eyes wide with curiosity. “Then what did you mean?”

Her vulnerable expression left Leo at a loss. 

“I… I just think it’s inappropriate!”

“What do you think would be appropriate then? Should I make a banner to send to your school tomorrow?”

“Please don’t! That would be too much!” 

He was already well-known at the school and preferred to keep a low profile, not wanting any additional attention.

Serena stared at him quietly. “Then…”

Seeing her persistence, Leo reluctantly relented.

“Alright, I’ll accept your token of gratitude. Thank you!”

Serena’s face lit up with joy. “I should be the one thanking you! Now, let’s see if you can lift it!”

Leo tried lifting the box; he could manage it, but carrying such a large package home was indeed a challenge.

Noticing his struggle, Serena asked again, “Do you drive?”

Leo glanced at Serena’s car, hesitating. “I can drive, but I’m not very skilled. This car… it looks expensive.”

“I’m not sure; it’s my brother’s!”

Serena closed the trunk and signaled Leo to get in. “But don’t worry about it; if you scratch it, it’s on me.”

Leo chuckled nervously. “Now I’m even more anxious!”

Despite his trepidation, he climbed into the driver’s seat.

“Luckily, my place isn’t far…” 

Not just far—it was practically next door. From the moment the engine started to when it was turned off, it didn’t take more than five minutes.

Serena was stunned. The information from her assistant clearly stated he lived in the West City.

“We’ve arrived,” Leo announced, unbuckling his seatbelt as he stepped out.

Serena followed suit, rushing to help him retrieve the box from the back of the SUV. 

It took Leo considerable effort to pull the beautifully wrapped box out, now somewhat misshapen due to his struggle.

“I’m sorry about the box…” Leo said sheepishly.

“The box isn’t important!” Serena looked up at the tall building ahead of them and asked, “Which floor do you live on? Can you carry it up by yourself?”

Leo pointed to the nearby elevator. “Yes, there’s a direct elevator!”

“Great! It’s getting late, so you should hurry back and rest!”

But Leo didn’t move. He glanced at Serena’s plastered arm and suddenly asked, “How are you planning to get back?”

Serena hesitated, then pulled out her phone to call her driver, smiling as she said, “I’ll have my driver come pick me up.”

Accidentally pressing the speakerphone, a robotic voice immediately responded, “The number you dialed is turned off…”

Feeling embarrassed, Serena explained, “My driver probably ran out of battery. I’ll just find a ride!”

She began searching for a ride service number.

Leo hesitated, then decided, “It might be hard to get a ride here. Why don’t I help you get home after I drop this gift off?”

“That would be too much trouble.”

Though she said that, Serena quickly tucked her phone away.

Leo noticed her actions and smiled slightly. “It’s nothing; consider it a small gesture of gratitude for your generous gift.”

“Then please wait here for a moment while I take this box upstairs and come right back.”

He bent down, struggling to lift the large box toward the elevator. Serena’s wide eyes followed his every move, and she murmured an agreement, “Okay.”
