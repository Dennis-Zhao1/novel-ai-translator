**I’m Waiting for You to Come Back**

Speaking of the red envelopes, Leo said, “My grandmother really prepared one for you... Also, the envelopes from my parents and my aunt for you are still in my car. I’ll bring them to you when I come back the day after tomorrow!”

The day after tomorrow… would he really be able to return?

Serena tightened her grip on her phone, her fingers pressing so hard that the tips turned pale and slightly blue. 

She responded softly, “I’ll wait for you to come back…”

Serena spent the New Year in the hospital with her brother, Jason.

On the first day of the New Year, she was already busy with Mrs. Meng’s case.

Later that afternoon, Leo called to inform her that his grandmother had suddenly fallen ill, and he would need to stay in Qingheng City for a few more days.

It was expected.

Serena encouraged him to take good care of his grandmother and to stay in Qingheng as long as necessary. After all, Mrs. Meng’s case wasn’t urgent.

Leo apologized, saying, “I’m really sorry, Serena. I had promised you, but my grandmother’s situation is quite critical… I’ve already contacted the head of the Jian Law Firm, and they agreed to defend the case. Don’t wear yourself out; I’ll come back as soon as my grandmother stabilizes!”

The Jian Law Firm dispatched an experienced lawyer who had never lost a case as soon as they returned to work on the seventh day of the New Year. After understanding the situation, he told Serena that the evidence the police obtained before the New Year was very unfavorable for Mrs. Meng. 

Moreover, due to the fact that Mrs. Meng’s brother was now a high-ranking official in Hengxue City, to avoid any conflict of interest, the prosecution would be brought forth by the Qianhai police. However, Serena had offended a crucial figure within the Qianhai judicial system—Pei Zhuang!

“Excuse me, Ms. Zhou, I actually have a question that I hope you can clarify?” 

Serena knew what Jian Shu wanted to ask. After all, Mrs. Meng was currently arrested as a major suspect in the murder of her parents. Yet, she had hired the top defense attorney team, which certainly piqued Jian Shu's curiosity about her intentions.

Jian Shu continued, “Fifteen years ago, when the incident happened, you were also present at the scene, right? At that time, you…”

Serena was only nine years old when her parents were poisoned to death. That day, her parents had taken her camping in the countryside. When she returned with a bucket full of crabs, bubbling with joy, she found her parents lying dead in the tent, blood flowing from their noses and mouths.

The police investigation revealed that someone had poisoned the food they had brought along. Several families had camped together with Serena, but most were friends of her parents or parents of her classmates, along with neighbors from their apartment complex. The tents were spaced relatively far apart. 

Before her parents succumbed to their poisoning, many of them visited each other, and the children ran around wildly. Everyone present that day became a suspect, and the police conducted an in-depth investigation on all attendees, but came up empty-handed.

The police at the time believed the primary suspect to be Mrs. Meng since she had a motive, and she had met with Serena's father alone the day before they went camping. They had even argued at a café.

Her father and Mrs. Meng had never divorced because she wouldn’t agree to it. She had once told Serena's mother, “Let’s see who wears the other down first!” 

However, at the time of the incident, although Mrs. Meng was in Hengxue, she had enough of an alibi to avoid suspicion. If she had hired someone to kill them, there was no evidence connecting her to the group camping that day.

The case remained unsolved for over a decade.

Now, Mrs. Meng had been arrested because, while investigating a theft case, the Hengxue police apprehended a thief who, during interrogation, revealed he used to be a security guard in the apartment complex where Serena’s parents lived. 

According to the thief’s testimony, the night before the camping trip, he deliberately disabled the complex’s surveillance cameras around two in the morning and broke into Serena’s parents’ apartment to steal some belongings. Before he entered, he saw a beautiful woman sneak out of the house.

The thief couldn’t identify the woman, but he knew she wasn’t the homeowner since the homeowner was pure and delicate, with an ethereal presence. The security guards all agreed she was the most beautiful woman in the entire complex. 

Outraged, the thief thought to himself that the male homeowner was worthless for cheating on such a pure and beautiful wife. 

After the beautiful woman left, the thief visited the home of Serena’s parents. They used a rudimentary password lock, and the thief had memorized the code when he happened to see Serena input it.

After successfully stealing from them, he wiped his fingerprints off the lock. 

If it were only the thief’s testimony, it wouldn’t be enough for the police to detain Mrs. Meng. But at that moment, an anonymous package arrived containing a video tape showing Mrs. Meng purchasing rat poison the afternoon before Serena’s parents were murdered.

The tape included footage from the community surveillance cameras, capturing Mrs. Meng entering and leaving the building. 

With these two pieces of evidence, along with the thief’s statement, the police arrested Mrs. Meng. The evidence was heavily stacked against her. 

Despite Mrs. Meng claiming she bought the rat poison to take her own life and that she went to Serena’s parents’ home that night only to deliver the divorce agreement, the police did not believe her.

There were many ways to end one’s life; why specifically buy rat poison? And how coincidental that her parents were poisoned the very next evening after she bought it? 

Also, the divorce agreement could have been delivered at any time; why go in the middle of the night?

Mrs. Meng insisted that she had added the rat poison to her drink and intended to take it to Hengjiang, but she accidentally dropped the drink into the river. She had been so desperate that she genuinely planned to end her life. 

But ultimately, she couldn’t shake off her concern for Jason and decided against it.

To the police, Mrs. Meng's explanations sounded like futile excuses. 

Even if Serena knew everything she said was true, it wouldn’t change anything; she couldn’t provide evidence to prove Mrs. Meng’s innocence. 

As for Jian Shu’s question, Serena replied, “I was at the scene when my parents died from poisoning, but I can hardly remember many details now…”

At that time, she had been too devastated and shocked; when she cried and rushed towards her parents, someone had held her back tightly.

“…And because I am both a relative of the suspect and of the victims, even if I know Mrs. Meng is innocent, I cannot testify in court!”

Jian Shu raised an eyebrow slightly, “You believe Mrs. Meng is innocent?”

Serena pulled out a thick stack of documents and handed them over to Jian Shu. 

“I have never stopped investigating the truth behind my parents’ poisoning… These materials are what I’ve gathered over the years. If Mr. Jian is interested, feel free to browse, but they won’t help Mrs. Meng’s case much…”

“…Because these materials point even more directly to Mrs. Meng!”

Jian Shu flipped through the documents, confusion growing. 

“Since you, Ms. Zhou, have investigated this and your materials point to Mrs. Meng, why do you still…”

Serena's gaze turned serious, and she replied calmly, “Because I believe in Mrs. Meng. I believe she went to deliver the divorce agreement that night, and I believe she bought the rat poison to end her life…”

…Also because she knew the truth, she knew who the real culprit was! 

Jian Shu recalled the previous case files he had reviewed, “But the case files never mentioned that a divorce agreement was found in your home…”
