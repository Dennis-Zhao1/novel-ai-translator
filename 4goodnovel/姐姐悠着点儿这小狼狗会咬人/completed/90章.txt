"You're going to break up with him." 

General Sterling was momentarily stunned, and after a beat, he let out a cold snort, his voice laced with anger. "You have some nerve to come to my home and say such things to my face! Where do you get the audacity to threaten my family like this?"

Serena Zhou remained unflustered, responding coolly, "Of course, it comes from your sister and brother-in-law..." 

She then reached into her small handbag, pulling out a few items and placing them into the gift box.

"...These are all pieces of evidence showing that Adam Song poisoned my parents, incited threats against Xia Xiuhe to deliberately get close to my brother, and even committed arson against my family, framing Ms. Meng to send her to prison. If you're interested, General Sterling, you can take a look. If not, or if you already know about it..."

Serena smiled lightly, appearing quite obedient. "...then we can talk about our future cooperation."

General Sterling's expression remained cold, and from his demeanor, Serena was unable to tell whether he knew about these matters or if he had any involvement at all. His indifferent gaze swept over the so-called evidence she had laid out.

His voice was frigid as he asked, "Did you get together with my son just to show me these things?"

Serena hesitated slightly. "Yes."

General Sterling’s eyes sharpened, and he gritted his teeth, his voice turning icy. "What kind of cooperation are you looking for?"

"Look, General Sterling, I just want Adam Song to face justice for his crimes..." 

"Don't you just want his life?"

"I initially only wanted his life, but since you insist on colluding with the Duan family and making Ms. Meng take the blame, I can’t settle for just that anymore..."

A chilling glint flashed in General Sterling's eyes. "From the way you speak, it seems you think this will be easy?"

Serena replied coldly, "If it weren't for the Sterling family standing behind him, Adam Song would have been imprisoned four years ago..."

Six years ago, with the help of her brother, Serena had established a private detective agency. The two siblings worked together to uncover the truth behind the poisoning of their father and Serena's biological mother. They spent two years gathering evidence that linked Adam Song to the murders, but just as they submitted their findings to the police, a fire broke out at the station, destroying all the evidence.

Fortunately, Serena had the foresight to keep a backup of everything she gathered, which she had submitted instead. However, after that incident, she could no longer afford to file a lawsuit without thorough consideration, even though they had approached the head of the police department, who happened to be her brother's uncle. Yet, tragedies like "fire" could happen all too easily at the police station, which was alarming.

After that, her uncle, Secretary Meng, inexplicably became embroiled in factional struggles and nearly lost his position. Serena was framed in a scandal involving adult entertainment that dragged on for almost a year. Meanwhile, a girl named Xia Xiuhe appeared around her brother, manipulating his heart and pocketbook while causing the family business to near collapse.

Before Serena returned to Qianhai, she had nearly uncovered all of Adam Song’s secrets and realized that pursuing justice through normal legal channels would be futile. Even underhanded tactics proved ineffective, as Adam, being a renowned neurosurgeon for the military, was untouchable.

He was protected within an impenetrable fortress. Unless that fortress crumbled or ceased to protect him, no one could take his life.

Serena knew she didn't have the power to topple the Sterling family, which left her with no option but to find another way. For instance, getting close to Leo Sterling, and subsequently, General Sterling...

To be able to sit in front of General Sterling today, Serena had prepared meticulously.

General Sterling said, "If Adam Song is truly as guilty as you claim... he can die, but he cannot be judged or imprisoned. And you..."

His gaze was sharp, cutting through the tension like a knife, instilling fear. 

"...You’re using my son. Such tactics are despicable. While I usually don’t interfere in his life, a woman as cunning as you doesn’t deserve to enter the Sterling family. I want you to break up with him!"

Serena’s eyes dimmed, the sparkle fading. "It seems you’ve misunderstood, General. I didn’t come here to take orders from you, but rather to ask for your cooperation..."

General Sterling's brow furrowed slightly, showing his impatience and disbelief.

Undeterred by his dark expression, Serena continued calmly, "Adam Song poisoned my parents. This enmity cannot be overlooked, and I must have blood for blood. General, by cleaning up after Adam's wrongdoings, you’re aiding and abetting him. If it weren’t for my good fortune, the Zhou family would have been destroyed. Adam is a monster, and you are not innocent either; you too must pay the appropriate price..."

General Sterling’s anger flared, narrowing his eyes. "Are you threatening my sister’s life?"

Serena met his gaze steadily and spoke softly. "I want her to stop committing evil. After our cooperation, I want the Zhou family to be able to exist peacefully!"

"Just based on what you have in hand?"

Serena corrected him, "I’m not relying solely on these items; I’m relying on your only son’s love for me..."

General Sterling's expression remained largely unchanged, but his jaw clenched tightly.

Serena maintained her calm tone, unhurried. "If you refuse to cooperate or lack sincerity, making my objective unattainable, then I will have no choice but to enter the Sterling family and resolve everything behind closed doors..."

General Sterling’s disbelief turned into a sudden sharpness in his voice, "You dare to threaten me?! The Sterling family is not a place you can just enter!"

Serena’s demeanor remained soft yet her voice took on an audacious edge. "If you’re not afraid of ruining your only son, I would be more than happy to take that gamble with you..."

As she spoke, she pulled out her phone and played a recording. It was a conversation from earlier this year where his sister, Mei, threatened Serena to terminate her pregnancy and break up with Leo.

The more General Sterling listened, the angrier he became. 

Serena added, "Leo doesn’t know I was once pregnant with his child, but due to your coercion, I lost it..."

"If he finds out, he’ll feel so guilty..."

"Despite lacking parental love, he grew up to be a decent and responsible man..."

"If I were to propose marriage now, I believe he would agree..."

"Even if you all oppose it, I doubt it would matter, since he’s always been distant from you; the only one who could sway his decision would likely be his grandmother..."

"But she is getting old and in poor health. I doubt General Sterling would be so unfilial as to tell the elderly lady that her beloved grandson is marrying a woman who doesn’t love him, who only seeks to use him, and has ulterior motives against the entire Sterling family..."
