"Goodnight, my sister, I love you."

Serena Zhou didn't return to the company that day; instead, she drove herself to the university. She didn't call Leo Sterling; instead, she sat at the entrance of the campus, waiting for him. It felt just like the early days when she first started pursuing him. Back then, she had a good sense of when he would show up, so her wait was usually brief. But today, she sat there for over three hours, waiting for Leo.

Serena didn't really have anything pressing to do; she just missed him. She longed for his clean, refreshing scent, the sight of his handsome face that always made her heart flutter, and his tall, energetic frame.

“Leo…”

Serena rushed into Leo's embrace, inhaling his fresh, pleasant scent. In that moment, she felt an overwhelming surge of vitality and hope flooding back into her. Ever since they officially started dating, she hadn't waited for him at the university again.

Leo was pleasantly surprised to see her. He held her tightly for a moment before gently asking, “What are you doing here? When did you arrive? Why didn't you call me? Have you been waiting long?”

As he led Serena away from the campus, a flurry of questions left her feeling a bit dazed. She shook her head softly, looking pitiful as she replied, “Leo, I’m hungry. I don’t have any social engagements tonight. Can you make me something delicious?”

“What do you want to eat?” he asked.

Serena pondered for a moment and said, “Spicy crayfish!”

Leo was an excellent cook, but he didn’t particularly enjoy preparing overly strong-flavored dishes. Nonetheless, he never turned down her requests, no matter how challenging. 

“Alright, let’s head to the supermarket now…”

They meandered from the university to the supermarket and then back to Leo’s apartment. After a delicious meal, Serena lay back on the sofa, her belly full and round, watching Leo busily tidying up the kitchen. 

As always, she playfully teased him, “Leo, you’re so virtuous. I can’t wait to take you home with me…” 

“Leo, it’s been ages since you updated your secret stash on your computer…”  

“Leo, don’t you think we have many more scenes to unlock together?” 

Her playful words ignited a spark in Leo, who quickly finished up the chores, ready to deal with her antics. But then, Serena suddenly remembered that today was the day the family doctor was supposed to visit her brother, Jason. In the past, she always stayed with him during these visits, but today was different. If she didn’t, their elderly caregiver, Mrs. Meng, would be alone.

Feeling responsible, she decided she needed to go back. Leo was reluctant to let her go and pressed her back onto the sofa, showering her with affection before he kindly escorted her home.

That night, the moon was bright and the stars twinkled in the clear sky. When Serena arrived home, the medical staff hadn’t yet arrived. Mrs. Meng was waiting outside, and Serena instructed her to go rest in her room.

She sat by Jason's bedside for a while, lying on the caregiver’s bed while chatting on the phone with Leo, waiting for the family doctor to arrive. 

Suddenly, she heard some strange noises from the house, which startled her out of her half-asleep state. 

“Leo, the doctor is here. I have to hang up. Goodnight! I love you!” 

Thinking the doctor had arrived, she hung up the call and stepped outside. As soon as she opened the door, a pungent smell of coal smoke hit her. 

Darkness clouded her vision, and her knees buckled, nearly collapsing to the ground. A realization struck her, and she quickly held her breath, retreating back inside and locking the door behind her. 

As she dialed the police, she tore a blanket from the bed and stuffed it into the crack under the door. After calling for help, she tried to open the window only to discover it had been locked from the outside. 

Without wasting any time, she grabbed a nearby chair and smashed the glass in Jason's room.

With a loud crash, she shouted out the window for help. Despite being a row of standalone villas, they were close enough together that her voice carried. Lights flickered on in neighboring houses, and soon, several security guards and neighbors arrived. 

Serena climbed out the window, instructing the guards to keep watch over Jason while she led some of them to break down the front door. 

The door was locked from the inside, and while Leo tried to break it down, he resorted to smashing the window. Just as he was about to climb inside, flames erupted from within the house. 

He hesitated for a moment, but Serena, disregarding the fire, rushed inside. Mrs. Meng was clearly suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning; Serena called out to her several times but received no response. 

With Leo’s help, who had just managed to get in through the window, she carried Mrs. Meng outside. Moments later, the flames roared higher, and thick smoke billowed out. 

Serena handed Mrs. Meng to Leo and then hurried back toward Jason. The security guards had already moved him to a safer distance due to the risk of an explosion from the gas buildup. 

Before long, the guards also carried out the two caregivers from the house. They were unconscious but still breathing. 

Just as they waited anxiously for the police and ambulance, the raging fire suddenly erupted with a loud explosion. The shockwave rattled the nearby houses, and the ground trembled beneath them. 

Serena, being pulled further back, stared wide-eyed at the house being consumed by flames. Her dark eyes were icy, her body stiff, and she bit her lip hard enough to draw blood. 

Soon, the firefighters arrived, followed by the police and ambulance. Jason, Mrs. Meng, and the two caregivers were rushed to the hospital. 

Serena decided to stay at the scene while Leo accompanied her to the hospital. After the injured were taken into the emergency room, Serena sat alone on a bench in the corridor, meticulously recalling everything that had happened that night. 

Everything unfolded so quickly, almost in the blink of an eye. Serena was still struggling to process it all. It felt as if the chaos was just a bad dream, leaving her with no sense of reality. 

Yet the surroundings reminded her that everything was indeed real. The doors and windows had been locked from the outside, clearly indicating this was no accident. 

So… who was it? Who wanted to annihilate the entire Zhou family? 

Was it a rival business? The Yan family? Duan Kangyu? Or perhaps… 

As Serena pondered, the head of the Municipal Hospital, Dean Feng Lan, rushed in. 

Seeing her, Serena immediately stood up, grasping her hand with sincere urgency, pleading with her to save Jason and Mrs. Meng. 

Dean Feng offered some comforting words before hurrying into the emergency room. 

The second to arrive was Duan Kangyu. Serena recognized him and stood up to greet him, but her reaction was notably cold. 

In contrast, Kangyu felt a wave of relief wash over him when he saw Serena was unharmed. He stepped closer, concern evident in his tone, “Serena, are you okay? Are you hurt?”
