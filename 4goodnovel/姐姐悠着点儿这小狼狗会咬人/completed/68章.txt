**Marriage and Children, Together Forever**

“…If you marry me, he won’t be able to touch you even a little, and you won’t have to worry about making any deals with him!”

Leo Sterling once again waved the household registration book in his hand at Serena Zhou. “Miss Zhou, I guarantee that marrying me is a sure thing. You should seriously consider it!”

Serena’s racing heart gradually slowed down.

“Leo, you’re being way too casual about this marriage proposal. I don’t need a huge diamond ring, but at the very least, you should choose a bright, sunny day to kneel down in a beautiful location, right?”

Her words couldn’t be more obvious.

“Is that so…?” Leo didn’t seem particularly disappointed. “Alright, in this matter, your opinion takes precedence. So, about this…” He shook the household registration book again. “Can I have you keep it for me for now?”

Although he phrased it as a request, he directly handed the book to Serena.

She was genuinely puzzled by Leo's words and actions today. It struck her as strange that the household registration book was in his hands at all.

“Leo…”

“I don’t have any ulterior motives. I just want you to know that you’re the only woman I want to legally and morally spend my life with in this world…”

Leo’s deep, captivating gaze brimmed with tenderness.

However, a chill crept into Serena’s heart.

Just then, several fire trucks drove by, sirens blaring. Although the hotel hadn’t detected any open flames, smoke was everywhere. 

The fire trucks arrived, and their first action was to evacuate everyone from the hotel and its surroundings. 

“This area is dangerous, evacuate quickly…”

Firefighters dashed around, and soon they reached Serena and Leo.

Serena knew her attire was drawing attention. She realized that accepting Leo’s household registration book would mean a lot. But, observing the crowd dispersing and the firefighters gathering, she quickly decided. Without hesitation, she took the book from Leo and grasped his hand, following him to his car parked on the side of the road.

In this moment, she couldn’t help but think they looked just like a couple eloping!

Once in the car, Leo suddenly asked with genuine concern, “Did the alarm scare you just now?”

Serena tossed her veil back onto the rear seat. Hearing his question, she turned to him and replied coolly, “Was that alarm your way of stopping me from marrying Duan Kanyu?”

Leo knew this method was a bit clumsy and cowardly. But at least it had proven effective.

“It seems this method wasn’t quite to your liking. Had I known, I would have just stormed the wedding like they do in dramas. When the minister asks if anyone objects, I would stand up and declare my disagreement with flair…”

Serena couldn’t help but laugh at the scene Leo painted.

“Let it go, Leo. I don’t like stealing the spotlight like that. Besides, your method… it’s quite dignified and meets my expectations.”

They seemed to be on the same wavelength. Although Serena had planned to confront Duan Kanyu on their wedding day, they still had battles to fight in the future. 

Serena didn’t intend to let the wedding become a farce, leaving people with gossip to chuckle about.

“As long as it meets your expectations and doesn’t upset you, that’s enough…”

Leo glanced at the household registration book resting on Serena’s knees and asked, “So, where are we headed now?”

“Now…” Serena followed Leo’s gaze to the book in his hands. She was still uncertain whether his proposal to marry was just a spur-of-the-moment test or if he was genuinely considering building a future together with her.

After pondering for a moment, Serena said, “First, let me borrow your phone to contact Sister Dai!”

Her phone was with Sister Dai, and now that the hotel was on fire, she and Duan Kanyu’s wedding would have to be “forced” to cancel. She had to explain things to her grandfather.

When dealing with the merchants, since much of the work had been prepared with her grandfather's help, they had developed a tacit understanding. Whenever Serena prepared to confront the merchants, her grandfather would conveniently excuse himself.

But concerning Duan Kanyu, that was something Serena had taken on herself. She needed to come clean to prevent her grandfather from being manipulated.

Leo handed his phone to Serena, who called Sister Dai.

“Sister Dai, where are you…? Oh, my grandfather? He’s gone home. Alright, I’ll be back soon!”

After finishing her call, Serena returned the phone to Leo and said, “Leo, please take me home first. Later tonight…”

She lifted the household registration book resting on her knees and raised an eyebrow at him, saying cheerfully, “I’ll ‘borrow’ my household registration book from home, and we can pick a sunny day to go get our marriage certificate together!”

The sudden twist left Leo utterly stunned.

He turned to Serena, unable to believe his ears. “Wait, what did you just say?”

Serena smiled brightly and suddenly leaned in to plant a soft kiss on his lips. “I said I love you too! I want to marry you, have children, and stay together forever!”

Serena had told Leo countless heartfelt things in the past, but never had she made him feel so overwhelmed.

Once he snapped back to reality, Leo cupped Serena’s face in his hands and pressed a fierce, passionate kiss on her lips.

“Serena, I love you!”

“Leo, I do too! I love you!”

In the confined space of the car, spring seemed to bloom, filling it with love and warmth. 

After Serena expressed her desire to marry and have children, Leo felt an almost overwhelming urge to tear off her pristine wedding dress and claim her right then and there. 

Yet, a voice of reason reminded him that the timing wasn’t right. At this critical juncture, using the marriage certificate as a test to confirm her true feelings for him felt rather dishonorable. 

If he added more confusion now… 

He already knew her feelings, so he shouldn’t complicate things. What he needed to do was integrate their lives together.

Even so, Leo couldn’t resist showering Serena with kisses until he finally took her back to her home.

Throughout the drive, one hand on the wheel and the other tightly holding Serena’s hand, a triumphant smile was plastered on his face, full of joy!

Serena, holding onto his hand with one and the household registration book with the other, smiled brightly, filled with happiness and longing…

When they reached a fork in the road, Leo couldn’t bear to let go of her hand. Looking at Serena earnestly, he said, “I really want to go home with you right now…”
