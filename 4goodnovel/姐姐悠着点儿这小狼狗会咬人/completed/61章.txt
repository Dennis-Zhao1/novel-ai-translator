**Love Is a Variable**

"Love is a variable," Mei He said to Serena Zhou, and Leo Sterling felt quite displeased. "Aunt, Serena is not the person you think she is. The investor Zhou, dealing with Duan Kangyu, was all my own decision..."

"...Forget it. I'll handle the issue with Duan Kangyu myself. But can you not tell my parents about any of this before I bring Serena back to meet them? They shouldn't know that I'm dating yet, right?"

Leo's parents were not involved in the business world; their social circle was tightly knit and quite stable. Unlike Mei He, who was the president of the Sterling Group and always in the know.

Leo had always been steady and composed throughout his life, never doing anything reckless or dangerous that would cause concern for the Sterling family. That's why his parents were rather permissive about his life.

Leo believed his parents probably didn't know about his relationship with Serena yet.

Mei He looked surprised. "You want to bring Serena back to meet your parents... Leo, are you serious?"

"Of course I'm serious, Aunt. I love Serena Zhou!"

"And what about her? Does she really love you?" 

Leo was confident. "She loves me too!"

"She loves you, yet she's still planning to marry Duan Kangyu?"

"She won't marry Duan Kangyu..." 

On this point, Leo was very certain. "I want to deal with Duan Kangyu, not because of his engagement to Serena, but because of some truly outrageous things he did to her in the past!"

Mei He frowned, incredulous. "You don't care that she might have approached you intentionally to use you?"

Leo chuckled dismissively. "If she really came to me knowing my identity, hoping to use me to escape her terrible situation, then that's the smartest move she could make..."

Leo reminisced about the happy and sweet moments he had shared with Serena, unable to suppress a smile.

"...After all, getting close to me and pleasing me is far easier and much more fulfilling for her than trying to win over someone like Duan!"

Mei He was taken aback by Leo's words.

After a moment of silence, she said calmly, "I understand the love of young people; in the beginning, everything feels deep and unwavering, so they can overlook anything. But love is a variable, what if…"

"Aunt, I won't give up my current happiness over a hypothetical 'what if' that may never happen..."

Leo emphasized, "…I'm very happy and comfortable with Serena. She gives me a sense of belonging, and this isn't just a fleeting whim; I truly want to walk through life with her!"

Mei He still wasn't convinced. "Leo, a lifetime is long. Maybe in the future, you'll meet someone better suited for you than Serena..."

Leo shook his head. "Maybe there are people better than Serena in this world, but none will be more suitable for me than her. Aunt, I love her, and I've poured all my passion and energy into this love. Even if we don't end up together, I won't feel for anyone else the way I feel for her now..."

Leo's words and his unwavering attitude left Mei He speechless.

After a long silence, she sighed. "Wow, just like that, you've grown up and started dating. I must admit, I'm a bit unaccustomed..."

Mei He patted Leo's shoulder and continued, "…But don't worry, I'm always on your side, as long as Serena is sincere about being with you..."

A gleam of determination sparkled in Mei He's eyes. "…It's difficult to shake the foundations of the Donglou Group, but Duan Kangyu is easy to deal with!"

Leo was overjoyed. "Aunt, you really are willing to help me?"

Mei He nodded. "I've heard some outrageous rumors about Duan Kangyu and his treatment of Serena. If she really becomes a member of the Sterling family in the future, he certainly needs to learn a lesson!"

With Mei He's promise, Leo felt much more at ease and eagerly poured her tea and served her food. 

Mei He couldn't help but laugh, "Look at you, so silly! If you feel the time is right and you're stable with Serena, before you take her back to meet your parents, bring her to meet me first?"

Leo readily agreed.

With the support of his aunt and cousin, Leo thought that even if his parents were not fond of him or Serena, it wouldn't matter much.

Suddenly, Leo felt like the obstacles he faced had become much smaller.

After meeting with Mei He, Leo's mood lifted significantly after being neglected for nearly a month. 

Though he wasn't sure if Serena would come to see him that night, he had gotten used to preparing an extra meal and simmering a pot of her favorite soup, waiting for her.

If Serena didn't come, he would take the extra food to the lab the next day and drink the soup himself.

But if she did...

Carrying a shopping bag, Leo returned home and opened the door to find Serena sprawled on the living room couch, one hand covering her eyes. 

She exuded an overwhelming sense of weariness and dejection.

The moment Leo saw her, his lips couldn’t help but curl up in a smile. He placed the groceries in the kitchen, then tiptoed to the couch, crouching beside her, propping his chin on his hand, staring intently at her.

After nearly a month apart, Serena had lost quite a bit of weight; her chin was sharp enough to poke someone.

Leo thought she must be going a bit crazy.

But seeing her so exhausted and sleeping so soundly, he couldn't bear to disturb her.

After watching her for a while, Leo leaned down and gently pecked her soft lips.

Just as he was about to stand up, the hand Serena had covering her eyes suddenly lifted, wrapping around Leo's neck, pulling him down for a kiss that was both tender and demanding...

Leo wasn’t sure if Serena was in a light sleep or completely awake, but soon he had no time to ponder such trivial matters.

Serena’s passionate and sultry kiss ignited a fire within him.

In an instant, Leo shifted from passive to active, pressing Serena back against the couch.

After such a long separation, their chemistry ignited like flames, burning with fervor for quite some time.

They embraced, kissed, and rolled from the couch to the bedroom...

(Details of the passionate encounter omitted for brevity)

Afterward, Leo held Serena tightly in his arms, intending to tease her a bit.

But Serena was utterly exhausted; they hadn’t even finished when she had already drifted into a sleepy haze.

Leo felt a pang of pity. He gently kissed her forehead a couple of times, then quietly got up and prepared a delicious meal.

Squatting by the bed, Leo kissed Serena, who was frowning even in her sleep, softly calling, "Sister, breakfast is ready. Get up and eat something before you sleep, okay?"

Serena opened her bleary eyes and struggled to sit up. 

Before they ate, she snuggled closer to him, satisfied, and took a bite of the fresh meat in front of her.

"I have to go home tonight. Will you take me back, Xiao Tang?" 

Leo glanced at the time, slightly surprised. "It's already past midnight..."

Serena nodded, explaining, "I had an engagement tonight, but the other party canceled last minute. Grandpa doesn't allow me to stay out, so I have to go back..."
