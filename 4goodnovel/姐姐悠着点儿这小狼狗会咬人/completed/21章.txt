I’m really interested in you.

Serena Zhou slowly released her grip and straightened up upon hearing those words. She stepped around Leo Sterling and looked up at him, noticing his expression was unusually stony. Unable to hold back, she asked, "What did she just say to you?"

Leo took a silent step back, shaking his head slightly. "It's nothing. I'm just a bit tired. I'm going to take a shower now..."

Serena cast a glance towards the girl who hadn’t walked far and was still peeking at them from a distance. Tentatively, she probed, "Did your cousin... leave?"

Leo nodded.

"Then let's head back together..."

Leo shook his head, declining. "I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood right now. I’ll book another room. You should get some rest!"

Serena's eyes dimmed at his response. Something was off about Leo, and without understanding the situation, she felt lost for words. She could only silently step aside, allowing Leo to retreat to his room.

As soon as Leo left, the girl approached with a bright smile, greeting Serena cheerfully, “Good evening, Miss Zhou! I’m Lila.”

Serena scanned her from head to toe. The girl appeared innocent and youthful, yet she was adorned in designer brands, with luxurious jewelry adorning her ears, neck, and wrists.

This young girl, a college student at such a prestigious university...

Serena couldn't help but smirk, her expression unreadable as she asked, "What do you need?"

Lila tilted her chin towards Leo's departing figure and sweetly said, “Miss Zhou, don’t take it to heart. Good-looking people, especially someone as handsome as Leo, are bound to have a little temper…”

Leaning casually against the railing, Serena studied Lila with an unreadable expression, waiting for her to continue.

Noticing Serena’s curiosity, Lila added, “...But someone with your qualities, Miss Zhou, it’s really unreasonable for Leo to act so spoiled and ungrateful in front of you.”

Serena pursed her lips, remaining silent. 

While Leo was indeed acting thoughtlessly, she couldn’t help but like him. What could she do about it?

“Miss Zhou, I’m also a student at your university. I know many charming male classmates. Though they might not be as good-looking as Leo, they’re all considerate and gentle. They would never embarrass you like Leo did. I wonder if you’d be interested in meeting them?”

Serena narrowed her eyes slightly, taken aback that this girl was engaging in matchmaking.

Thinking about what Lila might have said to Leo earlier made a surge of anger bubble up within her.

Yet, she maintained a warm smile on her face and asked, “Do you drink?”

Lila's eyes lit up as she replied sweetly, “I do, but I’m not very good at it.”

“Then let me treat you to a drink!” Serena stood up and walked towards the open-air bar at the end of the corridor.

Lila beamed and followed eagerly, “Thank you, Miss Zhou!”

After seating Lila, Serena ordered two cocktails. The drinks were prepared quickly and served to them.

Serena pushed one of the glasses towards Lila and asked, “You’re a student at our university? What’s your major, and what year are you in?”

“International Trade, junior year.” Lila smiled charmingly, took a small sip of her drink, and then pulled out her phone to show Serena a photo of a shirtless guy.

The guy in the photo had a striking appearance, his muscular physique clearly defined and incredibly appealing.

Lila, eager to please, began to introduce the guy in the picture.

Serena glanced at the photo and quickly averted her gaze.

Thinking Serena was unimpressed, Lila immediately switched to another photo of a boy with a dazzling smile. 

Yet Serena still displayed little interest.

“No worries, I have plenty more…” Lila said, changing to another photo of a boy with a melancholic expression.

Taking a sip of her drink, Serena pressed her hand down on Lila’s phone, her deep gaze locked onto Lila’s. “What’s your real name?”

“Huh?” Lila was momentarily taken aback, her eyes showing a hint of confusion.

“You’re in your junior year, and if you’re not planning to take the postgraduate exam, you’ll soon start your internship. Would you be interested in working a summer job at our company?”

Lila’s eyes widened in disbelief, almost stuttering as she spoke, “Miss Zhou, are you saying you want me to… intern at your company?”

Serena nodded, a light, cool smile playing on her lips. “Are you willing?”

Lila nodded enthusiastically but then shook her head quickly. “Can I know why you’d want me…”

Landing an internship at a prestigious company, even for just a summer, would be a significant opportunity. Yet Lila wasn't naive; she knew there were no free lunches in this world.

Serena scrutinized her with a gaze that felt like an appraisal.

Lila, still struggling to grasp the situation, asked incredulously, “Are you… interested in me?”

Leaning slightly closer, Lila couldn’t help but inch forward.

Serena didn’t shy away; instead, she raised an eyebrow and stated plainly, “I’m really interested in you and want to know more about you. But I’m often busy with work and spend most of my time at the company, so I find it hard to meet you. I wonder if you could accommodate me in that regard?”

Lila seemed taken aback. “Aren’t you already with Leo?”

Serena took a sip from her drink, finishing it in one go. “Do you mind him?”

Lila hesitated for a moment, shaking her head, then asked, “Will Leo also be interning at your company over the summer?”

A flicker of coldness passed through Serena's eyes as she replied tersely, “He won’t.”

Biting her lip, Lila furrowed her brow slightly, seemingly troubled.

Serena glanced at her and asked, “What’s the matter? Are your clients all men?”

Lila shook her head. “Not really…”

Serena smirked, understanding now. “You can state your conditions, but it’s a bit late today. You can think it over, and my secretary will contact you in a couple of days.”

Serena casually grabbed a napkin and borrowed a pen from the bartender, handing it to Lila with a tone that left no room for argument. “Write down your phone number!”

Lila glanced at Serena, a hint of nervousness in her expression.

She hadn’t anticipated such an opportunity; she initially intended to introduce Leo to Serena while trying to bring him into her circle.

But with Leo being a tough nut to crack, she hadn’t expected Serena to be this…

Lila took the pen and wrote down her number, handing it to Serena with a bright, eager smile.

Serena took a glance, then stood up, saying to Lila, “I’ll be going now. If you want to drink more, put it on my tab.”

After leaving the bar, Serena went to the front desk to request a nice note. Carefully, she penned her thoughts, one word at a time.

Then she headed to the room Leo had recently checked into, slipping the note through the gap in the door.

Not knowing how long it would take Leo to find the note, Serena lingered outside for a moment before returning to her themed suite.

She called Lin Cheng to come pick her up.

After hanging up, she began to change her clothes.

The red lingerie with ribbons was tricky to put on and even trickier to take off.

As she struggled with the straps, she suddenly heard the door lock turning, and someone entered…
