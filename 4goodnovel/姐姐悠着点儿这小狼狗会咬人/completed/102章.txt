**You’ve Broken Up, Serena**

Serena Zhou's eyes, once bright with life, now mirrored a dull shock. “Brother, are you blaming me?”

“I’m not blaming you,” Zhou Jingchen replied, his tone heavy with concern. “I just feel heartbroken… regretful… and sorrowful.”

He couldn’t help but remember how, two years ago, Serena wasn’t this way. Sure, she didn’t smile often, but the bitterness etched on her face now was entirely different. It was as if all warmth had been extinguished, replaced by a deep, haunting sorrow that made him ache to see her like this.

Since waking up, Zhou Jingchen had noticed that his once-vibrant sister, whose eyes sparkled with hope, had transformed into a shadow of herself—cold and somber, exuding an aura that warned others to keep their distance.

“Is it because of Leo? Is he the reason you’ve let yourself become this way?” 

Serena fell silent, momentarily taken aback. She hadn’t realized that to others, she appeared so… lost and desolate.

The thought of reaching for a cigarette crept into her mind. It seemed that only the smoke curling around her would offer some semblance of relief from the emptiness gnawing at her soul.

“Do I really look that bad?” she managed a faint smile, which felt more like a grimace.

“Maybe it’s just that I’ve been busy lately and caught a cold…” She trailed off, admitting that her mind had indeed been muddled during this time.

She had been sick. But even with makeup, her spirit seemed to lack the usual luster. As if to prove to Zhou Jingchen that she was merely under the weather, she lowered her head, coughing lightly into her fist.

Yet, Zhou Jingchen saw right through her facade.

“You’ve broken up, Serena!” he stated, his voice cutting through the air like a blade.

Broken up…

The word felt foreign to her, almost unrecognizable.

“Although the symptoms of a breakup resemble those of a cold, it’s not just a cold. Its aftereffects and devastation are far more potent…” Zhou Jingchen spoke with the wisdom of someone who had experienced the pain himself.

“You can’t numb your pain with cigarettes or alcohol, and distracting yourself with work won’t help either. It may dull the ache for a moment, but it won’t last. Or rather…”

“It will only intensify your symptoms, and won’t even slow down the hurt…”

“You’ll only grow more haggard and despondent, and you’ll find yourself…”

“Longing for the past, becoming trapped in memories, until you wish time could rewind…”

“You’ll sadly realize that all the things you hoped for were once real, but that happiness was fleeting. You didn’t seize it, even when you had the chance, and you just let it slip away…”

“Eventually, you will have to admit that the best parts of you are buried in the past…”

“Even if you smile, your heart will ache…”

“Even if you have everything, there will always be a void in your soul…”

“You won’t be able to eat or sleep, and in the dead of night, you’ll find yourself scrolling through your chat history with him, crying over your photos together…”

“Enough!” Serena snapped, her teeth clenched and an icy fury igniting within her. She shot up from her seat, her eyes reflecting a fierce desolation, as if parts of her had already decayed.

She glared at Zhou Jingchen, her words sharp like a curse. “I don’t care! Even if what you say is true, I don’t care. I just want revenge for Mom and Dad. No one can stop me from avenging this blood debt…”

Zhou Jingchen’s expression softened with concern as he faced her rising anger. “But, Serena, Leo is innocent. It was Song Weiming who poisoned Dad and Aunt Su…”

“But the one shielding that evil is the Leo family. If it weren't for their interference four years ago, how could the accident have happened? How could Ms. Meng have met her fate? How could the Zhou family have faced a fire? How could Donglou, Duan Kangyu, and the likes have dared to trample over the Zhou family?”

Anger surged within Serena, her eyes ablaze with a fierce hatred. Even though Song Weiming was now gone, her resentment hadn’t faded.

“Since you know the Leo family is the key, and you’ve already targeted them, why let yourself fall for Leo?”

“If you’ve fallen for him, why give up so easily?” 

Zhou Jingchen spoke with a heartfelt seriousness. “Serena, you know these are two different matters. What the Leo family owes us is not the same as what you owe Leo. You can’t just lump them together…”

He sounded like a sage, his words piercing through Serena’s defenses, causing her to feel the weight of every painful truth.

Of course, she understood Leo’s innocence. But what could she do now?

There was no turning back.

Sheng Yuan would never allow her to go back on her word or betray the contract. If she faltered, the Zhou family and the Shang family might face dire consequences.

Moreover, even if she wanted to turn back, Leo was no longer where she left him…

She had seen him just moments ago, laughing and chatting with a young woman, his arm casually draped over her shoulders. The warmth in his expression radiated a softness that felt like a knife to her heart.

In the elevator, she had overheard Leo sharing with someone beside him, “No wonder both men and women love to sleep with younger ones; they really are so delightful…”

The person beside him had teased, “Young Master Sheng, you and Keke… have you two…?”

Leo hadn’t answered but merely chuckled softly. That laughter was light yet filled with an endless joy and contentment.

Standing behind them, Serena felt her body stiffen, an icy chill creeping into her heart.

She knew she shouldn’t care; she knew she had no right to feel this way.

But in that moment, it felt as if something had lodged itself in her chest, making it hard to breathe.

Leo was, no matter what, no longer her concern…

Leo… even that name should have been severed from her life.

Yet, her mind and heart seemed to rebel against her will.

In an attempt to numb herself, she threw herself into work and sought solace in cigarettes and alcohol. But her mind wouldn’t allow her to rest for even a moment. 

As soon as she let her guard down, memories of the times she had spent with Leo would come rushing back, clinging to her like a shadow, refusing to let go…
