**Better Days Ahead**

"Mr. Zhou, what happened here...?" 

"I'm sorry, Mr. Su, Mr. Lu, but we need to get to the hospital right away. This lady has drowned..." 

Serena Zhou couldn't afford to provide much explanation. She gestured for her assistant, Daisy, to open the back door of the car. Gently, she laid the unconscious figure of Sherry Shang onto the backseat before climbing in herself. 

"Mr. Lu, hurry up and drive! She’s not going to make it!" 

Serena gasped, urgency flooding her voice as she pressed Mr. Lu to get the car moving. Though taken aback, Mr. Lu recognized the gravity of the situation. He started the engine and sped down the mountain road. 

However, the route that had been clear on the way up was now congested with traffic. Anxiety surged within Serena, but she kept her thoughts focused. 

"Mr. Zhou, the road is really blocked. How is Miss Shang doing...?" 

Though Sherry had regained her heartbeat, she was still struggling for breath, her face taking on a blueish hue. If she didn’t receive immediate medical care, the consequences could be dire. Serena's complexion paled as she tried to recall any medical knowledge she had, attempting to position Sherry in a way that might help her breathe better. 

Mr. Lu suggested, "With this traffic, maybe we should carry her down the mountain and grab a taxi to the hospital. It might be faster..." 

Serena shook her head firmly. "It's too far..." 

Sherry's face was already turning a dangerous shade, and time was not on their side. Serena furrowed her brows and glanced back, seeing no cars approaching. She spoke decisively, "Mr. Lu, please reverse and head back up the mountain..." 

Mr. Lu looked at her in disbelief. "Back up the mountain?" 

Serena nodded, understanding the weight of the life hanging in the balance. If they couldn't save Sherry, her own fate might be sealed as well. Though hesitant, Mr. Lu followed her lead, steering the car back up the winding road. 

"Turn onto this side road..." 

Following Serena's instructions, Mr. Lu maneuvered the car until they finally stopped in front of a well-lit villa. 

The night was still young, and the lights from inside illuminated the surroundings. As the car came to a halt, Serena quickly urged Mr. Lu and Mr. Su to help her carry Sherry out of the car. Without wasting another moment, she dashed toward the villa's entrance. 

Reaching the door, she pressed the doorbell and called out, "Sister Nanyin, it’s Serena Zhou! Please open the door, thank you!" 

A voice responded from within, "Serena?! Quickly, Auntie, let her in!" 

Fu Nanyin came rushing out to meet her. "Serena? What happened?" 

As soon as the door swung open, Serena led the way inside, bringing Mr. Lu and Mr. Su—who was now carrying Sherry—along with her. 

"Sherry is having an asthma attack and nearly drowned! Sister Nanyin, is your husband home? We need help!" 

Fu Nanyin's expression shifted as she assessed Sherry's condition. Realizing the urgency, she called out, "Azheng, are you done? Hurry up, we have a patient!" 

Without wasting a moment, Fu Nanyin ushered Serena and the others inside, directing them to place Sherry on the sofa while she rushed upstairs. 

Moments later, a man appeared, wearing only a towel around his waist, droplets of water glistening on his hair. He was Tong Wenzheng, Fu Nanyin’s husband and a respiratory specialist at the city hospital. 

"This situation looks serious..." Tong crouched down to examine Sherry, his brow furrowed as he reached for the inhaler. "Yinyin, pass me the medication!" 

Fu Nanyin quickly handed him the inhaler, her concern evident. She herself had asthma, and it was this very condition that had brought her and Tong together. 

After administering the medication, Tong instructed them to bring in an oxygen machine for Sherry. 

While he worked on Sherry, Fu Nanyin turned to Serena, noticing her light summer dress, which was now marred by various bruises. "Serena, what are you wearing? And why do you have all those bruises? Did someone hit you?" 

Serena was so focused on Sherry that Fu Nanyin’s words barely registered. It wasn’t until she glanced down at her own body that she realized how disheveled she looked. Forcing a smile, she replied, "Sister Nanyin, do you have any clothes I could borrow to cover up a bit?" 

"Come on upstairs with me!" Fu Nanyin replied gently. 

Serena followed her up the stairs. As Fu Nanyin rummaged through her wardrobe, she suddenly said, "Serena, over the years, I've felt quite sorry about how I treated you. Some of the things I said were too harsh..." 

Serena was caught off guard; she hadn’t expected this. Unsure how to respond, she managed an awkward laugh. "Sister Nanyin, it’s all in the past. You don’t need to dwell on it. I’ve already forgotten!" 

Fu Nanyin found a fresh dress and handed it to Serena, her large, expressive eyes fixed on her. "Have you really forgotten?" 

Taking the dress, Serena nodded sincerely. "I really have." 

"So you are actually going to get engaged to Duan Kangyu?" 

Serena hesitated, her brow creasing slightly before she affirmed, "Yes." 

Fu Nanyin frowned, her tone laced with concern. "But I heard he treats you very poorly..." 

Serena lowered her gaze, suppressing her mixed emotions. "He’s just taking out his frustration on me because of my brother’s broken engagement with Yingying. Things will get better." 

Fu Nanyin fell silent, unsure of how to respond. After a moment, she encouraged Serena to change clothes. 

Once Serena was dressed, she followed Fu Nanyin back downstairs. 

Tong was still attending to Sherry, but her condition had not improved significantly. He insisted they get her to a hospital immediately. 

"Her lungs may have fluid buildup that could lead to an infection. We need to get her to the hospital fast." 

Serena relayed the news about the traffic jam. 

"That’s fine," Tong reassured her. "She can manage for a bit with the oxygen. I’ll change my clothes quickly. You all carry her to the car." 

He soon returned, dressed and ready. Due to the cramped backseat of Mr. Lu's car, Tong instructed Mr. Su to lead the way in his vehicle. He would ride with Sherry, Serena, and Mr. Lu. 

With Tong present, Serena felt a little less frantic. Initially worried about the road being blocked, she was relieved to find it clear, and within ten minutes, they arrived at the hospital. 

Thanks to Tong's prior call, Sherry was taken straight into the emergency room upon arrival.
