**A Favorite Look**

As the days flew by during her busy schedule, time seemed to slip through the cracks like sand. A week later, Serena Zhou felt that the moment had finally arrived. She took extra care in her appearance, calculating the time Adam Song would finish his classes, and had the driver take her to the entrance of Qian University, dismissing him when they arrived.

“Adam…” She spotted him from a distance and waved, her face lighting up with a cheerful smile as she approached. “Class is over? I’ve been waiting for you! Do you have time tonight? How about we grab a late-night snack together?”

Adam squinted slightly at the girl before him. She had her hair tied up in a high ponytail, wore a floral dress, and sported a pair of cute white sneakers. For a moment, he was taken aback, unable to register the change.

He stared at Serena for several seconds, still uncertain. “Zhou… Miss Zhou?”

Serena blinked, a bit embarrassed, and teased, “I can’t have changed that much, right? Or has Adam already forgotten me after just a week?”

“Of course not! It’s just that your outfit today is quite different from what I remember…” 

If it weren't for the plaster cast around her right arm hanging from her neck, Adam would have found it hard to recognize Serena in this new light. Although they had only met a few times before, she had always donned sophisticated and elegant outfits, either in professional suits or stunning red dresses that exuded confidence and allure. Her aura had always been mature and refined.

But today, with bangs framing her forehead and a fresh face devoid of makeup, she appeared exceptionally fair and radiant. The long dress gave off a gentle vibe, and her warm smile made her seem like an innocent college student or a friendly, approachable younger sister living next door.

Adam hadn’t anticipated this side of Serena…

“I was just thinking about my outfit…” Serena looked down at her attire, puzzled. “Is it strange? Am I trying too hard to look youthful?”

Not wanting to offend her, Adam replied vaguely, “Not strange at all. You look great.”

Serena’s eyes sparkled with delight. “You like my style? Then I’ll dress like this whenever I come to see you from now on.”

That comment was a bit too ambiguous for Adam, who cleared his throat and redirected the conversation. “So, Miss Zhou, what brings you here today?”

“For a late-night snack! Do you have time, Adam?”

Seeing the hesitation in Adam’s response, Serena quickly added, “I’ve had a long day and didn’t even get to eat dinner. I heard there’s a great Japanese restaurant nearby. Would you be willing to join me? Consider it a way to thank you for saving me earlier.”

Serena’s sincerity was hard to refuse, and Adam wasn’t one to turn her down. The thought of her having been busy all day and coming to find him with such enthusiasm made his previously nagging feelings of her absence over the past week momentarily fade away.

“Miss Zhou, you’re too kind. You’ve already given me such a valuable gift; it wouldn’t be right for you to treat me to dinner. Let me take care of tonight’s late-night snack,” he insisted.

He wants to treat her? Serena was overjoyed, happily accepting. After thanking him politely, they walked side by side toward the roadside.

Serena handed over the car keys with a bright smile. “I’m sorry to trouble you again…”

Adam raised an eyebrow. “Didn’t your driver have an urgent matter to attend to tonight?”

Serena nodded, her serious expression making Adam chuckle in resignation as he accepted the keys.

The Japanese restaurant Serena mentioned was not far from Qian University. By now, the evening traffic had eased, and they arrived without needing to wait for a table, finding the restaurant's atmosphere cozy and perfect for a date.

Serena chose a seat by the window. After ordering their food, the two of them engaged in light, cheerful conversation. However, just a few exchanges in, a handsome guy from the neighboring table suddenly called out to Adam, approaching him with a nod.

“Wow, what a surprise! I didn’t think anyone could get the infamous top student from Qian University out for a meal. And this lovely lady is…?”

The guy's gaze shifted from Adam to Serena, scrutinizing her with a boldness that made her uncomfortable. With a playful smirk, he remarked, “Your girlfriend? She’s really stunning! You’re not from our school, are you?”

As he spoke, he leaned closer to Serena, his charming eyes locked onto her, his voice dropping to a sultry tone. “If you were from our school, I would definitely know about you. But really, are you Adam’s girlfriend? And what happened to your hand?”

While the guy was scrutinizing Serena, she quietly assessed him in return. He had a decent appearance and physique, but there was something slick and insincere about him that screamed trouble—a typical flirt, clearly used to charming women.

Serena glanced at Adam, who had grown cold and distant the moment the guy arrived. His face showed clear disdain, and he ignored the intruder completely.

Seeing Adam’s reaction, Serena understood that he didn’t like this guy either. She picked up her juice and sipped it, pretending to ignore the man’s comments.

The handsome stranger, caught off guard by being dismissed, felt a mix of embarrassment and annoyance. Just then, the waiter brought their food, creating a momentary distraction.

With an annoyed huff, the guy turned and walked away.

This brief interlude shifted the atmosphere from warm and inviting to awkward. Serena felt the discomfort in the air, especially with the stranger’s lingering gaze. She could sense Adam’s irritation; he frowned slightly and set down his chopsticks, claiming he was full after only a few bites.

With such an uninvited audience, Serena had intended to use her injured hand as an excuse to get closer to Adam, perhaps even to coax him into feeding her, but now those plans seemed dashed.

Feeling defeated, Serena signaled for the bill. Originally, she had planned to pay herself, considering Adam was still a student and this place wasn’t exactly cheap. However, realizing that he would need to maintain his pride in front of his peers, she reluctantly watched as he settled the bill.

Once outside the restaurant, the coldness in Adam's expression thawed. He looked at Serena and said, “I’m sorry for that. I didn’t expect to run into a classmate here. You didn’t eat enough, did you? Want to find another place to grab a bite?”

Serena glanced at the time and shook her head. It was getting late, and she had to visit the Duan family early the next morning. “It’s a bit late now. You have classes tomorrow, and since my driver isn’t here, I’d hate to trouble you. Let’s save our next outing for a time when we can go somewhere without interruptions!”

To Serena’s invitation, Adam didn’t outright agree or refuse. “Alright then… let’s head home. I’ll drive you back.”

As they ascended the winding mountain road, Serena wanted to engage Adam in a deeper conversation. However, her body was weary; after a day of relentless activity, fatigue was setting in.

She popped a mint into her mouth, attempting to rally her energy to chat with Adam, but soon succumbed to a yawn.

Noticing her weariness, Adam pressed the accelerator, speeding up. 

Before long, they arrived, and Adam parked the car at the same intersection where he had dropped her off last time. 

“We’re here, Miss Zhou!” 

Serena frowned a bit at the formal address. “I call you by your name, and yet you keep calling me ‘Miss Zhou.’ It makes me feel old and distant from you. Can’t you use a different name?”

Adam lightly tapped the steering wheel, his gaze drifting to the dark night sky. “Miss Zhou is probably older than I am. Calling you by your first name seems a bit impolite!”

Serena’s dark eyes sparkled mischievously as she replied, “Then why don’t you call me by my nickname?”

Adam turned to look at her, genuinely asking, “What’s your nickname?”

With a playful glint in her eyes and a smirk on her lips, Serena replied, “Call me… Qingqing…” 

The night air buzzed with possibilities as their playful banter lingered in the air, promising new adventures to come.
