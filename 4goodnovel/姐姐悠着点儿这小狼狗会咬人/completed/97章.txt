Let’s Break Up

Leo Sterling moved too quickly. Even though Serena Zhou had been prepared, she still took a punch that connected hard. As Leo’s fist came down and he prepared for a second strike, Serena suddenly stepped in front of Yang Yang, her voice sharp and resolute. “Leo, that’s enough…”

Leo’s fist whipped past Serena’s cheek, a mere breath away from her skin. He glared at her, eyes fierce as he gritted his teeth, furious. “Enough? Serena Zhou, why? Tell me, what does that scoundrel have that I don’t?”

“You’re great, it’s just that I’m tired. I’ve never been the patient type…” Serena looked at him with quiet resolve, a hint of exhaustion in her expression.

“…I had planned to wait for you to come back to discuss this, but since you’ve found out now…” Her voice was steady as she declared, “Then it’s settled, Leo. We’re breaking up!”

“Breaking up? Serena Zhou, don’t even think about it!” Leo's eyes widened, nearly bursting with rage as he stepped forward, reaching for her. “Let’s find a place and talk this through…”

Serena stepped back, avoiding his grasp, her tone cold. “There’s nothing to discuss. I’ve already collected all my things from your apartment, and everything you gave me is there too. I never take breakups lightly, Leo; I’m serious. We need to end this!”

“I refuse to accept that!” Leo’s voice was a low growl, teeth clenched in denial.

Serena met his gaze, her eyes firm, and then she turned away, ignoring him completely. Instead, she focused on Yang Yang, concern etched on her face as she cupped his chin. “Sweetheart, does it hurt? Let’s get you to the hospital…”

She grasped Yang Yang’s hand, urgency propelling her forward. As they passed Leo, he seized her wrist, forcing her to stop.

“Why? Why is this happening?” His voice was low and desperate, eyes bloodshot with emotion. Why did everything have to change so suddenly? Why was this cliché of betrayal unfolding between them? Why did the love that had once shone in her eyes seem to have vanished?

Leo couldn’t comprehend it; he felt a fire of frustration burning within him. Unless Serena told him that this was all a lie, just a cruel joke, and that she still loved him, that fire would never die down.

“There’s no need for explanations. The end of a relationship comes down to one simple reason: I don’t like you anymore. I don’t want to be with you. That’s it!” Her words were cold, piercing through Leo’s heart.

With that, Serena broke free from his grip and, taking Yang Yang’s hand, left the little Japanese restaurant without a backward glance.

Once outside, she released Yang Yang’s hand as they stepped into the elevator. It was only once the doors closed that she let out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding. How could it hurt this much? It was unbearable…

Her face paled, brows knitting together in distress. Yang Yang noticed her sway, a hint of worry in his voice. “Miss Zhou, are you alright?”

Serena shook her head, trying to compose herself. Lin Cheng, waiting by the curb, extinguished his cigarette and hurried to open the car door for her.

Before getting in, Serena turned to Yang Yang. “Dai Jie will contact you about your trip abroad. To avoid any backlash, the sooner you leave, the better!”

Yang Yang’s expression was mixed with gratitude and concern. “I understand. Thank you, Miss Zhou!”

She nodded in response as she settled into the car, her expression heavy with sorrow.

“Miss Zhou, should I take you home, or…” Lin Cheng began cautiously.

“Take me to the hospital. I want to see my brother…” 

In the hospital room, her brother, Zhou Jingchen, lay still as always, just as he had in the past, an immobile figure on the bed. Serena sat by his side, holding his hand tightly, resting her head on the edge of the bed. 

Whenever she felt tired or overwhelmed, she would quietly lean against Zhou Jingchen’s bed, finding solace there. But this time, she stayed there throughout the night, tears quietly slipping down her cheeks as she drifted into an uneasy sleep.

The next morning, Serena awoke to find numerous missed calls and messages from Leo. Staring at the name “Little Leo” on her screen, she finally decided to block him. 

Leo had kept his promise. Not only had he dealt with Song Weiming, but he had also ensured that Miss Meng was granted bail. Now it was her turn to fulfill her promise. 

It had been almost two years. Time had flown by so quickly that Serena often found herself taking Leo’s presence and care for granted. Even though she had consistently reminded herself to stay alert and not get too immersed, she had known from the start that she would eventually break up with Leo. 

Yet, when the moment came to actually say those words, it still felt like a knife twisting in her heart. Just the thought of Leo’s future without her was suffocating.

But she reassured herself it would pass. Life without Leo wouldn’t change that much. She’d still go to work, attend social events… If she needed to, she could even find a fresh young student to care for…

She just needed time to adjust.

After blocking all of Leo’s contact info, he waited for her outside the Shangzhou building for a long time. Serena deliberately avoided him, making it impossible for him to approach. 

He tried calling her from a different number, but as soon as she recognized his voice, she hung up without a second thought, refusing to give him even a chance to explain.

With no options left, Leo sought out the Zhou family directly after the New Year. Zhou Yunfang had returned from Hengxue to Qianhai. His health had deteriorated, and he moved with difficulty. 

No longer involved in matters of Shangzhou or the Zhou family, Zhou Yunfang handed everything over to Serena to manage. 

Miss Meng still wore an electronic ankle bracelet. Though she had been bailed out, she remained under suspicion.

When Leo arrived at the Zhou home, Zhou Yunfang was out with some old friends, leaving only Miss Meng behind. 

Unaware of the nature of Serena and Leo’s relationship, Miss Meng only knew that her daughter had taken a young man as her partner. Even when Serena and Leo’s relationship became public, she had never mentioned Leo to Miss Meng.

So when Leo suddenly appeared at the door, Miss Meng was taken aback.

He introduced himself as Serena’s boyfriend, come to pay his New Year’s respects. 

Miss Meng, taking in the tall, handsome young man before her, smiled and welcomed him warmly, immediately asking someone to call Serena.

When Serena received the call, she hurried home. As soon as she entered, she heard Miss Meng’s cheerful laughter. 

Leo was not known for his sense of humor, so Serena was surprised he could make Miss Meng laugh.

“Mother…” 

Serena took a deep breath to steady her emotions, her expression neutral as she stepped into the living room. She greeted Miss Meng first before slowly shifting her gaze to Leo, who looked noticeably thinner after nearly a month apart.

His spirit seemed dim, and when he looked at her, his eyes were deep and somber.

“Serena, honestly, if you’re getting married to Little Leo, why haven’t you told me or your grandfather?” 

Married? 

Serena shot Leo a quick glance, answering calmly, “I’ve been busy; I just haven’t had the chance. Besides, he’s still in school—marriage is a long way off…”

Serena didn’t want to delve too deeply into the subject with Miss Meng. She went along with Leo’s words for a moment before finding an excuse to pull him away.

After leaving the Zhou residence, they walked along the winding road in silence for a long while. An inexplicable sense of anxiety bubbled up within Serena as she rummaged through her pockets for a mint to calm her nerves. 

To her dismay, they were empty. She recalled that since breaking up with Leo, the refreshing mints had lost their appeal, and she had started smoking instead. 

In her haste earlier, she had forgotten to bring her cigarettes. 

Furrowing her brows, the anxiety turned into restlessness. Just then, a smooth, peeled mint was suddenly offered to her lips.
