**Dating is Like Playing a Mind Game**

No matter when she listened to it again, Leo Sterling's voice could always calm the restless heart of Serena Zhou. 

In truth, Serena didn’t have the time to make phone calls or reply to messages. However, she felt the constant scrutiny from Leo's relatives, particularly from his mother, which forced her to act a little more demure in front of Leo. She wanted to appear compliant, so she gradually started to distance herself from him. But she also feared that if she loosened the reins too much, other temptresses might sweep Leo away, leaving her in a precarious position. Thus, she found herself trapped in a delicate balance, pulling back and leaning in, tightening and loosening her grip.

Dating was like playing a mind game. It required sweetness and affection, but not to the point of being overly clingy. It demanded a sense of distance and freshness, yet she had to ensure he didn’t perceive her lack of enthusiasm or deliberate coldness. Gradually, Serena felt that maintaining her relationship with Leo was more exhausting than dealing with all the chaotic matters in her life. At least when she tackled those issues, she didn’t invest so much emotion.

The taste of mint candy seemed to lose its refreshing quality, prompting Serena to start downing coffee instead.

**April.**  
The court case concerning the illegal detention of Sister Jiang by Duan Kangyu was underway. Though they managed to win the case, Duan Kangyu walked away unscathed, and the housekeeper of the Duan family took the blame.

**May.**  
Mrs. Meng’s case was sentenced to life imprisonment in the first trial. Serena decided to appeal.

**June.**  
Leo’s mother came to Shallow Sea once again. She first met with Leo alone before summoning Serena. Upon meeting, she got straight to the point: with summer vacation approaching, Leo would be returning to Qingheng. She saw this as an excellent opportunity for Serena to part ways with Leo. 

“For the past six months, I've given you plenty of benefits, Miss Zhou. It’s time for you to show a little sincerity!” 

Serena maintained a calm demeanor, replying obediently, “Of course, since you’ve been so good to me, I wouldn’t want to let you down. I’ll make sure to show you my sincerity as soon as possible!” 

However, when she turned to Leo, he mentioned that he would be going back to visit his grandmother during the summer. Serena hesitated for a moment before saying, “I’ll go back with you…”

Leo looked both surprised and delighted. “Do you really have time?”

Serena yawned and replied, “Time is like water in a sponge; if you squeeze it, there’s always some to be found…”

He pulled her close, concern etched on his face. “But I don’t want you to feel too tired…”

Serena was painfully thin, looking like a starving refugee. Even though he tried hard to cook a variety of meals for her, she continued to eat irregularly, leading her to grow even thinner. He imagined that if they settled down together, living under one roof, he could ensure she ate on time, and maybe she would become a bit more vibrant.

Leo's hand rested on Serena's chest—it felt increasingly barren. Just last year, he could barely hold her close with one hand…

Serena affectionately said, “With you by my side, I don’t feel tired at all!”

The sweet nothings she uttered became more and more pleasing to Leo. The more she spoke, the more sincere it felt, and his faith in their future grew deeper.

Soon, summer vacation arrived, and Serena followed Leo back to Qingheng City. This time, she was convinced that nothing or no one would disrupt them.

After Duan Kangyu stepped down as the president of the East Tower, he continued to live freely. Although Tang Ying remained imprisoned, Serena believed that Leo's mother had certainly made promises to Duan Kangyu. Once Serena parted ways with Leo, his mother would begin targeting her. Without the backing of the Sheng family, what could Serena do to stop Duan Kangyu from rescuing Tang Ying? After all, Duan Kangyu's connections with the city officials were far stronger than her own.

During this time, Duan Kangyu had kept a low profile, avoiding contact with Serena. As for the merchants and Yan Jiajun… Shang Ruzhen dared not return to Shallow Sea, while Shang Bingyan had been placed under investigation, and his wife was in prison due to an old murder case. Shang Ruyan fled abroad after enduring a harrowing time due to an incident with Serena at the hospital entrance, while Yan Jiajun barely managed to hold on through the year but passed away shortly after the New Year. 

Amidst the tumultuous yet quieting backdrop of Shallow Sea City, Serena brought a number of gifts with her to Qingheng City. She felt the need to make amends for leaving in such a hurry the last time despite the circumstances. Serena had carefully prepared gifts for Leo’s grandmother and several elders in the Sheng family.

Upon landing, they were surprisingly greeted by Song Haizhou himself, who had come to pick them up. Leo was taken aback because, before coming, his grandmother had mentioned sending a driver, only to find that the driver was none other than Song Haizhou.

Leo and Song Haizhou shared a close bond. Upon seeing each other, they embraced warmly, and after exchanging a few excited pleasantries, Leo introduced, “Bro, let me introduce you. This is my girlfriend, Serena Zhou, the president of Shallow Sea’s Shangzhou Group…”

Song Haizhou had heard the name “Serena Zhou” countless times from Leo, and Serena was well aware of Leo’s close relationship with his cousin. However, they had never met before, and both were curious about each other. 

When they finally met, Serena and Song Haizhou discreetly sized each other up before politely greeting one another, both feeling an inexplicable sense of acknowledgment. 

Once inside the car, Song Haizhou asked Leo whether they were heading to the Sheng family or the Lin family first. Leo contemplated for a moment and replied, “Let’s go to my grandmother’s house first!”

However, Serena chimed in, “I heard your grandmother loves lychees, so I made sure to bring some fresh ones that were picked this morning. Let’s go to your house first; we wouldn’t want them to lose their freshness…”

With that, Song Haizhou drove them to the Sheng family’s residence first. 

Half a year had passed, and the scenery outside the car window had changed dramatically. The last time they visited, the mountains and forests were covered in snow, looking desolate. This time, it was a vibrant green, full of life.

During the drive, Leo chatted animatedly with Song Haizhou, ensuring Serena felt included in the conversation. Somehow, the topic shifted to Serena's brother, Zhou Jincheng. 

Song Haizhou remarked, “I’ve met your brother before. One time, when I was in Shallow Sea visiting a comrade, I happened to run into a high school classmate of mine who was with your brother, and we all had drinks together…”

Serena didn’t have much of a reaction to this. However, Leo’s eyes widened in surprise, and he glanced at Serena before frowning. “Bro, your high school classmate wouldn’t happen to be named… Xia Xiuhe, would he?”
