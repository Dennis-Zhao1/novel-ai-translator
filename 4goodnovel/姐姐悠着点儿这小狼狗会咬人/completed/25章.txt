**Heart Blossoms**

But this night had been too chaotic and physically exhausting for them. Even though both of them were still young, they couldn’t withstand such unrestrained antics. 

Zhou Jingshu was the first to surrender, her voice soft as she pleaded for mercy. Sheng Tang, although he was tempted, couldn’t bear to push Zhou Jingshu further. He kissed her fiercely for a long while before getting up to splash cold water on his face in the bathroom, waiting for the fire burning inside him to cool down. When he returned to the sofa, he wrapped his arms around Zhou Jingshu and continued watching the movie, but he didn’t forget to remind her not to fan the flames again, warning her that the consequences would be hers to bear.

Zhou Jingshu leaned back against Sheng Tang with a sly smile. “Don’t worry, I won’t dare to!”

Indeed, the newly initiated boy was like a cat that had just tasted fish—fearsome and insatiable! 

Sheng Tang held Zhou Jingshu tightly, resting his chin atop her head with a hint of pride in his tone. “So, you now know how powerful your little brother is?”

Zhou Jingshu playfully pinched Sheng Tang’s fair and delicate face, nodding in agreement with a proud tone, “My little brother has to be impressive!”

The term “little brother” didn’t sit well with Sheng Tang, and he let out a soft grunt of dissatisfaction. However, he didn’t argue. Instead, he followed Zhou Jingshu’s lead and asked, “What do you plan on doing to take care of me?”

Zhou Jingshu raised an eyebrow, a bit surprised. “How do you want me to take care of you?”

“All my life, my family has let me grow up freely. They always sent money on time, so I’m not short on funds. I don’t need you to spend anything on me. But if you’re going to take care of me, I love eating meat, especially…”

Sheng Tang’s warm palm covered Zhou Jingshu’s soft curves, and he leaned down to gently take a taste. 

“…so just take care of me like this!”

Zhou Jingshu’s eyes sparkled with a hint of delight. “So you like eating meat? Looks like I’ve been raising a little wolf cub!”

Sheng Tang let out a few playful howls, then playfully pushed Zhou Jingshu back onto the sofa. His Adam's apple bobbed as he spoke in a husky voice, “Sister, your little wolf cub wants to eat meat now. Come and feed me…”

Zhou Jingshu knew she couldn’t escape this… 

She glanced at the TV, where the romantic movie they were watching featured a couple in a similar position to theirs. 

Zhou Jingshu cupped Sheng Tang’s face in her hands, softening her voice as she pleaded, “Little Tang, can we put this on the tab? I promise I’ll make it up to you next time!”

The name “Little Tang” instantly deflated Sheng Tang. “Did you hear what my brother said that day?”

He scooped Zhou Jingshu off the sofa and held her in his arms. He knew Zhou Jingshu was new to this kind of intimacy, and if he pushed further, her body wouldn’t be able to handle it…

“You were talking so loudly at the door, it was hard not to hear… and ‘Tang Tang’ is such a sweet, nice name…” 

Sheng Tang quickly interjected, stressing, “But it doesn’t suit me, and I don’t like it. That nickname was only used by my grandma when I was little…” 

Feeling a bit shy, Sheng Tang rubbed his nose. “…Can you think of another name for me?”

Zhou Jingshu tilted her head, “Then I’ll have to think really hard about it.”

Sheng Tang couldn’t help but laugh at her serious expression. “Then I’ll think of a special nickname just for you, something only I can call you.”

Zhou Jingshu stroked her chin, seriously asking, “Doesn’t ‘Sister’ count?”

Sheng Tang shook his head.

She thought for a moment and realized that the term wasn’t exclusive to Sheng Tang. 

“How about… ‘Qingqing’?” 

Sheng Tang frowned, puzzled. “Is that really your nickname? Are you serious?”

A hint of sadness flickered in Zhou Jingshu’s eyes as she nodded. “Of course, and only my parents called me that. Ever since they passed away over a decade ago, no one has called me that again.”

Zhou Jingshu looked at Sheng Tang earnestly, stating, “So you can call me that. This way, it’ll still be a nickname just for you.” 

She gently lifted Sheng Tang’s chin, enticingly coaxing, “Good Tang, let me hear you say it?”

Sheng Tang’s large hand wrapped around Zhou Jingshu’s slender waist, pulling her closer, and he pressed a kiss on her lips, mumbling, “I prefer calling you ‘kisses’…”

Zhou Jingshu laughed knowingly, her tone teasing. “I see, my little wolf cub prefers actions over words, doesn’t he?”

Straightening her back, Zhou Jingshu wrapped her arms around Sheng Tang’s neck, whispering, “Then come here, sister will feed you some meat…”

As she spoke, she brought her soft curves closer to Sheng Tang’s mouth. 

With a playful “awoo,” he buried his face into her softness. 

Zhou Jingshu’s teasing had completely drowned out his rationality. 

He had initially intended to ask her about her parents… 

However, as the movie finished with warm, beautiful music and the room flooded with romantic shadows, it was the perfect setting for something to happen between them—a lonely man and woman, emotionally intertwined in a room. 

Sheng Tang knew that Zhou Jingshu still felt a bit uncomfortable, but since she was initiating it, he decided to take it slow and steady. 

Looking deeply into Zhou Jingshu’s eyes, he said earnestly, “Sister, let’s take it a bit slower, okay?”

Pretending not to catch the double meaning in his words, Zhou Jingshu didn’t respond directly but instead kissed him, silencing his mouth.

To Sheng Tang, their relationship seemed to be progressing too quickly. 

But to Zhou Jingshu, she felt she was being restrained enough. 

If it were anyone else, no—if Sheng Tang weren’t such a proud and awkward person, she would have already made her move. 

That night was undoubtedly one of tenderness and infinite warmth. 

The next morning, when Zhou Jingshu woke up in Sheng Tang’s bed, he had already gotten up and prepared breakfast, bringing it to her bedside. 

And this breakfast was even more lavish than what they had in the hotel on Fan Yin Mountain. 

Zhou Jingshu gazed at Sheng Tang’s handsome and youthful face, feeling utterly satisfied. 

The more she looked at this boy, the more she liked him, her heart racing. 

How could someone so young be so understanding, independent, and considerate? 

“Little Tang, what should I do? I’ve realized that from head to toe, inside and out, you’re increasingly to my taste. I really want to hide you away…” 

Sheng Tang playfully fed her a small heart-shaped piece of fried egg from the plate, smiling indulgently, “I’m not an object, how could you hide me?” 

Zhou Jingshu swallowed the egg, correcting him, “How could you be an object? You’re my precious little wolf cub, a rare treasure to me…” 

Sheng Tang couldn’t take it anymore. 

Zhou Jingshu’s sweet talk was too smooth; the more he heard, the more awkward he felt. 

He couldn’t shake the feeling that she wasn’t being entirely sincere, treating him like a child to be humored. 

Unable to hold back, Sheng Tang interrupted, “It’s getting late! You should hurry up and wash up, I see Lin Cheng waiting downstairs!” 

Zhou Jingshu glanced at the time; it was indeed late. She muttered a soft curse at “the terrible Monday” and reluctantly got up to wash. 

“Is your body still feeling uncomfortable? Do you want me to carry you?” 

Since they had only shared a tender moment the night before, Zhou Jingshu didn’t feel particularly unwell. 

She didn’t want to risk igniting another fire with his embrace. 

Shaking her head, she refused. 

The two of them, innocent as they were, had savored the taste of intimacy, and from now on, it would only become more fitting and addictive… 

Just thinking about it made Zhou Jingshu's heart blossom with joy!
