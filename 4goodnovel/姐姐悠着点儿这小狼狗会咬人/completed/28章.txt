**But I Can't Afford to Love**

As the evening wore on, Duan Kangyu finally released Serena Zhou, his voice calm as he said, “Since you’ve already made plans with Mr. Su, you shouldn’t be late. Go on, take care of your business.”

Serena felt a wave of relief wash over her, though her expression remained as composed as ever. She smiled sweetly at Duan Kangyu, her demeanor serene and unhurried as she replied, “I’ll be on my way then, Uncle Duan. Get some rest, and goodnight!” She waved her hand, a hint of reluctance lingering in her gesture.

It wasn’t until Duan Kangyu extinguished his cigarette and turned to head upstairs that Serena finally strode away from the Duan residence with purpose. 

Once inside her car, the obedient facade she wore melted away, replaced by an icy chill that enveloped her. 

“Ms. Zhou, are you alright?” Lin Cheng asked, concern etched on his face as he started the engine.

“I’m fine, let’s just not be late,” Serena replied, taking a moment to compose herself. 

As they drove, she gazed out the window, watching the lush greenery blur past with each passing second. Memories of her first encounter with Duan Kangyu flooded her mind. He had said he had no interest in mentoring a fledgling, especially one who had only ever liked girls before.

“To be honest, I’m not fond of discussing feelings either. We’re both businesspeople, and marrying me won’t mean you can abandon your career to be my supportive wife. So let’s keep things rational and focus on the benefits.”

Duan Kangyu was a clear-headed and rational man, and Serena desired to be just as clear-headed. But she felt out of her depth, lacking experience and patience.

Duan Kangyu...

A faint, cold smile crept onto Serena's lips.

Mr. Su from the Coastal Bank was known for his impressive drinking capacity; most people couldn’t keep up with him. That night, Serena had gone alone to the gathering without her friend Dai, facing off against Mr. Su and a private equity fund manager named Lu until the early hours of the morning. In the end, it was Mr. Su who capitulated first.

As everyone slumped down, Mr. Su patted Serena on the shoulder and uttered the first honest words of the evening: “Serena, it’s not that I don’t want to help, but the bank president is holding things up. He’s from the East Tower, and Mr. Duan personally mentored him for quite a while…”

With a wine-induced hiccup, Mr. Su’s eyes, bright and sharp behind thick glasses, glinted. 

“…You’ll need to speak with Mr. Duan about this. But Mr. Lu’s fund has substantial financial backing, and they’re currently preparing to open a branch in Coastal, so you might want to build a relationship there.”

“Thank you for the introduction, Mr. Su. I really appreciate it! Here’s to you!” Serena said sincerely, raising her glass.

After Mr. Su was thoroughly inebriated, Serena escorted him out before returning to the private room to continue drinking with Mr. Lu. The man’s capacity for alcohol seemed limitless. The more Serena drank, the more alert he became, his gaze toward her growing increasingly sharp and probing, almost unmasked.

Serena felt a shiver run down her spine.

Yet the Coastal project was far too significant. When her brother was developing it, it was during a prosperous time, with hefty investments. After her brother’s accident, the company took a severe hit, and several investors withdrew, draining what was once a solid cash flow.

With no connections or resources in Coastal, Serena had been struggling for six months, utterly exhausted. Even if the bank approved a loan, it would only barely sustain her for three months. 

Desperate for investment from elsewhere, she focused on Mr. Lu’s private equity company, which had substantial backing—exactly the kind of financial support she needed.

She had to navigate this carefully and build a solid relationship. But Mr. Lu’s drinking prowess was overwhelming, and as she struggled to keep up, she felt herself on the verge of tipping over.

After a phone call, Mr. Lu flashed a teasing smile and excused himself, but not before expressing his interest in the Coastal project and scheduling a time to visit for an inspection.

Once he left, Serena let out a long sigh of relief. Sitting alone in the private room for a moment, she braced herself against the pain in her stomach and made her way to the parking lot.

“Are you okay, sis?” 

As she descended the stairs, a strong arm suddenly grabbed her hand. 

Serena looked up, her gloomy expression instantly brightening.

“Leo, what are you doing here?” she exclaimed, surprised and delighted.

Seeing her pale face and unsteady stance, Leo easily swept her into his arms and carried her toward his car. 

“Honestly, I’ve been waiting here for you for quite a while. How did you end up drinking so late?” he said, his brow furrowed in concern.

Serena ignored the second part of his statement and focused on the first. “Why are you here waiting for me? Don’t you have classes tomorrow?”

With his long legs, Leo quickly reached the car. He opened the door and gently placed her inside, fastening her seatbelt with care before sliding into the driver’s seat himself.

After a soft acknowledgment, he reached into the back seat and pulled out a thermos. He poured a steaming bowl of red date and mung bean soup and handed it to Serena.

“Here, drink this. It’ll help with the hangover…”

Though Serena didn’t feel particularly intoxicated, the sight of the concerned young man made her suddenly dizzy and the world around her slightly hazy. 

Before she could reach for it, Leo had already brought the bowl to her lips, even offering a tissue to wipe away any spill.

Feeling she had no choice, Serena sipped the warm soup, finishing every last drop. 

Leo really was an excellent cook, and she thought it was the best red date and mung bean soup she had ever tasted. She had tried to replicate it herself and ordered it from various restaurants, but nothing compared to the bowl Leo had brought her that night.

Seeing that she finished the bowl, Leo gently asked, “Would you like some more?”

Serena nodded, obediently.

He poured her another bowl.

Her stomach was already full of alcohol, but if she hadn’t been so tired, she would’ve polished off the entire thermos. 

“Let’s head home now. Just get some rest and don’t fuss!” 

After packing the thermos away, Leo drove them home. The streets were quiet at this late hour, and he sped along, bringing them back to his apartment swiftly.

Serena slumped in her seat, already asleep by the time they arrived. 

Leo carefully lifted her up the stairs and set her down on the bed, then fetched water for her to wash up. 

Serena wasn’t really drunk; she was just overwhelmingly tired. 

In her drowsy state, she felt someone undressing her and gently wiping her down with a warm cloth. 

She rolled over, mumbling, “Leo, I love you so much, but I just can’t afford to…”

It seemed like she was having a terrible dream. 

She couldn’t remember the details, only that she felt like she was crying. 

Then a person grasped her chin, kissing her fiercely and tenderly, over and over, leaving her feeling both distressed and comforted! 

She thought she heard someone whispering sweetly in her ear repeatedly. 

“Sis, I love you too! Don’t be afraid, don’t worry. As long as you love me, I’ll solve everything for you…”

That voice was so tender, so soothing, it wrapped around Serena’s weary soul like a warm blanket. 

With her eyes tightly shut, she smiled. 

This dream... she wished she could stay in it forever!
