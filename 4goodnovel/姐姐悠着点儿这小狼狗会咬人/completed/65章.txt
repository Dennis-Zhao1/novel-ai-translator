**You Will Eventually Fall in Love with Me**

段康御's eyes widened in surprise. “What? Uncle Duan is disappointed?”

周景姝 maintained her calm demeanor, recalling that this was one of the conditions proposed by段康御 himself when he agreed to their engagement. At that time, she had confidently accepted, but now she was being accused of fabricating her close relationship with Leo Sterling during this time.

Duan Kangyu felt a twinge of disappointment. “Jing Shu, you really…”

“What is it? Homosexual? Oh, I am!” 

Her composed attitude and tone made it seem like she was merely using a clumsy excuse to reject him. At the same time, it felt like a sincere outburst of her true feelings in the quiet of the night.

For the first time, Duan Kangyu found himself confronted with an intriguing puzzle in the form of周景姝. 

There was a hint of mockery in her eyes. “So, Uncle Duan still wants to marry me?”

Duan Kangyu frowned, pondering for a moment, then replied earnestly, “To be honest, Jing Shu, I don’t mind…"

周景姝 raised an eyebrow, clearly skeptical. 

Duan Kangyu continued, “I just told you, the foundation of marriage is mutual benefits. As long as our interests are deeply intertwined, our marriage will be stable. Love isn’t necessary for marriage, and neither is sex!”

“Uncle Duan truly believes this and is willing to accommodate such a situation?”

A loveless, sexless marriage… Duan Kangyu couldn’t hide his disappointment. “Honestly, Jing Shu, I didn’t expect you to be gay. Do you want to know why I initially suggested you keep a young boy?”

“To make me retreat?”

“No…” Duan Kangyu said, “It’s because you’ve never been in a relationship, nor have you experienced the joys of intimacy. I hoped you could love freely and enjoy this most beautiful stage of your life…”

“…Such passions may be thrilling, but they also fade quickly. Once you’ve tasted them, you’ll realize that love is just that—a fleeting thing. After this, you won’t dwell on it; it’s all just a game. Only in this state could we marry…”

“…And truly go the distance!” 

Duan Kangyu’s explanation shocked周景姝. 

“Is my intention so hard to guess?” he asked lightly.

周景姝 honestly nodded. “I’m too naive; I really never thought there was such a profound meaning to it…”

“You’re not naive; you’ve just experienced too little. In fact, you’re far more capable and intelligent than you think. You should have more confidence…”

周景姝 smiled bitterly, lowering her head. “If I were truly intelligent and capable, Uncle Duan wouldn’t have been hurt tonight…”

Duan Kangyu gazed at周景姝 with deep affection, gently saying, “It’s my honor to shield you from harm. Jing Shu, I’ve shared all this with you tonight to tell you that even if you are gay, I still hope you will be my wife…”

“Even if I resist your intimate touches, you’re still willing to marry me?”

Duan Kangyu replied, “I have confidence in myself. As long as you don’t reject my care and protection, one day you will willingly become my true wife!” 

He shifted slightly on the hospital bed, enduring the pain from his wound, allowing him to grasp周景姝's hand effortlessly. 

Duan Kangyu looked intently at周景姝, his voice low and compelling, “Jing Shu, I promise you, I will never harm or doubt you again. I will treat you with utmost sincerity. If you can’t accept my closeness now, I can wait. Jing Shu, let’s... get married, okay?” 

In the quiet of the night, alone in the room, 周景姝 understood that if she were truly naive in matters of love, she wouldn’t stand a chance against the seasoned romantic that Duan Kangyu was. 

Duan Kangyu also knew that the benefits of the East Building for the商周 family were substantial. There was no way the shrewd周景姝 could resist this temptation. 

So they both played their own selfish games, silently agreeing to return to the path of a business marriage. 

That night, 周景姝 stayed in the hospital until dawn before leaving. 

As soon as she left, Huang Liang entered Duan Kangyu's hospital room. 

He brought the surveillance footage from the hospital entrance for Duan Kangyu to see. “Sir, I think you need to take a look at this…” 

Duan Kangyu was puzzled. “What does this mean? You want me to relive my heroic rescue of a damsel in distress?” 

Huang Liang surprisingly did not play along with Duan Kangyu’s humor. 

He spoke seriously, “Sir, I’ve watched this video several times, and I’m convinced that Miss Zhou had ample time to grab the fruit knife before Yan Jiajia or at least kick it away… In short, her turning to run toward you seems illogical…” 

“What do you mean? Are you suggesting that Zhou Jing Shu intentionally wanted me to take this stab?” 

Huang Liang didn’t even bother to refute. 

Duan Kangyu raised his eyebrows in shock. “That theory sounds absurd…” 

After all, if he hadn’t pushed her away, it would have been周景姝 who took the hit. 

No sane person would risk their life like that! 

Moreover, if周景姝 really did that, what would she gain? 

To take revenge on him by making him suffer? 

His actions were beyond her control. 

On the surface, Duan Kangyu scoffed at Huang Liang’s suggestion, but he couldn’t shake the doubts that lingered in his mind. 

Later, Duan Kangyu intentionally showed周景姝 the video. He claimed it was to let her admire his bravery at that moment. 

周景姝, oblivious, watched it and sincerely thanked him. 

Duan Kangyu then casually broached the topic, “Jing Shu, I was really touched watching this video. It shows that when you were in danger, the first person you thought of was me. This proves you’re unconsciously getting closer to me!” 

周景姝 paused, her expression hesitant. “Is… is that so?” 

Duan Kangyu looked at her with delight, seeing her serious contemplation, and smiled. “Yes, Jing Shu, Uncle Duan is confident that you will eventually fall in love with me!” 

周景姝 lowered her head, responding earnestly, “I will try my best!” 

How could周景姝 not understand Duan Kangyu’s intention in showing her the video? He was indeed doubting whether she had intentionally run toward him. 

Yes, that was correct. 

周景姝 had indeed acted on purpose. 

She couldn’t truly afford to let her relationship with Duan Kangyu deteriorate, as she needed the Duan family to celebrate a joyous occasion to bring Tang Ying back. 

She was indeed closer to the knife than Yan Jiajia at that moment. 

She could have easily handled the situation before Yan Jiajia. 

But she feigned panic and ran toward Duan Kangyu, gambling on two outcomes: either she would take the stab herself, or Duan Kangyu would take it for her. 

No matter the result, she could break the ice with Duan Kangyu. 

If Duan Kangyu was serious about marrying her, then周景姝 truly had nothing to say against it. 

After Duan Kangyu took over the mess left by the商家颜 family, he managed it quite neatly. 

周景姝 didn’t want the商家’s estate, and Duan Kangyu didn’t comment on it. 

Instead, he ordered Huang Liang to burn the商家’s property to ashes. 

Then, he sent over several properties for周景姝 to choose from. 

After much deliberation, she ultimately settled on a foreclosed property. 

Duan Kangyu didn’t object; he just took it as周景姝's stubborn resistance. 

Thus,周景姝 awkwardly continued her relationship with Duan Kangyu while occasionally meeting Leo Sterling on the side.
