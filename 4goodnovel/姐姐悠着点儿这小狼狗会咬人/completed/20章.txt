If Serena Zhou dared to gamble...

Before she could respond, Leo Sterling had already stepped forward with a joyful expression and wrapped his arms around the person in front of him in a big hug.

Adam Song smiled gently as he patted Leo's shoulder. "I’m here to attend a friend's wedding. It’s been almost a year since we last met, and you seem to have grown taller!"

Leo released Adam and scrutinized him closely, noticing that he seemed to have bulked up and tanned. 

Curious, Leo asked, "A wedding? Whose wedding?"

Adam replied casually, "The president of Chu Lian Group from Fengqing City is marrying the second daughter of the Gu family."

"Oh," Leo said, testing the waters. "So, my parents, and Uncle and Aunt, are they coming too?"

Adam shook his head. "They didn’t come. It’s just me."

"Then you took leave for this, right? How many days? Have you gone home yet?"

Adam patiently explained, "Yes. Just two days off. I have to return to the military district before dawn tomorrow, so there’s no time to go home."

"You need to go back before dawn tomorrow, so why are you still here? And…"

Leo seemed to realize his current situation; behind him in the romantic suite, a beautiful and alluring woman awaited him.

A hint of embarrassment flashed across Leo's face as he asked, "…How did you know I was here?"

At the mention of this, Adam leaned in to glance into the room behind Leo, a knowing smile gracing his lips. 

"I actually didn’t know you were here until I happened to hear someone calling your name down the hill and saying they liked you. So I thought I’d come up and check, and what do you know? It really is you!"

Clearing his throat, Adam continued, "Leo, you’ve grown up, starting to date now. But don’t get reckless just because you’re young; take it easy! As for your girlfriend…"

Adam leaned in again to peer into the room, his tone turning serious. "…Is this just a fling, or is it serious?"

Leo replied without hesitation, "Of course it’s serious!"

Adam wasn't surprised; Leo had always approached everything in life with utmost sincerity. 

When he did something, he either didn’t do it at all or committed fully to doing it right.

"I knew you’d be stubborn. Since it’s serious… would it be okay for you to introduce her to me? I want to see if she meets Aunt and Uncle’s standards."

"I’m okay with it, but she… we just started dating, and she’s a bit shy. Let me ask her first; you wait outside for a bit!"

Without hesitation, Leo felt confident he could disrupt the engagement that was set to happen in two months. 

What was that guy, Duan Kangyu, anyway? Leo would never give Serena Zhou up to anyone.

Even though they had just begun dating, Leo hadn’t planned on introducing Serena to his family so soon. But his bond with Adam was close, and he trusted him immensely.

If Serena was willing to meet his family, he would go all in. Regardless of whether her feelings for him were genuine love or not, he would be honest about his identity and share life's ups and downs with her from that moment on.

If Serena dared to gamble, he would gladly join her!

Adam patted Leo on the shoulder with a look of encouragement. "Alright, I’ll go prepare some late-night snacks. I’ll be waiting for you two at the terrace restaurant!"

With a meaningful raise of his eyebrows and a satisfied smile, Adam turned and left.

Leo watched Adam walk away before closing the door.

Serena Zhou sat on the couch, focused on replying to messages on her phone.

"Hey, babe…" 

Leo walked over, pulling Serena into his embrace, kissing her neck and earlobes as he softly discussed the situation with her. 

“…That guy outside is my cousin, the son of my aunt. He heard you calling my name and saying you liked me. He wants to meet you; do you want to see him?"

Serena put her phone away, her expression stiffening slightly.

Turning to him, she furrowed her brows and asked, "Is that okay? I mean, he’s your cousin, your family, and… is our relationship suitable to be shown to your family? What if…"

They had only been together for three months.

If they suddenly revealed their relationship to the family and later broke up, it would be incredibly awkward…

Serena instinctively felt some resistance.

Leo hadn’t held out much hope anyway. Noticing Serena’s hesitation, he didn’t push further. 

He also thought it was inappropriate. After all, their sweet month together had mostly revolved around romance, and they hadn’t really gotten to know each other deeply yet. 

It truly wasn’t the right time to introduce real-life issues.

Although Leo understood that Serena’s concerns were valid, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of loss creeping in.

The woman in his arms, who said she liked him, was possibly just flattering him to get into bed, just like… many wealthy and powerful men do with beautiful young women!

That realization left a bitter taste in Leo’s mouth.

"I understand; I agree that it’s not the right time for you two to meet. I’ll go tell him. You wait here, and we can take a shower together when I get back!"

Giving Serena a gentle kiss on the cheek, Leo carefully released her from his embrace, stood up, and opened the door to step outside.

Watching Leo’s somewhat flustered back as he left, Serena's expression darkened.

She put her phone down, got up to lock the door, and then used the landline to dial a number.

The phone rang for a long time before it was answered.

As soon as the call connected, Serena said, “Jiang Jiang, it’s me… Have you found out his whereabouts? Good, send someone to follow him. Don’t act rashly. If anyone else finds him, make sure to protect him… Uh-huh, I understand. Thanks for your hard work!”

After hanging up the phone, Serena sat blankly on the couch for a while before getting up to take a shower.

Once finished, she rummaged through her wardrobe and pulled out a sexy red lingerie set, putting it on.

Leo still hadn’t returned.

Serena got up, unlocked the door, and wrapped herself in a blanket, hugging her knees as she sat on the bed lost in thought.

Time ticked by, and she began to doubt whether Leo would come back at all.

If he just walked out like that, it would be quite the hassle.

And this delicious opportunity was right at her fingertips, yet she hadn’t been able to take a bite; it felt like such a shame!

After a moment of contemplation, Serena tightened her bathrobe and stepped out the door.

She headed straight for the terrace, where she spotted Leo talking to a stunning girl.

As she approached, she realized the girl was the one brought by Shang Ruzhen earlier.

The girl was laughing and chatting with Leo, seemingly full of life.

Upon seeing Serena, the girl smiled at her before turning and walking away.

That smile was… blinding!

“Leo…” 

Serena hugged him from behind, resting her face against his back. “Do you know that girl?”

Leo's back stiffened slightly as he responded ambiguously with a "Mm," before calmly saying, "I guess I know her. She’s a student at Qian University too..."
