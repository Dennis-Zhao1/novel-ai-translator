**Chapter 1: The Turning Point**

This delicate, young grass really suits my taste.

“Serena Zhou, I’ll kill you…”

Instinctively, Serena didn’t dodge; instead, she stepped in front of Leo Sterling.

“Serena, watch out!”

Leo had just kicked the assailant, but before he could deal with the other attacker, he urgently pushed Serena aside with his palm.

Serena stumbled but managed to regain her balance. When she turned back, she saw the fruit knife in the attacker’s hand had already plunged into Leo’s abdomen.

“Uncle Leo!”

Her eyes widened in shock as she rushed forward, shoving the dazed attacker, Clara Yan, aside. Turning, she called for a doctor while pressing her hands against the bleeding wound on Leo’s abdomen.

Fortunately, they were right outside the hospital.

Help arrived quickly.

Leo was soon wheeled into the emergency room. Just as he entered, his assistant, Huang Liang, hurried in.

Seeing Serena, he asked anxiously, “Miss Zhou, how is he? Is it serious?”

Serena’s expression darkened as she whispered, “Uncle Leo just went into surgery; we don’t know the specifics yet… What about Clara and Shuying?”

At the mention of the two, Huang Liang's eyes flared with anger. “They’ve been subdued by my men. How dare they hurt him… Don’t worry, Miss Zhou. I won’t let them get away with this. You can leave everything regarding the Yan and Shang families to us!”

Serena shot him a surprised glance. Was he being too presumptuous?

But she didn’t mind letting Leo’s people handle these messy matters.

That night, Serena waited for over an hour before Leo was wheeled out of the operating room. The doctor informed her that while the knife wound was deep, it hadn’t hit any vital organs. The wound was stitched, and a long list of care instructions was provided.

As Leo was wheeled out, he was still under anesthesia, unconscious.

Serena naturally stayed behind to care for him.

At two in the morning, Leo finally woke up.

As he opened his eyes, his gaze fell upon Serena, who had dozed off beside his hospital bed.

Serena looked peaceful as she slept, her breathing soft and steady. In her slumber, she had shed her daytime strength and sharpness, her face youthful and innocent like that of a naïve student.

This version of Serena was impossible not to find captivating.

Leo couldn’t help but reach out, gently stroking her hair.

Serena, being a light sleeper, stirred at his touch.

Upon seeing Leo awake, she quickly straightened up, concern flooding her features. “Uncle Leo, you’re awake? How’s the wound? Does it hurt? Should I call the doctor?”

Leo shook his head.

She continued, “I’m so sorry, Uncle Leo. I didn’t expect my conflict with the Shang family would involve you and put you in harm’s way… And thank you. If you hadn’t pushed me out of the way, that knife would have hit me… It must hurt, right? I’m really sorry!”

Leo reached out to her. The anesthetic was wearing off, and he felt some pain from the wound, but he concealed it well. 

His expression remained suave and elegant, his voice deep and resonant. “The wound isn’t deep; I’m fine. Don’t worry or feel guilty. And as for thanking me…”

Serena glanced at his outstretched hand, hesitating to respond.

He continued, “… there’s no need for that between us!”

Serena narrowed her eyes slightly and replied earnestly, “Uncle Leo, although it might not be the best time to say this, I’m serious about dissolving our engagement. You don’t need to keep testing me.”

What existed between them… was nothing at all, and this ambiguous tone was rather unappealing!

“You saved my life tonight, and I will definitely repay this kindness. If you ever need me, Uncle Leo, I will face any challenge for you!”

Leo chuckled at her serious demeanor. “I don’t need you facing any challenges, Serena. What I want is for you to be my wife, to walk through life together, never parting!”

After saying that, he once again gestured for her to take his hand.

Serena remained still, her eyes narrowing as she candidly replied, “But Uncle Leo, I don’t like you. And… aren’t you afraid of my ulterior motives?”

Leo was taken aback. “Of course, I know you don’t love me, but I’ve always believed a marriage without love but based on mutual benefit is more stable. As for your ulterior motives… Since I first experienced love, I’ve never met a girl who purely loved me without wanting something else…”

“You not liking me isn’t surprising, and wanting something from me is only natural.”

Leo said, half-seriously, “If you tell me you want nothing but me, I’d actually find that unsettling. So when you say you want to dissolve the engagement… I can’t agree. Instead, I’d like to turn our engagement into a wedding right away. What do you think?”

Serena looked at him silently, not responding.

Leo thought she needed time to consider.

He softened his tone and continued, “Serena, I’m serious about you. I know we have an age gap, but this delicate grass of yours is exactly my taste. From the first moment I saw you, I wanted to savor it…”

When Leo spoke sweet words, his gaze was focused and passionate, making it seem genuine. Yet, there was a lack of sincerity beneath it all.

Serena found it hard to empathize with his feelings.

Still, she didn’t interrupt his heartfelt confession, instead lowering her head in silence, seemingly touched…

“Serena, forget about the foolish things I’ve done in the past. Give me a chance, and let’s start anew, okay?”

A mix of confusion and softness flickered in Serena’s eyes. “Is Uncle Leo really…”

“I am!” he interjected eagerly.

“Well, I’ll reluctantly believe your feelings. In the past, Uncle Leo, you took out your frustrations on me because of my brother’s betrayal of Yingying, and I can overlook the hurt. But I still have one question…”

“Ask away.”

“Why do you insist on me finding a toy boy to sleep with? Is it true what they say about you in that regard? If so…”

A hint of shyness colored Serena’s cheeks. “I think I’d find it hard to cooperate, considering I may have a pure longing for this matter! Even though I’m involved with Leo, it’s just acting; we haven’t had any intimate contact…”

As she spoke, Serena's demeanor was innocent and unpretentious, reminiscent of a naive girl who knows nothing yet harbors anticipation.
