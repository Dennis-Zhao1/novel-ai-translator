**Isn't it what Sister likes?**

Serena Zhou didn’t usually bring up these matters when she spent time with Leo Sterling. But she believed that Ethan would inform Leo about them.

Leo was never really involved in this situation; claiming he didn’t exert his full effort was an unfounded accusation. But Ethan…

Though Ethan claimed to be Leo’s subordinate, a person as charming and socially adept as him couldn’t possibly respect only Leo. The Sterling family were all Ethan’s superiors, and regardless of whether Ethan truly gave it his all, he would always appear to be fully devoted to Leo on the surface. This meant that Serena could never reveal any hint of Ethan's supposed lack of effort in front of Leo.

The most crucial point was that dealing with Duan Kangyu was Serena’s business. She couldn’t, and shouldn’t, hope to rely solely on others.

“Jiang Jiang, we need to come up with our own plan. We don’t have anyone in the East Loft, so we’re unsure of the situation inside. Is it really heavily guarded by Duan Kangyu? But there are plenty of things we can strategize about in the prison…” Serena pulled out a mint candy, tossing one to Jiang Jiang while unwrapping another for herself.

“…I want to see if Duan Kangyu truly doesn’t care about Tang Ying’s life!”

Jiang Jiang tossed the mint wrapper into the trash. “Alright, I’ll think of a way!”

“You’ve already been exposed; the risk is too great. I’ll find someone else!”

“Who will you find? That guy named Ethan?”

Serena shook her head, her expression serious. Ethan was too experienced; he gave her an even worse feeling than Duan Kangyu.

Serena had to be cautious around him.

Just as she was discussing the next steps with Jiang Jiang, their colleague, Miss Dai, knocked on the door and announced that Leo had arrived.

As the year-end approached, Serena was exceptionally busy, while Leo, having finished his thesis, had more free time to prepare for his exams. Most afternoons, he would bring lunch to Serena, keep her company while she ate, and even nap beside her afterward.

As soon as Miss Dai mentioned Leo’s arrival, Jiang Jiang quickly stood up, sensing the need to leave. “I’ll take my leave now.”

Serena nodded at her. Just as Jiang Jiang exited the office, Leo knocked and stepped inside.

“Serena…”

Leo’s hearty lunch was always plentiful, filled with meat, vegetables, soup, and fruit. Of course, it also included his handsome face, which never failed to brighten Serena’s day, along with his shy yet radiant smile.

“Little Leo, you’re here!” Serena couldn’t help but smile broadly upon seeing him.

She stood up, linked her arm with Leo’s, and followed him to the sofa, watching him open the lunchbox and carefully arrange the dishes before handing her the chopsticks.

Serena feigned innocence, looking up at him, “You have to feed me!”

Leo shook his head, both helpless and indulgent, as he picked up some food and brought it to her lips, reminding her to chew slowly, like a parent caring for a child.

“I feel like I’m raising a daughter…”

In front of Leo, Serena had a knack for being spoiled and soft. Leo often felt like he was caring for a child—one that was both an “eater” and a little addictively charming.

Serena pondered over his words, her eyes sparkling mischievously. “What do you mean? If you have a daughter in the future, you’ll spoil her like you spoil me now? That won’t do! If you start doting on her, you won’t have time for me. So I don’t want a daughter…”

As she savored the spicy beef in her mouth, she declared, “...I want a son! That way, I’ll have two men to pamper me!”

Serena daydreamed about her future, imagining being adored by two beloved men, making her current hardships feel trivial.

“By the way, Little Leo, do you prefer boys or girls?”

Leo gently pinched the tip of Serena’s nose, his eyes crinkling with affection as he replied, “As long as it’s your child and mine, I’ll be happy with either a boy or a girl!”

Truth be told, Leo wasn’t particularly fond of children. Taking care of them was time-consuming and exhausting. But the thought of having a child with Serena filled him with warmth.

“Little Leo, you’re so wonderful! I really want to have a baby with you right now; I’m sure you’d be an amazing father…”

Serena’s words made Leo feel that their relationship was progressing steadily and solidly.

“Have we decided about going to my family for the New Year this year? Once our wedding is set, we’ll enjoy two years as just the two of us before starting our family planning…”

Leo found himself swept up in Serena’s visions, following her lead. He’d always considered himself a traditional man, with building a family as part of his life plan. Although in his plan, settling down came after establishing a career, he thought he’d have to wait until he was thirty to consider it seriously.

But how could he have known he would meet Serena so early? For her, he felt it was worth bringing those plans forward.

When it came to visiting the Sterling family for the New Year, Serena hesitated for a moment. “Um, sure! This year, we’ll go to your place first, and then you’ll come to mine. Didn’t we agree on that? Why ask again?”

“I originally thought I could easily deal with the East Loft and Duan Kangyu before the New Year, but I didn’t realize how deeply rooted Duan Kangyu was in the East Loft. After the New Year, I’ll be going back to Tianxing for a while, so don’t worry too much about Duan Kangyu!”

Leo didn’t want any threats between him and Serena. While he didn’t believe that Duan Kangyu would dare to scheme against Serena after learning his identity, he was still a nuisance. Leo had planned to confront Duan Kangyu earlier, but he’d pushed everything onto Ethan since he had exams to prepare for.

Now that the exams were over, he was finally free to focus on these matters, especially after noticing that Serena had been busier than ever lately. While Leo supported her dedication to her career, he still felt a pang of concern for her struggles.

Serena was surprised. “You’re going to Tianxing after the New Year? Are you planning to deal with…”

Seeing that Serena had nearly finished eating, Leo leaned down to start clearing the dishes. He spoke casually, “I can’t leave everything to you and Ethan. Some things Ethan handles may not even be effective!”

Once he tidied up, he pulled Serena close on the sofa, his gaze serious as he continued, “I have to deal with Duan Kangyu. Just thinking about what he did to you…”

Leo held Serena's left hand, gently tracing the scar on her palm where a cigarette burn had left its mark. The sight filled him with rage. “...I want to beat him up first and then repay him tenfold for what he did to you!”

Being loved and cared for felt incredibly good. Serena’s heart brimmed with joy as she smiled sweetly, “Little Leo, you’re so wonderful! Meeting you is the greatest fortune of my life!”

Hearing this, Leo pulled Serena even tighter into his embrace. “Meeting you is also my greatest blessing, Serena. You don’t know how much I love you!”

Love truly was a beautiful, warm, and soft thing!

“Little Leo, you haven’t called me ‘Sister’ much lately…”

“Really?”

“Yep!”

“Maybe I just want to change how I call you…”

“To what?”

“Hmm... how about ‘Wifey’?”

Serena laughed and playfully punched Leo’s chest with her little fist, feigning annoyance. “You’re so bad! You’re getting worse!”

Leo leaned down and pecked her lips softly, his voice low. “I can be even worse if that’s what you like, right?”

Serena tilted her face up, her tongue teasingly licking her soft lips. “Mmm, I like it! Sister is absolutely in love with you!”

With that, she leaned in and kissed him…
