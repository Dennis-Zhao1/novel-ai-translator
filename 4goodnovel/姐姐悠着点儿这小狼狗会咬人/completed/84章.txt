**The Sheng Family Will Never Allow a Illegitimate Daughter to Enter Their Gates**

Serena Zhou’s expression was as frosty as her demeanor as she coldly stated, “Because the file you looked at has been tampered with…”

Jian Shu was incredulous, “How do you know that?”

But Serena knew much more than that. “Everything you want to know is in the information I provided you. However, a lot of it can’t be submitted as evidence…”

“...Attorney Jian, I need to give you a heads-up. This case is going to be incredibly difficult to win. It’s likely that your undefeated streak will come to an end. Are you sure you don’t want to consider taking on a different case?”

Serena’s statement left Jian Shu momentarily confused. “What do you mean, Ms. Zhou?”

Serena handed over the files regarding Sister Jiang’s case, where she had been imprisoned and tormented by Duan Kangyu. “Take a look at these two cases and see which one you feel more confident about handling.”

Jian Shu took the files, flipping through them, his confusion deepening as he looked back at Serena. “You want me to take this case? What about Ms. Meng…?”

“The battleground for Ms. Meng’s case isn’t in the courtroom, and you won’t win, Attorney Jian.”

Jian Shu seemed to grasp her implication a little better now. After a moment of thought, he asked, “What about Young Master Sheng’s side…?”

“I’ll explain everything to him. Don’t worry; I won’t put you in a difficult position.”

Jian Shu was a rather clever person, and Serena’s vague hints were enough for him to understand the situation. At this point, she didn’t have the energy to deal with Duan Kangyu, but she was also concerned that he might stir up trouble for her.

If Jian Shu took on Sister Jiang’s case, with Lu Yan assisting from the sidelines, it would certainly distract Duan Kangyu for a while. 

On the eighth day of the Lunar New Year, Leo Sterling’s grandmother was discharged from the hospital. He called, expressing his desire to return to Qianhai immediately. “I’ll come back as soon as Grandma falls asleep tonight…”

Serena, however, urged him to spend more time with his grandmother, explaining that she was too busy and wouldn’t have time to accompany him even if he returned. “If I need your help, I promise I won’t hold back, but for now, it’s fine, so just stay with Grandma until after the fifteenth!”

Serena’s thoughtfulness touched Leo, yet he felt a hint of disappointment. “Sister, don’t you miss me?”

“Of course I do! I think about you every night!”

Leo chuckled softly. “Only at night?”

Serena nodded honestly. “During the day, my mind is racing with all sorts of things, and I really don’t have the energy to think of you…”

Leo felt a pang of sympathy for Serena’s struggles. “You’ve worked hard, Sister. By the way, my aunt said she’ll be coming to Qianhai next week for an inspection. Shengyu is planning to build a new logistics center there, and she hopes that the Zhou family can collaborate…”

Serena forced a smile, pleasantly surprised by this bit of good news. “That sounds great! I’ll go pick her up when she arrives.”

“You don’t have to; she’ll have a large entourage with her. She said she’d find you after she’s done…”

Serena obediently replied, “Okay~”

On the eleventh of the Lunar New Year, Sheng He came to Qianhai for the inspection and invited Serena to join her. After the inspection, Sheng He treated Serena to dinner privately. They dined at a restaurant of Serena’s choosing, as she had mentioned feeling unwell in her stomach lately.

Sheng He was undoubtedly a kind and gentle elder in private.

Before the meal was served, Sheng He handed Serena a small gift, saying she hoped Serena wouldn’t hold it against her for not hosting well during her last visit to the Sheng family. “My brother and sister-in-law aren’t bad people; it’s just that Linlin and Xiaoi’s matters hit them hard. I hope you can understand them!”

Serena naturally nodded in understanding, even promising to encourage Leo to visit them more often.

Sheng He smiled in praise, “Teng Teng didn’t choose wrong. Serena, you’re truly a filial child!”

Sheng He’s compliment seemed casual, yet Serena took it seriously. Her eyes reflected a hint of confusion as she sought confirmation, “Do you really think I’m a filial child, Mr. Sheng?”

Sheng He lifted her teacup, taking a sip before deflecting, “The person my Teng Teng chose must excel in every aspect.”

Serena nodded in agreement, “Yes, Leo is indeed a wonderful person. It’s just that…”

“It’s just what?”

Serena leaned back in her chair, adopting a more distant posture, and smiled lightly, “It’s just a pity that he ended up with someone as awful as me…”

Sheng He replied coolly, “Miss Zhou, while your background may not be the most respectable, and your looks and education aren’t exceptional, there’s no need to underestimate yourself. Besides, you and Teng Teng are still young. Who knows what the future holds…”

Serena suddenly laughed, “That’s true; who can say what the future will bring?”

As the dishes were served, Serena took a few bites before abruptly standing up. “Excuse me,” she said, covering her mouth as she hurried to the restroom.

When she returned to her seat, Serena noticed that Sheng He was watching her with a somewhat peculiar expression.

“Miss Zhou, are you feeling alright?”

“Oh, I’m fine. It’s said that early pregnancy can be like this.”

“Early pregnancy?” Sheng He couldn’t hide her surprise. “You… you’re really pregnant? Does Leo know?”

Serena’s gaze darkened, and the smile on her lips lost its warmth. “I’m planning to give him a surprise. I’ll tell him when he comes back. Until then, I’d appreciate it if you could keep this a secret for me, Mr. Sheng.”

Sheng He didn’t follow up on Serena’s words. Instead, she asked, “Are you… planning to keep this child?”

“Of course! Leo and I are preparing to get married, so I’m definitely going to have this baby. Why do you ask?”

Sheng He dropped her facade of politeness and spoke directly to Serena. “Miss Zhou, I’m quite straightforward, so I hope you won’t mind. We don’t want you to have this child…”

Serena’s tone turned incredulous. “We?”

“Yes, we. My brother, my sister-in-law, and I. We all don’t want you to have this child, and we won’t agree to your marriage with Leo!”

Serena trembled slightly, her voice coming out weak and helpless. “Why?”

Her expression showed no trace of surprise or confusion, but her voice betrayed her vulnerability.

Sheng He replied coldly, “Because the Sheng family will never allow an illegitimate daughter to enter their gates!”

“To be honest, Miss Zhou, did you know about Leo’s identity from the beginning? Did you deliberately get close to him, seduce him, and then use the Sheng family’s influence to deal with the Shang family, hoping to escape Duan Kangyu’s entanglement?”
