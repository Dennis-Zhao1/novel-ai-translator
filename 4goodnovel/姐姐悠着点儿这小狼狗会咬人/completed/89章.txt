I'm Not a Businessman

"Yeah, you know him. I heard he broke up with..." Adam Song paused, glancing at Serena Zhou.

Leo Sterling also turned to Serena.

Only then did Serena respond with a soft "Oh," saying, "You’re talking about my ex-sister-in-law. She and my brother have been separated for a while now..."

It seemed that the name "Xia Xiuhua" had become somewhat unfamiliar to her. She expressed mild surprise, "...But I didn’t expect he would be your high school classmate."

Adam nodded, "Yeah, we were pretty close in high school, but after I joined the army for college, we gradually lost touch..."

Although Adam was unaware of the complicated history between Serena's brother and Xia Xiuhua, he knew they were no longer together. This was likely an unpleasant topic for Serena, so he quickly shifted the conversation to lighter matters, like some embarrassing stories from Leo's childhood.

Serena felt little emotion about it. She had already done her homework on Xia Xiuhua and was fully aware of his connection to Adam.

Upon arriving at the Sterling residence, it was lunchtime. General Sterling and his wife happened to be home for the weekend.

As soon as they entered, Serena greeted them sweetly, presenting each of them with carefully prepared gifts. One of them was a large box of fresh lychees for Lin Su, and although General Sterling's gift was unknown, it was beautifully packaged. However, when he took the box, he felt it was oddly light, almost as if it were empty.

The lunch spread was lavish. This time, the General and his wife were slightly warmer to Serena compared to their last meeting. They initiated conversations with her and actively responded to her questions. Yet, they remained indifferent toward Leo, who kept mostly to himself, appearing almost invisible and awkward, as if he were the guest at the Sterling household.

Adam, despite his tough, rugged demeanor, was the life of the table, filling the air with ease. Serena could sense his discomfort; after all, the three main figures of the Sterling family each had their own cool disposition. Leo, aside from occasionally helping Serena, barely moved. He ate very little, sitting silently with his towering height of nearly six feet three inches, but somehow seeming small and out of place.

Seeing Leo like this tugged at Serena’s heart. She reached under the table to hold his hand. He turned to her with a warm smile in response. In that moment, Serena felt that having Leo by her side was truly wonderful.

After lunch, Leo took Serena to visit his grandmother's house, with Adam driving them. Halfway there, Adam received a phone call. After hanging up, he told Leo he had to return to the army immediately due to an urgent task and needed to grab some things first.

"I'm sorry, Leo. I need to take this car back. You'll have to drive yourselves or let the driver take you..." he said regretfully.

Just as they were nearing the grandmother's house, Leo furrowed his brow. "Brother, can't you just drop us off first and then go back for your things? Or I could have someone from the family send them over?"

Adam hesitated, "Little Leo, it's an emergency. I have no choice. Serena, you can understand, right?"

Of course, Serena graciously said she understood. Leo, still confused, insisted, "Then stop the car now, and I'll take a taxi with Serena."

Adam remained unfazed. "That won't work; there are too many things in this car. It's better to go back and switch cars. Plus..." he glanced at the darkening sky, "...it looks like it's going to rain heavily."

As soon as Adam finished speaking, a flash of lightning split the dark clouds, followed by a loud clap of thunder.

Leo was adamantly against returning to the Sterling house for a detour, but Adam had already turned the car around, heading back up the mountain.

Although Lin Su didn't have a fondness for Leo, she was still dutiful to her own mother. However, due to her past disdain for Leo, Grandma Lin didn’t appreciate General Sterling and his wife either. As a result, any gifts from the General and his wife were always sent with Leo to the Lin family.

The moment the three of them turned back to the Sterling residence, the rain began to pour. The sky lit up with flashes of lightning, and the rain fell in heavy drops, striking the roofs and leaves, creating a cacophony of noise.

This left Leo with no choice but to stay at the Sterling residence until the rain let up.

"Leo, let’s go and get some exercise..." Adam proposed.

Leo frowned, "Weren't you in a hurry to leave?"

Adam handed one of the squash rackets to Leo nonchalantly, "The mission just got canceled. Besides, driving in this weather would be dangerous..."

Leo raised an eyebrow in disbelief. "Aren't military orders supposed to be absolute? You just cancel a mission like that? Seems a bit trivial."

Adam shrugged, dismissing Leo’s challenge without response.

Leo felt something was off, but he couldn’t quite place what it was. He worried about Serena being bored at the Sterling house, so he snatched both rackets from Adam and took Serena’s hand, wanting to go exercise together.

However, General Sterling suddenly interjected, “You go with Adam; let Miss Zhou keep me company for a bit…”

Leo looked surprised at his father again before turning to Serena, who smiled and nodded at him, “I’m really not in the mood to move. You guys go ahead!”

Leo frowned, “Then I’ll just play one game. Serena, see you in a bit!”

As soon as Leo and Adam left, General Sterling set his teacup back on the tray and scrutinized Serena with an intense gaze, his voice firm and commanding. 

“Follow me to my study!”

Serena’s expression turned serious, and with a composed demeanor, she stood and followed General Sterling into the study.

The study was much larger and brighter than her grandfather's. Outside was a large balcony. Despite the pouring rain, the soundproofing was excellent, allowing them to speak freely.

General Sterling took a seat at one side of a stone chess table on the balcony and gestured for Serena to sit across from him.

Serena obediently complied.

General Sterling wasted no time with pleasantries, slamming the gift box Serena had given him onto the stone table. His sharp gaze scrutinized her as he pointed to a videotape inside the box, coldly asking, "What’s the meaning of this gift?"

Serena met his gaze directly, calmly replying, “I hope to establish a collaboration with you, General Sterling. This gift is a gesture of my sincerity as a younger generation.”

General Sterling squinted slightly, “You want to discuss a collaboration with me?”

Serena sat up straight, refusing to be intimidated by his imposing presence. 

“Yes.”

“I’m not a businessman…”

“But you are the head of the Sterling family.”

General Sterling fell silent for a moment. “Speak plainly. No need for roundabout talk!”

Serena nodded obediently, her eyes dark and serious as she enunciated each word: “I want Song Weiming’s life!”
