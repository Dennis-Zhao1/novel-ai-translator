### Chapter Excerpt

"I will never change what I believe in for a lifetime."

"Serena?" Serena Zhou couldn't help but feel a bit annoyed at being addressed so casually. "That’s quite presumptuous!"

Leo Sterling chuckled lightly. "I’ve always been the older one here, you know that."

Under Serena's playful guidance, Leo had grown increasingly mischievous. This transformation brought Serena a sense of satisfaction. After all, a relationship is most exhilarating when both partners are equally matched. With Leo's newfound cheekiness, her previously anxious heart finally eased. It seemed that Duan Kangyu's visit to Qian University wasn't to see Leo after all. 

But why was Duan Kangyu really at Qian University?

Following Leo's playful banter, Serena teased him with a couple of risqué remarks before turning serious. "Little Leo, I can’t believe Mr. Lu is actually your subordinate, and I didn’t expect you to be General Sheng’s son…"

From a distance, Leo couldn't see the expression on Serena's face, which made it easier for her to act. When Serena’s tone shifted, Leo ceased his laughter and replied earnestly, "Serena, my dad is my dad, and I am me. Although I was born into the Sheng family, I grew up with my grandparents. Very few people know I'm Sheng Yuan’s son. I’m quite distant from the Sheng family, really. I've barely visited them throughout my life, so please don't feel pressured."

"That's easy to say, but you are still Sheng Yuan's son and Sheng He’s nephew… I feel completely unprepared for this. The impact is just too great."

With a soft tone, Serena added, "Little Leo, I used to think about keeping you, and did you find that particularly amusing?"

Leo recalled what Serena had said to him that day in the restaurant. 

"I didn’t find it amusing; I found it infuriating!" 

To Leo, maintaining a relationship solely based on physical pleasure, wrapped up in the guise of being taken care of, was not amusing but rather absurd and tragic. 

He stated solemnly, "Sister, I’ve never cared about someone's background or family. What matters to me is you. I love you, so to me, you are the best and most precious person. Nothing compares!"

Instead of comforting Serena, his words only deepened her worries. "What if one day you don’t love me anymore?"

Leo had never seen Serena like this—so anxious and uncertain. In the past, he had often wondered how much she truly valued their relationship. He longed for the day when she would cherish him as he cherished her, constantly on edge, fearing she might push him away.

But when that day finally came, Leo felt no joy; only heartache.

He replied earnestly, "How could I ever stop loving you? You should know me better than that. I’m a stubborn person. What I believe in will never change, and the person I love will be the same."

"So, don’t wander off into wild thoughts. No matter whose son I am, my love for you will only grow with time."

In some ways, Leo was indeed stubborn to the point of being rigid. Yet, Serena was oblivious to how steadfast he was when it came to love. For now, she chose to believe he meant it.

"Knowing you feel this way puts my mind at ease. Now, about Mr. Lu…"

"Lu Yan is the helper I found for you. Don’t be shy; he’s quite capable and can handle any tricky problems you throw at him. Just delegate to him!" 

Serena responded with a muted “Oh,” her icy gaze now distant and profound. "Then I will… trust him to deal with Duan Kangyu."

"Yes, don’t spend too much energy worrying about Duan Kangyu!"

If it were possible, Leo thought, he would wish Duan Kangyu would never appear before Serena again. Although he never considered Duan Kangyu a stumbling block in their relationship, he still found him bothersome.

With the Sheng family backing her, Serena thought, what did she have to fear from Duan Kangyu? At the very least, she could confront him openly, with the support of the Sheng family lurking in the shadows.

Since then, Serena had entered a furious mode. Tang Ying had manipulated Xia Xiuhua into taking action against Zhou Jingchen, with recordings and videos that provided undeniable evidence. Murder was a serious crime; although Zhou Jingchen was alive, his situation was almost as dire.

Once Tang Ying was convicted, she wouldn’t see the light of day for at least ten years.

Duan Kangyu, while keeping the news of Tang Ying's imprisonment under wraps, was doing everything he could to get her out. He thought that with the Duan family's extensive connections built over decades in Qianhai, getting Tang Ying released would be a piece of cake. But those once-close friends and allies were now avoiding him, refusing to show their faces. When they occasionally answered his calls, they subtly expressed their inability to help.

Duan Kangyu had prepared generous gifts but was at a loss about how and to whom to present them. It felt as if he had suddenly been placed on the city's blacklist overnight.

Not only that, but his reputation had suffered a huge blow. One particularly sensational incident on social media involved a former partner publicly accusing him of abuse, and old footage resurfaced showing her testifying against him on television.

In the video, the girl wore oversized sunglasses that almost obscured her face. She claimed to be a university student from the foreign language department at Qian University. In her senior year, she had interned at Donglou Group, where Duan Kangyu had pursued her aggressively.

She stated that at that time, she had someone she liked, so she rejected Duan Kangyu’s advances. But he believed she was playing hard to get. One night, he got someone to intoxicate her and then assaulted her.

After awakening and threatening to go to the police, she provoked Duan Kangyu’s fury. He then kidnapped her and locked her in his basement for half a year.

During that time, he would often beat and abuse her, pushing her to the brink of a mental breakdown. To survive, she had to feign compliance and submit. Yet, Duan Kangyu still didn’t trust her. It wasn’t until she became pregnant that he finally released her from the basement.

However, even after her release, he didn’t relax his control over her. The girl devoted herself to him for three years, giving birth to a child, who tragically died shortly after due to suffocation. Duan Kangyu suspected she had harmed the child and often lashed out at her when he was drunk.

Eventually, she could no longer endure it and managed to escape from Duan Kangyu. Immediately after her escape, she reported him to the police. But due to a lack of evidence, the police refused to file a case.

The girl had always appeared glamorous and composed in public, but it was evident that she was emotionally distressed. Yet, she bore no visible injuries. Fearing retribution from Duan Kangyu against herself and her family, she had to choose to stand out and seek help from public opinion, hoping to find justice.
