You really don’t need to get so into character.

“I don’t like takeout, and you should try to avoid it too…” Leo Sterling frowned as he stood up and headed toward the kitchen. 

“…I’ll check if there’s anything to eat in there.”

The kitchen was spacious, filled with pots, pans, and various utensils that looked like they had been used before, some even showing signs of wear. Leo opened the refrigerator, hoping to find some ingredients, only to be disappointed to find it stocked with bottles of alcohol.

He closed the fridge door with a sigh and returned to the living room, telling Serena Zhou, “I’m going to buy some groceries. You stay here and wait for me; I’ll be back soon!”

Serena glanced at the darkened window outside, her brows slightly furrowing as she pouted. “You're going to buy groceries and cook at this hour? When will we be able to eat?” 

She was really, really hungry!

“I’ll be quick, don’t worry!” Leo flashed her a reassuring smile before grabbing his phone and hurrying out the door.

As soon as the door clicked shut, Serena collapsed onto the sofa, staring blankly at the ceiling. The affection in her eyes vanished in an instant.

She pulled out a mint candy and popped it into her mouth, trying to lift her spirits. Taking a deep breath, she pushed herself off the couch and slowly made her way to the study.

This apartment was somewhere she had always wanted to visit but never found the time to. The password for the study was the same as the front door—Leo’s birthday.

After hesitating for a moment, she opened the study door and stepped inside. 

The scene before her was a chaotic mess that she hadn’t expected. Books, paintings, and papers were scattered all over the floor. She glanced at her own injured foot, thought better of it, and closed the door, slowly retreating back to the sofa.

Just as she had finished dialing a number on her phone, Leo returned with bags of groceries.

“Wow, you’re fast…” Serena couldn’t help but be amazed.

“There's a supermarket downstairs, super convenient!” Leo placed a large bag on the coffee table and began unloading its contents one by one.

“You’re hungry, right? Grab a snack, but don’t eat too much; I’ll whip up a couple of quick dishes for dinner!” Leo sorted through the snacks he had bought and then carried the remaining fruits and vegetables into the kitchen.

Serena watched him bustling around in the kitchen, reaching for the bag of chips on the table and tearing it open. The satisfying crunch filled the air as she munched away.

Before she could finish the bag, Leo had already cooked a plate of shredded pork and a plate of stir-fried greens, along with a bowl of tomato and egg soup that he placed on the table.

With the dishes ready, the rice still wasn’t done, so Leo set a bowl of soup in front of her. “Stop munching on chips; drink some soup first!”

Serena looked at the warm soup in front of her, then back at the handsome young man who was busying himself in the kitchen. She felt a wave of contentment wash over her.

After sipping the soup to warm her stomach, she genuinely praised him, “I can’t believe you can cook, and it tastes this good…”

Leo sat across from her, serving himself a bowl of soup. He took a sip but frowned, clearly dissatisfied. “I rushed the soup today; it’s barely drinkable. Give the dishes a try…”

He nudged the plate of food closer to her.

Serena cherished how he took care of her in these little ways, her eyes crinkling into a bright smile.

Leo caught her adoring gaze and couldn’t help but urge her, “Aren't you hungry? Why are you just staring at me?”

Serena beamed, feeling utterly satisfied. “Not only are you handsome, but you’re also so considerate and gentle. I feel like I’ve hit the jackpot…”

Leo shot her a sidelong glance, unimpressed by her flattery. He gently burst her bubble. “We only have three months; you really don’t need to get so into character!”

Serena’s smile froze.

She knew this wasn’t a topic worth discussing, so she suppressed her emotions and focused on her food.

Seeing her sudden shift in mood, Leo felt a twinge of regret, but the words had already left his mouth, impossible to take back. 

He used the serving chopsticks to add some vegetables to Serena’s bowl, speaking softly, “Don’t just eat rice; get some veggies in you!”

With his gesture of kindness, Serena felt a renewed sense of hope. She looked up at him and grinned like a fool.

Leo was amazed at how quickly she could change her mood.

After their meal, Leo cleaned up the dishes and brought over a bowl of grapes for her.

Serena felt a rush of satisfaction being taken care of like this. She hastily peeled a grape and offered it to Leo.

Leo, feeling slightly bashful, hesitated but eventually opened his mouth to accept the grape. However, when she offered him a second one, he gently pushed her hand away.

His gaze fell on Serena’s feet, and he asked softly, “How’s your foot? Does it hurt?”

Serena smiled brightly, shaking her head nonchalantly. “Not at all!”

She sensed that Leo was preparing to leave. A hint of regret washed over her as she glanced at her foot. 

Even if he stayed tonight, it didn’t seem like they could do much together.

“What about your left hand and right arm? Are they okay? They don’t hurt either?” 

During dinner, Leo had noticed that Serena was using her left hand to eat, her movements a bit clumsy. The back of her left hand was wrapped in bandages, and although her right arm was free from a cast, it seemed she couldn’t exert too much strength. Coupled with her injured foot, it felt like she had too many wounds for such a small frame.

The world Serena lived in… Leo furrowed his brows.

“They’re mostly healed, not painful,” she replied, maintaining a carefree attitude, her expression light.

It was hard to tell if she was genuinely unbothered or just putting on a brave face.

Leo had many questions weighing on his mind, but noticing the time, he realized it was already quite late.

“Are you staying here alone tonight?” 

He hesitated, wanting to leave, but his thoughts had been completely muddled by her presence.

As much as he didn’t regret agreeing to date her, he wanted to take some time alone to sort through his thoughts. He didn’t want to be just a temporary presence in her life for three months.

Serena nodded, understanding his concern. She smiled reassuringly. “You don’t need to worry; I can take care of myself!”

Yet Leo remained unconvinced. “How will you… take a shower?”

With her left hand and foot injured, washing up was indeed a daunting task!

Serena’s eyes twinkled mischievously as she smiled sweetly and replied, “Well, I can’t really take a shower by myself. How about you… stay and help me?”
