**Go and Complain!**

Serena Zhou quickly got herself ready, hastily eating breakfast before rushing off to the company. Leo Sterling, although he didn't have any classes that morning, still left home with her.

The two exchanged reluctant goodbyes. Just before Serena got into the car, Leo couldn't help but ask, "Are you coming over tonight?"

Serena's dark eyes twinkled as she contemplated whether Leo had any plans for the evening. After giving it a thought, she smiled and replied, "Sure!"

Leo's face lit up with joy. "Then I'll make some soup for you tonight while you wait!"

Serena watched him, feeling warmth blossom in her heart as he smiled back at her and waved goodbye. This young man radiated a kind of vitality that made her feel lively and optimistic.

With that warm anticipation, Serena found that the various tricky tasks ahead of her today didn’t seem so daunting after all. The only downside was that she had to go to the airport in the afternoon to pick someone up, as Duan Kangyu and Shang Ruyan were back from their vacation.

Though she dreaded the trip, the construction project couldn’t be delayed any further. She needed to obtain the signed guarantee documents from Duan Kangyu within the week. If not, the loan from Qianhai Bank wouldn’t go through, leading to potentially immeasurable losses.

After neatly organizing herself, Serena made sure to arrive at the airport just on time. She waited for over ten minutes at the exit but only saw one of Shang Ruyan’s bodyguards coming out, while Duan Kangyu was nowhere in sight.

Just as confusion began to creep in, she caught sight of Shang Ruyan strutting over in her high heels, arms crossed and looking quite smug. 

"Well, if it isn't the illustrious President Zhou of the Shangzhou Group! What brings you here all alone? Oh, coming to pick up Kangyu?" Shang Ruyan's voice was sharp as she launched into her taunts, clearly unimpressed with Serena's presence.

"Too bad, Kangyu had to change his flight to Japan at the last minute. Didn’t you get the memo?"

Serena shot her a cold glance. Since Duan Kangyu wasn’t back, she had no patience or time to entertain Shang Ruyan’s mindless chatter and turned to leave.

Shang Ruyan, feeling disregarded, was infuriated and quickly blocked Serena's path. "Hey, I'm talking to you, Serena Zhou! Are you deaf?"

Serena retorted coldly, "What do you want?"

Shang Ruyan scoffed, "Serena Zhou, don’t act like you’re so important. You’re just a pathetic worm trying to cling to Kangyu but failing miserably. The only reason the Zhou family still carries the Zhou name is because my grandfather still remembers a little old favor from your great-aunt. And Kangyu... do you really think he’ll marry you?"

Shang Ruyan’s eyes glinted with mockery, her tone dripping with sarcasm. 

“I’ll let you in on a little secret. The reason he hasn’t publicly announced his engagement to you is that he wants to give Yingying a chance to vent her frustrations…” 

A grotesque smirk crossed Shang Ruyan’s face. 

“...after all, who told Zhou Jingchen to break off his engagement with Yingying for a man? It’s a pity that even after Zhou Jingchen sacrificed everything, he still couldn’t win that man over—he ended up losing most of his family fortune. Isn’t that just ironic and laughable? And you…”

Serena had no desire to engage in this meaningless war of words with Shang Ruyan, but the latter only grew bolder, relishing her taunts.

She cast a glance at Serena’s left hand, a smirk dancing on her lips. “Must be tough for you these days, huh? I see your left hand’s healing up nicely. Will your right hand be next?”

Shang Ruyan elegantly tucked a strand of chestnut hair behind her ear, flaunting her graceful demeanor as if it were a weapon.

“I truly pity you, Serena Zhou. Kangyu isn’t the type to cherish a delicate flower, and until he’s done playing with you, you won’t be able to escape. What awaits you is merely more torment and humiliation…”

Shang Ruyan laughed brightly, “Honestly, I can’t wait to see what happens to you next. I bet your fate will be far worse than that of your gay brother. You should just give up and take your dying grandfather, your broken mother, and your half-dead brother along to the grave; it might be a lot easier that way…”

*Smack!*

Serena finally lost her patience and raised her hand, delivering a hard slap across Shang Ruyan’s face. The force made Shang Ruyan’s head snap to the side.

Realizing she had been slapped, Shang Ruyan turned back, eyes blazing with fury. “Serena Zhou, how dare you hit me?!”

Before she could finish, Shang Ruyan raised her hand to retaliate. But before her slap could connect, Serena easily seized her wrist.

With a dark expression, Serena warned, “Shang Ruyan, have you already forgotten the pain of your ankle fracture? Do you dare to speak carelessly? If you need reminding, I can certainly make you feel it again!”

With that, Serena lifted her foot, aiming a kick towards Shang Ruyan’s ankle.

Startled, Shang Ruyan quickly yanked her wrist back and stumbled several steps back, glaring at Serena. “You wouldn’t dare!”

But her bravado was weakened, the tremor in her voice betraying her fear.

Serena narrowed her eyes and turned her head slightly to glance behind her. “Go ahead and complain about me!” she taunted.

With that, Serena ignored Shang Ruyan’s furious shouts, stepping around her and striding out of the airport.

As soon as she left, a tall, handsome man with a calm and refined demeanor emerged from behind a pillar in the spot where Serena had just stood.

Upon seeing him, Shang Ruyan immediately covered her reddened cheek, where Serena’s slap had left a clear imprint, and ran to the man, whining, “Kangyu, look at what Serena did! She’s so arrogant, hitting people like that! You have to stand up for me!”

Duan Kangyu wrapped an arm around Shang Ruyan's shoulders, comforting her with a few gentle words, but his gaze remained fixed on Serena's retreating figure.

Shang Ruyan, throwing a small tantrum, was still not satisfied. 

Duan Kangyu gradually lost patience, withdrawing his arm from her shoulders. “Stop crying. She’ll apologize to you. You can hit her back when she does!”

“I knew you’d always be nice to me, Kangyu,” Shang Ruyan said, finally stopping her feigned sobs. She affectionately linked her arm with his as they left the airport together.

After leaving, Serena headed straight back to the company, working diligently until six o’clock. It wasn’t until Leo called to let her know that the soup was ready and asked when she would be home that she remembered she had forgotten to tell him she would be dining with Duan Kangyu’s mother that evening, followed by a drinking session with executives from Qianhai Bank.

So the soup he made might go uneaten. 

Leo sounded a bit disappointed but was more concerned about her well-being. “Sister, please don’t overexert yourself! By the way, where’s the drinking session tonight? I can come pick you up afterward!”
