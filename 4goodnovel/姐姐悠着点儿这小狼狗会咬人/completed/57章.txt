**A Touch of Affection**

Serena Zhou calmly responded with a soft "Hmm," as she powered on her phone. Dai, her close friend, assumed she would call Leo Sterling, but to her surprise, Serena dialed Ethan Duan instead. 

No answer.

A sudden laugh escaped Serena's lips. It was unexpected how guilty Ethan sounded.

Since Ethan wasn’t picking up, Serena quickly turned to call Leo. 

“Hey, sis…” Leo’s bright voice rang out almost immediately.

The moment Serena heard Leo's voice, the chaotic emotions inside her settled down. 

With the new school semester, Leo had less time compared to summer; he rarely brought her lunch anymore. Instead, he would wake up early to prepare delicious meals, neatly packed in lunch boxes for her to take to work. During lunchtime, they would often call or video chat to eat together, which Serena dubbed “cloud dining.”

“I’m sorry, sis. Once I get through this busy spell, I promise I’ll spend more time with you…” Leo said apologetically.

Serena smiled dismissively, “You’re the best, my little Leo!” 

In truth, Serena was much busier than Leo. Even when he came to bring her meals, their time alone together was limited to just one lunch. Still, she longed to see him every day. No matter how overwhelming work became, just the thought of seeing Leo was a beacon of hope for her. The moment she laid eyes on him, all her heavy worries would lift, replaced by the sweetness of a kiss and the warmth of a shared meal, enough to uplift her spirit and fuel her determination to keep pushing forward.

If her afternoon was free of urgent work, she would even sneak him into the break room behind her office for a little well-deserved affection.

After finishing the call, Serena learned from Leo that he had changed clothes to do fieldwork and left his phone behind, which explained his unavailability. It was clearly a poorly executed test. Yet, she chose not to share this with Leo.

When Leo casually asked if Dai had called him about anything important, Serena deflected with a vague excuse. 

Ethan trying to test her through Leo—it struck Serena as utterly ridiculous. But was this Ethan's way of looking down on her or just a bizarre, inexplicable trial? 

Ethan was truly narcissistic. His standards for a partner were more complex than those of ancient emperors selecting concubines. 

Serena was left wondering whether she had passed or failed this strange test. After all, Ethan's methods and intentions were bizarre and twisted. What kind of normal man would make his future fiancée, a pure and innocent girl, engage with a gigolo for practice in bed?

However, as Serena spent more time with Ethan, especially during their one-on-one meals, she felt more comfortable speculating about his feelings. Although she didn’t grasp his ultimate goal, she could guess he wanted her to fall deeply in love. 

Since Ethan wished for her to experience this love, Serena felt it only right to continue cherishing her bond with Leo. She considered that his recent orchestrating of a "kidnapping scheme" might indeed be a way to gauge Leo's significance in her life or to observe how she reacted to such unexpected turmoil.

After all, she was currently following Zhou Jinchen’s plan, at the point of reeling in the business. With Leo’s abduction occurring at such a sensitive time, it was crucial for her to maintain her composure; otherwise, she risked being outmaneuvered by the Yan siblings. 

It was a precarious situation, and though she felt guilty, Serena had to admit that her successful retrieval of the shares from Shang Duo Duo was significantly aided by Yan Jiajia’s deteriorating health. Without that, her threats might have fallen flat.

This was her first experience with taking advantage of a situation, and it left her feeling uneasy. Although she had left a portion of shares for Shang Duo Duo to secure her future, Yan Jiajia was a different story.

Later that afternoon, Dai entered Serena’s office with a stack of signed documents from Yan Jiajia, completing the transfer process. 

“Ms. Zhou, here’s the latest equity distribution document. The shares of the business have all been transferred to you, making you the second-largest shareholder of Shang Zhou…”

Serena felt no particular emotional shift at this news. She skimmed through the documents briefly before pushing them aside and inquired about Yan Jiajia’s condition.

Dai shook her head slightly, her voice low. “She’s in the late stage of lymphatic cancer and doesn’t have much time left.”

“And Yan Jiajun? Has he shown any unusual behavior?”

“He probably knows about the equity changes by now, but there hasn’t been any significant reaction yet. Yan Jiajia said she would convince him, but it’s uncertain…”

Before Dai could finish, Serena’s phone rang. Checking the screen, she saw “Director Yan” flashing back at her. 

So Yan Jiajun had indeed come looking for her. Serena had suspected that Yan Jiajia wouldn’t be able to fabricate a flawless excuse to convince him. There was no escaping this confrontation.

Serena took a deep breath and answered the call. “Hello, Director Yan… Yes, I’ve been wanting to visit Yan Jiajia in the hospital. Sure, I’ll see you soon!”

As soon as she ended the call, Dai frowned with concern. “Ms. Zhou, Yan Jiajun requesting you to visit Yan Jiajia right now may not be for good reasons. Should I accompany you?”

Serena rubbed her temples, popping a mint into her mouth, crunching it before swallowing. Rising from her seat, she replied, “No need. If Yan Jiajun isn’t afraid that Yan Jiajia might have a heart attack when she sees me, what’s there for me to fear?”

Serena bought a bouquet of flowers and a fruit basket before heading to the hospital. 

Outside Yan Jiajia’s ward, she spotted Yan Jiajun waiting at the door. 

He appeared to be waiting specifically for her. 

Serena approached and greeted him sweetly. 

Yan Jiajun returned her greeting with a cold nod. “Your timing is impeccable; Yan Jiajia just went for chemotherapy.”

Serena feigned surprise, “Oh, I’ll just sit here and wait, then.”

“Ms. Zhou, your time is precious; waiting here would be a waste. This hospital is quite large. I assume you’d like to visit someone other than just my sister?”

Serena maintained her composure, observing Yan Jiajun carefully as he offered a cryptic smile.

“I heard that Qin Lili is the little darling you brought into Shang Zhou. She’s been receiving treatment here after some unfortunate incidents in the detention center. Would you like to come see her?”

Serena held his gaze, not responding or moving. 

Just then, Yan Jiajun’s phone rang, and he stepped away to take the call. When he returned moments later, his expression was dark as he shot a glance at Serena before striding out of the hospital.

Once he left, Serena leisurely placed the fruit basket and flowers at Yan Jiajia’s door. 

As she passed through the controlled ward area, she heard Qin Lili’s anguished cries echoing from one of the rooms.
