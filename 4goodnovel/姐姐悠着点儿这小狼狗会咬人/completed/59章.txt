In the dim light of the hospital corridor, a striking scene unfolded as Adam Song and Serena Zhou stood close, their embrace radiating warmth and comfort. However, for the onlooker, the atmosphere was charged with tension. Serena, though appearing slightly disheveled, wore an icy expression. Her gaze, sharp as a blade, fixated on Daniel Duan, and unexpectedly, she asked, “Uncle Daniel, is there still a chance for us?”

Her voice dripped with a chilling undertone, starkly contrasting her usual gentle demeanor. Daniel, taken aback, struggled to process her words, disbelief flooding through him. “Serena, are you doubting me?” he asked incredulously.

Serena pressed her lips together, choosing silence as her response. Just then, a third party approached, interrupting the charged moment. Upon seeing Leo Sterling, Serena's demeanor shifted dramatically. The steely resolve melted away, replaced by a look of frightened vulnerability. She called out, “Leo,” her voice thick with the threat of tears, and rushed into his arms.

Leo enveloped her in a protective embrace, kissing the top of her head gently. “It’s okay, don’t be scared. I’m here; everything will be alright…” he murmured soothingly.

Serena buried her face in his chest, seeking solace. Unbothered by the world around them, they held each other tightly, lost in their own bubble. To an outsider, the sight of this handsome couple lost in an intimate embrace would seem picturesque. Yet for Daniel, it felt like a piercing reminder of his isolation, stirring an urge within him to separate them forcefully. It was a sensation he hadn’t experienced in many years, and it left him perplexed. Why was Serena treating him with such coldness? When had she begun to dismiss him so completely? Did she truly believe that the events of the night were linked to him?

Daniel was unaccustomed to this sudden shift in Serena’s attitude, having always been the recipient of her admiration and affection. He stood stiffly, emotions swirling within him until his assistant approached, informing him that the chief of police had arrived. With a deep breath, he composed himself and walked over, softly saying, “Serena, the chief is here…”

Only then did Serena rise from Leo’s embrace, glancing briefly at him before following Daniel to greet the arriving guests. They barely made it a few steps before encountering Chief Pei and his entourage.

In front of the chief, Daniel instinctively wrapped an arm around Serena’s shoulders. She frowned slightly but did not pull away. Knowing the depth of his friendship with Chief Pei and desperate to alleviate Serena’s suspicions, Daniel earnestly urged the chief to uncover the truth behind the night’s events.

Serena echoed his sentiments, yearning to expose the hidden malefactor, though her hope felt fragile. Chief Pei seemed to be there only due to his connections with Daniel and Serena’s grandfather, promising to provide the Zhou family with answers.

After expressing her gratitude, Serena watched as Chief Pei departed the hospital, accompanied by Daniel. She stood frozen in place for a moment until Leo stepped forward, wrapping his arms around her from behind. This time, he offered no words of comfort, simply holding her tightly.

In the stillness of the late-night hospital, the two clung together, their heartbeats synchronizing, creating an intimate silence that felt almost tangible. Just then, Daniel returned, helping an elderly man into the hospital. Upon hearing footsteps, Serena pulled away from Leo, her face lighting up as she called out, “Grandpa!”

However, the warmth of the moment was abruptly shattered when Zhou Yunfang raised his hand and delivered a stinging slap across Serena’s cheek. The sound echoed through the quiet corridor, leaving her momentarily stunned, her head turned from the force of the blow.

“Didn’t I tell you before I left? You need to handle things more delicately! Do you think the Yan family has built its reputation overnight? Serena, if you can’t even protect your own family, how can you lead this family? If anything happens to your brother or mother, can we still consider this a family?” Zhou Yunfang’s voice was a thunderous reprimand, filled with fury.

Serena stood there, the mark of his hand blooming red on her cheek, expressionless as she met her grandfather's furious gaze. She bit her lip, suppressing any retort.

Both Daniel and Leo watched with concern, the pain for Serena evident in their eyes. Leo instinctively took a step forward, but hesitated, respecting the gravity of the moment with her grandfather.

After Zhou Yunfang’s tirade, Daniel slowly intervened, attempting to diffuse the situation. Just as he began to speak, the emergency room light dimmed, and Feng Lan stepped out, breaking the tension.

Zhou Yunfang hurried towards her, leaning heavily on his cane. “Feng, my grandson and daughter-in-law, how are they?” he asked urgently.

Serena quickly joined them, while Leo trailed closely behind. The imprint of the slap still burned on her cheek, a stark reminder of the night’s turmoil.

Feng Lan reassured them, “Serena, your brother is stable and has not suffered serious harm. Jingyi inhaled some smoke and toxic fumes, but she should wake up by tomorrow. The two aunts, however, are in critical condition and will need to be monitored in the ICU tonight…”

Relief washed over the group at the news of Serena’s brother and sister-in-law. Yet, Serena’s brow remained furrowed, the mention of “toxic fumes” resonating ominously in her mind, echoing memories of a tragedy from years past when her parents met their end in a tent.

A shiver ran through her body as she recalled the haunting images. Leo, sensing her trembling, tightened his grip on her hand, his concern evident. His touch was firm enough to elicit a wince, but Serena remained unresponsive, lost in her thoughts.

After a while, once her brother and sister-in-law were settled back in their rooms, Serena finally gathered herself. Gently, she withdrew her hand from Leo’s grasp, turning to him with a soft request to leave.

Leo wanted to stay, but looking at her grandfather and Daniel engaged in conversation, he reluctantly walked away. It wasn’t embarrassment that drove him but rather a desire not to add to Serena’s burdens.

Once outside the hospital, Leo pulled out his phone, dialing a number. His voice turned cold as he ordered, “Investigate the cause of the fire at the Zhou residence tonight; if you encounter any resistance…”

Leaning back in the car, he wrestled with the decision of whether to keep his relationship with Serena a secret from his family. If there were no engagement between her and Daniel, he wouldn’t hesitate. 

With a sigh, he pinched the bridge of his nose, deciding it was best to handle Daniel first—terminate any engagement between Serena and Daniel, ensuring she would be free to openly be with him. 

Leo remained silent for a moment until the voice on the other end anxiously called out, “Leo?” He snapped back to attention, continuing, “...just keep digging. Find out whatever you can.”
