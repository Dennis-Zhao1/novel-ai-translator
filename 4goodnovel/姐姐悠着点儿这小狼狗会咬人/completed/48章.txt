**You Only Want Me**

Leo Sterling rarely got angry, but when he did, Serena Zhou felt a pang of fear. She tried to sweet talk him, her voice soft and coaxing, “Leo, don’t be upset. I promise…”

But even that tactic failed her this time.

Leo coldly interrupted, “Enough. Stop trying to fool me, Serena. I just want one thing from you. Are you and Duan Kangyu still planning to get engaged or not?”

There was always a shadow of a third person in their relationship.

And that shadow was becoming brighter and clearer by the day.

No matter how much he tried to convince himself otherwise, Leo couldn’t ignore it. Serena could deceive herself, but he couldn’t.

He had a certain cleanliness about his life, a fastidiousness that extended to his emotions as well.

Serena… he had known from the beginning that she was not the right match for him.

Yet he had still been lured onto this ship of deception.

And as for the ship’s direction, he could neither control it nor make sense of it.

Every time Leo brought up the same old issue, Serena’s expression would collapse. She looked at him with pleading eyes, trying to get through this without further conflict.

“Leo, can’t we just enjoy the moment and not talk about these heavy topics?”

Leo hated when Serena treated him like a child. He was a man, not her plaything. Her attitude only fueled his anger.

Feeling a bit despondent, Leo said, “Serena, do you just want to drift through life with me? Am I merely a toy for you? You don’t want to share your life with me, do you? Besides your body, you refuse to let me into any other part of your world. Am I your boyfriend, or just an outlet for your desires?”

His words hit hard, and Serena froze, no longer daring to play coy or act cute.

She straightened up, her gaze serious and earnest as she replied, “Yes. No. I want to share my life with you, but I only want to share the beautiful and warm parts. You are my boyfriend!”

Leo hadn’t expected such a serious response from Serena, which left him momentarily stunned.

“Since you consider me your boyfriend, can you please stop seeing Duan Kangyu?”

Silence.

Serena sighed, knowing what was coming next. “Meeting Duan Kangyu is part of my job. I won’t let my personal life interfere with my work…”

Leo narrowed his eyes, his tone heating up. “So dating Duan Kangyu is just work? What about the engagement? The marriage? When he gives you flowers or gets physical with you… is that also just work?”

Serena sighed again, her tone laced with resignation. “Leo, Duan Kangyu…”

“I know, you’re going to say he’s someone for the future, right? So you still plan to get engaged, to marry him? In the end, we’ll still break up, just like last time?”

It felt like they were back at square one.

Serena fell silent again, her silence long and profound…

Finally, under Leo's intense gaze, she relented. “Alright, Leo, I’ll spend this year’s Qixi Festival with you and won’t meet Duan Kangyu. Don’t be angry.”

Cautiously, she reached out to take Leo’s hand.

But he stepped back, the frost on his face not melting away with her compromise. Instead, it thickened.

“Serena, when will you realize that I’m your man, not some kept boy? Do you think this conversation is just about stopping you from seeing Duan Kangyu on Qixi Festival?”

Serena’s voice dropped to a whisper, “Isn’t it?”

Leo clenched his fists, his jaw tight, and replied coldly, “Of course not. Stop pretending you don’t know what I want.”

Serena responded with a soft “Oh,” as if it were self-evident. “What you want is me, right? But I already belong to you!”

“You only belong to me partially; another part… does not!”

Leo struggled against the acknowledgment that Serena had any part belonging to Duan Kangyu.

Serena began to lose her patience, her gaze drifting to random objects around her, her voice becoming shallow. “Leo, can’t we just wrap ourselves in the warmth of sweet memories and live like that? I don’t want to talk about the exhausting, frustrating parts of my job, nor do I want my emotions trapped in a web of scheming…”

With Leo, Serena didn’t want to think for even a second. She just wanted to carefree enjoy their time together.

“… Trust me, the troubles in my life are dirtier than you can imagine; you wouldn’t want to know everything!”

Leo was well aware that Serena’s world was filled with deceit and manipulation. 

But he wasn’t that fragile.

Her cautious protection only ignited his frustration.

With a determined gaze, he said, “Do you think you can just conclude my feelings based on your assumptions? But Serena, if you refuse to let me into your life, can we even have a future?”

Future?

What an abstract term.

Serena looked at the handsome young man in front of her. No matter how she looked at him, he was still irresistible, and she couldn’t shake the desire to pull him into her bed.

“Leo, what do you want me to say? Should I tell you that I’ll cut ties with Duan Kangyu and live happily ever after with you? But that’s not reality, and I can’t discuss that kind of future with you!”

Leo felt a lump of frustration settle in his chest.

“You can’t talk to me about the future or about other aspects of your life. Do you just want to sleep with me?”

Serena didn’t want to admit it.

But the truth was exactly that.

There were too many people in her life that she could discuss the future and other matters with, but none of them were someone she wanted to date.

She sought Leo for love.

Romantic love, physical love, warm love, tender love.

But anything beyond love? Serena didn’t want to engage in that right now.

Leo’s irritation flared, “You… forget it. I can’t reason with you. So, you just want to sleep with me, right? Fine, then let’s just do that…”

With that, Leo clenched his teeth, resolute and dismissive of any objections, and directly pulled Serena into the bedroom.
