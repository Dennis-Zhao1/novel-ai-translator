You’re finally mine.

Leo Sterling stood in front of the car, relentlessly calling Serena Zhou. 

The phone rang over and over again.

Finally, Serena answered, but she didn’t say a word. 

On the other end, Leo's heavy breathing filled the silence. Serena expected him to explode with anger, but after a long, tense pause, he calmly spoke, “Serena, you’ve won!”

A surge of joy rushed through Serena, but she maintained her composure and asked, “What do you mean by that?”

“If you want to know what I mean, open the car door and let’s talk face to face.”

“We’re already face to face.”

Serena wasn’t going to let such a good opportunity slip away. 

She slowly replied, “Leo, if you want me to open the door, you need to clarify things first. Otherwise, let’s see if you can keep me locked out all night.”

Leo fell silent once more. 

Clearly, he was struggling to suppress his anger. 

Through the car window, their gazes locked, emotions swirling in the air like a tug-of-war. 

Leo felt a moment of bewilderment; was he really being cornered just to coax him into bed?

He tried to steady his emotions. 

“Serena, listen carefully, I’ll only say this once: I won’t be your lover, but I’m willing to enter into a three-month relationship…”

Serena’s face lit up with a bright smile, but she didn’t forget to remind him, “That’s fine, but our relationship can’t be public!”

Leo gritted his teeth and repeated, “Alright, not public,” before hanging up the phone.

Only then did Serena unlock the car, rolling down the window and poking her head out with her eyes sparkling, a sweet smile adorning her face. 

“Boyfriend, get in the car, take me home. My feet hurt, and I’m starving…”

Leo stared at Serena’s radiant smile, questioning if she had mastered the art of changing her demeanor at will. 

This woman…

Leo tucked his phone away, his anger boiling as he walked over to open the car door.

Serena sensed his fierce momentum but was caught off guard. 

He leaned into the car, cupping her face with both hands, and pressed his lips against hers in a fierce kiss. 

It was far from gentlemanly or gentle; it felt rather domineering, like a punishment. 

Serena was taken aback by the kiss but didn’t resist. 

“Serena…”

Just as she thought she’d struggle for air, Leo finally withdrew his lips from hers. 

But his hands remained on her face. 

Their foreheads touched, and their gazes locked. 

The distance between them was so close that they could hear each other’s breaths. 

Leo’s expression was cold, his voice laced with a harsh warning, “If you ever threaten your safety again, I swear I’ll make you regret it!” 

The icy menace in Leo’s eyes sent a shiver down Serena’s spine. 

“I won’t dare again…” 

Serena wrapped her arms around Leo’s waist, tilting her head back, her expression serious, but her eyes sparkled with mischief. 

As Serena softened her stance and pouted, Leo’s anger dissipated by half. 

Yet, he hadn’t forgotten to set the rules first. 

“You better remember what I said. Also, during these three months we’re together, you must be absolutely loyal to me. I don’t care if you’re engaged or married to Daniel after three months; while we’re in this relationship, you’re mine in every sense. If you can’t do that…”

Leo’s voice dropped dangerously, “I’ll make you regret ever provoking me today!” 

Serena’s smile faded, her expression turning serious as she responded, “Of course, I can do that. Besides you, I don’t want anyone else. But what about you? Can you promise to belong to me entirely?” 

Leo didn’t answer. His gaze fell on Serena’s rosy lips, and he leaned down to kiss her again. 

This kiss was far more tender, filled with yearning. 

Neither of them had much experience; they acted solely on their instinctive desire for one another. 

But they poured all their focus and passion into that kiss. 

They only reluctantly pulled apart when their breaths became ragged and labored.

With the delightful beginning of that gentle kiss, the anger in Leo’s eyes and the mischief in Serena’s faded into nothingness. 

As they gazed into each other’s eyes, only a deep desire remained. 

Leo looked at Serena’s swollen lips, struggling to suppress his overwhelming longing, he murmured, “I’ll take you home.” 

Serena’s cheeks flushed, her demeanor shy yet obedient as she nodded, wrapping her arms around Leo’s neck. 

Leo first helped Serena into the passenger seat and buckled her seatbelt before returning to the driver’s seat. 

“Where to?” 

Serena’s gaze fixated on Leo’s face, her eyes unmasked and bold, like a little rascal. 

Leo felt his ears heat up from her unabashed stare, and he couldn’t help but blush. 

“Hey, snap out of it.” 

With a sigh, Leo waved his hand in front of Serena’s eyes. 

Serena beamed, her smile vibrant and charming. 

She instinctively reached out to pinch Leo’s soft, rosy cheek, grinning, “Leo, I really cherish you. You’re finally mine!” 

Leo’s difficulty in handling her exceeded Serena’s expectations. 

But recalling that wonderful kiss made it all worthwhile! 

Leo took a deep breath, trying to ignore her teasing as he drove down the road. 

After passing two traffic lights, Serena finally tore her adoring gaze away from Leo’s face. 

Looking at the fleeting scenery outside, she said, “Take me to the riverside apartment!” 

Although her injuries weren’t severe, ever since she returned to Shanhai to take over the business, she hadn’t fully healed. 

Old wounds never had a chance to mend before new ones appeared, and every time she returned home, she had to pretend everything was fine. 

In the past, no matter how much it hurt, Serena would prefer to stay at home during her downtime. 

But today, she wanted nothing more than to be with the charming guy she had just caught. 

She had only stayed at the riverside apartment once before and hadn’t even known the door code since she was a guest then. 

Thinking it was her brother’s birthday, she realized she was mistaken. 

Frustrated, she pulled out her phone to call her friend, Dai. 

Dai was momentarily taken aback by her question but quickly responded with a string of numbers, reminding her to change the password. 

Serena acknowledged her but found it too much trouble to bother with. 

Leo carried Serena into the apartment and gently set her down on the couch. 

He glanced around the spacious living room, which was decorated in a minimalist style, the black, white, and gray tones exuding a sense of elegance. 

However, it felt more like a style favored by men rather than women. 

After a quick survey, Leo's gaze returned to Serena's face. 

Serena was watching him, her eyes filled with bold admiration, unabashedly intense, like a lovesick girl. 

Feeling flustered under her gaze, Leo wiped the sweat from his forehead and sat down on the couch, softly asking, “Does your foot hurt?” 

Serena lifted her injured left foot onto the couch, shook her head, then picked up her phone, her voice soft, “I’m so hungry; let’s order takeout!”
