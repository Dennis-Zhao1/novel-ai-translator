**Everything is a Lie**

Leo Sterling’s clean and soothing voice echoed in her ears. “Did you forget to bring any candy? I have some…”

Serena Zhou was momentarily stunned.

Just that single sentence nearly brought tears to her eyes.

Noticing that Serena was looking down, refusing to take the candy he was offering, Leo spoke softly, “Have you really grown to despise me to this extent, that you won’t even accept a piece of candy? I just got used to carrying around your favorite mint candy…”

He exhaled, trying to sound casual. “Don’t worry, it’s not poisoned…”

Serena, hearing those words, was about to explain that was not what she meant…

But she saw Leo pop the shiny mint candy into his mouth.

“Leo, I—”

“What's this? Want some? Alright, I’ll feed you…”

Before she could react, Leo suddenly lifted her chin with one hand and grasped her wrist with the other, kissing her unexpectedly.

Serena was momentarily lost in thought.

Her mouth was filled with the cool flavor of mint candy.

In the year and more they had been together, Leo’s kissing skills had improved dramatically.

Serena felt dizzy from the kiss.

He effortlessly breached her defenses, pushing the mint candy from his mouth into hers.

But he didn’t retreat; instead, he kissed her with even more fervor and focus.

Serena stood there, utterly stunned, completely forgetting to respond.

By the time she regained her senses, he had already released her.

“Serena, your pulse is racing…”

Her mouth still tasted of the refreshing mint.

This flavor slowly seeped into her mind.

Serena’s dazed thoughts finally caught up.

She looked up at him.

His eyes were dark and cold, and the words that came next were laced with frost.

“… You clearly still love me, don’t you?”

Serena pressed her lips together; she desperately wanted to deny it, but she couldn't control her racing heart.

“… Then why did you lie to me? Why did you use Yang Yang to provoke me, trying to break up with me?”

It was surprising to hear that Yang Yang had gone abroad to study so soon. This timing made Leo feel perplexed.

Serena had said she wanted him to intern at Shang Zhou because she wanted to see him every day…

“Are you worried I’d retaliate against him?”

Leo’s tone turned sharp, probing, which made Serena feel inexplicably uneasy as she furrowed her brow.

“If you just wanted to get rid of me, you didn’t have to make it so complicated…”

Leo took a step back, his gaze at Serena filled with cold pain.

“… You only need to tell me that from the very beginning, you approached me just to one day use my love for you as a bargaining chip, and I will let you go!”

Serena’s eyes widened in disbelief as she stared at him.

How could he know?

“Your expression looks quite surprised. Do you really think I’m as foolish as a pig, someone you can easily manipulate, saying you love me when you want and tossing me aside when you’re done?”

A cold smirk appeared at the corners of Leo’s lips.

“My uncle’s car accident was so suspicious, and my aunt was inexplicably sent abroad by General Sheng… And Duan Kangyu, he also committed suicide so… abruptly, but I wasn’t around for any of it. It’s as if everything waited for my absence to unfold one after another…”

“Serena, I truly don’t understand. What do you think of me?”

The cold wind howled around them.

Serena felt a chill seep into her soul.

What did she think of Leo…?

At first, she saw him as a delicious piece of fresh meat, someone she simply had to take a bite out of.

Later, she saw him as a lover, someone she wanted to share a sweet, romantic relationship with.

But now…

What could she still think of him?

What could he still allow her to think of him?

“Little Leo…”

Serena called out to him softly and helplessly.

She had called him that countless times before.

Every time she did, he would soften, tenderly pulling her into his embrace.

But now, that tactic had finally failed…

Leo completely ignored her weak plea.

His eyes were filled with a mockery that was steeped in sadness.

In a cold tone like iron, he said, “Serena, I have just one question for you: Did you ever carry a child for me? Is that true or false?”

“Don’t lie to me. If you’re lying, you know I have many ways to pry the truth from your acquaintances…”

Serena stared directly at Leo, her eyes filled with despair.

A child…

How could she ever allow herself to be pregnant knowing there was no future for them?

She closed her eyes, her face etched with regret, and whispered, “I’m sorry…”

Leo clenched his fists, his teeth grinding, murmuring, “I knew it. You’re so resistant to allowing me into your life; how could you ever consider having my child…”

He let out a bitter laugh, his voice breaking. “So good!”

So good… the only thread that connected them was gone.

Everything was a lie, everything was just manipulation!

He no longer had anything to hold onto…

Serena… so good, he no longer had to worry about whether she truly cared for him!

Because everything was fake; it had never been real!

This woman before him… the face he loved so deeply, turned out to be so loathsome?!

He had genuinely hoped for a pure love that would blossom into something beautiful, but it was merely a carefully orchestrated deception, a vicious game of power.

He had once been angry at her for merely desiring his body…

But in the end, he discovered she didn’t desire him for who he was, but rather for his surname.

If his name wasn’t Sterling, if he wasn’t Sheng Yuan’s son…

Maybe she wouldn’t have even glanced his way, let alone once so passionately bring her affection before him…

What would remain from this relationship in the end?

If Serena truly was just bored and had moved on to someone else…

He could accept that in time, he would convince himself to let go.

But nothing was as simple as that…

Why?

Why did she have to treat him this way?

Being Sheng Yuan’s son was something he had never asked for, something he couldn’t choose!

Why did he have to suffer all of this just because he was the healthy and untroubled son of Sheng Yuan?

Despair and rage filled Leo's eyes as he gazed at Serena, shaking his head step by step as he stepped back.

“Serena, don’t think you can just walk away so easily. I’ll tell you this, I, Leo Sterling, am not a toy you can play with. I once said, if you can’t be sincere and loyal to me, I will make you regret provoking me…”

Leo’s eyes sparkled with cold resentment.

In the biting wind, Serena couldn’t help but shiver. She looked straight at Leo, trembling as she asked, “What do you want… what do you want from me?”
