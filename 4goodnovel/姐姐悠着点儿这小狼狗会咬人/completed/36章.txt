**Date Night**

Leo Sterling was a bit surprised. "Aren't you supposed to be meeting with the investors from Tianxing this afternoon?"

Serena Zhou gently nodded. "We toured around this morning and saw everything we needed to see. Honestly, this whole inspection is just a front; the real focus of securing investments isn't in this phase... But enough about that. Do you want to go out and have some fun this afternoon, or should we just relax here at the hotel?"

Leo raised an eyebrow. "With the way you're acting... Are you sure you can get up this afternoon?"

"I can!" Serena exclaimed, sitting up with determination.

But Leo quickly pressed her shoulders back down onto the bed. "Hold on, don’t move just yet. Let me make you a cup of tea. Drink it, rest a bit, and if you feel up to it afterward, we can head out. If not..."

Leo said softly, "...then I’ll just keep you company and lie here with you."

After saying this, he playfully pinched Serena’s nose before getting up to prepare a hangover tea for her.

With Leo around, Serena felt a sense of peace wash over her. After sipping the tea and resting for a while, she finally felt energized and bounced up from the bed.

"Leo, let's go! It's time for our date!" 

Since they officially became a couple, they hadn't really had a chance to go out on a proper date. For one, Serena was simply too busy. And then there was that much-anticipated trip to Fanyin Mountain that turned out to be filled with obstacles. Those experiences made them both a bit apprehensive about going out together again. What if they ran into someone Serena knew? What if Leo was mistaken for just another pretty boy she was supporting? Just the thought made them both cringe.

But now they were away from the shallow waters of their previous anxieties, and today, for the first time, Serena publicly acknowledged Leo as her boyfriend to others. She introduced him formally, which made Leo eager to hold Serena's hand openly and stroll around.

After getting ready with excitement, the two of them left the hotel hand in hand, feeling happy and lighthearted.

Their date was smooth and sweet. They didn’t run into any acquaintances, nor did they encounter any awkward situations. They wandered around the city, enjoyed delicious food, embraced, kissed, took pictures, and basked in their affectionate openness.

Eventually, they grew tired. Instead of hailing a cab back to the hotel, they decided to find a nearby guesthouse to rest. This guesthouse had a large garden filled with vibrant flowers and even a patch for growing vegetables. To Serena's delight, they could pick the vegetables fresh and toss them into their hot pot.

"That's pretty neat," she remarked.

Leo grinned and added, "You know, I also grow some crops in the experimental fields at school. If you have a day free, I can take you to check it out. But those are just assignments, so they’re not for eating."

Serena was surprised. "Really? You can farm?"

"That’s what I’m studying—how to farm."

"Oh, right! So not only are you my adorable little wolf cub, but you’re also a capable and handsome farmer!"

Leo nearly choked on his tea at her words. Serena always had a way of getting to him…

Looking around to ensure no one was within earshot, Leo leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Do you want to try it, Serena?"

Serena didn’t catch on to Leo's playful tone at first. She noticed something in his expression, which sparked her curiosity. "What do you mean?"

Leo's eyes sparkled with a mischievous light. "Actually, I have a larger experimental field on Qishan Mountain. Besides growing various crops, it’s filled with fruits and some rare flowers..."

As he spoke about his little paradise, his eyes shone with excitement. "If you ever have time, I’d really love to take you there!"

Serena was intrigued. "Really? You have your own experimental field? What do you grow there?"

Leo listed a few common crops and vegetables, especially highlighting a large patch of peas. "The last time I checked, the peas were almost ready to bloom, and they probably have by now. This year, the pea plants are thriving, and when those purple flowers bloom, they’re absolutely stunning..."

Serena had only ever seen pea flowers in books or on TV; she had never witnessed their beauty in person. Excitedly, she responded, "That sounds amazing! Let’s go there for our next date!"

Leo's smile widened. "Sure!"

Suddenly, an adventurous thought struck Serena, and she winked at Leo. "Hey, Leo, what do you think it would feel like to do something... exciting in the pea field?"

Just picturing that scenario made Serena feel all hot and flustered. She gulped, realizing that the spicy hot pot they had just eaten might have contributed to her sudden heat.

Leo, far from oblivious, felt his cheeks flush. He knew Serena's mind would wander...

"Well, if you’re interested, I’d be more than happy to make that happen. Next time…"

Leo realized this was a rather inappropriate topic to discuss in a public setting, but a thrill of excitement surged through him.

"...you can look forward to it. Your farmer boyfriend grows not only peas but many other crops as well..."

The thought of such a vast field made Leo's mouth go dry. But this conversation was skirting the edge of what was appropriate.

As the words left his lips, his face turned crimson. Yet, he couldn't help but notice the glimmer in Serena's eyes, filled with anticipation.

"Leo, you're being a bit too bold! You’re making me want to fly straight to that pea field right now!" 

Serena was all about action, and without missing a beat, she set her chopsticks down. She stood up, grabbed Leo's hand, and started dragging him upstairs. 

"Are you full? If you are, let’s head back to our room..."

Leo looked down, a joyful smile spreading across his face as he obediently followed Serena back to their room.

In that moment, they were lost in the sweet, intoxicating embrace of young love, while still managing to charm Serena's mother-in-law and occasionally entertaining the whims of Duan Kangyu's unexpected invitations. 

Before summer break arrived, Serena finally found the time to join Leo for a visit to Qishan Mountain. 

She had initially thought Leo's experimental field was just a small patch of land. But upon arriving at Qishan, she discovered it was a breathtaking expanse of terraced fields.
