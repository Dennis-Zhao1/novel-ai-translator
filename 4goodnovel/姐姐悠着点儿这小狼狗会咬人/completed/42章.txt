**Before She Gets Tired of You**

Serena Zhou's suggestion to take things slow had been dragging on for nearly three weeks now, and Li Li Qin still hadn’t managed to shake off the sadness. 

As days turned into weeks, Li Li Qin found herself growing increasingly anxious. It was true that Serena was swamped with work every day, but that didn’t stop Li Li Qin from waiting at the office several times, hoping to catch Serena after her shift. She had envisioned cozy dinners and sweet dates, yet each time, Serena was tied up with social obligations that didn’t allow for an intern or a female companion to tag along. 

After being turned down a few times, Li Li Qin felt her frustration rise. What irritated her even more was that, aside from Serena's warm demeanor towards her, there were no other signs of affection. The promise from her mentor, Sister Dai, to arrange an apartment for her had also gone silent. 

Li Li Qin began to suspect that Serena was just toying with her. Yet, she couldn’t ignore the fact that Serena had genuinely helped her land an internship at Shangzhou. Caught in this spiraling confusion and frustration, she felt powerless, as she was still in that ambiguous phase of their relationship. She didn’t have the right to sulk or throw tantrums. 

Finally, unable to bear it any longer, Li Li Qin seized the opportunity during lunch break and slipped into Serena’s office. Although she had only been there once before with Sister Dai, she had a rough idea of where to find her. 

Serena had a habit of taking naps, and there was a small resting room with a single bed at the back of her office. When Li Li Qin entered, she found someone sleeping on the bed. The dim light, with the curtains drawn, made it hard for her to see the person’s face, but she instinctively knew it was Serena. 

Without a second thought, she stripped off her clothes and slid under the covers. Her delicate fingers traced the curves of Serena's body, finally resting on her collarbone. 

Emerging from the covers, Li Li Qin pressed her soft, ruby-red lips gently against the woman’s chin, then moved to her lips, kissing her tenderly. Serena, still lost in dreams, gradually woke up and instinctively responded to the kiss. But as they continued, something felt entirely different this time...

Suddenly, Serena’s eyes flew open, and she was met with the shocking sight of a naked woman kissing her. In a panic, she pushed Li Li Qin away, causing her to tumble off the bed. 

Li Li Qin yelped in surprise, landing on the thick carpet, which thankfully cushioned her fall. As she scrambled to rise, a sharp voice filled the room, demanding, “Who are you? What were you just doing? How did you get in here?” 

That voice… wasn’t Serena’s! 

Li Li Qin looked up to see a stranger sitting on the bed, her expression a mix of incredulity and anger. Li Li Qin had never expected to find someone else in Serena’s resting room. No wonder Serena hadn’t rushed to lead her to the bed; it turned out someone else had been sharing her affections. 

Ignoring the stranger's icy glare, Li Li Qin stood up with confidence, crossing her arms defiantly. “And who are you? How did you get in here?” 

She raised her chin, exuding a sense of superiority. The woman in front of her, while attractive, had a more mature and aged aura, and Li Li Qin felt more than confident in her own youthful beauty and fiery figure. 

The stranger’s jaw clenched, her face pale, eyes narrowing as she glared at Li Li Qin, her whole body trembling as if her rage had left her speechless. 

Li Li Qin rolled her eyes in boredom, sneering, “You’re overreacting, sister. No need to get so worked up; you might hurt yourself. Don’t worry, I won’t come back before she gets tired of you. Although I don’t mind a little three-way action, your expression says you wouldn’t be interested. But honestly, you’re not bad at all…” 

She touched her lips, savoring the taste from earlier. Not bad, she thought. What could Serena possibly see in this woman? 

As the woman reached for her phone on the bedside table, Li Li Qin guessed she was about to call Serena to complain or confront her. Li Li Qin let out a mocking “hmph,” bending down to retrieve her work attire scattered on the floor. After putting it back on, she adjusted her work ID in the mirror before turning to leave. 

Serena… ugh, how disgusting! 

On the surface, she seemed elegant and poised, but internally, she was so foul. Li Li Qin felt unlucky to be noticed by someone like Serena. If it wasn’t for her ulterior motives, she wouldn’t have subjected herself to serving Serena at all. 

What a bad vibe! How infuriating! 

Clenching her fists in frustration, Li Li Qin stormed out of Serena’s office. 

Meanwhile, Serena Zhou stood leaned against the corner, watching Li Li Qin’s retreating figure. She pulled a mint from her pocket and popped it into her mouth, arching an eyebrow in appreciation of Li Li Qin’s calmness amidst the chaos. 

But then, a frown crossed her face as she thought of something else. 

A week later, Serena was sitting in her office, feeling restless as she focused on an audio recording sent by Leo Sterling. Just then, her phone rang— it was Yanjia Jia, asking her out to dinner. 

After a moment of contemplation, Serena hesitated and came up with a lame excuse to decline. 

Two days later, Yanjia Jia called again, and once more, Serena found herself crafting an excuse to turn her down. After two consecutive rejections, Yanjia Jia lost her patience and showed up at Serena’s office. 

Feigning friendliness, Serena made small talk, but Yanjia Jia saw right through her and boldly stated, “Serena, I’m not here to cause trouble; I’m here to discuss a partnership. You don't have to avoid me like a plague…” 

Serena smiled awkwardly, trying to maintain her composure. “What kind of collaboration does my sister-in-law want to discuss?” 

Yanjia Jia’s eyes darkened as she spoke with unwavering intensity, “I want to become the second-largest shareholder of Shangzhou…” 

Serena froze, her forced smile fading away. 

Yanjia Jia continued softly, “But I won’t interfere with the operations of Shangzhou. All decisions will be yours to make.” 

For several seconds, Serena stared at Yanjia Jia, her mind racing, struggling to process the offer. 

“Sister-in-law… is this for real?” 

Yanjia Jia closed her eyes, nodded gently, “This is easy to verify. If you don’t believe me, you can ask any doctor…”
