### She Can Have a Thousand Faces

Serena Zhou paused mid-step, momentarily caught off guard. A smile crept onto her lips as she lifted her chin and approached Leo Sterling's office, each step deliberate and confident. The door stood wide open.

Without knocking, she walked right in.

Inside, two women were engrossed in a lively display of affection, completely unaware of her presence. Serena lingered at the entrance for a moment, observing the scene. Her gaze zeroed in on the two entangled beauties at the round table, and through their intertwined forms, she caught sight of Leo, impeccably dressed in a suit, seated behind his desk with an air of authority.

At that moment, he seemed utterly captivated by the spectacle before him, oblivious to Serena's arrival.

With purposeful strides, she walked further into the room. As she passed the round table, the two women finally noticed her. However, rather than displaying shock, their eyes sparkled with boldness and a hint of seduction, as if inviting her to join their revelry.

Serena, however, ignored them completely. She stood in front of Leo's desk, a smirk playing on her lips, her gaze piercing through the air. In a voice cold and steady, she spoke, “Uncle Leo, thank you for helping me find the murderer of my parents. As a token of my gratitude, I’ve decided to gift you something…”

From her pocket, she pulled out a small, square wooden box and tossed it onto the desk.

Leo, still engrossed in the entertainment before him, didn’t seem to notice the interruption. The box landed with a loud thud, breaking the atmosphere and drawing his attention.

He frowned slightly, glancing up at Serena with mild irritation, and then a practiced smile broke across his face, elegant yet condescending. “It was just a small favor, Serena. No need to be so formal!”

Serena's eyes turned icy as she retorted, “You’ve been so kind to me, Uncle Leo. How could I not show my gratitude?”

Her gaze lingered on the box, and with a hint of challenge, she urged, “I guarantee you’ll love this gift. Why not open it and see?”

Leo cast a dismissive glance at the box but made no move to open it. Serena, sensing his reluctance, taunted, “What’s the matter? Are you afraid that what’s inside might be a part of Tang Ying's body?”

A wicked glint flickered in her eyes. “Don’t worry; I’m not that deranged... for now.”

She paused, softening her tone, “But next time, who knows?”

The threat in her voice hung heavily in the air. Leo, not one to back down easily, shot up from his chair, his gaze fierce as he locked eyes with Serena. “Serena Zhou, who do you think you are? Do you really believe that just because you’ve climbed onto the Sterling family’s ladder, I won’t do anything to you? You’re just a little girl who hasn’t even matured yet, and you dare to threaten me? I warn you, if you even think of harming Ying Ying, I will make sure Meng Jingyi won’t see another New Year…”

His fury startled the two women at the round table, who recoiled slightly at his intensity. However, Serena remained unfazed, her demeanor calm and collected. “If that’s the case, I’ll make sure to prepare another gift for you, Uncle Leo…”

She opened the small box on the desk and flipped its contents onto the surface with a sharp “thud.” A pristine wooden desk resonated with a crisp “ding” as the object collided with it.

“Nevertheless, let me remind you, if anything happens to Ms. Meng in prison, I won’t let her journey to the afterlife be a lonely one!”

With that, she lifted the box and hurled it onto the marble floor with a resounding crash.

Lying atop the wooden desk was a bloodstone bracelet, shattered into several pieces. 

Leo’s eyes widened in horror as he recognized the bracelet—the very one that had adorned his mother’s wrist.

Serena paid no heed to his fury. With a cold chuckle, she turned on her heel, ready to leave. However, as she passed the round table, she noticed the two women, now at a loss, still embracing one another and staring at her and Leo.

She flashed a shallow smile at Leo. “Oh, Uncle Leo, there’s something I forgot to mention—I’m not a lesbian. Also, I’m pregnant… so I will definitely marry into the Sterling family!”

As she spoke, she savored the tumult of emotions playing across Leo’s face, unable to suppress her joy. With her head held high, she straightened her back and strode out of Leo's office.

Once outside the East Tower Group, Serena dialed her grandfather’s number. 

Grandpa Zhou was already aware of Ms. Meng’s arrest. 

“Should I come back to think of a solution?”

“You don’t need to come back!” 

There was a brief pause before Grandpa Zhou replied, “I haven’t had the chance to meet with him…”

“You don’t need to meet him anymore!” Serena interrupted. “Grandpa, it’s too late for you to think about damage control. Since you can’t do anything about it, don’t stand in the way of him clearing his house…”

She could hear the heavy breaths on the other end, and after a long silence, he finally spoke, “I will go have a good talk with him…”

Serena sighed, her voice filled with earnestness. “Grandpa, during this time, you can’t afford to get into any trouble. Don’t distract me. Stay safe in Hengxue and don’t act recklessly!”

Grandpa Zhou didn’t respond, but she could hear his breathing becoming more labored before he hung up.

“Ms. Zhou, are you heading home or…?” 

Serena rubbed her temples, then took a mint from her pocket and popped it into her mouth, replying softly, “To the hospital!”

There was no one waiting for her at home. Who would she reunite with there?

This year, Serena decided to spend it at the hospital with her brother, Zhou Jingchen.

Leo likely understood she was busy, as he hadn’t dared to call her but sent a few messages instead. 

It wasn’t until night that Serena found the time to reply. 

As soon as she sent her response, Leo called her. 

“Serena, how’s everything?” 

The hospital was quiet and empty at night. His youthful voice carried an urgency mixed with concern, like a pure stream of water that washed away the fatigue and darkness in her heart.

Serena briefly recounted her current situation before shifting the topic. How was Grandma’s health? Was she upset with her? What plans did they have for the New Year?

It was a conversation filled with simple, everyday topics, but it brought Serena a sense of peace and comfort. 

It felt as if she could have a thousand faces, but only this one was the truest version of herself.

Leo’s warm voice resonated beautifully in the tranquil winter night. 

“I showed Grandma your photo, and she said you’re very beautiful. From her perspective, you’re a kind-hearted girl with good fortune. She also mentioned that you and I make a perfect pair; we looked warm and happy together in the photo, like we were meant to be…”

Serena smiled softly, “Grandma has great taste! I wish I could meet her; I’m sure she’d give me a big red envelope…”
