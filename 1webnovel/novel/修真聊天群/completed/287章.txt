**No Worst, Only Worse**

"How is it possible? You learned my physical training technique just by taking a glance!" Joseph's eyes widened in disbelief. This was just an annoying gorilla, so why did it possess such a strong learning ability?

At this moment, the robust gorilla across from him shook its head, and then... it shockingly gave Joseph the middle finger! It was clear that this wasn't the first time these creatures had encountered humans, and they had learned quite a bit from them.

"Arrogant! That was merely the simplest warm-up!" Joseph gritted his teeth, took a deep breath, and began executing the second form of "The Era Calls," the Stretching Vitality Fist.

Okay, Joseph came up with that name himself. In reality, it was just a series of stretching exercises!

Joseph began standing upright, then shot his fists upward with palms facing forward!

After that, he squatted halfway, punching downwards with palms facing rearward. Once completed, he stood up and punched upwards again, then downwards. After finishing the punching sequence, he stepped forward into a lunge position, raising both arms to the side and upward, transitioning from fists to open palms, and slightly lifted his head.

Once done, he returned to a standing position and took a deep breath, exhaling a long breath!

The sturdy gorilla stared at Joseph intently, scratching its head.

A smirk crept onto Joseph's lips—this second form was significantly more complex than the first; surely the gorilla couldn't master it, right?

But just then, the robust gorilla executed a backflip, returning to a standing position, and then—both fists shot upwards, palms facing forward!

Next, it squatted halfway, punching downwards with both hands... In the end, the robust gorilla returned to a standing position, took a deep breath, and exhaled a long breath! Even the exhalation of breath was perfectly mimicked.

As before, it flawlessly replicated all of Joseph's movements!

After completing the routine, the robust gorilla looked unsatisfied.

Suddenly, it waved its hand vigorously.

Behind it, over fifty gorillas seemed to receive a signal. They began rhythmically stomping their hands and feet on the ground, chanting in unison, "Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar! Roar!"

Amidst this roar, the robust gorilla began performing the second set of stretching exercises again.

And it was getting faster and faster!

The roars from the fifty or so gorillas also grew increasingly rapid.

In the end, the robust gorilla completed the second set of stretching exercises at a speed three times faster than Joseph!

The sight of the robust gorilla moving at triple speed looked like a video on fast forward...

Once it finished, the robust gorilla raised both hands high.

Behind it, the fifty or so gorillas cheered in unison...

The robust gorilla spun around like a king, basking in the cheers of its fellow gorillas, truly a magnificent sight.

Finally, it turned back, lips moving slightly, nostrils flaring, adopting a gorilla version of a "contemptuous" expression, vividly displayed for all to see.

...

...

Meanwhile, the people surrounding them were completely dumbfounded.

They had no idea what kind of expression to wear to convey their chaotic emotions—seventy percent fear, ten percent frustration, ten percent surprise, and the final ten percent pure confusion.

"Um, sis, is this... a dance battle?" Lu Fei cautiously asked.

Lu Jie remained silent for a moment, pondering, "I suppose it’s more like a gymnastics showdown? By the way, what kind of gymnastics is this?"

"It’s 'The Era Calls.' I specifically searched for it online," Lu Fei replied.

She had seen the video Zhuge Yue posted on the campus network and subsequently looked up which set of exercises Joseph was doing. After comparing, she confirmed it was "The Era Calls."

Oh right, thinking of Zhuge Yue, Lu Fei began searching through the crowd carefully—sure enough, neither Zhuge Yue nor Zhuge Zhongyang were among them!

Also missing were Scholar Song, Tu Bo, Gao Something, and his girlfriend, Ya Zhu.

Lu Fei recalled that just before the plane crash, Zhuge Yue and Zhuge Zhongyang were heading to the cockpit to check on Scholar Song's situation.

It seemed they had gotten separated from the plane's front and the larger group.

"‘The Era Calls’? So that’s what it is... How many sections does this exercise have?" Lu Jie asked.

Lu Fei thought for a moment before answering, "It has a total of ten sections."

"Only ten sections..." Lu Jie’s gaze drifted around.

The circle formed by the fifty or so gorillas was as tight as a barrel. Unless one sprouted wings and flew away, there was no way to escape.

This meant once this foreign uncle completed his ten sections of exercises, it would be time for the gorillas to attack again!

She had to think of a way! Before this Uncle Joseph completed his ten sections of exercises, she needed a plan to escape.

Lu Jie worked hard to calm herself.

While she was frantically brainstorming, Joseph had already started on the fifth section of the 'Chest Expansion' exercise.

Since the robust gorilla was using its 'exercise acceleration' skill, Joseph, pushing himself, began to speed up as well. Thus, in the blink of an eye, he was already on the fifth section.

Lu Jie tugged at her hair in frustration. "Damn it, in the face of overwhelming strength, no strategy is useful."

This wouldn’t do; at this rate, Uncle Joseph's ten sections of exercises would soon be finished!

She needed to stall for time and come up with an escape plan!

At this moment, Lu Fei suddenly called out to the twenty or so surviving passengers, "Is there anyone here who can breakdance?"

"Breakdance?" The passengers first looked puzzled, then their eyes lit up!

That's right; these gorillas seemed to excel at and enjoy mimicking human movements—evident from how the robust gorilla was 'competing' in gymnastics with Joseph.

If that was the case, perhaps performing some breakdancing could pique the gorillas' interest.

Moreover... some breakdancing moves were quite complex, making it challenging for the gorillas' physique to imitate them. Some moves might even confuse the gorillas, providing a chance for everyone to escape!

"I can!" At that moment, a voice rang out.

Everyone quickly turned towards the source of the voice... only to see a bound black uncle with a proud expression, saying, "I'm a breakdancing master!"

Okay, maybe black uncles were all great at breakdancing.

But right now, even if you were a breakdancing champion, it wouldn’t help. You were tied up like a dumpling, and a gorilla was holding the other end of the rope—no one dared to approach and untie you!

"Ahem, how about I give it a try?" A slightly chubby man stood up, chuckling awkwardly. "I learned breakdancing when I was younger."

But afterward... when he started working, he never went out to dance again. He had a family to support, and he couldn't act recklessly like a young person anymore.

His once nimble body had gradually gained some weight due to work, and he had no idea how rusty his breakdancing skills had become...

"Go for it, big brother!" At that moment, the cute little boy encouraged the chubby man.

Taking a deep breath, the chubby man gritted his teeth, mustered his courage, and walked towards Joseph’s back.

He planned to take over and perform some breakdancing after Joseph finished his ten sections of exercises, hoping to spark the gorillas' interest and get them to imitate his dance.

If he could catch the gorillas' attention, that would be ideal; if not... well, the outcome was predictable.

"I wonder if my body can still pull off any moves?" the chubby man thought to himself, secretly trying to loosen up.

Perhaps this would be the last time he danced in his life.

To end his life with the breakdancing he once loved... could be a nice conclusion.

...

...

Minutes later.

Joseph completed the last section of "The Era Calls"—the 'Cooling Down' exercise—at a speed nearing eight times normal.

He was pushing himself to the limit, his hands moving like blurs.

It was thanks to his relentless commitment to doing these exercises thirty times every day for over a month that he could perform "The Era Calls" instinctively and at such a rapid pace.

The gorilla opposite him stood still, intently watching Joseph complete the routine. At eight times speed, if it didn’t focus, it might miss several beats.

Once Joseph finished, panting heavily, he stared at the gorilla in silence.

The robust gorilla pondered for a moment.

Then it stood up—swish, swish, swish! It completed the 'Cooling Down' exercise at ten times speed.

After finishing the 'Cooling Down' at that speed, the robust gorilla continued to bask in the cheers of its fellow gorillas like a star.

Joseph let out a quiet sigh.

"Father, I did my best," Joseph said.

What a pity—he still hadn’t cultivated the proper energy and hadn’t become a true martial arts master... What a shame.

"Hey, buddy, great job. Let me take over now," the chubby man said as he stepped forward, patting Joseph on the shoulder.

Joseph looked at the chubby man, puzzled.

The chubby man advanced, facing the gorillas, and made a provocative gesture, challenging them to a dance-off.

...

...

The robust gorilla looked confusedly at Joseph, then at the chubby man.

At that moment, the chubby man began to breakdance.

He put his life into this dance, performing moves he had never dared to attempt before, and surprisingly, he pulled them off with exceptional skill!

The chubby man felt this dance was undoubtedly the best he had ever performed in his life.

Behind him, the surviving people cheered, affirming his performance.

Meanwhile, the robust gorilla tilted its head, its confusion deepening.

After a moment, it scratched its head.

Then it patted a slightly shorter but equally robust gorilla beside it.

The shorter robust gorilla stepped forward.

It charged towards the still-dancing chubby man!

And then... with a single strike, it knocked the dancing man out cold.

Quickly retrieving a rope, it skillfully bound him up...

The crowd's cheers were abruptly cut off, leaving them dumbfounded... unable to speak for a long time.

Was breakdancing unable to spark curiosity among the gorillas for mimicry?

Why could the gymnastics routines pique the gorillas’ curiosity, but not breakdancing? What on earth was going on?

The shorter robust gorilla dragged the chubby man back into the gorilla crowd.

Then, the robust gorilla raised its hands and pounded its chest with its fists, its gaze firmly fixed on Joseph.

The fighting spirit was palpable!

"Is it only through desperate effort that we can prevail?" Joseph thought.

With that, he let out a loud roar to bolster his courage. He charged toward the robust gorilla without hesitation...

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On the other side.

Wenzhou City, Baijing Road, Scholar Song's home.

Yesterday, Aunt Li's house next door suddenly moved out, reportedly because a wealthy individual offered a price Aunt Li couldn't refuse, buying her house.

That wealthy individual hastily moved in today.

Yunwu Daoist hummed a tune, carrying some small gifts as he sauntered toward Scholar Song's home.

He rang the doorbell.

Soon, Mother Song came down to open the door.

"Hello, who are you looking for? Oh? It's you?" Mother Song exclaimed upon seeing Yunwu Daoist. Wasn't he the heavily injured patient Scholar Song had picked up a few days ago?

Later, that patient had left overnight, taking one of her blankets with him!

"Hello, young lady, it's indeed me. My name is Li Yun," Yunwu Daoist said with a hearty smile. "Thanks to Brother Song's help, my injuries healed quickly. I came by to express my gratitude. By the way, I just bought a house nearby, so we are now neighbors."

With that, Yunwu Daoist eagerly presented the delicate small gift.

After receiving the gift and seeing Yunwu Daoist's warm smile, Mother Song's impression of him immediately improved.

"You don’t need to bring gifts when visiting! Come in and sit down," Mother Song said with a smile.

"Then I won’t be polite and would like a glass of water," Yunwu Daoist continued to smile amiably. Why did he come? He wanted to get close to Scholar Song and benefit from the 'Enlightenment Stone' on him to break through his current small realm.

Upon entering the house, Yunwu Daoist found that Scholar Song wasn't home.

He casually asked, "Oh, is Brother Song not at home?"

"Oh, he left early this morning to go on a trip with friends from his dorm. They say they’re going to an island abroad for a vacation. Young people are like that; they can’t sit still during the summer vacation, always wanting to go out and have fun," Mother Song said as she brought in tea.

Gone on a trip... and abroad at that?!

What a coincidence!

Yunwu Daoist was momentarily dumbfounded.

Fortunately, he had lived for hundreds of years, even if half of his life had been sealed away. He still had plenty of experience to adapt.

Before Mother Song noticed his daze, he continued to show his hearty smile. "When will he be back? He left in such a hurry last time that I didn’t get a chance to thank him in person."

"At least seven or eight days, or at most ten to fifteen days," Mother Song casually replied. Scholar Song had mentioned he would be gone for about seven days, but if he ran into that girl Fay Yu, who knew how long it might extend!

Yunwu Daoist's mouth twitched.

Damn it, he had been running around for days, committing around forty or fifty cases of theft, finally managed to save up some money, and couldn't wait to buy a house near Scholar Song's place—what was the point of all this?

He wanted to mooch off Scholar Song's 'Enlightenment Stone' as soon as possible!

But now, Yunwu Daoist felt like he would never experience love again.
