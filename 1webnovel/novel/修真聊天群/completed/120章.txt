**Is there something to eat?**

“Master, can you hurry up?” Scholar Song glanced anxiously at the hospital ahead, worried that the elder from the Xian Nong sect would come charging at any moment.

In an instant, the taxi driver’s imagination ran wild, concocting a melodramatic scenario where a young couple in love was clandestinely meeting at the hospital, only to be disapproved by both sets of parents, and now they were about to elope.

“Hold on tight!” The driver slammed on the gas, and the taxi surged forward at breakneck speed...

Inside the hospital, Doctor Li had just finished his break when he caught sight of Scholar Song clambering into a taxi while cradling Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan.

“Wait, wasn’t that Zhao Yaya's brother who just rushed out? And is he carrying someone? That sheet looks like it belongs to our hospital! What’s going on?” Doctor Li's face was a mix of confusion and curiosity.

As he pondered this, a middle-aged office worker leaped down the stairs, bounding down a dozen steps in one go.

“Hey, no jumping in the hospital! It’s dangerous!” Doctor Li shouted out, trying to stop him.

But the uncle didn’t care at all; his teeth were clenched in rage as he dashed after the taxi.

Obstacles like flower beds, railings, and parked cars littered his path, but nothing could slow him down. He moved with the agility of a parkour expert, weaving through the obstacles with ease.

“Oh, cool!” Many bystanders pulled out their phones, recording this impressive display of parkour skill.

...

Less than three minutes later, the taxi screeched to a stop in the bustling Da Ji district.

Scholar Song helped Sable Sixteen out of the car and quickly fished out a fifty-dollar bill, handing it to the driver. “Thanks, driver, keep the change.”

He didn't want to waste a second; who knew when that elder from the Xian Nong sect would catch up? Without waiting for the driver to respond, he scooped up Sable Sixteen and dashed into the depths of the Da Ji district.

“Turn left, it’s the nineteenth floor of the Ander A Building. That’s where I live. There’s a place we can hide temporarily,” Sable Sixteen whispered softly.

Along the way, she'd hidden her own presence—earlier, the intense pain had made it impossible for her to mask her aura, which had allowed the elder to lock onto her location.

Unfortunately, Scholar Song didn’t know how to conceal his presence.

He carried her into the Ander Building. Fortune was on their side as the elevator door opened just in time. This building only had this one elevator; if luck were against them, they would have to wait a long while.

They rode all the way up to the nineteenth floor, and Sable Sixteen opened the door, her voice weak. “Put me down, and stand here without moving.”

She then stepped inside, retrieving a bottle of potion from the liquor cabinet, returning to sprinkle some on Scholar Song.

This potion could temporarily mask their presence and scent. Once applied, Scholar Song’s aura and scent were erased right at the door. However, the effect was short-lived, lasting only a few minutes.

“Come with me.” Sable Sixteen led Scholar Song into the bedroom, where she opened the wardrobe and pushed aside some clothes. After fiddling with the wardrobe for a moment, she revealed a hidden door.

This was a cleverly designed partition between the bedroom and the bathroom—completely inconspicuous from the outside.

“Get in,” Sable Sixteen instructed.

Scholar Song followed her into the hidden room.

Sable Sixteen neatly rearranged the clothes in the wardrobe, pressed a switch, and closed both the wardrobe and the entrance to the secret chamber.

But that wasn’t all—she then pulled out a small scroll from the hidden room, unfurling it and sticking it on the entrance door. The scroll contained a formation that could conceal their aura and sound, creating a perfect hiding spot.

Seeing Sable Sixteen so well-prepared, Scholar Song couldn’t help but ask, “Did you know that elder was looking for you?”

Sable Sixteen shook her head. “Our Su family is powerful, and we have many enemies. This hidden room is just a precaution. It was originally a storage room for the previous owner; I only made a few modifications.”

Scholar Song nodded—being from a family of cultivators was no easy feat.

The hidden room was small, with the two sitting face to face, their breaths filling the silence.

“Do you think that elder will find us here?” Scholar Song asked in a hushed tone.

“I concealed my presence halfway… However, as long as he isn’t an idiot, he’ll still find this apartment,” Sable Sixteen replied, glancing at Scholar Song.

Since Scholar Song hadn’t hidden his aura along the way, even after Sable Sixteen’s presence vanished, the elder could still track them down by following Scholar Song’s scent.

So the question remained… was that elder really not an idiot?

...

...

Despite being a bit of a clown, the elder was no fool.

He followed Scholar Song’s scent right to the front of the Ander A Building.

“This is it! I can still smell that trickster’s scent inside!” The elder sneered; a cultivator's sense of smell is often sharper than that of dogs, and he would never forget the scent of that trickster.

He forcefully pushed open the apartment door. No matter how sturdy a security door was, it was mere paper in the hands of a cultivator.

“You can’t escape, vile trickster, and the young Su descendant!” The elder’s furious voice echoed in the empty apartment.

However… the entire unit was eerily silent, devoid of any figures.

And the trickster’s scent abruptly cut off at the entrance—there was a faint aroma of the special potion lingering in the air.

“Yet another trick pulled on me?” The elder roared in fury.

He began to ransack the apartment, smashing furniture and tearing at the ceiling. He searched every possible hiding spot but still found no trace of Scholar Song and Sable Sixteen.

“Damn it, where did they escape to?” the elder shouted, storming out of the apartment in a rage.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

After hearing the outside quiet down, Scholar Song asked, “Did the elder leave?”

“There’s no way it’s that easy… Now we just hope he doesn’t start tearing the place apart,” Sable Sixteen replied with a shake of her head.

This time, she had brought very little with her.

If only she had a few talismans, powerful magical tools, or even some pills to temporarily suppress her injuries, that elder from the Xian Nong sect wouldn’t pose a threat to her at all.

As she suspected, it wasn’t long before faint sounds returned outside.

The elder from the Xian Nong sect had come back.

Though a bit of a clown, he knew how to use a clever strategy.

“Damn it, could it really be that they escaped?” the elder muttered to himself.

...

...

After a long pause, the outside returned to silence once again, with no sounds to be heard.

“Did the elder leave again?” Scholar Song asked, afraid to use his spiritual sense to probe for fear of being discovered.

Sable Sixteen shook her head. She had her own way of monitoring the movements outside the hidden room. “The guy from the Xian Nong sect is still in the living room, looking like he’s waiting for a rabbit to hop into his trap.”

“What do we do now? Just wait for the elder to leave?” Scholar Song asked with a wry smile.

“It would be best if he leaves. If he stays here, I just need to wait until tonight when my injuries stabilize. By then, I’ll be able to deal with him with just one palm strike,” Sable Sixteen said nonchalantly.

Scholar Song realized he had forgotten that this girl was a genius comparable to Fay Yu. At such a young age, she had already faced the Third Grade Heavenly Lightning Tribulation.

In the old terminology among some ancient cultivator sects, the first grade was called Body Refinement, the second to fourth grades were Qi Refinement, and the fifth grade was the Golden Core Path. This girl was already at a high level of Qi Refinement, a step away from reaching the pinnacle of Qi Refinement and preparing to condense her Golden Core.

Once she suppressed her tribulation injuries, dealing with that elder would be a piece of cake.

For now, both sides were just going to wait it out.

Feeling bored, Scholar Song began practicing the “True Self Meditation Sutra” to refine his spiritual energy.

...

...

Time flew by, and soon it was noon.

Scholar Song’s stomach growled loudly. As a novice cultivator, he required a lot of vital energy while practicing, so he got hungry quickly and needed to eat a lot.

“Is there something to eat?” Scholar Song asked.

Since they were in a hidden room, there must be some provisions prepared, right?

“I can go without food,” Sable Sixteen replied, her gaze slightly lifted as she said this nonchalantly.

“Lady, what about me? I can’t go without food!” Scholar Song exclaimed in exasperation.
