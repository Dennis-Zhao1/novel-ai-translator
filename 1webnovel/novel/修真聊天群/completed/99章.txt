**Why Do Seniors Prefer Using Chat Apps for Communication?**

"So, I've shown my face in front of that guy for so long... He should remember me, right? I wonder when he'll gather his crew and come to the university town to mess with me?" Scholar Song tossed his bulging wallet in his hand, half hoping that the guy would come to practice his basic boxing skills. 

Practicing in real combat would deepen his understanding of the fundamental boxing techniques.

Even though, as a cultivator, it felt a bit beneath him to practice against ordinary people... he currently didn't have a suitable opponent. He should work harder to become stronger and seek out better practice partners, right?

……

After grabbing a quick bite to stave off his hunger, Scholar Song made his way to the Alchemical Sage's place, ready to assist his senior in perfecting the body-enhancing elixir.

This time, the Alchemical Sage had added two more common herbs, increasing the final elixir’s volume by an extra spoonful.

By the time the alchemy session wrapped up, it was already past four in the afternoon.

"Great! My thought process has been spot on these past few days. In two more days, I should be able to refine this new formula completely," the Alchemical Sage said, satisfaction radiating from him. He then handed Scholar Song the newly created ‘body-enhancing elixir’ along with a foul-smelling pill.

"Thank you, Senior," Scholar Song said as he accepted these treasures, leaning back in his chair to recover from the fatigue of potion-making.

"By the way, tomorrow I’ll have Ziyan bring over a ‘fire-controlling artifact’ for you. I’ll give you some time to familiarize yourself with it. Before I leave the Jiangnan area, you should try using a dan furnace to experiment with the new formula," the Alchemical Sage chuckled.

Once the elixir formula was perfected, he planned to leave Jiangnan, using the opportunity to help Scholar Song get accustomed to the dan furnace.

"Sure thing! But... are you really leaving so soon, Senior?" Scholar Song asked, genuinely pleased to cooperate. After all, he learned a ton of invaluable alchemy knowledge just by being around the Alchemical Sage.

"I've been here for quite a while now. If I stay longer, too many people will start coming to me for pills, and it’ll be a hassle," the Alchemical Sage replied, scribbling down data in his notebook without looking up. "By the way, did you encounter any issues with your cultivation these past few days?"

"Everything's been going smoothly," Scholar Song nodded, as he was merely going through the basic hundred-day foundation-building process.

"That’s good to hear. Remember, if you have any questions, just ask the seniors in the group. Don’t try to figure things out on your own; if something goes wrong, it could jeopardize your path as a cultivator," the Alchemical Sage cautioned wisely.

"Yes, I’ll keep that in mind. By the way, Senior, I wanted to ask if the Buddhist practice of ‘guiding wandering souls’ enhances one’s physical body?" Scholar Song thought back to the foreign monk he encountered on the subway.

While the physical enhancement during each session wasn’t significant, it was still far more effective than just running.

"Now that you mention it, I do recall that every time a wandering soul is guided, one receives a bit of merit energy. It can enhance physical strength at the first rank. But for cultivators above the second rank, it doesn’t have much effect," the Alchemical Sage explained. "Why? Are you thinking of becoming a monk and disappearing into the Buddhist realm? With society advocating harmony and coexistence, it’s not a bad choice to take the monastic route."

"Senior, don’t joke around! I’m planning to find a girlfriend during my university years!" Scholar Song waved his hands repeatedly, then continued, "I just want to know if the Daoist sect has similar techniques for guiding spirits that can enhance physical strength?"

"There should be something, but I mainly focus on alchemy, so I don’t know much about the methods of the Five Elements cultivation. You should ask in the group; maybe one of the seniors has insights on Daoist techniques for guiding spirits," the Alchemical Sage chuckled, recalling how his sect was always well-stocked with pills since he grew up in a pill-making environment. During his foundation-building phase, he had an unlimited supply of Qi Blood Pills and never thought about learning how to guide wandering souls.

Scholar Song nodded silently, but he didn’t feel the need to hurry on this matter.

"By the way, Senior, during the encounter with the altar master, I met that foreign monk from the Buddhist sect," Scholar Song recounted the subway incident briefly.

"I’m a bit curious about that guy. I initially thought he had some tricks up his sleeve to easily deal with the altar master’s corpse issue. I didn’t expect him to just brazenly take the blame," Scholar Song said, a mix of laughter and frustration in his voice.

"Heh, sounds like an interesting character," the Alchemical Sage chuckled. After thinking for a moment, he added, "I don’t think you need to worry too much. If he’s confident enough to take the blame, he must have a way to extricate himself. The secular world has been developing rapidly in recent years, and the cultivation world is starting to penetrate deeper into it. That foreign monk might just find a way out soon."

With the Alchemical Sage's reassurance, Scholar Song felt a wave of relief wash over him.

I hope that monk is doing well... He should be, right? Scholar Song's mind flashed back to the scene of the foreign monk grinning with bright white teeth when he got caught.

……

The Alchemical Sage continued jotting down notes, while Scholar Song took the opportunity to find a spot nearby to practice the ‘Basic Diamond Boxing’ and the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra.’ Once he returned to school, he’d have to find a place to train discreetly, constantly worrying about being seen.

It felt much more reassuring practicing here at the Alchemical Sage’s place.

After completing his training, he guided his Qi Blood value into his heart’s cavity. Scholar Song let out a deep breath, feeling his body and mind relax.

At that moment, the Alchemical Sage finished recording his notes and nodded at Scholar Song. "Not bad! You’re already able to control and guide your Qi Blood value into your heart’s cavity well. Your hundred-day foundation-building is just around the corner."

"Hehe," Scholar Song smiled shyly.

Then, the Alchemical Sage took advantage of the moment to explain some basic knowledge about cultivation and things to pay attention to during training.

In the midst of their conversation, Scholar Song finally mustered the courage to ask a question he had been pondering for some time. "By the way, Senior... there's something I've always been curious about."

"What is it?"

"Why do seniors prefer to communicate using chat apps? I would think there are techniques in cultivation like ‘long-distance sound transmission’ or other powerful communication methods. Wouldn’t those be more impressive and also safer and more confidential?" Scholar Song asked. This way, at least there wouldn’t be unexpected people like him getting added to groups!

"Is that even a question? It’s simply more convenient! What era are we in? With all these online communication tools available, why use some spell to transmit sound over long distances? You see, all you need to do is set up a chat group, and you can text, voice chat, or even video chat. Plus, the conversation can be saved for easy reference. There are even built-in mini-games to kill time, like farming or shooting games. Meanwhile, spells like ‘long-distance sound transmission’ have spatial limitations. When multiple people use it, it can get chaotic. If you were in our shoes, what would you choose?" the Alchemical Sage retorted.

"......"

"To put it in your terms, it’s like comparing the old brick-sized mobile phones from decades ago to today’s smartphones. Both are tools for long-distance communication, but if you had a choice, would you prefer to carry a huge brick phone around, or a sleek, multifunctional smartphone? If you choose the brick phone, then I can only say you must have a lot of free time on your hands."

"You make a good point, Senior," Scholar Song sighed, left speechless!

"Speaking of which, make sure to upgrade your farmland in the game soon! Waiting for your crops to mature takes a long time. Also, if you have the chance, start learning to drive... You don’t have enough Qi Blood pills on hand, so don’t think about rejecting the Hermit of North River’s offer. Accept this harsh reality," the Alchemical Sage closed his notebook, earnestly advising Scholar Song.

Scholar Song: "……"
