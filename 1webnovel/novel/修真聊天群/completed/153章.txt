**The Importance of a Good Teammate**

**Thud... Thud...**

The dull, thunderous sound echoed like the striking of a temple bell, reverberating through the air.

The people in the mansion were startled, and over a dozen security personnel quickly rushed to the entrance, ready for anything.

The gatekeeper peered through the surveillance monitor and saw a figure outside wearing a silly "Transformers" mask, banging on the door with fervor. Who in their right mind would wear such a childish mask in broad daylight and knock so aggressively—was this person out of their mind?

“Old Wang, who’s out there?” the security captain asked.

“Just some crazy person. Who's going to shoo him away?” replied the gatekeeper, Old Wang.

“I’ll handle it. Let’s take two people with me. Be careful; if he is indeed insane, we’ll just need to get rid of him and far enough away so he doesn’t come back to bother us,” the captain said, leading the way to a side door.

If the person outside was really nuts, it was better to be cautious. After all, getting stabbed by a lunatic was just a pointless injury. Bringing two people along to deal with him seemed like a smart move.

If he was just there to cause trouble, then he’d get a taste of his own medicine.

...

At that moment, Scholar Song shook his fists.

The steel door was painful!

No, that’s wrong—it was his fists that were slightly sore!

This heavy steel door was solid, not some flimsy metal sheet. Of course, Scholar Song didn’t have the delusion that he could punch through it.

He was self-aware.

That single punch was merely aimed at breaking the lock.

However, he hadn't anticipated that the lock on this steel door would be equally tough. With his 'Qi Blood Power' and spiritual energy combined, he could bend steel bars with his bare hands. Yet even with all his strength, the door didn’t budge.

Scholar Song sighed and turned to his companion, the Pekingese dog, Doudou.

“Woof woof.” Doudou panted happily, playfully blinking at Scholar Song.

Scholar Song sighed again, “Doudou, let’s just go inside.”

If the door wouldn’t open, then he could always fly in!

With Doudou around, that five or six-meter-high door was just a little leap away!

“Woof! Okay!” Doudou nodded in agreement, swelling up into a five-meter-long Pekingese demon dog.

Then, it raised its paw and slammed it against the steel door.

Boom...

The five-meter-high steel door collapsed.

As the heavy door fell, it kicked up clouds of dust, obscuring everyone’s view.

Scholar Song turned to Doudou—was this deliberate?

Doudou, tongue lolling, still looked adorable.

Scholar Song rubbed his temples. Bringing Doudou, this dog teammate, was it really the right choice?

...

At that moment, the security captain was just arriving at the side door when the massive iron gate suddenly came crashing down!

His heart nearly stopped—thankfully, he had taken the side door. Had he gone through the main entrance, the falling gate would have flattened him, and given its weight, it could’ve easily cost him his life.

“What happened to the gate? Did that crazy person use explosives?”

“I didn’t hear any explosions. Was it a new type of micro-explosive? Or was that rumbling the cause?” The security guards widened their eyes, staring at the fallen gate.

They saw a man standing with his hands behind his back, his face obscured by that obnoxious "Transformers" mask.

Since they couldn’t see Doudou, they naturally assumed Scholar Song was the one who had destroyed the gate.

“This wasn’t an explosion.” The security captain inspected the fallen door, noticing no signs of an explosion. So how had this door been opened?

But the captain quickly regained his composure, gesturing for his subordinates to surround Scholar Song, and sternly asked, “Who are you?”

Scholar Song smiled, his voice raspy, “Don’t worry, I mean no harm.”

The captain’s lips twitched—this guy just demolished someone else's door and then claims he has no ill intentions. Does he think we’re fools?

“Ha ha, I’m just here to take a friend with me,” Scholar Song continued, secretly channeling the "True Self Meditation Scripture" to accumulate his mental energy.

“Your friend? May I ask who your friend is?” the captain asked, puzzled.

“My friend was just taken into the mansion by you guys,” Scholar Song explained. “I’m just here to bring him back, so it would be great if you could return him to me.”

The captain was confused, whispering to one of his men, “Did Young Master Yigu finally fall from grace and go to abduct a woman?”

“Not really. Young Master Yigu did indeed go to take something today, but it was just a statue from an unnamed temple. Although I don’t know what’s gotten into him, it’s just a statue. If he stole it, he’ll just have to pay a little compensation,” one of the subordinates whispered back.

At that moment, Scholar Song added, “Yes, that statue is my friend. So please, could Young Master Yigu return my friend?”

Hearing this, the captain looked at Scholar Song with pity, realizing he was genuinely an idiot!

Suddenly, Doudou kicked Scholar Song from behind, “Why are you talking so much? Just go for it! They took the statue with great difficulty; do you think they’ll just hand it back because you asked nicely?”

Scholar Song was almost interrupted in his meditation by Doudou’s kick, feeling frustrated as he glanced at the dog. “I’m just stalling for time, gathering my mental energy to unleash my big move!”

His teammate was a dog; how could he possibly score a pentakill?

Scholar Song was planning to unleash 'Mental Pressure'.

After opening his heart and establishing his foundation, he had significantly boosted his mental energy. If he fully unleashed 'Mental Pressure' now, it would definitely be more than enough to scare a few female teachers!

However, that mental energy he had so painstakingly built up was nearly disrupted by Doudou’s kick.

“Then hurry up and unleash it!” Doudou urged.

“Fine, I will!” Scholar Song took a deep breath, activating the "True Self Meditation Scripture" as the ‘True Self’ in his consciousness suddenly opened its eyes.

In the next moment, the mental power he had been holding back transformed into 'Mental Pressure' and surged toward the security captain and his subordinates.

The captain and his men watched Scholar Song talking to "thin air," as if he were conversing with someone—definitely a madman!

And a madman who could topple steel doors at that.

What a terrifying opponent! Should they call the nearby mental hospital?

At that moment, they suddenly felt an invisible force acting upon them, sending chills down their spines.

Vaguely, they imagined a terrifying beast pouncing on them, its gaping maw ready to swallow them whole.

Weaker-willed team members felt their heads pounding and crouched down, clutching their heads. Those with stronger wills felt their legs weaken, shaking uncontrollably.

“Not a single one went down?” Scholar Song exclaimed—he had thought that after successfully establishing his foundation and opening his heart, a single 'Pressure' would knock ordinary people down in droves.

“With this level of mental power, making ordinary people feel weak in the legs is already the limit. To cause a mass knockout with 'Mental Pressure', you’ll need to condense your Golden Core and reach the Fifth Rank Spirit Emperor,” Doudou remarked.

But by the time one reached the Fifth Rank Golden Core realm, who would even need to use 'Mental Pressure'?

With just a glance, releasing their aura slightly would be enough to make ordinary people faint from the pressure.

At that moment, the captain was the first to recover.

“This guy has something strange about him, let’s take him down!” the captain shouted, his roar dispelling the fear in his heart as he and his subordinates charged at Scholar Song...

Thirty seconds later.

Scholar Song shook his fists, looking at the security captain and his men sprawled on the ground, writhing in pain.

“What a waste of time with that ‘Mental Pressure’. My fists are way more effective,” he muttered, cracking his knuckles in frustration.

“See? Told you it was a waste of time! Woof, stop messing around. Let’s get Venerable White out of here. I’m still waiting to hang out with my wife! Woof woof!” Doudou urged.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In the depths of the mansion, at an independent small building with a courtyard.

This was the residence of Young Master Yigu.

He was directing twenty burly men to carefully move the "Statue of the Nameless Immortal" into the courtyard. Even with a cloth covering it, he couldn't control his racing heart as he approached the statue.

This feeling was something he hadn’t even experienced during his pure first love!

Young Master Yigu casually asked, “What happened outside just now?”

“It seems someone came to cause trouble. Captain Liu has already taken people over to handle it. I believe it will be resolved shortly,” one of the burly men replied.

“Alright, have them throw the troublemaker far away so they don’t disturb me,” Young Master Yigu waved, motioning for all the men to leave the courtyard.

Then, he rubbed his hands together, excitement bubbling as he grasped a corner of the cloth, carefully lifting it.

The perfect statue was once again revealed before his eyes.

“Perfect! I could look at it for a lifetime,” Young Master Yigu murmured—having this statue, he could give up women entirely.

He would spend his life beside the statue, willing to become a vegetarian Taoist, worshipping the immortal day and night. Oh wait… aren’t vegetarians usually monks?

Just as Young Master Yigu was lost in thought, a sudden voice broke in, “Found you.”

He looked up to see a figure crouched on the wall of his small courtyard, wearing a "Transformers" mask.

“Hello, I’m here,” Scholar Song waved at Young Master Yigu. “The statue beside you is my friend, and I’m here to take him away.”

“Take him away? Not a chance! The immortal statue is mine, and it will always belong to me!” Young Master Yigu shouted angrily.

“How troublesome,” Scholar Song sighed.

If only the immortal hadn’t been in seclusion, he could have just blown up the statue and released it—why all this hassle?

Scholar Song leaped off the wall, “Unfortunately, this statue doesn’t belong to anyone. You’ve merely been influenced by its overflowing powers. Just take a nap, and when you wake up, everything will be back to normal.”

Scholar Song prepared to give Young Master Yigu a little nudge to help him sleep.

At that moment, a weak, furious female voice called from outside the small building, “Brother, I heard you stole someone else’s statue from their temple to pray for blessings? What’s wrong with your brain?”
