**How to Cut This Scallion Without Breaking It?**

As Scholar Song stepped out to buy a kitchen knife, Mother Song hurried to the door and called out from the stairs, “Oh, A-Hang, while you’re out, can you please grab a bottle of soy sauce? We’ve run out at home.”

“Sure, got it!” Scholar Song waved his hand in acknowledgment.

“Be careful on your way back,” she added, before turning and closing the door.

Once Scholar Song was a good distance away...

On the shelf, hidden behind a box, a tender stalk of scallion appeared!

“Tsk, tsk, tsk, foolish humans! Do you really think you can toy with me, a powerful spirit? How laughable! I am a being who has cultivated for over three hundred years! How dare you threaten me!” the scallion spirit declared proudly.

She hadn’t been taken by Scholar Song… The scallion he carried was just an ordinary one.

No matter how incompetent she might seem, she was still a spirit. Besides her ability to ‘burrow’ into the ground, she possessed a universal skill that all spirits shared: the power to remain unseen by ordinary folks! Of course, those who had built their foundation in cultivation could still see her true form.

But that wasn’t a problem—once she turned invisible, neither Scholar Song nor his mother would be able to spot her!

Just a moment ago, while Scholar Song busied himself inside, organizing that mysterious black box, the scallion spirit stealthily turned ‘invisible’ and slipped into the kitchen. She quickly grabbed another scallion that was about the same size as herself and still had its roots.

Then, she placed the new scallion back where she had been, rubbing her body against it to cover it with her scent, ensuring Scholar Song wouldn’t notice anything amiss.

Her true form remained hidden behind a little box on the shelf.

With everything in place, she patiently waited for the opportunity—waiting for Scholar Song to leave with the scallion he thought was hers.

Once he was gone, her chance to escape would finally arrive!

...

...

Things progressed remarkably smoothly; her luck today seemed almost divine!

When Scholar Song left, he didn’t think twice and casually took the tender scallion with him as he headed out to buy a cleaver...

But the scallion spirit didn’t rush. She listened as Scholar Song’s footsteps faded and his scent dissipated into the distance.

Only then did she leap out from behind the box!

“Now is the time for me to flee! I must get far away from this place and absolutely cannot let that guy called ‘Scholar Song’ catch me!” the scallion spirit thought to herself.

She never considered harming Scholar Song's family—not because she didn’t want to, but because she simply didn’t dare!

She sensed two powerful auras within the house!

These two presences were so overwhelming that to her, they felt as undeniable as the sun and moon in the sky!

Thus, she never thought of causing a ruckus; she only wanted to escape quietly...

“Freedom, long live!” the scallion spirit whispered excitedly, peeking out half her body, preparing for her getaway!

Just then, Mother Song’s voice rang out, “Huh? Why is there a scallion here?”

Before she could react, the scallion spirit felt a tight grip—Mother Song had caught her!

In fact, with the scallion spirit’s abilities, it would have been easy to evade Mother Song’s grasp... But just a moment ago, one of those two powerful auras seemed to stir, letting out a faint sound.

The scallion spirit got startled and was caught by Mother Song!

“I don’t remember putting a scallion here?” Mother Song said, puzzled, but she carried the scallion spirit into the kitchen.

Then, she tossed her among the few other scallions.

“Hmm, we don’t have many scallions left. How about making scallion stir-fried lamb?” Mother Song mused aloud.

The scallion spirit gasped, “Damn it, what does she plan to do? She won’t try to chop me up for cooking, right?”

While she was still contemplating this, Mother Song raised the kitchen knife and brought it down with a decisive ‘chop’!

How dare this human treat me, a three-hundred-year-old spirit, as if I were just a scallion? What a joke!

Furious, the scallion spirit thought, **You think I’m just some ordinary vegetable?**

So she readied herself to demonstrate her strength and show this human just how terrifying she could be.

But at that moment, one of those powerful auras emitted a strange groan.

Hearing that sound, the scallion spirit shrank back.

Forget it, let her cut me!

After all, an ordinary kitchen knife wouldn’t be able to harm her.

Once this foolish human realizes that her knife can’t cut me, she’ll give up!

*Chop… chop…*

Mother Song swiftly sliced through the scallions, and in no time, all the others—except for the scallion spirit—were reduced to tiny pieces.

The scallion spirit glanced at her fellow scallions, now ‘smashed to bits’.

How pitiful, it was truly tragic. They were her kind, just like that, torn apart by a human... She felt a twinge of sadness.

“Huh? Why is there one scallion that can’t be cut?” Mother Song stared curiously at the intact scallion spirit.

Could it be the knife was broken?

She examined the blade and pressed down on the scallion spirit, attempting to slice through again.

But the knife struck the scallion spirit’s body as if it had hit an incredibly tough hide, unable to penetrate at all. In fact, when Mother Song exerted all her strength, the knife even bounced back slightly!

“?” Mother Song looked puzzled.

“Are you dumbfounded? I may be weak, but I’m still a great spirit who has lived for three hundred years. How could a mere human iron knife injure me?” the scallion spirit boasted—of course, her words were inaudible to Mother Song.

“Is the knife too dull?” Mother Song thought, inspecting her kitchen knife.

She tried cutting various other things, like lamb and cabbage.

Strangely enough, the knife was quite effective, slicing through everything effortlessly!

So, Mother Song turned back to the scallion spirit and tried to cut her again... And, as expected, she still couldn’t slice through, no matter how hard she tried.

What a bizarre situation!

“Could it be this isn’t a scallion but some model made of different materials?” Mother Song wondered aloud, lifting the scallion spirit and sniffing.

A rich aroma of scallion filled her senses, and upon squeezing, she confirmed it was undeniably a scallion!

Mother Song was left dumbfounded.

After a moment of confusion, suddenly... she had an epiphany!

For some reason, she recalled Scholar Song’s ‘decorative knife.’

Why not try using that?

After all, it’s just a scallion, so it won’t ruin the appearance of Scholar Song’s knife.

Once she made up her mind, she sprang into action—a trait passed down from Mother Song to Scholar Song.

Without hesitation, she dashed into the living room, attracting the puzzled gazes of Zhao Yaya and the others, and retrieved the ‘decorative knife.’

Then, she rushed back into the kitchen with fervor!
