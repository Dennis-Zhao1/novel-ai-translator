**Running Under the Setting Sun, a Reflection of My Lost Youth**

Yet, in those final steps of failure, I ended up refining it entirely based on my instincts, rather than following the recipe step by step!

So, am I truly successful, or have I failed?

Scholar Song rested his chin on his hand, staring at the concoction for a long time.

Why not give it a try? After all, it’s the result of over three and a half hours of hard work.

He hesitated for a moment, but a desire to confirm the existence of 'cultivation' prevailed over his fear of the unknown potion.

If it goes wrong, I can always go to the hospital for a stomach pump.

Of course, Scholar Song wasn’t reckless.

He fished out his phone and dialed his roommate 'Tubo'. If anything went wrong, he could call Tubo with just a flick of his finger.

Initially, he considered dialing emergency services, but he worried that if he became too weak to speak, the operator might think he was pranking them instead. That would be a real tragedy. So, he opted for a familiar contact; if something went awry, a few distressed shouts would alert Tubo immediately.

"Just a sip... I shouldn’t die from it, right?" Scholar Song thought to himself.

Finally, he took a spoon, scooped up a mouthful, and blew on it to cool it down. What a pity, there were forty-five types of herbs in total, and now only about five spoonfuls of the concoction remained.

The value of these five spoonfuls must be worth thousands of gold coins!

“This is just sesame paste, just sesame paste,” he self-hypnotized, closed his eyes, and swallowed the potion whole.

To his surprise, although the concoction smelled dreadful, it had an indescribably fragrant flavor upon entering his mouth.

However, right after, he felt two sensations in his throat… pain and spiciness!!!

It was an indescribably fiery feeling; the potion, which was cooled before swallowing, exploded in his throat, unleashing an overwhelming heat that felt like it was about to tear him apart!

Crap, I’m going to need a stomach pump.

Scholar Song grabbed his throat with one hand while the other hovered over the dial button, ready to call Tubo!

Before he could move his finger, that explosive sensation in his throat suddenly vanished!

To be precise, the explosive potion transformed into a warm sensation, sliding smoothly from his throat down into his belly. He felt a wave of warmth spreading through his abdomen, making him want to moan in pleasure.

But as a grown man, moaning would be rather embarrassing, so he forced himself to hold it back.

That wasn’t the end; this warmth radiated from his abdomen, branching out through his meridians to every limb. What began as a soothing warmth in his stomach now blossomed into a feeling of absolute comfort throughout his entire body.

Scholar Song could no longer contain himself and opened his mouth, desperate to let out a moan; it felt too good to keep quiet!

Yet, as he opened his mouth, he felt as if it was sealed shut, unable to make a sound!

At that moment, he had an overwhelming urge to release something.

So, he mustered all his strength and opened his mouth wide, trying to push the sound from his belly through his throat!

He strained and strained, until finally—

*Pfffft!*

A loud sound erupted, but unfortunately, it didn’t come from his mouth. Instead, it came from his rear end. After all that effort, he had merely let out a fart.

At least it relieved some pressure, and Scholar Song let out a long, deep belch.

With that single belch, it felt as if all the warmth and tension within him had been released.

You see, as a person matures, various toxins accumulate in the body, leaving one often feeling like there’s a fiery tension trapped inside. Sometimes, one might feel a dryness in the throat while breathing.

But at that moment, after Scholar Song released that belch, it felt as if his insides had been cleansed. He felt cool and refreshed! Each breath was like being in a morning forest, with refreshing air entering through his mouth and nose, soothing all the way to his lungs.

With that belch, the potency of the potion erupted within him, flooding his body with an unending rush of strength!

The effects of the potion continued to surge, flooding every inch of his being, threatening to overflow and burst him apart.

Suddenly, Scholar Song had a brilliant idea. He recalled that in cultivation novels, the protagonists often practiced some martial arts or combat techniques after consuming potent elixirs to help digest the medicinal effects.

But he had no idea about any martial techniques.

Although, back in elementary school, his teacher had casually taught them Tai Chi, Scholar Song could only vaguely remember, “A big watermelon, cut in half, one half for you, one half for him.”

Moreover, he was quite skeptical of the Tai Chi version taught by his elementary school math and gym teacher; it might have been a questionable version from some obscure textbook.

“I need to release this energy, or I might end up like those protagonists in cultivation novels and explode from the excess energy!” Scholar Song felt compelled to move.

“Maybe I should go for a run?” Looking out at the scorching sun, he thought it surely wasn’t the best idea. However, the continuous surge of energy and vitality within him made him feel like he needed to release it somehow.

With a firm resolve, he dashed toward the school’s track field.

He ran and ran, with each step gaining speed. The more he ran, the more exhilarated he felt, almost as if his legs were floating with each stride.

He reached the track at a sprinting pace.

At this time of day, the heat was unbearable. Even the most energetic students preferred to shoot hoops rather than jog around under the blazing sun. Scholar Song was the only person on the wide track, letting loose like a wild horse, sprinting with abandon. Speeding up, he pushed himself harder!

By the end, he felt like he was losing control of his legs.

Each time he turned on the track, it felt like drifting!

He didn’t expend much effort at all; he had already sprinted a solid three laps, totaling twelve hundred meters. Yet, he felt no sign of fatigue—instead, with the warmth radiating from his abdomen, he felt lighter and lighter, running with increasing ease.

Even the icy beads of sweat couldn’t affect Scholar Song’s temperature. Sweat poured from every pore of his body, quickly soaking his clothes.

But it felt so good!

The moment the first bead of sweat rolled down, he felt even lighter. With each breath, every exhale felt like a refreshing breeze washing over him.

The body-refining potion wasn’t something you could simply drink and then nap to reap its benefits. Every cultivator who consumed such liquids would have techniques or exercises to help digest the potion’s effects, maximizing their potency.

Scholar Song lacked such techniques and was left with only running as the most suitable way to release the overflowing energy.

He lost track of how many laps he had run.

At first, he counted his laps, but soon it became unnecessary.

With his current state and the continuous burst of energy within, he felt as if he could run around the Earth if he wanted to.

So, he thought, he would just keep sprinting until the energy inside him stopped overflowing.

With that in mind, he had no idea how many laps he had completed—thirty? Forty? Perhaps even more.

Finally, Scholar Song came to a stop.

Even after sprinting at top speed for so long, he remained breathless and felt no fatigue.

Luckily, the explosive energy within him began to settle down, with the residual potency remaining in his lower abdomen, gently reinforcing his body.

Soaked in sweat, Scholar Song simply stripped off his sticky clothes, holding them in his hands.
