**A Fine Specimen of Poison Dragon Grass**

“Please don’t do that,” Scholar Song immediately interjected. “Three days ago, Fay Yu has already sent two of my teachers to the hospital. One of them is still there, and the other is the British professor you just met, leaning on a cane. If you send any more teachers to the hospital, it will definitely raise some eyebrows.”

“Ah? Fay Yu has already done that? Tsk, that complicates things. If I send another teacher to the hospital, it will just seem too conspicuous,” the Alchemical Sage sighed, scratching his chin in regret. “What a shame; such a brilliant scheme has already been used.”

Scholar Song continued, “Also, this isn’t a good place for refining body-enhancing liquid. My roommate could come back at any moment. If they find out you dragged me here to concoct some so-called elixir, they would definitely send both of us to the psychiatric hospital on Big Stone Mountain.”

There was no doubt about his roommates' goodness; they would absolutely do it.

The Alchemical Sage sighed again. “You know, mortals are truly troublesome. Scholar Song, why not break free from the mundane and join one of the sects in our group? Several of them are quite reputable, ranking high in all of Middle Land. For instance, the Da Luo Sect, Tianyayun Temple, Lingdie Island, and Xuanyuan Sword Sect are all well-known among cultivators.”

“I'll consider it,” Scholar Song replied. Perhaps one day in the future he would choose to join a sect, but not now.

According to the cultivators, he was still entangled in worldly affairs, and his thoughts weren’t yet clear enough to dedicate himself to cultivation.

“However, is there really no way for you to carve out some time this afternoon? If not, I could create an accident that would cause the entire academy to suspend classes! That way, it would raise no suspicion at all.” The Alchemical Sage calmly suggested this nerve-wracking idea.

“Senior Alchemical Sage, please don’t do anything so terrifying,” Scholar Song said solemnly. “I just need to ask for a leave of absence; I’ve even prepared a leave application.”

“Will taking leave cause you to fall behind your classmates?” the Alchemical Sage asked with concern.

In comparison to the entire academy having an accident, was my personal learning progress really that serious?

“Don’t worry; I can easily catch up by borrowing a classmate’s notes from any missed lessons. I’ve been getting the hang of things in my studies lately,” Scholar Song assured him.

“That's excellent! Then let’s find a place to refine the body-enhancing liquid!” the Alchemical Sage exclaimed, excitement lighting up his face.

“Why don’t we check outside the school for a rental?” Scholar Song suggested. He had initially planned to rent a room anyway, so it would be perfect to take care of it today.

“Right, that makes sense. I might need to stay with you for a few days, and not having a place to stay would be inconvenient,” the Alchemical Sage nodded. “Shall we head out now?”

The Alchemical Sage was quite impatient, which was consistent with his behavior in the group chat.

“Alright, let’s go,” Scholar Song said, pulling out his wallet and bank card.

As he reached for his wallet, he noticed the pot of Poison Dragon Grass sitting next to his computer.

“Senior Alchemical Sage, you mentioned in the group that you were looking to collect live Poison Dragon Grass; do you still need some?” he asked.

“I’ve acquired some from the friends in the group, but the quality is only mediocre, not very good. It doesn’t meet the standards I need for my experiments, so I’m just making do for now. Do you have Poison Dragon Grass?” the Alchemical Sage inquired.

“Yep, right here,” Scholar Song pointed to the Poison Dragon Grass next to his computer.

Honestly… Scholar Song's luck was quite extraordinary. Fifty or sixty years ago, the revered Lingdie used Poison Dragon Grass to hold formations. If it were any other herb, the Alchemical Sage wouldn’t have needed it at all.

Then the Alchemical Sage noticed the dark purple Poison Dragon Grass. “Interesting! I've been in the room for so long, and I didn’t even notice this plant!”

It was worth noting that the Alchemical Sage had been working with herbs for over five hundred years. Even in deep mountains and forests, he could find spiritual herbs with his eyes closed. Yet, he had completely missed this Poison Dragon Grass sitting right beside Scholar Song’s computer.

What was so special about this plant?

With that thought, the Alchemical Sage approached the Poison Dragon Grass, examining it carefully.

He sniffed, squeezed, and even sampled a bit of the leaf’s tip.

“Very good. This Poison Dragon Grass has been growing for fifty to sixty years in an area rich in spiritual and ghostly energy, and it was once used as the eye of a formation. Its quality is above average. Because it was used in formations, it seems to have mutated, gaining a certain degree of concealment ability. That’s why I almost overlooked it,” the Alchemical Sage said with a smile. This quality was precisely what he needed, and its mutation made it quite valuable.

Scholar Song asked, “Does this Poison Dragon Grass meet your requirements, Senior Alchemical Sage?”

“Exactly what I need… Now, are you planning to sell this Poison Dragon Grass to me?” the Alchemical Sage looked at Scholar Song with a grin. “But let me be clear, Poison Dragon Grass is a relatively rare herb, and this particular specimen is extraordinary. To give you an idea, the value of the two boxes of body-enhancing liquid that Fay Yu gifted you doesn’t even amount to one-tenth of this Poison Dragon Grass. So, are you sure you want to sell it to me?”

“I wouldn’t have any use for it anyway. Besides, if it weren’t for the free recipe you shared in the group for the modified body-enhancing liquid, I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to truly engage with cultivation,” Scholar Song replied.

The Alchemical Sage shook his head. “Even without my recipe, as long as you stay in the Ninefold Land No. 1 group, you would eventually come into contact with ‘cultivation.’ The value of that recipe varies from person to person. For Grandmaster Tongxuan or the Immortal of Rain Moon, it’s quite valuable because their sects support many disciples. But for you, as a beginner cultivator, a solitary wanderer, the value of that recipe absolutely pales in comparison to this Poison Dragon Grass.”

The Alchemical Sage carefully cradled the Poison Dragon Grass, and then with a clap of his hands, it vanished without a trace.

Scholar Song curiously asked, “A spatial ring? A storage bag?”

“It’s neither of those precious spatial items. Those kinds of spatial gear involve spatial rules; a fifty-cubic-meter storage bag could wipe out all my belongings,” the Alchemical Sage laughed. “This is just a similar sub-spatial technique, a method every alchemist possesses called ‘A Patch of Medicinal Field.’ It can only be used to transplant herbs; nothing else can be stored in it. Once your cultivation reaches the fourth rank or above, you’ll also be able to learn this little technique; it’s quite easy to master.”

Scholar Song nodded, feeling a bit enlightened yet still confused.

“Speaking of which, I initially just wanted to find some inspiration from you to improve and simplify the body-enhancing liquid. Along the way, I’d guide you on basic sword techniques and meditation methods to help you complete the hundred-day foundation. I didn’t expect you to provide me with such a generous gift. As it stands, I’m actually hesitant to teach you the meditation techniques and basic sword skills I had prepared,” the Alchemical Sage said, pulling out his phone and logging into the Ninefold Land No. 1 group.

He wasn’t the type to take advantage of his juniors; since Scholar Song had provided him with a high-quality Poison Dragon Grass, he planned to teach Scholar Song a couple of slightly higher-level techniques… at least ones better than the common stuff he had on hand.
