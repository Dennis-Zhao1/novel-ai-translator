**Cultivation is Just at Your Fingertips**

Fay Yu exclaimed energetically, “Scholar Song, join us at Spirit Butterfly Island! We have abundant resources and powerful techniques, plus with me around, I can look out for you!”

“Fay Yu, don’t interrupt; let me finish first,” Hermit of North River interjected.

Fay Yu sheepishly retreated.

“What’s the difference between the two?” Scholar Song inquired.

Hermit of North River replied, “Each has its pros and cons. But overall, the advantages of joining a sect far outweigh those of being a lone cultivator. So, let’s talk about joining a sect first.”

“If you join a sect, you’ll have a dedicated master to guide your training, sharing experiences and significantly reducing the mistakes you might make during cultivation, which saves a lot of time. And as long as you have talent and work hard, resources, techniques, and cultivation caves will never be lacking. This option is more suitable for those who are wholeheartedly dedicated to cultivation.”

“However… once you join a sect, you’ll have to adhere to its rules and serve the sect. After all, no rules mean no order. You’re benefiting from the sect’s resources, so you have to give back. Especially in sects like the one led by Master Tongxuan, once you enter, you have to shave your head and follow various Buddhist rules. You’ll also have to bid farewell to your family in the mundane world and endure a grueling training period until you graduate. If luck isn’t on your side, you might never see your parents again.”

It was clear that Hermit of North River harbored some resentment towards the Buddhist sect, having nearly been abducted as a child to become a little monk.

The wandering monk, Master Tongxuan, popped up with a silly smile emoji.

Hermit of North River quickly added, “Hahaha, it’s not just Master Tongxuan’s sect; others require you to part ways with your family to some extent as well. After all, a sect is not just a loose collection of individuals; disciples must live within the sect. Until you graduate, it’s rare for you to go out and about.”

Master Tongxuan sent another grinning emoji—was his previous silly smile a threat to Hermit of North River?

“With no effort, how can there be returns? It’s only fair,” Scholar Song understood. But deep down, he already knew that joining a sect wasn’t the right choice for him.

At least, not for the present—he wasn’t ready to part from his family and leave home to focus solely on cultivation. He still had ties to this world.

“Scholar Song, we at Spirit Butterfly Island offer much more freedom in this regard. Once you reach the third-grade Postnatal Battle King realm, you can leave Spirit Butterfly Island for a period each year, and with me here, I can help you gain even more freedom!” Fay Yu was still enthusiastically promoting Spirit Butterfly Island.

“Thank you,” Scholar Song said sincerely.

However, the third-grade Postnatal Battle King realm was an extremely distant goal.

Fay Yu was known in their group as a genius; she had been cultivating since childhood and was now in her twenties, yet she had only just reached the third-grade Postnatal Battle King realm.

Scholar Song didn’t consider himself a genius at all; if it took him four or fifty years to reach that level, it would mean he had essentially lost any chance of seeing his parents again.

“Ahem! Now let me talk to you about being a lone cultivator,” Hermit of North River said with a laugh. “As you can see, I’m a lone cultivator myself.” 

“Compared to joining a sect, lone cultivation means no guidance from a teacher, no resources, and no cultivation caves; everything has to rely on yourself. The only advantage might be the ultimate freedom.”

Being a lone cultivator was tough. Hermit of North River was one of the luckier ones; in his youth, he befriended Sable Seven, who took great care of him. Later, he joined the Ninefold Land One group on Sable Seven’s recommendation. There, he thrived and reached the peak of the fifth-grade Spirit Emperor realm, just a step away from advancing.

For an ordinary lone cultivator, without a teacher, resources, information, or cultivation caves, it would become increasingly challenging to progress after reaching the second or third grade, and once their lifespan ran out, they would turn to ashes.

“So where do lone cultivators get their techniques and resources?” Scholar Song felt that the path of a lone cultivator seemed bleak.

“Haha, if you hadn’t joined the Ninefold Land One group, I would have recommended you find a sect to join. After all, being a lone cultivator is incredibly difficult—it's not like the old days where it was easier to find spiritual herbs and elixirs in the mundane world. However, the Ninefold Land One group is quite special. Here, the leader, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, along with other powerful seniors, will occasionally lend a hand to members. You might be able to receive some rewards from them. This is also a way for the seniors to support the juniors. Alternatively, if ordinary members need help, and you can assist, you might receive some compensation in return. Just like how you got those two boxes of herbal materials from Fay Yu this time. But, it’s not often you meet someone as generous as Fay Yu, so don’t expect to get such rewards every time,” Hermit of North River joked.

“North River! I’m not wasteful!” Fay Yu shot back with an angry emoji.

Scholar Song imagined her puffing her cheeks in anger, undoubtedly looking adorable.

Hermit of North River chuckled, “So if you choose to cultivate alone, make sure to show your face in the group often. As long as you work hard, no matter if it’s techniques, elixirs, or resources, you can gradually obtain them. Honestly, the Ninefold Land One group is already taking shape like a sect.”

Hearing this, Scholar Song felt a surge of excitement. In the short term, being a lone cultivator was indeed the most suitable choice for him.

“Then, will you choose a sect or remain a lone cultivator?” Hermit of North River asked.

After he finished speaking, Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram chimed in, “Scholar Song, this concerns your future cultivation path, so take your time to think it over. Calm down, consider your options carefully, and choose wisely, so you don’t regret it later.”

“Thank you, senior. I understand. I choose to cultivate alone.” Scholar Song had already made up his mind.

“Are you sure you don’t want to think it over more? Once you choose the path of a lone cultivator, it will be quite difficult to join a sect later,” Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram reminded again.

Generally speaking, sects do not recruit lone cultivators.

After all, painting on a blank canvas is much easier than modifying a picture that’s already been doodled on.

Moreover, in terms of loyalty to the sect, lone cultivators cannot compare to those who have been nurtured since a young age; there are too many unstable factors.

Thus, unless a lone cultivator has exceptional talent or some particular strengths, very few sects are willing to accept them.

“Yes, I’ve thought it through,” Scholar Song replied earnestly. This was his choice, and whether it turned out well or poorly, he wouldn’t regret it.

Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram nodded and didn’t say more.

Moments later, Hermit of North River responded, “Scholar Song, since you have chosen the path of a lone cultivator, what you need most right now are the foundational techniques for body training and meditation methods. Usually, in our Ninefold Land One group, if you want to get something, you first need to put in some effort. If any seniors or fellow cultivators in the group need help, and you can assist, after fulfilling their requests, you can receive some needed techniques or resources.”

“However… you are a bit special. No ordinary mortal has ever joined the Ninefold Land One group before. Your strength is too weak; if you don’t first establish your foundation, even if there are seniors or fellow cultivators who need assistance, you might not have the strength to help.”

After all, opportunities like Fay Yu’s—where she only needed someone to show her the way—were rare. Most of the time, cultivators needed help in areas directly related to cultivation.

Scholar Song gave an apologetic smile.

“So, if you don’t mind, I can advance you a set of foundational fist techniques and meditation methods. Combined with your own ‘Body Refining Liquid,’ it should be enough for you to complete a hundred days of foundation building and officially enter the first-grade Transcendent Realm.”

“Once you succeed in your foundation building, you’ll be able to take on tasks from fellow cultivators and seniors in the group. You’ll also have a chance to repay my advance—though, I can only provide you with the most basic cultivation methods.”

Hermit of North River added, “Additionally, if you can obtain a ‘Blood Qi Pill,’ it will significantly reduce the time required for your hundred days of foundation building.”

The Ninefold Land One group was originally a small circle of mutual assistance, where seniors often helped juniors. It was merely a simple task to provide a set of common foundational techniques for cultivators.

After all, since Scholar Song had joined this group, becoming a cultivator was a foregone conclusion.

Moreover, once Hermit of North River advanced a set of foundational techniques, he would become half of Scholar Song’s guiding mentor. This favor would be something Scholar Song would remember for a lifetime—while the other half of the mentorship was undoubtedly from the generous Fay Yu, who had gifted him two boxes of herbal materials.

Hearing this, Scholar Song felt warmth in his heart. Even if it was an advance, even if it was the most basic cultivation method, to him, it was something he desperately needed at this moment.

His fingers hovered over the keyboard—next, he just needed to type a few words, and the door to cultivation would truly be opened for him!

At that moment, a new message popped up in the group chat.
