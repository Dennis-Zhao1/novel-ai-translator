**Can We Just Hold Hands?**

Scholar Song first ordered the restaurant's specialty fish head and beef soup, along with a dozen other assorted dishes. The rest of the orders would have to wait for his roommates to arrive.

The prices at the fish head restaurant were quite reasonable. Moreover, after recently completing a task for the little BOSS, he had earned some gold coins, so treating his friends was definitely within his budget.

However, the room was a bit stuffy; the air conditioning had been running for too long, leaving the air dry.

With a thought, Scholar Song tapped into his mental energy and gently released the chill from his 'Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl,' making the room feel more comfortable.

Fifteen minutes later, his three roommates, along with Gao’s adorable little girlfriend and the ever-present Zhuge Zhongyang, arrived at the private room.

“Scholar Song, you don’t mind if I bring a few more people, right?” Gao adjusted his glasses and said, “Even if you do mind, it won’t change anything.”

“Since you’ve spoken so openly, how am I supposed to respond?” Scholar Song chuckled.

“Actually, I was hoping you would mind a little. That way, I could have an excuse to kick this super annoying guy out,” Gao said, pointing mercilessly at Zhuge Zhongyang.

Zhuge Zhongyang shook his head. “Gao, you’re being tsundere again! How could someone as handsome as me be a burden?”

Gao’s face twitched, ignoring the narcissist as he changed the subject. “By the way, Scholar Song, my brothers have already set you up with Lu Fei.”

“What?” Scholar Song blinked in surprise.

Tu Bo patted Scholar Song on the shoulder. “No need to thank us; we can only help you this far. Good luck!”

“…” Scholar Song laughed awkwardly. “Should I really thank you guys?”

Li Yangde also patted him on the back. “No need to be polite. Just treat us to a meal of ten fragrant fish heads when you succeed.”

Just as they were chatting, someone knocked on the door of the private room.

“Come in!” Gao called out immediately, shooting a knowing look at Scholar Song.

The door opened, revealing a girl with a rosy face and an imposing figure standing at the entrance. She shyly smiled at everyone; it was Lu Fei.

Dressed in a black and white striped T-shirt and denim shorts, she showcased her long legs. Her long hair was tied into a ponytail that hung over her left shoulder, exuding youthful vibrance.

“Hello everyone, looks like I’m the last one to arrive!” she waved at them.

Tu Bo glanced outside and realized that this girl had come alone. That took some guts… or maybe she just really trusted Scholar Song?

“Just arrived, everyone just got here too. Come on in, take a seat, and let’s wait for the food,” Gao warmly welcomed Lu Fei in, arranging for her to sit beside Scholar Song.

“Good evening, Scholar Song,” Lu Fei said with a bright smile as she drew closer to him. Immediately, she could feel the refreshing aura radiating from him.

“Good evening,” Scholar Song replied with a gentle smile.

Inside, however, he sighed quietly. He appreciated his roommates’ good intentions, but unfortunately, he didn’t have the time for girlfriends lately. Cultivation was his priority; anything related to romance was a distant thought.

“Let’s raise a glass to Scholar Song for winning the 5000-meter championship!” Tu Bo lifted his glass and exchanged glances with Gao and Li Yangde.

Last time, they had all been knocked out by Scholar Song after just one round of drinks. This time, they were determined to redeem themselves.

Laughter and cheer filled the room.

With his roommates guiding the conversation, Lu Fei quickly integrated into Scholar Song’s little circle of friends.

As the drinks flowed and the laughter grew, Lu Fei subtly clasped her small hand, her heart forming a plan.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

After indulging in delicious food and drinks, Scholar Song called the waiter to settle the bill.

“Scholar Song, I have things to do tonight, so I’ll head back to my rental place. I won’t be going back to the dorm,” Li Yangde stood up and signaled to his companions.

Tu Bo immediately got up as well. “I’m coming too! Perfect timing; I’ve got things to do as well, so I’ll stay at Li Yangde’s place for the night!”

“I’m heading out with my girlfriend, so I’m taking Zhuge Zhongyang with me,” Gao adjusted his glasses. “Scholar Song, you’re going back alone, so why not give Lu Fei a ride? It’s dangerous for a girl to walk alone at night.”

Before Scholar Song could respond, the group quickly left, their camaraderie evident.

Scholar Song shook his head with a smile and turned to Lu Fei. “Lu Fei, let’s go.”

“Okay.” Perhaps due to the alcohol, Lu Fei’s cheeks were slightly flushed.

Leaving the bustling Ten Fragrant Fish Head restaurant, they walked side by side on the sidewalk.

“Scholar Song, do you have a girlfriend?” Lu Fei suddenly asked, her voice barely above a whisper. If it weren’t for Scholar Song’s enhanced hearing, he might not have caught it at all.

“Not at the moment,” he replied honestly.

Lu Fei giggled, revealing two cute dimples, feeling a wave of relief wash over her.

After walking a bit further, Lu Fei gathered her courage. “Scholar Song, how about we try dating each other?”

Scholar Song paused, astonished as he looked at Lu Fei.

Was this his first time being confessed to instead of receiving the rejection card from a girl? If his mother knew, she would surely celebrate with the whole family!

After a moment of silence, Scholar Song asked a silly question, “You like me?”

“Mm-hmm!” Lu Fei nodded vigorously—she really liked him, especially in summer. Scholar Song was like a personal air conditioner; anyone who experienced it would understand!

Scholar Song was dumbfounded for a long time.

Then he scratched his head. “Thank you… but I’m not looking to date right now for personal reasons. It’s not you; it’s just something going on with me!”

After all, he intended to devote all his spare time to cultivation, aiming for over six hours of practice every day. He simply couldn’t spare time for a girlfriend—a relationship felt like a waste of time.

Though he was a novice in romance, he knew that such matters shouldn’t be dragged out; decisive action was necessary.

“Ah?” Lu Fei’s expression turned blank, unsure how to continue the conversation.

This was nothing like the script he had discussed with his roommates! What happened to the saying that a girl chasing a boy was just a thin layer of paper? It felt so unreliable now!

Then, she suddenly blurted out, “If we’re not dating, can we at least hold hands casually?”

“Ah?” Now it was Scholar Song’s turn to look bewildered, unsure how to respond.

After a pause, he cautiously replied, “Holding hands should be fine.”

“Great!” Lu Fei beamed, showing no signs of disappointment—her goal had been achieved. She really just wanted to hold hands with Scholar Song every day.

They could go to class together, leave class together, and head back to the dorm together—almost enough for her. When he wasn’t around, she could still have the cool air from the air conditioner, even if it wasn’t as comfortable as being next to him. After all, she spent most of her time cooped up in her room.

“Then let’s head back!” Lu Fei happily took Scholar Song’s hand, her expression one of pure satisfaction, like a child excitedly clutching a new toy. Her steps became lively as they walked.

……

……

After dropping Lu Fei off at her dorm, Scholar Song returned to his own.

Habitually, he opened his computer and refreshed the group chat messages in the Ninefold Land One group.

Most of the earlier content was the Alchemical Sage detailing some data and analyses after examining the two friends and their Taoist companions who had entered the mysterious island, but they still hadn’t figured out the cause of their amnesia.

Just then, a familiar group member popped up, someone who hadn’t been active for a while.

It was Sable Seven, a well-known battle fanatic in the group.

“Seven, why have you been offline these past few days? How’s Sixteen doing?” inquired the Hermit of North River.

Surprisingly, the Hermit had been released from his one-day ban yesterday. 

Sable Seven sighed deeply. “Sixteen… has run away from home.”
