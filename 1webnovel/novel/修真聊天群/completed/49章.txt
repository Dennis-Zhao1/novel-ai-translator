**The Unparalleled Technique**

"From now on, practice diligently. Use the power of your condensed qi and blood to open the four apertures: eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Once all four are opened and connected with the heart aperture, it will manifest the momentum of leaping over the dragon gate. This dragon gate, once surpassed, will allow your qi and blood to transform from formless to form, turning the virtual into the real, thereby entering the realm of a Second-Rank True Master, where your qi and blood will transmute into true qi."

"I'll stop here for now. As for the rest, once your cultivation reaches a higher level, there will be plenty of people in the Ninefold Land to explain it to you. I won’t waste my breath. Now, take a look at this scroll I prepared for you, 'Fundamental Vajra Fist'. It consists of eighteen moves. Go through each page carefully and memorize it," said the Alchemical Sage.

Scholar Song nodded, opening the image of the first move from 'Fundamental Vajra Fist'.

"View in full screen," the Alchemical Sage reminded.

With a nod, he tapped the screen to enlarge the image.

The first move consisted of three postures, illustrated with both images and text. On the left were three humanoid figures demonstrating the stances, while the right side displayed traditional Chinese characters in vertical alignment.

However, he wasn't accustomed to this format, and he found it a bit exhausting to read.

Moreover, the text was written in classical Chinese. Each character was understandable on its own, but when put together, the content became convoluted and difficult to grasp.

His task now was to forcibly memorize every nuanced line and character without missing a single one.

In ancient times, missing even one character could completely alter the meaning. It would be a tragedy if he missed something crucial and ended up practicing incorrectly.

At this moment, the sealing soul ice pearl around Scholar Song's neck activated again, filling him with a refreshing aura that cleared his mind. Relying on this external aid, he memorized the entire text, imprinting it firmly in his mind.

Behind him, the Alchemical Sage's lips curled into a faint smile, seemingly satisfied with Song's progress.

After he finished memorizing the first page, Scholar Song still felt uneasy. He meticulously cross-referenced the content in his mind with the first move in the image to ensure everything matched.

However, for some reason, during this verification, he felt his vision start to blur.

Gradually, the world before him became pixelated, as if covered by a mosaic, transforming into a series of tiny dots.

"What’s going on? Am I seeing things?" He shook his head vigorously to clear his mind.

At that moment, his eyes suddenly brightened.

Before him appeared a vast and open grassland.

What was happening?

Scholar Song was startled. Was there something wrong with his eyes? Had he started hallucinating?

While he pondered this, a figure leaped up from the open grassland.

It was a man with a blurred face, bare-chested. His muscles were well-defined and brimming with explosive power, embodying the physique most introverted young men dreamed of achieving.

Scholar Song immediately heightened his alertness, preparing for anything.

However, the man paid no attention to Scholar Song and began to practice a series of martial moves in the grassland.

The technique consisted of three forms.

The man continuously cycled through the moves, effortlessly transitioning across the grassland.

What should have been a simple three-move technique morphed into an endless display of variations in the hands of this blurred figure. With every gesture, it felt as if he was illustrating the profound truths of heaven and earth through his fists.

"Fundamental Vajra Fist, Move One," Scholar Song recognized the technique.

Wait, why was he on a grassland? Where did this blurred man come from?

What was going on?

Calm down. Just stay calm!

Was this a spell from the Alchemical Sage? To guide him in the practice of martial arts secretly?

Or did the 'Fundamental Vajra Fist' itself possess some kind of mystical quality?

Or perhaps he had unintentionally triggered something by chance?

Regardless, this was undoubtedly an opportunity.

The man, without a doubt, was a master of the martial arts. Even though Scholar Song had no knowledge of martial techniques, he could sense the extraordinary skill exhibited by this figure.

Now, with the master demonstrating the basics of 'Fundamental Vajra Fist' right before him, without any blind spots, repeating the foundational moves over and over again, how could he let this opportunity slip away?

Scholar Song widened his eyes, determined to memorize every detail of the blurred figure's movements.

The man shifted and transitioned, his punches tracing arcs, seeking straightness within curves, combining offense and defense seamlessly;

He would charge straight ahead, his punches explosive like cannon fire, filled with immense power, reminiscent of a do-or-die determination.

Time flew by.

In the end, Scholar Song lost count of how many times the blurred figure had executed the technique.

After this nearly exhausting display, he had ingrained a profound understanding of 'Move One' from the 'Fundamental Vajra Fist'. Now, all he needed was to get out of this strange place and practice for a few days, and he should be able to grasp the move.

Once this thought crossed his mind, he felt his vision blur again.

Moments later, his eyesight cleared.

Before him stood his familiar computer screen, with the Alchemical Sage grinning proudly beside him.

He glanced at the clock in the bottom right corner of the computer… barely a minute had passed!

Scholar Song turned back to look at the Alchemical Sage, who wore a triumphant smile.

So, everything had been under the Sage's control. Scholar Song couldn't help but ask, "Alchemical Sage, what just happened?"

"It was a very simple hypnosis technique. Only someone like you, who hasn’t even entered the door yet, would fall for such a basic illusion," the Alchemical Sage chuckled.

"Was it you who cast it?" Scholar Song inquired.

"Not me. My expertise lies in alchemy, and I haven't studied hypnosis much," the Sage shook his finger and explained, "It’s the 'Fundamental Vajra Fist' scroll that has its own inherent capabilities."

"It has its own capabilities? But it wasn't extracted from a USB drive and opened on my computer; how could it possess hypnosis abilities?" Scholar Song was somewhat shocked.

If a cultivator's hypnosis techniques were this impressive, conquering the world wouldn't be a dream!

"It’s not as powerful as you think. It's merely a small trick used by ancient cultivators. The images of the three figures in the upper left corner of the 'Fundamental Vajra Fist' scroll and the text on the right were carefully arranged. Each character, every stroke, was meticulously calculated. When placed together, they form a rudimentary hypnosis formation. You then need to relax your mind and focus intently on memorizing the content. After several repetitions of matching your memorized content with the images, you will fall into a hypnotic state, revealing the illusions pre-arranged by the creator of 'Fundamental Vajra Fist'," the Alchemical Sage explained, his smile revealing a sense of pride.

"That’s incredible," Scholar Song marveled.

Just moments ago, he had experienced firsthand the performance of a martial arts master demonstrating the technique.

If he could master this hypnosis technique, he could apply it to writing a novel, allowing all readers to immerse themselves in the world of his story. Imagine how revolutionary that would be for novel websites!

Well, this was actually his second idea—his first was to use this technique to revise some taboo eighteen-plus literature, allowing people to truly experience it. Just thinking about it felt exhilarating! When that time came, things like 3D immersive experiences would seem so outdated!

This thought… he could only keep it in his mind. If he dared to voice it, the Alchemical Sage would probably send him flying with a slap.

"The remaining seventeen moves of 'Fundamental Vajra Fist', as well as the usage of the 'True Self Meditation Sutra', are quite similar. I’ll give you two hours to go through them all. Today, I’m in a good mood. After you finish, demonstrate it once, and I’ll point out any mistakes you might have," the Alchemical Sage laughed heartily.
