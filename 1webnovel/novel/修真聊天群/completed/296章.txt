**So Simple, Yet Something Feels Off!**

However, this time, the flight attendant's body was not engulfed in flames.

Had she missed her chance? The plump flight attendant thought to herself.

At that moment, on the door, a glowing screen reappeared with a line of text: [Stop taking pictures! If you keep at it, I’ll get angry!]

The plump flight attendant was startled, genuinely startled—she jumped back so suddenly that she almost knocked over the person behind her, who stumbled to regain their balance.

About two minutes later, the heavy, massive metal door began to rise slowly.

However, the door didn’t open fully; it only raised about two meters and then stopped.

Even at two meters high, it was enough to let everyone pass through—though it felt a bit daunting. With such a gigantic metal door hovering above, it gave off the impression that it could crush anyone beneath it at any moment. If it did fall... how many people would be crushed? They would be squashed into a pulp, right?

Thus, the passengers hurried through the hanging city gate, eager to get past before it crashed down.

...

...

Once safely through the city gate, everyone let out a sigh of relief.

Then, they curiously peered inside the city.

Beyond the gate lay an immensely wide official road that led directly into the inner city. On either side of the road stood neatly aligned ancient trees towering over ten meters high, with a crystal-clear river flowing nearby...

Standing just inside the ancient gate was an elderly man dressed in traditional attire, as if he had been waiting for them.

Behind him stood fifteen robust men, all muscular and formidable.

"Welcome, heroes from afar! We are honored to have you as our guests!" The elderly man in traditional attire greeted them warmly, approaching the front, starting with Joseph, shaking hands with each passenger enthusiastically.

His intense enthusiasm caught the remaining passengers off guard for a moment.

When the elderly man finally reached Scholar Song’s hand, Song slightly furrowed his brows—his eyes had opened, allowing him to see details others couldn’t.

He had just noticed that the elderly man’s gestures, smiles, and tone were identical for each handshake.

Especially when the elderly man said, “Welcome, welcome,” the rhythm and intonation of his voice remained completely unchanged.

This eerie feeling reminded Song of the looped recordings from the speakers on the city wall—the old man’s actions resembled a robotic playback!

After shaking Scholar Song’s hand, the elderly man excitedly exclaimed, “Thank you, heroes! It is thanks to you that we were able to fend off the giant eagle's attack!”

With that, he clapped his hands vigorously.

Behind him, the fifteen strong men followed suit, applauding with equal fervor.

Scholar Song felt an even stranger sensation—when the fifteen robust men clapped, their motions of open and closed palms were perfectly synchronized, as if they were precision robots.

“No need to be so polite, old man. We were merely defending ourselves,” Scholar Song cautiously replied—he had long suspected that this gigantic ‘mysterious island’ might be something like a ‘real illusion.’ So, he wanted to test if the elderly man could engage in a meaningful conversation.

If the response was nonsensical, it could very well indicate that this was indeed a real illusion.

“No matter what, you are all heroes, and we are immensely grateful!” The elderly man replied fluently, then added, “Would you mind if we brought in those few flat-haired beasts? Although they often cause us trouble, they are indeed a rare delicacy. After your long journey, it would be a great help to replenish your energy with these flat-haired beasts.”

“Whatever you decide, old man. We are quite famished as well. Also, could you arrange a place for us to rest for a bit?” Scholar Song inquired again.

“Not a problem. In our city, we may lack other things, but there is no shortage of vacant resting places,” the elderly man chuckled—although this ancient city was grand, most areas appeared desolate.

As he spoke, the elderly man waved lightly, and the fifteen robust men began to move out of the city in an orderly fashion. Ten of them split into two groups to carry the two giant eagles that Scholar Song had slain. The remaining five strolled along the city wall to retrieve the first male eagle that Scholar Song had killed.

“Please follow me, heroes. I’ll take you to a place to rest,” the elderly man said, turning to lead the way.

The passengers looked at Scholar Song, puzzled.

“Let’s go. It’s not every day we get to enter a city; we should take this opportunity to explore,” Scholar Song replied.

...

...

As they walked, the elderly man remained effusively warm, continuously introducing the magnificence of the ancient city to Scholar Song.

The elderly man’s descriptions were so detailed that even a stone tablet within the city was recounted with historical depth—passengers felt they couldn’t interject at all.

Scholar Song laughed and nodded along with the old man.

Then… suddenly, smiling, Scholar Song asked, “Old man, did you take a dump?”

“Ha-ha! Young friend, you think so too, huh?” The elderly man chuckled, stroking his beard.

The conversation… was off-kilter!

Scholar Song thought for a moment and tried asking a more rude question, “Old man, is your mom a big monkey?”

He slurred the words just enough and sped up his speech—if anything went wrong, he could claim it was a tongue-tie and that he meant to ask if they had big monkeys.

The surrounding passengers stared blankly, unsure of what Scholar Song was doing.

However, the elderly man seemed to act as though he hadn’t heard Scholar Song’s words, still smiling brightly.

He continued to hold Scholar Song’s hand and enthusiastically pointed out a row of willow trees ahead, “Look, hero, those willows are magnificent. Don’t underestimate them; they boast a history of over a hundred years. Legend has it that the new buds harvested annually, when combined with some medicinal herbs, can be brewed into a miraculous tea to enhance one’s health.”

Had that question been brushed aside? But the conversation… still didn’t align.

Feeling a bit guilty, Scholar Song cheerfully probed, “Your dad’s a big gorilla.”

“Ha-ha-ha! You also think these willows are quite nice, right?” The elderly man replied, beaming.

Scholar Song nodded, feigning admiration, “You’re a big monkey.”

“Ha-ha-ha! You speak wisely, hero!” The elderly man laughed in return.

The passengers nearby were completely dumbfounded. They rubbed their ears, puzzled whether Scholar Song had lost his mind, or if the elderly man had, or perhaps it was their own hearing that had failed? Or was the entire world out of sync?

Sure enough, the conversation had completely derailed.

Scholar Song rubbed his face vigorously; this elderly man was indeed problematic… he was clearly operating on a set ‘program.’

The old man could respond fluently at the city gate, clearly functioning like a ‘chatbot AI’ that selects appropriate replies based on keywords and the expressions of the conversational partner.

Once inside the city, the elderly man switched to the mode of introducing the ancient city. He continuously detailed everything, leaving the others hardly a chance to speak.

Even if this wasn’t a ‘real illusion,’ the old man could very well be a puppet of some intelligent AI.

Never mind, it didn’t feel rewarding to bully such a chatbot AI.

It was better to directly ask what he wanted to know.

“Old man, I’d like to inquire about the passengers who pressed ‘yes’ at the city gate—were they sent back home?” Scholar Song asked.

“The choice at the city gate? What’s that?” The elderly man turned around, puzzled.

This question… wasn’t within the elderly man’s response capacity?

Scholar Song pressed on, “Then, how do we leave this place?”

This time, all the passengers turned their hopeful gazes toward the old man.

“Leave this place?” The elderly man pointed to the tallest tower in the ancient city, “See that tower? Inside is a massive trading venue. Anyone can enter with something of their own to exchange for something they desire. No tricks, just fair trade!”

“Can we exchange for a chance to leave there?” Scholar Song immediately inquired.

The elderly man shook his head, “With a promise of no tricks and fair trade, how could one use a chance to leave as leverage? Just complete a transaction in that tower—any kind of transaction—and you can leave here.”

Scholar Song paused for a moment.

So simple?

If it was that simple… then why did the predecessors in the Ninefold Land Group encounter various difficulties on the mysterious island? Although they hadn’t sustained serious injuries, they had gone through several fierce battles.

In the end, they had to seal their memories before leaving? Had the predecessors entered a different place from him? Or was it that the way the predecessors entered the instance was incorrect?

“We’ve arrived. This is the area I oversee; you can freely reside in any of these houses. Once those young men bring back the flat-haired beasts, I’ll show you something special,” the elderly man chuckled, pretending to stir a pot.

“Thank you, old man,” Scholar Song replied.

Although he was merely an intelligent AI character, he had indeed helped them significantly by informing them of the way back… after taking a rest to regain their strength and spirit, he could go get Zhuge Yue and Zhuge Zhongyang and then return through that tower.

“Then, please rest well, heroes. I won’t disturb you any longer,” the elderly man said with a warm smile.

Everyone politely exchanged a few words with the old man.

As the elderly man turned to leave, he suddenly stiffened after taking two steps.

Then, inexplicably, he returned to Scholar Song’s side, grasped his hand, and shook it warmly.

At the same time, he whispered in a voice only Scholar Song could hear, “Welcome to ‘Heavenly Realm Island’, Scholar Song. I hope you have a great time.”

Scholar Song froze at those words; this elderly man wasn’t an intelligent AI? And why did he pronounce his name so deliberately?

Wait, if he wasn’t an intelligent AI, he had just verbally abused him several times! Did the old man hold a grudge?
