**The Alchemical Sage and the Reward**

The news came from Fay Yu, who eagerly volunteered, “Immortal Sage of North River, let me take charge of teaching Scholar Song the foundational cultivation techniques! Even though I’m only at the Third Stage, I can definitely handle teaching the basics! Besides, I’ve been wanting to make another trip to the Jiangnan region!”

She was genuinely curious to witness the process of Scholar Song using an induction cooker to concoct the Body Refining Liquid—more importantly, she wanted to sneak out and have a little fun before her father returned home. The allure of the outside world captivated her, and she found herself constantly daydreaming about running away from home.

As soon as Fay Yu finished speaking, Wild Blade of Three Tides chimed in, “Just stay put on Lingdie Island and wait for me to return! I’ll be setting off in an hour and will reach Lingdie Island by evening.”

It was clear that the one speaking this way was the respected Lingdie, who seemed to be busy dealing with Wild Blade of Three Tides and hadn’t returned home yet.

Fay Yu stuck out her tongue, realizing she shouldn’t say anything further.

Immortal Sage of North River sent a smiley face emoji, clearly teasing Wild Blade of Three Tides.

Scholar Song smiled too, feeling relieved. He typed a few words into the chat, “Thanks for your help, Immortal Sage of North River. I need to…”

Before he could finish, another message popped up in the chat.

This time it was from The Alchemical Sage, who simply wrote: “I’ll do it!”

The message was so puzzling that even Immortal Sage of North River couldn’t figure out what he meant.

After a brief pause, The Alchemical Sage replied, “North River, please let me take care of teaching young Scholar Song his techniques.”

After yet another long pause…

The Alchemical Sage added, “Scholar Song, I just simulated the process of you refining the Body Refining Liquid using my spells and came up with some interesting possibilities that could help me refine and simplify the formula. There are some things that can’t be conveyed through text, so I’d like to personally observe you refine the Body Refining Liquid. I hope you can assist me in perfecting and simplifying the formula. Regardless of whether my experiments succeed or not, I’ll provide you with a generous reward for your efforts—a set of body refinement sword techniques and a meditation method.”

After a moment, he continued, “My sword techniques and meditation method are slightly better than those of Immortal Sage of North River.”

This was an outright temptation.

“Since The Alchemical Sage is willing to guide Scholar Song, that’s perfect!” Immortal Sage of North River laughed, “Scholar Song, why not hurry and agree to The Alchemical Sage? This is an opportunity for free guidance in your foundational training—definitely not something to miss!”

Immortal Sage of North River couldn’t help but feel that Scholar Song’s luck was extraordinary.

Generally speaking, the hardest two steps for a wandering cultivator to take are refining the Body Refining Liquid and establishing their foundation.

Establishing a foundation is challenging because most wandering cultivators rely on one or two scrolls of techniques for self-teaching. Without a master to guide them or incomplete techniques, they often make mistakes and waste time during the foundational establishment process.

And refining the Body Refining Liquid is even more troublesome; wandering cultivators have to gather the medicinal materials themselves, and they might even need to refine it on their own. The bitterness of that process was something Immortal Sage of North River, who had once lost everything, did not dare to reminisce about.

But Scholar Song had Fay Yu gifting him materials, and now The Alchemical Sage wanted to guide him in establishing his foundation in exchange for his help—he was about to effortlessly overcome the two hardest steps for wandering cultivators.

“Thank you, both of you,” Scholar Song expressed his gratitude. Indeed, everyone in the Ninefold Land One group was genuinely good people!

Good person card sent.

…

…

“Scholar, what’s your address?” The Alchemical Sage inquired.

Scholar Song quickly replied, “Jiangnan University Town in the Jiangnan region; I’m staying in the student dormitory.”

At the same time, his gaze drifted to the small potted plant beside his computer. Inside was a curvy plant that resembled a coiled dragon, with a row of backward-facing thorns at the tip and dark purple roots.

It was the Toxic Dragon Grass, the herb The Alchemical Sage had previously inquired about in the group.

Scholar Song wondered if The Alchemical Sage still needed the Toxic Dragon Grass. 

“Do you have a contact number?” The Alchemical Sage asked again.

Scholar Song promptly sent over his phone number.

The Alchemical Sage responded, “I’ll arrive tomorrow morning. I’ll look for you!”

Before Scholar Song could say more, The Alchemical Sage had already logged off quickly.

He had wanted to mention the Toxic Dragon Grass but decided to wait until The Alchemical Sage arrived to discuss it.

“Tomorrow morning, huh?” Scholar Song pondered. He had classes tomorrow morning, right?

Well, if it came down to it, he could just take another morning off. After all, he had already taken quite a few days off recently; another morning wouldn’t hurt.

In the Ninefold Land One group.

Fay Yu, who had just been scared off by her father, cautiously popped back into the conversation, “Scholar Song, are you really determined to walk the path of a wandering cultivator? Even with everyone in the Ninefold Land One group helping, being a wandering cultivator is still very tough.”

“This method suits me better right now,” Scholar Song replied with a smile. “Also, Fay Yu, I was just thinking—was it really a coincidence that the two professors were hospitalized the other day?”

“Wow, haha! Scholar Song, what are you talking about? It’s definitely just a coincidence! I swear I’ve never told a lie my whole life!” Fay Yu quickly typed. “By the way, our senior brother is calling for us, so he must need us for something. You all chat for now; I’m logging off!”

Without giving Scholar Song a chance to respond, she swiftly logged out.

Scholar Song rubbed his chin, “It really wasn’t a coincidence. I mean, what are the odds of two professors being hospitalized for foot injuries at the same time?”

He felt a bit guilty towards Teacher Ren and Professor Smith. Maybe he should visit them when he had the time in a few days?

After all, it was their injuries that allowed him to accompany Fay Yu to the Luo Xin District, which in turn earned him two boxes of medicinal herbs from her, giving him a chance to step into the cultivation world.

Speaking of which, the chat in the group just now felt like a dream.

In his imagination, becoming a cultivator would surely involve going through various trials and tribulations, akin to Tang Seng obtaining the scriptures, before receiving the teachings of longevity.

But unexpectedly, instead of facing difficult challenges, the seniors in the group were offering help.

If this really is a dream, he sincerely hoped he wouldn’t wake up.

In the Ninefold Land One group, Immortal Sage of North River sent another message, reminding Scholar Song, “Scholar Song, if you ever have any questions about your cultivation path, don’t hesitate to ask us in the group.”

“Choosing to be a wandering cultivator means you won’t have a teacher to guide you. So if you encounter any confusion, especially regarding cultivation, don’t be shy to ask. Otherwise, one wrong step can lead to another. At best, you waste your cultivation time; at worst, you could fall into madness and face great calamity.”

“Thank you for the reminder, senior.” Thinking of questions, Scholar Song immediately recalled something, “By the way, Immortal Sage of North River, can the Body Refining Liquid be taken by others? Like my parents or relatives? Is there any taboo regarding this in the group?”

Scholar Song wasn’t a selfish person.

The effects of the Body Refining Liquid were so remarkable that it could even eliminate many health issues during refinement. Naturally, he thought of Father Song and Mother Song first—after all, filial piety comes first.

“We have no taboos regarding that. As long as you have extra elixirs, it’s fine to give them to your relatives. After all, elixirs and techniques are different; techniques shouldn’t be easily shared, but there are no restrictions on elixirs.”

Immortal Sage of North River continued, “However, I must remind you that the herbs in this world are not as plentiful as you might imagine. Moreover, generous people like Fay Yu are rare, so you may not be able to obtain more herbs for a while. Even if you succeed in refining them every time, with thirty-two sets of materials, you can only produce thirty-two portions of Body Refining Liquid. This amount is barely enough for your hundred days of foundational training.” Immortal Sage of North River explained gently.

He didn’t disapprove of Scholar Song wanting to give the elixirs to his family; in fact, he admired that.

When one thinks of their loved ones first upon experiencing the benefits of the Body Refining Liquid, it shows a character aligned with righteousness and propriety. Such a person would be a trustworthy companion on the path of cultivation.

After all, not many would want to associate with unpredictable and evil entities as their closest allies.
