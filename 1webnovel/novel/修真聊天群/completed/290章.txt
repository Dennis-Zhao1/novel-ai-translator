**Shrinking Lizard**

In the end, the old professor, along with four women and three slightly plump clerks, chose to team up together. 

The others decided to follow Scholar Song toward the ancient city.

The old professor was deeply intrigued by this peculiar island. While others were oblivious, he recognized the small plants under his feet and the towering trees in the distance as species that had long been extinct on Earth. 

These were plants he had only seen in textbooks, now vividly alive before his eyes. Therefore, he opted to stay behind, eager to study these precious specimens, hoping to bring back some living samples. After all, in the old professor's view, as long as he knew the direction of the ancient city, he could always catch up later.

Well... research enthusiasts are usually quite rational, but when they become utterly absorbed, nobody can stop them. The professor's passion for research was burning fiercely, and even the recent encounter with the gorillas couldn't dampen his enthusiasm.

As for the four women and the three clerks, they all seemed to possess various forms of divination.

Scholar Song didn't push them to change their minds.

However, before leading his group away, he pointed out the direction of the "ancient city" to the old professor and his companions.

“Lastly, I want to remind you all that this place is quite dangerous... not just because of the gorillas, but there are greater hidden dangers lurking. Just take care of yourselves,” Scholar Song advised.

He had done all he could, and his warning was straightforward.

From then on, whether the old professor's group heeded his advice and what would become of them was entirely in their hands.

Sister Lu Fei, Joseph, the little boy, Uncle Black, the slightly plump flight attendant, and the other five female passengers all followed Scholar Song as they departed.

Afterward, Gao, Mei Yi, and Tu Bo emerged from their hiding place to join him.

“Scholar, what just happened?” Gao was utterly baffled. How did all the gorillas suddenly flee when Scholar Song showed up? He wasn’t a beast, and even if a tiger, the king of the forest, faced fifty strong gorillas, it would have to retreat in defeat.

“I just popped my head out, and I was confused too,” Scholar Song replied with a wry smile. He had only released a bit of 'mental pressure'; who knew the gorillas would be so easily frightened?

Then he added, “Let’s not dwell on it. The wilderness on this island is filled with danger; we should seek shelter in the ancient city for now.”

Gao nodded silently.

Under Scholar Song's lead, the group hurried toward the direction of the "ancient city."

“Let’s hope for a safe journey. Venerable White, wish me luck!” Scholar Song thought to himself.

According to the seniors' descriptions in the group, even fifth-grade Spirit Emperors and sixth-grade True Monarchs had faced difficulties on this mysterious island. How could he, a mere first-grade nobody, not get bullied by the island's beasts?

At this moment, he needed a stroke of luck to protect him.

And when it came to luck... asking anyone was less effective than asking Venerable White. As Fay Yu put it, wishing upon Venerable White was incredibly effective!

...

...

All the while, Scholar Song fully expanded his mental energy, maintaining the trick of the 'Mental Detective Method.'

With this, he guided the group, avoiding numerous lurking beasts that appeared quite ferocious. However, these lurking beasts were not the main concern; what he truly hoped to avoid were the monstrous beasts.

If they encountered a monstrous beast, Scholar Song estimated that by the time his mental detection method touched the creature, it would have already discovered their presence.

At that point, perhaps a large carnivorous monster would enjoy a hearty meal.

...

...

Before long, Scholar Song’s group crossed the plain and reached the edge of the jungle, where they could see the outline of the ancient city in the distance!

“There really is an ancient city!” Uncle Black exclaimed excitedly. He hadn’t fully believed Scholar Song's words, but seeing everyone follow him, he decided to tag along with the group.

Lu Fei whispered, “It looks like an ancient city from China.”

“This is truly a mysterious place.” Sister Lu seemed to develop a keen interest in their surroundings.

Excitedly, everyone’s voices involuntarily grew louder.

Scholar Song quickly raised his hand to silence them: “Shh... everyone be careful. We need to navigate around the jungle's edge quietly.”

As soon as everyone recalled the terrifying and laughable gorillas, they instinctively hushed themselves, suppressing their excitement.

Once their emotions stabilized, Scholar Song led them onward.

...

...

There’s a psychological principle known as Murphy's Law: if something can go wrong, it will. In simpler terms, what you fear is what will come.

As the group cautiously made their way forward... suddenly, a massive green creature rose from the jungle about a hundred meters away.

The trees at the jungle's edge stood around ten meters tall, but this giant creature towered over them, standing a full head taller!

Its enormous, powerful body was covered in hard scales, and its cold, piercing eyes locked onto Scholar Song and the others.

“A dinosaur!” Gao's eyes widened in disbelief.

“It looks more like a lizard, just much larger?” Tu Bo, clearly more familiar with reptiles, swallowed hard.

“Zss!” The enormous creature, around fourteen meters high, flicked its tongue, its massive eyes turning toward Scholar Song and his group.

The scene was reminiscent of a lizard feasting on ants... and right now, Scholar Song and his companions were those unfortunate little ants.

Scholar Song swallowed hard. At such a size, even if he exerted all his strength to unleash 'Palm Thunder,' he wouldn't be able to take it down. Fourteen meters—it was a daunting size that filled him with despair.

He silently tightened his grip on his treasured sword, hoping it could penetrate the giant lizard's defenses.

Just as Scholar Song prepared for a desperate fight...

Suddenly... the towering lizard before him began to shrink at a visible speed.

From a height of fourteen meters, it quickly diminished to the size of a tree, then continued to shrink until it vanished from sight!

“???” Scholar Song was left with a row of question marks in his mind. What is happening here?

“An optical illusion?” Mei Yi whispered.

The others nodded in unison, seemingly realizing that only this explanation could account for the giant lizard's sudden transformation and disappearance.

“Regardless of what it is... I feel we should make a dash for the ancient city while we can,” Scholar Song said, swallowing again.

“Agreed.”

“I think so too.” The passengers behind them, clearly shaken by the earlier spectacle, suddenly felt a surge of strength in their legs, which had grown weak after the long trek.

Potential is like a woman's allure; with a little squeeze, it will always come forth.

“He’s not that kind of rigid do-gooder.”

“Then let’s meet him first in the ancient city.”
