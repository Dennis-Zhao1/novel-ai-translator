**Survived Another Day!**

Around noon, Scholar Song received a phone call from an agent assigned by the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain. The agent was responsible for delivering various models of cars to an underground parking lot near Jiangnan University Town.

After confirming that Scholar Song was home, the agent hurried over to his place with an enthusiastic attitude. It's true that money can make even the toughest tasks seem easy!

After that, the agent drove Scholar Song and Venerable White to the underground parking lot.

Doudou wasn't interested in joining Scholar Song this time; it decided to stay home. Since there was a disciple from the Empty Thief Sect, the Young Master Sugar, staying behind, Doudou could have some fun interrogating him to pass the time.

Scholar Song carefully helped Venerable White into the car, afraid he might suddenly get in the mood to dismantle the vehicle.

Feeling uncomfortable under Scholar Song's watchful gaze, Venerable White said, “You don't need to look at me like that; I won’t break the car. Just trust me a little!”

Scholar Song sheepishly scratched his head.

……

The trip was smooth sailing.

Upon arriving at the underground parking lot, the agent handed the keys to Scholar Song.

The entire parking lot had been rented out by the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain. It was a small facility that could hold over fifty cars, and the Immortal Sage was preparing to fill it to the brim.

“Hello, Mr. Scholar Song. Please confirm that this is the first batch of thirteen cars, each fully fueled and inspected, with no issues before being delivered here. Here’s the vehicle style list and contract ordered by Mr. Huang Wenzhong; please check it over and sign if everything looks good, so I can report back to Mr. Huang,” the agent said with a bright smile.

Huang Wenzhong, of course, was the modern name used by the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain. It probably wasn’t his real name…

The thirteen cars came in various styles.

Some were worth millions, while others were more modestly priced. The agent couldn’t fathom why this young man needed so many different cars. The thinking of the wealthy was beyond his understanding.

But that was fine; money speaks volumes. If the customer wanted to buy several million-dollar cars, even adding a rickshaw wouldn’t faze him. As long as he got a decent commission, he could buy the prettiest rickshaw himself.

“If you find any problems with the vehicles, feel free to contact me. I’ll make sure to handle it properly,” the agent promised, patting his chest confidently.

Scholar Song took the purchase contract and compared it with the thirteen cars in the garage.

After confirming everything was in order, he nodded and signed each contract.

Suddenly, a realization hit him—wait a minute… all these cars are now registered under my name! The Immortal Sage just directly put all these vehicles in my name.

What if someone reports me for possessing “illegitimate property”? Scholar Song thought sarcastically, but of course, with the Immortal Sage handling things, such issues would surely be avoided.

After Scholar Song confirmed and signed the contracts, the agent handed over all the car keys and reminded him, “These are the keys to the thirteen cars. According to Mr. Huang’s instructions, once all the vehicles are delivered, the security will be your responsibility, Mr. Scholar Song. Is that alright?”

“We’ll handle the security ourselves,” Venerable White said, a mischievous glint in his eye, clearly eager to get started.

“Alright, when the next batch of cars arrives, I’ll contact you again, Mr. Scholar Song.” The agent’s service was impeccable.

Once all the paperwork was completed, he bid farewell to Scholar Song and Venerable White and drove off—he still needed to confirm everything with Mr. Huang.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

“Venerable White, let me take you for a spin first; you can see how the driving techniques work,” Scholar Song suggested.

“Sure, sounds good! I downloaded the traffic rules, driving tips, and techniques online. Besides, I have a driver’s license, so it should be fine!” Venerable White replied with a smile.

“……” Scholar Song thought to himself.

Venerable White, that license must have been obtained through some dubious means by the Master of Snow Wolf Cavern!

Once in the car, Scholar Song began explaining, “Insert the key and turn it to start. This vehicle is a traditional model; some newer cars don’t even require a key to start, but I’ll explain that another time.”

Scholar Song deliberately chose a car similar to the one he had learned to drive in, as he too was still a novice. He went on to explain how to control the steering wheel, brakes, accelerator, clutch, and other functions…

Venerable White listened attentively, showing a keen desire to learn.

After exiting the garage, Scholar Song pressed the button to close the garage door.

Then, he took Venerable White for a drive around the area, eventually making their way to “Shuishi Road.”

This newly constructed road was in a less populated area, with few vehicles and pedestrians—perfect for a beginner to practice.

“How’s it going, Venerable White?” Scholar Song parked the car, pulled up the handbrake, and asked.

“Hmm, this transportation method is quite simple; I think I’ll catch on quickly,” Venerable White nodded. “By the way, you were driving too slowly. We were only going thirty or forty mph!”

“I’m also a beginner,” Scholar Song chuckled awkwardly. This was only his second time driving on the road, aside from the instructor’s car.

Venerable White, brimming with excitement, suggested, “Let me give it a try!”

They switched seats, and Venerable White mimicked Scholar Song’s actions, starting the car and accelerating without any trouble.

After all, with his abilities and reflexes, even if he made a mistake, he could correct it in a split second.

Smoothly accelerating and expertly changing lanes, Venerable White had completely mastered driving after just one look.

“It’s easy! Where should we go next?” Venerable White asked.

“Anywhere you like, Venerable,” Scholar Song replied.

“Alright then, hold on tight!” Venerable White pressed the gas, and the car sped up rapidly.

“Watch the speed limit, Venerable White!” Scholar Song called out anxiously.

“Don’t worry, I’m keeping an eye on it. I’ve memorized the traffic rules... And even if I lose points, it’s no big deal; the Master of Snow Wolf can just arrange for me to get another license!” Venerable White said confidently.

The first part of his statement eased Scholar Song’s worry a bit, but the latter half sent his heart racing.

Fortunately, Venerable White mostly obeyed the rules, keeping things relatively safe.

After driving for a while, Venerable White suddenly found a spot to pull over and crouched beside the car, drawing something.

“What are you doing, Venerable?” Scholar Song asked curiously.

“I’m sketching three formations—an invisibility formation, a soundproofing formation, and a ‘hidden energy’ formation for counter-surveillance. Once I finish, our car will be invisible and won’t be detected by anyone or any devices,” Venerable White explained.

“Why hide the car?” Scholar Song blurted out, then immediately realized what was going on. “Wait, Venerable, are you planning to race?”

“Hehe, I’m just not used to the slow pace,” Venerable White said, brushing his hands together. “All done.”

He hopped back into the car, restarted the engine, and with a slam on the gas, they took off.

The roar of the vehicle surged forward, quickly exceeding one hundred mph.

The speed kept climbing, and in no time, the needle was at the maximum.

Scholar Song was pale with fear.

“This is still too slow,” Venerable White said, looking unsatisfied.

Then, he glanced at the charm hanging from Scholar Song’s wrist—it was the artifact left behind by the sunflower cultivator after his death. Scholar Song wore the ‘Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl’ around his neck, which he had tied to his wrist.

“Hehe.” Venerable White reached over and lightly tapped the charm on Scholar Song’s wrist.

“Speeding Up!”

The charm activated, and Venerable White cast the spell on the car.

In the next moment, Scholar Song felt the vehicle break through some sort of limit.

The surrounding scenery whizzed by.

Venerable White skillfully maneuvered the steering wheel, weaving through traffic and overtaking cars…

……

“Hey, what’s that station up ahead?” Venerable White suddenly pointed out as they approached a platform with a line of waiting cars.

“The highway entrance... we need to stop to pay a toll,” Scholar Song explained.

“Hehe, we don’t have to pay! We’re invisible right now!” Venerable White declared, slapping the car lightly. “Levitation Technique!”

In the next instant, the car soared into the air, leaping over the tall toll station and onto the highway.

“Wow, this is even more exhilarating!” Venerable White laughed heartily.

Scholar Song leaned back in the seat, vaguely hearing the car make a sound that resembled it was about to fall apart.

The race continued…

……

Five minutes later.

“Ha ha ha! Go faster! Go faster! Huh... what?” Suddenly, Venerable White’s cheerful voice stopped.

“What happened?” Scholar Song turned to look.

He saw Venerable White holding the steering wheel, which was completely normal. The problem was that Venerable White’s upper body had turned halfway toward Scholar Song in the passenger seat, and he was holding the steering wheel, which had come off!

With an innocent expression, Venerable White looked at Scholar Song. “I got too excited earlier and twisted the wheel too hard, and it broke…”

“Hit the brakes! Quick, hit the brakes!” Scholar Song shouted.

“Ahaha, well, I think the brakes broke before we got on the highway,” Venerable White said with a chuckle, looking a bit embarrassed.

“We’re going to crash! We’re going to crash!” Scholar Song pointed at the guardrail ahead.

“Don’t worry, I’ve got this! Levitation Technique!” Venerable White shouted again.

“Don’t! Venerable, that’s a cliff!” Scholar Song yelled.

But it was too late; the car had already jumped high and plummeted off the cliff, looking incredibly stylish.

……

Five minutes later.

Scholar Song groggily crawled out of the wreckage of the car, rubbing his face. Falling from such a high cliff, he wasn’t hurt at all—must be thanks to Venerable White’s protection.

Where’s Venerable White?

Looking around, he quickly spotted Venerable White digging around in a bamboo grove at the bottom of the cliff.

“Ha ha, not bad! Two bamboo shoots. Here, you can have one, Scholar Song. These have the ability to clear the nose and enhance the sense of smell. Since you’re trying to break through to the ‘Nasal Aperture’ realm, eating one will be very beneficial,” Venerable White tossed a purple bamboo shoot to Scholar Song.

Scholar Song caught the treasure with a confused expression—was Venerable White’s inexplicable good fortune acting up again?

……

At the same time, in the Ninefold Land group chat.

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain: “Scholar Song, I heard you want to learn to fly an airplane? Since North River isn’t around, I’ll arrange something for you!”
