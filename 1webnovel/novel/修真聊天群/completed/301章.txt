**Chapter Fragment**

"Are you interested in learning about Heavenly Isle?" 

The tone and demeanor of Uncle Monster Version 002 were strikingly similar to the earlier creepy uncle who had teased Zhuge Yue. 

As soon as Zhuge Zhongyang heard the voice of Uncle Monster 002, a wave of goosebumps washed over him. "Uncle, I'm not into that sort of thing!" 

"Don't worry, my dear. I've got plenty of experience and will make you feel very comfortable. With your unique constitution as a furnace, I can make a breakthrough and ascend to the second tier realm in one go!" Uncle Monster 002's taste was even more terrifying than Version 001's. 

Was there a script that all members of their sect followed? How could the content be so similar to that of Uncle Monster 001? 

"Don't come any closer! If you do, I'll bite my tongue off!" Zhuge Zhongyang shouted defiantly. 

"Relax, sweet baby. You’d look delicious even without a tongue," Uncle Monster 002 grinned wickedly.

At that moment, Zhuge Zhongyang felt as if death itself was looming over him!

"Look, it's right ahead," Jiu Deng pointed towards the unsettling scene before them and said to Scholar Song. 

Scholar Song sighed, secretly drawing out his treasured sword, the Blade of Destruction. Thankfully, he had arrived just in time; it seemed Zhuge Zhongyang's virtue was still intact.

With a burst of speed, he charged towards Uncle Monster 002. 

Sensing something amiss, Uncle Monster 002, who was about to pounce on Zhuge Zhongyang, suddenly turned around, drawing out an iron rod to block behind him. 

Scholar Song gripped his sword firmly, not relying on flashy techniques nor invoking the Fire Blade. Instead, he executed a simple and heavy downward slash. The fundamentals of his swordplay were taught to him by Venerable White during their training in the Desert Mirage.

With a single stroke, the iron rod in Uncle Monster 002's hand collided with the Blade of Destruction. 

*Crack!*

In the next instant, the solid iron rod was easily severed as if it were made of bamboo! The blade’s momentum didn’t wane as it continued its arc towards Uncle Monster 002's head. 

"Treasure weapon?" Uncle Monster 002 screamed in shock. Though his iron rod was forged from fine steel, it had been effortlessly cut in half.

Realizing the danger, Uncle Monster 002 quickly abandoned his now-useless iron rod and rolled away to avoid Scholar Song's downward strike. 

As he rolled, Uncle Monster 002 vanished from sight, entering an invisible state.

This was bad; he had missed the chance to take down his opponent and allowed Uncle Monster 002 to go invisible. The situation had turned grim for Scholar Song! 

"Scholar Song!" Zhuge Zhongyang exclaimed with surprise upon seeing him.

“Shh,” Scholar Song gestured for Zhuge Zhongyang to remain still.

He couldn’t see Uncle Monster 002… not even his spiritual sense could detect him. After Uncle Monster 002 had gone invisible, even his scent was hidden.

What a sophisticated invisibility technique! With sight and smell rendered useless… was hearing the only option left?

Scholar Song decided to close his eyes, attempting to heighten his hearing to the max. Once he opened his ear orifices, he could hear the slightest rustling nearby. Even with the invisibility technique, the opponent must disturb the grass and trees as they moved, allowing him to catch a glimpse of an opportunity.

Unfortunately, there was not even a whisper of sound.

The opponent's invisibility technique not only concealed them visually but also masked their scent and sound. It meant he was entirely in a passive situation; things couldn’t get worse!

Was there really no way to uncover this invisible foe?

Just as Scholar Song was pondering, the Phantom Spirit in his heart stirred slightly.

After forming a contract with Scholar Song, the Phantom Spirit had yet to fully synchronize with him. Complete synchronization would take time, and Scholar Song couldn’t rush it.

Now, as thoughts crossed his mind, the Phantom Spirit unexpectedly emerged from his heart. It floated above Scholar Song, gazing down at the ground.

The next moment, the vision of the Phantom Spirit synced with Scholar Song’s.

Through the Phantom Spirit's sight, Scholar Song spotted a ghostly figure creeping up on his right side.

The figure was surrounded by a layer of black mist, which concealed its presence, eliminating any hint of its aura and sound. This was a form resembling a 'ghostly entity.'

Scholar Song’s Phantom Spirit was perfectly positioned to see this form.

Uncle Monster 002 crept closer to Scholar Song, extending a bony hand like a claw.

In this shroud of black mist, his body appeared to change, looking less human and more like a creature of the night. He grinned maliciously, his ghostly claw aimed straight for Scholar Song's heart, ready to rip it out.

In that instant, Scholar Song spun around, wielding the sharp Blade of Destruction in a horizontal slice.

Uncle Monster 002, caught off guard, was cleaved cleanly in two.

“How did you discover me?” he shrieked.

Moreover, where he had been cut, instead of blood splattering, a cloud of black mist erupted, merging back into the surrounding gloom.

Before long, Uncle Monster 002's remaining body was consumed by the encroaching black mist.

"You dare to kill me! I curse you! In the name of a disciple of the Nine Nether Realm, I curse you with the filth of the Nine Nether, may you fall forever into the abyss!" Uncle Monster 002 screamed, his voice filled with anguish.

From the ghostly mist surrounding him, a curse talisman squeezed out, soaring towards Scholar Song. This was a curse ability that could be activated upon death while in the ghostly mist state.

No one liked curses. Scholar Song quickly retreated, trying to evade the talisman. 

Just then, the Phantom Spirit dove from above, swallowing the curse talisman whole. Then, with a satisfied burp, it retreated back into Scholar Song's heart.

It could even devour curses? It seemed like the appetite of his Phantom Spirit was growing!

---

"Is it over?" Zhuge Zhongyang asked weakly.

He couldn’t see the fallen Uncle Monster 002, but upon noticing that Scholar Song had relaxed his guard, he cautiously inquired.

“For now, yes," Scholar Song nodded. "But there’s still one more strange individual after the remaining two passengers, so it’s not entirely resolved.”

Moreover, the origins of these weird uncles seemed suspicious.

The Nine Nether Realm and their ghostly forms—were these three really human?

Scholar Song turned his gaze towards Master Jiu Deng, casting a questioning look her way.

“Want to know about the Nine Nether Realm?” Master Jiu Deng narrowed her eyes and smiled. It was as if she was eager to explain what the 'Nine Nether Realm' was to him.

Could it be that Master Jiu Deng aimed to entangle him with this 'Nine Nether Realm'?

“No, I'm not interested,” Scholar Song quickly replied through gritted teeth. 

“Oh? Not interested? Hehe, alright then, if you’re not interested, I won’t force you. It’s not a good place anyway,” Master Jiu Deng chuckled. “But are you interested in learning about what Heavenly Isle is like?”
