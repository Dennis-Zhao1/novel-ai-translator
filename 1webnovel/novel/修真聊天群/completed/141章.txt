**Ten Million in Phone Credit, Are You Scared?**

“You guys shouldn’t say that! Who knows, maybe after closing himself off for so long, Immortal Sage of White Mountain will suddenly become handy with his skills and his insatiable curiosity will decrease? Besides, airplanes aren’t that easy to break, right?” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain declared with conviction.

At this moment, the True Monarch of Ancient Lake replied with a sneer, “Heh, Elder Yellow Mountain, tell me honestly, do you believe what you just said?”

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain was left speechless by the retort—sorry, I was just talking nonsense a moment ago!

“And compared to mechanisms and magical tools, airplanes are much more fragile. I bet ten custom talismans that if Immortal Sage of White Mountain boards a plane, he will definitely crash!” The Master of Seven Life Talismans asserted firmly. His custom talismans meant that no matter what kind of talisman it was, as long as he could make it, it would certainly meet his requirements!

“A free alchemy opportunity, four times!” The Alchemical Sage chimed in, seeming unusually quick to speak today. Was Jiang Ziyan sending messages for him again?

“Free fortune-telling opportunity, ten times!” At this moment, a guy with the ID “Iron Diviner” gloated.

Wait, Iron Diviner? Who is that?

Oh my, that's the alternate account of the Copper Diviner! How long has this alternate account been lurking in the group without being discovered?

Now that the Copper Diviner's main account has been silenced, his alternate account finally made an appearance.

Hermit of North River: “…”

Wild Blade of Three Tides: “…”

“I feel like I won’t be asking for your fortune-telling, it’ll ruin my mood!” said Hermit of North River.

“Same here,” Wild Blade of Three Tides maintained the consensus.

“Me too,” added the Alchemical Sage.

Iron Diviner fumed, “Enough of this already!”

[System Notification: (********) Iron Diviner has been muted by group leader Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain for 30 days.]

Who’s really had enough? Do you think I’m just a decoration as the group leader? Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain snorted.

However, he didn’t kick this account out of the group because it wasn’t merely the alternate account of the Copper Diviner—this was his disciple’s account! That disciple had been lurking silently, and today was borrowed by the Copper Diviner to chat.

“Anyway, you all really shouldn’t keep badmouthing Immortal Sage of White Mountain. If this continues, you’ll frighten our young friend Scholar Song. If he refuses to meet with Immortal Sage of White Mountain, then I’ll have you all draw lots to see who has to welcome him!” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain threatened.

Everyone in the group fell silent, not daring to speak further.

After a moment, the Hermit of North River noticed that Scholar Song hadn’t responded for a while and asked, “Has our young friend Scholar Song not replied? Is he offline? I just saw him post pictures in the group space, he can’t be pretending not to see, right?”

“He was just on the phone with me. I even asked him to call me back later to see if he managed to get the ‘Blood God Diamond.’ I’ll call him back now,” the Master of Seven Life Talismans added with a smiley.

Soon after, he chimed in again, “Haha, Scholar Song’s phone must be out of credit… he probably ran out of balance during our call. Unfortunately, I'm not in Huaxia, so the phone credit is quite expensive. Hmm, we need to remind him to keep his credit topped up, or it’ll be tough to reach him in emergencies. By the way, who’s free to help top up Scholar Song’s phone credit?”

“Online, you can only recharge a maximum of one thousand at a time, it’s too much hassle. I wonder how much Scholar Song is in debt?” the Hermit of North River said.

At this moment, the presence of Zuiyue Jushi popped up in the chat: “I’m currently resting at a resort, and there’s a mobile service center nearby. If you give me Scholar Song’s number, I’ll recharge it for him, so he won’t have to worry about phone credit anymore.”

As he spoke, it felt like a wave of boldness washed over everyone!

“I’ll send you his number,” the Hermit of North River quickly shared Scholar Song’s contact.

“Wait here, I’ll go top him up,” Zuiyue Jushi said before going silent.

Then the Hermit of North River added, “Let’s quickly flood the chat. We need to push up the discussion about ‘Immortal Sage of White Mountain’ before Scholar Song returns, or else he’ll open the group and see us talking about Immortal Sage and might just throw in the towel, and that would be troublesome.”

“Fair point, let’s spam the chat. What should we talk about?”

“Let’s discuss what Three Tides discovered on the Mysterious Island!”

The seniors in the group shamelessly started chatting, and in no time, they had sent thousands of messages, pushing the records about ‘Immortal Sage of White Mountain’ to the ends of the earth…

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile…

Su Clan’s Aqi, along with Scholar Song, Sable Sixteen, and Zhengde, arrived over the Immortal Farmer Sect.

From their high vantage point, they witnessed the scene below, where disciples of the Immortal Farmer Sect were weeping bitterly.

What major event had unfolded in the Immortal Farmer Sect upon their return? Aqi looked closely and saw the body of the sect leader, decapitated by a blade!

Something had indeed gone wrong.

Su Clan’s Aqi gently patted Zhengde to rouse him from his stupor.

Zhengde opened his eyes, drowsily gazing at the sorrowful scene unfolding below. As soon as he caught sight of the sect leader’s corpse, he froze in shock.

Below, the disciples of the Immortal Farmer Sect were sobbing, some sharing their grief with one another.

The disciples had completely lost their anchor. Even if the sect leader had died, they could still follow their senior brother ‘Zhengneng.’ But now that Senior Brother Zhengneng had killed the sect leader and left the Immortal Farmer Sect, what were they supposed to do next?

Zhengde listened blankly to the disciples’ lamentations while standing on Su Clan’s Aqi’s light. He pieced together the events that had transpired after the ‘Moonblade Sect Battle.’

Senior Brother killed the master, then betrayed the sect, leaving with Young Master Hai?

Why? How could this happen?!

After a long pause…

Zhengde gritted his teeth, determination flashing across his face: “Aqi, I ask you to let me down.”

Aqi looked at him in surprise: “Have you made up your mind? Do you know what you’re doing?”

“I don’t know, but I have to return to the Immortal Farmer Sect. Someone has to stand up for the sect now; otherwise, it will be finished,” Zhengde said with a bitter smile.

Aqi thought for a moment and tossed a token to Zhengde: “Take this with you and place it in the Immortal Farmer Sect. Its presence will signify that I, Su Clan’s Aqi, am protecting the Immortal Farmer Sect. At least it will deter some petty thieves from taking advantage of the chaos. When you feel the sect has weathered this storm, return the token to the Su Clan.”

“Thank you.” Zhengde accepted the token—at this point, he couldn’t afford to refuse. He needed this token, and the Immortal Farmer Sect needed this token. Refusal was not an option!

Su Clan’s Aqi gently waved his hand, safely lowering Zhengde to the ground.

When the disciples of the Immortal Farmer Sect saw Zhengde descend from the sky, many of their eyes lit up. Although Zhengde’s strength was not high, he had immense popularity within the sect.

As he faced the approaching brothers and sisters, Zhengde tightly clutched the token, taking a deep breath before stepping forward to greet the disciples of the Immortal Farmer Sect!

…

…

Su Clan’s Aqi stood behind, gazing down from above for a long time, finally whispering: “Let’s go.”

Aqi felt responsible for the calamity that had befallen the Immortal Farmer Sect, so he granted this token to help the sect weather the storm. However, during this incident, Zhengde had once thought to harm Sable Sixteen, so besides the token, Aqi didn’t offer any further assistance.

With a flash of light, he took Scholar Song and Sable Sixteen toward the Jiangnan University City.

Scholar Song took one last look at the Immortal Farmer Sect, his heart filled with countless emotions, yet he couldn’t find the right words to express it all and could only bury those feelings deep within.

In the future, this incident involving the Immortal Farmer Sect would become a significant chapter in his life, enriching his path.

…

…

On their way back, Su Clan’s Aqi remained silent for a long time before suddenly saying, “Sixteen, come back with me to the Su Clan today. Your injuries can indeed be treated.”

“Mm.” Sable Sixteen replied softly.

“Don’t overthink it. Just leave everything to me. Trust me, Sixteen, you will be just fine.” Su Clan’s Aqi reassured her.

“Mm, I’ve always believed in you. I just… needed to clear my mind a little,” Sable Sixteen smiled brightly. Her beauty was already exquisite, and this smile was truly enchanting, like a hundred flowers blooming.

Soon, Su Clan’s Aqi had guided his light to soar above Jiangnan University City.

“Scholar Song, I can’t thank you enough for today,” Aqi said, patting Scholar Song firmly.

If not for Scholar Song, Sable Sixteen might have been killed by the scum of the Moonblade Sect. Just thinking about it made Aqi feel a wave of fear. In his excitement, he had patted a little too hard, nearly knocking the breath out of Scholar Song.

Scholar Song coughed repeatedly, smiling wryly.

Sable Sixteen sighed and gently patted Scholar Song’s back, helping ease his coughing.

“Cough, I originally planned to give you a gift to commemorate our meeting. But now, I can’t present it at all,” Su Clan’s Aqi laughed.

He had intended to give Scholar Song a set of ‘First Grade’ martial arts as a meeting gift. But now that Scholar Song had saved Sable Sixteen multiple times, presenting a mere First Grade martial arts as a gift would just be laughed at by their peers!

“So, I’ll save this gift for another time. In the future, when the Snow Fairy prepares to host the ‘Feast of Immortal Delicacies,’ I’ll take you along to taste the true ‘deliciousness’ and ‘immortal treasures’ of this world. I think that would be enough to show my sincerity, right?” Su Clan’s Aqi smiled.

“Snow Fairy?” Scholar Song was confused—was it just a good meal?

At this moment, Sable Sixteen gently nudged Scholar Song, giving him a meaningful look.

“Alright! Then I’ll thank Elder Aqi in advance!” Scholar Song expressed his gratitude—was this Feast of Immortal Delicacies really that beneficial?

“Then we shall part ways here.” Aqi nodded in satisfaction, gently lifting his right hand to support Scholar Song, placing him in a secluded artificial forest where no one could see.

…

…

“Today, I’ve survived another day.” Scholar Song sighed and then took out his phone to check.

Speaking of which, he was out of credit and needed to recharge—let’s see how much he owes!

Just then, his phone suddenly received a text message.

It was from the mobile provider: “Dear customer, hello. On June 10th, you successfully recharged 10,000,000.00 yuan. Your current available balance is 9,999,784.31 yuan. Reply with 1 to check your real-time balance information… [Huaxia Mobile Notification Service].”

Scholar Song rubbed his eyes, one, two, three… seven, seven zeros?!

Ten million! In phone credit?

Has Huaxia Mobile finally crashed?
