**Supersonic Helicopter!**

Flight instructor Xiao Li felt a strange sensation—like he and the two other instructors were in completely different worlds. Their minds seemed to be operating on entirely different wavelengths!

“Scholar Song!” the Venerable White said sharply, his gaze piercing and serious. “It doesn't matter whether it’s a provocation or not! The path of cultivation is fraught with difficulties, like rowing upstream; if you don’t advance, you’ll fall back! Therefore, on the path of cultivation, we must never fall behind! So no matter what, we can’t lag behind!”

Senior, what you’re saying makes so much sense... but isn’t this just some wisdom related to cultivation? How does it relate to the fact that the other party is soaring away with their sword while we’re stuck here? And besides, Instructor Xiao Li is right next to us. Isn’t it a bit too brazen to discuss practitioner matters so openly?

As these thoughts raced through his mind, Scholar Song glanced over at Instructor Xiao Li, who wore a completely bewildered expression, occasionally digging at his ears. Soon after, his face turned pale.

“Uh-oh.” Scholar Song suddenly realized—Instructor Xiao Li was experiencing soundproofing from the Venerable White!

At this moment, Instructor Xiao Li could see the Venerable White's lips moving but couldn't hear a single sound.

No, it wasn't just the instructor's voice; he couldn't hear the helicopter's rotor blades spinning either.

What’s going on? What’s happening?

Panic set in for Instructor Xiao Li as he frantically dug at his ears, but he still couldn’t hear anything.

He slapped his face hard, but even the sound of that was absent.

Am I deaf?

Why? Just a minute ago, everything was fine. Why am I suddenly deaf?

Instructor Xiao Li tried to recall what had happened just moments before, but… nothing came to mind.

Don't panic; stay calm.

As an excellent flight instructor, Xiao Li had a big heart. Could it be that I’m dreaming?

He pinched his thigh hard… Ouch, this isn’t a nightmare!

Instructor Xiao Li’s face grew even paler.

After a while, he sighed—thank God, I’ll never have to hear the dull roar of the helicopter blades again… because I’m completely deaf!

—Being deaf means I can’t continue being a flight instructor. I’ll have to say goodbye to this high-paying job and find another path!

Perhaps the only silver lining is that before this flight, he had received a hefty payment? But that hardly made him happy.

Just as Instructor Xiao Li spiraled into anxious thoughts, the Venerable White had already begun to take action.

With one hand controlling the helicopter and the other drawing intricate designs in the air, he was sketching out a complex formation—far more advanced than the one he had inscribed on the car a few days ago.

The more this happened, the more uneasy Scholar Song felt.

He knew there was no convincing the Venerable White now.

“Venerable White, please be gentle when we speed up the helicopter. And don’t forget, there’s an ordinary person beside you.” Scholar Song glanced at Instructor Xiao Li—Instructor, this is as far as I can help you.

“Don’t worry, even if the helicopter falls apart, this instructor won’t have any issues! I assure you, he’ll be fine; I’m a seventh-grade Spirit Venerable, after all.” The Venerable White laughed heartily, giving a thumbs-up. “Afterwards, I’ll erase his memory, and he won’t remember anything that happened during this time! He won’t be psychologically affected at all; it’ll be absolutely fine!”

Scholar Song quietly rubbed his chest—wow, my heart is racing.

But this time, it wasn’t because of the charm of the Venerable White; it was because the phrase “if the helicopter falls apart” made him envision various airplane disaster scenes from movies.

This helicopter, it can’t really fall apart, right?

“Haha, done! This is a new formation I’ve been working on recently, combining ‘invisibility, soundproofing, energy leakage prevention, and counter-detection.’ With this, the helicopter won’t be seen by ordinary people, nor will it be detected by radar or other reconnaissance systems. Hahaha.” The Venerable White declared proudly.

How terrifying! When did the Venerable White secretly develop this new formation?

Then, the Venerable White began sketching a second formation on the helicopter.

As he drew, he explained, “Next, we’ll create a super-acceleration formation. This is an upgraded version based on your ‘Breeze Acceleration Pendant’. After my modifications, this formation can achieve up to ten times the speed. Impressive, isn’t it?”

Ten times the speed?

What kind of dangerous thing is the Venerable White researching?!

Scholar Song mentally calculated—private helicopters used at flight schools aren’t very fast, averaging around 150 to 170 kilometers per hour.

If we multiply that by ten, that’s 1500 to 1700 kilometers per hour.

Now, converting that to supersonic speed, which is about 1224 kilometers per hour.

In other words… if the Venerable White pushes the formation to its limit at ten times the speed, this ordinary helicopter could break the sound barrier and enter a ‘supersonic’ state—if this poor helicopter’s structure is robust enough to withstand it?

It seems like falling apart is the only outcome.

Unless the Venerable White intends to add a formation to reinforce the helicopter’s structure.

However, the Venerable White didn’t seem to have any intention of reinforcing the helicopter. Once he finished the modified Breeze Acceleration formation, he casually concluded the formation drawing.

“Time to accelerate!” The Venerable White then pushed the helicopter’s throttle, skillfully ramping up the helicopter’s speed to its maximum.

Instructor Xiao Li, now in a panic, couldn’t hear anything, but he wasn’t blind.

Through the helicopter’s instrument panel, he watched the speed skyrocketing, quickly reaching 170 kilometers per hour.

The helicopter’s rotor blades spun furiously, and the body emitted a creaking sound as if it couldn’t bear the strain.

“We can’t do this! Scholar Song, we can’t reach this speed during the test flight! Slow down! We can’t fly ahead like this… we need to turn back. If we fly chaotically and accidentally enter a ‘no-fly zone’, we’ll be finished!” Instructor Xiao Li shouted.

Heaven knows what would happen if they entered a no-fly zone? You might just get a free trial of anti-air missiles, sending you back for a reincarnation.

“Don’t worry; everything will be fine!” The Venerable White gave a thumbs-up to Instructor Xiao Li! With him around, no one would discover this helicopter.

As he spoke, the Venerable White began channeling his spiritual energy into the helicopter’s formations.

The three-in-one invisibility formation activated, and this ordinary helicopter instantaneously transformed into a high-end ‘invisible aircraft’.

True invisibility—ordinary people couldn’t see it, nor could they hear it. Whether it was radar or more advanced anti-air detection equipment, they couldn’t detect its existence.

Then, the Venerable White channeled spiritual energy into the ‘enhanced Breeze Acceleration formation’.

“Acceleration activated!”

The helicopter, which had already reached its limits, sped up even more. The creaking sounds grew louder.

Instructor Xiao Li couldn’t hear the sound, but he saw on the instrument panel that the flight speed had exceeded the limit. He could still clearly feel that the helicopter was still accelerating.

What’s going on? What’s happening?

He stared in confusion at the Venerable White, who appeared calm, a hint of excitement in his eyes, showing no signs of distress.

Then he turned back to look at Scholar Song, who was bundled up in his ‘space suit.’

Through the transparent face shield, he could see Scholar Song’s wry smile as he shrugged at him.

So something is going on? Is this space suit Scholar Song is wearing meant for situations like this?

“Scholar Song, we need to turn back and land!” Instructor Xiao Li turned to the Venerable White, calling out.

Regardless of what was happening, they needed to turn back—it was best to land at the flight school’s airport first.

The Venerable White shook his head, refusing the request.

Damn! Instructor Xiao Li gritted his teeth, preparing to forcibly take control of the helicopter to land it himself.

Just then, the Venerable White lightly pointed at him.

In an instant, Instructor Xiao Li felt his body go limp, sinking back into his seat. It was as if he had been immobilized, unable to move below his neck. All he could do was stare blankly at the instruments and the scenery outside.

Oh, I can still turn my head to admire the Venerable White’s beauty?

What’s happening? What’s going on?

Instructor Xiao Li’s brain began to short-circuit. Even with his strong heart, facing a supernatural method that seemed to come straight out of a martial arts film, he could only falter.

……

“Too slow, too slow!” the Venerable White murmured to himself. At this rate, they wouldn’t catch up to the little guy who had just provoked them while riding his flying sword. If they lost track of him, it would be so embarrassing!

“Scholar Song, get ready; we’re going straight to ten times the speed!” the Venerable White declared.

Scholar Song immediately gripped the helicopter tightly, his entire being tense. At the same time, he cautiously observed Instructor Xiao Li’s condition, hoping he could be of help at a crucial moment.

At that moment, the Venerable White poured vast amounts of spiritual energy into the formation, forcing the speed up to ten times.

In an instant, this ordinary helicopter’s speed was thrust to a supersonic level of 1500 kilometers per hour.

Then, a stunning sonic boom cloud formed around the helicopter.

What a beautiful sonic boom cloud, Instructor Xiao Li thought to himself.

No, wait! A sonic boom cloud?

Am I seeing things?

Instructor Xiao Li stared blankly at this scene, one he had only seen in flight videos.

Breaking the sound barrier and achieving supersonic flight was a dream many speed-seeking pilots yearned for.

Still young, Instructor Xiao Li had fantasized about the day his aircraft would break the sound barrier and enter supersonic flight.

Today, it seemed like that wish was coming true.

But how is this possible? This is supersonic flight!

How could a helicopter achieve supersonic speed? This is unscientific… I must be hallucinating, right?

Moreover, if an ordinary helicopter really broke the sound barrier, then terrifying problems would arise.

Suddenly, the helicopter emitted a sound of breaking apart; the first to go was the rotor on top, snapping clean off… but this was just the beginning of the disaster.
