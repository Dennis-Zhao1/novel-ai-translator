**If...**

The school dormitory is a peculiar place. The girls' dormitory is strictly off-limits for boys; any boy daring to cross the threshold would face dire consequences. However, the boys' dormitory is like a playground for girls, open for them to enter and exit as they please. Thus, Scholar Song had no trouble bringing a girl back to his dorm.

With it being a Sunday, most students had either gone out to unwind or were holed up in their dorms playing video games. When Scholar Song returned to his dorm with Fay Yu, they didn’t attract much attention at all.

His dorm was located on the second floor. Although there was an elevator, the residents typically preferred to take the stairs. After all, it was only one floor up, and the stairs were much quicker.

“Do you need help with your suitcase?” Scholar Song asked, glancing at Fay Yu as she struggled with her large suitcase. As a gentleman, offering to help a lady with her bags was simply the right thing to do.

“Thanks, it would be a big help!” Fay Yu replied, giving a shy smile as she nudged the heavy suitcase towards him.

As they made their way up, Scholar Song noticed how Fay Yu managed the suitcase effortlessly. In fact, at times when they passed over uneven pavement, she would even lift it slightly, looking so relaxed!

Naturally, he assumed the suitcase was only half-full and wouldn’t weigh too much.

But when his hand grasped the suitcase handle, and he pulled upward with all his might, his face flushed a bright red!

He barely managed to lift it a little; the suitcase must weigh at least fifty or sixty kilograms—close to the weight of an adult man!

His eyes widened as he stared at Fay Yu, who had delicate, slender hands. This girl… was she secretly a female powerhouse? To carry around such a heavy load effortlessly without breaking a sweat?

How naïve of him to think she was an easy target for abduction! With her strength, anyone attempting to abduct her would need a coffin ready first.

“Scholar Song?” Fay Yu looked at him, puzzled.

“Cough! Let’s take the elevator,” he decided quickly—lifting this suitcase up the stairs was doable but would leave him completely drained.

“Oh,” Fay Yu nodded, seeming to understand. As someone who was well-mannered, she wouldn’t pry into matters that didn’t concern her. As a guest, she would follow the host’s lead.

The elevator ascended slowly, and there were hardly any other users at this time, so they didn’t have to wait long.

...

...

Their dorm was completely empty.

Typically, the roommates wouldn’t come back until around three or four in the afternoon, and sometimes not until the evening.

The dorm wasn’t large, housing four individuals. Despite its small size, it was well-equipped, with a bathroom, balcony, washing board, and a small kitchen.

“Let’s sit for a bit. Do you want something to drink?” Scholar Song offered as he powered on his computer, gesturing for Fay Yu to take a seat.

Fay Yu obediently sat down and replied, “Lingmai Bi Tea.”

“?” Scholar Song raised an eyebrow in confusion.

Lingmai Bi Tea? What on earth? A new drink? He had never heard of it before!

After a moment’s pause, he quickly remembered Fay Yu’s identity—the long-legged beauty in front of him was actually a deep-seated cultivator fantasy enthusiast!

That so-called Lingmai Bi Tea must be something conjured up by fellow fantasy fans in their group chats.

Scholar Song felt his liver begin to ache just thinking about it.

“I don’t have that here right now, but I do have orange juice, purified water, cola, and milk. Choose one,” he suggested, trying to avoid the nightmare of being asked for something like ‘Dragon Blood Tea’ or ‘Phoenix Essence.’

Fay Yu paused for a moment, surprised that he didn’t have Lingmai Bi Tea.

After all, Lingmai Bi Tea was the most commonly served tea for welcoming guests among cultivators. It contained a small amount of spiritual energy but had a rich fragrance and flavor that lingered long after. It was the most cost-effective tea for hosting guests. While it wasn’t as miraculous as a medicinal pill, it was immensely cheaper. Any cultivator worth their salt would consider it a staple!

Wait a minute! She suddenly realized something!

Scholar Song was living incognito, blending in with regular folks. Some seniors reportedly went into hiding among ordinary people every couple of hundred years to train their temperaments, experiencing life as an everyday person—this was called ‘mundane training’! While it wouldn’t enhance their abilities, it could clear their minds and strengthen their resolve!

“Could I please have some orange juice, Scholar?” Fay Yu asked with a sweet smile.

“Sure, just a moment.”

A moment later, Scholar Song poured a large glass of orange juice and handed it to her.

Fay Yu accepted the drink. “Thank you, Scholar.”

“Not at all,” he replied. She was a good girl—polite and kind, though perhaps a bit too immersed in her fantasies. He sat down at his computer and connected to the internet.

He skillfully opened the map application, entering “J City, Luoxin District.”

Before long, the map displayed Luoxin District's location in J City.

“I checked; it’s quite a distance from here to J City’s Luoxin District,” Scholar Song said.

Usually, taking a taxi from Jiangnan Airport to Luoxin District would take about five hours. However, Fay Yu had gone the wrong way. Thankfully, Jiangnan University Town and J City were adjacent, so she wasn’t entirely off track—just a detour.

Now, if she started from Jiangnan University Town, driving to Luoxin District in J City would take about three and a half hours, assuming no traffic issues. In reality, considering the poor road conditions, the trip would likely take around five hours.

Fay Yu leaned closer, her eyes widening as she saw the long distance. “Scholar, can a taxi even make it that far?”

“It can, but you probably won’t find many willing drivers,” Scholar Song explained.

He continued to clarify that a five-hour trip was quite long. While taxis in nearby cities could operate across districts, most had set shifts.

And a ten-hour round trip would require several drivers, making it a challenge even for someone with deep pockets.

“What should we do then?” Fay Yu asked.

“Let’s take the high-speed train. There’s a station in the Black Elephant area not far from Luoxin District. There’s also a station nearby in the university town. The train is faster than a taxi and will get us there in no more than two hours,” Scholar Song suggested.

“When are we leaving?” Fay Yu’s eyes sparkled with excitement.

“No rush. We can book tickets online for today. I just checked, and the train leaves from the university town station at four o’clock. So we just need to be at the station by three-thirty to board,” Scholar Song explained.

Wait a minute!

When did we say ‘we’? 

This girl can't possibly think I’ll accompany her to J City’s Luoxin District, right?

I have classes tomorrow! I’m still a student and can’t just up and leave at the drop of a hat!

“So, Scholar, let’s book the tickets online quickly. Do I need my ID?” Fay Yu asked eagerly, delighted to have met such a helpful senior.

“Cough, cough, ‘we’?” Scholar Song coughed awkwardly again. “You mean we’re booking two tickets? You and I?”

“Ah? You’re not coming with me?” Fay Yu blinked, her face flushing red in embarrassment.

She had indeed gotten too carried away, subconsciously assuming Scholar Song would join her without even considering his opinion—how rude of her!

“Scholar, I was inconsiderate just now. I should have asked for your opinion first. Would you be able to accompany me to J City’s Luoxin District? I’m just… not great with directions, and I’m worried I won’t find the Gui Deng Temple,” Fay Yu implored.

Scholar Song sighed, gently turning her down. “I’d love to help, but I’m afraid I can’t.”

The train at four would get them there around six-thirty in the evening. He didn’t even know what Fay Yu needed to do there or how long it would take her. But one thing was for sure, he wouldn’t make it back by noon the next day.

And he had a class tomorrow afternoon!

Fay Yu looked crestfallen. She wore her emotions on her sleeve, and her disappointment was palpable. “Is it because you don’t have the time?”

“Yeah, I have class tomorrow afternoon,” Scholar Song replied.

Seeing her despondent expression, he suddenly wondered if he had been too harsh in his refusal. Would he hurt her fragile feelings?

With that thought in mind, he added, “If… I mean, if you’re not in too much of a rush, I could accompany you to J City next Friday. I’m still a student, and I only have weekends off.”

Next Friday? Fay Yu felt even more disheartened. While she could wait a day or two, five days felt too long. Although her dad loved to tease her, he wouldn’t mess around with the Wild Blade of Three Tides for ten days or more.

But suddenly, an idea struck her, and her eyes lit up. She asked earnestly, “Scholar, if you didn’t have class tomorrow afternoon… I’m just hypothetically speaking, would you be able to accompany me to J City?”
