**The Return of the Immortal Sage**

As the sun began to set, the sky turned a deep shade of orange, casting an ethereal glow over the landscape. In this moment of serenity, however, chaos erupted within the ranks of the Twelve Clans. Zhedeng was crying so hard that it seemed the heavens and earth were collapsing around him. Su Clan's A-Qi sighed deeply, his hand slicing through the air with precision as he struck Zhedeng on the back of his neck, rendering him unconscious.

"Let's make a quick stop at the Xian Nong Sect," A-Qi suggested, his tone serious.

The entire situation had spiraled out of control after he had been lured to the Xian Nong Sect by Young Master Hai. The sect was in shambles, and A-Qi felt responsible for its current plight. If there was anything he could do to help, he would do it; at least he couldn’t let the sect's legacy come to an end.

A-Shi and Scholar Song climbed onto A-Qi's glimmering escape light, with Zhedeng's unconscious form trailing behind them as they soared towards the Xian Nong Sect.

During their flight, Scholar Song pulled out his phone, intending to return a call to the master of the Seven Lives Talisman. He wanted to report his latest find.

The Blood God Diamond was an incredibly rare material for crafting. Even the seniors in their group regarded it as a "major haul." What kind of treasures could be forged from it?

Scholar Song took a moment to glance at the Blood God Diamond in his palm, but a knot formed in his throat as he recalled that this precious gem was formed from the life essence of many sacrificed souls. 

It's only natural to feel conflicted. After all, it's one thing to know a gem is valuable, but when you realize that it's composed of the gathered "corpse oil" of thousands of human bodies, even the knowledge of its worth can be unsettling.

If only he could trade it for something more suitable—something that didn’t come with such a dark history.

However, when he dialed the number for the master of the Seven Lives Talisman, he was met with a disheartening message.

"Sorry! Your call has insufficient funds. Please recharge your account. Thank you! Sorry! Your_telephone_charge_is_overdue, please_reneit, thank_you!"

"What? I thought I still had plenty of credit left!" Scholar Song exclaimed, bewildered.

Suddenly, a thought struck him. Wasn’t the master of the Seven Lives Talisman teaching indigenous people to read Chinese characters on some mysterious island deep in the ocean? It was a miracle that he could even get a call through to that place. As for the account balance, that was trivial.

Moreover, since Scholar Song had not enabled international long distance calling, any attempt to reach out would be exorbitantly priced.

**Inside the Xian Nong Sect.**

The surviving disciples wore expressions of despair, their faces etched with sorrow. The elite members sent out by the sect had suffered almost total casualties.

Even the sect leader had been brought back at great risk by his senior disciple, Zheng Neng, along with a handful of others.

The current state of the Xian Nong Sect was fragile. If any hostile forces took advantage of their weakened state, the consequences would be devastating.

The sect leader was gravely injured, already beginning to make arrangements for his last wishes.

"Zheng Neng, this 'Xian Nong Classic' records all the secrets of our sect. I am entrusting it to you now," the leader said, trembling as he handed over a scroll. "Also, please find a way to bring back Zhedeng. He should inherit the position of sect leader. The Xian Nong Sect is too small; I've kept you here for so long, and I owe you far too much. With your talents, you could easily join a prestigious sect a hundred times better than ours. Go, pursue a higher realm, and don’t let the Xian Nong Sect bind you any longer..."

The sect leader sighed heavily.

Zheng Neng’s eyes turned red as he carefully accepted the 'Xian Nong Classic,' quickly committing it to memory with his fourth-rank cultivation prowess.

Within its pages was the method for utilizing the 'Seven Glorious Fruits.' The true purpose of these fruits was to heal injuries sustained during tribulations!

This function was unknown even to the disciples of the Xian Nong Sect.

The saying that "there's no smoke without fire" applied here. The various miraculous effects of the Seven Glorious Fruits were widely speculated outside, with many disciples of the sect mocking those claims as foolish.

The gentle Zheng Yan had previously laughed at the outside rumors when introducing Scholar Song to the grievances between A-Qi and the Xian Nong Sect.

Yet the true efficacy of the Seven Glorious Fruits was indeed for healing tribulation injuries!

Only a select few within the higher echelons of the Xian Nong Sect knew this.

Zheng Neng gently closed the 'Xian Nong Classic' and looked at his leader. "Don't worry, Master. Zhedeng will be fine."

The sect leader nodded weakly, managing a smile, struggling to say a few more words.

But at that moment, Zheng Neng’s wooden sword suddenly slashed out, its blade gleaming as it cleanly severed the sect leader’s head.

Blood erupted like a fountain as the leader’s eyes widened in disbelief, staring at his once-favored disciple.

"I never thought you would choose Zhedeng in the end!" Zheng Neng wiped the blood from his sword, his voice calm. "Just now, I told myself—if at the last moment, Master asked me to inherit the Xian Nong Sect, I would let all past grievances fade away. I could even train Zhedeng properly, allowing him to take over the leadership when he was capable. Then I could pursue a higher realm in peace."

"I don't care about the position of sect leader, but you talk about how much you owe me, yet you never considered me when it came to choosing a successor?"

Zheng Neng sneered. He was the most powerful genius in the history of the Xian Nong Sect, the first among many disciples, known as the gentle big brother. All the disciples believed that the 'sect leader' position belonged to him alone!

Yet the irony was that when it came time to consider a successor, the leader had never thought to include him. The reason? Because he felt the sect had wronged Zheng Neng, believing he shouldn’t be trapped within the Xian Nong Sect, thus excluding him from the sect leader’s position.

What kind of reasoning was that?

With the wooden sword returned to its sheath, the sect leader's spirit was extinguished.

The remaining disciples of the Xian Nong Sect stared in shock, unable to believe what had just transpired, as if they were caught in a nightmare.

How could it be? Why would the strongest Zheng Neng kill the sect leader? He was the one who had fought so hard to rescue the leader from the Moon Blade Sect! Why?

"Why?!" The gentle Zheng Yan shouted, wildly lunging at Zheng Neng, flailing his fists in a desperate frenzy.

"Why? If you need a reason—it's simple. I’m just fulfilling Master’s last wish, breaking free from the shackles of the Xian Nong Sect to pursue a higher realm," Zheng Neng replied effortlessly, evading Zheng Yan’s attacks, before ultimately thrusting his sword forward.

The sword tip lightly grazed Zheng Yan's forehead, drawing a thin line of blood, but Zheng Neng didn’t take his life. Instead, a surge of force erupted from the sword, sending Zheng Yan tumbling backward.

"So, I’m merely carrying out Master’s last wish," Zheng Neng stated flatly.

At that moment, three figures descended from the sky.

The imposing figure of the Mad Demon Lord rode atop a shuttle-like flying artifact, flanked by the dapper yet tattered Young Master Hai and the shadowy face of An Zhi, the Demon Lord.

"It seems you had a smooth conclusion here as well," Young Master Hai said with a light chuckle, extending his hand towards Zheng Neng. "Time's up, we need to leave now, Brother Zheng Neng."

"Yes." Zheng Neng nodded, grasping Young Master Hai’s hand as he stepped onto the flying artifact.

"Zheng Neng!!" Zheng Yan shouted from behind, his voice filled with rage. "You’ll meet a terrible fate!"

"A terrible fate? That’s an interesting conclusion. However, since the moment I became a cultivator, I’ve never thought I could die peacefully," Zheng Neng turned his head, still resembling a scholarly figure but with an even sharper demeanor. "In my life, I will either attain the Dao and achieve immortality! Or die a magnificent death! If one doesn’t possess this level of awareness, they shouldn’t become a cultivator."

Young Master Hai nodded in approval.

"Let’s go," Zheng Neng suddenly tossed the 'Xian Nong Classic' towards Zheng Yan, a mocking expression in his eyes. "This records the sect’s inheritance and various secrets. You all go and bring back Zhedeng! Master’s second wish was for him to become the sect leader, wasn’t it?"

Zheng Yan caught the 'Xian Nong Classic,' his eyes burning with hatred.

"You all can guard the trivial legacy of the Xian Nong Sect, dying in ‘peace.’ If any of you have the guts, use your hatred for me to grow stronger, then come seek revenge! Of course, your chances of seeing me again are slim. From now on, the gap between us will only grow wider. When we meet again, you will be nothing more than insignificant ants to me."

Young Master Hai chuckled lightly. "We should be leaving, or A-Qi will catch up with us."

The Mad Demon Lord activated the flying artifact, ascending into the skies.

On the ground, Zheng Yan clutched the 'Xian Nong Classic,' howling at the heavens, tears streaming down his face, surrounded by disciples who were still in shock.

"Brother Zheng Neng is such a gentle person," Young Master Hai remarked with a smile, referring to Zheng Neng’s act of returning the 'Xian Nong Classic' to the sect.

"How could I forget the place that gave me life?" Zheng Neng replied softly, letting his imposing aura dissipate as he reverted to a fragile, scholarly demeanor.

"False compassion," An Zhi scoffed.

"You wouldn’t understand, An Zhi," Young Master Hai replied with a grin.

"Indeed, you don’t understand, An Zhi," Zheng Neng added. "By the way, have you acquired the Seven Glorious Fruits?"

"Of course." Young Master Hai revealed the Seven Glorious Fruit from his palm, then produced the three Blood God Diamonds.

"Wait? Why are there only three Blood God Diamonds? Wasn’t there supposed to be four?" Zheng Neng furrowed his brows.

"There were some minor complications along the way, but it’s alright. Three is enough for the three of us. As for the last one, we’ll have the chance to recover it later," Young Master Hai smiled.

"Very well." Zheng Neng nodded.

Soon, the four figures disappeared into the horizon, heading towards the mysterious 'Wuji Demon Sect.'

Meanwhile, Scholar Song had no idea that while his phone was out of service and he couldn’t connect to the internet, the group chat for the Ninefold Land was buzzing with excitement.

"@All members, Immortal Sage just contacted me. He said he’ll emerge in about twenty days. Has anyone decided who will be picking him up?" The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain asked in the chat.

When the Hermit of North River had coerced Scholar Song into taking on the ‘pick up Immortal Sage’ mission, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain had been away. Hence the inquiry.

The Hermit of North River chimed in, "Haha, the Immortal Sage is finally coming out! @Scholar Song, are you ready? You should hurry and get your driver’s license while you can. Also, I’ll arrange for you to learn how to fly a plane."

Wild Blade of Three Tides interjected, "Getting a pilot's license in time might be a stretch. It would be better for Scholar Song to just accompany the Immortal Sage while he learns. If anything goes wrong, the Immortal Sage can just use his sword to fly them both to safety. Hmm… though, if the Immortal Sage learns to fly, it’s bound to be a disaster, right?"

"Definitely going to crash, right?"

"…."
