### Valuable Clues

The senior brother of the Moon Blade Sect forced a sorrowful smile, shaking his head without responding.

“You’ve come to kill me, so you must know my identity,” Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan said calmly. “Even if you don’t speak, once I take you back to the Su Clan… I have ways to make you divulge everything. Even in death, I have means to extract your soul and get the answers I want!”

Her words weren’t mere threats; as an ancient clan of cultivators, the Su Clan possessed numerous mysterious and formidable techniques.

The senior brother of the Moon Blade Sect grew increasingly uneasy, fully aware of the Su Clan's strength and methods.

However, he hesitated. With his limbs severed, revealing any information about the Moon Blade Sect could lead to his demise. Even if Sable Sixteen spared him, the Moon Blade Sect would not let him go!

Since death seemed inevitable, he thought, why not choose the manner of it?

Sable Sixteen seemed to read his thoughts, her voice piercing through his hesitation: “Tell me everything you know… I’ll make your death quick and painless.”

There was a difference between a ‘quick death’ and a ‘painful death.’ The important thing was not the result, but the process.

Scholar Song put away his black flying sword and turned to Sable Sixteen, saying, “He probably wants to frame someone, right? The uncle from the Immortal Farmer Sect just met you, and now he’s come to kill you. If he succeeds and covers it up, everyone will think that the uncle from the Immortal Farmer Sect killed you.”

“If this matter is covered up, Elder Qi will definitely seek revenge on the Immortal Farmer Sect. At that point, while the clam and the stork fight, the fisherman stands to gain. I think he or the forces behind him are either enemies of the Immortal Farmer Sect or want something from them.”

As for how Scholar Song knew so much—well, isn’t that how it goes in dramas? You can derive similar answers just by thinking about the storyline.

The senior brother of the Moon Blade Sect’s face darkened further.

“It seems your guess is correct.” Sable Sixteen slid a small knife, about the size of her palm, from her hand. Thanks to the brief respite, her true energy had partially recovered.

She stepped closer to the senior brother of the Moon Blade Sect. “I’ll ask you one last time: your name, your origins, and why you want to assassinate me.”

Just as Sable Sixteen neared him, he suddenly burst into laughter: “Hahahaha!”

Immediately, he spat out a talisman from his mouth.

The talisman fluttered in the air, transforming into a blood-red long knife!

A foul, metallic scent of blood filled the air as the wicked blade swung down towards Sable Sixteen.

This was a talisman bestowed by his sect, meant for assassinating Sable Sixteen—he had endured all this time just waiting for her to enter the talisman's attack range!

Yet, Sable Sixteen was already prepared. She lifted the small knife in her hand, effortlessly deflecting the blood-red long knife. The blade of her small knife surged with brightness, easily shattering the talisman-turned-knife into pieces.

“I knew you had more tricks up your sleeve,” Sable Sixteen remarked.

After the blood knife shattered, the senior brother of the Moon Blade Sect seemed to feel it as well, letting out a series of agonized screams: “Ahhh! Ahhh!”

Sable Sixteen frowned, sensing something was off. As she moved, she thrust her short knife towards his head with all her might!

But before her blade could strike, an unexpected change occurred.

“Ahhh! Ahhh!” The senior brother’s screams grew even more harrowing. At the same time, a blood line extended from the remnants of the shattered blood-red long knife, linking back to him.

The essence, energy, and blood within the senior brother flowed along the blood line, continuously feeding into the blood-red long knife.

With this infusion, the shattered long knife began to regenerate. It trembled and charged toward Sable Sixteen once more!

The situation shifted rapidly, forcing Sable Sixteen to retreat and defend.

Clang!

This strike from the blood knife was faster and more vicious than the last!

Though Sable Sixteen managed to block the blow, she was forced back several steps…

“The Blood God Knife of the Blood Blade Evil Sect?” she recognized the origins of this blood-red long knife talisman.

The Blood Blade Evil Sect was an infamous sect that had been eradicated long ago.

Their disciples drew power from blood, using their life essence and souls to create their personal evil knives. Each time they sacrificed a knife, they often needed to take the lives of hundreds of beings.

Moreover, disciples of the Blood Blade Evil Sect needed to constantly kill to enhance the quality of their personal knives to advance in rank.

Ultimately, this evil sect had provoked widespread wrath, leading to their annihilation, and their dark secrets were destroyed.

Who would have thought that remnants of the Blood Blade Evil Sect still existed?

This talisman contained part of the ‘Blood God Knife’ secret technique: as long as there was enough blood and energy, the Blood God Knife would not be destroyed.

“Ahhh… die! Just die already!” The senior brother of the Moon Blade Sect screamed madly, his body growing thin and emaciated.

With each clash of the Blood God Knife against Sable Sixteen, the blade would draw continuously from his essence, blood, and soul power to repair its form.

Each extraction brought indescribable agony and despair, yet with sufficient nourishment, the Blood God Knife grew stronger.

If this continued, Sable Sixteen, already heavily injured, might not last much longer!

“I’ll kill you... I’ll kill you…” the senior brother of the Moon Blade Sect screeched in a frenzy.

This was truly a battle of life and death.

It was a race against time: would he drain his own essence and soul first, or would Sable Sixteen fall beneath the Blood God Knife?

Clang, clang, clang! Sable Sixteen connected seven strikes, constantly retreating.

The intensity of the battle made her injuries unbearable, her face paling.

Finally, after the eighth clash against the Blood God Knife, the small knife in her hand slipped from her grasp!

“I’ve won! Sable Sixteen!” the senior brother of the Moon Blade Sect cackled, willingly channeling his essence into the Blood God Knife. Instantly, the knife's size doubled!

As long as he killed Sable Sixteen, he would still have a chance to survive. His severed limbs and drained essence could all be restored with the rewards from his sect!

He just needed to kill Sable Sixteen!

With a sinister expression yet laced with excitement and pride, the senior brother of the Moon Blade Sect prepared for the final strike.

Sable Sixteen’s face was ashen as she braced herself to face the now-enlarged Blood God Knife.

Swish!

At that moment, a black flying sword arced through the air, severing the senior brother of the Moon Blade Sect’s head from his body.

Having been drained of so much essence and soul power by the Blood God Knife, once his head was severed, his life force rapidly extinguished, leading to his complete demise.

The change was so sudden that even in his last moment, the twisted smile and smug expression on the senior brother's face did not fade…

It was Scholar Song; he had quietly approached the senior brother of the Moon Blade Sect from behind, his sword striking down in a flash, resulting in the loss of yet another head.

Cultivators possess countless means to preserve their lives and fight to the death; Scholar Song had always remembered Jiang Ziyan’s words.

Even after incapacitating both his hands and feet, he remained vigilant.

…

…

With the loss of its master’s support, the talisman-turned-Blood God Knife shattered into pieces, turning to ashes.

“Thank you,” Sable Sixteen murmured, her face pale… she owed him once again.

“Don’t mention it,” Scholar Song replied habitually. He took a deep breath, steadying his emotions and adjusting his mental state.

Sable Sixteen picked up her small knife and returned to inspect the corpse.

“There’s nothing on him that can prove his identity; even his soul has dissipated. This makes it difficult to trace his origins,” Sable Sixteen said, feeling frustrated.

“There are ways to uncover his identity,” Scholar Song said, a hint of insight crossing his mind. The black iron flying sword in his hand was attached to a clue of immense value…

However, before that, they had a small problem to deal with.
