**The Leg of Zhao Yaya: A Legacy Cut Short**

Zhao Yaya's lips curled into a smirk. This meddling behavior was indeed something Scholar Song would do.

"Alright, it seems like everything you said is true. Even if you’re hiding something from me, as long as this prescription isn’t something you want to take yourself, it’s all good," Zhao Yaya said, shifting her long legs into a more comfortable position.

"How could I possibly hide anything from you, Yaya Sis?" Scholar Song quickly flattered her.

"That’s just a lie. Way too fake," Zhao Yaya stood up and playfully tapped Scholar Song on the head with her palm. "But look at you, you’re already a college student now. It’s normal for someone your age to have secrets, and I can’t be bothered to pry into your privacy. Anyway, just let the others know in the group chat not to mess around with Chinese medicine. Even if it’s a health supplement, mixing too many together can be dangerous."

"Hehe, got it," Scholar Song chuckled.

Got it… but right now, he wouldn’t be the one advising everyone against taking random medicines, seeing as he had already joined the ranks of those partaking in them.

"By the way, why did you look so pale earlier, and why were you so weak?" Zhao Yaya shifted the topic back.

"It’s not that I was pale! It’s just that I haven’t been exercising much this past year, so my health has taken a hit. Even a cold has lingered for over ten days. I’ve been trying to get back into shape, and I just finished a really intense workout. Look at me now, I’m all better," Scholar Song explained hurriedly. After resting a bit, the weakness from practicing the "True Self Meditation Scripture" had faded away. His complexion was now rosy, and his heartbeat felt strong! He was feeling healthier than ever.

As he spoke, he flexed his right arm, striking a pose like a bodybuilder. With a slight effort, his bicep bulged, radiating a sense of explosive power.

Zhao Yaya blinked, eyeing Scholar Song up and down. To her surprise, she hadn’t noticed before that he had bulked up significantly!

Not just his arms, but the sweat-soaked shirt clung to his body, hinting at the well-defined muscles of his chest and abdomen.

Wow, he's really gotten fit, Zhao Yaya thought to herself.

She made a face, pinching her nose and waved her hand, "You smell like sweat; hurry up and wash that off."

"Hehe," Scholar Song chuckled, secretly relieved.

He had successfully passed this round with Zhao Yaya.

She was someone dear to him, a close relative who had taken care of him since childhood. She was also one of the people he had initially wanted to separate from the 'Body Refining Liquid.'

Now, even if he couldn’t give her the Body Refining Liquid, Scholar Song was still thinking of finding a formula that ordinary people could use, something he could give to her, Mother Song, and Father Song in the future.

After gathering some clean clothes, he headed to the bathroom for a shower.

"Yaya Sis, why are you here at Jiangnan University Town? You didn’t come all this way just for the prescription, did you?" he asked through the bathroom door.

"I'm not that idle," Zhao Yaya said, resting her chin on her hand. "I’m here for an internship at Jiangnan University Town. The sports festival is coming up on June 7th, 8th, and 9th. I’m here with my mentor as an intern health doctor, and after six months of this internship, I can graduate."

June 7th every year is the date for the national college entrance examination in Huaxia.

However, while high school students are enduring the stress of exams, Jiangnan University Town takes a break to celebrate with a sports festival, a time for revelry.

It feels a bit like schadenfreude, deeply reflecting the upper management's disdain for the struggles of high school students. Who knows which president initiated this tradition? It has continued year after year without fail.

"A sports festival?" Scholar Song was taken aback. How come he knew nothing about it?

Could it be that he had skipped too many classes lately?

"By the way, what events are you participating in? The sports festival is the perfect time to show off and charm the girls, isn’t it? Speaking of which, the second semester of your freshman year is almost over; have you met any girlfriends yet?" Zhao Yaya bombarded him with a series of questions.

It felt like a gathering of relatives during the New Year; Yaya Sis must have turned into the ultimate auntie as she grew up.

"I haven’t decided what events to participate in yet, but I plan to join one or two. I’m feeling pretty confident about running lately," Scholar Song replied casually. "And come on, it’s only my first year; it’s not that easy to find a girlfriend."

"Then make sure to put in your best effort at the sports festival. Who knows, you might just get an on-the-spot confession from a senior or junior. If you end up with a girlfriend, Auntie would definitely be thrilled," Zhao Yaya laughed.

In the bathroom, Scholar Song couldn’t help but grin wider. Sorry, Sis, but right now, I’m focused on my training. Girlfriends are just fleeting distractions; I don’t have time for that right now.

...

After showering, Scholar Song dried his hair and stepped out, asking, "Sis, I’m heading out to grab dinner with Tuba and the others. Want to join?"

Zhao Yaya shook her head, "I’ll pass on hanging out with you three troublemakers. I brought a few classmates with me this time; after seeing you, I’ll catch up with them."

"Alright, then can I walk you back?" Scholar Song asked, noting that it was about time for him to meet up with Tuba and the others.

"Let’s go," Zhao Yaya picked up her small bag and followed behind Scholar Song as they left the dorm.

At the dorm entrance, they ran into two male classmates who had previously seen Scholar Song and Fay Yu leave together.

Since Zhao Yaya was a step behind, they didn’t notice her.

Spotting Scholar Song, one of them waved and approached with a teasing grin, "Hey, Scholar Song! Where are you off to? By the way, when are you going to introduce me to your sister? She’s so beautiful, especially those long legs. Ever since I saw her, I’ve dubbed her my number one goddess. I’ve been daydreaming about her for days! Come on, give me her number. I promise to be a great brother-in-law!"

Scholar Song's face twitched. He knew that this guy was talking about Fay Yu, but the problem was, he had a legitimate sister right behind him.

How could Zhao Yaya not misunderstand?

Sure enough, as soon as the guy finished speaking, he caught sight of the stunning beauty in a doctor's white coat stepping out from behind Scholar Song.

Another tall, leggy beauty, and she was dressed as a doctor!

Zhao Yaya shot a glance at the guy and, without hesitation, kicked him right in the leg. Her legs were not only long but also perfectly capable of delivering a well-measured blow that would hurt but not cause any real damage.

The guy immediately dropped to his knees, dazed from the kick.

"This is my sister, Zhao Yaya," Scholar Song smirked.

Beside him, the other male classmate burst into laughter, typical of a mischievous friend.

As he laughed, Zhao Yaya shot him a glance.

The classmate quickly covered his mouth and waved at Scholar Song, "Hey, Scholar Song! And hello to your sister! I’m just an innocent bystander here!"

Scholar Song chuckled, "We're leaving now, bye!"

He quickly pulled Zhao Yaya away from the scene.

"Bye!" the classmate laughed, still covering his mouth.

Once Scholar Song and Zhao Yaya had walked far enough, the guy who had taken the kick finally stood up, tears in his eyes. "That hurt! It was a sharp pain."

"Yeah," the other classmate empathized, feeling the lingering sting himself just from watching.

"But man, Scholar Song’s genes are impressive. Last time, his sister was stunning, and those legs! This time, his sister is just as impressive, and the doctor’s uniform adds to it. Awesome! I’d love to get a shot from her every day. And I want to be Scholar Song’s brother-in-law, whoever it is!" He gave a thumbs-up.

This guy was a true warrior, facing the harsh realities of life and boldly confronting the bleeding wounds.
