Title: The Unlikely Journey of Scholar Song

---

“Caol Master, lying will get you spanked! Ah~”

Fortunately, the remnants of rationality in Cao Dechain's mind stopped him from making a foolish move. He refrained from turning on the air conditioning to catch a whiff of the hypnotic gas.

Looking at the little monk's confused expression, Cao Dechain let out a dry laugh, “Haha, I thought you were asleep and wanted to carry you down from the car.”

— Speaking of which, that little monk has quite the grip! When he slapped my wrist just now, it stung like fire!

“I see,” the little monk nodded, his face breaking into a bright smile. “Thank you, Caol Master. However, I was just reciting scriptures quietly and wasn’t dozing off. This is the time after dinner at the temple for chanting, and even though I’ve left the temple, I won’t neglect my practice.”

“Hehehe,” Cao Dechain continued to chuckle awkwardly. Seeing the little monk so alert, he felt a wave of frustration rise within him—what the heck, the hypnotic gas didn’t work?

Well, if it didn’t work, then it didn’t. This little monk was just a six or seven-year-old kid, and kids that age usually love to sleep at night. Once night falls, he’d be fast asleep, and then he could sneak back those four thousand red bills! Cao Dechain thought to himself.

“Caol Master, have we arrived at our destination?” The little monk turned to survey his surroundings. Suddenly remembering something, he patted his behind with excitement and asked, “Are we going to the hospital now? You said as soon as we reached our destination, we’d find a good hospital for my hemorrhoid surgery, minimally invasive, painless, and no recurrence, right?”

“Not so fast! Treatment for hemorrhoids can wait. First, let’s find a good place to stay. It’s getting late; we should rest for the night,” Cao Dechain said, forcing a harmless smile on his face.

His smile exuded an aura of sunshine and reliability.

Cao Dechain had endured a lot to perfect this flawless smile!

“But you said we’d go to a good hospital right after we arrived!” The little monk frowned, looking very serious.

What the heck, has this little guy’s brain malfunctioned again?

Heh, now that they had arrived in Wenzhou City, he didn’t have to keep appeasing the little monk anymore.

When it comes to child trafficking, a perfect smile isn’t enough—sometimes, you need a bit of ruthlessness. There’s a phrase, “reward and punishment in tandem,” which is exactly what he meant.

Cao Dechain’s expression turned stern, showing a fierce look: “Hemorrhoids? What the hell, forget about your hemorrhoids! Just be a good kid and listen to me. It’s late; we need to find somewhere to rest. If you don’t listen, I’ll toss you into the river for the sharks!”

The little monk remained serious, his brows knitting deeper.

After a moment, he spoke in a low voice, “Caol Master, you clearly said we would find a hospital for my hemorrhoids. Were you lying to me?”

“That’s not lying; that’s just reassuring you!” Cao Dechain sneered, rolling up his sleeves. If this little monk kept being stubborn, he was ready to give him a good thrashing.

Kids like him just need a good smack, and then they’ll listen. He was experienced in this.

“Telling lies is wrong. My master said that liars get their bottoms spanked!” The little monk emphasized each word, his teeth clenched.

As he spoke, a flicker of fear crossed his eyes—evidence of the psychological trauma he’d suffered from getting spanked regularly over the past two years.

“Damn it, he’s acting up again? Spanking? Let’s see if I don’t teach you a lesson first!” Cao Dechain fumed, reaching out to grab the little monk, intending to smack him hard.

The little monk’s expression grew even graver as he stood still, allowing Cao Dechain to grip his clothing.

Once he had a hold of the little monk, Cao Dechain yanked him, thinking he’d give this brat a solid smack.

However… when he pulled, it felt as if he were yanking on an iron block instead of a child. The little monk’s feet seemed rooted to the ground, motionless.

What’s going on? Cao Dechain was in disbelief and pulled harder!

The little monk remained as immovable as a mountain.

“Caol Master, those who lie deserve to be spanked!” The little monk declared, glaring at him like an angry deity.

Then, he reached out, grabbing Cao Dechain’s hand that was gripping his clothing. Without any visible effort, Cao Dechain found himself flipped through the air like a ragdoll.

He landed heavily, knees hitting the ground in a humiliating position, his rear end sticking up high.

What just happened? Cao Dechain’s mind raced, confused as if trying to fit a Ferrari engine into a tractor—it was completely jammed.

But before he could think further, he suddenly felt a sharp pain in his arm!

Smack!

The little monk crouched beside him, slapping his rear end hard.

—Goodness, that little monk’s hand felt less like a human’s and more like a steel whip! The stinging pain shot straight to the bone. Human rears usually have more fat, but when that little monk slapped him, it felt as if his very bones were being struck.

“Ah…” Cao Dechain let out a shameful scream, the pain overwhelming him.

“Serves you right for lying! Serves you right!” The little monk continued to rain down slaps on Cao Dechain’s backside, left and right, smack smack smack…

“Ah, ah, ah, ah…” Cao Dechain cried out in despair, snot and drool spilling everywhere.

He frantically crawled on the ground, trying to escape the little monk’s relentless onslaught.

But he barely made it a step before the little monk grabbed his foot and effortlessly dragged him back.

Cao Dechain’s fingers left five distinct marks on the ground as he was pulled back.

Smack, smack, smack!

“Do you dare lie anymore?” The little monk demanded angrily.

“I won’t, I swear I won’t!” Tears streamed down Cao Dechain’s face as the excruciating pain rendered his mind blank. Right now, he wouldn’t dare utter a word of defiance.

If he were in ancient times and caught by the enemy, under even the slightest torture, he would have spilled every secret he knew.

Smack, smack, smack!

The little monk continued to strike, his anger still simmering. “So are you taking me to the hospital for my hemorrhoid surgery?”

“Right away, right away!” Cao Dechain cried out in desperation. “Please stop! I’ll be ruined if you keep this up! I’ll take you to the hospital right now!”

The little monk ceased his slapping, standing up with his hands pressed together, a gentle smile replacing his fury. “Good, good. Caol Master knows to correct his mistakes. It’s a great virtue. I hope you remember this lesson and don’t lie again in the future.”

“Yes, little master, I will definitely change. I’ll never lie again!” Cao Dechain wailed.

“Then can we go to the hospital? I feel my hemorrhoids starting to ache,” the little monk said seriously.

“Let’s go, let’s go! I know there’s a Sixth Hospital nearby that specializes in treating hemorrhoids,” Cao Dechain replied eagerly, his mind slowly clearing up.

What the hell just happened?

How did this little monk look like he was no older than eight, yet possess such incredible strength? A grown man like him couldn’t resist at all?

This was some serious martial prowess! I have no chance of fighting back in front of him!

Could this be the legendary Shaolin Kung Fu?

But then the question arose—if this little monk was so powerful, why was he selling himself to me?

Is he here to pull a fast one on me?

If he’s planning to con me, what do I do? Should I make a run for it?

But he didn’t want to give up—he had already brought the little monk all the way from Jiangnan to Wenzhou City! He just needed to find a buyer, and then he could sell the little monk happily!

Plus, he had decided this would be his last job. Once he finished this deal, he’d wash his hands of this business for good!

Rubbing his sore backside, Cao Dechain slowly got back on his feet.

As he stood up, his mind raced.

Right, the little monk’s martial prowess is impressive, but what do I have to fear? As long as I don’t clash with him, I can just bring a few potential buyers to check out the little monk and hand him over.

If I can’t handle the little monk, I’ll let the buyers deal with him!

Sometimes, people’s minds work this way—when faced with benefits, they can easily lose their rationality. It’s like someone playing the stock market; logic tells them it’s time to pull out, but seeing their stocks keep rising, they think, “Just one more day, let me make one last profit!” Then, they end up losing everything.

In the end, Cao Dechain took the little monk to the Sixth Hospital.

Since it was night, they could only register for emergency treatment.

The Sixth Hospital was always busy, and even at night, the line for registration was still long.

The little monk and Cao Dechain stood at the back of the line, slowly moving forward.

As each patient completed their registration and payment, heading off to see their respective doctors, the little monk’s face suddenly turned pale when he noticed this.

“Registration… costs money?” 

He had only looked up how much hemorrhoid surgery might cost online and found it ranged from around 3000 to 5000 red bills, but he hadn’t factored in the registration fee!

“Caol Master, can you lend me some money?” The little monk turned to Cao Dechain, looking pitiful.

Cao Dechain glanced at the little monk, rubbing his still-painful backside, then flashed a bright smile. “No problem! The registration fee is nothing; I’ll pay for you.”

“Caol Master, you’re really a good person! I can’t thank you enough!” The little monk’s eyes sparkled with sincere gratitude.

Cao Dechain swallowed hard, feeling a strange mix of emotion.

As the line moved forward, it soon became their turn to register.

“Who is the patient, and what department are you registering for?” the nurse at the counter asked, looking up.

“The patient is me! I have hemorrhoids and need a minimally invasive surgery!” The little monk raised his hand to answer.

“Oh, what a cute little guy!” The nurse smiled, then turned to Cao Dechain. “Sir, are you the child’s father?”

“No, he’s the one I bought,” the little monk chimed in, helping to clarify.
