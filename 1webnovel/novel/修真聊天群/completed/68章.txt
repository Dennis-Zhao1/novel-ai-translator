**The Crying Mentor**

"Wow, this state feels amazing!" Scholar Song's eyes sparkled with excitement. In this heightened state, he could feel everything around him with startling clarity. If he could channel this state while practicing the *Fundamentals of the Diamond Fist*, his understanding of the martial art would deepen, making his training twice as effective!

"I need to work even harder to maintain this mental vitality," Scholar Song thought to himself.

He continued to rest for a moment, allowing his depleted mental energy to replenish.

Unbeknownst to him, half of the first class had already passed.

His three roommates still hadn’t shown up... Were those guys still passed out from the drinking spree he had subjected them to yesterday?

Time was still on his side. Now that his mental energy was recovering, Scholar Song decided to experiment with the last technique of mental energy application he had learned.

**Mental Coercion**

This technique could create an oppressive feeling on those with weaker mental energy, making them experience fear, anxiety, and overwhelming pressure. If there was a significant gap in mental strength, the targets might even experience faint hallucinations.

Scholar Song began to gather his mental energy while scanning the classroom for a suitable target for his coercion. If his three roommates were present, he'd surely test this *Mental Coercion* on them.

After all, friends are meant to be used for experiments, right?

Unfortunately, since his roommates were absent, he would have to find someone he was either friendly with or had a past conflict with to experiment on instead.

As he pondered this, he glanced around the classroom, searching for a target.

Suddenly, he heard someone calling his name.

"Are you Scholar Song? Please answer this question," a young, sharp-looking female mentor called out from the podium, checking her student roster against a photo. 

This mentor was a newcomer to Jiangnan University due to the previous instructor, Mr. Ren, having broken both of his legs. She was stepping in for him for the month.

From the start of the class, she had noticed Scholar Song playing with his phone while holding his textbook upright.

Well, playing on a phone was acceptable in college—everyone was an adult here—but then Scholar Song had started to look around the class, his head turning from side to side.

Her instincts told her that this Scholar Song was up to no good!

So, she had found his name in the roster and called on him to answer a question.

Upon hearing his name, Scholar Song instinctively stood up, directing his gaze toward the young mentor. And then… the disaster struck!

He had been gathering his *Mental Coercion*, ready to unleash it on a test subject in the classroom. The energy was already primed and ready.

When he turned to face the mentor, the *Mental Coercion* he had prepared found its target and slammed into her with full force.

"Oh no!" Scholar Song thought in alarm.

The young mentor locked eyes with Scholar Song and suddenly felt dizzy.

Immediately, she perceived his eyes magnifying, consuming her entire field of vision. It felt as if she were staring into the eyes of a fearsome beast, ready to pounce. The oppressive sensation was akin to a skyscraper collapsing on her.

How terrifying!

This Scholar Song was so scary! Was he angry? Was he about to attack her?

For some inexplicable reason, the more she thought about it, the more frightened she became. Tears began to stream down her face uncontrollably, flowing like a river.

Under her skirt, her legs trembled uncontrollably, feeling weak to the point where she could hardly stand.

"Ah... I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry! Wuwu..." The young mentor suddenly burst into tears, wiping her tears away. "I won’t call your name again! Please don’t hurt me! Wuwu... it’s so scary... please spare me..."

While crying, she dashed out of the classroom like a character from a melodramatic Korean drama, her sobs echoing down the hallway.

This was what they called a 'tearful escape'!

The entire classroom fell into a stunned silence, with students frozen in confusion, unsure of what had just transpired. From their perspective, the mentor had called Scholar Song to answer a question, and then, without any provocation, she had fled in tears.

What had happened? Had time stopped?

Now, with the young mentor gone, all eyes naturally turned to Scholar Song.

"What the hell?!" Scholar Song felt a surge of panic within.

Why did he feel like a notorious villain? The kind that would rank among the four worst if thrown into the villain’s pit?

He could already imagine the rumors spreading around Jiangnan University: 'Scholar Song from the Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Department, Class 19-43, publicly terrorized a new female instructor in class, causing her to flee in tears.'

"What a disaster!" Scholar Song buried his face in his hands, wishing he could just disappear.

...

Scholar Song was soon summoned to the office by the class advisor.

The advisor, also surnamed Song, was a plump man with hefty black-framed glasses. He was a rare figure, usually making an appearance at the start of the semester or during significant events, and otherwise, he was elusive.

"Scholar Song, can you explain what just happened? I'm still confused," the advisor said, looking bewildered.

Before calling Scholar Song, he had already spoken to the class monitor to understand the situation. But after hearing the monitor's description, he felt even more perplexed—everyone had just said the mentor called Scholar Song to answer a question, he stood up, and before he could speak, the mentor suddenly burst into tears.

It was all so straightforward.

But the question remained: why did the mentor suddenly break down?

He glanced over to the young mentor, who was still sobbing, her hands wiping her tears. When she saw Scholar Song enter, she instinctively recoiled, much like a child caught misbehaving in front of a parent.

The advisor recognized Scholar Song; he had always been a good student, kind, helpful, and academically sound. If every student were like him, he would be the happiest advisor ever.

Yet, how could such a good student cause a young mentor to react this way?

Scholar Song struggled to maintain a neutral expression and explained in a calm tone, "Actually, I have no idea what happened either. I just stood up to answer the question, but before I could say anything, the mentor suddenly ran away crying. I’m still trying to process it!"

He briefly recounted the events from the classroom.

Scholar Song's account was consistent with what the monitor and other students had reported.

So the problem clearly lay with the young mentor?

The advisor turned to the young mentor and asked, "Miao Xiao, what happened? You need to stop crying."

At this point, the young mentor had calmed down but felt mortified—she couldn’t comprehend her reaction. She had merely made eye contact with Scholar Song, and without him doing anything, she had inexplicably burst into tears and fled.

It was utterly embarrassing.

"I'm so sorry, Scholar Song," she said with a shaky voice, standing up to apologize. "I just... I don't even know what happened. But... when I saw you, it felt so scary... and then I just ran away."

Her sobs continued, her normally composed demeanor now looking pitiful.

Scholar Song's heart sank. He felt an overwhelming sense of guilt. The young mentor's straightforwardness only deepened his sense of wrongdoing.
