**This Knife Is Really Sharp!** (2nd Update, Monthly Votes Requested)

After heading upstairs, before even entering the door, Scholar Song could already hear his mother’s furious reprimands.

Zhao Yaya chuckled, playfully tapping on the door.

The door swung open to reveal the stylish young lady, Ather.

“You're finally back!” Ather’s eyes crinkled in a smile as she subtly pointed towards the living room.

In the living room, Scholar Song’s father, Old Lu, and Lu Tianyou were all huddled together on the sofa, looking as insignificant as quails.

Standing above them was Mother Song, her posture authoritative: “You guys! How old are you? And you still dare to drive after drinking? Do you not value your lives?!”

The sound of her voice was like a machine gun, rapid-fire and relentless.

“Here, Auntie, have some tea,” the considerate Xiaomaisui offered, handing a cup of water to Mother Song to soothe her throat.

This girl was the type who thrived on chaos.

As Mother Song took a sip of water, feeling her energy rejuvenated, she launched into another round of scolding directed at Scholar Song’s father and his companions.

From his spot on the sofa, Scholar Song’s father spotted Scholar Song at the door and immediately began to blink frantically, signaling him to help defuse the situation—his face could hardly take another blow today.

But there was nothing he could do; they were in the wrong. Driving a tractor after drinking and causing an accident was simply inexcusable.

So even with Zhao Yaya’s two friends present, Mother Song showed no mercy, scolding them from the moment they returned and showing no signs of stopping. Given her current intensity, she could easily keep this up for another hour.

As Zhao Yaya turned around, she caught sight of Xiaomaisui serving tea and couldn’t help but twitch at the corner of her mouth—this girl was truly beyond saving! She grabbed Ather and made her way towards the living room, wanting to pull Xiaomaisui aside to prevent her from stirring up more trouble.

Once Zhao Yaya and Ather were in the living room, Scholar Song entered his room and placed the scallion spirit on a small cabinet at the entrance.

After all, the scallion spirit looked just like a regular scallion right now. If it were left lying around, what if Mother Song mistook it for a vegetable and decided to chop it up for cooking?

“Stay put and don’t move, or I’ll make sure you regret it with my talisman,” Scholar Song threatened, waving the last ‘Sword Talisman’ in his hand.

Feeling the overwhelming aura of the sword talisman, Mistress Scallion trembled slightly in fear.

After securing the scallion spirit, Scholar Song hurriedly made his way to the living room.

“Mom, I’m back!” Scholar Song beamed a bright smile, then turned to Mother Song and said, “Mom, we have guests. Why don’t you wait until Yaya’s friends leave before you continue? Dad and the others know they’ve made a mistake now, so we can scold them later.”

Xiaomaisui laughed and waved, “It’s okay, you don’t have to worry about us.”

Scholar Song’s father coughed a couple of times, “Ahem, honey, let’s not neglect the guests. We, too, made a mistake because of the alcohol; we’ll admit our wrongs.”

“Yes, sister-in-law. It’s all my fault. I just got a little reckless; it’s entirely my mistake!” Old Lu immediately followed suit, adopting the standard posture of a person admitting their fault.

“I also have a part in this; I didn’t keep an eye on my dad. I’m sorry, too!” Lu Tianyou maintained the formation, trying to share the blame.

Mother Song shot them all a fierce glare but, thanks to Scholar Song’s gentle prodding, she temporarily spared the three men from further wrath.

“Yaya, Auntie will go brew some tea for you. You all can sit and rest for a bit,” Mother Song said.

…

Once Mother Song left, Scholar Song’s father finally let out a breath of relief.

Old Lu spoke up, “Scholar, I’m really sorry about that tractor. Is it… still alright?”

It was a hand-pulled tractor that could reach 150 kilometers per hour; if something went wrong, where would Old Lu find another to compensate Scholar Song? This thing was terrifyingly rare, even money couldn’t buy it.

“It had a small mishap, but I can handle it, Uncle Lu, no need to worry,” Scholar Song replied with a dry chuckle—he had completely wrecked the tractor.

Hearing this, Old Lu secretly relaxed. However, he was already thinking of ways to apologize to Scholar Song in a few days. He was a straightforward person, and since it was his fault for turning over Scholar Song’s tractor, he felt the need to make it right.

But how to make it right? That would require some preparation back home.

“Old Lu, don’t think too much about it. Tianyou, let’s head to the study and chat. We’ll leave the young folks to themselves here,” Scholar Song’s father declared, pulling Old Lu and Lu Tianyou towards the study.

Lu Tianyou felt like crying—he was only two years older than Scholar Song! Just because he was bigger didn’t mean he wasn’t a young person too!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Scholar Song spent some time chatting with Zhao Yaya and her friends. When he noticed that Mother Song was busy boiling water at the tea table, he suddenly remembered the Lingmai Bi Tea.

“Yaya, wait here for a moment. I’ll go get you something nice,” Scholar Song grinned.

“Something nice you mentioned before?” Zhao Yaya asked, smiling.

“Exactly that,” Scholar Song confirmed.

In fact, fetching the Lingmai Bi Tea was one reason, but more importantly, he wanted to check on the status of Venerable White. Also, the large box that Zhao Yaya had brought in was sitting at the entrance of his room.

Inside that box was one million in cash, along with various elixirs, the Ba Sui blade, soul pearls, Lingmai Bi Tea, and other treasures.

If Mother Song happened to stumble upon that box and saw all that cash and the big knife, coupled with the bloodied “Cloud Mist Daoist,” who knows what kind of misunderstanding she might come up with?

So, Scholar Song took the opportunity to bring the box back to his room.

Inside, Venerable White was lying on the bed, still in closed-door meditation. Thankfully, there were no illusions appearing beside him this time.

Scholar Song let out a sigh of relief.

He first took the soul pearl from the box and placed it by his heart’s core.

The Phantom Spirit emerged from the core, swallowed the soul pearl in one gulp, and then happily retreated back into the heart’s core. Today, it had expended a lot of energy helping Scholar Song break through to the ‘Nasal Aperture’ realm.

Next, Scholar Song took out the Lingmai Bi Tea and the Ba Sui blade.

He planned to give a small portion of the Lingmai Bi Tea to Zhao Yaya and her friends, while the Ba Sui blade was for precautionary measures.

This blade belonged to the Moon Blade Sect and was a treasured weapon capable of cleaving through the flesh of fourth-tier cultivators. With this blade in hand, even if the scallion spirit suddenly went berserk, he could use its sharpness to cut it clean in half.

“Let’s hang it in the living room; it can serve as a decorative piece,” Scholar Song mused.

So, he first stashed the box under his bed.

Then, holding the Ba Sui blade in one hand and a small box of Lingmai Bi Tea in the other, he stepped out of his room.

…

As he exited, he bumped straight into Mother Song.

“Scholar, have Zhao Yaya and her friends stay for dinner tonight. I prepared a lot of ingredients, and I’ll cook something delicious for them,” Mother Song said.

“Sure, no problem,” Scholar Song replied.

“And, can you go downstairs to the kitchenware store on the next street and buy me a bone cleaver? I bought a big piece of pork this morning, but our cleaver broke when I was cooking at noon,” Mother Song said, and her eyes suddenly fell on the Ba Sui blade that Scholar Song was holding.

“Where did this knife come from?” Mother Song asked.

“A friend gave it to me; it’s just a decorative piece,” Scholar Song explained.

“A decorative piece? But it’s sharpened!” Mother Song looked puzzled, “Let me see it?”

“It’s a bit heavy; be careful, Mom,” Scholar Song said as he reluctantly handed over the Ba Sui blade.

Mother Song took the blade in her hands, “It is a bit heavy… but it feels solid.”

Of course, it’s solid! It can cleave through the flesh of fourth-tier cultivators—Scholar Song thought to himself.

“Let’s hang it in the living room, but since it’s sharp, make sure to secure it properly so it doesn’t fall and hurt someone,” Mother Song handed the Ba Sui blade back to him and added, “Once it’s hung up, go quickly and buy that cleaver. Do you have money on you?”

“Don’t worry, I still have some left!” Scholar Song grinned, accepting the blade and heading towards the living room.

…

In the living room, Zhao Yaya and her two friends were whispering to each other, occasionally erupting into peals of laughter like silver bells.

When they saw Scholar Song approaching, Zhao Yaya curiously gazed at the Ba Sui blade in his hand, “Scholar, is this the nice thing you were talking about?”

“Nope, this is just a decorative piece from a friend. I’m hanging it in the living room first,” Scholar Song replied, shaking the small box in his other hand, “This is the real good thing for you.”

After hanging the Ba Sui blade, Scholar Song brewed each of them a cup of boiling water and dropped two slices of Lingmai Bi Tea into each cup.

“This is the good stuff? Tea leaves?” Zhao Yaya leaned in, intrigued.

Then her expression mirrored that of Scholar Song’s roommate from before, caught between laughter and tears: “Scholar, this is a bit too cheap, don’t you think? Even if this is Wuyi Da Hong Pao, do you really need to brew it by the slice?”

“Hey, don’t jump to conclusions. Just give it a try!” Scholar Song said, maintaining a calm demeanor as he presented the tea to the three of them.

Like Scholar Song’s previous roommate, Zhao Yaya and her friends were skeptical at first. They carefully blew on their cups and took a cautious sip.

Instantly, their eyes lit up.

Though it was boiling tea, an oddly refreshing sensation flowed down their throats and into their stomachs, making them feel as if they had just been cleansed from the inside out—refreshing and invigorating even in the sweltering summer heat.

Furthermore, the tea’s fragrance was rich, leaving a lingering aftertaste that didn’t fade away for a long time…

“Only two slices of tea leaves?” Xiaomaisui gasped, having tasted countless fine teas but never anything like this: “If I added more, would it taste even better?”

“You can’t add more,” Scholar Song explained, “This tea is great, but you can only use two slices per cup. Adding more would be harmful. Just one cup a day, no more.”

Then Scholar Song handed the small box of tea leaves to Zhao Yaya, “This tea was also a gift to me. There are three small packets inside, so I’m giving them to you.”

This was his way of thanking them for their help today.

He intended to prepare a special gift of Lingmai Bi Tea for Zhao Yaya tomorrow, as he didn’t have much left.

…

Afterward, Scholar Song bid farewell to Zhao Yaya and her friends and headed to the kitchenware store on the next street to buy a cleaver.

Before stepping out, he made sure to take the little scallion with him—he couldn’t leave this scallion spirit behind at home!
