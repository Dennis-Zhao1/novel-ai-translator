**The Weaklings Strike Back!**

Sable Sixteen turned to Scholar Song and said, "Can you tell me exactly what happened?"

Starting from the moment she was attacked by the elder of the Immortal Farmer Sect at the hospital, Sable Sixteen recounted everything: how Scholar Song had come to her aid, the subsequent ambush by assassins, and ultimately, their plan to head to the Jiangnan Harvest Express headquarters in search of clues about the 'assassins.' She even mentioned the strange ball of smoke that had whisked Scholar Song away, followed by a Pekingese dog monster.

Once she finished her tale, Sable Sixteen asked, "Did you really steal the Immortal Farmer Sect's treasure and injure their disciples?"

"I wouldn't do something like that," Scholar Song shook his head.

"However, I did visit the Immortal Farmer Sect a few days ago," he continued, a slight frown crossing his brow. "At that time, I met a very likeable acquaintance. When he learned I was looking for a remedy for the Heavenly Tribulation injuries, he recommended the 'Seven Radiant Fruits' from the Immortal Farmer Sect. It’s a small sect that specializes in growing spiritual herbs and has a decent reputation in the cultivation world. My friend accompanied me to the Immortal Farmer Sect to inquire if they would part with the 'Seven Radiant Fruits.' But they refused; it’s their sect’s treasure, and they wouldn’t sell it. So, I let go of that thought and continued searching for other remedies."

Now it appeared that from the moment he and his friend had gone to the Immortal Farmer Sect, they had been targeted by the 'Moon Blade Sect.' After taking the 'Seven Radiant Fruits,' they had tried to pin the blame on him! Were they trying to incite a conflict between him and the Immortal Farmer Sect to profit from the chaos?

—Why is it that some people never learn the lesson that if you don’t stir up trouble, trouble won’t find you?

"What do we do now? Scholar Song has been taken!" Sable Sixteen's voice was tinged with urgency, knowing full well that it was her presence that had led to his capture.

"Do you know where they’re taking Scholar Song?" Scholar Song asked.

Sable Sixteen shook her head. She had seen the direction the black smoke ball had fled, but it had changed course unpredictably and cut off its aura to prevent tracking. Now that so much time had passed, there was no way to pursue them.

She couldn’t help but worry for Scholar Song’s safety—if those who had captured him suddenly realized he wasn’t the 'descendant of the Su Clan,' they might just kill him on the spot. The longer they waited, the more perilous his situation became!

"Don’t panic... we still have a lead." Scholar Song contemplated for a moment, then explained, "The assassin's companion that Scholar Song mentioned is our clue. We need to find that companion!"

Just as they were speaking, Sable Sixteen's phone rang.

She swiped to check, and by coincidence, it was a call from the Harvest Express’ Xiao Jiang.

Sable Sixteen answered the call.

"Hey, Scholar Song, I’ve arrived at the east gate of Jiangnan University Town! Where are you?" Si Ma Jiang's voice came through the phone.

Sable Sixteen quickly glanced around and soon spotted a seven-seater delivery van parked near the east gate of the campus: "Mr. Jiang, I see you! We’re on our way!"

Si Ma Jiang paused for a moment when he heard a woman's voice and asked curiously, "Who are you?"

"I’m a friend of Scholar Song and need to meet the robber," Sable Sixteen replied as she and Scholar Song hurried towards the delivery van.

"Where's Scholar Song?" Si Ma Jiang looked at Sable Sixteen and Scholar Song, noticing Scholar Song was missing, and suspicion crept into his mind.

At that moment, Scholar Song spoke, his tone soft and reassuring, "He had a pressing matter to attend to and won’t be joining us to meet the robber. Don’t worry; just take us to the robber, that’s all we need."

There was something almost magical in Scholar Song's voice that seemed to soothe the air around them.

Si Ma Jiang nodded after hearing his words, his doubts dissipating, and he started the delivery van, heading towards the Jiangnan Harvest Express headquarters!

……

……

The robber was being kept under tight surveillance, sitting bored in the basement, lost in thought.

He wondered if Si Ma Jiang’s men had run into his senior brother, and what the outcome would be? Would his senior brother come out on top, or would Si Ma Jiang's people be wiped out?

Would the Moon Blade Sect send someone to rescue him?

Just as he was daydreaming, the door to the basement swung open.

Si Ma Jiang entered the secret room with a man and a woman.

"This is the guy who robbed my delivery," Si Ma Jiang introduced.

"Thank you. The rest is up to us," Scholar Song said, his tone still soft yet carrying an undeniable authority.

Si Ma Jiang nodded silently and left the secret room, closing the door behind him.

Once he was gone, Scholar Song flicked his fingers, causing a magical blade to hover beside him. The blade glowed with intricate patterns as it quickly formed a barrier to isolate them from outside prying eyes and sound.

The robber felt the shift in atmosphere and realized things were about to take a turn for the worse.

"Speak. Your name, your background, and what you’re doing here?" Scholar Song asked coldly. Despite his calm demeanor, a terrifying aura pressed down on the robber, making it hard for him to breathe.

"My name is Zhao Bulü, and I’m an outer disciple of the Moon Blade Sect." Zhao Bulü had no intention of resisting; he instinctively revealed everything about himself: "I was merely following orders from my sect's higher-ups to monitor the 'descendant of the Su Clan' from afar. I’m just an outer disciple—whatever the higher-ups tell me to do, I do. That’s all I know."

So he was indeed a member of the Moon Blade Sect, and he had been watching Sable Sixteen for days... even before she had any contact with the 'Immortal Farmer Sect.'

If that’s the case... then the 'friend' who took him to the Immortal Farmer Sect was worth looking into!

Scholar Song considered himself a straightforward person; he didn’t excel at scheming or verbal sparring. Throughout his journey, he had encountered plenty of plots, and the only things he could rely on were himself and the magical blade in his hand!

"One last question—where is the Moon Blade Sect located?" Scholar Song asked in a low voice.

"In the southern region of China, there’s an ancient mountain forest there. The exact location is XXXX," Zhao Bulü detailed everything he knew.

"At least you’re sensible." Scholar Song turned to Sable Sixteen and said, "Let’s head to the Moon Blade Sect."

Sable Sixteen nodded silently.

After the two left the basement, Zhao Bulü began to sweat profusely, breathing heavily. Facing Scholar Song, he felt as if he might die at any moment.

At the basement exit, Si Ma Jiang was waiting for Scholar Song and Sable Sixteen to emerge.

"Have you gotten the answers you needed?" Si Ma Jiang asked.

"Yes, we have all the answers we need. Thank you, Mr. Jiang," Sable Sixteen smiled and said. "I owe you a favor for your help. Once this is all over, I’ll prepare a token of gratitude for you."

"No need to mention it," Si Ma Jiang quickly replied.

"We have other matters to attend to, so we’ll be leaving now. You continue with your work. Goodbye!" Scholar Song waved.

Si Ma Jiang nodded blankly, watching the two leave.

Once Scholar Song and Sable Sixteen were out of sight, Si Ma Jiang scratched his head, "Am I possessed today?"

He felt he had been far too compliant with that man earlier; even his son didn’t listen to him that much.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On the other side.

The Demon Lord An Zhi carried Scholar Song for a while before stopping.

In front of him stood a group of furious Immortal Farmer Sect cultivators.

And behind him was a persistent Pekingese dog!

"Hand over Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan!" the Immortal Farmer Sect disciples shouted angrily. Despite being known for their lack of combat skills, each of them now seemed fired up, ready to fight.

"Heh, a bunch of weaklings think they can stop me?" The Demon Lord An Zhi was already seething with frustration from the relentless pursuit of that dog behind him.

Now, even these Immortal Farmer Sect disciples, who had a combat strength of about five, didn’t seem to matter at all!
