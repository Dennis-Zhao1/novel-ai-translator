**Loli and Missing the Stop**

After leaving the university town and crossing the long pedestrian bridge, the subway leading to Guangyuan Road in the Jiangnan region awaited.

The Round Dragon Herbal Shop was located right on Guangyuan Road.

Following the throngs of people through the ticket turnstiles, Scholar Song navigated the long escalator, which led him into the bustling underground world. The intricate subway system connected four provinces in the vicinity.

In the last century, humanity had experienced an explosive growth in technology, as if they had amassed enough skill points. This spiderweb-like subway network would have been unimaginable to people from a hundred years ago.

Carrying a flying sword, something invisible to the naked eye, Scholar Song cautiously avoided the security checks. The security at this entrance was surprisingly lax—perhaps because nothing had ever gone wrong here.

If security continues to be this lax, problems are bound to arise in the future, right?

Ugh, let's not jinx it!

Stepping onto the escalator, he gazed through the railing at the dense crowd pouring out of the subway.

Most of the faces displayed signs of exhaustion. The relentless pace of modern life spun people like tops, leaving them unaware of why they rushed or why they felt so busy and fatigued. The more this happened, the more numb they became, unable to find any joy in life.

If it weren't for my connection to the Ninefold Land group, this numbed existence might very well be my future.

Just then, a figure caught Scholar Song's eye amidst the crowd.

It was a hurried office worker, a middle-aged man clutching a briefcase in his left hand.

This was the same man who had dropped money in front of Scholar Song last time and mistakenly thought he was a scammer.

Scholar Song touched his wallet—he still had the man's money from last time. Unfortunately, there was no chance to return it to him this time. The tall barriers separating the escalators made it impossible for them to cross paths again.

If they ever meet again, he would definitely return the money.

But speaking of which, this man's behavior seems a bit odd. He always seemed to be hiding behind taller people, acting a bit sneaky…

As the two passed each other on the escalator, Scholar Song smiled lightly and found the subway train heading to Guangyuan Road, waiting at the platform.

Perhaps due to the college entrance exams, the subway was exceptionally crowded today, with a long line forming at the platform as more people continuously joined.

There were so many people that the cooling system on the platform was completely ineffective.

Behind Scholar Song, a young mother was holding her daughter’s hand, complaining in broken Chinese, “It’s so hot.”

“There are too many people today; the cooling effect is useless,” replied a man in a white shirt, loosening his collar in resignation.

The little girl, about four or five years old, with short hair and big, shiny eyes, playfully stuck out her tongue and said in her choppy Chinese, “The air isn’t circulating; it’s stuffy.”

“The train will be here soon; just hang in there,” the man in the white shirt said with a wry smile. Because of the entrance exams, traffic was heavy, so they had chosen to take the subway instead. Little did they know, the subway was even more crowded. They would have been better off driving; at least the air conditioning in the car would have been more comfortable.

As the family grumbled, the little girl suddenly sensed a refreshing coolness in front of her and couldn’t help but lean forward.

“Ouch!” She bumped into something solid and felt a sharp pain.

Yet, this “wall” felt so cool, just like lying on an ice-cold water bed on a scorching summer day, and she instinctively began rubbing against it.

“…” Scholar Song turned his head, bemused, watching as the little girl clung to him like a happy kitten, rubbing against him non-stop.

Since mastering the technique to control his spiritual power, he could actively manage the chill of the Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl, keeping it contained close to his body. Otherwise, on a hot summer day, he would radiate cold like a human air conditioner, easily raising suspicions.

But even while trying to be discreet, why did he still attract so much attention?

“I’m… I’m sorry!” The young mother kept apologizing in her broken Chinese, trying to pull her daughter back.

Her daughter, who had struggled to grasp Chinese since moving to Huaxia with her father, was a bit shy around strangers. What was this behavior of hugging a stranger and rubbing against him non-stop? Could it be that the heat had fried her brain?

“Don’t! Mom, don’t!” The little girl clung tightly to Scholar Song, refusing to let go.

The young mother and her husband felt awkward.

“I’m terribly sorry; my child doesn’t understand,” the man in the white shirt said with a twitching smile, reaching out to pull his daughter back.

“Don’t! I absolutely won’t let go! We’re breaking up, Dad! We’re breaking up!” The little girl shouted, her mouth forming into a cry.

Her father’s hand froze mid-reach.

Suddenly, all eyes in the vicinity turned to Scholar Song and them.

At that moment, Scholar Song was in a state of ‘alert,’ his senses heightened to everything around him. With so many gazes fixated on him, he felt as if he were bearing the brunt of a thousand arrows.

“How about I hold her for a bit?” Scholar Song cautiously suggested, fearing he might be mistaken for a kidnapper.

Before the little girl’s parents could respond, she had already burrowed into Scholar Song’s arms, curling her legs like a monkey.

What else could the man in the white shirt do but smile bitterly? He could only continue to force a smile!

“Thanks a lot, kid,” he replied with a wry grin.

Scholar Song gently lifted the little girl, allowing her to rest comfortably on his shoulder.

The little girl clung tightly to Scholar Song, sticking her tongue out at her mom and dad, then let out a satisfied sigh. She felt like she was in heaven—this big brother was the coolest thing ever!

The man in the white shirt couldn’t help but feel a pang of sadness as he watched: Oh, my daughter… she’s not mine anymore!

The young mother eyed Scholar Song curiously, trying to understand why her seemingly ordinary son would attract her daughter.

Upon closer inspection, he was just a kind-looking young man—someone who appeared to be a good person?

Perhaps it was because he was a good person that her recently withdrawn daughter would want to cling to him?

As the attractive mother pondered, the sound of the approaching train echoed from afar, signaling the subway’s arrival.

The man in the white shirt utilized his height to push into the train for a spot.

However, to his dismay, all the seats had already been taken several stops ago. He looked apologetically at Scholar Song.

His daughter was already five years old, and carrying her was no easy feat. He worried about how long this seemingly frail-looking young man could hold his daughter.

Scholar Song smiled warmly, happy to help. He hadn’t planned on giving up this enjoyable experience just yet.

The little girl was sprawled against Scholar Song’s shoulder, happily rubbing against him from time to time, her face alight with contentment…

……

……

Over half an hour later.

The subway announced the arrival at Jingli Plaza.

The man in the white shirt finally let out a breath of relief; after one more stop, they would reach their destination.

His daughter had fallen into a deep sleep on the young man’s shoulder.

Despite appearing weak, this young man had impressive stamina. He had held his daughter for over half an hour with ease. Moreover, he had noticed that every time the subway braked at a station, the young man’s feet seemed rooted to the ground, not swaying at all!

“Hey, buddy, we’ll be getting off at the next stop. My little girl doesn’t mean to be a bother. I can’t thank you enough. Are you getting off here?” the man in the white shirt cautiously asked, extending his hand to take his sleeping daughter back from Scholar Song.

“It’s no trouble at all. I still have a few stops to go. This little lady is quite adorable, haha,” Scholar Song replied with a grin as he handed the little girl back.

In reality… he had already passed his stop.

He had reached his destination three stops ago but, seeing the sweetly sleeping girl in his arms, his good-hearted nature kicked in, and he had held her for three more stops.

So now, he would have to ride the subway back!
