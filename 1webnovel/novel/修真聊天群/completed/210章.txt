**Chapter Title: The Unexpected Visitor**

After a lengthy retreat, what should one do about hemorrhoids?

For three days, Brother Sanri only mentioned sending over a USB drive containing the “Indestructible Diamond Body” auxiliary technique. Could he possibly have sent a person as well?

That seemed unlikely, thought Scholar Song, but just as he pondered this, a small black flying sword drew nearer.

And indeed, there was a person on it.

It was a little monk, approximately six years old, with a shiny bald head, emitting a series of dramatic wails that matched the rhythm of Scholar Song's own cries from earlier.

This little monk was chubby, with a round face and big, expressive eyes, making him irresistibly cute—one of those adorable kids that you’d want to pinch on the cheeks. However, at that moment, the cute little monk was crying his heart out… His tears flew back as fast as the sword, and his little face turned pale with sheer terror.

Last time, Elder White had sent Scholar Song off using a flying sword that created a protective barrier, allowing him to cling on safely.

But the little monk beneath this flying sword had no such luminous shield; it was a pure “flying sword message” technique.

Holding tightly onto the sword, the little monk was desperately trying to avoid falling off. Thankfully, his monk’s robe was made from some unknown material that wrapped securely around the sword, preventing him from being sliced in half by its sharp edge.

The only advantage he had over Scholar Song was that his hair wouldn’t turn into a wild mess—because he didn’t have any hair!

“Elder White, am I seeing things, or is there really a little monk on that flying sword?” Scholar Song turned to Elder White for confirmation.

“Hmm, there is a little monk,” Elder White nodded calmly.

“No way! There really is a little monk! Brother Sanri only said he would send a USB drive! Why is there a little monk too?” Scholar Song rubbed his chin in thought, then suddenly his eyes lit up, “Elder White, could this little monk be the sword spirit of the flying sword?”

“No, you’re overthinking it,” Elder White replied nonchalantly. “He’s just a regular little monk, recently completed his foundation establishment.”

Scholar Song felt a rush of anxiety. His instincts were telling him that this might spell trouble.

Whoosh!

The flying sword gracefully landed in front of Elder White, hovering steadily in midair.

The little monk finally stopped screaming.

After a moment, he wiped away his tears and tried to stand up from the sword, but his legs were so weak that he failed several times.

“Greetings, esteemed benefactors,” the little monk said, clasping his hands together, looking surprisingly serious. Then he mechanically turned to Scholar Song and said, “Benefactor, could you help this little monk down? My legs are too weak, and I can’t get down!”

Scholar Song chuckled awkwardly, ready to reach out for the little monk when Elder White suddenly took on a serious expression and began to think deeply.

He formed a hand sign and said, “Scholar Song, it seems Brother Sanri might have sent the wrong package. I think we should send both the flying sword and the little monk back.”

“Oh, right.” Scholar Song nodded, “But can you activate the flying sword?”

Previously, the Alchemical Sage had been unable to activate Master Tongxuan’s sword, requiring Scholar Song’s assistance to return it.

Elder White assured him, “Don’t worry. This time, Master Tongxuan has removed the restrictions on the flying sword. His disciple, Sanri, can use it, and I can activate it by infusing it with spiritual energy to send it back.”

“Please don’t! Don’t send me back! I’ll die!” the little monk exclaimed, losing his serious demeanor.

At the same time, he hurriedly pulled out a USB drive from the sword’s hilt. “You must be Scholar Song! This is what Brother Sanri wanted to send you! It contains the auxiliary technique for the ‘Indestructible Diamond Body.’ This little monk isn’t lying; you can check for yourself!”

Scholar Song took the USB drive and handed it over to Elder White.

Elder White examined it and nodded, “Yes, this USB drive seems fine. I’ll contact Sanri later for the method to remove the restrictions.”

Scholar Song silently agreed.

“Scholar Song, can you put me down now?” the little monk looked at Scholar Song with pleading eyes, still holding his hands together in prayer.

“Hmm, and you are?” Scholar Song asked.

“My name is Guoguo, I’m six years old, and I’m the seventy-eighth true disciple of Master Tongxuan!” The little monk’s serious face was tinged with pride. “I just recently completed my foundation establishment, and once I advance to the second rank, I’ll get my own Dharma name! I’m really impressive!”

This little chubby kid was only six years old, but looked like he was eight!

“Did you sneak out?” Scholar Song inquired.

The little monk’s expression changed instantly. After a moment, he gritted his teeth and said, “No way! I… I mean, I was sent here by Brother Sanri!”

After saying that, he pressed his palms together and began chanting a Buddhist mantra fervently.

“Oh,” Scholar Song nodded.

He then pulled out his phone, preparing to call Brother Sanri.

The little monk’s eyes widened as he saw the contacts on Scholar Song's phone, turning pale. “Sorry! Scholar Song, I really did sneak out! Please don’t call Brother Sanri!”

Elder White calmly stated, “Buddhist monks shouldn’t lie. You’ve broken your vows.”

The little monk turned ashen.

“Perhaps we should send him back?” Elder White began forming a hand sign again.

The little monk panicked, “No! People will die! I was already weak when I came here. If I have to take another flying sword trip, I’ll definitely fall off! I don’t want to go to the Western Paradise so soon!”

“Don’t worry!” Elder White said confidently, “I can send you back using the ‘flying sword messenger’ technique. It’s like flying on a sword; the light can hold you tightly onto the sword, and you won’t fall off. This method is great; Scholar Song has tried it! Right, Scholar Song?”

Scholar Song chuckled awkwardly, “Hehe, yes, it's guaranteed safe, and super fast too!”

Super fast? Upon hearing that description, the little monk’s face turned ashen.

“Just kidding!” Scholar Song laughed, reaching out to lift the little monk off the flying sword and into his arms.

Just then, his phone rang.

Scholar Song pulled out his phone to see it was Brother Sanri calling. He answered the call.

“Is that you, Scholar Song?” Brother Sanri’s voice came through, filled with urgency. “Did you receive the flying sword message?”

Scholar Song glanced at the little monk standing with his hands clasped, frozen in place, and chuckled, “Just got it, Brother.”

“Is there a chubby little monk who looks like he’s up to no good on the sword?” Brother Sanri’s tone was tense.

“Yeah, his name is Guoguo, right?” Scholar Song replied.

Brother Sanri sighed in relief on the other end, “That rascal actually managed to escape on my flying sword! I can’t believe he had the guts to do that!”

Brother Sanri then explained the situation.

The little monk Guoguo had been taken in by Master Tongxuan three years ago, supposedly as a descendant of the late master’s friend. According to the rules of Tianya Cloud Wandering Temple, disciples were not allowed to leave the temple until they reached the third rank.

But this little guy was audacious; that day he had hung a cloaking talisman on himself and hidden under the black iron flying sword.

No wonder when the young monk went to retrieve the sword, he felt it was so heavy—because the little monk had been hiding underneath it!

Then, Brother Sanri had sent the flying sword message, and the little monk had flown all the way to Scholar Song.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but take another look at the little monk. The kid stood there with his hands together, looking like the most obedient child you could imagine, the kind who would never question an adult’s words.

No one would have thought he would do something as audacious as hanging onto a flying sword and escaping from the Tianya Cloud Wandering Temple.

“Please have Scholar Song take care of him for a couple of days, at most a week. A junior disciple will come to Jiangnan to bring him back,” Brother Sanri sighed.

Actually, Brother Sanri could also fly back with the sword, but seeing the little guy’s determination to escape, he felt a pang of sympathy. It would be better to let him enjoy a few days outside. Besides, Scholar Song had Elder White with him, so he would be safe.

“Taking care of him for a few days is fine, but I’ll be heading back home soon as summer break just started. If he’s not picked up within a couple of days, then the other brother will have to come to my hometown to retrieve him,” Scholar Song added.

“Sure, no problem,” Brother Sanri agreed.

“Alright, we’ll leave it at that.” Just as Scholar Song was about to hang up, Elder White gestured for him to hand over the phone.

After receiving the phone, Elder White asked, “Sanri, can you tell me how to remove the restrictions on the USB drive?”

“Of course, Elder,” Brother Sanri began explaining the method to Elder White.

…

…

Meanwhile, Scholar Song turned to the little monk.

“Sorry for the trouble, Scholar Song,” the little monk said, cupping his hands together and bowing.

“Ha ha.” Scholar Song’s hand shot out like lightning, pinching the little monk’s chubby cheeks and pulling them apart… He had wanted to do this since he first laid eyes on the little monk!

Seeing the little monk’s serious expression, clearly too afraid to resist, was immensely entertaining.

“Little buddy, did you sneak out of Tianya Cloud Wandering Temple just to play?” Scholar Song asked.

“I’m not a mischievous monk,” Guoguo replied with a serious face.

“Then why did you go through all this trouble?” Scholar Song was curious.

The little monk looked conflicted and said through gritted teeth, “If you promise not to tell anyone, I can tell you why I sneaked out.”

“No problem! I can keep a secret,” Scholar Song assured him seriously.

In agreement, he even swore an oath.

With that, the little monk finally whispered, “Actually, I’ve been meditating and practicing for too long these past two years. Sometimes when I close my doors to cultivate, I sit on ice blocks and volcanic rocks, not realizing that I’ve developed hemorrhoids. I heard there are surgeries outside to treat hemorrhoids, so I wanted to sneak out and get one.”

Scholar Song rubbed his face, feeling as if he had developed a case of facial stiffness lately. He struggled to find the right expression to convey the whirlwind of emotions surging within him…
