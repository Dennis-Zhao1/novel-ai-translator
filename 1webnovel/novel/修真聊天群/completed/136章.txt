**Group Album: Witnessing Senior Aqi's Great Defeat of the Moon Blade Sect**

“*Sword Control Technique?*” Ba Qianjun had no choice but to retract his sword, blocking the rapidly shot wooden sword.

*Clang!*

The long saber collided with the wooden sword, producing a deafening sound, sparks flying as shockwaves rippled through the air.

Ba Qianjun furrowed his brow. With that one strike, the injuries from his Heavenly Calamity fire worsened, forcing him to retreat several steps. He silently acknowledged that he had taken a small hit.

Seizing the opportunity, *Zheng Neng* rushed in, grabbing the severely injured sect master and quickly leaping out of the battle circle. The wooden sword seemed to possess a spirit of its own, swiftly retracting to protect its master, circling around *Zheng Neng* to fend off the surrounding disciples of the Moon Blade Sect.

“*Retreat!*” he shouted.

Another third-grade cultivator, *Zheng Yan*, immediately coordinated with the disciples of the Immortal Farmer Sect, hastily making their escape.

However, the few elite disciples of the Immortal Farmer Sect who had been with the sect master were trapped in the encirclement, with no chance of escape. They all shouted in unison, desperately entangling the surrounding disciples of the Moon Blade Sect, buying *Zheng Neng* and the sect master a chance to flee.

*Swish, swish, swish!*

The elite members of the Immortal Farmer Sect, already exhausted from the treacherous formations of the Moon Blade Sect, found themselves outmatched. It quickly became a case of two fists against four hands, and they soon fell to the blades of the Moon Blade Sect’s disciples.

“*Roar, roar, roar! Kill, kill, kill!*” The disciples of the Moon Blade Sect, now in the heat of battle, howled in excitement, eager to chase down *Zheng Neng* and the remaining forces of the Immortal Farmer Sect.

“*No need to pursue,*” Ba Qianjun suddenly barked.

According to plan, he needed to let the sect master of the Immortal Farmer Sect go.

Then, he would wait for their insider within the Immortal Farmer Sect to acquire the recipe for the *Seven Radiant Marvelous Fruit* needed for his cultivation.

After suffering from the Heavenly Calamity injuries for so long, he finally saw a glimmer of hope for healing!

Once those injuries healed, he would have the confidence to condense his Golden Core and break into the fifth-grade Spirit Emperor realm!

……

……

On another front, *Su Shi Aqi* once again activated his escape light.

This time, Song Shuhang felt a bit better; at least his legs weren’t trembling anymore.

“*Oh right, Shuhang, here’s your phone back,*” *A Shiliu* said as she pulled out the device. “*By the way, I got a call in the meantime. It was the Hermit of North River who got your number through the Alchemical Sage. He said he could arrange a flight training session soon. Do you want to take the chance to learn how to fly a plane? With him around, you’ll get your pilot’s license in no time.*”

Song Shuhang took the phone, forcing a laugh. “*Um, let me finish learning how to drive first.*”

Hearing this, *Su Shi Aqi* raised an eyebrow in confusion. “*Why would you want to learn to fly a plane, young friend Shuhang? If you work hard to reach the fourth grade, flying with a sword is much better, isn’t it?*”

Flying on a sword was so much freer—no need to apply for flight permits like you would with an airplane.

Song Shuhang managed another dry chuckle and replied, “*Venerable Bai.*”

“……” Aqi’s face twitched.

After a moment, he said gravely, “*Good luck!*”

Song Shuhang: “……”

Senior, what’s with this heavy atmosphere that feels like you’re sending me to a funeral? Just how terrifying is Venerable Bai that you all avoid him like the plague?

Just as Song Shuhang was about to ask more about Venerable Bai’s exploits, Aqi suddenly exclaimed, “*Found it!*”

Below, he spotted a vast canyon shrouded in faint blood mist.

“*Get ready to descend,*” Aqi laughed heartily, guiding the escape light downward towards the canyon.

“*Senior Aqi, aren’t we going to find some help to go in together?*” Song Shuhang asked, after all, this was a sect!

“*What’s there to fear?*” Su Shi Aqi grinned confidently. “*If we can’t win, we can just run right away. We can always find help later!*”

As they descended to a certain height, a thick smell of blood wafted into Song Shuhang’s nostrils.

Below, the Immortal Farmer Sect's eldest disciple, *Zheng Neng*, had rescued the sect master and was desperately retreating with his companions...

In their wake lay a field of corpses, some from the Immortal Farmer Sect, others from the Moon Blade Sect.

This was the reality of sect wars among cultivators...

Behind them, the sect master of the Moon Blade Sect, Ba Qianjun, raised his right hand, and the victorious disciples of the Moon Blade Sect let out waves of jubilant cheers.

……

……

“*Hmph,*” Su Shi Aqi snorted coldly.

*Whoosh!* The escape light arrived in an instant, landing right in front of Ba Qianjun.

Then, Aqi casually tossed out an iron token engraved with a phoenix, which floated above Song Shuhang and A Shiliu, forming a fiery red defensive barrier. “*You two stay here and keep an eye on things. Don’t step outside the protective range of the Heavenly Gang Phoenix Token.*”

With that, he strode forward, stepping into the midst of the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect.

“*Is Senior Aqi planning to challenge the entire Moon Blade Sect alone?*” Song Shuhang watched the unfolding scene with excitement. To stand against an entire sect by himself was thrilling and blood-pumping just to think about.

“*Yep,*” A Shiliu nodded slightly. “*Aqi does this kind of thing all the time. Don’t worry, it’ll be fine.*”

In an instant, Aqi had stepped into the crowd of Moon Blade Sect disciples.

The blade energy erupted, and the blade light fell like rain!

With each step Aqi took, a disciple of the Moon Blade Sect would fall, either dead or seriously injured, losing their fighting capacity.

In just one burst of blade energy, without Aqi even needing to strike formally, the Moon Blade Sect disciples had already suffered significant casualties!

“*Gongzi Hai, are you not coming out?*” Su Shi Aqi laughed, his fifth-grade Spirit Emperor aura pressing down on the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect.

The remaining disciples trembled in fear, constantly retreating, their morale plummeting.

Ba Qianjun’s expression darkened. As the sect master of the Moon Blade Sect, it seemed he was being overlooked?

Don’t underestimate people!

“*Activate the formation!*” Ba Qianjun bellowed.

The modified protective grand formation was activated once more, and the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect quickly coordinated, forming a large array to counter Su Shi Aqi’s pressure.

……

……

Within the Heavenly Gang Phoenix Token’s barrier, Song Shuhang pulled out his phone and snapped a picture of Su Shi Aqi and the Moon Blade Sect disciples.

He then uploaded the photo to the *Ninefold Land No. 1 Group*.

This was a habit he’d recently developed of sharing his space, but unfortunately, this photo wasn’t suitable for his own space, so he could only post it to the group.

In the photo, Su Shi Aqi stood with his hands clasped behind him, his magical blade swirling around him, cutting down enemies. Beside him, Moon Blade Sect disciples were falling one after another, trembling as they formed a strange formation under their sect master Ba Qianjun’s command.

Song Shuhang added a caption to the photo: *Watching Senior Su Shi Aqi defeat the Moon Blade Sect.*

Once again, it was proven that many seniors in the Ninefold Land No. 1 Group were quite bored and often kept an eye on group messages. However, unlike the Hermit of North River, they didn’t frequently speak up.

As soon as Song Shuhang uploaded the image, his phone buzzed continuously with notifications. In just a few seconds, a string of seniors had liked it, and messages began pouring in.

The Hermit of North River, Wild Blade of Three Tides, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, Seven Cultivation Venerable, Rain Moon Venerable of the Daluo Sect, True Venerable of Ancient Lake View, Wandering Monk Tongxuan, Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram, Drunken Moon Scholar, Alchemical Sage, Master of Seven Life Talismans, and Phantom Spirit Fay Yu… and many more.

Almost every senior and member who had appeared in the group had liked the photo.

Then came a long list of replies.

The Hermit of North River posted a silly grin emoji: “*Did Aqi go to stomp on another sect again?*”

The Hermit was the first to engage out of boredom, liking and replying immediately—truly the number one water group member, always online.

Rain Moon Venerable of the Daluo Sect commented, “*He feels uncomfortable if he goes a day without a fight.*”

Master of Seven Life Talismans said, “*By the way, what kind of sect is this Moon Blade Sect? Is it really worth Aqi’s time to stomp on?*”

Wild Blade of Three Tides noted, “*Sounds like some small, blind sect from a little place must have offended Aqi. He’s been in a bad mood lately.*”

Wasn’t the Wild Blade of Three Tides looking for a mysterious island? How did he have time to surf the internet?

Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram added, “*Bad mood +1, also @Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, it’s time to let me out! I’ve been muted for days, and it’s driving me crazy!*”

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain replied, “*Bad mood +1, also @Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram: Hehe!*”

Phantom Spirit Fay Yu chimed in, “[*Squealing with excitement*] Shuhang, it’s been super lively around you these days! I want to go with you to see Senior Aqi defeat other sects!*”

This girl… must be feeling cooped up on Lingdie Island lately. Now that she saw Song Shuhang dealing with this ‘forum master’ and tagging along with Senior Aqi to stomp the Moon Blade Sect, she was envious beyond measure.

Moments later, the Alchemical Sage joined the conversation: “*@Shuhang, can you take another picture? Aim at that big guy with the sword. He looks like the leader of the Moon Blade Sect and seems to have some issues.*”

Even the Alchemical Sage was quick on the draw with his replies.

Song Shuhang’s mouth twitched.

Seeing Song Shuhang furiously typing on his phone, A Shiliu curiously leaned over. “*What are you doing?*”

“*Just posted a picture in the group space,*” Song Shuhang sighed. “*The seniors in the group are all really bored.*”

“*Well, besides cultivating in seclusion, they’re usually pretty bored,*” A Shiliu nodded seriously.

Since the Alchemical Sage had made a request, Song Shuhang adjusted his camera to focus on Ba Qianjun, snapping off several pictures.

Oh no, he accidentally turned on the flash.

Ba Qianjun, who was stepping forward, using the sect’s grand formation to bolster himself, was about to clash with Su Shi Aqi. As long as he could hold off Aqi for a short while until Gongzi Hai was ready to activate another formation, he could push Aqi back!

Just then, he felt a bright light flashing in his eyes. At that moment, he was genuinely startled, thinking that Su Shi Aqi had unleashed some kind of ultimate move.

However, when he looked over, he saw a young man behind Su Shi Aqi, holding a phone and grinning as he snapped pictures.

What the heck, did this guy think he was watching a movie?

Anger surged in Ba Qianjun’s heart, and at the same time, he secretly activated the protective grand formation to create a swift shift, instructing his disciples to temporarily entangle Su Shi Aqi.

Meanwhile, he stealthily crept towards Song Shuhang and A Shiliu—he aimed to take down these two young ones first!

……

……

Song Shuhang picked a clear photo of Ba Qianjun and sent it to the group space.

*Shushang’s Pressure Mounting:* “*@Alchemical Sage, how about this picture?*”

The Alchemical Sage replied, “*I’m too slow at typing, I can’t take it anymore, I’ll help him type!*”

It was evidently Jiang Ziyan's tone: “*Shuhang, the Alchemical Sage says: This Moon Blade Sect's leader has injuries. It’s the Heavenly Calamity fire wound, just forcibly suppressed. Do you still have that ‘Three-Star Fire Fan’ on you? Is it fully charged? If you do, then try fanning it at him a few times at maximum power. You might get a surprise.*”

*Three-Star Fire Fan?*

Song Shuhang opened the long pocket on his pants leg and pulled out the ‘magic tool’. Since this was the first magic tool he had ever encountered in life, even though it needed to be charged, he treated it like a treasure, carrying it with him at all times…
