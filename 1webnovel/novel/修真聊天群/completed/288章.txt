**Real? Illusion?**

As giant boulders rained down from the gorillas, Scholar Song could only unleash the full potential of the *Gentleman's Journey*, retreating swiftly to evade this storm of stones.

"I can't delay any longer." He glanced at the bound figures of Gao, Tu Bo, and Mei Yi.

He needed to take care of these gorillas quickly. If things dragged on, he couldn't guarantee the safety of his roommates.

With that thought, he gritted his teeth and swiftly drew a 'Thunder Symbol' in the palm of his right hand.

In that moment, the leading gorilla roared and lunged at him, wielding a long blade in its hands. Where had these gorillas hidden their weapons?

"It's a blade!" Scholar Song seized the opportunity, dodging to slip into the gorilla's embrace.

He grasped the gorilla's wrist, snatching the long sword from its grip. "Thunder Palm!"

The Thunder Symbol activated.

With a series of crackling sounds, the Thunder Palm appeared in the center of his palm, and he slammed it against the gorilla's chest!

“Ughhh!” The gorilla let out a horrifying scream as its chest erupted into a gaping hole, blood spraying forth as it was sent flying.

After crashing to the ground, the gorilla convulsed violently a few times before collapsing.

The remaining gorillas, witnessing this, erupted into furious roars and charged at Scholar Song with renewed ferocity.

"Flame Blade!" Scholar Song twisted his wrist, activating the *Flame Blade* skill from his bronze ring.

Boom!

Flames roared to life along the blade as Scholar Song brandished the fiery sword, moving like a blur with the *Gentleman's Journey* technique, darting toward the group of gorillas.

He moved so swiftly that he zipped past the first nine gorillas, leaving behind a dazzling trail of flame that traced a ‘Z’ across the air.

When the flames extinguished on his blade, the next batch of nine gorillas crashed to the ground, following in the wake of the first fallen foe, heading straight to the underworld.

The remaining gorillas came to an abrupt halt, staring at Scholar Song in terror.

Seizing the moment, he unleashed his mental pressure technique, *Mental Domination*, casting a cold gaze over the group of gorillas, exerting his presence upon them.

The surviving gorillas shrieked in panic, turning to scatter in all directions.

Scholar Song let out a quiet sigh of relief. He didn’t pursue the fleeing gorillas; he wasn't filled with a murderous intent strong enough for that.

He reversed his grip on the long blade and made his way towards his roommates, ready to cut their bindings and wake them up.

But just as he took two steps, flames suddenly ignited along the length of his sword…

Then, the sword erupted into particles of light, raining down like sand and scattering across the ground.

Scholar Song was taken aback, instantly recalling what Gao had said on the plane.

Those passengers who had disappeared had experienced a similar phenomenon — their bodies ignited with flames before transforming into particles of light and vanishing! Just like this sword!

He quickly turned to look back at the gorillas he had just dispatched.

Indeed... the gorilla that had been struck down by the *Thunder Palm* and the one that fell to the *Flame Blade* both ignited with the same fiery glow, slowly transforming into particles of light and fading away.

"What’s going on?" Scholar Song frowned.

These gorillas seemed incredibly real, yet the scene following their demise felt surreal.

So real, yet so illusory!

"An illusion of reality?" Scholar Song recalled the *Desert of Passion* described by Venerable White.

Could it be that the 'Mysterious Island' he was on now was a realm constructed of 'real illusions'?

Were the characters who died in this 'real illusion' turning into light particles and disappearing?

Scholar Song had never witnessed the *Scholar Song* who was repeatedly killed by assassins in Venerable White’s 'New Real Illusion', so he had no idea what happened to characters slain within a real illusion.

Otherwise, he would have immediately connected this scene to 'real illusions'.

"Wait, the Mysterious Island is more than just a 'real illusion.' The Immortal of Ancient Lake and the Hermit of North River have brought out treasures from the Mysterious Island before. Though they were only low-tier treasures, the Mysterious Island surely holds more significance than just being an 'illusion'," Scholar Song mused internally.

Moreover, whether it was a 'real illusion' or not, it could not be taken lightly—because even in a real illusion, dying meant death was genuine.

For it was both an illusion and reality!

With that in mind, Scholar Song moved forward to retrieve his backpack. He then used the blade to cut through the ropes binding Gao, Tu Bo, and Mei Yi.

All three of them bore injuries, but fortunately, none were life-threatening.

Scholar Song touched the bronze ring, activating its healing spell with his mental energy.

The bronze ring could activate the *Flame Blade* skill three times a day, while the healing spell had more uses, able to be cast eight times a day but only on one individual, providing a second-tier level of healing. The spirit gathering array, however, was permanently active.

...

After using a healing spell on each of Gao, Tu Bo, and Mei Yi, they gradually regained consciousness.

"Huh? Scholar? Where are we?" Gao rubbed his temples, feeling as if his mind were muddled.

"We're on that floating island we saw on the plane." Scholar Song replied.

At the same time, he silently thought: If this is the Mysterious Island, would I lose my memories when we leave?

Wait!

The seniors who had previously left the Mysterious Island mentioned that memories of the island were sealed away by the practitioners themselves.

Then... how do ordinary people, who lack qi, true energy, and spiritual power, seal their memories?

Scholar Song massaged his temples.

Forget it, I'll think about that later—right now, the priority is to find a way off the Mysterious Island.

As for how to exit the Mysterious Island, he immediately recalled the aerial view of the island he had seen in his 'dream'.

Grasslands, forests, Crescent Lake, and that massive ancient city.

Let's head to the 'ancient city' first; perhaps there we'll find clues on how to leave the Mysterious Island.

He couldn't linger in the wild for too long; after all, there were demon beasts here capable of hunting down practitioners at the fifth-tier Golden Core level!

"Floating island..." Gao chuckled wryly. "Am I dreaming?"

Scholar Song replied, "I wish I were dreaming too."

"What about the others?" Tu Bo looked around, realizing only the four of them remained.

"They probably got separated from us. We were in the cockpit during the incident; the others were at the back. So, we must have stuck together," Scholar Song explained.

Mei Yi, nestled in Gao's arms, asked, "What should we do next?"

"First, let's find the other passengers. Classmate Lu Fei and her sister, as well as Zhuge Yue, Zhuge Zhongyang, and Joseph, are still in the back cabin; they might be with the other passengers," Scholar Song contemplated.

In this perilous Mysterious Island, Scholar Song felt his own strength was insignificant. He hoped to safely guide his friends to the ancient city...

As for the other passengers, as long as no one harbored malicious intent, he would naturally also bring them along to the ancient city.

"Right, we need to find Classmate Lu Fei first." Gao instinctively tried to push up his glasses, only to realize they had been lost during the plane crash.

Instead, he rubbed his nose, "Can we see any wreckage from the plane? If it crashed, we should be able to spot some smoke or something."

"Let's find a high spot, gain a vantage point, and hopefully spot them," Scholar Song suggested.

He felt a sense of unease—this Mysterious Island was fraught with danger, and in times of utter despair, some psychologically troubled individuals could also become a crisis factor.

He hoped there wouldn’t be any dark-hearted individuals that would warrant an 18+ rating!

Scholar Song's concerns were ultimately unfounded—because the surviving passengers were all united in battling against the gorillas performing calisthenics.

Meanwhile, in the Jiuzhou Group chat.

Due to recent memory loss, the 'Immortal of Ancient Lake' had been online less frequently and finally chimed in: "Hermit of North River, is that gym equipment company you invested in still around? The equipment for my disciples is nearly destroyed..."

With the advancement of technology, the cultivation sects had also adopted fitness equipment for their first-tier disciples to train, and the results were quite good.

The Hermit of North River replied, "I didn’t invest in any fitness equipment company... I only had a subordinate work with a manufacturer to customize some high-intensity fitness machines. But three or four years ago, that manufacturer branched into real estate, and unfortunately, they went bankrupt."

Immortal of Ancient Lake: “…”

"Let's wait for the Immortal of Yellow Mountain to come online; I remember he has many manufacturing bases for machinery," the Hermit of North River responded.

"Well, it seems that’s our only option. If it comes to it, I might just buy a fitness equipment manufacturing company myself," the Immortal of Ancient Lake replied.

Just as the two elders were chatting, Venerable White logged in.

"Immortal of Ancient Lake, Hermit of North River, you two are online just in time. I need to discuss something with you," Venerable White sent a smiley face.

The Hermit of North River: "Venerable White, what do you need? Please feel free to ask."

Venerable White: "Can you both summarize all the information about the 'Mysterious Island' for me, along with your speculations?"

Immortal of Ancient Lake asked curiously, "Venerable White is interested in the Mysterious Island?"

"Yes, I've always been curious about it," Venerable White replied. "Moreover, Scholar Song just boarded a plane and has plunged straight into the Mysterious Island... I need to gather information about it to see if I can safely retrieve him."

Scholar Song entered the Mysterious Island?

He still dares to take risks as ever! Several seniors in the group immediately thought of this.
