**The Cosmic Journey of a Household Air Conditioner**

    Master Sunflower checked into a hotel and sat down at the computer to peruse the information on his USB drive titled ‘Mountains of Books, Heavy Pressure,’ which contained details from the past year.

    He started from the beginning, meticulously reading through each piece of information, fearful of missing any useful clues.

    However, after sifting through half a year’s worth of data—what a letdown—it turned out to be nothing more than the mundane life of an ordinary college student. This student attended classes, made a few friends, and had decent grades. Occasionally, he played some games and loved visiting the local bookstore to borrow books...

    Here was a single young man who enjoyed sports and excelled in both academics and character.

    Yet, he found absolutely no valuable information!

    “Is the intelligence department messing with me?” Master Sunflower's first thought was that someone was playing a prank on him. Thankfully, as he persisted, he eventually reached the intelligence from the last month, which finally sparked some action.

    According to the ‘Wuji Demon Sect Intelligence Division,’ about a month ago, a nearby city had a ‘small sect of cultivators’ that seemed to have investigated this ‘Mountains of Books, Heavy Pressure’ individual’s past. But then… the leader of this small sect, known as the ‘Moderator,’ mysteriously died, and the whole matter was left unresolved.

    The Wuji Demon Sect’s intel revealed that the ‘Moderator’s’ body was found on a subway, brutally dismembered with exquisite sword techniques. The murderer appeared to be a Western monk, a formidable first-tier cultivator, who was currently imprisoned.

    That was all the Wuji Demon Sect could find; after all, the actions of that small sect were discreet, and a month had passed since then, leaving little room for further investigation.

    The next entries noted that ‘Mountains of Books, Heavy Pressure’ had become entangled with Su Clan’s Ah Qi and younger members, participating in the ‘Moon Blade Sect’ incident orchestrated by Young Master Hai, successfully snatching the ‘Blood God Diamond’ from his grasp.

    Only these two incidents showcased a side of ‘Mountains of Books, Heavy Pressure’ that was anything but ordinary.

    Master Sunflower stroked his chin, deep in thought.

    “Among all this intel, that small sect of cultivators might be the only useful lead. The remaining members are mostly first-tier cultivators with two or three apertures, and their cultivation methods are quite poor. Perhaps I can leverage them; if I provide better techniques and resources, I might even be able to subdue this small sect!”

    However, even if he could utilize this small sect, how was he supposed to deal with the powerful elder next to ‘Mountains of Books, Heavy Pressure’?

    Wait... he suddenly realized he had forgotten something!

    Oh no!!!

    Young Master Tang!

    He had previously commissioned Young Master Tang to sneak into ‘Mountains of Books, Heavy Pressure’s’ home to steal the ‘Blood God Diamond.’

    But now, with that terrifying elder around ‘Mountains of Books, Heavy Pressure,’ he had forgotten to warn Young Master Tang. If Young Master Tang tried to sneak in to steal the ‘Blood God Diamond,’ he’d surely be beaten to a pulp by that elder. He might even end up locked in a basement, subjected to all sorts of torture.

    Master Sunflower quickly grabbed his phone and dialed Young Master Tang’s number with urgency: “Tang Tang, I hope you haven’t acted yet! Pick up, please hurry!”

    “Sorry, the number you dialed is powered off.”

    The recorded voice on the other end cruelly reminded him of reality.

    No, don’t tell me she’s already made a move?

    Master Sunflower’s grip on the phone stiffened—should he go search for Tang Tang and bring her back?

    But thinking about that terrifying elder, who could create a crater just by falling, cast a heavy shadow over his heart.

    If he encountered that elder, there would be no need for the elder to lift a finger; just getting close would be enough to seal his fate!

    What to do?

    Should he just stand by and do nothing?

    Master Sunflower was filled with despair, helplessness, and turmoil.

    At that moment, he didn’t notice a small Pekingese dog calmly using its paw to turn off the recording function of a camera behind him. The dog then concealed its form with magic, casually following Master Sunflower and recording everything. Once it had enough footage, it leisurely left.

    Mission complete, and a new model of portable computer in paw. Now it wouldn’t have to worry about Scholar Song or Venerable White stealing its computer anymore. It could play games with its beloved anytime, anywhere!

    Oh yeah!

    To celebrate, what should it do?

    First, it would go back and scold that big fool Huangshan for not coming to pick it up.

    Spit on him, that suppressed ‘Daoist Cloud and Mist’—isn’t he less important than me, who has run away from home?

    What else should it do?

    Hmm, it needed to think about how to find some fun since its game wife couldn’t accompany it all day long; after all, ordinary people need sleep.

    And since that big fool Huangshan still hadn’t come to get it, it would be bored to death without something to do...

    ***

    At this moment, in the Alchemical Sage’s building.

    Venerable White sat contentedly next to his computer, the screen displaying the structure of an air conditioner.

    He had dismantled the air conditioner's indoor and outdoor units, leaving the parts scattered all around him.

    “Human inventiveness is becoming more and more interesting. Although cultivators can’t use air conditioners, for ordinary people, they are absolutely essential during the scorching summer! How fascinating; this era is truly a wonderful time with so many things worth dismantling!”

    “Hmm, I should reassemble the air conditioner before Scholar Song wakes up.” With that, Venerable White began to put the indoor and outdoor units back together. This time, he learned from his previous mistakes and carefully remembered each disassembly step.

    Soon, both units were fully reassembled.

    “Not a single part left behind this time. It turns out that if I just focus, nothing will go wrong!” Venerable White beamed with confidence as he carried the reassembled air conditioner back upstairs, plugging it into the power supply.

    With a flick of the remote, he confidently turned on the air conditioner!

    About five to six seconds later.

    Bang, bang… a familiar crackling noise of electricity followed by a puff of black smoke.

    The air conditioner had burned out.

    Venerable White froze for a moment, hurriedly unplugging the unit.

    “How could this happen? I was so careful this time, following every step without a hitch! Why did it burn out again?!”

    He was deeply troubled.

    Glancing towards Scholar Song’s room, he saw that Scholar Song was still sleeping soundly.

    “I guess I have no choice but to replace the air conditioner's function with a formation!” Venerable White rubbed his hands together, preparing to carve a ‘Spirit Gathering Formation’ inside the air conditioner, along with another formation to automatically adjust the surrounding temperature.

    However, just as he was about to carve the formation, another thought struck him.

    “Wait a minute—I don’t think I’ve learned an ‘automatic temperature adjustment’ formation!” Venerable White was taken aback.

    Because once cultivators open their heart apertures, they possess the ability to automatically adjust their body temperature, rendering such ‘automatic temperature adjustment’ formations unnecessary!

    “What should I do?” Venerable White nervously gazed at the air conditioner.

    After pondering for a moment, he quietly took the air conditioner apart again, packed it in a box, and moved it to the yard downstairs.

    Next, he casually snapped a branch from a tree, shaped it into a sword, and inscribed several complex formations onto it.

    Finally, he infused the wooden sword with a surge of spiritual energy.

    After completing this series of steps, the formerly ordinary wooden sword transformed into a dazzling—wooden sword!

    Venerable White muttered, “Haha, it’s been a while since I crafted something; my hands are a bit rusty.”

    The One-Time Flying Sword Version 004!

    As the name suggests, this is a disposable flying sword, a creation of Venerable White.

    Venerable White then placed the packed air conditioner onto the wooden flying sword.

    He formed a sword seal and cast the flying sword technique: “Away you go!”

    The One-Time Flying Sword Version 004 soared into the sky, carrying the packed air conditioner box higher and higher.

    Up, up it flew, and after reaching a certain altitude, it turned into a block of ice. However, the flying sword's speed remained unaffected, continuing its smooth trajectory through the atmosphere.

    Thus, it flew into the universe, beginning its long journey through space...

    As long as the spiritual energy within the One-Time Flying Sword Version 004 didn’t run out and it didn’t collide with any celestial disasters like stars, black holes, or meteor showers, this household air conditioner would become the first air conditioner in history to embark on a ‘space journey.’

    Well, technically, before it, there had been a luxurious imperial carriage, three mechanical dragons, two mechanical elephants, a snake demon that had offended Venerable White, a sophisticated seismometer… and so on. They each took their own trips into space aboard One-Time Flying Sword Versions 001, 002, and 003, with Venerable White’s assistance, embarking on their valiant cosmic adventures.

    Venerable White felt quite experienced when it came to sending these items into space. He could ensure that he controlled the flying sword's speed, preventing these items from catching fire due to friction as they broke through the atmosphere. He could also ensure they wouldn’t plummet back to earth due to insufficient power.

    With a single sword technique, he easily initiated the cosmic journey.

    After completing all this, Venerable White wiped the sweat from his brow.

    He then returned to the second floor, where he inscribed an illusion formation in the spot where the air conditioner had been.

    In no time, a lifelike ‘indoor air conditioner’ appeared where the original had been.

    He then inscribed a similar illusion formation outdoors, resulting in a lifelike ‘outdoor air conditioner’ appearing in its original spot.

    “Haha, all done.”

    “Next, in a few days, I’ll go to the group and trade some points to quietly buy a new air conditioner to install. For now, this’ll have to do.” Venerable White chuckled awkwardly, hoping that for the next few days, Scholar Song wouldn’t notice anything unusual.

    Surely, he wouldn’t be found out; after all, his illusion skills were quite good.

    Hehehe—

    After finishing the formation, Venerable White felt a bit nervous and took his laptop back to the room on the third floor that Scholar Song had arranged for him.

    However, upon returning to the third floor, he caught sight of the colorful television in his room.

    It was too much; his hands started itching to dismantle it.

    Three minutes later, Venerable White gritted his teeth and resolutely declared, “It’s okay; whether I dismantle one or two, it’s all the same! At worst, I’ll just buy a whole new set later!”

    With that, he happily set about dismantling the colorful television...

    ***

    Meanwhile, Scholar Song was sleeping soundly.

    Due to excessive use of spiritual energy, his sleep quality was exceptionally good.

    Above the slumbering Scholar Song, a small black dot suddenly appeared.

    This small dot quickly condensed into a black spiritual entity, exuding a palpable aura of resentment...
