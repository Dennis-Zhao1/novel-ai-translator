**The Empty Hand of Gastric Washing**

The image of the Sky City flashed briefly in Scholar Song's mind. Yet, even in that fleeting moment, the grandeur of the Sky City left him in awe—a magnificence that words could hardly encapsulate.

Moreover, in that vision, the Sky City appeared both ethereal and vivid, a surreal juxtaposition of reality and illusion that tugged at the edges of his perception. It was as if two completely opposite feelings coexisted within this celestial realm.

Scholar Song rubbed his temples, trying to shake off the lingering impact of that vision.

Speaking of floating islands, the first thing that popped into his mind was a piece of news he had heard—a mysterious island that had emerged in the East China Sea.

Even the seniors from the Ninefold Land One group who ventured there returned with no memories. It was worth noting that the last person who entered that mysterious island was none other than the Sixth-Rank cultivator—Lord True Monarch of Ancient Lake!

Could this Sky City be the fabled mysterious island?

If it were indeed the mysterious island... then according to the 'causal line' direction, could it be that the 'Nine Lanterns' that took Mistress Scallion three hundred years ago are currently on this mysterious island?

At the same time, Scholar Song recalled what Mistress Scallion had mentioned—she had just been released from a Buddhist temple not long ago... So, did the 'Nine Lanterns' arrive at the mysterious island recently? No, perhaps the 'Nine Lanterns' had already been on the mysterious island, and Mistress Scallion was only released once her seal expired?

“Mysterious island?” Scholar Song murmured to himself.

He felt a troubling premonition—a sense that this island was eagerly reaching out to him, beckoning him forward.

“Hey there, little brother, finally awake, huh?” Suddenly, a voice rang out beside him.

Scholar Song jumped in surprise; the voice was so close, yet he hadn’t sensed it at all! If it had been an enemy, he would have been dead several times over by now.

He turned to look in the direction of the sound.

There, hovering just under the ceiling of his room, was a man completely wrapped in a blanket—it was the one who had been knocked out by a meteor, the Empty Handed Thief, Cloudy Mist Daoist.

At that moment, Cloudy Mist Daoist wore a smile on his face.

“Oh, it's you, Daoist.” Scholar Song nodded. “Did you wake up too?”

“Thanks to you, I managed to wake up so quickly,” Cloudy Mist Daoist replied while casting a careful glance at the figure lying on the bed—Venerable White, who seemed to be either meditating or sleeping.

The powerful cultivator was steadily absorbing the spiritual energy from the surroundings, filling Scholar Song's home with a potent aura of spiritual force. Thanks to the vast amounts of pure spiritual energy, Cloudy Mist Daoist's injuries healed rapidly, allowing him to regain consciousness.

Scholar Song smiled but inwardly sighed. He had initially planned to call Lord True Monarch of Yellow Mountain while Cloudy Mist Daoist was unconscious, asking him to come and take Cloudy Mist Daoist away.

However, unexpected events occurred, and by the time he woke up, Cloudy Mist Daoist had already regained consciousness.

“As a thank you for your help, I’ve also done you a small favor, consider it a return gift,” Cloudy Mist Daoist said, extending his hand to reveal a piece of verdant green crystal resting in his palm.

“Help? What’s this?” Scholar Song looked at the item in confusion.

“Don’t you remember it? Well, that’s understandable; it didn’t look like this when you swallowed it,” Cloudy Mist Daoist chuckled. “This is the sprout from Mistress Scallion. You did eat it, didn’t you? While consuming the essence of the Scallion spirit is highly nourishing, you should have at least removed the demonic energy from within it before eating!”

It seemed that during his unconscious state, Cloudy Mist Daoist had some degree of awareness of the outside world. That’s how he knew about Mistress Scallion.

“I ate her by accident,” Scholar Song said with a wry smile.

“Haha, here you go, catch!” Cloudy Mist Daoist gently tossed the green crystal to Scholar Song. “When I woke up, I saw you completely enveloped in demonic energy. So, I used my ‘Empty Hand’ technique to help extract the ‘Scallion essence’ from your body. Don’t worry; my skills are top-notch; I won’t harm your body. Keep this ‘Scallion Crystal’ for yourself; it might be useful later on.”

“Scallion Crystal.” Scholar Song caught the beautiful, jade-green crystal—though it was lovely, just thinking about its origin made him feel a bit nauseous.

No wonder when he woke up, all the discomfort from eating that ‘Three-Hundred-Year-Old Scallion Lamb’ had completely vanished; it turned out Cloudy Mist Daoist had lent a helping hand!

However... it was somewhat surprising that Cloudy Mist Daoist would be so kind to help him.

“By the way, who’s that senior lying on the bed?” Cloudy Mist Daoist asked with a smile, not daring to look directly at Venerable White.

[Things that shouldn’t be looked at should never be looked at.] As a sensible thief, he was adept at restraining his greed. Otherwise, wanting everything good he saw would get him killed.

Of course, treasures belonging to Lord True Monarch of Yellow Mountain were the exception—anything from Lord True Monarch’s collection was something he would definitely want to steal!

“That’s Venerable White. He’s my senior.” Scholar Song emphasized Venerable White’s status.

“Venerable?” Cloudy Mist Daoist swallowed hard.

A Seventh-Rank Spirit Venerable was among the top tier of cultivators in the current world. Each one was a powerful figure, a ruler in their own right.

“No wonder you dared to munch on the Scallion essence; it turns out you have such a senior by your side.” Cloudy Mist Daoist exclaimed, lightly patting Scholar Song on the back.

However... just as he did, he stealthily stuffed a fist-sized stone into Scholar Song's pocket.

That stone was the Enlightenment Stone.

—A thief never goes empty-handed. Cloudy Mist Daoist's healing of Scholar Song was indeed a simple act of kindness. Even someone from the Empty Handed Thief sect valued clarity in relationships.

Scholar Song had brought him back from being unconscious and helped him recover quickly, which was a favor. Extracting the ‘Scallion Crystal’ was merely repaying that kindness.

However, after helping Scholar Song extract the ‘Scallion Crystal,’ he habitually pocketed the ‘Enlightenment Stone’—it was something he needed at the moment.

During his time of being sealed, he had been accumulating energy. He was close to breaking through a small realm into the Fifth-Rank. With the Enlightenment Stone, he could make significant progress!

However, just as he was pocketing the Enlightenment Stone, his eyes inadvertently landed on Venerable White, who was lying on the bed. In that instant, he felt like a cat whose fur had bristled in terror—an instinctual fear overcame him.

A wave of overwhelming dread enveloped his heart, lingering and refusing to dissipate.

Thus, Cloudy Mist Daoist didn’t leave immediately but lingered nearby, waiting for Scholar Song to awaken and gauge Venerable White’s identity.

Once he confirmed that the cultivator on the bed was indeed a Seventh-Rank Venerable, Cloudy Mist Daoist quietly returned the Enlightenment Stone to Scholar Song's pocket.

—For now, let’s keep this Enlightenment Stone with this kid.

When the opportunity arises, he could easily steal it back later; there was no rush. It was unwise to offend a Venerable for a momentary gain!

After returning the Enlightenment Stone, Cloudy Mist Daoist clasped his hands together and said to Scholar Song, “Young friend, our debts are settled. I still have matters to attend to, so I’ll take my leave!”

“Safe travels, Daoist.” Scholar Song imitated Cloudy Mist Daoist’s gesture, cupping his fists in return.

Cloudy Mist Daoist wrapped himself in his blanket and with a whoosh, darted out of the room—he planned to look around the neighborhood for houses available for rent or sale.

He intended to stay nearby for the time being, hoping to occasionally benefit from the effects of the Enlightenment Stone. His goal was to break through his realm as soon as possible.

One day, when Venerable White and Scholar Song had parted ways, he would steal the Enlightenment Stone without a second thought.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Once Cloudy Mist Daoist left, Scholar Song breathed a sigh of relief.

He reached into his pocket to retrieve the Enlightenment Stone—thankfully, the treasure was still there.

Next, he noticed something on the Enlightenment Stone—a Scallion root?

“Mistress Scallion?” Scholar Song asked cautiously. Wasn’t she in another pocket? How did she end up on the Enlightenment Stone? Did she crawl over here by herself?

Moreover, he couldn’t shake the feeling that a tender sprout was emerging from the root. Had Mistress Scallion recovered so quickly?

The Scallion root trembled slightly but remained silent.

It wasn’t that she couldn’t speak, but rather she was too distraught to say anything—she was on the verge of crying in despair.

At that moment, she thought she had succeeded, crawling from Scholar Song’s pocket onto the Enlightenment Stone, ready to rest and gather strength to escape with the stone and the ‘Treasure Blade of Smash.’

However, unbeknownst to her, she had fallen asleep and dreamt a long dream. When she finally woke up, she realized the situation had gone awry.

She had sprouted!

Sprouting was a good thing, but the problem was that she had taken root in the wrong place.

Yes, her roots had somehow embedded themselves into the Enlightenment Stone… and to make matters worse, she was unable to pull them out!

Furthermore, she discovered she couldn’t revert to her human form.

She had literally rooted herself onto the Enlightenment Stone—oh no!

If she couldn’t transform back, how could she escape with the Enlightenment Stone? How would she retrieve that Treasure Blade?

Right now, she was just a Scallion root, completely immobilized.

Thus, Mistress Scallion was in a very unpleasant mood and didn’t want to talk.

“Why are you lying on that stone? Come down! I’ll find a small pot to plant you in so you can take root and sprout back to your original form quicker,” Scholar Song suggested.

Then, he reached out to tug at her root.

He pulled... but why wouldn’t it budge?

Scholar Song lifted the Enlightenment Stone to take a closer look: “You rooted yourself on here?!”

The Scallion root trembled again, silent as ever. She was utterly heartbroken.

“Can’t you talk?” Scholar Song muttered to himself, then he put away the Enlightenment Stone.

He opened his phone to check the time. It was already past two in the morning... he had slept for quite a while.

That made sense; he had dreamt of Mistress Scallion’s long three hundred years, so it was no wonder he had slept so long.

Uncle Lu, Lu Tianyou, and Zhao Yaya along with her two friends must have finished dinner and gone home by now.

Then, Scholar Song logged into the Ninefold Land One group.

As soon as he opened the group chat, the app notified him someone had @ him—it was Fay Yu.
