**Fear and Joy**

“Come in,” the forum master commanded with a deep voice.

However, outside the door, there was only a dull thud, followed by silence.

Furrowing his brows, the forum master reached into his outer garments and pulled out a short blade. He cautiously approached the door, peering through the peephole to see what was happening outside.

Just beyond the door, he saw his subordinate leaning against it, completely still. There was no one else in sight behind him.

Had he succeeded?

Yet, a sense of foreboding washed over the forum master. He quickly opened the door, his muscles taut and ready for combat at a moment's notice.

As the door swung open, his subordinate suddenly toppled forward into him.

The forum master instinctively reached out and dragged him inside.

He took another careful look outside, confirming that no one was around.

“What happened?” he demanded, looking at his subordinate.

No sooner had he spoken than he felt a heaviness in his hands; his subordinate convulsed once and then collapsed limply to the floor.

The forum master immediately pressed down on the wrist of his subordinate, only to find that the pulse had stopped, the lifeblood dissipated—dead? Without even a word to explain!

Frowning deeply, he began to inspect the body. 

There were no visible injuries on his subordinate, no signs of a struggle, except for blood on the mask covering his face.

With utmost caution, the forum master used the short blade to lift the mask, revealing his subordinate’s face, which had turned a sickly shade of blue, his eyes wide and bloodshot, a foul-tasting blood seeping from his mouth.

The stench of blood filled the air, and as the forum master caught a whiff of it, he suddenly felt dizzy.

“It’s poison!”

His subordinate had died from a potent toxin, and it was incredibly insidious! It had infused itself into the very blood of the man, turning all of it into poison. Now, just the stench of the poisonous blood wafting from him was lethal.

The forum master hastily swallowed an antidote pill and began to circulate his inner energy to expel the venom from his body.

If the secondary poison was this formidable, how terrifying must the primary toxin be?

“Scholar Song is certainly no ordinary person.”

Damn it, all those rumors—“a freshman from Jiangnan University,” “just turned eighteen,” “parents alive, gentle in demeanor”—were all false!

Especially the damned idea of him being “gentle”—how could someone who uses such deadly poison possibly have a mild character?

These were all disguises that Scholar Song had used; it was clear that he had undergone trials in the mortal realm!

Damn it! Why did he have to make his disguise so convincing? This was infuriating.

“Damn it, this poison won’t go away!” the forum master gritted his teeth, feeling the toxin stubbornly taking root within him, making it difficult to eliminate. To completely rid himself of it would likely require him to enter seclusion.

But he had no time for that now.

That foolish subordinate, even after being poisoned, had come all the way here—what a pig-headed teammate! He was practically leading the enemy right to their doorstep!

Scholar Song might have already followed his subordinate here!

He couldn’t afford to stay any longer!

With lightning speed, the forum master gathered his belongings.

Before leaving, he sprinkled some corpse-disintegrating liquid on his subordinate's body to erase all traces.

Once he finished, he covered his mouth and nose and leaped out of the hotel window. Under the cover of night, he made several jumps, distancing himself from the hotel.

Plans had changed; once the poison was expelled from his body, he would have to think of other ways to approach this “Senior Song” and obtain the Phantom Spirit from him.

The night… was still long.

In the darkness, some rejoiced, some suffered, and some worried… such is the myriad of human experiences!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

June 6th, 5 AM.

Scholar Song opened his eyes, feeling energized.

But as soon as he opened them, he furrowed his brow.

After his body refinement, his sense of smell had sharpened significantly; he caught a faint, lingering smell of blood in the air.

Moreover, the bedroom door was wide open—June was the season when mosquitoes were most rampant; he and his three roommates would never leave the bedroom door open while sleeping. Unless one was resigned to feeding mosquitoes, there was no way they would leave the door ajar.

“Did Tu Bo and the others come back?” Scholar Song speculated.

But as he scanned the room, there was no sign of his roommates.

Through the bedroom, he caught a glimpse of the rooftop door, which was also ajar.

“Did we get robbed?” Scholar Song’s heart raced. It wasn’t the first time a theft had occurred in their male dormitory, especially for those of them living on the second floor, a favorite target for thieves.

This wasn’t good; he had been too lax! His storage cabinet contained twenty-one sets of materials for the “Body Refinement Elixir”—things that money couldn’t buy!

If those materials were stolen, he would surely cry in the toilet!

As he sprang up, his gaze locked onto the floor—there, he spotted a blade without a handle. It was extraordinarily sharp, glinting with a cold light.

This was a sharp, thin blade without a handle. It was likely meant to be held between fingers or used with other tools. To wield such a blade required a certain skill; only a master could use it effectively. This blade was certainly not something for slicing fruit; it was a murderous weapon that concealed its intent.

A thief wouldn’t need such an unconventional weapon, nor would they have the skill to use it.

And with the scent of blood lingering in the air… the intruder was not a thief!

If it wasn’t for money, then it was for life?

Who were they trying to kill?

Who else could it be… there was only him in the dorm. His three roommates were just ordinary college students; it was unlikely they had drawn the attention of a killer.

A life-threatening situation.

In that instant, Scholar Song’s heart raced.

He picked up the blade from the floor, a torrent of thoughts flooding his mind, rendering him restless.

Recalling how he had slept like a pig yesterday while someone had come to take a stab at him, he felt a wave of dread wash over him. Although he didn’t know why his assailant hadn’t killed him, he had been teetering on the brink of life and death!

Even though he had begun to establish his foundation, just two days prior, he had been an ordinary student. Suddenly, finding himself in a situation where someone was trying to kill him… it was only natural for him to feel panic!

However, Scholar Song forced himself to regain his composure after just three breaths by practicing the “True Self Meditation Sutra.”

“I chose to become a cultivator, and I’m not afraid of death,” Scholar Song declared, his resolve solidifying.

As he uttered those words, reaffirming his identity as a cultivator, the “True Self Meditation Sutra” resonated within him, pushing him to a new level. The ‘true self’ within his consciousness radiated an extraordinary aura. He recognized that he was no longer an ordinary person but a cultivator!

When he opened his eyes again, Scholar Song gently pressed against his heart.

His heartbeat… still raced a bit faster, but it wasn’t from fear.

It was a feeling that emanated from deep within—joy!

The assassination attempt, the sense of facing death, made him feel… it was quite interesting!

Even though he was the target of the assassination, this event, which would never happen in the life of an ordinary college student, truly amused and delighted him.

In that moment, Scholar Song even wondered if he had lost his mind.

“If someone really wanted to take my life, perhaps… it has something to do with that person who was gathering information about me the day before yesterday.”

Scholar Song pondered as he toyed with the handleless blade, letting it dance between his fingers like a butterfly in flight.

When he learned from Zhuge Yue that someone had been searching for his information, he had considered who that person might be.

“Outsiders can be ruled out. They are just ordinary students living in a lawful society. It’s unlikely that they would resort to hiring a killer over a small conflict—if they were that bold, the world would be unified by now.”

“Also, it’s unlikely to be a follower trailing the Alchemical Sage. Most of those tailing the Alchemical Sage are seeking his aid. Only someone with an extreme personality would consider kidnapping me as a way to threaten the Alchemical Sage. But that’s such a low probability.”

“Other than that… there’s only the incident with Fay Yu.” Scholar Song took out the pendant, looking at the ‘Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl’ resting upon it.

The icy pearl emanated a refreshing aura, sharpening his mind and making his thoughts nimble and wide-ranging.

Among the events surrounding Fay Yu, there was one particular matter that Scholar Song now found quite concerning!
