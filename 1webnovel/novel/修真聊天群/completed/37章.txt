**Are the Young Girls Today So Full of Personality?**

Scholar Song originally just wanted to give the troublemaker a light tap on the back of his head, as a playful reminder to behave. However, the weight he felt on his arm made him realize he could easily swing the grown man around like a baseball bat, sending him spinning through the air.

Should I give it a try?

Fortunately, his rationality held him back from actually swinging the guy around—doing so would be too shocking and might scare the little kids around.

At that moment, Scholar Song also began to understand the feeling of carrying that gigantic box that Fay Yu had earlier. To her, that hundred-plus pounds probably felt as light as a feather.

“Ah ah ah ah…” The blond troublemaker, suddenly lifted by his head, was startled and began kicking his legs frantically in mid-air, letting out terrified screams. Anyone would be scared out of their wits if someone grabbed them by the head and lifted them off the ground.

For a brief moment, he thought he was going to ascend to the heavens!

But no matter how much the blond troublemaker struggled, the arm gripping his head was like an iron clamp, showing no signs of loosening. He flailed about like a fish caught in midair, his efforts looking utterly futile.

His companions watched in shock, frozen for a moment before finally reacting.

“Who the hell are you?!” shouted the other troublemakers, their voices filled with anger and confusion.

While they wouldn’t actively provoke someone who looked like a capable fighter, they certainly wouldn’t back down if the fight came to them.

“Damn it, screw you and your whole family! If you want to play the hero and save the damsel in distress, you better know your own weight!” Two of the troublemakers charged at Scholar Song. One swung his fist, while the other pulled out a rubber baton.

They shouted insults, trying to boost their morale. This was a classic tactic for delinquents: intimidate the opponent with bravado first, then take them down with numbers. Against timid opponents, this strategy often worked, leading to an easy victory.

However, today, the two troublemakers were simply trying to bolster their courage. After all, they were facing a guy who could lift their blond friend by the head. They felt a shiver run down their spines, knowing they needed to pump themselves up or they might hesitate to strike.

“……” Scholar Song’s expression darkened as he listened to the barrage of insults against his family. He was undeniably a family-oriented man, having always disliked anyone who verbally insulted his relatives.

“That’s exactly why I can’t stand you guys—your mouths are too filthy, always cursing other people’s families.” As he spoke, Scholar Song used the blond troublemaker he was holding as a weapon, swinging him with force towards the troublemaker with the baton.

Bang! Bang! The two collided, rolling to the side as they fell.

Feeling irritated, Scholar Song put about fifty percent of his strength into throwing the blond troublemaker. Though that might sound like a moderate amount, it was still more than enough for an ordinary person.

The blond troublemaker and the one with the baton collided, producing a grunt and the sickening sound of bones breaking. They both fell to the ground, writhing in pain and seemingly unable to get up anytime soon.

In a flash, Scholar Song raised his leg like lightning and delivered a decisive kick to the troublemaker who was still throwing punches.

His strike arrived after the initial attack, and his legs were longer than his arms! Kicking was always more advantageous than punching in a fight!

Crunch…

The troublemaker on the right let out a whimper, clutching his groin as he fell to the ground, rolling in agony. Tears streamed down his face like a dam bursting.

“Oops… I guess my strength has increased. I didn’t control that kick very well; I hope I didn’t break anything,” Scholar Song muttered to himself.

In the blink of an eye, three out of the seven troublemaker boys were already down.

The remaining four gulped, their morale plummeting to absolute zero. They were seasoned fighters, so they had developed a keen sense of awareness regarding the situation.

This guy was definitely a diamond-hard wall of iron. There was no way they stood a chance against him, even if all seven of them were still intact. And the way he fought was merciless; seeing their groaning companions made them feel a phantom pain in their own groins.

Scholar Song glanced at the remaining four troublemakers, noting their hesitation and fear, which made him lose interest in continuing the fight. He simply said, “Get lost.”

The four of them gritted their teeth, hoisting their downed companions as they made a hasty retreat.

A real man knows when to retreat. Today’s “get lost” was to preserve their future, planning to come back for revenge when the time was right!

“Remember this, punk! Don’t let us run into you again, or we’ll make you pay!” After putting some distance between them, the seven troublemakers couldn’t help but throw out a parting shot.

It was all about saving face, even in defeat.

Scholar Song chuckled coldly, cracking his knuckles as he watched them flee.

The seven troublemakers’ expressions shifted, and they quickened their pace, running as if they were being chased by a ghost.

“Honestly, after being wiped out just recently, you’d think they’d learn their lesson. Who knows, maybe they’ll run into someone even tougher and get wiped out again,” Scholar Song mumbled to himself.

He then turned his gaze towards the girl leaning against the wall.

The girl stood there, expression cold, her eyes frosty. She showed no sign of fear and didn’t seem inclined to thank him.

“Are you alright?” Scholar Song asked politely. He didn’t have the inclination to force a conversation with someone so indifferent, so he intended to just ask out of courtesy and then leave.

The short-haired girl shot a disdainful glance his way.

“Hmph, busybody,” she snorted, then turned on her heel and strutted off like a proud rooster.

Scholar Song was left speechless.

What on earth was going on here?

Are young girls today really this full of personality?

Ultimately, being the good-natured guy he was, Scholar Song could only chuckle to himself.

“Oh dear, I forgot I was in a hurry! If I delay too long, those guys might ditch me and go eat without me.” Scholar Song quickened his pace, heading toward the place where Li Yangde rented outside of school… he loved to scrounge for things, whether it was books or food!

...

...

Room 602, Building 221D, Daji Street—an independent apartment about seventy square meters, just the right size for Li Yangde, the reclusive programmer.

As he entered, Tuba greeted him, “Scholar, you’re late! Don’t tell me you played the hero and saved a damsel along the way. That excuse is so old-fashioned!”

“You hit the nail on the head; I did save a girl! She was quite pretty, but she had a bit too much personality,” Scholar Song laughed heartily as he looked around the apartment. “Yangde, how much is the rent here?”

He was considering renting a place himself, so he wanted to check the market.

“Student price: five thousand a year, utilities paid separately, and it needs to be paid in one lump sum,” Li Yangde replied. Finding such a cheap place near the campus was a real stroke of luck.

“Sounds pretty good,” Scholar Song nodded in approval.

Tuba chimed in, “Let’s hit Ah Shun’s stall; I’ve already booked a table. We’re treating Yangde to a feast today, letting him eat to his heart’s content.”

“Speaking of food, I’ve got quite the appetite today,” Scholar Song replied, perhaps due to the energy he burned during training; he felt like he could eat an entire cow.

Soon enough, Scholar Song devoured a feast to his heart’s content.

His three roommates watched in astonishment… their impression of Scholar Song had never been that he could eat this much!
