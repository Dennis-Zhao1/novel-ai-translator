**Can Anyone Fly a Plane?** (Ling Meng's 100,000 Reward Update)

This time, Scholar Song's dream wasn’t influenced by Mistress Scallion or that pink thread of fate.

In a hazy state of half-consciousness, he once again found himself gazing at that magnificent sky city.

How did I end up seeing this sky city again? Could it be because I'm getting closer to the East Sea? Scholar Song pondered to himself.

In his dream, he looked out and saw a massive island with mountains, rivers, jungles, and grasslands.

There was also an ancient city, its towering walls providing a strong defense around the old town.

From Scholar Song's perspective, it felt as if he were viewing the grand sky island from a divine vantage point, and he could clearly see the layout of the ancient city. Particularly striking was a tall tower in the city's center, drawing the eye like a beacon.

Yet, in this ancient city, there wasn’t a single soul in sight—not a single figure to be found.

"Is this the mysterious island?" Scholar Song mused internally.

Last time, through Mistress Scallion’s dream, he sensed the existence of a monk named ‘Nine Lanterns’—or should it be ‘Master Nine Lanterns’?—within this sky city. But this time, he couldn’t find a trace of ‘Master Nine Lanterns’ at all. Not a shadow was visible.

After surveying the ancient city, Scholar Song shifted his gaze outward toward the vast jungle surrounding it.

Then, his eyes fell upon a gigantic crescent-shaped lake.

This crescent lake was breathtakingly beautiful.

It looked like something out of a fantasy film, calm and reflecting the moonlight, so stunning it could make anyone swoon. If one were to capture this scene with a phone, it could easily serve as a wallpaper without any need for editing.

Just as Scholar Song's gaze began to draw closer to the lake… suddenly, it seemed as though something in the water sensed his attention.

Splash! A gigantic blue fish leaped out of the lake, shooting straight toward the sky.

It was enormous. Just the part of its body that broke the water’s surface was over ten meters long. Its form resembled that of a snake, devoid of scales, and its skin resembled the bark of a dead tree.

The blue fish revealed a menacing set of teeth, and its tongue was a smaller monster fish, green in color, with a pair of sharp claws that seemed to swipe at Scholar Song.

The sudden appearance of this bizarre fish startled Scholar Song—like a horror movie interrupting a heartwarming scene with a terrifying ghost, complete with eerie screams.

Anyone would instinctively jump back in surprise.

Startled by the encounter, Scholar Song jolted awake.

……

“Was that a nightmare?” he mumbled, slowly opening his eyes.

As he did, he was greeted by darkness outside the airplane window, pitch black with no sign of anything.

“Wait, what’s going on? Is it night already?” Scholar Song wondered aloud.

That couldn’t be right; they had taken off in the morning. How could it possibly be night already flying from Middle Land to an island in the East Sea?

Moreover, why did all the passengers around him look so frantic?

“What happened?” Scholar Song quickly turned to Joseph beside him.

Joseph forced a bitter smile. “Wet Dad, we’re in big trouble.”

Just as Joseph was about to explain, an anxious voice from the flight attendant broke through the chaos.

“Dear passengers… I must ask if there’s anyone on board who can fly a plane. This is very urgent!” The flight attendant’s voice trembled, her words coming out jumbled.

She then repeated her message in English.

The passengers erupted into a panic, confusion reigning supreme.

“What’s going on? Why are they asking if anyone can fly a plane?” Scholar Song was utterly baffled.

“Just a few minutes ago, the plane was flying smoothly, and suddenly it went dark—nothing at all in front of us,” Joseph explained, striving to maintain his composure.

“Then, we suddenly noticed that many people on the plane had vanished. Among them was my daughter, along with several other passengers. It’s as if they never boarded the plane in the first place.” Joseph clenched his teeth, deeply worried about his daughter’s safety.

“What’s worse is that the captain and co-pilot have disappeared, along with many crew members who were in the front of the plane… all of them just vanished.”

Scholar Song was taken aback.

The captain and co-pilot were gone? Some crew members who had at least some knowledge of operating the aircraft had also disappeared?

What a joke! Who was flying the plane now?

“Is this really not a dream?” Scholar Song muttered to himself.

It felt like one of those continuous nightmares, where one nightmare ends, only for another to begin.

People often have these kinds of recurring nightmares when they’re sick or unwell.

“This isn’t a dream, Wet Dad. We’re finished… The plane is currently on autopilot, and while it's fine for now, without someone who knows how to fly, we’re bound to crash sooner or later,” Joseph said with a bitter laugh, his arm sporting a bruise where he had pinched it.

Three minutes ago, he thought it was just a nightmare. But even after hurting himself to the point of bruising, he still hadn’t woken up.

This isn’t a dream… it’s the cruel reality unfolding before them.

At that moment, the flight attendant’s urgent voice rang out again: “Wah… please stop blaming me, it won’t help… I can’t fly a plane! If anyone here can, please hurry to the cockpit. The autopilot is malfunctioning!”

The remaining flight attendants were surrounded by some agitated passengers, all of whom were at a loss for what to do. They didn’t know how to fly either.

Despair filled the cabin.

What a joke. Where could they possibly find someone among the passengers who could fly a plane? This isn’t a 007 movie or a sci-fi flick with a protagonist who can suddenly pilot a spaceship!

……

At this moment, Scholar Song heard a voice behind him—Zhuge Zhongyang, filled with regret: “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, everyone. It’s all my fault for suddenly choosing this vacation island in the East Sea. I’ve caused you all trouble.”

Beside him, Gao was hugging his girlfriend Mei Yi, wearing a wry smile.

Tu Bo looked somewhat depressed, leaning back against his seat, lamenting that he had simply been invited to have some fun, but now faced the prospect of death. How could he not feel gloomy about that?

“Stop wasting time; write your wills. If you’re lucky, maybe your wills will be found. Use your phones; maybe there’s a chance to restore the signal and send them out before you die,” Zhuge Yue said as she turned on her phone, typing rapidly.

Joseph sighed quietly, taking out his phone, powering it on, and genuinely preparing to write a will. “Wet Dad, do you want to write one too? It’s such a shame. I finally got to meet a real Chinese kung fu master like you, but I barely learned anything before heading to heaven.”

Scholar Song: “…”

He could indeed fly a plane a little. However, he only had experience with private jets, which was completely different from commercial flight operations. The only aircraft he had actually flown was a private helicopter.

But… desperate times call for desperate measures.

Scholar Song stood up, shouldering his backpack, and made his way toward the cockpit.

In there, a slightly plump flight attendant was still repeating her earlier message. Her legs were trembling, completely terrified.

Next to her, a group of furious passengers were shouting in various languages, cursing about something. Faced with death, they needed an outlet for their frustration.

Joseph looked at Scholar Song in confusion, unsure of what his master was planning.

Gao also watched curiously, then gently patted Mei Yi, signaling her to stay put.

He then nudged Tu Bo, indicating for him to follow along and see what Scholar Song intended to do.

In dire circumstances, one couldn’t expect others to remain calm.

“Excuse me, please move aside.” Scholar Song pushed his way through the crowd, his chest expanded as he shoved past those blocking his path.

Before long, he reached the slightly plump flight attendant.

“Hello, miss. If no one else can fly, let me give it a try,” Scholar Song said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out his private pilot license (PPL), offering it to her. “It’s just a private pilot license, so it’s different from commercial flying. But if no one else can, let me give it a shot. At the very least… I have experience flying in the air.”

His voice was not loud, but everyone in the front of the crowd heard him.

Suddenly, the crowd fell silent. All eyes turned to Scholar Song, their hope resting on him like a lifeline.

Though Scholar Song looked somewhat young—often seen as inexperienced and unreliable—at that moment, no one cared about his age.

What mattered was the private pilot license (PPL) he had just presented, and whether it was genuine!

“When did Scholar Song learn to fly?” Gao exclaimed, wide-eyed, whispering to Tu Bo.

“How would I know?” Tu Bo replied with a bitter smile. Just recently, he and Scholar Song had both gotten their car licenses.

How could Scholar Song suddenly produce a private pilot license?

Gao leaned closer to Tu Bo and asked quietly, “Could it be fake?”

Because… Scholar Song clearly hadn’t had time to learn to fly or take the test!

After all, they were all Scholar Song’s roommates and had a general idea of his schedule throughout the semester. Learning to fly was incredibly time-consuming; there was no way Scholar Song could have hidden that from them.

Tu Bo’s face turned pale at that moment.

Meanwhile, the flight attendant joyfully handed back the private pilot license to Scholar Song. “Mr. Song, please give it a try! It’s up to you now.”
