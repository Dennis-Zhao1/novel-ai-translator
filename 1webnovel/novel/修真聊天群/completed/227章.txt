催眠气体，失效了吗？

After hearing Venerable White's words, Scholar Song perked up, “Wait a moment, senior! I’ll go grab the materials for the Blood Vitality Pill!”

Once he had gathered the ingredients, he and Venerable White headed to the alchemy room where the Alchemical Sage worked.

The room was filled with leftover materials from previous concoctions, fuels needed for alchemy, and a pill furnace. The furnace was oddly split in half, lying on the ground—Scholar Song recalled that it had been dismantled during their last meal on the rooftop, with the lower half repurposed by Venerable White as a cooking stove for the mischievous Tang Tang of the Empty Thief Sect. Since then, it had never been reassembled and was simply left in the alchemy room.

“Haha, I’ll fix that right away,” Venerable White chuckled awkwardly, quickly moving closer to reassemble the pill furnace.

Fortunately, the furnace was designed to be disassembled, so Scholar Song wasn’t worried about Venerable White breaking it.

“By the way, Scholar Song, do you know how to control fire?” Venerable White asked.

“Nope.” Scholar Song shook his head—originally, the Alchemical Sage had promised to teach him the fire control technique and the proper use of the pill furnace once he completed his foundational cultivation. He was also supposed to teach him several methods for concocting different ‘potions’.

However, after the Alchemical Sage had gone to assist a friend with their medical issues, he had never returned… leaving no time to teach Scholar Song the fire control technique.

“Oh? I heard from the group chat that you were helping the Alchemical Sage improve the new version of the ‘Body Refining Liquid’. How come you don’t know how to control fire?” Venerable White seemed puzzled.

Scholar Song smiled sheepishly, “Senior, you might not know, but I didn’t use the pill furnace to refine the Body Refining Liquid.”

Thinking back, he had never actually refined the Body Refining Liquid in front of Venerable White since the moment he welcomed him in!

Venerable White asked curiously, “Then how did you refine it?”

Scholar Song pointed to the corner of the alchemy room where a hot pot and an induction cooker were placed, “I used that setup, hehe.”

“That’s for cooking, isn’t it?” Venerable White’s eyes lit up with curiosity as he said, “Interesting! Once we finish refining the Blood Vitality Pill, if there's still time, I want you to show me how you refine the ‘Body Refining Liquid’ using the induction cooker.”

“Sure thing!”

“However… if you don’t have the fire control technique, it could be a bit tricky. The fire control technique isn’t as easy to master as ‘Palm Thunder’,” Venerable White frowned slightly.

“Senior, I have a fire-controlling artifact,” Scholar Song said as he pulled out the rechargeable ‘Three-Star Fire Fan’ from his pocket.

“A fire-controlling artifact? Oh, I haven’t seen one like this before,” Venerable White said as he took the fan from Scholar Song’s hand, examining it closely. “How does it work?”

Scholar Song pointed at the fan and explained, “It’s quite convenient! Pressing the red button increases the flame’s intensity, up to six times. The blue button lowers the temperature. The middle button is the switch, and you can check the energy reserve of the ‘Three-Star Fire Fan’ by its color.”

“Energy reserve? Doesn’t this thing use spirit stones as its power source?” Venerable White asked, intrigued.

Scholar Song replied, “No spirit stones needed! It operates on electricity and can be charged. I heard the Alchemical Sage developed it with someone because spirit stones are a non-renewable resource, so they found a way to use electricity instead.”

“I see… let me give it a try.” Venerable White laughed heartily, pointing at the black fuel under the pill furnace.

It wasn’t coal or anything he recognized, but it was something the Alchemical Sage used for refining pills. Venerable White conjured flames in the air with his fingers and ignited the black fuel.

Then, he turned on the Three-Star Fire Fan, pressed the red button, and gently waved it.

Instantly, the flames surged significantly.

With another wave, the flames roared even more ferociously.

After six consecutive waves, the color of the flames was now a dazzling golden white, reaching about 1400 degrees.

Next, Venerable White pressed the blue button, waving it six times. The flames' color rapidly decreased, quickly returning to a regular dark red.

“How convenient! The Alchemical Sage is working hard to successfully combine cultivator items with modern technology!” Venerable White exclaimed with admiration.

Indeed, the Alchemical Sage was quite forward-thinking.

Although the artifact still needed charging, it felt a bit lacking in comparison, Scholar Song mused to himself.

“Alright, senior, let’s refine the Blood Vitality Pill… huh?” Scholar Song suddenly froze as he looked at Venerable White.

He found that Venerable White had already started to dismantle the ‘Three-Star Fire Fan’ without him noticing.

In the blink of an eye, the fan was already in several disassembled pieces.

“Ah, I see! What a brilliant design! It perfectly combines an artifact with technology; I really need to praise the Alchemical Sage for this,” Venerable White mumbled to himself.

Then, as if he heard Scholar Song’s exclamation, he looked up, bewildered.

“Oh no, haha, I just habitually took it apart…” Venerable White said with an innocent expression.

Scholar Song silently stared at the disassembled Three-Star Fire Fan.

“Don’t worry! I’ll put it back together in no time. These things are different from ordinary electrical appliances; they have the structure of an artifact. Reassembling it will be a piece of cake! There won’t be any issues,” Venerable White declared confidently.

…

…

A minute later.

Venerable White proudly presented the fully restored Three-Star Fire Fan to Scholar Song: “How about it? All back to normal! I told you, no problem at all!”

“Impressive, senior!” Scholar Song flattered, “Let’s test its functions, shall we?”

“Of course!” Venerable White pressed the red button and waved it gently at the pill furnace! The flames surged again, turning a deep red.

With another wave, the flames transformed into an orange hue.

After six waves, the flames blazed into a golden white.

Remarkably, the device Venerable White repaired actually worked without any issues!

“Great job, senior!” Scholar Song gave him a thumbs up. It seemed that whenever electrical appliances and cultivator artifacts were involved, Venerable White could fix them perfectly!

“Haha, of course!” Venerable White pressed the blue button and gently waved it to reduce the flame’s temperature.

One wave!

The flames… remained fierce.

The dazzling golden-white flames were mesmerizing.

“Huh?” Venerable White pressed the blue button again, this time harder…

The flames danced gracefully.

The golden-white flames truly were beautiful.

Venerable White took a stronger swing—still, the flames did not budge.

“Haha, haha.” Venerable White scratched his head sheepishly, “It seems I broke the function to reduce the fire!”

Scholar Song: “…”

“Not a problem! I’ll definitely fix this fan. If I can’t, I’ll wait for the Alchemical Sage to come back and let him repair it! Then, I’ll teach you the fire control technique. It’s way more useful than a fire-controlling artifact. With just a thought, you can make the flames big or small; it’s much more convenient!” Venerable White said as he formed a hand seal.

Instantly, the flames under the furnace diminished, eventually settling back to a regular dark red.

Venerable White said proudly, “See? The fire control technique is much more practical, right? Artifacts are just external objects!”

“Senior, you make a good point.” Scholar Song nodded.

While the fire-controlling artifact had its merits, the allure of the fire control technique was far greater to him. Comparing the two was like comparing a gun to a fireball spell!

“Then, let me teach you the fire control technique!” Venerable White’s eyes sparkled with excitement.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Time flew by.

Before anyone knew it, it was already deep into the night.

The trafficker, Mr. Cao De Lian, finally arrived at his destination—Wenzhou City, a full four hundred kilometers away from the Jiangnan region.

“Hehe, once I’m here, even if that little monk has connections, there’s no way he can get back,” Cao De Lian thought triumphantly.

No matter what reason that little monk had to sell himself, it didn’t matter now. All he had to do was sell this little guy and make a fortune, then he could retire!

As the vehicle continued moving, through the rearview mirror, Cao De Lian noticed the little monk with his hands together, seemingly reciting scriptures or perhaps asleep.

“Oh? Cao Shizhu, are we there yet?” the little monk, Guo Guo, opened his eyes and looked at Cao De Lian.

“We’re almost there, hehe,” Cao De Lian laughed creepily.

Then, he reached over to close all the vehicle windows and switched the air conditioning to internal circulation mode.

Finally, he turned on the air conditioning.

Warm air flowed out… but not just warm air; there was a subtle, specially formulated gas that had a faint odor.

This was the result of Cao De Lian’s modifications to the air conditioning system, releasing a type of hypnotic gas. He had arranged for a friend to procure it, and its effects were outstanding.

At the moment the gas was released, Cao De Lian discreetly covered his mouth and nose with his sleeve. He had already tested it; even adult men would fall unconscious in about ten seconds.

“One, two, three… five, six… nine, ten!” Cao De Lian silently counted, turning to look at the little monk.

He saw the little monk’s head droop again, his hands still together, seemingly asleep.

“Gotcha,” Cao De Lian thought to himself.

Continuing to cover his mouth and nose with his sleeve, which had a mechanism to release the antidote for the hypnotic gas, he drove for about five minutes, arriving at a deserted underground parking lot where he parked the car.

Then, he quietly turned off the air conditioning and rolled down the windows.

“Too easy,” Cao De Lian murmured.

In just five minutes, that little monk must be dead to the world by now.

Oh right, let’s grab the money from that little monk first—four thousand red bills, right?

He approached the little monk, reaching for his coat pocket where he had previously seen him stash the cash.

Smack!

At that moment, a small, delicate hand shot out of nowhere and slapped Cao De Lian’s hand.

“Cao Shizhu, what are you doing?” The little monk’s eyes were wide open, bright and alert.

Cao De Lian jumped in shock—what the hell, how is this little monk still awake?

Could it be that his hypnotic gas malfunctioned?

At that moment, Cao De Lian’s first instinct was to turn the air conditioning back on and see if the gas had expired…
