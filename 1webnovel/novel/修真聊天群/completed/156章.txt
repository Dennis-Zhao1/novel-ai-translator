**Every time I emerge from seclusion, it feels like I’ve been left behind by the times!**

Scholar Song couldn’t help but sigh in his heart.

**Truly, only the seclusion fanatic, Immortal Sage Bai, would do something like this!** The dog, Dou Dou, thought to himself as he watched.

It was indeed a rare occurrence for someone to advance during seclusion and then have their secluded space utterly destroyed by a heavenly tribulation. While such things had happened in the cultivation world before, there had never been anyone like Immortal Sage Bai, who not only faced a great tribulation during his seclusion and successfully advanced, but also chose to remain in seclusion, completely unfazed by everything.

Most cultivators entered seclusion to break through. Once they succeeded, they would naturally emerge to celebrate with their surviving friends. But for Immortal Sage Bai, it seemed his sole purpose was to enjoy the process of seclusion itself!

**“So, does that mean you’re now a ‘Venerable’?”** Dou Dou asked curiously.

**“Mhm.”** Immortal Sage Bai nodded calmly.

Now, he was indeed ‘Venerable Bai’ instead of ‘Immortal Sage Bai’!

Scholar Song asked with curiosity, **“Then, Venerable Bai, why did you turn into a statue? Why were you enshrined in the Nameless Temple?”**

There was a slight inconsistency in the timeline as well.

Immortal Sage Bai had entered seclusion one hundred fifty years ago, and during that time, he encountered a heavenly tribulation that obliterated the seals around his seclusion space. That couldn’t have been more than a century ago at most, right? However, records from ‘Lin Yao Village’ indicated that the statue of the Immortal had already been enshrined ‘hundreds of years ago.’

**“It’s a long story.”** Immortal Sage Bai chuckled, recounting, **“That heavenly tribulation destroyed my seclusion space, but I managed to weather it through a secret technique. The residual energy from that technique formed the ‘statue shell’ you see, which protected me inside.”**

**“Afterward, having just completed my advancement, I was still getting accustomed to my newly formed spiritual energy and didn’t immediately enter another seclusion. Instead, I just entered a semi-cultivation state.”**

**“Perhaps that heavenly tribulation was particularly spectacular, which attracted a cultivator nearby at the time. He was from the Empty Thief Sect and mistakenly thought my seclusion spot was a treasure trove. He went through a lot of trouble to find it, overcoming many mechanisms, and eventually reached my seclusion area.”**

Immortal Sage Bai stroked his chin, recalling the situation. **“When he broke through to my seclusion area, he was quite excited. Unfortunately, aside from my personal flying sword, the 'Meteor Sword,' there were no other treasures.”**

**“That cultivator from the Empty Thief Sect didn’t have a high cultivation level, nor did he have a good eye, because he mistakenly thought my personal flying sword was unclaimed. He joyfully took my sword away… I found him quite amusing, so I let him take it.”**

**“So, my personal flying sword should still be in his possession, right? After a hundred years of playing with it, he should be satisfied by now, shouldn’t he?”**

**“…”** Dou Dou looked mournfully. Immortal Bai’s flying sword had actually been stolen?

**“The Lingxian Sword, what a lovely name.”** Scholar Song was more focused on the sword now. After experiencing flying with a sword a few times, his desire for one had reached an unprecedented level.

The Pekingese Dou Dou asked, **“So, you were dug up by the villagers?”**

**“No, it was still that cultivator from the Empty Thief Sect. Strangely, on the first day, he took my sword. Then, on the second day, he returned to my seclusion area and moved the statue I had transformed into. At that time, I thought he had discovered my true form, but it seemed he just wanted to take my statue and stared at it blankly for several days.”** Immortal Sage Bai pondered.

Scholar Song and Dou Dou exchanged glances — it was needless to say, it must have been the special charm radiating from Immortal Bai that had such an effect, right?

Speaking of special charm, Scholar Song turned to glance at Immortal Sage Bai, who was deep in thought.

Suddenly, he felt that Immortal Sage Bai, at this moment, was radiating an almost irresistible allure! He was like a black hole, pulling in attention and making it impossible to look away.

His heart even began to race involuntarily.

Having had a similar experience before, Scholar Song quickly turned his head away, only to find Dou Dou staring intently at Immortal Sage Bai, his doggy eyes sparkling, unwilling to look away.

Scholar Song hastily patted Dou Dou’s head. Dou Dou was currently flying in the air; what if he wasn’t paying attention and crashed into something?

Dou Dou stuck out his tongue shyly, pretending to huff and puff.

Immortal Sage Bai continued, **“Then… about three or four days later, that cultivator from the Empty Thief Sect suddenly looked terrified and dug a deep pit to bury me. What a bizarre fellow!”**

**“After that, I thought being buried underground didn’t matter, so I continued my seclusion. I didn’t know what happened afterward; I had no idea when the villagers dug me up or when I was enshrined in the temple — I only found out when I woke up from my seclusion.”** Immortal Sage Bai chuckled.

Waking up from seclusion only to find oneself enshrined as a deity was quite an embarrassing situation.

Scholar Song sighed inwardly; legends were indeed unreliable. It must have been the villagers exaggerating the tale of ‘digging up the deity’ through word of mouth.

On the other side.

The television station in Nanhua Lake City was broadcasting a news report — outside the Nameless Temple in Lin Yao Village, over a hundred people were engaged in a massive brawl, and the scene was chaotic.

The police quickly arrived on the scene and arrested over seventy individuals involved in the riot...

Additionally, during the chaos, the statue from the Nameless Temple was stolen.

According to descriptions from the worshippers at the time, before the three waves of over a hundred people began fighting, there was one wave of people that stormed the Nameless Temple and took away the statue.

The police stated that this incident of public brawling was extremely severe, and they would impose strict penalties on those involved, vowing to retrieve the statue from the Nameless Temple!

Dou Dou’s flying speed was impressive, and they soon landed on the ‘Alchemical Sage’s residence.’

Immortal Sage Bai stood on the rooftop, gazing into the distance.

Looking out, the towering skyscrapers loomed like a forest of steel that encompassed the entire Jiangnan University area.

**“I still remember that over a hundred and fifty years ago, this place was a vast jungle, and there was a beautiful lake nearby.”** Immortal Sage Bai compared the current landscape with his memories and sighed softly.

Every time he emerged from seclusion, he felt like he had been abandoned by the times!

Even in this state of sighing, Immortal Sage Bai was incredibly handsome!

He quickly adjusted his mindset. **“Scholar Song, where should we start to familiarize ourselves with the current world?”**

Scholar Song grinned proudly. **“I’m all set. Please follow me, Venerable Bai.”**

Then, Scholar Song led Immortal Sage Bai into the third floor, where he was temporarily staying.

Immortal Sage Bai curiously examined everything in the room — the color screen television, air conditioning, refrigerator, microwave, and other electrical appliances that hadn’t existed one hundred fifty years ago.

These were all remnants left by the previous owner; the Alchemical Sage had been quite generous, and the owner naturally wouldn’t fuss over such trivial things.

Scholar Song opened the computer, logged into the Ninefold Land One group, and opened the group space.

He then pulled out several documents and downloaded them.

1. **The Function and Diagrams of Modern Electrical Appliances — Air Conditioners, Televisions, Computers, Mobile Phones, Refrigerators, Rice Cookers… etc.**

2. **Things Cultivators Need to Pay Attention to in Modern Society: Ten Methods to Quickly Integrate into Society.**

3. **Basic Traffic Safety Rules: Remember not to crash into cars on the road. Attachments: Various car shapes.**

To accommodate Immortal Sage Bai, Scholar Song used software to convert the text into traditional characters.

**“Senior, please take a look at this document first; it includes diagrams and functions of common household electrical appliances. Once you’re familiar with these things, I’ll help you create an account for a chat application, and then the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain can add you to the ‘Ninefold Land One’ group. Oh, and we’ll need to get you an ID card and things like that, and then I’ll arrange a phone and computer for you.”** Scholar Song explained.

**“Let me see!”** Immortal Sage Bai showed great interest as he sat down at the computer and imitated Scholar Song’s movements with the mouse, scrolling through the files with a sense of wonder.

**“Wow, these things are so interesting! This right here is a computer, right? It’s so convenient with so many functions. And this refrigerator! I used to have to rely on large ice houses or ice-type formations to preserve things. And this mobile phone, it’s similar to the sound transmission talisman!”** Immortal Sage Bai’s eyes began to sparkle with excitement.

He had always been interested in ‘mechanical artifacts,’ and the abundance of modern technology before him filled him with a sense of happiness.

**“You take your time; I’ll contact the Ninefold Land One group.”** Scholar Song said.

He logged into the Ninefold Land One group on his phone and found a post in the group space that read, **“Friends who have been in seclusion for over fifty years, if you need to create a legal ID and personal information, please contact (********) — Master of the Snow Wolf Cavern!”**

The Master of the Snow Wolf Cavern also seemed to be a senior who had been lurking for a long time.

Previously, when he had shared a picture of the arrival of Immortal Sage Bai in the group space, the Master of the Snow Wolf Cavern had made an appearance.

**Ninefold Land One Group**

**Scholar Song:** **“@Master of the Snow Wolf Cavern, are you there?”**

The Master of the Snow Wolf Cavern quickly responded, **“Haha, so you need the legal ID and personal information for Venerable Bai? Don’t worry, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain already entrusted me to handle it, and someone will deliver it to you tomorrow.”**

**“The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain really is thorough.”** Scholar Song sighed.

**“Scholar Song, has Venerable Bai emerged from the statue now? How does he feel?”** The Master of the Snow Wolf Cavern immediately inquired.

**“What does he feel?”** Scholar Song thought for a moment and replied, **“Not much feeling, just that Venerable Bai looks even more handsome in person than as a statue.”**

As for Immortal Sage Bai’s ability to ‘stumble upon the ground,’ Scholar Song felt it was better to save face for the senior and gloss over it — after all, he couldn’t bring himself to speak ill of someone behind their back.

**“Oh, oh, good luck, Scholar Song.”** The Master of the Snow Wolf Cavern seemed pleased with Scholar Song’s answer.

Scholar Song was left feeling puzzled.

Then, he cautiously glanced back at Venerable Bai. What was it about him that made the seniors in the group so uneasy?

He had considered the possibility that it was Immortal Sage Bai’s special charm causing it, which would indeed make the male seniors feel awkward. But weren’t there female cultivators in the group too?

Scholar Song was baffled, trying to make sense of it all.
