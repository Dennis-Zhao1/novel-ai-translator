**Walking the Dog**

An hour later, Scholar Song stopped his training.

He felt that today’s results were significantly better than before. Could it be that his newly opened eye aperture was making his body stronger?

But when he opened his heart aperture previously, the effects hadn’t been so noticeable.

At this moment, Scholar Song didn’t realize that the ancient bronze ring on his finger had the effect of condensing spiritual energy. It continuously nourished his body and enhanced his training efficiency.

“Alright, time to head to school.” Scholar Song picked up his treasured sword, Ba Sui, and decided to take a quick shower before heading downstairs.

As he reached the third floor, he spotted the little Pekingese, Dou Dou, already back, happily engrossed in something on the computer.

Venerable White was sitting next to Dou Dou, both of them seriously searching for information online.

“Good morning, Venerable White. Dou Dou, you’re back!” Scholar Song greeted them.

“Good morning, young friend Song.” Venerable White lifted his head, smiling as he nodded—today, Venerable White looked as stunningly handsome as ever. However, there seemed to be a hint of evasion in his gaze when he looked at Scholar Song.

“Early return today, here you go.” Dou Dou didn’t even look up, using its tail to flick something towards Scholar Song.

As Scholar Song instinctively swung his sword to intercept the fast-approaching black object, he executed a smooth slash!

Crack— the black object was effortlessly sliced in half, showcasing the sharpness of Ba Sui.

A second later.

Scholar Song stared at the two halves of the black object on the ground, nearly in tears: “My DSLR camera…”

He had just bought the camera at ‘cost price’ from the store owner, influenced by Venerable White’s charm, and hadn’t even had the chance to use it—now, it lay ruined at his feet.

Dou Dou glanced up at Scholar Song: “Woof, you sliced it yourself, don’t blame me!”

Scholar Song squatted down and painfully gathered the two halves of the camera—sliced neatly down the middle, there was no hope of repair.

“By the way, woof, just a reminder, the footage of my investigation into that handsome yet brawny guy is stored in there. You better check if the memory card is okay. If it’s not, I’m not going to film it again.” Dou Dou continued.

Scholar Song could only silently extract the memory card from the camera, relieved that it was intact.

Sighing, he realized he could only blame his own momentary lapse in judgment.

Scholar Song asked, “So that guy really is problematic?”

“Woof, he’s from the Wuji Demon Sect, trying to steal the blood crystal diamond from you. But he’s just a small fry, a mere front-line minion. You’ll know the details once you watch the video.” Dou Dou replied.

So it really was the Wuji Demon Sect!

“How strong is he?” Scholar Song inquired.

“First Grade, Five Apertures Realm, almost ready to leap through the Dragon Gate.” Dou Dou casually answered.

Scholar Song thought for a moment and asked, “Can I beat him?”

“Hmm… if it’s a head-on confrontation, with your talismans and the spells from the ancient bronze ring, you might have a chance to take him down. But if he ambushes you, you probably won’t have a chance to fight back.” Dou Dou replied.

So, I’m in a very dangerous situation then?

Especially if he might come for me at any moment!

Scholar Song chuckled dryly: “Dou Dou, do you want to go for a walk today?”

“Why, you want to walk me?” Dou Dou looked up at Scholar Song: “Alright, since I’m in a good mood today, I’ll let you walk me!”

As it spoke, Dou Dou tapped on the keyboard, taking down the last minor boss it was fighting, and bid farewell to its online ‘wife’.

“Wait for me, I’ll go change my gear so you can walk me better.” Dou Dou shut down the computer and dashed towards the room.

Scholar Song turned back to Venerable White and asked, “Venerable White, I need to go to class later. Do you have any plans?”

Venerable White chuckled, “I have a little business this morning. I received a call earlier from the street office, they’re asking if there are any transient populations here. They’re currently doing registration, and if there are transients, I’ll need to apply for a temporary residence permit. I’m just waiting for the street office personnel to come by and take my photo for registration.”

“Oh, so it’s time to apply for temporary residence permits again.” Scholar Song nodded, “Then Dou Dou and I will go together! If you need me, just call.”

Venerable White nodded silently, his gaze subtly drifting over to a large box behind him.

That was the ‘loot’ he had fought for all night—one large-screen TV, one water dispenser, two speakers, one rice cooker, and one induction cooker…

Luckily, Scholar Song didn’t discover it.

After Scholar Song left, he would use the ‘disposable flying sword version 004’ to send it into space.

…

…

At 7:30, Scholar Song and Dou Dou set out.

Dou Dou donned a collar, transforming into a small Pekingese, wearing an expression of ‘I bestow upon you’ as it handed the leash to Scholar Song.

So this is really walking a dog?

Scholar Song thought Dou Dou would simply accompany him outside, but he didn’t expect it to actually put on a collar and manifest in a way visible to the human eye.

This made things a bit tricky, as Jiangnan University Town, while quite open, allowed faculty members to keep cats and dogs as pets, but students absolutely could not keep dogs.

Oh well, one step at a time.

If it comes to it, he could always say it was a pet belonging to some teacher, and he was just responsible for walking it. Scholar Song quickly thought of several excuses and took Dou Dou out.

For the first half of the way, Dou Dou was very compliant, truly allowing Scholar Song to walk it instead of the other way around.

However, just as they were nearing Jiangnan University Town, Dou Dou suddenly brightened its eyes and bolted off!

As a powerful demon dog, Dou Dou’s speed was unmatched. Scholar Song had no chance of resisting and was dragged along in a wild sprint, his grievances unspoken.

“Dou Dou, where are you running off to?” Scholar Song chuckled helplessly.

“Woof woof, I found something fun, let me take you to play!” Dou Dou replied in a voice only Scholar Song could hear, using a special telepathic skill.

And so, a cute little Pekingese dashed away, pulling a young student behind it in a comical chase.

Soon, Dou Dou found what it deemed as ‘fun’.

Outside Jiangnan University Town, there was a long river that flowed through the entire area. After generations of care, the river was now clear, with fragrant green grass lining its banks.

At that moment, a serious-looking elderly British man, with meticulously combed hair, was leisurely walking a giant German Shepherd on the grass.

It was none other than Professor Smith, the English professor from Scholar Song’s class. He previously had a cute pet dog, but… due to an incident involving Fay Yu using magic, that pet had bitten the professor.

As a result, the serious old man’s first action upon leaving the hospital was to send his pet dog to a hotpot restaurant to be made into dog meat hotpot.

And this massive German Shepherd was Professor Smith’s new pet.

Dou Dou dragged Scholar Song straight towards Professor Smith.

Seeing that he couldn’t avoid it, Scholar Song forced a smile and greeted, “Good morning, Professor Smith.”

The professor turned his head slightly and nodded at Scholar Song: “Good morning.”

He didn’t recognize Scholar Song; with so many East Asian students, they all looked almost identical to him, and he could hardly remember many.

Scholar Song was about to pull Dou Dou away, but Dou Dou instead dragged him right up to the giant German Shepherd.

“Woof woof!” Dou Dou wagged its tail and barked furiously at the German Shepherd.

The German Shepherd looked down in confusion, its eyes showing puzzlement.

“Woof woof!” Dou Dou continued to bark, turning around to shake its rear at the German Shepherd—“Come on, bite me! Bite me, you mutt!”

This was the voice Scholar Song could hear from Dou Dou.

But the German Shepherd seemed to not understand the challenge and remained confused.

Scholar Song awkwardly chuckled at Professor Smith and yanked on the leash, “Dou Dou, stop messing around, we’re leaving!”

Professor Smith chuckled lightly as he pulled on his own German Shepherd’s leash, preparing to leave as well.

Just then, Dou Dou suddenly jumped up, extending its paw to slap the German Shepherd’s face.

Smack!

The German Shepherd didn’t have time to dodge and got slapped across the face.

“Woof!” The German Shepherd, not known for its gentleness, was enraged that this little creature dared to act so brazenly. It barked loudly and lunged at Dou Dou.

Professor Smith looked at Scholar Song with a twitching mouth—this student of mine, does your little dog have such guts?

Scholar Song felt like he wanted to bury his face in his hands… was bringing Dou Dou out really the right choice?

At that moment, Dou Dou and the German Shepherd were already engaged in a wild tussle, completely out of their owners’ control.

Scholar Song couldn’t rein in Dou Dou at all.

Professor Smith was equally helpless against his crazed German Shepherd.

“Well, I’ll just compensate this student for a bit later. A purebred Pekingese only costs a few thousand yuan.” Professor Smith thought to himself.

Barks echoed, and fur flew.

…

…

One minute later.

The German Shepherd lay on the ground, panting heavily, its fur ruffled and its eyes vacant, staring blankly at the Pekingese standing on its back.

The little Pekingese wore an expression of triumph, turning to Scholar Song: “Woof woof woof~~”

Scholar Song felt like he wanted to hide his face again—beating a normal German Shepherd is nothing to brag about for a powerful demon dog like you!

Professor Smith rubbed his eyes vigorously, wondering if he was getting old and his vision was failing him.

Was my German Shepherd lying on the ground, gasping for breath?

And the one who won was that little Pekingese?

This is not scientific!

Seeing that Scholar Song didn’t praise it, Dou Dou’s mood plummeted. It wagged its tail and quickly dashed back towards Jiangnan University Town.

“Dou Dou, wait for me!” Scholar Song called out, quickly telling Professor Smith, “Professor, I’m sorry, I need to go chase Dou Dou!”

“Go ahead, go ahead.” Professor Smith chuckled.

As Scholar Song and little Dou Dou ran off into the distance, Professor Smith squatted down beside his German Shepherd, examining it closely.

The fur on the ground was all from his German Shepherd, while that Pekingese hadn’t lost a single hair!

The German Shepherd had blood at the corners of its mouth, and there were injuries on its body, but none were bite wounds; they were all from slashes.

“Is the Chinese Pekingese this fierce?” Professor Smith stroked his chin, wondering if he should get a Pekingese as well to see for himself.
