**Strange Dream**

At five o'clock in the afternoon, Scholar Song bid farewell to the Alchemical Sage and returned to the university town.

On the way, he received a text message from Yang De, informing him that the results of the 5,000-meter race in the sports meet were out, and there was no doubt that Scholar Song had clinched the championship. Due to his absence, that guy Gao had excitedly accepted the award on his behalf. He also asked if Scholar Song was back from the pharmacy and whether he wanted to join everyone for dinner.

“Speaking of which, I still owe Yang De a feast of ten fragrant fish heads after the sports meet. This time, I owe it all to his intel; otherwise, the forum master might have slipped away,” Scholar Song thought to himself.

“Also, it's about time I signed up for driving lessons. And... should I get a membership for that chat app? It would speed up my game farm upgrades.”

The game farm was an old game he hadn’t played in a while. Now, he only opened it when he felt like it while on the chat app; otherwise, it lay dormant, left to its own devices.

But now... with so many senior friends in the Ninefold Land group playing this game, Scholar Song found himself reconsidering picking it up again. Who knows, one day a senior might feel generous while playing at home and might give him unexpected benefits just out of good spirits?

Though the chance was slim, it wasn’t impossible. After all, it was just a game farm; investing a bit of time wouldn’t cost much! If he could reap some rewards, it would be worth it.

“There are plenty of things to do,” Scholar Song said as he opened the text reply window and typed back to Yang De: “Just got back. Where are you? I’ll be there soon!”

Then, he jogged back towards the university town.

...

After finishing dinner with his roommates, the four of them had no other plans for the day, so they decided to stay in the dormitory and play games.

So much had happened today—first the morning sports meet, then the long trek to find the forum master, receiving the forum master’s head along the way, and then being dragged to the hospital for a check-up by Zhao Yaya, followed by a series of miscellaneous incidents.

Even though he had received the Blood Qi Pill, Scholar Song didn’t have the energy to try it out. After playing a few rounds of games with his roommates, he climbed into bed early to sleep.

He was indeed quite tired.

Before sleeping, Scholar Song gathered his last bit of spirit and activated his mental alertness technique, placing himself in a state of heightened awareness.

Soon enough… he drifted into slumber.

In the first half of the night, Scholar Song slept soundly.

But in the latter half of the night, he had an intriguing dream.

In the dream, Scholar Song found himself back in ancient China… though he couldn’t tell exactly which era. He could only discern the ancient setting from the clothing of the people and the various buildings around him.

In this dream, he was the son of a coffin shop owner. Perhaps because he was constantly surrounded by coffins, the young version of him in the dream bore a perpetually gloomy expression.

“What a bizarre dream,” he inwardly complained. “They say thoughts during the day manifest in dreams at night, but I certainly haven't thought about any of this during the day!”

As the dream progressed, years passed by. When he was around five or six years old, one day, a Daoist priest with an aura of immortality passed through the small village and immediately recognized his potential, wanting to take him as a disciple.

To everyone’s surprise, he was easily taken under the Daoist’s wing. One could only imagine how heartbroken his coffin-selling father must have felt.

After training with the old Daoist for a few years, he learned that his master was a loose cultivator who had stumbled upon a fragment of a Daoist lineage known as “Ghost Gate Exorcist” and had been cultivating diligently ever since. However, the lineage was incomplete and severely flawed, allowing him to barely step into the second realm.

Years later… the old Daoist was killed.

Due to their ties to “evil ghost cultivation,” they often dealt with vengeful spirits, which ultimately led to his demise, leaving behind no trace of his body.

In the dream, he had to fend for himself.

The old Daoist’s death greatly affected him, making him increasingly cautious. The higher his cultivation, the smaller his courage grew.

His subsequent life experiences resembled those of a typical protagonist in a dark fantasy novel. In pursuit of advancing his realm, he resorted to all sorts of methods to cultivate various malevolent spirits and sought out places rich in ghostly energy.

His greatest aspiration was to find a spiritual ghost, using its unique powers to elevate his cultivation!

During this time, to gather the materials required for cultivating ghostly beings, he had done all sorts of things. For example, he was primarily an exorcist but also moonlighted as a gangster in an assassin organization.

One day, while treasure hunting, he accidentally discovered an ideal location for cultivating ghostly beings—a place called Ghost Lantern Temple. What thrilled him even more was that a spiritual ghost resided within the temple, filling him with immense joy!

[Is this not a dream?] Scholar Song suddenly came to a realization. As he emerged from Ghost Lantern Temple in the dream, he figured this must be the forum master’s memory.

Ghost Lantern Temple, in the Luo Xin district! Was the ghost cultivator ‘him’ the forum master? Why was he dreaming about the forum master? Scholar Song felt puzzled.

The dream continued, and the ‘him’ in the dream felt utterly disappointed after surveying Ghost Lantern Temple.

He had arrived too late; the temple had already been purchased by someone else, who had set up sealing formations around it. From a glance, it was clear the seals were laid down by a powerful individual, and he didn’t dare to break them, fearing retribution from that master.

But how could he ignore such a prime spot for cultivating ghosts and the presence of a spiritual ghost?

A spiritual ghost! This was a spiritual ghost!

While he couldn’t break the formation himself, he could find a scapegoat to do it for him. Although the sealing formation was intricate, if he could identify the formation’s core, he could dismantle it!

And if someone else broke the formation, even if that powerful person showed up afterward, their wrath would only fall upon the scapegoat!

Thus, he disguised himself as a feng shui master, doing everything he could to urge the original owner of Ghost Lantern Temple, Huang Dagen, to demolish the temple and build a graveyard instead.

Huang Dagen had already harbored such thoughts, and with someone urging him on, he became even more motivated. They struck a deal, and the following year, Huang Dagen tore down Ghost Lantern Temple to build a large graveyard for himself.

Ghost Lantern Temple was destroyed, and the graveyard was established.

Under the guidance of the fake feng shui master, Huang Dagen personally carried his tombstone to the graveyard, placing it in a designated ‘feng shui treasure spot’—the very core of the formation that ‘he’ had painstakingly identified in the dream.

As soon as the tombstone was erected, the first layer of the mysterious seal laid down by the powerful individual was immediately broken. The spiritual ghost from Ghost Lantern Temple roared out, draining Huang Dagen’s life essence.

Although Huang Dagen did not die on the spot from having his life essence drained, he felt incredibly weak. After a week of illness, he succumbed to death.

However, the spiritual ghost, having drained Huang Dagen, did not leave but returned to its previous position.

This filled ‘him’ with delight. Although ‘he’ had set up a layer of sealing barriers around Ghost Lantern Temple, the materials needed to construct those barriers were expensive, so he had tried to save where he could. The impact on the barriers would cause material loss, and the fact that the spiritual ghost hadn’t attacked the barrier saved him a significant amount of resources.

After the powerful individual’s formation was shattered, ‘he’ didn’t rush to subdue the spiritual ghost.

First, he feared that the powerful individual might arrive immediately.

Secondly, the spiritual ghost hadn’t matured yet and needed more time to cultivate in the blessed land.

The subsequent events were well-known in the Luo Xin district. Huang Dagen’s family mourned his passing and buried him in the graveyard.

This act further enraged the spiritual ghost!

Taking advantage of the Huang family’s mourning at the grave, the ghost emerged and drained most of their life essence. After returning home, the family began to fall ill one after another.

A year later, the entire family was buried in that grave.

Perhaps after feasting on so much life essence, the spiritual ghost was temporarily satisfied. In the years that followed, those who came to bury Huang Dagen’s family managed to escape this fate.

In the ensuing years, the ‘him’ in the dream settled down in the Luo Xin district, guarding Huang Dagen’s grave and observing the growth of the spiritual ghost.

As the dream reached this point, Scholar Song was left puzzled. Since the formation was broken, why didn’t the forum master take the spiritual ghost when it matured?

What happened next?
