**Tips for Enhancing Mental Strength**

In front of Scholar Song, there was only an office worker uncle, hurrying along with a briefcase tucked under his left arm while fumbling for his phone with his right hand.

As he rummaged through his pocket, Scholar Song noticed a crumpled bundle of cash tumble out and fall to the ground. However, the uncle was completely oblivious and quickly continued on his way.

"Hey, sir, wait a second!" Scholar Song called out, rushing over to pick up the bundle of cash. It looked to be over one hundred fifty dollars, all crumpled together.

He had always been a helpful person. In this mundane and dull world, lending a hand to others had been one of the few joys in Scholar Song's life.

Even now, as he dabbled in the more exciting 'Cultivator World,' he still clung to the pleasure of being helpful.

The office worker, hearing his call, turned around and looked at Scholar Song with a perplexed expression.

"Sir, you dropped your money!" Scholar Song exclaimed, holding up the bundle of bills.

The uncle stared at Scholar Song and the cash in his hands, his face filled with gratitude.

But suddenly, as if struck by a thought, the gratitude twisted into sheer terror.

"Is this a scam?" the uncle murmured, "I just learned online that if someone finds money on the street or claims it’s yours, it’s all a trick. Don’t engage; this old scam won't fool me."

With that, the uncle quickened his pace and hurried off.

Scholar Song, with his enhanced hearing from body refinement, caught every word of the uncle's mumbling.

"Sir, I’m not a scammer! You really dropped this money! Check your pocket!" Scholar Song shouted after him.

To his surprise, the uncle's expression changed even more dramatically. What started as a brisk walk turned into a full-on sprint, and soon he disappeared from sight—'You think you can fool me? Not a chance!'

Scholar Song stood there, waving the money in the air, feeling a bit foolish.

After a moment, he calmly tucked the crumpled bills into his pocket.

If someone else lost something and he picked it up, wouldn’t it count as his now?

But then again... what if one day someone got angry and threw away their wife, and a single guy picked her up? That definitely wouldn’t be considered his either, right?

**7:30 AM**

This was the time when the first class of the day began.

Scholar Song, however, found it impossible to concentrate on the lecture.

He propped up a hefty textbook in front of him as a shield, then logged into the Ninefold Land group chat on his phone, locating the post titled "Preliminary Research on the Optimization of Mental Strength Applications—Drunken Moon Scholar."

In university, professors generally didn’t care whether you paid attention in class or if you were playing on your phone.

However, you definitely shouldn’t be like that clueless guy who takes time during class to like the professor’s posts or pictures. Professors sometimes vent their teaching stress by posting, and if you like their post during class, what message does that send?

It implies they’re not teaching properly, spending class time on social media instead!

Making such a blunder would surely frustrate even the most patient professor.

"Just as the Alchemical Sage said, these are all easy tips to grasp," Scholar Song mused to himself after reading the Drunken Moon Scholar's research report.

Why not take advantage of this free time to try out a few mental strength techniques?

Scholar Song was always the kind of person who acted on his impulses.

Cultivators primarily used mental strength to control and guide external spiritual energy and internal energy. But mental strength was a treasure trove; it was wasteful to use it merely for controlling internal energy.

Each sect had its own secret techniques for developing and applying mental strength. Some unique mental techniques could produce eerie effects, often more lethal than spells or martial arts. When internal energy was depleted but mental strength remained, these techniques could turn the tide in battle.

The Drunken Moon Scholar’s report optimized three simple tips for using mental strength in its early stages.

These included creating a force field that either radiated outward or focused on a specific location for "scouting" purposes.

Another technique allowed the mental strength to maintain a slight activation, which kept the practitioner "alert" while also concealing their presence.

Of course, maintaining this activated state was no easy task, especially while sleeping, so mastering it required extensive practice.

Finally, there was a method to release mental strength in a burst, creating a mental pressure that could intimidate opponents—though this technique should only be used on the weak. If one encountered someone with stronger mental strength, their pressure would seem laughable, akin to a light breeze.

Scouting, alertness, intimidation—these were the optimization tips researched by the Drunken Moon Scholar, suitable even for cultivators in the foundational stage who had just begun to refine their mental strength.

Moreover, these techniques were easy to learn, much like how someone familiar with computers could easily pick up gaming.

"Since I have the time, I should give it a try," Scholar Song thought, feeling a surge of excitement.

After all, aside from the last intimidation technique, both 'mental scouting' and 'alertness' wouldn’t affect anyone else. Even if done in class, it wouldn’t disturb anyone.

Deciding to act on his impulse, Scholar Song quietly activated the "True Self Meditation Sutra." In his mind, his true self sat cross-legged, condensing his spirit into a pure form of mental strength.

Following the tips from the Drunken Moon Scholar’s report, Scholar Song gradually spread his mental strength outward.

When he first used the 'mental scouting' technique, he struggled to focus his mental energy on a specific spot, allowing it to expand in all directions to its maximum distance.

With full effort, his mental strength covered an irregular radius of about five meters.

He closed his eyes, and the surroundings within that five-meter sphere began to flicker in his consciousness.

However, he could only sense larger objects; they needed to be at least the size of a textbook for him to detect them. He still couldn’t perceive smaller creatures like ants or cockroaches.

Moreover, the images of the people he sensed were very abstract, resembling low-resolution photos, their faces blurred and indistinct.

"Is it because my mental strength is still too weak?" Scholar Song pondered. Perhaps when his mental strength grew to a hundred or even a thousand times its current size, he would be able to see everyone’s faces clearly.

Maybe with even stronger mental power, he’d be able to achieve something like x-ray vision?

Lost in thought, he noticed that the students within his five-meter range suddenly shivered in unison.

"Is it getting cold? Why do I feel such a chilling presence and malice?"

"I feel like someone is staring at me with wicked eyes!"

"It feels like I’ve been stripped bare."

"I feel that way too; it’s so disgusting," a female classmate murmured, tightening her collar as a chill ran down her spine.

Scholar Song’s lips twitched as he quickly retracted his 'mental scouting' technique.

Learning to use a computer is one thing, but becoming a gaming expert requires time and effort. The same went for Scholar Song; mastering these techniques would take practice.

Once he withdrew his mental strength, Scholar Song felt slightly fatigued. His mental strength had only just formed yesterday and was still weak, so he couldn’t sustain the 'mental scouting' technique for long.

After a short rest, feeling a bit of recovery in his mental strength, Scholar Song decided to try the 'alertness' technique.

This technique was even easier to grasp. Once his mental strength was activated, Scholar Song entered a fascinating state.

He could feel everything around him, from the gentle breeze blowing through the window to the warmth radiating from his classmates, and even the slight vibrations in the air when someone spoke nearby. Every interaction, whether wind, sound, or heat, was palpable.

However, this 'alert' state lasted less than ten seconds before disappearing due to a sudden distraction in his mind.
