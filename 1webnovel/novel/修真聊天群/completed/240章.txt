**Chapter XX: The Falling Stone**

“Cloud Mist Daoist, what’s going on with you?” 

In the sky, it seemed that the meteor had locked onto Scholar Song, initiating its point-target navigation mode... and it was getting closer.

Scholar Song stared at the meteor, his mind racing as he calculated its landing point.

Suddenly, his eyes widened in disbelief!

“Did I see that wrong?” Scholar Song rubbed his eyes. In the hazy distance beneath the meteor, he thought he saw a shadowy figure.

He blinked hard, activating the blood energy in his eye orifices to enhance his vision.

No, he hadn’t been mistaken! There was indeed a person beneath the meteor!

And it was someone he recognized—Cloud Mist Daoist, who had just crossed his mind. This was the same figure who had been trapped under the ‘Five Finger Mountain Sealing Forbidden Land’ by the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

At that moment, Cloud Mist Daoist was lying on his side, having been directly struck by the meteor. Half of his face was swollen and bloodied, and his entire body bore injuries. Flames from the meteor enveloped him, and his clothing had almost completely burned away.

“It’s strange. According to the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, Cloud Mist Daoist is a fifth-tier Spirit Emperor, a powerful being who has condensed his life’s golden core. Why isn’t he flying out from beneath the meteor? Why is he just taking the hit?” Scholar Song wondered.

Could it be that this meteor was a treasure?

...

...

Scholar Song was mistaken; Cloud Mist Daoist wasn’t choosing not to fly out from under the meteor—he simply couldn’t! He had passed out.

Yes, how absurd it was that a fifth-tier Spirit Emperor, a being who had condensed a golden core, could be knocked out cold by a mere meteor!

It was as ridiculous as a muscular black uncle walking down the street, only to be knocked unconscious by an ant dropping from a tree!

What on earth had happened?

Time rewinds to just a few minutes earlier...

At that time, Cloud Mist Daoist, feeling the immense pressure of the ominous sign above him, abandoned his plans to enjoy a lavish time in ‘Wenzhou City’ and decided to fly directly over it towards the headquarters of the Empty Thief Sect.

However, as he approached ‘Wenzhou City,’ he suddenly felt a shadow overhead, accompanied by a rush of hot air.

When he looked up, he froze in shock.

A massive meteor, five meters long and seven meters wide, was flaming down towards him from ten meters above, descending at an incredibly high speed!

And bizarrely, he hadn’t sensed its approach at all; it seemed to have broken through spatial limitations, appearing out of nowhere!

Normally, with Cloud Mist Daoist’s fifth-tier golden core Spirit Emperor level, he would have sensed such a large meteor from ten thousand meters away.

But this meteor approached him silently, completely blocking his senses and instincts.

It wasn't until the meteor was within ten meters of him that he finally noticed!

“Damn it, is this that fool Yellow Mountain using magic to plot against me?” was the first thought that crossed Cloud Mist Daoist’s mind!

How could such a large meteor come so close without him sensing it? It had to be because someone had cast a spell to interfere with his perception.

“But Yellow Mountain, you underestimate me! A mere meteor? Watch me shatter it with a single sword strike!” Cloud Mist Daoist sneered inwardly.

During the years of his imprisonment, he had diligently cultivated. Even without elixirs, he had solidly condensed his golden core and become a fifth-tier Spirit Emperor. Although the time it took was incredibly long, his foundation was solid, making him far stronger than a fifth-tier Spirit Emperor who relied on pills for quick advancement!

A meteor of this caliber was something he could easily shatter with a sword!

“Draw the sword!” Cloud Mist Daoist shouted, stepping into the void. The sword pellet beneath his feet rose, coalescing into a massive sword aura over ten meters long, slicing fiercely towards the meteor!

Boom!

The sword aura slammed into the meteor...

The massive meteor was instantly shattered into countless pieces!

A triumphant smile spread across Cloud Mist Daoist’s face.

However, before he could fully enjoy his victory, from the last fragment of the meteor, a hidden sword aura was unleashed, targeting Cloud Mist Daoist.

That sword aura was terrifying!

Cloud Mist Daoist could barely catch a glimpse of a flash of sword light.

Then… there was nothing after that; he fainted!

In that fleeting moment before losing consciousness, he could only think: “Yellow Mountain, damn you! Playing dirty!”

As Cloud Mist Daoist collapsed, the sword pellet, having a spirit of its own, flew back to his side, guarding him.

Moments later, the meteor smashed down mercilessly upon him, sending him crashing to the ground.

...

...

Meanwhile, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, who had been misunderstood, was currently staring dumbfounded at a mirror in front of him.

The mirror connected to the hidden mark on Cloud Mist Daoist, displaying his every move.

Through the mirror, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain watched as Cloud Mist Daoist was knocked out and sent flying by the sudden meteor, and he couldn’t help but swallow hard.

—This kind of sudden meteor, appearing silently and striking with lightning speed, was something he remembered well!

It had happened hundreds of years ago when he was still a young lad, tasked with welcoming then-True Monarch Venerable White out of seclusion.

While introducing the changes of the era to Venerable White on the way, a meteor had suddenly fallen beside him, nearly crushing him to death.

That meteor, which almost killed him, had behaved similarly—sneaking up silently like an assassin. Before you had time to react, you were already in the meteor's attacking range.

Zzzzz...

Suddenly, the mirror screen darkened.

The hidden mark left on Cloud Mist Daoist by the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain was destroyed along with the meteor and that strange sword aura.

He lost track of Cloud Mist Daoist.

“Cloud Mist Daoist, he won’t end up dead, will he?” the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain thought silently.

After all this time spent playing with him, building multiple aliases to chat with him, if he died, it would leave him feeling somewhat lost!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Boom!

In the end, the meteor landed just over a meter in front of Scholar Song, creating a large crater in the ground.

“Cough!” The unconscious Cloud Mist Daoist spat out a mouthful of old blood, his head drooping as he fainted again.

“…” Scholar Song looked at this poor disciple of the Empty Thief Sect—he had passed out!

It seemed that everyone he encountered from the Empty Thief Sect was rather unfortunate.

This Cloud Mist Daoist had gotten caught stealing and ended up being suppressed by the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain for two hundred years. Just as he had finally escaped, he got knocked out by a meteor.

“The concept of luck is profound and mysterious. But luck certainly exists!” Scholar Song mused inwardly.

If Venerable White represented the epitome of luck, then this Cloud Mist Daoist was undoubtedly a representation of mediocre luck.

Scholar Song looked around; this area was quite desolate. The main road passed through an uninhabited wilderness, bordered by undeveloped yellow earth, with no passersby.

So, Scholar Song approached the remaining pieces of the meteor.

The meteor, which Cloud Mist Daoist had shattered, now only left behind a fragment about the size of a table.

Cloud Mist Daoist was trapped beneath it, occasionally groaning instinctively.

The flames on the meteor had already extinguished.

Scholar Song reached out and gently touched the meteor, finding that despite the flames having just gone out, it felt icy cold to the touch.

He then gripped the meteor, channeling all the blood energy from his orifices to lift it.

“Hmm, it’s much lighter than I expected,” Scholar Song murmured as he began to carry the meteor towards his tractor.

After all, this was a fallen meteor; whether it was a treasure or not, bringing it back could only be a good thing.

Thankfully, it had been Venerable White’s whim to take a tractor out today. If he had come with any other vehicle, he wouldn’t have been able to move this meteor at all.

After all, this meteor was about the size of a table and nearly a meter high!

Once he placed the meteor onto the tractor, Scholar Song clapped his hands together.

Just now, he felt like he sensed a hint of Venerable White's aura from the meteor.

“Was it left behind when I moved the meteor?” Scholar Song scratched his head.

He then turned around to pick up the unconscious Cloud Mist Daoist and carried him onto the tractor as well.

Even if this Cloud Mist Daoist was a bit of a fool, they had shared a moment, so it was only right to help him out. If worse came to worst, he could always inform the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain to take him back.

The sword pellet in Cloud Mist Daoist’s arms trembled slightly, but sensing that Scholar Song meant no harm, it returned to its calm state.

Once everything was settled...

Scholar Song climbed into the driver’s seat of the tractor.

Vroom, vroom... rumble, rumble...

The tractor belched black smoke as it continued to race down the wide road.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In Wenzhou City, on White Whale Road, at Scholar Song's home.

Father Song and Old Lu had both gotten a bit tipsy, and they began to boast wildly. They talked about how amazing they were in their youth, how they could take on three or four opponents in a fight, and how great their sons and daughters-in-law were. They were on a roll with their stories.

It had gone on for so long that even Lu Tianyou, sitting beside them, found it unbearable.

In the kitchen, Mother Song prepared a few more snacks, turning to Lu Tianyou and saying, “Tianyou, don’t mind these two. You go rest in the living room. I’ll handle them.”

“Sure, Auntie,” Lu Tianyou replied with a forced smile, tidying up his bowl and chopsticks before heading to the living room.

He then sighed in relief as he sat on the sofa.

Accompanying his dad to Scholar Song’s house had been a grievous mistake!

...

...

Meanwhile, Father Song and Old Lu had no self-awareness at all, their faces flushed as they struggled to articulate their words.

At that moment, Father Song’s phone rang.

He fished around in his pocket for a while before pulling out his phone.

Without even checking who was calling, he answered and shouted, “Hello, who’s this?”

“Dad, it’s me!” Scholar Song’s voice came from the other end: “Have you been drinking?”

“Oh? Old Lu, that shameless guy came over for a visit, so I had a few drinks with him. What’s up?” Father Song said loudly.

“I’m on my way home. I’ll be there in about ten minutes,” Scholar Song replied with a chuckle.

“Oh, you’re coming home, huh?” Father Song rubbed his temples hard.

Why not come back earlier or later, but right at this moment?

He cautiously glanced at Old Lu beside him.

His liver was about to burst from the pressure!
