**Venerable Bai**

But Scholar Song quickly realized—this wasn’t because his opponent’s punches were weak; it was because he had become stronger.

The body-enhancing liquid had pushed his physical strength to the very limit of what a human could achieve. After training with the Foundation Establishment Fist, his fundamental physical qualities had changed dramatically.

At that moment, Nan Haomeng burst into an excited laugh. “You’re really a true master! What a powerful claw technique!”

With his fist caught, he couldn't pull it back in time, so without hesitation, he lifted his leg and delivered a powerful knee strike.

In traditional sanda (Chinese kickboxing), such a move would naturally be forbidden, but Nan Haomeng wasn’t in a sanda competition now. Despite his large frame and somewhat goofy smile, he was no fool. In a fight, it was all about using whatever worked!

With a sigh, Scholar Song flicked his hand upward, his fingers curling into a dragon’s claw—his claws danced like a dragon, both grabbing and twirling.

It wasn’t just the dragon’s claw that danced; it was also the prey that was caught.

In an instant, Nan Haomeng felt his sturdy body—over two hundred pounds—being flung off the ground!

And all of this was done with just one arm.

His heart skipped a beat; what terrifying strength! The fact that this guy could toss not just his small brother but even someone as hefty as him around with one arm was ridiculous!

But I won’t go down so easily!

“Roar!” Nan Haomeng bellowed, forcing himself down as he tried to make his body crash back to the ground. At the same time, he pulled his right hand back, ready to unleash a storm of attacks as soon as he landed.

However, at that moment, Scholar Song struck again.

Foundation Establishment Fist, version two. His fists moved like shooting stars, delivering a flurry of punches—over a dozen strikes landed continuously on Nan Haomeng’s body.

The speed was so fast that it exceeded Nan Haomeng’s ability to react. Thus, the big guy found himself helplessly acting as a punching bag in mid-air.

When Scholar Song threw his punches, he didn’t whisper the “Fist Technique Mantra.” 

One, he didn’t have the time. Two, if he invoked the mantra and infused his punches with spiritual energy, he might just punch a hole right through Nan Haomeng.

In that case, what awaited Scholar Song would be a prison sentence.

If luck was particularly bad, he might end up with a daisy inside and a sunflower outside.

Besides, he deliberately held back half of his strength when he punched.

Even so, his punches—enhanced by physical enhancement—were terrifyingly heavy. The barrage of strikes left Nan Haomeng dazed.

Nan Haomeng... face-planted!

Scholar Song retracted his fists and let out a deep breath, feeling a bit like a master.

Rubbing his body, Nan Haomeng groaned in pain and asked, “What kind of fighting style is that? Is it ancient martial arts from Huaxia?”

“Foundation Establishment Fist, version two.” Scholar Song's tone was unexpectedly serious.

“Foundation Establishment Fist 2? What the hell is that?” Nan Haomeng blurted out!

At that moment, Scholar Song felt a wave of melancholy. If he could, he’d love to have a name that sounded impressive and intimidating. Unfortunately, he was destined to be disconnected from such cool names.

Seeing Scholar Song’s displeased expression, Nan Haomeng quickly admitted defeat: “I give up!”

He sighed, realizing that they were simply not on the same level. He had innate strength, but the other’s power surpassed even his!

He had solid sanda skills, yet Scholar Song’s fist techniques seemed far superior.

“Wise choice.” Scholar Song nodded. “Now, according to the rules, you need to pay the price for losing the challenge.”

Nan Haomeng shrugged nonchalantly. “I don’t have any money.”

He held his head high, thinking that if it came down to it, he could just take another beating. With no money to give, he still had his life! He absolutely refused to encourage such extortion and bad behavior.

“I don’t need money.” Scholar Song said, though internally he was thinking he could definitely use some cash right now. “I need you to help me find out some things.”

A single person’s power was limited; the ungrateful had their own channels for information.

Perhaps he could find out about the people who investigated him yesterday through them.

Though he had already decided to seek help from the Alchemical Sage, it couldn’t hurt to be more prepared!

……

A moment later.

Nan Haomeng scratched his head. “You want me to help you find out about the guy who investigated you yesterday at noon?”

Actually, this kind of task wasn’t too difficult. He just needed to figure out which classmate the investigator had questioned, and from there, he could deduce the investigator’s appearance and slowly work out their identity. If that didn’t work, he could even access the surveillance footage at the school gate; he had some connections in the school.

But why should he help Scholar Song after losing a fight? He just came to seek a brawl, and he hadn’t agreed to help out if he lost—he could just fight again!

“You will help me, right? Senior Nan!” Scholar Song crouched beside Nan Haomeng, his eyes squinted, revealing a hint of danger.

If Nan Haomeng dared to utter a single “no,” it would be the end for him!

Nan Haomeng’s expression changed drastically. He scratched his head and forced a smile. “I get it. I’ll get those useless guys and their friends to handle this. But I can’t guarantee we’ll find anything.”

He had a nagging feeling that if he didn’t agree just now… it would have been disastrous!

Scholar Song revealed a satisfied smile. “Then I’ll count on you, Senior Nan!”

……

After the fight, Scholar Song felt completely refreshed. Not only had the bout loosened his muscles, but it also deepened his understanding of the “Foundation Establishment Fist.”

This kind of understanding was different from the forced teachings in the “Illusory Space.” The insights gained from real combat were much more flexible, allowing Scholar Song to execute the “Foundation Establishment Fist” more efficiently in the future, conserving energy while generating more vital energy!

Real combat was always far more effective than just training behind closed doors!

“Maybe I should find more opponents and practice my fist technique? Hm, I’ll jot this down and ask the Alchemical Sage tomorrow if practical experience holds any significance for me at this stage.” Scholar Song thought to himself.

Upon reaching his dormitory smoothly, Scholar Song habitually opened the Ninefold Land Group chat.

There were plenty of messages in the group.

First, from earlier in the afternoon, the Alchemical Sage had shared chat records about Scholar Song exchanging two types of Foundation Establishment techniques.

Then, just two minutes ago, a message from the Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram appeared: “Let me calculate the time, it should be about time for ‘Venerable Bai’ to end his 150-year seclusion soon, right?”

The Hermit of North River sent a “stiff” emoji and after a while said, “Venerable Bai is a madman when it comes to seclusion; he’s truly a role model for us. After he comes out, he should be quite close to becoming a Seventh-Rank Spiritual Sovereign. I bet it won’t be long before we have to call him Venerable Bai!”

“The most important question is, will Venerable Bai contact us after he comes out? If so, who will go to meet him?” a group member with the ID “Drunken Moon Scholar” chimed in.

Scholar Song felt that the name Drunken Moon Scholar sounded familiar; he seemed to often pop up in the group but was always overshadowed and easily forgotten.

As soon as Drunken Moon Scholar finished speaking, the group fell silent.

After a while, the Hermit of North River said, “I’ll go first; last time I went to pick up Venerable Bai. This time, it definitely can’t be me!”

His tone implied that meeting the reclusive Venerable Bai was a daunting task? Even the warm-hearted Hermit of North River was scared?

The Wild Blade of Three Tides suddenly jumped in: “I feel like my own realm is about to break through, so I’m preparing to go into seclusion for a few years. Everyone, stay out of my way!”

“You’re kidding, right? You only just reached the late stage of Spiritual Emperor; you’ve got ages before you can break through.” The Hermit of North River replied with a sarcastic expression.

“I’ve had some fortunate encounters recently, so my realm is going to soar. Believe it or not, I do! Anyway, I’m going into seclusion now, so don’t bother me for anything.” The Wild Blade of Three Tides insisted.

“Why the rush?” The Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram said calmly: “Venerable Bai isn’t coming out immediately; there’s still a long time ahead. When the time comes, everything will sort itself out.”

“Diviner, do you already have a plan?” the Hermit of North River asked.

The Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram replied, “Heh heh, I have my own plans. But I absolutely won’t tell you, North River; just give up on that idea.”

Damn it! The Hermit of North River clenched his fists, thinking, “Three months from now, at the Battle of the Purple Forbidden Peak, I will definitely teach this diviner a lesson, making him unrecognizable!”

Scholar Song, skimming through the chat log, was just about to chime in to show he was present. But for some reason, as the Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram hinted at having a “brilliant plan,” he felt a chill run from his forehead down to his toes.

He had a premonition that if he spoke up now, he would be inviting trouble upon himself.

Thus, Scholar Song shook his head vigorously and closed his laptop, climbing into bed to sleep.
