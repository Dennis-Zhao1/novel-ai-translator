**Cultivator's Daily Report**

At the intersection of the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean lies a mysterious island that has never appeared on any world map. This island is shrouded in supernatural forces, preventing human exploration; even the most advanced technology cannot detect any trace of its existence.

Welcome to the domain of the Revered Spirit Butterfly—the Spirit Butterfly Island.

Countless large, colorful butterflies flutter through the sky above, marking this island's distinctive charm.

Among them, a butterfly the size of a basin descended gracefully, landing in front of a young girl. On its back rested a... newspaper.

Yes, a newspaper.

"Thank you for your hard work." Fay Yu reached out to accept the publication from the butterfly’s back. She sat on a stone bench in a pavilion, her long hair tied neatly in a bun.

It was an ordinary newspaper, no different from the ones found in the market, but its contents held a hint of the fantastical.

**Today's Headline**: The renowned Sword Sect's Southern Long-Life Sword Sect's leader had a spat with his partner the day before yesterday and declared he would sever ties. By the time of publication, reliable sources reported that the sect leader had spent an entire day kneeling on “Boundless Golden King Durian,” shouting “I was wrong, please forgive me” a thousand times.

The Southern Long-Life Sword Sect's leader was known for his robust, macho personality, a real man's man with a substantial fanbase among female cultivators. In stark contrast, his partner was known for her gentle disposition.

So, this juicy gossip naturally made headlines.

Other sections warned that the “Mad Demon Overlord” from the Boundless Devil Sect was active in the eastern lands of Huaxia, urging everyone to stay vigilant for safety. Disciples of the Boundless Devil Sect were notorious for their extreme personalities; however, “Mad Demon Overlord” was a rare breed among them—harmless, as long as no one provoked him. Yet, he possessed an innate quality that seemed to invite trouble. Even quietly munching on a skewer of lamb could draw adversaries his way. It was not the first time a simple skewer of meat had led to chaos…

Additionally, there were reports of cultivators who struck it rich gambling on the cutting of spirit stones, getting rich overnight.

And then there was a great cultivator who crossed the vast ocean to challenge the local deities in the West, seizing some treasures. Over the past few years, those indigenous deities had been inexplicably assaulted, leaving them bewildered.

There was even a dedicated section for cultivators to post wanted ads for the acquisition, sale, or trade of precious materials. As long as the price was right, or if someone desired a particular treasure, they could directly contact the owner or use the newspaper as a middleman for transactions.

This was a special newspaper for cultivators, different from human publications; it was casual and freeform. Gossip, intelligence, transactions, danger alerts—everything could be found within.

"Hey? Is this the ‘Floating Mysterious Island’ I've heard people mentioning lately?" Fay Yu's eyes sparkled with excitement as she stumbled upon a captivating piece of news.

The report stated that cultivators had recently spotted the legendary “Mysterious Island Floating in the Sky” over the East China Sea, with hints of vibrant flora and fauna, and even extinct species thriving within.

No one knew if it was a cave heaven left behind by an ancient ancestor or a special realm within a realm—perhaps fragments of the world?

Such places were always rife with both danger and opportunity, making them perfect for exploration.

The cultivator who had spotted it only managed to take a few pictures before the mysterious island vanished once more.

“The East China Sea isn’t too far from here,” Fay mused, her heart racing with the thought of sneaking out for an adventure.

She crossed her long legs, slightly lifting her delicate foot, the translucent toes peeking out from the stylish sandals—a pair that Scholar Song had bought her just days prior.

“Fay Yu, what are you looking at?” A gentle, steady voice interrupted her thoughts. A handsome middle-aged man appeared behind her, radiating an unexplainable charm—this was the Revered Spirit Butterfly, the master of Spirit Butterfly Island.

“I’m reading today’s Cultivator’s Daily Report. Oh, Father! I found a really fun place; how about you accompany me for a little adventure while you have some free time?” Fay's eyes sparkled with anticipation as she held the newspaper close.

“Another outing, huh?” The Revered Spirit Butterfly raised an eyebrow, a loving smile breaking across his face. “But over the next few days, you need to familiarize yourself with the ‘Contract Array’ of the Phantom Spirit. Only when you’ve completed the contract with the Phantom Spirit can we talk about going out. You did agree to this, didn’t you? You wouldn’t want to break your word, right?”

After her recent escapade, her father hadn’t scolded her but had instead set conditions—anything she brought back, she would have to handle herself. Until she formed a contract with the Phantom Spirit, she was to stay on Spirit Butterfly Island.

“We’re not people who break promises! Once we say it, a hundred horses couldn’t chase it back!” Fay declared with determination, though her expression quickly soured. She had no idea that signing a contract with the Phantom Spirit would be so complicated. She had already failed several times.

“Then give it your all,” the Revered Spirit Butterfly said, his gaze drifting down to her sandals.

They appeared somewhat old-fashioned, akin to cheap street merchandise.

He had never seen her wear these shoes before—she must have bought them during her recent adventure to catch the Phantom Spirit.

Though they weren't the most fashionable, it was her first time buying something for herself; he felt it was only right to offer a bit of praise and encouragement.

He was a good father.

With that in mind, the Revered Spirit Butterfly put on an expert's smile and nodded. “When did you buy those sandals, Fay? You truly are my daughter; your taste is quite commendable!”

The smile on the Revered Spirit Butterfly’s face faltered slightly. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t find any fancy words to praise the shoes that looked like they came from a bargain bin.

“Hehe, you think they’re nice too, Father?” Fay giggled, lifting her foot playfully. “These were bought for me by Scholar Song after my last attempt to catch the Phantom Spirit; my previous pair broke during the chase. He really is impressive and fun, even has a good eye for buying things—he picked out shoes that you find acceptable!”

The Revered Spirit Butterfly felt his smile freeze, a knot tightening in his chest like he had swallowed something bitter.

Scholar Song—wasn’t he the one who had helped her during her Phantom Spirit hunt?

His daughter seemed to care a lot about this Scholar Song.

Most importantly, Scholar Song was a man!

His eldest disciple, Liu Jianyi, apparently hadn’t communicated certain things clearly; that lazy bum needed a good talking to!

Thinking about that slacker made the Revered Spirit Butterfly’s mouth twitch. That guy was so lazy he’d even tried to cultivate a breathing technique called “Turtle Breathing,” promoting some ridiculous concept of saving energy. The Revered Spirit Butterfly couldn’t help but wonder how he had ever chosen such a disciple.

Oh no! The more he thought about that lazy bum, the more frustrated he became!

At this rate, he might need to consider keeping some “Rescue Heart Pills” on hand or something.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On the way back to school, Scholar Song pondered how to find opportunities for practical experience—perhaps running into trouble with some unruly characters daily?

Additionally, around four or five in the afternoon, he needed to carve out time to practice the “Diamond Basic Fist Form.”

With his current physique, it would take nearly twenty-three hours for his vital energy to recover to a level suitable for practicing the fist form.

In other words, he could only practice once a day at this stage. If he wanted to complete his foundation within a hundred days, he had to seize every opportunity and waste no time.

Of course, the recovery speed of one’s vital energy would increase as their strength grew. Once he reached the late stages of the first tier, he could easily practice over ten times a day.

Moreover, to accelerate the recovery of vital energy, he could take pills like the “Vital Energy Pill.” The Hermit of North River had once introduced Scholar Song to the Vital Energy Pill, which was made from extremely precious herbs—a genuine first-tier pill, unlike the “Body Refining Liquid,” which was just a potion.

After consuming one, within half an hour, it could completely restore the vital energy of a foundation-building cultivator like Scholar Song.

This kind of pill was not only useful for foundation builders but also for first-tier cultivators when opening their meridians, as they required a significant amount of vital energy pills to boost their internal energy.

If only he could get his hands on such a vital energy pill, he would be able to establish his foundation sooner. Then, he might stand a better chance against assassins, right? Right now, he desperately needed strength.

He felt... a bit greedy.

As he walked, he unknowingly found himself back in the chaotic alleys of the Big Fortune District.

Today, he didn’t see that short-haired girl who had been pinned against the wall. Perhaps it was still too early, and she hadn’t woken up yet?

There weren’t many pedestrians in the alley.

It was eerily quiet.
