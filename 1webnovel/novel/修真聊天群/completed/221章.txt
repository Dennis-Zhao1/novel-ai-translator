**A Pekingese Flying a Plane!**

Scholar Song dragged Instructor Li along and successfully left the space station.

Outside the space station, Venerable White waved to him, holding a spacesuit in hand.

Just moments ago, Venerable White had used a spell from afar to knock out everyone inside the space capsule, allowing Scholar Song to bring Instructor Li out without a hitch.

Meanwhile, Venerable White took a different route, claiming he had some matters to attend to.

Scholar Song discreetly glanced at the spacesuit in Venerable White's hands. Surely, the task he mentioned wouldn’t involve just casually taking a spacesuit, right?

“We’ve picked up the person; let’s leave. It feels a bit awkward staying here,” Venerable White communicated through his mind. After all, they had crashed into someone else's space station and left a big hole in it.

As he spoke, Venerable White activated a sword technique. A ‘plane-shaped disposable flying sword’ swooped in, landing steadily in front of Scholar Song.

Scholar Song pulled Instructor Li into the aircraft shell and tied him securely with a rope—he couldn’t afford to let him float away this time.

Then he squeezed into the back seat of the aircraft shell and asked, “By the way, Venerable White, should we delete the footage from the space station’s surveillance?”

Sound cannot travel in space.

However, while Scholar Song spoke, Venerable White could perceive his words through spiritual awareness. Conversely, Venerable White's voice could directly enter Scholar Song’s mind through ‘mind communication.’

Their communication in space posed no issues.

Both Scholar Song and Venerable White were protected by spells, meaning they wouldn’t show up in any surveillance footage. But Instructor Li was different; he lacked any protective formations. The entire process, from floating next to the space station to being pulled inside by the two astronauts, had been captured on camera.

“Haha, I’ve just deleted nearly an hour’s worth of surveillance footage from the space station… But I’m not sure how often this space station maintains contact with the ground. If it’s continuous, then perhaps the footage from that hour has already been sent back down. Well, honestly, even if the surveillance footage reaches the ground, it wouldn’t matter.” Venerable White chuckled, “While I was hypnotizing the people in the space capsule, I casually cast a memory-erasing spell. They will forget everything from the past one or two hours. When they wake up, they won’t remember having encountered ‘Instructor Li.’ So even if there are surveillance videos on the ground, the two astronauts will have absolutely no recollection, leading to speculation over what bizarre event transpired.”

After all, there are plenty of similar cosmic tales out there.

Like the rumors about a shadow seen on Mars a few years back; astronauts spotting something resembling an alien spacecraft zipping by; and the alleged man-made structures on the moon.

Many of those stories even have photos and videos as evidence, but so what? Who would believe in them on Earth?

They’re just talked about for a while before becoming a laughingstock. Some countries or individuals might be unwilling to let it go, trying to invest resources to get to the bottom of it, but they’re bound to find nothing of value.

“Alright, let’s find a place to have some fun. Oh, here’s this suit for you, wear it! With this, your astronaut dream will finally come true.” Venerable White handed the spacesuit to Scholar Song.

My astronaut dream?

Scholar Song took the spacesuit, feeling both touched and guilty.

He was touched that Venerable White remembered his ‘astronaut’ dream.

He felt guilty because… his ‘astronaut dream’ had been a fib.

Well, not exactly a fib; deep down, he truly wished to wear an astronaut suit and experience space firsthand. So he might as well take this chance to enjoy it!

“Thank you, Venerable!” Scholar Song expressed his gratitude.

“No need to thank me,” Venerable White squinted his eyes, looking quite pleased.

…

…

Scholar Song donned the spacesuit. Although it felt bulky, it was surprisingly comfortable.

Venerable White guided the flying sword through space.

After about half an hour, they finally found a suitably sized meteorite.

The helicopter shell landed on the meteorite, and Scholar Song, wearing the heavy spacesuit, held onto the small meteorite while striking various poses as Venerable White snapped numerous photos.

Then it was Venerable White’s turn on the meteorite, sitting cross-legged with one hand supporting his chin in a thoughtful pose.

Scholar Song also took many pictures of Venerable White.

Before they knew it, they had spent nearly an hour playing on that small meteorite.

Finally, Venerable White squinted and smiled, “Did you have fun?”

“Of course, I did!” Scholar Song grinned.

“Good! Then let’s head back.” Venerable White smiled lightly, his gaze lowered.

Having spent quite some time with Scholar Song, he had subconsciously grasped a lot of modern knowledge. Next, after guiding Scholar Song on some cultivation matters, he planned to bid farewell.

All good things must come to an end; this trip to space could be seen as his way of repaying Scholar Song for his care over these past few days.

“Alright, let’s go back!” Scholar Song stretched.

Honestly, once immersed in it and not worrying about this and that, the experience of space travel was incredible!

They crawled back into the aircraft shell, and Venerable White raised a protective shield outside.

Then he activated the ‘plane-shaped disposable flying sword,’ and with a whoosh, they dove toward the blue planet Earth…

As the sword energy surged, the meteorite they had been playing on was sliced in two by the sword’s wake.

One half continued to drift through space, while the other broke free from its original trajectory and leisurely headed toward Earth. Perhaps one day it would be caught by Earth’s gravity, becoming a shooting star.

**Middle Land, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain’s Cave.**

Fairy Lychee maintained her radiant smile, “Well then, Venerable, until we meet again!”

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain laughed heartily behind her, waving, “Be careful on your journey, ah, haha!”

Once Fairy Lychee had flown out of sight, the Immortal Sage’s cheerful expression twisted into an unsettling grin, “Dou Dou!! You’re dead! When I catch you, no one will be able to save you!”

Just as the Immortal Sage gritted his teeth, his phone rang.

Checking the screen, it was a call from Kaissali at the Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center.

What could Kaissali want from him?

Could it be that Scholar Song and Venerable White ran into some trouble?

The Immortal Sage answered the call, “Hello, Ms. Kaissali, what’s the matter?”

“Hello, Mr. Huang Wenzhong,” Kaissali’s voice was filled with anxiety, almost as if she were crying, “I have something to report regarding Mr. Scholar Song and Mr. White.”

“They didn’t cause any trouble, did they? Did they break any planes? Don’t worry about it, I’ll replace any models they might have damaged after the fact,” the Immortal Sage assured in a grand manner.

“No, it’s not that,” Kaissali replied urgently, “About three hours ago, our instructor Li took Mr. White out for a test flight. However, partway through, the helicopter suddenly lost signal… and we haven’t heard from them since. I’m quite worried; could they have had an accident? Should we expand the search area?”

“…” The corner of the Immortal Sage’s mouth twitched. Three hours without a signal?

Could it be that Scholar Song’s friend had actually flown into space as he jokingly suggested?

That can't be right; it’s just a helicopter. It’s not likely they could reach space unless Venerable White had modified the aircraft.

“Ahem, you don’t need to worry about them. I’ll contact them shortly, so rest assured, even if something happens, I won’t hold you responsible. Leave everything to me,” the Immortal Sage promised.

His powerful assurance calmed Kaissali down a bit.

“Also, Mr. Huang Wenzhong, there’s possibly another issue I need to report to you,” Kaissali stammered.

Another issue? Aside from Scholar Song and Venerable White, what other chaos could arise at the airport?

“It’s like this… just ten minutes ago, another plane inexplicably took off from the airport. But our flying instructor isn’t on board,” Kaissali paused before continuing.

Upon hearing this, the Immortal Sage suddenly felt a sense of dread.

“You might not believe what I’m about to say, and honestly, I wouldn’t believe it myself if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes. But I have to tell you—there was no one on that plane, just a Pekingese! Mr. Huang Wenzhong, please believe us; we have no intention of damaging the aircraft to extort money from you. In fact, this Pekingese is currently flying the helicopter in the air, and we can provide you with a video to prove we’re not lying!” Kaissali nearly broke into tears.

Who would believe a Pekingese flying a helicopter in the sky? And it was circling around several times!

“…” The Immortal Sage gritted his teeth. Dou Dou!! I’m going to skin you alive!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In the sky, Dou Dou skillfully maneuvered the helicopter, spinning around in the air, more adept with each rotation.

“Hahaha, Huang Shan must be dumbfounded right now! You wouldn’t let me drive a car, so I just took a plane instead, hahahaha!” Dou Dou reveled in its triumph.

The dog hair Dou Dou gifted to Scholar Song was the real entity, while the ‘Dou Dou’ that had been shaking was merely a clone.

Dou Dou had transformed into dog hair, listening to various theories about flying while nestled in Scholar Song’s pocket, observing the instructor teach Scholar Song how to fly.

As soon as Scholar Song changed into his spacesuit, Dou Dou quietly slipped away, seizing the opportunity to climb into a helicopter.

And thus, this wild scene unfolded…
