**The Primitive Man Who Can Recite the Three Character Classic**

“Don't casually and recklessly use 'The Master said'. If that demon finds out, our palms will be slapped red! And we are not cannibals, so stop fantasizing about meat!” The leader-like primitive man added, speaking in awkward, stuttering Chinese.

The slightly chubby primitive man shrank back after being harshly slapped by the leader, seemingly recalling the terror of that ‘demon’, and he didn’t dare to make a sound.

Then, the leader waved his hand again and continued in his broken Chinese, “First, move all of them back!”

Thus, a group of primitive men began to carry, hug, lift, or shoulder the unconscious passengers, hauling them back.

……

……

Not long after.

The passengers gradually woke up from their stupor.

As they opened their eyes, they found themselves lying in a gigantic grass hut. Surrounding them was a large group of humans with reddish-brown skin, their faces painted with various colors.

These people wore animal skins and wielded an assortment of weapons, some even donned terrifying, grotesque masks… They seemed to have emerged from a ‘sealed time’, exuding a primitive and savage aura.

Seeing the sharp weapons in the hands of these primitive men, the passengers gasped and swallowed hard.

Soon, the passengers exchanged glances, not daring to speak.

“I remember... we were on a plane, flying in the air, right? How did we suddenly end up in this strange place?” Tu Bo whispered to a certain Gao.

Gao shrugged with a wry smile, carefully holding his girlfriend, Mei Yi, in his arms—surely these primitive men weren’t cannibals, right?

Ordinary people's impression of primitive men mostly comes from movies and television, where they often appear as cannibals. This led the passengers to immediately associate them with ‘cannibalistic tribes’ upon seeing them.

“Could it be… that we’ve traveled through time?” Lu Fei, who was squeezed in with them, speculated quietly.

Lu Fei’s sister: “…”

At this moment, Scholar Song's nominal disciple, Joseph, clenched his fists tightly. He cautiously protected his daughter, Ji Shuangxue, while a myriad of thoughts raced through his mind.

Were these primitive men friends or foes?

If they were enemies, the passengers here were unarmed, while the others were armed to the teeth. It didn’t look like they had much of a chance.

Perhaps, it was time for him to put into practice the unparalleled martial arts taught by his master!

Joseph gripped his fists tightly.

He had absolute confidence in his master, Scholar Song—he believed that the martial arts taught by his master, who could explode air with a mere flick of his hand, were indeed extraordinary skills.

Even though he had only trained for a little over a month, Joseph felt significantly stronger!

Huh? Why does this scene feel… familiar?

Suddenly, a strange sense of déjà vu filled Joseph's mind, as if he had witnessed a similar situation before—perhaps in a dream or in the past?

Why was he feeling this peculiar sense of déjà vu? Joseph pondered.

Wait… where’s my master?

His master had boarded the plane with him!

Joseph hurriedly looked around for his master, but he couldn’t find Scholar Song anywhere.

Where did he go?

Not just Joseph, Gao, Tu Bo, and the Zhuge siblings quickly noticed that Scholar Song was missing too…

“Where’s Scholar Song? Where did he go?” Tu Bo asked quietly.

“Isn’t he in the crowd?” Gao squinted, a bit confused since he couldn’t see clearly without his glasses. He looked around but genuinely couldn’t find Scholar Song.

Lu Fei whispered, “I haven’t seen Scholar Song either. Could he have gotten separated from us?”

Gao frowned in concern, “Everyone from the plane is here, how could he be the only one missing?”

Everyone immediately thought of things like ‘cannibals’ and hoped Scholar Song hadn’t been the first one captured to be cooked and eaten!

Tu Bo and the others grew increasingly worried.

At the same time, passengers near the captain were nervously asking, “Captain, did our plane crash? How did we end up here?”

The captain was equally baffled, shaking his head in silence, unsure how to respond—who knows what on earth happened!

Just a second ago, he was calmly flying the plane, and the next moment he suddenly lost consciousness… Now he woke up surrounded by primitive men. There hadn’t even been a moment to cushion the shock.

“We didn’t have any kind of accident; I suspect we might have really traveled through time,” one of the flight attendants whispered.

“Or maybe it’s not time travel; perhaps we just crashed and ended up on an uncharted island lost in a vast ocean, still undiscovered by humanity,” spoke a white-haired professor.

Just as the passengers were whispering amongst themselves, the primitive men, holding their weapons and wearing their animal skins, suddenly split into two lines and stood in formation.

Then, the primitive men straightened their backs.

Next, a female primitive man opened her mouth and exclaimed, “At the beginning of humanity, nature is inherently good!”

With that, she recited in perfect Mandarin the classic Chinese text *The Three Character Classic*, her voice melodious and clear.

As she spoke, all the passengers on the plane were left dumbfounded.

Then, the other primitive men immediately chimed in unison: “At the beginning of humanity, nature is inherently good. Human nature is similar, but habits are different. If not taught, nature will change. The way to teach is to value focus. In ancient times, Meng Mu chose a neighbor. If the child doesn’t study, the loom is broken…”

Their voices stumbled and sounded a bit awkward, but everyone could understand—it was indeed the standard content of *The Three Character Classic*.

“Pfft…” Lu Fei, who had a more carefree demeanor, found it extremely amusing to see a group of primitive men reciting *The Three Character Classic* with such serious expressions, and she couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

Her laughter was bright and pleasant.

One of the primitive men close to her turned his head out of curiosity upon hearing her laughter. Then… he stumbled over his words!

“Stop!” At that moment, a commanding voice came from outside.

Then, a man dressed in a black trench coat, about six feet tall, walked in with his hands behind his back.

The primitive men’s faces turned rigid at the sight of the man in the black coat, and they didn’t dare to breathe too loudly, seemingly afraid of this trench-coated figure.

The man in the black coat walked into the grass hut and approached the primitive man who had stumbled over his words. He then raised his right hand to reveal a thick ruler.

The primitive man who had stumbled knew he couldn’t escape, his face filled with despair as he cautiously extended both of his hands.

“Smack!” The man in the black coat showed no mercy, striking the primitive man's palm with the ruler…
