**The Terrified Forum Master**

"That's true. You chose the path of a loose cultivator, and in the early stages, you'll need a lot from the mundane world. Whether it's fitness equipment for your cultivation, places to practice, or medicinal herbs that normal people can easily obtain, you'll require a substantial amount of worldly wealth. In the hierarchy of resources, 'wealth' is the most significant," the Alchemical Sage laughed heartily. However, when he spoke of 'wealth,' he didn't mean ordinary money. He was referring more to the treasures and rare materials that practitioners traded among themselves, such as precious herbs, high-quality elixirs, and magical artifacts.

"I don't know what kind of financial resources others in the group have, but I can definitely share some ways to earn wealth with you. As for me, worldly money has become somewhat inconsequential," the Alchemical Sage chuckled. "Once you successfully establish your foundation, I’ll teach you some methods to concoct elixirs that are of little use to cultivators but incredibly beneficial to ordinary people. By then, I’ll help you flaunt your skills—oh no, I mean, I’ll help you make money and soar!"

Scholar Song’s eyes lit up at that.

"So, senior, do I need to do anything to help you?" Scholar Song asked, understanding the group’s customs. There’s always a give-and-take. Even yesterday, when the Hermit of North River wanted to gift him foundational cultivation methods, it was still considered a 'prepayment.'

"Haha, has young friend Scholar Song already adapted so quickly to the trading ways of Ninefold Land Group?" the Alchemical Sage grinned. "That said, when I established this money-making channel back in the day, it wasn't primarily for wealth. More importantly, it was to obtain twenty types of unique deep-sea herbs from the other party every year. Here’s the deal: after a while, I’ll teach you how to concoct an interesting elixir. Then, you’ll be responsible for trading some every year. In return, you’ll give me forty percent of the herbs and worldly wealth you receive, and the remaining sixty percent will be your reward for working with me. We’ll discuss the specifics after you establish your foundation."

Scholar Song didn’t know how much the sixty percent of worldly wealth the Alchemical Sage mentioned would amount to, but he gladly accepted the offer.

The two chatted and walked along.

Before long, they arrived at the alley in the Da Ji district where Scholar Song had heroically rescued a damsel the day before.

"Hmm?" The Alchemical Sage suddenly stopped.

He whipped around, fixing his sharp gaze on the depths of the alley, his eyes glinting like a sword that could pierce the soul!

"What’s wrong, senior?" Scholar Song asked, puzzled.

After a moment, the Alchemical Sage turned back, smiling. "Nothing, just some annoying tailgaters. Every time I go out, there are always some younger folks who like to follow me around. They either want to find a chance to get close, hoping I’ll help them concoct some elixirs, or they’re trying to see if I’m out searching for precious herbs, hoping to snatch some leftovers. Because these foolish folks are so bothersome, I’ve taken to relocating even the most ordinary Morning Dew Mysterious Grass whenever I find a good place to dig for herbs. I won’t leave them a single strand!"

So the Alchemical Sage is like a human treasure detector? He always knows where to find herbs?

No wonder people would follow him around trying to scavenge.

It was clear that the Alchemical Sage harbored a great deal of resentment towards these tailgaters.

……

……

In the depths of the alley, a frail figure leaned against the wall, trembling hands pulling out a cigarette, silently lighting it. A bitter smile crept onto his face—a smile so full of despair that even from a hundred miles away, one could feel the bitterness emanating from it.

It was none other than the forum master, whose life experiences could fill a tragic novel.

"What an intimidating aura; this pressure is already the result of a gap in true energy quality."

The moment he locked eyes with the Alchemical Sage, he felt as if he were on the brink of death.

The forum master had traced Scholar Song's steps to the Jiangnan region. He wanted to obtain a Phantom Spirit, as Scholar Song and Fay Yu each possessed one.

However, he had given up on the Phantom Spirit that belonged to Fay Yu.

That girl had traveled a long way for her Phantom Spirit and was determined to get it. Moreover, she was powerful and wealthy, and the forum master believed that even if he kneeled and offered all his possessions, she wouldn’t spare him a glance. There was simply no chance of obtaining the Phantom Spirit from her.

As for forcibly seizing it? That thought never even crossed the forum master’s mind. He felt that even if ten versions of himself teamed up, they wouldn’t stand a chance against that girl.

Instead, that enigmatic 'Senior Song' seemed indifferent to the Phantom Spirit. Initially, he had only accepted it because Fay Yu requested it three times. Perhaps this 'Senior Song' was so powerful that he didn’t care for the Phantom Spirit. If that were the case, maybe he really had a chance to trade for it!

The forum master held a glimmer of hope and secretly sent someone to follow Scholar Song.

He instructed his subordinates to gather as much information about 'Senior Song' as possible, hoping to find out if the senior was in need of anything so he could cater to their desires and exchange for the Phantom Spirit.

A day later, the details on 'Senior Song' were quickly delivered to the forum master.

Scholar Song, male, 18 years old. A freshman in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Jiangnan University, majoring in Mechanical Design and Manufacturing, previously graduated from Lin Luo No. 1 High School.

Currently residing in Jiangnan University Town.

An ordinary young man; the personal information noted that he had no criminal record and was a helpful student.

When the forum master saw the enigmatic 'Senior Song's' profile, he was utterly stunned.

Was he seeing things? Was this information real? Was this the profile of a 'cultivator' instead of an ordinary male college student?

"Is this profile fake?" The thought flashed through his mind immediately.

He stared at the profile for what felt like an eternity. The two-inch photo showed a young man with a gentle smile, unmistakably that 'Senior Song.'

The forum master held the profile, lost in thought.

His mind was a storm of confusion, with a myriad of thoughts swirling.

In the end, he decided to follow Scholar Song personally.

He needed to confirm whether his subordinate’s information was accurate—was Scholar Song a powerful cultivator or merely a mortal?

If this 'Senior Song' was indeed just an ordinary person, retrieving the Phantom Spirit would be a piece of cake!

The forum master swore to himself that if Scholar Song was just a mortal, he would skin him alive and then extract his soul, refining it into a vengeful spirit! This was the only way to vent the fear that had haunted him for days.

Thus, he personally made his way to Jiangnan University Town.

Upon arriving in Jiangnan, he happened to see Scholar Song walking alongside a rather trendy-looking boy sporting a unique hairstyle.

He carefully trailed behind, making sure to conceal his presence. After all, until he determined whether Scholar Song was a powerful senior or a mortal, he needed to be cautious.

He felt he was doing well at hiding because Scholar Song and the trendy boy didn’t seem to notice him.

He planned to observe Scholar Song for a few days before finding an opportunity to test him to see if he was a cultivator or a mortal! That was his strategy.

However, just as he was feeling pleased with his stealth, the trendy boy walking alongside Scholar Song turned around and fixed his gaze on him.

Those smoky-eyed, sharp eyes were as piercing as a sword! That look was like a hawk surveying a field of plump quails from the clouds.

Or like an ancient demon god, looking down with a grin at the ants beneath his fingers.

It was terrifying; what kind of being was this?!

The forum master was already a timid and cautious person, and the longer he lived, the more cautious he became.

He was scared out of his wits.

After finishing a cigarette, the forum master’s trembling hands slowly calmed down.

No matter how frightened he was, he still had to face the situation head-on.

After forcefully extinguishing the cigarette butt, he forced himself to calm down: "As long as I find the Phantom Spirit this time, I’ll return to my hometown in the far north and focus on my cultivation."

But first, he would wait for Scholar Song and that terrifying trendy boy to separate before seizing the opportunity to act.

Waiting for the right moment...
