**Has the Hermit of North River Lost His Memory?**

Scholar Song found himself sprawled awkwardly on the back of a flying sword, lacking any semblance of grace. 

The ideal was lush and full, but the harsh reality kept smacking him in the face, time and again, teaching him the harsh lessons of life. It was continually crushing his dreams of soaring through the skies on a sword with style.

If it weren't for the powerful gravitational pull of the sword’s trajectory, he would have already been flung off due to the sheer speed at which it was flying. 

“Venerable White, even if you’re using a flying sword to send messages, couldn’t you at least set up a wind-resistant barrier? I’m a person, not a piece of cargo!” Scholar Song lamented, tears streaming down his face.

With the sword racing through the air at breakneck speed, he could only brace himself against the immense pressure of the wind. If he weren’t already a first-tier, two-portal cultivator, the stress of the rapid flight and lack of oxygen would have been enough to knock him out cold.

Beyond the “fast enough” advantage, he couldn’t find any other redeeming qualities in Venerable White’s method of transport.

And besides… he couldn’t shake the feeling that, aside from his fear of heights, he might also be developing a new phobia—fear of speed, perhaps?

Time passed, though it felt like an eternity. Eventually, he arrived at his destination.

His hair had transformed into a wild, broom-like mess. Thankfully, it wasn’t as long as the Alchemical Sage’s; otherwise, he would have been sporting an outrageous, explosive hairstyle.

As the flying sword’s speed gradually decreased, it prepared for landing.

Once again, he was relieved that the landing method wasn’t bungee-jumping style; otherwise, his legs would have turned to jelly again.

…

…

At Tuba’s grandfather’s house.

Tuba was idly scrolling through a mobile game, clutching his phone. “Where on earth has Scholar Song disappeared to? He wouldn’t really have been kidnapped, would he?”

It didn’t make sense that Scholar Song, who never smoked, would venture out at such an hour claiming he was going to buy cigarettes.

“Ten more minutes. If he doesn’t show up, I might have to consider calling the police,” Tuba thought to himself, his mind racing with worries.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In the small courtyard of Tuba’s grandfather’s house.

Two small-time thieves stealthily approached Scholar Song’s “lady’s car.” They shone flashlights inside before quickly switching them off.

“There’s a big box and a large package. This is a lady’s car; there could be some good stuff inside,” whispered Thief A.

There was a higher chance of finding valuable items in a woman’s vehicle than in a man’s.

Thief B subtly waved his hand, lifting a brick: “I’ll smash the window, and you grab the package and box as fast as you can.”

“Don’t worry! I checked this lady’s car online, and the alarm system seems outdated. Sometimes, when the window gets smashed, the alarm doesn’t even go off,” Thief A chuckled darkly.

Thief B raised the brick, ready to strike the window! Just then, something fell from the sky, hurtling toward him.

Then… Thief B was sent flying.

His thin body soared five meters before colliding with the wall of Tuba’s grandfather’s house.

Thief A stood frozen, mouth agape, unable to utter a sound.

What the hell just happened?

“Ah, finally landed safely!” Scholar Song exclaimed, giving a slight flick to the exhausted flying sword and catching it in his hand.

“Ahhhhh!” Only then did Thief A’s screams pierce the air.

He felt as if he’d been hit by a rampaging bull, every bone in his body felt like it was about to shatter.

Scholar Song glanced at them, “Oh, are you guys thieves?”

Thief B widened his eyes, revealing a menacing expression as he pulled out a small knife. “If you don’t want to die, then—”

Before he could finish, he felt darkness engulf him.

A hard fist crashed into his eye socket. He screamed as he was sent flying, crashing into the wall of Tuba’s grandfather's house, following in his companion's footsteps.

The two thieves lay tangled together, moaning in pain.

“You guys showed up just in time!” Scholar Song thought to himself—having these two thieves around would provide him with the perfect excuse when Tuba inevitably asked why he was out in the middle of the night!

Perfect!

“What’s going on?” Tuba’s voice called from upstairs as he poked his head out.

“Tuba, it’s me! I just ran into two little thieves!” Scholar Song waved, grinning.

“What? Thieves? Hahaha! It’s been ages since we’ve had thieves in Luo Xin Street,” Tuba exclaimed excitedly, then shouted, “Grandpa, we caught a thief!”

“What? Thieves? How dare they! Let’s catch them!!” Tuba’s grandfather roared, his voice booming through the house.

Before long, Tuba, his grandfather, grandmother, Li Yangde, and several neighbors rushed out, fiercely determined.

“Where are the thieves?” Tuba’s grandfather bellowed.

In Luo Xin Street, most families were related by blood, so when a thief was discovered, it was like assembling an army.

It was rare for thieves to escape once they were caught.

The last thief caught, upon seeing the police, had even shed tears of joy.

“They’re over there, by the wall,” Scholar Song replied with a laugh.

Then… without a second thought, the neighbors rushed in, delivering a flurry of punches and kicks.

Someone yelled, “Who has some rope? Let’s tie them up and take them to the station!”

“I’ve got some rope!” another man shouted, quickly producing a long length of rope.

He expertly tied the two little thieves’ hands together, then pulled tightly, wrapping the rope around their feet too, and continued wrapping more around them.

It looked like he was binding crabs rather than thieves.

“Don’t bother tying their feet; we need them to walk to the police station. And why bind them so much? Do you think they’re crabs?” someone chimed in.

“Is he really a crab seller?” 

“...I’m just used to it!” the rope-tying man chuckled awkwardly.

Once finished, Tuba, his grandfather, and the neighbors dragged the bruised thieves toward the village’s nearby police station.

Thanks to these two thieves providing cover, Scholar Song’s late-night outing was swept under the rug.

…

…

After spending two days at Tuba’s grandfather’s house, Scholar Song and Yangde bid farewell to Tuba’s family and set off back to Jiangnan University Town, while Tuba decided to stay and enjoy a few more days.

As the lady’s car rolled out slowly, it was filled to the brim with two large boxes of bayberries—Scholar Song’s spoils from his visit.

Tuba’s grandfather waved enthusiastically, watching Scholar Song and Yangde leave.

Ever since Scholar Song arrived, the strange occurrences in the village had ceased, and even many frail elders had gradually regained their strength.

That was wonderful.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Back in Jiangnan University Town, after dropping Yangde off, Scholar Song drove to the Alchemical Sage’s building.

“Venerable White, Doudou, I’m back!” Scholar Song called as he lugged two boxes and a large package upstairs.

Upon entering the house, he paused.

Staring at the oddly familiar yet strange sight before him, he stepped back to check the building number—it was indeed the five-story building the Alchemical Sage had bought.

But the interior was… completely renovated.

Every aspect, from the walls, ceilings, lights, to all the appliances and digital products, had been upgraded.

Scholar Song’s mouth twitched; had he really only been gone for two days?

At that moment, Venerable White’s figure quickly appeared beside Scholar Song.

“Haha, Scholar, what do you think of the new decor?” Venerable White asked, a hint of embarrassment and eagerness in his eyes.

Scholar Song blinked, and after a moment, managed to nod and squeeze out a single word: “Good!”

From a purely decorative perspective—if the original decor was worth a million, then this new decoration could easily be worth ten million, everything was so lavish…

Thus, Scholar Song could only muster a “good.”

As for why Venerable White had decided to renovate the entire place… Scholar Song felt he didn’t need to ask. The combination of embarrassment and eagerness on Venerable White’s face told him everything.

Venerable White sighed in relief.

Scholar Song opened his mouth, intending to remind Venerable White that this house belonged to the Alchemical Sage, and his satisfaction didn’t matter. But seeing Venerable White’s relieved expression, he felt a pang of compassion and decided against it.

“By the way, Venerable. I brought gifts from my classmate’s house. Want to try some?” Scholar Song opened the bottom box, revealing plump bayberries that looked absolutely delicious.

Venerable White tasted one, his eyes narrowing in delight. “Mmm, tasty!”

“Yeah, we picked them ourselves. It was a lot of fun. Next time, I’ll take you along. And since summer vacation is here, I can take you around the country to explore. Staying cooped up in Jiangnan, you’ll miss out on so many interesting places,” Scholar Song suggested with a smile.

“Great!” Venerable White’s eyes lit up. “And how about we learn to fly a plane in a few days!”

“Absolutely!” Scholar Song replied with a beaming smile, though internally he thought—before learning to fly, should I ask Venerable Huangshan for an “astronaut suit”?

He was genuinely worried that Venerable White might get a little carried away and end up taking off into space!

Better to be prepared.

Just then, the Pekingese named Doudou dashed out from the house, leaping toward Scholar Song. “Scholar, I heard you ran into the Fool of Huangshan the other day?”

Scholar Song caught the leaping Doudou and replied, “Yeah, I ran into the Immortal Sage of Huangshan.”

“Did he say when he would come to pick me up?” Doudou asked eagerly.

In the past, whenever Doudou ran away from home, the Immortal Sage of Huangshan would be the first to rush out looking for him. But this time, it had been almost a month, and Huangshan still hadn’t come to get him, leaving him feeling a bit out of sorts.

“Ahem, the Immortal Sage said he would come to pick you up after he captures that Cloud Fog Taoist from the Empty Thief Gate and seals him,” Scholar Song replied honestly.

“Going to catch that annoying Cloud Fog again?” Doudou growled, showing his teeth. “That Fool of Huangshan is really ignoring me!”

Scholar Song chuckled awkwardly.

“Well, let’s not talk about that Fool of Huangshan. By the way, why weren’t you online yesterday? Something happened in the group,” Doudou said, hopping down from Scholar Song.

“Because my phone died yesterday, and I forgot to bring my charger on this trip,” Scholar Song explained. “The elders didn’t try to contact me, did they?”

Feeling a bit embarrassed, he recalled how the elders had loaded his phone with ten million credits just to make sure they could reach him. He hadn’t expected to forget his charger this time.

“Seriously, you should learn a little emergency spell called ‘Charging Technique’ from the Alchemical Sage when he gets back. You’ve already mastered the Heart Lightning, so the Charging Technique should be a piece of cake for you,” Doudou suggested, hopping away.

Charging Technique? Was there really such a magical spell?

It seemed the elders in the group were quite dedicated to preparing for situations where their phones or computers suddenly died while they were out.

As Scholar and Doudou chatted, Venerable White held the large box with a pleasant demeanor, savoring the bayberries as he trailed behind them.

Scholar Song made his way to the main hall upstairs, first putting aside the medicinal materials, three million yuan, and the spoils he had obtained from the Master of the Scenic Path.

Then he pulled out his laptop, smoothly logging onto the “Ninefold Land One” group to check the message records.

The first message was from the previous afternoon.

The first was from Fay Yu, dated at two PM yesterday.

**Fay Yu:** “@Scholar Song—are you there? I finally synchronized with the Phantom Spirit! Are you on break yet? Let’s find a chance to go play on the Mysterious Island!”

This girl had been in seclusion for over half a month and had finally completed the “consciousness synchronization and energy sharing” with her Phantom Spirit.

From now on, her Phantom Spirit would purify her true qi at all times, doubling her cultivation speed and providing double the true qi storage.

Moreover, she had fulfilled the promise made with her father and could finally go out to play on the island. So, she immediately thought of the Mysterious Island and Scholar Song.

Unfortunately, Scholar Song’s phone had just died at that time.

But soon, someone in the group replied to Fay Yu.

**Hermit of North River:** “Yo, Fay Yu, well done! You managed to synchronize with the Phantom Spirit so quickly after getting it?”

It was the long-missed Hermit of North River! He finally returned from the Mysterious Island?

This “Ninefold Land One” permanent online saint warrior was always the first to reply to everyone’s inquiries in the group. If it were an ancient forum, he would be the first to grab the best spot.

Seeing that he could still chat happily in the group, it seemed their time on the Mysterious Island had been uneventful; Scholar Song thought to himself.

He clicked the mouse and flipped through the group chat records.

Next was still Hermit of North River’s message: “Are you planning to go to the Mysterious Island too? I’ve made plans with the Wild Blade of Three Tides and the Ancient Lake View to explore the ‘Mysterious Island.’ Do you want to go?”

Scholar Song’s hand froze—wait a second! Didn’t you guys enter the Mysterious Island twenty days ago?

How could it turn into a plan to go together again?

Did he lose his memory?
