How Terrifying is a Senior Who Can Fall Flat on Their Face?

At this moment, the 'Sound Transmitting Flute' in Scholar Song's hand echoed with the voice of Immortal Sage. "Scholar Song, are you there? I was feeling quite bored, so I decided to do some cultivation... Now, I have no idea where I’ve been taken. Can you find me? I’m about to exit the statue’s protective shell."

Scholar Song couldn’t help but chuckle. "Hello, Immortal Sage! I’m right next to you."

"…." Immortal Sage felt quite embarrassed.

"Senior, you can come out without worry. By the way, should I dodge when you burst out of the statue?" Scholar Song asked.

"Just retreat ten meters. I can control the explosion’s force," Immortal Sage confidently replied.

Ten meters? Scholar Song took about twenty steps back, thinking that should be about right. But then he turned to see the demon dog, Dou Dou, calmly retreating a hundred meters away, its tail wagging left and right.

Recalling Immortal Sage's confident tone, Scholar Song glanced at Dou Dou's serene expression. Without hesitation, he quickly joined Dou Dou and retreated to a hundred meters!

"At least you have some brains, woof!" Dou Dou chuckled.

"I just figured you must have a reason for running that far. But Immortal Sage seemed so confident, and with a master like him, he should be able to perfectly control the explosion, right? Why did you retreat all the way to a hundred meters?" Scholar Song whispered.

"Hehe, did I say he couldn't control the explosion?" Dou Dou wagged its tail. "I’m dodging other stuff to avoid being caught in Immortal Sage's mishap!"

Just as they were speaking, the statue that Immortal Sage had transformed into suddenly erupted with a deafening explosion!

The spectacle was impressive, akin to a mountain cannon going off, shaking the very ground beneath them.

Yet, Immortal Sage's control was extraordinary; the fragments of the exploded statue, although propelled outward, all fell to the ground within a ten-meter radius.

As the statue's shell shattered, the true form of Immortal Sage emerged.

He looked like a celestial being, with long, flowing black hair cascading behind him, eyes shining like stars, and a white robe that danced gracefully in the aftershock of the explosion. The intricate formations etched into his robe pulsed with energy, giving him an ethereal aura.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but marvel—compared to the ‘illusion’ he had seen of Immortal Sage at the nameless temple, this real-life presence was far more divine.

Furthermore, it was remarkable that even after being in seclusion for over a hundred and fifty years, his hair remained jet-black and smooth. And that white robe—still pristine after all that time!

Scholar Song mused that perhaps a cultivator at such a level could remain untainted by the dust of the world. But what about that robe? Could there really be a legendary ‘cleansing spell’? Or perhaps a ‘purification charm’? 

If such a spell existed, how wonderful would that be? No need to wash clothes, just a quick incantation and—voila!—they’d be as good as new! Especially during winter, when hand-washing clothes left his fingers numb from the cold.

Getting sidetracked.

Scholar Song stared at Immortal Sage—if he could control the explosion's damage to within ten meters, why had Dou Dou retreated a hundred meters away?

At that moment, Immortal Sage raised a hand and performed a Daoist gesture from afar. "Hello, Scholar Song!"

Having never encountered such etiquette before, Scholar Song mimicked Immortal Sage's gesture. "Hello, Immortal Sage."

"Where shall we go next? After a hundred and fifty years in seclusion, I feel like the outside world has changed immensely. The vehicle dragging my statue, those things that appear to be houses, and the clothing styles; in just over a hundred years, the changes are greater than in the past millennium!" Immortal Sage smiled lightly.

That smile was simply enchanting, making it hard for anyone to look away!

"Let’s head to Jiangnan University Town first. If you don’t mind, Immortal Sage, you can stay in one of the buildings that the Alchemical Sage purchased while I help you get acquainted with modern things," Scholar Song suggested.

"Sure, I’ll follow your lead, Scholar Song." Immortal Sage smiled again, his charm radiating brightly!

Then his gaze fell on the Pekingese dog, Dou Dou. "Little Dou Dou, long time no see."

"Woof woof! Long time no see, Immortal Sage!" Dou Dou barked cheerfully.

Immortal Sage then asked, "How is the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain doing?"

"He's doing great, preparing to break through to the seventh rank," Dou Dou replied, gritting its teeth at the mention of the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

"That’s wonderful! A talented and hardworking cultivator like him will surely succeed in advancing to the sage realm," Immortal Sage said, before walking towards Scholar Song.

As they walked, Immortal Sage seemed to drift off into thought, his eyes glazed over.

“Oh no, Immortal Sage is zoning out!” Dou Dou's fur bristled with concern.

"?" Scholar Song was puzzled.

Before he could react, Immortal Sage suddenly tripped as if caught by something, crashing to the ground!

Scholar Song was certain there hadn’t been any obstacles on the ground!

In other words, this was the divine skill known as "falling flat on the ground"!

If an ordinary person were to trip and fall, they would simply get up and dust themselves off, perhaps with a few scrapes at most.

But if someone of Immortal Sage's caliber fell flat…

Boom!!

The explosion was deafening, even louder than when Immortal Sage burst from the statue.

Dust and debris flew into the air from where Immortal Sage had fallen.

After a moment, Scholar Song's eyes widened as he saw a large crater where Immortal Sage landed! It was as deep as a meteorite impact crater!

Dou Dou swallowed hard: "A hundred and fifty years in seclusion is no joke; this crater is massive. Good thing I retreated a hundred meters; otherwise, I’d have fallen into that pit. Looking at the size of this bottomless hole, perhaps… Immortal Sage is no longer just Immortal Sage but has transformed into a Sage-level being?"

Scholar Song gulped. "Dou Dou, tell me honestly, does Immortal Sage often trip and fall?"

"Well, rest assured!" Dou Dou reassured. "Immortal Sage only trips when he’s lost in thought."

But Dou Dou would never tell Scholar Song that Immortal Sage could zone out at any moment, sometimes hundreds of times a day!

"When he zones out, he might trip?" Scholar Song instantly pictured a scene—what if one day, while walking with Immortal Sage and explaining modern concepts, the sage zoned out and fell?

Boom!

Assuming Immortal Sage was about 1.82 meters tall, and ignoring other factors, how much of a psychological shadow would that cast on Scholar Song as he watched Immortal Sage fall?

At that moment, it might only be described as 'the ground caving in'!

He needed to remember to keep an eye on Immortal Sage’s state at all times, absolutely preventing him from accidentally falling flat.

A zoning out senior isn’t scary.

A powerful senior isn’t scary either.

A senior who can fall flat isn’t scary.

But a powerful senior who falls flat when zoning out is downright terrifying! That’s the true meaning of a walking artillery shell ready to fire at any moment!

The damage output is off the charts!

"Eh?" Just then, Immortal Sage stood up from the crater, brushing off his clothes as if nothing had happened. His robe remained as pristine white as snow, suggesting it indeed had some sort of 'self-cleaning' feature.

"I was just thinking about something from my seclusion and zoned out, hehe," Immortal Sage said, smiling awkwardly at Scholar Song and Dou Dou.

Then, with a finger raised to his forehead, he declared, "Soil Leveling Spell!"

At his command, the earth around the crater began to shift, quickly filling in the hole. Scholar Song could tell from Immortal Sage's adeptness that this ‘Soil Leveling Spell’ must have been used many times before!

...

After filling the hole, Immortal Sage said, "Alright, all done. Shall we go?"

"Of course, Senior! Dou Dou and I will lead the way; just follow us!" Scholar Song replied.

Dou Dou silently expanded its form to five meters long, allowing Scholar Song to climb onto its back.

"Wait! I should ride Dou Dou too," Immortal Sage suddenly said. "My life sword was stolen while I was in seclusion, so I can't fly with it. Once I get familiar with modern things with you, Scholar Song, I’ll go retrieve my sword!"

Scholar Song: "…"

His life sword was stolen? Senior, what exactly happened during your seclusion?

Dou Dou's face twitched as well, ultimately letting out a sigh and expanding its body even more.

Immortal Sage laughed heartily, gracefully leaping onto Dou Dou’s back. "Thanks for the hard work, Little Dou Dou! Once I reopen the treasures, I’ll bring you some tasty treats."

Dou Dou immediately responded, "I want a thousand-year-old red fruit!"

"Not a problem, I’ll check how many fruits the trees have grown in the past hundred and fifty years," Immortal Sage agreed readily.

Dou Dou was satisfied as it soared into the sky with Scholar Song and Immortal Sage, heading towards Jiangnan University Town.

...

Along the way, Scholar Song asked curiously, "By the way, Senior, how did you end up in that statue during your seclusion?"

"It's a long story; my seclusion place was destroyed due to an accident," Immortal Sage sighed.

Dou Dou asked in confusion, "Wasn’t there at least three hundred layers of defense around your half-seclusion? What kind of accident could destroy it?"

"It was the heavenly tribulation," Immortal Sage shrugged. "Just over fifty years into my seclusion, I suddenly broke through, and then the heavenly tribulation struck! The power of that tribulation was immense; within just a few minutes, it obliterated my three hundred layers of defense, and my seclusion place was left in ruins."

Going into seclusion and suddenly breaking through? That’s both fortunate and tragic!
