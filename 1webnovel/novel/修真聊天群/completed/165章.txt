**Phantom Spirit Mutation!**

Just as Scholar Song sought help from Venerable White, the energy of the "Five Elements Spirit-Constructing Altar" was completely depleted!

With the formation's binding gone, the Phantom Spirit broke free!

Under normal circumstances, the depletion of the 'Ghost Dragon Essence' in the formation would have meant the Phantom Spirit should be pulled back into the 'Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl.' But now, something strange had happened—the Phantom Spirit, without the support of the 'Ghost Dragon Essence,' was still able to maintain its form!

After breaking the formation, the Phantom Spirit let out a roar and charged fiercely at Scholar Song! It clearly remembered that this human had cruelly tormented it with the formation, and it vowed to shred this human to pieces!

Facing the aggressive Phantom Spirit, Scholar Song remained calm. He clenched his right fist and threw a heavy punch towards the charging spirit: "Basic Fist Technique, One!"

The Phantom Spirit howled and met his attack with a straightforward heavy punch of its own.

Boom! The two forces collided head-on!

Scholar Song was jolted back, stumbling seven or eight steps before he steadied himself; meanwhile, the Phantom Spirit merely leaned back slightly, showcasing the vast difference in their strengths.

Rubbing his sore fist, Scholar Song kept his eyes fixed on the Phantom Spirit.

"Roar!" The Phantom Spirit let out another long howl, its figure darting forward like an arrow, its ghostly claws glinting coldly as they reached for Scholar Song.

At that moment, Venerable White made his move. He lightly pointed his finger: "Go."

The spirit sword hovering above Scholar Song's head moved slightly, unleashing a wave of sword energy directly at the Phantom Spirit.

Caught off guard mid-charge, the Phantom Spirit quickly raised its golden shield to block the sword energy.

Swoosh! The sword energy struck the golden shield.

The sturdy shield crumbled like paper, and the sword energy continued unabated, slamming into the Phantom Spirit and sending it flying backward.

Even while airborne, the Phantom Spirit let out a wailing scream, and cracks resembling those on ceramics appeared across its body.

It was severely injured!

This was still the result of Venerable White suppressing the sword energy's power to the maximum extent; otherwise, a single swipe would have been enough to reduce the Phantom Spirit to mere fragments!

After hitting the ground, the Phantom Spirit emitted a desperate and pained cry.

It looked up at Venerable White in terror, realizing the true magnitude of his power from that last strike. It instinctively decided to flee—rolling on the ground, it struggled to get back on its feet and dashed towards the window.

Venerable White smiled slightly.

Then, the sword energy embedded in the Phantom Spirit's body detonated.

The Phantom Spirit, which had just managed to escape a couple of steps, crashed to the ground once more. This time, it lacked even the strength to rise.

With a face full of fear, the Phantom Spirit desperately tried to heal its internal injuries, trying to suppress the damage from the sword energy.

During the healing process, its spirit body began to shrink—it was a result of its own energy being insufficient, forcing it to dissolve parts of itself to recover from the sword wounds.

Once the wounds healed... the Phantom Spirit was left the size of a fist.

...

...

"Eh?" Venerable White called out in confusion. A mid-tier Phantom Spirit, no matter how badly injured, shouldn't suddenly shrink to the size of a fist.

Could it be that this Phantom Spirit absorbed energy fragments during the dissolution of the 'Green Robe Loose Cultivator's' transformation, causing a mutation?

No, that wouldn't explain the Phantom Spirit's mutation so easily.

There must be some underlying reason that he wasn't aware of!

Venerable White stepped forward and reached out toward the fist-sized Phantom Spirit.

The Phantom Spirit attempted to evade, but Venerable White's long hand seemed to transform into a world, trapping it within.

At the same time, Venerable White's spiritual power morphed into an identification spell, scanning the Phantom Spirit's body.

After scanning it from head to toe, Venerable White opened his eyes, looking quite strange.

The Phantom Spirit in his hand, originally a mid-tier spirit, had now inexplicably downgraded to a 'low-tier Phantom Spirit'!

The quality of a Phantom Spirit was determined at birth; unless it encountered extraordinary circumstances, it would never change throughout its life.

How could this Phantom Spirit's rank have decreased? What was going on?

Scholar Song asked, "Venerable White, is there a problem?"

"Your Phantom Spirit... has become a low-tier Phantom Spirit!" Venerable White examined the fist-sized spirit closely, trying to recall similar stories from his millennia-long memory.

"Low-tier Phantom Spirit?" Scholar Song's eyes widened.

Though the difference between low-tier and mid-tier was just one rank, the two were fundamentally different. A low-tier Phantom Spirit lacked intelligence, only providing its master with an additional energy reserve, and could at most advance to the third tier of the acquired realm.

In contrast, a mid-tier Phantom Spirit possessed decent intelligence, capable of sharing both mind and energy with its master. It could help purify the energy within its master and assist in cultivation, potentially advancing to the sixth tier!

A low-tier Phantom Spirit could only be considered a 'magic supplement.'

While a mid-tier Phantom Spirit was akin to a true 'cheat.'

Was his luck that low? After one failure, even the Phantom Spirit's rank had dropped? The girl Fay Yu had failed so many times, yet had never encountered such an issue!

Could it be that his luck had run out after saving up for so long? Scholar Song pondered in disappointment.

Just when he was feeling a bit down, Venerable White noticed something unusual about the Phantom Spirit.

"Wait... it didn't just turn into a low-tier Phantom Spirit!" Venerable White scrutinized the fist-sized Phantom Spirit for a while longer, then smiled. "Ah, I see! Young friend Song, you’re actually quite lucky!"

Scholar Song asked, "Please enlighten me, Senior."

Venerable White pointed at the center of the 'low-tier Phantom Spirit'—there, a symbol-like core was slowly rotating.

"See that? The core! Low-tier and mid-tier Phantom Spirits don’t have cores; only high-tier Phantom Spirits possess such things."

"Your Phantom Spirit underwent a mutation due to various coincidences, but it didn’t evolve into a high-tier Phantom Spirit! Instead, it used all its energy to condense this 'core.' As a result of the excessive energy consumption, it temporarily downgraded to the 'low-tier Phantom Spirit' rank. However, this downgrade is only temporary—once it accumulates enough energy, it can restore itself to mid-tier status. At that point, there’s even a chance it can break through to become a high-tier Phantom Spirit! Nurture it well; you might just end up with a high-tier Phantom Spirit!" Venerable White smiled.

"To evolve into a high-tier Phantom Spirit?" Scholar Song felt a stir in his heart—mid-tier Phantom Spirits were like having an ordinary cultivator help you practice. A high-tier Phantom Spirit was akin to having a genius-level cultivator assist you day and night!

"Then, Young Friend Song, do you still have the energy? If so, now’s the perfect time to set up the formation again while it’s extremely weak, and bind it with the 'Five Elements Spirit-Contracting Altar!'" Venerable White encouraged.

"Of course I have energy!" Scholar Song grinned, even if he had to squeeze it out, he'd manage to produce enough spiritual power!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In the 'Ninefold Land No. 1 Group,' several seniors were exchanging ideas.

The Alchemical Sage said, "We've found out the reason four of our friends who entered the mysterious island lost their memories. It’s not due to damage to their brain’s memory cells, nor were their memories erased by someone, nor were they under the influence of illusions."

"What’s the reason then?" Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain inquired.

"Although it's bizarre, the consensus we reached is that the two friends and their disciples voluntarily signed something resembling a 'contract' with a powerful entity, sealing their own memories!" The Alchemical Sage replied with a bitter smile.

When arriving at this conclusion, honestly, the Alchemical Sage himself found it unbelievable—but it was true. Both amnesiac friends had used a special method to seal their memories. The sealing spell even bore a 'contract' mark... This should be a clue to unseal their memories after meeting certain conditions.

However, currently, Daoist Kunyi and Daoist Xuanxuan couldn’t recall the memory-sealing incident on the 'mysterious island,' and everyone was clueless about what that 'certain condition' could be.

As it stood, they had no idea how to undo the 'seal.'

"To have two fifth-tier Golden Core spirit emperors willingly seal their memories before leaving the mysterious island—what could possibly be on that island that needed to stay secret? Or how powerful could the beings on that island be?" Drunken Moon Scholar lamented.

The Alchemical Sage responded, "Regardless, at least it’s fortunate that the existence on the mysterious island doesn’t seem to have the intent to wipe everyone out. Now, it’s been several days since Sanlang and the others entered, and we still don’t know how they are faring."

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain sighed, "Let’s hope they return safely, loaded with treasures."

The group fell silent for a moment.

The Alchemical Sage broke the quiet, asking, "By the way, has Venerable White adapted to the modern era? Scholar Song hasn’t been online; how is his task going?"

With the memory loss issue temporarily settled, he wanted to check on when Scholar Song's task of 'hosting Venerable White' would conclude. That way, he could return and finish improving the 'Simplified Body Refining Liquid' formula.

Speaking of Scholar Song and Venerable White, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain scratched his chin, thinking, I haven’t reminded Scholar Song to be cautious of Venerable White’s sudden streak of bizarre good luck!

He had initially intended to discuss this over the phone, but Venerable White was nearby, making it difficult for him to bring it up.

Thinking about Venerable White, not only was he charming and prone to distraction, but his luck seemed outrageously good!

However, how should one describe this luck? It often came with a certain level of danger for those around him—for instance, when Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain had hosted him after his reclusive training, he had been walking while introducing Venerable White to the changes in the modern world.

Then, out of nowhere… a massive meteorite had crashed down from the sky, landing right beside Venerable White and him! The pit it created was less than twenty meters from Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain!

If it weren’t for his good fortune, he might have been crushed by the meteorite!

At that time, Venerable White had calmly descended to decompose the meteorite, extracting materials like 'Celestial Star Steel,' 'Stellar Iron,' 'Crimson Gold Stone,' and a plethora of resources usable by cultivators.

Afterward, he even shared a small portion of the materials, claiming everyone who witnessed it should benefit!

Initially, he thought such incidents were coincidences.

But during the days that followed, whenever he was near Venerable White, he encountered all sorts of bizarre events.

Sometimes while walking, strange objects would suddenly emerge from the ground; at other times, a bolt of lightning would strike down, turning an ancient tree into precious lightning wood; or while passing by a mountain, a landslide would suddenly reveal rare medicinal herbs.

Danger lurked everywhere, with life on the line at any moment; yet Venerable White always returned with bountiful rewards.

Looking back now, aside from the constant threat to life, the gains had been quite impressive!

In short, he needed to ensure that Scholar Song was aware of his safety!

With that thought in mind, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain promptly dialed Scholar Song's number again... (To be continued.
