**Crystal Coffin with the Little White Dragon (Seeking Monthly Tickets)**

“Why are you covering your eyes?” Miss Jiu Deng couldn't help but chuckle when she saw Scholar Song covering his eyes. “I’m still wearing clothes inside!”

Hearing this, Scholar Song sheepishly lowered his hands, a faint smile creeping onto his face. 

In front of him, beneath the pale blue monk's robe, she wore a dark gray monk's outfit. 

Then, she flipped the pale blue robe inside out and rolled it up. 

To his astonishment, he noticed that the inside of the pale blue robe was covered in intricate runes. As she rolled it up, the runes connected, and ultimately, the robe transformed into something resembling a drill bit.

“Hahaha! You think a mere restriction abyss can trap me? That’s a pipe dream!” Miss Jiu Deng exclaimed triumphantly. She grasped the drill formed from her monk's robe and infused it with spiritual energy.

The drill began to spin wildly.

“I used three thousand Buddhist scriptures specifically designed to break restrictions to create this de-restraining drill bit. Even if it’s laid by the Great Pig, I’ll break through it for you!” Miss Jiu Deng boasted.

Scholar Song could only stare in silence.

“By the way, where do we start?” Miss Jiu Deng looked at the massive abyss, surrounded by identical restriction runes, feeling that no matter where they began, it would be the same.

“Miss Jiu Deng, can you find the restriction that blocks the air? If we break that, we might just be able to fly up!” Scholar Song suggested.

“No need to search; it’s everywhere. All the restrictions here are the same—air blocking, confinement, reinforcement. These countless runes have combined to form this wretched abyss trap,” Jiu Deng pointed at the runes on the walls.

“Then let’s just pick a spot,” Scholar Song said as he pulled out his treasured knife, the Crush. “Let’s see where the hilt points; wherever it points, that’s where we’ll drill.”

“Okay!” Miss Jiu Deng replied, raising the drill bit.

Scholar Song tossed the Crush high into the air, and it spun several times before falling with a clang. The hilt pointed towards the area right in front of him.

“That’s the spot!” Miss Jiu Deng exclaimed, raising the drill bit and heading towards the indicated area, thrusting the bit into the abyss wall.

“Boom boom boom boom…” The drill, made from the pale blue monk's robe, erupted with golden runic chains forming around it as it spun, generating a terrifying force to break through the restrictions.

Underneath the drill, the restriction runes also began to glow brightly. This was a defensive rune laid down by a seventh-grade master, not something that could be easily broken.

The violent contact between the drill and the restriction runes produced a thunderous roar.

“Boom boom boom boom~~” Scholar Song covered his ears, wearing a wry smile.

In his pocket, Mistress Scallion was frothing at the mouth; she hadn’t yet managed to transform into her full form, and the thunderous crashing noises echoed incessantly in her ears, making her feel as if her entire scallion body was vibrating.

How frustrating! She had only transformed her mouth so far, and she didn’t even have ears yet—why did the sound come through so clearly?

……

……

Moments later, Scholar Song anxiously asked, “Miss Jiu Deng, our drilling sounds so loud. The Elder Thunder Pig above must have noticed our little actions, right?”

“Definitely! It’s not deaf,” Miss Jiu Deng replied. “So, it will either let us go, or I’ll smash this place to pieces!”

Scholar Song nodded silently.

Ten minutes later.

“Boom boom boom boom~~” Scholar Song waited in anticipation.

Half an hour later.

“Boom boom boom boom~~” Scholar Song continued to hold onto his hope.

An hour later!

“Boom boom boom boom~~” Scholar Song silently began practicing the *Diamond Foundation Fist*, *Immovable Diamond Body*, and *Gentleman’s Long Journey*.

Two hours later!

“Boom boom boom boom~~” Scholar Song sat cross-legged and quietly practiced the *True Self Meditation Sutra*. Although it was particularly challenging to meditate amidst the thunderous sounds, the effects were remarkable.

Another hour later.

“Boom boom boom boom~~” Scholar Song quietly began practicing the *Flame Blade* and *Palm Thunder*.

After another hour of continuous booming, Scholar Song felt stiff and started doing a set of calisthenics…

What else could he do at this point?

Today, his physical training had reached its limit. Continuing would only lead to physical issues; he couldn’t train any longer.

The *True Self Meditation* had also concluded, and he was already on his third round of calisthenics.

How capable was Miss Jiu Deng?

……

……

Just when Scholar Song was doing calisthenics for the tenth time, he heard Miss Jiu Deng’s jubilant voice ahead: “Haha! Got it!”

As she spoke, the drill in her hand erupted like a volcano, and a large portion of the restriction runes shattered, creating a barely passable hole.

“Let’s go! We’ll drill our way out. If the Great Pig won’t let us go, we’ll dig a tunnel right under its palace!” Miss Jiu Deng said cheerfully.

With the restriction lifted, the ordinary wall could no longer stop her drill. The speed at which she drilled was astonishing.

The drill tore through the wall, debris flying everywhere…

“Miss Jiu Deng, be careful! Don’t drill into the Black Sea!” Scholar Song warned from behind her, feeling that the Black Sea was particularly strange and needed to be approached with caution.

“Don’t worry, I know what I’m doing. We’re drilling upwards; it would be best to come up behind the Great Pig and give it a taste of this drill bit!” Miss Jiu Deng chuckled.

Scholar Song fell silent for a moment and cautiously asked, “Miss Jiu Deng, what’s your strength level?”

“I’m at the peak of the fifth-grade Spirit Emperor, just one step away from breaking through to the sixth-grade True Monarch. However, my state is a bit unique, so you can’t just view me as an ordinary Spirit Emperor or True Monarch,” she replied.

“Well, putting aside the fact that Elder Thunder Pig has probably discovered our drilling… let’s talk about you, still at the fifth-grade Spirit Emperor level, trying to hit the seventh-grade Spirit Sovereign Thunder Pig with a drill bit. What do you think will happen?” Scholar Song cautioned.

That would be practically suicidal!

“Don’t worry; at worst, I’ll just be locked up for a few years. It’ll definitely be fine,” Miss Jiu Deng confidently assured.

Scholar Song swallowed hard and posed the crucial question, “What about me?”

“Hahaha, you can accompany me for a few years. Don’t worry; a few years in seclusion will pass in the blink of an eye,” she laughed.

Scholar Song: “…”

Please, no! He didn’t want to be cooped up for a few years. Moreover, he didn’t have enough strength to spend years in seclusion in the blink of an eye!

Should he consider using the Crush to dig another tunnel? Following Miss Jiu Deng’s lead felt like a bad ending.

Just as Scholar Song was deep in thought, Miss Jiu Deng suddenly halted.

“Hmm? Something’s off.” She spoke up.

“?” Scholar Song looked at her, confused.

“The wall ahead isn’t solid; there’s a hidden chamber!” Miss Jiu Deng stated with certainty. She could tell this from the echoes produced when the drill struck.

“A hidden chamber? Could it be an underground river?” Scholar Song asked cautiously.

“Impossible! Don’t forget that Heavenly Realm Island is a massive island floating in the sky. Where would there be an underground river?” Miss Jiu Deng smiled, grabbing the drill and thrusting forward fiercely.

Crack crack crack.

Debris flew in all directions as she smashed through the wall!

Just as she said, before them lay a gigantic hidden chamber.

Then, Miss Jiu Deng led the way and jumped into the chamber, with Scholar Song following closely behind.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Inside the hidden chamber.

When Scholar Song saw the entire layout of the chamber, he felt a wave of despair wash over him.

If Miss Jiu Deng had drilled through to the surface and hit the Elder Thunder Pig, he might have been locked up for only a few years.

But breaking through this hidden chamber would likely lead to decades of confinement!

Because right in front of him was a burial chamber.

Though he didn’t know whose tomb it was, the fact that it was carefully buried beneath the Elder Thunder Pig’s palace clearly indicated it was the tomb of someone close to it.

Disturbing a dear one’s grave was a death wish!

Scholar Song forced a smile, saying, “Miss Jiu Deng, I think we should leave quickly.”

“I was thinking the same thing,” Miss Jiu Deng replied with a grim expression—she truly hadn’t meant to. Who could have anticipated that there would be a tomb beneath the Elder Thunder Pig’s palace?

“Then let’s backtrack and seal the burial wall… Oh no!” Scholar Song turned his head only to see that the large hole they had drilled had automatically restored itself, looking brand new.

Moreover, bright runes sparkled on the wall, clearly stronger than the restriction runes on the ‘deep pit wall.’

Miss Jiu Deng gritted her teeth and said, “It really is that big pig’s doing!”

With the loud noise they made while drilling, the Elder Thunder Pig must have noticed them. Perhaps it was annoyed by their noise and had led them to this burial chamber to trap them.

Gritting her teeth, Miss Jiu Deng declared, “No matter what that big pig is thinking, since we’ve entered the burial chamber, we should go in and see what’s inside!”

The hidden chamber was not large. Looking around, there were ten coffins in total.

At the center, on a high platform, lay a gigantic crystal coffin surrounded by a profusion of white flowers. Encircling the crystal coffin were nine equally large bronze coffins arranged in a formation, guarding it closely.

Scholar Song and Miss Jiu Deng approached the high platform, peering into the transparent crystal coffin.

Inside lay a long, slender spirit beast.

Its antlers resembled those of a deer, its head like a camel, its eyes like a rabbit’s, its neck like a snake’s, its belly like that of a clam, its scales like a fish’s, its claws like an eagle’s, its paws like a tiger’s, and its ears like a cow’s, all pristine white.

“A dragon!” Scholar Song’s eyes widened, astonished to see a completely white dragon.

“It really is a dragon,” Miss Jiu Deng gasped, and after a moment, she murmured, “Too bad it didn’t turn into dragon bones; I can’t grow dragon bone vines.”

She was still thinking of Scholar Song’s wish.

“This white dragon is stunning,” Scholar Song remarked in awe.

……

……

Just as Scholar Song and Miss Jiu Deng’s attention shifted to the white dragon, one of the nine bronze coffins beside them creaked open slightly.

A bony claw emerged from the gap of the coffin door…
