**Flame-Splitting Blade**

“Hatred, hatred, hatred! Even if I cannot enter the cycle of reincarnation and am doomed to be a ghost forever, I will have my revenge!” The black spirit howled menacingly, its form swelling like an inflating balloon, quickly growing from the size of a ping-pong ball to over half a human tall.

Upon closer inspection, traces of the ‘Master’ who had perished at Scholar Song’s hands could be faintly discerned in its features. However, it resembled the ‘Master’ only about fifty percent.

This was clearly a vengeful spirit formed from the curse cast by the ‘Master’ just before his demise. Scholar Song had previously shattered this vengeful spirit with his own hands and had seen it devoured several times by the Peking dog, Doudou, yet this curse had not dissipated?

This time, Doudou was not by Scholar Song's side. Due to the excessive consumption of his mental energy, he couldn't even maintain the mental technique ‘Alertness.’

As the cursed ghost slowly took shape, it grinned wickedly and extended its sharp ghostly claws, aiming to viciously slash at Scholar Song's throat. If it landed, Scholar Song would surely be left with five bloody holes on his throat.

Just as the pointed claw was about to pierce Scholar Song, a burst of pure white spirit leaped out from his heart's core—this was the Golden Shield Spirit with whom Scholar Song had formed a contract.

The white spirit was only the size of a fist, while the black vengeful spirit had already grown to half a human’s height.

However, the spirit showed no fear. It opened its mouth wide and inhaled sharply, targeting the vengeful spirit.

An eerie scene unfolded as the spirit seemed to gulp down the ghost like a long whale sipping water. Its mouth resembled a ‘purple gold gourd’ that could swallow anything, directly consuming the black vengeful spirit!

“Burp~” The spirit let out a satisfied belch, even growing slightly larger in size. Then, it yawned and shrank back into Scholar Song's heart's core.

In his dreams, Scholar Song smacked his lips, feeling as if he had just had a wonderful dream… He turned over and continued to indulge in his peaceful slumber.

…

…

It was a beautiful dream.

In this dream, Scholar Song transformed into an ancient person.

He had an innocent childhood, with loving parents. However, when he turned six, he fell ill with a strange disease that no medicine could cure. His father took him everywhere in search of a cure, but his condition showed no improvement.

Ultimately, his parents sent him to a dilapidated Daoist temple several dozen miles from home, where a Daoist priest in a bright red robe took him in.

This priest was not an ordinary person but a true immortal. Dreaming Scholar Song began to live with him, drinking bitter herbal potions daily and practicing strange forms of martial arts under the priest’s guidance.

Two years later, his illness had recovered, and he had gained some extraordinary powers.

Then, on a day two years and three months later, the priest led dreaming Scholar Song to the base of a towering tree that seemed to touch the clouds.

“I am known as Chi Xiaozi, and we are destined to share a bond. Watch closely!” The Daoist priest chuckled lightly, then stood beneath the giant tree, breaking off a branch and beginning to demonstrate something.

He spoke of some profound technique.

This was likely a peerless sword technique, but Scholar Song couldn't comprehend it.

As the priest performed the sword technique, his figure became increasingly blurred, often skipping a segment… The teachings he offered were in another language, sounding completely foreign to Scholar Song, who felt as if he were listening to a clamor of ducks and geese.

Yet, the ‘him’ in the dream seemed to understand clearly, captivated by the performance.

After demonstrating, the Daoist priest smiled and asked, “How much did you grasp?”

“Ninety percent,” the dreaming ‘him’ replied honestly.

“Good! This ninety percent is enough for you to coalesce a Golden Core and step into the path of greatness. Your future development depends on your own efforts,” Chi Xiaozi said with a smile, gently ruffling the dreaming ‘his’ hair.

The dreaming ‘him’ smiled shyly, feeling intuitively that the priest seemed to be preparing to say goodbye.

Chi Xiaozi lovingly patted his head and squatted in front of him, as if wanting to share something.

Suddenly, the priest looked at the dreaming ‘him’ with confusion.

Scholar Song could feel the priest's gaze, deep as the cosmos, seemingly piercing through the dreaming ‘him,’ transcending countless dimensions and epochs, staring straight at the real Scholar Song behind him!

A chill ran down Scholar Song's spine, as if he had been completely seen through!

“Ah, I see! Interesting! Very interesting!” Chi Xiaozi laughed heartily.

Then, the priest stood up again and picked up the branch.

Next, he switched to a different language and began to narrate another technique.

This time, the dreaming ‘him’ couldn’t comprehend at all, as it was a language he had never encountered.

However… Scholar Song understood!

“I am Chi Xiaozi. When I first entered the Dao, I relied on a common technique known as the ‘Flame Blade,’ which is a foundation for my cultivation. Now, I will pass this ‘Flame Blade’ of mine onto you. Although it is merely an ordinary knife technique, I hope you do not find me stingy.”

Scholar Song felt a peculiar sensation—at this moment, Chi Xiaozi was not just speaking to the dreaming ‘him’ but was directly communicating with him through the dreaming figure!

“Time is limited, so I will demonstrate it for you once.” Chi Xiaozi swung the branch in his hand, using it as a knife, and with a flick of his wrist, he struck out a blow.

In an instant, Scholar Song felt the world ignite around him.

The branch in the priest's hand seemed to summon boundless flames, an eternal fire that burned through everything!

The strike enveloped the world in flames, consuming all worldly splendor, and even the lofty ‘heavens’ turned crimson with fire clouds.

There were no incantations or techniques, merely the intent of the strike itself! This single cut embodied an entire technique!

Facing this strike, Scholar Song felt himself becoming unbearably hot, his mouth dry, as if his blood might boil away!

Yet, he gained profound insights.

Though Chi Xiaozi couldn’t see Scholar Song, he seemed to instinctively know that Scholar Song had comprehended much. He laughed heartily, flicked his hand, and the branch turned to ashes.

Moreover, the towering tree behind him also vanished into ash.

The dreaming ‘him’ was left dumbfounded.

With a sharp whistle, the priest stepped steadily into the sky, relying on no external force, walking through the air step by step until he disappeared from view.

The dreaming ‘him’ respectfully knelt and bowed three times.

Then… the scene changed, transitioning to many years later.

The dreaming ‘him’ had grown into adulthood, now carrying a blue short sword, dressed in a Daoist robe similar to that of Chi Xiaozi, but in green.

The green-robed cultivator was a wandering practitioner, Li Tiansu!

At this moment, Scholar Song awakened from the dream… the day had dawned.

…

…

It was 6:03 AM on July 2nd, a Tuesday, and the sky was clear.

Scholar Song sat up on his bed.

“Was it a dream?” As he spoke, he realized he was drenched in sweat!

“Not a dream… then it must be the ‘memories’ of that wandering practitioner, Li Tiansu?” Having previously experienced a similar memory, Scholar Song quickly came to this conclusion.

That ‘Li Tiansu’ should be the wandering practitioner who had exploded two pieces of equipment when he flew over while forming a contract with the spirit, right?

When Venerable White had asked for the wandering practitioner’s name, Scholar Song had heard the reply: ‘Wandering Practitioner, Li Tiansu.’

But why had Li Tiansu’s memories appeared in his mind?

Was it the spirit? It seemed that the spirit absorbed some energy when Li Tiansu transcended, causing a mutation. When the spirit synced with him, it allowed him to ‘see’ this memory?

While pondering, Scholar Song looked down and noticed the ancient bronze ring on his finger—the bronze ring.

This was one of the items Li Tiansu had left behind after his transcendence.

“Could it be that this ring, rather than the spirit, carries the former owner’s memories, which led me to have that dream?” Scholar Song speculated.

Recalling that dream, what stood out most was the ‘Flame Blade’ taught by Chi Xiaozi.

Chi Xiaozi had said it was merely an ordinary ‘Flame Blade Technique’ seen everywhere among cultivators.

But when Chi Xiaozi executed that flame blade, the feeling of an all-consuming, unquenchable fire that could ignite the very heavens—could that really just be an ordinary ‘Flame Blade Technique’?

This was truly the **Flame-Splitting Blade**!

Instantly, Scholar Song felt a surge of excitement. Chi Xiaozi had imparted this ‘Flame Blade’ to him; should he try it out to see if it was truly a ‘dream’ or perhaps Li Tiansu’s ‘memories’?

Scholar Song dashed to the safe, quickly opening it and retrieving the divine blade obtained from the Moon Blade Sect’s master, Ba Qianjun.

The blade was named **Smash**; it measured three feet three inches long, was incredibly hard, and had undergone transformations after being burned by heavenly tribulation flames.

With the blade in hand, Scholar Song rushed to the rooftop of the fifth floor.

Having learned from the past experience with the ‘Three-Star Fire Fan’, he dared not recklessly try things out in his room.

“Let’s give it a shot; no one will see anyway. I’ll just pretend I’m daydreaming.” Scholar Song took a deep breath, recalling the appearance of Chi Xiaozi wielding the ‘Flame Blade.’

He too spun the blade, feeling his qi and blood surge in his heart and eyes, and then he swung down…

A magnificent display, a cool pose!

However, no flames erupted.

Not even a spark.

“Haha.” Scholar Song let out a dry laugh.

Am I still dreaming?

Or perhaps, does the ‘Flame Blade’ require diligent practice to master?

“Well, I have free time every day. I might as well set aside some time to practice this Flame Blade occasionally.” Scholar Song decided in his heart.

If he could slice through flames like Chi Xiaozi, that would be incredible.

“Enough thinking; time to start training. I have to attend classes seriously these days too.” Scholar Song stretched his muscles and joints.

He placed the precious blade, **Smash**, aside and began practicing the **Basic Diamond Fist Technique**, then used the **True Self Meditation Scripture** to guide his qi and blood into the third heart’s core, the ‘Nasal Core.’

The third core, the Nasal Core, was even more challenging to open than the Eye Core. If he didn’t rely on external assistance, it would take at least two years.
