**If I Were a Scallion?**

Mistress Scallion, having lived for three hundred years as a scallion spirit, stored immense amounts of demonic energy within her. Although this energy was of no use to her personally and could only serve to scare people off, it was still powerful stuff!

If her body was chopped up for cooking, and there wasn’t a specialized culinary immortal around to handle the removal of that demonic energy, then all that energy would be transferred to whoever consumed the dish. 

For ordinary people, eating it would lead to being infected by the demonic energy. If they were lucky, they’d just go crazy and become a lunatic, causing chaos until they eventually wore themselves out. 

If they were less fortunate, they might become half-human, half-demon… not even knowing how they’d meet their end. 

And for cultivators, if they didn’t possess enough cultivation to refine that demonic energy, it would be a real headache!

“You want to use me in your cooking? I’ll make it easy for you!” 

This was why, when Mother Song sautéed the scallion spirit, it cooked so quickly—just a quick stir-fry, and it was done! That was Mistress Scallion willingly cooperating with Mother Song.

“Once you eat it, there’s no throwing it up. Just accept the torment of the demonic energy, ha ha ha! You can’t catch a wolf without letting go of the cub—oh, I’m so clever,” Mistress Scallion said proudly.

Then, all that was left of her was the scallion root, which crawled out of Scholar Song’s pocket and made its way into another pocket where the ‘Enlightenment Stone’ was stored.

With her roots pressed against the stone, Mistress Scallion began to plot: “Once I catch my breath and regain some energy, I can escape with this gem… and I might as well take that sharp sword too. That blade is so sharp it easily sliced through my body.”

Tsk tsk, while she might have lost her upper body, trading it for a gem and a sword was worth it!

……

The demonic energy began to spread from Scholar Song’s stomach throughout his body, a chaotic force subtly battering against his consciousness.

Scholar Song silently operated the ‘True Self Meditation Scripture,’ his true self firmly seated in his sea of consciousness, maintaining clarity. He started trying to convert the heat within his body into vital energy. If he succeeded, he would score big.

At that moment, large amounts of spiritual energy began to swirl around the nearby White Elder. This energy was the result of White Elder absorbing the essence of heaven and earth as he cultivated.

As this spiritual energy gathered towards White Elder, a small portion was attracted to Scholar Song’s body. In the world of cultivation, it was common for disciples to guard their master’s cave dwelling during their seclusion, and this was precisely why.

When powerful cultivators entered seclusion, they naturally drew in vast amounts of spiritual energy. If guarding disciples seized the opportunity, they could benefit from a bit of the overflow—very satisfying!

Simultaneously, each time this spiritual energy washed over Scholar Song’s body, it would automatically push out a small portion of the demonic energy from within him…

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Scholar Song continued to cultivate, unknowingly drifting off to sleep.

Then, he had a dream.

He dreamed that he… had transformed into a giant scallion!

After the bizarre dreams of the forum master and the rogue cultivator Li Tiansu, he found himself as a scallion again?

As the saying goes, “Once shy, twice familiar.”

Scholar Song was no longer shocked by his ‘strange dreams.’ He understood he was about to experience someone else's life again.

Dreaming of the forum master’s life was due to the curse that turned him into a vengeful spirit, clinging to Scholar Song, making him relive the master’s tragic life…

Dreaming of the rogue cultivator Li Tiansu’s life happened because a part of Li Tiansu’s memories fused with a phantom spirit, which had been contracted by Scholar Song, allowing him to experience a fragment of Li Tiansu’s life…

Now dreaming of becoming a giant scallion… there was no doubt it was because he had consumed the scallion spirit and was now experiencing her life!

At that moment, Scholar Song felt a large, warm hand grabbing him. The warmth was so comforting that he didn’t want to leave.

Then, the owner of that hand took the ‘giant scallion’ to a towering peak surrounded by a vast forest, with a clear stream flowing nearby.

“We’ve arrived,” said the owner of the hand, his voice resonating like thunder, each word seemingly accompanied by the essence of heaven and earth.

Seeing the scene unfold in this memory, Scholar Song guessed it might be the time over three hundred years ago—or even longer—when the scallion spirit was first planted. It seemed the scallion spirit wasn’t a naturally occurring spirit but rather a cultivated variety planted by someone!

The owner of the hand carefully dug a hole in the ground and gently placed the giant scallion into it.

At this moment, through the ‘sight’ of the scallion, Scholar Song saw the owner’s appearance.

It was a slender man dressed in a fiery red robe, surrounded by layers of mist.

Scholar Song was taken aback and then exclaimed in surprise, “Daoist Chi Xiaozi!”

The Daoist in the fiery red robe was indeed the one he had seen in Li Tiansu’s memories—the master who had taught him!

Back then, in Li Tiansu’s dream, Daoist Chi Xiaozi’s gaze seemed to transcend time and space, directly perceiving Scholar Song’s existence and teaching him a move called ‘Flame Blade.’

Daoist Chi Xiaozi had said it was just an ordinary technique, but seeing him perform it with such a majestic flair made Scholar Song realize it was anything but ordinary.

Scholar Song never expected that in this memory of the scallion spirit, he would encounter the mysterious and powerful Daoist Chi Xiaozi once more.

……

However, this time, Daoist Chi Xiaozi didn’t seem to notice Scholar Song.

“Grow strong, little one. Even the most ordinary scallion has an unlimited future. I truly want to see how far you will grow; it’s the scene I most wish to witness,” he softly said to the little scallion.

His warm hand gently brushed over the scallion’s leaves: “Remember where you were born; hold tightly to that memory, and never forget it… for your roots are here.”

Having said that, Daoist Chi Xiaozi stretched and then vanished into thin air, as if planting this little scallion was merely a fleeting whim of his.

The little scallion swayed gently on the peak… lonely but still resiliently rooted in the ground, surviving.

Days turned into nights, and seasons cycled through, day in and day out, year after year.

In the blink of an eye, three years had passed…

What the heck? Since this is a dream, shouldn’t these days of wind and sunshine pass by in a fast-forward montage? Why did they have to feel so real, as if he were truly living each day as a scallion?

Scholar Song wanted to flip a table!

Then, for some reason, he suddenly recalled an elementary school essay he had written long ago.

When he was in elementary school, the essay prompt had been particularly silly.

That time, the topic was "If I Were a Blade of Grass."

Young Scholar Song had written enthusiastically: If I were a blade of grass, I would strive to grow, root down, sprout upwards, thrive, and photosynthesize to contribute to society.

He couldn’t recall the specifics, but that was roughly the content.

Looking back now, how adorable he was as a child!

A little blade of grass wanting to grow strong and contribute to society? The farmers wouldn’t hesitate to spray herbicide on you instead!

At most, they’d cut you down to feed the horses, pigs, or sheep…

What’s more silly was… Young Scholar Song had even fantasized about whether living carefreely as a blade of grass would be interesting?

He never expected that this wish would actually come true one day.

Now, he had become a scallion, swaying in the cold wind, exposed to the sun, and all he could do was daze around.

“If I were a scallion, I’d choose to snap my own stem—suicide… because it’s just so damn boring,” Scholar Song murmured.

If someone were to tell Scholar Song: perhaps being a blade of grass, free of worries, could be a happiness, he would surely drown them in spit—please, plant your legs in the soil and sway in the wind for three years before discussing the ‘bliss’ of being a blade of grass with me!

He had been swaying for three whole years!

So boring, so boring; even a rabbit to eat him would be welcome.

But there were no rabbits, no little animals at all.

The little scallion continued to sway in the wind, enduring the weather.

Thus, Scholar Song continued day after day, year after year…

Ultimately, he couldn’t even remember how many years had passed.

At first, he would murmur, “So boring, so boring.”

In the end, he didn’t even have the energy to murmur anymore.

As a scallion, he had to embrace the realization of being a scallion, rooting down to absorb nutrients, sprouting upwards, and photosynthesizing for all humanity.

……

Finally, one day, the torturous days came to an abrupt end.

Because this giant scallion suddenly evolved!

There were no signs.

No lightning tribulations, no gathering of demonic cores, nothing—just one night, the scallion spirit woke up to find herself transformed into a green-haired girl, adorably cute.

The scallion spirit was overjoyed. Having never left the ground before, she now had the function of human legs. As a cute little scallion spirit, she began to happily live among the mountains and forests.

Such carefree days lasted for over a decade.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but sigh; this giant scallion was living such a happy life, free of worries.

Then, one day, a monster organization called “Monsters of the World Unite as One Family” approached the scallion spirit, drawing her into their ranks and giving her the name ‘Mistress Scallion.’

“What kind of name is ‘Monsters of the World Unite as One Family’? Just hearing it makes me want to retch!” 

But since it was a monster organization… they should teach Mistress Scallion some self-defense skills, right? Scholar Song thought to himself. 

—Because based on previous experiences, if the memories of techniques in dreams were clear, he could learn them! Just like that ‘Flame Blade’!

If there were techniques to learn, it would make all those years spent swaying in the wind worthwhile!

But soon, he remembered Mistress Scallion’s useless nature.

Would there be any techniques in this monster organization?
