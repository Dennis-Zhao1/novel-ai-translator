**Scholar Song, making fake IDs is illegal!**

When Scholar Song mentioned someone who specializes in dealing with such issues, he was referring to the subordinate of the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, known as 'Cang Tiangou' Zhou Li. Zhou Li was on his way to Wenzhou City to handle the car accident caused by Dou Dou’s reckless driving last night. So, Scholar Song figured he could also ask him to help take care of his tractor...

After that, Scholar Song made his way to the spot where the tractor had veered off.

Down below, Father Song, Uncle Lü, and Lü Tianyou were moving Scholar Song’s box and a barrel of diesel fuel to the side. The three of them sat in a row, deep in conversation about something.

The tractor behind them was completely unharmed, thanks to the protective array that Venerable White had reinforced on the vehicle...

“Didn’t bring a rope? How are you getting down?” Zhao Yayao looked at the five-meter-high terrace; at that height, it was difficult for anyone to get down. Even if he managed to descend, how would he bring Father Song and the others back up?

At that moment, Father Song and the others noticed Scholar Song.

Father Song called out from below, “Scholar, you’re here already? Did you bring a rope? Toss it down!”

“I didn’t bring one. When Sister Yayao called, I was already on the way,” Scholar Song replied.

“……” Father Song was speechless.

—Then why did you rush over? Just to watch your old man sit on the hillside after a flip?

“It’s okay, I’ll come down and bring you guys up,” Scholar Song said with a slight smile, his gaze sweeping over the slope of the terrace.

“Don’t be reckless!” Father Song shouted.

But before he could finish his warning, Scholar Song had already leaped down.

As he jumped, he used his foot to push off a protrusion on the slope, slowing his descent. Then, like a monkey, he agilely leaped onto the first layer of the terrace.

Father Song facepalmed—how could he jump down from a five-meter-high terrace and expect to carry them back up too?

His precious son wasn’t losing his mind from reading too much, was he? His liver hurt just thinking about it!

……

At this moment, Zhao Yayao's earpiece crackled to life with the sound of Xiao Mai Sui's voice: “Zhao Yayao, did your brother just jump down?”

“Yes,” Zhao Yayao replied.

She looked down, where Scholar Song had lightly jumped again and swiftly climbed up to the next layer of the terrace.

When did Scholar Song become so nimble? Zhao Yayao felt a surge of confusion.

Behind her, the sound of a car door opening echoed.

Xiao Mai Sui climbed out of the car, joining Arthur at Zhao Yayao's side.

“Yayao, your brother is quite handsome,” Arthur leaned against the railing, watching the agile Scholar Song with a grin.

Zhao Yayao smiled slightly: “Does he meet your standards?”

“As long as he's good-looking, he meets my standards. I’m a total looks-oriented person,” Arthur squinted his eyes and then added, “But unfortunately, your brother is a rookie. I never date rookies.”

“I think your brother is quite appealing too!” Xiao Mai Sui chimed in excitedly: “But too bad he’s a guy; if he were a girl, I’d definitely go for it!”

“You two… are hopeless.” Zhao Yayao rolled her eyes.

“Hehehe.” Xiao Mai Sui giggled.

……

While they chatted, Scholar Song had already reached the site of the tractor accident.

Father Song and the others looked at him, both amused and exasperated.

Scholar Song smiled at them, “Get ready; I’ll bring you up.”

“How will you do that?” Lü Tianyou asked, puzzled.

“Let me take you up first, Tianyou, don’t struggle,” Scholar Song said.

“Alright,” Lü Tianyou agreed.

Then, without warning, Scholar Song grabbed Lü Tianyou and hoisted him onto his shoulder.

“What the heck?” Lü Tianyou felt awkward—this hulking figure, almost two meters tall, was effortlessly thrown onto Scholar Song's shoulder?

Is Scholar Song made of ants? How could he be so strong?

And what does he plan to do? Carry him up?

Wait, he’s really doing it!

Scholar Song, with Lü Tianyou on his shoulder, leaped lightly—lightly, mind you!

Have you ever seen someone carrying a nearly two-meter-tall giant and still manage to leap effortlessly? Does he think everyone is like Shaquille O'Neal, capable of carrying several people while dunking?

But Scholar Song did just that, darting up the terraced slope with astonishing speed.

Lü Tianyou felt his view rising higher and higher.

In no time… he found himself on the mountain path.

Scholar Song let go of him, setting him on the ground.

“Did I just… get up?” Lü Tianyou stammered, struggling to process his words.

Not just him, even Zhao Yayao and her two friends stood there, eyes wide in shock.

From their vantage point, they could see clearly—Scholar Song had just carried Lü Tianyou up in a flash.

It was like a scene from a martial arts movie, where a master could carry someone and leap across cliffs.

“Scholar, did you join a rock climbing club?” Lü Tianyou blurted out, dazed.

“A rock climbing club? Nope. Just wait here; I’ll go back down to bring Uncle Lü and my dad up,” Scholar Song said with a grin, then jumped down again!

The stylish Arthur blinked and said to Zhao Yayao, “Yayao, can you give me your brother’s phone number?”

Zhao Yayao: “……”

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

As Scholar Song jumped down once more, Old Lü and Father Song were squatting beneath the tractor's driver seat, rummaging through a pile of documents.

Seeing Scholar Song actually able to carry Lü Tianyou back up, both Father Song and Old Lü felt relieved.

Then, they carefully searched the area around the tractor to see if anything had been left behind.

Soon, they stumbled upon a stack of documents.

Old Lü stepped aside, while Father Song crouched down to pull out all the documents and handed them to Old Lü.

“Vehicle registration? Why are there so many?” Old Lü received the stack of registration papers and flipped them open.

What the heck, this is unbelievable!

These registration papers listed all kinds of vehicles—Ferraris, Maseratis, Porsches, and various sports cars; there were multiple models of BMWs, Mercedes, and Audis; and trailing behind them were VWs, Buicks, and various models lined up. Oh, and even a registration for a tractor...

Over thirty vehicle registrations!

But that wasn’t the main issue; the main point was—all the vehicles listed had ‘Scholar Song’ as the ‘owner’!

“Hey, Old Song, is your family planning to open a car dealership?” Old Lü asked curiously.

Father Song shook his head.

“Then, what’s going on here?” Old Lü scrutinized the documents. They looked just like real registrations, complete with license plate numbers.

The two exchanged worried glances, anxiety reflected in their eyes.

“Could these be fake?” Father Song whispered.

What could Father Song do? How could he believe that these vehicle registrations were real?

Over thirty cars, and most of them were luxury vehicles worth millions!

Even if Scholar Song hit a billion-dollar jackpot, he couldn’t afford so many cars!

If someone suggested that maybe Scholar Song earned enough to buy them? Father Song would immediately dismiss them—was that a daydream? Does he think he’s a money printer?

“After considering, the likelihood of them being fake is the highest,” Old Lü replied, but he hesitated to be certain—because there was still a tractor nearby, capable of hitting 150 kph!

Who knows, maybe this kid Scholar Song really has some tricks up his sleeve?

……

……

“Dad, Uncle Lü, what are you doing? Get ready; who’s going first?” At that moment, Scholar Song walked over to them.

He then noticed the stack of vehicle registrations in Father Song and Uncle Lü’s hands.

—Oh no, I totally forgot to take these registrations back.

Scholar Song rubbed his temples hard, trying to figure out how to explain this to his dad.

Explanation 1: “Dad, these cars actually belong to a friend of mine. But his ID wasn’t ready at the time, so these vehicles were registered under my name for now!”

This is a solid truth… but if you were Father Song, would you believe it?

Explanation 2: “Dad, your son suddenly struck it rich today, and decided to buy luxury cars. Then one luxury car didn’t feel enough, so I bought a bunch to play with! Drive one, toss one!”

This is a lie… but Father Song still wouldn’t believe it!

And if Father Song did believe it, he’d definitely give Scholar Song a good beating—striking it rich and throwing all the money on luxury cars? Has he lost his mind?

Just as Scholar Song was in a dilemma, Father Song spoke first, his tone serious: “Scholar, listen to your dad. Making fake IDs… is illegal! You could go to jail!”

Scholar Song: “……”

Fake IDs?

Oh, that’s a good excuse.

His eyes brightened, and he laughed, “Hahaha, Dad, this isn’t really a fake ID. It’s a prop! A movie prop! This semester, since the courses are light, I joined a film club at school. We’re planning to write a script and shoot a little movie during the summer, a funny skit for the internet. I’m going to play a rich character, and these vehicle registrations are props prepared for me by the film club members!”

“Props? I see.” Father Song and Old Lü nodded, their expressions changing to understanding.

Though the explanation felt a bit far-fetched, it seemed to be the closest to the truth at the moment.

“Hahaha, Scholar, once your movie is done, be sure to show it to me first!” Father Song patted Scholar Song’s shoulder happily.

“Definitely, definitely,” Scholar Song chuckled awkwardly.

“But even if it’s just props, you shouldn’t make them so realistic; it could easily lead to legal trouble. Be careful next time,” Father Song cautioned.

“I understand, I’ll definitely talk to the props team,” Scholar Song said, forcing a smile.

Father Song nodded in satisfaction.

Suddenly, as if recalling something, his eyes lit up as he asked, “By the way… Scholar, can you finish this movie by the end of the year? Just imagine, when it’s New Year’s and we have relatives over for a gathering, if I could show them the movie you made, it would definitely be amusing!”

Father Song’s tendency to show off kicked in again!

“Ah?” Scholar Song’s mouth dropped open—finish it by New Year’s?

Heaven help me, I was just lying earlier! How am I supposed to create a film club and make a movie?
