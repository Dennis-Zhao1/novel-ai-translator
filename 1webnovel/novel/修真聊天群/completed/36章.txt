**Surrounded by Delinquents**

For cultivators from sects, Scholar Song's age when he joined was akin to a ninety-year-old illiterate suddenly trying to enroll in elementary school. Even if this elderly man managed to get into the school through various connections, what could he possibly learn? What achievements could he hope to attain? He didn't even have a future—who could know whether a ninety-year-old would still be around tomorrow?

Even if Scholar Song successfully established his foundation, the time and resources he would consume to advance would be significantly greater than those of young prodigies who started foundation building at four or five years old.

On one side was the genius disciple with a promising future, rapid advancement, and low resource consumption.

On the other side was Scholar Song, whose path to advancement was fraught with difficulties, high resource costs, and a future shrouded in uncertainty.

Any sect leader with a functioning brain wouldn't waste time, teaching resources, or precious cultivation materials on Scholar Song.

Moreover, the friends from the Ninefold Land who had introduced Scholar Song to the sect could only offer him temporary support; they couldn't care for him for a lifetime!

The Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram had no words to counter this. His thoughts were not as extensive as those of the Hermit of North River; he merely recognized the hardships of being a rogue cultivator and hadn’t fully grasped how little better it would be for Scholar Song within a sect.

“So, whether it's a sect or being a rogue cultivator, it doesn't matter much for Scholar Song. Thus, letting him choose for himself is the best approach. Whatever choice he makes, even if it turns out to be a mistake, he can't blame anyone else,” the Hermit of North River said softly.

As senior cultivators, all they could do was lend a hand to Scholar Song when he was in need.

**Jiangnan University Town, Dormitory.**

Scholar Song leaned back in his chair, gazing at a sealed cup on the desk next to his computer. Inside was the remaining body refining liquid. This liquid, when used in conjunction with the basic meditation techniques and boxing methods taught by the Alchemical Sage, could maximize its effects.

At that moment, his phone rang with a melodious tune.

He pressed the answer button, and the voice of his friend, Tu Bo, came through. “Song, have you organized your two big boxes yet? If you’re done, come over to our place. Yang De's place is settled! You should check it out, and then we can all go out for a meal.”

“Sure thing, I’ll head over right away. Just send me the address,” Scholar Song replied.

“I'll text it to you.” Tu Bo hung up.

After ending the call, Scholar Song set his phone down and gazed out the window at the balcony.

Perhaps he should also rent a place off-campus like Yang De.

While he didn’t need to stay outside all the time, having a private space to concoct pills or practice cultivation in peace would be necessary.

“If I want to rent a place outside, maybe I should look for a part-time job?” Scholar Song thought to himself. He was just an ordinary student, lacking the computer skills of Li Yang De, and if he wanted to make money, part-time work seemed to be his only option.

Speaking of which, how did the seniors in the Ninefold Land group earn their living? They weren’t living in isolation; they must need money for their daily expenses, right? At the very least, they had to pay for electricity and internet.

Lost in these thoughts, Tu Bo sent him the address via text.

**Room 602, Building D, Daji Street 221.**

That was quite close to the university town.

…

…

“This location is great, near the school. Yang De really found a good spot,” Scholar Song remarked while checking the map on his phone as he made his way.

Daji Street was an old residential area, built without prior planning, resulting in a mix of house sizes and shapes, with winding alleys crisscrossing everywhere, creating a somewhat chaotic appearance from afar.

“Given this position, I should be able to take a shortcut, saving a lot of time.” With this thought in mind, Scholar Song ducked into an alley, moving swiftly like a nimble fish.

These secluded alleys used to be hotspots for delinquents.

Speaking of delinquents, he couldn’t help but recall the group that had recently been taken down in a collective defeat.

The group that had been taken out, to the point where even their mothers wouldn’t recognize them, finally woke up after two days and nights of unconsciousness.

Later, members from the school’s news department came to ask them about their experience of being knocked out.

Strangely, none of these delinquents could remember what had happened during that time. Their memories had gaps regarding that day, and they had no idea why they ended up in the hospital. In their minds, one moment they were smoking and showing off in the alley, and the next they woke up in the hospital, all looking utterly confused.

The hospital could find no reason for their unconsciousness and could only chalk it up to collective amnesia, leaving the matter unresolved.

This incident had become one of the new ‘incredible events’ at Jiangnan University Town.

“It’s obvious their memories were tampered with,” Scholar Song mused internally.

If it had only been one or two people with fuzzy memories, it could be explained as resulting from a blow to the head. But for eighty or ninety people to all have hazy memories and completely lose recollection of that day’s events was far too coincidental.

Thanks to the incident with the delinquents, the number of troublemakers hanging around the university town's alleys had decreased significantly lately. These alleys, which used to be full of delinquents, had seen a notable reduction in their numbers over the past few days.

As a result, the local security had improved considerably.

There's a saying that goes: **“Say it, then do it!”**

Oh, wait, it’s actually **“Say it, and it’ll happen.”**

Just as Scholar Song was thinking about delinquents, a gang of them appeared right in front of him, clustered together, smoking.

There were seven in total, each sporting long hair dyed in various colors. Their faces were adorned with piercings—earrings, lip rings, and nose rings. They bit on cigarette butts, looking as if they had tattooed across their foreheads: **“I’m in my rebellious youth; I’m a delinquent.”**

The delinquents weren't targeting the tall and sturdy Scholar Song. Even among their kind, they rarely dared to provoke someone who looked as tough as him.

At that moment, the delinquents wore wicked grins, surrounding a young girl. One of the delinquents, around 1.72 meters tall, was using a wall to corner her.

“Hey, beautiful, aren’t you lonely all by yourself? How about having some fun with us?” 

“Free fun, you know, all kinds of entertainment.”

“It'll feel really good, trust me.”

“We’ll keep you company, just for you.”

“There’s a nice little shop nearby, not far at all; we can make it worthwhile for you.”

They tossed out various lewd comments and temptations.

Scholar Song turned his attention to the girl who was being cornered.

She was about 1.5 meters tall, with short hair, and despite not wearing makeup, her beauty shone through. Due to her petite size, she looked like a high school student; perhaps she was a bit older.

A girl who was both cute and pretty stood alone in the alley, drawing the attention of these delinquents. It was no surprise. So, girls should avoid going to deserted places alone.

At that moment, the girl frowned, showing obvious disgust on her face.

Even with her displeased expression, her delicate features remained adorable.

“Wow, even when you’re angry, you’re so cute. How about letting big brother take care of you?” The golden-haired delinquent, leaning against the wall, wore a smirk reminiscent of a scheming CEO. One hand pressed against the wall while the other reached out towards the girl’s face.

Scholar Song let out a sigh; he couldn't bear to watch any longer.

He clenched his fist and strode forward.

Having just consumed the body refining liquid, he found it hard to control his speed. With a little push, he shot forward like a dart.

The delinquent teasing the girl barely had time to react before Scholar Song, who had been several meters away, suddenly appeared beside them.

Scholar Song reached out with a large hand, fingers splayed, and grabbed the golden-haired delinquent by the back of the neck.

The golden-haired delinquent stood at about 1.72 meters, but Scholar Song was only slightly taller.

“Hey… can’t you see that the girl doesn’t want to play with you?” Scholar Song exerted a little force, lifting the golden-haired delinquent effortlessly off the ground.

Holy crap! Scholar Song was taken aback himself. He knew he had gained significant strength after the body refining process, but he hadn’t expected that lifting a person weighing over a hundred pounds would feel as easy as lifting a stick.
