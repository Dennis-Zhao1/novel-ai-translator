**Not Crying, Just Secreting Salt**

Scholar Song had Whale Eight momentarily stunned.

But after two breaths, when Whale Eight noticed that the 'Hollow Gourd Kid' pattern on Scholar Song's 'Qilin Arm' continued to glow red without any other change, he quickly pieced it together.

"You scoundrel, you're messing with me!" Whale Eight seethed with anger.

Whale Eight was a seemingly simple person, but deep down, he was both cunning and meticulous.

Earlier, when Scholar Song dealt with Shark Nine, he had been quite lavish with his sword talisman, and after that, he had brought out other third-tier talismans, along with some unknown means to trigger a second-tier 'Flame Blade'... Therefore, when Scholar Song tried to frighten Whale Eight with his 'Qilin Arm,' he had genuinely caught Whale Eight off guard.

It wasn't entirely Whale Eight's fault; any cultivator who wasn't simply a muscle-bound brute would be intimidated by Scholar Song's display of talismans and the 'Flame Blade' technique.

In a fit of rage and humiliation, Whale Eight let out a roar and lunged towards Scholar Song, arms wide open, aiming to crush this delicate figure into a pulp, leaving not even a bone behind!

"Hehe." Scholar Song's eyes sparkled with confidence, showing no fear whatsoever.

He raised his hand to sheathe the shattered sword back on his back, then stood there with his hands behind him... or rather, floated in the water, exposing half of his body. He lacked Whale Eight's strength, so he couldn’t stand on the water’s surface while remaining still.

"Still trying to act tough!" Whale Eight sneered, arms outstretched, ready to give Scholar Song an enthusiastic embrace.

But just then, Whale Eight suddenly felt a sharp pain in his lower back as if someone had kicked him. A searing, penetrating pain shot through him!

Following that, an unimaginable force surged from his lower back, nearly shattering it.

[Could it be that this weakling cultivator's 'Qilin Arm' attack? But how could that 'Qilin Arm' attack come from behind me?] Confusion gripped Whale Eight’s mind.

Before he could ponder further, his body was violently launched away: "Aaaaahhhh—"

In mid-air, Whale Eight's anguished cries echoed as he sailed past Scholar Song in a parabolic arc.

...

...

"Oops, couldn’t stop in time." A calm voice rang out from where Whale Eight had been just moments before.

Then, a figure dressed in snowy white, resembling a celestial being descended from the mortal realm, gracefully landed on the surface of the sea.

This figure walked on the water, yet the seawater didn’t dampen his shoes... and beside him floated a small monk and a Pekingese, held aloft by two invisible hands.

It was none other than Venerable White, who had arrived within a three-hundred-meter radius just as Whale Eight was charging at Scholar Song.

"Venerable White!" Scholar Song beamed, giving a thumbs-up. "The phrase 'couldn’t stop in time' fits perfectly, I really appreciate it!"

Venerable White: "..."

Scholar Song's choice of words today seemed off, not only strange but also dripping with a sense of provocation, as if he was mocking Venerable White's 'Ten Thousand Miles Escape Technique' for not being timely!

"Senior, you arrived just in time!" Scholar Song chuckled. "If you had been a moment later, that big guy might have turned me into a meat paste."

"An enemy?" Venerable White raised an eyebrow, turning his gaze to the Whale Eight, who was still reeling from the kick.

Whale Eight felt like his back might be broken, but he had no time to dwell on his injury. Swallowing hard, he looked up in terror at the figure clothed in white.

Especially as that white-clad figure’s gaze swept over him, Whale Eight felt a chilling aura of death... emanating from himself.

In that moment, Whale Eight realized he wasn’t as fearless as he had thought—being the golden boy of the organization, he had always believed he could disregard life and death. But right now, he was overwhelmed with a profound fear of dying.

Without hesitation, Whale Eight gritted his teeth against the excruciating pain in his lower back and dove down to the depths of the sea, hoping to escape through his superior swimming skills.

Thud!

As he prepared to plunge into the depths, it felt like he had collided with a steel plate instead of water.

The seawater had somehow solidified into a hard wall, not ice, but like a solid barrier that prevented him from diving.

Whale Eight turned in terror, looking back at that pristine figure.

The figure stood lightly on the water's surface, extending a finger and lightly beckoning toward Whale Eight—indeed, the change in the seawater had been caused by him.

To transform water into a solid wall with just a flick of the finger, what kind of terrifying power did that require?

...

...

At that moment, Scholar Song swam over to Venerable White and turned back to Whale Eight with a slight smile: "You’ve seen the power of my 'Qilin Arm,' right? Are you scared?"

"Scared my ass!" Whale Eight wanted to roar back, realizing how ridiculous the situation was. What kind of 'Qilin Arm' was this? If you can't win, just call for your elder; if you have the guts, fight me for three hundred rounds!

Immediately after, Whale Eight saw the imposing white figure and felt all his courage drain away.

This time, it seemed he was really done for.

"Oh, a second-tier cultivator, huh." Venerable White glanced at Whale Eight, rubbed his chin thoughtfully, then turned to Scholar Song. "Scholar Song, how do you want to deal with him? Should we kill him?"

Hearing Venerable White's inquiry, Scholar Song's mind sparked. Could this 'second-tier cultivator' have other uses? So he replied, "Why don’t you handle it, Senior?"

"Then let’s hand him over to the Alchemical Sage... He mentioned needing to study the amnesia seal on the mysterious island and could use a few experimental subjects of second-tier strength or above," Venerable White nodded.

"That sounds great!" Scholar Song chuckled, then added with a wry smile, "Also, Venerable White, I suspect I’ve also been to that mysterious island because I found that I’ve lost a chunk of my memory."

"Yes, you’ve been to the mysterious island." Venerable White confirmed.

"How do you know, Venerable White?" Scholar Song asked, puzzled.

"Well, I initially wanted to rescue you from the mysterious island, but it truly was a strange place, and I couldn't retrieve you. However, you were soon sent out, and I used my 'Ten Thousand Miles Escape Technique' to catch up," Venerable White explained, extending his hand toward Whale Eight.

Whale Eight found himself involuntarily pulled toward Venerable White.

The Alchemical Sage needed many second-tier and third-tier cultivators for his research. If there was a suitable experimental subject, it would be a waste not to use it.

"Damn it, I, the golden boy Whale Eight, will never serve as your experiment!" Whale Eight roared in mid-air—'experimental subject' was nothing short of a fate worse than death.

Rather than prolong his suffering, Whale Eight would rather choose to die. Grinding his teeth, he bit down on a hidden poison capsule embedded in one of his fake teeth.

This poison was deadly enough to kill even second-tier cultivators; those in his line of work always prepared such measures to ensure they could die quickly and with minimal torture.

However, just as Whale Eight crunched down on the capsule, he noticed the white figure beckoning again, causing the lethal substance to be drawn from his mouth.

"I can't let you die; we need to keep you alive to hand over to the Alchemical Sage. You're a treasure for him," Venerable White said casually, waving his right hand as a flame ignited out of thin air, incinerating the toxic substance.

Scholar Song smirked and said, "Hehe, the weak have no choice... That’s what you said. And now, I’m returning that line directly to you, big guy."

Whale Eight silently closed his eyes, his face devoid of hope.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

After capturing Whale Eight, Scholar Song recalled the girl in the black dress who had been hurt by the 'hugging sister kill': "Oh, Venerable White, there was also a girl in a black dress who was severely wounded by this big guy and fell into the sea. That big guy had a companion who was also hit by my 'sword talisman' and fell into the depths. I wonder if they're still alive?"

Lacking the strength to intervene earlier, Scholar Song could only watch helplessly as she was injured and tossed into the ocean. Now that Venerable White was here, perhaps they could check if there was still a chance to save her.

"The depths of the sea?" Venerable White nodded thoughtfully.

Then, he snapped his fingers.

With a sharp crack, the sound seemed to travel far and wide, even reaching deep beneath the ocean's surface.

About fifteen breaths later...

The sea began to roil.

"Mooh, mooh, mooh~~" A massive whale surfaced from the depths, and on its back were two pale figures.

One was Shark Nine, bearing a massive sword wound.

The other was the girl in the black dress and stockings, but her current state was dire. To put it simply, her once voluptuous S-curve had now become flatter than a tablet.

That big guy truly had no mercy; the 'hugging sister kill' was utterly ruthless.

Scholar Song called out, "Is there any hope for this girl?"

Venerable White glanced at the girl in the black dress and nodded, "She still has a breath left; we can save her. But first, we need to find a place to treat her. Hmm... you should cast a healing spell on her to keep her alive!"

"Sure thing!" Scholar Song quickly swam to the side of the giant whale and gently leapt onto its back. Then, he activated the spell on his bronze ring to cast a healing spell on the girl in the black dress.

After casting the healing spell, the injuries on the girl in the black dress somewhat improved, but with her body nearly crushed into paste, simply healing her wouldn’t be enough to restore her condition.

At best, it barely kept her alive.

As for Shark Nine, Scholar Song wasn’t about to waste a precious healing opportunity on him.

After all, he was someone who had just tried to kill him a moment ago; Scholar Song couldn't show the same level of compassion as Saint Mary. So, it would be better to let him fend for himself. If he survived, he could join Whale Eight in becoming an experimental subject for the Alchemical Sage; if not, then he’d just become a snack for the whale.

By the way, this whale looked somewhat familiar; wasn’t it the same one that had just fallen from the sky with him?

"Mooh~~" The giant whale shed tears—well, it wasn’t crying, just secreting salt!

It really wasn’t crying... Probably, maybe?
