**Temporary Sword Control Technique**

Scholar Song had just returned from the Luo Xin district. After parting ways with Tu Bo, he decided to visit the Alchemical Sage to make use of his free time for some training.

However, just then, he received a phone call from Sima Jiang.

“Ah? Where were you robbed?” Scholar Song instinctively asked.

“Not long after I picked up your package, while I was on my way to the Jiangnan headquarters of Fengshou Express, someone forced my car to stop and knocked me unconscious. Your package... it was taken by the robber,” Sima Jiang paused for a moment.

“……” Scholar Song was speechless.

He really didn’t know how to comfort this poor guy, Jiang.

At that moment, Sima Jiang changed his tone, saying, “But don’t worry, Scholar Song. Just a moment ago, we’ve already caught the robber. They’re on their way to bring him in, and I’ll make sure to get your package back! If you still trust us, I promise I will deliver it to you!”

They caught the robber?

Even though Scholar Song had long known that Jiang wasn’t an ordinary delivery guy, he didn’t expect him to have such capabilities.

“Alright then, I appreciate your efforts, Jiang,” Scholar Song replied.

Sima Jiang let out a sigh of relief, “Once I retrieve the package, I’ll call you again.”

“Sure, no problem,” Scholar Song smiled.

After hanging up the phone, Scholar Song held his phone for a moment, contemplating whether to send a text to the Alchemical Sage to report the situation. It wasn’t that he didn’t trust Sima Jiang—it was just that the flying sword was ‘borrowed’ from the Grandmaster of Profound Understanding, and such matters shouldn’t be hidden from the actual owner.

Moreover, the Alchemical Sage had mentioned that the flying sword had safety measures set by the Grandmaster. Even if it got lost, they could find it again through the imprint left by the Grandmaster on it.

He might as well throw in a little critique about the Alchemical Sage's terrible idea of sending the flying sword via courier!

After quite a while, Scholar Song finally received a laboriously typed response from the Alchemical Sage: “Young Scholar Song, I’ve sent flying swords dozens of times without a problem… You really have bad luck!”

Alchemical Sage, you could just use voice messages! Thinking about how you type makes me feel exhausted.

“However, if we’re talking about luck, I did have a bit of a rough day,” Scholar Song chuckled as he recalled the trending topic on social media about ‘Uncle vs. Young Man’… But he decided not to dwell on that!

His liver hurt just thinking about it.

After yet another long wait, the Alchemical Sage sent another message: “I just called the Grandmaster of Profound Understanding to discuss this matter. But every time I call, the big monk is in silent meditation, and all I hear is silence. I thought I was chatting with air.”

Scholar Song: “…”

Actually, Scholar Song felt that the Alchemical Sage and the Grandmaster were equally matched. The way they communicated in their group chat often left others guessing.

The strangest part was that sometimes the Alchemical Sage and the Grandmaster managed to communicate with just a single word or expression, and the people around them had no clue what they were talking about.

Perhaps it was because their wavelengths were on a channel that others couldn’t understand?

“Scholar, someone will contact you shortly through the Grandmaster of Profound Understanding,” the Alchemical Sage sent another message after a long wait.

But as soon as this message was sent, an ID with the nickname ‘Little Monk of Three Days’ added Scholar Song as a friend.

This clearly illustrated the Alchemical Sage’s slow typing speed.

Scholar Song accepted the friend request.

“Are you ‘Pressure on the Book Mountain’ Daoist friend? That’s quite a peculiar name you have,” the Little Monk of Three Days asked.

“That’s just a nickname… You can call me Scholar Song!” Scholar Song felt he needed to come up with a proper Daoist name soon; otherwise, people would start thinking ‘Pressure on the Book Mountain’ was his actual title, and that would be a disaster.

“I heard you’re still a student? Then I’ll take the liberty of calling you Junior Brother Song. I’m the sixth disciple of the Grandmaster of Profound Understanding… well, I’m a secular disciple. My master said my worldly ties were severed, and he originally planned to shave my head, but then he reinstated me. You know how my master is; he’s quite the silent type and hasn’t spoken in years. So, for any communication, we disciples have to take care of it,” the Little Monk of Three Days chuckled. “By the way, I’m sending you a document. Please receive it via chat software.”

“What is it?” Scholar Song asked, puzzled.

“It’s a technique for sensing the imprint on the flying sword, derived from the imprint on my master’s flying sword. With your mental energy, you should be able to sense the imprint within a radius of about ten meters. Take a look when you have time; it might come in handy,” the Little Monk of Three Days explained.

“If the courier company can’t find the flying sword for an extended period, perhaps this technique will be useful. If, within a month, the sword still hasn’t been found, Junior Brother, just let me know. I’ll come visit you and help look for it. After all, it’s just a flying sword for sending messages; my master will just be a bit upset about it. No need to worry,” the Little Monk of Three Days added, sending a compressed file to Scholar Song.

Scholar Song clicked to receive it.

For some simple techniques, there was no need to worry about leakage, so they could be sent directly online. However, things like martial arts manuals would be sent through flying swords for confidentiality.

The compressed file wasn’t large, and it finished downloading in less than ten seconds.

After decompressing it, Scholar Song found three files had appeared on his phone.

“Spiritual Imprint Technique”

“Imprint Sensing Method”

“Temporary Sword Control Technique”

“Why are there so many things?” Scholar Song wondered, but he still replied to the Little Monk of Three Days, “Received.”

“Just to confirm, it’s the Imprint Sensing Method, right? I have a lot of files in the compressed folder on my computer,” the Little Monk of Three Days asked.

“Yeah, I have the Imprint Sensing Method,” Scholar Song confirmed, and then added, “But there’s also the Spiritual Imprint Technique and…”

Before he could finish typing, the Little Monk of Three Days quickly replied, “Okay, that’s fine. Practice when you have time; it might come in handy. If there’s any news about the flying sword, let me know. I’ll check back in a few days.”

With that, the Little Monk of Three Days logged off in a hurry.

“And the Temporary Sword Control Technique…” Scholar Song had just finished typing when the Little Monk of Three Days was already offline. He could only smile wryly—why did his senior brother seem so rushed?

He could only send the last sentence to the Little Monk of Three Days as an offline message.

Then he opened the three files to take a look.

The Spiritual Imprint Technique… According to the introduction in the folder, it was developed by a forgetful elder.

It was common for forgetfulness to occur among mortals, but it was quite rare among cultivators, as their brains were enhanced for memory, making them generally superb in recalling things.

Yet this elder would often throw things around and then forget where he had thrown them, wasting a lot of time trying to find them.

After being quite annoyed for a long time, he developed the Spiritual Imprint Technique, which allowed him to imprint a spiritual mark on each of his important belongings. The ‘Imprint Sensing Method’ was the matching technique for it.

This way, no matter where he tossed his items, he could sense them and retrieve them easily. It was incredibly convenient!

Eventually, this technique was generously provided to his fellow cultivators and spread widely, gradually forming the current system of ‘Spiritual Imprint.’

Just like the Grandmaster of Profound Understanding’s flying sword, it matched a special sensing device, allowing it to be found effortlessly no matter where it was hidden on Earth.

These two spiritual techniques were part of a set, so Scholar Song understood why the Little Monk of Three Days would send them together. But what was this last ‘Temporary Sword Control Technique’?

He knew what Sword Control Technique was; it was probably similar to skills like sending messages with flying swords or flying on a sword.

But the question was, did Sword Control Techniques really have both regular and temporary versions?

With a curious mind, Scholar Song opened that file.

Even if it was just a temporary one, it was still a Sword Control Technique!
