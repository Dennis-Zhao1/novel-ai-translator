### Searching for Clues of the Enemy's Tracks

This was the first time Scholar Song had explored the group space. Previously, he had only focused on the chat logs, completely unaware of the bizarre files lurking within this shared digital realm.

These files were likely meant to help the senior cultivators who emerged from their closed-door meditations quickly grasp and integrate modern knowledge. But looking at them was a surprise; they could actually create legal IDs and personal information? The hidden potential of the Ninefold Land group extended to influencing the normal world as well.

“Senior, who is this Xian Gong the Benefactor?” Scholar Song asked, pointing at the last file with a puzzled expression. What kind of tragedy was this?

When the Alchemical Sage heard this question, he couldn’t help but sigh: “Ah, that was a powerful senior cultivator.”

“About two hundred years ago, the Benefactor quietly chose a desolate place to enter into closed-door cultivation. After over a hundred years of meditation... Just when he was reaching the peak of his cultivation, suddenly, an atomic bomb exploded right above his secluded spot.”

“How to put it, it was truly dangerous at that time! If it weren't for the Benefactor's immense strength, along with the hundreds of layers of defensive formations surrounding his retreat, he might have died that day. Even after surviving, he spent decades recovering. To this day, the term ‘atomic bomb’ is still a taboo for him. Anyone who dares to mention it in his presence will surely face his wrath.”

Scholar Song couldn’t help but admire this Benefactor. A figure who hovered between the realms of the extraordinary, surviving a direct attack from humanity’s ultimate weapon—the nuclear bomb—was indeed worthy of respect. He could only silently salute this elder.

The Alchemical Sage continued, his expression still tinged with concern: “In recent decades, humanity has developed at an astonishing pace. It has left us cultivators, who sometimes retreat for decades on end, feeling a bit out of touch. Recently emerged cultivators have had to learn a lot of everyday knowledge. Humanity's propensity for self-destruction has also accelerated, growing stronger each day. I’ve heard that the global stockpile of nuclear weapons could potentially obliterate humanity dozens or even hundreds of times over. Whether that’s true or not, who knows. What’s more worrisome is that some seniors fear that if they were to emerge from their meditations one day, the world might already be in ruins. And worse—what if they were deep in cultivation, enjoying their peace, when suddenly hundreds of nuclear weapons rained down from above, ending their lives without warning?”

Hundreds of nuclear weapons? Surely not! Even if humanity went crazy, they wouldn’t drop so many in one place. Just as Scholar Song was about to voice his thoughts, he suddenly remembered the peculiar situation of “nuclear weapon destruction.”

What if there was indeed a large quantity of nuclear weapons concentrated in one place for disposal and they all exploded simultaneously?

“…” At that moment, he really didn’t know how to respond to the Alchemical Sage.

Ever since meeting the cultivators in the Ninefold Land group, his preconceived image of what a ‘cultivator’ was supposed to be had been shattered. The lofty figures he imagined, with their ethereal aura, seemed to be nowhere in sight, not even a ghostly shadow.

“Found it, this one,” the Alchemical Sage said as he rummaged through the group space and pulled up a file.

**“Preliminary Research Discussion on the Application of Mental Power—By Drunken Moon Benefactor”**

The Alchemical Sage explained, “Here it is. This document contains methods for using mental power to detect any lurking threats or stalkers nearby, as well as ways for foundational cultivators to sharpen their senses with mental power, thus enhancing their vigilance. It's simple and practical. Take a look on your own time and give it a try. This document was generously provided by the Drunken Moon Benefactor at no cost.”

For the high-level seniors in the group, this foundational application of mental power was far too basic. It was akin to the Alchemical Sage announcing a “simplified liquid formula” in the group; those who found it useful would owe him a favor, while others would just glance at it.

The Alchemical Sage added, “If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. I’ll be tidying up the alchemy chamber in the morning, but I will have some free time in the afternoon, and I’ll need you to assist me in experimenting with the refining formula.”

“Thank you, senior,” Scholar Song replied, then noticed the name of the author, “Drunken Moon Benefactor”—that name sounded familiar.

He vaguely remembered that this was a senior who often chimed in during discussions, but why could he never seem to remember him?

“Haha, don’t worry about Drunken Moon. One day, when you can remember him, you’ll be calling him ‘Drunken Moon Sage’,” the Alchemical Sage chuckled.

“Sage? Is that a rank?” Scholar Song inquired, knowing that some seniors’ titles in the group related to their cultivation levels. For instance, the group leader was called the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, the deputy leader the Master of Seven Cultivations, and Fay Yu’s father was referred to as the Revered Spirit Butterfly.

“That’s a realm I can only look up to from afar, one I’ll never reach. It’s the public display of enlightenment, the Eighth Rank Profound Sage, and it’s also the realm pursued by the respected seniors in our group,” the Alchemical Sage laughed heartily. “That realm is still a long way off for you—don’t think about it too much right now.”

Scholar Song nodded and glanced at the time; it was already 6:37 PM. He needed to head back to school to prepare for his morning classes.

Before leaving, he hesitated and asked, “By the way, senior, I wanted to ask, in the current stage, does practical combat benefit me at all? I fought someone yesterday; although it was just a couple of moves, I felt like I understood the ‘Fundamental Vajra Fist’ a bit better during the process.”

“Practical combat can indeed deepen your understanding of martial arts. Just like rote learning will only lead to empty talk, applying what you’ve learned in real-life situations can bring you many benefits. If you have the chance, try to engage in more practical combat,” the Alchemical Sage agreed.

“Thank you, senior! I’ll be on my way now!” Scholar Song waved goodbye.

As he reached the door, something jogged his memory. He turned back, smiling sheepishly, “Uh, senior, one last thing. If I were to be poisoned by your toxin, would I need to buy some common herbs from a pharmacy?”

The Alchemical Sage asked, “Are you trying to use this lead to track down the assassin who poisoned you? However, since that assassin was poisoned, they must be dead by now.”

“But that assassin likely has accomplices. If I were one of them and knew my companion had died from poisoning, I would certainly be cautious of such lethal toxins and prepare an antidote just in case!” Scholar Song pondered. “If I can find that accomplice, perhaps I can follow the clues back to the mastermind. They could even be the mastermind themselves!”

“Being able to calmly analyze situations when faced with challenges is a good habit. Keep it up,” the Alchemical Sage smiled, then quickly grabbed a piece of paper and wrote down a list of herbs.

“As long as the other party is a cultivator knowledgeable about ‘herbs and poisons,’ after encountering my ‘lethal toxin,’ they will at least attempt to gather these four medicinal materials—though, of course, these four won’t be of any real use,” the Alchemical Sage said proudly.

His clever creation wasn't so easy to crack. The materials the other party might think of were merely the ‘traps’ he laid out for them. In fact, two of those herbs would only exacerbate the toxicity.

“And these four herbs are quite rare; there are likely only a few pharmacies in the entire Jiangnan region that stock them. This will also make it easier for you to find the person buying the herbs. If they do go to purchase the materials, it will leave a trail,” the Alchemical Sage added.

“Thank you, senior,” Scholar Song said as he accepted the slip of paper.

At least now he had a lead to work with in this seemingly directionless situation. What remained was to tightly grasp this thread of information and uncover the culprit behind the scenes.
