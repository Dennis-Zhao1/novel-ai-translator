**Look at Me Take Down Six!**

During the morning classes, Scholar Song was diligently paying attention to the lectures. 

Meanwhile, Dou Dou had transformed into a 'demon beast' form, one that was invisible to the human eye, and spent most of the time curled up in his drawer, playing on his phone.

As Scholar Song glanced down during class, he caught sight of Dou Dou leaving a review on a shopping website — a negative one: "Heartless store, one star! Where's the chicken flavor? I've eaten half the bag and still can’t taste any chicken! Scammers! Did their conscience get eaten by pigs?"

A cold sweat broke out on Scholar Song's forehead. 

He couldn't help but wonder what the store owner would feel after reading that review — would they be furious or just plain bewildered? 

If the store owner felt: "This is just ridiculous!" — then indeed, it was ridiculous.

But if their mood was: "I can't believe this customer! This is dog food! You ate half a bag?!" — then they would be cursing Dou Dou.

Speaking of which, no wonder Dou Dou hadn't asked him to buy anything lately; it seemed he had learned online shopping!

But who was receiving the deliveries? Don’t tell me Dou Dou was going down to fetch the packages by himself?

...

Overall, Scholar Song felt that Dou Dou was not as troublesome as some of the seniors in their group had described. Apart from enjoying a bit of mischief, as long as he was given something he liked to do, he could be entertained for a long time.

Oh, and aside from the daily rants about the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, he was quite adorable.

In fact, ever since Dou Dou came to live with him, his high and mighty image of the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain had plummeted drastically. 

Hearing Dou Dou call him "Yellow Mountain Big Fool" every day, Scholar Song was starting to confuse the names and think of the Immortal Sage as Yellow Mountain Big Fool.

After two periods, around ten in the morning, they made it through the morning classes unscathed.

With no afternoon classes, 

Tu Bo boredly asked, "Are you guys going back to the dorm to revise? The exam is tomorrow."

The final exams were approaching, and to avoid failing and having to retake a class, he needed to step up his game. A little last-minute cramming never hurt anyone.

Usually, there would be a day or two of downtime before final exams for students to review their materials. However, this year, the schedule had been tight due to the exams being moved up unexpectedly.

"I've arranged to study with Mei Yi, so I won't be joining you guys," Gao said, pushing up his glasses and leaving his single dormmate behind.

Tu Bo looked at Li Yang De with a pitiful expression.

"Don't do that; it's really disgusting. Just come over to my place today if you want. You can ask me anything you don’t understand," Li Yang De replied dismissively. It wasn't like it was a pretty girl; why act cute?

"What about Scholar Song? Want to join?" Tu Bo asked with a laugh.

"I'll check the time. If I'm free tonight, I’ll head over to Yang De's," Scholar Song replied after some thought.

He realized he needed to make sure everything was settled at home for Venerable White and Dou Dou before heading out. Otherwise, when he got back, all the appliances in his house would need an upgrade.

Nearby, Lu Fei quietly clenched her fist. She had wanted to invite Scholar Song to study in their dorm — especially since the air conditioning was broken and no one knew when it would be repaired.

With Tu Bo's interruption, she felt too shy to speak up.

Although Scholar Song had contracted the Phantom Spirit, he still carried the Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl, which maintained its cooling effect. Not to mention, the Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl was a treasure in itself. Looking back, Fay Yu had been incredibly generous.

"Going back to the dorm together?" Scholar Song asked Lu Fei. He needed to take all his textbooks back to the Alchemical Sage's building anyway, so he had to consider it; studying a bit was necessary.

"Sure!" Lu Fei replied happily.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On the other side.

The Sunflower Cultivator looked nervous. "The 'Mountain of Books Pressure' just got out of class. Are you all ready?"

Beside him stood six cold-faced men dressed in black, all exuding a strong aura of hostility. They were subordinates of that 'Leader' from the neighboring city’s Luo Xin district, whom the Sunflower Cultivator had managed to recruit through various means.

"Good, then let’s prepare for action!" the Sunflower Cultivator said in a low voice. "Inform the street office members to assist the 'White' cultivator in applying for a temporary residence permit. Let’s drag this out for a bit longer."

In modern society, there were numerous ways to delay someone.

"We're going to ambush 'Mountain of Books Pressure.' Remember, speed is key. If the 'White' cultivator catches wind of this, we’re done for."

"This opportunity only comes once. Go!"

...

...

After dropping Lu Fei off at her dorm, Scholar Song retrieved his study materials from his own dorm before heading back towards the Alchemical Sage's building.

Dou Dou was perched on his shoulder, absorbed in a mobile game.

As they passed down a narrow path, Scholar Song suddenly halted.

Though the path was small, it usually saw plenty of foot traffic.

But now, there wasn’t a single person around...

"Good awareness," Dou Dou praised.

"How many of them are there?" Scholar Song asked, knowing someone was definitely planning to strike.

"There are seven in total. Five of them are about as strong as you, around the first or second openings. One is at the third opening, and the last one is that handsome, burly guy who followed you last time, at the fifth opening, nearly at the threshold of the Dragon Gate. But that guy is sneaky, hiding at the back, thinking I can’t see him. Hah!" Dou Dou confidently reported the ambushers' numbers and positions.

Even though those hiding were suppressing their auras, to Dou Dou, they appeared as bright as the moon in the night sky.

Scholar Song checked the items he had on him.

One Stinky Pill. 

One Sword Talisman. 

Three Armor Talismans. 

Eight Anti-Demonic Talismans. 

And finally, a mysterious ancient copper ring of unknown effects.

"Dou Dou, you’ll help me out, right?" Scholar Song asked.

Dou Dou replied boldly, "Of course! When you’re gravely wounded and on the brink of death, I’ll drag you away. Don’t worry about it!"

"Alright, that works for me," Scholar Song chuckled, tossing his backpack aside and willingly stepping into the ambush set by the Sunflower Cultivator.

Dou Dou lightly jumped to the side.

"Come out," Scholar Song stretched and loosened his muscles. "There are six of you, and I see all of you clearly now. No need to hide anymore."

He deliberately concealed one of the numbers to make the Sunflower Cultivator think he wasn't aware yet.

As soon as Scholar Song finished speaking, six figures leaped out from all directions. They brandished a type of standard-issue blade with no handles, thrusting at Scholar Song from sharp angles.

No-handle blades, the leader’s subordinates, Scholar Song thought to himself.

At that moment, if only he had enough mental energy to activate his Eye Opening talent 'Expert Vision,' it would surely be exhilarating. Unfortunately, doing so would deplete his vitality and spirit fully. He would have to wait until he opened two more openings for that talent to take effect.

So, Scholar Song opted to activate an Armor Talisman.

The Armor Talisman could block all attacks from cultivators below the third rank, and even the leader couldn’t break through its defenses. These cultivators, with only one to three openings, couldn’t hurt Scholar Song in the slightest, even if they exerted all their strength.

‘Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang!’ The six no-handle blades struck against Scholar Song, sparking a flurry of sparks.

The six subordinates of the leader looked astonished; their sharp blades kept piercing, slicing, and stabbing, yet they couldn’t break through Scholar Song’s defense.

"Speed's not that impressive," Scholar Song thought to himself. After activating the Eye Opening, as long as he focused, he could see all the movements of these one or two-opening cultivators clearly.

This was the effect of having a superior foundational technique.

The leader was a rogue cultivator, gathering the most basic foundational techniques he could find for his subordinates to train with.

Meanwhile, Scholar Song possessed the 'Diamond Foundation Fist Technique' and 'True Self Meditation Scripture,' both regarded as excellent foundational techniques even by the seniors of the Ninefold Land group.

The difference was glaring.

"Foundation Fist Technique, Two!" Scholar Song silently recited the fist technique's mantra, channeling his blood and energy through his heart and eye openings, with the assistance of the natural spiritual energy.

His fists shot out like meteors!

In the blink of an eye, he unleashed nearly forty punches, landing multiple hits on each subordinate.

They had no treasures to protect them, and after taking Scholar Song's punches head-on, the six subordinates were sent flying, crashing against the wall and spitting blood.

Only one, the cultivator at the third opening, managed to dodge the fatal blow, while the other five lay incapacitated, their fates unknown.

Scholar Song clenched his fists, reveling in the feeling — their punches and weapons couldn’t breach his defenses, yet with a single strike, he could nearly take half their lives!

Perhaps this could be his fighting style moving forward?

That thought flickered momentarily, before Scholar Song pushed off hard against the ground, charging towards the cultivator at the third opening, aiming to seize the moment!

"Foundation Fist Technique, One!" His fist struck like a heavy cannon — this was Scholar Song’s strongest punch.

That cultivator, experienced in battle, had merely been momentarily flustered by Scholar Song's intimidating defenses. Now, he twisted his body to evade the path of the punch.

At the same time, eight no-handle blades manifested in his fingers, hurling them at Scholar Song.

Clang, clang, clang, clang — a series of impacts echoed as the blades struck Scholar Song, creating sparks before being deflected by the Armor Talisman's power.

At this moment, Scholar Song smirked, as his powerful punch suddenly twisted in an unexpected manner, striking like a cunning serpent, landing solidly on the third-opening cultivator's chest.

The third-opening cultivator spat blood, his chest protector shattered by the force. But the weight of Scholar Song's punch still surged into him, sending him flying.

Though lacking in combat experience, Scholar Song had watched plenty of martial arts films growing up. He felt an overwhelming sense of pride.

In truth... it wasn't so much that the martial arts films were great.

It was entirely due to the opponent's 'lack of information' and 'underestimation.'

In their intelligence, Scholar Song was merely a lucky guy who had stumbled upon a high-level master, obtained pills and techniques, and recently opened his heart aperture. To them, he was just a rookie with little combat experience, easily subdued.

They never imagined that Scholar Song had already opened two apertures, and was equipped with a formidable defensive talisman.
