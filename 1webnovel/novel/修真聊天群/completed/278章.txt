**Fate is Fixed, What a Coincidence!**

Coincidence: It refers to a perfect match! Originating from Volume Nine of "The Initial Collection of Shocking Cases": "It can be seen that fate is fixed, what a coincidence."

Zhuge Zhongyang sent someone to pick Scholar Song up at the airport.

As he got out of the car, Scholar Song adjusted his shoulder bag and immediately spotted Zhuge Zhongyang, Zhuge Yue, a certain Gao, Mei Yi, and Tu Bo.

On the other side stood the strikingly confident Lu Fei, along with a more mature version of her—likely her older sister, who was Zhuge Zhongyang's date for the evening.

A certain Gao had once bet with Scholar Song that if Zhuge Zhongyang and Lu Fei's sister happened to meet and were given a chance to be alone together for just three minutes, their date would surely end in disaster! After all, with Zhuge Zhongyang’s shameless personality, he would never be able to find a girlfriend for life.

Seeing Gao's smug expression at that time, Scholar Song had wanted to remind him: If Zhuge Zhongyang couldn't find a suitable girlfriend, he would just cling to Gao forever.

But seeing Gao so pleased with himself, Scholar Song couldn’t bear to ruin his mood!

……

“Hmm?” Upon seeing everyone, Scholar Song’s gaze drifted back to Zhuge Yue.

Today, Zhuge Yue was acting strangely; it was rare to see her looking so awkward, hiding behind Zhuge Zhongyang and Gao, refusing to come out.

What’s going on?

With Zhuge Yue’s usual personality, how could she be so quiet?

Had something happened?

Scholar Song continued to glance at the others next to Lu Fei.

Then, in an instant, he saw someone he absolutely didn’t want to encounter.

It was a tall, middle-aged foreigner… beaming with health.

Next to him was a blonde girl of mixed descent, who was laughing and chatting with Lu Fei; the two seemed to have a good relationship.

At the sight of that tall foreigner, Scholar Song felt an overwhelming urge to sprout six more legs and dash back into the car!

Why? Because this foreigner was named Joseph Guy Maupassant.

Many might have forgotten this name, as he didn’t appear often. But once "The Era Calls" was mentioned, everyone would remember who he was!

What a coincidence could this be?

Scholar Song thought he would never see this so-called ‘disciple’ Joseph again, considering how vast Jiangnan University Town was, with so many students. Given such a large population, the chances of running into a student’s parent again were minuscule!

But fate had other plans!

Joseph Guy Maupassant stood right beside Lu Fei, wearing a calm smile.

Scholar Song quickly realized why Zhuge Yue was suddenly acting awkward and reluctant to show herself—because she had once posted a video online.

The title of that video was “I Laughed So Hard! Please Watch the True Face of Huaxia Kung Fu Through Foreign Eyes!”

The star of that video was none other than a drunken Joseph Guy Maupassant.

Scholar Song instinctively reached for the transformation brooch he borrowed from Fay Yu, hoping to change his appearance.

However… it was too late.

As he approached Gao, Zhuge Zhongyang, and the others, Joseph's surprised expression quickly turned into one of warmth and joy!

“Master! Master!” Joseph Guy Maupassant sprinted toward Scholar Song at full speed, calling out in less-than-perfect Chinese.

Then, he enveloped Scholar Song in a tight, enthusiastic bear hug.

“Master, I can’t believe I’d see you here! We must be truly destined!” Joseph laughed heartily.

“Hehe, yes, truly destined.” Scholar Song chuckled awkwardly—what a destiny indeed, this was nothing short of a curse!

In a world so vast, where the population could only be counted in hundreds of millions, how could he possibly run into Joseph again? What a coincidence!

……

Behind him, Gao, Zhuge Zhongyang, and the blonde girl were momentarily stunned by Joseph's exuberant dash toward Scholar Song.

Gao and Tu Bo were both puzzled, wondering why Scholar Song received such a warm reception from Joseph. When did Scholar Song and this Joseph become so close?

Then, when Joseph shouted “Master! Master!” some of them suddenly realized.

“Pfft!!” Gao, who was drinking water, ended up spraying it all over Zhuge Zhongyang standing next to him.

It turned out… the video Zhuge Yue posted featured Joseph mentioning meeting a ‘martial arts master’ during his daughter’s sports day—that master was Scholar Song!

Who would have guessed that Scholar Song could be so mischievous, teaching someone the “Era Calls” as if it were a legendary martial art?

Zhuge Yue’s face flushed red; she wanted to laugh but couldn’t.

After all, she was the one who posted the video, and just moments ago, Joseph’s daughter had caught her red-handed and had scolded her terribly.

If Joseph’s daughter had been the type to shout and curse, Zhuge Yue might have felt a bit better about it.

But unfortunately, Joseph’s daughter was the epitome of grace—soft-spoken and patient. She had caught Zhuge Yue and had instead expressed her complaints in a gentle, melancholic tone for nearly twenty minutes.

Zhuge Yue was genuinely scared; that was the type of person she was least adept at dealing with!

“Master, the martial arts you taught me are amazing. I practice diligently every day, and I feel my body getting much stronger recently.” Joseph enthusiastically told Scholar Song.

—It seems he still didn’t realize that the “Era Calls” he learned from Scholar Song was merely a set of calisthenics?

Well, given his daughter’s nature, she probably wouldn’t have the heart to shatter her father’s illusions. Besides, doing calisthenics was definitely beneficial for one’s health.

And Joseph, unless someone pointed it out, would remain blissfully unaware of the truth—because he had witnessed Scholar Song training in that abandoned classroom.

Every punch Scholar Song threw would create sounds as if the air itself was exploding! It wasn’t a movie effect; it was true “Chinese Kung Fu!”

Thus, Joseph, who had harbored a lifelong “Kung Fu Dream,” firmly believed in it.

“Hahaha, it must be your hard work paying off.” Scholar Song chuckled dryly. As he embraced Joseph, he noticed that Joseph’s physique had indeed improved quite a bit!

This enhancement was evident!

Sweat dripped down; just how many times of calisthenics did one have to do daily to see such significant improvements in just a month?

Scholar Song felt a bit guilty toward his so-called ‘disciple.’

But he was also helpless; the “Diamond Basic Fist Technique,” “True Self Meditation Scripture,” and “Immovable Diamond Body” were all techniques that couldn’t be shared without the consent of the Master of Enlightenment.

And the price of getting that consent was something Scholar Song currently couldn’t afford.

The “Flame Blade” he received in his dreams was something that the ancestor Chi Xiaozu had not explicitly forbidden him from sharing. However… this blade technique surely concealed some mysteries. As long as he wasn’t out of his mind, he wouldn’t pass on the “Flame Blade” to anyone else.

Reflecting on his own so-called ‘master,’ he realized he had received no substantial teaching at all…

“Thank you for the compliment, Master, but it’s a pity my time is limited. I can only practice thirty times a day. By the way, Master, when will I be able to cultivate that warm flow sensation in my body?” Joseph asked eagerly, wishing he could punch the air and make it crackle like Scholar Song did back then!

If he could truly burst the air, he’d have no regrets in this life.

“Hahaha, that’s hard to say. Each person’s innate talent, the martial arts practiced, and the time needed all vary.” Scholar Song sighed. “Moreover, you’ve missed the best age for practicing, so it will take you longer.”

Not only Joseph, but Scholar Song himself had missed the optimal age for cultivation, making his efforts yield little reward.

“I understand, Master. I will work even harder from now on!” Joseph declared, clapping his chest, then enthusiastically pulled Scholar Song toward the blonde girl, “Come, Master! Let me introduce you to my daughter. Speaking of which, she’s also a student at Jiangnan University Town, just like you!”

What?!

Joseph’s daughter is here too?

Scholar Song felt like thunder struck him out of nowhere—this was it, this time it was really over.

……

The beautiful blonde girl stood quietly, patiently waiting for her father to present the ‘culprit’ to her.

“Master, this is my daughter, Shuangxue Maupassant. Her Chinese name is Ji Shuangxue, taking her mother’s surname!” Joseph happily introduced, beaming with pride at his daughter.

“And then, Master… eh? What is your name again?” Joseph scratched his head, a bit embarrassed as he turned to Scholar Song.

He realized he hadn’t yet asked his ‘Master’ for his full name!

“Hello, Scholar Song.” At that moment, Ji Shuangxue spoke softly, extending her delicate hand toward Scholar Song—she had already learned his name through Lu Fei.

“Hello, Ji Shuangxue.” Scholar Song forced a smile as he gently shook her hand.

Beside them, Lu Fei wanted to laugh but felt it wasn’t appropriate, her cheeks flushed red. Lu Fei’s older sister stood there, completely confused, not understanding the situation.

Scholar Song’s gaze brushed past Lu Fei, who stuck out her tongue at him, making a silly face.

Scholar Song’s smile turned even more bitter.

Heaven may allow one to survive misfortunes, but self-inflicted calamities are inescapable!
