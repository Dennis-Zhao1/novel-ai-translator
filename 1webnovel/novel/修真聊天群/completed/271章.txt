**The Enlightenment of the Savages**

This fake "Limitless Pursuit Order" was merely a bait set up by Young Master Hai to lure that mysterious "masked man" into attacking Scholar Song…

“Seriously, can’t anyone think for a moment? Do you really think a Limitless Pursuit Order would be printed on ordinary white paper? Ha!” Young Master Hai controlled the slightly plump middle-aged man and ripped apart the so-called "Limitless Pursuit Order."

Then, he reached back to grasp the small golden hairpin at the back of his head and gave it a gentle tug.

With the hairpin pulled down, the connection between him and the middle-aged man was severed.

The middle-aged man, still clutching the hairpin, collapsed back to the ground, unconscious—when he woke up, he would likely just think he had drunk too much and ended up sleeping on the rooftop all night. Perhaps he’d even feel happy about the small golden hairpin he found in his hand?

Meanwhile, in Scholar Song’s room…

Venerable White had a slight smile playing at the corners of his mouth. “So it turns out they are from the Limitless Demon Sect. I’ve always wanted to find out where the headquarters of the Limitless Demon Sect is hidden… Perhaps this time, I can find some clues.”

The mental dominance of Venerable White was not something that could be easily dismissed.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

The following morning.

Scholar Song woke up at eight o'clock, having slept longer than usual.

Last night’s chaos had left him a bit weary, and he had unintentionally allowed himself to sleep in.

“Awake now?” Venerable White turned his head and smiled.

At this moment, Venerable White was watching a movie on his computer while chatting in a group.

The movie was—oh no! It was from the Fast and Furious series! Scholar Song felt an overwhelming urge to jump up and change the movie to a “Safe Driving Traffic Regulations” video.

In the chat group, a few seniors were bubbling with conversation.

As Venerable White turned slightly, Scholar Song caught sight of the group screen where the master of the Seven Lives Symbol was seeking help: “Fellow Daoists in the group, could someone send me a language teacher? I’m feeling quite forlorn!”

“Pfft…” The moment Scholar Song read this, he couldn't help but spit out his drink.

What did he mean by sending a language teacher over?

Senior, a language teacher is a person, not a package that you can send via express delivery…

Hold on, didn’t Fay Yu and Sable Sixteen come over via express delivery? Could it be that in the minds of the seniors in the group, express delivery could ship people too?

The Alchemical Sage: “What happened, Seven Lives? Why do you need a language teacher?”

As expected, the seniors in the group were curious about “why send a language teacher” rather than “can we actually send a language teacher?” Their understanding of “express delivery” was clearly problematic!

This issue was serious; it could lead to fatal consequences.

At this moment, the Hermit of North River spoke up: “If I recall correctly, Seven Lives, you’re on some small island in the world, teaching the local savages to read? Did something go wrong during the literacy process?”

“Sigh, don’t mention it. Those savages are as dull as dogs! I spent so much effort teaching them to recite the ‘Three Character Classic,’ and as soon as I turned my back, they forgot it again.

No matter how much I hit their palms or hung them up to beat them, it was all for nothing.

Even now, their pronunciation is completely off, and they often recite it in the wrong order. Has it been two months already? They still frequently start the ‘Three Character Classic’ with: ‘At the beginning of man, grind tofu!’ What on earth! I never taught them that!” The master of the Seven Lives Symbol was at his wits' end.

As soon as he finished speaking, an ID popped up in the Ninefold Land group.

The ID was "I Am the Owner of the Great Fool of Yellow Mountain, Little Dou Dou," who spoke: “Woof woof, Seven Lives, I can’t just ignore what you just said! What do you mean by dull as stupid dogs? I’ll bite you! Woof woof!”

Master of the Seven Lives Symbol: “…”

I Am the Owner of the Great Fool of Yellow Mountain, Little Dou Dou: “Woof woof, apologize quickly, or I will bite you to death!”

Master of the Seven Lives Symbol: “@Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, your Dou Dou has come out.”

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain quickly appeared but was left speechless: “…”

Master of the Seven Lives Symbol: “Look at what your Dou Dou is called.”

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain: “…”

The Hermit of North River laughed heartily: “@Scholar Song, is Dou Dou by your side?”

Wild Blade of Three Tides: “Dou Dou’s ID, hahahaha, that’s hilarious! When did Dou Dou become the owner of the Great Fool of Yellow Mountain?”

The Hermit of North River: “… Three Tides, [wave goodbye emoji].”

Wild Blade of Three Tides: “?”

Wild Blade of Three Tides: “Crap, I directly copied the message from Dou Dou’s ID, and it was a mistake.”

System Notification: [Wild Blade of Three Tides has retracted a message.]

Three Tides quickly retracted his first message.

He then hurriedly typed again: “Senior Yellow Mountain, you saw it, I was careless. Please forgive me this one time since it was unintentional and I retracted it so quickly?” He added a cute emoji.

“Ha ha.” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain said, “Too late.”

[System Notification: (＊＊＊＊＊＊) Wild Blade of Three Tides has been muted by the group owner Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain for 1 hour.]

Though it was “too late,” he was only muted for an hour.

…

…

Venerable White glanced at the group chat records and nodded in satisfaction. “The fellows in the group are still so lively, that’s great.”

“Lively?” Scholar Song forced a dry laugh, feeling this was just the daily routine of Three Tides getting himself into trouble. “Wait a moment, Senior, can I borrow your computer?”

“Sure.” Venerable White stood up from his chair.

Scholar Song quickly used Venerable White’s account to type: “Dou Dou, where are you right now? Come back immediately with the little monk!”

I Am the Owner of the Great Fool of Yellow Mountain, Little Dou Dou: “You scared the life out of me! I thought Venerable White was furious, but it turns out it’s you using his account? Tsk tsk, Scholar Song, you’re really too young and naive—if you have the guts, come catch me!”

Then, I Am the Owner of the Great Fool of Yellow Mountain, Little Dou Dou added: “Scholar Song, I’m Guo Guo. If you don’t make me poop out my guts, I might consider coming back earlier! But you have to guarantee and swear it in front of everyone in the group.”

Scholar Song gritted his teeth: “Hehehe, you two are truly something!”

I Am the Owner of the Great Fool of Yellow Mountain, Little Dou Dou: “Catch me, catch me, just like the Great Fool of Yellow Mountain, if you have the guts, come and catch me back!”

The Wandering Monk Tong Xuan: “…”

The Wandering Monk Tong Xuan: “[sweat emoji] [cleaver emoji]”

Tong Xuan silently logged off.

Far away on the small island, the little monk Guo Guo’s face turned pale upon seeing Master Tong Xuan’s two emojis—oh no! He forgot that Master Tong Xuan was also in the group! What should he do? If it came to it, not only would Scholar Song make him poop his guts out, Master Tong Xuan would definitely make him poop and pee!

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain: “Little Friend Scholar Song, Dou Dou and the little monk Guo Guo, I will have someone bring them back. For now, let’s leave it at that.”

Then, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, using his group owner privileges, changed Dou Dou’s name.

After that, the great mute spell was cast.

[System Notification: (＊＊＊＊＊＊) I Am the Loyal Dog of the Great Yellow Mountain has been muted by the group owner Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain for 1 day.]

Scholar Song: “…”

It seemed that Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain played a significant role in turning Dou Dou into a fool, didn’t he?

The farce caused by Dou Dou ultimately ended with both Dou Dou and Wild Blade of Three Tides being muted, along with the little monk receiving a ‘pale face’ care package from Master Tong Xuan.

…

…

Master of the Seven Lives Symbol: “Let’s not get sidetracked, Dou Dou has already led the topic astray. Speaking of which, can anyone send me a language teacher? I urgently need one! I feel like I’m going to commit homicide against these savages! My sword in hand is trembling; I’m nearing the limit of my patience.”

Scholar Song quickly replied using Venerable White’s account: “Just a reminder, Senior, express delivery cannot be used to send people. A language teacher is not a product; you cannot send them via express delivery… It could lead to fatalities!”

“Forget about these details! If it really doesn’t work, just send a plane to bring a language teacher over! Just help me solve this problem, ah ah ah ah!” The master of the Seven Lives Symbol was clearly driven to the brink of madness by that group of savages.

The Alchemical Sage said, “Does anyone have an investment in the education sector? We could send a teacher over. I remember there’s a fellow Daoist in the group… seems to be called Drunken Sun? That Daoist practices a rather peculiar cultivation method; I always forget his full name. Anyway, he has a few educational enterprises, right? From elementary school to university!”

The designated Drunken Moon Immortal quietly appeared: “…”

Drunken Moon Immortal felt forlorn; his cultivation method was special, and he couldn’t reveal himself until he reached the eighth level of the Mystic Sage. Hence, he often felt overlooked by the fellow Daoists in the group.

Unknowingly, he had become the number one invisible person in the Ninefold Land group.

No matter how he tried to show his presence, no matter how many comments and posts he made, no matter how he tried to flood the chat, his fellow Daoists would often forget about him for no reason.

Although he knew it was due to his cultivation method, he couldn’t help but feel a bit melancholic…

Drunken Moon Immortal: “I’m sorry I can’t make you remember my Dao name. Sigh. I do have a few schools, but it’s summer vacation now, and the teachers are all on break. I can contact someone for Seven Lives to see if a language teacher would be willing to go abroad to teach the savages Chinese… but I can’t guarantee success!”

“Thank you so much, Drunken Sun!” The master of the Seven Lives Symbol was teary-eyed: “I will be eternally grateful for this great kindness.”

Drunken Moon Immortal: “Seven Lives, I’m Drunken Moon! Drunken Moon! Sigh… I don’t ask for eternal gratitude; I just hope you remember my Dao name!”

Master of the Seven Lives Symbol: “[shy emoji]”

At this moment, Scholar Song thought for a moment and then used Venerable White’s account to say: “Senior Seven Lives, I would like to ask, have you taught the savages to use ‘Pinyin’? If you use Pinyin, it might be easier for them to remember the characters?”

“Pinyin… I actually forgot about that.” The master of the Seven Lives Symbol chuckled awkwardly—after all, when he learned Chinese characters, he was only taught the ‘Three Character Classic’ and such.

Scholar Song silently mourned for those savages who got their palms slapped and were hung up for beatings…
