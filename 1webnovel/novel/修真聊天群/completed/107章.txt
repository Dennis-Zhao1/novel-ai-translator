**The Seven Glorious Fruits and the Celestial Farmer Sect!**

Scholar Song headed towards the break room in search of Zhao Yay, his mind racing with thoughts. 

As he approached, he bumped into a bespectacled female doctor who had just finished her shift and was heading for a break. She smiled warmly at him, "Oh, Scholar Song!"

"Hello, Doctor Li." He responded with an awkward grin. He had to be bashful; otherwise, Doctor Li's intense gaze always seemed to pressure him.

Inside the break room, Zhao Yay had already packed her things. Spotting Scholar Song, she waved cheerfully, "Scholar Song, you're here!"

Seeing her bright smile made Scholar Song’s heart flutter with unease—had Zhao Yay already come across the post titled ‘Uncle One Punch vs. Young Man’?

"What time is your ticket?" He quickly diverted the topic, refusing to let their conversation drift towards the embarrassing ‘Uncle vs. Young Man’ discussion.

Zhao Yay checked her phone for her ticket information and replied, "It's for three o'clock this afternoon."

"Then, Sister Yay, I'll go sign in at the car management school this afternoon and come to send you off at the station! For now, I’m going to take a stroll!" Scholar Song decided to make a hasty exit.

Without waiting for Zhao Yay's response, he dashed off like the wind…

"What kind of performance is your brother putting on?" Doctor Li looked at Zhao Yay in confusion. Scholar Song had rushed in with such fervor only to leave in a hurry—what was that about?

"I have no idea," Zhao Yay admitted, equally baffled. She then asked, "What about the patient in Room 570 of Building 8B? Did you manage to see her?"

"I gave her another two pain relief injections... She's been coming in more frequently lately, and the effectiveness of the injections seems to be dwindling." Doctor Li rubbed her temples wearily.

Every time she saw that young girl wearing a brave face, she couldn't help but feel a pang in her heart. Why did she have to suffer such severe injuries? And why had none of her family members visited her all this time?

……

……

After wandering around the hospital for a while, Scholar Song suddenly stopped in his tracks.

He spotted a middle-aged man in business attire striding purposefully deeper into the hospital. This man, who seemed weighed down by the burdens of life, looked oddly familiar.

Scholar Song inhaled deeply, unable to suppress his admiration for fate's cruel sense of humor—what a twisted connection!

Hadn't he just seen this guy every single day?

A sudden impulse surged within him to march up and give the man a punch, but the thought of reenacting the ‘Uncle punches Young Man’ scene in the hospital sent shivers down his spine. If that happened... he’d never hear the end of it!

"By the way, last time I saw that uncle in the hospital, he seemed to be looking for someone in the ward. Could it be that he has relatives admitted here?" Scholar Song pondered—could this be an opportunity?

If the uncle truly had family members in the hospital, then perhaps he could explain things thoroughly in front of them. Even if the uncle was clueless, surely his family wouldn't be that naive, right?

And then… he would definitely prepare a solid script of at least ten thousand words to eloquently educate this ridiculous uncle on the importance of basic trust between people!

Imagining the uncle's shamefaced expression as he sat on a small stool, listening intently while Scholar Song passionately poured out his heartfelt monologue—what a beautiful sight that would be!

Thus, Scholar Song cautiously trailed behind the uncle.

He knew the man had sharp instincts; looking at him for too long might give him away. So, he had to be extra careful not to stare for too long.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

The uncle hurriedly advanced, following the scent of the 'Su Clan's junior.' Last time in the Luoxin district, he had been interrupted by that conman and lost track of the Su Clan’s descendant.

This time, he wouldn’t let anyone disturb him!

Today, he was determined to capture the Su Clan’s junior! The uncle roared internally.

Lady Luck was on his side today; the Su Clan's junior hadn’t had the chance to hide their presence this time. The uncle followed the scent and finally stopped at the door of Room 570.

This was it!

You have nowhere to escape this time, Su Clan descendant!

Feeling a warmth in his eyes, the uncle reached out to push open the ward door.

Just as he did, the door suddenly swung open on its own.

Discovered?

The uncle jumped back in shock, exaggerating his movements.

Inside the ward, a nurse had just opened the door and was startled by the uncle's sudden retreat.

"What are you doing? No jumping around in the hospital; it’s dangerous!" The young nurse frowned and scolded.

"I'm sorry." The ridiculous uncle readily admitted his fault.

"Be careful; this is a hospital. What if you bump into someone who’s about to assist a patient?" The nurse reprimanded him a bit more, but seeing the uncle's sincere attitude, she finally let him go and turned to leave.

The ridiculous uncle let out a quiet sigh of relief. Once the nurse was out of sight, he stealthily approached Room 570 again, pushing the door open—it hadn’t been locked after the nurse left.

Inside Room 570, a young girl lay in bed, having just received a pain relief injection, her body feeling utterly drained.

"Found you." The uncle's face twisted into a sinister grin, resembling a wolf spotting Little Red Riding Hood.

"Who are you?" The girl turned her cold gaze towards the uncle as he entered.

"I found you, descendant of Su Clan A Qi." The uncle growled through gritted teeth, his expression contorted.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

"Does the uncle have relatives in here?" Scholar Song's heart raced as he saw the ridiculous uncle push the door into a ward.

He crept closer but didn’t enter—he wanted to first determine the relationship between the uncle and the patient inside before making any further decisions.

Just then, a cold female voice drifted from the ward, "Do you have a grudge against A Qi?"

"Su Clan A Qi, he’s gone too far!" The uncle's voice was laced with resentment, "Six days ago, he barged into my Celestial Farmer Sect, stole our sect’s treasure—the Seven Glorious Fruits—and injured eighteen disciples of our sect!"

"Indeed, our Celestial Farmer Sect is just a small sect, not comparable to your Su Clan. But we won’t be easy prey! Even if it costs us everything, we’ll make you Su Clan pay the price!"

"Six days ago? A Qi stole your treasure? And injured your disciples?" The cold female voice frowned. She knew A Qi’s intention in seeking the ‘Seven Glorious Fruits’—it must have been to treat the injuries he sustained from the heavenly tribulation.

However, the uncle's claim of A Qi robbing their sect’s treasure and injuring their disciples sounded far-fetched!

With a soft sigh, the girl replied, "While I believe A Qi wouldn’t do something as lowly as robbing your sect’s treasure, if it truly was A Qi’s doing, I’ll ensure he returns your sect’s treasure! The Celestial Farmer Sect’s losses will be compensated by the Su Clan. How does that sound?"

……

……

‘Su Clan A Qi?’ Scholar Song thought, struck by a realization while eavesdropping outside.

Could it be that the Su Clan A Qi the uncle mentioned was the same one from the Ninefold Land’s chat group?

If they were indeed the same person, then who was the girl in the ward? From the sound of her voice, she seemed to have the authority to influence Su Clan A Qi’s actions.

What was I thinking—of course, it’s Su Clan Sable Sixteen! Scholar Song pressed his temples, trying to process the situation.
