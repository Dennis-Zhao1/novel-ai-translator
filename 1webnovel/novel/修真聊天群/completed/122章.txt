**The Mark on the Flying Sword**

Scholar Song and Fay Yu exited the hidden chamber.

Fay Yu led the way as they made their way into the living room. 

On the sofa, the elder from the Celestial Farmer Sect opened his eyes and coldly stared at the two. “You’ve finally come out. I knew you wouldn’t leave this suite.”

He had suspected they were hiding somewhere in the house. If not for the concern that demolishing the building would attract the attention of the ordinary people in the entire building, he would have already started tearing the room apart.

“You shouldn’t have stayed here,” Fay Yu said, her voice cool and detached.

“Why shouldn’t I stay?” the elder shouted angrily, rising to his feet.

At the same time, the bones in his body cracked ominously, and his hands curled into claws, with true energy swirling around each fingertip, sharp as blades.

Fay Yu’s expression remained calm as she slowly raised her right arm, forming a blade with her palm. “Come at me.”

Compared to the elder from the Celestial Farmer Sect, she appeared petite and fragile, like a gentle flower in the wind. Yet, as her arm lifted, a domineering aura radiated from her, commanding attention.

Her radiant white palm seemed to transform into a divine weapon capable of splitting heaven and earth, and a dazzling blade light erupted forth.

Under the pressure of her aura, the elder roared and leaped into the air, like an eagle spreading its wings, attempting to break through Fay Yu's oppressive force with an aggressive assault.

Ordinary martial artists would be at a disadvantage in mid-air, unable to gain leverage. But the elder’s attack defied logic; suspended in the air, his clawed hands descended in a flurry, creating layers of claw shadows that enveloped Fay Yu.

Without any flashy moves, Fay Yu met the elder’s onslaught with a single, decisive strike, her hand slicing through the air like a knife.

In an instant, blade light flashed, and the force surged forth like the roaring waters of the Yellow River!

The elder’s claw technique was formidable, yet it was simply insufficient to contend against the overwhelming might of the flowing river.

Swish!

The relentless wave of her blade cut through the elder’s claws, leaving his hands bloodied and mangled as he was sent crashing into the living room furniture, scattering items everywhere before collapsing heavily onto the floor.

The third-grade postnatal practitioner was simply not a match for someone of the second-grade true energy level. Even a severely injured postnatal practitioner could easily defeat a second-grade true master if they still retained their ability to strike.

After delivering the blow, Fay Yu’s face paled, and her breath quickened.

The elder slowly rose from the ground, trembling with blood pouring from his injuries.

“I held back with that blow… In three days, I’ll send Su Clan’s A-Seventeen to clarify matters with you Celestial Farmer Sect, and settle this once and for all. Until then, mind yourself. You can leave for now; I won’t take your life… for the moment.” Fay Yu’s voice was steady but stern.

“Impossible! As long as I’m alive, I won’t leave!” The elder’s gaze twisted with rage. “Even if it costs me my life, I will take you back! And after that last strike, how much true energy do you have left?”

Fay Yu frowned, her expression growing impatient. “Then go die.”

She was tired of this self-righteous stubborn old man. Lifting her crystalline hand once more, blade light flickered ominously.

Did he really think she was a pushover like Scholar Song behind her? If he wished for death, she would oblige!

“Roar!” The elder lunged at her, his legs infused with true energy, spinning through the air like a venomous dragon, attacking Fay Yu head-on.

Boom!

As they collided again, their energies exploded with a terrifying roar.

“Ahhhhh!” Suddenly, the elder emitted a strange, agonizing scream. In the next moment, his body arced in an odd trajectory, plummeting towards the suite’s balcony.

Crash! Decorative items on the balcony were shattered under his weight.

In the next instant, the elder leaped off the balcony, dragging his injured body away while leaving behind a parting remark: “You wait for me, Su Clan junior. I will return!”

With that, he fled without looking back.

—He escaped, just like that.

Just moments ago, he had been brimming with confidence, ready to face death; the next, he was running away after a few parting words.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

“Impressive!” Scholar Song marveled inwardly—he could barely follow the duel between Fay Yu and the elder. Their speed had surpassed any human limits he could comprehend.

The blade light flickered erratically from Fay Yu’s palm, but confusion marked her face.

With her second attack, she had merely grazed the elder's legs with her blade light before he detonated his own true energy with a deafening crash… and then, like a dramatic actor, he had retreated, fleeing from the balcony.

Was the elder just putting on a show to escape?

Or was there some kind of trickery involved?

“Do you understand the method of mental energy reconnaissance?” Fay Yu stepped closer to Scholar Song, lowering her voice to a whisper only they could hear.

If possible, a secret transmission would have been more appropriate.

Unfortunately, she was in no condition to execute such a technique, barely managing to stand without exhausting herself even further. Now, she couldn’t even activate mental ‘reconnaissance,’ let alone a secret transmission.

Scholar Song nodded slightly, channeling his mental energy to expand outward in a reconnaissance method.

After scanning the surroundings, he found nothing amiss—nothing of note.

However, an unsettling feeling suddenly welled up within him. It was a strong sense of unease that he couldn’t ignore.

Furrowing his brow, Scholar Song alternated between the mental energy techniques of ‘reconnaissance’ and ‘alertness.’

Still, there was no result—his mental energy was too weak, and his range of reconnaissance was limited.

The more he sensed this, the more his unease grew.

“Did you notice anything unusual?” Fay Yu asked softly.

“I can’t detect anything, but…” Scholar Song began, only to be interrupted by a sudden realization.

Changing the way he channeled his mental energy, he employed another mental secret technique.

‘Mark Sensation Method’

This was a mental technique sent to him by the ‘Third Day Senior Brother’ of Master Tongxuan, designed to sense the flying sword that had been stolen from Master Tongxuan.

As soon as he activated the Mark Sensation Method, Scholar Song immediately perceived the target of the mark.

On the third floor of this very building, a figure that appeared to be an ordinary resident was steadily ascending the stairs. This figure was carrying a guitar case on their back—inside was Master Tongxuan’s stolen flying sword!

The figure ascended the stairs steadily… without haste, betraying no signs of danger.

Clearly, they were under the influence of a spell or item that concealed their aura. Without the mark on the flying sword, Scholar Song would never have noticed them.

Was this someone from the Celestial Farmer Sect’s elder's faction?

Or perhaps… a hidden threat waiting behind the scenes?

“Did you find anything?” Fay Yu, seated on the sofa, attempted to recover her depleted true energy.

“Someone is coming,” Scholar Song whispered. “They're getting closer. Can you still fight?”

At the same time, he pulled out his phone and swiftly began typing. Without the signal-blocking interference of the hidden chamber, it was time to call for help—if not now, then when?

He quickly messaged Hermit of North River, briefly describing their current situation and location, urging him to contact Su Clan’s A-Seventeen just in case.

“Because of my injuries, my true energy isn’t recovering quickly,” Fay Yu said with a wry smile.

“Then… should I ask in the group chat how to write a will?” Scholar Song said, turning off his phone with a chuckle.

As he spoke, countless thoughts raced through his mind.

…

…

The man stealthily approaching with the flying sword was the senior brother of the Moon Blade Sect! The very one who had snatched the ‘Formless Divine Sword’ from his pitiful junior disciple.

That unfortunate junior was now left with shattered legs, currently imprisoned by Sima Jiang.

“The Celestial Farmer Sect’s people have engaged with the Su Clan junior. This is the opportunity,” the senior brother of the Moon Blade Sect smirked, a triumphant grin spreading across his face as he closed in on the positions of Scholar Song and Fay Yu.

His orders from the higher-ups of the Moon Blade Sect were singular—once the Celestial Farmer Sect made contact with the Su Clan junior, they were to eliminate her!
