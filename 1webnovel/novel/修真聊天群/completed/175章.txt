**Meteor Sword Clue**

As an outstanding disciple of the ‘Empty Thief Sect’, Young Master Tang had rarely failed since she debuted. This time, she had come to steal the Blood God Diamond to repay a favor owed to the ‘Sunflower Cultivator’.

For the past few days, she had been observing the defensive array of the building. It was quite complex, and she found it hard to break through in a short time.

Just when she was racking her brain over how to break the formation, she arrived today to find that the intricate defensive array had an issue—it had been forcefully breached, leaving a large hole. Although someone skilled had repaired the array afterwards, any repaired formation meant there was an opportunity to exploit!

Opportunities like this are fleeting; they won’t come again!

Young Master Tang quickly made her way to the breach in the defensive array, preparing to calculate its weaknesses and devise a plan to break through.

At that moment, the building’s main door swung open, and a handsome young man stepped into the courtyard.

Tang immediately dropped to the ground, pulling out a magical item to cover herself, rendering her invisible. She cautiously peered through the railing to observe the young man in the courtyard.

In the yard, Venerable White first dragged out a large box of ‘spoils’ and then broke off a branch, skillfully carving several formations before quickly creating a ‘one-time-use flying sword version 004’.

Young Master Tang was dumbfounded—he had already refined a flying sword? Was this some kind of joke? Moreover, he chose to use a mundane branch as material?

Such a feat was something even the elders of the Empty Thief Sect, who were Golden Core Spirit Emperors, could hardly achieve. She couldn’t help but swallow hard.

At this moment, Venerable White moved the large box onto the wooden flying sword.

Then, with a flick of his wrist, he executed a sword technique and exclaimed, “Go!”

The one-time-use flying sword version 004, along with the large box, floated gracefully into the sky and quickly disappeared from sight.

“Hmm.” Venerable White nodded in satisfaction.

Outside, Young Master Tang was already shaken to the core. She had never heard of anyone who could control a flying sword to soar so high into the air in an instant. Striking a target a thousand miles away was already outrageous, but this handsome young man’s flying sword had vanished beyond the horizon—did it fly straight into space?

Was it still possible to carry on with the mission?

No way! She decided to abandon the task. She could always repay the favor to the ‘Sunflower Cultivator’ next time; there was no need to risk her life and fortune for a single job.

With this thought in mind, Young Master Tang prepared to retreat.

“Friend outside, are you from the Empty Thief Sect?” Venerable White suddenly turned and looked in her direction, smiling slightly.

“Discovered? No way! This magical item was obtained by my master from ancient ruins; even Fifth Rank Golden Core Spirit Emperors can’t see through it!” Young Master Tang thought in panic.

Unless this seemingly handsome young man was a Six Rank True Monarch or higher?

Surely, I can’t be this unlucky? Holding onto a glimmer of hope, she began to worm her way slowly across the ground, preparing to sneak away.

“Stop crawling; that magical item of yours can’t hide from my eyes.” Venerable White’s voice drifted over, calm and disinterested.

Young Master Tang felt a pang of despair in her heart. She got up, removed the magical item covering her, and smiled bitterly.

This was the classic case of failing the mission before it even began!

Venerable White smiled and waved her over, “Come in through the front door; the formation is open there.”

Since he had come out of seclusion, he was considering how to find someone from the ‘Empty Thief Sect’.

His life-bound flying sword, the Meteor Sword, had been stolen by someone from the Empty Thief Sect during his retreat. Although he could trace it through the mark left on the sword, encountering someone from the sect would make solving the problem much simpler.

Young Master Tang timidly approached Venerable White and quietly said, “Hello, senior. I was just passing by. Do you believe me?”

“Hehe.” Venerable White chuckled lightly.

When someone from the Empty Thief Sect is lurking right at your doorstep, would you really believe they were just passing by?

Thinking about the Empty Thief Sect reminded him of the amusing things that happened during his retreat. Lost in thought, Venerable White momentarily spaced out.

Young Master Tang felt a surge of dread as she heard the senior’s chuckle. This could end poorly for her, but after a while, why hadn’t this senior made a move?

Taking a chance, she peeked up and saw that Venerable White seemed to be in a daze, his eyes unfocused.

What a perfect opportunity! Should she attempt to escape?

Young Master Tang gritted her teeth but ultimately didn’t dare to flee. Even if the senior was distracted, with his ability to launch a flying sword into the sky without a trace, no matter where she ran, he could easily pursue her.

Who knows… perhaps this senior was just pretending to be oblivious so he could find an excuse to strike her down?

With that thought, she could only stay put, waiting silently.

If Scholar Song were by her side, he would surely urge her: “Miss, you must flee this place quickly, or you’ll be in grave danger!”

Fortunately, Venerable White, tapping his chin in contemplation for a long while, suddenly remembered he had captured a disciple of the Empty Thief Sect. He slowly came back to his senses.

Young Master Tang was fortunate to have narrowly escaped death.

Looking at the timid disciple of the Empty Thief Sect before him, Venerable White asked, “What were you here to steal?”

With a sigh, Young Master Tang replied honestly, “A treasure called the Blood God Diamond.”

“The Blood God Diamond, huh?” Venerable White recalled hearing about it from his fellow cultivators in the group chat over the past couple of days.

It seemed that Scholar Song had intended to exchange this ‘Blood God Diamond’ with the cultivator known as the Seven Lives Talisman.

“If your target is the Blood God Diamond, my advice is to forget about it.” Venerable White said, “That diamond has already been reserved by another cultivator. If you steal it and anger that cultivator, your Empty Thief Sect might face extermination.”

Unintentionally, Venerable White revealed the immense power behind the Seven Lives Talisman’s master.

Extermination? Young Master Tang found it hard to believe. The Empty Thief Sect had survived for so long despite being a nuisance to many; how could they be so easily destroyed?

“Believe it or not, that’s up to you. However, you won’t be able to steal the Blood God Diamond anyway.” Venerable White chuckled.

Young Master Tang’s heart sank; indeed, there was no chance of success.

“Come inside; I have some questions for you about your Empty Thief Sect.” Venerable White gestured and walked into the house.

Young Master Tang obediently followed.

Once seated in the living room on the third floor, Venerable White inquired, “Was there a disciple from your Empty Thief Sect who dug up a treasure about a hundred years ago and obtained a flying sword?”

“Treasure? Flying sword?” Young Master Tang forced a smile and replied, “Could you be a bit more specific, senior?”

After all, the Empty Thief Sect had dug up countless treasures, and flying swords were among the most common findings. Given the conditions of a hundred years ago, digging up a treasure, and obtaining a flying sword, there were at least a dozen cases that fit those criteria within the sect.
