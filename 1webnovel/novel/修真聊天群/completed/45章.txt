**Another Encounter with a Wall Slam**

After leaving the Alchemical Sage's residence, Scholar Song found himself wandering into the intricate alleys of the Lucky District just five minutes later.

He blinked, taking in the scene before him—both familiar and strange.

About ten meters ahead, a group of eleven delinquents had gathered. They sported wild, colorful hair, adorned with rows of earrings, nose rings, and lip rings, their arms covered in various bizarre tattoos.

Among them stood a tall figure, leaning against the wall in a playful wall-slam pose, a wicked grin plastered across his face. Curiously, a cute little yellow duck was tattooed on his arm.

And pressed against the wall by this so-called "yellow duck delinquent" was a short-haired beauty.

Standing at around 1.5 meters tall, she had short hair and an effortlessly charming face, even without makeup. Due to her petite stature, she resembled a high school student more than anything else.

She was both adorable and striking.

At that moment, the short-haired girl leaned against the wall, her expression blank, her eyes filled with indifference.

"Hey, gorgeous, isn’t it lonely out here all by yourself?" one of the delinquents taunted.

"How about joining us for some fun?" another chimed in.

"It’s on the house, plenty of entertainment!" 

“It’ll feel really good, trust us.”

“Don’t worry, the boys will keep you company!”

“There’s a nice little shop nearby, just a short walk away. We promise you'll want to come back for more!”

The air was thick with crude teasing and suggestive remarks.

Not only was the scene familiar, but the lines they were using echoed in his mind! In this day and age, did delinquents have to coordinate their lines before trying to harass innocent girls? It was like the old tales of robbers shouting, "This mountain is mine, this tree is planted by me. If you want to pass, leave your toll behind!"

Scholar Song sighed, rubbing his temples.

As a genuinely good young man, he couldn’t just stand by and watch this unfold, even if he knew that the short-haired beauty wouldn’t thank him afterward. She might even call him nosy.

But he couldn’t just ignore her plight—after all, it would only take a moment of his time.

Thus, it was clear that Scholar Song had already earned himself a reputation as a relentless good Samaritan.

With a clenched fist, he strode forward confidently.

At that moment, the short-haired girl noticed him.

Her once icy demeanor faltered for a moment; she couldn’t maintain her aloof expression any longer. The corners of her mouth twitched—can you believe there are still people so eager to meddle in others' affairs?

"Annoying," she muttered under her breath.

"Hey? What did the pretty lady just say? You want to have some fun with us, don’t you?" The yellow duck delinquent grinned maliciously, still keeping up the wall-slam pose as he reached toward her face.

With a disdainful snort, the short-haired girl suddenly lunged forward, her hands moving like lightning to grab the delinquent’s head, forcefully pulling him closer.

Was she going in for a kiss? What a fiery little thing! The yellow duck delinquent’s heart raced with anticipation as he puckered his thick lips, ready to taste the coolness of her mouth.

And then… there was nothing.

With a loud thud, the delinquent felt a jarring pain shoot through his forehead, as if he had been struck by a hammer. His vision darkened, and he lost consciousness. He vaguely sensed warmth trickling from his nose—was it blood?

The short-haired girl remained as cold as ever. After knocking down the yellow duck delinquent with a headbutt, she casually tossed him aside like trash.

She was a paradox; still as an iceberg when standing still, yet explosively fierce when in motion. Such a headbutt was rarely used in fights, even among men, unless one was truly confident in their own toughness—otherwise, it often resulted in mutual injury.

She shot a challenging glance at Scholar Song, her lips curling into a smirk.

“Ah Huang, no! Ah Huang’s down! Don’t die on me!”

“Damn it! You’ll pay for this!” 

“Boys, show her what true enjoyment feels like!” The remaining ten delinquents roared, their faces twisted with rage as they closed in on the short-haired girl.

With a cold snort, she tightened her fists in front of her, slightly bending her long legs into a horse stance.

Her movements were fluid and graceful, exuding both elegance and strength.

So cool!

To the untrained eye, it was just a simple stance, but those who understood could see the solid foundation of her martial prowess. She was definitely skilled.

Unfortunately, Scholar Song and the rest of the delinquents were all true novices, merely awed by how cool she looked.

“Ha!” The short-haired girl’s fist shot forth like lightning, her body leaning forward as her delicate fist struck the chin of the nearest delinquent.

Though one would think a punch from such a cute girl wouldn’t do much, the delinquent was sent flying, tracing a perfect arc through the air before crashing heavily to the ground.

The remaining delinquents’ pupils constricted in shock, all of them frozen, jaws dropped—there’s no way such an adorable girl could hit that hard!

They stood paralyzed as the short-haired girl didn’t stop. She swiftly pivoted on her left foot, her right leg rising to deliver a powerful kick that knocked another delinquent to the ground, her other foot following up with a stomp.

Using that force, she twisted her waist, her legs wrapping around another delinquent’s neck like a snake, her body twisting and sending him flying through the air…

This was no helpless girl pressed against a wall—she was a human weapon, every part of her capable of unleashing an attack!

And to top it off, she had activated her ‘Demon Mode’!

……

In just over ten seconds, all eleven delinquents lay sprawled on the ground, groaning in pain.

The short-haired girl brushed off the nonexistent dust from her tight-fitting pants and took one last glance at Scholar Song, lifting her chin in a proud manner.

With that, she turned and strutted away like a peacock, head held high.

Scholar Song rubbed his chin thoughtfully and nodded seriously, “So, I really was meddling, huh? No wonder she looked so annoyed.”

He then muttered softly, “But seriously, seeing her getting harassed by delinquents for two days straight—does she have some kind of special talent or constitution for being harassed?”

In the distance, as the proud short-haired girl walked away, she suddenly paused, her lips twitching before she quickened her pace.

Once she was far enough away, Scholar Song crouched down next to the delinquents, poking the yellow duck delinquent with his finger.

The yellow duck delinquent let out a painful groan—good, he was still alive.

“Thank goodness you’re not dead,” Scholar Song sighed in relief, standing up and leaving.

After all, he wasn’t a hopeless do-gooder. Since the delinquents wouldn’t die, he had no motivation to call for help.

Let them lie there and learn their lesson: don’t go harassing beautiful girls without a thought!

Who knows, maybe that girl could unleash devastation in the blink of an eye?

Plus, Scholar Song had no time to waste on these delinquents—he needed to get back to his dorm and wait for Master Tong Xuan's ‘Flying Sword Transmission’ to arrive!

The Flying Sword Transmission! This was a technique he previously thought existed only in dreams. Now, it was about to manifest in reality—what would it be like?

And what about the ‘Fundamentals of Diamond Fist’ and ‘True Self Meditation’ that came with the transmission? Would they be ancient, bound scrolls? Or perhaps old bamboo slips? Or maybe even silk scrolls or animal skin parchments?

Just thinking about it filled him with excitement.

The only trouble was that his dorm mates might have already returned. Would it be awkward if they saw the Flying Sword Transmission? How could he explain it to them?
