**Once a Shy Young Girl's Heart**

Mistress Scallion curled herself into a small ball, allowing the Nine Lantern Maiden to poke her relentlessly without daring to fight back—she was like a sprout under the eaves, forced to bow her head.

But there’s a saying: "Don’t underestimate the young sprout; one day, when she has mastered her skills, she will repay today’s humiliation a hundredfold." Her ultimate goal was to one day pin the Nine Lantern Maiden to the ground and give her a satisfying smack. How infuriating!

So, in Mistress Scallion's mind, she began to fantasize about stepping on the Nine Lantern Maiden, while she herself laughed regally in three distinct tones.

As she imagined this scene, her A-Q mindset successfully triumphed over reality. No matter how hard the Nine Lantern Maiden poked her, she decided not to care.

After a while, the Nine Lantern Maiden grew tired of poking Mistress Scallion and pulled out a little notebook, marking a line through one of the items.

1: Cook a dish and watch him eat it bite by bite. (crossed out)

2: Accompany him on a moderate adventure. (crossed out)

3: Save him once. (crossed out)

4: Read many books together. (newly crossed out)

5: …

The fifth item was originally a string of characters concealed by magic.

After the Nine Lantern Maiden crossed out item four, the characters for item five rearranged themselves.

5: Dance for him in a sea of blooming flowers amidst the green mountains and clear waters.

Dance?

The Nine Lantern Maiden's face turned pale; she had never learned to dance! If she had to dance, would she just perform a set of martial arts moves instead?

And why did it have to be in a sea of flowers in the first place?

Speaking of which… what on earth was she thinking when she wrote this before she became a nun?!

Cooking, reading books—those were acceptable. But accompanying an adventure? A damsel saving a hero? What a hodgepodge of wishes!

After a lot of effort, she finally completed the first four options: cooking (meat soup), going on an adventure (venturing into the jungle to find two Zhuge weapons), a damsel saving a hero, and reading together.

Now, faced with the fifth option, she felt utterly powerless!

Dancing? The current Nine Lantern Maiden truly couldn’t do that.

If only time could reverse, she would go back and stop her pre-nun self, tearing up this little notebook titled "Things Nine Lantern Wants to Do"—yes, this notebook was written by the Nine Lantern Maiden before she shaved her head and became a nun, capturing the purest wishes of a young girl.

These were the most innocent, naïve wishes of a girl. As the saying goes, "A girl’s feelings are always poetic," filled with fantasies about the future, always expecting someone to come and cherish her.

As for why her notes were titled "Things Nine Lantern Wants to Do," it was because Nine Lantern was her worldly name before she became a nun.

Well… upon reflection, it seemed this wish was born from a moment when her younger self saw a field of flowers during a spring outing, inspiring her imagination?

“What kind of dance should I do?” The Nine Lantern Maiden fretted.

Then, she suddenly noticed Mistress Scallion swaying gently on the Enlightenment Stone in the breeze.

Oh… speaking of which, when she first met this scallion spirit, didn’t it perform a beautiful dance that was hard to resist? What kind of dance was it again?

No way, no way, she absolutely could not perform that dance. Otherwise, someone might get hurt.

So, what dance should she do instead?

The Nine Lantern Maiden's pen tapped away on the notebook.

…

…

Meanwhile, Scholar Song had become so engrossed in reading the Buddhist scriptures that he had lost track of time—he loved reading, no matter the genre.

No matter how dull the book was, as long as it was a type he hadn’t read before, he could sit and read it all day.

Time flew by, and without realizing it, Scholar Song’s body had returned to its original form after the inch-sized snake had shrunk.

Perhaps it was a habit developed from spending time in a rental bookstore.

At some point, while sitting among the pile of scriptures, Scholar Song had shifted to a corner, quietly reading in a squatting position.

When the Nine Lantern Maiden saw Scholar Song squatting in the corner, she found it quite amusing.

…

…

Before long, Scholar Song had read over twenty Buddhist scriptures. He stretched his limbs, set down a volume of scriptures, and wore a look of satisfaction on his face.

“Scholar Song,” the Nine Lantern Maiden seized the moment when he put down the book to ask, “Do you have a favorite dance?”

“Dance?” Scholar Song looked at the Nine Lantern Maiden with confusion, unsure why she was asking. But he still thought seriously and replied, “I’m not really sure. I don’t have much of an appreciation for dance. But if it’s beautiful, I think I’d like it. Whenever there are dance performances at events, I enjoy them quite a bit.”

Hearing this response, the Nine Lantern Maiden rubbed her temples in frustration.

Scholar Song’s vague answer was the most troublesome kind.

It was like asking someone what they wanted for breakfast and getting a “whatever” in response.

It sounded like anything would be fine, but for the person making breakfast, it was a headache.

What did “whatever” even mean? Rice cakes? Noodles? Dumplings? Or buns? If it were noodles, should they be boiled or fried? The choices were overwhelming.

With a sigh, the Nine Lantern Maiden forced a smile and said, “Scholar, are you tired of reading? How about we go out for a stroll?”

“Sure!” Scholar Song rubbed his eyes out of habit.

But since he had opened his spiritual eyes, with the blood and qi circulating within them, he rarely experienced eye fatigue.

The Nine Lantern Maiden placed the Enlightenment Stone on the table, sketching a few simple formations around it to prevent Mistress Scallion from escaping.

When she danced later, she definitely didn’t want Mistress Scallion to see.

In fact, Mistress Scallion couldn’t escape from the Enlightenment Stone at all; she had even lost the ability to transform into human form. Right now, she was merely a sentient scallion with a mouth.

…

…

The Nine Lantern Maiden led Scholar Song out of the temple, and the scenery outside was beautiful—green mountains and clear waters, although it lacked a sea of flowers.

But that was fine; for powerful cultivators, creating a sea of flowers was a simple task.

With a gentle flick of her finger, the Nine Lantern Maiden summoned a butterfly spirit from afar. The butterfly spirit danced gracefully around her, seeming quite affectionate.

“Scholar Song, would you like to see a sea of flowers?” the Nine Lantern Maiden suddenly asked.

“A sea of flowers?” Scholar Song didn’t quite understand why the Nine Lantern Maiden brought it up, but he nodded nonetheless.

The Nine Lantern Maiden lightly flicked her finger, infusing the butterfly with spiritual energy.

Receiving a surge of energy, the butterfly began to dance before Scholar Song and the Nine Lantern Maiden on a patch of grass.

This was the Butterfly Dance. Although it was just one butterfly, it flew rapidly, leaving behind trails of afterimages. As the dust from its wings fell, it conjured numerous illusory butterfly doppelgängers.

In an instant, thousands of butterfly illusions danced beautifully before Scholar Song’s eyes, making him feel as if he were in a valley of butterflies.

Such a stunning sight could be captured on a phone without any need for Photoshop; it would make a perfect wallpaper.

Ten breaths later, the illusory butterflies vanished, and the real butterfly returned to the Nine Lantern Maiden's side.

The Nine Lantern Maiden extended her finger, and the butterfly perched on her fingertip.

“Whoo!” She gently blew a breath toward the butterfly, as if a spring breeze had passed.

The next moment, numerous plant shoots sprouted abundantly across the lawn. These were roots and seeds of many flowers, sown by the butterfly, and nurtured with spiritual energy.

In just a few breaths, the original lawn transformed into a beautiful sea of flowers, vibrant and colorful, a dazzling display of blossoms.

“Gorgeous!” Scholar Song exclaimed, enchanted by the sprawling sea of flowers, filled with varieties he had never seen before.

Just as Scholar Song was immersed in the beauty of the floral landscape, the Nine Lantern Maiden took a deep breath.

Then, she stiffly stepped into the sea of flowers.

“??” Scholar Song looked at the stiffly moving Nine Lantern Maiden with confusion.

In the midst of the flowers, her shiny head reflected light from every angle, and she was wearing a gray monk's robe.

Then, he watched as the Nine Lantern Maiden raised her hands, forming bunny ears with her index and middle fingers, swaying them in the sea of flowers.

“????” Scholar Song's confusion deepened.

He felt that since meeting the Nine Lantern Maiden, her erratic, boundless thought process had always seemed just out of reach for him to follow.

What was she trying to do now? Was she imitating a rabbit? But why was she doing that in front of him? Was there some profound meaning behind it?

Or perhaps this was just her hobby?

Should he applaud and cooperate with her?

But to be fair, the bunny-eared Nine Lantern Maiden was surprisingly cute?

Just as Scholar Song pondered, the Nine Lantern Maiden suddenly began to dance wildly in the flower sea, as if she had lost her mind. With her immense power, every wave of her hand sent petals swirling into the air. As she spun around, the flower petals danced around her in a whirlwind.

For a moment, the Nine Lantern Maiden truly resembled a flower fairy—albeit a rather chaotic one.

After dancing for a while, the Nine Lantern Maiden finally seemed to tire out and came to a stop.

At that moment, the once beautiful sea of flowers resembled a disastrous haircut, with patches of flowers missing here and there.

When the Nine Lantern Maiden returned, Scholar Song found himself clapping against his will.

“How was it?” the Nine Lantern Maiden laughed heartily.

“Very… good!” Scholar Song forced out the words with all his might.

“As long as you’re satisfied.” The Nine Lantern Maiden secretly breathed a sigh of relief—she had cast aside all her embarrassment and emptied her mind.

By the end, she herself didn’t even know what she had done.

Fortunately, Scholar Song had said it was “very good.”

Whether he meant it sincerely or not didn’t matter… she received the feedback, and the fifth wish was fulfilled.

“Once you’ve rested, let’s head back.” The Nine Lantern Maiden swayed her way back to the temple.
