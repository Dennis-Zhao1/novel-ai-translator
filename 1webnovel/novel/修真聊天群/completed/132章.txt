**Chapter 1: The Unexpected Encounter**

“I'm Song, this is my ID card!”

Scholar Song furrowed his brows skeptically as he looked at the hard-covered notebook in his hands. This wasn’t some magic treasure; could it really be of any use?

“Found it! This segment: As a professional beast tamer, I will share some personal experiences and some wisdom passed down from my predecessors in the field. Now, let’s assume you encounter a large feline or canine beast; what should you do?” The young disciple, still with a hint of innocence in his face, exclaimed excitedly.

“Brother Zhenghong, you’re amazing! This is exactly what we need!” 

Scholar Song continued reading.

“At this moment, don’t panic; stay calm. First, observe the gaze of the large carnivorous beast—does it have its head lowered, fixated on you, not breaking eye contact? If so, pay attention. I can assure you that this means you’ve made it onto its menu!”

The disciples of the Xian Nong Sect immediately looked up at the giant Pekingese demon dog. Just as Brother Zhenghong had written, the dog was indeed 'eyeing them hungrily,' slowly approaching with deliberate steps.

This was clearly setting everyone up for the main course!

“Quick, keep reading! Does Brother Zhenghong have any tips for dealing with large canine demons?” the others urged.

The youthful disciple continued, “At this time, don’t panic; keep your composure. Remember not to lower your head or bend over, exposing your vital points. Doing so would make the beast see you as easy prey; and do not turn and run! No matter how fast you are, you can’t outrun a beast, and running will only trigger its hunting instincts. Especially with feline beasts, they enjoy toying with their fleeing prey; even if they’re not hungry, they love to play with their food until it’s dead.”

“Instead, you should stand tall, maintain a serious expression, and fill your face with anger. Then, open your arms towards the beast and shout loudly. For example, ‘Come on, you damn mutt, come eat me if you dare!’ or ‘If you don’t eat me, you’re the real dog sh*t!’ Let your voice pack a punch!”

Just as the youthful disciple reached this point, one of the Xian Nong Sect disciples boldly stepped forward.

He spread his arms wide in front of the Pekingese demon dog, his expression serious and his voice filled with rage as he shouted, “Come on, you damn mutt, come eat me if you dare!”

“If you don’t eat me, you’re the real dog sh*t!”

His booming voice was filled with bravado!

“……” Scholar Song couldn’t help but doubt whether this approach was truly effective. Would it provoke the giant Pekingese demon dog instead?

He recalled hearing from seniors in the Ninefold Land group that high-level demon beasts possessed intelligence comparable to that of humans, capable of human speech.

Yet, to his disbelief, this ridiculous tactic actually worked!

The enormous Pekingese demon dog halted mid-air, sitting down and panting its tongue at the disciple from the Xian Nong Sect.

“It worked! It really worked! Quick, turn the page and see what to do next! How can we drive away this beast?” The disciple who had shouted stood tall, his confidence skyrocketing.

The youthful disciple nodded, filled with anticipation, and flipped to the next page.

On the subsequent page, one sentence caught his eye.

“Thus, you can die with a bit more dignity…”

“……”

Are you kidding me?!

The youthful disciple quickly slammed the notebook shut.

Brother Zhenghong, you sly trickster! How could you lead me astray like this?

“Come on, what’s the next step? I’ve got this big demon dog frozen in place! Tell me what I should do next, or it won’t stay like this for long!” The courageous disciple urged, excitement bubbling over.

What to do? What to do?

The youthful disciple felt tears welling up in his eyes, desperate to cry.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

The giant Pekingese demon dog sat in the air, watching the shouting disciple with a glint of amusement in its eyes. Scholar Song was certain he hadn’t misjudged; that dog was indeed making a lively expression.

Seeing its demeanor, Scholar Song couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. At least this Pekingese demon dog held no malicious intent towards them.

After its little display, the dog shook off its fur and began to walk away through the air, casting a meaningful glance back at Scholar Song before leaving.

Once the demon dog departed, the disciples of the Xian Nong Sect collectively exhaled in relief. The disciple who had shouted at the Pekingese dog plopped down onto the ground, utterly exhausted.

“Brother Zhenghong’s method really worked! That big demon dog actually left!” The disciple didn’t realize how close he had come to death and praised the rather ridiculous method recorded by Brother Zhenghong, “I’ll never have to fear large feline or canine beasts again!”

The youthful disciple silently gripped the notebook, contemplating whether he should show that last line to his brother. What if Brother Zhenghong encounters a large beast again and, without a second thought, starts cursing it out, only to end up as its meal?

After resting for a while, the disciples of the Xian Nong Sect recovered their strength.

They gathered in a circle, waiting for their dependable backbone, Brother Zhengneng, to arrive.

Scholar Song sat alone under a tree, lost in thought.

Next, he needed to figure out a way to get back to Jiangnan University Town. He had been stranded in this desolate area and needed to find the nearest road.

Also, it would be best to contact Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan to let her know he was safe.

And then… there was the matter with the Xian Nong Sect.

Scholar Song glanced at the cluster of disciples from the Xian Nong Sect. He owed them a couple of favors.

If they hadn’t engaged the Demon Lord An Zhi, he wouldn’t have even had a chance to escape.

Then, Brother Zhengyan had given him a healing pill.

As these thoughts swirled in his mind, he rubbed his temples.

There was still a lingering grudge between the Xian Nong Sect and Sable Seven of the Su Clan. Although the details of this grudge were murky, it seemed the disciples of the Xian Nong Sect had firmly pinned the blame on Sable Seven.

While he pondered, the youthful disciple approached Scholar Song, striving to adopt a fierce demeanor: “Are you from the Su Clan?”

His question immediately caught the attention of many companions, who were now curious about Scholar Song’s identity.

“I’m not… you must have heard the uncle’s previous shout, right? I’m just an innocent victim who got caught in a misunderstanding with that Demon Lord An Zhi,” Scholar Song replied earnestly.

“Do you have any proof?” the youthful disciple pressed.

“Proof?” Scholar Song didn’t expect that one day he would have to prove his own identity.

After a moment’s thought, he pulled out his wallet: “If you really need it… how about this?”

He took out his ID card.

Name: Scholar Song. Gender: Male.

Then, his date of birth followed.

The Xian Nong Sect’s third-grade cultivator, Brother Zhengyan, casually strolled over and took a look at Scholar Song’s ID card.

“Hmm, he’s a Song. Definitely not from the Su Clan,” Brother Zhengyan said seriously before handing the ID card back to Scholar Song.

The disciples of the Xian Nong Sect lowered their heads, feeling a mix of relief and disappointment.

“Maybe he just took his mother’s surname?” the youthful disciple persisted, unwilling to let it go. “It’s possible his father’s surname is Su!”

Scholar Song sighed, “Look, don’t go changing someone else’s lineage so casually.”

“Sorry, my disciples have been a bit impatient due to the mission’s mishap,” Brother Zhengyan reprimanded the youthful disciple, sending him back to his companions.

Then, Brother Zhengyan sat beside Scholar Song.

“Six days ago, Sable Seven of the Su Clan and a strange cultivator came to our Xian Nong Sect as guests.” He began telling his story…

**Note from the Author:**

Hey everyone! I’m a complete newbie, Saint Knight of the Legend, and I’ve just released a brand new book called “Cultivator Chat Group.”

Now, “Cultivator Chat Group” has over 300,000 words and is finally ready to be published.

Before it goes live, I wanted to share a few words of gratitude.

Thanks for all your support so far, and for the generous rewards. I hope you’ll continue to stick with me for the long haul!

Once it’s published, I’ll be asking for subscriptions since, as a newcomer, I rely on subscriptions and rewards to get by. Your subscription is my biggest motivation! And let’s be honest, it’s also a reflection of the author’s reputation. A low subscription count is embarrassing, while a good one brings pride, doesn’t it?

Once it’s up, I’ll do my best to update frequently, and if I can occasionally release multiple chapters, that’d be even better.

However, this book is one that inherently takes time to write. Rushing through it would diminish its quality, so I can only aim for more updates while maintaining the standard.

Alright, that’s all from me. Time to get back to writing!

I’ll be responsible for crafting a great story, and I leave the subscriptions, rewards, and monthly votes to you all!

Thank you!

Saint Knight of the Legend.
