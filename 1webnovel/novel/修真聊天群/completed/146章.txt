**Accompany Me Shopping!**

As they strolled along, Scholar Song pulled out his phone and checked the 'Ninefold Land No. 1 Group' chat. No messages from any seniors about sending him anything? 

Could it be Fay Yu sending him something again?

He recalled that three days ago, when she bumped into him in the group, she suddenly asked if he wanted some 'Spirit Vein Green Tea.' Apparently, Lingdie Island had just harvested a new batch, and she had even picked a small portion herself. She excitedly mentioned that once the tea was prepared, she wanted to send a little to Scholar Song.

At that time, he happily agreed, thinking that just a 'bit of tea' was a small gift he could easily accept. 

But now, hearing about a box as tall as a person, Scholar Song couldn't shake off a sense of worry—Fay Yu was known for her extravagant nature, a fact even acknowledged by the seniors in the group. If her idea of 'a bit of tea' was indeed a box that size, he would owe her a huge favor.

Speaking of Fay Yu, she had been tirelessly working on the 'Five Elements Spirit Contraction Altar' formation lately.

She was quite talented in cultivation, having reached the Third Grade Postnatal realm at such a young age, but it seemed all her talent points had been invested in cultivation alone. She struggled with alchemy, formations, and talisman crafting.

For the past half month, she had been studying the 'Five Elements Spirit Contraction Altar' and had tried it four times, each attempt ending in failure. Recently, whenever Scholar Song encountered her in the group, she often seemed frustrated over this matter.

Seeing her fail repeatedly was part of the reason Scholar Song hesitated to contract the Phantom Spirit he held in hand.

He only had two chances; if he failed, he'd have to gather the materials for the 'Five Elements Spirit Contraction Altar' all over again. So many materials—it was hard to say how long that would take!

…

Lost in thought, Scholar Song had already arrived at the boys' dormitory.

Sima Jiang had been waiting for quite a while—he had called Scholar Song while standing at the entrance to the dorm. Beside him stood four burly men in black suits, guarding a large box that was roughly six feet long.

"Little Jiang, sorry to keep you waiting!" Scholar Song said, feeling a bit embarrassed.

"No problem! We just got here," Sima Jiang replied with a hearty laugh. "Come, sign here."

Scholar Song nodded, scribbling his name before opening the door to his dorm.

"Do you want us to help you carry it inside?" Sima Jiang offered, noticing the size of the box. It would be tough for one person to manage it alone.

But before he could finish, Scholar Song bent down and effortlessly lifted one end of the box, hoisting it up like it was a classroom desk, with no visible struggle at all.

"Huh? No problem, it’s not heavy. I can manage it by myself," Scholar Song replied with a grin.

Sima Jiang's jaw dropped as he bid farewell to Scholar Song, leading his four subordinates toward the elevator.

"Is that box really that light?" Sima Jiang muttered to himself.

"While it’s not super heavy… its length is something else. If it were upright, any one of us could carry it, but lifting it horizontally like that? That's impressive," one of the men in black suits commented thoughtfully.

Moreover, the student didn’t look particularly muscular; who would have guessed he had such strength!

…

Scholar Song inwardly sighed, realizing he had let his strength slip out without trying to hide it.

He carried the box into his room.

Tearing open the outer cardboard packaging revealed a wooden box that looked somewhat like a coffin!

A coffin? Who sent him a coffin?!

Was it someone he had offended recently?

In an instant, his mind raced back to the 'Young Master Hai Elder' from the Moon Blade Sect!

That guy had said when he left, "This Blood God Diamond will be temporarily entrusted to you. In due time, I will come to collect it."

Could it be that this guy sent him a coffin?

Was he really planning to visit so soon? 

“Dou Dou! Are you there?” Scholar Song called out.

“Woof, what’s up?” came the voice of the Pekingese from the computer in the bedroom. It was engrossed in the game that Scholar Song had been playing, having become quite addicted to it, racking up countless unfortunate teammates.

“Come here for a moment! I’m about to open a box, but it feels off. I might have offended someone recently, and they could be sending me a trap in this delivery as revenge,” Scholar Song said cautiously.

Dou Dou turned its head and sniffed the air. Then it lazily replied, “Go ahead. With me around, at least you won’t kick the bucket.”

With that reassurance, Scholar Song felt a bit more at ease.

He carefully grasped the lid of the wooden box and gently lifted it open.

It wasn’t stuck; the lid came off easily.

No arrows or other traps sprang out, and he let out a silent sigh of relief as he leaned in to take a peek inside…

Inside, he found a beautiful young woman sleeping soundly. She was petite with shoulder-length hair, her features delicate like a porcelain doll.

“Sable Sixteen?!”

Scholar Song exclaimed.

The box was over six feet long, and after accounting for the outer cardboard, the wooden box, and a thick layer of foam inside, it was just enough to fit the roughly five-foot Sable Sixteen comfortably.

Hearing Scholar Song's voice, Sable Sixteen groggily opened her eyes.

Beside the computer, Dou Dou let out a disdainful huff, having already caught wind of Sable Sixteen's scent.

Sable Sixteen blinked and climbed out of the box. “Oh, hello, Scholar Song.”

Once she stood up, it became clear that besides her, there was a small jar and a delicate box inside the container.

“Didn’t you go back to the Su Clan with Elder Aqi for treatment? How did you escape?” Scholar Song asked anxiously.

According to her own words, if her injuries weren’t treated soon, she might only have fifteen days left to live! Why wouldn’t she stay in the Su Clan and get proper care instead of running away?

What would happen if her injuries flared up along the way?

“Hehe, I’m clever, right? I thought of using a delivery service to send myself out! But don’t worry, this time I brought protective talismans with me, so I’m not afraid of being attacked. I also brought some pills to suppress my injuries,” Sable Sixteen explained, her eyes sparkling with mischief as she noticed Scholar Song's worried expression.

Then she reached out her small hand and patted Scholar Song to comfort him. “Don’t worry! With the talismans here, Elder Aqi can quickly pinpoint my location. She’ll be here to pick me up by tonight at the latest! I’m only out for a little while.”

Scholar Song found it both amusing and exasperating. He turned to glance at Dou Dou, who was still focused on its game, and then back at Sable Sixteen.

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain and Elder Aqi, you two have it tough!

“Is there a reason you escaped this time?” Scholar Song sighed, knowing he could only wait for Elder Aqi to return and pick her up.

“Yeah, there is,” Sable Sixteen nodded, handing him the small jar. “Here’s a hundred 'Fasting Pills.' As I promised, I’m delivering them to you!”

“Is that really the reason? Even if you want to keep your promise and repay me a hundredfold with Fasting Pills, you didn’t need to escape just to deliver them,” Scholar Song chuckled incredulously.

Sable Sixteen didn’t answer. Her eyes dropped slightly, and she fell silent for a moment.

Then she handed him the delicate box. “And this is for you—Spirit Vein Green Tea! Consider it a gift! Now that you’re a cultivator, if any fellow cultivators come to visit, you should at least have some Spirit Vein Green Tea to treat your guests. Plus, ordinary people can drink a little as well; it’s good for health. You can let your family have some, but in moderation.”

Scholar Song stared at the box of Spirit Vein Green Tea in Sable Sixteen’s hands—her sudden gift of it couldn’t possibly be related to Fay Yu mentioning it in the group, could it?

Sable Sixteen’s dark, glimmering eyes fixed on Scholar Song, still holding out the box.

“Thank you! I won’t refuse your kindness,” Scholar Song said, accepting the Spirit Vein Green Tea from her.

“And… since we have some time before Elder Aqi gets here, will you accompany me on a little outing?” Sable Sixteen asked, her smile brightening the room.

“Alright, where do you want to go?” Scholar Song replied. It was Tuesday afternoon, and they had no classes.

Plus, he had just wrapped up his driving lessons. He had successfully passed the second driving test with Tuba and was now waiting for his instructor to notify him for a few laps on the road before the actual driving test.

So he had the perfect opportunity to relax.

“There are so many places I want to go! First, a clothing store, then the food street in the Luoxin district, and I’d love to catch a movie too. A large arcade sounds fun, too! We can just see where the day takes us—anything fun, delicious, or interesting, I want to try!” Sable Sixteen beamed.

After a moment, she added, “But there’s one big problem. I didn’t bring any money—none at all! So I can’t pay you back for that taxi fare from last time!”

“Alright, whether it’s fifty or five thousand, a debt is a debt. I’ll cover it,” Scholar Song chuckled.

“Sounds good!” Sable Sixteen stretched lazily. “Let’s head out!”

“Dou Dou, want to join us?” Scholar Song called out to the Pekingese still glued to the computer.

Thinking of the Luoxin district, he figured he could buy something for Dou Dou to snack on.

Dou Dou turned its head, looking at Scholar Song with a distinctly unimpressed expression. After a moment, it replied, “I’m having a blast! I don’t want to go out and play. Just remember to bring me some beef-flavored dog food when you get back! I’ve been dying to know what dog food tastes like. That big fool Huangshan never buys me any—what kind of dog doesn’t get to eat dog food?”

“Fine,” Scholar Song replied with some difficulty.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Sable Sixteen was in high spirits as she held Scholar Song's hand and began exploring the women's clothing department.

“How about this one?” She twirled around in an adorable floral dress in front of Scholar Song.

The dress suited Sable Sixteen perfectly, and her fashion sense was impressive.

“Absolutely stunning!” Scholar Song gave her a thumbs-up.

“Then I’ll buy it! Let’s keep going!” Sable Sixteen laughed and continued to weave through the sea of dresses.

Nearby, a sales assistant couldn’t help but comment, “Hey, young man, your sister is so cute, and her taste in clothes is excellent! That outfit looks fantastic on her!”

“Ha ha, thank you, thank you!” Scholar Song chuckled as he completed the purchase.

Amid the clothing racks, Sable Sixteen looked up at her reflection in the mirror, wondering, Am I really that small?
