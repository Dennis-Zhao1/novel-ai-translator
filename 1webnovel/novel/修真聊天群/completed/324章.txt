**Can a Virgin Have Children?**

"Let's find a nearby island to rest for a bit," said Venerable White. He placed Dou Dou and the little monk on the back of the whale, then tossed the captured Whale Eight to the back of the whale as well. With a gentle pat, he set the whale in motion once more.

The whale, which had just settled at the bottom of the sea to contemplate its life, was back on the move just minutes later…

The great whale rode the waves, searching for a place to land.

Scholar Song noticed that Dou Dou and the little monk were completely still. "Hey, Venerable White, what's up with Dou Dou and the little monk?"

Both Dou Dou and the little monk had their eyes wide open but were frozen in place. There was no way they could be this well-behaved.

Upon hearing Scholar Song’s voice, Dou Dou immediately turned its hopeful gaze toward him, its big, adorable eyes seeming to speak volumes.

The little monk wasn’t any different. His dark, shiny eyes were fixed on Scholar Song, and he kept blinking adorably, filled with a pleading look—especially worried that Scholar Song might unleash a storm of punishment on him at this moment when he had no strength to resist.

"It’s fine. These two little ones have been hit with a light hypnosis spell. Although they're conscious, their bodies are still unable to move. They’ll be fine in a couple of days," Venerable White casually remarked—given his skills, it wouldn’t be hard to help Dou Dou and the little monk recover immediately.

However, these two little ones needed to learn a lesson.

"Oh," Scholar Song nodded, gently stroking Dou Dou's fur. "Just rest well. You'll be back to your lively selves in two days."

Dou Dou rolled its eyes in frustration. It wanted Scholar Song to plead with Venerable White to let them move sooner, but unfortunately, Scholar Song wasn’t the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, so he couldn't connect with it through just a glance.

Then, Scholar Song turned to the little monk and asked, "Little Guo Guo, do you want to say something? Is your eye bothering you? You keep blinking."

Venerable White looked over at Little Guo Guo and then translated, "What he really means is that he hopes you don't think about him running away from home and don’t punish him too harshly? That’s probably it?"

"You’re spot on, Venerable White," Little Guo Guo’s nose was nearly in tears.

Scholar Song raised an eyebrow. "I almost forgot! Little Guo Guo, you’ve got some nerve running away from home all by yourself!"

Little Guo Guo blinked fervently, lacking any other means of communication.

Scholar Song picked up the little monk and turned him upside down, giving his little bottom a couple of firm smacks.

*Smack! Smack!*

With a stern expression, he wanted to scold the little monk, but after a moment's thought, he realized he didn’t know what to say. After all, he was just a college student with no experience in raising children.

In the end, he could only say seriously, "Remember, don't let this happen again. It would worry your family, understand?"

The little monk sniffled, blinking rapidly to show he understood.

With a sigh, Scholar Song set him back down next to Dou Dou. This little guy was just too cute; he couldn’t bring himself to be too harsh.

"There won’t be a next time. Remember that," Scholar Song lightly tapped the little monk on the head.

Little Guo Guo secretly sighed in relief—escaping a severe beating was a blessing.

Watching Scholar Song’s indulgent demeanor towards the little monk, Venerable White smiled and said, "Scholar Song, if you ever have children in the future, I can see you being the type to spoil them rotten."

The words "father" and "children" triggered some memories in Scholar Song.

A blurry figure of "the mother of his children."

A son named Song Ren.

A daughter named Song Miao.

His son married due to an unexpected pregnancy.

His adorable daughter eventually got married.

Scholar Song rubbed his temples vigorously—those memories were so vivid and real!

Seeing Scholar Song’s conflicted expression, Venerable White casually asked, "What’s bothering you?"

"Venerable White, do you think... ah, forget it! Do you think I’ve had children with someone else?" Scholar Song cautiously inquired.

Venerable White: "..."

Venerable White felt that Scholar Song was acting quite strange.

"Venerable White, I’m not joking," Scholar Song insisted. "It’s just that some of my memories from the mysterious island seem to linger. Perhaps it’s because my abilities are still weak, like the little medicinal boy of the Alchemical Sage, and my memory seal isn't complete."

"I vaguely remember that I got married?"

"I also remember having a son and a daughter."

"In the end, I watched my son get married and my daughter marry off, and I was in bed crying my eyes out."

"Everything feels so real; it doesn’t seem like a mere illusion. It’s as if these events actually happened to me on the mysterious island!"

Scholar Song looked troubled.

Moreover, many changes had occurred in him—like when he boarded the plane, he had just opened his ear orifice. But now, he had progressed even further! Not only that, he sensed even more changes within himself, but he hadn’t noticed them yet.

"Don't worry. You probably just experienced a very realistic illusion," Venerable White said after some thought. "If you’re really concerned about whether you actually went through that, you can ask the Alchemical Sage to check your body when you meet him."

"Is the Alchemical Sage really that powerful? Can he even tell if a man has had children with a woman?" Scholar Song was astonished, as after all, it was the woman who bore the children!

Venerable White replied, "Well, we can confirm that through another method—like whether a virgin can have children."

Scholar Song: "..."

He felt inexplicably mocked by Venerable White despite knowing it was not the latter's intention.

"Moo~~ Moo~~" At that moment, the great whale let out a long call.

Because an island appeared ahead of them!

"Let’s go ashore first. We need to stabilize this young lady’s injuries," Venerable White said.

Scholar Song nodded. The girl in the black dress was seriously injured, and it was better to treat her sooner rather than later. Delaying could lead to dire consequences…

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Time passed second by second.

Chu Chu felt as if she were trapped in a terrifying nightmare; darkness surrounded her. She knew it was a dream and tried desperately to wake up, but she couldn’t.

"Damn it! Let me wake up! Let me wake up!" Chu Chu shouted in anger.

She was a young genius disciple from the Chu family.

Currently, the Chu family was about to face off against the Void Sword Sect at the断仙台 (Duan Xian Stage).

The battle at the断仙台 would be a generational duel.

Chu Chu was the hope of the younger generation representing the Chu family. As long as she fought, they could secure a victory against the Void Sword Sect. In fact, if she continued to fight, she could single-handedly defeat all of the Void Sword Sect's young talents.

Because among the young talents of the Void Sword Sect, there wasn’t even a second-tier cultivator! That's why they were willing to spend a fortune to prevent her from participating in the断仙台, to avoid any mishaps.

Let me wake up! I must catch the断仙台 match no matter what… I must catch it!

It seemed as if heaven finally heard Chu Chu's heartfelt plea.

She strained to open her eyes.

Then, she saw a clean-faced young man sitting beside her.

Next to the young man was a curious little monk and a very cute little Pekingese—Venerable White had finally shown mercy and allowed the little monk and Dou Dou to regain some mobility. However, they were still very weak and could only move like ordinary people.

"Senior Brother Shu Hang, the young lady is finally awake," the little monk exclaimed joyfully, as saving a life was more valuable than building countless pagodas.

Scholar Song nodded and said to Dou Dou, "Dou Dou, go see if Venerable White has finished his meditation. If he has, ask him to come back and check on this friend’s injuries."

After reaching the island… Venerable White had adjusted the black-dressed girl’s bones, removed the true energy of Whale Eight from her body, and treated her severe internal injuries. However, this could only stabilize her condition for now; complete healing would have to wait until they met the Alchemical Sage.

After doing all this, Venerable White seemed to suddenly take an interest in meditating, so he ran off to enter a small retreat for four hours.

Venerable White, the meditation enthusiast.

Scholar Song had already grown accustomed to Venerable White’s habit of meditating at a moment's notice.

"Woof," Dou Dou barked, wobbling as it went to find Venerable White’s meditation spot.

…

…

"What happened to me?" Chu Chu asked weakly.

As she spoke, she carefully recalled what had happened before she lost consciousness—she seemed to have been pursued by two assassins in the sea. Then, this young man and a giant whale descended from the sky?

After that, she had fainted from the impact of the huge creature.

Chu Chu looked gratefully at Scholar Song. "Did you save me?"

"It was Venerable White who saved you," Scholar Song replied with a smile. "Your injuries are serious, so rest well. Once my other senior arrives, I’ll have him take another look at your injuries."

Injuries? Right, she had almost been killed by that giant brute!

Chu Chu wanted to lift her head to see her injuries, but as she moved, her body ached as if it were being torn apart.

"Don’t move around! It’ll rip open your wounds!" Scholar Song quickly held her down.

"How long will it take for my injuries to heal?" Chu Chu asked anxiously. The battle at the断仙台 was just a few days away!

"I’m not sure, but my other senior has excellent medical skills; with your injuries, I think it should take a few months to recover," Scholar Song guessed.

"Few months?" Chu Chu's eyes widened.

If it took a few months, the断仙台 would be over! If they lost to the Void Sword Sect, she would be the greatest sinner of the Chu family!

Chu Chu grew anxious, and then her vision darkened as she fainted again.

"Hey, how did she faint again?" Scholar Song mumbled, "Is she so happy to know it’ll take a few months to recover that she fainted?"

"Senior Brother Shu Hang," the little monk said seriously at this moment, "I don’t think the young lady's expression before she fainted was one of happiness!"
