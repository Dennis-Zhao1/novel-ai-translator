**Scholar Song's Unexpected Delivery**

The next day, July 11th, the sky was surprisingly overcast.

Even with the 'Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl' blessing him, Scholar Song had no fear of the sweltering heat. However, on a sweltering summer day, simply avoiding the brilliant smile of the sun made his mood significantly better.

Early that morning, Zhao Yaya drove over to take Father Song to the hospital for a check-up...

Father Song initially insisted he was in perfect health and didn't want to go—this was a strange quirk of his generation, as they often preferred to endure illness at home rather than visit a hospital. Even a common cold would see him stubbornly toughing it out, harboring an innate aversion to the very idea of "going to the hospital."

However, when Mother Song gave him a stern look, Father Song obediently followed Zhao Yaya to the hospital.

The unique relationship between Father Song and Mother Song was steeped in history.

Rumor has it that they were classmates back in their student days... In those early years, Father Song wasn't the refined gentleman he appeared to be now.

Back then, he had a physique that could rival Old Lu—broad shoulders and a hefty build, with a face full of blubber.

Moreover, Father Song was the star athlete of the school's free-fighting club... Meanwhile, Mother Song was a small-time beauty with some fame around the school.

Their meeting unfolded like this—one of the club members was a close friend of Father Song. This friend had a crush on Mother Song but lacked the opportunity to approach her.

After racking his brain for days, he devised a clever plan and sought out Father Song, asking him to help stage a scene—an "hero saving the beauty" act.

Given Father Song's imposing stature, he could easily scare anyone without needing makeup. With just a flex of his muscles and a sinister grin, he could naturally embody the role of a villain.

Thus, the friend asked Father Song to play the bad guy to frighten Mother Song. At the critical moment, he would swoop in to save her and win her heart!

Back then, Father Song's personality bore some resemblance to Scholar Song today—he was always willing to help out in small ways.

So, they set the script.

They chose a small path that Mother Song would take home from school and waited for her to pass by.

The friend hid in a corner, ready to make his heroic entrance at a moment's notice.

Father Song puffed up his muscles and prepared to block Mother Song's path.

According to the plan, he would confront her, flex his muscles, and say, "Hey, why don’t you come with me to a great place? We can have some fun together."

Next, according to the script, Mother Song was supposed to scream and cry, prompting the friend to rush in, scare away Father Song, and steal the beauty's heart.

However, when Mother Song appeared, she showed absolutely no fear. Calmly, she stood her ground, taking a thorough look at Father Song from head to toe, making him feel a bit uneasy.

Then, she nodded and calmly said, "Sure, let’s go."

And just like that, they walked away together... leaving the friend dumbfounded on the ground, unable to utter a word.

Not long after, Mother Song became Father Song's girlfriend, while the friend had long since lost count of how many times he cried in the bathroom.

Then, over the course of their student life, Father Song underwent a dramatic transformation. He went from a burly, intimidating brute to a bespectacled, refined, and elegantly mannered gentleman, with his academic performance skyrocketing.

The trials he endured for such a massive change were not something he could easily explain to others.

...

After waking up, Scholar Song was having breakfast when Mother Song hurried over and asked, "Scholar, what happened to that injured person you brought back?"

She had just checked the guest room and found that the injured person from yesterday had vanished, along with her bed sheets.

Scholar Song swallowed his bite of fried egg and replied, "I was just about to tell you, that injured person woke up in the middle of the night. He came to find me, and after chatting for a bit, he left."

"He left in the middle of the night wrapped in a blanket? You didn’t try to keep him here?" Mother Song frowned.

"At that moment, he came to find me while I was still half-asleep. After we talked, he just wrapped himself in the blanket and left... I didn’t even have time to give him some clothes. It’s fine, he’ll figure out the clothes situation on his own. We’re not that familiar anyway... If he wants to leave, I wouldn’t stop him," Scholar Song casually replied.

He really hadn’t expected to provide clothing for Yunwu Daoist, who had jumped out the window wrapped in a blanket.

"You really are something else. Not even giving him a set of clothes? That would make people laugh at you," Mother Song sighed, then asked, "And what about your friend? Is he still not awake?"

She noticed that Venerable White still hadn’t come down for breakfast...

"Haha, he loves to sleep in. But he was driving the whole way yesterday, so he must be pretty tired. Let him sleep a bit longer, it’s no big deal," Scholar Song chuckled—he had gotten himself into a bit of a mess. Venerable White was supposed to be in seclusion for more than two days, and it had only been twenty hours so far, with plenty of time before he finished.

He needed to come up with a plan to avoid exposing any flaws.

"Well, let him sleep a bit more. Make sure to wake him up for lunch, or else sleeping too much isn’t good for his health," Mother Song said.

"Got it, I’ll definitely wake him up by noon," Scholar Song promised, wondering if he could forcibly wake Venerable White from his seclusion.

What if forcing him awake led to unexpected consequences?

For example, would Venerable White wake up with a "grumpy mood" as if he hadn't had enough time in seclusion? Would he end up releasing some kind of "post-seclusion anger" that could blow up the house?

Speaking of which... today was the day the little monk finished his treatment for hemorrhoids!

Brother Zhou Li should be bringing "Bean" and the little monk back soon.

Maybe he could ask Brother Zhou Li for a way to use some technique to transform into Venerable White’s appearance, to act as a stand-in at lunch and avoid raising Mother Song’s suspicions.

If that worked, it would solve the problem of Venerable White's seclusion!

With that thought, Scholar Song felt a sense of relief wash over him.

After finishing his breakfast, around seven-thirty, he said, "Mom, I’m going to work out for a bit. I might be gone for a while, so call me if you need anything."

At home, there was really no place for him to practice.

So, he headed out to find a quiet spot nearby to practice the "Fundamentals of Vajra Boxing."

"Okay, just don’t go too far," Mother Song replied casually.

Scholar Song patted the Dao Stone in his pocket, then went to the living room to wrap up the 'Blade of the Dominant Smash' in a cloth to take along.

He also needed to diligently practice the 'Flame Blade' taught by Chixiaozi—after seeing Chixiaozi's figure in Mistress Scallion's memories, Scholar Song increasingly felt that this technique might hold deeper secrets.

After leaving the house, he sprinted toward Niuding Mountain, a great place for cultivation.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In a forest on Niuding Mountain.

After completing a round of the "Fundamentals of Vajra Boxing," Scholar Song closed his eyes to carefully sense the changes within his body—just yesterday, he had only just opened the 'Nasal Aperture.'

However, today, after finishing a round of boxing, he discovered that his fourth aperture, the 'Ear Aperture,' was already filled with vital energy, feeling slightly swollen!

If things continued like this, within seven days, the 'Ear Aperture' would be filled to capacity and burst open!

"Could it be due to the body of Mistress Scallion I consumed yesterday?" Scholar Song pondered. He realized that although the body of Mistress Scallion had been extracted by Yunwu Daoist using "Empty and Mysterious Hands" and transformed into scallion essence crystals, part of it had already been digested by him, becoming a supplement for his own vital energy.

Even though Mistress Scallion's combat abilities had diminished, her three hundred years of cultivation were no joke. Even a small portion of that was enough to fill one of Scholar Song's apertures.

"After the 'Ear Aperture' comes the 'Mouth Aperture.' After the 'Mouth Aperture,' it's the realm of the Dragon Gate! When the fish leaps over the dragon gate, the intangible vital energy will transform into true qi!" Scholar Song took a deep breath.

True qi was different from vital energy; true qi could be projected outward, just like in the movies. After reaching a high level of cultivation, swinging a sword would unleash a wave of sword energy. So cool!

While he was lost in thought, Scholar Song glanced at the 'Blade of the Dominant Smash' in his hand.

It was a sword... no, it was a blade.

Even the 'Flame Blade' taught in his dreams was a blade technique. Was he destined to be a swordsman in this life, rather than a swordsman?

"Nonsense! Once I reach the second-tier true master realm, I’ll practice several sword techniques. A white-clad long sword, singing and howling!" Scholar Song gritted his teeth.

First, he would diligently practice the "Fundamentals of Vajra Boxing," "Gentleman’s Journey," and "Immovable Vajra Body," followed by "True Self Meditation Scripture."

Then, he’d work on the 'Flame Blade' and the techniques of the three kinds of spiritual energy—'Mental Detective Technique,' 'Alertness,' and 'Mental Pressure.'

Lastly, he would practice the Daoist techniques like 'Palm Thunder' and 'Turtle Breathing Technique.'

Finally, Scholar Song ignited a small flame to practice 'Fire Control Technique.'

Unknowingly, he had learned many skills. The coolest was 'Palm Thunder,' and 'Fire Control Technique' was also impressive, though he hadn’t mastered it yet.

By the time he finished his training, three hours had already passed.

At that moment, Scholar Song's phone rang.

He pulled it out to check, and it was a call from Jiang Shujie at Shouhou Express.

Whose delivery could it be? Could it be the 'Spirit Vein Green Tea' that Fay Yu sent over? That was fast!

Scholar Song answered the call, "Hello, Jiang?"

"Haha, Scholar, it’s me. I’m downstairs at your place with a big delivery for you," Sima Jiang's cheerful voice came through the phone.

"A big delivery?" Scholar Song instinctively asked.

"It’s massive, a square box, about 1.6 cubic meters in size," Jiang replied.

Scholar Song was taken aback.

That big?

If it was only 'Spirit Vein Green Tea,' did Fay Yu plan to send him enough tea to last a lifetime?
