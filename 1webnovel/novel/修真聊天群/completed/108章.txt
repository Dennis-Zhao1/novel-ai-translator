**Chapter 1: Trust Between People**

“Uncle, what about trust between people?”

Scholar Song took a step back, lifting his gaze to the hospital room number—570!

His mind raced back to the puzzling patient Dr. Li had introduced, a patient whose body bore no visible wounds, yet internal organs and tissues exhibited signs of carbonization. That unique patient was none other than the one in room 570.

An unbelievable and bizarre injury, coupled with the connection to Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan.

It could only be her—the girl who had fled home after facing a tribulation in H City. Her strange “tender on the outside but charred on the inside” injuries must have been caused by the thunder tribulation on June 1st.

Forgive Scholar Song for not realizing this sooner—he had never considered that Sable Sixteen could be a girl!

While listening to the seniors chat in their group, he had always thought Sable Sixteen was a boy.

With a name like Sable Sixteen and a temperament as combative as that of Su Clan’s A Seven, how could he have imagined it belonged to a little girl?

But now wasn’t the time to dwell on such thoughts.

What was important was that this self-proclaimed member of the Immortal Family seemed intent on harming Sable Sixteen.

What should he do now?

The uncle's strength was clearly greater than his own; even using talismans might not make him a match.

Should he notify the senior, A Seven, in their group?

No, long-distance solutions couldn’t resolve immediate dangers.

……

Inside the hospital room…

“Hmph, no need to complicate things!” The uncle gritted his teeth, his right hand reaching toward the wall. With a swift motion, his fingers pierced into the wall, creating five deep indentations.

The architecture of Jiangnan University’s affiliated hospital was undoubtedly commendable, with a high defensive value. Yet, the uncle's casual swipe left marks in the wall as if it were tofu.

He might be a bit of a clown, but his strength was terrifying!

“As long as I capture you, a little descendant of the Su Clan, I can force Sable A Seven to meet with us. Then, we’ll settle all scores once and for all with the Immortal Farming Sect.” The uncle loomed over the girl in the hospital bed, his claws raised again, remnants of wall plaster still stuck to his fingertips… not very sanitary, huh?

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you. I just need to break your limbs, and that bastard Sable A Seven will come looking for us himself!” The uncle growled, raising his hand, ready to deliver a brutal blow.

With just one strike, Sable Sixteen would receive an unwelcome certificate of disability.

Bang!

Just then, the door to room 570 swung open once more!

The uncle instinctively retracted his hand, his vicious expression quickly fading away—cultivators generally tried to avoid revealing their powers in front of ordinary people. Even the uncle, in that moment, unconsciously suppressed his murderous intent.

Then, he saw a young man with delicate features rushing into the room.

The young man looked up at the uncle, panting heavily, yet his face bore a gentle smile. “Found you, Uncle!”

The uncle’s hand froze, and his expression turned rigid—why was this scammer here again? Hadn’t he learned his lesson after taking a punch from him yesterday? How dare he show up again?

Meanwhile, the girl in the hospital bed quietly turned over, using the blanket to cover herself.

“Don’t act yet, let me finish speaking! Otherwise, don’t blame me for turning hostile!” The young man saw the uncle’s distressed face and sighed. He pulled out a wad of cash from his pocket—one hundred and fifty yuan—“Uncle, it’s not that I’m criticizing you! You seriously lack the most basic trust between people! Come on, take the money. If you’re not sure, check if it’s real or not! Just take it, and don’t worry about me scamming you, alright?”

“Then, you’re going to sit down and listen to me! Look at me, I have a decent appearance and an honest face—where do I look like a scammer? Besides, I’ve explained to you so many times, it was your money that you lost! Why don’t you trust me? Just think about how it went down. Even if you forgot whether you dropped the money, you should remember—when I called out to you, weren’t you reaching for your phone? That’s when you dropped the hundred and fifty yuan. I was just picking it up to return it to you!”

“I just don’t get it—why do you think I’m a scammer? Why so many misunderstandings? Who is such a kind-hearted scammer that they pick up money and keep trying to return it?”

The young man’s words poured out like firecrackers—he hadn’t stopped talking since entering the room.

The uncle accepted the one hundred and fifty yuan, glanced at it, and verified it was real.

Seeing the young man’s passionate lecturing, he realized he might have genuinely misunderstood this young guy.

After all, he had wronged him multiple times, and with the other’s fierce reprimand, the uncle’s own imposing aura had dwindled.

Thinking back, he had misunderstood the other person several times. The young man must have been feeling quite frustrated!

Moreover, he had even punched him yesterday!

The clownish uncle felt a wave of guilt wash over him.

“Also, about yesterday, I was planning to catch up and return your money, but you punched me! It hurt so much, do you even know? Because of that punch, the ‘Uncle One Punch vs. Young Guy’ incident has been spread all over my social circle. I’ve lost face all the way to the Pacific Ocean! Do you even know? At least for this month, I can’t face anyone!”

The young man kept going, his mouth never stopping, transitioning from “the basic trust between people” to “today’s society needs more love,” and then to “doing good deeds is a fine tradition passed down in Huaxia since ancient times.” He even touched on “after doing good deeds, it’s important to leave evidence to avoid being taken advantage of.”

Scholar Song was racking his brain, trying to come up with every possible topic to discuss, and he was parched from talking so much.

Realizing he was in the wrong, the uncle could only nod along. With every word from Scholar Song, he nodded once. At this point, he was feeling drowsy.

“So, Uncle, if it weren’t for someone like me finding your hundred and fifty yuan, if it were anyone else, they definitely wouldn’t have returned it!” Scholar Song cleared his throat.

But inside, he was in a state of panic.

This is bad; I’m running out of things to say. I’ve already covered the virtues and morals extensively—what more could I say about “the basic trust between people”?

Should I start discussing the three obediences and four virtues of ancient women?

Where is Dr. Li or the nurse? Even if I’ve read a lot, I’m reaching the limit of what I can talk about…

He aimed to stall until a nurse or doctor came to change the bandages—after all, once they arrived, the uncle might temporarily back off.

Unfortunately, Dr. Li had no intention of appearing, and the summon nurse button was blocked behind the uncle, leaving Scholar Song with no way to press it. Otherwise, with just a gentle poke, he could’ve summoned a beautiful female doctor along with a pure-hearted nurse.

There was no way out; he truly couldn’t keep this up anymore.

If he started dragging out the ancient virtues, even the uncle, as silly as he was, would realize something was off.

Thus, he had no choice but to activate the second plan.

Scholar Song pinched a pill-like object between his fingers—a Stink Pill!

This hilariously named item was coined by its creator, the Alchemical Sage. With just a strong impact, the outer shell would crack open, releasing a foul-smelling fog.

According to the Alchemical Sage, if a cultivator had opened their nasal passages but hadn’t reached the third rank and couldn’t control their sense of smell, then this stink would be a nightmare for them.
