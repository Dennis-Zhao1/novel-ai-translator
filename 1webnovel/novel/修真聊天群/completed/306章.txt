**Let’s Row Our Double Paddles!**

It was the phoenix tree! Scholar Song felt a spark of excitement in his heart; the branches of the phoenix tree are where the phoenix resides!

Could it be that the spirit beast he was about to meet was a phoenix? Even if it wasn’t a phoenix, it had to be a spirit beast related to one, right?

He was really looking forward to it. What kind of charm and beauty would a legendary divine beast possess? This was said to be the most beautiful and noble divine beast in the Middle Land’s legends.

Although he was filled with anticipation, Scholar Song still followed closely behind Miss Jiu Deng, not daring to stray even an inch, worried that he might accidentally get lost.

As he drew closer to the phoenix tree, Scholar Song sharpened his gaze and began to see the full form of this towering tree.

Standing over fifty meters tall, it soared majestically at the mouth of the valley. Its sturdy trunk bore the weight of history, rough and weathered!

Wait a second, there seemed to be a round, pinkish-white creature perched on the tree.

It looked plump and chubby, so appealing that it sparked an appetite just by looking at it.

It wasn’t a phoenix or a bird of any kind.

Scholar Song squinted, trying to adjust his vision to its maximum clarity.

Then he finally saw the true form of the round creature—it was a ball-shaped pig!

Due to its excessive weight, its four legs appeared tiny and short. Yet, these short little legs clung tightly to the trunk of the massive phoenix tree, preventing it from falling off.

But it looked like it was struggling…

“A pig that can climb trees!” Scholar Song exclaimed in astonishment.

“Shh.” Miss Jiu Deng, who was leading the way, softly admonished.

Scholar Song quickly closed his mouth. But this chubby pig clinging to the trunk of the phoenix tree was too eye-catching.

Thus, he couldn’t help but glance at it again and again, his curiosity piqued.

Perhaps Scholar Song’s gaze conveyed too much emotion, for the round pig sensed his attention.

It turned its head to look at Scholar Song, its dark eyes locking onto him.

“What are you staring at?” the round pig suddenly spoke, its voice booming like thunder, causing Scholar Song's ears to ring. That roar could rival a lion's roar.

Before Scholar Song could respond, Miss Jiu Deng smirked, “What are you looking at?”

“Try staring at me one more time?!” the round pig bellowed.

“Try me! What’s it to you?” Miss Jiu Deng tilted her head, fixing her gaze on the round pig. Her eyes were locked onto it, not blinking even once.

The round pig fell silent, and after a moment, it began to turn a bright shade of pink.

After a while, it weakly spoke, “Stop staring at me like that, you’re embarrassing me…”

Scholar Song: “…”

Please don’t tell him that this round ball of a pig was the powerful spirit beast they were here to meet?

Even if the elder wasn’t a phoenix, it shouldn’t be a pig, right? The disparity was just too vast!

At that moment, Miss Jiu Deng smirked, “Fat Ball, stop this charade. Every time I come here, I have to deal with your antics. Aren’t you tired of this yet?”

“I just enjoy it,” the pig, now entirely blushing pink, replied weakly.

“Next time, at least give me a different line, or I’ll really hit you,” Miss Jiu Deng warned. “Now, is the elder still in the valley?”

“Yep, are you looking for him for something?” the pink pig asked.

“Isn’t that obvious? I’m so busy running to this valley; do you think I’m here just to play with you?” Miss Jiu Deng scoffed.

Scholar Song let out a quiet sigh of relief. It seemed that this pig named “Fat Ball” wasn’t the elder spirit beast but rather the guardian of the valley. Thank goodness…

“I really thought you were here to play with me,” Fat Ball murmured, then it lifted a paw and gently tapped three times on the phoenix tree.

In the next moment, the beautiful valley scene in front of Scholar Song suddenly transformed into a vast, black ocean—an endless expanse of pitch-black sea, utterly silent!

Moreover, there was not a single object floating on the surface of the massive sea. It seemed like everything that had fallen into the water had sunk to the bottom.

If… it weren’t for the signal initiated by the guardian Fat Ball, anyone attempting to rush into the previous beautiful valley would fall into this endless, dark sea.

Once the black sea appeared, Fat Ball tapped three more times on the phoenix tree.

On the desolate black surface, a solitary boat suddenly materialized out of thin air.

“Let’s go, follow me,” Miss Jiu Deng beckoned, leading the way to the solitary boat. “Remember, once we’re on the sea, don’t say a word until we reach the shore! Regardless of who speaks to you, even if it’s me asking a question, you must not respond… otherwise, no one can save you.”

Scholar Song silently nodded, following Miss Jiu Deng as they boarded the solitary boat.

……

After boarding the boat, Miss Jiu Deng remained silent, merely handing the paddle to Scholar Song.

Taking the paddle in hand, Scholar Song tried to row.

The boat swiftly glided over the silent waters… Yet, strangely, despite seeing the paddle moving and the waves splashing, Scholar Song heard not a single sound of water.

As the solitary boat continued forward, Scholar Song gradually felt his body becoming heavy.

Initially, a gentle stroke of the paddle would send the boat gliding forward a significant distance. But now, even with all his strength, he could barely push it an inch.

Furthermore… if he paused even slightly, the boat would start to drift backward.

Rowing was proving to be no easy task in this eerie sea!

Scholar Song couldn't help but chuckle bitterly within himself, as he desperately paddled. He activated the blood energy in his body, knowing that this was the only way to keep the boat moving forward.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Let’s row our double paddles; the little boat pushes aside the waves~~ The surface reflects Scholar Song’s pale face~~

Scholar Song had already taken blood energy pills.

Without them, he wouldn’t be able to hold on.

He had lost track of how long he had been rowing in this silent ocean. There was no shore in sight ahead, nor any boundary behind him. The vast sea stretched endlessly, with no indication of an endpoint.

His blood energy had been depleted time and again. Each time he ran out, he had no choice but to swallow another blood energy pill to replenish his strength.

He was nearly out of pills, yet still hadn’t spotted the opposite shore.

Despite his pale complexion, Scholar Song’s mindset remained calm.

—This was all thanks to Mistress Scallion. Not long ago, when Scholar Song entered Mistress Scallion's dream, he personally experienced what it was like to be a scallion, enduring countless years of solitude through storms.

His patience had thereby strengthened immensely.

Even the monotonous act of rowing, with no end in sight, he could maintain a serene and composed mindset.

This aspect even surprised Miss Jiu Deng, who stole a glance at him.

The little boat continued to move forward, cutting through the silent sea.

……

……

After an unknown amount of time, Scholar Song suddenly felt a lightness in his body.

That sensation felt like shedding a hundred-pound weight while trudging through a desert, suddenly feeling liberated. He felt as if he could float, and the motion of his rowing became effortless.

Was he nearing the shore? He thought to himself.

Just as he was pondering, the scene before him shifted again.

The once silent, black sea transformed into a pure white expanse. And before him, a dock had appeared out of nowhere.

Moreover, pure spiritual energy began to flow into his body, continuously nourishing him. This was a reward for successfully crossing the long, dark sea.

“You can speak now,” Miss Jiu Deng’s voice came through.

Scholar Song breathed a sigh of relief, ready to respond.

But suddenly, he clamped his hands over his mouth—he had almost spoken! Yet he was still on the water! They hadn’t reached the shore yet!

That was close!

As Scholar Song held his mouth shut, it felt as though he had passed some kind of test, and the pure spiritual energy began to surge into his body even more rapidly.

Before entering the Celestial Realm Island, Scholar Song had already activated his four major acupoints: ‘Heart, Eye, Nose, and Ear’ and was now pushing towards the fifth acupoint, the ‘Mouth Acupoint’.

If only he hadn’t cut off Mistress Scallion, as Venerable White had said, if he had consumed her scallion shoots, perhaps he could have filled his mouth acupoint with energy in one go.

But now, pure spiritual energy was continuously pouring into him from the heavens, especially when he almost spoke; it surged in like a pillar, directly entering his mouth and filling his mouth acupoint, granting him a terrifying breakthrough.

Plus, with the countless blood energy pills he had swallowed while rowing over the silent sea, it was akin to repeated cultivation sessions.

Consequently, the energy within his mouth acupoint rose to nine-tenths capacity. Just a little more accumulation, and he would reach the full capacity of the mouth acupoint, allowing him to break through to the mouth acupoint level!

Once the mouth acupoint opened, he would be faced with the final step of ‘Leaping Through the Dragon Gate’!

What a delightful surprise!

Scholar Song rowed with all his might and finally… reached the shore.

……

……

After securing the boat, Miss Jiu Deng lightly leaped onto the dock. She then reached out to pull Scholar Song up.

“Now, you can speak,” Miss Jiu Deng smiled.

Scholar Song watched her mouth move, confirming that his feet were firmly on solid ground, safely away from the water, before he sighed in relief.

“That was close,” Scholar Song replied.

“Yeah, you were quite clever,” Miss Jiu Deng said with a smile, brushing off her greenish-white monk robes. “Let’s go; we’re about to officially meet that esteemed spirit beast elder.”

Scholar Song cautiously asked, “Miss Jiu Deng, what’s the elder spirit beast like? What are its likes and dislikes? And what does it look like?”

Knowing oneself and one’s enemy ensures victory in every battle.

“As for personality, there’s no point in asking; it’s pointless. Likes and dislikes are also ever-changing,” Miss Jiu Deng sighed. “As for appearance, it has over thirty-six forms.”

Scholar Song: “…”

What kind of divine entity is Miss Jiu Deng describing?
