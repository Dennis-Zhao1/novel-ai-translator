**Make a Wish on a Shooting Star! (Extra Chapter from the Cawei Alliance)**

“I've heard that Wenzhou City has a plethora of snacks and delicious foods. Let’s take a trip there and eat before heading back to the Empty Thief Sect,” thought Scholar Song to himself.

Having been sealed away for two hundred years, he felt that this era was truly a time for enjoyment!

With the internet, cinemas, theaters, and all sorts of new and exciting activities, even the ancient imperial families couldn’t match the indulgence of people today—of course, that’s assuming you have enough money!

The only downside was the serious environmental pollution caused by technological development. But that was no big deal; such a harsh environment was nothing to a cultivator.

Scholar Song was already a powerful being who had condensed his golden core; no matter how dire the Earth’s conditions became, they couldn’t harm him.

So, whether it was roadside snacks, fried foods, or various junk foods, as long as they looked good and tasted great, Scholar Song would indulge himself without reservation.

Viruses and the like? They posed no threat to him at all.

For instance, after devouring fifty skewers of grilled lamb, Scholar Song felt a slight discomfort in his stomach, but his body automatically reacted, easily neutralizing any toxins that had invaded.

Speaking of which, what kind of skewers could make his current constitution feel even a bit uneasy? 

But that flavor was absolutely fantastic; just thinking about it made his mouth water. Next time he had the chance, he would definitely have to try it again!

“Let’s go, let’s go! Let’s see what delicious and fun things Wenzhou City has to offer!” Scholar Song joyfully summoned his sword light and zoomed off towards the city.

……

As he flew, Scholar Song suddenly furrowed his brow.

“Strange, why do I feel that ominous sense of danger hovering above me again? And it’s getting heavier,” he murmured to himself.

“Could it be that I woke up wrong this morning, or did I take a bad position while washing up yesterday?”

This sense of impending doom was not new to Scholar Song; ever since he broke free from the Five Finger Mountain sealing technique, he had felt a looming disaster overhead.

Initially, he thought it was some trap or backhand left by the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, and he had tried various methods to dispel it, but to no avail.

Just yesterday, however, this ominous sign had suddenly vanished.

But now, why had it returned?

“What the hell is going on? If it’s death, at least let it be quick,” he thought grimly.

After a moment of silence, Scholar Song gritted his teeth.

His life was a priority; the plan to enjoy Wenzhou City was canceled. He would simply pass through the city and return to the Empty Thief Sect.

Once back at the sect, with the sect’s great formation protecting him, he wouldn’t have to fear any ominous signs!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On a highway heading to Wenzhou City.

Vroom vroom… vroom!

The tractor roared as Scholar Song gripped the handlebars, his entire body vibrating with the movement of the vehicle. He was having a blast!

You see, this hand tractor, when no one could see your face, was surprisingly fun to drive.

The heavy front end, the jolting start-up—it was just like what Elder Bai had said before—such a great feel!

Especially when this hand tractor could zoom at speeds of up to one hundred or even one hundred fifty miles per hour, the sensation was simply exhilarating. Once you started, you just couldn’t stop!

“Ah ha! Elder Bai, we should be arriving in Wenzhou City in about half an hour, then we’ll quickly reach White Whale Road, which is where my home is,” Scholar Song said to Elder Bai.

He was worried that Elder Bai might suddenly zone out from boredom, which would be troublesome, so he often sought to keep the conversation flowing.

But this time, he waited for a long time without receiving a reply from Elder Bai.

Scholar Song quickly turned his head to sneak a glance and found Elder Bai with his eyes closed, curled up in a ball.

Is he asleep?

Could it be that he exhausted a lot of spiritual energy treating me and Instructor Li this morning, leaving him worn out?

Or…

Scholar Song slowly eased the tractor’s speed and pulled over to the side of the road.

Then he extended his hand and waved it in front of Elder Bai.

Elder Bai remained completely unresponsive—he was breathing, well, no, he wasn’t. At Elder Bai’s level, he had long since stopped needing to breathe.

Scholar Song thought for a moment and pulled something out of his pocket. It was a small flute, known as the ‘Flute of Long-Distance Communication,’ which the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain had gifted him when he first brought Elder Bai out of seclusion.

With this flute, he could contact Elder Bai.

He tried blowing into the ‘Flute of Long-Distance Communication.’

Soon, a soft voice from Elder Bai came through the flute. 

“Zzzz… Hello.”

Scholar Song glanced at Elder Bai, who didn’t move an inch, and his heart began to form a guess.

“Zzzz… Hello, this is ‘Ah Bai’ in seclusion. There are still 2 days, 3 hours, and 2 quarters until the end of this seclusion. Please be patient,” the flute continued with Elder Bai’s voice.

Indeed, Elder Bai was in seclusion.

The seclusion addict, Elder Bai, had simply felt that sitting in the car with nothing to do led him to enter seclusion. How long should he stay in? If he was going to enter, he might as well do a short two-day session.

Thus, Elder Bai had entered seclusion for over two days.

……

Scholar Song rubbed his forehead.

Elder, could you shorten your seclusion time a bit?

What am I going to do with you when I take you home?

If Elder Bai’s seclusion lasted only half a day, Scholar Song could say, “My friend is a bit tired from the journey and is taking a rest, let him recharge.”

But two days of seclusion? How would he explain that to Father Song and Mother Song?

“My friend is a champion sleeper, he sleeps for two days at a time, don’t worry about it?”

Worry about what? Who could possibly sleep for two days straight? A vegetable?!

At that point, wouldn’t Father Song be worried sick and rush Elder Bai off to the hospital?

“What should I do? Maybe I should find a hotel near my house and settle Elder Bai there first?” Scholar Song mused.

But as soon as that thought crossed his mind, he quickly dismissed it.

What nonsense! Leave Elder Bai alone at a hotel?

And if Elder Bai entered a ‘true illusion’ in the middle of his seclusion, then all the people in the hotel would surely be tormented to death by the blue-clothed young man. There would definitely be fatalities!

Even if he didn’t create a ‘true illusion,’ with Elder Bai’s stunning looks and charm, it was entirely likely that if he left him in a hotel, the next moment, a bunch of rich dudes would roll in, bringing burly men to snatch Elder Bai away.

That kind of thing was entirely possible. There was precedent!

When they first brought Elder Bai out of seclusion, the wealthy patrons had nearly fought over a statue of him, almost losing their minds.

“Forget it, I’ll just take him home first. Then I’ll find Dou Dou and the little monk, and have Dou Dou set up a barrier in my room,” Scholar Song sighed, rubbing his temples.

As for how to explain to Father Song and Mother Song—he would just have to cross that bridge when he got to it. It would all work out in the end!

If worse comes to worst, he could just introduce Elder Bai as a vegetable.

With a heavy sigh, Scholar Song returned to the driver’s seat of the tractor, preparing to start it up again.

The roar of the tractor filled the air once more, black smoke billowing out…

Just as Scholar Song was ready to start the tractor, a beautiful shooting star streaked across the sky.

Even in broad daylight, it shone bright and dazzling.

“A shooting star?”

Scholar Song closed his eyes, pressed his palms together, and quickly murmured, “I hope Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan stays healthy, hope the Hermit of North River, Wild Blade of Three Tides, and Elder Gu He can resolve their memory issues!”

As he said this, he cautiously opened his eyes to check on the shooting star. It was still streaking across the sky, trailing long behind it, still bright enough for another wish.

“I hope this trip with Elder Bai goes smoothly, without causing any trouble. And I hope Dou Dou and the little monk stop messing around and behave!”

After saying that, he opened his eyes again; the shooting star was still moving, becoming even brighter.

“For my last wish, I hope my path of cultivation will be even smoother, hoping for good fortune, oh yeah!”

Wishing on a shooting star had been something Scholar Song would never have done in the past—he certainly didn’t believe in that nonsense back then.

Though now, he didn’t really believe in it either!

But ever since he got involved with the cultivation world, he had started to feel that ‘luck’ was quite mysterious. After all, he had a friend with some seriously bizarre luck right next to him!

While wishing on a shooting star might seem silly, it could at least bring a sense of peace.

With a better mindset, maybe his luck would improve as well.

After making all his wishes, Scholar Song opened his eyes to gaze at the shooting star.

Huh? Was it just his imagination, or was that shooting star becoming increasingly bright and… larger?

Oh no! That shooting star was coming straight for him!

Scholar Song felt a sudden pressure in his bladder—his mind promptly recalled a scene he had almost forgotten.

That day, when he was being chased by the leader of the Wujimeng, he had used the ‘Ten Thousand Miles Flight Technique,’ spinning through the air to land beside Elder Bai, who was holding the Cold Flame Sword.

He had witnessed Scholar Yunwu escape from the sealing technique of the Five Finger Mountain.

At that time, Elder Bai had suddenly started talking with the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain about a celestial stone from outer space, rumored to aid first-rank cultivators in breaking through their limitations when near it.

Finally, Elder Bai casually remarked, “If only Scholar Song could get his hands on such a stone…”

At that moment, Scholar Song had been frightened.

He feared that one day, a meteor might fall from the sky and land on him.

For several days afterward, he had remained on high alert.

Fortunately, Elder Bai had been merely stating an offhand comment, and that remark had not turned into ‘Elder Bai's blessing.’ He had managed to pass those days in peace.

Slowly, he had allowed himself to forget the incident.

But he never expected that the inevitable would finally come.

That meteor was indeed heading straight for him!

Scholar Song sighed, intently watching the meteor, calculating where it might land… If he could spot it, he could dodge it.

If worse came to worst, he could always hide behind Elder Bai. Even in his meditative state, Elder Bai’s instinctual protective aura should be enough to shield him from a falling meteor, right?
