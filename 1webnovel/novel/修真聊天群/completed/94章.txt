**Chapter 1: I’m Not a Fraud, Uncle!**

As soon as Scholar Song returned to Jiangnan University Town, his sister dragged him off to the hospital.

“Ya Ya, I swear, the four herbal medicines I checked at the pharmacy on Guangyuan Road aren’t for me! I’m just helping a friend who needs them. I went there to confirm they had the right ones! Really, just look into my eyes—so sincere! Can’t you trust me? Sister… just take a moment to look at my eyes! They’re filled with sincerity!” Scholar Song pleaded, feeling the gentle tug of Zhao Ya Ya’s small hand. He didn’t dare to pull away too hard—his current strength was like that of a bull, and if he exerted even a little bit of force, he might send his sister flying.

That would scare her to death. So, he could only use his words, trying to persuade her otherwise.

Zhao Ya Ya turned her head, fixing her serious gaze on Scholar Song’s… eyes.

After a brief pause, she answered, “Scholar, you’ve got eye boogers!”

Scholar Song: “…”

“Alright, stop being so long-winded. Just consider this as me giving you a little benefit—an opportunity for a free check-up! Even a healthy person should get a check-up regularly; it’s not a bad thing!” Zhao Ya Ya said softly, her tone calm.

But inside, she was far from calm—Scholar Song’s stubbornness only heightened her worries.

What if Scholar Song is really sick?

Her mind swirled with thoughts of various late-stage illnesses, making her feel anxious.

Even if Scholar Song spoke like he was painting the sky, she wouldn’t change her mind. She couldn’t rest easy until he got a full check-up.

“Fine, I’ll let you have your way today, sister.” Scholar Song declared with a sense of righteousness—Zhao Ya Ya was determined to get him to the hospital. He could only be thankful that he didn’t have to go through what two of his unfortunate mentors had: losing a leg before entering the hospital.

After all, his health was currently in tip-top shape, and even if they did a health check, nothing would come up wrong.

Speaking of which, as Zhao Ya Ya held his hand and pulled him along, the gazes of passersby sharpened around them.

He was all too familiar with those sharp looks—having experienced them countless times since childhood. It was the envy of many men who were jealous of the close hand-holding between him and a stunning beauty.

Sure, she’s my sister, and we’re just holding hands (this joke is for those in the know). But how could those random bystanders understand? Hmph, let them envy, let them be jealous!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Jiangnan University Town had its own hospital, although it wasn’t located within the university town itself; it was situated less than a thousand meters away.

After all, hospitals need to make money. If they were inside the university town, the influx of patients would add an extra burden to the town’s management and security.

Since it was only a short walk to the hospital, Zhao Ya Ya chose to go on foot.

Above them, the sun shone mercilessly, radiating light and heat to benefit humanity… while also roasting the unfortunate pedestrians hurrying along the road.

The temperature was high, and a rosy hue spread across Zhao Ya Ya’s cheeks, with glistening beads of sweat trickling down her fair skin from her face…

Scholar Song quietly sighed, focusing his spiritual energy to secretly release the chilly aura of the ‘Frozen Soul Pearl,’ enveloping Zhao Ya Ya within it.

“Hey? Is it getting cooler?” Zhao Ya Ya looked up at the sky, where the sun remained blazing, the sunlight still unrelenting.

But why did she feel this refreshing chill? It felt even better than air conditioning!

“Must be a cool breeze,” Scholar Song casually replied.

Zhao Ya Ya nodded but noticed the sweaty pedestrians on the roadside, looking like they’d been roasted alive… It didn’t seem like a cool breeze was blowing.

“Whatever, let’s hurry while it’s still cool,” Zhao Ya Ya said, not dwelling on it further.

…

…

Upon arriving at the hospital, Zhao Ya Ya immediately led Scholar Song to the check-up area; she had already registered him earlier.

“Come on,” she said, still holding his hand, as if scared he might bolt.

Scholar Song obediently followed behind her.

The Jiangnan University Town Affiliated Hospital was packed with patients, and recently, the most common cases were colds. The unique climate in the Jiangnan region—sweltering in the morning and making one wish to curl up in a blanket at night—had led to a steady increase in seasonal flu cases. Quite the achievement, if you asked him.

Since most of the patients were students, Scholar Song spotted several familiar faces along the way, but they were merely acquaintances, exchanging greetings before parting with smiles.

“Ya Ya, are we there yet?” Scholar Song, feeling like they’d been walking forever, wondered why the hospital corridors had to be so long and complex. What if someone needed emergency care, and they ended up dying while traversing the never-ending hallways?

“Almost there,” Zhao Ya Ya replied, her head not turning to him.

They continued walking for what felt like ages…

Scholar Song suddenly spotted a familiar figure.

It was a middle-aged uncle in a white shirt and black pants, clutching a briefcase under his left arm. Even in the hospital, he looked rushed, wearing a pained expression that suggested he was being crushed by life’s burdens.

This was the same uncle who dropped money in front of Scholar Song last time and mistakenly thought he was a fraud.

If he recalled correctly, the uncle had lost over one hundred fifty dollars, right?

Moreover, earlier today, they’d briefly crossed paths in the subway.

At that time, Scholar Song was getting on the subway while the uncle was getting off. The man had looked rather sketchy, almost like he was stalking someone.

It seemed that he and this uncle were fated to meet, and it looked like that one hundred fifty dollars was destined to be returned! Scholar Song thought to himself, then shouted, “Uncle! Uncle! Hello there!”

Zhao Ya Ya looked at him curiously, “You know him?”

The uncle turned around, looking confused as he stared at Scholar Song. Clearly, he had completely forgotten about him.

“Uncle, it’s me! The last time you were walking in front of me, you dropped one hundred fifty bucks, and I picked it up! It’s such a coincidence to see you again; I have to return it!” Scholar Song exclaimed, reaching into his pocket to pull out a hundred fifty in cash.

As he spoke, the uncle’s expression shifted to one of realization, and he pointed at Scholar Song, saying, “Fraud?”

“……” Scholar Song.

“Uncle, I’m not a fraud! You dropped over one hundred fifty bucks last time, and I really just want to return it to you! I can give it back right now!” Scholar Song patiently explained—he felt there was a strange fate in their repeated encounters, so he could afford to be patient.

But the uncle’s face changed dramatically, and he muttered under his breath, “These days, frauds are so brazen? Following me around to scam me? Did he bring accomplices too? Is this still a lawful society?! Disgusting! Do you really think I’m that foolish? Hmph, it’s useless… I know your true colors; there’s no way I’ll be fooled!”

With that, the uncle swiftly turned around and bolted away.

Scholar Song stood there, hand outstretched with the hundred fifty still in it, unsure whether to withdraw it or keep it extended.

Uncle, I never thought you were foolish from the start… but it seems that you really are!

Zhao Ya Ya noticed the increasingly judgmental glares from the crowd around them and helplessly pressed Scholar Song’s hand back down, “You good Samaritan! Forget about that uncle; let’s go.”

Scholar Song couldn’t help but chuckle, seeking comfort from Zhao Ya Ya, “Sister, where do I look like a fraud?”

“Alright, alright, you don’t look like a fraud at all,” Zhao Ya Ya laughed heartily, pulling Scholar Song along as they hurried away.
