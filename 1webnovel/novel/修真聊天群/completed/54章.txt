**Chapter 1: A Twist of Fate**

On the other side of the rooftop.

The two martial arts masters were locked in an intense battle, their determination to emerge victorious blazing hotter than the sun hanging overhead. The clash of their skills sent ripples through the air, but Scholar Song chose to remain hidden for the moment, biding his time.

After observing for a while, he sensed the fight nearing its climax, particularly with the male master seemingly preparing a formidable technique—*New Armstrong Style Rotating Armstrong Cannon!*

“Now’s my chance!” Scholar Song seized the opportunity, poking his head out and greeting the two fighters with a cheerful, clear voice, “Hey, how’s it going!”

**Crack…**

The sudden intrusion was like a bucket of ice-cold water dumped over the two masters.

The male master felt his heartbeat surge, nearly leaping out of his chest in shock. He turned his head rigidly toward the source of the disruption, only to find that the interloper was a frail-looking student rather than a dormitory supervisor. His expression twisted into one of fierce indignation, his fists clenching—any man would feel enraged in such a moment.

“I know, I know! Watching your epic duel must be quite the spectacle, I could hear it from afar. So no need to thank me, my name is Lei Feng.” Scholar Song waved his hand dismissively, beaming with enthusiasm. “Oh, and remember to lock the rooftop afterward. Otherwise, it’ll be trouble if the dorm supervisor finds out!”

With that, Scholar Song swaggered off the rooftop, heading back to his dorm, leaving behind two martial artists caught between laughter, tears, and fury.

“Ah, today was another good deed done… fulfilling both of their wishes. What a splendid day!” Scholar Song mused, his mood light and joyful.

…

…

The saying “joy brings sorrow” comes from the text *Huainanzi*—“When things reach their peak, they decline, and great joy leads to sorrow.” It describes how, at the height of happiness, one can suddenly encounter a devastating event that brings tears to their eyes and heartache to their soul.

For instance, imagine someone winning a ten-million dollar jackpot—after taxes, of course—ecstatic with joy! Then, just an hour later, they learn they’re in the late stages of cancer and will pass away by morning. Their sorrow would be overwhelming, enough to flood the world with tears.

After Scholar Song's encounter on the rooftop, he felt on top of the world, completely satisfied and blissful.

However, when he swung open the door to his dorm room, he was met with a startling sight: a woman clad in a stark white medical gown sat leisurely on his bed. She exuded a captivating charm, her figure flawless, with long, powerful legs that even the simplest white joggers couldn’t hide.

In her hands, she flipped through a notebook filled with formulas for “Simplified Body Refining Liquid,” her brow furrowed in concentration.

“Yaya, what are you doing here at our school?” A cold sweat broke out on Scholar Song’s forehead, cascading down uncontrollably.

This woman in the medical uniform was none other than Zhao Yaya, Scholar Song’s uncle’s precious daughter. Last semester, when he first arrived at university, she had accompanied him to Jiangnan University Town, which is why she had a key to his dorm and could waltz right in.

Zhao Yaya was the very same person Scholar Song had wanted to consult about the “Simplified Body Refining Liquid” after spotting its recipe. Unfortunately, after her lack of response online, coupled with his preoccupations with “cultivation” and “refining liquids,” he had completely forgotten about her.

Now, unexpectedly, she had come to confront him in person.

It was the worst timing and the most inappropriate place to run into someone like her.

One could never be too joyful, as it could easily lead to sorrow.

Zhao Yaya lifted her gaze, her captivating phoenix eyes locking onto Scholar Song.

Being in the medical field, she rarely wore makeup, as cosmetics could interfere during surgeries. Yet, even without it, she was undeniably a beauty, above the average standard.

Coincidentally, Scholar Song was still feeling weak due to the effects of the *True Self Meditation Scripture*.

“Pale complexion, weak aura. No wonder you’re looking for such bizarre tonics,” Zhao Yaya remarked, closing the notebook. “Scholar Song, you can’t just take any random medicine. This formula is filled with powerful tonics that could be incredibly dangerous when mixed together. Plus, remember, all medicine has its poison. If you combine so many herbs, it could turn toxic! If you’re sick, you should go see a doctor!”

Scholar Song’s mind was racing. He hadn’t yet recovered from the weakness caused by the *True Self Meditation Scripture*, which made him appear even paler than usual. He hadn’t anticipated that Zhao Yaya would misunderstand his situation based on the “Simplified Body Refining Liquid” recipe.

He needed to clear things up immediately; otherwise, it would become a disaster when his mother arrived tomorrow. Zhao Mama would surely drag him to the hospital!

Oh… Perhaps it wasn’t a misunderstanding. After all, he had already made one fatal mistake by consuming the “Refining Liquid.”

Regardless, he had to cover it up for now.

“Ahem, Yaya, it’s not what you think. The formula… well, it’s like this!” Scholar Song’s brain scrambled to organize his thoughts.

Had he not confirmed the existence of “cultivation,” he could have easily explained to Zhao Yaya that it was a concoction created by a bunch of fantasy enthusiasts, and he was worried that they might harm themselves with it, hence asking her for help. 

However, now that those fantasy enthusiasts had transformed into genuine cultivators, Scholar Song felt embarrassed to present that as his first response. He was on the verge of becoming one of those “cultivators” himself. He couldn’t possibly categorize himself as a mere fantasy enthusiast, could he?

“Go on, I’m listening,” Zhao Yaya raised an eyebrow, crossing her legs, her gaze fixed on Scholar Song. She knew him too well; she could always tell when he was lying.

Because of this “superpower,” Scholar Song had been caught lying in his childhood more times than he could count. However, she rarely exposed him in front of his parents.

Otherwise, he would have faced countless rounds of discipline during his childhood!

This was one reason why Scholar Song felt especially close to Zhao Yaya; she was the older sister who covered for him.

“Well, here’s the thing. Not long ago, I unexpectedly joined a group online. I swear, at that time, I didn’t recognize a single person in the group.” Scholar Song knew he had little hope of lying to Zhao Yaya, so he could only partially conceal the truth. “The members of that group were a bit odd, and I guessed they must have read too many fantasy novels.”

That had been his initial guess, but now he was fully aware that they were bona fide “cultivators.”

“Later, someone shared a formula in the group, which is the one you’re holding now. Besides these formulas, there were many herbs I couldn’t find online, some with names I had never even heard of, and they sounded fantastical.”

Even now, he still didn’t know what some of those herbs were or what effects they had, and names like Morning Dew Mystic Grass were indeed peculiar.

“I was worried, you know? I feared that if they took the medicine, they might end up in serious trouble. So, I copied the ones I could find online, intending to ask you to help me look into them. If the concoction could potentially be lethal, I would warn the group before leaving. That’s how it was!” Scholar Song shrugged.

Yes, he wasn’t lying; that had genuinely been his mindset at the time, and he did want to do that.
