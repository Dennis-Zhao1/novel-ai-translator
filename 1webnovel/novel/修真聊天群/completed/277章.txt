**The Terrifying Branch Pathfinding Method**

When a cultivator reaches the first-tier realm and opens the four acupoints, they usually gain at least one innate talent... Some lucky ones even have the opportunity to awaken two acupoint talents.

Scholar Song was fortunate enough to awaken the talent of the eye acupoint, but the nasal acupoint did not respond with any innate gift.

He couldn't help but wonder if he was lucky enough to awaken the corresponding talents for the ear and mouth acupoints when the time came.

“It’s been over a month since I started cultivating. I can hardly believe it; it feels like a dream,” Scholar Song sighed.

The seniors in the group had said that wandering cultivators faced enormous challenges, yet his journey had been remarkably smooth. He first met Fay Yu, then the Alchemical Sage, followed by Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan, and finally Venerable White. His progress had been as good as, if not better than, the elite disciples in the sect.

In his pocket, Mistress Scallion, the spirit of the enlightenment stone, had already fainted from crying... In just over a month, he was about to break through to the ear acupoint?

And she, after over three hundred years, had only just managed to awaken her third acupoint, the nasal one... The ear acupoint was still a distant dream!

The thought of Scholar Song easily breaking through the nasal acupoint and filling his ear acupoint with energy, all due to consuming her scallion shoots, made her want to weep even more.

She felt like she was aiding the enemy!

It was infuriating; what to do about the urge to cry?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

July 13th, Saturday, light rain.

Scholar Song stood in a clearing in the forest, his hands slightly raised, eyes closed, carefully listening to the subtle sounds of raindrops falling into his palms.

The sound of raindrops hitting the leaves…

The sweet chirping of various birds…

The faint buzzing of insects in the underbrush…

The rustling sounds of small animals scurrying through the shrubs…

Even the sounds of creatures burrowing underground…

All these sounds wove together into a magnificent symphony of nature in Scholar Song's ears. He immersed himself in the beautiful melody, lost in its charm.

He could hear these sounds because his ear acupoint had opened.

After today’s training, just as Scholar Song expected, the energy in his ear acupoint surged and broke through the bottleneck. In an instant, it was as if a person with poor hearing suddenly regained their sense of sound. He was flooded with sounds he had never heard before.

The opening of the ear acupoint was not merely amplifying sounds.

The voices of ordinary people sounded the same to him as before, clearer perhaps, but not deafening. The ear acupoint allowed him to hear many sounds that normal people could not, including some special sound waves!

The sounds of nature were so enchanting, they captivated him entirely.

Yet he felt a tinge of disappointment—he still hadn’t awakened the talent of the ear acupoint.

However, there was still a chance with the mouth acupoint left to open; perhaps he would gain a remarkable talent there.

Scholar Song felt like a lucky person!

Even if he didn’t awaken a talent for the mouth acupoint, he had already awakened a decent talent for the eye acupoint, so there was no need for despair.

Time passed…

After Scholar Song's clothes were thoroughly soaked, he reluctantly emerged from his wonderful state.

At this moment, he was still unaware that listening to the sounds of nature was extremely beneficial for cultivators, particularly enhancing their mindset and mental strength.

Choosing to break through the ear acupoint in the forest turned out to be an incredibly wise decision.

……

……

“My ear acupoint is opened, and tomorrow I’ll head to the vacation island in the East Sea,” Scholar Song said as he took out his phone to check for updates. Still no word from Venerable White: “Could it be that even Venerable White hasn’t found Dou Dou yet?”

Was Dou Dou hiding so well this time?

“If Venerable White can’t bring Dou Dou and the others back tonight, then I’ll have to meet up with them after arriving at the island,” Scholar Song tucked his phone back into his pocket.

Then he pulled out the enlightenment stone once more, glancing at Mistress Scallion on it.

The young shoots of Mistress Scallion had only grown to the size of a fingernail.

“The ear acupoint is opened; next up is the mouth acupoint.”

“Even if I eat it, I can’t instantly fill my mouth acupoint with energy, right?” Scholar Song muttered.

Moreover, without any seniors around, eating Mistress Scallion’s shoots was a risky business—wait, hold on!

Was I seriously contemplating whether or not to eat Mistress Scallion?

What a dangerous thought!

At that moment... the enlightenment stone trembled slightly.

“Please... please don’t eat me anymore!” Mistress Scallion spoke up, her voice filled with desperation. Even for her, being sliced with a knife was quite painful.

Scholar Song was taken aback. “Huh? You can talk now?”

“I can! I can! Suddenly, I can talk!” Mistress Scallion exclaimed. “Please don’t eat me, okay? If you don’t eat me, I can give you a scroll of the ‘Buddhist Lion’s Roar Technique’! You wanted to open your mouth acupoint, right? The Lion’s Roar technique is directly related to the mouth acupoint. If you start practicing it, it will greatly aid you in opening your mouth acupoint!”

“Oh?” Scholar Song smiled, remaining silent.

“It’s a trade! If you promise not to cut my shoots anymore, I’ll give you that scroll of ‘Buddhist Lion’s Roar Technique’ right away, okay?” Mistress Scallion pleaded eagerly.

“Alright.” Scholar Song replied with a smile—he hadn’t planned on eating Mistress Scallion’s shoots anyway. The thought of consuming what could transform into a girl made him feel a bit guilty.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile, Venerable White was tracking Dou Dou and the little monk.

He soared straight toward a direction, exuding confidence in his ability to locate Dou Dou and the little monk.

Because he possessed a terrifying, exclusive tracking method!

As he flew, Venerable White descended from the sky.

He casually picked up a forked branch and tossed it into the air.

The branch spun sixteen times before landing, the forked end pointing steadily to the southwest.

“Oh, southwest, huh?” Venerable White nodded to himself, re-establishing his escape light and flying south without hesitation...

This was Venerable White’s domineering tracking technique.

No matter how adept a target was at counter-tracking, under the might of Venerable White’s ‘Branch Pathfinding Method’, they had nowhere to hide! Even if they erased all traces of their movement, it would be of no use—because Venerable White didn’t even look at their tracks.

However, this method was exclusive to Venerable White; it would not work for anyone else.

Moreover… this tracking method had a small drawback.

For instance, if the target suddenly changed direction while Venerable White was following the path indicated by the branch, and he hadn’t re-used the ‘Branch Pathfinding Method’ mid-way, he could easily overshoot and end up going further in the wrong direction.

Such an error could only be corrected when Venerable White used the ‘Branch Pathfinding Method’ again, at which point he would have to turn around and pursue in the opposite direction, wasting some time.

But all in all, with this terrifying ‘tracking’ method, finding Dou Dou and the little monk was just a matter of time!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

July 14th, Sunday, sunny.

Venerable White, Dou Dou, and the little monk had not returned.

Fay Yu had gone to help her good friend and had not responded to messages either.

Scholar Song pulled up his sports wristband, glancing at the 3D Gourd Baby tattoo on it, then at the women’s bracelet next to it.

He quietly wrapped the wristband back up; if his friends saw those two items, he would be too embarrassed.

However, with these two items, both Venerable White and Fay Yu had his coordinates. When he arrived at the East Sea vacation island, they would be able to find him without issue.

The only thing to worry about was—he needed to turn off his phone on the plane.

What if Venerable White and Fay Yu tried to contact him right at that moment and couldn’t get through? What if Venerable White shot Dou Dou and the little monk over with a single-use flying sword?

The plane might get blown up!

The same went for Fay Yu; what if a ‘Long-Distance Escape Technique’ crashed into the plane, creating a huge hole? That would be disastrous.

“Before getting on the plane, if I haven’t heard from the seniors and Fay Yu, I’ll give them a call to let them know. I must absolutely avoid those two situations from happening,” Scholar Song thought to himself.

Just as he was mulling over this, his phone rang.

It was a call from Gao Moumou.

“Scholar Song, are you still at home? Someone has already been sent to pick you up; we’re getting ready to head out,” Gao Moumou said.

“I’m ready to go; just waiting for you to pick me up,” Scholar Song replied with a smile.

His luggage consisted of a small backpack filled with cash, a hidden treasure dagger named Zhen Shattered, and on his finger was an ancient bronze ring. Around his neck hung the ‘Qingfeng Acceleration’ talisman. In his pocket were the last sword talisman, eight dispelling charms, energy pills, body refinement liquid, and fasting pills.

Everything was set.

“I’ll wait for you downstairs at your place; we’ll be there soon,” Gao Moumou said before adding, “By the way, didn’t you say you had several friends who wanted to come along? How come it’s just you in the end? Don’t hesitate to invite as many friends as you want; don’t worry about the cost!”

“Hehe, my friends just happened to have urgent matters come up, but they might go directly to the vacation island to meet us later,” Scholar Song laughed.

Gao Moumou expressed some regret before hanging up.

He didn’t expect to be setting off alone in the end.

Scholar Song slung his backpack over his shoulder, stepped out of his room, and called out to his mother, who was watching TV in the living room, “Mom, I’m off!”

“Be careful on the road. If Fay Yu comes over, be sure to bring her home for a few days after you all have fun!” Scholar Song’s mother said.

“I’ll remember that,” Scholar Song waved and smiled.

But speaking of Fay Yu... the day before yesterday, when she sent herself over, he had this strange feeling at the back of his neck, like someone was blowing cool air on him, or perhaps something was watching him from behind. He didn’t know what to make of it.
