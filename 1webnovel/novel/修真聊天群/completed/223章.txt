Chapter 

Anthony is still refusing to take off his helmet!

Venerable White activated the Heavenly Roc Escape Technique, achieving speeds nearly akin to teleportation. With the constraints of the ‘helicopter shell sword’ material, they expected to return to Middle Land in just over an hour. If only Venerable White used his Meteor Sword, they would be able to reach their destination several times faster.

During the return trip, Scholar Song logged onto the internet using his phone to look up news about the ‘space station’… After all, they had just made quite a hole in it.

As he typed in “space station,” several breaking news articles popped up immediately.

[Breaking News: The Alliance spacecraft has successfully entered the International Space Station's orbit and is preparing to dock with the space station to welcome back two astronauts!] The report was published six hours ago.

[Breaking News: The Alliance spacecraft has successfully launched, with five astronauts ready to dock at the International Space Station. They will replace the two astronauts currently on the station and conduct seventy space experiments in the upcoming period.] This report was published one day ago.

Docking at the space station to welcome back two astronauts… There was no mistake; it was indeed the space station they had just crashed into.

Moreover, the Alliance spacecraft had entered the space station's flight orbit six hours ago; surely they were already in the process of docking?

Scholar Song quietly wiped the sweat from his brow, relieved that he and Venerable White were one step ahead. Otherwise, they would have encountered the ‘Alliance spacecraft’ head-on.

...

An hour and a half later, Scholar Song and Venerable White successfully arrived in Middle Land, near the Jiangnan region.

“Shall we head straight to the flight school?” Venerable White inquired.

Scholar Song thought for a moment and replied, “Venerable White, let’s find a random place to land first, set up a scene for a helicopter crash, and then drop off Instructor Li.”

After all, the helicopter was in such a state that if they flew directly back to the flight school, the staff would be terrified.

It was better not to trouble the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain anymore.

“You have a point,” Venerable White nodded.

Then, Venerable White located a desolate area and landed the helicopter shell.

Scholar Song carefully carried Instructor Li out.

Venerable White wiped away the array engraved on the helicopter shell, then stepped on the edge of the helicopter, creating a small pit and tossing the helicopter shell into it.

They only needed to set up a random accident scene; the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain would send someone to handle the aftermath.

Scholar Song placed Instructor Li on the ground and reached to disconnect the helmet from the flight suit, saying, “Venerable White, can we wake Instructor Li up now?”

“Okay,” Venerable White nodded, preparing to remove the hypnosis spell.

At that moment, Scholar Song pushed the flight helmet up—wait, he remembered the helmet was supposed to be transparent. Why was there an extra layer of black screen inside, obscuring Instructor Li’s face?

The helmet was slowly lifted away.

Immediately, Scholar Song’s eyes widened, and he froze.

“Wait a second, Venerable!” Scholar Song shouted, stopping Venerable White from dispelling the hypnosis spell.

At the same time, he forcefully put the flight helmet back on and took a deep breath.

“What are you doing?” Venerable White asked curiously.

Scholar Song rubbed his eyes vigorously, “Hold on a second; let me rub my eyes. I think my eyes are tired from all the screen time.”

Venerable White looked puzzled...

Scholar Song reached out again and pushed the flight helmet off with force!

As the astronaut helmet was removed, the true identity of the man inside was revealed.

He appeared to be a man in his forties, well-preserved, though perhaps due to overthinking, his hair was graying, giving him a slightly premature aging appearance.

“What the heck is this!” Scholar Song felt like flipping a table!

Where was Instructor Li?

This spacesuit was the one he had put on Instructor Li! It even had the flag of Middle Land on it!

Could someone tell him why the person inside had turned into a foreigner?

“Where is Instructor Li?” Venerable White asked, equally curious.

“I want to know too,” Scholar Song said, feeling a mix of emotions, nearly on the verge of tears. “I have no idea what happened, but I think I might have grabbed the wrong person. Instructor Li is probably still at the space station?”

Venerable White was silent for a moment.

“This suit was originally for Instructor Li, but who would have thought this foreigner would end up inside it! And he even lowered the black screen in the helmet, blocking his face.” Scholar Song lamented.

This blunder had escalated.

“Don’t panic!” Venerable White said, thinking for a moment. “Let me create a ‘disposable flying sword version 004’ and send him back to the space station, shall we?”

As Venerable White suggested this, Scholar Song's mind immediately conjured an image—Venerable White crafting a ‘disposable flying sword version 004,’ setting the destination to the ‘space station,’ and with a flick of the sword technique, the disposable flying sword would take the nameless foreigner ‘whoosh’ straight up into the sky.

Then, the space station, already with a gaping hole, would suddenly explode in a mushroom cloud—caused by the very disposable flying sword!

Just the thought of this terrifying scene made Scholar Song shake his head vigorously.

“Venerable, let’s figure out a way to personally send him back to the space station… Besides, Instructor Li is still up there. We need to return the foreigner and bring Instructor Li back!” Scholar Song insisted.

“You make a good point,” Venerable White agreed.

“Let’s go retrieve Dou Dou first, then we can make another trip to the cosmos!” Scholar Song sighed, hoping the ‘Alliance’ would take a bit longer to retrieve the astronauts, giving him and Venerable White the chance to switch Instructor Li and the foreigner.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Since ‘Instructor Li’ was still at the space station, Scholar Song and Venerable White decided not to return to the flight school just yet. Instead, they flew on their swords to find Dou Dou.

At this moment, Dou Dou was joyfully flying the helicopter around.

“Wahaha, it’s just flying a helicopter! How could it possibly challenge me? Forget helicopters; tomorrow I’ll fly a space shuttle. What can you do about it, Yellow Mountain?” Dou Dou exclaimed happily, its front paws deftly navigating the helicopter's controls with practiced ease.

Suddenly, while flying, Dou Dou's grin froze.

Because right in front of the helicopter, Venerable White was soaring on his sword, a tranquil smile on his face.

Behind Venerable White, Scholar Song was carrying a man in a spacesuit, grinning maliciously: “Dou Dou!”

Dou Dou forced a laugh, “Ahaha, Scholar Song, you’re back! Welcome back!”

“Come home with me!” Scholar Song commanded.

“No way! I want to keep flying! I want to try flying a different kind of plane!” Dou Dou protested. It had finally found a chance to fly a helicopter, and it wasn’t going to give that up easily!

“Venerable, we don’t have much time; let’s just grab Dou Dou!” Scholar Song suggested.

Venerable White smiled gently at Dou Dou, “Dou Dou, be good. Fly the helicopter back; we’re going home now.”

“I don’t want to… Oh, okay, I’ll head back right now!” Dou Dou initially wanted to refuse, but seeing Venerable White’s increasingly radiant smile, it immediately surrendered.

—Its instincts as a magical beast warned it that if it continued to argue, the consequences would be dire. It might end up on the moon due to ‘disposable flying sword version 004.’

In the end, Dou Dou flew back to the Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center, tears streaming down its face.

...

...

Meanwhile, at the Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center, Kaithery was anxiously tracking Dou Dou's helicopter on the radar, feeling as if her heart was being scratched by a cat.

At that moment, a voice came through her earpiece, “Kaithery, good news! That little Pekingese is flying the helicopter back!”

The man speaking was an instructor Kaithery had sent out to monitor Dou Dou's flight.

“Great! Keep an eye on it, and make sure nothing goes wrong,” Kaithery sighed in relief.

The other instructors nearby also breathed a sigh of relief.

Someone turned on the TV, casually flipping through a channel to unwind a bit.

The Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center’s television channels were numerous, featuring not only various Chinese stations but also many foreign aviation-related channels, giving instructors a chance to relax while absorbing aviation knowledge.

The channel that this instructor randomly turned on was a foreign aviation news station.

At that moment, a beautiful blonde host was presenting a news story: “According to the latest reports, the Alliance spacecraft has successfully brought back two astronauts from the International Space Station and has successfully returned to Earth’s orbit. Just ten minutes ago, the spacecraft exited the ‘black zone’ and deployed its main parachute, preparing for landing. Let’s welcome our two astronauts back from space—Akuro and Anthony!”

With that, the camera switched to the landing scene.

In the past three years, space aviation technology had rapidly developed and matured.

Astronauts’ landings had become quicker and safer.

Previously, astronauts would take about a day from the time they boarded the return capsule to successfully landing on Earth. Now, that process had been shortened to under two hours, with almost no risk of landing failures.

At the landing site.

“Hello everyone, I’m reporter Barbara. Just now, the Alliance spacecraft’s return capsule has successfully landed. With the help of the staff, the two astronauts are already seated, and both are in good health. Let’s have a close-up interview with our heroes returning from space, starting with—Mr. Akuro!”

Akuro cooperatively opened his spacesuit helmet and waved to the crowd.

Venerable White’s hypnosis had been lifted shortly after entering the return spacecraft.

Although he had lost some of his memories, that didn’t stop Akuro from accepting the cheers and welcoming the honor that belonged to him.

“And now for our other hero—Mr. Anthony!” The applause erupted again, as friends and fans in the crowd shouted Anthony’s name.

However… Anthony still refused to take off his spacesuit helmet!
