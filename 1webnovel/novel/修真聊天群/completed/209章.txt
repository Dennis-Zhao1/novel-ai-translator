Ah~ That familiar scream!

**King Doudou:** “I don’t care! Right now, both Venerable White and Scholar Song have learned to drive and even got their licenses, but I haven't! Doesn’t that make me totally OUT? No way! You have to get me a driver’s license! I want to get in the car and learn to drive! Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, did you hear me?”

**Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain:** “…”

**[System Notification: (＊＊＊＊＊＊) King Doudou has been muted by group leader Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain for 1 day.]**

Doudou huffed arrogantly, “You think muting me will help?”

With a swift swipe of its paw, it navigated to the private chat window: “Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain…”

Group chat is off-limits, but I still have private messages!

Then Doudou continued, “I want to drive! Just agree to it, okay? Please!”

“Stop messing around, how is a Pekingese supposed to learn to drive?” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain replied.

“Rude! Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, you’re bullying a dog!” Doudou retorted angrily, “What’s wrong with being a Pekingese? I have paws to hold the steering wheel! If I grow a bit bigger, I can reach the brakes and the gas pedal! I’ve watched tons of driving theory videos these past few days, and I’ve memorized all the traffic rules! I can do it!”

Scholar Song turned to look at Doudou’s computer screen. With his newly opened eye orifices, his vision was much sharper. He was watching the chat unfold between Doudou and Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

At that moment, an image popped into his mind: a larger-than-life Pekingese sitting in the driver's seat, paws on the steering wheel, driving with utmost seriousness. Its hind legs could even reach the clutch, gas, and brake...

That image was simply too beautiful...

Not to mention, if it actually hit the road, it would scare the daylights out of a whole bunch of people.

The traffic police wouldn’t dare stop it—who would risk their life to pull over a driving dog? Are they out of their minds? What if it ran them over? Who would be responsible?

“Anyway, it’s still a no-go. When you condense your demon core and can transform into a human, then we can talk about learning to drive. Until then, it’s off the table!” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain stated firmly.

“Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain! Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain! Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain!” *23

Doudou began spamming the chat in protest.

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain sent a cold smile emoji: “Keep it up, and I’ll kick you out of the Ninefold Land group. You won’t be able to rejoin!”

“…” Doudou’s paws paused mid-spam.

After a moment, it raised its head at a 45-degree angle, its dog face filled with melancholy and loneliness...

Scholar Song thought Doudou was about to give in.

But then Doudou sighed dramatically, “Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, you’re forcing me to unleash my ultimate move!”

Then, Scholar Song watched as it took a screenshot of the conversation between Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain and itself, then deftly opened the friend list to select a member.

Litchi Fairy—she was the beautiful fairy who loved to take selfies.

Next, Doudou sent a private message: “Sister Litchi!”

Along with a silly smiling emoji.

“Oh, it’s little Doudou! What made you think of messaging me today?” Litchi Fairy replied with a sweet smile, clearly fond of Doudou.

“Um... I came to report! Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain is bullying me, I’m so wronged!” Doudou sent a crying emoji, then forwarded several screenshots of its chat with Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

Doudou’s screenshots looked like this:

**[King Doudou:** “I want to drive! Just agree to it, okay? Please!” Such a gentle tone?  
**Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain:** “Stop messing around, how is a Pekingese supposed to learn to drive?”  
**King Doudou:** “What’s wrong with being a Pekingese? I have paws to hold the steering wheel! If I grow a bit bigger, I can reach the brakes and the gas pedal! I’ve watched tons of driving theory videos these past few days, and I’ve memorized all the traffic rules! I can do it!”  
**Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain:** “No way!”  
**Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain:** “Keep it up, and I’ll kick you out of the Ninefold Land group.” *sends cold laugh emoji*]**

Yes... Doudou wiped out everything where it criticized Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, leaving only the cold responses from Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

Litchi Fairy quickly replied with an ‘angry’ emoji.

Then she messaged Doudou: “How could Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain treat you like that? Doudou, just wait; I’ll stand up for you!”

After saying that, Litchi Fairy logged off!

Doudou continued to gaze at the sky at a 45-degree angle, a mix of melancholy and smugness on its face: “Sigh, when will grievances be settled? Why bother?”

Scholar Song felt his eyes might just go blind at that moment!

Doudou managed to redefine what ‘adorable pet’ meant for him once again.

He vowed never, ever to raise any demon pet in the future! Scholar Song swore to himself.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At this moment, atop the 69th peak of the Endless Demon Sect, **Mo Hou Peak**.

Young Master Hai sat quietly at the edge of the sea of clouds, propping his chin on one hand.

In the sea of clouds below, **Zhengeng** was sweating profusely, diligently practicing the basic sword techniques, honing his body.

As the clouds rolled, **Demon Lord An Zhi** stepped out from the mist.

“Jing Mo has been captured,” Demon Lord An Zhi stated directly after appearing.

Upon hearing this news, Young Master Hai’s expression stiffened: “I remember that when Jing Mo left this time, Master gave him a ‘Blood Escape Great Talismans,’ right?”

That was said to be a top-notch escape technique capable of evading a Sixth-Rank True Monarch; how could the leader of the Jing Mo faction not make it out?

What kind of enemies did he encounter?

A peak Sixth-Rank True Monarch? Or a terrifying Seventh-Rank Spirit Sovereign?

Zhengeng stopped practicing his sword, wiped the sweat off his face, and flew his sword closer to Demon Lord An Zhi: “Did Jing Mo let his guard down and missed the chance to use the ‘Blood Escape Great Talismans’? Or was he forcefully captured?”

“Jing Mo wasn’t careless this time. When he went to deal with that ‘Mountain Pressure,’ he even brought his friend Half-Gourd Daoist with him. At that time, Mountain Pressure was all alone, without any senior cultivators by his side; it was truly a good opportunity to deal with him,” Demon Lord An Zhi sighed.

“Half-Gourd Daoist? Is he the well-known rogue cultivator? That gourd in his hands is quite troublesome,” Zhengeng frowned. He had heard of Half-Gourd Daoist’s reputation back when he was at the Xian Nong Sect. Though Half-Gourd Daoist’s personal strength was mediocre, he had used that gourd to become a top-tier figure among Fourth-Rank cultivators.

“But that Half-Gourd Daoist, even we found troublesome, was directly pinned down by ‘Mountain Pressure’ with a single magical item. His body didn’t even know where it was shot off to,” Demon Lord An Zhi recalled, feeling a wave of fear wash over him.

His avatar hadn’t even seen what magical item ‘Mountain Pressure’ used; all he could see was a ray of light moving at incredible speed! Then, Half-Gourd Daoist was dead.

Demon Lord An Zhi thought to himself that if the Half-Gourd Daoist had been him in that situation, he wouldn’t have much confidence in surviving that magical artifact either.

Young Master Hai squinted, speculating: “I think that magical item shouldn’t be reusable, right? Otherwise, Jing Mo would have used the ‘Blood Escape Great Talismans’ to escape immediately. And that ‘Mountain Pressure’ is just a First-Rank cultivator; being slow to react, he definitely wouldn’t have been able to stop him!”

“Yes, after ‘Mountain Pressure’ used that magical item, he had no power to resist. He took two of Jing Mo’s sword strikes and almost got killed by him. But Jing Mo didn’t expect that ‘Mountain Pressure’ would also possess a magical escape technique that allowed him to move at incredible speed. Even Jing Mo had to unleash everything just to keep up with that escape light. My avatar couldn’t keep up at all, and I could only watch them leave from afar,” Demon Lord An Zhi lamented.

Zhengeng nodded: “It’s not surprising that ‘Mountain Pressure’ has several senior cultivators on his side, so having one or two escape techniques is expected. Ultimately, Jing Mo’s brain wasn’t working well; he didn’t take precautions.”

“What happened next is unclear to me. But not long after... I received definite news that Su Clan’s Aqi captured Jing Mo and took him back to the Tianhe Su Clan’s headquarters,” Demon Lord An Zhi’s lips twitched.

The Tianhe Su Clan was a formidable family, no weaker than the ‘Endless Demon Sect,’ with many methods at their disposal. Now that the leader of the Jing Mo faction has been captured, he might reveal a lot about the ‘Endless Demon Sect.’

Young Master Hai tapped his fingers lightly on his thigh and replied, “No worries; Jing Mo doesn’t know much. The Tianhe Su Clan won’t gain much intel from him… Besides, I’ll contact the division members originally belonging to ‘Jing Mo’ and have them retreat quickly to avoid the Tianhe Su Clan’s retaliation. Brother Aqi’s strength is formidable, comparable to the first among Fifth-Rank fighters; no division can withstand his wrath.”

“If you had known earlier, you shouldn’t have chosen Su Clan’s Aqi,” Demon Lord An Zhi chuckled.

“No... I’m actually quite glad I chose Brother Aqi as my target. He will become a tremendous motivation and catalyst for my growth; in the end, only one of us can survive. With that pressure, I can grow faster!” Young Master Hai laughed, leaping into the sea of clouds to head towards the Endless Demon Sect’s communication array.

“Crazy,” Demon Lord An Zhi muttered to himself.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Another two hours passed.

**Venerable White:** “Zzzzz…”

Beside him were three large boxes of bayberries... The one that Scholar Song brought back was already finished. In the meantime, he flew his sword to the Jiangnan University City’s Luo Xin district and bought back four more boxes of bayberries in one go.

Venerable White stood up and said to Scholar Song, “The flying sword is almost here; follow me to receive it.”

“Alright!” Scholar Song jumped up with excitement.

The auxiliary technique of the **Fundamental Diamond Fist Technique**—**Immovable Diamond Body**.

Just from the name, it sounds pretty rough. But this is a technique that can further strengthen his body and accelerate the opening of his first-grade orifices, something he desperately needs.

Venerable White pointed to the sky, where a faint white light flickered from his fingertip.

Soon, a small black sword appeared in the sky, shooting rapidly towards Venerable White.

Amidst it all...

Scholar Song seemed to hear a scream.

That scream was all too familiar.

This kind of ‘ah ah~ ah ah~’ scream, with a pause after every two screams—was strikingly similar to the time when he was sent by Venerable White, who was in a bad mood, to his grandparent’s house in J City, and let out a similar scream.
