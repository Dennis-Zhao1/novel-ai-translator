**Good Person Scholar Song**

Slowly opening his eyes, Scholar Song suddenly found it impossible to maintain his seated position. With a thud, he lay straight back on the ground.

“Eh? What’s going on? Immortal Sage, I feel completely weak and can’t muster even a little bit of strength,” Scholar Song asked in confusion, unable even to move a finger.

The Alchemical Sage squatted beside him and poked him gently, “This is completely normal. It’s your first time practicing the ‘True Self Meditation Scripture,’ and when you tried to channel the overflowing qi and blood in your body, you lost control a bit. You got a little greedy and ended up channeling too much into your heart’s acupoint. This caused a temporary weakness in your body. Don’t worry, you’ll recover in a few minutes. Just remember next time to leave a little of that overflowing qi and blood to avoid unexpected weakness. This will be better for your body.”

“I see, haha,” Scholar Song replied, lying on the scorching ground of the balcony, feeling fantastic. 

Finally… he had taken the first step into becoming a cultivator.

With a hundred days of foundational training and the help of the Body Refining Elixir, even with his average talent, he should be able to complete foundation building within those hundred days, right?

What kind of abilities would he gain after completing his foundation?

Talismans? Spells? Divine abilities? Earth escape, invisibility, or even the ability to see miles away?

“By the way, Immortal Sage, does my ‘True Self’ just reflect the ordinary me, sitting there with a smile? So does that mean I’m still just an ordinary ‘mortal’ right now?” Scholar Song asked out loud.

“Generally, your True Self is related to your identity and experiences. Since you’ve been exposed to cultivation, your True Self shouldn’t take the form of an ordinary mortal unless deep down, you still don’t believe in the existence of ‘cultivation.’ Or perhaps… hmm, is your ‘True Self’ smiling in a way that’s gentle, a smile that makes people feel comfortable just by looking at it?” The Alchemical Sage pondered before asking.

“Although I feel a bit shy saying this, it really is a smile that makes people feel at ease,” Scholar Song replied. After all, his ‘True Self’ was indeed part of him, and boasting about his own smile felt a tad embarrassing.

The Alchemical Sage exclaimed, “As expected! Young Scholar Song, you are indeed a good person!”

“Eh? Immortal Sage, please don’t casually hand out ‘good person cards’ to others!” Scholar Song protested. He didn’t mind being seen as a good person, but too many of those cards might make it hard for him to find a girlfriend.

“No, I mean that your ‘True Self’ represents that you are a good person, Young Scholar Song!” The Alchemical Sage insisted.

“…” Scholar Song twitched his mouth.

So, the ‘True Self’ could reflect such a state?

“Alright, Young Scholar Song, you’ve now fully grasped the ‘True Self Meditation Scripture’ and the ‘Fundamental Vajra Fist Technique.’ In particular, your execution of the Fundamental Vajra Fist was quite impressive—it almost made me think you’ve been practicing it for years! I don’t have any more pointers for you, so let’s call it a day,” The Alchemical Sage said with a smile.

“Thank you for your guidance, Immortal Sage,” Scholar Song expressed his gratitude.

The Alchemical Sage replied, “No need to be so polite. Also, while I’m still in the Jiangnan area, if you have any questions about your training, feel free to come find me. The Hermit of North River should have told you that if you have problems in your training, don’t get stuck in your own head—ask more and think more.”

After saying this, he added, “Also, regarding the training of the Fundamental Vajra Fist, you should learn to control your ‘degree’ of exertion. If you truly feel exhausted and can’t muster any energy, don’t force yourself to practice the Fundamental Vajra Fist anymore. Even when you recover, don’t push it. After all, the foundational fist technique isn’t for maintaining health; it’s a vigorous body-refining technique. A person’s ‘qi and blood’ is limited, and there’s a cap on how much can recover in a day. Overdoing it can lead to injury.”

“I understand. Besides, in my current state, even if I wanted to practice a bit more, I wouldn’t be able to move,” Scholar Song laughed. He couldn't even budge a single finger.

“Ha, you’re a person with self-discipline, so I don’t need to say much,” The Alchemical Sage smiled. “Now, just lie here and recall the feelings you had while performing the fist technique and meditation. Remembering is also an important part of cultivation.”

“Yes, Immortal Sage,” Scholar Song responded.

The Alchemical Sage looked satisfied, waving goodbye to Scholar Song, “Well then, I’ll take my leave!”

As soon as his words fell, his body transformed into a beam of sword light and vanished with a whoosh from Scholar Song’s sight. Was this what they called the escape of light?

“Wait, Immortal Sage!” Scholar Song struggled to raise his hand, bitterly saying, “Immortal Sage, could you… at least send me back to my dorm?”

He was still lying on the scorching rooftop!

It was around five-thirty, and the sun of June was still shining brightly, radiating warmth and light.

The round sun seemed to be asking Scholar Song, “Hey, lying here like a piece of human steak on the rooftop, do you prefer medium, medium-rare, or well done?”

“Such misfortune!” Scholar Song sighed.

Would he get heatstroke? If he lay here any longer under the sun, he’d turn into ‘Song Steak’ and could be sold by the pound!

At that moment, Scholar Song truly wished for a kind soul to come to the rooftop and lend him a hand; he would be eternally grateful.

“And also, there’s an important matter I forgot about. I haven’t had a chance to ask the Alchemical Sage if there’s a way to find out who’s been investigating me,” Scholar Song grumbled.

But the Alchemical Sage had already vanished, leaving him to wait for their next encounter. If that didn’t work, he could always call later.

After all, he had the Alchemical Sage's phone number, so if anything happened, he could seek help immediately.

……

As Scholar Song pondered, perhaps it was the divine will that heard his silent prayer—a sound of footsteps echoed from the rooftop door.

“Eh? Why is the rooftop door open today?” a lowered male voice came through.

Scholar Song's heart leaped with joy; he was just about to call for help.

At that moment, a female voice chimed in, “Isn’t that just perfect? Phew, let’s head to the rooftop! I’ve never tried it there before. It must be exhilarating!”

“I thought so too, but be careful. It wouldn’t be good if someone saw us,” the male voice replied as he pushed open the rooftop door.

“If someone sees us, isn’t that even more thrilling?” The girl sounded carefree and daring.

Scholar Song immediately closed his mouth, abandoning the thought of asking for help—this was a couple enjoying some romance, and he couldn’t help but feel a mix of envy and jealousy.

This pair of daring youths should have been burned by the FFF group, opting for the other side of the rooftop. They hadn’t noticed that a certain Scholar Song was lying like a corpse on the ground over there.

After choosing their spot, the couple began their own martial arts duel.

Scholar Song sighed, closing his eyes to slowly regain his strength. He could still hear the sounds of the two skilled fighters battling it out.

After a while, the feeling of weakness finally faded.

He struggled to get up from the ground, his limbs still weak as he slowly made his way toward the rooftop door.

“By the way, didn’t that female classmate say something about how it would be thrilling if someone saw us?” Scholar Song muttered to himself, rubbing his chin thoughtfully.

He felt it was necessary to fulfill her wish.

Because his ‘True Self’ told him that the man named Scholar Song was a helpful person!

After all, it was just a small effort, so why not help this classmate achieve her wish?

“There’s no helping it; who told me I’m a good person?” Scholar Song said while supporting himself against the wall of the rooftop, peeking his head out to glance at the other side of the rooftop.
