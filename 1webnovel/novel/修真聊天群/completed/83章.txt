**Illusion?**

Scholar Song held the little girl close, carefully setting her parents aside before redirecting his gaze toward the towering monk. 

He could sense it— as the monk recited his scriptures, a powerful mental force began to surge and swell, crashing outwards like waves against the shore.

In the air, there was negative energy swirling around the carriage, invisible to ordinary people. Yet, as it encountered the monk's tumultuous mental energy, it dispersed rapidly, fleeing like frightened birds through the shattered windows and out into the next carriage.

A thought sparked in Scholar Song's mind—could it be 'ghosts'?

Having completed his foundational cultivation, he had yet to open his eye of insight, leaving him unable to see the spirits directly. However, in a heightened state of vigilance, he could faintly sense the smoky, negative energies around him.

Typically, ghostly entities would avoid crowded places like subways or buses, where the vibrant life force of humans coalesced vigorously. This robust and abundant life energy was a powerful force that could scatter weaker spirits, and even strong ghosts would shy away from such intensely populated areas.

However, when a disaster strikes amidst a dense crowd, it creates a unique situation. The sudden surge of terror, death, despair, and resentment—these potent negative emotions are like a feast for ghosts, nurturing their growth. Especially in places where lives have been lost tragically, the souls of the deceased become a source of strength for these entities, allowing them to grow even more formidable.

Some powerful ghosts could even forcibly snatch the souls of those gravely injured and on the brink of death, as these souls could significantly enhance a ghost's power!

“Chimera spirits, be gone!” the monk shouted, evidently no novice in this realm. His loud voice reverberated, and the negative energy in the carriage dissipated almost instantaneously.

In an instant, the previously cursing passengers went silent, stunned. As the monk's voice faded, the carriage was suddenly bright again. The shattered glass, the blood that had stained the walls, and the injured passengers had all vanished without a trace.

Though the train had tilted dangerously, no one was bloodied anymore.

“Was that... an illusion?” all the passengers stared blankly, completely bewildered.

Indeed, all those gory, horrifying images had been mere phantoms conjured by the ghosts, designed to instill fear and dread, generating even more despairing negative energy within the carriage.

As the ghosts scattered, the capable monk was not satisfied with this outcome.

“Shit!” he cursed again, seizing his prayer beads and hastening toward the front of the carriage in pursuit of the fleeing spirits.

The train, after slamming to an emergency halt and sounding alarms, activated the independent switches for each carriage door. Pulling the manual switch on the door would allow access to the next compartment.

The monk skillfully pulled the switch and dashed toward the carriage where the spirits had fled.

His presence in the subway was no coincidence; he had been tracking these ghosts, attempting to purify them.

Scholar Song reached into his pocket, where he kept a talisman for dispelling evil, a protection talisman, and a sword talisman.

These three talismans were kept close at hand for emergencies.

He silently hoped he wouldn’t have to use them, as his supply was limited, and every wasted talisman would decrease his odds of survival before confronting the jar master.

Wait!

A thought flickered through Scholar Song’s mind.

Could the ghosts in this subway be connected to that jar master?

After all, the jar master was also a practitioner of the dark arts and was currently hiding in the nearby “Round and Round Apothecary,” only a few subway stations away! Was it really just a coincidence?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At that moment, in the third carriage behind Scholar Song, two pale-faced men huddled together, whispering.

“Damn it, how did that monk catch up again? We thought we’d put some distance between us!” one of the men, dressed in a business casual outfit, gritted his teeth.

The other, dressed in a plain T-shirt, rubbed his temples, looking weary. “It’s been two days without feeding ‘Ku You’ properly. If we don’t feed it today, the jar master will turn us into its food tonight.”

At this, both men shuddered.

‘Ku You’ was the vengeful spirit that roamed the subway, reportedly a low-level ghost general that the jar master had painstakingly cultivated from the battlefield decades prior, comparable in strength to a second-tier practitioner. The jar master had nurtured it for years and it was one of the jar master’s most powerful vengeful spirits.

Under normal circumstances, vengeful spirits would be sealed away in ghostly areas, nourished by the ambient ghost energy while minimizing their consumption. However, over time, they would weaken.

Thus, whenever the jar master brought a vengeful spirit along, he needed to find 'food' nearby to replenish the spirit’s energy to restore its strength.

The two men were responsible for ensuring ‘Ku You’ stayed fed and typically sought out disaster sites or graveyards to provide the necessary sustenance.

Yesterday, while they were at a cemetery allowing ‘Ku You’ to feed, they unexpectedly encountered the imposing monk. If they hadn’t fled quickly, the weakened ‘Ku You’ might have been purified by him—just the thought sent chills down their spines.

If ‘Ku You’ had been purified, they would have had no choice but to take their own lives, as that would be a more pleasant way to die!

Finally, after managing to escape a considerable distance, they found this long, branching subway, manipulating the ghostly illusion to confuse the train operators and orchestrating an emergency stop, aiming to create a disaster scene for ‘Ku You’ to feast upon.

However, they never anticipated that the monk would follow them all the way!

What did we do to deserve this? Couldn’t you just let us off the hook?

“Right now, we can only fight back,” the business casual man set his jaw.

If they failed to fill the vengeful spirit’s belly again today, the jar master would punish them brutally, turning them into ‘delicious’ offerings in the eyes of the spirit. With death inevitable, fighting back was their only chance of survival!

“All we need to do is hold that monk off long enough for ‘Ku You’ to absorb enough energy to recover. After that, the monk won’t stand a chance!” the other ordinary-looking man gritted his teeth.

With that resolve, the two men stood up, heading toward the front carriage.

In the chaos of the subway’s various compartments, their frantic figures were hard to miss.

They soon passed through the carriage where Scholar Song was seated. Unfortunately, they didn’t notice Scholar Song, who was masked under a shroud of mental vigilance.

Their powers were weak, still in the ‘Hundred-Day Foundation’ stage. And due to the poor quality of their foundational techniques, coupled with the lack of body refinement liquid and their advanced ages, they had been stuck in this foundation stage for many years without completion.

Controlling the ghost general ‘Ku You’ relied solely on a temporary talisman given by the jar master.

The two men rushed past Scholar Song’s carriage, chasing after the monk’s figure.

Once they were far away, Scholar Song opened his eyes. “Another pair of practitioners.”

Moreover, the two men who had just rushed by exuded a vitality far exceeding that of ordinary people, and their connection to the ghostly entity was evident, as they were tainted with the same negative energies.

Who would have thought that after holding the little girl for three subway stops, such chaos would ensue?

Should I go see what’s happening up ahead?

Scholar Song pondered silently.

…

…

On the other side, the towering monk had already caught up with the vengeful spirit.

The spirit had absorbed a significant amount of negative energy, regaining some of its strength. Now, it utilized its illusionary abilities to envelop the first three carriages, conjuring terrifying phantoms to heighten the fear and despair of the passengers inside.

It only needed to recover a bit more power before it could use these illusions to drive the passengers into despair, pushing the weaker-willed individuals to suicide to feast on their souls!

“I found you!” the bald monk beamed a radiant smile, revealing a set of bright white teeth. “Don’t run anymore! I have achieved the Eye of Heaven (eye insight), and under its gaze, no ghost can escape. Let me purify you!”

With that, he pulled a Buddhist scripture from his robes and began to chant its contents loudly, his powerful voice echoing throughout the carriage. The precision of his enunciation was remarkable, even impressing many of the local people from the Middle Land.
