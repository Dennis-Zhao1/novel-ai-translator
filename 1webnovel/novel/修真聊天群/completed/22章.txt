**An Unexpected Gift**

From Fay Yu's perspective:

Just as the two Phantom Spirits lunged at Scholar Song with menacing intent, he remained completely unfazed. With a calm demeanor, he bent down to pick up his phone and then pulled out a poisonous dragon grass.

The poise of the Venerable White was remarkable, as if the two fierce Phantom Spirits charging at him were nothing more than insignificant debris!

The poisonous dragon grass wasn’t a rare herb, but it was clearly not wild; instead, it had been purposely cultivated long ago! It served as the key to the formation.

Once it was removed, an invisible protective barrier of formation unfolded around them.

The two Phantom Spirits, intent on attacking Scholar Song, collided with this unseen barrier, much like flies hitting an electric fence—there was a loud crackle before they fell to the ground, unable to rise again. They had clearly lost all capacity to resist.

“Wow... that’s amazing!” Fay Yu marveled inwardly.

She was in awe of Scholar Song's keen eyes!

Despite having spent half a day setting things up here, she hadn't realized that there was still a hidden formation in place! When had Scholar Song discovered it?

That piece of poisonous dragon grass acted as a powerful formation’s key. Unlike ordinary keys that merely provided formation capabilities, this one was like a switch—once it was pulled out, the formation would activate!

This must have been set up by her father over sixty years ago.

It seemed her father had established two layers of sealing formations at Ghost Lantern Temple. The first was a simple binding formation that restricted the movements of the Phantom Spirits, set within the temple itself, which had become ineffective as the temple was dismantled.

However, the second layer was a powerful sealing formation that remained hidden under normal circumstances. But as soon as the dragon grass was drawn out, it would activate, intended for subduing the Phantom Spirits. Once this formation was triggered, the Phantom Spirits within Ghost Lantern Temple would be subdued and sealed!

Scholar Song must have noticed this second formation as soon as he arrived, casually sitting beside the formation’s key, prepared for any unexpected developments.

Truly, he was a senior I still had so much to learn from!

Fay Yu thought this as she swiftly charged forward, stepping on the two weakened Phantom Spirits.

Then, she retrieved two gleaming beads, radiating a chilling aura, from her large box.

These were the ‘Soul-Sealing Ice Pearls,’ treasures used for sealing Phantom Spirits. Once a spirit was trapped within, she could set up the relevant contract formation and bind the spirit to her!

To prevent any accidents during her sealing process, Fay Yu had brought several ‘Soul-Sealing Ice Pearls’ with her.

She pinched the two pearls between her fingers and quickly formed several hand seals with both hands.

“Seal!” she exclaimed lightly.

The two severely injured Phantom Spirits had no power to resist and were sealed within the two Soul-Sealing Ice Pearls!

……

……

Scholar Song watched in wide-eyed awe as the two azure light orbs that had danced around Fay Yu were drawn into the pearls.

This scene was utterly surreal!

No amount of scientific knowledge could explain what was unfolding before him.

He swallowed hard, as at that moment, the worldview he had built over eighteen years crumbled significantly—perhaps, there really were supernatural beings in this world?

Such inexplicable phenomena, which couldn't be perfectly explained by science, might indeed exist in a special form among humans, woven into folklore and tales?

“Senior, I can’t thank you enough! If it weren’t for your help, those two Phantom Spirits would have escaped. If they got away, they wouldn’t return here, and finding them next time would be a real hassle,” Fay Yu expressed her heartfelt gratitude.

“Haha.” Scholar Song laughed awkwardly, unsure of what else to say at that moment.

“Senior, since there are exactly two Phantom Spirits, I only need one. The other one is a gift for you! Although with your cultivation level, you might not need it, you could give it to your descendants or disciples.” Fay Yu was generous, offering a mid-tier Phantom Spirit, worth a fortune, without a second thought, extending her hand towards Scholar Song.

I don’t even have a girlfriend, where would descendants come from?

“This is far too precious; I can’t accept it!” Scholar Song insisted earnestly—how could he accept this? There was a ghost inside that ice pearl! Although he was still somewhat skeptical, what if it was a real ghost?

What if that ghost came out? What would he do? He was just an ordinary person, without any means to deal with spirits, and he’d surely be drained of his essence and perish!

He definitely could not accept this!

“Please, you must take it! You’ve helped me so much on this trip to Ghost Lantern Temple! If you don’t accept this Phantom Spirit, I won’t feel at ease, and it could affect my future cultivation!” Fay Yu also spoke earnestly, forcefully pressing a ‘Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl’ into Scholar Song’s hand, leaving him no room to refuse.

Scholar Song felt the coolness of the pearl in his hand; in the sweltering heat, it made him feel refreshingly cool all over—this thing was like carrying an air conditioner in summer!

“Let’s go back,” Fay Yu said with a bright smile, quickly packing up the items she had set up near the graveyard into her suitcase, cheerfully walking over to Scholar Song.

Scholar Song could only stuff the ‘Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl’ into his pocket; since it was Fay Yu’s kind intention, he accepted it! Besides, it had already been sealed, so it shouldn’t come out for a while, right?

That was what he thought.

“Let’s go take a nap, and tomorrow morning we’ll check the train tickets at the station to prepare for our return,” Scholar Song suggested.

“Okay.” With their objective successfully achieved, Fay Yu was in great spirits.

The two walked side by side, exiting the small grove.

“Oops.” Fay Yu suddenly exclaimed, looking down at her right foot. She noticed that her shoe had come apart, and the sole had fallen off.

It must have happened when she had sprinted after the two Phantom Spirits.

Scholar Song turned in confusion, “Hmm?”

“My shoe broke,” Fay Yu raised her right leg. The sole was missing, revealing her delicate foot, with her translucent toes adorably wiggling.

“I’ll help you. The motorcycle is just ahead. Also, I remember there’s a shopping street near the hotel. Let’s check if they have any shoes there,” Scholar Song chuckled.

Moments later, the motorcycle roared to life again, carrying the two away from the Ghost Lantern Temple graveyard.

Fay Yu leaned back against Scholar Song, supporting her large travel suitcase, a smile dancing on her lips, in a splendid mood.

……

……

Scholar Song felt that the lady selling sandals in the shopping street was quite an aloof woman.

“Ma’am, how much for this pair of women’s sandals?” he asked.

The lady frowned slightly and replied coldly, “Forty.”

“Too expensive, how about twenty?” Scholar Song boldly haggled. In such a shopping street, cutting the price in half was definitely the way to go.

“Fine.” The lady smirked coldly, “Do you want the left one or the right one?”

Scholar Song: “…”

“Hahaha.” Fay Yu laughed until she could hardly stand.

In the end, Scholar Song had no choice but to pay the forty for the pair of women’s sandals, which Fay Yu changed into.

They got back on the motorcycle and headed toward the hotel.

On the way, Scholar Song curiously asked, “By the way, did I offend that lady? Why do I feel like she’s always sneering at me? It gives me chills down my spine.”

“What do you think?” Fay Yu giggled.

Senior, your worldly experience is still lacking! she thought to herself.

In the shopping street, the lady huffed, “I’m only twenty-nine years and 144 months old! How dare you call me ‘ma’am’? I should have charged you two hundred fifty for not buying anything from me. Hmph!”

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Ghost Lantern Temple Graveyard.

After Scholar Song and Fay Yu left, a figure emerged from the woods. He sighed, pulled out a cigarette, trembling as he lit it, a bitter smile on his face—his smile was so full of sorrow that even a hundred miles away, one could still feel its bitterness.

The figure was the strange altar master, who had been lurking in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity. But in the end, the “opportunity” he sought never appeared, and he found himself unable to act.

From start to finish, he had merely been a spectator, watching helplessly as Fay Yu and Scholar Song took away the Phantom Spirits. 

He had considered forcing a move to seize the spirits, but he didn’t dare to take action.
