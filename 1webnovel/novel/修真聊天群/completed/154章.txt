**Chapter Title: The Unlikely Rescue**

“Dou Dou + Venerable White!”

The woman's voice was filled with anger.

Soon after, a burly man in a suit pushed a wheelchair into the small courtyard of the young master Yi Gu.

In the wheelchair sat a girl who looked around seventeen or eighteen. Her long hair fell loosely around her shoulders, and her pair of jet-black eyes sparkled with clarity and brightness.

Her skin was pale—however, it was the kind of pallor that came from long-term illness.

The girl’s legs were perfectly fine; the reason she needed to sit in a wheelchair was due to a peculiar ailment. At a fixed time each day, she would become incredibly weak, to the extent that she couldn’t even move a finger, resembling a patient in a vegetative state.

Her family had taken her to see many doctors, traveling across the world to consult renowned physicians, but no one could diagnose her condition, let alone treat it.

Previously, the young master Yi Gu had gone to the nameless temple to pray for his sister's health. However, he ended up being captivated by the statue of the nameless immortal, completely derailing his original purpose.

Upon seeing his furious sister, Yi Gu suddenly felt his mind clear.

“Return this statue to the temple and apologize to them!” The girl, though weak, spoke with the authority of a lioness.

In contrast, Yi Gu seemed like a shy little bee, his head bowed in silence. After a moment, he managed to squeeze out a few words: “Can’t we just not return it? At most…I’ll compensate them with a new statue!”

“Brother, are you trying to drive me to my grave?!” The girl slammed her palms against the wheelchair’s armrests and scolded, “Either return the statue right now, or I’ll turn you into a statue to send back; you choose!”

Yet even in her fury, her voice retained a soft, sweet quality that was reminiscent of cotton candy, making anyone who heard it feel their heart melt.

At this moment, Scholar Song was completely ignored by the bickering siblings.

Dou Dou turned to glance at the girl before continuing to pant and blow bubbles.

Scholar Song observed the peculiar siblings, feeling as though their roles were reversed. The sister was commanding and powerful, akin to an elder sister, while the brother shrank back like a younger sibling caught in a mistake.

An interesting pair of siblings, indeed.

“A few days from now, I’ll return the statue?” Yi Gu gritted his teeth and said—worst case, he could pay someone to carve a similar statue to replace it!

“Right now! Immediately! Return the statue!” The sister’s resolve weakened as she leaned back against the wheelchair, exhaustion overtaking her once more.

…

…

Dou Dou wagged its tail and suddenly said, “Scholar Song, let’s take Venerable White’s statue and leave. Woof~”

“Okay,” Scholar Song replied.

“By the way…Scholar, before we go, do you want to create a good connection?” Dou Dou asked suddenly, its paws scrambling across the ground.

“A good connection? What do you mean?” Scholar Song questioned, confused.

Dou Dou looked serious and said, “You have body refinement liquid with you, right? The kind you made that has lower potency.”

“I do.”

“Before we leave, take a tiny drop—the size of your pinky nail. Then, let that little girl open her mouth and flick it in.” Dou Dou instructed.

“And then?”

“Then, you’ll have created a good connection with her. Trust me, this is a huge good fortune!” Dou Dou assured him with a serious expression.

“Won’t it harm her? When taking ‘body refinement liquid,’ doesn’t one need sufficient vitality? The girl looks pretty weak. Can she handle the potion?” Scholar Song asked, concerned.

“That’s exactly why it’s a good connection. Trust me!” Dou Dou insisted.

Scholar Song scrutinized Dou Dou for a moment, then chuckled, “Alright, I’ll listen to you. Let’s just say I’m banking on some good karma recently.”

…

…

Scholar Song lightly clapped his hands, interrupting the siblings' standoff: “Sorry, but I don’t have much time. I need to take my friend and leave.”

“Dream on! I won’t let you take the statue!” Yi Gu rushed forward and hugged the statue tightly. “Someone, come here! Throw this lunatic out!”

But before he could finish shouting, he suddenly slumped down—beside him, Dou Dou had disdainfully retracted its paw after giving Yi Gu a gentle flick, rendering him unconscious.

“Who are you?” The sister frowned, staring at Scholar Song. Behind her, the man in the suit reached into his coat, his posture suggesting he was retrieving a weapon.

Then… the suited man collapsed as well.

Dou Dou once again pulled back its paw, invisible to ordinary humans, allowing it to knock out others without a hint of hesitation.

In an instant, only Scholar Song, the young girl, and Dou Dou remained in the small courtyard.

“Don’t be nervous; I just put your brother to sleep for a while. He’ll be fine when he wakes up.” Scholar Song smiled—unfortunately, due to his mask, no one could see his kind expression.

“I’ll take the statue back first; it doesn’t belong to you. Before I leave, I’d like to give you a gift.” Scholar Song approached the statue, lifting it effortlessly.

The heavy statue was easily hoisted onto his shoulder!

The girl’s eyes widened—this masked figure, who didn’t seem strong, could lift the heavy sculpture so effortlessly. A hint of envy flickered in her gaze. To possess such strength was beyond her reach; even just living like an ordinary girl would be a dream come true for her.

While she was lost in thought, Scholar Song suddenly turned and called, “Open your mouth!”

Without thinking, the girl complied and opened her mouth.

Scholar Song seized the opportunity, flicking his finger to drop a droplet of ‘body refinement liquid’ into her mouth. She didn’t even need to swallow; the liquid slid down her throat.

“Creating a good connection with you, and also fulfilling your brother’s wish,” Scholar Song said, then leapt gracefully into the air. “Dou Dou, let’s go!”

Initially, Scholar Song had hoped Dou Dou would cooperate, catching him as he leapt high before they escaped together.

However, Dou Dou was clearly not a team player. It curiously watched Scholar Song jump, utterly bewildered by what he was trying to achieve.

As a result, Scholar Song landed awkwardly.

“Let’s go!” he grit his teeth again, shouldering the statue as he leaped over the courtyard wall, not looking back as he departed…

Dou Dou blinked and, after Scholar Song had run far away, it stealthily gave the girl a light pat.

Then, it chased after Scholar Song’s figure.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile, the girl, stunned for a moment, quickly reached for her mouth—wanting to spit out whatever that masked man had made her swallow.

Who knew what that masked man had injected into her? It felt like the substance she swallowed had a distinctly unpleasant taste.

But just then, she felt a burning sensation in her throat, as if it were being scorched—was it poison?

However, this burning sensation lasted only about two seconds. Following that, the heat transformed into a warm flow that spread into her lower abdomen. From there, it surged through every corner of her body, making her involuntarily moan in pleasure.

The warm flow lasted for quite a while.

Finally, she burped twice. With those two burps, she felt as if every organ in her body had been cleansed, feeling refreshingly clear. Each breath was as refreshing as inhaling morning air in a forest.

But none of that was the most important part; the most important thing was that she pushed against the wheelchair and effortlessly stood up.

The strange “weakness” that had plagued her was entirely gone, and she felt an overwhelming surge of energy coursing through her body!

“A good connection,” she quietly clenched her small fist.

A connection?

…

…

At this moment, chaos erupted in the lavish mansion of the Yi Gu family.

Security members searched the house for the masked intruder, but they found nothing. The lunatic seemed to have vanished into thin air.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Dou Dou flew with Scholar Song and Venerable White’s statue to a remote mountainous area in Nanhua Lake City.

They didn’t return directly to Jiangnan University Town because they had to wait for Venerable White to finish his cultivation before the statue could break free from the layer encasing him—the immortal had mentioned that when he emerged, the commotion would be significant, and creating chaos in Jiangnan University Town was not an option.

Scholar Song set Venerable White down and asked, “Dou Dou, have all traces from the mansion been erased?”

Now that technology was so advanced, even a small fingerprint could potentially be traced with enough financial backing.

“Don’t worry, I’ve used magic to clean up all traces. However… if they really want to find you, they can still do so. You didn’t disguise yourself when entering Lin Yao Village, and if they throw money at it, it’s just a matter of time before they find you,” Dou Dou chuckled.

“It’s fine… I trust you can handle it, especially since we’ve created a good connection with that girl,” Scholar Song laughed.

Dou Dou’s canine face twitched.

Scholar Song placed Venerable White’s statue down and took out his phone, waving Dou Dou over: “Come, let’s take a group photo.”

After all the trouble to rescue Venerable White, he wanted to document the moment to share with the group—plus, it’d show Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain the fruits of their labor, which might earn them some extra rewards for completing the task.

Dou Dou complied eagerly, posing beside Scholar Song for a photo with the statue.

Scholar Song uploaded the picture to the ‘Ninefold Land Group’—with the title: “After many twists and turns, I finally managed to bring Venerable White out.”

He attached the photo of himself, Dou Dou, and the statue of Venerable White.

As soon as the photo was posted, the group’s elders reacted immediately, showering it with likes. Were they all watching ‘Ninefold Land Group’?

A flurry of comments followed.

Master of Seven Lives: “Scholar Song, you’ve worked hard! By the way… I only see you and Dou Dou; where’s Venerable White?”

The Alchemical Sage: “Where’s Venerable White?”

The Dharma King of Creation: “Same question, where’s the immortal?”

Wandering Monk Tong Xuan: “?”

At that moment, the Dharma King of Creation quickly replied: “Wait a second, that statue, could it be Venerable White?”

Master of Seven Lives: “It really is Venerable White! How did he turn into a statue?”

Master of Snow Wolf Cavern: “Venerable White is always finding ways to surprise us… Scholar Song, you’ve worked hard! Dou Dou + Venerable White!”

Master of Seven Lives: “Right? It’s Dou Dou + Venerable White!”

The Alchemical Sage: “Dou Dou + Venerable White!”

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain: “Scholar Song, keep it up!”

The photo stirred many lurking elders out of their silence.

Scholar Song silently turned off his phone and looked over at Dou Dou.

Seeing Scholar Song’s expression, Dou Dou understood: “Are the idiots in the group talking bad about me again?”

“No," Scholar Song replied nonchalantly. “They’re just comparing you to Venerable White.”

Dou Dou: “…”

Time ticked by, and finally, Venerable White’s cultivation period came to an end!
