**Scholar Song, let's go play at the East Sea!**

Zhuge Zhongyang continued with a smug grin, "And I've already mapped out the whole itinerary! First, we'll take a plane to that big island in the East Sea and spend a whole day there. I've even booked a luxury cruise for five days! I've secured spots for you and your friends, so let’s set off together! Young man, let's have a blast!"

Come on, you're going for a matchmaker's blind date, not a vacation… Priorities, man! Gao Moumou silently complained.

At the same time, he looked up at the sky—he couldn’t even escape the clutches of Zhuge Yue and Zhuge Zhongyang when changing his phone. What kind of karma did he accumulate in his past life to end up tangled with these two gems in this one?

Buddhism says that if you glance back at someone five hundred years ago, you might only brush past them in this life!

So, five hundred years ago, he must have been a thousand degrees near-sighted, glancing back at these two fantastic individuals hundreds of times, resulting in this karmic bond in this life.

Absolutely not! He could not accompany these two on a trip to the East Sea; otherwise, his honeymoon plans with his girlfriend, Mei Yi, would be completely ruined.

So, a firm refusal! He needed to deny them without giving them a chance, cutting off any escape routes!

"It’s not happening. I won’t go with you guys. Give it up!" Gao Moumou said coldly. "Mei Yi and I already have our summer vacation plans set in stone; there’s no way I’m changing them!"

After his stern refusal, Gao Moumou shifted his tone and quickly began to sell out his buddies, "But… I can help you get in touch with Scholar Song and Tu Bo. They can accompany you two on the trip. You know them; they’re my roommates, and they’re really nice!"

"No way! If you don’t come with me, I’ll be on edge," Zhuge Zhongyang replied. "After all, you’re my only friend in the Middle Land! This is about my lifelong happiness; you have to help me!"

"Not a chance! You’d better give up on that thought! If you keep pestering me, I won’t even inform Scholar Song and Tu Bo, and you can go crazy in the East Sea with Miss Lu all by yourself!" Gao Moumou threatened in a low voice.

"Ugh… Why so serious? We’re all from the same root, why rush to harm each other?" Zhuge Zhongyang sighed heavily, then snapped his fingers.

Zhuge Yue leaned in with her pretty face, and then she opened her phone to play a recording.

First came Zhuge Yue’s voice: "Let me give you a kiss, the French wet kiss kind!"

"Sorry, I refuse. I’m not into that, and I already have a girlfriend. Please find something else to practice on, like a pillow or a post, whatever you like!" Gao Moumou's voice echoed back.

Zhuge Yue paused and smiled at Gao Moumou.

Hearing this dialogue, Gao Moumou’s face turned pale. "Why, why do you have a recording of that!"

He reached out to grab Zhuge Yue's phone.

Zhuge Yue nimbly dodged and calmly pressed play again.

[“So absolutely not, you better give up on that thought! Hey, wait, what are you doing? Mmm!” Gao Moumou's voice came through, followed by the sound of kissing.] 

Zhuge Yue then explained, "I actually wanted to record a video to study how to kiss… But I didn’t expect to only record audio; it's such a failure."

Damn, did you even want to record a video? What if it leaks? Someone would die!

"Delete it! You better delete every single bit of it and format your phone’s memory right now!" Gao Moumou growled, lowering his voice.

"Hehehe, but this is important research data, how can I delete it so easily?" Zhuge Yue grinned triumphantly.

"You two little devils!" Gao Moumou grit his teeth.

"Hehehe." Zhuge Yue flashed a cute smile.

"Let’s make a deal," Zhuge Zhongyang styled his hair and struck a handsome pose. "You go with me to the East Sea, and I’ll make sure Zhuge Yue deletes that recording and all copies of it. What do you say?"

Gao Moumou felt like crying: "Damn it, why do I have to go with you?"

"Because you're my dog-headed military advisor!" Zhuge Zhongyang tossed his hair back.

Gao Moumou felt like he might as well be dead—what kind of karma had he accumulated five hundred years ago? He must have been completely blind to end up tangled with these two gems.

Zhuge Zhongyang switched to another handsome pose. "So, what’s it going to be, deal or no deal?"

"Deal!" Gao Moumou gritted his teeth.

Resigned, he began to pull out his phone to make calls—there was no way he wouldn’t drag a few companions down with him in this tragic fate. 

Scholar Song, Tu Bo, Yang De, whoever it was, he had to bring two along to share in the misery. A good bro doesn’t ask for a birth on the same day, but at least hopes for a death on the same day!

Gao Moumou dialed Scholar Song's number.

Soon, the call connected: "Hello, who is this?"

Gao Moumou had changed his number.

"It’s me, Gao Moumou!" he replied.

"Gao Moumou, what’s up?" Scholar Song asked, and he could faintly hear a melodious girl’s laughter in the background.

How to describe that laughter? It was simply a healing sound! Hearing it lifted Gao Moumou’s spirits considerably. He mentally rated that sound—second only to his girlfriend Mei Yi’s laughter.

"Well, before the break, I mentioned to you guys that Zhuge Zhongyang wants to take our classmate Lu Fei’s sister to the East Sea, right? Well, now he’s booked the plane tickets and has set everything up for us. Do you have time to join us for some fun at the East Sea?" Gao Moumou tried to soften his tone, luring like the wolf grandmother enticing Little Red Riding Hood.

"Huh? Didn’t you say you were going to spend time alone with Mei Yi?" Scholar Song asked curiously.

"Ugh, it’s just that Zhuge Zhongyang is so persistent, and the East Sea is beautiful! It’ll be fun, and it’s the perfect chance to take Mei Yi. Plus, it won’t cost us anything—food, drinks, accommodation, all covered!" Gao Moumou lied through his teeth.

"Oh, really? When are we going?" Scholar Song inquired—he was free anyway.

As he spoke, his gaze drifted toward Fay Yu. Yep, Fay Yu was a good girl.

Then his eyes landed on Venerable White on the bed, and he recalled Dou Dou and the little monk who had ‘run away from home.’

It was safer to bring those three along for a trip.

Gao Moumou eagerly asked, "We’re leaving in two days. Are you in?"

Two days? Just in time for Venerable White to wake up and for Dou Dou and Guoguo to return. The timing was perfect.

"Sure, sounds good." Scholar Song asked, "Can I bring someone along?"

"Absolutely! The more, the merrier! I’d be happy with ten or eight! A few dozen or even hundreds would be great!" Gao Moumou burst into laughter—he hoped to bring a whole crowd to drain Zhuge Zhongyang’s wallet.

"Haha, maybe just a few. I need to check with them first. I’ll call you back once I confirm," Scholar Song replied.

"Good bro, remember to bring as many people as you can! Talk soon!" Gao Moumou laughed as he hung up.

Then he took a deep breath, drafted a mental outline, and called Tu Bo.

"Hey, Tu Bo, it’s me, Gao Moumou! I’ve got a fun place for you to check out! Yes, that resort island in the East River that Zhuge Zhongyang mentioned! Want to join us for some fun? Hehe, there’s a luxury cruise for five days too! What do you think? Don’t think, just pack your bags; I’ll pick you up in two days!"

---

Scholar Song hung up the call.

Fay Yu was still lying on the edge of the bed, occasionally bursting into delightful laughter.

Scholar Song: "…"

This girl had a ridiculously low tolerance for humor!

He suspected that if he just told her a couple of jokes, she’d laugh until she couldn’t stand. A few funny stories and she might even laugh herself into a fit…

"Fay Yu, my friend is organizing a trip to the East Sea. Do you want to join us?" Scholar Song asked.

Fay Yu finally managed to stop laughing, her expression one of regret. "As much as I’d love to, I can’t. I have to head over to my friend’s family estate tonight to see if there’s anything I can help with… But hey, keep your phone on! If I finish up early and have time, I’ll come find you!"

"Oh, and take this!" Fay Yu said, pulling a silver bracelet from her small waist pouch.

"?" Scholar Song received the bracelet, puzzled—this looked like something a girl would wear. A big man like him wearing this?

"This is the coordinate for the ‘Thousand Mile Escape Technique’! My father prepared it for me since I can’t fly with a sword yet, and traveling is a hassle. With this coordinate, I can use the treasure to teleport directly to that location. There’s one at Lingdie Island, one with my father, and this one is for you to keep. If I finish things up early, I can directly teleport over to you using the ‘Thousand Mile Escape Technique’," Fay Yu said with a smile.

"Thousand Mile Escape Technique? Teleport?" Scholar Song felt like he had heard this magic spell before.

It didn’t take long before he remembered where.

[Magical girl in a sailor suit, ‘Moon Prism Power, make up’!]

Oh no, not the embarrassing imagery again—this Thousand Mile Escape Technique was the lifesaving spell that Venerable White had given him.

He had used it to escape from the pursuit of the Wuji Demon Sect’s Captain Jing Mo and ended up right beside Venerable White. Along the way, he had also been spinning around with the ‘Cold Flame Sword’ behind him for half a day.

But wasn’t this spell meant for emergencies?

In Fay Yu’s eyes, it had turned into a means of travel…
