**Beseeching the Senior for Mercy**

In the midst of everyone's gaze, the classroom door swung open, revealing a tall, skinny man standing in the doorway, his hand outstretched as if he were pushing the door open.

The man stood over six feet tall, with hair that exploded upwards like a wild mane, a hairstyle that would be considered exceptional even among the most radical styles. 

His eyes bore heavy dark circles that resembled panda eyes—was that what they called smoky makeup? It had been all the rage years ago, especially when a stunning world-class actress made it her signature look.

Every student in the classroom was fixated on this man, their eyes wide and unblinking.

Suddenly thrust into the spotlight, the man awkwardly scratched his head and smiled, "Sorry to interrupt your class!"

"Who are you?" Professor Smith's chalk snapped in his grip, his frustration palpable. The situation was escalating quickly!

"Western dude?" the tall man waved his hand dismissively. "Just stay put, I’m only looking for someone and will be out of your hair soon. I won’t take too long."

The muscles in Professor Smith's forehead tensed as he prepared to give the intruder a piece of his mind. 

However, as the tall man waved his hand again, Professor Smith suddenly found himself unable to move, as if he had been solidified in place. Not only could he not shift his position, but even his mouth and tongue were rendered immobile. He couldn’t even blink! Eventually, even his thoughts began to freeze.

The tall man scanned the classroom, seemingly searching for someone.

All the students were left dumbstruck, staring at him.

Only Scholar Song, amidst it all, felt an ominous premonition. The door had burst open with such force that the lock had exploded; this was no ordinary person.

At the very least, this guy had to be a cultivator who had consumed body-enhancing potions to achieve such strength.

Could he be an Alchemical Sage?

Scholar Song quickly shook his head.

No way! It couldn’t be! The Alchemical Sages from the Ninefold Land group, while they spoke little, were reliable seniors. How could this guy possibly be one of them?

Alas, life has a way of proving one wrong.

“Scholar Song, my little friend, come out! I’m the Alchemical Sage!” The tall man’s eyes locked onto Scholar Song, and he burst into a hearty laugh, waving enthusiastically.

Instantly, every student fixed their gaze on Scholar Song.

Their stares were sharp and complex…

Scholar Song covered his face with one hand—there was no way he could continue living like this.

Moreover, how did the Alchemical Sage know he was here without calling him? Could he really track his location with some kind of spell?

Ultimately, Scholar Song steeled himself and stepped forward.

“Teacher, I’m taking a leave for two classes,” he said sheepishly to Professor Smith.

Professor Smith didn’t even blink; his consciousness was still frozen. By the time he snapped back to reality, he would just think he had daydreamed for a moment… he wouldn’t even realize one of his students had left right in front of him.

“Enough of the chit-chat, let’s go!” The Alchemical Sage pulled Scholar Song along.

“Tu Bo, please help me pack up the textbooks,” Scholar Song shouted back as he was dragged away.

At the back of the classroom, Tu Bo looked puzzled. “Isn’t that just another delivery guy?”

“Doesn’t seem like it,” Gao said, adjusting his glasses. “Speaking of which, the last one didn’t look much like a delivery guy either.”

On the way, Scholar Song asked, “Senior Alchemical Sage, how did you find me?”

“Using your phone’s location feature! As long as I input your phone number, I can pinpoint where you are. Then, I just had to look for the person in the classroom who had undergone ‘body enhancement’ to figure out who you were. After consuming the body-enhancing potion, the difference between you and ordinary people is quite obvious,” the Alchemical Sage said proudly.

Scholar Song felt another layer of his fantasies shatter. So, it was just a matter of phone tracking, not some grand spell that could locate him from miles away?

But wait, wouldn't tracking his location require his consent through his phone settings? Was the Alchemical Sage some kind of master hacker who could bypass his phone’s security?

“By the way, I didn’t expect you to dress so stylishly, Senior Alchemical Sage,” Scholar Song commented.

“Stylish? What do you mean by that?” the Alchemical Sage asked, looking puzzled.

“For instance, your wild hairstyle?” Scholar Song offered.

“Oh, about that! It’s because I flew directly from the North Sea Province to the Jiangnan area yesterday, crossing two provinces. The high-altitude winds messed up my hair,” the Alchemical Sage chuckled, looking a bit embarrassed.

“…” Scholar Song fell silent for a moment, then pressed on, “And what about your smoky eyes?”

“Smoky eyes? Oh, I know what you mean! My apprentice has mentioned it before; it’s that makeup style from a starlet named Avril, right? But this isn’t smoky eyes; it’s just regular dark circles. As an Alchemical Sage, I often stay up late refining pills, sometimes going weeks without food or sleep. Over time, I developed these dark circles. Since I often work for days on end now, they haven’t faded. Maybe once I break through my current level, they’ll disappear,” the Alchemical Sage laughed heartily.

Scholar Song felt as if a thousand galloping wild horses were trampling through his mind.

Compared to the Alchemical Sage’s reserved demeanor in their group chat, the real-life version was chatty and full of laughter. His entire image had been shattered.

……

……

In the boys’ dormitory.

“So, this is where you live? Your pill-refining room?” the Alchemical Sage inquired.

“The pill-refining room… well, I guess you could say that,” Scholar Song pointed to the kitchen.

“But this is a kitchen, isn’t it?” The Alchemical Sage rubbed his brow. “Ah, you mentioned using an electric stove and hot pot to refine the body-enhancing potion, so I guess it makes sense.”

A kitchen... sigh. The Alchemical Sage suddenly felt a wave of melancholy wash over him, prompting a deep sigh.

However, he quickly rallied.

“Scholar Song, could you refine another batch of body-enhancing potion for me to observe?” he asked earnestly.

Yesterday, while simulating the potion-making process based on Scholar Song’s description, he stumbled upon some interesting aspects.

Yet, simulating wasn’t the same as witnessing the real thing, so he wanted to see Scholar Song make the potion himself to confirm some details.

“Right now?” Scholar Song checked the time; the third class was already halfway through, and it was past nine-thirty.

“Is there a problem?” the Alchemical Sage asked, puzzled.

“I just don’t have enough time. In an hour and a half, the morning classes will end, and then it’ll be lunchtime,” Scholar Song explained.

“Oh, I almost forgot that ordinary people need to eat! What a hassle. If you were a cultivator, you could just pop a pill to solve those trivial needs,” the Alchemical Sage mumbled, then asked, “Do you have time this afternoon? We could refine the body-enhancing potion together!”

“This afternoon… I have class,” Scholar Song replied—though he could take a leave, and he even had the leave slip ready.

“You have class? I almost forgot you were a student! So, who’s your teacher this afternoon?” The Alchemical Sage asked casually.

That question sent a jolt of anxiety through Scholar Song.

“Senior, with all due respect, while I trust your integrity, I must ask—you're not planning to send my afternoon teacher to the hospital, are you?” Scholar Song asked earnestly—after all, the tragic incident caused by Fay Yu felt like it had happened just yesterday! No, it was practically the day before yesterday.

“Ahahaha, you thought of that too? What a clever idea! If we send your teacher to the hospital, you’ll be free in the afternoon, right? Don’t worry; I’ll handle it delicately, just a broken leg will do,” the Alchemical Sage said nonchalantly.

So casually breaking someone’s leg and sending them to the hospital—was this really the fine tradition of the Ninefold Land group?
