Chapter: The Vanishing Passengers and Mysterious Light Dots

Scholar Song took back his private pilot's license from the flight attendant and said, "I'll do my best."

"Make way, make way!" At this moment, Gao and Tu Bo squeezed anxiously beside Scholar Song.

Gao lowered his voice and asked, "Song, do you think you can handle this?"

"Well, someone has to give it a shot, right?" Scholar Song replied, not anticipating that his first time on a plane would lead to such a situation. With his current cultivation level at merely the first rank, he had no real flying skills. If a disaster occurred, he'd be just like any ordinary passenger—facing the same grim fate of potentially vanishing without a trace.

Gao and Tu Bo exchanged helpless smiles in response.

After tucking away his pilot's license, Scholar Song lifted his leg and headed for the cockpit, inquiring with the flight attendant, "Is the cockpit door open?"

In commercial aviation, the cockpit is strictly off-limits to unauthorized personnel. Older aircraft might have used a key, but the latest models mostly rely on electronic locks; some even require the captain to 'scan their face' to gain entry.

However, modern aircraft do have their advantages—many mainstream passenger planes come equipped with a feature that allows flight attendants to unlock the cockpit if there's no response from the pilots within thirty seconds of calling for them.

"The cockpit is open… It’s likely that when either the captain or co-pilot suddenly vanished, one of them desperately tried to escape, hoping to get away from the cockpit. However, it seems they didn’t manage to make it out," explained the slightly overweight flight attendant.

"Then leave it to me," Scholar Song said, exuding a calm confidence. The closer the situation got to life and death, the more composed he became.

Once inside the cockpit, Gao and Tu Bo quietly followed him in.

Meanwhile, under the flight attendant's guidance, the other passengers stood outside the cockpit, refraining from entering and interrupting Scholar Song—after all, this young man had only piloted a private jet before.

There was a world of difference between private jets and commercial airlines. If a crowd stormed the cockpit and disturbed Scholar Song, the chances of survival would diminish drastically.

……

Upon entering the cockpit, Scholar Song was momentarily dazzled by the array of instruments and buttons.

Indeed, it was completely different from a helicopter.

Tu Bo, watching Scholar Song, cautiously reminded him, "Song, flying a plane is not like driving a car… be careful."

Scholar Song nodded, taking a seat and attempting to increase the throttle. Commercial aircraft can be quite tricky in this regard, as different manufacturers have various throttle control methods.

Fortunately, before he learned to fly with Venerable White, Scholar Song had spent considerable time at the library reading numerous books on piloting.

He had gathered a wealth of information, and now, that knowledge was coming in handy.

Scholar Song began to operate the aircraft…

Gao and Tu Bo observed Scholar Song's skilled movements, seeming quite competent.

"Where did Song learn to operate a plane?" Tu Bo wondered, curiosity piqued.

Gao whispered, "Could it be from flight simulation games?"

Tu Bo placed a hand on his chest, feeling a rapid heartbeat.

……

Before long, the plane's autopilot mode lost signal, forcing Scholar Song to switch to manual control. However, the outside was engulfed in darkness, obscuring everything from view. Manual flying would only help maintain a steady flight.

He hoped to fly for a while longer, hoping to escape this eerie, dark void.

"I grasp the basic flying controls, but there's a crucial issue," Scholar Song began.

Upon hearing this, Gao asked, "What issue?"

"I can't land…" Scholar Song admitted.

He had only piloted helicopters, and the landing methods for helicopters and large passenger planes were entirely different. While he had theoretical knowledge about landing aircraft, much of it felt vague and unclear.

If he managed to land the plane based solely on that theoretical knowledge, it would be nothing short of a miracle!

Gao: "…"

Tu Bo: "…"

"And landing isn't the biggest problem," Scholar Song added with a wry smile, pointing ahead. "The more pressing concern is that we have no idea where we are or what's around us!"

Even with the lights on, the plane was surrounded by pitch-black darkness, rendering everything invisible.

Moreover, the communication system and navigation display in the cockpit showed no signs of signal. Their aircraft felt like a blind person groping in the dark.

Gao calmly asked, "So… does that mean we’re still doomed?"

Tu Bo pondered for a moment before pulling out his phone again. "Guess I should at least try to send out my last will and testament, huh?"

Just then, amidst their conversation, a cacophony of chaos erupted outside the plane. Men were shouting, women screamed, and children cried… it was a complete uproar.

"I'll go check!" Gao exclaimed, his thoughts immediately going to his girlfriend, Mei Yi. He rushed out of the cockpit towards the passenger cabin.

Upon reaching the cabin, he was stunned.

Inside, many passengers stood frozen, their bodies glowing with bright, flickering light, resembling fireflies in the night.

This surreal phenomenon left everyone dumbfounded.

"Mei Yi!" Gao quickly ran toward where his girlfriend was seated.

Fortunately, Mei Yi was unharmed, along with her classmate, Lu Fei, and her sister. Scholar Song's foreign disciple, Joseph, was also safe.

Mei Yi leaped into Gao's arms.

"What happened, Mei Yi?" Gao asked with concern.

"Just now, many passengers suddenly burst into flames of glowing light, just like these passengers in front of us," Mei Yi pointed at the glowing passengers.

"And then, those enveloped in the fiery glow seemed to burn away, turning into ash, leaving nothing behind." Mei Yi's eyes filled with terror.

As she spoke, one of the illuminated passengers suddenly screamed in horror. His body began to disintegrate into glowing particles from the bottom up.

These particles fell like sand, and soon… the glowing passenger vanished completely, leaving not even a scrap of clothing behind.

His scream acted as a trigger, and one by one, other illuminated passengers began to follow suit, transforming into particles of light.

Some of those passengers, now in panic, rushed towards their loved ones for help, but their light-particle bodies passed right through their friends and family like intangible souls…

Soon, they disappeared without a trace.

A chorus of chaotic screams erupted.

Gao frowned, silently thinking, "They vanished… Could it be that the captain, co-pilot, crew members, and the first batch of missing passengers all disappeared like this?"

"They… won't be dead, will they?" Mei Yi asked worriedly, the unexplainable phenomenon sending everyone into a frenzy.

"I have no idea," Gao sighed. He unconsciously said, "Let’s go to the cockpit and tell Song about this."

He wasn’t sure why he felt compelled to share this phenomenon of passengers turning into light particles with Scholar Song, but it felt like it might yield some insight.

……

Meanwhile, in the cockpit.

Tu Bo suddenly pointed ahead and shouted, "Song, be careful! There's something up ahead!"

"Something's up ahead?" Scholar Song's eyes widened, but outside, it remained an impenetrable darkness.

How could it be? If Tu Bo could see something, surely he should be able to see it too!

After all, he was a cultivator with his eyes opened, capable of seeing even spirits.

"I don't see anything… Are you sure you're not imagining things, Tu Bo?" Scholar Song quickly asked.

"No, I absolutely did not mistake it. The surroundings are dark, but that thing is bright; it’s glowing!" Tu Bo insisted loudly, pointing towards the front of the plane.

Scholar Song blinked hard, but all he saw was darkness. Could it be that his eyes were playing tricks on him?

While he pondered, Gao also entered the cockpit.

Outside, the flight attendants and passengers had already descended into chaos, all worried that the 'light' might suddenly manifest on them, turning them into particles of light. No one was paying attention to Gao and the others entering the cockpit.

"Song, something’s happened outside. A layer of flame-like light appeared around some passengers. Then, within that light, they turned into light particles and vanished," Gao immediately explained upon entering the cockpit. "I suspect the first batch of missing passengers disappeared like this, but they did so too quickly for us to see that layer of flame-like light."

Scholar Song rubbed his temples, overwhelmed by the relentless troubles that were piling up.

The unknown was the most worrisome… What on earth was happening?

If only he had brought Venerable White along—if he were here, they wouldn't have to fear a mere plane accident!

"Hey, Song! There’s something glowing up ahead!" Gao pointed to the front again.

The spot he was indicating was the same one Tu Bo had mentioned.

Scholar Song: "…"

What the hell? Why could both Tu Bo and Gao see it, but he couldn’t discern whatever this 'light dot' was?

Could it be something that only mortals could see, not cultivators?

"Can you all see it? Can Mei Yi see it too?" Scholar Song turned to ask Gao's girlfriend, Mei Yi, with a wry smile.

Mei Yi glanced at Scholar Song before nodding in affirmation.

"What does the light dot look like? Can you describe it?" Scholar Song sighed.

Gao raised an eyebrow in confusion and asked, "Song, are you saying you can't see it at all?"

"I can’t see anything; it’s just pure darkness for me," Scholar Song replied with a bitter smile.

Gao focused intently on the distant light dot, his eyes straining: "Song, let’s get a bit closer; we’re too far away right now to see clearly. It looks like a small green dot emitting golden light."
