**Chapter 1: The Unexpected Visitor**

"Benefactor, do you sell children here?"

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm glow that gradually faded into twilight, in a small village nestled in the outskirts of the Jiangnan region, a man named Cao Dechain sat on the doorstep of his old house, quietly smoking a cigarette. One after another, he finished his smokes, and in the end, it seemed he had made a decision.

He returned to his home, opened the small door of the wall cabinet, revealing an array of Buddha statues and divine idols inside.

"To all the deities, known and unknown, I, Old Cao, plan to retire after this last job. So please bless me, allow me to succeed in this final endeavor. Once I’ve turned over a new leaf, I will ensure that every statue receives a golden body," he said, lighting incense and placing a few fruits as offerings, attempting to maintain a facade of sincerity.

Cao Dechain carefully closed the cabinet door and let out a deep breath. 

"This is it, the last job! Once this is done, I’ll wash my hands of this business and assume a new identity somewhere else," he thought to himself.

After straightening his clothes, he turned to leave his old house, ready to seek out his final target.

However, as he turned, he was startled to find a small monk standing at his doorstep, seemingly appearing out of nowhere.

The little monk looked to be around eight years old, with a round, chubby face that was incredibly adorable, making one want to pinch his cheeks and twist them playfully. 

Despite his cute appearance, the little monk wore a serious expression, which, paradoxically, only enhanced his charm.

Cao Dechain found himself thinking, "If I were to sell this little guy, there would definitely be plenty of people willing to pay a hefty sum for him." His professional instincts kicked in, and he pondered the possibilities.

While Cao Dechain was lost in thought, the small monk brought his hands together in a gesture of respect and bowed slightly. "Benefactor, hello. May I ask if Cao Dechain is home?"

"Wait, how does this little monk know my name?" Cao Dechain wondered, feeling a twinge of confusion, but he replied with a polite nod, "Hello, little master. I am Cao Dechain."

"Then I’ve found the right person," the little monk said, visibly relieved. "I’ve come to find you, Benefactor. Is it alright if I come in to talk?"

Cao Dechain hesitated but eventually nodded, allowing the little monk to enter his home.

He cautiously asked, "What brings you here, little master? Did someone send you to deliver a message?"

"No," the little monk replied, bowing again. "I came here because I have something to discuss with you. I heard from various sources that you deal in selling children?"

The monk’s innocent smile was disarming. "I wanted to ask if you would buy a child. How about me? Although I’m already six years old, I think I’m quite adorable. If you’re interested, I’d sell myself for five thousand bucks. What do you say?"

Cao Dechain's expression morphed into one of sheer bewilderment.

"What kind of bizarre situation is this? Is this some kind of joke?"

Seeing the confusion on his face, the little monk frowned slightly. "Is that too much? Four thousand is fine too! I can’t go lower than that because I need money for a hemorrhoid surgery. I only have one thousand on me."

Cao Dechain remained in a state of shock.

"Is four thousand really too much? But I can’t go any lower; otherwise, I won’t be able to afford the surgery," the little monk continued, his brows furrowed in concern.

"Hemorrhoid surgery? Selling yourself to get four thousand? What kind of logic is that?" 

After a moment of silence, Cao Dechain finally spoke. "Little master, stop joking around. Where are your parents?"

The little monk thought for a moment before replying, "They're far away, flying in the sky. It takes about four or five hours to get there."

"Are you saying it takes four or five hours by plane? That’s quite far," Cao Dechain mused, feeling a twinge of concern in his stomach. "So how did you get here?"

"I sneaked out from the temple while my master wasn’t looking. After flying for four to five hours, I arrived in Jiangnan. I stayed with a friend for the night. But today, I came out to make some money on my own," the little monk said honestly—after all, monks are supposed to speak the truth.

At that moment, Cao Dechain's eyes lit up.

His stomachache miraculously vanished, and his heart raced with excitement. "Could this little monk be the blessing from those deities? The opportunity for my last big score?"

This little monk had a good foundation—he was young, with delicate skin and a handsome face. Although his thought process seemed a bit off, that was something he could teach him.

After a moment of contemplation, he asked, "What about your friend?"

The little monk replied, "I don’t know where he is; he went out with another elder and hasn’t returned for a long time. That’s why I came out alone. Benefactor, why are you asking all these questions? Just tell me, will you buy me for four thousand bucks? If not, I’ll go ask someone else!"

What a stroke of luck! Cao Dechain felt a surge of excitement—he had many connections in the business. 

If he could successfully sell this little monk, perhaps he wouldn’t have to worry about food and drink for the rest of his life. This was surely the result of his daily prayers to various deities.

At that moment, he began to entertain thoughts of trafficking the little monk.

…

However, being a careful person, Cao Dechain decided to step outside first, scanning the area for any signs of an ambush. It seemed there was no one lying in wait—perhaps it wasn’t a scam after all.

This little monk really was a bit clueless, coming to sell himself.

This was fantastic! All he had to do was take the little monk out of the southeast region and into another city, where he could find a buyer willing to pay a hefty price. By the time the monk's friend figured out something was wrong, he would have vanished without a trace.

With that thought in mind, Cao Dechain returned to the room and asked, "Are you really serious about selling yourself?"

"Of course! I need the money for my hemorrhoid surgery," the little monk nodded earnestly.

"Alright then, let’s do this!" Cao Dechain replied, feeling a rush of adrenaline.

After packing a few belongings, he led the little monk to his old, dilapidated car.

With a gentle smile, he said, "Get in, uncle will take you to a nearby city!"

"Are you really buying me, Benefactor?" The little monk’s eyes sparkled with excitement.

"Yes, get in the car!" Cao Dechain affirmed, opening the back door for the little monk.

Yet the monk hesitated, extending his hand. "Cash on delivery. If you’re buying me, you need to pay first before I can hand myself over."

This little monk really was something else!

But seeing the little monk’s determined expression, Cao Dechain gritted his teeth, pulled out his wallet, and counted out four thousand yuan, handing it to the little monk. "Here, four thousand bucks!"

After all, once they reached the next city, he could just knock the little monk out, and that four thousand would find its way back into his pocket.

The little monk carefully counted the money, then smiled with satisfaction. "No problem, Benefactor. I’ll sell myself to you! Now, can we go get my surgery done?"

Cao Dechain couldn't help but roll his eyes inwardly at the little monk's naive logic. "We’ll go to another place for the surgery. Their medical regulations are better—minimally invasive treatment, painless! I mean, it won’t hurt at all! After the operation, there won’t be any recurrence."

The little monk nodded, somewhat confused but trusting. "Alright, if you say so, Benefactor."

And so, the little monk obediently climbed into the backseat of the car.

Cao Dechain’s heart raced with excitement as he started the old car, the engine roaring to life as they sped away.

"Truly, one must have faith. It doesn’t matter which deity you worship, as long as you offer incense, one of them will surely answer your prayers!" he laughed heartily to himself.

In the alchemical sage's building, Scholar Song inquired, "Doudou, can you find the little monk?"

Doudou sat, tongue out and making an adorable face, tilting its head. "Of course! With my sense of smell, finding the little monk is a piece of cake!"

Scholar Song quickly opened a packet of chicken-flavored dog food and handed it to Doudou. "Then help me out and bring the little monk back!"

Doudou grabbed the food, devouring the entire packet in a few moments before tilting its head again. "What’s in it for me?"

To get Doudou to help, he needed to offer a satisfying reward or hope that Doudou was in a good mood that day.

Scholar Song thought for a moment and said, "How about I teach you how to drive? When you’re ready, I can take you to a secluded area where you can drive around!"

Doudou rolled its eyes at him, sticking out its tongue and rolling on the ground, clearly unimpressed by the offer.

Scholar Song gritted his teeth, "Once you get the hang of it, we can find a car and enchant it with ‘Invisibility Array, Anti-Detection Array.’ You can drive it as fast as you want wherever you like!"

As soon as he finished speaking, Doudou sprang to its feet. "No problem! Leave it to me! I’ll find the little monk quickly and let you know so you can come get him! Woof!"

With that, Doudou darted out the window, soaring into the sky.

Once Doudou was gone, Scholar Song couldn’t help but slap himself mentally. He had spoken too hastily—had he just promised to let Doudou race cars? Was he trying to get himself killed?

He’d have to visit a hospital soon, maybe pick up some ‘Quick-Acting Heart Pills’—he could feel his heart was about to give out from the stress.

"Scholar Song, do you have time?" At that moment, Venerable White, who had been researching something on the computer, turned to ask.

"I do," Scholar Song replied. After his evening cultivation session, he would have plenty of free time.

"Then tonight, I’ll teach you how to refine ‘Blood Qi Pills.’ I mentioned it before—you just need to gather the materials, and I’ll show you how to do it," Venerable White said.
