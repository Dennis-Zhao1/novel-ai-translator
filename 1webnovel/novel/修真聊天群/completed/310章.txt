**The Seventh Wish (Seeking Monthly Votes)**

“Fay, what are you up to?” A soft voice floated over from a distance.

Fay Yu quickly closed her laptop and turned to see who it was.

It was a woman who looked to be in her mid-twenties, but her eyes carried a maturity far beyond her years. It was none other than Fay’s close friend, the direct heiress of the Chu family, Chu Chunying.

“Chu sister! Hehe, I was just chatting with a senior.” Fay Yu put her laptop away, stood up, and stretched. Then, she dashed over to Chu Chunying, leaning in to press her ear against her slightly protruding belly. “How’s the baby doing? Is he kicking you? How many times did he kick yesterday?”

Chu Chunying laughed, “How am I supposed to answer that? I can’t exactly count how many times he kicks throughout the day!”

“I bet once I’m pregnant, I’ll be counting every single kick and remembering them all!” Fay Yu grinned, revealing a sharp tiger tooth. “If my baby kicks me a few times, I’ll note it down. When he or she grows up, I’ll make sure to settle the score!”

Looking at Fay Yu’s serious expression, Chu Chunying couldn’t help but chuckle. “You’re not even married yet, and you’re already thinking about kids? Aren’t you a little too anxious?”

“Hehe.” Fay Yu carefully pressed her ear against Chu Chunying’s belly, listening intently for any signs of movement from the baby inside.

Chu Chunying gently patted Fay Yu’s head.

How envious! Decades have passed, yet Fay Yu’s personality remains unchanged—still innocent, enthusiastic, and full of curiosity about the world. It’s clear how much the Spirit Butterfly Elder dotes on this beloved daughter.

In contrast, though Chu Chunying is merely three years older than Fay, she has endured far too much. Now that she is married, she feels as if she has aged considerably.

When she is with Fay Yu, it sometimes feels less like she’s the older sister and more like a motherly figure.

After all, the cultivation world is a place where strength reigns supreme. The Chu family is facing unexpected troubles primarily because they lack the necessary power.

...

...

Watching Fay Yu, Chu Chunying’s gaze softened, but she sighed inwardly.

Originally, she didn’t want to drag Fay Yu into her family’s troubles. She felt a twinge of reluctance to let Fay Yu witness the darker side of the cultivation world.

However, she never expected the news from Spirit Butterfly Island to be so well-informed. Just a short time without contact, and Fay Yu came knocking at her door to help.

“Thank you, Fay Yu,” Chu Chunying said softly.

“What’s there to thank? I haven’t done anything yet,” Fay Yu replied, lifting her head to ask, “How’s the situation with that cultivation sect? They can’t just hide in the shadows and use underhanded tactics against the Chu family. If they want the sword technique, they’ll have to show themselves eventually, right?”

“All they want is for our family to submit and hand over the sword technique willingly,” Chu Chunying replied quietly.

They wanted to have their cake and eat it too.

Fay Yu clenched her teeth, “What are your elders planning to do about it?”

“The clan elders said that since they want to save face, we should force them to show their true colors,” Chu Chunying’s lips curled into a smile, her gaze sharp. “The elders want to push them onto the ‘Celestial Severance Platform.’”

The Celestial Severance Platform is a place where two cultivation factions with unresolved conflicts can settle their grievances without resorting to a fight to the death. Each side sends someone to compete, resolving their animosity.

On the platform, life and death are without grievance. Once the competition is over, any enmity can be erased—though of course, while the surface-level grudges might evaporate, the deeper feelings would remain beyond anyone’s control.

“Celestial Severance Platform? I want to go! I want to go!” Fay Yu’s eyes lit up as she clenched her fists. “Let me handle it, and I’ll wipe out their entire sect from top to bottom!”

Fay Yu’s confidence stemmed from her formidable strength—the opposing sect was merely a small one, much weaker than the Moon Blade Sect that was destroyed during the incident with Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan.

The strongest in that small sect was just a Supreme Elder, barely at the fourth rank of cultivation, and his lifespan was running low.

The only members at the third rank were the sect leader, the vice-leader, and one protector. The majority of their disciples were only at the second rank.

As long as that Supreme Elder doesn’t step in, Fay Yu could single-handedly storm through their sect.

Even if the Supreme Elder did intervene, Fay Yu wasn’t worried—her father had prepared her many treasures. Even if a sixth-rank True Monarch intervened, she would be able to escape.

“Your intentions are appreciated, but...” Chu Chunying said gently, “On the Celestial Severance Platform, life and death are without grievance. Only members of our Chu family and the opposing sect are allowed to participate—no external help is permitted.”

If they wanted to find temporary allies to join their side during the competition, the platform’s guardian wouldn’t hesitate to take action against any unauthorized participants.

“No worries! I brought a treasure from my dad; it can transform into anyone! I can disguise myself as any disciple from your family and take their place on the platform. Once we apply for the Celestial Severance Platform, the guardian sent will definitely not see through my disguise,” Fay Yu said proudly.

The strength of the guardian would vary depending on the overall strength of the sect applying for the platform.

As she spoke, Fay Yu reached to her chest.

“...Oh no!” Fay Yu’s expression turned gloomy. “That treasure was lent to Senior Scholar Song, and it’s still with him.”

“Thank you so much, Fay Yu. But really, you don’t have to worry about helping us; we can handle it ourselves,” Chu Chunying chuckled lightly.

Above the East Sea, Venerable White sat on the back of a giant whale.

Next to him, Doudou and the little monk had woken up, but their bodies were still immobile, only able to move their eyes slightly.

Venerable White laid out bamboo sticks on the whale’s back, seemingly setting up some kind of formation.

“Let’s give it another shot. I feel like if I truly want to find that mysterious island, I should be able to locate it,” Venerable White murmured.

The formation he was setting up appeared to be an augury formation.

This time, Elder White was seriously trying to locate the mysterious island series.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On Heavenly Realm Island.

Scholar Song and Jiudeng Girl were once again aboard the lonely boat, rowing back to Jiudeng’s temple.

Jiudeng returned to her seat, propping her chin on one hand, her fingers tapping the tabletop.

“Jiudeng Girl, do you have any paper and a pen?” Scholar Song asked.

“Sure, what do you need them for?” Jiudeng handed over a roll of white paper and a pen.

Scholar Song took the pen and paper, scribbling the words ‘Dragon Bone Withered Vine’ in a haphazard manner. Once the ink dried, he wrapped up the sixteen Dragon Bone Withered Vines with it.

After finishing, Scholar Song suddenly remembered something and asked, “By the way, Jiudeng Girl, when I leave the island and seal my memory, I won’t need to destroy these scribbles, right?”

The Dragon Bone Withered Vines were as thin as hair... What if, after sealing his memory and leaving the island, he forgot what they were and carelessly discarded them? 

That would be a disaster!

“Don’t worry, these words unrelated to Heavenly Realm Island won’t be erased,” Jiudeng assured him.

“Great! I couldn’t be more grateful!” Scholar Song sighed in relief.

“Hahaha, ‘couldn’t be more grateful’ is a good phrase!” Jiudeng laughed.

“I really like it!” Scholar Song replied.

Jiudeng froze for a moment: “Why did you have to echo my words? When you do that, it diminishes my satisfaction by half!”

Scholar Song: “…”

Jiudeng rolled her eyes and then took out a small notebook, making a mark on it.

6: Complete a not too big, not too small wish. (Fresh scratch)

This seemingly troublesome wish was surprisingly easy to accomplish.

Finally, the last wish was coming up! She felt a bit excited; what could her final wish be?

After marking off her sixth wish, the last one finally appeared.

[7: Lastly, I want to become a happy bride…] 

As soon as Jiudeng saw the beginning of this wish, her face turned as pale as a ghost. She clenched her teeth, forcing herself to read on.

[Then, I want to have two adorable children with him, one boy and one girl…] 

Jiudeng rubbed her face vigorously and then slammed her head against the table.

Bang, bang, bang!

Splinters flew from the table, which was made of some unknown material.

Scholar Song looked at Jiudeng, who was suddenly acting out. “Jiudeng Girl, what are you doing?”

Jiudeng looked up, smiled sweetly, her charm fully displayed. “Nothing, I just want to be alone for a bit.”

Scholar Song opened his mouth but remained silent.

Jiudeng brushed off the wood shavings from her forehead and continued reading.

Marriage and having children? Just the thought of it felt terrifying.

And she had to have one of each? Is that something I can control? Well, maybe cultivators have ways to do it, but that’s not the point!

The issue is having children! What a frightening wish!

[Then, I want to accompany him as we grow old together, watching our son grow up, marry a wife, and then see our daughter gradually grow up. From a young age, I want to let her have long hair, a cute fringe, and dress her in pretty clothes and adorable little boots.] 

Long hair!

That seemed to be a lingering regret from when she knew she had to shave her head to become a nun. Damn it! It’s just shaving my head; why so much resentment?

Having a bald head is great; I wouldn’t have to take care of my hair! Plus, I wouldn’t have to worry about it getting messed up while sleeping!

Continuing to read...

[Finally, I want to grow old with him, watching our daughter marry far away. Then, I want to cry together with him in bed.] 

Jiudeng: “…”
