**The Elegant Scholar Hai**

The issue of how to deal with the bloodstains and the corpses of the assassins on the ground was a significant problem. The corpse dissolving liquid couldn’t break down the bodies of cultivators above the second rank.

Moreover, the sounds of the battle and the agonizing screams of the assassins before their death had likely attracted the attention of other residents on the floor. It wouldn’t be long before someone came to inquire about the situation.

If the residents discovered something amiss and reported it to the authorities, it could become a real hassle. This time, there was no bald foreign monk to take the blame for him.

Speaking of that foreign monk, he wondered how he was faring in prison now? Had he been rescued, or was he still stuck there?

Cough, getting sidetracked again.

"Let’s take care of these bloodstains and bodies first," Scholar Song suggested.

Sable Sixteen nodded. "We can move the bodies into the secret chamber for now. After a while, I’ll contact my clan, and specialized personnel will come to handle it, leaving no traces or repercussions. I can deal with the bloodstains outside right now."

The two of them first moved the corpses to the secret chamber.

Then, Sable Sixteen took out a vial of liquid and sprayed some over the battle site.

As soon as the liquid made contact with the blood, it quickly neutralized it. In the blink of an eye, all the bloodstains vanished without a trace, and even the lingering metallic scent of blood in the air was replaced by a faint medicinal fragrance.

Aside from a few knife marks left on the walls of the corridor and the suite, there were no signs of the earlier chaos.

Furthermore, the surveillance cameras on this floor had been tampered with since Sable Sixteen moved in.

"For now, let’s leave it like this. The rest can be handled by the professionals," Sable Sixteen said, softly sinking into the sofa, remaining motionless.

Scholar Song let out a sigh of relief, pulling out his phone to check the time—it was already 1:03 PM.

He needed to be at the vehicle administration office by 2 PM for a mandatory sign-in and then drop off Zhao Yayaya at the bus station.

With an hour left, he still had plenty of time.

Next, Scholar Song opened the Ninefold Land Group chat.

In the chat, the Hermit of North River expressed concern: "Little friend Song, how’s the situation? Are you both okay? I’ve already informed A-Qi, and he’s on his way to you."

"Thank you for your concern, senior. Thanks to Master Tong Xuan's flying sword, we’ve temporarily escaped this calamity. We’re safe for now," Scholar Song replied.

The Hermit of North River, seeing the message, finally let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. "Stay put and don’t wander around. A-Qi will arrive in ten minutes!"

"Got it," Scholar Song responded.

Just as he sent that message, he noticed that Sable Sixteen had quietly moved behind him and was peering over to sneak a look at his chat logs.

"I don’t want to see A-Qi," Sable Sixteen said, her big eyes wide and serious.

Scholar Song quickly reassured her, "Listen, don’t throw a tantrum. You’re seriously injured, and there’s that silly old man from the Immortal Farmer Sect who wants to capture you. It’s a whole lot of trouble. Meeting up with A-Qi will make things safer, and he’s really worried about you."

Sable Sixteen frowned. Normally, if she didn’t want to see A-Qi, she would’ve just run away.

But... Scholar Song had saved her multiple times in a single day. She felt indebted and didn’t want to oppose his wishes.

All she could do was frown and sulk.

"After A-Qi arrives, I need to head back to Jiangnan University Town for a bit. And stop talking negatively; who knows, maybe A-Qi has already found a way to treat your injuries," Scholar Song comforted her.

"It’s not that easy," Sable Sixteen mumbled. She knew her injuries all too well—she didn’t have much time left to live.

Scholar Song was about to offer more words of comfort when his phone rang.

Looking at it, he saw it was Zhao Yayaya calling.

Clearing his throat, he answered, "Hey, sister, what’s up?"

"Hello, Scholar. What’s going on with your phone? I couldn’t reach you at all!" Zhao Yayaya asked.

Scholar Song answered honestly, "Oh, that’s because I was in a place with no signal before, just got out."

"Where are you now?" Zhao Yayaya asked again. "And where did you run off to this morning? I heard Dr. Li mention that you carried a patient with a 570 condition out of the hospital? You even took a hospital blanket with you? Now I have to pay for that blanket!"

"..." Scholar Song glanced at the blanket thrown on the sofa, speechless.

"What on earth were you thinking carrying that girl away? She’s injured!" Zhao Yayaya fired off questions one after another.

Scholar Song scratched his head, trying to figure out how to explain it to Zhao Yayaya.

Just then, there was a knock at the door.

Scholar Song looked up and saw a middle-aged man standing at the door. Although the door had been broken open by the silly old man and was ajar, the middle-aged man still politely knocked.

"Excuse me, but did something happen here just now?" the middle-aged man inquired politely.

He could see that the suite was in disarray, as if it had been ransacked, and the front door’s lock was destroyed. Coupled with the chilling screams he had heard earlier, curiosity drove him to check it out.

"Sorry, it was just a dispute with a friend. We got a little carried away and broke some things, sorry for disturbing you," Sable Sixteen replied calmly as she stood up.

The middle-aged man sighed inwardly. These young people nowadays had such explosive tempers; they could turn an entire house upside down over a quarrel! After offering a few comforting words, he left Scholar Song and Sable Sixteen to return to his own floor.

Sable Sixteen's voice drifted into Zhao Yayaya’s ear through the phone.

Zhao Yayaya felt a stir in her heart and asked, "Scholar, are you still with that girl? Where are you both? What have you been up to for so long?"

"Sister, this is a long story… I’ll explain in person later. I have to go now, bye!" Scholar Song quickly hung up the call.

He needed to gather his thoughts to deal with Zhao Yayaya’s hundred questions.

Sable Sixteen shrank back into the sofa, her mind starting to ponder the origins of the assassins.

Right! Scholar Song had mentioned he had a way to trace the 'assassins' identities? A spark of curiosity ignited in Sable Sixteen’s heart...

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile, in a remote area of the ancient mountain forests of South China, there lay a region yet to be explored by humanity.

This was where the Moon Blade Sect was established.

The sect leader, Ba Qianjun, sat frowning on an ice chair, holding the latest model of a smartphone in his hand, engaged in a phone call.

"What? The assassination failed? You couldn’t kill Sable Sixteen? Useless!" Ba Qianjun frowned, letting out a sigh.

His breath carried an unbearable stench.

Not only that, but he also exuded the scent of roasted meat intermittently.

Upon closer inspection, it could be seen that Ba Qianjun’s entire back was charred black, and his right hand resembled a lump of charcoal. Moreover, golden flames flickered faintly in those charred areas. This golden fire was the tribulation fire from his failed heavenly tribulation, far worse than Sable Sixteen’s injuries!

That was why Ba Qianjun needed to rely on sitting in the ice chair, using the cold nature of the 'cold iron' to temporarily suppress the golden flames of the heavenly tribulation.

"Master Hai, the assassination failed; what should we do next?" He turned his gaze to a figure beside him.

It was a young man in white robes, carrying a long sword at his waist, appearing elegant and ethereal, as if he had stepped out of an ancient painting.

The elder of the Moon Blade Sect, Master Hai, was powerful and had always been the sect's strategist.

"Rest assured, sect leader," Master Hai said with a calm smile, his confidence evident. "Even if the assassination failed, it doesn’t matter… I have already prepared for both outcomes. Just follow the plan, and your tribulation injuries will surely heal."

Master Hai smiled faintly, as if the world was entirely within his control.

Ba Qianjun forced a smile, beside his ice chair sat a rainbow-colored celestial fruit radiating a gentle glow. His eyes were filled with hope.

Master Hai turned away, but a strange smile flickered in his eyes.
