**A Gray Robe Swapped for a White Dress, As Three Thousand Worries Drift Away**

How dare he marry while carrying a child? After this wedding, just wait until I get my hands on that little brat! Scholar Song thought darkly to himself.

With a heavy sigh, he entered the church alongside his wife, prepared to support their son through the wedding ceremony.

However, at the moment he stepped forward, he felt as if he had been transported through time and space, suddenly standing next to the 'bride,' taking on the role of her father.

What on earth just happened? How did I end up here beside the bride?

Confused, Scholar Song glanced sideways and saw a grown-up version of his daughter, Xiao Miao, smiling as she walked down the red carpet, his arm linked with hers.

The church doors swung open, revealing a handsome young man approaching, his gaze filled with tender affection for their daughter, Xiao Miao.

What the hell?! 

In an instant, the scene shifted from "My son is getting married" to "I'm giving my daughter away." 

Damn it! Which pig dared to take my adorable daughter, Xiao Miao? Young man, you better come over here; I promise I won't kill you... at least, not immediately!

That night, Scholar Song and his wife, the Ninth Lantern Maiden, huddled under the covers, both in tears.

But Scholar Song couldn't help but wonder why he was curled up in bed, silently sobbing. 

When did I become so emotionally invested in this strange world? It was just a fleeting dream, wasn’t it?

Yet, tears streamed uncontrollably down his face, as if he truly had spent twenty years with his son and daughter.

It was a peculiar feeling, indeed.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Buzz...

Suddenly, Scholar Song felt a heaviness in his head, causing his entire body to shudder.

He opened his eyes to find himself still squatting in the corner of the temple, a scripture in his hands, its pages stained with… his tears?

What is happening?

Quickly, he wiped away his tears, feeling utterly embarrassed; a grown man shouldn't be crying alone in a corner.

Was that a dream? It felt so vivid, yet bizarre. And why on earth did I dream about marrying the Ninth Lantern Maiden?

That doesn’t make sense! Surely, Yu Rouzi, A Sixteen, or even Classmate Lu Fei would have been more fitting brides for my dream.

Could it be that strange connection to Mistress Scallion causing this?

Stealing a glance toward the table, he noticed that the Ninth Lantern Maiden had vanished from her spot, her whereabouts unknown.

"Did she leave while I was sleeping?" Scholar Song closed the scripture and plopped down on the floor, leaning against the wall to rest.

Why do I feel so exhausted? My whole body aches.

After resting for a while, and seeing that the Ninth Lantern Maiden still hadn't returned, he felt puzzled.

After giving it some thought, he decided to head to the back of the temple to look for her.

---

In a small room at the back of the temple.

The Ninth Lantern Maiden reached up and lightly shaved her head... Her long hair, cascading down to her calves, fell to the ground, creating a dark and glossy carpet.

Three thousand worries, severed once more.

Soon, she transformed back into the bald Ninth Lantern Nun.

With her hair gone, she brought her hands together: "All conditioned phenomena are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, shadows; they are like dew and lightning..."

As she recited, a crimson hand appeared before her, hovering in the air.

In the center of this crimson hand rested a delicate crystal ball.

Within the crystal ball, there were faint indications of the flow of time... as if time and space were all contained within that crimson grasp!

Inside the crystal ball, scenes played out in a loop—everything Scholar Song had experienced in his dream.

Marriage, childbirth, growing old together, witnessing their children marry off...

Were these images mere illusions?

No, they weren't illusions.

The long hair that had just fallen away from the Ninth Lantern Maiden demonstrated that these events were far more than simple fantasies.

And the inexplicable ache in Scholar Song's body confirmed this as well.

So, was it real? Yet it seemed unreal; at least the children, Song Ren and Song Miao, who appeared in his dream, did not exist in reality.

What exactly was this experience?

Was it true? Was it false?

One thing was certain: this experience was not the same as the 'illusory truth' that might surface around the Seventh-Rank Venerable—it was a wholly different existence.

This experience could perhaps be termed 'the real illusion'?

In any case, even the Ninth Lantern, who had lived it, couldn’t explain it clearly, as her realm had not yet reached that level.

"That year's wishes have been fulfilled; can you see through them?" A heavy male voice echoed in the Ninth Lantern's ear.

She lowered her gaze slightly, her expression serene: "The wishes are fulfilled, yet some people, matters, and things are not only not clear, but they also feel increasingly foggy and confusing."

The heavy male voice let out a hearty laugh: "An interesting answer, Ninth Lantern. Do you know what I mean by 'seeing through'?"

The Ninth Lantern chuckled lightly, "I don’t know; I just need to know what I have seen through!"

As she spoke, her gray monk's robe suddenly shifted.

The gray robe opened up, transforming into a pure white dress.

The grass sandals on her feet ignited in flames, turning to ashes.

Barefoot, she stood upon the void, two golden lotuses blooming beneath her pristine feet, allowing her to tread without touching the earth.

From that moment forward... not a speck of dust would touch her feet!

Her aura surged to its peak; with just a thought, she could manifest a spiritual lake centered around the golden core within her.

Once she passed the heavenly tribulation, she could ascend to the Sixth-Rank True Monarch!

However, the Ninth Lantern did not rush to ascend.

First, she gently stroked her flowing hair, which burst into flames and turned to ash in an instant.

At the same time, the crimson hand that had hovered before her vanished.

After completing these actions, the Ninth Lantern smiled and turned around.

Just as she did, Scholar Song appeared at the doorway of the small room.

"Finally found you, Ninth Lantern Maiden. Huh?" Scholar Song blinked hard, staring at the Ninth Lantern before him.

Before his eyes stood a fairy in a white dress, floating in the void, barefoot and standing atop two golden lotus flowers. Her imposing figure radiated a sacred aura.

Too bad... this fairy was bald.

Where did the Ninth Lantern in the white dress go? Scholar Song had unwittingly mixed her with the Ninth Lantern from his dream, who had worn a pure white wedding gown.

He felt as though he was still trapped in a dream.

"How do I look?" The Ninth Lantern asked, squinting her eyes and grinning broadly at Scholar Song.

Scholar Song gave her a thumbs up: "Honestly, you look amazing! Putting on this white dress makes you seem like a completely different person—it's blindingly beautiful!"

"Hahaha!" The Ninth Lantern laughed heartily: "Blindingly beautiful is a perfect description; I really like it!"

This time, Scholar Song found himself speechless; he had unknowingly grown accustomed to the Ninth Lantern's quirks.

"It's getting late; you've been on Tianjie Island for quite some time," the Ninth Lantern said. "Originally, I wanted you to stay a little longer so I could play the gracious host. But unfortunately... I'm on the verge of a breakthrough in my realm, so I can’t keep you here any longer."

"That's alright, Ninth Lantern. You've already helped me so much; I can't thank you enough! Since you're about to break through, I won’t impose any further. Please just point me in the right direction, and I'll prepare to leave Tianjie Island." Scholar Song was careful not to be overly polite with the Ninth Lantern.

What if he said too much, and she insisted on keeping him as a guest?

"There's no rush." The Ninth Lantern smiled slightly and snapped her fingers: "Before I send you off, I happen to have something to lend you. Take Mistress Scallion out of your pocket; three hundred years ago, she took a scroll of the 'Buddhist Lion's Roar Technique' from me. Now that your oral acupoints are close to being opened, this scroll will provide you with the perfect assistance. Mistress Scallion, take out the 'Lion's Roar Technique'—I’ll teach Scholar Song while giving you some pointers too."

Scholar Song pulled Mistress Scallion from his pocket.

Mistress Scallion trembled, pulling out a scroll of techniques from somewhere.

Scholar Song glanced at the scroll—ah, the 'Buddhist Lion's Roar Technique'... another Buddhist technique? He felt like he had gathered quite a few Buddhist techniques already.

But for the sake of opening his acupoints, it was worth it!

At worst, once he reached the 'Second Rank,' he could cleanse his skills and focus on Confucian and Daoist techniques!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In the East Sea, a giant whale slowly swam across the surface of the water.

"This direction—this is southwest? Scholar Song should be somewhere around here," Venerable White said, putting away his divination array and pointing towards the southwest. "Let's go, head that way!"

The giant whale spouted a fountain, as if it had a mind of its own, turning and swimming southwest.

"This direction should lead us to Scholar Song, even if we don’t find the mysterious island," Venerable White murmured.

Hopefully, he could locate the mysterious island, as he had always been curious about that place!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At that very moment, on a lonely island in the East Sea.

A woman dressed in a black dress and black stockings moved swiftly across the island, agile like a cat as she leaped through the jungle.

Behind her, a muscular man, as strong as an ox, followed closely: "Chuchu, this tiny island isn't that big. Where else can you run? You might as well surrender to us three brothers. We're all gentlemen who cherish delicate flowers and will definitely let you off easy."

To the left of this ox-like man was a slender figure with long arms, moving through the jungle even faster than the woman in black. To the right was a wolf-like man, running on all fours with a cold expression: "Er Niu, stop talking nonsense. Spread out and corner her; we can't let this girl escape back to the Chu family."

They were hired to capture the genius little girl from the Chu family, 'Chuchu,' and they absolutely could not let her return to participate in the 'Duanxian Platform.'
