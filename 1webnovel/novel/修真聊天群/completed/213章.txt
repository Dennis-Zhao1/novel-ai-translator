**Misunderstanding the Spacesuit and Venerable White**

“Guoguo, in a bit, Venerable White and I need to head out. You stay home and watch the house, and after we get back, I'll take you to the hospital, how does that sound?” Scholar Song asked, stuffing the last piece of bread into his mouth.

If it were a normal flight training session, bringing Guoguo along wouldn't be a problem. But learning to fly with Venerable White? Scholar Song definitely didn’t want to drag her into any trouble.

The little monk pounded his chest confidently, “No problem! I can totally watch the house.”

Scholar Song nodded in approval and glanced at Dou Dou, who was focused on the news on the computer. Feeling a bit relieved, he thought everything would be fine.

…

After breakfast, as was his routine, Scholar Song did his morning exercises. Half an hour later, after several rounds of the “Foundational Vajra Fist,” the doorbell rang.

“Is it the agent that Venerable Huang mentioned?” he wondered, heading to the door. Opening it, he was greeted by a blonde, blue-eyed Western woman standing on his doorstep.

The blonde looked Scholar Song up and down, then checked the documents in her hands to confirm. With a professional smile, she said, “Hello, are you Mr. Song Shuhang?”

Her Mandarin was surprisingly fluent, making Scholar Song wonder how many Westerners had such strong Chinese skills. It left many native Chinese speakers feeling a bit inadequate.

“That’s me,” he replied.

“Nice to meet you! I’m Katherina from the Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center. I’m here on behalf of Mr. Huang Wenzhong to take you both for theoretical and practical flight training,” she said with a slight smile, snapping her fingers.

Behind her, two suited men brought in a large box.

“This is the ‘aviation suit’ and accompanying oxygen equipment you’ll need, Mr. Song. Please take a look.” Katherina’s eyes sparkled with curiosity—she couldn’t understand why one would need an ‘aviation suit’ to learn to fly. After all, it wasn’t like they were about to board a spaceship. Wouldn’t wearing such cumbersome clothing make it hard to enjoy flying?

However, the customer is king, especially when that customer is a wealthy and influential one. She wouldn’t be foolish enough to argue with a client—after all, Mr. Huang Wenzhong had bought their entire flight training center just for this seemingly ordinary university student and another Mr. Song Bai.

“By the way, is Mr. Song Bai with you?” Katherina inquired.

“He's just around back. Would you like to come in?” Scholar Song replied while moving to the big box, eager to see the clunky ‘spacesuit’ inside.

Upon opening it, he was met with the sight of a heavy, awkward suit—one that looked like it belonged in a sci-fi movie, complete with buttons that transformed it into a snug fit. Scholar Song wondered when such a sophisticated space suit would be developed in real life.

Katherina maintained her smile, “Our training center is a bit of a distance away, and we’re on a tight schedule. How about we head to the flight training center right away? We can summarize the theoretical knowledge in an hour and then get you both some hands-on experience with the aircraft. We have various models you can choose from for your training.”

“Various models of aircraft? That sounds great!” Scholar Song’s eyes lit up. Perhaps he could choose a small helicopter to learn on—this way, he wouldn’t have to worry about Venerable White accidentally flying them into space.

“I’m glad to hear that! Here are your Class II medical certificates and your Private Pilot Licenses (PPL). Please keep them safe,” Katherina said, handing over the documents.

As Scholar Song accepted the four certificates, a mix of emotions washed over him. He hadn’t even touched an airplane yet, yet here he was with a pilot's license. The feeling was both exhilarating and a bit embarrassing, bringing a strange sense of joy tinged with guilt.

Katherina’s expression remained calm as she asked, “Where’s Mr. Song Bai? We can leave anytime.”

“I’ll call him down,” Scholar Song said, tucking the certificates away before turning back to wave at the stairs behind him.

A moment later, Venerable White calmly descended from the third floor. Though his expression was serene, the joy in his eyes was unmistakable.

Compared to cars, he seemed much more excited about flying. He hadn’t shown this much enthusiasm when learning to drive.

…

“Please hop in,” Katherina said as she opened the door to a pickup truck.

The two suited men loaded Scholar Song’s hefty ‘spacesuit’ into the back of the truck. He slid into the back seat, stretching his arms lazily.

Venerable White followed suit. However, as he got in, he glanced back at the ‘spacesuit’ with a dawning realization.

In his heart, Venerable White thought, “Is that a spacesuit? Young friend Song Shuhang must be planning to take a trip to space!”

How should he put it… After the recent incident involving a car that accelerated too fast, leading to brake failure and a broken steering wheel, Venerable White had decided to turn over a new leaf. This time, as he prepared to learn how to pilot an aircraft, he was determined to study diligently and master the theory and skills needed to fly.

He absolutely would not draw any formations on the plane this time. During the flight, he would control himself and not succumb to the urge to dismantle the aircraft!

In short, he would not cause any trouble for Scholar Song!

At most, once he had mastered flying, he would get his own plane and then happily draw all kinds of formations and runes in the sky.

This was the resolution Venerable White had made for himself in recent days.

With his level of cultivation, as long as he set his mind to something, he had the self-restraint to see it through.

But when he saw the ‘spacesuit’ again, he blinked—was Scholar Song actually planning to fly into space for real?

…

…

Once Venerable White was settled in, Katherina started the pickup truck and headed toward the Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center.

As they traveled, Scholar Song sat in the vehicle, quietly operating the “True Self Meditation Sutra” to optimize his state. He also wore the ‘Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl’ around his neck to keep his mind sharp.

He had adjusted his mindset and state, ready for anything—when the time came, whether they were taking off from Earth or Venerable White landed the plane on the moon, he wouldn’t be surprised.

At that moment, Venerable White tentatively asked, “Shuhang, is that a spacesuit in the back? Are you going to use it?”

“Haha, yes!” Scholar Song kept his smile. “That’s something I had Venerable Huang prepare for me. Ever since I was little, I’ve admired astronauts. So when we were going to fly, I thought of this suit. I just wanted to indulge myself a bit!”

He couldn’t bring himself to tell the truth—after all, with his good-natured personality, he couldn’t say something like, “Venerable White, I’m worried you might fly the plane into outer space, so I got a spacesuit just in case!”

“Oh,” Venerable White nodded in understanding. So young friend Song Shuhang had been interested in astronauts since he was little. That made sense; the vast, mysterious Earth and the boundless universe were indeed captivating.

“Do you like the universe, Shuhang?” Venerable White asked.

“Well, if we’re being honest, I definitely do,” Scholar Song replied after a moment of thought. He had a keen interest in the mysteries of the universe, black holes, meteors, comets, and the moon.

“If you had the chance, would you want to go play out there?” Venerable White asked, his curiosity piqued.

Scholar Song paused—wait a minute, this conversation was veering off in an unexpected direction!

Why did it sound like he really wanted to go play in space? No, he needed to express his reluctance to go to space in a gentle way.

After some thought, Scholar Song responded diplomatically, “Maybe in the future. If I get the chance, it would be nice to see the universe. But right now, I can’t go. Even with a spacesuit, I wouldn’t last long out there.”

“True, that makes sense,” Venerable White nodded.

Seeing Venerable White’s response, Scholar Song let out a small sigh of relief. It seemed that Venerable White had dismissed the idea of going to ‘space’ for now.

Looks like he had dodged that bullet—for the moment!

…

At that moment, Katherina in the front seat let out a quiet sigh.

True wealthy individuals are different; while others are still thinking about flying for fun, the truly rich are already contemplating how to play in space.

How enviable!

As she pondered, she cast a glance at Venerable White. Speaking of which, this Mr. Song Bai was undeniably handsome.

Even with the differences in Eastern and Western aesthetics, his looks transcended those boundaries.

If only she could be his girlfriend! Katherina swallowed hard—wait, what was happening? Why was she suddenly feeling so infatuated? She hadn’t even exchanged a word with him yet, and here she was, feeling a strange, instantaneous attraction?

No way, it had to be that she hadn’t woken up properly this morning.

Katherina forced herself to suppress these bizarre thoughts, but her gaze kept drifting to the rearview mirror to catch glimpses of Venerable White.

In fact, Katherina was fortunate because Venerable White had recently learned to control his aura and charm.

Otherwise, if it had been the old him just returning from seclusion, simply walking down the street would have drawn a following of girls chanting, “Long hair for you, waiting to be tied up by you; without you, I won’t marry!”

Even some of the weaker-willed female cultivators couldn’t resist such a captivating allure.
