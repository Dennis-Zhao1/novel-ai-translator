### Chapter: The Super Nightmare of Zhuge Zhongyang

Scholar Song stared wide-eyed at the tiny Zhuge Yue, who was no bigger than a doll. "What happened to you?"

"Scholar Song!" Zhuge Yue exclaimed, quickly scrambling up from behind a tree and running toward him with her short legs.

Bending down, Scholar Song caught the panicked Zhuge Yue in his arms, gently patting her back like one would a small child. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of Jiu Deng. However, it seemed Zhuge Yue was completely oblivious to her presence.

"What’s going on?" Scholar Song asked, still comforting Zhuge Yue.

"Waah... it’s so terrifying," Zhuge Yue choked out as she began to explain. "Here’s what happened: after the plane crash, my brother and I woke up in the middle of a jungle, along with two other passengers. We decided to stick together and look for the wreckage and other survivors."

"But just as we were about to leave the jungle, we encountered three bizarre figures. The moment they saw us, they attacked without warning! And, they could turn invisible! I’m not kidding! Right in front of us, they just vanished into thin air. My brother Zhuge Zhongyang and I had to run away, and then we got separated from the others."

"And that’s not even the strangest part! While I was being chased by one of the invisible figures, I stumbled into another part of the jungle and suddenly felt a chill in my feet… and then, I shrank down to the size of a palm! Even my clothes shrank along with me!"

"I just kept running, and maybe because I was so small, that invisible person lost track of me, and I ended up here."

"It took a long time, but eventually, I started to regain my size, though I’m still this small."

Despite her tears, Zhuge Yue clearly recounted everything that had happened to her.

A chill in her feet and then shrinking? Did she accidentally trigger some kind of formation on Tianjie Island? And those invisible figures—who were they?

Scholar Song turned to Jiu Deng, "Miss Jiu Deng, do you know what’s going on?"

"There are many reasons someone might suddenly shrink… but if it’s happening in this jungle, it’s likely the work of a rare spirit beast. I’ve heard rumors that one resides on Tianjie Island, but I’ve never seen it myself. Your friend probably came into contact with it by accident, which is why she shrank. However, that spirit beast should have just eaten, so it’s not hungry right now; otherwise, your friend would have already become its meal," Jiu Deng explained with a smile. "As for those invisible figures, they might be cultivators who entered Tianjie Island. You know, the island has a mysterious allure that attracts many cultivators to explore. Why they would attack your companions is beyond me. There are many types of cultivators—Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian, demonic, and even ghostly ones. Some of them have wicked natures and enjoy killing, so it’s not surprising."

Scholar Song nodded thoughtfully. Knowing there might be invisible enemies made things more complicated.

Moreover, when Jiu Deng mentioned the "rare spirit beast," something clicked in his mind...

At that moment, Zhuge Yue looked at him in terror. "Scholar… who are you talking to?"

So, Zhuge Yue really couldn't see Jiu Deng?

"Don’t worry; she’s a friend of mine, and she’s been hiding in the shadows to keep me safe. Thanks to her, I was able to find you." Scholar Song reassured her.

Zhuge Yue nodded silently.

"Let’s go. I’ll take you to find Zhuge Zhongyang and the other two passengers," Scholar Song said.

Just then, panic flashed in Zhuge Yue’s eyes. "Scholar, watch out!"

Suddenly, a figure emerged behind Scholar Song.

This figure had appeared out of thin air, having been invisible until now—the very same kind of invisible figures Zhuge Yue had mentioned.

Their method of invisibility was a special secret technique, and despite Scholar Song activating both the "Mental Detective Technique" and the "Alert" method, he hadn’t sensed the figure approaching at all.

As the figure became visible, it swung a heavy metal rod down towards Scholar Song’s head.

The rod glimmered with a faint blood light, a telltale sign of explosive blood qi. This blow aimed to take Scholar Song out for good.

Clang!

Caught completely off guard, Scholar Song was struck down to the ground. The doll-sized Zhuge Yue was tossed aside with a scream of terror.

The figure that had appeared was a scruffy-looking man dressed in a bright pink outfit with a large red belt. With such an odd appearance, it was no wonder Zhuge Yue had referred to him as a "bizarre person." He truly resembled a real-life creepy uncle.

The creepy uncle grinned at the fallen Zhuge Yue, licking his lips. "Hehe, I didn’t expect you to have a helper. But it won’t matter; this little rookie cultivator isn’t my match at all. And you’ve shrunk so much; it almost made me lose track of you… But this cute little size of yours will certainly make you more flavorful."

As he spoke, the creepy uncle winked at Zhuge Yue.

Zhuge Yue didn’t understand the earlier parts of his speech, but the latter made her stomach churn. "Uncle, I’m not into that kind of thing!"

"Hehe, little girl, do you think that silly lie can fool me? Even if you’re dressed like a boy, you can’t hide from my trained eyes. Time is short; I need to get a taste of you before my two junior brothers arrive. With your special physique, consuming you will surely help me leap over the Dragon Gate and reach the second-grade realm. Tsk tsk tsk." The creepy uncle started to remove his pink outfit.

"Babe, I’ll love you well," he winked at Zhuge Yue.

Zhuge Yue turned pale; if this creepy uncle was her first experience, she would rather die.

Desperately, she bit her tongue—should she bite it to death? But would biting her tongue really be fatal? How much of it would she have to bite off? Would just the tip do the trick?

Just then… Scholar Song suddenly vanished from her side.

In the next moment, he reappeared right in front of the creepy uncle, crouching low as he slammed his palm against the uncle’s chest.

"Thunder Palm!" Scholar Song shouted.

The explosive sound of arcs of electricity filled the air as dazzling lightning struck the creepy uncle’s chest.

"Ugh…" The creepy uncle spat blood, his chest charred black as the energy from the Thunder Palm coursed through him, even carbonizing part of his internal organs.

"How is this possible? Thunder Palm! How can this be? You clearly took my blow!" The creepy uncle stumbled back, trembling as he pointed at Scholar Song, disbelief etched across his face.

That hit hadn’t been a simple street thug's swing; it was a heavy strike infused with all his blood qi. How could a cultivator who looked like a rookie withstand such a blow?

Scholar Song felt a cold sweat break out—this opponent’s invisibility technique was so bizarre that it had fooled his Mental Detective Technique. If it hadn’t been for the golden shield activated by the Phantom Spirit in his heart, that blow could have had dire consequences.

"Damn it… I can’t believe I’m dying at the hands of a rookie cultivator like you." The creepy uncle struggled for a moment before reluctantly closing his eyes.

Having taken the brunt of a Thunder Palm strike directly to his chest, even a first-grade cultivator wouldn’t survive.

After all, not every rookie cultivator was as lucky as Scholar Song, blessed with a defensive Phantom Spirit.

"Let’s go; we need to find your brother." Scholar Song scooped up the doll-sized Zhuge Yue as he spoke.

But Zhuge Yue stared at him blankly.

Did she just see Scholar Song explode with thunder and defeat that invisible creepy uncle?

An invisible figure with the ability to generate electricity—was Scholar Song some kind of superhero? Was this a real-life version of X-Men?

Damn it, if only I hadn’t lost my camera; this would have made for an incredible headline. Zhuge Yue’s professional instincts kicked in.

"Are you looking for this little girl’s brother? I detected a scent very similar to hers nearby; it should be your Zhuge Zhongyang," Jiu Deng spoke up.

She hadn’t shown any intention of intervening until now.

Still, as long as Jiu Deng was willing to help guide him, Scholar Song was satisfied.

"However, we need to hurry. Zhuge Zhongyang is currently very close to another 'bizarre person,'" Jiu Deng said with a smile.

Scholar Song’s expression changed.

Then, Jiu Deng sped ahead to lead the way, and Scholar Song hurriedly activated his "Gentleman’s Journey" technique to keep up.

Soon enough… Scholar Song found Zhuge Zhongyang.

At that moment, Zhuge Zhongyang was being pursued by yet another creepy uncle, who had a scruffy face and was dressed in a bright pink outfit, tied with a large red belt.

These creepy uncles were similar in demeanor and speech, so we can call this one Creepy Uncle #002.

"Finally caught up with you! You little cutie run pretty fast; I almost lost track of you… But a prey that can run is even more enticing; you’ll taste even better!" Creepy Uncle #002 licked his lips, winking at the fallen Zhuge Zhongyang.
