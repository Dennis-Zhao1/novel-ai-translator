**“I can’t believe this!”**

The older police officer took the stack of evidence from the little monk, flipping through the pages. With each glance, his eyes grew brighter!

He immediately pointed at Cao Dechain and roared, “Arrest him! Bring him back!”

These pieces of evidence not only served as powerful proof that Cao Dechain was a human trafficker, but they also hinted at a broader network of traffickers that could be uncovered. If they were lucky, they might even dismantle a major trafficking ring.

Cao Dechain was the key to cracking this case, and there was no way they could let him escape!

The two officers behind him moved in like wolves ready to pounce.

“Damn it!” Cao Dechain quickly pushed the car door open and bolted into the distance.

From the moment the little monk pulled out the ‘evidence,’ he had been ready to run—never did he expect that after a lifetime of dodging storms, he would finally trip over his own feet in the end.

However, catching him was not going to be easy. Despite his slender physique, he had long imagined scenarios where he would have to flee from the police.

To prepare for such situations, Cao Dechain had trained extensively in parkour.

That’s right, Cao Dechain was a parkour expert, and under the alias ‘Masked Jumper,’ he had even posted many impressive parkour videos online.

So when he took off running, the two officers were left dumbfounded.

With a burst of speed, Cao Dechain planted his hands on a car and executed a perfect flip over it, then dashed forward towards a three-meter-high platform.

With another surge of energy, he kicked off the wall and, like a nimble monkey, swiftly climbed up to the top of the platform.

By the time the two officers rounded the car, he was already far ahead!

“Damn!” the two officers cursed. While they trained regularly, they weren't special forces and their training wasn't as intense. In a straight sprint, they could probably match Cao Dechain, but with his monkey-like agility, they simply couldn’t keep up.

At that moment, the little monk blinked and turned to the older officer, asking, “Hey, do you want to catch Cao Dechain?”

“We can’t catch him now,” the older officer sighed, realizing that with Cao Dechain’s agility, it was nearly impossible.

Next, they would have to issue a wanted notice.

“Oh, do you need help from the little monk?” the small monk, Guoguo, asked, his hands pressed together in a gesture of prayer.

“Huh?” The older officer looked at Guoguo, confused.

“I was originally planning to take Cao Dechain into the deep mountains and turn him into a monk for life, so he could atone for his past sins. But now that I think about it, handing him over to you uncles isn’t too bad either,” Guoguo said earnestly.

In the next moment, the older officer watched as the little monk leaped into action. His short legs barely touched the ground, yet he moved with a grace that was astonishing… In just a breath's time, Guoguo had already outpaced the two younger officers.

Faced with the three-meter-high platform, Guoguo effortlessly climbed it by kicking off the wall.

“What the hell!” both officers exclaimed in shock.

If they were surprised by Cao Dechain’s parkour skills, Guoguo’s performance left them utterly speechless! After all, the little monk looked like a mere seven or eight-year-old child, and that was a three-meter-high platform!

This was no longer just parkour; it was… Chinese martial arts?

“Captain?” one of the younger officers turned to the older officer, “What should we do now?”

The older officer scratched his head, “Wait!”

…

…

On the roof of the car, Doudou curled his tail, pondering. “What was that little monk saying? He was going to take that trafficker into the mountains to live as a monk for life? Where did that little guy learn such a dark idea? He’s only six!”

After thinking it over, Doudou concluded that monks like the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain were probably the most straightforward.

It’s said that humans are the most biased when it comes to judging others; they only see the faults in others.

Turns out, dogs are the same—Doudou had conveniently forgotten about the time the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain created hundreds of fake accounts to toy with the emotions of the Cloud Mist Daoist.

About two minutes later.

Up on the three-meter-high platform, Guoguo jumped down, dragging a figure behind him.

The older officer’s cigarette dropped to the ground in disbelief.

In Guoguo's grasp was none other than the human trafficker, Cao Dechain.

A martial arts master!

Four golden characters flashed like a movie title in the older officer's mind, refusing to fade away.

“Here you go, I’ll leave him to you,” Guoguo said, casually tossing Cao Dechain at the feet of the three officers.

The officers looked down at Cao Dechain, unconscious yet still bearing an expression of sheer terror, and swallowed nervously.

Finally, it was the older officer who snapped back to reality first.

“Get this guy arrested and bring him back to the station!”

The two younger officers quickly stepped forward to handcuff Cao Dechain.

“Little master, what’s your name?” the older officer took the opportunity to step closer to Guoguo with a friendly smile.

“Little monk is called Guoguo, but I don’t have a Dharma name yet because I’m not old enough for the abbot to give me one,” Guoguo said, hands pressed together, looking serious yet honest.

The older officer eagerly asked, “Where do you practice, little master?”

This question made Guoguo frown, his face filled with conflict.

The abbot had said that the name of the Tianya Wandering Temple shouldn’t be shared with outsiders.

But a monk couldn’t lie either.

How should he answer?

At that moment, Doudou, who was perched on the car’s back, snorted.

Then a deep voice rang directly in the older officer’s ear: “Don’t ask what you shouldn’t. Woof!”

The older officer was taken aback, looking around but finding no one in sight.

Then he realized, feeling a bit embarrassed, that it must have been the elder of the little monk warning him.

However… what did the ‘woof’ at the end mean? Perhaps it was more fitting to say ‘done’?

The older officer bid farewell to Guoguo and, with his two companions, took Cao Dechain away.

In truth, he wanted to linger a bit longer with the little monk, even if just to learn a legendary move or two.

Chinese martial arts! Real martial arts!

Unfortunately, the little monk had elders watching over him, and that wish was destined to remain unfulfilled.

Thinking about it, such a small child leaving the temple would definitely have elders secretly following to protect him, right?

…

…

Guoguo watched the departing older officer with a puzzled expression, rubbing his shiny bald head.

“Even though I don’t know why he suddenly apologized to me, I finally figured out the answer,” Guoguo said with regret.

He had just thought long and hard and come up with the answer—sorry, my abbot doesn’t let me tell others the name of the temple.

He felt it was a great answer.

Unfortunately, the older officer had suddenly apologized and left, not giving him the chance to say it.

“Cough cough, woof!” At that moment, Doudou lightly called out, making his presence known.

“Eh?” Guoguo turned to look at the roof of the car.

There, he saw a Pekingese supporting its head with one paw and playing with a set of keys with the other, lying sideways like a human in a rather charming pose.

“Doudou!” Guoguo exclaimed joyfully upon seeing the Pekingese.

But he quickly became shy, lowering his head and cautiously asking, “Doudou, why did you follow me out?”

“Tsk tsk, if I didn’t follow you out, how could Shuhang relax at home?” Doudou whistled.

Guoguo pressed his palms together, apologizing, “I’m sorry for causing you trouble again.”

“No need to apologize to me; just apologize to Shuhang later! Woof.” Doudou thought for a moment and then pulled out its phone from somewhere: “Here, let me show you something cool.”

“Huh?” Guoguo leaned in, curious.

Doudou showed him a video—one it had secretly recorded.

On the screen, Song Shuhang was fuming, shaking his fist: “Ahhh! Are you trying to kill me? I told you to stay home and guard the house, but you went out running around, treating my words like they were nothing! And PS, PS your sister! When I catch you, I’ll beat the crap out of you!”

I’ll beat the crap out of you!

Beat it out!

Out!

Guoguo stared blankly, cautiously touching his backside. The next moment, his serious little face turned into one of despair.

“Tsk tsk, how about we replay that?” Doudou pressed the screen, and the video began to play again…

I’ll beat the crap out of you!

I’ll beat the crap out of you!

Guoguo felt like crying.

“Tsk tsk, and here’s another piece of news—you're currently in Wenzhou City, which is Shuhang’s hometown. He’s planning to come here in a couple of days,” Doudou said, clearly enjoying Guoguo’s distressed expression.

Guoguo went stiff all over.

“Doudou, what should I do?” he asked, his voice trembling with a hint of crying.

“If I’d known this would happen, I wouldn’t have run away. You know how worried your family would be!” Doudou lectured with a serious tone—conveniently forgetting the fact that it itself was a big demon dog that often ran away from home.

“I’m sorry.” Tears welled up in Guoguo’s eyes.

Doudou patted his shoulder: “Hang in there! Since Shuhang is coming to Wenzhou City soon, you have some time to think about how to apologize and cool him down a bit.”

Guoguo nodded vigorously.

“Now, let’s find a hotel nearby to stay in,” Doudou leaped down from the roof: “Come on, let’s get in the car!”

“In the car? But I can’t drive!” Guoguo was taken aback.

“I’ll drive!” Doudou declared with enthusiasm!

It had been wanting to try this out for a long time… and now it finally found the opportunity, with the keys in hand. How could it not take a spin?
