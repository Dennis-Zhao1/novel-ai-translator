**Chapter 1: The Dream Weaver**

"Once your hair grows long enough to reach your waist, will you marry me?"

In a state of deep meditation, Venerable White was blissfully unaware of the world outside, completely detached from the events occurring around him.

At that moment, Venerable White found himself at the heart of a vast, endless desert. Surrounding him were vivid scenes that flickered like 3D projections. 

There were images of serene cultivation sanctuaries, bizarre and monstrous beasts, fierce battles among powerful cultivators, and wondrous treasures from various disciplines.

These images flashed rapidly before him, only to vanish just as quickly.

Beyond this circle of 3D projections lay the seemingly infinite desert, which expanded and expanded in response to Venerable White's thoughts.

A single thought could birth a myriad of worlds; a single thought could extinguish them.

Once a cultivator reached the seventh rank of Spirit Master, their introspective musings could manipulate the spiritual energy within them, causing powerful effects in the real world—creating a "virtual reality" that attached to the real while transcending it.

This "virtual reality" was akin to an illusion, but far superior.

It was false, for its essence did not exist in the world.

Yet, it felt incredibly real... You could reach out and touch everything within this "virtual reality," and it would feel no different from the tangible world.

In ancient times, a seventh-rank Spirit Master pondering a question inadvertently conjured a massive mirage, transforming it into a thriving town populated by countless humans who lived and interacted within it. However, once the Master’s contemplation ended, the grand mirage dissipated, giving rise to numerous legends of "ghost towns."

One of the most famous tales about "virtual reality" dates back to ancient times.

There was a mid-sized sect called "Bishui Pavilion," led by the gentle and kind Chu Fairy, a sixth-rank True Monarch. Under her leadership, the entire sect lived a peaceful, conflict-free existence.

However, one day, Bishui Pavilion became embroiled in a large-scale conflict among sects. Overnight, it was annihilated, with no survivors except for Sect Leader Chu Fairy.

In her despair, Chu Fairy ascended to the rank of seventh-rank Spirit Master.

With her overwhelming feelings of near despair, she drew upon her internal spiritual energy to construct a complete "Bishui Pavilion," where the disciples continued to live as they had before—engaging in laughter, hard work, and a life free from strife.

Centuries later, several cultivators unwittingly stumbled into "Bishui Pavilion," where they were warmly welcomed by the disciples. These five cultivators were completely unable to discern that this was merely "virtual reality." It wasn't until they returned to their own sects and mentioned "Bishui Pavilion" that they learned the truth from their sect's records.

—Chu Fairy had been living in a dream she had woven herself.

With a single thought, a myriad of worlds could come into being. As long as a seventh-rank Spirit Master wished for it, their conjured "people, events, and objects" could even exist for an extended duration in reality.

However, no matter how real a fantasy feels, it remains a fantasy. Even if you can physically touch it and feel its warmth and vitality, it is ultimately an illusion...

Venerable White's current state mirrored this concept.

While in meditation, he inadvertently recalled many past events, which his powerful spiritual energy shaped into overlapping layers of "virtual reality" around him.

Among these projections lay a precious memory from the deepest recesses of his mind, manifesting as the immense desert, intertwining with the real world.

The desert, the white horse, and the young man in a blue robe; these were the memories of Venerable White's youth...

As long as Venerable White remained in seclusion and did not withdraw his thoughts, the desert and the projections surrounding him would not fade away.

Dou Dou understood this well, which is why he lay there, waiting for Venerable White to finish his meditation.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Scholar Song had become numb, lying in the sand and gasping for breath.

The young man in the blue robe riding the white horse had come to him seven times, ranging from "fist techniques" to "sword techniques," "staff techniques," "spear techniques," "leg techniques," and "whip techniques."

Each time, the young man found new ways to challenge him, though… he had indeed gained a lot from these encounters.

"Seven times is enough, right?" Scholar Song murmured.

Just then, the delightful sound of jingling bells echoed again—a young man in a blue robe leading a white horse approached from afar…

Here he comes again! What will he want to do this time?

"Little White, where did you run off to earlier? I thought you'd gotten lost," the blue-robed youth cheerfully exclaimed, repeating his usual line.

Then, he pulled the horse aside and said to Scholar Song, "Little White, shall we practice with hammers today?"

As he spoke, he retrieved two large hammers from the back of the horse.

Hammers? Why is a cultivator practicing with hammers? What sect does this style belong to? It’s terrible!

As these thoughts raced through his mind, Scholar Song stretched out his hand, saying, "I can't do it anymore; I'm too tired. Can we take a break?"

He had thought the blue-robed youth would just toss him a hammer and start swinging at him, forcing him to fight back.

To his surprise, the blue-robed youth looked puzzled. "Take a break?"

Then he tossed the two large hammers aside and ran over to Scholar Song, his face lighting up with excitement. "So Little White wants to take a break too? Then let's rest for a while!"

What the heck… So “take a break” is the magic phrase?

The blue-robed youth sat down beside Scholar Song, grinning and silent, seemingly enjoying the brief moment of leisure.

They sat together for about ten minutes when the blue-robed youth suddenly turned to Scholar Song and exclaimed, "Little White, you really are good-looking!"

Scholar Song felt a chill run down his spine! Even though he knew the blue-robed youth was addressing "Little White" and not him directly, being looked at with such fervor while being told "you're good-looking" still sent shivers all over his body.

"Little White, once your hair grows long enough to reach your waist, will you marry me?" the blue-robed youth suddenly asked.

"Absolutely not!" Scholar Song flatly rejected.

"Really? That won't work? Then how about you grow your hair long? I bet it would look amazing!" The blue-robed youth, undeterred, continued.

"No way, absolutely not!" Scholar Song crossed his arms and shouted once more.

"Can we? That would be great! I can't wait to see what you look like with long hair!" The blue-robed youth exclaimed, his face filled with joy.

… So, the blue-robed youth wasn’t even talking to Scholar Song at all.

From beginning to end, he had been chatting with someone named "Little White."

Scholar Song felt utterly exasperated, as though he were being mocked by Dou Dou.

However, as he scrutinized the blue-robed youth more closely, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this young man bore a striking resemblance to Venerable White.

……

……

"Ah-choo! Who's cursing me?" Dou Dou rubbed his nose and stretched. Meanwhile, the blue-robed youth was energetically hammering away at him, making rhythmic "clang, clang, clang" sounds like a blacksmith at work.

Dou Dou let out a pleased sigh: "Left a bit more, left a bit more… oh—yes, just like that—put a little more strength into it—ah, that’s the spot!"

……

……

On the other side.

Tang Tang from the Empty Thief Sect was still in a frenzy, shouting, "Come on! Let's do this! I'm taking you on!"

Her remarkable Shadowless Hand technique was performing exceptionally well, seemingly gaining the upper hand.

"Hehe, Little White, you're so strong," the blue-robed youth said, although he was at a disadvantage, he remained calm and collected, pressing on steadily.

"Little White, your sister! Little White, your sister!" Tang Tang screamed in frustration.

"Hehe, Little White, I'm going to counterattack!" The blue-robed youth suddenly switched from defense to offense, gaining ground as they battled fiercely.

Scholar Song could only watch as Master Tang burst into tears.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile.

On the roof of a building opposite the Alchemical Sage's residence stood two figures.

One was the sharply dressed Master Jing Mo, while beside him stood Elder Chen from the Wuji Demon Sect.

Master Jing Mo gazed intently at the Alchemical Sage's building and asked in a low voice, "Is that the place?"

"Yes, Master. That’s where ‘Scholar Song’ and his senior are temporarily residing. There's a barrier formation around it, indicating it's their stronghold," Elder Chen replied cautiously.

Yesterday, Master Jing Mo had flown overnight to the Jiangnan region, directly bringing him here via sword.

"Additionally, our intelligence has confirmed that the ‘Sunflower Cultivator’ has met their demise. The last trace of the Sunflower Cultivator was found in a small alley, where signs of a battle were evident. They vanished from there, leaving no further clues."

Elder Chen provided a detailed account of recent developments.

Finally, he took out a key and handed it to Master Jing Mo. "Lastly, Master, this is the key to that building."

This was the key to the Alchemical Sage's residence—the lock had been broken by Venerable White, and Scholar Song had called someone to repair it.

The spies from the Wuji Demon Sect had secretly tampered with the repair crew, obtaining a duplicate key.

Master Jing Mo accepted the key, nodding. "You’ve done well. We’ll leave now. Once my true essence recovers a bit, we'll go test the waters."

Elder Chen breathed a sigh of relief—he was spared from a sudden outburst of rage from the Master.

"Let's go." Master Jing Mo took Elder Chen and soared away, disappearing into the Jiangnan region.

……

……

However, Elder Chen remained oblivious as Master Jing Mo discreetly dropped a puppet along with the key as they departed.

Once Master Jing Mo and Elder Chen flew off into the distance, the puppet transformed, taking on the appearance of Master Jing Mo.

This was not his true self, merely a tool linked to his senses. It functioned similarly to a modern "drone," albeit with even more capabilities.

The puppet, now resembling Master Jing Mo, adjusted its form and descended from the building, making its way to the Alchemical Sage's residence.

Upon arriving at the entrance, it paused to scan the surroundings. Then, it swiftly retrieved the key and opened the door, slipping inside.

The next moment, as it turned around, Master Jing Mo was left completely dumbfounded...
