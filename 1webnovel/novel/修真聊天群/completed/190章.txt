**Bungee Jumping of the Cultivator and the Selfie of Venerable White**

As long as you circulate your vital energy to your index finger and draw a 'Thunder Symbol' in the palm of your other hand, then activate that symbol with your spiritual power, you can unleash a powerful 'Palm Thunder'! 

And the best part? The 'Thunder Symbol' is super easy to draw—just seven simple strokes.

Sounds simple, right?

However, if you want to use Palm Thunder… first, you need to have vital energy in your body, then you need to know how to draw the Thunder Symbol, and you also need to control your spiritual power.

Otherwise, all bets are off!

But as long as you meet those requirements, any cultivator who has opened their 'spiritual apertures' and has enough vital energy in their body should be able to unleash two bursts of Palm Thunder. 

For someone like Scholar Song, who has a decent foundation in body refinement techniques, he should be able to summon four to five bursts of Palm Thunder just from his own vital energy. Plus, with the extra spiritual energy from the Phantom Spirit, generating ten bursts is definitely within reach.

Under Venerable White's guidance, Scholar Song learned how to draw the 'Thunder Symbol'. He then drew one in the palm of his left hand, using his vital energy, and activated the power within the symbol with the 'True Self Meditation Scripture'.

“Palm Thunder!” he shouted softly!

The Thunder Symbol in his palm suddenly began to heat up, and a golden bolt of lightning appeared in his hand, crackling and popping.

The lightning wasn’t very big, about the size of a small bowl, but it looked quite imposing!

Scholar Song cautiously asked, “Venerable White, this won’t backfire on me, will it?”

“Don't worry! As long as you don't touch this Palm Thunder with your other hand, you’ll be fine!” Venerable White chuckled.

“How powerful is it?” Scholar Song inquired further.

Venerable White pointed to a nearby rock. “Try it out and see for yourself.”

Scholar Song walked over to the rock and pressed his left palm against it.

Boom!

A basketball-sized hole was blasted into the rock, but Scholar Song didn’t feel much of a recoil! This was the 'small power' that Venerable White had mentioned? This was already pretty terrifying!

Even if he pressed it against a ferocious beast, it could easily take its life.

“Lightning techniques are extremely effective against ghostly beings. Even a second-tier ghost general would be reduced to ashes after taking a hit from Palm Thunder,” Venerable White explained.

Effective against ghostly beings? Scholar Song’s mind raced. After the exam tomorrow, he was planning to head over to the Luo Xin district in the neighboring city. A confrontation with the 'Altar Master' and his remaining forces was inevitable, and since the Altar Master was a ghost cultivator, he would definitely encounter ghostly beings.

With the Palm Thunder to protect him, along with the 'Evil-Breaking Symbol' he had from before, his chances of success just went up!

“Thank you, Venerable White.” Scholar Song understood this was a gesture of kindness from his senior.

Venerable White nodded slightly. “Try again, and master the Palm Thunder completely!”

Scholar Song nodded and drew the Thunder Symbol in his palm once more, activating it with his spiritual power, and shouted, “Palm Thunder!”

Another bolt of lightning appeared in his palm, crackling away.

This time, Scholar Song didn’t immediately hurl it out but instead stared at it intently—he really had conjured a ball of lightning from his palm! What a magical sight!

As the lightning crackled, his heart began to race with excitement, flooding him with exhilaration!

Uncontrollably, he recalled some memories from long ago—memories he had deliberately buried. Yet today, they resurfaced because of the Palm Thunder.

“Look at my Thousand Birds!”

“I’m not scared; I have Thunder Slash!”

“Ha! You fools! My Thunder God Palm is way better than yours! Thunder God’s palm technique, crackle, crackle…”

Ah, die! Die! Die!

Ah, fool! Fool! Fool!

Why am I remembering these things again?

So embarrassing! So embarrassing! I want to die! I want to die! I want to forget! I want to forget! Why can’t I just erase these memories that make me feel so ashamed? I really wish I could turn my brain into a hard drive, so I could just toss away these embarrassing pasts into the recycling bin!

Scholar Song shook his head vigorously to rid his mind of those thoughts.

He focused again on the lightning ball in his palm.

It looked so cool!

Crackle, crackle—it felt like a dream. He never thought he would be able to unleash lightning from his palm one day; it was something only achievable in dreams… Oh no, now he was thinking about it again!

Scholar Song raised his hand and slammed it against the rock again, as if he wanted to obliterate those embarrassing memories along with this strike!

Boom!

Another basketball-sized pit appeared in the rock…

“Phew!” He let out a deep breath.

Venerable White curiously asked, “Did you encounter some inner demons just now?”

“No, I just remembered some memories I thought I had forgotten,” Scholar Song rubbed his face. “Regrettable past!”

“Oh, that kind of memory everyone has. Sometimes, what you think are regrettable pasts may turn into beautiful memories as time goes by,” Venerable White comforted him with the wisdom of experience.

Scholar Song nodded.

Then, for some reason, he blurted out, “For instance—little Bai, when your hair reaches your waist, will you marry me?”

“Ha?” Venerable White turned to him, a sudden gust of wind blowing, making his long black hair dance in the breeze.

Scholar Song suddenly felt something was off. Wait, what did I just say?

At that moment, Venerable White's radiant smile lit up the air like a fairy in the wind. In an instant, everything around dimmed.

In Scholar Song's eyes, the entire world turned black and white. Only Venerable White, with his flowing black hair and brilliant smile, shone in color. Everything revolved around him, highlighting his infinite charm.

This feeling… lasted for about two breaths.

Venerable White retracted his smile and blinked.

“Let’s go back,” he said, waving his sleeve, causing his flying sword to glide out and turn into a beam of light beneath his feet.

“Oh.” Scholar Song dazedly followed him, stepping onto the light.

……

……

On the way back, Venerable White remained silent, carrying Scholar Song back to the Alchemical Sage's building.

They flew and flew… Scholar Song felt like he had just made a huge mistake.

Speaking of which, why did it feel like Venerable White was flying higher and higher? The houses below were shrinking to the size of fingernails!

“Scholar Song, a few days ago, I was watching CCTV— the program about cultural oddities, and I saw people enjoying bungee jumping. I think it’s so interesting!” Venerable White said.

Scholar Song immediately replied seriously, “No, Venerable White! It’s not interesting at all! Bungee jumping is just something a bunch of bored people do to seek thrills and get close to death! It’s a pointless activity!”

I must correct my senior’s warped worldview!

“I want to give it a try!” Venerable White said earnestly. “Let’s try it, shall we?”

“No, really not a good idea!” Scholar Song exclaimed loudly.

“Hmm!” Venerable White nodded.

Suddenly, he stopped the beam of light beneath them.

Then, he grabbed Scholar Song, and they both ‘whooshed’ downward.

“Ahhhhhhh!” Scholar Song screamed—yes, Scholar Song was afraid of heights; he had a fear of heights. He was the kind of man who planned to install a railing on his flying sword!

“Hehehe!” Venerable White giggled with delight.

At the same time, he executed a move similar to a thousand-pound drop.

Scholar Song felt himself plummeting even faster, the sound of air rushing past him as he fell… and that terrifying sensation of weightlessness!

“Ahhhhh!” Scholar Song screamed even louder.

“Should we go faster?” Venerable White asked cheerfully.

“Puh puh—” Scholar Song shook his head wildly, unable to produce any coherent words due to the pressure of the fall.

“Alright! Then let’s go faster!” Venerable White’s spiritual power surged as he pulled Scholar Song down at an even greater speed.

He even thought the position wasn’t exhilarating enough, so he turned them upside down…

“Ah… Ahhhhhh!” Scholar Song felt like his throat was about to go hoarse from screaming.

……

……

“By the way, let’s take a picture!” Venerable White suddenly said mid-fall. Then, he pulled out a phone from nowhere, using his spiritual power to shield it from the pressure of their descent.

“Come on, Scholar Song, smile!” Venerable White said, lifting the phone and setting it to selfie mode.

Scholar Song saw his face on the screen, contorted in horror for various reasons, with tears welling in his eyes, looking like a complete mess.

Nooo— Scholar Song shook his head desperately.

“Click!” Venerable White took several photos in quick succession.

Then he said, “This won’t do, Scholar Song. You’re not cooperating at all!”

“Ahhhh!” Scholar Song continued to scream.

“Let’s try again, this time cooperate a bit. If the photos don’t turn out well, we’ll jump again; we must get a satisfactory shot,” Venerable White said with a serious expression.

What? Jump again? Just kill me already!

“Cooperate, come on, smile! One, two, three! Cheese!” Venerable White adjusted the selfie angle again.

On the phone screen, he and Scholar Song were upside down, behind them an endless starry sky, perfectly capturing the moment of their high-altitude bungee jump!

Scholar Song tried to stretch his face into a smile, but with the pressure he was under, the smile was the ugliest he could muster.

Click, click. Venerable White snapped several more photos and said, “Hmm, alright, it’s not great, but let’s keep it for now.”

Scholar Song finally exhaled, then opened his mouth… and continued to scream: “Aahhhhhh!”

“Stop screaming; we’re almost home,” Venerable White said. By now, they could see the Alchemical Sage’s building, only about a hundred meters from the ground.

“Ahhhhhh!” This time, Scholar Song was truly on the verge of tears—Venerable White, it’s precisely because we’re about to hit the ground that I’m screaming even more!

We’re going to crash! We’re going to crash!

“Let’s accelerate for the last bit!” Venerable White seemed to be in a playful mood today, his spiritual power surging behind him as he pulled Scholar Song down, making it feel like they were equipped with jet propulsion!

Scholar Song felt his vision dimming.

Fifty meters!

Thirty meters!

Ten meters!

Eight meters!

Three meters! Venerable White showed no signs of stopping!

Venerable White, are you really going to crash us into the ground? You’re powerful enough, but I’m just a first-tier cultivator with two apertures! If we hit the ground, I’ll turn into meat paste!

“Ahhhhhh!” Scholar Song screamed even louder.

Inside the building, Dou Dou and the Sugar Lord of the Thieves were already at the window, watching Scholar Song’s descent—they had started enjoying the show when Scholar Song was still five hundred meters up!

Two meters!

One meter!

Half a meter!

Point four meters!

Point three meters! No, I, Scholar Song, am really going to die on July 4, 2019!

“Whoosh!” At that moment, a sudden screeching sound, like brakes being applied, echoed.

Then… Scholar Song felt himself gently placed on the ground, without any impact at all, landing safely.

“Hahaha!” Venerable White burst into laughter. “Wasn’t that exciting?”

“Eh heh heh heh.” Scholar Song looked utterly exhausted, forcing a laugh.

“Seems like you find it fun too! Hehe, I’m going to send these photos to the group album now,” Venerable White said, chuckling as he fiddled with his phone.

Scholar Song weakly raised his hand, internally screaming, “Please no!”

But after that long scream, his throat was hoarse, and he couldn’t utter a single word.

“Done!” Venerable White pressed send.

……

……

In the Ninefold Land Group, the group space.

A series of photos appeared in the group album.

All of them showed Scholar Song and Venerable White bungee jumping together, with Scholar Song's face twisted in terror at first, then forcing a smile in the later ones. Meanwhile, Venerable White, as always, looked stunning, with an ethereal charm.

Photo caption: “Just had an exhilarating bungee jump with Scholar Song! It was so much fun. Scholar Song claims he enjoyed it, and I plan to jump again in a few days!”

Moments later… the group exploded with likes.

Lychee Fairy: Venerable White still looks gorgeous~ So envious!

Alchemical Sage: Venerable White knows how to have fun. P.S.: I’m Jiang Ziyan.

Master of Snow Wolf Cavern: Venerable White knows how to have fun!

The Dharma King of Creation: Venerable White knows how to have fun! Everyone, line up!

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain: Scholar Song, you got this! Here’s a tearful emoji.

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain increasingly felt that Scholar Song was so dedicated, diving into danger every day! A big red envelope is definitely in order!

Master of Seven Life Talismans: Venerable White knows how to have fun; Scholar Song is so cute.

Indeed, such a devoted Scholar Song, risking it all for his senior, was just too adorable. If Venerable White emerged from seclusion again, and Scholar Song was still alive, this task would undoubtedly fall on him!

Phantom Spirit Fay Yu: Huh? Bungee jumping? Does Scholar Song like it? Then I’ll come along next time! It’s a date! @Scholar Song!

Scholar Song trembled as he pulled out his phone, hastily opening the Ninefold Land Group to see what photos Venerable White had posted.

He quickly saw Fay Yu's comment.

Scholar Song’s eyes went dark.

July 4, 2019… Scholar Song, RIP!
