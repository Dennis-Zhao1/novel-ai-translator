**Jiang Ziyan**

One day, I will be able to cast all kinds of spells like my seniors, right? Scholar Song thought to himself.

At that moment, the short-haired woman opened her arms, lifted one end of the alchemical furnace, and took a couple of steps forward, frowning slightly.

Thud!

She set the furnace down and turned to glare at Scholar Song.

"Are you Scholar Song?" she raised an eyebrow. "Help me lift this, would you? Helping beautiful ladies in distress is a mandatory lesson for every man!"

“You know me?” Scholar Song asked, puzzled, as he stepped forward to help her lift the alchemical furnace.

The furnace wasn’t overly heavy; it was just that it was a bit large, making it difficult for one person to carry. With two people, it was a breeze.

"Don't ask such stupid questions. You should have realized at a glance the close relationship I have with the Alchemical Sage. It’s perfectly normal to think that I know about you from him," the woman replied flatly.

Who could figure out your relationship with the Alchemical Sage at first glance?!

Scholar Song silently complained and asked, “Close relationship? Are you the Alchemical Sage’s Dao partner?”

“No… for now, I’m just his disciple. Jiang Ziyan, the name I’m using now is one I won’t change for at least the next thirty years.” She seemed a bit happier when Scholar Song mentioned ‘Dao partner’. “I heard the Alchemical Sage is heading to the Jiangnan region for some research, so I had to bring his alchemical furnace over. When he gets into research mode, he doesn’t care about anything else; someone needs to look after his day-to-day needs—like grooming his hair, organizing his clothes, reminding him to cultivate and eat regularly.”

As they spoke, they had already reached the third floor, which was the Alchemical Sage’s temporary alchemical chamber.

The door swung open, revealing a completely refreshed room.

And… a totally refreshed Alchemical Sage.

He no longer looked like the punk he was when Scholar Song first met him, but how could one describe his current appearance?

Let’s start with his hair—it used to be a wild, unkempt explosion, but now it was meticulously styled into dozens of little braids, and… they were all styled in the air!

Counting them, there were easily over twenty little braids sticking out, making the Alchemical Sage's head look like a forest. Many of the little braids were adorned with cute accessories.

Honestly, Scholar Song thought this looked worse than the original wild hair.

The dark circles under his eyes were still there, but this time… they had transformed into a smoky eye look!

Scholar Song could see that with every blink, the dark circles shimmered with a shiny sheen, courtesy of some makeup.

His stomach churned a bit, and he felt like he was going to be sick.

Honestly, the Alchemical Sage’s current look was worse than before—he was way more handsome when he had that punk style; this was just a whole new level of ugly.

Was Jiang Ziyan worried that the Alchemical Sage was too handsome and would get snatched away by other women?

She could rest easy; with the Alchemical Sage’s punk appearance, there was hardly any girl who would go for him.

Seeing Scholar Song, the Alchemical Sage smiled and said, "Oh, Scholar Song, you’ve come. If we count the time, you’re just about right on schedule."

"Eh, Senior, how did you know I was coming this morning?" Scholar Song asked, puzzled.

"Heh, of course. Something must have happened to you last night, right?" The Alchemical Sage wore a mysterious smile.

Sure enough, it was the Alchemical Sage who had protected him last night.

Scholar Song felt certain and replied, "Yes, someone broke into my place last night. They left this handle-less knife behind. There was still a faint scent of blood lingering nearby, and I felt that something was off."

As he spoke, he took out the handle-less thin blade and handed it to the Alchemical Sage.

The Alchemical Sage took the knife, examined it, and then handed it back to Scholar Song. He squinted and asked, "What do you think that intruder wanted?"

Scholar Song replied, "I considered many possibilities, but the most likely one is… they were trying to kill me."

Jiang Ziyan chuckled from the side, "Well, you’re not completely hopeless."

"You guessed correctly. This handle-less knife is soaked with congealed blood, and there’s a lingering resentment left by the deceased. The person wielding it was undoubtedly someone who kills often. To be honest, I didn’t want you to encounter the cruel side of the cultivation world so early. But this is the reality of the cultivation world; the danger doesn’t just come from heavenly tribulations and natural disasters, but also… human disasters. So, Scholar Song, what do you feel about this assassination attempt?" the Alchemical Sage smiled.

Feelings?

There were so many feelings involved; his emotions back then had been complicated!!

Scholar Song thought for a moment before responding, “To be honest, I was a bit frightened at first. I felt my vigilance was lacking; an enemy was right by my bedside, and I didn’t notice a thing. That’s one of the reasons I came to find you, Senior. I want to at least increase my awareness.”

After hesitating for a while, he added a bit shyly, “But later on, I felt a bit… excited.”

“Excited? Hahaha.” The Alchemical Sage burst into laughter. “Scholar Song, you really are a strange fellow.”

To feel excitement about being assassinated is indeed quite odd.

“Oddball,” Jiang Ziyan chimed in.

After laughing, the Alchemical Sage began to explain.

“Last night, I secretly placed a miniature formation on you. I apologize for acting without your consent. The formation I set up provides some defensive capabilities and reacts to attacks from cultivators. Moreover, it includes a special medicine that I’ve refined myself. Just a heads up, this medicine is one of my proud creations. Ahem…” The Alchemical Sage felt a little shy about having placed the formation without permission, even if his intention was to protect him.

“But last night, that formation was triggered, and the medicine leaked out.”

The only ones capable of triggering that formation were cultivators, specifically those with malicious intent.

“To be honest, I didn’t think that formation would ever be useful. I always believed that those trailing behind me would have at least some sense. But now it seems I overestimated them. They are like mad dogs, biting wildly. I’m truly sorry, Scholar Song, for causing you some trouble.”

The Alchemical Sage believed the ones who had attacked Scholar Song were the same ones who had been following him. Because beyond that, he couldn’t think of any other cultivator who would attack a novice like Scholar Song.

Jiang Ziyan spoke up with a smile, “But it’s fine. The person who broke into your room last night will never appear before you again.”

So, that means the assassin from last night is dead?

“Would you find it cruel, Scholar Song? But this is the reality of the cultivation world. I know you’re a kind… good person. But don’t let your kindness and mercy extend to your enemies. That’s a warning from a senior.” The Alchemical Sage said solemnly.

Scholar Song was a good person; this was clear from his ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’. So the Alchemical Sage was a bit worried he might show mercy toward his enemies, which could easily lead to harm for himself and others.

Good people are great, but naive good people can be dangerous.

“Don’t worry, Senior. While I may truly be a good person, I’m definitely not the kind of savior who takes it upon himself to save the world. I believe that for enemies, the best kind of enemy is a dead one,” Scholar Song replied seriously after some thought.

Jiang Ziyan remarked again, “You really are a strange guy.”

The Alchemical Sage nodded with a smile, appreciating that a good person who knows how to adapt is the best kind.

“Also, I should say that I owe my life to the Alchemical Sage’s favor yesterday,” Scholar Song added. “Actually, the people who tried to assassinate me might not only be those tracking you, Senior, but it could also be related to this.”

Scholar Song pulled out the pendant, revealing the Soul-Sealing Ice Orb embedded within it.

“This was my reward from helping Fay Yu last time… the Phantom Spirit.”
