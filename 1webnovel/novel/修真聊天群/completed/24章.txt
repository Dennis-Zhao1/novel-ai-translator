**Scholar Song Receives a Big Package**

**9:00 AM.**

Scholar Song and his companion boarded the high-speed train heading to the university town in Jiangnan. They were quite lucky; arriving at J City’s Heixiang Station at 8:45, they just caught the train that was set to leave at 9:00.

The journey was smooth.

By the time they arrived at Jiangnan University Town, it was exactly noon.

"Do you want to come to my place to hang out?" Scholar Song asked out of politeness. As soon as the words left his mouth, he suddenly remembered that Fay Yu wasn’t one of his close friends but rather a girl he had only met the day before. The question felt a bit abrupt.

"Thank you, Senior! I definitely want to hang out when I have time, but right now I need to hurry home and seal this Phantom Spirit contract first. Plus, if I’m late, my dad might come back, and that would be bad," Fay Yu replied with a sweet smile.

Scholar Song chuckled, "Well then, see you! You can take a taxi from the station exit to Jiangnan Airport. You’ll be fine alone, right?"

"Of course! And I already booked my return flight. I just need to get to the airport, and I’ll be back smoothly. By the way, Senior, what’s your mailing address? I still need to send you two boxes of medicinal materials!" Fay Yu suddenly remembered her initial promise.

She was a girl of her word; once she made a promise, she would see it through.

"Um, let’s forget about that for now. We can talk about it later," Scholar Song said, holding the ice pearl in his hand that was said to ‘seal the Phantom Spirit.’ He had a feeling that the medicinal materials Fay Yu mentioned might not be as simple as he had imagined.

"Senior, please don’t make me a person who goes back on their word! We of Spirit Butterfly Island keep our promises!" Fay Yu said earnestly.

"Alright… fine," Scholar Song replied, seeing that he couldn’t refuse. He pulled out his notebook, wrote down his mailing address, and tore off the page to hand it to Fay Yu.

Fay Yu carefully tucked the note away and then waved goodbye to Scholar Song.

He watched her leave, finally feeling a breath of relief.

"Finally done! I guess I won’t have any more connections with this girl, right?" Scholar Song scratched his head and laughed, "Time to head back!"

Little did he know, in the future, Scholar Song would surely be grateful for Fay Yu’s insistence today!

Without her determination to send those two boxes of medicinal materials, Scholar Song’s life would have probably been that of an ordinary person—finishing college, landing a simple job, marrying an average girl, having adorable kids, and leading a mundane life.

Thanks to Fay Yu's support today, Scholar Song's life was about to undergo a monumental transformation.

In the Ninefold Land Group chat.

**Hermit of North River:** "Fay Yu, did you find the Ghost Lantern Temple?"

**Fay Yu of Spirit Butterfly Island (online):** "I found it! Task completed successfully. I’m on my way home now."

"I accidentally went to the wrong place and ended up in Jiangnan’s Luoxin District, but I was lucky to meet a very impressive Senior Song there. He helped me find the Luoxin District in J City and guided me to Ghost Lantern Temple, where I completed the task with his help!"

"Senior Song from the group? What’s his immortal name?" Hermit of North River asked, as there were several members with the surname Song in the group.

"Ah!" Fay Yu sent a sticking out tongue emoji. "I asked him for his immortal name, but he didn’t tell me. I completely forgot to ask afterward, but I do know his secular name is Scholar Song!"

"Scholar Song... that name sounds a bit familiar..." Hermit of North River pondered but couldn’t quite place it. "Haha, anyway, congratulations on completing your task, Fay Yu!"

After all, he had promised to help but ended up not being much help, feeling a bit guilty.

"Thank you, Hermit of North River! You helped me a lot too!" Fay Yu smiled. "I’m getting on the plane now. See you later!"

On the plane, Fay Yu turned off her phone and glanced out the window.

The seniors in the group were all really nice. 

Especially Senior Song; he was truly a good person.

A shiny good person card was firmly bestowed upon Scholar Song, even across mountains and rivers.

**The Next Day.**

**June 4th, Tuesday, scorching heat!**

In Jiangnan University Town, fourteen large fans spun wildly in the lecture hall, but all they did was stir up waves of hot air, making everyone feel even more dizzy.

The teacher lecturing was already drenched in sweat, speaking with noticeably less energy.

Scholar Song sat in the classroom, but surprisingly, amidst the sweltering summer heat, he felt his mind exceptionally clear.

In all the classes he had attended throughout his life, this was the first time he felt so relaxed. He could remember everything the teacher taught after just one hearing and could easily analyze and grasp the key points of knowledge in his mind.

He even had the mental capacity to multitask, listening to the lecture while allowing his thoughts to wander off.

Beside him, a female classmate, who had originally been three seats away, unconsciously moved closer and closer, until she practically wanted to press her curvaceous figure against Scholar Song. A faint scent of perfume wafted into his nose.

This wasn’t a sudden spike in Scholar Song’s charm; it was just that he exuded a refreshing aura amidst the heat, almost like a human air conditioner, making people want to snuggle up to him.

Scholar Song discreetly glanced at the ice pearl hanging around his neck—the very one Fay Yu had given him yesterday. When worn, this pearl automatically dissipated the intense heat around him and formed a cool protective layer close to his body.

Moreover, wearing this pearl made him feel mentally sharp and quick-witted. Even English words that used to take him three or four tries to memorize could now be retained in just one glance and one hearing.

This... was truly a student’s magical artifact! With this, dominating the school would be a piece of cake.

Such a thing was already slightly beyond the realm of scientific explanation.

He recalled the scene from when Fay Yu had sealed the Phantom Spirit.

"Is it really real?" Scholar Song murmured to himself. This amazing ice pearl made him believe a little more in the existence of ‘cultivation.’

Was there really a Phantom Spirit sealed within this pearl?

Is cultivation really not just a myth?

Did immortal beings riding clouds truly exist?

Could mountains be moved and seas be parted?

One question after another flooded Scholar Song’s mind, occupying his thoughts.

If all these things were real... then were the people in the Ninefold Land Group truly extraordinary beings?

He had never felt such a strong urge to check the ‘Ninefold Land Group’ as he did today, wanting to see the chats and find more evidence.

Why was the class still not over? Hurry up and finish, please!

Scholar Song thought to himself.

……

……

Ding ding ding~~~

The bell signaling the break rang out.

The students in the classroom cheered excitedly and rushed out into the hallway to catch some fresh air.

Only the girl next to Scholar Song felt a bit reluctant to leave—she found it genuinely cool beside him, even more comfortable than the air conditioning. Unfortunately, she wasn’t Scholar Song’s girlfriend, so she couldn’t cling to him after class.

Perhaps she should try to become Scholar Song’s girlfriend? She cast a stealthy glance at him. In class, Scholar Song wasn’t the type to stand out, but he actually had quite a masculine charm! How tempting! In this scorching summer, hugging such a cool guy to sleep would be the perfect pillow!

"Hello, is Scholar Song here?" A loud voice rang out from the doorway.

The sound was deafening and immediately captured the attention of all the students.

Scholar Song looked up to see a burly man in a suit, his fierce-looking face oddly adorned with a forced friendly smile.

He didn’t recognize him.

Scholar Song stood up and waved, "That’s me. May I ask who you are and what you need?"

"Ha ha, I’m from Fengshou Express. Two big packages for Scholar Song have been expedited overnight. Since they’re sent by very important clients, you must sign for them personally for them to be valid," the burly man in a suit said, smiling as he respectfully handed a business card to Scholar Song.

Scholar Song took the card and looked.

Fengshou Express Group Co., Ltd., Sima Jiang!

It was a simple card with no job title, just the company name and personal name.

These days, even delivery personnel have business cards?

As he pondered this, a sudden flash of Fay Yu’s shy smile appeared in his mind.
