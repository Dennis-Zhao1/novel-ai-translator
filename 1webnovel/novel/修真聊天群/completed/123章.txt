**Command: Master Tongxuan is the coolest!**

The eldest disciple of the Moon Blade Sect had just received intel from the sect's upper echelons about a certain “descendant of the Su Clan”—Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan, who was a third-tier cultivator but had suffered severe injuries after failing to overcome the heavenly tribulation.

“It’s about time the guys from the Immortal Farmer Sect finally made contact with Sable Sixteen,” he thought to himself. 

It was time for him to complete his mission!

The eldest disciple of the Moon Blade Sect gently touched the guitar case slung over his shoulder. With his recently acquired "Formless Divine Sword" in hand, and the talismans provided by his sect, the task of assassinating Sable Sixteen was bound to be a piece of cake. The plan was already in motion.

Before long, he had arrived at the 19th floor of the Ander Building.

He didn't bother hiding; instead, he walked calmly toward Sable Sixteen's suite like an ordinary passerby.

As he strode down the long corridor, he removed the guitar case from his shoulder. The case opened to reveal an old guitar and the gleaming “Formless Divine Sword” inside!

He reached out, gently grasping the sword, then closed the guitar case and hoisted it back up.

Taking a deep breath, he adjusted his stance. The true energy within his dantian began to stir, gradually gathering towards his feet. He just needed to get closer to his target before unleashing the most powerful strike!

As he approached, the sound of hurried footsteps echoed towards him. Looking up, he noticed a young man carrying a large cardboard box, heading straight towards him.

The box was enormous, obscuring much of the young man's face.

He seemed like an ordinary person, with no discernible aura of a cultivator. Was he a resident of this building?

The eldest disciple of the Moon Blade Sect remained vigilant, shifting slightly to the side. His sole focus was on Sable Sixteen—this was not the time for distractions!

The young man with the cardboard box brushed past him…

Maintaining his focus, the disciple continued towards Sable Sixteen's room.

After walking five or six meters, he heard the young man behind him panting heavily. The young man, dripping with sweat, finally set the large box down on the floor.

The eldest disciple paused briefly but soon dismissed the young man from his mind—he had spotted his target. Sable Sixteen looked pale and was seated on the sofa, recovering her true energy.

She was completely unguarded!

What a heavenly opportunity!

With his eyes gleaming, the eldest disciple tightened his grip on the “Formless Divine Sword” and tossed the guitar case aside.

Killing intent surged!

The true energy he had been accumulating beneath his feet erupted as he lunged forward, ready to unleash an earth-shattering strike to take Sable Sixteen's life!

But he failed to notice that the young man who had been carrying the cardboard box was now behind him, rapidly forming a complex set of hand seals while chanting a spell under his breath.

Just as the eldest disciple was about to launch his attack, the young man shouted at the top of his lungs: “Master Tongxuan is the coolest!”

The sound was deafening…

What the heck?

A wave of confusion washed over the eldest disciple.

But at that moment, the “Formless Divine Sword” in his hand suddenly burst forth with a pale golden light. The sword began to tremble violently!

A tremendous force surged from the blade, as if the sword had come to life and was trying to escape his grasp!

Yanked by this sudden power, the eldest disciple nearly stumbled to the ground. He quickly channeled the true energy beneath his feet to steady himself.

Realizing something was amiss, he instinctively let go, allowing the “Formless Divine Sword” to fly free.

At the same time, he spun around to look back at the young man who had just brushed past him… It had been the young man's shout that triggered the change in the “Formless Divine Sword”!

This glance sent a chill of terror coursing through him.

He saw that the young man had one hand raised in front of his chest, forming a sword-controlling gesture. The other hand was pointed like a sword, and he gently sliced the air in front of him, declaring, “Cut!”

In the air, the “Formless Divine Sword” was still invisible, but the pale golden light emanating from it was unmistakable.

The sword gleamed, moving with the speed of lightning, and descended toward the eldest disciple with lethal intent.

“Sword Control Technique!”

“Fourth-tier cultivator!”

The eldest disciple blurted out.

Only a fourth-tier cultivator could condense their true energy into true essence, allowing them to control flying swords and traverse the skies! This seemingly ordinary young man was a senior fourth-tier cultivator?!

Even more alarming was the fact that… the flying sword in his hand belonged to this fourth-tier cultivator!

That foolish junior brother has set me up!

A flood of thoughts raced through the eldest disciple's mind in an instant.

In the next moment, the black iron sword, mistaken for the “Formless Divine Sword,” struck him squarely in the chest.

There was no avoiding it, no defending against it.

The flying sword’s speed was unparalleled! The moment the word “cut” escaped Scholar Song’s lips, the sword had already reached its target!

Blood sprayed… crimson droplets splattered everywhere.

The black iron sword sank halfway into his body, severing his ribs and injuring his organs. The frail body of a mere second-tier cultivator was no match for the sword's sharpness.

The eldest disciple collapsed to the ground, crying out in agony, “Senior… spare me! I was wrong, senior… please let me go!”

Scholar Song's expression remained calm, completely ignoring the other's pitiful cries. The opposing cultivator's strength far exceeded his; he was no match for the altar master. Scholar Song had to proceed with caution. His left hand maintained the connection with the “black iron flying sword,” while his right hand pointed like a sword, quickly slashing in four directions.

The black iron sword flew from the eldest disciple's wound, blood spraying everywhere. Then, with four swift strikes, it severed all four of his limbs.

“Ah ah ah ah!” The eldest disciple screamed in desperation, reduced to a mere stump of a man, yet unable to resist.

“Return.” In the distance, Scholar Song softly called out, and the black iron sword swayed gently before darting back into his grasp, hovering steadily in the air.

Scholar Song reached out, and the black iron flying sword landed lightly in his hand.

The temporary sword control technique—a failed experimental piece created by Master Tongxuan.

Scholar Song had brushed past the eldest disciple not just by chance but to verify whether the “black iron flying sword” contained the temporary sword control formation left by Master Tongxuan. If it hadn’t, he would have had to resort to using his last two sword talismans. He really wasn’t confident that he could take down the target with just two talismans. He had used three talismans to deal with one poisoned altar master!

Fortunately, the black iron flying sword possessed the “temporary sword control” feature!

As for that last shout, “Master Tongxuan is the coolest!” it was the command to activate the temporary sword control.

Such an embarrassing command! Who would have thought it would come from Master Tongxuan, who practiced the closed-mouth meditation? Perhaps… it was precisely because he had kept his mouth shut for so long that the master became so… ridiculous?

Gently stroking the black iron flying sword, Scholar Song noticed that the spiritual energy left by Master Tongxuan was nearly depleted, and he couldn’t use the sword control technique anymore.

Scholar Song’s mind wandered back to the extraordinary experience of wielding the sword. Striking down an enemy from a thousand miles away was simply indescribably wonderful!

An overwhelming desire surged within him.

Fourth-tier cultivator, sword control technique!

Having experienced the “temporary sword control technique” was like watching a trailer for an amazing movie; it left him itching to see the full feature immediately.

At this moment, Scholar Song couldn't help but yearn to become a fourth-tier cultivator himself, to ride the flying sword and soar through the skies!

…

…

Inside the room, Sable Sixteen stood up, her pale face regaining some color.

She approached the eldest disciple of the Moon Blade Sect and asked, “Speak! Who are you? Why did you want to kill me?”

She had sensed the murderous intent just moments before.

Initially, she had thought this person was working with the uncle from the Immortal Farmer Sect, but now it seemed that wasn’t the case. The Immortal Farmer Sect had aimed to capture her alive, seeking to avenge Aqi.

Yet this assassin was intent on killing her.
