**Chapter Title: The Return of White Venerable**

“Don’t worry, I’ll take care of the matchmaking!” 

Amidst the swirling smoke, Scholar Song's calm eyes fixed on Doudou. “You’re saying someone hacked your account?”

“Yes! Trust me! It’s been Ouyang Xianzi chatting with you all along! Just reading your conversations makes me cringe—how could I chat with a guy like you?” Doudou blurted out, desperate to reveal the truth for the sake of his own dignity.

“Hahaha.” Scholar Song let out a bitter laugh, the smoke around him thickening. “Doudou, you don’t need to comfort me.”

“What?” Doudou was puzzled.

Scholar Song exhaled smoke from his nostrils again, “Honestly, I’ve thought about it. You’re right. A guy like me, chasing a little Pekingese all over the place, how could any girl possibly like me?”

“Scholar Song, you’re underestimating your charm! In fact, there’s a fairy waiting for you in silence! If you don’t believe me, just send her a text!” Doudou urged loudly. “Look, my phone is broken and I’m tied up here. Hurry and send a message to your ‘darling.’ If she replies, it proves I’m right!”

Scholar Song's hand holding the pipe froze for a moment, a flicker of hope appearing in his eyes.

Then, he pulled out his phone and carefully typed: “Are you there?”

Never before had he felt such excitement and anxiety over sending such a mundane message.

The text was sent!

Five minutes later...

In the chat app, Ouyang Xianzi’s account showed ‘online,’ yet there was no reply.

In the past, she would have definitely replied within five minutes—if only with a smiley face.

“Haha.” Scholar Song let out a dry laugh and turned back to Doudou, smoke billowing from his mouth and nostrils. Doudou was clearly toying with him!

Doudou was speechless.

“By the way, just call her! You have her number, right? Ask her directly!” Doudou shouted.

This time, Scholar Song remained silent. He simply opened his contacts, found ‘Ouyang Yuan,’ and clicked to dial.

Then, familiar sounds of a guqin resonated through the phone.

The melody played over and over, but the call never connected!

“Haha.” Scholar Song took a deep drag from his pipe, exhaling a plume of smoke. This time, not just from his mouth and nostrils, but even from his ears, enveloping his entire face in a fog.

Doudou felt like crying.

This was definitely a trap, a complete setup!

“Why is this happening?!” he thought in despair. “I don’t want to date Scholar Song! I absolutely don’t! Someone help me!”

...

Just then, a figure flew swiftly towards Doudou, the little monk, and Scholar Song’s group.

“Hey? Doudou, you guys got caught?” The figure landed gracefully, sword in hand, a smile spreading across their face.

It was none other than White Venerable.

Clearly acquainted with Scholar Song, White Venerable paused and teased, “Looks like you’ve gotten yourself into trouble.”

Doudou looked up at White Venerable—sure enough, their bad luck all along was because White Venerable was chasing after them!

But no matter who arrived, as long as they could save him, that was all that mattered.

“White Venerable!” Doudou cried out, “Please save me!”

White Venerable chuckled, “Save you? I’m here to take you back!”

“Taking me back is fine! No matter what, I’ll go with you!” Doudou exclaimed loudly.

White Venerable raised an eyebrow. “What happened?”

Scholar Song let out a puff of smoke from his nostrils and opened his mouth, yet no words came out.

“Doudou? What trouble have you caused this time?” White Venerable turned to Doudou and inquired.

Doudou opened his mouth again—yet didn’t know where to begin.

“Why don’t I explain, Senior?” At that moment, a demon hunter girl who had been standing by Scholar Song raised her hand.

With enthusiasm, she began to explain the situation’s origin, development, and outcome to White Venerable.

...

“Doudou, when you get home tonight, write me a thousand-word apology letter. I’ll personally deliver it to Scholar Song,” White Venerable said lightly.

Doudou swallowed hard—write a thousand words with his paws? Was he joking? How could a dog write?

He was about to protest, but when he saw the serene expression on White Venerable’s face, he couldn’t muster the will to resist.

“Also… Scholar Song, let me see your phone,” White Venerable extended his hand.

Scholar Song hurriedly extinguished his pipe and cautiously handed his phone to White Venerable.

Throughout the process, he didn’t dare to look White Venerable in the eye—his leader, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, had always demonstrated White Venerable’s charm to everyone.

White Venerable scrolled through Scholar Song’s phone and asked, “Which sect does your partner belong to?”

“She’s a disciple from Baiyun Academy, Ouyang Yuan,” Scholar Song replied stiffly.

“Baiyun Academy, I remember. Just wait a moment,” White Venerable said, opening the phone’s contact list.

After a moment, he dialed a number—ever since he decided to hold the ‘Hand-Pulled Tractor Race,’ he had been reconnecting with his old friends.

Once the call connected, White Venerable spoke, “Hello, Henghuo Zhenjun?”

“Oh, it’s Senior White! What can I do for you?” came a polite voice from the other end.

“Henghuo Zhenjun, is there a female cultivator named Ouyang Yuan at Baiyun Academy?”

“Oh, you mean Teacher Ouyang Yuan? Do you have business with her?” Henghuo Zhenjun asked.

White Venerable replied, “I’d like to know what she’s up to right now.”

Henghuo Zhenjun, though curious about why White Venerable was inquiring about Ouyang Yuan, responded, “Teacher Ouyang Yuan is currently teaching her disciples guqin, so she’s not available to talk. If you have something to ask, I can relay it for you?”

“No need, it’s fine. That’ll be all, goodbye!” White Venerable said briskly.

“Sure.” Though Henghuo Zhenjun felt a bit confused, he remained calm—true cultured cultivators from the Confucian sect always maintained composure, never panicking. But sometimes, their personalities could be quite exasperating!

After hanging up, White Venerable turned to Scholar Song and said, “Your partner is currently teaching students… If you trust me, try contacting her again in a few hours.”

Scholar Song nodded stiffly, still wearing a bitter smile—he was still worried. What if all the sweet talk he had experienced was just a setup by Doudou? If Ouyang Yuan was unaware of this and he managed to contact her later, what would happen?

White Venerable glanced at Scholar Song and could see the worried look on his face, understanding his thoughts.

“Here’s the deal: I’ll guarantee you that even if there are issues between you and Ouyang Yuan, I’ll help you reconnect later. I have plenty of experience in matchmaking,” White Venerable smiled.

After all, ever since he emerged from seclusion, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain had helped White Venerable and Scholar Song numerous times. Helping Scholar Song with matchmaking was a small task.

Moreover, White Venerable was indeed experienced in matchmaking—though… unexpected situations often arose when he did. For instance, both parties might develop feelings for someone else during his efforts...

With White Venerable’s guarantee, Scholar Song’s expression brightened significantly.

...

After resolving the matter, White Venerable turned to the bound Doudou and the little monk. “Alright, Doudou, Guoguo, it’s time to go home.”

Then, he produced two disposable flying swords, formed a sword gesture, and the swords hovered steadily in the air.

Next, White Venerable stretched out his hand, and Doudou and the little monk were pulled over, their chains automatically loosening.

“Choose a flying sword and hop on—I’ll take you both home,” White Venerable said with a gentle smile.

The oblivious little monk, Guoguo, smiled adorably and climbed onto one of the flying swords!

Doudou immediately recognized the disposable flying swords—these were the ones White Venerable used to send things on ‘space tours’!

What was White Venerable planning? Was he going to toss him into space?

“White Venerable, I can fly back on my own, don’t worry! I won’t escape this time!” Doudou quickly protested.

“Shh, don’t talk too much,” White Venerable replied, raising his index finger.

Then, he grabbed Doudou and tossed him onto the other flying sword. “Hold on tight.”

Before Doudou could protest, White Venerable performed a sword gesture. “Off you go!”

With a whoosh, the two disposable flying swords shot forward at an incredible speed. In the blink of an eye, they were just two black dots in the distance.

“Ahhhhhhhhhh...” This was the little monk’s delightful scream, high-pitched and clear.

“Woof woof woof woof woof...” This was Doudou’s panicked yelp. Although this speed was bearable, Doudou felt like he was being launched into the universe... he couldn’t help but scream.

At the very least, could he have an oxygen tank?

As for jumping off the flying sword? Don’t joke—there was no option to get off once you boarded White Venerable’s disposable flying sword—just ask the big snake demon who had once offended White Venerable and was sent into space!

“Goodbye, Scholar Song. I’ll contact you in a few days,” White Venerable waved at Scholar Song, then leaped onto his ‘Meteor Sword,’ instantly catching up with Doudou and the little monk.

Scholar Song stood there, dumbfounded.

The demon hunter girl next to him blinked—she felt that the senior just now was really cool!

On the airplane, Scholar Song vaguely dreamed of that bustling island in the sky and the magnificent city above the clouds!
