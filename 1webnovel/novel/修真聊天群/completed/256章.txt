**The Threads of Cause and Effect, Sky City!**

Who knows, maybe this organization doesn’t even have any self-defense skills? That’s why Mistress Scallion is such a failure, unable to utilize even a fraction of her three hundred years of demonic power.

Just as Scholar Song was lost in thought, the monster organization suddenly approached Mistress Scallion, claiming they wanted to teach her their "ultimate skills"! 

Oh wow, they actually have ultimate skills?

Scholar Song's interest piqued immediately—after all those years of being a scallion, it seemed like he finally reaped some rewards today!

That Mistress Scallion might still be so useless after three hundred years could very well mean she hadn’t taken learning these "ultimate skills" seriously! If that’s the case, then it’s up to me, Scholar Song, to master these skills in a dream and make them flourish!

Scholar Song perked up his ears, ready to listen to the ‘Elder of Transmission’ impart the monster organization’s ‘forbidden ultimate skills’!

The Elder of Transmission pulled out a thick book and began to introduce its contents.

The skills were titled "Two Hundred Essential Skills for Fairies to Survive Strongly," written in a language that Scholar Song couldn’t comprehend. The table of contents looked impressively long.

This title is a bit underwhelming, isn’t it? It doesn’t sound like the name of a world-shattering divine technique at all, Scholar Song thought, filled with concern.

Perhaps... it’s just the name that’s lackluster; the content might be powerful! He reassured himself.

Then, the Elder of Transmission started introducing the skills.

The content was truly colorful, featuring active attack skills like "Holy Theft Technique," "How to Successfully Team Up to Rob Human Cultivators," "Five Hundred Ways to Surrender When Unable to Defeat Human Cultivators," and "Charming Techniques of Beautiful Female Fairies."

Defensive skills included: "How Female Fairies Can Successfully Become the Mistress of Their Male Masters and Engage in Palace Schemes Thirteen Ways" and "Seventy-Two Ways for Male Fairies to Win the Favor of Their Female Masters and Successfully Kick Their Partners to the Curb!" 

Scholar Song was utterly overwhelmed. 

What the heck is this garbage ultimate skill?!

No wonder when I met this Mistress Scallion, she seemed a bit silly and behaved oddly. Especially that “Charming Techniques of Beautiful Female Fairies” move—it practically screamed, “Come on, let’s get it on!”

So, this is all the fault of that monster organization!

Scholar Song was completely despondent.

After experiencing life as a scallion for so long and suffering countless hardships, was this the useless “fairy ultimate skill” he had earned?

“Damn it, die a thousand times! And let me wake up already; I don’t want to continue this dream!”

However... this kind of ‘memory-type’ bizarre dream wasn’t something Scholar Song could just wake from at will.

With no other choice, he had to stand in Mistress Scallion’s shoes and carefully experience her life.

...

In the dream, the innocent Mistress Scallion began to diligently learn every technique listed in “Two Hundred Essential Skills for Fairies to Survive Strongly.” 

She practiced tirelessly, day and night.

If Daoist Chixiao were to see this scene, would he be heartbroken?

He had been hopeful for this little scallion fairy to have an "infinite future." But now, it seemed that future had been completely devoured by a dog.

Moreover... as Mistress Scallion became increasingly skilled in her ‘ultimate skills,’ Scholar Song felt an uneasy premonition swell within him.

Whether human or demon, once one has cultivated to a certain level, they would inevitably need to test their skills against opponents, right?

After going down the mountain, if this scallion fairy found a human cultivator (♂) and unleashed her set of “self-sabotaging” ultimate skills... wouldn’t she just get wrecked?

No way, I’m still ‘inhabiting’ Mistress Scallion’s body and experiencing everything from her first-person perspective!

If she gets wrecked, I’ll feel it too! No, this ending is too cruel!

“Please end this! This brutal dream needs to end now! It’s not too late; wake me up!” Scholar Song’s soul struggled.

But all his struggles were in vain.

...

Time passed, and another year slipped by in the dream.

The moment of despair had arrived—Mistress Scallion believed she had perfected her skills and descended from the mountain.

Then, just as Scholar Song had predicted, she began searching high and low for human cultivators.

Scholar Song sighed, starting to mentally prepare himself—if I were to become a girl and someone forced themselves on me, how would I adjust my mindset?

However... how do I even adjust to this? Scholar Song roared, “Let me out! It’s time to end this; it’s not too late!”

But all his struggles remained futile.

At that moment, after much arduous searching, Mistress Scallion finally found a human monk.

Why did it have to be a monk?!

According to Mistress Scallion’s investigation, this monk was named Jiudeng, with thick eyebrows and big eyes, sporting a very handsome face.

He was slim and tall. When clad in his large monk robe, he looked pitifully thin. However, despite his slender frame, Jiudeng had developed a well-built chest, which his robe couldn’t conceal.

Huh? Wait a minute, is something off here?

Scholar Song was pondering when Mistress Scallion launched her attack on Jiudeng.

First was the “Holy Theft Technique”—then “How to Successfully Team Up to Rob Human Cultivators”—followed by “Five Hundred Ways to Surrender When Unable to Defeat Human Cultivators.”

This set of skills was executed flawlessly, like a textbook example.

But no matter how perfectly she executed the skills, they had no effect on Jiudeng.

Mistress Scallion was clearly at a disadvantage.

Finally, Mistress Scallion gritted her teeth and unleashed the “Charming Techniques of Beautiful Female Fairies.”

As expected, this was a trump card, and its effects were outstanding.

Jiudeng fell for it...

Then she approached and had her way with Mistress Scallion...

It turned out, Scholar Song had described correctly.

Jiudeng was actually a she, which explained the slender frame combined with those developed muscles.

Scholar Song’s gaze froze as he watched everything unfold before him, but he felt an overwhelming sense of relief—though a yuri relationship can’t produce children, he would silently offer his most sincere blessings.

At least he wouldn’t have to consider the psychological adjustments needed after being forced into a situation as a girl.

...

After Jiudeng (♀) had her fun with Mistress Scallion (♀), the two of them fell into a daze.

Scholar Song knew the next part of the plot: Jiudeng would take Mistress Scallion back to the temple and seal her for nearly three hundred years!

“Next, they won’t make me stay sealed for three hundred years too, will they? I’ve been a scallion for way too long! I’ve had enough!” Scholar Song was filled with dread.

However... just then, the visual scene before him shifted.

He was no longer in Mistress Scallion’s first-person perspective.

Scholar Song discovered that his vision floated into the sky—his soul appeared overhead, looking down at Mistress Scallion and Jiudeng from a god-like perspective.

“Finally, is this dream coming to an end?” Scholar Song thought to himself.

This dream, aside from that garbage “Two Hundred Essential Skills for Fairies to Survive Strongly,” left him with nothing.

Oh... perhaps not nothing. At least he realized his patience had improved a lot.

Heh heh heh, no matter who it is, after becoming a scallion and spending decades alone on a mountaintop, one’s patience would surely grow—absolutely!

But the cost of that patience was a bit too steep.

...

Just as Scholar Song was lost in thought again, suddenly, his eyes stung with brightness.

He involuntarily blinked.

When he opened his eyes again, he saw something strange!

Blue lines, white lines, golden lines, pink lines, colorful lines; as well as blood-red lines, black lines... various colored lines filled the world.

Scholar Song quickly looked down at himself.

He found that numerous lines extended from his body as well.

The least numerous were five black lines, piercing into the void with no visible endpoints.

Next were six blood-red lines. These red lines were broken, with one end fluttering in the wind.

The white lines were the most numerous, totaling thousands, most of which also pierced into the void without endpoints.

There were nearly a hundred blue lines as well.

Over twenty golden lines extended to various corners of the world, so far that Scholar Song couldn’t discern where they ultimately led.

And the most special was a single rainbow-colored line that connected his ‘soul’ to Mistress Scallion below.

This rainbow line acted like a kite string, allowing Mistress Scallion to drag Scholar Song along...

“Just what are these lines?” Scholar Song attempted to reach for the rainbow line, but as he stretched out his hand, he grasped at nothing. He couldn’t touch or feel them.

Ordinary people couldn’t see these lines.

Not just ordinary people; even cultivators probably couldn't see these lines, as Jiudeng below didn't seem to notice them.

While Scholar Song was puzzled, he suddenly noticed that Jiudeng had a segment of line extending from her body.

It was a pink line, reaching out like a tentacle toward Mistress Scallion.

And Mistress Scallion (♀) also sprouted a segment of pink line, connecting with the segment on Jiudeng (♀).

Then, the two lines merged into one, melting together into a single pink line!

“Could this... be the legendary fate line? A thousand-mile bond connected by a single thread?” Scholar Song widened his eyes in astonishment.

No, wait.

If these are fate lines, then what do mine represent?

He could have thousands of white lines—if these are all fate lines, does that mean he has to start a harem?

If they’re not fate lines... then what about cause and effect?

Scholar Song speculated.

Threads of cause and effect? Thinking about it this way, it could be quite possible!

If they are indeed cause and effect lines, then surely the colors of these lines must signify something, right?

The pink line likely represents fate or some similar cause—because after Jiudeng had her way with Mistress Scallion, that line appeared.

And what does the rainbow line represent? What kind of relationship do I share with Mistress Scallion? Is it because I consumed her essence?

Then what do the black, white, blood-red, and golden lines represent?

Just as Scholar Song was mulling over this, down below, changes began to occur again.

The pink line from Jiudeng (♀) and Mistress Scallion (♀) began to writhe again.

That pink line pierced through Mistress Scallion’s body.

Then, it traveled up along the rainbow line connecting Mistress Scallion and Scholar Song, eventually securing itself firmly within Scholar Song’s body!

It seemed Mistress Scallion had become a conduit, firmly connecting Jiudeng and Scholar Song.

“What’s happening?” Scholar Song’s heart trembled, feeling an overwhelming sense of the extraordinary.

If Jiudeng had her way with Mistress Scallion and they developed feelings for each other, thus creating a pink line of fate.

But why was this line of cause and effect extending to himself?

Could it be that when Jiudeng had her way with Mistress Scallion while Scholar Song was inhabiting her body, he inadvertently got caught up in it too?

Is it really necessary for this line to connect to me? They could have enjoyed themselves without involving me, I’m just a bystander watching a 3D movie!

As that pink line connected to Scholar Song, he felt his mind shake once more...

The dream shattered!

...

“Did I finally wake up? That dream felt so long,” Scholar Song blinked awake, only to find himself lying beside Venerable White.

He jumped in surprise and quickly sat up.

Turning to look at the outside world, he noted that it had already grown dark. It seemed he had slept for an incredibly long time.

Perhaps his family saw him sleeping on the ground and moved him next to Venerable White?

At that moment, Scholar Song looked down... and discovered a golden line connecting his chest to Venerable White’s.

Simultaneously, the blue, white, black, and gold lines from his body spread out in all directions, no longer disappearing into the void like in the dream.

“The golden line represents the relationship between me and Venerable White? Then these twenty or so golden lines represent all the seniors I’ve interacted with in the Ninefold Land?” Scholar Song murmured.

Then, those blue lines extended, connecting to various places in the room.

“Do the blue lines represent familial relationships?” Scholar Song speculated.

Then what about the white lines?

Finally, his gaze landed on that pink line.

The pink line first connected to the ‘Mistress Scallion’ in his pocket, then refracted outward, stretching high up into the sky.

Without thinking, Scholar Song instinctively reached out to gently touch this pink line.

“Ah, I forgot these lines can’t be touched.” Scholar Song thought to himself.

But just as he was thinking this, he felt his hand... touch that pink line!

Bang!

As he made contact with the pink line, his eyes stung once more. It felt like a force was being drawn out from his eyes... that power had never belonged to him; it was merely borrowed for some reason.

As that power exited, the lines filling his vision faded away completely.

And as they vanished, a picture began to surface in Scholar Song’s mind—following that pink line, there lay a magnificent and luxurious island.

That was... a spectacular sky city!
