### Claw Mark Beast Token

    Hiss!

    Suddenly, the long-armed man felt a sharp pain in his chest, as if a lethal weapon had pierced through his body!

    He had already completed his foundation building, his body as tough as old cowhide. Yet at this moment, he felt as fragile as tofu, the blade piercing straight through to his heart.

    He stared intently at Scholar Song in front of him, but this young man was holding nothing but a bottle of body-refining liquid with empty hands?

    What’s going on? What the hell is happening?!

    Blood gushed from the gaping wound in his chest, drawn away by an invisible sword, staining the tip crimson: "What is this thing?"

    The long-armed man furiously raised his arm, his eyes filled with hatred. Even in death, he wanted to drag Scholar Song down with him into the abyss.

    However, his arm only lifted halfway before it fell limply. A wave of weakness washed over him; all his vitality and strength were being drained by that formless sword.

    At the same time, countless bald monks chanted scriptures endlessly in his mind: "The sea of suffering is boundless; turning back is the shore. Put down the butcher's knife, and you will become a Buddha at once!"

    Annoying!

    Scholar Song took a deep breath and forcefully pulled out the black flying sword, responding, "It's a flying sword."

    Thank goodness he hadn't returned it to Master Tongxuan yet.

    This flying sword could only be seen by those who had received Master Tongxuan's permission, like the Alchemical Sage and himself. To everyone else, it was invisible and undetectable.

    Of course, if the opponent's strength far surpassed that of Master Tongxuan, it would be a different story.

    From the moment they met, Scholar Song had been holding onto this flying sword, intending to wait until the long-armed man got closer to strike. 

    But he hadn't expected the man to boldly charge at him instead. All Scholar Song had to do was slightly adjust the sword's tip to aim for the man's heart.

    Then, with a swift hiss, the man's heart was pierced.

    It was that simple, truly just a matter of lifting a hand.

    No need for any foul-smelling pills!

    A flying sword?

    The long-armed man opened his mouth, struggling to spit out two words: "Possession?"

    He had lived a complete mortal life, his cultivation still at the level of an ordinary person. Yet he possessed body-refining liquid, a flying sword, and a ‘senior’ status that made even the altar master wary. Only the legendary, terrifying cultivators were said to have the power to possess others when their lifespans were nearly up, right? But isn't that method merely a legend?

    Scholar Song ignored the long-armed man's mumbling and raised the black flying sword, the faint scent of blood wafting through the air.

    Even though he had already steeled himself, the smell still made him feel uneasy—after all, he wasn’t some bloodthirsty monster! Just a few days ago, he was still an ordinary college student.

    Taking a deep breath, he summoned the true self from the "True Self Meditation Sutra," grounding himself to maintain calm.

    "Do you have any last words?" Scholar Song asked.

    "I..." The long-armed man opened his mouth.

    Before he could finish, Scholar Song's flying sword rose again, severing the man's head cleanly.

    The long-armed man died with his eyes wide open, his body collapsing to the ground. Not a drop of blood flowed from the severed neck.

    Master Tongxuan's flying sword was not an ordinary weapon; killing without shedding blood was just one of its fundamental attributes.

    "Well, I just said that on a whim; honestly, I wasn’t planning to listen to your last words."

    Scholar Song's hand trembled slightly as he gripped the sword, a bit unsteady, but he gradually regained his composure.

    This was his first kill, and before this, he had never even killed a chicken: "This is my awakening."

    It was the awakening he needed.

    The long-armed man was the first person to die by his hand, but he certainly wouldn’t be the last.

    If possible, he really wanted to capture the long-armed man alive and squeeze out where the ‘altar master’ was hiding. Unfortunately, he lacked the strength; the opponent was a cultivator with opened eyes and nostrils, and he didn’t have the confidence to subdue such an opponent.

    At this moment, killing the long-armed man was the most correct choice.

    The "True Self Meditation Sutra" continued to run in his mind, helping him remain calm in the presence of a headless corpse.

    Holding the black flying sword, Scholar Song cautiously approached and began searching the long-armed man's body.

    The man didn't carry much with him.

    A bottle of pungent liquid, likely the corpse-melting liquid.

    Three blade-like instruments without handles.

    And a token carved with three claw marks, probably representing the long-armed man's identity or organization. This could potentially be a useful lead.

    Finally, there were over a thousand cash bills and Zhao Yaya's phone.

    For a cultivator with opened eyes and nostrils, he was surprisingly poor.

    Scholar Song opened the vial of liquid and poured some over the long-armed man's corpse.

    A sharp stench erupted as the man's bones and some clothing seemed to evaporate, completely disappearing from the world.

    "What a treasure!" Scholar Song tucked away the corpse-melting liquid.

    The corrosive effect was astounding; it could quickly dissolve even the body of a first-grade cultivator. Although, since it was a corpse, it couldn't mobilize its internal vitality for resistance.

    But if used wisely, it could be a lethal weapon, right?

    Finally, Scholar Song poured a little of the corpse-melting liquid on the remnants of the man's clothes as well, erasing any last traces of the long-armed man's existence from the world.

    After ensuring no other traces were left behind, Scholar Song slung Zhao Yaya over his back and hurried toward the Alchemical Sage's location.

    Zhao Yaya had remained unconscious, and he was concerned that the long-armed man might have used some poison, so it was better to have the Alchemical Sage check her out.

    ……

    ……

    About three to four minutes later.

    Zhao Yaya felt a sharp pain in her neck, as if she had slept wrong.

    Moreover, the surface beneath her was shaking continuously, and she groaned in discontent, trying to protest.

    But the shaking only intensified!

    Damn, can't anyone let me sleep peacefully?

    Zhao Yaya furiously opened her eyes and was startled to find that she wasn’t in bed but was being carried on someone's back as they sprinted down the road.

    Oh my God, what is happening?

    The shock jolted her awake, banishing any remnants of sleep.

    Had she been kidnapped?

    Thankfully, she quickly recognized the person carrying her: it was Scholar Song. She was so familiar with him that she could identify him as soon as she regained consciousness.

    "Scholar, where are we?" She gently tapped his shoulder and asked softly.

    "Huh? Sis, you’re awake!" Scholar Song halted his running, gently setting her down: "Are you feeling alright? Is there anywhere that hurts?"

    Zhao Yaya frowned: "I feel fine, but my neck hurts a bit. And why am I here?"

    "You’re asking me why you’re here? Didn’t you call me to come over? When I got here, you were passed out on a bench by the roadside. I was just about to carry you somewhere to rest for the night," Scholar Song replied sincerely, staring at Zhao Yaya.

    He wasn't lying; it was indeed Zhao Yaya’s call that brought him out; she really had been ‘asleep’ there; he was just preparing to find a place for her to rest.

    "..." Zhao Yaya studied Scholar Song for a long moment, realizing he seemed completely truthful.

    She tried to recall, but her memory was hazy. She vaguely remembered going out for drinks with three close friends that night, and she should have returned to her own place?

    Did I drink too much? But I only had four drinks with friends today; how could I possibly be drunk?

    Rubbing her temples, Zhao Yaya looked distressed.

    "Sis, how about I take you to the hospital for a check-up?" Scholar Song asked worriedly.

    "No need. Aside from the slight stiffness in my neck, I'm perfectly fine. Just accompany me back; a good night's rest should fix it," Zhao Yaya said, rubbing her neck, feeling as if someone had given her a chop that left a lingering pain. Other than that, she felt okay.

    After all, she was studying medicine, so she could generally assess her own condition.

    "Then I’ll accompany you back," Scholar Song smiled.

    Zhao Yaya felt that Scholar Song's smile was warm and trustworthy: "Scholar, it feels like you’ve matured a lot since I last saw you?"

    "Really? It must be your imagination," Scholar Song replied nonchalantly—had he changed? Since the moment he swung the sword to behead the long-armed man, his spirit had undergone a transformation.
