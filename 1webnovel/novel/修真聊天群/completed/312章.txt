**Series: Holding Hands Leads to Pregnancy (Seeking Monthly Votes)**

"Lift your skull cap!"

Oh no, that's not right. It's supposed to be lift your red cap… wait, no, it’s white veil!

As Scholar Song gently lifted the veil, he was greeted by a delicate face — pure, elegant, with only the faintest touch of makeup. She was a stunning beauty. Overall, her appearance exuded a slight air of heroism, but there was a breathtaking softness in her brows that melted away any trace of her fierceness.

Upon seeing this face, Scholar Song was puzzled — this wasn't any girl he remembered. Who was she?

He felt as though her face looked somewhat familiar, but at that moment, he couldn’t recall where he had seen her.

Wait a minute, could it be related to his lost memories of the ‘Mysterious Island’? Or was she someone he met during the four years of memories that had vanished?

As he pondered these questions, he cautiously lifted the veil a little higher… and suddenly, something felt off.

Where was her hair?

Where was the bride's hair? He had already lifted the veil to her ears, yet not a single strand of black hair was in sight. Shouldn't there be a beautiful head of glossy black hair at this point?

A sense of foreboding washed over him.

Scholar Song carefully lifted the veil higher. Normally, after lifting the veil, it would rest on the bride's hair, trailing beautifully behind her.

However, this time, as he lifted it, the veil had nowhere to rest and flew away entirely.

In the next moment, a shiny, bald head appeared before Scholar Song's eyes. The bright lights in the wedding chapel reflected off the shiny surface, dazzling him with blinding brilliance.

Cough… where was the promised glossy hair?

Panicking, Scholar Song hurriedly grabbed the veil and attempted to place it back on the bride's head.

The beautiful bride remained calm, a mysterious smile still playing on her lips, exuding an aura of composure.

"Let us bless this couple!" The pastor, with an ironclad composure, clapped vigorously, encouraging all the friends and family in the chapel to join in with enthusiastic applause and cheers of blessing.

Scholar Song's mind was blank, filled only with the image of that glaring bald head, reflecting ‘light waves’ from various angles, leaving him dazed.

After a moment, a flash of realization struck him.

He remembered where he had seen this ‘fiancée’ before!

Wasn’t she the ‘Nine Lanterns’ nun from Mistress Scallion's memories?

How did she suddenly appear before him and become his wife? Was this some sort of joke? He had only seen her once in a dream, right? Although, during that dream with Mistress Scallion, he and she had… well, that was just a dream!

How could she just come and marry him? Director, who wrote this script? They should be taken out and dealt with!

No, wait, let him calm down for a moment.

Could it be that he had encountered her during his time on the ‘Mysterious Island’?

Because in his memories, Mistress Scallion had a causal thread linking him, her, and the woman from the Sky City.

And then, did he make a lifelong promise to her while on the Mysterious Island?

It was very possible. Damn it, why did all the memories from the Mysterious Island vanish? At least leaving him a hint would prevent him from feeling so lost!

……

……

His mind was a whirlwind of confusion.

Throughout this time, his ‘fiancée’ — oh no, now she was his ‘wife’ — hadn’t spoken a single word.

And just like that, the wedding came to an end.

Scholar Song, along with his ‘wife,’ was escorted by friends and family into the bridal chamber — originally, there should have been a scene where the groom and bride toasted to their guests.

But due to Scholar Song’s history of being ‘dazed’ for four years, all those processes were skipped. Everyone could understand that.

So, now it was time for the bridal chamber?

Was this leading him to… well, you know, with the bride? Wouldn’t that get censored? The management was so strict nowadays!

At that moment, his wife softly said, “Scholar.”

“Yeah, I’m here.” Scholar Song replied stiffly.

“A moment of bliss is worth a thousand gold. Let’s have a baby.” His wife’s expression was blank, but her cheeks were flushed, looking quite shy.

“Uh, isn’t that a bit too fast? Having a child is a lifelong matter,” Scholar Song swallowed hard. “At least let me understand what happened in these four years first. Like, did we have something happen on the Mysterious Island? You should know; I don’t remember that part.”

“These things aren't a big deal. I have a lifetime to explain them to you, so don’t talk too much. Come, let’s hold hands first.” His wife removed her pristine white wedding gloves and extended her little hand toward Scholar Song.

“Hold hands?” Scholar Song stepped forward, confused, and took her small hand.

“Yep, and then we can have a baby.” His wife responded seriously.

“What?” Scholar Song was taken aback.

“This is the current rule; even in the bridal chamber, we can’t do anything. It would get censored. At most, we can just hold hands, and after that… we can have a baby.” His wife said bashfully, “Oh, by the way, I plan to have a boy first, and then a girl.”

What the actual…!

Scholar Song felt like his brain was about to fry.

……

……

Time flew by?

In the blink of an eye, ten months had passed.

Yes, that’s right… it was literally in the blink of an eye. After he held his wife’s soft little hand, he blinked. Then, he found himself in the hospital’s delivery room.

His wife lay on the bed looking weak, her gaze warm as she looked at him, who was still in a daze.

Beside them, Father Song and Mother Song wore exaggerated smiles.

Mother Song beamed, “It’s a boy! Your dad, we have a grandson now!”

“Ha, this wasn’t easy. Look at the boy’s nose; he looks so much like Scholar. His little face is so cute!” Father Song gently pointed above the baby’s face with his large hand, afraid to actually touch the baby’s skin, worried he might hurt the child.

Scholar Song: “…”

What the actual…!

……

……

Time continued to fly.

In another blink, Scholar Song discovered that his son was already two years old. The little boy was riding on his shoulders, joyfully shouting.

He stood dumbfounded in the backyard, playing with his son as they picked bamboo leaves. Beside him, his mysterious wife wore a serene smile.

She had grown a head full of silky black hair. It wasn’t long, just shoulder-length, but it looked beautiful! Her long hair softened her heroic appearance and enhanced the gentle beauty of her features.

“Scholar.” His serene wife said softly, “Let’s hold hands again. This time, I want to have a lovely girl.”

Scholar Song: “…”

Then, he resolutely stretched out his hand and firmly clasped his wife’s small hand, giving it a squeeze.

Next, he took the initiative to blink his eyes hard.

Okay, time flew once more. With his eyes closed and then opened, it was now ten months later.

He found himself back in the hospital, where his now three-year-old son was still riding on his shoulders, his adorable eyes fixed on his mother lying on the bed.

His wife lay there weakly, a face full of happiness: “Scholar, this time it’s a daughter. Do you like her?”

Scholar Song: “…”

Meanwhile, Mother Song burst out with a proud laugh: “It’s a girl! We have a granddaughter now!”

“A granddaughter is great; they are gentle and caring, unlike grandsons who are so rambunctious.” Father Song rubbed his hands together, cautiously looking at the baby in Mother Song's arms.

What the actual…!

……

……

Scholar Song once again took the initiative to blink hard.

This time, the time span was even greater, three years.

His six-year-old son had gone to school, while his three-year-old adorable daughter was dressed in a beautiful dress, her long ponytail bouncing as she wore cute little boots, holding a balloon and splashing in the water in the backyard.

His wife stood beside her, calm and serene, with hair that now reached her waist.

“Is it still not over?” Scholar Song sighed inwardly. He didn’t know what was happening, but it was clear that this world was off.

He discreetly pinched himself, but this world was no dream…

“Daddy, Daddy, are you not happy?” At that moment, his three-year-old adorable daughter ran over, wrapping her arms around Scholar Song's leg, looking up with her big, sparkling eyes.

“Huh?” Scholar Song looked at his daughter in confusion.

“If you’re not happy, how about I give you a smile? If you smile, you’ll be happy, right?” As she spoke, his daughter beamed a radiant smile.

This was… the smile of a goddess.

In an instant, Scholar Song felt completely healed.

At that moment, he realized that as long as he had such a cute daughter and son, even if the world was filled with oddities, he had the motivation to keep on living!

Having a daughter was amazing.

Scholar Song bent down and scooped up his daughter.

Just as he was about to enjoy the sweet interaction with his daughter and take in her adorableness, suddenly, everything went dark.

When the light returned, he found himself in a massive, familiar church.

Beside him stood an obviously much older Father Song and Mother Song.

Father Song sighed, “Time flies! In the blink of an eye, our dear Ren is about to get married. It feels like just yesterday, our silly Scholar just got married!”

Mother Song looked wistfully, “Time waits for no one, and in the blink of an eye, Ren is about to have children. We’ll be holding our great-grandchild soon!”

Damn it, I was just about to enjoy some cute moments with my daughter! How did it skip to my son’s wedding? The time span was too vast — give me back my cute daughter!

Moreover, there seemed to be something strange in what Father Song just said. Ren is my son, right?… But isn’t he just about to get married? How did he already have a child?

This logic doesn’t add up!

It didn’t take long for Scholar Song to figure it out.

He saw his son, Ren, walking down the red carpet, and the bride approaching him in a beautiful wedding dress, her belly already round — they were getting married because she was pregnant!

What the actual…!

His wife gently squeezed his excited hand, smiling softly at him. At that moment, her hair had grown long, reaching down to her thighs!
