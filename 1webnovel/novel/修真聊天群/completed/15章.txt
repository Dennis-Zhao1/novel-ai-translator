**Professor Ren Shui's Injury**

In Scholar Song's mind, those two boxes of medicinal herbs were probably filled with all sorts of strange things—at least nothing valuable. So, he joked, "Well, thanks in advance! By the way, do you have an account for booking tickets on the high-speed train website?"

Fay Yu shook her head. She didn’t need to book flights or train tickets herself; her family had many servants and disciples serving Lingdie Island.

"Then could you pass me your ID? I’ll book a ticket for you using my account," Scholar Song offered.

"Sure!" Fay Yu obediently handed over her ID and then asked, "Scholar Song, can I go out to the balcony to take a look?"

"Don’t be so formal; feel free!" Scholar Song replied with a smile. What a nice and polite girl—such a shame she was so eccentric.

Fay Yu shyly smiled and quickly walked to the balcony, looking out at the view.

The balcony faced east, overlooking a wide road and the school garden, with no obstructions. So even though it was only the second floor, the view was expansive.

Fay Yu first glanced cautiously at Scholar Song, then stealthily cast a small spell to shield her energy waves, ensuring that her upcoming actions wouldn’t be sensed by "Scholar Song."

With her preparations complete, she quietly took out two invisible lenses from her pocket and put them on.

Don’t underestimate these two lenses; they were magical artifacts crafted by the esteemed Lingdie Master—a beginner’s version of the "Heavenly Vision"!

The name is a bit long, but this was an upgraded and enhanced version of the "Thousand-Mile Vision."

Once the lenses were worn, they allowed the wearer to elevate their vision high above, looking down at the world below as if they had a god's perspective.

This creation was born from a father’s concern for his daughter, knowing she easily got lost. It was meant to help her find the right path by looking down from a higher angle when she couldn’t recognize her surroundings. It was filled with a father's love.

As the saying goes, daughters are often their fathers' past-life lovers, and this couldn’t be more true.

If it were a son, the esteemed Lingdie Master would never have been so thoughtful—what kind of man would admit to getting lost? If you can’t find your way, just clear the obstacles in front of you and march straight ahead! Going forward boldly is the essence of a man’s romance!

Like flowers blooming in pairs, each splendid in its own way.

Using the godly vision provided by her artifact, Fay Yu quickly locked onto the faculty apartments of Jiangnan University. After cross-referencing her information, she successfully identified a tall teacher wearing black-framed glasses—Professor Ren Shui.

At that moment, the innocent Professor Ren Shui was… accompanying his six-month-old daughter for a nap.

Since "accompanying his daughter for a nap" could easily lead some gentlemen to misinterpret the situation, it’s crucial to specify her age! Let me emphasize again: she’s a "just turned six months old" daughter!

Everything was proceeding so smoothly, it felt almost divine!

"I found him!" Fay Yu felt a rush of joy. She pressed her palms together and muttered, "I’m really sorry, but you must sprain your ankle and be hospitalized!"

Between her clasped hands, a golden talisman flickered. Generally, talismans and similar items are one-time consumables, but some advanced ones can be reused multiple times.

This talisman in Fay Yu's hands was undoubtedly a high-level item.

Only someone like Fay Yu, a second-generation cultivator with a well-connected father, would waste such a premium talisman so casually.

Creating high-level talismans is no easy feat. Even though they can be reused, there’s a limit to their quantity. Most ordinary cultivators would scrimp and save, carefully calculating when to use such a valuable item!

The golden talisman activated under Fay Yu’s control.

In the distant faculty apartment.

Professor Ren Shui, in a daze while napping, suddenly felt a force push him, causing him to tumble out of bed.

Unfortunately, his foot landed at a precarious angle, perfect for spraining.

And then… bang!

A sound echoed—the sound of something being twisted.

"Ah!" Professor Ren Shui woke up in pain, stifling a groan and breaking into a cold sweat as his sprained ankle turned red and swollen. To avoid waking his adorable daughter, he clutched the blanket tightly and gritted his teeth, suppressing a scream—such is the heart of a devoted father.

Gritting his teeth, Professor Ren Shui quickly began to massage his sore ankle, clearly experienced in dealing with such injuries. This level of sprain wasn’t severe enough to warrant hospitalization; a little ointment and a good night’s sleep would have him back to normal by morning.

After rubbing for a while, Professor Ren Shui stood up on one leg, using the wall for support as he hopped toward the fridge, intent on retrieving some ointment and ice for a cold compress.

However… Fay Yu’s spell was not finished; her goal was to get this poor professor hospitalized!

Unaware that an unseen force was determined to ensure his foot would be sprained to the point of hospitalization, Professor Ren Shui thought he had just accidentally fallen out of bed. Little did he know that hopping on one foot while using the wall for support was incredibly dangerous—an accident waiting to happen.

As he hopped along, he suddenly found himself in midair.

Crack! This time, it was the sound of a bone breaking… the other, perfectly fine foot had fractured. It was a more severe injury than the first.

"Ah!" Professor Ren Shui crashed to the floor, his eyes wide as he gasped in pain, tears forming—men may not cry easily, but this was beyond heartbreaking.

Looking at his sprained and fractured legs, his eyes immediately glistened with tears.

But what could he do? He could only resign himself to his misfortune.

After gasping for a while, he cautiously took out his phone and called his wife for help. His wife was also a professor at Jiangnan University.

With a daughter at home, he didn’t dare to call for an ambulance directly. He needed to wait for his wife to return to care for their daughter before he could go to the hospital.

Upon hearing her husband’s tale of the "twisted ankle and fractured foot," Professor Ren Shui’s wife felt worried yet found it somewhat amusing.

After hurriedly requesting a substitute for her class, she rushed home…

After ending the call with his wife, Professor Ren Shui called the school to request leave for the next three classes in the afternoon. With both legs injured, he was certain he would need to be hospitalized, so he naturally needed to inform the school to rearrange his classes.

"Done," Fay Yu nodded in satisfaction as she tucked away the golden talisman.

With this, she had achieved her goal.

Professor Ren Shui had taken leave, leaving his classes free for the next afternoon.

With no classes tomorrow, Scholar Song would also be available.

If Scholar Song was free, he could accompany her to City J.

See? It was that simple!

With everything in order, Fay Yu felt elated.

When she returned inside, she saw Scholar Song booking her train ticket on the high-speed train website.

"Scholar Song, why don’t you book a ticket too? You might find you have no classes tomorrow afternoon!" Fay Yu leaned over, her voice soft.

"Haha, if I really have no classes, then I’ll book one too," Scholar Song joked.

Just as his words fell…

Ding!

Suddenly, a message popped up on the campus network account.

"Attention students of Class 43, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Design and Manufacturing Institute: Due to Professor Ren Shui’s injury and hospitalization, tomorrow afternoon’s Mathematical Statistics class will be replaced by Professor Smith’s University English class. Please inform each other and make the necessary preparations! Thank you."

This short message replayed three times in a row.

And was set to repeat every hour.

The Jiangnan University administration was quick and efficient! It took just a couple of minutes from Professor Ren Shui’s call for leave to the sending out of this message!

"Hey, Professor Ren Shui got injured? What a coincidence. But switching to English class tomorrow... Do I really have to sit through old Professor Smith's boring lecture?" Scholar Song muttered to himself.

Meanwhile, standing beside him, Fay Yu’s eyes suddenly glistened with tears.

This is truly a battle of wits!

But those from Lingdie Island would never give up easily, not ever!
