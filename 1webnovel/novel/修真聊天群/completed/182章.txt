**It’s an Illness, No Cure!**

The door lock of the Alchemical Sage’s building had been repaired.

When Scholar Song returned home, he searched every floor but couldn’t find Dou Dou or Venerable White.

“Could it be that Dou Dou took Venerable White out for some fun?” Scholar Song wondered aloud. Finally, when he reached the top of the fifth floor, he found Dou Dou, Venerable White, and the Sugar Master from the Empty Thief Sect all gathered together.

His eyes immediately fell on the Alchemical Sage’s alchemical furnace, which had been split into two halves. The top half was tossed aside, while the bottom half blazed with roaring flames, atop which rested a large pot.

The Sugar Master, donning an apron, was skillfully stir-frying ingredients in the pot.

Nearby, a long table held an array of dishes being steamed, boiled, fried, and sautéed, making Scholar Song's mouth water.

“What’s going on here?” Scholar Song asked, puzzled.

“Woof! I was just properly interrogating—uh, I mean, training this Sugar Master from the Empty Thief Sect,” Dou Dou explained, taking a big bite of beef. “And she spilled everything! From when she started cultivating to what she’s good at, and how many treasures she’s recently raided—she revealed it all... However, she didn’t know much about the status of that Sunflower Cultivator in the Infinite Demon Sect.” Dou Dou continued, her mouth full. “Then, during the interrogation, she mentioned that she’s really good at cooking. So, we asked her to whip up some dishes for us to try!”

“It’s quite delicious,” Venerable White nodded in agreement.

Scholar Song cast a sympathetic glance at the Sugar Master—what kind of interrogation could lead her to divulge personal talents like cooking?

Probably all her secrets were laid bare, right? How would she face Dou Dou after this?

As if sensing Scholar Song’s gaze, the Sugar Master turned and met his eyes, flashing a cheerful—yet dazed—smile.

Scholar Song’s heart sank. Was she... a little off?

At that moment, Venerable White pointed to a plate of purple bamboo shoots on the table. “Young Scholar Song, this purple bamboo shoot has been prepared by Sugar. Eating it will greatly benefit your nasal passages—don’t waste it.”

“Can I just eat it as is? Don’t I need to refine it into a pill?” Scholar Song asked, taking a seat.

“No need. While refining the bamboo shoot into a pill would enhance its effects a bit, overconsumption of pills can lead to resistance. For treasures like the purple bamboo shoot, eating it directly is the best way,” Venerable White replied with a chuckle.

Scholar Song tried a piece of the bamboo shoot, and it was indeed quite tasty. He couldn’t help but glance at the Sugar Master again—her culinary skills were impressive. If one were to overlook her identity as a disciple of the Empty Thief Sect, whoever marries her in the future would surely be lucky.

“Hehe,” the Sugar Master responded with another bright, albeit silly, grin.

...

After a usual round of cultivation that evening, Scholar Song returned home early to rest.

After all, he had an exam to face the next day and needed to conserve his energy.

The medicinal effects of the purple bamboo shoot began to kick in, and after dinner, Scholar Song felt his breathing becoming easier, as if his previously stuffy nose had cleared up.

But there was a small issue—his sense of smell had become tremendously sensitive. Even the slightest sound of flatulence felt like a noxious stench, magnified six or seven times.

After taking a refreshing shower and stretching out comfortably, he quickly fell asleep.

Later, while Scholar Song was deep in slumber, Venerable White quietly infiltrated his room and approached him.

Then, Venerable White waved a hand in the air beside Scholar Song.

In an instant, a triangular energy mark floated into existence beside him, emblazoned with a grotesque ghostly face.

“Just as I thought, it’s this life curse,” Venerable White chuckled, carefully channeling some spiritual energy into the curse mark.

Soon, a fist-sized ball of black mist appeared beside Scholar Song, exuding a thick aura of resentment.

“Hatred, hatred, so much hatred~~ Not entering reincarnation, forever doomed to be a ghostly being, yet craving vengeance!” the black spirit growled menacingly.

Simultaneously, it began to swell like a balloon, quickly growing to a height of more than half a person. One could vaguely discern the features of the altar master; compared to last time, the ghost’s visage now bore only a four-part resemblance to the altar master.

“Come forth, devour it to restore your rank,” Venerable White whispered.

As soon as he spoke, Scholar Song’s Phantom Spirit burst forth from his heart and swallowed the black resentful spirit in one gulp.

The Phantom Spirit’s form expanded significantly, and it began to undergo a transformation.

About five or six minutes later, it let out a soft cry, radiating a faint golden glow.

With a ‘clang’, a small golden shield re-materialized beside it. In addition to the shield, there was now also a small golden sword at its side.

Having regained its strength, the Phantom Spirit transformed back into a mid-level spirit.

With the core in place, it had a great chance of advancing to a high-level spirit in due time.

After returning to its mid-level form, the Phantom Spirit respectfully bowed to Venerable White before retreating back into Scholar Song’s heart, returning to tranquility.

“It’s a pity that the ghost cultivator who placed a life curse on Scholar Song was too weak; this resentful spirit can only appear four or five more times. Otherwise, perhaps it could have propelled the Phantom Spirit to high-level status all at once,” Venerable White chuckled as he left Scholar Song’s room, floating away.

The reason for his sudden visit to assist Scholar Song was due to the guilt he felt from dismantling so many things over the past few days.

Especially since Scholar Song hadn’t voiced any complaints after discovering he had essentially demolished the entire house, which made Venerable White feel even more guilty.

However, he couldn’t stop himself from dismantling things, so after much thought, he decided to give Scholar Song a little compensation.

“I’ll guide Scholar Song’s cultivation tomorrow. I’ve troubled him so much these past few days,” Venerable White mused as he departed.

There was no need for more words; the Alchemical Sage had already fainted in the bathroom... because it was his house that had been dismantled, not Scholar Song’s.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

That night, Scholar Song had another bizarre dream.

It was about the blue-robed cultivator, the wandering cultivator Li Tiansu, and the continuation of his life’s dream.

Could it be that Li Tiansu’s life was so long that the dream had to be split across two nights? Scholar Song internally scoffed.

In the dream… Li Tiansu successfully cultivated and descended the mountain donning his blue robe.

His life could be described as smooth sailing.

Like most wandering cultivators, he began searching for a cave suitable for his cultivation, seeking various rare treasures and exploring the ruins and caves left behind by past cultivators, searching for opportunities and accumulating wealth.

These memories were but fleeting fragments, flashing through the dream.

In summary, Scholar Song realized that Li Tiansu had experienced many things in his life, leading to a rich and colorful existence.

More importantly, his fortune was not lacking; before reaching the fifth-tier Golden Core stage, he had already amassed a substantial fortune for a cultivator.

But why did he later end up in such dire straits? With only a flying sword and an ancient bronze ring by his side? Scholar Song pondered.

Just then, a significant event unfolded in Li Tiansu’s dream that would change the course of his life. He met a female cultivator, and the two quickly fell in love and became partners.

The female cultivator was a disciple of a medium-sized sect… however, the typical movie trope of ‘the female cultivator’s elder intervening to break up the couple’ did not occur here.

Because Li Tiansu had already reached the fifth-tier Golden Core Spirit Emperor stage and was a Seven Dragon Pattern Golden Core! Even as a wandering cultivator, his potential was boundless. He could easily become an elder or peak master in a major sect, so the medium-sized sect welcomed such a powerful ally.

Naturally, the female cultivator’s sect showered them with blessings, allowing the two to successfully become dual cultivation partners.

Not long after, they had a daughter.

That was the happiest time in Li Tiansu’s life.

But ten years later, tragedy struck when his partner perished in a calamity while attempting to break through to the fifth-tier Golden Core stage, turning to ashes. This dealt a tremendous blow to Li Tiansu.

Another ten years passed, and his once vibrant daughter suddenly fell ill, her body producing an icy energy that threatened to freeze her if left unchecked. If that chill were not managed, she could be encased in frost and potentially turned into an ice statue.

Li Tiansu had to rely on pills and his own spiritual energy to dispel the cold within her.

In a desperate attempt to cure his daughter’s strange illness, Li Tiansu exhausted all his wealth and sank deeply into debt.

Recently, his daughter’s illness had flared up severely; this time, the chill manifested as an ice coffin around her, encasing her within.

Li Tiansu was forced to seal his daughter within a cave, shutting off its defenses. He then ventured to a forbidden area in search of a cure for her illness.

And then… came the scene of him flying miles with his own corpse to deliver equipment.

...

The next day.

When Scholar Song woke up, he rubbed his temples vigorously. The dream from yesterday was exceptionally vivid, as if he had personally lived through Li Tiansu’s life.

What was this supposed to mean?

Scholar Song felt a wave of confusion—was he meant to inherit Li Tiansu’s karma?

Li Tiansu, a Golden Core Spirit Emperor with vast wealth, had exhausted everything to treat his daughter, ultimately losing his life in the process. And here was Scholar Song, just a small two-aperture cultivator—what could he possibly do?

Was he supposed to transfer Li Tiansu’s daughter to a modern hospital for surgery?

As he climbed to the bathroom to wash up, his mind continued to wander: “Maybe I should ask the group chat if any seniors are interested in a disciple with such resources. This girl has a natural icy energy, which is quite formidable. If left unchecked, she’ll frost over and potentially become an ice statue. During serious episodes, she even encases herself in ice coffins. I suspect she might be some sort of ice cultivation prodigy. Perhaps a senior cultivating ice techniques would want to take her under their wing, just like in the movies?”

With that thought, Scholar Song opened the Jiuzhou Number One group chat.

**Scholar Song:** “Seniors, I have a disciple resource here. This girl has a natural icy energy that’s incredibly potent. If not managed, it could form frost on her body, even encasing her in ice. I suspect she might be some kind of ice cultivation prodigy. Are there any seniors in the group who practice ice techniques that would consider taking her in?”

Moments later, a senior in the group replied.

**The Dharma King of Creation:** “Young Scholar Song, based on your description, this girl is not a cultivation prodigy. It’s an illness… it needs to be treated.”

**Master of Snow Wolf Cavern:** “I concur; it’s an illness. There’s a natural chill within her that stems from being harmed by icy energy in utero. Moreover, it typically activates around the age of ten… If her condition has reached the severity you described, it’s likely beyond cure.”

“Is there really no way to save her?” Scholar Song recalled the hardships of Li Tiansu’s life and asked hopefully.
