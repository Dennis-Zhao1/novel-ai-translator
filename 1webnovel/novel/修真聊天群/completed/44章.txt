**The Alchemical Sage's Key**

Time is an invaluable, consumable resource. Whether you want it or not, it’s always being spent.

As Scholar Song continued refining his alchemical concoction, he realized it was already nearing three-thirty in the afternoon.

His latest batch of body tempering liquid was approaching completion.

Like yesterday, when he added the forty-first ingredient, the concoction in the pot began to change.

Thanks to his previous experience, Scholar Song calmly added water this time. Moments later, he tossed in four ingredients at once: fresh King’s Vine, Nine Yang Red Flame Bamboo, Deep Sea Cold Crystal, and the Core of the Snow Demon.

As the concoction began to polarize, Scholar Song cranked the heat up to maximum.

Once he finished all the steps, he finally let out a breath of relief.

Everything was going smoothly; the success would depend on the final moments!

Oh right! He also needed to prepare himself for the impending wave of a ‘collective stench of all the world’s foulness.’

Four minutes later.

Boom…

The lid of the pot was blasted off again, and a black smoke erupted from within, filling the room with an indescribable, horrendous stench.

Scholar Song had been prepared. He held his breath in advance—although the foul odor still found its way to invade his senses, pinching his nose helped alleviate the worst of it.

“Ugh? What is that smell?” The Alchemical Sage was highly skilled, with senses approximately three hundred times sharper than an ordinary person, especially his sense of smell.

As the bizarre stench assaulted his nostrils, he felt worse and worse.

This was pushing the boundaries of a biochemical weapon! An ordinary person would be left pale, nauseated, and on the verge of vomiting just from a whiff!

If it weren’t for his formidable strength and the frequent exposure to various foul odors during his alchemical trials, he would have likely crumbled under this assault.

“If this stuff can be distilled, it would be a nightmare for first-grade cultivators with open nasal passages and second-grade True Masters who can’t control their sense of smell!” The Alchemical Sage muttered, slapping his hand to create a gust that dispersed the vile black mist.

“Even having smelled it once, I still can’t adapt. I feel like I won’t have an appetite for days,” Scholar Song complained as well.

“Was it successful?” the Alchemical Sage inquired.

“With this awful stench, it should be a success, right?” Scholar Song picked up the pot lid, which seemed to be thrown off every time. Even reinforced glass would eventually shatter under such treatment!

The Alchemical Sage pinched his nose and leaned close to the pot. There, at the bottom, lay a thin layer of black medicinal paste—transparent and pungent.

He flicked his finger, lifting a droplet of the liquid and letting it fall into his mouth.

As he savored the explosive medicinal properties in his mouth, the Alchemical Sage revealed a satisfied smile, “Just as I thought.”

Estimating roughly, it was about half as potent as his simplified version of the body tempering liquid.

Generally, stronger medicinal pills are better for cultivators. However, for the simplest body tempering liquid, once its efficacy decreased to a certain point, it unexpectedly revealed special effects!

The old version of the body tempering liquid had powerful effects. Even elite disciples from various sects needed to prepare for months, even up to half a year, to fully activate their vitality and reach peak physical condition before they could consume it.

After the Alchemical Sage simplified the formula, elite disciples still needed to prepare for a month or so before they could take it.

But with a further reduction in the efficacy of the body tempering liquid, disciples within the sect only needed minor adjustments to their conditions to be able to consume it.

Then, once their bodies had been tempered, they could take higher quality body tempering liquids, significantly saving the initial training time for the disciples.

After all, the time for disciples to build their foundation is precious. The best time for foundation establishment is between four and six years old—just two years—and the earlier they can take the body tempering liquid, the better.

More importantly, Scholar Song’s method for refining the body tempering liquid didn’t require any special adjustments. If he made a mistake at the forty-first step of refining the ‘simplified body tempering liquid,’ he could immediately switch to the next step.

This method was essentially a patch for the Alchemical Sage’s ‘simplified body tempering liquid,’ further perfecting the formula and significantly reducing the waste of materials for the ‘alchemist apprentices.’

Seeing the satisfied smile on the Alchemical Sage’s face, Scholar Song felt relieved and asked, “Does this mean I can help you improve the simplified body tempering liquid formula?”

“It won’t be that easy. Your successful refinement this time only proves that my idea for improving the formula is feasible. In the coming days, I’ll need your cooperation as I make some adjustments based on your refining method. Heh, I knew this trip was worth it,” the Alchemical Sage replied, beaming.

Scholar Song nodded, “I’ll do my best to cooperate, senior.”

The Alchemical Sage nodded in approval and pulled out a thick notebook, quickly jotting down various data and details from the experiment.

He was known as a genius alchemist, having a small reputation among cultivators. However, his fame didn’t come without effort; this thick notebook was proof of the countless hours he had dedicated to the art of alchemy. In fact, he had thirty bookshelves in his cave filled with similar notebooks.

Behind every successful genius lies an unimaginable amount of hard work.

Scholar Song watched the Alchemical Sage with a hesitant expression, finally unable to hold back any longer: “Senior Alchemist, you mentioned earlier that Master Tongxuan’s flying sword message would arrive in about four to five hours. Given the time, it should be nearing now, right?”

“The Basic Vajra Fist Technique and the True Self Meditation Sutra! The foundational techniques that would truly allow me to step into the world of cultivators!”

Just the thought of those two volumes of foundational techniques sent excitement coursing through Scholar Song’s veins. He could hardly contain his eagerness to get his hands on those manuals.

“Haha, no rush, no rush. Master Tongxuan’s flying sword message will respond to my coordinates when it’s close. However, let’s head back to your dormitory first. The transmission coordinates we set initially are in your dormitory, so the flying sword should reach there without a hitch.” The Alchemical Sage chuckled.

“Should we head back now?” Scholar Song’s eyes sparkled with anticipation.

“Not just yet. While observing your refinement of the body tempering liquid, I validated many ideas in my mind, and I need to record them first. If you’re in a hurry, you can head back first; I’ll catch up later,” the Alchemical Sage said.

Scholar Song nodded.

“Well then, senior, I’ll head back to my dormitory and keep watch?”

“Go ahead, go ahead. Young folks are always so impatient.” The Alchemical Sage waved his hand, tossing a set of keys toward Scholar Song.

It was the key to this building.

“Here’s the key for you. Since there are five floors, I won’t need them all. You can stay on the top floor, so you don’t have to rent a place.” The Alchemical Sage said without looking up.

Since he had bought the place, leaving it empty would be a waste, so why not do Scholar Song a favor?

Scholar Song caught the keys without hesitation. “Thank you, senior!”

He genuinely needed a quiet space without disturbances, and—given his tight budget—having the Alchemical Sage lend him a room was a timely blessing, so he didn’t feel the need to be overly polite.

“Just remember to lock the door!” The Alchemical Sage waved again, returning to his notes.

With a light step, Scholar Song left.

Of course, he didn’t forget his electric stove and hot pot; he had to remember to bring those back to avoid raising suspicions from his dorm mates.
