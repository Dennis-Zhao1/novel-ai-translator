**A Young Man in a Blue Robe Rides a White Horse, Here Again? (Extra Chapter for the Ordinary Alliance Leader)**

The police officer's deduction was to be expected.

If you told me that a Husky was driving, I could almost believe it. After all, with their size and personality, it’s not out of the question that one might actually climb into a car and take it for a spin. They were bred for pulling sleds, so they do have some connection to vehicles.

But a Pekingese? Where in the world would you find a Pekingese big enough to drive? So, it must be some street racers wearing Pekingese masks to create chaos! Otherwise, it just doesn’t make sense!

...

Scholar Song finally managed to stop his coughing fit.

Forget about those racers in Pekingese masks; at this point, with his current state of mind, he could connect anything related to Pekingese, street racing, or car crashes back to Dou Dou with just a thought.

He’d bet anything that this mess was one hundred percent Dou Dou’s fault.

“Was the Ferrari parked in that villa that got hit?” Scholar Song wiped the sweat off his brow and pulled out his phone to check car prices online.

After a quick search, he found that the lowest prices started at over three million yuan, and that was just the base price, not including various taxes and fees.

There were models listed for five million, ten million, and even twenty million, not to mention imports that cost several tens of millions. It was a buyer’s market; there was no shortage of expensive cars—only a shortage of cash!

Scholar Song touched his pocket, thinking he had nearly four million in cash from the forum owner. That seemed like a decent sum. But now, it looked like even if he emptied his pockets, he could barely afford the cheapest Ferrari?

He was getting sidetracked... The real issue wasn’t that; he needed to contact Dou Dou to confirm what had happened.

If it really was Dou Dou’s doing, he’d have to reach out to the villa's owner and discuss compensation. A Ferrari, huh? He had no idea what model it was, and whether he could afford to compensate if it turned out to be four million.

Damn it! Why should I bear the blame for the trouble Dou Dou caused?

Weren’t there specialists in the Yellow Mountain Immortal’s crew to handle the messes Dou Dou made? If he confirmed that Dou Dou was responsible, he could just inform the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain and let him sort it out.

Thinking of this, Scholar Song felt a wave of relief wash over him.

He then scrolled through his phone contacts to find Dou Dou’s number. Dou Dou had called him yesterday, so he had saved it.

After about ten rings, someone finally picked up on the other end.

“Woof! Scholar Song! You’re calling me this early? You’re disturbing my beauty sleep! Woof! Be careful or I might just bite you!” Dou Dou’s annoyed voice came through the phone, accompanied by a loud yawn.

“Dou Dou, tell me the truth. Did you go street racing yesterday? Did you crash into someone’s villa and wreck a Ferrari?” Scholar Song asked in a serious tone.

“Woof! How did you know? Did you put a camera on me? You sneaky Scholar Song! If you keep spying on me like this, it’s an invasion of my privacy!” Dou Dou shouted angrily.

“Spying? What are you talking about? Not everyone is as shameless as you!” Scholar Song retorted, “Your antics are on the news, you know?!”

“Ah, haha! I made it to the news? That’s embarrassing!” Dou Dou chuckled awkwardly.

“Where are you right now?” Scholar Song gritted his teeth.

“I’m at a hotel in Wenzhou City, it took me forever to find it! I just checked in with the little monk. It’s getting harder to find hotels that don’t require an ID these days,” Dou Dou rambled on.

Staying with the little monk?

“Well, that’s good. Just remember, don’t cause any more trouble! I’ll come find you, and if you stir up anything else in the meantime, don’t expect to see me again!” Scholar Song warned angrily.

“……” Dou Dou was unusually quiet for a moment.

Then cautiously asked, “Scholar Song, that ‘don’t expect to see me’ really worries me... You’re not falling for me, are you? I told you before, I’m a male Pekingese! If you’re looking for a romantic fling, I’m not a suitable partner. But if you really want to date someone, I can introduce you to some cute cat girls!”

“Ugh!” Scholar Song spat out a mouthful of blood and hung up the phone angrily.

He then opened his contacts again, preparing to call the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

At that moment, he heard the doorbell ringing downstairs.

...

Scholar Song looked up and was surprised to see a familiar face!

The visitor wore a black suit and had a serious expression. It was none other than Zhou Li, the ‘Hidden Heaven Hook’—the cultivator the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain had sent last time to deal with the troubles Dou Dou caused.

At this moment, it seemed like he was carrying someone on his shoulder.

“Perfect timing! This saves me a call to the Immortal Sage!” Scholar Song felt a surge of joy.

He hurried downstairs to open the door.

As soon as the door swung open, Scholar Song greeted him enthusiastically, “Brother Zhou! You’ve come just in time!”

“Uh, what?” Zhou Li looked puzzled.

However, as a professional trouble-shooter, he had a keen sense for things.

Seeing Scholar Song’s unusually warm reception, Zhou Li immediately thought of one possibility. A bitter smile spread across his face. “Did Dou Dou get into trouble again?”

“Yeah, just recently, but it’s not as serious as last time,” Scholar Song admitted sheepishly.

“Scholar Song!” Zhou Li sighed and patted Scholar Song’s shoulder firmly. “You know, I’d love to have a long vacation and just relax for once…”

“Ah, haha!” Scholar Song laughed awkwardly.

“So, if possible, please keep a closer watch on Dou Dou. I’d like at least a week off; I could use a break and maybe go on a date,” Zhou Li lamented, his tone filled with endless sorrow.

So, he’s at the stage of wanting to date a fairy? Brother Zhou has it tough too.

“I’ll do my best!” Scholar Song felt a pang of guilt.

“Good luck, Scholar Song! I believe in you; you can do it!” Zhou Li sighed deeply. “Now, what exactly did Dou Dou do this time?”

“Um, Dou Dou just caused a little trouble while in Wenzhou City. He crashed into someone’s villa while street racing and also wrecked a Ferrari,” Scholar Song coughed.

Zhou Li fell silent for a moment, then curiously asked, “That’s it?”

“That’s it,” Scholar Song confirmed.

Zhou Li let out a sigh of relief. “Thank goodness! It’s just a problem that can be solved with money. We can sort it out quickly, no problem!”

With that, he set the person he was carrying down and handed them over to Scholar Song. “Here, Scholar Song. This is your little instructor Li, who fell into the universe. I’ve brought him back from the West.”

Little Instructor Li?

Scholar Song quickly helped the person up, feeling incredibly guilty—if it weren’t for him mistakenly grabbing the wrong person, Little Instructor Li wouldn’t have fallen back to America with the spaceship, and there wouldn’t have been so many complications afterward.

I hope Little Instructor Li hasn’t suffered too much.

Scholar Song inspected Little Instructor Li, finding him clean and well, except for a bit of paleness on his face. He didn’t seem to have been tortured.

Still, Scholar Song couldn’t help but ask, “Little Instructor Li didn’t suffer in the West, did he?”

“Fortunately, we arrived just in time; he didn’t suffer too much. If we had been late, it would have been hard to say—he might have faced severe physical or mental trauma,” Zhou Li replied with a chuckle. “Also, we’ve treated his original injuries and given him some medicinal herbs to make his body even stronger than before, so it’s a blessing in disguise.”

Scholar Song let out a sigh of relief. “That’s good to hear.”

“There’s just one small issue,” Zhou Li hesitated.

“What’s the issue?”

“It’s about his memory. Originally, we planned to erase his recent memories from the West because keeping those memories would only cause him pain. It would be better to wipe them away so he can live happily.

But… I don’t know if it’s because Little Instructor Li had his memory wiped too many times recently, but when we tried to delete his memories, it seems we couldn’t cleanly erase them.

We didn’t dare to continue deleting randomly, as it could easily turn him into an idiot. So, I brought him here for you to let Venerable White handle the memory issues,” Zhou Li chuckled.

“Got it, I understand.” Scholar Song nodded. “I’ll have Venerable White take care of his memory. By the way, do you want to come in for a bit?”

“No, no! I have to rush to Wenzhou City to handle the aftermath of Dou Dou’s mess! I’ll come by for a visit next time. I’ll see you later!” Zhou Li laughed awkwardly and quickly turned to leave.

After running for quite a distance, he turned back to send a voice message: “Oh, Scholar Song! The hypnosis technique we used on Little Instructor Li will wear off in about twenty minutes, so keep an eye on him then.”

With that, he took off running again...

“What was that all about? What’s he so worried about?” Scholar Song scratched his head, picking up Little Instructor Li and heading back upstairs.

Once Venerable White finishes his training, they can address Little Instructor Li’s memory, and then he can be sent back to the academy.

Hopefully, he hasn’t worried his family too much.

...

Scholar Song casually laid Little Instructor Li down on the sofa, estimating that he still had about twenty minutes before Little Instructor Li woke up. Hopefully, Venerable White would finish his training by then.

Scholar Song settled himself on the other sofa and began to meditate using the “True Self Meditation Sutra,” refining his mental strength.

Recently, he felt like his nasal passages were opening up, and he couldn’t let his mental strength lag behind!

Then… about seventeen or eighteen minutes into his meditation, Scholar Song suddenly felt something unusual; he heard a sound as if someone was moving around him.

Did Little Instructor Li wake up early?

Scholar Song opened his eyes.

He froze.

A desert… an endless stretch of desert, nothing but sand as far as the eye could see, devoid of any life.

He quickly looked up at the sky.

All he saw was a swirling black hole, slowly spinning.

“What the hell?!” Scholar Song couldn’t help but exclaim. How did he end up here again?

That sound he heard earlier—was it possibly...

He spun around abruptly to look toward the source of the noise.

In the distance of the desert, he saw a person riding a horse approaching him.

The horse was white, pure as snow, a magnificent steed!

The person was a young man, clad in blue garments, with rosy lips and white teeth, a strikingly handsome youth!
