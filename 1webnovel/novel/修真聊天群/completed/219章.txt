**Venerable White: I’ll Fix This Big Hole!**

It was quite terrifying when Venerable White zoned out. Every time he spaced out, there was an eighty percent chance that his ‘Fall Flat on the Ground’ skill would be triggered.

This skill was horrifying; even in a magical world, it ranked just below forbidden spells!

What made it even scarier was that Venerable White's zoning out was utterly unpredictable. One moment, he could be laughing and chatting with you, and the next, he’d suddenly be lost in thought.

Like right now—he had just been smiling, and then, bam, he was staring blankly into space.

“We’re going to crash, Venerable White! We’re going to crash! Wake up! Turn around… Ahhh, we can’t dodge it!” Scholar Song wanted to cry.

At the same time, he finally saw what they were about to crash into.

It was a massive cylindrical metal object, with four fan-like blades on either side, looking all kinds of cool.

A satellite?

No, satellites weren’t this big. This thing was over fifty meters long and nearly a hundred meters wide! It was filled with a sci-fi vibe, a testament to human innovation in this era!

“Could it be a space station?” Scholar Song’s mind raced.

This was bad!

If it was a satellite, even if they crashed into it, Venerable White would probably just destroy it and send the wreckage flying. Losing a satellite might affect Earth’s weather forecasts or mobile communications, but the chances of anyone getting hurt were slim.

But a space station was different! There were astronauts onboard, conducting research and performing daily maintenance. If they crashed into it… what would happen to the scientists inside?

Venerable White was still lost in thought.

Boom~~~

The flying sword collided violently with the space station, creating a massive hole in the right side of the station—though the sound was only in Scholar Song's imagination; sound couldn’t travel in a vacuum.

In space, any collision could be deadly. Even a tiny piece of space debris the size of a pill could take out a satellite.

Now, with the helicopter shell speeding through and crashing into the space station, it would definitely burst the entire station like a bullet piercing through a soda bottle!

…

…

Just as Scholar Song was filled with dread, suddenly, the protective shield Venerable White had set up around their ‘helicopter-style flying sword’ activated with full force!

This shield became a powerful buffer between the space station and the ‘helicopter-style flying sword.’ After creating that hole in the station, the helicopter stopped inflicting further damage.

Then, the flying sword seemed to run out of power, slowly coming to a halt…

Is it over?!

The space station wasn’t completely destroyed!

Scholar Song couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.

However, when he looked at the massive hole on the space station, he rubbed his face in frustration—what to do next?

If this space station was ruined because of that hole, it would definitely go down in history as the most costly traffic accident ever!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile, twenty minutes ago.

Inside the space station.

A bald man, dressed in a thick spacesuit, exclaimed, “Anthony, how long have we been stuck in this space station?”

“Oh, Akuro, we’ve been in this godforsaken place for five whole months! But today, we’re finally going home.” Another man, younger but with a head full of white hair, replied with a smile, “We’ve completed nearly sixty experiments here, and they’ve all been successful. Finally, I won’t have to look at your bald head every day!”

“Same here! I’ve been staring at your white hair for five months; I’m sick of it,” Akuro chuckled.

The two joked as they finished putting on their spacesuits.

Now they just had to wait for the manned spacecraft to come and take them back to Earth.

After spending five long months in this wretched place, even Anthony, the research fanatic, was feeling the strain. Thankfully, their suffering was nearing an end.

They waited for a long time, but the anticipated spacecraft was still nowhere to be seen.

Suddenly… the space station shook violently, as if something had crashed into it.

“Oh God, what the hell is happening?” Anthony shouted.

“Is it the manned spacecraft? But there was no notification or signal!” Akuro yelled back.

“Did we hit something? Quick, check the monitors!” Anthony shouted; they were in space, and if something went wrong, they could really be in trouble!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

The violent crash finally snapped Venerable White out of his daydream.

“Oh, what just happened?” Venerable White awkwardly slapped his cheeks, “Hmm, where was I? Oh, since we’re in space now, we should look for some small asteroids or something floating around to find a place to land.”

“No need, Senior.” Scholar Song chuckled nervously, “We crashed into something. If I’m right, we crashed into a space station.”

“Ah, we hit something? Did we break it?” Venerable White asked, still a bit dazed.

Scholar Song replied, “No, it’s still intact. The target is quite large. Plus, when we hit it, the shield activated, and it seems we didn’t have much power left; we only made a hole.”

“Oh, thank goodness—it’s not broken.” Venerable White looked relieved.

Yeah, fortunately, it’s not destroyed, Scholar Song thought to himself.

At that moment, the co-pilot, Instructor Xiao Li, groggily woke up again.

When he woke, he found himself wrapped in a full spacesuit. Then—he realized his hearing seemed to have returned! He could hear his own breathing.

However, his body below the neck was still immobile.

“Where am I?” Instructor Xiao Li asked, his voice tinged with panic, but it seemed his voice couldn’t carry out of the spacesuit; he could only hear himself.

Just then, a voice echoed directly in his mind, bypassing his ears: “You’re in space.”

Telepathy? Xiao Li jumped in shock and turned to look around. Then, he saw the pitch-black universe dotted with twinkling stars…

I’m really in space?

What on earth happened?

No, I need to sort this out.

Xiao Li recalled—today, he was teaching two special students how to fly a helicopter. It was an ordinary day.

The first student, named Scholar Song, flew the helicopter smoothly without any mishaps. It was a success.

Then, the second student, named Song Bai, also took flight in the helicopter.

Then… for some reason, his beloved helicopter seemed to have broken the sound barrier? The sonic boom was still fresh in his memory. What did I do?

I went deaf and then passed out.

Now, I wake up and I’m in space?

What kind of ridiculous development is this? Even the most clichéd plot twist wouldn’t write something this absurd!

After a moment, Instructor Xiao Li stiffly turned to Venerable White beside him and tearfully pleaded, “Mr. Song Bai, please take me back!”

Though he didn’t know exactly what had happened, he was certain it had something to do with this person, Song Bai!

“Don’t worry, I’ll take you back!” Venerable White replied.

“Wahhh…” For some reason, Instructor Xiao Li felt an overwhelming sense of sadness and began to cry out loud.

…

…

Scholar Song asked, “Venerable White, what do we do next?”

“Hmmm, I’ll erase Instructor Xiao Li’s recent memories and let him stay in the helicopter for now. Then… I’ll find a way to fix the hole we made in the space station!” Venerable White stated, and Scholar Song thought he detected a hint of excitement in his tone.

Wait, what did Venerable White just say? He’s going to fix the space station?

No way, that can’t happen!

Venerable White, who had problems even disassembling an air conditioner—not to mention all the appliances at home that had met their demise at his hands—was definitely not the right person for this job. Just look at the mess in the alchemical sage’s home!

Venerable White was a master of disassembling, but reassembling? No chance.

So, Scholar Song sincerely suggested, “Venerable White, it’s probably best if we let the space station’s crew handle the repairs. I feel we should quietly retreat instead?”

“No way! The hole we made has to be fixed by us,” Venerable White insisted. “I know what you’re worried about, but you don’t need to stress.”

“I’m no longer the person I was a week ago. After disassembling so many electrical appliances and machines, I’ve gained a deep understanding of modern electronics! That little hole in the space station? I can fix it!”

“Even if I can’t repair it completely, I still have spells! At worst, I’ll just use magic to seal the hole!”

Venerable White looked confident.

—That’s true; even if he can’t fix it perfectly, Venerable White can at least magically seal the hole. Then, the maintenance crew can come later to fix it up properly.

Scholar Song nodded to himself, feeling a bit more reassured.

…

…

Then, Venerable White began casting a spell on Instructor Xiao Li, preparing to erase his recent memories.

“Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!” Xiao Li shouted in confusion.

“Shut up! If you keep yelling, I might accidentally delete too many memories!” Venerable White threatened.

Xiao Li turned pale—delete memories?

Instantly, visions filled his mind: like the protagonist being abducted by aliens, undergoing horrifying experiments. After the experiments, they would brainwash him, erase his memories, and send him back to Earth to resume his life—only for him to unknowingly transform into a monster and wreak havoc on humanity…

And this poor protagonist was once a flight instructor, affectionately called Xiao Li by his colleagues.
