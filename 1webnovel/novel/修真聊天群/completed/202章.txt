**Is Venerable White Good-Looking?**

If luck is on your side, some precious items you carry may be hidden within the ‘blood mist’ and whisked away by the Blood Escape technique. 

In fact, if one cultivates the Blood Escape technique to its highest level, they only need a small patch of blood mist to escape and can return to their original state. The injuries sustained would only require a few years of recuperation to heal. Because of this, the Blood Escape technique dares to claim the title of a fifth-tier escape method capable of aiding one to flee from a true monarch's grasp.

However, every time the Blood Escape technique is deployed, a portion of the blood mist is destroyed, and the user permanently loses something—be it lifespan, potential limits, or physical strength. Yet, as long as one's life is preserved, such sacrifices are considered acceptable.

The Blood Escape technique utilized by the leader of the Jingmo Sect, though, wasn't as miraculous as the legends say. Since the Blood Escape technique was sealed within a magical talisman, its execution wasn't as flexible as when it is used directly.

“Oh? A blood escape spell? Quite interesting,” chuckled the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain—given his peak true monarch status, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to break this spell cast through a talisman.

But he didn’t act on it—he didn’t need to intervene.

Venerable White had already made his move.

With a swift gesture towards the sky, the air shimmered, and the world transformed. What was once just a clear sky suddenly morphed into a vast desert. 

There were no living beings, no plants. Apart from the endless yellow sands, this desert was utterly devoid of life.

The Jingmo Sect leader's blood mist scattered in countless forms, but no matter how it tried to escape, it couldn’t break free from the confines of this desert. Soon enough, the effect of the Blood Escape technique faded.

The Jingmo Sect leader reverted to his original form.

His face was pale; even the Blood Escape technique sealed within the talisman consumed half of his true essence. 

Coupled with the energy spent during the chase after Scholar Song, he was now left with barely a tenth of his power.

He quickly inspected his body, anxious about how much of his blood mist had been destroyed in front of a true sixth-tier monarch. 

What a loss! If he had known better, he wouldn’t have wasted time trying to torment that ‘Scholar Song’ kid; he should have just killed him outright!

Unexpectedly, that kid had a sixth-tier monarch by his side. Just thinking about it sent shivers down his spine.

After a thorough check, a smile crept onto his face—none of his blood mist had been destroyed! Aside from the depletion of his true essence, he was completely unharmed.

Even the 'pills, flying swords, and various treasures' he carried remained intact. Did that true monarch simply not bother to act when he realized the Blood Escape technique was futile?

I’m so lucky!

“A true monarch is nothing special,” he thought to himself, even deciding that once he ascended to the fifth-tier Spirit Emperor and solidified his golden core, he must learn the Blood Escape technique from his master as a life-saving secret.

Confirming he had sustained no injuries, the Jingmo Sect leader turned to survey his surroundings, trying to determine where he had flown.

“Did I land in a desert? How far did I fly?” he mused, realizing he needed to pinpoint his location to return to the nearby branch of the Wujimo Sect.

Suddenly, he felt something was off.

This desert… why does it seem familiar? Why do I feel like I’ve seen it somewhere before?

An endless expanse of desert, with no plants, no animals, just utter silence.

Wait!

I definitely recognized this scenery!

Just a few days ago, while controlling the 'Transformation Puppet' to push open the door of ‘Scholar Song’s’ home, I entered this very desert.

Then I encountered that sadistic boy in a green robe, who relentlessly smashed the puppet with a massive hammer, leaving it in shambles and causing me immense pain.

This is the same desert!

Why am I here?

Could it be I haven't escaped at all? How could that be? The Blood Escape technique is supposed to let one flee from a true monarch's grasp!

The Jingmo Sect leader’s heart raced.

At that moment, the desert began to crumble before his eyes and soon vanished entirely.

What’s happening?

As clarity returned to his vision, he found himself still in the same spot where he had cast the Blood Escape technique.

Hmm, if I were to calculate, this instantaneous Blood Escape technique only moved me… two centimeters?

The Jingmo Sect leader’s face turned ashen.

“You can’t run away now,” a melodious voice chimed from below.

Moments later, a handsome man in modern casual clothes with flowing black hair stepped out from the mist, smiling. Scholar Song was being pulled up into the sky by this man.

As a disciple from the grand sect of Wujimo, the Jingmo Sect leader quickly deduced what had just occurred—a real illusion.

“A seventh-tier Spirit Venerable,” he thought, on the verge of tears.

“Quite perceptive,” Venerable White remarked with a smile.

Upon hearing the confirmation, the Jingmo Sect leader felt a wave of despair wash over him.

“Scholar Song, how do you want to deal with him?” Venerable White asked.

Scholar Song had just managed to recover from a nauseous state and looked at the Jingmo Sect leader: “Did Young Master Hai send you here?”

“Bah! What qualification does Young Master Hai have to send me?” the Jingmo Sect leader retorted instinctively, unable to contain his temper even when facing a sixth-tier monarch and a seventh-tier venerable.

“Oh, it seems it’s not Young Master Hai’s style. Looks like you took the initiative to snatch my Blood God Diamond,” Scholar Song nodded slightly, then turned to Venerable White. “Can you please help me restrain him?”

Venerable White smiled and pointed at the Jingmo Sect leader. Instantly, the leader crumpled to the ground, losing consciousness and unable to move. The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain stepped forward and flicked his sleeve, producing a rope that tightly bound the Jingmo Sect leader.

“What will you do with him?” Venerable White inquired.

“Well, I think someone in the Ninefold Land One group will be quite interested in him,” Scholar Song said, pulling out his phone to make a call.

Soon, a deep male voice echoed from the other end: “Young friend Song, what can I do for you?”

“Ah-Qi, I’ve captured a disciple from the Wujimo Sect. Are you interested in coming over?” Scholar Song asked with a weary smile.

“Hahaha, a disciple from the Wujimo Sect? I’m very interested! Keep your phone on; I’ll be right there!” Sable Seven laughed heartily.

Taking advantage of the opportunity, Scholar Song quietly asked, “Ah-Qi, can I ask how Sable Sixteen is doing now… uh!”

Before he could finish his sentence, Sable Seven had already hung up.

Ah-Qi is rather impatient. Well, I’ll ask about Sable Sixteen’s condition when he arrives.

...

Meanwhile, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain landed beside Scholar Song and teased, “Young friend Song, are you interested in Sable Sixteen? She’s quite a nice girl. If your strength were a bit stronger, there might be a chance for you two to become partners.”

“That’s not the case. I’ve only met Sable Sixteen a few times,” Scholar Song replied. “I just know she was seriously injured, and since we’re friends, I wanted to ask about her recovery.”

“Don’t worry, Sable Seven’s family is the Tianhe Su Clan; they’re much more powerful than you think. Sable Sixteen should be fine,” the Immortal Sage reassured him.

As they descended back into the mist, the Immortal Sage casually tossed the unconscious Jingmo Sect leader aside and asked, “Young friend Song, is Dou Dou doing well these days?”

“He should be fine; he’s been in good spirits lately,” Scholar Song responded thoughtfully—he almost mentioned that Dou Dou even made a human girlfriend, but he realized that might not be a suitable topic for the Immortal Sage, so he held back.

“It must have caused you quite a bit of trouble, right?” the Immortal Sage sighed. He genuinely couldn’t understand how he, a talented scholar of the ancient times, ended up with a goofy little Pekingese like Dou Dou. Did naming it ‘Dou Dou’ somehow double its absurdity?

“That’s not the case. In fact, Dou Dou has helped me quite a bit,” Scholar Song quickly waved his hand, speaking the truth.

The Immortal Sage patted Scholar Song heavily on the back: “Don’t be so polite; I know what kind of creature Dou Dou is! Don’t worry, once this is over, I’ll give you a big red envelope—double the amount! Take your time to think about what you really want when you go back these days.”

“Thank you, senior,” Scholar Song could only express his gratitude.

“By the way, I told you to look at the photos of the fairies in the group more often. Have you been checking them out?” the Immortal Sage asked in a low voice, creating a miniature soundproof barrier around them.

“Ah, I did check out a selfie of Lychee Fairy once,” Scholar Song replied after thinking for a moment.

“Just once?” the Immortal Sage exclaimed.

He then leaned in and asked quietly, “What do you think of Venerable White?”

“Very good. Just as everyone in the group said, he’s a senior who takes great care of his juniors,” Scholar Song pondered for a bit before replying.

The Immortal Sage paused, thinking, that’s not what I meant!

Then, he gritted his teeth and directly asked, “Do you find Venerable White good-looking?”

“Very good-looking,” Scholar Song answered without hesitation.

At the same time, he couldn’t help but recall the time he nearly got himself into trouble—the scene when Venerable White radiated charm, turning the world black and white while he stood in color. He added, “There was a moment when I thought Venerable White was truly the most beautiful person in the world.”

The Immortal Sage stared at Scholar Song for a moment, then lowered the soundproof barrier.

He silently distanced himself from Scholar Song, keeping a cautious three-meter gap.

He recalled the time when he mistakenly added the ID ‘Scholar Song’ to the Ninefold Land One group and had read the fortune for him three times.

Back then, he felt those three readings were utterly absurd.

Now, he began to feel that this young friend Scholar Song might be a bit dangerous in thought. Should he consider keeping his distance from him for the time being?
