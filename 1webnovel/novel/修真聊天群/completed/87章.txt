**A Path to Survival? Allow Me to Provide One!**

In the slightly quiet carriage, the crisp sound of a collision rang out, startling everyone and making it impossible to ignore.

The pale-faced altar master shot a glance at the young man from the corner of his eye, and then his gaze fixed on the pendant hanging from him. His mouth fell open slightly, utterly stunned.

“Sorry to interrupt you two,” the young man said, a teasing smile playing on his lips as he looked at the altar master. “Do you need me to introduce myself?”

Then, he casually continued, “My name is Scholar Song.”

Just a plain, cultured male name.

The Western monk was baffled as to why this mysterious young man would introduce himself at such a moment. But then he noticed the altar master’s expression change dramatically!

That face reflected sheer terror, as if facing the apocalypse!

Could it be? The monk's heart raced with excitement.

Seeing this reaction, Scholar Song lowered his gaze, and his smile widened.

Then, with a flick of his fingers, he produced a talisman and shouted, “Break!”

It was the Evil-Breaking Talisman!

A surge of violent, unmatched spiritual energy exploded from the talisman!

This was a power so formidable that the altar master and the Western monk could hardly fathom it; it swept through the entire carriage like a hurricane.

In an instant, the negative energy that belonged to the ghostly beings within the carriage was obliterated, one by one!

The little specters previously released by the altar master to destroy the surveillance in the car didn’t even have time to wail before they were crushed by the immense spiritual force, disintegrating into tiny particles of energy in the air!

Even the ghost general Ku You, who was clinging to the altar master, couldn’t escape. It was caught in the tempest of spiritual energy and was directly dissolved.

“Wuwu~~” the ghost general Ku You let out a pitiful cry as it hastily retreated from the carriage.

But it was futile!

The power of the Evil-Breaking Talisman relentlessly pursued the ghost general, driving it out of the carriage by two compartments!

By the time the power of the talisman dissipated, Ku You was left with only a fraction of its ghostly form, weakened to the point of immobility, curled up helplessly in the carriage.

All of this unfolded in a matter of moments!

Then, the Western monk felt a sudden brightness; the ghostly negative energy enveloping the carriage had been completely eradicated, restoring illumination inside. The passengers, who had been trapped in terrifying illusions, calmed down, no longer trembling in fear, as if they had simply fallen into a deep sleep.

Joy surged in the monk’s heart—using a famous saying from China, he felt like he had been at a dead end, only to find a hidden path through the dark willows and blooming flowers!

But the altar master’s face was ashen, retreating repeatedly.

He was a practitioner of the dark arts, and his internal true qi was heavily tainted with yin and cold energy. Although he wouldn’t be outright purified by the Evil-Breaking Talisman, he had suffered immensely in the tempest of spiritual power. Coupled with the severe poison in his body, things were looking dire.

But what was worse was that this Scholar Song… how could he be here?

The altar master felt his legs tremble, unable to stand steady.

According to the clues left by the four special drugs, this senior should have been heading to the Yuanlong Pharmacy! Why was he here?

Could it be… that this was all part of the other party’s trap? Everything, just to force him into this cramped carriage?

Had his good fortune never truly come? Was the previous stroke of luck merely the reflection of a dying man’s return?

What a joke!

…

…

Scholar Song's smile grew more pronounced… now he could confirm the true identity of the ghost practitioner in front of him.

Seeing the talisman and becoming dazed instead of astonished; hearing the name Scholar Song and being struck with fear; and then, after he unleashed the Evil-Breaking Talisman, the altar master turning ashen, wishing to flee at once. Plus, there was a faint, special scent of medicine wafting from him.

Without a doubt, he was the altar master.

Who would have thought he was on the subway leaving the “Yuanlong Pharmacy”? That was close; he almost missed him.

Fortunately, he had encountered that adorable little girl today, and his “good person attribute” had kicked in, causing him to ride with her for three extra stops. Otherwise, if he had rushed to the Yuanlong Pharmacy today, he would have surely failed to find any leads on the altar master.

It truly was a case of needing to tread through iron shoes without finding anything, and then discovering it all without effort!

Who says good people don’t get good rewards?

Sometimes being a good person can indeed bring good fortune!

Though the scene unfolding before him was different from what he had planned—he had encountered the altar master face-to-face ahead of schedule.

But he welcomed this change!

So, what should he do now?

Utilize everything at his disposal: the three types of talismans, the invisible flying sword, and… the identity of Scholar Song!

What he needed to do now was maintain a commanding presence, an intimidating aura!

He had to uphold the image of a senior expert, shaking the ground if necessary, solidifying his dominance. Otherwise, if the altar master saw through him, he could be killed in an instant.

In short, it was show-off time.

Moreover, he had to show off in a way that demonstrated real skill. If he failed to impress, the consequences would be dire.

With many thoughts racing in his mind, Scholar Song maintained an expression of calm detachment and said, “Alright, without those filthy entities, we can have a proper chat now.”

Such nonchalance made it seem as if he had merely blown away the ghostly beings in the carriage with a breath.

…

…

A proper chat? About how I’m going to die?

At this moment, the altar master could only think one thing: escape.

It must be said that sometimes a human's "first impression" is crucial. The altar master was convinced Scholar Song was a senior expert, no longer harboring any doubts! As a cautious and timid ghost practitioner, he had studied various escape methods thoroughly. There was no escape route he couldn’t devise.

This Scholar Song was unfathomable, wealthy, and cruel, skilled in poisons. He was currently in a weakened state, having been afflicted by the other party’s deadly poison. He could see no chance of victory; it was all about fleeing.

As long as he preserved his life, he could find more opportunities later!

However, just as this thought crossed his mind, he saw the young Scholar Song slowly draw forth an invisible, intangible object.

It was something his eyes could not see, but… he could faintly sense a dangerous, sharp aura emanating from it.

This feeling reminded him of many years ago when he sensed it near a powerful cultivator; it was a flying sword! Capable of taking a head from a thousand miles away as easily as reaching into a pocket, it described the speed of a flying sword, unmatched by anything else.

He recalled when he had only been a first-tier cultivator, fortunate enough to follow several senior cultivators to explore an ancient immortal relic.

During that time, he had felt the urge to relieve himself, so he had taken the opportunity to urinate in a corner. At that moment, a senior cultivator had suddenly summoned their flying sword, swiftly beheading an enemy before it returned. The entire process… the altar master hadn’t even finished his business.

Faced with such a treasure, he found there was nowhere to flee, and the altar master quietly halted his retreat.

…

…

‘Just as I suspected, even if it’s invisible to the naked eye, as long as I hold the flying sword and consciously reveal its presence, cultivators above the second tier will have some sense of it.’ Scholar Song sighed inwardly with relief.

Earlier, he had sensed the altar master’s intent to escape, and he thought to use the flying sword to intimidate him—he absolutely couldn’t let the altar master get away. Otherwise, amidst the vast sea of people, it would be far too difficult to find him again.

At the same time, he discreetly clutched a ‘sword talisman’; if the altar master desperately tried to flee, he would strike with the talisman. But that was a last resort—Scholar Song couldn’t be sure if a single sword talisman would be enough to take down the altar master.

Fortunately, the altar master was now daunted by the aura of the ‘flying sword’.

Scholar Song wore a mysterious smile and said, “Heh, you want to escape? Do you think you can escape from my hands?”

—How embarrassing! When referring to himself as “this seat,” Scholar Song felt goosebumps rising on his back.

“Scholar Song, I didn’t recognize your greatness. I apologize for disturbing you. Please… grant me a path to survival,” the altar master bitterly pleaded for his life, seeing no way to retreat.

He believed there was no escaping this fate…

The “path to survival” would likely cost him an unimaginable price. Plus, it was uncertain whether such a path even existed.

“Path to survival? Hahaha.” Scholar Song burst into laughter… using the time of his laughter, his mind raced with countless plans.

“I’ve already given you plenty of chances, haven’t I?” Scholar Song retorted.

The altar master was suddenly flooded with regret; it was he who had mistakenly assumed this ‘senior’ was merely an ordinary person, blinded by greedy thoughts, repeatedly testing this ‘senior.’

“However, I can give you one last chance,” Scholar Song said, pressing both hands against the flying sword, exuding the aura of a skilled master. He looked down at the altar master and continued coldly, “So that no one spreads word of me pressuring a weak junior, tarnishing my reputation.”

[Before me stands nothing but an ant, just an ant, an ant!] Scholar Song continued to look down at the altar master, his gaze devoid of any emotion.

At that moment, the altar master felt that Scholar Song’s gaze… was like that of an ancient demon god, mockingly observing the tiny ant beneath his finger. It was utterly terrifying!
