**Question: How stylish is it to drive a hand-operated tractor? (A bonus chapter for the alliance leader)**

    "Are we driving back ourselves? Sounds good!" Venerable White said, beaming with joy. "Then I’ll choose!"

    "Yeah, Wenzhou City isn’t far, just a few hundred kilometers. It’s more convenient to drive back ourselves," Scholar Song replied. "Let’s pick a vehicle with a spacious interior for our luggage."

    Scholar Song had a large suitcase in hand, packed with a million in cash, pills, the treasured saber Broken Dominance, Soul Orbs, and the precious Lingmai Bi Tea among other items.

    "Hmm, actually, I’ve already set my eyes on a specific one. Let’s go with that one; it really catches my eye!" Venerable White pointed enthusiastically at a powerful-looking vehicle.

    Scholar Song looked up and opened his mouth, but no sound came out.

    Where to learn about excavators? Shandong, China… Ah, no!

    "Venerable White, that’s an excavator, not a vehicle for transportation. It’s specifically designed for digging. If you’re really interested, we can take it out for a spin after we return from Wenzhou City," Scholar Song forced a smile.

    Venerable White had just come out of seclusion, and although he had learned a lot about modern knowledge from the internet, the information there was chaotic. There were still many things he hadn’t fully grasped.

    "Oh, oh, what about that one next to it? Is it also an engineering vehicle?" Venerable White pointed to another similarly imposing machine.

    "Yes, it’s also an engineering vehicle. That’s a bulldozer, used for clearing land and road constructions. If you like it, we can take it for a ride after we get back," Scholar Song sighed.

    Before Venerable White could point again, Scholar Song took the initiative to introduce the third vehicle: "Now this is a tractor… ah, it’s a hand-operated one. Ahem, this model is for transport, primarily used for transporting crops in rural areas."

    Scholar Song wasn’t entirely sure—because even though it was a farm tractor, he remembered seeing these hand-operated tractors in his childhood, roaring past his house while hauling sand or cement, leaving behind a trail of black smoke.

    Speaking of which, where did the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain get this old relic? And it’s even brand new? It wouldn’t be from a factory rush order, would it?

    This vehicle was the kind that required a "tractor joystick" to be inserted and cranked vigorously to start. If he remembered correctly, most roads prohibited such vehicles now, right?

    Only in some remote areas might you still find someone using these hand-operated tractors.

    Scholar Song looked over the tractor and noticed a barrel of diesel behind it… was it spare fuel? It seemed like the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain was quite thoughtful in his preparations.

    "For transport, huh? The front seat can squeeze in another person. We can both drive! This one’s perfect!" Venerable White exclaimed, his eyes sparkling as he had his mind set on this robust model. The first two were engineering vehicles, while this one could transport people and goods—perfect!

    "No way, Venerable! This vehicle isn’t allowed on the road anymore!" Scholar Song protested. "Let’s pick a different one!"

    "Nope, I’ve set my heart on it. Not being roadworthy doesn’t matter; I can draw an invisibility formation on it. Just before we reach your house, I’ll take it off!" Venerable White declared as he hopped onto the tractor.

    Curiously, he grasped the tractor’s handlebars—this hand-operated style certainly offered a unique sense of fun compared to a steering wheel.

    Once his curiosity was piqued, he was determined to have this one!

    "Venerable, please reconsider. Let’s choose another vehicle. This one can’t go fast; it tops out at thirty or so!" Scholar Song urged.

    Even driving a lady’s car back would be better; at least it would offer some shelter from the wind and rain. This ancient hand-operated tractor had no windshield, leaving them completely exposed.

    "No problem, with the slow speed, I can speed it up. I have plenty of experience now; I won’t damage the vehicle. I’ll just carve a formation to reduce air resistance and lighten the load. It’ll be fine; this is the one!" Venerable White insisted.

    Scholar Song racked his brain for a solution and then had a lightbulb moment: "Venerable, we can’t drive this type of vehicle with our licenses; we can only drive small cars."

    Venerable White pulled out his driving license and scrutinized it: "No way, my license allows me to drive all types of vehicles!"

    Scholar Song leaned over to take a look and saw it had A1 and A2 classifications. It was the kind of license that allowed for all sorts of vehicles.

    The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain was certainly well-prepared!

    "Besides, since we’re going to be invisible, it doesn’t matter if we have a license or not," Venerable White laughed heartily.

    Scholar Song was left speechless.

    ＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

    In the end, Scholar Song couldn’t change Venerable White’s mind.

    Venerable White had developed a special fondness for this lone "hand-operated" vehicle. Just look at him now—he hadn’t even started the tractor, and he was already sitting in the driver’s seat, gripping the handlebars, swaying back and forth, his body moving rhythmically…

    There was no saving this.

    Was he really going to drive this thing back to Wenzhou City? Just thinking about the image made him cringe.

    —If only he hadn’t given Venerable White the chance to choose, he could have just picked any vehicle to drive back.

    Well, it was too late for that; he had no choice but to accept it.

    Scholar Song placed his suitcase in the back of the hand-operated tractor, along with Instructor Xiao Li.

    He and Venerable White climbed into the front of the tractor, casually tossing the vehicle registration documents for the thirty or so vehicles the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain had entrusted him into the small compartment beside them.

    "Let’s hit the road!" Venerable White declared with gusto!

    However.

    Moments later, after fiddling with the tractor for a bit, Venerable White asked, "Scholar, how do you start this thing?"

    "……" Scholar Song sighed, pulled out the tractor joystick, and made his way to the front of the tractor. He pressed down on the pressure release lever and inserted the joystick.

    Then, he bent over and gripped the joystick tightly, cranking it with all his might.

    He had seen others start a tractor when he was a kid, so he had a vague memory of how it was done.

    Ugh, he didn’t even want to think about the position he was in right now; it was probably so embarrassing it would make anyone blush.

    "Vroom, vroom, vroom…" The tractor roared to life, spewing out a cloud of black smoke.

    Wait… did I just do something foolish—if the tractor didn’t start, wouldn’t I have the chance to choose another vehicle? Why did I go all out cranking this thing?

    Scholar Song felt tears welling up in his eyes.

    "Ah, you had to do it like that? How interesting! Next time I’ll give it a try," Venerable White laughed.

    "Haha," Scholar Song let out a dry laugh as he pulled out the joystick.

    "Alright, let’s roll!" Venerable White shouted.

    As he had been busy experimenting with the tractor’s handlebars earlier, he had already figured out how to drive it. Once Scholar Song was on board, Venerable White started the tractor, leaving behind a trail of black smoke as they charged out of the underground garage.

    "Interesting! The speed might be slow, but it’s got a nice feel to it!" Venerable White commented.

    Of course, it had a nice feel; it was hand-operated after all, and the front was quite heavy.

    —Well, if Venerable White was happy with the tractor, then so be it.

    …

    …

    After exiting the underground garage, Scholar Song pressed the remote to close the garage door.

    Venerable White then snapped his fingers, activating the defensive formation he had laid out earlier. With all the vehicles gathered, the security of the garage was now in the hands of Scholar Song and Venerable White, as the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain’s agent had mentioned.

    And so, Venerable White drove the tractor, carrying Scholar Song and Instructor Xiao Li, speeding towards the flight school…

    Once they exited the garage, they were on the main road.

    Between 9 and 10 AM was the peak time for traffic.

    Scholar Song couldn’t shake off the feeling that he and Venerable White had become the center of attention… countless pairs of eyes were fixated on them, making it feel like they were on display!

    ＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

    In Wenzhou City, on White Whale Road.

    This was Scholar Song’s hometown.

    It was Wednesday, and today, Father Song had taken a day off from work to be at home.

    The main reason was that there was an important guest coming over today, and Father Song wanted to be there to greet him.

    "Has Old Lu arrived yet?" Mother Song asked as she brought a plate of spicy chicken cubes from the kitchen to the table.

    The table was already filled with seven dishes, yet Mother Song was still working hard to add more.

    "That old guy hasn’t shown up yet. He hasn’t dared to come here all year, and now suddenly he says he’s bringing his son. Hmph, it can’t be for anything good," Father Song adjusted his glasses, looking displeased.

    He then added with disdain, "I can guess his purpose just by using my toes—apparently, his son dropped out a few years back and went into business, making some money. Now, he’s definitely here to flaunt his son’s accomplishments. Just watch, I’ll bet you he’ll walk in and immediately start bragging about his son. The first things he’ll mention will definitely be his career, luxury cars, and mansions. It won’t stray far from those!"

    "Hmph…" Mother Song couldn’t help but laugh, "Isn’t this something you started yourself?"

    Mother Song remembered how last year, Scholar Song worked hard for his college entrance exams and got into the prestigious Jiangnan University.

    After that, Father Song would take Scholar Song to Old Lu’s house all the time.

    As soon as they stepped into Old Lu’s house, Father Song would boast about how well his son was doing, how he was accepted into Jiangnan University. Then he would compare it with Old Lu’s son, who had dropped out, reveling in his own sense of superiority.

    Eventually, Mother Song couldn’t stand it anymore and firmly forbade Father Song from dragging Scholar Song to Old Lu’s house, which finally put an end to Father Song’s bragging.

    After that, Old Lu had been unable to find anything to boast about for almost a year, as he had been waiting for an opportunity to show off in front of Father Song.

    Speaking of which, Old Lu and Father Song had been friends for decades, competing with each other in every way possible since childhood.

    From height, studies, career, wives, to sons, whenever one had an advantage over the other, they would gleefully run to show off, deriving joy from each other’s misfortunes.

    "Ugh, just thinking about what luxury car Old Lu’s son will be driving when he arrives makes my stomach hurt!" Father Song said, feeling gloomy…
