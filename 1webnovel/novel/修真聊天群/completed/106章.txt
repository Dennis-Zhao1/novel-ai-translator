**Chest Muscles Look Great**

“Isn't Sable Sixteen injured?” Hermit of North River couldn't believe it.

Sable Seven sighed, “I’ve been searching for a way to treat Sable Sixteen’s injuries these past few days, and I went on a long trip. When I returned to the Su Clan today, I found out that Sable Sixteen was missing. Some clan members said that as soon as I left, Sable Sixteen ran away.”

Hermit of North River frowned, “Ran away? With so many people in the Su Clan, you couldn’t keep track of an injured Sable Sixteen?”

Feeling a bit embarrassed, Sable Seven replied, “Sable Sixteen used a secret method I left behind for running away from home. And… by the time the family realized Sable Sixteen was missing, he was already long gone. They’ve been searching for several days without any luck.”

“Even with so many people, you can’t find an injured Sable Sixteen?” Hermit of North River was skeptical.

Sable Seven sighed, explaining that after he returned to the Su Clan, he had given a good beating to four useless clan members. But family matters couldn’t be aired out, so he had no one to complain to.

Hermit of North River dropped the internal matters of the Su Clan and asked, “Do you have any news about Sable Sixteen now?”

“Yeah, I placed a mark on one of Sable Sixteen’s magical treasures. While it’s not as precise as a spiritual imprint, it should allow me to sense that Sable Sixteen is likely in the Jiangnan area,” Sable Seven explained. Since it was Sable Sixteen’s treasure, leaving a spiritual imprint would affect the owner’s ability to use it, so he only left a secondary mark. However, this secondary mark only provided a vague area range.

As for the type of spiritual imprint that Sable Sixteen could leave on his own magical tools, those had all been left back at the Su Clan. After all, Sable Sixteen had snuck away quietly; how could he possibly take something that would expose his whereabouts?

Then, Sable Seven added, “I’ll set off tonight to head over and bring Sable Sixteen back as soon as possible. I also want to ask if any friends in the group are near Jiangnan to help me look for Sable Sixteen. I would be extremely grateful.”

That was the main reason he logged in.

Scholar Song raised an eyebrow when he read this—so Sable Sixteen had also made his way to Jiangnan?

Upon hearing that Sable Seven had a way to find Sable Sixteen, Hermit of North River let out a sigh of relief and said, “Why is everyone running off to that city in Jiangnan? Speaking of that place, it reminds me of a young friend.”

“A young friend? Has Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain added a new acquaintance?” Sable Seven inquired.

Hermit of North River shook his head with a smirk, “You remember ‘Mountain of Books is Stressful,’ right?”

“Oh, the one who was mistakenly added by Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain?” Sable Seven immediately asked, since such a peculiar title was hard to forget.

“He's now a little friend. The story is quite interesting; I’ll share it with you when I get the chance. I remember he’s located in Jiangnan University City. If fate allows, you might have the opportunity to meet,” Hermit of North River chuckled.

Scholar Song saw this and quickly popped in to say hi—after all, the group was full of seniors, and it would be good to get familiar faces for future tasks!

Mountain of Books is Stressful: “Good evening, Sable Seven!”

“Right on time, it’s just the hour when students are finishing their classes,” Hermit of North River laughed.

Scholar Song replied, “I’m taking a break today, just finished training and had dinner with friends.”

“Are you from the Jiangnan area? Haha, if we get the chance to meet, I’ll give you a welcome gift. But enough chit-chat, I’m preparing to head out and find Sable Sixteen as soon as possible. You all keep chatting.” Sable Seven finished and logged off.

He didn’t have time to linger in the chat; he just wanted to ask the friends in the group to help keep an eye out for Sable Sixteen.

After sighing, Sable Seven let out a light whistle, and his magic sword shot up into the sky, transforming into a streak of light. He stepped onto the light and vanished into the night.

……

……

Scholar Song spent some more time chatting in the group while adding a few new seniors as friends. Ever since he took on the task of ‘Hosting Venerable White,’ seniors in the group had started adding him one after the other.

Scholar Song suspected these seniors had ulterior motives, probably wanting to know his state after he finished hosting Venerable White. Some might even want to record his reactions, just like Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain did back then.

Others who added him were likely interested in visiting Scholar Song’s gaming farm and ranch.

He didn’t expect that playing farm games could help him get familiar with the seniors even faster… Scholar Song casually opened his space before bed, ready to check on his farm.

When he opened his space, he saw a picture posted by the already-friend ‘Wild Blade of Three Tides.’

The background was an endless ocean, with a giant whale surfacing. A handsome young man with a mischievous smile floated in midair, supported by a streak of light transformed from a curved blade beneath him.

“The scenery of the East Sea is beautiful; looking at the ocean can make one feel broad-minded!”

Below the post were a series of likes from Hermit of North River, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram, and others in the group.

Hermit of North River: I thought you would post a landscape photo of the East Sea; I didn’t expect a fool to ruin the view from above.

Master Tongxuan: Thumbs up emoji.

Fairy Ye: Hey, Little Tide, those chest muscles look great; no wonder you dare to call yourself broad-minded.

Sable Seven: Nice chest muscles +1.

Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram: Came for the chest.

Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram: @Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, I was wrong, let me off! Thirty days is too long!

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain: Haha!

Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram: @Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, this is so unfair; that guy North River is already free, so why do I still have to be grounded?!

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain: Haha!!

Wild Blade of Three Tides: @Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, of course, if it’s a black hexagram, you need to be grounded for another ten to fifteen days. Can I be let out now? Also, North River, you bastard, who are you calling a fool? Let’s settle this one-on-one!

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain: Haha!!!

Scholar Song thought for a moment, silently liked the photo, and didn’t dare to say much. Then he tidied up his farm, planting some new valuable crops.

After that, he closed his computer, washed up, and went to sleep.

Later, as Scholar Song fell asleep, a small black dot appeared not far from his bed, gradually growing larger. Even though Scholar Song maintained his mental alertness, he failed to notice this small black dot!

**June 10**

Scholar Song took another day off and went with Tu Bo to the driving school for theoretical classes.

Of course… in reality, attending these theoretical classes wasn’t mandatory. You just had to swipe your card to sign in in the morning and then swipe it again at two in the afternoon.

Whether you studied or not for the theory exam was entirely up to you; if you failed, you’d just have to pay for a retake.

“Since I took a day off, I’ll go play at Yang De’s place for a bit. What about you, Scholar Song?” Tu Bo asked.

“I need to go to the hospital to send my sister, Zhao Yaya, to the train station,” Scholar Song replied with a smile. The sports meeting had concluded, and Zhao Yaya’s internship had also come to an end.

Now she was at the affiliated hospital of Jiangnan University City, saying goodbye to a few familiar faces. After having lunch together, she was going to catch a train out of Jiangnan University City. He needed to send her off.

“Alright, I won’t accompany you then. See you in the afternoon!” Tu Bo said, recalling that Zhao Yaya made him a bit uneasy.

……

……

Ten minutes later, Scholar Song arrived at the hospital and headed straight for the lounge to find Zhao Yaya.

Fifteen minutes later, at the entrance of the hospital, a hurried-looking office worker stepped into the building. After a slight pause, he quickly walked towards Building 8B.
