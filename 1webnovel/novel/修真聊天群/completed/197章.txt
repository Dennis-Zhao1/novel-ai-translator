**Natural Disaster or Manmade Calamity?**

A man, proudly riding on a gourd, introduced himself as the Half-Gourd Daoist. As a loose cultivator, reaching the fourth level of cultivation was quite a remarkable feat.

The Half-Gourd Daoist was acutely aware of the struggles that loose cultivators faced. Without the support of a sect, the resources required for cultivation only grew heavier as one progressed. He felt the burden weighing increasingly on him.

Thus, he went to great lengths to befriend the leader of the Jingmo Guild, Jingmo himself.

The journey to becoming friends with Jingmo was truly a painful memory.

Jingmo, with his explosive personality, was like a walking stick of dynamite—no one could tell when he might suddenly explode and start swinging his fists.

To earn Jingmo’s friendship, the Half-Gourd Daoist had to master the art of getting beaten up—he needed to find the perfect balance in being 'punished' during Jingmo's rampages. He had to make sure that Jingmo enjoyed himself while also putting up some resistance to demonstrate his own strength, making it clear he wasn't a weakling.

Thus, every time, he had to engage in a fierce battle with the rampaging Jingmo for hundreds of rounds before eventually appearing to be overwhelmed and defeated. He had acted out this scene dozens of times, and it was no easy task.

Fortunately, his efforts finally paid off, and he and Jingmo became good friends.

Because of Jingmo’s personality, it was difficult for him to make friends, which made him cherish the Half-Gourd Daoist even more—though he still had his moments of violent outbursts.

However, when benefits came around, Jingmo would always remember his 'only' friend.

Through his connection with Jingmo, the Half-Gourd Daoist received plenty of advantages from the 'Wuji Demon Sect.' Now, he waited for the opportunity to promote himself to the fifth level of Spirit Monarch, which would give him a chance to join the Wuji Demon Sect and possibly even become a branch leader!

This trip was also meant to allow him to support Jingmo and deepen their friendship.

Three-Day Brother dropped Scholar Song off in a secluded corner of the village, setting him down gently.

“Scholar, I’ll be on my way. I can’t wait to dive into all these spirit ghosts I’ve collected!” Three-Day Brother said with a grin, looking at Scholar Song.

“Wishing you success soon!” Scholar Song waved cheerfully.

Three-Day Brother clasped his hands together in a gesture of respect before taking off, his form disappearing into the sky with a flash.

Dragging a box and a large bundle, Scholar Song made his way to his grandpa Tu Bo’s house.

“If only I had a spatial ring or a storage bag right now,” Scholar Song murmured to himself.

But he was merely daydreaming; he knew that even the Alchemical Sage said that his entire fortune wouldn't be enough to trade for a spatial ring. Unless he struck it lucky, high-level equipment was simply out of reach.

After all, he wasn't Venerable White, who could have anything he wanted.

……

……

Upon returning to his grandpa Tu Bo’s house, Scholar Song first placed the box and medicinal materials in the back of a two-door car.

However, the trunk space was quite limited, making it inconvenient to store everything.

Sigh, he should have asked Three-Day Brother to cast an illusion on these items. Or perhaps, he should have just driven a regular sedan instead. Hopefully, nothing would go wrong with what he left in the car…

After locking the car, Scholar Song prepared to head inside.

At that moment, Tu Bo, his grandpa, and Li Yangde appeared, all dressed casually, carrying several baskets as they approached from the house.

“Hey, Scholar, you’re back!” Tu Bo laughed joyfully. “We were just about to call you. We’re heading up the mountain to pick mulberries. Want to come with us?”

“Sure, let’s go!” Scholar Song replied with a smile.

“Do you want to change your clothes? There are a lot of mosquitoes up in the mountains,” Tu Bo asked.

“No need, I’m not that delicate,” Scholar Song grinned—he still had the 'Sealing Soul Ice Pearl' on him. Ordinary mosquitoes wouldn't dare come near him, and those that did would quickly meet their end due to the chilling aura of the pearl.

“Alright, then let’s set off!” Tu Bo and Li Yangde enthusiastically led the way, with Scholar Song following behind them.

After walking for a while, Tu Bo’s grandpa intentionally slowed his pace to walk alongside Scholar Song.

He seemed to have something he wanted to say.

“Is there something on your mind, Grandpa?” Scholar Song asked with a smile.

“Scholar, I just wanted to ask about that girl who came with you last time. How close are you two? When can you bring her over to play?” Tu Bo’s grandpa tried to keep his tone casual.

Scholar Song blinked, “Um, that girl has been a bit busy lately and hasn’t been able to leave home.”

If he were to invite Fay Yu out to have fun, she would definitely be thrilled. However, she had been busy 'synchronizing' with the spirit ghosts and was still in seclusion.

Tu Bo’s grandpa’s expression twitched slightly, and he let out a disappointed sigh.

After a moment, he asked, “Scholar, do you have a way to contact her? Maybe describe the happenings in the village? We could use her advice remotely.”

The villagers were truly at their wits' end… no one could figure out the cause of the mysterious illness that had spread, nor could they explain the bizarre incidents occurring around the village. Even the most skeptical individuals were starting to feel uneasy.

Scholar Song gently shook his head—there was no longer a need for that, as the ghosts in the village had already been dealt with.

Tu Bo’s grandpa sighed in disappointment again, finally turning his gaze back to Scholar Song. “Scholar, is there any way you can help solve the village’s problems?”

“Grandpa, I’m not really skilled in that area,” Scholar Song replied.

Tu Bo’s grandpa looked utterly disheartened.

Scholar Song felt a pang of sympathy and thought for a moment before softly saying, “But Grandpa, perhaps the causes of your ailments are only temporary? Maybe things will get better in a few days?”

“In a few days?” Tu Bo’s grandpa paused, suddenly recalling a moment not long ago when he felt a sudden chill in his body, which quickly passed. Hope sparked in his heart.

He nodded quietly, “Let’s hope so.”

After a moment, he hesitantly asked, “Scholar, do you think there are really ghosts in this world?”

“If you believe, then there are; if you don’t, then there aren’t,” Scholar Song answered. He had no intention of introducing Tu Bo’s grandpa to the ‘cultivator world’—it was best to keep such matters under wraps to avoid dragging him into any trouble.

“Regardless of whether they exist or not, I feel much more relaxed with you around,” Tu Bo’s grandpa chuckled.

Soon after, he led the three young men to his mulberry grove.

Perhaps it was truly the comfort from Scholar Song that had an effect, but Tu Bo’s grandpa felt his physical weakness dissipate significantly, and he felt invigorated.

In the end, the four returned home loaded with their harvest.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

As night deepened, Scholar Song finished his meditation and got up, moving to the window to gaze at the starry sky above.

Outside, everything was tranquil, with only a few houses still lit. This area was far from the city center, devoid of the usual hustle and bustle, and the quiet was quite soothing.

“I can’t sleep,” Scholar Song sighed, pulling out a scroll.

At the bottom of the scroll, there was a message from Venerable White: “Dear Scholar, I wish you a smooth journey during your trip to City J. I also hope you successfully find the materials for the Blood Qi Pill!”

As he contemplated his productive day, he suddenly recalled Venerable White’s well wishes.

Just like Venerable White said, this trip to City J had gone astonishingly smoothly.

It was almost as if everything he needed had fallen into his lap! Whenever he needed help, Three-Day Brother would appear out of nowhere to assist him with the vengeful spirits; when he needed techniques, Three-Day Brother provided him with body refining methods.

Moreover, as Venerable White had mentioned, he successfully acquired a substantial amount of materials for crafting the Blood Qi Pill.

Looking back, he couldn’t shake the feeling that his incredible luck today was somehow tied to Venerable White's blessings.

Could it be that Venerable White's fortune extended beyond himself? Could it influence others as well?

If this really was Venerable White’s blessing… then he needed to be cautious; after all, Venerable White's luck was of the ‘wealth and danger’ variety.

Now that the fortune had come—what danger lay ahead?

Could it be a natural disaster? Like a meteor crashing down and severely injuring him while he slept?

Or perhaps a manmade calamity? Such as being caught in the crossfire of a powerful cultivator battle?

The more he thought about it, the more something felt off.

He had an unsettling sense of impending danger drawing near!

As time passed, the feeling of crisis intensified, making it impossible for him to calm his mind.

If there was indeed a crisis... he couldn't let Tu Bo’s family get caught up in it!

Every cultivator must trust their instincts about danger—better to believe in it than dismiss it!

After contemplating for a moment, Scholar Song placed the car keys on the table.

He then tucked away the scroll.

Next, he equipped himself with his talismans, disposable flying sword, precious weapon, and Dou Dou’s dog hair.

He gently opened the window, activated the “Gentleman’s Journey” technique, and gracefully leaped out, disappearing into the night.

Landing lightly, he moved forward, making his way near the original base of the Guild Leader.

There, beneath a massive stone wall, lay a vast open space.

This location backed onto a cemetery, making it unlikely for anyone to come by at night.

If a meteor were to crash down, this spot would have the least impact on the village, and it was also a suitable place should a cultivator battle break out.

Lost in thought, the sense of crisis in his heart grew heavier.

Holding Dou Dou’s dog hair and a protective talisman in one hand and a sword talisman in the other, he remained vigilant, scanning his surroundings and the sky.

Up above… something was indeed hurtling rapidly toward him!

However, it wasn’t a meteor.

It was a gigantic wine-red gourd, radiating the glow of a magical artifact.

Looks like it was manmade calamity?

“Armor!” Scholar Song immediately activated the protective talisman, a faint golden light enveloping his entire body.

Simultaneously, without needing to activate it, Dou Dou’s dog hair appeared to have a mind of its own, floating from his hand and expanding. In the blink of an eye, it transformed into a powerful large Pekingese.

It resembled Dou Dou, though this larger version seemed somewhat weakened, likely a manifestation of Dou Dou’s split form.

“Woof!” The Pekingese, born from Dou Dou’s hair, leaped into action, swiping its paw at the giant gourd…
