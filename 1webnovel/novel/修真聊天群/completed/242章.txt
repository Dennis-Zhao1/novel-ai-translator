**This Speed is Off!**

“What’s wrong?” Mother Song noticed that Scholar Song's expression was off, so she leaned over to look out the window as well. What she saw made her heart sink—Old Lv and Father Song were climbing onto the tractor, while Lu Tianyou had a miserable look on his face as he climbed into the tractor's trailer with a heavy heart.

“Are these two guys drunk and causing a ruckus? They really need a good smack!” Mother Song exclaimed angrily as she pulled out her phone and dialed Father Song's number.

However, the ringing of Father Song's phone echoed from the dining table… After answering Scholar Song's call earlier, he had carelessly tossed his phone onto the table and forgotten to pick it up.

“……” Mother Song’s anger surged. She yelled at the three men downstairs, “Old Song, stop that tractor right now!”

But the sound of the tractor was quite loud, and Father Song, Old Lv, and Lu Tianyou didn’t hear her shouts.

The tractor roared to life and slowly accelerated.

Put-put-put... vroom vroom...

A plume of black smoke shot up as the tractor rumbled away from Scholar Song's home, disappearing into the distance.

Mother Song: “……”

Scholar Song: “……”

After a moment of contemplation, Mother Song said, “Scholar, go check the living room and see if Tianyou's car keys are there. The BMW downstairs is his—if the keys are there, hurry and drive after your dad!”

“It won’t catch up,” Scholar Song said with a bitter smile.

“What?” Mother Song asked, confused.

“My tractor… it’s got a speed that’s a bit out of the ordinary.” Scholar Song looked up at the sky—when it slightly accelerated, it could easily reach 100 mph, and it wouldn’t struggle to hit 150 mph. If he really pushed it, it could go even faster. How could he catch up?

……

……

“Wow, this tractor feels fantastic. It’s amazing!” Old Lv laughed heartily, bouncing up and down as the tractor jolted forward, clearly enjoying himself.

It had been ages since he last drove a hand-pulled tractor! The sensation brought him back to his youth.

Back in the day, he used to drive a tractor like this, especially in the cold winters when he’d drink a little to warm himself, driving his beloved tractor through the streets of Wenzhou City. He had just gotten married then, hustling for a living—though it was tough, he was so happy—if it weren’t for Father Song often poking at his sore spots, he would have remembered those times even more fondly.

He pressed the accelerator and expertly shifted up a gear.

The tractor picked up speed, and the black smoke billowed even more vigorously.

“Old Song, where are we headed next? I remember Baijing Road leads towards the mountains; it’s an old road, and there shouldn’t be anyone there. We won’t run into any traffic cops, right?” Old Lv asked Father Song.

After all, times had changed; back then, no one cared if you drove a tractor after drinking a bit.

But nowadays, getting caught drunk driving would be a big deal.

“Sure, just keep driving towards the mountains. But remember, avoid the main roads and take the back roads. There’s a privately funded road someone built up in the mountains for who knows what purpose. You can go mess around there.” Father Song sat in the tractor’s trailer, feeling an indescribable sense of oddness.

The speed of the tractor continued to climb, and the houses and trees beside them blurred past at an alarming rate.

“How fast are you going, Old Lv?” Father Song shouted over the noise of the tractor, his voice raised involuntarily.

“Not too fast yet; I haven’t hit the top gear. Don’t worry!” Old Lv was having the time of his life.

Lu Tianyou felt something was off—still not in top gear?

Something was definitely wrong!

Using his usual driving speed as a reference, Lu Tianyou estimated that the tractor was probably already nearing sixty mph. And it was still speeding up.

Is this a joke? A tractor going sixty and still not in top speed?

Could it be a modified tractor?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In Wenzhou City, not far from Baijing Road, there was a mountain called ‘Niu Ding Mountain.’ Here, a winding mountain road awaited.

Niu Ding Mountain is actually a collective term for several connected peaks, so you wouldn’t find this name on any map; it’s just what the locals call it.

Long ago, there was a winding road that connected the residents of Niu Ding Mountain to the outside world.

However, over time, the inhabitants moved down the mountain, and now only a few families remained. The road fell into disuse.

But two years ago, an anonymous wealthy individual managed to get approval and privately funded the reconstruction of the entire mountain road, making it quite spacious now.

……

……

At the moment, at the entrance of the mountain road, three sleek-looking sports cars—red, blue, and white—were parked.

“How’s this road? Isn’t it amazing?” A girl with a high ponytail and a youthful vibe jumped out of the white car, spreading her arms wide in a dramatic gesture, beaming with pride.

From the blue car, a long-legged girl with almond-shaped eyes stepped out, glanced at the mountain road, and smiled softly, “Xiao Mai Sui, you picked a good spot this time!”

Finally, from the red car, a fashionable woman in sunglasses poked her head out, honked the horn, and laughed, “Enough chit-chat! My car's itching to race; let’s have a competition!”

“Hehehe, I was waiting for you to say that, Arthur!” Xiao Mai Sui chuckled. “Watch me! This time, I’ll hit over 120 mph; you’ll see! I can push it to 130 mph on this stretch!”

120 mph? Wait, isn’t that a bit off? 120 mph? Is it really necessary to push that hard? Even on certain sections of the highway, you can easily reach that speed with a firm push on the accelerator, right?

“Haha, you’re not the only one secretly training! I’ve been practicing for a long time too. Even on mountain roads, I can maintain a speed of 100 mph. You two won’t stand a chance against me!” Arthur declared, her pride shining through.

A speed of 100 mph, and she was all haughty about it.

That’s right… these three girls were the type who loved racing but had little skill to back it up.

They loved racing, but usually, when others raced, they went too fast and ended up eating dust.

As much as they loved racing, they didn’t like being left in the dust and ridiculed.

So, the girl named Xiao Mai Sui figured out a way to get approval and invested money to build their own racing track in some remote places or abandoned mountain roads.

Then, she would gather her friends who also loved racing, albeit without much skill, to have fun together.

Not aiming for speed, just looking for enjoyment.

“Zhao Yaya, get in the car! Let’s race!” Xiao Mai Sui called out as she climbed into her white vehicle.

…That cheerful girl looking at the racetrack wasn’t anyone else but Zhao Yaya, the daughter of Scholar Song’s uncle.

“I didn’t expect Xiao Mai Sui to choose Wenzhou City’s Baijing Road this time. It’s so close to Scholar Song’s home! After the race, let’s go visit him and see if he’s back yet,” Zhao Yaya thought to herself.

Yes, Zhao Yaya loved racing… and she kept her interest hidden so well that no one in her family knew about it!

Then, the three girls hopped into their cars.

“I’ll count to three; we’ll take off in three seconds!” Xiao Mai Sui said proudly.

After all, this wasn’t a formal race; the three sisters were just messing around, so the rules didn’t matter.

“Three, two, one!” Xiao Mai Sui shouted, hitting the car horn hard, and the three sleek sports cars shot off down the track.

Initially, the three girls were racing with style, and their straight-line speeds were impressive.

But whenever they approached a curve, they all slammed on the brakes simultaneously, slowing down…

Their instructor had repeatedly warned them to slow down when turning!

Well, driving is all about safety, right?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

“Yo yo, check it out!” Old Lv was driving the tractor, having a blast, humming an old song as he navigated the small road toward the mountains behind Baijing Road…

Father Song in the trailer furrowed his brow slightly. “I have a feeling this speed is really off. Didn’t we just pass by several sedans?”

“Don’t overthink it; maybe those sedans were just slow, and we passed them. Still, it feels great to overtake cars with a tractor,” Old Lv laughed heartily.

[No way, Dad, this speed is definitely off.] Lu Tianyou thought to himself. At the same time, he raked his fingers through his hair—he was also puzzled why there wasn’t any wind?

The tractor didn’t have a windshield; logically, even if it wasn’t going fast, there should be some wind rushing at him while driving.

Yet, he had been sitting in the trailer for a while now, and not a single breeze touched him.

“Hahaha, Old Song, we’ve arrived at the place you mentioned. Wow, what a great spot! The road is so wide, and it looks deserted. If this were a nice car, it would be so fun to race here. But for now, let me show you the style of driving a tractor like I did twenty years ago!” Old Lv said proudly.

With that, he pushed the tractor into top gear!

Put-put-put... vroom vroom... the tractor roared as it charged into the mountain road.

At the same time, the speed of the tractor seemed to surge even further.

Father Song worriedly said, “Be careful; this is a mountain road with many curves!”

Old Lv laughed heartily, “Curves? Please! I was the master who drove a tractor at top speed through eighteen bends in the mountain road. Watch me take a turn beautifully.” 

Old Lv leaned in, gripping the tractor’s steering wheel, and began to tilt the vehicle gently as it sped along...
