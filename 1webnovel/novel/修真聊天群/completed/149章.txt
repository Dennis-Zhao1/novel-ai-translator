**The Blind Eye Series!**

The next day, June 30th, Sunday.

At 5:30 AM, Scholar Song got out of bed and practiced the *Fundamental Diamond Fist Technique* twenty times. After that, he concentrated the accumulated vitality into his second chakra, the 'Eye Chakra.'

Without any Qi Blood Pills, he couldn't afford to waste even a single opportunity for cultivation!

At 6:40 AM, while enjoying breakfast, Scholar Song received a call about a parcel.

“Hello, is this Scholar Song from Class 43 of the Mechanical Design and Manufacturing Institute, Year 19? Your urgent delivery has arrived; please sign for it.” This time was rare; it wasn’t a package from Sima Jiang.

After all, Fengshou Express hadn’t reached the level where they could handle all national deliveries.

“Okay, I’ll come down to sign for it right away,” Scholar Song replied.

It should be the magical item that Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain mentioned yesterday—the one that could communicate with Venerable White over long distances, right?

Honestly, did the seniors in the Ninefold Land group have so much faith when sending items? Whether it was 'flying swords,' refining materials, magical artifacts, or even 'people,' they seemed to trust the delivery system completely.

But then again, they weren't worried about losing their packages, so of course, they felt at ease.

After signing for the parcel, Scholar Song unwrapped the small package. Inside was a palm-sized, emerald-green bamboo flute. It felt cool to the touch, and although it was made of bamboo, it had the texture of jade.

Included in the package was a user manual—its instructions were simple. As long as one blew into the small bamboo flute within a certain range, they could connect with Venerable White and communicate with him.

The stronger the spiritual power of the person blowing the flute, the greater the range of communication with Venerable White. Considering the distance between Venerable White and Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, they could communicate across the entire Middle Land. However, for Scholar Song, being able to connect within the limits of a small village would be a good start.

That’s why Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain advised Scholar Song to head to Linyao Village in Nanhua Lake City, use the 'Thousand-Mile Transmission' artifact to contact Venerable White, and confirm his whereabouts to pick him up from his seclusion.

At the end of the user manual, there was a line: "Little friend Scholar Song, I’ve prepared a total of thirty-six new vehicles in various styles for you, and they are currently being registered and plated. They will be delivered to an underground garage in Jiangnan University City soon. The journey to Nanhua Lake City is over five hundred kilometers. If you don’t mind, feel free to use 'Little Doudou'—don’t let it sit idle. Lastly, I wish you good health.”

Thirty-six new vehicles? Did he really need that many new cars to entertain 'Venerable White'?

Venerable, did you at least get me personal insurance?

After sighing, Scholar Song returned to his dorm.

His roommates were all semi-commuters and had returned home for the weekend.

So, Little Pekingese Doudou was left to roam free.

It was munching on beef-flavored dog food while playing a game Scholar Song had never seen before—probably one it had downloaded in the past few days.

The game was minimized, and there was a chat window open—inside, a beautiful girl around seventeen or eighteen years old was video chatting with Doudou!

“Hubby, you’re amazing! This dungeon boss requires our guild to form an elite team of seven to defeat, and we can only choose 'Normal' difficulty! Yet, the two of us managed to breeze through 'Elite' difficulty!” The pretty girl exclaimed, her voice soft and melodious.

Little Pekingese Doudou chewed on a piece of dog food, wearing an expression of a lonely master, and then typed in the chat box, “No big deal, this level can’t stop your hubby—your hubby is a great master!”

“Absolutely a super master! I love you so much, hubby, muah!” The pretty girl replied sweetly, even sending a kiss emoji.

Doudou smiled proudly and typed quickly, “Your little mouth is so sweet. Let’s open this boss treasure chest and see what we get. Once your hubby reaches level eighty and gathers the five-star War God set, we’ll go crush those bastards who dare to camp out by the corpse of your wife. Just watch me bring them back to the novice village!”

“Hubby, you’re so domineering!” The girl’s eyes sparkled with admiration as she asked, “When will your camera be fixed? I really want to see what you look like and hear your voice!”

“Don’t worry; I’ll buy the camera tomorrow. I’ll tell you, your hubby is super handsome,” Doudou typed back. Meanwhile, it rummaged through Scholar Song's computer and found an old photo of him.

It was a picture from high school when Scholar Song was often exercising—youthful and vibrant, he was quite the handsome young man.

“Here, take a look at your hubby’s photo! But this was taken a while ago; I’ve matured and become even more handsome!” Doudou sent the photo to the girl.

When she received the photo, the girl thought the guy in the picture was indeed somewhat good-looking.

In fact, as long as the guy she imagined as her 'hubby' in the game wasn’t too ugly, she could accept him. Now that she saw the photo, he was way better than she had imagined. So, she happily exclaimed, “Hubby is awesome—love you the most!”

“Wow, I love your sweet little mouth. If you call me darling in that adorable tone, I’ll take you on an 'Nightmare' level dungeon next!” Doudou teased, its excitement evident as it seemed to enjoy flirting with the human girl.

“Darling, oh, that’s so embarrassing!” The girl playfully stuck out her tongue.

“Oh ho ho, my bones are melting! Let’s go, let’s conquer this nightmare dungeon! Watch your hubby unleash his skills and clear it effortlessly!” Doudou bounced around excitedly on the computer desk.

This Pekingese demon dog was hopeless!

……

……

Scholar Song stood behind Little Pekingese Doudou, watching this 'blind titanium alloy dog eye' scene unfold. His feelings at this moment could only be described as “I’m done for.”

It was one thing for Little Pekingese Doudou to play games and chat, but it was another to be flirting online!

What’s even crazier was that it had caught the attention of a pretty girl!

How are all the single men in Middle Land supposed to cope with this?

And this cute girl—if she ever found out that the 'hubby' she called was actually a Pekingese dog—no way, I can’t even imagine that scene!

Scholar Song felt utterly defeated.

“Hey, Scholar Song, you’re back!” Little Pekingese Doudou greeted him calmly, as if it hadn’t just carelessly sent Scholar Song’s photo to a girl.

Scholar Song took a deep breath. “Are you really okay with sending my photo to that girl like that?”

“Of course, it’s no problem! I even planned to let you video chat with her tomorrow noon. Just a quick chat, a few smiles will do. With your creamy young student looks, just a slight smile will be enchanting! I guarantee you’ll mesmerize her!” Doudou said confidently.

“I refuse; lying is wrong,” Scholar Song replied.

“Haha, then I’ll just tell her your class and student ID so she can come to Jiangnan University City to find you directly,” Doudou said smugly.

“……” Scholar Song’s mind was suddenly filled with menus like ‘Dog Meat Hot Pot’ and ‘Braised Dog Ribs.’

“Don’t worry; I won’t let you help me for free. I’ll also agree to help you with a few things in return. I, Doudou, don’t like being indebted!” Doudou insisted. “Besides, don’t you think it’s cruel for that girl to find out her crush is a Pekingese dog? At this point, telling a beautiful lie will let her continue living in a sweet dream, and we can be a loving couple in the game. That’s a good deed!”

So you know you’re a dog, huh? Scholar Song rolled his eyes internally!

“Hehe, enough of this, watch how I clear this nightmare dungeon!” Little Pekingese Doudou’s paws flew over the keyboard, and its character in the game dashed alongside the girl’s character, cutting down enemies with ease.

Scholar Song sighed inwardly. “By the way, Doudou, can you accompany me to Linyao Village in Nanhua Lake City this afternoon?”

“Oh? You’re going to pick up Venerable White, right? But I’m busy; I need to help my wife clear some dungeons,” Doudou refused without hesitation.

“Hmm, I think you shouldn’t refuse me. Otherwise… heh heh,” Scholar Song smiled calmly.

“Woof, are you threatening me?” Doudou turned around, looking displeased.

“Yep, I’m threatening you,” Scholar Song nodded, honestly.

“Damn it, fine! After I finish this dungeon, I’ll tell my wife and then accompany you to Linyao Village in Nanhua Lake City,” Doudou sighed. “I’ll take you there, but you have to help me show my face in front of that girl tomorrow and chat with her for a bit.”

“Alright,” Scholar Song agreed.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Two hours later.

Doudou finally finished explaining things to its in-game wife, then it went to the balcony and transformed into a five-meter-long giant Pekingese.

“Come on, hop on, I’ll take you there. It’s faster this way,” Doudou said begrudgingly.

“Okay.” Scholar Song climbed onto Doudou's back. “Do you know the location?”

“I’ve nearly scouted all of Middle Land; there’s no place I don’t know,” Doudou replied. After finishing, it let out a sharp whistle, and mist enveloped Scholar Song, concealing him. As a demon beast, it wouldn’t be seen by ordinary people. If Scholar Song’s human body wasn’t covered, he’d be making the headlines tomorrow.

Moreover, the mist would protect Scholar Song from high-altitude wind pressure and cold currents.

“Hold on tight.” Doudou leaped gently, soaring into the sky. It ran through the air, its speed nearly rivaling that of Su Clan’s Aqi flying on his sword.

After a short distance, four fire wheels appeared beneath Doudou's feet, doubling its flying speed.

In less than half an hour, Doudou covered the five hundred kilometers and landed in Linyao Village, Nanhua Lake City.

“Do you know where Venerable White is in seclusion?” Doudou asked, returning to its small Pekingese form.

Scholar Song took out the green flute. “Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain gave me this; I just need to blow it to contact Venerable White.”

He held the green flute to his lips and blew with all his might.

‘Buzz—’ A sound emanated from the green flute, but it wasn’t a sound wave that human ears could hear.

The sound waves spread out far and soon reached a specific spot in Linyao Village.

Moments later, a similar sound wave spread from a location in Linyao Village, connecting with the green flute in Scholar Song’s hand.
