**Keep Quiet, There’s a Wild Uncle Ahead!**

From the fragment of conversation with the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, Scholar Song could only gather that Venerable White was quite the charmer, male, and had yet to receive further details about the other Immortals. 

But why would the generous, well-respected Venerable White, known for mentoring juniors, instill such fear in the older generation? 

Could it be something dangerous? Scholar Song found himself feeling a twinge of worry.

“Forget it. There's no use in overthinking. I'll cross that bridge when I get to it!” He shut his laptop and climbed into bed, ready for sleep.

He drifted off without a single dream, waking only with the morning light.

No nightmarish dreams this time—seemed like the forum owner was truly gone for good.

The next day, June 9th, clear skies.

It marked the last day of the sports meet, the final day of the college entrance examination.

Once this day was over, the beleaguered test-takers would be released from their hellish ordeal, only to enter another one dubbed ‘waiting for results,’ where they would continue to face their unique tortures.

“Scholar, let’s go sign up!” Early in the morning, Tu Bo burst into their dorm room, calling out to Scholar Song.

Right, they had agreed yesterday to register for a driving license today…

In the Jiangnan University Town, there was a local vehicle administration office dedicated to helping students learn to drive.

The morning crowd was thin, so Scholar Song and Tu Bo joined the queue at the front desk, eventually filling out forms and registering with a kind young woman at the counter.

Next came the vision and hearing tests, a physical examination; followed by a few passport-size photos, after which they returned to the counter to pay and collect their materials.

The cheerful attendant explained, “Tomorrow, which is Monday, we have two theoretical classes on vehicle operation at 8 AM and 1 PM. After attending these classes, you can sign up for the Theory Test for Subject One anytime. But be cautious—there are only two chances for this exam. If you fail, you’ll need to register and pay again. So, it’s best not to waste your attempts.”

“Thank you,” Scholar Song replied with a shy smile.

In the last two years, the process for such things in Middle Land had been simplified significantly.

Apparently, five or six years ago, if someone wanted to learn to drive, they had to wait ten days to half a month just to attend the theoretical classes after signing up. After completing those, they faced another long wait for the theoretical exam… Just thinking about how much time those predecessors wasted on waiting made him feel a pang of sympathy for them.

Now it was straightforward. As long as you felt confident after the theoretical course, you could take the exam right away. If you failed, just sign up again until you passed.

Once the Theory Test was passed, you could jump right into practical training.

If luck was on their side, they could get their licenses within a couple of months.

“Are you confident about the theory test, Scholar?” Tu Bo asked, already well-versed in the traffic rules and key points.

“I’m good to go! Just waiting to finish the theory class so I can sign up for Subject One’s test right after!” Scholar Song replied.

He had memorized all the theory knowledge and key points from the books he borrowed from the bookstore recently.

“Great! Once we pass the theory exam, we can sign up for practical driving lessons right away. Let’s aim to get our licenses as fast as we can!” Tu Bo rubbed his hands together. “I’ll check which driving instructor at school is the best by then, and we’ll go with that instructor.”

“Aren’t the instructors assigned randomly?” Scholar Song inquired.

“Of course it’s ‘randomly’ assigned! Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it.” Tu Bo chuckled.

“Sounds good,” Scholar Song replied.

Hmm… Once he had his car license, maybe he should consider getting a pilot’s license too? Mastering the art of flying on a sword was still a distant dream for him; for now, flying in the skies could only be accomplished by an airplane!

No rush, no rush. One step at a time; let’s get the car license first.

At that moment, Tu Bo casually asked, “Scholar, I’m thinking of heading to Luoxin District to browse around and grab some snacks. Want to join?”

Scholar Song contemplated. Aside from his cultivation practice, he had nothing pressing today, and shopping wouldn’t take long.

“Sure, I could use a few snacks too,” he smiled.

Luoxin District was the food street, and it was also one of the places where his fate had taken a turn for the better!

If it weren’t for Luoxin District, he wouldn’t have met Fay Yu, nor would he have received those two boxes of body refining liquid materials. Without those, he would never have had the opportunity to step into the world of cultivators!

Scholar Song felt that Luoxin District was indeed his lucky place.

**Food Street.**

After wandering around for a while, Tu Bo had already filled his arms with bags of goodies. It seemed he was preparing to hibernate for a few days, perhaps to binge on some new game?

Scholar Song picked up a few snacks here and there, munching as he walked.

Just then, his gaze snapped to a familiar figure in the distance.

Ah, fate, how I see you every day!

He spotted a man in a suit, a busy office worker, darting through the street. After a short distance, he sneakily hid in a corner, curling up like something was amiss.

How should he put it? The world is vast—approximately 8 billion people roamed it by 2018. A theater of five thousand could feel packed, but when 8 billion gathered, it would truly be a sea of humanity!

Yet, the world is also small. Thanks to a thread called ‘fate,’ two different individuals could continuously run into each other among that vast population.

Scholar Song had encountered this uncle almost every day lately.

Whether in alleys, subway stations, hospitals, or even now at the food street, it seemed they were destined to cross paths.

For a moment, Scholar Song wondered if there were many clones or splinters of this ‘uncle’ scattered around Jiangnan University Town, which explained why he kept running into him!

Well, regardless, fate is fate!

If he bumped into him today, he couldn’t let him slip away easily!

Scholar Song began loosening up, stretching his shoulders and legs!

Tu Bo looked at him quizzically and asked, “Scholar, what are you doing?”

“Ha-ha, don’t mind me. I’m just going to greet an acquaintance!” Scholar Song gritted his teeth.

“Hmm? I’ll pop into this shop to grab something. Once you’re done, come find me,” Tu Bo shrugged and headed into a nearby store.

Scholar Song grinned, crouched down, and assumed the starting position for a sprint—Uncle, here I come!

---

“Little one from the Su Family, let’s see how you escape my grasp this time!” the uncle muttered coldly.

He had been frustrated for a long time after losing track of the ‘Su Family junior’ last time, but today, he had finally found him again! The uncle was determined to follow his target discreetly and catch him in an isolated spot.

At that moment, an unsettling feeling washed over him. The keen sixth sense of a cultivator alerted him that trouble was approaching.

His sharp gaze scanned the area, quickly locking onto the source of his unease—there, not far away, a young man was sprinting toward him at full speed!

It was him!

That troublesome scammer!

This guy had clung to him for so long, refusing to let go! The last time, he lost track of the Su Family junior because of this scammer, and now he was back to stir up trouble again?!

But this time, I won’t avoid it.

The uncle’s eyes hardened; it was time to settle things!

---

As their eyes met, Scholar Song knew he had been spotted.

Well then, let’s make this clear!

Scholar Song clenched his fists, controlling his strength, preparing to land a punch that would knock the uncle down. He would subdue him and have a good ‘chat’ about basic trust between people!

Scholar Song ran fast, closing the distance to the uncle in no time.

“Uncle!” he grinned, right hand poised to strike!

Just then…

Boom!

Scholar Song felt a flash of darkness in his left eye as a fist slammed into his eye socket… and a wave of dizziness followed!
