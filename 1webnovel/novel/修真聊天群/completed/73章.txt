**Trouble Has Finally Arrived!**

As night fell over the dormitory, Scholar Song had climbed into bed early to rest. 

Meanwhile, his dorm mates—Tu Bo, Li Yangde, and a guy named Gao—were engrossed in a classic camp-based battle game. 

These three had no shame when it came to gaming. While playing as a team, they even used Scholar Song's computer to create an account that belonged to the enemy faction. They were having a blast running a black market, bullying unsuspecting players. 

Scholar Song shook his head in disdain and pulled out his phone to check the Ninefold Land group chat. To his surprise, it was unusually quiet tonight; even the Hermit of North River hadn’t chimed in.

Cultivators were usually busy, except for the Hermit, of course.

“By the way, Scholar, I found the herbal medicine information you asked for. Out of all the registered traditional Chinese medicine shops in the Jiangnan region, only one has the herbs you need, and they only sell one of the types. I also posted on forums and similar sites, so I should have more news for you by tomorrow. I’ll send you all the shop addresses at once,” Li Yangde said, all the while shamelessly minimizing the game window to open his own little cheat program.

Could they be any more shameless while running a black market?

Scholar Song chuckled, “Thanks for your hard work, Comrade Yangde!”

“Go to hell,” Li Yangde shot back angrily.

Before long, the game ended, and the trio—who had stooped to cheating—managed to lose!

“Damn it, they were cheating too!” Tu Bo shouted in frustration.

This battle game was quite old; Scholar Song remembered playing it back in elementary school. Those who still chose to play were seasoned veterans, each with impressive skills and shameless tactics that knew no bounds.

“Man, we can’t keep playing like this. Let’s switch servers. Why are there so many shameless cheaters these days?” Gao complained.

Oh, so you care about shamelessness now?

Scholar Song, sprawled on his bed watching his roommates switch to another server to continue cheating, asked, “By the way, Tu Bo, do you still have that electric baton you modified last semester?”

“Of course! I’ve tweaked it a few more times since then; its power is seriously impressive now.” Tu Bo lit up at the mention of modifications.

He had always loved tinkering with things, from motorcycles to laser pointers—he’d tried his hand at it all.

Scholar Song asked, “Can I borrow it in a few days? Also, can you make it even more powerful? The bigger, the better.”

“The power can only go so high; after all, it’s a civilian product. What’s the deal? Did someone mess with you? You planning to give them a jolt of a hundred thousand volts?” Tu Bo questioned, puzzled.

“Yeah, and they really messed with me. I’m thinking of throwing them to the East Sea,” Scholar Song replied with a grin. “I might be going on an adventure with my sister to the deep mountains soon; I heard it’s like a tropical rainforest, so it feels safer to have something for self-defense.”

Aside from dealing with Zhao Yaya, Scholar Song usually didn’t blush when he lied.

Hearing this, Tu Bo’s eyes lit up—because he knew that Zhao Yaya had zero interest in going on wild adventures.

So, could this sister Scholar Song was talking about be that long-legged sister he met last time?

Tu Bo immediately pictured Fay Yu, who had that adventurous vibe. Last time, she had dragged Scholar Song all the way to J City to find some ghost temple.

He promptly stopped playing and turned to ask, “Is it the sister from J City?”

“That’s her,” Scholar Song confirmed—after telling one lie, one often needed to weave more to support the first.

“Scholar, take me along on this jungle adventure! And if you don’t mind, from today on, you can call me brother-in-law; I’d be totally cool with that!” Tu Bo said earnestly.

Just then, his game character was ambushed and killed.

Gao wailed, “You’re dead, Bo! You died a horrible death!”

Li Yangde adjusted his glasses, adding salt to the wound, “Bo, I just started recording. Although from your tone, the sister you mentioned shouldn’t be Zhao Yaya, sending your words to her would still have a devastating effect.”

“Well then,” Scholar Song grinned.

“Time to treat us, Bo!” Li Yangde and Gao chimed in unison, nudging their glasses back up.

Selling out teammates was Li Yangde’s specialty, both in-game and in real life.

“Are you guys even human?!” Tu Bo put his face in his hands. “How did I end up knowing two jerks like you?”

Just then, Scholar Song’s phone rang.

He pulled it out and saw it was Zhao Yaya calling.

“It’s Zhao Yaya,” Scholar Song grinned. “Tu Bo, should I call you brother-in-law now? Do you dare respond?”

Tu Bo felt a phantom pain and his eyes teared up. “Please spare me!”

Scholar Song answered the call with a smile, “Sister, did you call me this late for something?”

“Is it a crime to call you if there’s nothing wrong?” Zhao Yaya’s breathless voice came through. “I need a favor. I’m at the old Liu Ma Street by Jiangnan University. You know the back entrance of the Sha Sha Wedding Photo Studio, right?”

Scholar Song frowned slightly but quickly composed himself. “Got it. Do you need me to bring anything?”

“Nope, just help me carry someone. Hurry!” Zhao Yaya replied.

“On my way.” Scholar Song hung up, quickly throwing on a black long-sleeve shirt.

He rummaged under his bed for a moment before standing up and asking, “Do you guys need anything while I’m out?”

Tu Bo called out, “Bring back some late-night snacks!”

“Get a large ice-cold cola too!”

“Okay!” Scholar Song waved as he grabbed his wallet and swiftly disappeared into the night.

……

Once outside the dorm, Scholar Song’s expression darkened immediately.

That call was from Zhao Yaya, and while the voice sounded similar at first, it definitely wasn’t her voice.

Scholar Song was far too familiar with Zhao Yaya’s voice, including her speech habits, pace, and even some quirks she didn’t notice herself.

But the voice from the phone was slightly rougher, and the tone shifted differently at the end of each sentence. If you listened closely, you could even hear a hoarse, dry rasp.

Not Zhao Yaya, but using her phone and voice to lure him out… Would you believe someone who claimed they meant no harm?

Was it a companion of that ‘assassin’ who, after failing to take him out, decided to go after those around him?

These damned guys… have finally come!

Scholar Song hurried to Old Liu Ma Street.

He didn’t go straight to the Sha Sha Wedding Photo Studio. Instead, he climbed to the seventh-floor corridor of the Guoxin Building, about two hundred meters away.

From here, he had a bird’s-eye view of the wedding photo studio. Scholar Song activated his mental energy, using the ‘Alert’ mental technique to heighten his senses and conceal his presence.

Ever since he began practicing the Foundation Establishment Fist to temper his body, his eyesight was as sharp as a telescope. Even in the dark, things two hundred meters away appeared as clear as a high-definition film.

Old Liu Ma Street used to be a bustling pedestrian street, but with the establishment of New Liu Ma Street, the old area had lost its former glory. Now, as night descended, only a handful of shops remained open, and foot traffic was scarce.

The Sha Sha Wedding Photo Studio was located in the southeast of Old Liu Ma Street. Besides the street lights, the only illumination came from the studio itself, casting a dim glow in the deserted area.

Scholar Song quickly spotted Zhao Yaya, who was positioned between the wedding photo studio and a patch of greenery.

Under the cover of the lush greenery, she sat slumped against a stone bench by the roadside, her eyes tightly closed, seemingly in a deep sleep or unconscious state.

Standing beside her was a tall, lanky man.

The man was about 1.83 meters tall and noticeably thin. His arms were long, significantly longer than those of an average person. He wore large sunglasses that obscured most of his face, and his lips were thick and swollen, resembling overcooked sausages.

He was fiddling with a woman’s smartphone in his hands.
