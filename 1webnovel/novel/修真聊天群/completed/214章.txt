**Champion of the Sword Flight Tournament!**

Flying a plane and wielding a flying sword are two very different experiences.

Flying swords are convenient and quick. All you need is a flying sword, a finger gesture to channel its energy, and you can create a shimmering light around it. Then just step on and fly however you want!

You can fly sideways, vertically, upside down, or in reverse—nothing's off-limits. Plus, no matter how fierce the wind blows, whether it rains or snows, or even if lightning strikes, it won’t affect the flight of a flying sword.

But planes, on the other hand...

Planes are heavily impacted by various external factors. Apart from those, there are also rules humans have set that constrain the freedom of flying a plane.

Scholar Song and Venerable White sat in the classroom, listening to the instructor explain some basic knowledge about flying airplanes.

They covered topics like takeoff and landing data calculations, load balancing calculations, basic weather information acquisition and analysis, aviation regulations, airspace analysis related to training zones and airports, and various airport signal lights...

And a lot more foundational knowledge.

This is the kind of content that ordinary people would take days to learn, but the instructor condensed it all into a quick-paced lecture for Scholar Song and Venerable White.

After over an hour...

Once the instructor finished, he took a sip of water and said, “That’s basically the theoretical knowledge we covered.”

Honestly, after cramming so much information into just over an hour, even he felt a bit dizzy. He didn’t believe that Scholar Song and Venerable White could grasp all this knowledge.

Well... it’s all just a formality. These two have already got their pilot licenses in hand.

“Hmm, it sounds quite simple, but there are just so many restrictions,” Venerable White said as he put away several theoretical books, nodding in agreement.

“Restrictions are unavoidable. With so many planes in the air, if there’s no management, accidents are bound to happen. And once an accident occurs, it’s usually life-threatening. However, the theoretical part is pretty simple; just memorize the regulations,” Scholar Song replied with a smile.

“That's true,” Venerable White nodded.

Hearing their conversation, the instructor couldn’t help but sip his tea and smirk. Damn it, these two are still trying to act cool!

The key points he covered in just over an hour left him feeling dizzy; it’s a miracle if those two could actually understand anything!

...

...

The subsequent process was streamlined since Scholar Song and Venerable White were not there to get a license but to learn how to take a plane up for a spin. As a result, all the tedious procedures were omitted.

Under Kaith’s arrangement, Scholar Song and Venerable White received one-on-one guidance from a flight instructor, first mastering some basic instrument operations, flight charts, and radar usage in a simulator.

Next, they climbed aboard the flight school’s helicopter, guided by a brave instructor who was willing to take risks for a handsome reward.

Scholar Song flew first, with Venerable White sitting in the back to observe and learn.

As the helicopter took off, Scholar Song’s heart raced. Flying a plane was nothing like driving a car; one slip-up could lead to disaster!

The flight instructor, sitting beside him, started off with nothing much to say. As long as they didn’t exceed the altitude limit of a thousand meters, everything else was fair game. In truth, he was just as nervous, knowing that these two were wealthy thrill-seekers. They were about to fly a plane today after just learning about it. If he weren’t in desperate need of money, there was no way he’d risk his life with them!

However, once the helicopter took off, the instructor was pleasantly surprised. Although Scholar Song appeared stiff and clearly a novice with helicopters, he surprisingly managed to execute the entire operation without any mistakes. He was cautious but handled everything smoothly.

After flying a loop in the air, the instructor found no errors in Scholar Song’s operations.

Could this guy have already learned how to fly? Is he just messing with me? The instructor secretly glanced at Scholar Song, wondering if he was like a race car driver attending a basic driving course.

It made sense, though. No matter how rich and reckless someone is, they wouldn’t joke with their own life.

Perhaps this young man named Song had flown other types of planes before, and he was just here to learn a few more private flying techniques?

With that thought, the instructor felt a lot more at ease. If that were the case, he and Old Liu were about to make a fortune!

Old Liu was the other brave instructor willing to take risks for money.

After they circled in the air, the instructor instructed Scholar Song to prepare for landing.

Scholar Song carefully maneuvered the helicopter down towards the airport—while it was more inconvenient than a flying sword, the safety it provided was undeniably comforting!

Scholar Song realized he really enjoyed this feeling... it was awesome!

Once the helicopter landed smoothly, the flight instructor jumped out and ran to another equally brave instructor, saying, “Old Liu, I just finished my run. In a bit, I’ll take another student up, then let the two learners try out the business jet with you. Are you ready?”

He quietly approached Old Liu and said, “Old Liu, let me tell you, these two students might have experience with other aircraft and aren’t total rookies. They handled everything quite skillfully. This run is really worth the money!”

“Oh, oh...” Old Liu replied absently, as if lost in thought.

“What’s wrong with you, Old Liu?” the helicopter instructor asked, puzzled.

“Oh? Little Li, I’m fine. Just fine,” Old Liu came back to reality, tears streaming down his face.

He had been providing one-on-one guidance to Venerable White in the simulator, and spending too much time with him had led him to question his own life choices.

“Old Liu, don’t zone out again; it’s dangerous! I’ll take another student up, so get yourself together,” Little Li advised before turning back to prepare to take Venerable White up for a flight.

...

...

Just then, when Little Li turned back to the helicopter, he suddenly saw Scholar Song putting on a thick, cumbersome spacesuit!

What the heck is he doing?

I’m teaching a helicopter, not a spacecraft; he can’t just jump into space! What’s with the spacesuit in this hot weather? Did he lose his mind?

Scholar Song noticed Little Li’s gaze and chuckled awkwardly, “Uh, haha, instructor, don’t mind me. I’ve just always wanted to experience being an astronaut, and I couldn’t hold back. Just ignore me.”

But as Little Li looked at Scholar Song in that suit, he felt an unease in his chest.

Meanwhile, Venerable White looked curiously at the spacesuit, clearly interested and thinking, ‘I want to try that on too.’

“The plane has been checked and is good to go. We can take off,” said the technician responsible for the pre-flight check.

Eagerly, Venerable White hopped into the helicopter.

Despite Scholar Song’s bulky suit, he still managed to squeeze into the back seat, filling it to the brim.

“Ha ha ha.” Scholar Song laughed awkwardly. Good thing he had the soul-sealing ice bead; otherwise, he’d be roasting in this heat.

“...” Little Li stared at Scholar Song for a long moment, and as he climbed onto the helicopter, his heart started racing again. “Let’s take off, following the process I showed Scholar Song. Remember, we can’t exceed a thousand meters in altitude.”

“Got it.” Venerable White said.

Compared to Scholar Song, Venerable White was much steadier—though he hadn’t flown a plane before, he had been soaring through the skies for countless years, so he was quite adept.

Thus, when Venerable White piloted the helicopter, he didn’t appear inexperienced at all; he flew like an old pro who had been flying for decades, handling everything with ease.

Little Li glanced at Venerable White, feeling confident. Wow, this is really worth the money! I’d bet ten bucks that this ‘Song Bai’ is definitely an experienced pilot, not a newbie!

The flight school had spent big bucks to have him and Old Liu look after these two, also providing them with hefty insurance. Initially, he thought he would be risking his life to complete the task, but it turned out to be a hundred times easier than guiding ordinary students.

If this kind of task is called a ‘dangerous mission,’ then let the ‘dangerous missions’ come even stronger; he’d be all in.

Of course, what made Little Li uneasy was the massive lump in the spacesuit behind him—Scholar Song.

No matter how he looked at it, it felt off.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In the world of cultivators, they have always been hidden within the real world, yet they haven’t been isolated; they’ve kept pace with the times.

While ordinary humans have the Olympics, Asian Games, and other large-scale sporting events, the cultivator community has its own competitions.

For instance, there’s a well-known flying sword tournament held every ten years in various locations around the world.

As the name implies, the flying sword competition tests speed and skill! Contestants must navigate various traps, obstacles, and formations, with the fastest to reach the finish line declared the winner.

Depending on the cultivators' ranks, there are three levels of competitions—fourth-grade ‘Sword Control Tournament,’ fifth-grade ‘Flying Sword Tournament,’ and sixth-grade ‘Sword Escape Tournament.’

As for seventh-grade spiritual lords and above... they are figures of great prominence, not only scarce in number but also in deep meditation for hundreds of years, hence they can’t participate in such flying sword tournaments.

The ‘Gale Sword’ Yang Yuxiang from the Falling Moon Sword Sect is also somewhat well-known in the cultivator community.

He is a three-time champion of the fourth-grade Sword Control Tournament! In terms of speed, his flying sword has already surpassed many ordinary fifth-grade spiritual kings!

The Gale Sword Yang Yuxiang has dominated the ‘Sword Control Tournament’ for three consecutive sessions, aiming to secure another victory in the fourth-grade contest before advancing to the fifth-grade spiritual king, achieving a four-time championship!

To achieve this goal, he has been diligently practicing the flying sword escape technique.

Three days ago, the ‘Gale Sword’ Yang Yuxiang flew from the eastern part of Huaxia all the way to the westernmost region and then returned along the same route. During the journey, he was on the lookout for various airfields and military bases.

As for why he was searching for airports and air force bases, it’s because he has a great hobby—speed racing with flying swords.

He enjoys racing against various types of aircraft.

Each time he flies alongside a plane, then pushes himself to overtake it, that psychological thrill is his ultimate enjoyment.

After all, mortals can’t see him, so he has a lot of fun with it.

Today, he found another flying base.

“Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center? Oh, so it’s not an air force base. If it’s students flying, they’ll be slow... Ah, whatever, a mosquito is still meat. I didn’t see a single plane on the way here,” Gale Sword Yang Yuxiang sighed.

He hovered above the airfield for a while before finally spotting a helicopter slowly taking off.

“Finally, is it here?” Gale Sword Yang Yuxiang laughed, but regrettably, it was just this private model helicopter, which wouldn’t be fast enough for his liking; he could only settle for a bit of fun.

Once the helicopter took off and completed its initial acceleration, Gale Sword Yang Yuxiang summoned his flying sword, zipping over to fly alongside the helicopter, maintaining parallel flight for a bit.

This was his habit—first, he would fly alongside the plane for a while, then with a burst of speed, he would outpace it, leaving it far behind until it disappeared from view.

The thrill of that moment is simply indescribable.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

“Hmm?” Scholar Song, sitting in the back of the helicopter, turned his head to look out the window when he suddenly spotted a figure in the sky.

A human figure in the air?

Oh no, could it be a cultivator flying on a sword?

Now that Scholar Song had opened his senses, he could see many things that ordinary people couldn’t, like ghosts, monsters, and cultivators flying on swords.

However, such things were rarely seen in the city; aside from the occasional Bean Bean at home, Scholar Song hadn’t encountered another beast.

Cultivators flying on swords were also quite rare... normally, they flew at such high altitudes that they were invisible to the naked eye.

Today was a rare occasion where he saw a senior cultivator flying alongside a plane.

As Scholar Song pondered, the cultivator flying alongside the helicopter suddenly made a funny face at the people inside!

Then, right before his eyes, the cultivator struck a ‘ready to run’ pose in the air, bending over with his rear end sticking up high. He rhythmically called out, “Ready~~ One, Two... Three!”

As the word “Three” left his lips, that sword light shot forward like a bolt of lightning!

The sound of “Three” seemed to echo in Scholar Song’s ears, but the cultivator had already shrunk to the size of a fingernail in the distance.

“What is this supposed to mean?” Scholar Song was utterly confused.

“Ha ha, this is a challenge!” Venerable White chuckled, his gaze sharpening.

“A challenge? Wait!” Scholar Song’s heart sank. He hurriedly said, “Senior, could it be that you misunderstood? Maybe he was just passing by casually!”

The instructor, Little Li, was completely baffled, not understanding what their dialogue meant. Why did he comprehend every word separately, yet found the entire conversation incomprehensible?
