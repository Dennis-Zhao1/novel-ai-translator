**What to Do When Your Major Doesn't Match Your Job? (Happy New Year!)**

“Ah, ouch, ouch.” The primitive man winced as his palms were smacked, his body jolting with each painful hit, yet he dared not pull his hands back.

He stood there with tears brimming in his eyes, obediently taking the punishment, each palm struck a full ten times until they were red and sore.

The scene… was reminiscent of an ancient classroom where a strict old scholar reprimanded a wayward student.

However, when the stern scholar was replaced by a young man clad in a black coat, and the wayward student was a towering primitive man, the whole situation suddenly took on a comical twist.

Miss Lu Fei glanced apologetically at the primitive man who had just been smacked. She hadn’t expected her uncontrollable laughter to lead to his punishment of ten strikes, and she felt quite guilty about it. Had she known he would be penalized, she would have clamped her mouth shut, determined not to laugh.

“Get back to your spot and write out the ‘Three Character Classic’ three times. If you don’t finish, you won’t get any food,” the young man in the black coat commanded in a deep voice.

The primitive man, as if granted a reprieve, rubbed his sore palms and hurried off… presumably to write out the ‘Three Character Classic’ as instructed.

The two rows of primitive men standing by looked on with envy at his retreating figure—only having to write the ‘Three Character Classic’ three times meant he could escape the confines of this straw hut and the company of the black-coated man.

What bliss that seemed!

After all, writing the ‘Three Character Classic’ three times wouldn’t take long, but staying near the black-coated man could mean a harsher punishment if they erred again. The thought of being tied to the great tree at the tribe’s entrance and being beaten was a grim one. The screams from such punishments echoed for miles.

The black-coated man retracted the ruler and then stood with his hands clasped behind his back, striding towards the group of passengers.

Seeing that this man was clearly of East Asian descent and held significant authority among the primitives—who were visibly fearful of him—the passengers felt a slight sense of relief. At least their safety seemed somewhat assured now.

At the same time, some passengers, particularly those with the gift of gab, tried to step forward and engage the black-coated man in conversation, hoping to make a good impression.

However, the young man’s serious demeanor radiated an unspoken authority. Under this heavy aura of gravitas, even the most eloquent among them found themselves unable to utter a single word.

Before long, the black-coated man strode confidently to the elderly professor at the front of the group.

“Hello,” he nodded in greeting.

As soon as he spoke, the elderly professor felt a weight lift off him, and he quickly responded, “Hello to you too.”

Unconsciously, the professor used the respectful term “you” when addressing the black-coated man… despite the latter looking quite youthful while the professor was already gray-haired.

It was an invisible pressure and aura of authority.

The black-coated man nodded and continued, “Who are you?”

“I am Professor Nan Tianxing from Jichuan University in Huaxia.” The professor stood up, lowering his posture.

“A university professor?” The black-coated man’s eyes lit up at this revelation!

He then laughed heartily and warmly shook Professor Nan’s hand. “So, it’s you, Professor Nan! I’ve heard so much about you!”

With that smile, the heavy aura of authority evaporated, as if the ice had suddenly melted into a warm spring, allowing the passengers to breathe easier.

Professor Nan Tianxing nodded, a smile creeping onto his face… It seemed his work in the biology department was indeed well-respected. Now that he revealed his name, even this black-coated man recognized him, and his attitude had shifted dramatically.

A surge of pride welled up within Professor Nan—after reaching his level in academia, he found that what mattered more than wealth was reputation! If he could make breakthroughs in his research, that would be the pinnacle of success.

The black-coated man continued with enthusiasm, “You must be the one responsible for teaching Chinese, right?”

“Uh, yes, um… what?” Professor Nan’s smile froze in place.

The elderly professor was utterly baffled.

Teaching Chinese?

No, that’s not right! I’m not from the Chinese department; I’m from the biology department, specializing in plant classification!

The professor felt an overwhelming pain in his heart—an enormous, glaring pain!

“You’ve arrived just in time! I’ve been waiting for you for a while!” the black-coated man said with great warmth. “I’ve been at my wit’s end trying to teach these primitives Chinese. Just recently, a friend finally guided me on teaching them the phonetic alphabet, and they barely managed to memorize the ‘Three Character Classic.’ But since I started teaching them the ‘Analects,’ they’ve gone back to being foolish. I can’t figure out where my teaching methods are going wrong.”

So it turns out the black-coated man had been the one teaching the primitives the ‘Three Character Classic’… and now he wanted to teach them the ‘Analects’?

Many of the younger passengers exchanged awkward glances.

These primitives were going to learn the ‘Analects’?

Let’s be honest, even among the locals born and raised in Huaxia, very few had completed the ‘Analects’ in its entirety. Nowadays, middle and primary school textbooks only included selected excerpts for study, and hardly anyone learned it from start to finish.

In fact, many of those present hadn’t even finished the ‘Three Character Classic’…

Professor Nan Tianxing was equally embarrassed—he was now certain that the black-coated man had mistaken him. This was a huge misunderstanding that needed to be clarified!

But before Professor Nan could explain, the black-coated man handed him the hefty ruler. “So, Professor Nan, from today on, the task of teaching these primitives the ‘Analects’ is yours! Don’t worry; I won’t shortchange you. I know it’s quite a challenge to come to this little island to teach these wild men during summer vacation, but I promise you that once you finish teaching them the ‘Analects,’ I will reward you handsomely—beyond your wildest expectations!”

Finally, Professor Nan was about to clear up the misunderstanding, but the next statement from the black-coated man cut off his thoughts!

“Don’t worry, with this ruler in your hand, all the primitives in this village will heed your instruction. Don’t be afraid of them; if anyone doesn’t learn well, you can smack them hard with the ruler—really lay into them!” the black-coated man insisted, adding as reassurance, “Don’t worry; they won’t eat you.”

Professor Nan’s heart sank—did the black-coated man just imply that if he couldn’t teach the Chinese language and didn’t have the ruler, he could be eaten by the primitives?

That’s terrifying!

C’mon, it’s just teaching people to read, right? It’s just the ‘Analects’… I’m a professor from a prestigious university, and while I may not specialize in the ‘Analects,’ I can at least read!

“Rest assured, we’re a big group, and we’ll do our best to help the primitives learn more characters; we’ll strive to finish teaching the entire ‘Analects’ this summer,” Professor Nan promised through gritted teeth.

At the same time, he made sure to rally all the passengers behind him—after all, they had shared this arduous experience together. If they could lend a hand, they should; at the very least, they couldn’t allow the passengers to be seen as ‘useless’ and end up as a meal for the primitives.

“That’s good to hear; now I can relax,” the black-coated man said with a smile, nodding in approval.

Then, with his hands clasped behind his back, he left the straw hut in a good mood.

As he walked away, he couldn’t help but wonder: Strange, why did my friend ‘Drunk Cloud’ send a professor to help me teach? And why did he send so many people along? Was it for auxiliary teaching, or was there a special reason?

I should check in with the Jiuzhou No. 1 group later to find out. I’ll ask ‘Drunk Sun’ if there’s any special arrangement.

With those thoughts in mind, he strolled toward his residence.

Yes, this young man in the black coat was indeed the master of the Seven Life Talismans, who had vowed in his youth to teach one thousand illiterate people to read Chinese characters.

This small island in the Pacific was the wild man island he had mentioned to the Jiuzhou No. 1 group.

……

……

After the black-coated man left, the row of primitive men collectively sighed in relief. Yet, when their gazes fell upon the ruler in the elderly professor’s hand, they immediately straightened up, clearly afraid of that ruler!

Seeing the primitives' reaction, Professor Nan and the passengers also felt relieved.

“Ahem, everyone just witnessed what happened,” the professor said with a mix of laughter and tears as he turned to the passengers.

A certain Mr. Gao nodded. “Professor, we all saw it. You’ve worked hard, and if there’s anything we can do to assist you in teaching the primitives, we’ll do our best to cooperate.”

Professor Nan sighed heavily. “That’s good to hear.”

At this moment, a fellow named Tu Bo spoke up, “Professor, we’re not experts in teaching. You’re the authority on Chinese. Since that black-coated gentleman asked us to finish teaching the primitives the ‘Analects’ during the summer, we might be racing against time. What do you think we should focus on first?”

Tu Bo was worried that if they couldn’t finish teaching the ‘Analects’ during the summer, the black-coated gentleman might become angry. He still felt the heavy pressure of authority from earlier.

In fact, they had forgotten to ask about ‘Scholar Song’ earlier because of the pressure from that black-coated man… After a little while, they would definitely need to meet with that black-coated gentleman to inquire about Song’s situation.

Professor Nan Tianxing: “…”

After a moment of silence, he sighed deeply. “Well, there’s something I need to tell everyone. I’m actually a professor in the biology department specializing in plant classification.”

Instantly, the passengers froze in shock.

In that moment, you could hear a pin drop in the room.
