**Chapter 1: A Meeting of Shadows**

"Nice to meet you, I’m Scholar Song!"

That day, on the way back from capturing a Phantom Spirit, Fay Yu had mentioned to Scholar Song that her father once sealed a Phantom Spirit at the 'Ghost Lantern Temple.' However, Fay Yu had subdued two Phantom Spirits.

Phantom Spirits don’t give birth, so where did the second one come from?

Perhaps the two Phantom Spirits were actually a male and female, destined to meet across a thousand miles, engaging in a forbidden love between spirits and demons?

Or maybe someone had intentionally released the Phantom Spirits into Ghost Lantern Temple for cultivation.

If it were the former, then there would be no issue at all.

But if it were the latter, then that would be a serious problem!

Now, it seemed more likely to be the latter.

"If it’s the latter, does that mean someone wants to retrieve the Phantom Spirit from me?" Scholar Song's eyes were clear as he thought, "And then, eliminate me in the process?"

The world of cultivators has always been ruthless.

With powers that transcend the mundane, the laws of the mortal realm can hardly restrain powerful cultivators.

The only thing that can bind a cultivator is their own moral compass, ethics, and the bottom line of being 'human.' Once their morals and ethics crumble, losing self-restraint, some cultivators can commit any atrocity.

Massacres, brutality, oppression, treating human lives as mere weeds to be trampled upon... these are the harsh realities that make up the perilous and cruel world of cultivators.

"You took my treasure, I’ll kill your entire family." Some extremist and sinister cultivators would indeed go to such lengths.

Scholar Song, who hadn’t even completed his foundation stage, was already exposed to the cruel side of the cultivation world.

"Of course, we can’t rule out the last possibility," Scholar Song mused as he held the 'Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl.' The last possibility being that ‘treasure tempts the heart.’ His previous lack of discretion with the Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl might have allowed someone with ulterior motives to see it when he wasn’t paying attention. Thus, that person might harbor thoughts of murder and treasure theft.

If that were the case, then the victim would truly be doomed.

"However, the other party has already entered the room and even approached my bedside, so why didn’t they strike me?" The blade had fallen right next to his bed; it made no sense for them to retreat at such a critical moment.

"Is someone protecting me?" Scholar Song recalled the faint scent of blood.

Could it be the Alchemical Sage?

He carefully stored away the thin blade and decided to visit the Alchemical Sage before class started. 

He had many questions to ask the elder.

Plus, he needed to consult the elder on how to 'stay vigilant' and 'conceal treasures.'

After washing up, Scholar Song hurriedly threw on his clothes, not even having time for breakfast, and dashed out toward the campus gate.

As he left the boys' dormitory, he spotted a tall figure waving at him from a distance.

"Scholar Song!" The figure approached—it was none other than the towering Nan Haomeng, whom Scholar Song had easily defeated the night before.

Scholar Song halted, looking at him with a puzzled expression.

"I’ve found out about the person investigating you," Nan Haomeng said, lowering his voice as he got closer.

Scholar Song raised an eyebrow in surprise. "Your efficiency is surprisingly quick."

It had only been one night, right?

"Of course! In this fast-paced era, if you don’t step up your efficiency, you’ll be left behind by the world," Nan Haomeng proclaimed, sounding rather philosophical, but his large frame made it feel rather awkward.

In reality, the investigation that Nan Haomeng had organized went better than he had anticipated. He had simply asked two lackluster club members to help find the person Scholar Song was looking for, and they quickly came back with information.

Mainly, after they had been beaten by Scholar Song that night, they secretly dug into his background, making it easy to pinpoint the target.

"Who is it?" Scholar Song asked, eager for this information.

"It’s a student from our school, Lin Tao, a sophomore in the finance department, living in the dorms. His dorm isn’t far from here. Do you want to go check him out?" Nan Haomeng replied.

Scholar Song frowned. Not a stranger, but a student from their own school?

But he quickly realized that the person gathering intelligence on him wouldn’t be foolish enough to expose themselves. In this day and age, all it takes is a little money to have someone dig up some personal information; it’s quite easy.

This student must be one of the hired hands.

Scholar Song glanced at the time. "There’s still time; let’s go check him out."

With that, Scholar Song clenched his fists.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Finance Department Boys' Dormitory.

Lin Tao rarely woke up this early. He had been in good spirits these past few days; two days ago, a guy wearing oversized sunglasses—someone who looked like they had money to burn—had given him a sum that covered his living expenses for the entire year, asking him to look into a student named 'Scholar Song' at Jiangnan University Town.

The man claimed he was worried because his daughter had been hanging out with a student named Scholar Song, so he wanted Lin Tao to investigate Scholar Song’s background.

Lin Tao immediately sensed that the man was lying—however, given the substantial amount of money, he chose to play along with the ruse.

No one would turn down money, after all, and checking on a classmate was a trivial task. So he took the money and quickly gathered a wealth of information about Scholar Song.

With this unexpected windfall, Lin Tao had been living quite luxuriously these past couple of days.

Knock, knock, knock—there was a knock at the door.

"Is Lin Tao living here?" A soft, friendly male voice called from outside, instantly creating a sense of familiarity.

"Who could it be this early?" Lin Tao wondered, but he opened the door nonetheless.

As the door swung open, Lin Tao was met with a daunting sight. A towering figure, over two meters tall, stood expressionless at his doorstep, exuding an intimidating presence that startled him.

Instinctively, he wanted to slam the door shut.

"Are you Lin Tao?" The soft voice rang out again.

In that moment, Lin Tao noticed that beside the giant stood a friendly-looking student.

Seeing this boy eased Lin Tao’s tension a bit. "Yes, that’s me. What can I do for you?"

"Nice to meet you, I’m Scholar Song," Scholar Song said, his gentle expression fading.

Scholar Song? That name sounded familiar.

Wait a minute, wasn’t this the person that 'money-bags' had asked him to investigate?

Lin Tao suddenly realized something was off, and he instinctively took a step back, reaching for the door to close it.

But Scholar Song reached out and pressed lightly against the door: "Looks like Lin Tao knows me."

At that moment, Lin Tao found he couldn’t close the door no matter how hard he tried.

He was taken aback—what kind of strength was this? This person, who appeared rather unassuming, was holding the door shut with a single hand, and despite using all his might, Lin Tao couldn’t budge it even an inch.

"Given your reaction, I’m right about you. So, Lin Tao, do you want to have a nice chat with me, or would you prefer to have a talk with my fists?" Scholar Song enunciated each word clearly—if anyone had put his life and the lives of his friends and family at risk due to the leaked information, he would be furious.

For a brief moment, Scholar Song even considered beating the guy to the point where he couldn’t take care of himself.

"Don’t do anything reckless; we’re at school. If you act out, no one will come out unscathed," Lin Tao said, panic evident in his voice.

"Thanks for the reminder," Scholar Song nodded. "But Lin Tao, do you plan to spend your entire life at school without ever stepping out?"

As soon as you step outside, we’ll have a nice chat with my fists.

Lin Tao wasn’t foolish; he understood the implication behind those words.

"Let’s find a place to talk properly. I promise to tell you everything I know," Lin Tao said with a wry smile, realizing that greed was truly one of the greatest sins.

Scholar Song released the door and turned to head towards the rooftop.

At that moment, Lin Tao seriously contemplated slamming the door shut and calling for help from the dorm supervisor. But when he glanced at the towering figure beside him, he swallowed hard.
