**Lychee Fairy**

“That flying sword has the inscription ‘Meteor’,” Venerable White replied.

“Meteor Sword?” Young Master Tang suddenly thought of something: “Could it be the ‘Cold Flame Sword’ Liu Tianzong?”

That would be the infamous senior from the Empty Thief Sect!

“Is there a character that matches this description? Please tell me more,” Venerable White smiled, his smile carrying a magical charm that made Young Master Tang unconsciously spill all the information she had.

“The Cold Flame Sword Liu Tianzong, over a hundred years ago, was known as ‘Master of Ingenious Hands’ Liu Tianzong. He was an outstanding disciple in our Empty Thief Sect, often able to breach seals that even the elders of the sect couldn’t crack, to seek treasures,” Young Master Tang recalled. Although she was still young, most of what she knew about Liu Tianzong came from her master’s stories.

“About a hundred years ago, Liu Tianzong discovered an ancient cultivator’s estate. He spent a long time unlocking layer upon layer of mechanisms, eventually digging into the ancient immortal’s estate. According to him, what he ultimately obtained was just a flying sword and a statue.”

“He once considered bringing that statue back to the Empty Thief Sect, but for some reason, he buried the statue back underground midway, only bringing back the ‘Meteor Sword’ to the sect.”

“And then, upon returning, he went into seclusion, frantically cultivating, rarely searching for treasures anymore... The elders in the sect said that all his remarkable skills had been wasted.”

“A decade later, he suddenly broke out of his seclusion and ventured into the world. Within a few years, he had established the impressive reputation of the ‘Cold Flame Sword’.”

“That’s about it,” Young Master Tang concluded.

There were still some private matters regarding the ‘Cold Flame Sword’ senior that she didn’t elaborate on—for instance, when Cold Flame Sword Liu Tianzong returned to the sect with the Meteor Sword, he had a dazed expression.

The next day, he frantically began chasing after women, seeing at least three a day, or even five or six, for nearly a year. The elders of the sect believed he was going to ruin himself. But after a year, he started another round of seclusion, paying no attention to the outside world, and remained in seclusion for nearly eighty-eight years. When he emerged, he had become a powerful sword cultivator.

Venerable White nodded gently. This ‘Cold Flame Sword’ Liu Tianzong was indeed the one who took his Meteor Sword.

“Do you know where the Cold Flame Sword is now?” Venerable White inquired.

Upon hearing this question, Young Master Tang suddenly became alert. She looked at Venerable White in panic, unwilling to answer—she was worried that Venerable White would harm the sect’s senior.

“Don’t worry, I have no intention of harming any of you,” Venerable White said. “I just want to retrieve my Meteor Sword.”

Young Master Tang still refused to speak.

After all, Cold Flame Sword Liu Tianzong seemed to be going to rescue a senior from the Empty Thief Sect, ‘Daoist Yunwu,’ who had been suppressed by a meteorite from beyond the heavens for over two hundred years.

This concerned the safety of two seniors, so she dared not say more!

“The little girl is quite vigilant. Fine, you can stay here with me for a few days. After a while, I will take you to find the ‘Meteor Sword,’” Venerable White said with a smile.

Meanwhile, Scholar Song was left bewildered after finishing a call with the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

He immediately opened his phone and entered the Ninefold Land Group to see if he could find any clues.

The Ninefold Land Group was bustling with activity because a very popular senior had seemingly just returned from overseas with a ‘Native Deity.’

Just a few minutes ago, Lychee Fairy had sent a bright smiley face emoji in the group.

The name ‘Lychee’ sounded a bit strange. It was mainly because her master had whimsically given all his disciples odd names.

There were Peach Fairy, Daoist Summer Pear, Daoist Pineapple, Cherry Fairy... all named after fruits. Compared to names like Peach Fairy, Lychee was relatively normal.

Over time, she became numb to it and got used to it.

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain: “Lychee, welcome back.”

Lychee Fairy: “Thank you, Senior Yellow Mountain. I’m finally back. This trip took some time; that native deity was hiding in an independent space, making it hard to track. But in the end, I managed to find it and gave it a taste of one thousand Thunderbolts, taking it down.”

Drunken Moon Scholar: “Welcome back~”

“How was your haul, Lychee Fairy? Next time you go hunting for native deities overseas, remember to invite me!” The Copper Hexagram Master, finally released from mute, sighed.

“The haul was decent, but the native deities are getting poorer lately. I suggest everyone look for those that haven’t been beaten in a long time next time,” Lychee Fairy replied, followed by several photos.

The photos featured a big-eyed Eastern woman with a carefree smile, complete with two dimples when she grinned. At her feet lay a creature resembling a combination of a snake and an insect, one of the native deities.

There are many classifications of native deities; some are mutated beasts, some are spirits born from incense offerings, and others are humans who have transformed through certain unique cultivation methods.

The later photos showcased her spoils, including some excellent materials for refining tools and alchemy, as well as the corpse of the native deity. Generally, cultivators seldom killed native deities, as it would incur unnecessary karma, which could be troublesome.

However, this native deity had angered Lychee Fairy, so she dispatched it without hesitation.

The Alchemical Sage: “Lychee Fairy, you’re still as beautiful as ever, %＊—＃）！￥＃”

The latter part turned into a jumble of unreadable characters. Considering the Alchemical Sage had a lady named Jiang Ziyan beside him, it was easy to understand what had just happened. Complimenting other women in front of Jiang Ziyan was a dangerous move.

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain calmly ignored the Alchemical Sage and said in the group: “Lychee, when you have time, share more photos in the group.”

“?” Lychee Fairy responded, puzzled.

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain quickly switched to private chat mode and contacted Lychee Fairy: “Hmm, Venerable White has emerged from seclusion. There’s a new friend in the group currently hosting him.”

“Oh, oh,” Lychee Fairy expressed her understanding—understanding what? Did the new friend hosting Venerable White expect her photos to play a role?

Just then, the Copper Hexagram Master chimed in again: “Haha, speaking of Lychee Fairy’s photos, I still have one of Lychee’s ‘fruit photo’ saved! It’s very white and radiant!”

“What?!” Lychee Fairy sent a wide-eyed emoji. When did she ever take a ‘fruit photo’? And why was it described as white and radiant?

Master of Snow Wolf Cavern: “Though my aesthetic view differs from yours humans, I’d like to see it.”

Dharma King of Creation: “I’m interested in having a look.”

Master of the Seven Lives Talisman: “If you’re going to share, I don’t mind taking a look.”

The Alchemical Sage: “……—％＃”

The Copper Hexagram Master smiled with delight and then sent a photo of Lychee!

A bunch of fresh lychees, their shells peeled back to reveal the soft, white flesh inside—succulent and delicious...
