**The Sugar Master of the Empty Thief Guild**

“Ugh! Dou Dou has definitely been watching too many inappropriate movies lately.”

As Scholar Song was preparing to draft an eight-hundred-word essay in his mind to criticize Dou Dou for her recent antics, his phone suddenly rang from his pocket.

He pulled it out to see it was a call from their group leader, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

“Hello, Immortal Sage, what’s up?” Scholar Song answered.

“Haha, remember how I mentioned I ordered a batch of cars for you and Venerable White? Well, thirteen of them have already been delivered to a designated underground parking lot near Jiangnan University Town. The rest will follow within a month. Someone will call you shortly to arrange the pickup. I’ve secured the entire parking lot, so just park any spare vehicles there,” the Immortal Sage chuckled.

Scholar Song felt a rush of excitement. After obtaining his driver’s license, he had naturally been dreaming of owning a nice car. Every man dreams of speeding through the sky, but a luxury car is also a part of that dream. “No problem! I can head over anytime!”

“Also,” the Immortal Sage whispered, lowering his voice, “is Venerable White with you?”

“No, I’m on my way home from school,” Scholar Song replied.

“Got it. I have to ask, has Venerable White’s luck been unusually good lately?” the Immortal Sage inquired quietly.

“Luck? It seems like Venerable White has indeed been quite fortunate recently,” Scholar Song nodded. 

For instance, he recalled how Venerable White had won the grand prize in a lottery outside the electronics mall. And when he had contracted the 'Phantom Spirit,' a scattering of rogue cultivators' corpses had rained down from the sky, dropping a flying sword and a bronze ring. The flying sword was now being used by Venerable White for transportation.

“Yeah, I thought so. Just be cautious, Scholar Song! When Venerable White’s luck is high, you need to be extra careful,” the Immortal Sage warned.

“Be careful? Why’s that?” Scholar Song asked, perplexed.

“Let me put it simply: imagine a meteorite suddenly crashing down near Venerable White. He could break it open and find tons of refining materials for cultivators. That’s good luck, right?” the Immortal Sage explained.

“Yeah,” Scholar Song nodded.

“But what if that meteorite nearly crushed you next to Venerable White? Or worse, what if you got seriously injured by it?” the Immortal Sage continued, his tone grave.

Scholar Song quickly grasped the implication. “Immortal Sage, you mean to say that Venerable White’s fortune often comes hand in hand with misfortune for those around him?”

“Not exactly that. A more fitting phrase would be ‘Fortune favors the bold!’ Just be careful, and you might find some nice rewards in the end,” the Immortal Sage remarked thoughtfully.

“Got it, I understand now.” Scholar Song nodded, realizing this might be the reason why the seniors in the group often kept their distance from Venerable White.

“Lastly, one more thing. Consider this a piece of advice from an experienced senior,” the Immortal Sage said cryptically. “You should chat with some pretty girls more often. For instance, the lovely Fay Yu from our ‘Ninefold Land One’ group. Talk to her frequently and think of her beautiful attributes. Or there's also the Lychee Fairy in the group; she just returned from dealing with a local deity who once offended her. She should be online more often too. If you have the chance, get to know her; she enjoys taking selfies, so you’ll see plenty of her beautiful photos. Take time to appreciate her beauty.”

“What?” Scholar Song was left baffled.

“Nothing much. Just interact more with pretty girls. Trust me on this; it won’t steer you wrong!” the Immortal Sage said meaningfully. “Well, I’ll hang up now.”

Beep... beep… The Immortal Sage hung up.

Scholar Song held his phone, feeling frustrated. “I always feel like the seniors in our group speak in half-truths. Why not just be clear about things?”

Dou Dou, sitting nearby, turned to him with a deep gaze and silently nodded. “It’s fine. You don’t need to heed that big fool, Huang Shan. He’s just too lewd!”

Scholar Song: “…”

Meanwhile, at the Alchemical Sage's apartment.

Venerable White leaned against the white wall, striking a cool pose. “How’s this?”

“Perfect! Just like that!” In front of him stood a young woman in a police uniform, about twenty years old, holding a DSLR camera and swallowing hard.

She was the civil servant responsible for processing Venerable White’s temporary residency permit.

Click, click, click! She snapped three quick pictures of Venerable White before licking her lips. “Let’s do one last pose. After that, I’ll pick the best shot to use for your permit!”

“Oh, okay. But do we really need so many photos for a temporary permit?” Venerable White asked, somewhat puzzled yet still cooperating, striking a pose with one hand on his forehead, looking effortlessly cool.

“Absolutely! I need to make the most perfect temporary permit possible!” the young officer insisted, flipping through the twenty or so photos she had already taken.

What a pity! She wished she could take even more pictures. In fact, she wanted to capture this handsome man named ‘Song Bai’ in her camera and take him home. He was just too attractive! She could brag about him to her female colleagues for ages.

Song Bai—that was Venerable White’s current name.

Since Venerable White only had the single character ‘Bai’ for his name, it wasn’t practical for an ID. So, the Master of Snow Wolf Cavern had casually given him the surname Song while preparing his identification documents.

Reluctantly finishing the last photo, the young officer left her contact information. “Mr. Song Bai, I’ll have your temporary permit ready within two days! If you need it urgently, feel free to reach out, and I can expedite it for you!”

“Thank you,” Venerable White smiled gently at her.

The young officer blushed, her heart racing like a drum as she carefully slung her DSLR over her shoulder. After stealing a few more glances at Venerable White, she reluctantly departed from the Alchemical Sage’s apartment.

Venerable White let out a quiet sigh of relief. Throughout the photo session, he had been meticulously controlling his aura to avoid inadvertently releasing his innate ‘charm’—it was exhausting.

Once the young officer was gone, he headed to the small courtyard and pulled out a large box.

Inside… was the ‘loot’ he had accumulated from his efforts yesterday and this morning. Besides the large-screen TV, water distiller, speakers, rice cooker, and induction cooker from earlier, there was now a range hood, microwave, and soybean milk maker…

If the young officer hadn’t arrived so early, he would have dismantled even more items.

Of course, he had carefully inscribed illusionary formations around the items to conceal any anomalies, ensuring they wouldn’t be detected in the short term—hopefully, Scholar Song wouldn’t notice anything unusual!

He decided to dispose of these items while Scholar Song was still out!

At that moment… a slightly chubby girl was stealthily approaching the Alchemical Sage’s apartment, carefully attempting to crack the defensive array—it was none other than the Sugar Master of the Empty Thief Guild.
