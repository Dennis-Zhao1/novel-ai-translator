**Mighty Yet Unyielding, Should Chastity Be Sacrificed?**

Guoguo trembled as he reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone.

With tears welling up, he lamented, “Senior Doudou, my phone is broken! That lightning just now fried it.”

Without the phone, there was no way to call Brother Song.

Doudou: “…”

“Senior Doudou, what on earth is happening to us? Did we do something heinous?” The little monk asked anxiously, reciting Buddhist scriptures in an attempt to ease his guilt.

“I’m not worried about anything else,” Doudou sighed deeply, “I’m just worried that if it’s not Scholar Song coming after us, but rather Venerable White…”

“What happens if it’s Venerable White chasing us?” the little monk asked cautiously.

“People will die!” Doudou replied emphatically—yes, people, not just pets.

The little monk was instantly terrified: “So what do we do?”

“Don’t panic; we can’t be sure if it’s Venerable White chasing us yet. Let’s find a public phone and call Brother Song to confirm.” Doudou said calmly. “If it is Venerable White…”

“Do we just surrender?” the little monk interjected.

“No, we’ll immediately call the Alchemical Sage to reserve a hospital bed. Then we’ll rush over there and check in peacefully.” Doudou declared solemnly.

The little monk gulped nervously: “Reserve a bed? Wouldn’t it be easier to just surrender?”

“Hmph! As the ancients say: Wealth and power cannot sway, poverty cannot change, and might cannot bend; this is what defines a true man! No matter how mighty it is, I will not yield.” Doudou boasted proudly.

So… they were determined to go to the Alchemical Sage's hospital instead of surrendering? The little monk couldn’t help but feel confused.

“Before Zhou Li catches up, let’s find a place to make a call.” Doudou urged.

As they flew through the air, it took a while, but they finally spotted a small convenience store with a sign indicating a public phone.

“In this day and age, finding a place to make a phone call is quite the challenge.” Doudou said as they landed beside the convenience store and entered.

…

“You go make the call. I’ll transmit Scholar Song’s number to you! You still have some change, right?” Doudou said.

“I have a little.” The little monk nodded.

Together, they approached the store. The little monk pressed his palms together and addressed the shopkeeper: “Dear lady, I’d like to make a phone call.”

“Oh my, what a cute little monk!” The shopkeeper smiled. “Would you like me to help you dial?”

“Thank you, dear lady, but I can do it myself.” The little monk replied politely.

He picked up the phone, entered the number Doudou transmitted, and dialed Scholar Song.

Soon, a friendly automated voice came through: “Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.”

The little monk turned stiffly and told Doudou, “Brother Song’s phone is off.”

Doudou: “…”

“Sorry, dear lady, the call didn’t go through.” The little monk bowed apologetically to the shopkeeper.

The shopkeeper was smitten by the little monk’s cuteness.

…

“Why would Brother Song’s phone be off?” Doudou wondered, perplexed. Scholar Song had learned a charging technique, so even if his phone was dead, he could easily recharge it.

As Doudou was pondering, its expression suddenly changed. It turned and sniffed the air, feeling a jolt of alarm.

Immediately, it transmitted to the little monk, “Guoguo, we need to get out of here! I sense Zhou Li’s aura approaching. This time, Zhou Li seems a bit off; how can he catch up to me so quickly?”

The little monk hurriedly bid farewell to the shopkeeper, and they dashed away.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Doudou carried the little monk on its back as they soared into the sky, continuing towards the capital.

“Senior Doudou… should we call the Alchemical Sage?” the little monk asked anxiously.

“Let’s get some distance from Zhou Li first!” Doudou replied.

While they were speaking, Doudou suddenly halted mid-air. In the next moment, it shot straight up, activating the four wind-and-fire wheels beneath its feet.

They ascended rapidly, quickly reaching a height of over a hundred meters!

“Senior Doudou?” the little monk asked in confusion.

“Don’t talk; Zhou Li is right behind us.” Doudou replied. It had been years of back-and-forth fighting with Zhou Li over running away from home; both were well aware of each other’s tactics.

Just as Doudou lifted off, a chain with hooks appeared below, snaking up like a serpent.

If Doudou hadn’t shot upwards in that instant, it would have been caught dead-on by the chain.

However, Doudou managed to dodge!

“Hehehe, Zhou Li, you still can’t catch me! After all these years, you’re still using the same trick. Your hidden chain is stealthy, but I’ve already figured out the pattern. Just a tiny hint, and I can dodge you easily. What a naïve fool you are, Zhou Li; can’t you come up with something new?” Doudou boasted triumphantly.

“Naïve?” Suddenly, Zhou Li’s voice echoed from above Doudou.

Then, another chain descended from the sky, transforming into a massive net that descended upon Doudou and the little monk.

Below, Zhou Li's ‘Hidden Chain’ also coiled up, forming another net that came from below.

This was a net of heaven and earth!

“Crap, two hidden chains!” Doudou exclaimed. The four wind-and-fire wheels beneath it spun rapidly as it propelled forward with all its might.

But just as Doudou sped ahead, a violent gust of wind hit.

Although the strong wind had minimal effect on Doudou’s speed, sometimes, it’s that little bit of speed that makes all the difference.

The net formed by the hidden chains ensnared Doudou tightly.

In the blink of an eye, the two hidden chains firmly bound Doudou’s four legs, tying it into a pretzel shape.

The little monk on Doudou’s back was also securely tied.

“Damn it, I won’t accept this!” Doudou shouted. If it hadn’t been for that sudden gust of wind, it would never have been caught by the hidden chains.

And who would have thought there would be two chains? Zhou Li had always used one hidden chain!

“Ha, you won’t accept it?” Zhou Li, standing firmly on a beam of sword light, landed right in front of Doudou. “The hidden chain has always been two… I just didn’t have the skill to use both before. I only recently mastered the technique for the second one. Perfect for trying it out on you.”

Beside Zhou Li stood the demon-catching girl, glaring at Doudou.

“I won’t accept it! If it weren’t for that gust of wind, there’s no way you’d have caught me! Don’t think you can easily capture me even with two hidden chains!” Doudou gritted its teeth.

“Ha, no matter how you spin it… you’re caught now!” Zhou Li pulled out a pipe, lit it, and took a deep puff.

Doudou clenched its teeth in frustration: “…”

Zhou Li took another deep drag from the pipe, releasing long tendrils of smoke from his nostrils.

After being deceived by Doudou yesterday, Zhou Li had vowed to settle the score. But today, his demeanor was even stranger than before.

Zhou Li appeared overly calm—Doudou had expected him to be furious, ready to beat it up.

But now, Zhou Li showed no anger whatsoever; he simply smoked in silence. This unusual calmness made Doudou more anxious.

This was a moment of eerie stillness before a storm, a prelude to an imminent explosion!

After a while, Zhou Li let out two more streams of smoke from his nostrils and finally spoke, “Doudou… let’s just forget about what happened yesterday.”

“??????” Doudou’s mind was flooded with question marks.

“Forget about yesterday,” Zhou Li said in an immensely melancholic tone. “Yesterday, you didn’t say ‘kiss’ to me, and I didn’t know you were my ‘kiss.’ Let’s pretend yesterday never happened!”

“???” Doudou felt even more confused. Forgive it for being just a dog, sometimes it really couldn’t grasp human reasoning.

Zhou Li took another deep puff from his pipe, this time exhaling smoke from both his nose and mouth simultaneously: “From now on, I’ll keep chatting online with ‘Kiss.’ You don’t need to worry, just keep playing your role as ‘Kiss.’”

At this point, Zhou Li’s tone was almost tear-jerking.

“Uncle, don’t cry.” The demon-catching girl gently patted Zhou Li’s back, comforting him in a childlike voice.

Her words only made Zhou Li want to cry even more.

Doudou: “…”

Finally, it understood—Zhou Li had completely lost his mind.

What was even scarier was the implication of what Zhou Li just said!

Zhou Li meant he was seriously considering pursuing a net romance with ‘Doudou,’ the male dog? Not only species but even gender seemed to be irrelevant?

This escalated the situation into a terrifying realm; Doudou felt its chastity was in jeopardy!

If only time could rewind, Doudou promised it would never have made that joke with Zhou Li yesterday.

No way, it had to rectify this mistake.

Zhou Li’s shattered worldview had to be rebuilt by it!

“Zhou Li, you’re mistaken!” Doudou declared seriously. “I was just joking yesterday!”

“Joke?” Zhou Li turned to face Doudou, his face shrouded in white smoke, creating an inexplicably terrifying aura.

“Yes, I admit it was a terrible joke. However, your ‘Kiss’ is a real person! I merely borrowed her account without permission. Believe me!” Doudou insisted, its tone more earnest than ever!
