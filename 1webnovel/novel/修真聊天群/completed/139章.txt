**Book Mountain Is Too Stressful!**

Scholar Song was having a lucky day. Not far from him, the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect had gone crazy; after a short while of jumping around, they all collapsed to the ground, completely oblivious to his presence.

Within the Blue Source Valley, the blood mist thickened.

After about two breaths, Scholar Song suddenly felt a warm sensation in his heart aperture, a familiar heat that he recognized all too well. This was the same feeling he experienced every time he practiced the "Diamond Basic Fist Technique" and then used the "True Self Meditation Scripture" to channel his vital energy into his heart aperture.

However, when he cultivated alone, he usually only felt a slight warmth before stopping. Unlike now, where the sensation was like a continuous surge of increasing heat.

This meant that the vitality within his heart aperture was rapidly rising! The more it increased, the less time he would spend completing his hundred-day foundation building in the future.

If this trend continued, he might even reach the point of opening his heart aperture today, completing his foundation building in a mere hundred days!

This was one of the "benefits" that the Master of Seven Life Talismans had mentioned.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Boom!

The blade of Sable Seven struck into the Blue Source Valley, plunging into the thick blood mist.

Boom, boom, boom… The terrifying sound of the blade’s aura exploding echoed continuously.

Just how powerful was the "Heavenly Blade Burial of Stars"?

As a technique that even Sable Seven himself could not fully control, this strike unleashed blade energy that could spread hundreds of meters without diminishing in intensity!

Clang, clang, clang—

Strange sounds emerged from within the blood mist, which only grew denser.

Five breaths later.

Sable Seven sheathed his sword, but his brow furrowed even deeper!

It appeared that Young Master Hai was still alive?

As the blood mist gradually dissipated within the Blue Source Valley, the first thing that caught Sable Seven’s eye was the disheveled Young Master Hai. His clothes were tattered, and his body was covered in wounds and blood. Yet he was still alive, sporting that infuriating smile on his face.

In Young Master Hai's hand was a dark red blood blade, exuding hissing hot air. His innate blood god blade had already taken shape. With this blade, Young Master Hai was confident he could break through to the fifth-grade realm and condense his golden core!

Behind him, the Demon Lord An Zhi opened his mouth and inhaled, pulling a strand of demonic energy from deep within the Blue Source Valley.

This time, the "Blood God Evil Blade Formation" was collaboratively "adapted" and executed by himself and Young Master Hai.

The entire Moon Blade Sect served as a sacrifice.

Young Master Hai obtained the blood god blade.

Meanwhile, he gained this strand of "Three Evil Demon Qi." This was one of the shared rewards from their collaboration.

Beside them stood a wild-haired man, his body riddled with wounds, both severe and minor, grimacing in pain.

He had taken on Sable Seven's strike of "Heavenly Blade Burial of Stars"!

As Sable Seven spotted this wild-haired man, his gaze ignited with fervor, and his right hand slowly rested on the hilt of his blade: "The Mad Overlord of the Void!"

The Void Demon Sect—Mad Overlord of the Void.

A cultivator at the fifth-grade golden core realm, he was incredibly powerful.

Disciples of the Void Demon Sect each had extreme personalities, taking unconventional paths to the extreme. The Mad Overlord was the only seemingly harmless one among them—at least as long as no one provoked him!

But ironically, he had a natural "provocation" aura, and anyone passing by might inexplicably feel annoyed at him, wanting to slap him or spit on him.

And then... there would be no "and then."

Due to this unique disposition, when he made his appearance a few days ago, the "Cultivator Daily" even reported on him, warning all cultivators to be cautious and not provoke the Mad Overlord for no reason.

"To take my strike of 'Heavenly Blade Burial of Stars' head-on, the Mad Overlord truly lives up to his reputation," Sable Seven tightened his grip on the hilt, a fiery battle intent igniting within him: "Since you’re stepping in for Young Master Hai, then let’s fight!"

Let’s fight, so I can have a good, hearty battle!

Sable Seven was practically ablaze with excitement.

"I’m just here to help Young Master Hai once, owing him a favor," the Mad Overlord grinned, revealing his teeth. That last strike of "Heavenly Blade Burial of Stars" had almost cost him his life to block!

"Enough talk, let’s fight," Sable Seven insisted.

—Young Master Hai? Has Young Master Hai already become a disciple of the Void Demon Sect?

"Today is not the right time for a fight; we both have our concerns. You need to protect those two little ones behind you, and I must protect Young Master Hai and a junior behind me," the Mad Overlord replied. "Let’s set a date to fight later."

Sable Seven frowned slightly.

……

……

As the two golden core titans exchanged words, Young Master Hai smiled as he extended his hand.

The blood god blade was merely one of the spoils from his grand array; now, the second great reward was finally arriving!

Four blood-red crystal-like orbs materialized out of thin air, slowly descending towards Young Master Hai.

The blood mist that enveloped the Blue Source Valley hadn’t really dissipated... it had transformed into these four blood-red crystals.

Now they had finally solidified.

If it weren't for these four precious "Blood God Crystals," he would have had the Mad Overlord carry him away long ago, rather than remain here to exchange pleasantries with Sable Seven!

As the four Blood God Crystals drifted down, Young Master Hai was about to reach out to collect them.

But at that moment, one of the Blood God Crystals suddenly paused in mid-air. Then, it changed direction as if attracted by a magnet, flying towards a certain spot in the Blue Source Valley.

There, a young man squatted suspiciously on the ground. In Young Master Hai's puzzled gaze, the Blood God Crystal landed directly into the palm of the young man.

Young Master Hai's smile abruptly froze. He widened his eyes, staring at the young man, unable to comprehend why the Blood God Crystal would willingly fly into his hand.

Moments later, a realization struck Young Master Hai.

He quickly calculated the position of the young man in relation to the location of a flaw in his "Blood God Evil Blade Formation!"

It was just like figuring out a complex math problem—once you knew the answer, it became easier to work through the calculations.

So that’s it; the young man was standing in a weak spot of his "Blood God Evil Blade Formation," effortlessly snatching away a huge chunk of what was almost in his grasp!

Clever, truly clever!

"One mountain is higher than another; I, Young Master Hai, am truly convinced!" To be able to spot that flaw in his modified "Blood God Evil Blade Formation" upon first seeing it, and to have been waiting there for the opportunity to take advantage of it—Young Master Hai admitted he had no such skills.

Thus, he was genuinely impressed.

"Hehe." Scholar Song smiled awkwardly, realizing the true prowess lay with the seniors in the Ninefold Land group behind him!

In the sky, Sable Seven observed the scene with great satisfaction. Though he didn’t fully understand what was happening, he knew Scholar Song had managed to snatch a treasure from Young Master Hai.

"Hahahaha." With a laugh, Sable Seven's aura became more imposing, subtly protecting Scholar Song.

Young Master Hai collected the remaining three Blood God Crystals and gracefully bowed towards Scholar Song: "May I ask your Immortal Name, friend?"

With Sable Seven present, there was no way this Blood God Crystal was getting back.

"You can call me 'Book Mountain Is Too Stressful!'" Scholar Song flashed a bright smile.

"Book Mountain Is Too Stressful? A Confucian practitioner? No wonder you have such insight." Young Master Hai smiled slightly: "In that case, this Blood God Crystal will temporarily rest in your hands, Book Mountain friend. In time, I shall come to visit and trade for it back."

At the same time, the Mad Overlord seized Young Master Hai and An Zhi, lifting them like an eagle grasping its chicks, ready to make a swift escape.

"Do you think you can just leave like this?" Sable Seven's blade slightly unsheathed, coldly addressing the Mad Overlord: "Others may fear your Void Demon Sect, but I, Sable Seven, do not. If you take Young Master Hai and leave without giving me a satisfactory explanation today, I will chop down ten of your Void Demon Sect’s branches in the future."

The Mad Overlord shrugged.

Young Master Hai spoke calmly: "That’s reasonable; it’s only natural for you to be angry with me, Brother Sable. So, I will give you those mere ten branches to let off some steam. Until we meet again."

"Until we meet again." The Mad Overlord carried them away swiftly.

Sable Seven sheathed his blade, refraining from pursuing them.

From the Mad Overlord’s attitude towards Young Master Hai, it was evident that their relationship was more than just "owing a favor." What status did Young Master Hai hold within the Void Demon Sect?

Yet regardless of the circumstances, this debt would not be easily settled!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

After a while, Sable Seven stepped through the air, landing beside Scholar Song as if stepping on stairs.

Scholar Song had a dark, long blade inserted at his waist, and in his right hand, he clutched a Blood God Crystal. However, his attention was not on these two treasures but rather on his heart aperture.

His heart aperture was beginning to feel slightly swollen—he estimated that with about ten more strands of vitality, he could open it!

The hundred-day foundation building was nearing completion!

Sable Seven patted Scholar Song's shoulder hard: "Well done, little friend Song. As a cultivator, you may lack in other areas, but you must never lack in courage."

Scholar Song snapped back to reality, flashing a grin, though he winced from the force of Sable Seven's pat.

"Ah Sixteen, this matter is settled for now. You must return with me to the Sable Clan at once!" Sable Seven called out to Ah Sixteen.

However, Ah Sixteen shook her head, striding deeper into the remnants of the Blue Source Valley.

The valley was in ruins.

The disciples of the Moon Blade Sect had their life energy and soul power drained, their bodies reduced to dry corpses lying on the ground.

All the weapons, elixirs, and other cultivator supplies within the valley had their spiritual energy sapped by that eerie formation, appearing as if they had endured the erosion of time, crumbling into piles of scrap metal and garbage with the slightest touch.

Ah Sixteen approached a room within the Blue Source Valley and kicked the door.

The door, already decayed from the corrosion of the "Blood God Evil Blade Formation," was flung open with her kick.

Inside the room, the uncle from the Immortal Farmer Sect, "Zheng De," looked dazed, appearing much older; his hair had turned gray under the influence of the formation.

Fortunately, the evil formation had not lasted too long… Otherwise, he would have ended up like the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect outside, becoming a dried corpse.

Upon seeing Ah Sixteen, he forced a bitter smile.

"Do you realize your mistakes?" Ah Sixteen asked, looking down at him.

Uncle Zheng broke down in tears.

Inside the valley, despite the noise from outside, he had heard everything clearly.

He knew it was all part of Young Master Hai's scheme.

He understood that the Moon Blade Sect had become a thing of the past.

He realized that the Immortal Farmer Sect had suffered heavy losses—his brothers' dying screams still echoed in his ears.

Sable Seven followed behind Ah Sixteen.

He sighed heavily: "Let’s take him away first."

He also bore some responsibility for the affairs of the Immortal Farmer Sect… As the situation concluded, he could not turn a blind eye to their plight.
