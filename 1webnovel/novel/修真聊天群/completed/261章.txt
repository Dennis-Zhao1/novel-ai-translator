**A Little Shrinking Bag (Seeking Monthly Tickets!)**

As Scholar Song rushed home, panting and out of breath, he was surprised to find Fay Yu and Mother Song deep in conversation, seemingly enjoying each other's company!

Their discussion revolved around topics from over twenty years ago, including the once-popular stars of the Middle Land, amusing old dramas, and the strange happenings across the country in recent years. They even shared some funny anecdotes from recent times.

Mother Song was astonished that this young girl knew so much about events from two or three decades ago. Could it be that she often spent time chatting with her elders? If that were the case, this girl truly was a filial child!

Meanwhile, Father Song and Zhao Yayao sat quietly in the background, unable to join the lively discussion.

"Ah, Scholar, you’re finally back! Where did you run off to? That little girl was waiting for you for ages!" Mother Song raised an eyebrow at Scholar Song, secretly giving him a thumbs up.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but laugh.

"Senior Song! Aren’t you surprised to see me?" Fay Yu stood up, giggling. "It’s a pity, though. If I had popped out of a delivery box, you would have been even more surprised!"

"I can only say, I’m extremely surprised," Scholar Song chuckled, waving at Fay Yu. "Mom, I’m going to take Fay Yu to my room to chat for a bit."

Mother Song instinctively replied, "Oh? Isn’t there a guest sleeping in your room? Why don’t you both chat in the living room instead?"

"It’s fine; Venerable White is also someone Fay knows," Scholar Song responded.

……

……

After Scholar Song left, Father Song stroked his chin thoughtfully. "What is the relationship between this girl and Scholar?"

"Who cares about the relationship? As long as she’s a girl, that’s good enough," Mother Song replied as she settled back into the sofa, a look of admiration on her face. "By the way, how did this little girl come out of a delivery box?"

"Probably wasn’t a delivery," Father Song speculated. "Did you see those people bringing in the boxes? They didn’t look like delivery personnel at all. She must have arranged for someone to bring her here to surprise Scholar. Hiding inside a box for delivery—kids these days sure know how to have fun."

"I think even today’s youth wouldn’t think of getting themselves shipped in a delivery box. But if I’m not mistaken, this girl must have visited Scholar’s school before the sports meet," Zhao Yayao said, sipping her Lingmai Green Tea comfortably.

Both Father Song and Mother Song’s eyes lit up at this.

They each took a sip of the Lingmai Green Tea, enjoying its comforting flavor.

Leading Fay Yu to his room, Scholar Song asked, "Fay, did you sneak out from Lingdie Island again?"

"I did not sneak out!" Fay Yu retorted vigorously. "I simply felt it would be too troublesome to find your house by the address, so I decided to come along with the delivery."

Scholar Song chuckled and asked, "So, does the Lingdie Elder know you’ve come out?"

"Haha, I didn’t tell him. But I’ve already fulfilled my contract with the Phantom Spirit and completed it synchronously, as per my agreement with my father. I can leave Lingdie Island anytime! So it’s not sneaking out," Fay Yu said proudly.

Scholar Song: "…" At the end of the day, she still snuck out.

"By the way, Senior Song, I heard that Venerable White is with you?" Fay Yu asked excitedly.

"Yes, he’s in my room in seclusion." Scholar Song opened the door, pointing to where Venerable White lay sleeping on the bed.

There was still over a day until Venerable White would finish his seclusion…

"Wow, so this is the legendary Venerable White," Fay Yu exclaimed, stepping into the room and examining Venerable White closely.

He looked like the most beautiful piece of art in the world, like a celestial being descended from the heavens, with long black hair cascading down and an irresistible charm that made one want to sit beside him and gaze at him forever.

"Be careful not to stare at Venerable White for too long," Scholar Song reminded her. According to the seniors in their group, Venerable White’s allure was not limited to just one gender, nor even to just one species.

"It’s okay; I’m prepared," Fay Yu said confidently, pointing to her eyes, which had lenses similar to contact lenses.

They must be some kind of special artifact.

"By the way, Senior Song, can you take a picture for me?" Fay Yu turned around, handing her phone to Scholar Song.

"A photo?" Scholar Song took the phone.

"Yes, let’s take a picture together!" Fay Yu slipped off her little sandals, revealing her cute toes, then climbed onto the bed beside Venerable White, posing with a victory sign.

Oh, she wanted a photo with Venerable White?

Speaking of photos with Venerable White—ugh, why did he suddenly recall the last time they went bungee jumping and the photo they took while plummeting from the sky? 

In that photo, he was screaming in terror, managing to smile awkwardly while looking utterly ridiculous, while Venerable White looked like a painting. The contrast was simply unbearable.

"What made you suddenly want a photo with Venerable White?" Scholar Song casually asked, adjusting the angle on Fay Yu’s phone as he took several shots of her with Venerable White.

He then handed the phone back to Fay Yu.

Fay Yu knelt by the bed and took her phone. "Hehehe, Senior Song, you don’t know? Venerable White is a rarity! Getting a photo with him is quite precious."

Venerable White, a rarity?

Scholar Song felt that Fay Yu’s choice of words was a bit off! Venerable White wasn’t a giant panda… Wait, that didn’t quite fit, either. Venerable White was much rarer than a panda! Oh dear, this was still wrong!

"Hehe, Venerable White really is handsome," Fay Yu said, operating her phone for a moment before posting the photos in the ‘Ninefold Land Group’ chat.

The photo’s caption read: [Visiting at Senior Song’s home today, taking a photo with the legendary Venerable White!]

Moments later, the seniors in the group began to chime in with likes.

The first reply came from the Hermit of North River: "Venerable White still looks like a painting, and Fay Yu is just as ethereal!"

The Wild Blade of Three Tides chimed in: "Now that’s the correct way to take a photo with Venerable White! This scene is simply a pair of blossoming flowers, truly pleasing to the eye. Last time, Scholar Song was bungee jumping with Venerable White—it was like a flower next to a green leaf, Scholar Song was merely there to accentuate Venerable White’s beauty!"

Scholar Song: "…"

Three Tides’ bluntness was astounding! No wonder so many seniors liked to invite him over for (teasing) visits; it wasn’t because they were narrow-minded, but because Three Tides really needed some (re)education!

Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram added: "I just went back to review the last photo of Scholar Song and Venerable White. After looking at this new photo, I suddenly feel that life is indeed beautiful."

Scholar Song: "…"

Since that last incident in front of the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, Master Diviner had been on a self-destructive path, and with his black hexagram attribute, Scholar Song believed that one day, Master Diviner would surpass Three Tides and become the top self-destructive expert in the Ninefold Land Group.

Lychee Fairy commented: "Did Scholar Song take this photo? The angle is great! Next time I have a chance, I want to visit you and take a photo with Venerable White too!"

After that, other group members chimed in with comments, mostly filled with compliments.

Once all the seniors had replied, The Alchemical Sage finally took his time to type a message, saying: "Scholar, you must hold yourself together. These are two revered beings!"

The Alchemical Sage’s reply left everyone a bit confused.

After reading his response, Scholar Song glanced back at the photos—indeed, as Lychee Fairy mentioned, the seemingly casual angle he chose for the photo turned out to be quite good. Should he save it?

While he pondered this, Fay Yu jumped off the bed and opened a small, stylish bag hanging at her waist.

Then, she reached inside and pulled out a long table!

"Whoa!" Scholar Song’s eyes widened in shock. This was the kind of scene that only appeared in anime like ‘Doraemon,’ yet it was happening right in front of him.

The impact of this visual was overwhelming! He was completely unprepared!

"A spatial treasure, a Qiankun bag?" Scholar Song asked cautiously—this was something the Alchemical Sage had said could only be acquired by spending one’s entire fortune, although the Alchemical Sage was referring to a spatial ring.

"It’s not a Qiankun bag; that kind of thing is too precious. My father said I’m not strong enough to casually carry one. This bag is much lower grade; look." Fay Yu explained with a smile, opening her small bag to show Scholar Song.

Inside, there were about ten items, each one scaled down like little toys.

"This is a small bag made from the shed skin of a spirit beast called the ‘One-Inch Snake.’ The skin of the One-Inch Snake has a natural ability to shrink whatever it touches. So, even though it’s only the size of my pinky, it can wrap around a large elephant and shrink it down to the size of a fingernail, swallowing it whole. However, the shrinking ability of the One-Inch Snake’s shed skin is quite limited; the most it can do is shrink a table down to the size of a matchbox, and it can’t shrink living creatures," Fay Yu explained.

"That’s not much different from a Qiankun bag!" Scholar Song exclaimed.

"There’s definitely a difference! Qiankun bags involve the principles of space and time. The items inside won’t spoil, and you don’t have to worry about them mixing together. My ‘Little Shrinking Bag’ can only shrink some items, and you have to be careful not to get them mixed up when you put them in," Fay Yu replied.

But for Scholar Song, it was already like a small spatial bag. He was impressed and curiously asked, "How powerful is this One-Inch Snake? Where can I find one?"

"The One-Inch Snake can appear anywhere; its footprints are all over the world. But… so far, very few people in the cultivation world have seen its true form. Only those lucky enough might find some of its shed skin," Fay Yu said.

As she spoke, she pulled out an incense burner and several sticks of incense from her little bag…
