**Chapter 1: The Unexpected Race**

“Uncle?” Zhao Yaya exclaimed, her voice tinged with disbelief.

**Vroom, vroom, vroom…**

The hand-pulled tractor belched out thick black smoke as it whipped around a corner, maintaining its speed effortlessly. 

“See that? Smooth turn, right? Even the drifting in movies can’t compare! This is real skill!” Old Lu boasted shamelessly, trying to mask the sweat forming in his palms. 

As he spoke, the front of the tractor straightened out, and its speed seemed to be increasing. 

Behind him, Lu Tianyou wiped his forehead discreetly. Based on the angle of the turn they had just taken, they must have been going at seventy or eighty miles an hour—maybe even faster!

This tractor had definitely been modified. 

But why on earth would Scholar Song go through the trouble of modifying a hand-pulled tractor? 

Or had the trend shifted from modifying luxury cars to tractors? 

Strangely enough, that could be true. There were rumors that in some corners of Middle Land, the wealthy had grown bored of their luxury cars and had taken to racing horse-drawn carriages instead!

“Hey, be careful, Old Lu! There seems to be some cars up ahead!” Father Song, his keen eyes catching sight of a few vehicles just beyond the corner, pointed out. 

Upon closer inspection, he realized there were three sports cars—one white, one blue, and one red.

And they were indeed sports cars!

The roar of their engines filled the air as they zoomed by, easily exceeding a hundred miles per hour on the long stretch of road ahead.

But what was bizarre was that their clunky tractor was steadily catching up to the trio of sports cars, slowly but surely decreasing the distance between them!

Lu Tianyou couldn't hold back any longer. “Are we going over a hundred miles per hour?”

“Stop talking nonsense! Have you ever seen a hand-pulled tractor hit a hundred miles an hour?” Old Lu scolded his son, disbelief clear in his voice. There was no way a tractor could reach that sort of speed!

But as he spoke, his voice trailed off. 

Because, at that moment, the hand-pulled tractor had just overtaken the last of the white sports cars!

**Vroom, vroom… thud, thud…**

The tractor belched a cloud of black smoke, its massive wheels spinning rapidly as it effortlessly outpaced the white sports car.

Old Lu’s jaw dropped in shock.

Inside the white sports car, the ponytailed girl, Xiao Mai Sui, gaped as well, her eyes wide as she glanced at her speedometer—120 miles per hour!

She blinked in disbelief, turning her gaze to the vehicle that had just zoomed past her.

Four huge wheels, making a strange thudding sound as they raced by. It was unmistakably a hand-pulled tractor, complete with a trailer!

Even more bizarrely, she could see a large stone the size of a dining table in the trailer, and seated next to it were a bear-sized man and a bespectacled middle-aged man.

“What the…?” Xiao Mai Sui was utterly confused.

What was happening?

A tractor carrying a giant stone had just overtaken her… and she was going 120 miles per hour! Was she imagining things?

“Arthur—Yaya! Am I losing my mind? I think I just saw a black-smoking hand-pulled tractor overtake me!” Xiao Mai Sui shouted into her headset.

While they were racing, the three friends were connected via headsets for easy communication, ensuring they could avoid any mishaps.

There was a long pause before Arthur, the girl in sunglasses from the red sports car, responded with a heavy tone, “I thought I was the only one hallucinating! Turns out you saw it too, Xiao Mai Sui. I saw it in my rearview mirror—a black-smoking hand-pulled tractor with a bear-like guy driving it. Ugh… I just got overtaken too!”

As Arthur spoke, the flashy tractor **vroomed** past her car.

At that moment, Arthur’s speed was around 125 miles per hour.

---

“That's two sports cars we've overtaken!” Father Song swallowed hard. If anyone still thought their tractor was only going thirty or forty miles per hour, they were delusional!

“If I’m not mistaken, Scholar Song modified this tractor, right?” Lu Tianyou said, his voice low.

“Impossible!” Old Lu replied loudly from the front. “You know how engines work! This kind of tractor can barely hit sixty miles per hour. Unless someone swapped its engine for a Ferrari! But you saw it too—this tractor has a hand-pulled engine!”

His father had a point. No matter how modified, the tractor's engine limited its speed! Lu Tianyou fell silent. 

But if that was the case, how could this hand-pulled tractor be racing at over a hundred miles per hour, easily overtaking the white and red sports cars behind?

Right now, their tractor was steadily closing in on the blue sports car ahead. At this rate, it seemed only a matter of time before they would overtake it as well.

Could it be that this tractor had some sort of hidden transformation ability, like the “Transformers” from movies, magically equipped with a “spark” that allowed it to morph?

---

At that moment, Zhao Yaya glanced through her rearview mirror at the “strange” hand-pulled tractor.

As they drew closer, she blinked hard.

Then, she gasped, “What the…!”

“Did you just get overtaken too, Yaya?” Xiao Mai Sui asked.

“Not yet, but it’s close!” Zhao Yaya replied, her mind racing. The real problem was who was behind the wheel!

She recognized that figure very well.

Wasn’t that Uncle Lu, who often visited Scholar Song’s family since she was little?

Even though she had been visiting Scholar Song less as she grew up, she still bumped into Uncle Lu regularly. 

She remembered how Uncle Lu and Father Song were true “frenemies,” mercilessly teasing each other without limits. 

Most friends would have broken off their relationships after such relentless jabbing, but clearly, Uncle Lu and Father Song were something else entirely. They could tease each other endlessly, yet their bond remained unbreakable.

What brand of tractor was Uncle Lu driving? The speed…

Zhao Yaya stole a glance at her own speedometer—140 miles per hour! That was her personal limit—any faster, and she wouldn’t dare to push it.

But Uncle Lu’s hand-pulled tractor was steadily closing in on her, maintaining a smooth pace. It had to be going over 150 miles per hour, right?

**Thud, thud…**

She was being overtaken… by Uncle Lu’s tractor!

What was happening in the world?

Then, Zhao Yaya noticed another person in the trailer of the tractor.

A young-looking man with glasses, his features delicate and youthful.

“Wait… Father Song!” Zhao Yaya gasped out loud.

“What?” her two friends echoed, puzzled.

“That hand-pulled tractor? The man with glasses in the back is someone I know!” Zhao Yaya’s lips twitched, torn between laughter and disbelief. “That’s my uncle, the father of the younger brother I mentioned, Scholar Song. And the man driving is Uncle Lu, his friend!”

“Ohhh, Scholar Song—the one you were thinking of introducing to Xiao Mai Sui as a potential boyfriend?” Arthur teased, a knowing smirk in her voice.

Xiao Mai Sui giggled, “Come on, he’s always had a crush on you, Arthur! We’ll just stick to our girl love.” 

“Pfft! Oh no, you little brat! I’m going for a harem of three thousand men; I don’t have time for any girl love with you!” the fashionable Arthur shot back.

“Hehehe, alright! Let’s speed up and catch that tractor! I’m really curious about it now.” Xiao Mai Sui chuckled. “Besides, there’s a U-turn up ahead; that tractor will definitely slow down! And Yaya, you must introduce us to your uncle and Uncle Lu!”

Arthur chimed in, “A hand-pulled tractor going over 150 miles per hour? I’ve never seen anything like it in my life!”

Zhao Yaya nodded silently. No matter what, she had to catch up to her uncle’s vehicle first!

---

Meanwhile, on the narrow road leading to Niuding Mountain, a figure was sprinting at full speed.

It was Scholar Song.

The hand-pulled tractor could go up to 150 miles per hour, and he was worried about his father and Uncle Lu driving recklessly after drinking—although Venerable White had placed a protective enchantment on the vehicle. Scholar Song wasn’t certain if that enchantment would protect everyone inside.

So, he hurriedly followed behind on foot.

Unfortunately, Lu Tianyou hadn’t left the car keys behind; if he had, Scholar Song could have driven to close the gap.

Strangely, not a single taxi had passed by on the way. What was going on?

In the end, Scholar Song had to rely on his own legs for the chase—he truly wished he could fly on a sword. At sword-flying speed, catching up would just take a moment!

With each stride, his body moved in sync with the “Gentleman’s Journey” technique, reaching its peak. The more he ran, the longer the distance he covered, and the deeper his understanding of this technique became, allowing his speed to increase.

Soon, he was darting like a shadow, his speed becoming almost comparable to that of a car.

At the same time, he formed a seal with his fingers, activating the “Mark Sensing Technique”!

In the tractor, there was a black suitcase. Inside that suitcase were money, elixirs, and the treasured blade, Ba Su. 

Scholar Song had previously left a “spiritual mark” on the blade using the technique transmitted by his third senior brother, allowing him to pinpoint its location and track his father and Uncle Lu’s coordinates.

“Looks like they’ve taken the road to Niuding Mountain? I remember that route is tricky to navigate,” Scholar Song chuckled to himself.

That road had plenty of U-shaped turns! 

The only slight comfort was that the road had been improved, with many protective measures in place, especially at the sharp curves, which were built wider.
