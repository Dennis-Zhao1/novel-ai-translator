**Caught Criminal**

The robber who had held up a delivery truck… was actually caught while sitting on the toilet!

At that moment, the robber was humming a tune, comfortably squatting in the bathroom of his rented apartment. Suddenly, a group of armed police officers burst through the door, swiftly surrounding the tiny restroom.

With such an overwhelming show of force and equipment, anyone unaware of the situation would think these officers were hunting down an international fugitive. No one would ever guess… they were here to capture a thief of delivery packages!

Outside the small bathroom window stood a few burly men dressed in sunglasses and black suits. Their expressions were stoic, exuding an aura of intimidation.

When the bathroom door swung open, the robber was still desperately trying to wipe himself.

“I say… Officer, what’s all this about?” The robber feigned calmness, giving off a strong vibe of a seasoned trickster.

“You are under arrest. Come with us; here’s the arrest warrant.” One of the officers replied coldly while pulling out handcuffs, then… looked at the robber’s still dirty hands with a hint of disgust.

“Arrest? Why? I haven’t done anything wrong!” The robber retorted stubbornly.

“Yesterday at noon, you intercepted a delivery truck, injured the delivery driver, and stole a package. Did you really think there were no cameras there to catch you?” The officer sneered.

If it were just an ordinary delivery truck with a package stolen, the police wouldn’t have deployed such a massive operation. But the package in question belonged to a local bigwig, a prominent figure who had both wealth and influence. You think you can just rob someone like that and get away with it?

“Cooperate with us and hand over what you took. It’ll make your time in jail a bit more bearable,” the officer stepped forward, signaling for the robber to extend his hands.

Instantly, the robber’s expression changed—he remembered the stolen package, and his heart ached.

He had come to the Jiangnan University Town area under orders from the higher-ups of the Moon Blade Sect to monitor a 'descendant of the Su Clan.' Such tedious tasks were typically assigned to outer disciples like him.

As an outer disciple, his skills weren’t particularly impressive, barely reaching the second threshold of the first realm.

To ensure he wouldn’t lose track of the Su descendant, the sect had provided him with a disposable talisman.

This talisman was a bright red paper talisman that could sense the aura of any magical artifact above the third rank within an 800-meter radius, lasting for a week.

In the Jiangnan University Town area, only the Su descendant was known to carry a third-rank magical artifact. So, he had been able to keep track of the Su descendant’s location thanks to this talisman.

However, just yesterday, while he was monitoring the Su descendant as usual, he suddenly sensed the aura of a third-rank magical artifact coming from a passing delivery truck!

His first thought was that the Su descendant must have brought another magical artifact and loaded it onto the delivery truck for a light journey.

So, he quickly followed the truck.

But after a while, he realized there was only a delivery man inside the truck—no sign of the Su descendant.

Just a regular delivery guy? But carrying a high-level magical artifact!

His heart began to race with temptation.

Wasn’t this a golden opportunity?

In an instant, he was filled with dark thoughts, waiting for the right moment to knock out the delivery driver with a swift strike and seize the magical artifact inside the package.

After tearing open the package, he was shocked to find it contained an 'Invisible Divine Sword'!

It was invisible to the naked eye, and even he couldn’t see it despite having opened his spiritual eye. If it weren’t for the talisman, he wouldn't even have sensed the artifact's presence!

Yet, he could touch it, and it was sharper than steel!

He was ecstatic.

But just then, his senior brother, who was also on the mission to monitor the Su descendant, showed up.

This senior brother was an elite inner disciple of the Moon Blade Sect. He had come to earn some merit, while the dirty work fell to the unfortunate outer disciples like himself, with most of the rewards going to the senior brother.

The senior brother fiercely reprimanded him for failing to keep an eye on the Su descendant.

Then… during the scolding, the senior brother noticed the object in his hand.

Before he knew it… the Invisible Divine Sword, still warm from his grasp, was snatched away by the senior brother, who declared he would present it to the sect leader!

If it weren’t for the senior brother’s second-rank prowess, he would have fought back!

He thought losing the Invisible Divine Sword was enough bad luck, but it didn’t end there. With the treasure taken from him, he was now left holding the bag for the robbery!

“I can’t let the police take me away. If I end up jailed without completing the mission the sect leader gave me, I could be stuck in there until my release!” He gritted his teeth in desperation.

And the stolen goods had been taken away; he had no idea how long he would be locked up for not being able to return what he took.

Thinking of this, he quickly pulled up his pants, spun around, and kicked towards the officer in front of him—if he could just knock the officer out, he might have a chance to squeeze through the stunned officers outside and escape!

After all, he was still a first-rank cultivator; the officer wouldn’t stand a chance against his kick, and he slammed into the wall.

“Assaulting an officer!” the downed officer yelled, clutching his chest as he fell.

Assaulting an officer was no laughing matter in Huaxia… if the situation escalated, they could shoot the criminal on the spot!

As the officer collapsed, the other officers quickly drew their weapons, aiming at the robber. Clearly, they were prepared and unfazed, possibly even anticipating the robber's actions!

The robber froze on the spot. He was just a cultivator with an opened spiritual eye, only slightly stronger than Scholar Song, who was still a novice. He had no invincibility against bullets; a barrage could easily turn him into a sieve!

With so many bullets aimed at him, were they planning to turn him into a colander?

So, he reluctantly raised his hands in surrender.

Next, he was handcuffed and taken to the police station, where he went through the motions of the process—name, identity, address, and so on.

He truthfully provided all his legal identity information.

Once everything was over, he was inexplicably loaded into a vehicle, not knowing where he was being taken.

In the car, he still dared not move.

He was tightly bound, wrapped up like a dumpling. Four men in black suits watched him with cold eyes, staring him down.

……

……

At Jiangnan Fourth People’s Hospital, in a patient’s room.

A bespectacled man in a suit received a phone call and then turned to the bedridden Sima Jiang, saying, “Mr. Sima, the robber has been caught. He’s already well on his way here.”

Opening his eyes from a meditative state, Sima Jiang nodded, “Keep a close watch on the road. We absolutely cannot let him escape!”

“We’ve already taken precautions against him. If he dares to run, we’ll break his legs,” the bespectacled man adjusted his glasses, speaking calmly.

“That’s good. I’ll make a call to… you all wait outside. When that guy arrives, come in and let me know,” Sima Jiang said in a deep voice.

“Understood.” The people in the room began to tidy up and gradually left the patient’s room.

Sima Jiang pulled out his phone, organizing his words in his mind before dialing Scholar Song’s number.

……

……

In the five-story building of the Alchemical Sage.

“Hello? Xiao Jiang? Need something?” Scholar Song replied weakly, looking rather miserable as he charged the magical artifact, the 'Three-Star Fire Fan.'

“Haha, classmate Shuohang. Sorry to bother you, but I have something to tell you,” Sima Jiang continued, “Yesterday, I got knocked out and robbed.”
