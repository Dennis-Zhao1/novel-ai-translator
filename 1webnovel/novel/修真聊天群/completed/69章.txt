You guys should have said that earlier; that’s just fantastic!

“Miao Xiao, there’s no need to rush. Go wash your face and calm down a bit before explaining. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself; you’re an excellent teacher, and the students in your class have a high opinion of your lessons,” Counselor Song advised gently.

“Thank you.” Miao Xiao wiped her tears and hurried out of the office.

“Sorry about that, Song,” Counselor Song began to smooth over the situation.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. Maybe my gaze was a bit too intimidating and scared her? As long as Miao Xiao is okay, let’s just let this go,” Scholar Song quickly replied, hoping this incident wouldn’t lead to the dismissal of that lovely teacher. If that happened, he would feel guilty for the rest of his life.

Seeing how considerate Scholar Song was, Counselor Song couldn't help but admire him: What a great student!

With Scholar Song’s words, the incident was brushed aside.

Counselor Song laughed lightly to change the topic. “I heard you signed up for the men’s 5000-meter run in the sports meet tomorrow, Scholar Song? Make sure to give it your all and bring glory to our class!”

Scholar Song’s mouth twitched; he hadn’t signed up for the 5000-meter run at all. But for now, he forced a smile, “Of course! I’ll do my best to get a good result.”

“Haha, the 5000 meters isn’t easy, so don’t push yourself too hard. I have faith in you. Now, head back to class. As for the misunderstanding with Miao Xiao, she’ll explain it to the students herself later. If she doesn’t, I’ll step in; I guarantee it won’t affect anything,” Counselor Song assured, patting his chest.

……

After leaving the office, Scholar Song let out a deep sigh of relief, feeling a wave of guilt wash over him.

If the opportunity arises, he definitely needs to make it up to Miao Xiao!

Back in class, Scholar Song no longer dared to experiment with ‘spiritual pressure’ or even try the ‘spiritual detective method.’ He could only practice the ‘alertness’ technique to keep his spiritual energy active.

In the classroom, Miao Xiao was a strong woman who stood by her word. Despite feeling embarrassed, she earnestly explained to all the students why she had lost her composure earlier.

With that, the matter was settled, and she continued teaching without letting her emotions spill into the lesson. Just on that alone, she was a qualified instructor.

The two classes in the morning passed without a hitch.

Meanwhile, Scholar Song’s three roommates had skipped both classes. Did they really drink that much yesterday?

He sighed in relief, noticing that while maintaining his spiritual energy alertness, his mind became much clearer. Even though he hadn’t focused on the lectures, the content Miao Xiao was teaching still flowed into his ears, allowing him to grasp and understand it.

Moreover, after a continuous practice of an hour and a half, his mastery of ‘alertness’ deepened, and he could maintain it for a longer duration. His overall spiritual energy capacity had even increased to some extent.

It seemed the alertness method was indeed a great boost for enhancing spiritual energy. Although the increase wasn’t significant, it wouldn’t stop him from continuously practicing this technique day in and day out!

“It’s already nine-thirty. I should go check on those three guys; hope they’re not dead drunk,” Scholar Song scratched his head, preparing to head to Li Yangde's rental to see if his three roommates were still alive.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On the way to the Yangde rental, he alternated using the three techniques of spiritual energy and tried to combine the ‘alertness’ and ‘spiritual detective method’ together.

Unfortunately, due to his low spiritual energy capacity, he kept failing.

But he remained undeterred, continuously trying and accumulating experience from his failures.

After yet another failure, he rubbed his temples, stopping the experiment since his spirit felt utterly exhausted.

“My spiritual energy capacity is too weak. I can still practice ‘True Self Meditation’ once or twice today; I need to save opportunities for my evening basic boxing training,” he thought to himself.

While ‘True Self Meditation’ didn’t have as strict physical requirements as ‘Basic Diamond Fist,’ it was still influenced by his overall physical condition. He had to be cautious during the practice, as over-exerting himself could lead to losing his wits.

Due to his fatigue, Scholar Song didn’t notice the pedestrian in front of him and bumped right into the person’s back.

It was a broad back, indicating that the person was over a head taller than Scholar Song.

Having undergone body tempering, Scholar Song was now a powerhouse among ordinary humans, capable of pulling freight trains with ease. When he collided with the person, they tumbled to the ground face-first, emitting a cry of distress.

“Ah? I’m so sorry! I wasn’t paying attention!” Scholar Song exclaimed, frantically apologizing.

He looked at the person he had bumped into… Oh, it was a delinquent sporting a distinctive Jiangnan style.

The fallen delinquent, who was now on the ground, had a tall figure and long hair styled into a rooster comb with rainbow colors, likely due to frequent brawls, which made him fit enough to bounce back up quickly, albeit with a dirty face and a mouthful of blood.

“You little punk, are you blind?!” the rooster-headed delinquent shouted angrily, blood and saliva spraying as he spoke.

With his furious roar, five other delinquents surrounding him grinned menacingly, closing in on Scholar Song.

Uh-oh, looks like I’m in trouble. Scholar Song felt quite embarrassed and sincerely apologized, “Um, I’m really sorry. I was deep in thought and didn’t see you there. I’m truly sorry.”

“Sorry? If apologies worked, we wouldn’t need the police!” the rooster-headed delinquent shouted, wiping his blood and grabbing Scholar Song by the collar.

Since he was at fault for bumping into the guy first, Scholar Song felt bad. “You make a good point. How about we calm down and talk about how to resolve this?”

“Good, you’re smart.” The rooster-headed delinquent grinned, “You knocked me down so badly; you should at least cough up a thousand or eighteen hundred as compensation, right? Don’t tell me you can’t even scrape together that much. It’s still the beginning of the month; you shouldn’t be out of living expenses.”

“Well, my living expenses are paid yearly, so you don’t need to worry about whether it's the start or end of the month,” Scholar Song replied honestly.

The rooster-headed delinquent’s heart leaped with joy; a rare find of an ‘easy prey’—this was going to be a good haul!

“But you guys are extorting me; I won’t pay that much. How about we find another way to settle this?” Scholar Song said earnestly, his sincere eyes betraying no intent to mock.

“Finding another way to settle it? Hahaha.” The rooster-headed delinquent laughed in anger, “Alright then, let’s have a good chat with our fists and then discuss money afterward.”

The four delinquents around him laughed menacingly, cracking their knuckles in anticipation.

“Talking with our fists? So we can solve this with a fight?” Scholar Song smiled genuinely at their words. “You should have said that earlier; that’s just fantastic!”

Scholar Song’s smile was sincere – he had found perfect sparring partners for practicing his boxing techniques! There were plenty of delinquents around Jiangnan University City, providing him with ample opportunities for real combat practice. Even if he could only learn a few moves from each group, it would be worth it.

Seeing Scholar Song’s genuine smile, the rooster-headed delinquent suddenly realized that this guy might be a fool.

“Crap, turns out he’s a nutcase.”

Ugh, whatever. Just beat him up to vent some frustration.

……

Two minutes later.

Slap! Scholar Song landed a few punches on the fallen rooster-headed delinquent, who was now on the ground crying out in agony.

While the other delinquents lay sprawled on the ground, their eyes filled with disbelief, Scholar Song dusted himself off, nodding in satisfaction. “Thanks for your hard work, everyone. You performed well. Although your punches lacked technique, the reckless charge was quite impressive. I hope you all train more in the future and strive to become stronger.”

Scholar Song had used only about thirty percent of his strength, mainly to practice his moves. In those two minutes, he had thoroughly tested all eighteen techniques of ‘Basic Diamond Fist’ and felt he had gained a lot. Indeed, practical experience was the best way to test theory.

The only regret was that the delinquents were too weak to provide a satisfying challenge. But that was alright; there were plenty of delinquents near Jiangnan University City. If the quality wasn’t enough, he would just rely on quantity!
