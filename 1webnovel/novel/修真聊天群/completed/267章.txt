**Masked Thief? Assassin?**

**3:30 PM.**

Fay Yu said her goodbyes to Mother Song, getting ready to leave for her friend’s family estate.

Mother Song, feeling reluctant, said, “Come visit often, Fay Yu!”

Scholar Song was pushed out the door to see Fay Yu off.

...

...

Once downstairs, Scholar Song asked, “Fay Yu, how are you planning to get to your friend’s estate?”

He recalled that Fay Yu still couldn't fly on a sword. So, was she taking a bus or perhaps a plane?

“I’m taking the bullet train! There’s a stop that goes directly to the town near her family estate. Then it's just a short walk to get there!” Fay Yu giggled. “Don’t worry, Senior, I’ve learned how to buy tickets for the bullet train, so I won’t mess it up!”

“Then let me take you to the train station,” Scholar Song offered, since it was a bit of a distance.

“Sure!” Fay Yu nodded eagerly.

“Hmm... let’s ride the electric scooter?” Scholar Song suggested sheepishly.

Father Song had taken the family car to work, and the only vehicle he had driven over was the tractor—now that was a wreck! Even if the hand-pulled tractor was still in one piece, he definitely didn’t want to use that thing to take Fay Yu to the train station.

“Electric scooter? I know how to ride those!” Fay Yu exclaimed excitedly.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but feel that Fay Yu not only had a low threshold for laughter but also a low threshold for happiness. A girl like her must be living life to the fullest, always in a good mood.

A moment later, as Scholar Song rolled out the electric scooter, Fay Yu eagerly asked, “Senior, can I drive it?”

“Alright, just wear a helmet. The police are strict about helmet use on the way to the train station. If you don’t wear one, they’ll give you a hard time,” he replied, handing her the safety helmet.

Speaking of which... Fay Yu wouldn’t be one of those who added ‘acceleration spells’ to the scooter like Venerable White, would she?

After putting on the helmet, Fay Yu took the front seat. Her long legs made her look striking as she sat on the small scooter.

Scholar Song had intended to sit behind her like usual but found himself sighing and opting to sit sideways instead, like a girl. After all, some things just couldn't be controlled by willpower.

...

...

Fay Yu drove the scooter without adding any spells like ‘acceleration.’ She was simply happy riding along. In Lingdie Island, while there were various vehicles, she could only ride around the island. Nothing could compare to zooming down the open road!

Unfortunately, as fate would have it, the scooter was underwhelming.

Halfway through the ride, the electric scooter began to slow down, showing signs of low power.

“Eh? What’s going on, Senior?” Fay Yu looked puzzled as she twisted the throttle to the max with no effect.

“Is it out of battery?” Scholar Song leaned in to check and confirmed it indeed was.

Maybe Mother Song had taken it out for a spin and forgotten to charge it—Mother Song didn’t drive; she had failed her driving test three times in a row and had given up out of frustration.

“It’s out of power? What do we do?” Fay Yu asked worriedly, her enthusiasm fading just as she was enjoying driving.

“Don’t worry!” Scholar Song thought of a small spell and declared, “I have a charging spell!”

While the charging spell was primarily for phones and laptops, it should work for the scooter too. He just wasn’t sure how many casts it would take to fully charge it.

...

...

The answer was—thirty casts!

Normally, one cast of the charging spell could fully charge a phone, leaving plenty of power left over. Charging a phone or laptop only required one cast.

The ‘charging spell’ consumed very little vitality, but after thirty casts, Scholar Song’s face turned pale. Had he not just opened his nasal passages, he would have had to rely on the reserve energy from the Phantom Spirit.

“You can use a charging spell? That spell was shared in the group by the Wild Blade of Three Tides ages ago. I took a look and thought it seemed a bit complicated, so I didn’t learn it,” Fay Yu said, sticking out her tongue. “It’s fully charged now, Senior! Let’s continue!”

“Let’s go!” Scholar Song said, taking a deep breath and getting back on.

The scooter roared back to life, its power restored.

Fay Yu’s tinkling laughter echoed once more.

As they rode, Scholar Song couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off—fully charged?

Damn it, why did he charge it all the way? He only needed to charge it about halfway to make the round trip!

What was wrong with him today?

Upon arriving at the train station, Scholar Song accompanied Fay Yu as she bought her bullet train ticket, watching her enter the waiting room before leaving with a sense of relief.

...

...

At dinner time, Scholar Song continued to play dual roles; he first finished his meal alone, then changed into Venerable White’s appearance before coming out to eat again.

He temporarily borrowed the brooch from Fay Yu that allowed for simple transformations. Thankfully, after his training, his appetite had significantly increased; otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to finish two large bowls of rice.

However, that night, Mother Song kept giving Venerable White strange looks. Did she suspect something?

Luckily, after tomorrow, Venerable White would awaken, and they could have dinner together. Mother Song wouldn’t suspect anything then. Scholar Song thought to himself.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

**Lingdie Island.**

Lingdie Venerable sipped his cup of spirit tea made by his daughter. Although the tea had some minor issues, being a cultivation master, it didn’t affect him. He would simply deal with the little imperfections quietly.

At that moment, a colorful butterfly landed in front of Lingdie Venerable and transformed into a girl dressed in colorful clothing. This was a butterfly demon that had gained the ability to take human form and condensed a demon core.

The colorful-clad girl smiled and said, “Master, the eldest senior brother called. The junior sister has left Scholar Song’s home and has successfully boarded the bullet train.”

“Oh, she’s already left. Understood. Have Jian Yi continue to protect Fay Yu in secret,” Lingdie Venerable nodded calmly—then silently returned his sword to its sheath.

If his beloved daughter was going to spend the night at a man’s house… heh heh heh!

The colorful-clad girl clearly caught sight of her master’s sword and twitched her mouth.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Night fell.

Scholar Song held the ‘Insight Stone’ in his hand, closing his eyes in meditation to cultivate his mental strength.

On the Insight Stone, Mistress Scallion had already taken root, the tender sprout glistening with fresh green, pleasing to the eye.

Scholar Song still wanted to get the ‘Lion’s Roar’ technique scroll from Mistress Scallion—after all, this little demoness had tried to steal his Insight Stone. After her failed attempt, she would naturally have to face the consequences!

However… Mistress Scallion seemed either unable or unwilling to speak. Ever since she took root on the Insight Stone, no matter how Scholar Song asked, she would only shake her scallion body and remain silent.

Could it be that she had lost all her cultivation and become an ordinary scallion spirit?

As the night deepened, the world fell silent.

Scholar Song could feel the strange energy within the Insight Stone continuously entering his body, gradually weakening the bottleneck in his ear passages.

Just a few more days of cultivation, and once his vitality filled the ear passage, he would be able to break through more easily.

Moreover… Scholar Song could feel his mental strength also being influenced by this strange energy.

This energy didn’t merge with his mental strength but merely served to ‘stimulate’ it, making it stronger and purer.

“The effect of the Insight Stone is even more powerful than Venerable White described. At this rate, it won’t be long before I can challenge the last passage, the ‘Mouth Passage.’ Once that opens, I’ll be ready to leap over the dragon’s gate,” Scholar Song slowly opened his eyes, sighing in amazement.

As he opened his eyes, he caught sight of a masked figure sneaking through his window!

Scholar Song’s gaze locked onto the intruder.

A thief?

How brazen! The audacity to push the window open while he was still sitting here, clearly awake! Did this thief think he was invisible?!

He needed to teach this intruder a lesson.

Scholar Song stashed the ‘Insight Stone’ and activated the ‘Gentleman’s Journey’ technique, his body darting like lightning toward the masked figure. His right hand clawed out like a dragon’s claw, aimed directly at the intruder’s shoulder.

“Damn it,” the intruder cursed under their breath but showed no panic. Instead, they formed their palm into a sword and thrust it toward Scholar Song’s hand claw.

In an instant, Scholar Song’s eyes narrowed—this wasn’t just an ordinary thief.

At the moment the intruder formed their palm, a surge of qi surged between their hands—a cultivator!

Cloud Mist Daoist?

Scholar Song’s mind immediately recalled the Golden Core Spirit Emperor from the Empty Thief Sect.

However, there was no time to think further. Scholar Song executed the ‘Gentleman’s Journey’ technique to its fullest, his right claw twisting at an odd angle, diving straight for the intruder’s throat.

“You’re skilled, kid, but… too slow!” the masked figure’s voice was raspy, clearly disguised.

With that, their palm suddenly shot forward with astonishing speed.

The trajectory of the thrust didn’t change, but at that moment, it accelerated to the limit, making Scholar Song’s change in tactics feel futile—because just as he started to change his move, the intruder’s sword palm had already reached him!

“Shield!” Scholar Song called calmly.

He activated the Phantom Spirit’s innate ability, summoning a small golden shield that appeared before him, right in the path of the intruder’s sword palm!

While not as strong as a ‘Armor Talisman,’ this small golden shield was sufficient to withstand most attacks from second-grade cultivators!

At the same time, Scholar Song’s other hand reached for his pocket.

He still had one last sword talisman left!

Clang! The intruder’s sword palm collided with the golden shield, producing a sound like metal striking metal.

“Charge!” the masked figure shouted, and a white sword light erupted from their palm.

True Qi!

This was at least a second-grade cultivator.

Crack! 

The golden shield cracked, and a powerful force slammed into Scholar Song, sending him flying backward.

Scholar Song’s body tumbled toward the bed where Venerable White lay.

The masked figure, having succeeded with their strike, closed in relentlessly, their body moving like lightning, launching another sword palm aimed directly at Scholar Song’s body…
