**The Little Monk: I'm Going to Make Money for Hemorrhoid Surgery!**

Anthony, with his graying hair, slowly regained consciousness from his stupor... He felt as if he were in a very bumpy place, reminiscent of a long time ago when he had ridden a tractor—jolting and uncomfortable.

“Damn it, can’t anyone let me sleep peacefully?” he muttered, then he slowly opened his eyes.

Bright! So bright! Blindingly bright!

As he opened his eyes, he found himself surrounded by an expanse of white light. It was an all-encompassing brightness, illuminating every corner as if he were under a surgical light, not a shadow in sight!

He could vaguely make out that he was on a large ship. But if it was a big ship, then why could he see white clouds floating by at the edges?

At that moment, a gentle voice sounded beside him: “Child, you’re awake.”

Child? I’m over forty, almost fifty! How can you still call me a child? Anthony's lips twitched, and he turned to look at the owner of that gentle voice.

At a glance, he almost wet himself.

Before him stood a figure as flawless as jade, glowing with a pure white light radiating from its body. Behind it, three pairs of wings fluttered slowly, accentuating its holy and untouchable presence.

T-T-This… an angel? Anthony's mouth gaped open in shock.

Why am I seeing an angel?

Could it be… I’m dead? No way, that can’t be right! I shouldn’t just die like this!

“Excuse me, where is this place?” Anthony asked, his voice cracking as panic set in. He was still so young; there were many experiments he wanted to try, many dreams he had yet to fulfill. He felt he could still be saved!

“Don’t panic, don’t be afraid. Child, you are in heaven.” The six-winged angel wore a compassionate smile, its voice soft, providing immense comfort.

However, no matter how gentle that smile was, it couldn’t ease Anthony’s despair.

Heaven? So I really am dead? His eyes rolled back, and he fainted once more…

“Venerable White, you shouldn’t scare him like that; what if you frighten him to death? We still need him to exchange for Instructor Li!” At this moment, a figure draped in black appeared beside the six-winged angel, laughing softly.

“Stop saying such nonsense; I never scared him! Besides, the name of this ship is ‘Heaven,’ so I’m not lying to him,” the six-winged angel replied, still maintaining a gentle tone. Then, it swayed lightly, and the holy light enveloping it receded, revealing its true form.

It was a gigantic white crane, completely pure white, with three wings on each side. This was its true form; the six-winged angel was merely a manifestation of its human shape.

Interestingly, it looked just like the angels depicted in Western legends. Perhaps because of its human appearance, it had gained quite a good standing in the Western world.

This White Crane Immortal was a close friend of the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

Instructor Li had been taken away by the FBI or a similar agency, and with the help of this White Crane Immortal, it would be easy to exchange Anthony for Instructor Li.

In fact, it would be simple for the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain to send someone to rescue Instructor Li directly—but that would lead to unnecessary trouble.

Well… actually, the above statements were all excuses!

In truth, the White Crane Immortal had once received immense kindness from Venerable White, a life-saving grace. Whenever Venerable White needed help, it was always the first to jump up and lend a hand.

However, there was a big problem here. The White Crane Immortal was currently unwilling or perhaps too scared to meet Venerable White—rumor had it that after it received great kindness from Venerable White, it had been at Venerable White’s side, serving faithfully for about two months.

Then one day, it made a grave mistake; it proposed to Venerable White.

Yes, proposed… and we all know what happened next.

That was the most painful yet sweetest memory of the White Crane Immortal’s life. Even now, it still dared not face Venerable White.

But it desperately wanted to help Venerable White, even if it was just a small matter; wherever it could lend a hand, it wanted to assist.

Thus, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain entrusted this ‘rescue Instructor Li’ mission to it.

After all, Instructor Li was in that predicament because of Venerable White; rescuing him would be equivalent to helping Venerable White.

Moreover, once the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain entrusted this task to the White Crane Immortal, not only would it help, but it would also owe the Immortal Sage a favor!

Getting someone to help you while simultaneously making them owe you a favor—who wouldn’t want such a sweet deal?

…

“By the way, Venerable White has come out of seclusion again, right? Who’s responsible for reintroducing him to the new era?” The White Crane Immortal asked the figure in black beside it.

This figure cloaked in black was an underling of the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

Known in the cultivation world as ‘Hidden Heaven Hook’ Zhou Li, his job was to handle various troubles for Dou Dou, perfectly cleaning up after him. The Immortal Sage had a whole team of subordinates like him.

“Uh-huh, Venerable White has been out of seclusion for some time now. However, this time, it’s a newcomer responsible for taking care of Venerable White,” Zhou Li replied.

“A newcomer? Tsk tsk, it seems the people in the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain’s group have become old slickers, unwilling to attend to Venerable White, huh? A bunch of spineless fellows!” The White Crane Immortal scoffed.

Zhou Li: “…”

You are the last person qualified to talk about the willpower of the Immortal Sage’s group; at least they haven’t done anything as shameless as proposing!

“Well then, I bet that newcomer has already succumbed to Venerable White’s charm, right?” The White Crane Immortal asked, confident that anyone under Venerable White’s allure, regardless of gender or species, would be unable to resist.

Zhou Li thought for a moment before replying, “How should I put this… I’ve heard the Immortal Sage mention that while the newcomer has been affected by Venerable White’s charm, they are still maintaining a normal friendship.”

“What? Maintaining a normal friendship? Is the newcomer male or female? Human or monster?” The White Crane Immortal asked urgently.

“Human, male,” Zhou Li answered.

“Male? Is this guy gay? He can withstand Venerable White’s charm!” The White Crane Immortal exclaimed in surprise.

Zhou Li: “…”

Venerable White, you’ve got it all wrong; it’s the opposite! It’s precisely because the young friend named Song Shuhang has a perfectly normal orientation that he can resist Venerable White’s charm!

By the way, the White Crane Immortal isn’t even gay.

Its race is quite special, inherited from ancient divine beast bloodlines. They don’t have a fixed gender or distinction between yin and yang when they hatch from their eggs.

Only when they find their true love and establish a special contract similar to marriage do they evolve into a corresponding gender based on their partner’s sex.

In summary, it’s a high-class yet shameless race. Before marriage, they can pursue whichever sex they want, truly embodying the freedom of love.

“Tsk tsk, it seems after I get Instructor Li back, I need to meet this newcomer,” the White Crane Immortal pondered, resting its wings under its chin in thought.

It’s essential to educate this newcomer properly, so they understand the charm and beauty of Venerable White.

In this world, there must not be any creatures that do not love Venerable White! Any creature that does not love Venerable White is a mistake of the world.

The newcomer’s misguided worldview would be corrected by the White Crane Immortal personally!

A fierce determination sparked in the eyes of the White Crane Immortal.

Meanwhile, in the Jiangnan region.

Over an hour ago, Song Shuhang, along with Venerable White, was hovering over the Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center with Dou Dou, waiting for quite a while. Finally, the professionals sent by the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain arrived to deal with the aftermath.

Song Shuhang handed Anthony over to this team of professionals and informed them of the ‘plane crash’ location.

After that, the 'Peking Dog Flying Incident,' the 'Plane Crash Incident,' and the 'Instructor Li Becoming an Astronaut Incident' could all be entrusted to this professional team to handle.

Once everything was settled, Shuhang returned home with Venerable White and Dou Dou to the Alchemical Sage’s building.

As soon as he entered, Song Shuhang called out, “Guo Guo!”

—To be honest, he felt a bit guilty; he had told the little monk to stay home and not run around, to keep an eye on the house. Yet he and Venerable White had rushed into the universe, and in all that commotion, he hadn’t even prepared lunch for the little monk.

He wondered if Guo Guo was hungry.

After calling twice, there was no response from the room.

“Strange, why is there no answer? Did he fall asleep?” Song Shuhang wondered.

He searched around the entire building but still didn’t see the little monk Guo Guo’s figure.

“Where has that little rascal run off to?” Song Shuhang gritted his teeth.

“Shuhang, come look at this,” Venerable White pointed to the dining table on the third floor, where there was a book that Song Shuhang had rented from the bookstore but hadn’t returned yet.

As he leaned over to take a look, he discovered two large characters written on the cover.

The first note read: “Brother Shuhang, I’m going to make money. Don’t worry about me.”

The second note read: “P.S.: I found out this morning that hemorrhoid surgery costs between three thousand to five thousand yuan, and if I need to be hospitalized, it’s even more expensive! When I left, I only brought one thousand and thirty-two yuan and sixty cents, which is still far from the surgery cost. So, Brother Shuhang, I’m going to make money and will be back soon!”

“Ahhh!” Song Shuhang clenched his fists: “This little brat is seriously trying to drive me crazy, isn’t he? I told you to stay home and look after the place, but you went out running around, treating my words like wind! And that P.S. nonsense—what the hell! When I catch you, regardless of whether you have hemorrhoids or not, I’ll make sure you regret it!”

Dou Dou quietly shrank back, realizing that today, Song Shuhang was in a particularly foul mood!
