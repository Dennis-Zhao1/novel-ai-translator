Chapter 1: The Race Begins!

“Grab the clue and let’s move out!”

The men’s 5000-meter race was divided into three heats, with participants grouped accordingly. Jiangnan University had many departments, and each class was required to have at least one representative in the competition. With three heats, it would take nearly ten rounds to complete the entire event.

Ranking was based on the athletes' performance, and there was no preliminary round. A preliminary round meant someone might collapse from exhaustion.

Based on previous experiences, each heat would take about twenty to thirty minutes, meaning the entire men’s 5000-meter race could be wrapped up in four to five hours.

However, there were always oddballs, and this year was no exception.

First, there were Scholar Song and the dark-skinned student, who sprinted through the course (though the latter was still a few steps behind). Then, another oddity appeared—Yang Shangfa, the chubby guy who had started off with Scholar Song, both lamenting about being down on their luck.

Yang started off at a leisurely jog, comfortably lagging at the back of the 5000-meter runners.

After about three laps, he was already struggling, his face pale. He transitioned from jogging to a brisk walk, then to a slow shuffle, and finally to a snail's pace.

After moving a short distance, he would stop to clutch his waist and catch his breath.

With such stamina, one had to wonder what his classmates were thinking when they sent him to the 5000-meter race.

Twenty-five minutes later, the other competitors had already crossed the finish line, while Yang Shangfa was still shuffling along, alternating between walking and stopping. By this point, he had only managed to cover a total of 2100 meters, looking as if he could collapse and be rushed to the hospital at any moment.

The judge watching him could hardly bear to watch any longer. “Student, it’s okay to stop now. You don’t have to finish the race. Just reaching this point shows incredible perseverance!”

However, Yang Shangfa replied, “Teacher, I’m a man who believes in finishing what I start. I will complete this 5000 meters, even if I have to crawl to the finish line!”

Once he set his mind to something, he was as stubborn as a mule, refusing to budge no matter how others tried to persuade him.

The judge’s eyes began to water—what a stubborn kid! Doesn’t he consider the circumstances? There were still nine rounds of races to go; how long would he take to finish at this rate?

In the end, how long did Yang Shangfa take? The answer was a full hour! Adding the previous twenty-one minutes, he took one hour and twenty-one minutes to finish. Meanwhile, the fourth round of races was already underway in the other lanes.

The judge was truly in tears.

After finishing the race, Scholar Song was caught up in a chaotic celebration from his friends.

“Scholar, I can’t believe how fast you ran! We’ve definitely got the 5000-meter championship in the bag!” someone patted him hard on the back.

“I’m curious, did those pretty girls cheering really make such a difference? You and that dark-skinned guy were practically sprinting!” 

“Of course, pretty girls work wonders! That’s why all major international competitions have cheerleaders!” 

Scholar Song smiled wryly, enduring the barrage of punches and pats from his friends.

After a while, Li Yangde pulled him aside.

“The pharmacy you asked me to check has news,” Yangde said with a grin, handing him addresses for four pharmacies. “Each of these pharmacies has some of the medicinal herbs your friend needs. This one, ‘Yuanlong Herb Shop’, has the most complete stock. They just sold a batch of the four herbs yesterday. Apparently, the buyer even reserved a larger quantity, and the shopkeeper is preparing to restock. If your friend needs them urgently, you should reserve them now to coincide with the restock.”

“Thanks, Yangde.” Scholar Song took the addresses and focused on the one for Yuanlong Herb Shop. They had just sold some and had a reservation for a larger order.

These four rare herbs were rarely used, and even when they were, only one or two were typically needed.

But now, all four were necessary, and the majority of the required quantity—over seventy percent—was for that mysterious shopkeeper.

Clue acquired!

“No need to mention it. Remember, after the sports meet, we’re going for the ten-flavored fish head!” Li Yangde’s mouth watered at the thought of that fish head restaurant.

“Count on me; I’ll make sure you’re satisfied. Yangde, I need to contact the pharmacy’s owner right away. No, I should probably visit the shop in person. If I don’t come back tonight, don’t wait for me.” Scholar Song smiled.

“Is it really that urgent?” Li Yangde waved his hand, laughing. “Just be quick.”

Scholar Song waved goodbye to Tu Bo and the others, pocketed the addresses, and dashed away from the sports meet, not even bothering to stay for the awards ceremony.

Li Yangde scratched his head, “Is he really that good of a friend? Why the rush?”

……

……

Not long after Scholar Song left, Lu Fei and a few girls approached Tu Bo and the others.

She scanned the boys but didn’t see Scholar Song, and asked curiously, “Hey, where’s Scholar Song?”

“He had something urgent to attend to. Did you need to find him for something, Lu Fei?” Tu Bo leaned in, his expression serious.

“Not really. I just wanted to congratulate him. Although the final scores aren’t out yet, I’m sure Scholar Song will win the 5000-meter race.” Lu Fei smiled brightly.

As she spoke, she waved her soft white hand—man, it was so hot! The sun was especially intense today. She longed for the feeling of cooling off next to Scholar Song; it was a hundred times better than air conditioning!

So, at least during this scorching summer, she had to find a way to stay close to Scholar Song. They could break up during winter, right?

“Scholar Song is gone already. But I think he’d be really happy to hear your congratulations, Lu Fei,” Gao said, adjusting his glasses. “Also, Scholar Song mentioned that after the sports meet, he’d treat everyone to ten-flavored fish head. Lu Fei, are you free to join?”

Li Yangde silently gave Gao a thumbs up: Gao, you’re doing great!

“Wait, can I go too?” Lu Fei asked with surprise, a bright smile spreading across her face. “Sure! Just let me know when, and I’ll definitely be there!”

“Then it’s settled.” Gao adjusted his glasses—Scholar, I can only help you this far.

Scholar Song first returned to his dorm, carefully taking out the black iron sword belonging to Master Tongxuan. To others, this sword appeared formless and insubstantial, perfect for stealth attacks. He might need it this time.

Then, he grabbed a small vial of body-enhancing liquid and a single-use pill called “Hidden Valley Pill.”

The body-enhancing liquid could be used for training and could restore stamina in critical situations. The Hidden Valley Pill provided essential nutrients for survival at any time.

After packing these, he carefully grabbed a baton-sized gadget that Tu Bo had modified. He wasn’t sure how effective it would be, but having it would definitely give him a sense of security.

Finally, he made sure to take the talisman treasures that the Seven Lives Talisman Master had supported him with. These twenty talisman treasures were like a stabilizing anchor for Scholar Song, ensuring he could remain calm when facing the mysterious “shopkeeper.”

The purpose of this outing was to track the whereabouts of the shopkeeper and determine their position.

If the shopkeeper was indeed in a poor state, he could seize the opportunity to eliminate the threat.

With the talismans from the Seven Lives Talisman Master, even if he failed, he could at least ensure his own safety.

If things went south, he would have to use “Phantom Spirit” as a bargaining chip and enlist the help of seniors from the group. In any case, he had to deal with the shopkeeper and his gang!

No matter what, he had already ensured he couldn’t be defeated. Since he was already in a position of strength, he would strive for a decisive victory!
