**Scattered Cultivators and Sect Disciples**

“An induction cooker? You mean the kind used for cooking, not an alchemical furnace, right?” The Hermit of North River felt his blood pressure rising a bit.

Scholar Song replied sheepishly, “Yeah, that’s right.”

“Haha, you really are something, Senior Song,” Fay Yu chimed in.

“Then what about your alchemical furnace? What do you use?” the Hermit pressed on.

“Well, if I had to say, I guess it would be a hot pot,” Scholar Song felt a bit embarrassed. The whole vibe clashed with the traditional cultivation style, and he couldn’t help but feel awkward.

“A hot pot? What model of alchemical furnace is that? Wait... let me calm down first. Please don’t tell me that hot pot is the kind you use to eat hot pot, right?” The Hermit of North River typed furiously.

“Yep, that’s the one,” Scholar Song confirmed.

“……” The Hermit was left speechless.

He couldn’t help but think—after all these years of alchemical practice, it seemed like his skills had gone to waste. Here was someone who, on their first try, was using an induction cooker and a hot pot to concoct something like body refining liquid, while he was still struggling with his tenth batch, failing one or two times!

After a long pause, he finally spoke, “Can I curse?”

“Damn!” Wild Blade of Three Tides jumped in first.

“Damn!” Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram followed right behind.

“Damn!” Drunken Moon Scholar kept up the momentum—speaking of which, Drunken Moon Scholar was a frequent presence in the chat, a senior who was quite active. For some reason, every time Scholar Song saw him speak, he felt a strange sense of familiarity, yet would forget him as soon as he turned away.

“Hey, you three have all cursed already. What am I supposed to say?” The Hermit of North River grumbled, “Watch my ultimate move! @Alchemical Sage, it’s time for you to step in!”

“I’m here,” the Alchemical Sage popped up. He had been following the chat all along.

After a moment, he typed out a carefully considered question: “Young friend, could you describe your alchemical process? Especially the unexpected event you mentioned regarding the forty-first ingredient.”

Fay Yu’s eyes lit up: “Oh, oh, oh, Senior Song, we really want to know about this step! We’ve failed at this point several times!”

With Fay Yu’s enthusiasm, Scholar Song felt at ease joining the conversation in the Ninefold Land chat group, without the slightest bit of awkwardness. This was partly because he had been lurking for over ten days, becoming familiar with everyone’s personalities.

“No problem, I’ll describe it briefly,” Scholar Song said. “I first added some sliced ginseng into the pot, then poured in a scoop of water.”

“Wait, you added water?” The Alchemical Sage’s fingers flew over the keyboard. “Why did you add water?”

“Because if I don’t add water, the ginseng slices will burn up in the pot, right?” Scholar Song answered, realizing that everyone in the group didn’t seem to use water when concocting their body refining liquids.

“Oh, that makes sense. You’re using an induction cooker and a hot pot,” the Hermit of North River sighed—why did knowing the truth make his liver hurt even more?

The Alchemical Sage nodded silently: “That’s reasonable. Continue; the first step of adding water shouldn’t have too much impact on the later stages.”

As Scholar Song began detailing his process, all the seniors in the group imagined a scene before their eyes.

A scholarly looking man named “Mountain of Books, Great Pressure,” sat poised beside... an induction cooker, atop which was a hot pot, diligently pouring in the ingredients for the body refining potion, completely absorbed in his alchemy.

Why did this scenario feel so bizarre?

Why did alchemy involve an induction cooker and a hot pot?

Scholar Song didn’t think too much about it. He outlined the steps he took in his alchemical process, sharing his understanding of the heat and timing involved, as well as problems he encountered while refining the body liquid.

Hearing Scholar Song break down his modified formula gave the Alchemical Sage a deep sense of satisfaction, akin to finding a kindred spirit in music.

“When I reached the forty-first ingredient, the pot suddenly emitted a foul odor and burning smell, and the amount of potion rapidly evaporated—within the blink of an eye, it was about one-fifth less,” Scholar Song recounted. “At that moment, I couldn’t grasp the cause. I could only guess it was some kind of catalyst?”

“I’ve experienced that too, where the potion just evaporated away quickly,” Fay Yu exclaimed.

“I, too, had the same issue,” Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram nodded. They weren’t alchemists, but as cultivators, making some low-tier, ordinary potions wasn’t a problem for them.

“That’s because that particular ingredient acts as a catalyst. Once you add it, it signifies the start of the final purification stage. If you lack experience in controlling the heat and timing during your initial attempts at alchemy, adding the forty-first catalyst can lead to such outcomes. To avoid this, you need to accumulate experience; there’s no shortcut,” the Alchemical Sage explained.

Similarly, if such a situation arose, one could only rely on experience and perception to resolve it.

“Scholar Song, how did you manage to get through this hurdle?” the Alchemical Sage inquired curiously.

“When I saw the potion evaporating so quickly, I added another scoop of water, hoping to slow down the evaporation,” Scholar Song recalled.

“Adding water again? Oh... that might be a decent way to alleviate the issue. And then what? Adding water only addresses the symptoms, not the root cause,” the Alchemical Sage questioned, pondering the practicality of adding water. More importantly, he considered whether substituting the water with some specially formulated liquid might better mitigate the evaporation.

“Then I just went ahead and added the last four ingredients all at once, cranked up the heat, and boiled it fiercely. In the end, the lid of the pot was blown off, and I was left with about five spoonfuls of the body refining liquid,” Scholar Song replied.

“Five spoonfuls? If your spoon isn’t one of those baby spoons, five spoonfuls is quite a lot,” the Hermit of North River sighed. Under normal circumstances, one would typically yield about three spoonfuls of body refining liquid.

“How does the potency compare to what you had before? Oh... I forgot, this is your first time refining body liquid,” the Alchemical Sage lamented. “I’ll go offline now and try to refine it your way. Once I have results, I’ll share my thoughts.”

With that, the Alchemical Sage logged off.

“Haha, when it comes to refining potions, the Alchemical Sage is always so impatient. Let’s wait until he finishes his refinement. If his method works as he claims, your technique could become a new simplified way to brew body refining liquid. Then, people in the group might owe you a favor in the future, which would be simply priceless for you,” the Hermit of North River sent a smiling emoji.

Scholar Song’s presence in this group meant he was looking to engage with “cultivation.” In fact, after refining the body liquid and consuming it, he had already stepped one foot into the world of cultivation.

“Then, welcome to the Ninefold Land group, Scholar Song,” the Hermit of North River said. “Originally, these matters should have been explained to you by our group leader, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, since he’s the one who invited you and believed you had potential. However, his big demon dog has been throwing a fit today, so I’m stepping in instead.”

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain’s big demon dog seemed to have quite the personality, Scholar Song thought to himself.

“Since you’ve chosen to embark on the path of cultivation, there are some things you need to know. The path of cultivation is not as easy as you might imagine. Along the way, there are countless tribulations, and you could face life-threatening dangers at any moment.”

“I have some knowledge about it; I’ve seen the lightning tribulation in H City from a distance,” Scholar Song replied.

Fay Yu added, “Senior Song lives quite close to H City, and also near J City.”

“You even know about Al Sixteen’s lightning tribulation? It looks like you’ve been keeping an eye on us since you joined the group,” the Hermit of North River teased.

“Haha.” Scholar Song laughed shyly. He couldn’t exactly say that he thought everyone was a bit eccentric and was enjoying their antics, could he?

“Since you’re mentally prepared, I’ll get to the point,” the Hermit of North River continued. “Scholar Song, since you’ve decided to stay in this group, it’s clear you want to learn about cultivation methods from us. According to our tradition in the Ninefold group, you have two choices now: become a scattered cultivator or join a particular senior’s sect in the group.”

With so many people added to Ninefold Land, they naturally had their own ways of doing things. However, it was rare to find someone like Scholar Song, a complete newcomer who knew absolutely nothing about cultivation.
