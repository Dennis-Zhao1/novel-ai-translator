**Inch-Long Snake**

Scholar Song was quite intrigued by Heavenly Realm Island—after all, it was a mysterious place that even the seniors of the 'Ninefold Land No.1 Group' had longed to uncover but had gleaned little useful information about.

As the saying goes, curiosity killed the cat. The more mysterious a place, the more humans are driven to discover the reasons for its existence.

But alas... even if he learned the secrets of Heavenly Realm Island, what good would it do? When it was time to leave, a memory-cleansing spell would wipe his mind clean, and he'd forget everything.

[I have some curiosity, but what’s the use in understanding it?] Scholar Song was just about to articulate this thought.

However, at that moment, a sudden figure appeared, interrupting Scholar Song's musings.

Perched on a branch of a towering tree, standing over ten meters high, was a figure dressed in a pink robe with a bright red sash tied around his waist.

It was clear at a glance that he was also a cultivator from the Ninefold Land.

But unlike the two lecherous-looking uncles, this figure grinned with a charming smirk, his handsome visage radiating a captivating allure.

"Ah, so my two useless senior brothers have been defeated by you, huh?" the charming youth leaned against the trunk of the tree and addressed Scholar Song.

Scholar Song's gaze sharpened; this seemingly transformed cultivator from the Ninefold Land was far stronger than his two senior brothers. Around this charming youth, a faint flow of true energy could be sensed, indicating he had already stepped into the second tier of True Master.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but grip the Ba Sui Treasure Blade tightly, while his other hand secretly clutched a talisman—a 'Sword Talisman' that he had tested multiple times, confirming its authenticity.

Behind Scholar Song, Jiu Deng glared at the Ninefold Land cultivator, her fists clenched in frustration—how dare he interrupt her words! Was he tired of living?

Seeing Scholar Song’s nervous expression, the charming youth smiled with satisfaction.

Then, wearing an expression of ‘everything is under my control’, he said, “No need to be so tense. Unlike my useless senior brothers, I’m a pacifist. Rather than resorting to fists, I believe any problem that can be solved with words should be addressed with words. That’s the art of language, and it’s the greatest distinction between us intelligent beings and beasts!”

His words resonated strongly with the Mistress Scallion in Scholar Song's pocket—indeed, how much better it would be if conflicts could be resolved through conversation, rather than violence that only sows discord!

“…”

Scholar Song was speechless.

So there really existed a character with a ‘talkative’ trait in this world. Did he not realize that such a trait could be quite deadly?

“You see, you’ve killed my two senior brothers. Here’s the deal: let me have a go at the two behind you. If they serve me well and satisfy me, I can spare your lives. How about that?” the charming youth proposed confidently.

Zhuge Yue: “…”

Zhuge Zhongyang: “…”

As expected, even if the character's vibe had changed, the inherent perversion of the Ninefold Land cultivators couldn’t be altered.

“What’s wrong? From the looks on your faces, do you intend to refuse me?” the charming youth’s gaze turned icy, his tone chilling, as a powerful aura emanated from him, pressing down on Scholar Song, Zhuge Zhongyang, and Zhuge Yue.

Zhuge Zhongyang and Zhuge Yue struggled to bear the pressure, their bodies trembling involuntarily.

Scholar Song remained silent. He tightened his grip on the Ba Sui Blade and activated the 'Gentleman’s Journey' technique, charging toward the massive tree. With the help of 'Gentleman’s Journey', he could run straight up despite the height.

The blade shone ominously as it was raised.

However, the attack of the Ba Sui Blade was merely a distraction. The real assault lay concealed in Scholar Song's gripping hand.

Once he got within the range of the 'Sword Talisman', he would let this guy experience the talisman’s power.

“Honestly, it’s always these overconfident fools. Since you seek death, don’t blame me,” the charming youth said coldly. “What a shame that those two special-bodied humans would be much less effective if they were unwilling sacrifices.”

This was precisely why he had wasted so much time talking.

As he spoke, the charming youth spread his arms, revealing ten blood-red threads that appeared between his fingers. These threads were a form of mystical weapon, capable of both rigidity and softness when combined with true energy, boasting immense power.

In the next instant, he moved, his fingers curling, clawing at Scholar Song.

Scholar Song’s gaze remained calm; he was just five paces away from the Sword Talisman’s attack range!

……

However, just as the charming youth took three steps forward, he suddenly felt a chill at his ankle.

Then, he saw Scholar Song’s figure shift and rapidly expand!

In the blink of an eye, Scholar Song had morphed into an enormous giant over ten meters tall, his Ba Sui Blade resembling a terrifying heavenly cleaver.

“What kind of technique is this? What kind of race!” the charming youth exclaimed in shock.

Even the legendary ancient 'Giant Spirit' race rarely had giants of such a height.

Moreover, the 'Giant Spirit' race had long since vanished from history; even if remnants of the 'Giant Spirit' race did exist, they couldn’t possibly shrink down to normal human size.

“So it’s an illusion?” the charming youth murmured.

Of course! It had to be an illusion!

Not only was this Scholar Song before him an illusion, but the terrifying giant snake coiling around him was also an illusion!

“Such a mere illusion, watch me break it!” the charming youth shouted angrily, his true energy surging within him as he formed a seal with his hands: “Breaking Illusion Seal!”

Powerful true energy surged around him, enveloping his body.

At that moment, the enormous snake beside him seemed agitated; its massive jaws opened wide, swallowing the charming youth whole...

“Break the illusion, break it, break it!” the charming youth yelled even as he was engulfed. Half of his body was already inside the snake’s belly, his legs thrashing wildly, trying to escape...

And then, there was nothing more.

Scholar Song swallowed hard, cautiously gazing at the tiny snake resting on the tree branch, which was no larger than a finger.

“Inch-long Snake!” he recalled immediately, remembering how Fay Yu had introduced this fascinating spirit beast to him.

The magical little pouch that Fay Yu owned, which could shrink items, was made from the shed skin of an Inch-long Snake.

The skin of an Inch-long Snake possessed a unique ability to shrink any prey it came into contact with. Although it was no larger than a human finger, it could coil around an elephant and shrink it down to the size of a fingernail, swallowing it whole.

Now it made sense... no wonder he felt a strange familiarity with the spirit beast Jiu Deng had described earlier. So it was this one!

This also explained why that enormous lizard had suddenly shrunk and disappeared when he brought passengers to the ancient city—it had to be the work of this Inch-long Snake!

And the reason Zhuge Yue had shrunk earlier was also due to her accidentally encountering an Inch-long Snake.

According to Jiu Deng, the reason the Inch-long Snake hadn’t eaten Zhuge Yue was simply that it had already feasted recently, so it had no appetite for the little girl.

It seemed that after a hearty meal, the Inch-long Snake had sought out a cozy spot to rest and digest.

But it hadn’t anticipated that it would be disturbed by Zhuge Yue, who inadvertently disrupted its nap. Thus, the disgruntled Inch-long Snake had crawled up the towering tree to continue resting.

But it hadn’t expected that after climbing so high, someone else would come along to bother it.

“Just because a tiger doesn’t roar, you think I'm a sick cat?”

Thus, without hesitation, it coiled around the charming youth and used its innate ability to shrink him down. Although it wasn’t hungry, the irked Inch-long Snake still swallowed the charming youth whole.

After devouring the charming youth, the Inch-long Snake raised its head, its gaze coldly fixed on Scholar Song.

The ones who disturbed its rest were not only that charming youth but also Scholar Song himself.

“Sorry for the disturbance! I’m just a passerby, please ignore me!” Scholar Song flashed a bright smile.

Without a second thought, he turned and leaped away from the tree.

However, the Inch-long Snake had no intention of letting him off the hook.

Though small in size, it moved with lightning speed. The slender body of the snake shot towards Scholar Song like a bolt of lightning.

*Slap!*

It coiled around Scholar Song’s body.

In the next moment, Scholar Song was rapidly shrinking in mid-air. In the blink of an eye, he was reduced to the size of a palm.

……

Scholar Song did not want to be shrunk down to the size of a fingernail and swallowed whole by the 'Inch-long Snake'.

“Jiu Deng, help!” Scholar Song cried out desperately—was it just his imagination, or did he feel especially skilled at calling for help?

Could it be that he had become proficient at it after repeatedly shouting, “Senior XX, help!” to his elders?

“Oh? You’re calling for my help?” Jiu Deng squinted her eyes, her mood brightening instantly.

With that, she flicked her finger, sending a golden Buddhist bead flying towards the Inch-long Snake.

Sensing danger, the Inch-long Snake raised its head and fixed its gaze on the approaching bead.

Moments later, the Inch-long Snake spat out a hiss of dissatisfaction, releasing Scholar Song and springing back toward the giant tree.

However, that golden Buddhist bead followed closely, shooting towards the Inch-long Snake.

*Slap!*

The bead struck the Inch-long Snake, adhering to its body, emanating a chorus of chanting sounds that resonated like a powerful current, causing the Inch-long Snake to tremble.

“Zzz!” The Inch-long Snake hissed in frustration, and in the next moment, its body split open, revealing a new Inch-long Snake that quickly darted away without a backward glance.

It left behind only a layer of sloughed-off skin.

“Hmm? Just in time for a molting phase, and it managed to escape,” Jiu Deng remarked with a hint of regret.

As she spoke, she took out a small notebook and lightly marked a line across it.

Faintly, one could see that the page was filled with a list of her intentions.
