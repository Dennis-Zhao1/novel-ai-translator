**Chapter [Insert Chapter Number]: The Unraveling of Dignity**

"Unfortunately, I really have no shame!"

"Please, senior, show me a way out," the forum master forced himself to ask, his voice steady despite the cold sweat on his brow.

"Take one of my attacks. Of course, I won't use my full strength. If you can survive, I will let you go," Scholar Song declared, extending a finger as he spoke.

Once one’s sense of shame reaches a critical point, it collapses just like one’s worldview.

As Scholar Song repeatedly referred to himself as "this seat," he felt less and less ashamed, and his words flowed more smoothly.

The forum master’s face turned a ghastly shade. Even if this inscrutable senior didn't go all out, just a casual strike with a flying sword could easily cost him half his life!

However, he had no choice.

Enduring one attack might lead to death, but it still offered a slim chance of survival. If he refused the senior's offer, all it would take was a flick of a sword to turn his head into a night pot.

Besides... he had a hidden card. As a practitioner of the sinister path, he possessed a strange life-saving method. Perhaps he could withstand an attack at the cost of "dying" once.

With that thought in mind, the forum master gritted his teeth and asked, "Is what you say true, senior?"

"I am a person of some standing in the cultivation world. Why would I lie to a junior like you?" Scholar Song replied coldly, still looking down at the forum master as if he were an insect.

It was true; Scholar Song wasn’t lying. Anyone normal had a head and a face. Did you not have a head and a face?

"Please, senior, show mercy," the forum master forced a smile, his expression reflecting a bitterness that felt palpable even from a thousand miles away.

Unbeknownst to them, deep within the forum master's body, a pure ghostly entity broke free from its seal, quietly wrapping around him.

Pure ghostly entities are souls without resentment, so they are not afraid of ordinary exorcism spells. 

Of course, creating a pure ghostly entity is no easy feat. Ghosts typically arise from hatred. A pure ghost must have been a genuinely good person at heart, who died under unfortunate circumstances. Yet, if that good person was troubled enough to not care about their grievances, they could become a pure ghost...

"Then receive this sword from my seat!" Scholar Song declared indifferently, turning his finger to reveal a talisman paper.

The 'Sword Talisman' gifted by the master of the Seven Lives Talisman House was meant for attack; to use it, one only needed to activate it and utter the word 'sword.' Once unleashed, it could generate a sword aura equivalent to a third-grade postnatal warrior, capable of splitting mountains and stones. For an ordinary second-grade True Master, unless they had some special defense, a single strike could leave them half dead at best.

As he looked at this talisman, the forum master felt his teeth nearly grind to dust… As a struggling low-level cultivator, nothing angered him more than these rich folks who tossed talismans around like they were confetti!

"Stand still, junior. Pray for your luck," Scholar Song commanded, gripping the talisman with an imposing aura, excitement bubbling within him. "Sword!"

A hazy figure faintly appeared behind Scholar Song.

This figure wielded a finger like a sword, slashing toward the forum master.

Brilliant sword light erupted from the talisman, filling the carriage with nothing but that single beam of brilliance, as if the entire world was reduced to this one radiant cut!

This sword light was a masterful display of swordsmanship!

In an instant, the forum master, locked in place by the sword light, felt as if he was frozen—he couldn't move an inch.

Even dodging was a luxury. He could only stand there, staring blankly as the blade struck him!

Humiliation? Hatred? Fear?

A whirlwind of emotions churned in the forum master’s heart, a chaotic mixture of flavors that could not be named.

As the sword light reached him, it merely produced a faint hissing sound.

Yet, the forum master's body was easily sliced in half, crashing to the ground with a thud.

No blood flowed from the wound…

The Western monk couldn’t help but smirk. Was that it? A powerful second-grade True Master just met his end like this?

Silence enveloped the carriage.

But Scholar Song didn't lower his guard. With one hand still gripping a 'Shield Talisman,' and the other holding two 'Sword Talismans,' he watched the forum master’s body cautiously.

This guy had been active in the J City Ghost Lantern Temple for over fifty years; as long as he hadn’t fallen too low, he was bound to have one or two life-preserving items on him.

With that thought, Scholar Song’s expression turned serious as he declared, "You seem to have some skills. Since you took my sword, I'll let you off this time. Get up and roll away from my sight! Remember, don’t ever let me see you again! Forever!"

Scholar Song had honed his bluffing skills to perfection.

The Western monk was stunned—how could such a terrifying sword strike leave the second-grade ghost cultivator still alive?

It couldn't be, could it? That sword was too horrifying!

But just as Scholar Song finished speaking, the body of the forum master, cut in half, slowly dissipated into black smoke, vanishing into the air.

Then, the forum master appeared again, his face ashen, a deep sword mark etched across his forehead. In a critical moment, he had relied on his life-saving method to survive, but that sword was too powerful, leaving him with a severe wound. The residual sword energy made him feel as if he were suffering in agony.

"Thank you, senior, for sparing my life," the forum master gritted his teeth, speaking through the pain. "I will leave immediately."

Since the senior had already seen through his survival, hiding was pointless.

The other party genuinely seemed like a person of their word, willing to grant him a chance to live. If he continued to hide, he might enrage this senior and give him a reason to strike again, and he'd truly be done for.

As he spoke, the severely wounded ghost general, Ku You, floated over, carrying a black briefcase.

This case held the forum master's important belongings. Some items were too precious for him to dare leave behind in the chaotic streets of J City. So, he kept everything in this black case.

"He's really alive?" The Western monk couldn't believe his eyes.

Looking at the pale face before him, Scholar Song sighed inwardly. This guy was indeed alive.

To survive, this fellow was quite persistent.

What a pity; if he were truly a respectable senior who cared about his reputation, he might have let him live.

But alas, Scholar Song had never intended to maintain his dignity! All he wanted was to finish him off!

If he didn’t take care of this guy, Scholar Song would find it hard to eat or sleep. He couldn’t live his life in peace!

So, just as the forum master lifted the black case and turned to leave with difficulty... Scholar Song made his move again!

"Sword! Sword!" He activated two 'Sword Talismans' in each hand simultaneously.

Who knew if the forum master had any more life-saving tricks up his sleeve? Scholar Song decided to go all out with two talismans at once! If he had more hands, he would have used every last one!

Brilliant sword light erupted once again from the talismans, forming an X-shaped slash aimed at the forum master.

Despite the forum master's vigilance, it was futile.

The two beams of sword light were too swift, locking onto their target while possessing the ability to immobilize the enemy.

In the wake of the sword light, the forum master’s body was sliced into four pieces, crashing to the ground once more. Yet this time, he had no means of survival—he was utterly doomed.

The body of a second-grade cultivator is incredibly resilient, and even when cut apart, the forum master did not immediately perish. His head turned to fixate on Scholar Song, filled with countless curses he longed to unleash, but all that escaped his lips were two words filled with resentment: "Shameless!"

Though he had known that the other party was skilled with poison and had a capricious personality, he hadn’t expected them to be this utterly without bottom line.

"Heh, say whatever you like," Scholar Song quickly grabbed another talisman, the 'Exorcism Talisman.'

The forum master was down, but his lingering ghostly entity, Ku You, still remained alive.

To eradicate the roots of the weeds, lest they grow back!

If Scholar Song were a lone wolf, he wouldn’t fear any repercussions. But regrettably, he was not.

"Break!" The exorcism talisman unleashed its spiritual wind, sweeping through the two carriage sections.

"Ah..." Ghost general Ku You let out a pitiful scream, powerless to escape, and was directly purified by the power of the exorcism talisman.

Thud~~ The black briefcase fell to the ground.

And the dying forum master was also subject to the purifying energy of the exorcism talisman, losing even the strength for a last-ditch retaliation.

Just at the thought of his impending death, the forum master's mind went blank, and he stammered, "Don’t... shameless! A promise... is... pfft!"
