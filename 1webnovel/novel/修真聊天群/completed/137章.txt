**Scholar Song, do you want the benefits or not?**

Could there be a surprise? Could the ‘Three Star Fire Fan’ actually control the heavenly tribulation flames on the leader of the Moon Blade Sect?

Can such a lofty thing as heavenly tribulation flames be controlled by the fire fan?

While Scholar Song was deep in thought, Ba Qianjun was manipulating the protective array of the sect, making rapid changes. At last, he seized an opportunity. He let out a hearty laugh, wielding his treasured blade, and soared into the air, appearing directly above Scholar Song and Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan.

Next, he spun the treasured sword beneath his feet, sending a crescent-shaped blade of light slicing through the air towards Scholar Song and Sable Sixteen—Ba Qianjun couldn’t see the Tian Gang Ling Huang Ling at all!

The Tian Gang Ling Huang Ling, much like the flying sword of Master Tong Xuan, was shrouded in a hidden formation. Anyone with cultivation below Su Clan’s A Qi wouldn't even perceive its existence.

Scholar Song and Sable Sixteen were protected by the Tian Gang Ling Huang Ling, allowing them to see it along with a faint layer of reddish defense.

However, to Ba Qianjun, the two young juniors standing carelessly at the back of the battlefield appeared utterly foolish and brazen.

This was an opportunity not to be missed!

With this strike, he was determined to gift each of these juniors a disability certificate for free!

Clang!

The blade light he unleashed crashed against the protective layer of the Tian Gang Ling Huang Ling, easily blocked.

The defensive capabilities of the Tian Gang Ling Huang Ling were quite high—if they weren’t, would Su Clan's A Qi have felt at ease leaving Scholar Song and Sable Sixteen in the back?

Ba Qianjun was momentarily stunned, but he quickly realized that these two juniors were surrounded by a high-level defensive artifact.

“Hmph, defensive artifacts are mere inanimate objects. They have limits; let me break it!” Ba Qianjun thought to himself, leaping into the air and grasping the long sword with both hands.

The sword was named ‘Ba Sui,’ measuring three feet and three inches, crafted from the heavy metals of the Thunder Pool, possessing extreme yang energy and unparalleled hardness compared to other swords of its rank. The blade was sharp enough to slice through the flesh of a fourth-grade cultivator!

This was the treasured weapon passed down through generations in the Moon Blade Sect, considered a top-tier weapon among those of the same grade.

“Moon Wheel Slash!” Ba Qianjun raised the Ba Sui sword high, tracing a circular trajectory in the air before bringing it down!

At that moment, the young man below opened an iron fan and connected it six times. Then, he stepped forward and aimed the fan at Ba Qianjun, giving it a gentle flap!

Was that some kind of offensive artifact?

Ba Qianjun mentally prepared himself.

However, after that single flap, the anticipated attack did not occur at all.

The attack method of a fan-like artifact typically involved either ‘gale’ or ‘flame’ attacks, but the young man’s simple flap had unleashed nothing.

Just as he was puzzled, he suddenly felt an intense burning pain radiating from his back and arms.

Before he could react, the heavenly tribulation flames flared up, engulfing him completely in a blazing fireball!

In the blink of an eye, Ba Qianjun was reduced to ashes.

His robes, armor, tokens, pills—all turned to fine dust—along with a fruit shimmering with seven colors, which was also consumed by the flames.

Even the Ba Sui sword was tinged with a faint golden flame.

Ding… After its master was burned to ashes, the Ba Sui sword fell to the ground.

It landed right at Scholar Song's feet. Once it touched the ground, the flames gradually faded away. It was not the target of the tribulation flames; otherwise, it would have melted into molten iron long ago.

Scholar Song held the ‘Three Star Fire Fan’ tightly, swallowing hard.

Is this really it? A seemingly powerful cultivator was reduced to ashes just like that with a simple flap?

Speaking of which… he had killed quite a few beings in the past few days. And each one had been more powerful than the last.

“Three Star Fire Fan?” Sable Sixteen glanced at the fan in Scholar Song's hand… indeed, there are no useless artifacts, only cultivators who don’t know how to use them!

Scholar Song stowed the fan away and noticed the sword lying at his feet. He crouched down, cautiously reaching out to touch the ‘Ba Sui’ sword.

This sword had survived the tribulation flames, indicating its uniqueness.

After a gentle touch, Scholar Song found that the Ba Sui sword was still completely cool to the touch. If it wasn’t for the layer of charred blackness on the blade, he would have doubted whether the flames had ever touched it.

……

……

The death of Ba Qianjun left the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect utterly bewildered!

They had seen their mighty and imposing sect leader leap high, unleashing a blade of light.

Then he executed the Moon Blade Sect's ultimate move ‘Moon Wheel Slash.’

Yet suddenly, their leader transformed into a fireball, disappearing without a trace!

The once-disciplined ranks of the Moon Blade Sect fell into chaos. With the leader gone, the protective array could no longer maintain its structure, becoming disordered and completely ineffective.

“Haha!” Su Clan’s A Qi laughed heartily, turning his blade and sending all the Moon Blade Sect disciples blocking his way flying.

Disciples from the Moon Blade Sect fell in droves!

In the depths of Lanyuan Valley, Young Master Hai stood at a high point, observing the battle outside.

“Jek! Jek! Sect Leader Ba has finally ‘sacrificed’ himself. Sooner than we planned and in a way beyond our expectations,” the avatar of An Zhi Demon Lord inside his robe cackled. “I remember he always kept that Seven Colored Marvel Fruit with him, right? That was his hope for healing the tribulation flames, never letting it out of his sight. And now it’s been burned away?”

“Ha ha.” Young Master Hai waved his hand, revealing a seven-colored fruit hovering in his palm. “The Seven Colored Marvel Fruit has been in my grasp from the very beginning.”

“……” An Zhi Demon Lord’s avatar froze. He had been concealed in Young Master Hai’s sleeve all along and hadn’t even noticed when Young Master Hai had swapped the real Seven Colored Marvel Fruit!

“It’s about time. If A Qi continues to slash away, the number of disciples in the Moon Blade Sect won’t be enough to maintain the ‘New Protective Array’,” Young Master Hai unsheathed the long sword at his waist, which floated quietly beneath him.

Young Master Hai took a step forward, firmly stepping onto the sword light. As the sword light shifted, it transported him into the sky above Lanyuan Valley.

“All disciples, regain your composure and listen to my commands.” Young Master Hai’s gentle voice rang throughout Lanyuan Valley.

Once the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect heard Elder Hai’s voice, they felt their hearts and minds settle down.

Soon, under Young Master Hai’s leadership, the disciples reorganized the protective array, gradually regaining their morale and encircling Su Clan’s A Qi once more.

“You’ve finally decided to show yourself, Young Master Hai,” Su Clan’s A Qi laughed heartily.

Young Master Hai smiled slightly, not backing down. “I’ve been waiting for you, A Qi.”

As they spoke, he raised both hands. A massive formation within Lanyuan Valley activated, and the blood mist above thickened.

The battle was on the verge of erupting!

……

……

Scholar Song opened the group chat again, adding a message under the photo of the leader of the Moon Blade Sect.

**Scholar Song**: “@The Alchemical Sage, senior, I flapped the fan a few times at the person in the photo, and he… turned to ashes.”

The Alchemical Sage’s account quickly replied: “Hahaha! Just as I predicted. The heavenly tribulation flames on that guy had been around for too long and had undergone various treatments. They were no longer pure. Because of that, the ‘Three Star Fire Fan’ could control it just a bit. Just a slight control, and the flames would ignite, turning him to ashes! — That’s what the Alchemical Sage said.”

Scholar Song gripped the Three Star Fire Fan tightly… just from a photo, the seniors were all incredibly unfathomable.

Just as Scholar Song was reflecting, another comment appeared under the post titled ‘Watching Su Clan’s A Qi Dismantle the Moon Blade Sect.’

**Master of Seven Life Talismans**: “@Scholar Song, I took a closer look at the photo, and I feel like the formation the Moon Blade Sect disciples are using has some issues. Scholar Song, could you take a clearer picture of it, capturing the general layout of this formation?”

Master of Seven Life Talismans was not only a master of talismans but also had profound knowledge of formations, as talismans and formations complemented each other.

Upon seeing this comment, Scholar Song replied: “Got it, I’ll take a few clearer shots right away. By the way, if this formation has any tricks up its sleeve, would A Qi have any problems?”

Master of Seven Life Talismans: “Not at all. If A Qi goes all out, he can definitely challenge higher levels… Anyway, whether the formation has any abnormalities is just my guess. Let’s wait until you take the full view before discussing it.”

“I’ll get that done and uploaded right away.” Scholar Song replied.

He then grabbed his phone, aiming it at the Moon Blade Sect’s position, making sure to capture the formation created by all the disciples. He snapped several photos and uploaded them to the group chat.

Sable Sixteen stood close to Scholar Song, quietly watching the content on the phone.

**Master of Seven Life Talismans**: “Indeed, there’s something odd about it. The formation created by these disciples appears to be capable of unleashing battle power in a short time. But in reality… if I’m not mistaken, the side effects of this formation are quite severe, right? @Respected Seven Repairs, could you take a look at this? I still feel something is off with the valley’s terrain.”

**Respected Seven Repairs**: “Exactly. Coupled with the terrain of this valley and the hidden second formation, anyone using this formation must have a ruthless heart!”

**Master of Seven Life Talismans**: “With your confirmation, Respected One, I’m even more confident. Scholar Song, my young friend, do you want to gain some extra rewards?”

**Scholar Song**: “What rewards?”

**Master of Seven Life Talismans**: “If luck is on your side, you should be able to obtain a precious material for refining weapons. Moreover, it could enhance your physical strength, perhaps allowing you to open your heart or complete your hundred days of foundation building sooner. Of course, there are risks… but with Su Clan’s A Qi around, you definitely won’t die!”

**Scholar Song**: “What should I do?” Scholar Song inquired immediately.

Completing the hundred days of foundation building and enhancing his physical strength was exactly what Scholar Song desired right now.

**Master of Seven Life Talismans**: “Alright, I’ll mark a red circle on the photo and send it to you. First, find the location I’ve circled!”

Soon, the master sent a photo, and Scholar Song compared it, finding the red circle was located about four hundred meters away from him, beside a large, unknown tree.

**Master of Seven Life Talismans**: “@Respected Seven Repairs, does this location look correct?”

**Respected Seven Repairs**: “You’ve improved; this coordinate is spot on.”

**Master of Seven Life Talismans**: “Scholar Song, have you found the location? Once you find it, give me a call, and we’ll stay in touch so I can understand the situation and guide your next steps!”

“I found it!” Scholar Song replied, holding his phone and looking for Master of Seven Life Talismans’ phone number—at that moment, he was not fighting alone. The seniors in the entire Ninefold Land group were supporting him from behind!
