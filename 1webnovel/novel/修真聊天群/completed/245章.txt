Chapter - Meteorites and Cracks (Part 2)

In tragedy films, there's a common technique to highlight characters' misfortunes. For instance, when the characters endure numerous hardships and overcome countless obstacles, they finally manage to escape from the depths of hell, traps, or disaster zones. 

Yet, what greets them is anything but salvation—a sudden barrage of bullets, a mysterious flash of axes or blades, and sometimes even world-ending meteorites raining from the sky. These poor souls are unceremoniously whisked away to the afterlife, leaving the audience feeling frustrated and sympathetic for their tragic fates.

At this moment, Old Lü found himself fitting perfectly into such a tragic character template.

He gritted his teeth, summoning every ounce of willpower and masculine pride, and somehow managed to swing the hand tractor into the second U-turn.

In that fleeting moment, Old Lü felt as if his entire body was falling apart, yet he couldn’t help but let out a quiet sigh of relief.

However, what awaited them was not a wide, straight road, but another terrifying U-turn, this one even more pronounced and heading in the opposite direction.

“Damn it! We're done for!” Old Lü screamed.

Because this time, he had no strength left to guide the hand tractor into the second reverse U-turn. Even if his back were perfectly fine, it was impossible.

Did they really think the hand tractor was a race car? Even if it could reach speeds of 150 miles per hour, it was still just a hand tractor. Its maneuverability, torque, braking, and agility could never compare to a sports car.

“Don’t give up, Old Lü!” shouted Father Song, desperate to take the wheel himself and save Old Lü from this predicament. But the truth was, even if he took over, it wouldn’t change the fact that the hand tractor was about to crash off the mountain path.

Old Lü barely managed to attempt a turn, but the outcome was far from promising.

Behind them, three young women in sports cars were slowing down, carefully navigating the first bend.

Maitao looked at the hand tractor at the second turn, disappointment creeping into her voice, “Oh no, what a pity, the tractor has already made it past the first bend.”

“It’s okay; capturing it making the second turn would still be quite impressive,” replied the fashionable girl, Arthur.

Then, the three sports cars reduced their speed further, preparing to tackle the second curve.

They also switched on their dash cams, ready to film the moment the tractor, their so-called ‘car god,’ sped through the S-shaped passage at over a hundred miles per hour.

But just then, what they saw was not the adept maneuvering of the tractor. It merely gestured slightly towards the second bend before it careened straight into the guardrail!

Boom!

The once sturdy guardrail shattered like plastic under the impact of the speeding tractor, breaking apart in an instant.

The tractor soared over the edge, rolling down the terraced hillside!

As the three girls witnessed this scene unfold, they instinctively slammed on their brakes.

The tires screeched against the pavement, and the three sports cars came to a halt by the roadside.

“……” Maitao was stunned into silence.

“……” Arthur, the fashionable girl, was equally shocked.

“……” Zhao Yaya was momentarily frozen, and then she rushed from the sports car, panic-stricken as she sprinted toward the spot where the tractor had fallen.

They had to remember—Father Song was still up there!

Maitao and Arthur hastily followed behind Yaya as they ran to the broken guardrail and peered down.

At that moment, the tractor lay upside down like a flipped turtle on the cliff of the third terrace, its wheels still spinning wildly.

The three men inside the tractor were trapped beneath it, their fates unknown.

“Uncle! Uncle!” Zhao Yaya shouted, her voice laced with urgency as she pulled out her phone, ready to call Mother Song.

Just then, from beneath the overturned trailer, came Father Song’s raspy voice, “Cough, cough! You scoundrel Old Lü, this isn’t over! Are you still alive down there?”

Soon after, two figures crawled out from under the trailer.

One was Father Song, with glasses and a scholarly aura about him. The other was the burly Lü Tianyou.

Aside from being a bit dirty, both men appeared completely uninjured!

“Dad, are you okay?” Lü Tianyou called out, his voice booming.

“How could I be fine? Oh, my goodness, my back! Get me out of here; it hurts like hell!” came Old Lü's miserable wail from inside the tractor’s cabin.

Father Song and Lü Tianyou hurried to the front of the tractor.

The front of the tractor was tilted upwards, creating a gap between the front and body.

Old Lü had wedged himself in that very space…

Aside from his previously injured back, Old Lü was otherwise unscathed.

However, around him lay various items that had been scattered from the small compartment next to the driver's seat.

Additionally, the oil barrels and Song Shuhang’s box that had been placed in the trailer had rolled to one side. The large meteorite they had brought along was crushed beneath the tractor and had developed a fissure…

Father Song and Lü Tianyou worked together to pull Old Lü free from beneath the tractor.

Thankfully, he was unharmed.

……

“Thank goodness, all three of us are okay,” Old Lü said, a sheepish smile breaking across his face as he surveyed the three girls, all safe and sound.

“You're lucky to be alive. If you hadn’t insisted on using the tractor, none of this would have happened,” Father Song shot a fierce glare at Old Lü.

As he spoke, Father Song recalled some hazy memories from when the tractor had careened off the mountain path.

He vaguely remembered seeing a bright flash when the tractor went flying. 

Then, he felt himself hit the ground, but surprisingly, there was no impact whatsoever!

—They had been thrown off the mountain path to the cliff of the third terrace, each level being five meters high, which meant they had fallen a total of fifteen meters!

At such a height, and with a tractor crashing down on top of them, in a normal situation, they would have been dead or seriously injured! Yet now, they were all miraculously unharmed, just a bit dirty.

“Uncle! Uncle! Are you alright?” a melodious voice called from the mountain path.

Father Song looked up to see Zhao Yaya, dressed in white, calling out to him.

Yaya had genuinely been startled; had the terraces not been high, she would have leaped down to check on them immediately, being a medical student and all.

“Oh? Yaya, what are you doing here?” Father Song asked in return, his gaze landing on the three sports cars parked by the roadside, and suddenly it all clicked.

Just then, the tractor driven by Old Lü had overtaken Zhao Yaya and her friends’ sports cars!

He waved at Zhao Yaya with a smile, saying, “We’re fine, not a scratch on us! No need to worry, Yaya!”

Zhao Yaya asked, “Uncle, do you need me to call Auntie?”

“Not yet, hold on. First, call Shuhang and have him bring a long rope or something to pull us up,” Father Song replied loudly.

Then, he glanced at the overturned tractor… He figured they would need a crane to get it back upright.

This tractor must have been modified somehow. He wondered where Song Shuhang had even gotten it from.

If it was borrowed from someone and got damaged, how would he compensate them?

How could he find a tractor that could reach speeds of over 150 miles per hour to make up for it? Father Song felt a wave of frustration wash over him.

……

“Shuhang is home?” Zhao Yaya scrolled through her contacts and dialed Song Shuhang’s number.

The call connected quickly.

“Hey, Yaya, what’s up?” Song Shuhang’s voice came through.

“Shuhang, you need to prepare a long rope, at least thirty meters long, and bring it to the mountain path behind your house. Just follow the path, and you’ll find me. It’s urgent,” Zhao Yaya replied.

“The mountain path behind your house? Yaya, you’re here too?” Song Shuhang asked, puzzled. “What’s going on? Why do you need such a long rope?”

“Uncle Lü drove the tractor off the path with Father, and now they’re stuck on the terraced hillside. It’s too high for them to climb back up,” Zhao Yaya explained.

“They flipped? Are they okay?” Song Shuhang asked, alarmed.

“They seem fine, but we haven’t checked yet. We’ll assess once we get them up,” Zhao Yaya assured him.

“I’ll be there right away,” Song Shuhang replied before hanging up.

……

“Why do the things we fear always come true!” Song Shuhang sighed, his heart racing. Worried for his father’s safety, he unconsciously activated an even faster version of his movement technique, “Gentleman’s Journey.”

Within ten minutes, he arrived at the scene of the accident.

From a distance, he could see the red, blue, and white sports cars parked by the roadside.

Zhao Yaya leaned against the guardrail, watching the three men below as they sorted through the items that had spilled from the tractor.

The other two girls were hiding inside the car, enjoying the air conditioning.

Song Shuhang slowed his pace to a normal sprint, waving at Zhao Yaya from afar, “Yaya, where are Dad and the others?”

“Shuhang, you finally made it,” Zhao Yaya pointed down towards the damaged guardrail, explaining, “Uncle and the others are down there… Wait, Shuhang, where’s the rope? Why did you come here empty-handed?”

“When you called, I was already nearby, so I just jogged over. Dad and Uncle Lü had a few drinks, then took the tractor out. I was worried, so I followed them,” Song Shuhang chuckled awkwardly.

Not wanting to lie in front of Zhao Yaya, he merely omitted mentioning how he had sped over using his enhanced technique.

“We might have to call roadside assistance to help them out and get the tractor back up,” Zhao Yaya suggested.

Song Shuhang quickly shook his head, “No need, Yaya. I can handle getting the tractor out. I have a friend who specializes in this sort of thing. I’ll head down and bring them up first.”
