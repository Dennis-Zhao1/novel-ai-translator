**Chapter 1: Have I Really Gotten Myself Into Trouble?**

“Damn it! If it weren’t for that fool being trapped in the netherworld for so long, I wouldn’t be this weak,” the Ghost General thought bitterly. Being knocked back by a mere one-star ghost was a humiliation he couldn’t bear!

Scholar Song secretly shook his fists. They were so hard! Even though the Ghost General was currently weakened, its ghostly form was still comparable to that of a two-star cultivator. Especially the shield that the Ghost General conjured; its toughness was on par with the steel door he had smashed while bringing back the statue of Venerable White.

Once the Ghost General regained his footing, he glared at Scholar Song and shouted, “Kid, are you really going to face us head-on?”

“Haha.” Scholar Song chuckled, his hand curling into a claw as he launched into a basic combat technique aimed at the Ghost General.

“You little brat, aren’t you worried we’ll slaughter your entire village?” The Ghost General had plenty of combat experience. He slightly tilted his body, twisting in a way that allowed him to avoid Scholar Song’s grab. Then he floated away, creating distance between them.

Scholar Song thought to himself, at a time like this... only a fool would admit to worrying about the villagers’ safety. Wouldn’t that just hand over his weak points to the enemy, allowing them to strike?

“Who cares?” Scholar Song rolled his eyes and feigned indifference. “If you want to kill, go ahead. My target is you.”

He maintained an air of nonchalance, revealing not the slightest hint of weakness.

The Ghost General was momentarily taken aback.

In that brief instant, Scholar Song lunged forward, activating his movement technique, *Gentleman’s Journey*, which combined slowness with speed, and threw a straight punch at the Ghost General.

To his surprise, the Ghost General suddenly grinned wickedly.

Did he really think he had caught him off guard?

A mere one-star cultivator was indeed a novice in battle, easily led astray.

“Do you really think you’re strong, little one? You’re just digging your own grave!” The armor on the Ghost General exploded, transforming into a massive cloak that enveloped Scholar Song.

This cloak was a special talent spell of his. Once wrapped in it, the target would fall into a weakened state, as their essence would be drained continuously.

“As long as I drain your life force, I can restore about forty percent of my strength, ha ha! I was trying to avoid conflict with you cultivators, but since you insist on pestering me, don’t blame me!” The Ghost General laughed maniacally.

The black cloak wrapped around Scholar Song completely, while the Ghost General took a deep breath and began to draw upon Scholar Song’s vitality.

Suddenly, the Ghost General’s expression changed again.

From within the black cloak, thunder erupted!

Crack! Crack! Crack!

“Palm Thunder!” Scholar Song’s voice rang out from within the black cloak.

An elementary thunder technique, *Palm Thunder*—he had inscribed the thunder symbol in his palm while conversing earlier, keeping it charged but unfired.

Seizing the moment when the Ghost General thought he had the upper hand, Scholar Song unleashed the *Palm Thunder*.

The thunder struck mercilessly against the Ghost General’s body. All his defenses had been concentrated in that enveloping cloak, drastically reducing his armor’s protection.

Boom!

Half of his body was obliterated by the thunder, and the proud black cloak shattered into pieces.

“You... you mastered *Palm Thunder*,” the Ghost General gasped, his upper body slamming against the wall, eyes wide in disbelief as he stared at Scholar Song.

“Hmm, is that strange?” Scholar Song replied, genuinely puzzled. “Isn’t *Palm Thunder* a spell that any ordinary one-star cultivator can master? I find it odd that you, a ghost, wouldn’t have prepared against it.”

He was equally baffled as to why the Ghost General would simply wrap him in that cloak, giving him the perfect opportunity to unleash *Palm Thunder*.

Ordinary cultivators can master this spell? Master it, my foot!

The Ghost General wanted to roar in frustration—if mastering *Palm Thunder* was that easy, would there be any room left for ghost cultivators in this world?

If a mere one-star cultivator could unleash such power, a single blow would severely injure or even annihilate a two-star Ghost General. How could their kind possibly survive?

A thought struck Scholar Song as he looked at the *Palm Thunder* in his hand. Could it be that Venerable White had modified the technique for him?

Well, whatever the case, the fact that he could use *Palm Thunder* was enough! He would just have to thank Venerable White later.

For now, he needed to deal with this Ghost General!

Scholar Song casually pulled out a *Demon-Breaking Talisman*.

“Now spill it, where’s your master hiding? Or tell me where the subordinates of the lord are. I know this is their hideout,” he said, smiling as he pointed the talisman at the Ghost General.

The Ghost General looked at the talisman in terror—he could sense a terrifying aura emanating from it. If this talisman were activated, he would stand no chance of survival.

“If you answer honestly, I might just let you live,” Scholar Song said, not bothering to hide his intentions. A Ghost General was worth something; he was considering taking this one with him.

“Your target is the subordinates of the lord?” The remaining bits of the Ghost General shrank back, trying to avoid the terrifying talisman. “If that’s the case, there’s no need for us to fight. All of the lord’s subordinates are already dead.”

“Dead?” Scholar Song paused for a moment.

Then, he quickly considered a possibility—since the lord established the *Three-Clawed Beast* organization, he must have gathered many vengeful and evil spirits in addition to the spirit ghosts. He had dreamt of these memories before.

Those ghosts were sealed while the lord was alive, but after his death, if his subordinates broke those seals...

“Did you kill all the subordinates?” Scholar Song asked, his smile softening.

“Yes,” the Ghost General gulped, confirming.

Scholar Song sighed inwardly—his goal in finding the lord’s subordinates was to inquire about which branch of the Wuji Demon Sect the *Sunflower Cultivator* belonged to.

There was no way he could handle such a massive sect on his own, but he could pass that information on to Sable Seven of the Su Clan. However, he didn’t expect that all of the lord’s subordinates would be wiped out.

Sometimes fate just didn’t play in your favor.

At the same time, he also deduced why the ghosts had been absorbing the life force of the villagers; most of them were in a weakened state after being sealed. They could only secretly drain the vitality from the villagers. It seemed they planned to absorb just enough before escaping the area.

“So, one last question—recently, did the lord’s subordinates cooperate with a *Sunflower Cultivator*? Do you know anything about that cultivator’s background?” Scholar Song asked in a serious tone.

The Ghost General shook its head. When they broke free, they had killed all of the lord’s subordinates. Even a few members who went out on missions were lured back and slain.

As for any recent cooperation with anyone, the Ghost General genuinely had no idea.

Scholar Song frowned, pondering for a moment. He then pulled out his phone and quickly typed out a message.

**Ninefold Land Group.**

**Scholar Song:** "Is any senior online? I’ve captured a Ghost General and need advice on how to seal or bind it."

**Seven Lives of Talisman Master:** "You can use some ghost-catching artifacts, like the Hundred Ghost Flag, Ghost Soul Ring, or Ghost Catching Bottle.” He replied absently, distracted by how to help the islanders better combine words after learning new terms.

For instance, the islanders often confused the usage of “de, di, de”—and honestly, Scholar Song himself often mixed them up too.

So, the Talisman Master had been online frequently lately, asking for advice.

**Scholar Song:** "I have a Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl?"

**Seven Lives of Talisman Master:** "That’s for sealing spirit ghosts; spirit ghosts and ordinary Ghost Generals are different." He chuckled.

**Scholar Song:** "Is there any other method?"

**Seven Lives of Talisman Master:** "There are sealing spells, but you can’t use them at your level right now." 

**Scholar Song:** "So, I can't do anything about it?" He sighed, knowing this was a possibility, but still held onto a glimmer of hope that someone might have a suggestion.

Since he couldn’t subdue this Ghost General... should he just kill it? However, before killing it, he needed to brace himself. At the very least, he needed a plan to ensure no other ghosts would go berserk and attack the village.

What should he do? Scholar Song pondered furiously.

Just then, as the thought of killing the Ghost General crossed his mind, the Phantom Spirit in his heart suddenly seemed to receive a command and shot out!

Indeed, the Phantom Spirit had received a command. Its synchronization with Scholar Song hadn’t been fully completed yet, and their connection was still intermittent.

So, when Scholar Song thought about “killing” the Ghost General, the Phantom Spirit received the command, but not the latter part of his thought.

“Roar!” The Phantom Spirit emerged, revealing a golden short sword in its hand. This was one of the new abilities it had gained after restoring to a mid-tier spirit ghost—one shield for defense and one sword for offense.

With a swift motion, the golden short sword swung down, slicing the weakened and heavily injured Ghost General into pieces.

“No... if you kill me, my companions will seek revenge! Not just you, the entire village will be turned to hell!” The Ghost General let out a scream of hatred as it died.

It had originally thought that as a Ghost General, even in a weakened state, it could escape from a one-star cultivator, but it never expected this little cultivator to have such diverse methods, including powerful talismans and this terrifying Phantom Spirit. Could this cultivator be the illegitimate child of a renowned sect leader?

“Devour!” The Phantom Spirit opened its mouth and swallowed the shattered Ghost General. It then let out a contented burp before returning to Scholar Song’s heart.

Scholar Song stood there, hand gripping the *Demon-Breaking Talisman*, frozen in disbelief...

Director, this isn’t how the plot was supposed to go!

What if, when hundreds or thousands of vengeful ghosts attacked the village, what would he do?

He could protect a small area, but he couldn’t defend an entire village!

Have I really gotten myself into trouble this time?
