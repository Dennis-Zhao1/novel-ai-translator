**Refining the Body Strengthening Elixir!**

The entire process of boiling the elixir's ingredients was set to last nearly four hours. Would the induction cooker hold up? Scholar Song couldn’t help but feel a twinge of worry.

Through the reinforced glass lid of the hot pot, he could see slices of ginseng swirling in the water, and a wave of inexplicable excitement surged within him—was this what alchemy felt like?

Yes, indeed, this was alchemy.

But why did it feel so much like boiling noodles?

Was it simply his unconventional approach?

His phone was set to stopwatch mode, and while he kept a vigilant eye on the ginseng slices in the pot, he frequently checked the time on his phone.

Five minutes passed…

He immediately lifted the lid and tossed in the second ingredient, goji berries.

The two ingredients rolled around in the boiling water, quietly tinting it with a faint yellow hue.

Temperature and timing—these were things that required experience. 

And experience was something Scholar Song sorely lacked.

So, all he could do was keep an eye on the time, adding ingredients every five minutes. As for the temperature? Let the induction cooker do its thing.

"It really isn’t much different from brewing traditional Chinese medicine," he mused.

What would his mood be like if, after three hours, he ended up with just a bowl of ordinary herbal soup?

Would this simplified prescription for the Body Strengthening Elixir shatter his worldview built over eighteen years? Or would it extinguish his recent dreams of cultivation?

As the heat in the hot pot intensified, the temperature in the kitchen rose.

At that moment, a refreshing chill emanated from the icy bead around his neck, sending a wave of coolness through him. Not only did it refresh him, but it also sharpened his mind. Before he knew it, he had entered an incredibly focused state.

He gently squeezed the icy bead resting against his chest.

This extraordinary bead filled him with newfound confidence regarding the elixir.

“Please don’t let me down. If it’s possible, even if the potion fails, at least let me witness the true existence of 'cultivation'.”

As he held the third ingredient, a calmness washed over him, only slightly disturbed. This third ingredient was something he couldn’t even find online—Morning Dew Mystic Grass!

At first glance, the Morning Dew Mystic Grass didn’t look much different from ordinary grass; they were both green and strap-like plants. However, a closer inspection revealed that the grass was covered in a mist that lingered, reminiscent of morning dew on leaves.

The numbers on the stopwatch flickered rapidly, and the five minutes were up!

Scholar Song lifted the lid and tossed in the Morning Dew Mystic Grass, swiftly covering the pot again.

He felt a flicker of anticipation; after all, this was a unique ingredient that might trigger some special changes among the other herbs.

Like the previous two ingredients, the Morning Dew Mystic Grass joined the fray, swirling in the boiling water.

Scholar Song’s eyes remained glued to the grass, and the icy bead at his chest sent refreshing sensations coursing through him, intensifying his mental focus like never before!

Gradually, the three ingredients in the pot expanded before his eyes!

In that moment, there was nothing in Scholar Song's world except for the herbs—everything else faded into the background.

Whether it was due to his extreme focus or the bead's unique properties, he began to perceive every subtle change in the boiling water and the three ingredients.

With each roll, a faint yellow essence was extracted from the ingredients, blending into the herbal concoction. As the ginseng slices released their essence, they swelled slightly in the water.

It was a truly wondrous sensation!

“Does it feel like the heat isn’t quite enough?” Scholar Song suddenly had this thought.

He sensed that the ingredients needed a stronger heat, especially the Morning Dew Mystic Grass, which required a higher temperature to fully unleash its potential!

With that, he pressed the temperature control on the induction cooker without hesitation, cranking up the heat.

The water boiled more vigorously, and the lid rattled from the steam.

Scholar Song’s eyes widened in amazement—after increasing the heat, the Morning Dew Mystic Grass truly began to change!

The grass, which had been floating on the surface, suddenly dissolved!

He had no idea how long it would take to cook a piece of ordinary grass to mush, but under five minutes, even with the induction cooker cranked to the max, there was no way it could have melted the Morning Dew Mystic Grass.

This was due to the grass’s unique properties.

As the grass dissolved, a layer of emerald-green liquid infused the herbal broth. This vibrant liquid seemed almost sentient, wrapping around the ginseng slices and goji berries.

Once the two ingredients were enveloped, they too began to slowly dissolve, melding into that verdant liquid.

Scholar Song’s heartbeat quickened slightly.

What a miraculous transformation!

At the same time, he vaguely guessed that perhaps the Body Strengthening Elixir didn’t initially require added water; instead, it needed the ingredients to be heated using a special method. The moment the Morning Dew Mystic Grass was added, it could release the herbal essence.

He still wasn’t sure if the concoction had failed.

Fortunately, he had prepared himself for failure long ago; this round of alchemy was mainly to familiarize himself with the process and take notes on any issues that arose.

Five more minutes passed.

This time, Scholar Song calmly retrieved the fourth ingredient and tossed it into the pot.

The fourth ingredient was similarly enveloped by the emerald liquid, slowly dissolving into it.

“Under this level of heat, it roughly takes around five minutes for the fourth ingredient to fully blend into the potion. This is likely why the alchemist mentioned 'about' five minutes. Variances in ingredient size, shape, and age; differences in heat and the quality of the alchemical furnace all contribute to fluctuations in the time frame.” Scholar Song kept his eyes locked on the pot, gaining deeper insights.

His understanding of the alchemist’s prescription deepened.

The progress he was making stemmed largely from the effects of the icy bead around his neck. It brought him a tranquil mind, focused concentration, and crystal-clear thoughts.

On the other hand, Scholar Song seemed to possess a natural intuition for alchemy. This was an innate talent; if he were to pursue a career as an alchemist, this gift would allow him to achieve more with less effort.

As his grasp on the alchemist's prescription grew clearer, Scholar Song no longer confined himself to a strict five-minute limit.

He began to decide when to add the next ingredient based on the degree of fusion in the potion. Sometimes, he’d toss in the next ingredient at four and a half minutes; other times, he’d extend it beyond five minutes.

Before he realized it, forty-six minutes had flown by.

As he added the tenth ingredient, he started experimenting with the heat control. He adjusted the temperature of the induction cooker based on the potion’s fusion level, carefully tuning it up or down.

He no longer fixated solely on the timer, engrossed in the process.

After adding the sixteenth ingredient, the fusion capacity of the Morning Dew Mystic Grass reached its limit. At that moment, according to the prescription, Scholar Song added yet another special ingredient—Three Lives Fruit Seed.

Just as with the Morning Dew Mystic Grass, the Three Lives Fruit Seed assumed the role of a new 'fusion ingredient.'

From the very beginning, after adding a ladle of water, Scholar Song hadn’t added any more. Remarkably, after an hour and a half of simmering, the potion in the hot pot had not only retained its volume but had slightly increased.

Adding ingredients, monitoring the fusion of the liquid, and waiting; it was a tedious and mind-numbingly dull process, yet it allowed for not a single moment of carelessness.

This was the life of an alchemist—a demanding profession that required perfection, one that even among cultivators was rare, reserved for those who could truly endure solitude.
