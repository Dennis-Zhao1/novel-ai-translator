**Standing Unbeaten!**

Scholar Song recounted his speculation to the Alchemical Sage.

“So you suspect that the intruder in your room yesterday might be the owner of that Phantom Spirit, or perhaps a cultivator who, upon accidentally encountering your Phantom Spirit, decided to take advantage of the situation?” The Alchemical Sage nodded thoughtfully.

“Fay Yu is the daughter of the Spirit Butterfly Sovereign you mentioned, right?” Jiang Ziyan said with a chuckle, shaking her head. It was clear she found it amusing how generous the girl was—giving away a Phantom Spirit like that.

For someone at her level of cultivation, having a Phantom Spirit was a significant treasure. But for her current needs, a mid-tier Phantom Spirit didn’t seem that useful anymore.

“What are you planning to do?” The Alchemical Sage looked at Scholar Song and asked.

Scholar Song sighed, “To be honest, if they were only targeting me, I wouldn’t be too worried.”

In fact, the existence of those individuals would even bring him a bit of joy, giving him extra motivation during his cultivation sessions.

“However, I heard that someone offered money to have students from Jiangnan University gather information about me and my friends. I’m concerned that these people might resort to any means necessary to harm my loved ones.”

His current strength was still insufficient to protect his friends and family. This was also why the Hermit of North River had advised him not to reveal his identity as a ‘cultivator’ until he was strong enough to safeguard those close to him.

But the problem was, he hadn’t disclosed his ‘cultivator’ identity, yet trouble had somehow found him!

He couldn’t help but feel wronged.

Jiang Ziyan laughed, “Scholar, how about I take care of the Phantom Spirit for you? Let those guys come after me; I’ll deal with them one by one!”

As soon as she finished speaking, the Alchemical Sage flicked her forehead with his finger, “Don’t come up with such ideas. This Phantom Spirit holds significant meaning for Scholar Song. Once he completes his foundation-building and gathers the materials needed for the contract formation, he’ll be able to sign with this Phantom Spirit.”

With this Phantom Spirit, even if he missed the ‘optimal time for foundation-building’ and lacked the protection of innate true qi, Scholar Song would still have a chance to catch up with the talented disciples of the sects. Without the Phantom Spirit, however, his path as a cultivator would become three to five times more arduous.

Scholar Song’s eyes brightened slightly.

Jiang Ziyan rubbed her forehead and made a silly face, “I was just joking! Besides, this Phantom Spirit doesn’t hold any value for me right now.”

Scholar Song said solemnly, “So I must find out who is behind this. And no matter what it takes, I have to deal with them.”

“What if their strength far exceeds yours? How do you plan to handle that?” The Alchemical Sage reminded him.

In fact, their power was indeed far greater than Scholar Song’s.

“Once I track them down…” Scholar Song held the Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl and asked tentatively, “Alchemical Sage, may I ask, if I offer this Phantom Spirit as a reward, could you help me deal with them?”

For the safety of his friends and family, he was willing to part with such a valuable item!

The Alchemical Sage smiled appreciatively. Scholar Song chose the safety of his loved ones over the Phantom Spirit. For some cultivators, this decision might seem foolish, but the Alchemical Sage admired Scholar Song’s choice.

However, he shook his head, “I’m afraid I can’t help you. I’m not particularly skilled in combat. Besides, your enemy might be lurking in the shadows. I don’t have much experience tracking down hidden foes. But…”

He didn't need the Phantom Spirit.

“There are many senior members in the group who have younger disciples that would love to help. If you’re willing to offer just this Phantom Spirit as a reward, I’m sure many seniors would come from afar to assist you in dealing with the hidden enemy. I can guarantee that,” the Alchemical Sage said with a smile.

“In that case, I feel more at ease,” Scholar Song carefully tucked away the ‘Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl.’

At least with this Phantom Spirit, he wouldn’t find himself in a desperate situation.

He had a fallback; this battle had already put him in an unbeatable position.

“However, unless you’re left with no other options, I wouldn’t recommend trading away this Phantom Spirit,” the Alchemical Sage added.

“Why is that, Senior?” Scholar Song asked, puzzled.

“This Phantom Spirit is extremely important for you. I haven’t yet explained the foundation-building knowledge to you. Simply put, you’ve already missed the best age for foundation-building. But with this Phantom Spirit, you’ll at least be able to reach the starting point of cultivation on par with normal cultivators, allowing you to go further in your journey. If you lose this Phantom Spirit, you might struggle to advance even at the second-tier realm. For you, this Phantom Spirit is like an entry token to the path of cultivation,” the Alchemical Sage explained.

“But I have no other options,” Scholar Song replied. He was just an ordinary student, without the backing of a strong force. Other than offering the Phantom Spirit as a reward, he had nothing else to entice the seniors in the group to help him.

“Your enemy may not be as powerful as you think. If their strength falls within the first-tier realm, then you have a chance to contend. In fact, it could be a good opportunity for you to hone your skills. Meanwhile, before you find your enemy, seek help from all sides,” the Alchemical Sage smiled, squinting his eyes. “Remember, unless absolutely necessary, do not trade away your Phantom Spirit.”

“Thank you, Senior,” Scholar Song nodded. At the very least, he needed to identify the hidden enemy. Otherwise, everything was just empty talk.

Just then, Jiang Ziyan burst into laughter, “Scholar, you really are an interesting guy! By the way, Teacher, do you need my help with anything recently?”

“Oh, just bringing over the alchemy furnace would be enough,” the Alchemical Sage chuckled, his hair swaying like a jungle of braids.

“Then I must be quite free, huh? If that’s the case, I’ll go do something fun!” Jiang Ziyan grinned mischievously, licking her lips enticingly.

Scholar Song realized that this wicked smile suited Jiang Ziyan perfectly. When she smiled, there was a wicked charm about her, like a blazing flame drawing moths that knew it was dangerous but still rushed toward it without hesitation.

Perhaps sensing she had smiled too much, she quickly covered her mouth and let out a cheeky laugh before leaping out the window and disappearing swiftly, leaving Scholar Song wondering what she intended to do.

The Alchemical Sage shook his head with a smile as he moved his alchemy furnace to a suitable spot.

……

……

“By the way, Alchemical Sage, I’d like to ask how to detect if someone is following me and how to stay vigilant,” Scholar Song requested earnestly.

After experiencing this incident, he knew he had much to learn. He enjoyed the thrill of danger, but he preferred that over lying in bed and being stabbed to death.

“These are just some daily tips for cultivators; they’re easy to master. Just wait a moment,” the Alchemical Sage said as he took out his phone and logged into a chat application. Then, he opened the group space of the Ninefold Land Number One group.

Inside the group space, a variety of strange documents were visible.

“Functions and diagrams of modern appliances—air conditioners, televisions, computers, cell phones, refrigerators, rice cookers… etc.”

“How to quickly master smartphone shortcuts.”

“Fellow cultivator has been in seclusion for over fifty years; for exit-related matters, please contact＊＊＊＊＊.”

“If you need to exchange gold or other items for universal currency, please contact＊＊＊＊＊.”

“Things cultivators need to note in modern society: with the rapid development of technology, ten methods to quickly integrate into society. Don’t let ordinary people notice anything unusual.”

“The basic rules of traffic safety: remember not to damage cars on the road. Attachment: photos of various car shapes. P.S.: This is a traffic tool, like a carriage, not a monster.” — Not don’t get hit by a car, but don’t crash into them! Scholar Song was curious about which senior cultivator mistook a car for a monster. Did they try to capture the car, or did they ‘kill’ it?

“Plans and precautions for selecting a seclusion location—don’t let the tragedy of Master Xian Gong happen again.”
