**Another Luo Xin District**

Scholar Song found himself in the Jiangnan region, and with his kind-hearted nature, he certainly wouldn’t refuse to help someone find their way. However, even if he wanted to assist, he was currently at a loss. The university town was a two-hour drive from Jiangnan Airport, and considering Jiangnan was a county-level city, it covered a vast area.

Moreover, Song was unfamiliar with J City, and he had never even heard of the Ghost Lantern Temple.

All he knew was that J City was adjacent to the Jiangnan region and was quite a famous city in the Middle Land.

It was renowned as a hub for various religions, where numerous faiths could bewilder anyone. During religious festivals, the influx of pilgrims would turn the entire city into a bustling sea of humanity.

The temples there were as numerous as the stars in the sky, making it no easy task to locate a small temple in such a place.

“Speaking of which, the name ‘Luo Xin District’ sounds so familiar, as if I’ve heard it somewhere before,” Song murmured to himself.

While munching on a bun, Scholar Song leaned back in his rocking chair, his mind racing to connect the dots about ‘Luo Xin District,’ trying to grasp the source of that inexplicable familiarity.

The human brain is quite peculiar; sometimes memories resurface unexpectedly, yet when you try to grasp them, they slip through your fingers.

“Maybe I heard it in some news article?” Song shrugged, deciding not to waste any more brain cells on this puzzling question.

Fay Yu dragged her large suitcase to the taxi stand.

Before long, several taxis sped toward her—evidence that a pretty face is an undeniable advantage no matter where you are. Otherwise, just the size of her massive suitcase would have made many drivers think twice about picking her up.

“Miss, where to?” the first red taxi pulled up, driven by a sturdy-looking middle-aged man with a square face and a Jiangnan accent.

“Driver… do you know where the Ghost Lantern Temple is?” Fay asked, her voice soft and delicate, a stark contrast to her vibrant youthful appearance. This contrast only added to her charm.

The square-faced driver thought long and hard before shaking his head. “Ghost Lantern Temple? Never heard of it.”

Seeing the driver shake his head, Fay’s heart sank, her cheeks flushing with disappointment.

Fortunately, the driver quickly followed up with another question: “Do you know which district it’s in?”

“Yes! It’s in Luo Xin District!” Fay replied eagerly.

“Luo Xin District? I know that area well; I live nearby. But miss, are you sure about the name of the temple? I’ve been living there for several years and have never heard of Ghost Lantern Temple,” the driver replied earnestly.

He knew the area like the back of his hand due to his profession. Especially in his neighborhood, it would be an exaggeration to say he hadn’t stepped foot on every inch of land, yet the name of Ghost Lantern Temple was entirely foreign to him.

“Oh?” Fay’s face turned a deeper shade of red, but she quickly regained her composure. “In that case, could you take me to Luo Xin District?”

She planned to ask the locals for directions once she arrived there. If all else failed… she would have to muster the courage to call her father. But that was her last resort, one she hoped to avoid.

“Miss, are you in a hurry? If not, you could take a bus to Luo Xin District. A taxi would be a bit pricey; it’s over two hours of travel,” the square-faced driver explained.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to make the fare, but after two hours of driving, the cost would be significant. Clearly, the girl didn’t understand the distance, and if they didn’t clarify the cost beforehand, it could lead to disputes upon arrival.

“It’s fine, just take me there,” Fay said with a shy smile. Money wasn’t an issue for her.

The driver’s heart lifted upon hearing that. This ride would be quite profitable.

“Alright then, hop in. Let’s get that suitcase in the trunk,” he said, opening the trunk and preparing to help lift the massive suitcase.

After all, it was a huge piece of luggage, and this small girl surely didn’t have the strength to hoist it up.

However, when the driver turned back after opening the door, his jaw dropped in disbelief and remained that way for a long moment.

He watched as the seemingly delicate girl effortlessly lifted the enormous suitcase with one hand, as if she were holding a small plate, placing it gently into the trunk.

Could it be that the suitcase looked massive but was actually lightweight?

Just as he pondered this, he felt the back of the car dip slightly. After years of driving, he had reached a level of intuition where he could estimate the weight of what was inside just by the feel of the vehicle.

That suitcase must weigh over sixty kilograms, maybe even more—about the weight of an adult male!

Was this girl a weightlifter? The driver swallowed hard, marveling at her extraordinary strength. Good thing he was just a kind-hearted driver; had he been someone with ill intentions, he would have been instantly subdued by this girl!

Fay had no idea how astonishing her casual action was. After placing the suitcase, she quickly returned to the back seat of the taxi.

“Miss, you’ve got some strength! Buckle up,” the square-faced driver chuckled, pressing the gas pedal as the red taxi pulled away from the curb, heading toward Luo Xin District.

**Jiuzhou No. 1 Group**

On Lingdie Island, Fay Yu (online): “Hermit of North River, I’m on my way to Luo Xin District, but the taxi driver has no idea about the Ghost Lantern Temple. I plan to ask the locals when I arrive; maybe someone will know.”

“Okay, I asked a few people, but no one seems to know for now. I’ll contact you if I find anything,” the Hermit of North River replied.

“Thank you, senior.” Fay sent a smiley emoji, her heart calming a bit after receiving the Hermit’s response—after all, this was her first time traveling alone. In the past, she had always been accompanied by her father or only moved around the areas near Lingdie Island.

It felt a bit thrilling.

……

……

Meanwhile, Scholar Song had yet to see this chat record… because he had nothing to do, he decided to visit a bookstore to read.

He picked up the thick book he borrowed last time, which he still hadn’t finished. For him, reading without lingering over the words felt significantly less enjoyable.

It was like eating the same instant noodles, where dry eating was completely different from enjoying them after they’ve been soaked.

Before leaving, he had absentmindedly brought his phone with him—Scholar Song generally didn’t have the habit of carrying a phone.

In today’s world, phones had become increasingly multifunctional, and their sizes had correspondingly grown larger. It was now nearly impossible to find a phone that only made calls. Because of this, Scholar Song treated this device more like a landline.

“Seven percent battery, that should be enough.”

Though the battery was low, it should last him through the afternoon for calls or texts.

With that thought in mind, he grabbed his phone and the borrowed book and set off to the bookstore, ready to enjoy some reading.

……

Time flew by.

About an hour and a half later…

“Strange, did I wake up in the wrong position this morning?” Scholar Song wondered aloud as he placed the thick book back on the shelf—he simply couldn’t focus!

No matter if it was novels, driving theory, comics, or classic literature, he couldn’t get into any of it. This was the first time in his life he had encountered such a situation.

“How bizarre.” Scholar Song murmured, sighing as he randomly pulled another book and headed to the rental desk.

If he couldn’t concentrate, then reading was pointless.

After thinking it over, he decided to stroll around the university town to clear his mind.

Speaking of clearing one’s mind, there was a renowned haven for food just nearby—Foodie Paradise.

Time for some delicious snacks!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Foodie Paradise was a bustling food district separated from Jiangnan University Town by two blocks, a twenty-minute walk. But that distance was nothing to stop food lovers.

Here, the sky was filled with winged creatures besides planes, and the ground was decked with four-legged animals alongside benches—anything you could crave could be found here.

This place had always been known as Foodie Paradise or Gourmet Heaven, with its original name long forgotten.

What was it called again?

Scholar Song looked up at the street sign—“Welcome to Luo Xin District,” the seven brilliant golden characters sparkled under the sun.

Oh right, it’s called Luo Xin District. What a nice name.

As he pondered this, he stepped into the district.

He took a few steps before stopping abruptly. He quickly retreated back beneath the grand sign, staring intently at the seven shining golden words.

Welcome to Luo Xin District!

He wasn’t mistaken; it really was the Luo Xin District.

Scholar Song was left speechless.
