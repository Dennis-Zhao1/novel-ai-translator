“……” Master of Snow Wolf Cavern.

“……” The Dharma King of Creation.

“……” Lord of the Seven Life Talismans.

“……” The Alchemical Sage.

“Is this really the Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram? It can't be Wild Blade of Three Tides messing with him again, right?” Drunken Moon Scholar asked, puzzled. He remembered that while the Master Diviner had always been known for his dark predictions, he wouldn’t go this far.

“Ha ha.” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain chuckled.

[System Notification: (＊＊＊＊＊＊) Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram has been muted for 1 day by group leader Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.]

Ever since the last time the Master Diviner posted that video of Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain receiving Venerable White, he had walked further down the path of self-destruction, with no chance of turning back.

“If it weren't for my attempts at refining body-enhancing elixirs, just looking at these chat logs, who would believe this is a group of genuine cultivators having a conversation?” Scholar Song mused inwardly.

However, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain had asked the ‘Lychee Fairy’ to post more beautiful photos in the group chat, repeatedly reminding him to appreciate more beautiful women and think about lovely girls.

Could it be that Immortal Sage is worried I’m being influenced by Venerable White? Scholar Song thought to himself.

If Venerable White’s unique charm were to be unleashed, it would be unstoppable. Even when he had been sealed within the statue, the allure he unconsciously radiated during his meditation had caused a frenzy among countless young men and women, even middle-aged aunties and uncles. It even led to a massive brawl at the ‘Nameless Temple’ in Linyao Village.

But now, Venerable White had learned to control his own charm. As long as he didn’t space out, he was just a handsome man, and there shouldn’t be any problems, right?

Perhaps Immortal Sage and the others still don’t know that Venerable White can now control his own allure?

“By the way, is Young Scholar Song online?” Suddenly, Master of Snow Wolf Cavern spoke up.

Scholar Song quickly replied, “I’m here, senior. I just logged on.”

“Haha, Young Scholar Song, when are you going to take Venerable White to get a bank card? Venerable White contacted me a few days ago, saying he wanted to exchange some valuables for current currency. Once you get him a bank card, I’ll transfer a few million to him for emergencies.” Master of Snow Wolf Cavern laughed.

A few million for emergencies? Scholar Song immediately recalled the ten million in phone credits on his phone…

But he quickly replied, “Sure, I’ll make time to take Venerable White to get a bank card as soon as possible.”

But why is Venerable White suddenly thinking about cash? Does he need to buy something?

Just as Scholar Song was pondering this, Dou Dou made a gentle leap and landed on the ground.

“We’re home,” Dou Dou called out.

Scholar Song reluctantly climbed down from Dou Dou and pulled out his keys to open the door.

“Hmm? Why won’t the door open?” Scholar Song questioned, twisting the key, but the door wouldn’t budge.

He pulled the key out and looked at it—this was definitely the key to the front door.

“Could the lock be broken?” Scholar Song bent down to examine the door key—was there evidence that the lock had been tampered with?

Was that just his imagination?

“Anyway, it’s okay; Venerable White should be home,” Scholar Song said, reaching out to press the doorbell.

Ding ding dong~~ ding ding dong~~

The pleasant sound of the doorbell rang out.

“……” But Scholar Song stood there in shock for quite a while, looking at Dou Dou and asking, “Dou Dou, if I remember correctly, shouldn’t the doorbell of this building sound like ‘ding ding ding~ ding ding ding~’?”

Dou Dou rolled her eyes, “I’ve never used the doorbell since I got here.”

“That’s true; you haven’t heard the doorbell. Could it be that I remembered it wrong?” Scholar Song muttered.

Soon, Venerable White opened the door, smiling brightly, “Welcome back, Young Scholar Song.”

“Um, senior, it seems the lock on the front door is broken; the key won’t work. I’ll find someone to come fix it later,” Scholar Song casually mentioned.

“Broken? Hahaha~ alright,” Venerable White maintained his almost perfect smile.

“Also, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain called earlier. He said the car he ordered has started arriving at an underground parking lot near Jiangnan University Town. Someone will contact me shortly to let us go inspect the vehicles,” Scholar Song said as he walked upstairs.

“Cars, transportation? Great, I’m looking forward to it,” Venerable White replied with delight.

As they spoke, Scholar Song passed the third floor where Venerable White lived and noticed a guest in the living room. It was a cute girl with a hint of baby fat, but she looked stiff and uncomfortable, clearly out of place.

“A guest of Venerable White?” Scholar Song inquired.

“No,” Venerable White shook his head. “She’s from the Empty Thief Sect, here to steal your Blood God Diamond, but I caught her. I’m planning to take her to retrieve my Meteor Sword in a few days.”

“Oh, the Leaving Immortal Sword!” Scholar Song remembered Venerable White mentioning that the sword had been stolen by a disciple of the Empty Thief Sect.

Looking at the adorable girl, Scholar Song stroked his chin, “Will she try to escape?”

Moreover, leaving her alone in the house—wouldn’t she sneak into his room and steal the Blood God Diamond?

“Maybe we should tie her up?” he suggested.

The cute girl shot a resentful glance at Scholar Song—damn it, she had actually considered sneaking away, but now, with all her escape routes cut off by Scholar Song, her plans were dashed.

Encountering a charming girl like me, can’t he show a bit of compassion?

Destined to be lonely for life! Damn it!

“Hmm, you make a good point,” Venerable White nodded.

And just like that, the cute girl was tied up tightly, and Venerable White even added a talisman to ensure she couldn't escape.

The girl glared fiercely at Scholar Song, immediately hating him to the core.

“Don’t look at me like that; you should be cautious around thieves,” Scholar Song chuckled, then took out a remote. “How about I turn on the TV for you so you won't be too bored?”

Watch TV? Upon hearing that, Venerable White felt a bit uneasy.

Scholar Song pressed the remote and gently turned on the TV.

Venerable White quickly performed a hand sign, and the screen of the ‘TV’ lit up, but it was just a blank screen with no program information.

“Hmm? Could it be a problem with the data cable?” Scholar Song scratched his head in confusion, trying a few buttons.

At that moment, Venerable White discreetly used his phone to search for live TV channels, tuning into CCTV-6’s program before secretly casting another hand sign.

The ‘TV’ screen lit up, revealing the CCTV-6 program that was currently playing a movie.

“Oh, we have a signal now,” Scholar Song said with a smile.

Venerable White secretly sighed in relief.

“Just watch the movie for a bit,” Scholar Song told the girl.

Then he stood up and walked toward the fridge. “Venerable White, do you want something to eat? I bought a lot of delicious food from the Luoxin District a few days ago. It just needs to be heated in the microwave.”

Though the fridge had been magically modified by Venerable White, it still worked well for cooling.

Hearing the mention of the microwave, Venerable White pressed his hands to his forehead and sighed.

If only he had known, he would have just taken apart something on another floor…
