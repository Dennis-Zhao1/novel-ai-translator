**A Thousand Miles to Deliver Gear, Gifts Heavier Than Bonds!**

The seal on the Soul Sealing Ice Pearl remained unbroken!

The Phantom Spirit could only manifest due to the powers of the ‘Ghost Dragon's Tears,’ temporarily emerging from the confines of the Soul Sealing Ice Pearl. However, once the Ghost Dragon's Tears were fully consumed, the Phantom Spirit would be sealed back inside the pearl. Therefore, it was crucial to form a contract with the Phantom Spirit before the Ghost Dragon's Tears ran out.

Once the Phantom Spirit appeared, it looked around in confusion. Its gaze quickly landed on the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar’ array on the ground. Although it didn’t recognize the formation, its instincts told it that this array was not friendly!

As a mid-tier Phantom Spirit, it possessed a certain level of intelligence. Realizing its dire situation, it began to struggle violently.

“Wah wah~” The Phantom Spirit emitted sounds akin to a child crying, viciously charging toward Scholar Song. It recognized that Scholar Song was the one controlling the array; if it could take him out, the array would cease to function!

“Rise!” Scholar Song remained calm, issuing a firm command. He then formed hand seals and gently slapped his palms against the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar.’

When his palms struck down, the Five Elements Stones and various materials representing the five elements within the array lit up, transforming into a cylindrical barrier of light that firmly bound the Phantom Spirit within the array.

The Phantom Spirit collided fiercely against the barrier, making a ‘clang clang’ sound. However, the seemingly thin cylindrical barrier was unbreakable; no matter how violently the Phantom Spirit thrashed or clawed, the barrier remained completely intact.

Frantically, the Phantom Spirit could only futilely thrash within the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar’ array…

“Let’s get started! We need to subdue the Phantom Spirit before the Ghost Dragon's Tears and the Five Elements Stones run out of energy! You have about an hour!” Venerable White reminded him.

“Understood!” Scholar Song continued to chant the incantation for the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar.’

Then, rising to his feet, he moved according to the Eight Trigrams stepping technique taught to him by Venerable White that morning, dancing around the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar.’

His current appearance resembled that of a ‘primitive tribal shaman’ performing a ritual dance—it looked rather silly.

But there was no alternative; that was how the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar’ worked. Unless he could create a new contract spirit array himself, he had no choice but to dance like a shaman.

After completing a circuit around the array, Scholar Song formed hand seals and chanted, “Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth—Metal Calamity!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the Five Elements Stone representing ‘Metal’ lit up!

In the next moment, a golden sword appeared above the Phantom Spirit’s head, crashing down upon it!

“Wah wah!” the Phantom Spirit cried out in alarm, quickly using its innate ability. A small golden shield was summoned, hovering above its head to block the golden sword.

The shield and sword were locked in a stalemate, producing a grating sound as neither side could gain the upper hand.

“Again!” Scholar Song continued to dance around the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar.’

Completing another circuit, he formed hand seals and shouted, “Wood Calamity, come!”

The Five Elements Stone representing the Wood element lit up in the array.

From the array, ten thorny vines erupted from the earth, wrapping around the Phantom Spirit. The sharp thorns pierced into its body, beginning to drain the spirit energy from the Phantom Spirit.

“Eek eek eek…” The Phantom Spirit cried out in pain, gradually becoming more translucent.

“Not done yet!” Scholar Song once more danced around the shamanic altar, completing another circuit before forming hand seals and shouting, “Water Calamity, move!”

The Five Elements Stone representing ‘Water’ lit up, and alongside the golden sword, silver raindrops began to fall. These silver droplets possessed terrifying corrosive properties. As they landed on the golden shield above the Phantom Spirit, they started to eat away at it, creating small holes.

The Phantom Spirit wailed helplessly, trapped with nowhere to escape; it could only condense one small shield, forcing it to endure the upcoming assaults.

“Fire Calamity, rise!” Scholar Song shouted again.

Golden flames erupted from nothingness, racing along the thorns and directly entering the Phantom Spirit’s body.

The Phantom Spirit writhed in agony but refused to give up the fight, struggling with all its might. It knew that if it stopped resisting, it would be truly done for!

“Last calamity, Earth Calamity! With five calamities upon you, submit to me, and you may escape this suffering!” Scholar Song bellowed, his voice booming like thunder in the Phantom Spirit’s ears.

The Phantom Spirit’s body began to petrify from the bottom up. However, the petrified areas were subjected to fire, rain, and the piercing thorns, flaking away piece by piece.

Its body grew smaller and weaker, yet it still refused to yield, struggling fiercely.

Scholar Song wasn’t in a rush; according to Venerable White's teachings, a Phantom Spirit wouldn’t stop resisting until the moment of death.

All five calamities were unleashed, and only about half an hour had passed.

What he needed was patience; for the next half hour, he would continue to chant incantations, tirelessly stepping through the Eight Trigrams to enhance the power of the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar,’ while being careful not to accidentally kill the Phantom Spirit…

The Phantom Spirit’s resistance grew weaker.

Now, it was a waiting game to see whether it would give in first or if the Ghost Dragon's Tears would run out!

“Submit to me, and you may escape the suffering of the five calamities!” After each circuit, Scholar Song would bellow, striking at the Phantom Spirit’s psyche, weakening its will.

His gaze was fixed on the Phantom Spirit within the array, waiting for the moment it was on the verge of death to present the contract.

The final step was a test of luck and skill in manipulating the formation.

The more skillful the manipulation, the better the timing for presenting the contract when the Phantom Spirit was at its weakest!

Then, if luck was on his side, he could complete the contract in one go.

If luck was poor, he would have to engage in a prolonged mental battle with the weakened Phantom Spirit, completely overwhelming it physically and mentally to finalize the contract.

If luck was really bad… if the Phantom Spirit lost consciousness before the contract was completed, it would retreat back into the ‘Soul Sealing Ice Pearl,’ and the contract would fail!

Venerable White was also focused—he feared that if he lost concentration and didn’t conceal his aura, it might affect Scholar Song. He was also assisting Scholar Song in maintaining the array, ready to intervene if anything went wrong.

The Phantom Spirit’s cries had become soft and feeble, no longer resembling a child's sharp wails, but rather the faint moans of a woman.

“Hang in there, just a little longer!” Scholar Song took a deep breath, feeling his heart race slightly.

Though the chances of success were slim, holding onto hope was human nature.

If he could successfully contract with the Phantom Spirit, it would be like having a double advantage in his cultivation, allowing him to gain the benefits of two training sessions in one!

Time ticked away…

Suddenly, Venerable White stood up abruptly, a look of confusion crossing his face.

Scholar Song caught sight of Venerable White’s puzzled expression and thought, Could it be that there’s something wrong with my array?

“Don’t lose focus; concentrate on the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar.’ You’re doing great; leave the rest to me,” Venerable White reassured him.

Then, Venerable White opened his mouth and exhaled, a blade of spiritual energy manifesting above Scholar Song’s head, firmly protecting him.

Once ready, Venerable White moved to the window and opened it.

Thirty seconds later…

With a ‘whoosh,’ a cyan figure shot toward Venerable White from afar.

It became clear that it was a man dressed in a cyan robe, surrounded by a giant sword of cyan light that enveloped him.

Bang! The giant sword aura surrounding the cyan-robed man crashed through the protective barrier set by the Alchemical Sage outside the building, bursting through the open window and landing beside Venerable White.

The cyan-robed man stumbled, and after a moment, he let out a pained scream: “Ah…”

Simultaneously, the giant sword aura around him shattered like glass, disappearing entirely.

As the sword aura dissipated, a small, blue sword spun in the air before embedding itself into the floor.

On the ground, the cyan-robed man’s face had turned pale, his eyes filled with resentment as he reached skyward, grasping at the air as if trying to hold onto something.

Gradually, his eyes lost focus, and his vision blurred.

Venerable White crouched down and gently placed a hand on him to check his condition. He sighed, “What’s your name? Do you have any last words?”

“Wandering cultivator, Li Tiansu,” the cyan-robed man forced out with great effort.

As soon as he finished speaking, his body began to crumble, turning into countless specks of light, completely vanishing from this world, leaving not a shred of flesh behind.

“Ding… crack…” With two sounds, as the cyan-robed man vanished, a worn bronze ring fell to the ground.

And there was also the lonely blue short sword still embedded in the floor—a testament to the existence of the cyan-robed man.

Venerable White let out a quiet sigh.

This wandering cultivator was a fifth-grade Spirit Monarch, a skilled Gold Core level expert. Even in a major sect, he could have been a respected elder or peak master.

However, he had unknowingly encountered a great calamity, forcing him to use his full power to escape.

Yet even with his escape technique, it hadn’t saved his life. While using it, he suffered a lethal blow that randomly transported him here, where the cyan-robed cultivator met his demise.

All that remained was a bronze ring and a blue short sword.

Venerable White picked up the bronze ring and the short sword.

Inside the bronze ring were three solidified spell arrays. One was likely a second-grade fire attack spell, another a second-grade healing spell, and the last was a rather effective spirit gathering formation that could condense spiritual energy around a cultivator.

It was tough for wandering cultivators, and even a fifth-grade Gold Core cultivator had to rely on this kind of second or third-grade equipment for the sake of that ‘spirit gathering formation.’

Venerable White inspected the short sword again; it was of decent quality and could barely be used for sword flight.

Until he retrieved his own flying sword, the short sword could serve as a means of transport, Venerable White thought to himself.

At that moment, Scholar Song suddenly shouted from behind, “Senior, help me!”

Just after the wandering cultivator’s body had transformed into light particles and vanished, the Phantom Spirit within the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar’ suddenly surged with vitality, as if it had consumed a potent elixir, going from a state of near death to one filled with vigor, looking as if it was about to break free from the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar’…
