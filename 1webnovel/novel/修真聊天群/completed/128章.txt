**Where is the Moon Blade Sect?**

Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan was wounded and simply couldn't catch up with the distant smoke ball, the little dog, and the man in the long coat. Gritting her teeth, she dialed A-Qi's number again using Scholar Song's phone—Come on, connect already, A-Qi!

In the sky, the smoke ball transformed from the Demon Monarch An Zhi was being relentlessly pursued by that little Pekingese demon dog. This little demon dog was of unknown origin but possessed incredible strength.

An Zhi felt quite frustrated; he hadn’t provoked this little dog at all. Yet, as soon as they crossed paths, the dog charged at him, launching a personal attack.

He had clashed with it once and found that they were evenly matched.

He estimated that even if he went all out, it would still turn into a prolonged battle lasting several days before he could hope to subdue this demon dog. And he had no idea if the dog had any hidden tricks up its sleeve.

Right now, he had pressing matters to attend to—he didn't have time to waste tangling with a demon dog.

Can't afford to provoke it, but I can certainly dodge it! So, An Zhi accelerated his flying speed, trying to increase the distance between himself and the demon dog.

Meanwhile, Scholar Song felt like he was being gripped tightly by an invisible hand. As he soared through the clouds, he felt as though his insides were being squeezed out—what an unexpected disaster!

How unfortunate!

Behind him, the silly uncle was desperately chasing after them.

Previously, he had been lurking in the shadows, tracking Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan, hoping to capture her again once reinforcements from the Immortal Farmer Sect arrived. He hadn’t anticipated that An Zhi would suddenly drop from the sky, enveloping Sable Sixteen and Scholar Song in black smoke. Then he had grabbed someone and taken off.

In the distance, the Immortal Farmer Sect uncle could vaguely hear cries of “Su Clan junior” and “come with me.”

Sable Sixteen had been captured? This was serious! Without her, how would the Immortal Farmer Sect deal with A-Qi?

Thus, without a second thought, the Immortal Farmer Sect uncle sped towards the black smoke and the little Pekingese demon dog. His mind was singularly focused… he didn’t even bother to check who had been left behind, just following after An Zhi.

While pursuing, he summoned a talisman with a “thousand-mile transmission” function to contact the Immortal Farmer Sect's reinforcements, instructing them to lay an ambush ahead.

“Ambush that black smoke, and make sure to seize Sable Sixteen!” the Immortal Farmer Sect uncle gritted his teeth.

This time, there was no room for failure! They had to capture Sable Sixteen!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At this moment, not far from Jiangnan City, in a remote area engulfed in ghostly energy, a chilling atmosphere created a temporarily sealed space.

Inside this sealed space, A-Qi stood with his hands clasped behind his back, and his enchanted blade manifested a dense sea of swords reminiscent of the Milky Way.

Surrounding him were countless vengeful spirits, thousands of them, all having perished at A-Qi's hands.

“The Ten Thousand Ghosts Devouring Body Formation, quite an impressive feat,” A-Qi spoke in a deep voice.

This formation, famous among cultivators for its ability to "kill an elephant with a multitude of ants," had taken him nearly three hours to break through!

His opponent had come prepared, intending simply to delay him—their target was Sable Sixteen? Thinking of this, A-Qi's anger intensified.

Opposite him, the one who had set up the “Ten Thousand Ghosts Devouring Body Formation” was a woman clad in white.

Her entire body was tightly wrapped in bandages, resembling an ancient Egyptian mummy, revealing only a pair of black-red eyes. Moreover, there was a faint odor of decaying flesh emanating from her.

This was a special innate constitution, capable of naturally attracting spirits to her, allowing them to possess her body.

In ancient times, this kind of constitution was highly coveted by malevolent ghost cultivators. With such a constitution, there was no need to painstakingly seek out vengeful spirits; they would come to her doorstep unbidden, causing her cultivation to soar.

It was precisely because of this unique trait that this woman could unleash thousands of vengeful spirits without needing a treasure like the “Ten Thousand Ghost Banner,” relying solely on her physical body to create the Ten Thousand Ghosts Devouring Body Formation.

“Unfortunately, for one such as you, this formation can only temporarily hold you back,” the woman said, without a hint of emotion in her voice.

“Hmph.” A-Qi coldly snorted, swinging his enchanted blade in a horizontal arc. The blade's energy surged forth, striking an invisible barrier in the air and shattering it.

With the support of the vengeful spirits lost, the Ten Thousand Ghosts Devouring Body Formation was completely dismantled. The chilling ghostly energy dissipated, and the bodies of the vengeful spirits scattered into particles, vanishing from existence.

The woman let out a muffled groan; she had used her body to substitute for the “Ten Thousand Ghost Banner” to cast the formation. Now that the formation was broken, she naturally suffered backlash.

In the instant the formation shattered, A-Qi vanished from his original spot, reappearing behind the woman.

He held his enchanted blade against the back of her head.

A-Qi did not kill her; he intended to extract some information from her.

The woman, perhaps aware that escape was futile, showed no intention of fleeing.

Before A-Qi could even ask, she calmly stated, “The elder asked me to tell you that if you want to find Sable Sixteen, you should go to the Moon Blade Sect. My task was to delay you. In the time I held you back, Sable Sixteen has already been taken away by the elder’s people.”

A-Qi was furious. What was this Moon Blade Sect? Why were they causing him trouble? He had never even heard of such a small sect: “Where is the Moon Blade Sect?”

The bandaged woman shook her head. “I don’t know; I’ve never been to the Moon Blade Sect. My task is complete. You can do as you wish with me.”

“Insane!” A-Qi wasted no time, swinging his blade and cleaving through the woman’s head, blood spraying forth.

She fell softly to the ground, her life force fading.

Not even knowing the location, yet sending him to find the Moon Blade Sect—wasn't that just absurd?

But they had captured Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan…

Furious, A-Qi stomped down, creating a crater in the ground.

At that moment, a pleasant tune rang out… it wasn't the level-up sound effect from defeating monsters, but his phone ringing.

A-Qi pulled out his phone, only to find it was an unfamiliar number calling.

Was it that Moon Blade Sect guy?

He answered the call.

On the other end, he heard Sable Sixteen’s melodious voice: “Hello? A-Qi, I finally managed to get through to you!”

In an instant, the gloomy expression on A-Qi's face disappeared, his entire demeanor shifting from cloudy to sunny: “Sable Sixteen? Are you okay? I just got held up! Where are you now? Have you been attacked?”

“Jiangnan University City, East School Gate. I did encounter some attackers,” Sable Sixteen paused and then added, “But they caught the wrong person and took Scholar Song instead. Anyway, you need to hurry over here.”

The people from the Moon Blade Sect really were insane?

“I’m on my way! Stay safe. I’ll definitely be there in five minutes!” A-Qi gritted his teeth, and with a wave of his enchanted blade, he soared into the sky, transforming into a streak of light as he sped away like lightning.

……

……

In less than five minutes, A-Qi had arrived at the East Gate of Jiangnan University City.

He dispersed his light, withdrew the concealment spell around him, and landed swiftly from an uninhabited corner, quickly making his way to Sable Sixteen’s side.

“Sixteen!” A-Qi embraced Sable Sixteen tightly, then scanned her from head to toe, finally letting out a sigh of relief.
