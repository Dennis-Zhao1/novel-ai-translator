**A Western Monk, Shining Bright!**

“Hehe, why should I care about face? It's not like it can be eaten. And…” Scholar Song pointed at his own mouth and silently mouthed to the altar master, hidden from the Western monk's view, “I’m not a senior. I’m just an ordinary college student. What your subordinates found out is not wrong.”

Scholar Song had always believed that lying was wrong.

However, living in this world sometimes necessitates a little dishonesty, like telling a kind lie—such things are unavoidable.

Yet, Scholar Song thought that even kind lies should be explained when they can be revealed. To be human is to be honest with one another; it’s the foundation of trust between people!

“Chuh!” The altar master trembled violently, spitting out a mouthful of blood in fury.

“I curse you… I curse you! I will become a vengeful spirit, seeking your life for all eternity!” The altar master shouted in a fit of rage!

With his final shout, his breath ceased.

The altar master—was down for the count!

“This time, he’s definitely dead.” Scholar Song stood still for a moment, waiting until he felt secure, then gripped the ‘Armor Talisman’ and approached the altar master.

This time, the altar master was truly dead, with no chance of resurrection.

But just to be safe, Scholar Song raised his black flying sword and cleanly severed the altar master's head.

Jiang Ziyan had once warned him that cultivators have numerous ways to escape death, so to confirm one's demise, dismembering the body was the best approach. For a second-rank cultivator, decapitating them was usually sufficient.

The sword cut without a trace, blood not even touching the blade.

Scholar Song sighed quietly. In just two short days, he had already severed two heads. This time, he didn’t rely on the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’ but instead maintained his calm through sheer willpower.

He couldn’t always depend on the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’; the path of a cultivator was long, and some things he had to adapt to. Over-reliance on external tools would only make him weak.

And weakness, along with a wavering spirit, would get one nowhere on the path of a cultivator.

The altar master was the second cultivator to die at Scholar Song’s hands. Like the first, the long-armed man, although dead, the memory of his spirit would linger in Scholar Song’s mind for a long time. Though it would not last forever…

The incidents involving the Phantom Spirit and the altar master had come to a temporary close.

For a while, no one would dare to target his Phantom Spirit.

With the altar master dead, his subordinates were left in a state of disarray. This chaos would keep them occupied for quite some time, and they wouldn’t be able to stir up much trouble.

Moreover, the only people who knew that the altar master came to Jiang City University Town due to Scholar Song’s Phantom Spirit were the altar master himself, the long-armed man, and the assassin who entered Scholar Song’s room. With all three having met their demise, no one among the altar master’s subordinates knew about the connection between him and Scholar Song.

Even if they wanted revenge for their master, they would be at a loss for a while.

And as more time passed… these subordinates would no longer be a threat to Scholar Song. By then, even if they didn’t come looking for him, he would be the one seeking them out!

He lacked practical combat experience, and these guys, marked with beastly claw and head insignia, would serve as excellent training targets for him in the near future. Plus, they could provide him with some spoils—killing two birds with one stone!

“Good deeds and evil deeds will eventually have their recompense,” Scholar Song murmured softly as he took out some ‘Corpse Dissolving Water’ and poured a bit onto the altar master’s corpse.

A pungent smell wafted through the air… The altar master’s clothing melted away completely—yet his body remained intact.

“It can only dissolve the flesh of a first-rank cultivator? I thought it was a big treasure.”

This was going to be troublesome; leaving a dismembered body behind was not ideal. Even though the surveillance had been destroyed, the corpse would still attract the attention of the police.

Scholar Song felt a wave of frustration wash over him.

At that moment, the Western monk spoke up, “Are you troubled by this guy's body, senior?”

“Can you handle it?” Scholar Song turned around, wearing a gentle smile as he continued to maintain his lofty demeanor.

The Western monk gave him a thumbs-up. “Please don’t worry about this, senior! I can take care of it!”

“Since you say so, I’ll leave it to you. I’ll remember this favor,” Scholar Song replied, feeling relaxed.

“Please don’t mention it, senior! You saved my life; this little task is nothing!” The Western monk wore a confident expression, as if dealing with a corpse and subway troubles was nothing to him.

His self-assured demeanor reminded Scholar Song of the fantastical organizations like the ‘Huaxia Dragon Group,’ ‘Huaxia Powers Team,’ or ‘Huaxia Cultivator Alliance’ that often appear in web novels.

Perhaps this Western monk was a member of such an organization? He might even have a mysterious little red book on him, and when the police arrived, he could just whip it out and resolve everything!

Scholar Song thought to himself as he took a few steps forward to pick up the altar master’s small black box.

His instincts told him there would be something good inside.

After retrieving the box, he returned to the little girl’s family and sat down beside them.

Calculating the time, the passengers should be waking up from their stupor soon.

…

…

At this moment, the Western monk approached the altar master’s side and pressed his palms together, chanting, “Once all beings are liberated, I shall attain Bodhi; until hell is empty, I vow not to become a Buddha.”

This phrase was the great vow of the Bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha, and the Western monk seemed particularly fond of this declaration.

Then, he sat cross-legged beside the altar master’s corpse and began reciting the “Kṣitigarbha Sutra.” As he chanted, a rich aura of merit enveloped him once more.

In the front subway car and beside the altar master’s body, several souls could be faintly seen being guided by the Western monk.

As the souls were guided, a mysterious force divided into three and descended upon the Western monk.

In the next moment, the Western monk’s ‘merit light’ became even more solid; his vast mental power expanded; and his physical body was also enhanced!

Scholar Song widened his eyes slightly—guiding souls actually had such effects? It simultaneously strengthened the body, mental power, and merit!

Though it wasn’t as effective as consuming body refining liquid or practicing foundational martial arts.

But it was still a hundred times better than ordinary running or fitness!

“Note this down and ask the Alchemical Sage later if there are any methods for Daoist cultivators to guide souls that can enhance mental power and physical strength,” Scholar Song silently vowed.

He also began to vaguely understand why there were always virtuous monks in ancient times. They performed rites to guide souls without charging a dime and even went out of their way to find souls to guide. If you didn’t want them to guide souls, they might get mad. It seemed those virtuous monks were true disciples of Buddhism, just like this Western monk.

As he pondered, the passengers in the car began to wake one by one.

Everyone recalled having a terrifying nightmare, but the latter half of the nightmare turned peaceful.

“What happened?”

“I seem to remember the monk running back to the car, and then everything went dark—I can’t recall anything after that.”

“Where’s the monk?”

As the passengers exchanged thoughts, they quickly spotted the Western monk… and the altar master’s corpse, which had been chopped into five pieces.

Stunned… Silence.

Then came a wave of terrified screams.

“Someone’s dead, someone’s dead!”

“Ahhhh!” Passengers near the car door rushed to open it manually, not caring about what awaited them outside, as they screamed and fled.

Some people immediately vomited on the spot, while others simply fainted, their eyes rolling back.

If it had been an ordinary dead body, the crowd would have been desensitized by the news; they wouldn’t have panicked too much. But this was different—they had witnessed a dismemberment!

Simultaneously… screams echoed from the front car. There lay two of the altar master’s subordinates, torn to shreds by the Phantom Spirit, rendering them unrecognizable. This too sent the passengers fleeing in panic.

Beside Scholar Song, the white-shirted father, the young mother, and the little girl all regained consciousness.

The white-shirted father didn’t rush to exit; instead, he turned to Scholar Song, who sat next to them, and respectfully asked in a low voice, “Little brother, can we leave the car now?”

He sensed that this young man was also an extraordinary figure; after all, he had said “it’s too late” and advised them to stay with him and not to run around. Then, they had all blacked out…

“Go ahead. What happens next has nothing to do with us,” Scholar Song smiled and nodded, lifting the black handbag as he left the car, carefully avoiding the surveillance cameras.

Before re-entering the surveillance zone, he needed to disguise the black handbag.

One should never underestimate the power of modern technology; it could easily lead to him being linked to the police because of this box!

The white-shirted father picked up his daughter and followed suit, blending into the panicking crowd as they headed toward the distant platform.

Finally, he cautiously cast a glance at the black handbag in Scholar Song’s hand.

He vaguely remembered that when they arrived, Scholar Song hadn’t had that bag… Of course, he was a smart person. He would never breathe a word about the black handbag to anyone.

…

…

In the chaotic subway station.

Subway staff worked tirelessly to calm the agitated passengers to prevent further incidents.

Before long, the police arrived.

And soon after, news media also rushed to the scene.

The television in the subway station began broadcasting urgent news, featuring the subway incident.

In the live footage, the police had apprehended a bald Western monk.

“Yes, it’s all my doing. I killed all three of them; I confess. Uh, I had no accomplices, so don’t worry! It was all me! I won’t resist; just arrest me! But… the train accident had nothing to do with me, really!” The Western monk spoke in perfectly standard and fluent Mandarin, obediently allowing himself to be handcuffed, his face sincere!

Yes, he was arrested.

No red book, no Huaxia Dragon Group, no special forces.

And there he was, wearing a face full of confidence, only to find out that his so-called resolution to the incident was simply to take the fall for everything?

In the final live footage, just before the Western monk was shoved into the police car, he gave a thumbs-up to the camera, flashing a bright smile that revealed a mouthful of pearly white teeth.

Ding! Those teeth gleamed brightly in the sunlight, reflecting a blinding light!

—Senior, no matter what, I won’t sell you out. I’ll bear it all myself!

At that moment, the Western monk radiated a saintly glow, making it difficult for anyone to look directly at him!
