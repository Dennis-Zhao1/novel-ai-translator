**Chapter 1: The Pursuit**

"Quick, ask Scholar Song who’s chasing us!" 

After shaking hands, Ji Shuangxue didn’t blame Scholar Song for teaching Joseph the unparalleled martial art "The Times Are Calling." Instead, she silently cast him a gaze filled with unspoken melancholy from time to time.

That sorrowful look made Scholar Song restless, as though he were sitting on needles and pins. This was the terrifying power of a gentle but sharp reprimand!

Half an hour later, Zhuge Zhongyang led everyone onto the plane. At that moment, the melancholic gaze was temporarily halted, and Scholar Song finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Before boarding, Scholar Song called Venerable White to inform him that he was already on the plane. He also asked if Dou Dou and the little monk had been found.

Venerable White replied that he had sensed Dou Dou's aura and would likely capture both Dou Dou and the little monk by this afternoon, bringing them back. He told Scholar Song to contact him again once he arrived at the vacation island, as he would use his flying sword to bring Dou Dou and the little monk back.

Afterward, Scholar Song tried to call Fay Yu. Unfortunately, her phone didn’t connect, so he left a message and sent her a dual message on a chat app.

...

...

As they boarded the plane, Joseph eagerly rushed over, insisting on carrying Scholar Song's bag, claiming, “When the master is busy, the disciple does the labor.”

But it was just a small backpack!

Once on the plane, Scholar Song learned that Joseph and his daughter were not traveling with Zhuge Zhongyang. They had come abroad for vacation during the summer, and coincidentally, they had chosen the same vacation island in the East Sea. Joseph's wife was already waiting for him and their daughter at the island.

Scholar Song could only look up at the sky in silence. What were the odds of this? It felt more improbable than winning the lottery!

...

...

On the plane, Scholar Song sat by the window. Originally, Zhuge Zhongyang had arranged for Miss Lu Fei to sit next to him. However, with Joseph’s enthusiasm, he managed to convince Miss Lu Fei to switch seats. She went to sit with Ji Shuangxue, while Joseph, with a radiant smile, took the seat next to Scholar Song.

Scholar Song was at a loss for words. What was supposed to be a cute girl sitting beside him had turned into a foreign uncle after a bit of shuffling.

Once seated beside Scholar Song, Joseph looked at him with eager anticipation and asked, "By the way, Master, are there levels in cultivation? I remember in the movies, they often mention the meridians or something like that?"

Levels in cultivation?

If we were talking about the levels in "The Times Are Calling," they would likely be: Beginner, Intermediate, PE Teacher Level, and then Gymnastics Champion Level?

But if Scholar Song said that, Joseph would probably collapse from shock!

Should I just make up some levels to fool Joseph?

But that didn’t feel right; first of all, lying isn’t exactly a joyful endeavor. Secondly, Scholar Song cautiously glanced at Miss Lu Fei's side, where Ji Shuangxue kept casting him those sorrowful looks.

Under that haunting gaze, Scholar Song simply couldn’t bring himself to deceive Joseph.

"Of course, there are levels... but you haven’t even reached the beginner stage yet, so you shouldn’t be too ambitious. When you reach the beginner stage, I will explain the various levels in detail," Scholar Song could only use a delaying tactic.

"I understand, Master! I will definitely work hard!" Joseph's spirits immediately lifted.

After the excitement faded, Joseph eagerly said, "Master, I have one more humble request!"

Recently, to match the unparalleled skills he had just learned, Joseph's Chinese had improved significantly. He could even throw in an ancient saying now and then.

"What is it?" Scholar Song asked casually.

"Master, I feel like I’ve gained a lot from practicing the unparalleled skills lately, but there are still many things I don’t understand. Since I finally have the chance to meet you, could I demonstrate my skills now? It would be great if you could guide me a bit!" Joseph asked in a mix of modern and somewhat archaic Chinese.

What? Demonstrate now?

In the aisle of the plane? That would be embarrassing! If Ji Shuangxue's gaze of sorrow intensified, it would be catastrophic!

Thus, Scholar Song coughed lightly and said, "Ahem, there’s no need to rush. Also, this isn’t the right setting for demonstrating martial arts."

Joseph glanced around and chuckled sheepishly, “Sorry, Master, I got too impatient. Then I guess I’ll have to wait until we land and find a chance for you to guide me!”

"Alright." Scholar Song forced a laugh—how could he guide Joseph? Even in "The Times Are Calling," his own skills were just barely standard.

But Joseph had practiced it diligently for over a month, doing thirty sessions a day. In terms of calisthenics, he was already qualified to be Scholar Song's teacher!

Joseph, filled with joy, added, “Master, please don’t find me bothersome, but I have another humble request!”

“Go ahead.” Scholar Song smiled wryly.

Joseph lowered his voice and said, “Master, could you demonstrate that punch that makes the ‘pop, pop, pop’ sound? It would really motivate me when I practice!”

A punch that goes ‘pop, pop, pop’?

That request was tough to refuse. Scholar Song was now much stronger; his spirit, eyes, ears, and senses were all wide open, making him more than ten times stronger than before.

Back then, he needed to practice "Basic Fist Techniques" until his energy was full just to create a sound breaking the air. Now, it was as simple as flicking his wrist.

"Just this once," Scholar Song said.

He focused his spirit outward, sensing the surroundings and confirming that no one was paying attention to him—even Joseph's daughter was chatting with Lu Fei.

Then, Scholar Song extended his right hand and lightly tossed it.

It appeared to be a simple gesture, but he infused it with a thread of his life force.

Bang!

A crisp sound echoed, not very loud, but Joseph sitting beside him lit up with excitement.

He lowered his voice, saying, "Congratulations, Master, on reaching a new level in your skills!"

Even as a complete outsider, Joseph could tell Scholar Song had undoubtedly improved. After all, he remembered seeing Scholar Song moving agilely in the abandoned classroom, exerting all his strength to deliver a punch that made an explosive sound. It was nothing compared to how effortlessly Scholar Song had created this sound now.

"Hehe." Scholar Song smiled lightly, choosing to remain silent.

Next, he would see how far Joseph’s fate with him would take them.

In the future, when Scholar Song's powers grew, he would undoubtedly take his family away from the mundane world, seeking a secluded place to settle down and introduce them to the world of cultivation. If Joseph truly had a master-disciple bond with him, he might as well bestow him a fortune then.

But that was all in the future. Right now, Scholar Song was far from having that capability—he didn’t even have the qualifications to grant such fortunes.

...

...

After witnessing Scholar Song’s effortless display, Joseph was thoroughly satisfied. He began to mimic Scholar Song, closing his eyes in meditation.

Scholar Song had never taught him how to meditate. However, after seeing Scholar Song sit down to meditate after his practice, Joseph was convinced that this method had to be effective.

Thus, after every thirty sessions of "The Times Are Calling," Joseph would cross his legs, close his eyes, clear his mind, and simply space out!

...

...

Looking out the window, Scholar Song murmured, “East Sea… Mysterious Island.”

When that high-ranking individual mentioned "East Sea vacation island tourism," Scholar Song instinctively thought of the "Mysterious Island" introduced by the seniors in the group.

Now, whenever he heard "East Sea" or "island," he inevitably thought of the mysterious island.

“Will I encounter that mysterious floating island?” Scholar Song pondered.

However, whether he would encounter it or not, he wasn’t worried. After all, he would never step foot inside that place. He didn’t want to lose his memories!

He secretly wished he could join Venerable White on his trip to the East Sea—because according to Venerable White, he could never find that mysterious island.

It seemed that mysterious island was subtly avoiding Venerable White, or perhaps the fate surrounding Venerable White was preventing him from approaching it?

But regardless, as long as he stayed close to Venerable White, he wouldn’t encounter the mysterious island. Unfortunately, Venerable White had gone off to find Dou Dou and the little monk and hadn’t returned yet.

The plane flew steadily...

Hopefully, the journey would be smooth sailing.

In his boredom, Scholar Song began to meditate, recognizing the value of time. He utilized every moment to enhance his cultivation, aiming to progress further on his path of spiritual training.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile, in the vicinity of Venerable White.

Venerable White had already locked onto Dou Dou and the little monk's location, slowly closing in on them. Since Scholar Song was already on the plane, he didn’t feel rushed—he would meet them directly at the East Sea vacation island.

At this moment, near Dou Dou and the little monk...

The little monk weakly murmured, “Dou Dou, I can’t go on…”

At that moment, the little monk appeared ashen, his mouth exhaling wisps of black smoke.

“Just hang in there. I feel like something is off with our situation,” Dou Dou muttered.

The little monk replied weakly, “It’s not just off; we must be cursed! Boohoo… it’s terrifying.”

Just yesterday, after Dou Dou successfully escaped from Zhou Li, they continued flying towards Huaxia’s capital. 

However, along the way... they encountered all sorts of bizarre incidents.

For instance, as they flew, suddenly a shell shot up from below... apparently, the military was testing a new type of anti-aircraft missile!

Thankfully, Dou Dou’s keen reflexes allowed them to dodge it, but just after that, a sudden thunderstorm struck from the clear sky. This time, Dou Dou couldn’t evade it and got hit directly. If it weren’t for Dou Dou activating a protective shield at the last moment, the little monk would have been severely injured.

Then, as they flew on... an ultra-supersonic aircraft suddenly flew straight towards them! Without Dou Dou’s quick response, they would have faced a mid-air disaster.

Was today cursed?

Dou Dou seemed to have realized a terrifying possibility and spoke up, “Wait, Guoguo, quickly call Scholar Song and ask if he’s chasing us! If he’s not personally pursuing us, then ask if he sent someone after us!”
