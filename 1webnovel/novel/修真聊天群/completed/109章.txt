Is it you?

Scholar Song held two Stink Pills in his hand, which he originally intended to use against the "Forum Master." However, during the confrontation with the Forum Master, the Stink Pills had gone unused.

He hoped that this uncle’s cultivation level hadn’t reached the Third Rank yet; otherwise, the Stink Pills wouldn’t have the desired effect.

At the same time, Scholar Song’s other hand quietly gripped a ‘Defense Talisman.’

He flicked his fingers and gave it a strong snap!

The Stink Pills hit the ground, their shells cracking open. In an instant, a thick, smoky black mist enveloped the entire room, followed by an overpowering stench that seemed to combine every foul odor in the world.

For an ordinary person, just a whiff would make their stomach churn. But for a cultivator who had opened their nasal passages, their sense of smell could be dozens or even hundreds of times more sensitive than that of an ordinary person. Just a hint of that odor would be an unbearable assault on their senses.

“Ugh, what is that… gag!” The goofy uncle was quick to fall victim to the stench. He clutched his throat, flailing like a drowning person, desperate to expel the foulness that had invaded his airways.

Seizing this opportunity, Scholar Song sprang into action, bouncing over to the hospital bed as if his feet were equipped with springs. He scooped up the ‘Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan’ along with the sheets in a single motion.

After undergoing body refinement and foundation establishment training, a normal person's weight felt no heavier than a stick in Scholar Song's hands. It didn’t hinder his movements at all.

Without looking back, Scholar Song bolted towards the door—he had intended to escape through the window to avoid passing by the uncle again.

But the window was on the fifth floor, and Scholar Song knew better than to jump down from such a height; it would be game over for him. So he had no choice but to head back past the uncle and dash through the door.

“Gag… gag… you scoundrel!” The goofy uncle wasn’t a fool; he just lacked some common sense.

When he squinted through the thick mist and saw Scholar Song making off with Sable Sixteen, the realization hit him—this big con artist, who insisted he wasn’t a fraud, had actually tricked him! How infuriating!

Anger surged within him!

As Scholar Song leaped over him with Sable Sixteen in his arms, the uncle lunged forward, reaching out with a powerful grasp. “Stop right there!”

That hand could easily leave five deep gouges in a hospital wall. If it landed on Scholar Song, he would surely be left with some painful reminders.

“Defense!” At this critical moment, Scholar Song activated the power of the ‘Defense Talisman’ without hesitation! The spiritual energy within the talisman surged forth, wrapping him in a thin layer of protective armor. This shimmering layer could withstand the full force of an attack from a cultivator below the Third Rank!

Clang! The uncle’s powerful claw struck the ‘Defense Talisman,’ sparking a flurry of light, but it barely dented the protective barrier.

In fact, the force of the rebound sent the uncle flying back, crashing hard against the wall of the hospital room.

Taking advantage of this rebound, Scholar Song shot out of the hospital room like an arrow—he had deliberately left the door ajar when he entered, making his escape easier.

The uncle shook his head and took a moment to regain his footing. The sudden impact had not only numbed his arm but also cost him the best opportunity to catch Scholar Song.

By the time he stood up, Scholar Song was already far away.

“Damn it!” The uncle growled in frustration, his figure bursting into motion as he chased after Scholar Song's trail.

This time, he absolutely could not let the Su Clan’s junior escape! This might be his last chance; the Su Clan wouldn’t allow their junior to roam free for long!

“Hey! I told you not to run in the hospital corridors!” A little nurse arrived late and yelled at the uncle’s retreating figure.

But the uncle didn’t have time to pay her any mind; instead, he accelerated, disappearing from her sight.

……

……

Scholar Song was sprinting desperately down the stairs, his mind racing: “Where can I escape to?”

The first person who came to mind was the Alchemical Sage; heading to him would undoubtedly be the best sanctuary. Unfortunately… the Alchemical Sage was away on a trip, having taken Jiang Ziyan with him.

Aside from seeking help from the Alchemical Sage, Scholar Song had two ‘Sword Talismans’ left on him. If he activated them, they would be sufficient to deal with a Second Rank cultivator. But this goofy uncle wasn’t the Forum Master; Scholar Song had no intention of ‘killing’ him.

Should he just find a random hospital room to hide in?

No, what if that uncle was waiting at the entrance downstairs? He couldn’t stay in the hospital forever! Plus, he had no idea if the uncle had any accomplices lurking nearby; hiding in a hospital room could easily lead to being trapped.

“Forget it, I’ll burst out of the hospital first, then find a place to hide. If possible, I’ll contact Sable Seven of the Su Clan; he should be close to the Jiangnan area by now,” Scholar Song thought to himself.

Just then, the girl in his arms, who was likely Sable Sixteen, spoke up in a cool tone, “I didn’t expect there would really be a busybody like you in this world, a complete soft-hearted hero.”

Previously, he’d only heard her voice faintly through the wall; now that she was right in his arms, it sounded… oddly familiar.

Scholar Song glanced down at the girl he was carrying. She had short hair, no makeup, yet still looked pretty; her petite frame gave her a youthful appearance. She was a cute and beautiful girl!

“Eh? Eh? Eh?” Scholar Song couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise while running.

This girl was the one he had crossed paths with twice, both times in compromising situations, but with incredible combat prowess.

“It’s you?” Scholar Song recognized her and pondered, testing the waters, “Did I meddle again this time and cause unnecessary trouble?”

This girl had impressive combat abilities; perhaps she was feigning weakness, waiting for the uncle to get closer so she could unleash a beating on him.

“Hmph.” The short-haired girl turned her head, puffing up like a proud rooster.

But then, in a barely audible voice, she added, “Thank you this time…”

She had just received a painkiller and felt weak all over. If that uncle had tried to harm her, she would have had no strength to fight back. Scholar Song had genuinely saved her this time.

“What did you just say?” Scholar Song had been focused on escape routes and didn’t catch her words clearly.

He hadn’t taken the elevator down; that uncle was much faster than an elevator. He could easily wait at the elevator door for him to come out!

“Thank… thank you.” The short-haired girl’s voice was so soft it was almost like a mosquito’s buzz.

This time, Scholar Song finally heard her clearly.

“You actually know how to thank others?” Scholar Song chuckled.

The girl in his arms grinned awkwardly, feeling that talking to Scholar Song made her feel uncomfortable, as if thanking him was a mistake. She just didn’t like to talk much; it wasn’t that she didn’t know how to be polite. “Where are you planning to run?”

“There are too many places to run too far; for now, let’s just take it one step at a time,” Scholar Song replied, feeling the defense from the ‘Defense Talisman’ weakening rapidly, ready to extinguish at any moment.

“...I can hear that uncle from the Xian Nong Sect chasing us. He’ll catch up to us in about fifty seconds,” the short-haired girl said flatly.

In other words, he might find himself in trouble in fifty seconds?

He absolutely couldn’t be caught!

Scholar Song sprinted even faster, leaping down the long flight of stairs in a single bound.

In under ten seconds, Scholar Song had reached the ground floor of the hospital.

By chance, an empty taxi was idling in the pick-up area, waiting for a passenger, the driver hadn’t even turned off the engine yet.

“Taxi!” Scholar Song felt a wave of relief as he rushed toward the taxi, still holding Sable Sixteen.

He opened the door, hopped in, and it all took just three seconds.

“Where to…?” The taxi driver glanced at Scholar Song with a strange look, taking in the girl wrapped in sheets in his arms—was this some kind of elopement?

Scholar Song couldn’t think of where to escape to just yet.

At that moment, Sable Sixteen spoke up, “Daji Street!”
