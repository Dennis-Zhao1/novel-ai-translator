**The Little Girl's Time is Running Out**

“Then, Sect Leader, I’ll head off to make some arrangements. After we implement the second plan, our Moon Blade Sect needs to lie low for a while. After all, the Heavenly River Su Clan is not something we can confront head-on... We’ll have to temporarily set aside our centuries-old foundation,” Young Master Hai said softly.

“A hundred years of foundation is merely a lifeless object; what harm is there in temporarily abandoning it?” Ba Qianjun chuckled heartily. “Moreover… once the storm passes, we can return! For now, the affairs of the Moon Blade Sect will be handled by you, Elder.”

The sect’s heritage is nothing compared to the importance of recovering from his heavenly tribulation injuries.

Young Master Hai nodded slightly and then left the main hall of the Moon Blade Sect.

As he walked, the peculiar smile in his eyes faded, and he presented himself to the disciples of the sect as a refined and elegant gentleman.

In the distance, a female cultivator swiftly approached Young Master Hai, her cheeks slightly flushed as she stopped beside him. “Elder Hai, all the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect have finished their preparations. All portable items have been arranged, and anything that couldn’t be taken has been hidden deep within the sect’s secret vaults.”

“Very good, Elder Yao Yan. Please order the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect to gather in an hour. We need to complete our relocation to ‘Blue Origin Valley’ by tonight,” Young Master Hai said gently, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword at his waist.

“Understood, I’ll go arrange it,” Elder Yao Yan nodded slightly.

Reluctantly, she departed to gather the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect.

Standing high above, Young Master Hai looked down at the busy disciples below, and that strange smile returned to his face.

At that moment, a small puff of black smoke suddenly emerged from his sleeve. The smoke emitted a strange chuckle: “Hehe, Elder Hai, you really are quite popular with the ladies. I see Elder Yao Yan of the Moon Blade Sect has had feelings for you for a long time. Just one word from you, and even if it requires something intimate, she would willingly throw herself into your embrace, don’t you think?”

“Who knows if the Demon Lord thinks my ambitions lie in that direction?” Young Master Hai smiled.

“Hehe.” The black smoke cackled in a voice only Young Master Hai could hear.

“Demon Lord, I need your help with something,” Young Master Hai whispered. “Your true form has already arrived near Jiangnan District, right? Could you help me capture that little girl from the Su Clan?”

“Leave it to me, it’s a piece of cake,” the smoke in his sleeve laughed.

“Then I’ll be counting on you, Demon Lord,” Young Master Hai said.

“It’s mutually beneficial,” the smoke fell silent.

Young Master Hai extended his hand toward the sky, gently grasping as if preparing to ascend into the heavens. This pose made many female cultivators of the Moon Blade Sect gaze at him with dazed eyes.

At that moment, the melody of “High Mountains and Flowing Water” began to play, serving as a fitting background score that accentuated Young Master Hai’s celestial demeanor.

Young Master Hai calmly withdrew his hand and fished out a smartphone identical to the one Sect Leader Ba Qianjun had, swiping it lightly.

A cold, emotionless female voice sounded: “Elder Hai, I have located Su Clan’s Aqi.”

“Good. Use every means to delay him, as long as possible,” Young Master Hai said softly.

“Yes, Elder. Even if it costs me my life, I will complete the task,” the woman’s voice remained icy but resolute.

“No… I want you to return safely. Your life is far more precious to me than the task. Be sure to come back alive,” Young Master Hai said gently.

“Yes, Elder Hai.” The woman’s cold tone trembled slightly before she hung up.

“Muahaha.” Young Master Hai put away his phone.

Everything was already in place.

Now, he just had to wait for the right moment to reel them in!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Time flew by.

Before he knew it, it was already 1:30 PM.

Song Shuhang furrowed his brows. Elder Bei He had said that Su Clan’s Aqi would arrive in seventy minutes, yet she still hadn’t shown up?

In contrast, A16 seemed quite relaxed, almost hoping Aqi wouldn’t appear.

Having snuggled on the sofa for over half an hour, her injuries were now under control, and her pale face had regained a touch of color.

“By the way, Shuhang, you mentioned you had a way to uncover the assassin’s identity?” A16 looked at Song Shuhang with eager eyes.

“I have a lead that should reveal the assassin’s true identity. However… I have something to take care of soon. Let’s take action in the evening?” Song Shuhang replied.

He couldn’t wait any longer for Aqi to appear. He had to check in at the vehicle management office by two o'clock and also needed to drop Zhao Yaya off at the station.

He opened his phone and messaged Elder Bei He in the Jiuzhou One group.

But Elder Bei He had yet to respond.

“What’s the matter?” Su Clan’s A16 sat up and said, “Since Aqi hasn’t come yet, why don’t we take care of your business first? You can always contact Aqi through the Jiuzhou One group!”

“No way, you need to wait here for Elder Aqi. I can handle my own matters!” Song Shuhang firmly refused.

What kind of joke was that? If A16 went with him to drop Zhao Yaya off, who knew how his life script would go wrong?

……

……

At 2:00 PM.

Song Shuhang grimaced as he clocked in at the vehicle management office for his driving theory study.

Then he turned around to look behind him.

About ten meters away, Su Clan’s A16 made eye contact with him, then snorted coldly and turned away.

Song Shuhang forced a smile.

There was nothing he could do; her legs were her own, and she followed him without any way to stop her.

……

……

At 2:17 PM.

Song Shuhang returned to the hospital to see Zhao Yaya off to the station.

He turned around, only to find Su Clan’s A16 still trailing him.

Their eyes met again, and she coldly snorted before turning away.

What on earth was going on?!

Surprisingly, Zhao Yaya didn’t ask many questions today. She just asked him to help carry two small bags as they walked together toward the subway.

Zhao Yaya could take the subway to the bullet train station and then transfer to the 3:00 PM train home.

As they walked, Zhao Yaya lowered her voice and asked, “That girl behind you isn’t your girlfriend, is she?”

“No, she’s a junior of a friend of mine. I just found out today,” Song Shuhang answered quietly.

“Oh.” Zhao Yaya nodded and fell silent again.

After sending her off at the subway, she gently patted Song Shuhang’s shoulder. “I won’t pry into why you carried her out of the hospital. But… that little girl doesn’t have much time left. When you have the chance, spend some quality time with her. Don’t let her leave this world with regrets. After all, that’s something you’re good at.”

“Uh?” Song Shuhang didn’t know how to respond.

“I see she’s been sulking with you; you should indulge that little girl a bit. After all, she’s young and doesn’t understand much,” Zhao Yaya advised earnestly.

With that, she waved goodbye and boarded the subway, disappearing from view.

Young? Doesn’t understand? Song Shuhang turned to look at A16.

Well… A16 did appear younger due to her petite stature. But Song Shuhang was sure she had to be older than him!

However, Zhao Yaya was right about one thing… A16 might genuinely not have much time left in this world.

With a heavy sigh, Song Shuhang bought two ice creams from a nearby stall.

Then he walked towards A16 and handed her one.

“Can you eat this? It won’t affect your injuries, right?” Song Shuhang asked.

A16 silently accepted the ice cream and gently licked it.

“Let’s head back to the vehicle management office first. I need to take the driving theory test for subject one. It’ll only take about ten minutes, and then we can look into the assassin’s identity,” Song Shuhang said.

“Mm.” A16 nodded, quietly following behind Song Shuhang.
