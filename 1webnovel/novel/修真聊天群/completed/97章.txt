**Fated Encounters Across the Floors**

As Scholar Song burst out of the hospital room, the uncle had already vanished without a trace.

He immediately began searching the fifth floor's corridors at lightning speed, but found nothing.

"How could he run away so quickly? It only took a moment for him to disappear!" Scholar Song grumbled to himself. He had merely explained to Professor Ren Shui the encounter with the uncle in a few brief sentences—how could that have been enough to scare the man off?

Could this uncle have really bolted like an Olympic sprinter at the mere mention of being a ‘fraud’?

Damn it, there should be limits to misunderstandings!

With a resigned sigh, Scholar Song turned and headed for the fourth floor... He could only hope to catch a glimpse of that foolish uncle on his way out of the hospital. If he found him, great; if not, then so be it.

Right now, he certainly didn’t have the time to search the entire building for a guy just to retrieve a hundred and fifty bucks. That uncle was foolish enough; he couldn’t be expected to babysit him through his stupidity, could he?

……

……

Just as Scholar Song was leaving the fifth floor, a shadow leaped down from the ceiling corner of the corridor—it was that uncle! To evade Scholar Song, he had awkwardly clung to the ceiling like Spider-Man, struggling to maintain his balance.

“Tch, you think a mere fraud can find me? How naïve!” The uncle smirked coolly and continued to press onward, checking the room numbers one by one—533, 534, 535!

Ah, descendant of the Su clan, you can’t escape my grasp! Even if I have to comb through the entire fifth floor, I will find you! The uncle was brimming with confidence. He had a feeling today was going to be his lucky day!

Before leaving home, he had specifically consulted a sage who had foretold that he would encounter a fated person today!

A fated person? Hmph, aside from that Su clan descendant, who else could he possibly meet in this godforsaken place?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Scholar Song meandered through the fourth floor, but once again found no trace of his quarry.

The uncle must have gone up to another floor, he figured.

Forget it; if he couldn’t find him, then that was that.

If they crossed paths again in the future... he absolutely had to rush over and land a punch on the guy, knocking him flat to the ground! He wouldn’t let him utter a single word or have a chance to escape, then he could properly explain everything!

Even a high monk would get irritable after being misunderstood time and time again!

With that thought in mind, Scholar Song clenched his fists, imagining that uncle right in front of him. He let out a grunt and threw a couple of punches at the air, as if those strikes could land squarely on the uncle’s face!

Then he noticed the curious glances from passersby around him… If you were just walking along and suddenly saw someone making strange noises while throwing punches, you’d be intrigued too, right? 

Scholar Song wanted to bury his face in his hands.

What an unfortunate day!

“Ahem.” He cleared his throat loudly, forcing a casual expression, and continued his descent down the stairs.

……

……

Today seemed to be a day for running into familiar faces.

As he reached the bottom of the third-floor staircase, Scholar Song spotted a familiar figure—a petite girl with short hair and a pretty face. She was leaning against the handrail, gingerly making her way down the stairs.

Wasn’t this the girl who had been cornered against the wall earlier, who had taught that delinquent a lesson in just a few minutes?

Perhaps sensing his gaze, the girl turned her head sharply, meeting his eyes.

Scholar Song scratched his head, managing a dry laugh, “Oh, what a coincidence! You’re at the hospital too?”

To be honest, he wasn’t too keen on striking up a conversation with her... She had such an aloof demeanor that talking to her felt like trying to warm up an iceberg. But now that their eyes had met, he felt it would be rude to ignore her, so he forced himself to greet her.

The girl blinked, seemingly recalling something. After a moment, she nodded, “Oh, it’s you.”

“Haha, yeah! My sister brought me here for a check-up. What about you? Did you hurt your foot?” Scholar Song noticed she was using the handrail to assist her steps.

“Yeah, just a little injury,” she replied, her tone a bit subdued.

Today, it was rare for this girl to actually engage in conversation!

“Do you... need any help? You live near Jiangnan University City, right?” Scholar Song’s innate kindness kicked in again. If she was indeed from Jiangnan University City, he wouldn’t mind giving her a ride.

“No, thanks.” The girl shook her head and continued to lean on the handrail, stubbornly making her way down the stairs.

She looked like she was struggling, so Scholar Song thought for a moment and added, “Actually, this hospital has an elevator. If your foot is hurt, you could take the elevator straight down.”

“…” The girl froze for a moment, clearly having overlooked the elevator. After Scholar Song pointed it out, she felt a bit embarrassed.

So she turned her head away from him and quickened her pace down the stairs.

Even though they had managed to exchange a few words, this girl still wasn’t easy to communicate with, Scholar Song sighed inwardly. Well, he wasn’t the type to insist on helping someone who clearly didn’t want it.

“By the way, were you coming down from the fifth floor? Did you see an uncle dressed like a businessman, rushing around?” Scholar Song casually asked.

The girl thought for a moment, then shook her head, “No, I didn’t see anyone.”

“Looks like that uncle must have escaped upstairs,” Scholar Song rubbed his temples—this uncle’s thought process was truly beyond the grasp of ordinary people!

No, he couldn’t dwell on that uncle anymore; just thinking about him made his stomach churn.

Next, he needed to go to The Alchemical Sage!

He had promised the sage that after handling his sister Zhao Yaya’s business, he would help refine the formulation of the body-enhancing liquid.

Besides, he needed to find a place to grab a bite to eat.

Thanks to the forum master, he had been busy since noon without so much as a drop of water!

……

……

Lost in thought, Scholar Song soon reached the first floor.

Though the girl was moving slowly, leaning on the handrail, she was somehow keeping pace with him! Just as he reached the ground floor, she stepped off the stairs right behind him.

Was it her pride that made her not want to fall behind him?

However, once she let go of the handrail, she stumbled sideways, unable to put weight on her injured foot.

Scholar Song’s reflexes kicked in; he quickly reached out to support her.

“How about I help you to the hospital entrance and get a car for you?” Scholar Song suggested gently.

The girl sniffed, and after a moment, squeezed out two words: “Thank you.”

Scholar Song paused, smiling, “No problem.”

He helped the short-haired girl out of the hospital. Originally, he intended to call a taxi for her.

But once they reached the entrance, he was dumbfounded.

There were plenty of taxis, but none were available for them.

Today, there were too many patients, and taxis would barely stop before someone hopped in, zooming away.

“How about we walk a little further? There’s a junction not too far ahead, and it should be easier to flag one down there,” Scholar Song suggested.

“Okay,” the short-haired girl answered weakly.

So, Scholar Song supported her as they moved away from the hospital, heading towards the junction just outside.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At this moment, on the fifth floor of building 8B in the hospital.

The uncle took a deep breath and trembled as he pushed open the last hospital room on the fifth floor—inside, it was utterly empty.

The once-confident uncle... was now petrified.

Did he lose track of him again?

All those fortune-tellers were nothing but frauds! Where was this ‘fated person’ they promised him? He hadn’t found the Su clan descendant at all!

And that fraud he encountered today had wasted so much of his time! If it weren’t for that guy causing trouble, he might have already found that Su clan descendant!

Next time he ran into that fraud, he absolutely wouldn’t give him a chance to speak. He’d just rush over and knock him to the ground!

Imagining that fraud standing before him, the uncle clenched his fists and threw a couple of punches in the air, as if he could land those strikes right on Scholar Song’s face!

It was easy to predict that when Scholar Song and the uncle met again, neither would say a word; they would both charge at each other, aiming to deliver a ‘friendly punch’ to the face, intent on knocking each other out!
