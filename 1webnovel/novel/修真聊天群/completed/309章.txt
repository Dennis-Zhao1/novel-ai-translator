**Venerable White's Emoji Collection**

Inside the bronze coffin, a bony claw began to pry open the lid, producing a grating sound that echoed ominously.

Scholar Song and Miss Nine Lamps turned their heads in unison, their attention captured by the bronze coffin.

As the sight of the bony claw emerging from the coffin's seam registered, Song exclaimed, "Is it a zombie?"

"Don’t worry, I’m great at dealing with these kinds of things," Miss Nine Lamps replied confidently. Coming from a Buddhist background, she was well-versed in handling undead creatures.

In the midst of their conversation...

Clang! Clang! The bronze coffin creaked open just a crack, revealing a skeletal snake head with a hideous visage. Its eye sockets flickered with red light, creating an eerie atmosphere.

Miss Nine Lamps did not initiate an attack; after all, this was the tomb set up by the senior Thunder Pig and housed the White Dragon. The skeletal serpent within the coffin was bound to have some significance. As long as it didn't attack first, she wouldn't make the first move either.

The snake head glanced over at Scholar Song and Miss Nine Lamps, then opened its jaw, saying, "Hello there! Did someone just call for me?"

Scholar Song: "???"

Miss Nine Lamps: "No one called you."

To their astonishment, the skeletal snake possessed intelligence and could communicate!

"Wait a minute, someone definitely called my name just now," the bony snake head insisted, its mouth moving as the coffin lid creaked open further.

It was then that Scholar Song and Miss Nine Lamps noticed two tiny sharp horns atop the snake's head. It wasn't merely a snake’s skull; it belonged to the skeleton of a flood dragon.

"I am Dragon Bone. Greetings, fellow Taoists! By the way, did someone really not call for me just now?" The flood dragon’s bony form emerged further from the coffin, revealing half its body.

This was an evil-looking yet oddly polite skeletal dragon.

Dragon Bone? Miss Nine Lamps discreetly wiped her brow; she had casually mentioned the term 'dragon bone' moments earlier.

Beside her, Scholar Song quietly leaned closer, speaking in a tone only Miss Nine Lamps could hear, "Miss Nine Lamps, is this skeletal dragon a ghost or some sort of spirit?"

Before she could respond, the skeletal dragon interjected, "No, little Taoist. While there are indeed zombies and such in this world, I’m not one of them."

Scholar Song blinked, surprised that the skeletal dragon could hear him despite his hushed voice.

"Let me formally introduce myself—Puppet Flood Dragon Spirit 'Dragon Bone' greets you! I belong to the category of magical artifacts, which is entirely different from zombies," the skeletal dragon chirped, waving a claw as if unbothered by being mistaken for a zombie.

Scholar Song: "..."

"I am Nine Lamps," Miss Nine Lamps clasped her hands together and bowed slightly to Dragon Bone.

"My name is Scholar Song," he clasped his fists, feeling the strangeness of the situation.

"Greetings, fellow Taoists! By the way, how did you two arrive here? It has been ages since I’ve had guests!" Dragon Bone’s mouth moved animatedly, as if it was smiling.

"We were digging and accidentally found our way here," Miss Nine Lamps replied.

Dragon Bone's eyes glimmered with red light, and it chuckled, "So you stumbled into this place by accident?"

Pausing for a moment, it added with a grin, "Did the Thunder Pig trick you?"

Miss Nine Lamps: "..."

How cruel! Even that was something it didn't comprehend; their friendship was over!

Dragon Bone tapped the lid of the bronze coffin with its claw, asking, "So, what brings you to seek the Thunder Pig?"

Miss Nine Lamps took a step back, nudging Scholar Song forward.

Clearing his throat, Scholar Song bowed slightly, "We came here to ask the senior Thunder Pig for a 'Dragon Bone Withered Vine.' But it seems the Thunder Pig was about to sleep and found us too noisy, so it tossed us here instead."

"Oh, so you want a Dragon Bone Withered Vine? I happen to have some!" Dragon Bone chuckled. "Every time I wake up from a nap, I end up growing those things, and they become quite bothersome. However, pulling them out feels so relieving, like removing a thorn embedded in flesh—so satisfying!"

Scholar Song’s eyes brightened at the mention of the vine. "Dragon Bone... fellow, could you give me some of those Dragon Bone Withered Vines?"

"Of course! I can give you a lot... just a moment, let me count how many I have," Dragon Bone replied, retreating back into the bronze coffin.

Then, a voice echoed from within the coffin, "One, two, three, four... ten... fifteen, sixteen."

Emerging again with half its head visible, Dragon Bone said, "I have a total of sixteen Dragon Bone Withered Vines that I can give you all. However, you need to do me a small favor."

"Please, go ahead," Scholar Song replied, his heart racing with excitement.

"It’s quite simple. Do you see that crystal coffin in the middle?" Dragon Bone pointed to a crystal coffin housing a tiny white dragon.

Scholar Song nodded silently.

"And did you notice the groove beside the crystal coffin? Could you please put a bowl of blood into that groove? After that, the sixteen Dragon Bone Withered Vines will belong to you," Dragon Bone said with a sly grin.

Scholar Song looked skeptically at the groove, feeling his face go pale. That 'bowl' was definitely meant for a creature of Dragon Bone's size. To him, it looked more like a small basin. If he filled it with his own blood, he would be in serious trouble!

He gulped, turning to ask, "Do I need to fill it completely?"

"No, no! Just enough to fill a bowl that's your size will do," Dragon Bone reassured him.

Scholar Song glanced at Nine Lamps, worrying that if he filled the groove with blood, he might activate something terrifying.

"Don’t worry, with the Thunder Pig watching over us, nothing major will happen. It should be fine..." Nine Lamps encouraged.

Nodding, Scholar Song approached the groove, extending his wrist as he prepared to draw his blade, planning to make a bold cut just like in the movies.

Yet, when the moment arrived, he hesitated, unsure where to cut.

After all, he had no experience; if he cut too deeply, he risked bleeding too much. If he cut too shallowly, it wouldn’t feel right either.

"Miss Nine Lamps, could you help me draw some blood?" Scholar Song asked sheepishly.

"Of course!" Miss Nine Lamps replied cheerfully, taking the blade from him and swiftly slicing it across his wrist.

Because it wasn’t his own hand, the pain didn’t sting at all.

Blood gushed forth... Scholar Song watched as the crimson liquid flowed freely, feeling his heart race.

In a moment, they managed to fill the groove with a bowl’s worth of blood.

Then, Nine Lamps gently grasped Scholar Song's wrist, stopping the flow of blood.

The blood pooled in the groove, flowing like a river toward the crystal coffin, enveloping it in layers of crimson.

Next, they anticipated something magical to happen with the crystal coffin...

...

...

Dragon Bone’s eye sockets sparkled with flickering red light, eagerly awaiting the impending change.

However... after a long while, there was no sign of any transformation from the crystal coffin.

Dragon Bone let out a soft sigh.

Scholar Song turned to ask, "Did it fail?"

"It didn’t fail... it just hasn’t succeeded yet," Dragon Bone replied with another wistful sigh.

"Do I need to give more blood?" Scholar Song inquired.

"No need, thank you, fellow." Dragon Bone’s glowing eyes settled down, then it reached out a claw, retrieving the sixteen Dragon Bone Withered Vines and offered them to Scholar Song.

Scholar Song accepted the bundle of vines.

The Dragon Bone Withered Vines were short, each only the size of a palm, and thin as a hair.

Yet, upon closer inspection, each delicate vine was intricately carved to resemble a lifelike flood dragon, complete with horns and claws, looking exquisitely beautiful.

"Transaction complete! Now, let me send you both out of here. While I would love to chat longer, this tomb is filled with a significant amount of dragon corpse energy... staying here too long would harm your bodies," Dragon Bone said gently.

In the next moment, before Scholar Song and Nine Lamps could respond, Dragon Bone lightly clapped its claws. Their bodies began to float effortlessly, a passage opening above the sealed tomb, allowing them to drift upwards.

Once they disappeared from sight, Dragon Bone gazed solemnly at the crystal coffin, letting out a sigh.

It wasn’t meant for ‘him’...

After sighing, Dragon Bone extended most of its body out of the coffin and patted the bronze coffin beside it, saying, "Dragon Claw, wake up! Time for your shift; I need to sleep for a while."

"Ugh... let me sleep for another hundred years," came a sleepy voice from the adjacent bronze coffin.

"Wake up, you lazy thing! It's time to have some fun!" Dragon Bone banged loudly on the coffin, the sound thunderous.

After a moment, the adjacent bronze coffin cracked open slightly, revealing a sharp claw.

Satisfied, Dragon Bone nodded and retreated back into its own coffin, securely locking the lid—finally able to indulge in a well-deserved nap.

At this moment, in the Chu family’s cultivation clan...

Fay Yu sat on the grass, her long legs slightly bent, revealing a captivating curve, her delicate toes playfully wiggling—adorably charming.

A laptop rested on her lap, displaying a myriad of beautiful photos.

There were images of Venerable White with double ponytails, a single ponytail, with braids, and even with a bun—various hairstyles of Venerable White in all their glory.

Fay Yu’s fingers danced across the keyboard, swiftly selecting one photo after another without needing to enhance them, simply resizing and saving.

"Ah, I initially wanted to pick just a few to send to Scholar Song. But every picture of Venerable White is just so adorable... I guess I’ll send them all to Scholar Song!" Fay Yu mused to herself.

With that, she finalized the collection of photos.

Among them were expressions like [Venerable White Smiling], [Venerable White Daydreaming], [Venerable White Acting Cute], [Venerable White Acting Spoiled]... and a series of other delightful expressions.

Finally, she compiled these expressions into a complete emoji pack.

"I’m so clever," Fay Yu silently praised herself.

Then, she opened her chat application, selected the 'Scholar Song's Stress Level' account, and sent an offline message titled [Venerable White's Adorable Emoji Pack]...
