**Everyone step aside, let me show off!**

The forum master approached the foreign monk, once again raising his hand to strike!

“As long as I consume this foreign monk's soul, it will be enough for Ku You to recover from his weakened state. Who knows, it might even turn into a blessing in disguise,” the forum master thought to himself.

This foreign monk had already reached the first-grade, sixth aperture leap to the Dragon Gate realm, and he possessed immense merit power. To ghosts, this was like Tang Seng's flesh—an incredible supplement. If Ku You could devour this monk’s soul, he might even have a chance to elevate his realm a notch!

He absolutely couldn’t let this monk escape.

Thus, the forum master, even at the cost of worsening the poison within his body, was determined to capture this foreign monk!

With a resounding slap, his palm collided with the foreign monk. The surge of true qi in his palm was powerful enough to create a transparent hole in the monk's body.

Clang! Yet, when his palm struck, a metallic clang echoed in the air.

The foreign monk's robe suddenly inflated, like an air-filled balloon, shielding his body within. Hundreds of scriptures shimmered on the surface of the monk’s robe, giving it a metallic sheen.

This seemingly ordinary robe was, in fact, a defensive magical artifact that completely blocked the forum master's attack! The vacuum created by the robe and the defensive formation inscribed within it further weakened the force of the forum master's palm.

The foreign monk was unharmed!

Cultivators sought the path of immortality and generally treasured their lives.

For those seeking longevity, living meant they had the chance for immortality; once dead, all was lost!

As a formal cultivator, how could he lack defensive treasures?

Even if he was a foreigner, he was no exception!

This monk's robe not only provided defense but also automatically regulated body temperature, all at a low cost—affordable and effective.

The only downside was that this robe's defenses required the foreign monk to actively activate them.

Thus, when the forum master first ambushed the monk, he couldn’t react in time, and the robe's defenses were never triggered.

The decisive palm strike had no effect, making the forum master frown and coldly say, “Struggling in vain!”

As he spoke, he transformed his palm into claws, executing a strike known as 'Grievous Ghost Claw,' specifically designed to break through protective qi and enhance defense, aiming directly at the monk's robe.

However… he grasped at nothing!

The foreign monk hadn’t remained idle. After being ambushed and knocked to the ground, he secretly took a healing elixir. Now, he had gathered enough strength to escape.

As the robe inflated into a ball-shaped defense, the foreign monk slapped the ground with both palms, propelling himself like a basketball. His movement wasn’t graceful, but his speed was undeniably impressive!

The forum master’s claw only grasped at the monk’s afterimage.

In an instant, the foreign monk had bounced out of this train compartment, already three compartments away!

As long as he could open the door of any train car, he could escape immediately.

“Damn it,” the foreign monk muttered to himself.

Facing an opponent with true qi at the second-grade level, he had no chance in a direct fight; it was a matter of life and death. The best strategy was to flee. Once he escaped the clutches of this ghostly cultivator, he could rally his fellow disciples to take revenge for that palm strike!

With a powerful bounce, the foreign monk landed back in the compartment where Scholar Song was.

The passengers were astonished, staring at the monk in confusion, unsure why this monk had suddenly returned!

And why did he look like a puffed-up balloon?

The foreign monk didn’t have time to waste. He rolled on the ground, quickly getting back on his feet, and the sleeves of his robe emitted two streams of white vapor, restoring the robe to its normal state.

Then, he rushed to the compartment door, yanking the manual handle, and forcefully twisted it open.

“If you don’t want to die, quickly escape this subway!” the foreign monk shouted to the passengers in the compartment.

He didn’t have time for further explanation and didn’t care if the passengers would heed his warning. He had delivered the message; whether they believed it was up to them.

…

…

Scholar Song and the little girl’s family stood at the compartment door.

The little girl shrank behind her father, holding her young mother’s hand.

The young mother awkwardly asked in broken Chinese, “Do we… get off the train?”

The man in the white shirt nodded, “Yes, get off, leave the compartment!”

They had witnessed the foreign monk dispelling illusions and all believed he was a true monk. Although he was a foreigner, that wasn’t the point.

The man in the white shirt felt youthful and didn’t want to die. So, they should listen to this monk and quickly get off the train.

“Little brother, let’s get off together,” he said to Scholar Song.

However, Scholar Song gently shook his head, “It’s too late…”

“?” The man in the white shirt looked confused.

Scholar Song narrowed his eyes, fingers pinching three talismans—he had already sensed that when the foreign monk opened the compartment door, it was already too late.

In his alert state, Scholar Song felt a wave of negative energy from a ghost entering the compartment just three seconds after the foreign monk had leaped in.

As the foreign monk released his robe's defense and moved to open the door, that ghost’s negative energy had already enveloped the entire compartment. The ghost’s illusion had unknowingly spread throughout the compartment.

The foreign monk thought he had opened the door, but in reality, he was still gripping the subway's handrail, twisting it. The door hadn’t opened at all.

“Stay close to me, don’t wander off,” Scholar Song softly instructed the family in the white shirt.

He quietly pulled out two ‘Sword Talismans’ and two ‘Armor Talismans,’ keeping them ready in his pocket.

Just as they were speaking, a pale figure slowly entered the compartment, sneering, “You can’t escape from my grasp, you big monk.”

The foreign monk’s expression changed drastically, feeling a wave of dread.

He reached for what he thought was the open door, expecting to find the subway corridor outside—only to touch the cold train wall.

Not good, he was trapped in an illusion!

“Still planning to run? There are plenty more compartments; you can keep running. I’m in no hurry,” the forum master sneered, snapping his fingers.

Four vengeful spirits emerged from his hands, destroying all the surveillance in the compartment.

Then, the ghost general Ku You half-rose into the compartment. The illusions that had been set up in advance exploded, enveloping all the passengers.

Fear surged in the eyes of the passengers, one by one collapsing to the ground, fainting.

“Shit!” the foreign monk shouted angrily, realizing escape was impossible.

His wide monk robe fluttered as he summoned a Vajra Pestle, which fell into his hands.

He was ready to fight!

Even if it meant death, he had to show this guy some resistance.

At that moment, the surrounding passengers fell one after another. The man in the white shirt, the young mother, and the little girl also wore expressions of terror as they succumbed to unconsciousness. The passengers were tormented by various horrific illusions, their fear and dread transformed into pure negative energy.

If this continued, the ghost general would absorb even more negative energy, growing stronger. And the longer the foreign monk’s injuries lingered, the more disadvantageous it would be.

With this back-and-forth, if he didn’t act now, he wouldn’t even have the chance to fight back.

The foreign monk took a deep breath, harmonizing the blood and qi in his eyes, nose, ears, and mouth with that in his heart.

He temporarily suppressed the injuries on his back with his vital energy, gripping the Vajra Pestle tightly, stepping forward to elevate his momentum to its peak!

He estimated he only had one or two strikes left in him.

“Ahhh!” The foreign monk leaped high, raising the Vajra Pestle to strike down at the forum master.

This was a technique of the pestle, where one force could overcome ten insights.

“Heh, you look delicious, struggling in vain. Excellent!” the forum master said, standing firm and unyielding. Behind him, the ghost general Ku You extended his hands, forming a massive ghostly claw that protected the forum master.

The foreign monk’s Vajra Pestle struck the giant ghost claw, creating a shower of sparks.

Gradually recovering, the ghost general Ku You was a standard second-grade powerhouse.

The foreign monk’s attack couldn’t harm Ku You at all; instead, he was knocked back by the force of the claw, crashing into the train wall. The impact worsened his back injuries…

“As long as I eat you, Ku You will definitely break through his current realm. Fortune has finally smiled upon me!” the forum master grinned wickedly.

“Dog shit,” the foreign monk gritted his teeth, feelings of despair rising within him.

Looking around the compartment, nearly all the passengers were out cold, leaving only a handsome young man still standing.

The young man had a calm expression and an aura of extraordinary detachment.

Moments later, the young man suddenly smiled slightly. Then, he pulled a pendant from around his neck and gave it a gentle flick.

Ding!

A crisp sound rang from the pendant.

It was quite a pleasant sound…
