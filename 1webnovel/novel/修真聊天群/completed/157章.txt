**Chapter [Insert Chapter Number]**

"Actually, the entire group is just my alternate accounts!"

Inside the Ninefold Land's chat group, the Master of Snow Wolf Cavern, known as the Snow Wolf, made his statement, but surprisingly, no one in the group responded. Normally, when someone stirred up a topic, senior members would pop up from their lurking spots to join the conversation. Was it because the ever-online Hermit of North River and the often reckless Wild Blade of Three Tides were absent that the atmosphere felt so quiet?

With the absence of these key contributors, the group felt unusually desolate.

Scholar Song found this atmosphere quite uncomfortable. He glanced at the members displayed as online on the right side of the screen, only to find that the group owner, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, was the only one active. Everyone else was offline—most likely in stealth mode.

Bored, Scholar Song casually typed, "Hey, Immortal Sage, what have you been up to lately?"

He remembered that the Immortal Sage had mentioned needing to take care of something and would come back two months later to fetch Dou Dou. So, with no other topics in mind, he threw out the question.

"Ha ha, I'm just waiting for an interesting fellow to break free from his seal," the Immortal Sage replied with a chuckle.

As he spoke, he sent a screenshot.

It was a screenshot of the "chat software friend log," but the account used wasn't that of the Immortal Sage; it belonged to an account called "Little Orange Color."

The diary's author ID was "Daoist Yunwu."

**Title:** "Hahaha, Yellow Mountain, you big fool! You’ve sealed me for two hundred years!"

**Content:** "But finally, I've cracked the principles behind your sealing technique and have begun calculating how to break free! Soon, I shall shatter your pathetic seal and roam the world again! Just wait and see how I’ll take my revenge! Hahaha, this time, I certainly won’t go easy on you!"

The post had garnered a flurry of likes beneath it.

**Comment 1:** "Daoist, you’re finally about to break free after two hundred years! That's impressive. Can’t wait to hear more about your glorious past once you’re out!"

**Comment 2:** "Is the Daoist’s middle school syndrome flaring up again?"

**Comment 3:** "The Daoist's stories are the most thrilling! I even thought about adapting them into a web novel."

**Comment 4:** "Daoist, don’t stop taking your meds!"

**Comment 5:** "But don’t take them recklessly! If it's the Daoist taking them, it should be fine. He’ll only get cuter after taking his meds."

**Comment 6:** "Daoist, is it really okay to publish something so private about breaking a seal out in the open like this?"

**Comment 7:** "There should be applause here…"

There were hundreds of comments following.

...

Scholar Song read through the content—apparently, this "Daoist Yunwu" had been sealed by the Immortal Sage for nearly two hundred years and was finally on the verge of breaking free, so he decided to boast about it online? But it seemed he had unwittingly caught the attention of the Immortal Sage's alternate account?

"But if he’s been sealed for two hundred years, how is he online?" Scholar Song asked.

Could it be that the Immortal Sage advocated for treating prisoners well by granting internet access to those he personally sealed?

"Haha, let me explain," the Immortal Sage replied with a friendly tone.

"This Daoist Yunwu was an elder of the previous generation of the Empty Thief Sect, and he’s quite amusing. Two hundred years ago, he was already at the fourth-grade innate level, so by now, he must have improved significantly.

Two hundred years ago, he broke into one of my caves and stole all the treasures inside—stealing is one thing; after all, the Empty Thief Sect specializes in that. I could have just caught him next time and beaten him half to death.

But unexpectedly, he not only took my stuff but also boasted about how terrible my sealing and formation skills were, claiming breaking into my cave would be child's play. He even said that with my level, even if I used my full sealing technique, he could break free in no time.

And then… I gave him what he asked for. I put in a lot of effort to capture him and sealed him away with a huge meteorite using the Five-Finger Mountain Sealing Method. It’s been over two hundred years since then, and he still hasn’t managed to escape."

Scholar Song could only stare, speechless.

Turns out, boasting without preparation can have serious consequences.

The Immortal Sage continued, "About a month ago, I calculated it was about time to let him out, so I quietly went to check on the sealing location. However, when I sneaked over, I found him actually working on breaking my Five-Finger Mountain Sealing Method. It was quite interesting, and I wanted to see how long it would take him to break my seal. So, I decided not to intervene and just watch quietly."

"Unfortunately, I couldn’t determine how long it would take him to break the seal, and I couldn't monitor him indefinitely. First, I didn’t have that kind of time, and second, if I kept watching him, he would definitely sense it. So... I paid a regular human to pretend to be lost and enter the sealing area."

"After being sealed for two hundred years, Daoist Yunwu was also going a bit stir-crazy. When he saw a person, he got excited and used his magic to confuse that regular human, sending him in daily to learn about the outside world."

"Seeing how interested he was in the outside world, the next day, I had that regular human bring a tablet with a SIM card so he could go online. Of course, I had someone tamper with that tablet—no software download, no web browsing. It only had a few mindless single-player games, and the only app that could connect to the internet was one I had developed called the 'A-Type Chat Software'—I originally planned to perfect the software and transfer our 'Ninefold Land Group' over to it. I didn’t expect it to be used here first."

"That 'A-Type Chat Software' is similar to what we’re using now, with the main server in my hands. So, Daoist Yunwu is the only user of this software."

"Then, I created over three hundred alternate accounts to add him as a friend. I also created a chat group, adding Daoist Yunwu to it, letting my 'avatars' chat with him daily. That regular human was responsible for entering the sealing area each day to tell Daoist Yunwu some trivial news while bringing a power bank to charge the tablet."

Reading this, Scholar Song couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

"So, over the course of a month, Daoist Yunwu started to learn how to chat. Since the tablet could only connect via that 'A-Type Chat Software,' once he got bored of the single-player games, he began boasting about his glorious past in the group every day."

"I had my avatars play along with Daoist Yunwu—some accounts mocked him, some praised him, and some fawned over his stories, keeping him entertained. I made sure Daoist Yunwu thought his 'friends' were just regular humans."

"And then... today, Daoist Yunwu posted that diary entry in the 'A-Type Chat Software.' I just used over a hundred alternate accounts to like it and flooded the comments with praise."

"..." Scholar Song was at a loss for words. How bored must the Immortal Sage be?

At the same time, he recalled an old joke—"Young man, do you really think this group is so lively? In fact, everyone here is just my alternate accounts. It's just you and me in this group. Don’t believe me? I can switch accounts and tell you this again."

Daoist Yunwu was the real-life embodiment of that joke.

With over three hundred friends, all of them were just the Immortal Sage's alternate accounts. The Immortal Sage was having a blast!

At that moment, the Master of Snow Wolf spoke up, "Immortal Sage, what if Daoist Yunwu isn’t that foolish? He might have already suspected the truth and has just been playing with you for the past month?"

After all, anyone who could cultivate to the fifth-grade Spirit Emperor level couldn’t be that naive, could they? 

Perhaps Daoist Yunwu was having a good laugh, scrolling through the 'A-Type Chat Software' while mocking the Immortal Sage for being foolish?

"It doesn’t matter; I’m enjoying myself too," the Immortal Sage chuckled. "Besides, I was going to let him out anyway—having him keep me company for all this time before he escapes is quite amusing."

The Master of Snow Wolf sent a worshipping emoji: "Your realm is truly high, Immortal Sage! I’m in awe!"

Scholar Song also copied the worshipping emoji—however, he recalled Dou Dou mentioning that the Immortal Sage was preparing to break through to the seventh-grade Venerable realm. How could he afford to be so leisurely and play around with Daoist Yunwu?

Just then, in the Ninefold Land group, Scholar Shushan pressured the big guy suddenly spoke up, "Hehe, Little Snow Wolf, you’re still alive?"

That ID name—wasn’t it mine? I didn’t say anything!

Scholar Song quickly turned his head to look at his computer screen.

Then, he saw Venerable White smiling at him—Scholar Song had forgotten to log off after downloading something, so the account "Shushan Pressure Big" was still active on his computer. That last message was sent by Venerable White!

No way! Scholar Song's mouth dropped open. How long has it been since Venerable White started using the computer? He could even type now?

Moreover, didn't he use traditional characters one hundred and fifty years ago? Has he really mastered simplified characters this quickly?

Venerable White, your rapid learning efficiency must be making the natives on that small island in the Pacific, forced to learn Chinese by the head of the Seven Life Symbol Sect, feel utterly ashamed!

"Hello, Venerable White," the Master of Snow Wolf quickly realized it was Venerable White who had spoken and responded promptly.

Shushan Pressure Big: "Let me know when I have time to visit you; your wife should be about to give birth to the little wolf cub, right?"

"Venerable, you are always welcome. The little wolf cubs have already been born!" the Master of Snow Wolf replied, though only he knew whether this was sincere or just polite.

Venerable White scrolled through the group card and asked, "Why haven’t I seen the Six-Eared Sword Lord?"

The Immortal Sage sent a bitter smile emoji: "The Six-Eared Sword Lord fell to inner demons thirty years ago while attempting to reach the seventh-grade Venerable realm and was reduced to ashes in the tribulation fire."

"Even the Six-Eared Sword Lord couldn’t survive that calamity," Venerable White sighed softly, resting his chin on his hand, his gaze distant as he fell into a deep thought.

Scholar Song, who had been on high alert, immediately heightened his focus!

He prepared himself to assist at any moment—if Venerable White decided to perform a 'ground slam' now, the entire floor would likely collapse!

...

...

In the dim depths of Jiangnan Great Prison.

The legless disciple of the Moon Blade Sect, Zhao Buli, was brought into this massive cell.

He wore a look of deep sorrow as he gazed at his "cellmate," a towering Western man with a shaved head. The man's scalp bore six neatly arranged scars...
