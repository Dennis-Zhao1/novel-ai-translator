Heavenly Court... exploded?

Even though the lady from the Nine Lanterns explained that this Heavenly Court was not the same as the one Scholar Song understood from myths, the words "Heavenly Court exploded" still struck him hard.

“How did it explode?” he asked curiously. Since it could be called a 'Heavenly Court,' it should at least be a vast domain, even if it wasn’t as exaggerated as the Nine Heavens from the legends. What kind of explosion could obliterate the entire 'Heavenly Court' in one go?

The lady from Nine Lanterns replied, “There are many theories. The first one is that the powerful Heavenly Emperor who established the Heavenly Court back in the day was researching a terrifying Dao technique, and when it went wrong, it exploded the entire Heavenly Court. It is said that even the Heavenly Emperor himself was turned to dust! But, in reality, strong cultivators know that someone of the Heavenly Emperor's level wouldn't just turn to dust in a single explosion. However, after all these years, there has been no news of the Emperor, which makes people feel that something is off.”

Scholar Song was left speechless.

How could a terrifying Dao technique that accidentally destroyed the entire Heavenly Court be researched in such a reckless manner? It was like trying to develop an atomic bomb in one’s backyard—how much did one enjoy courting disaster?

“The second theory is that the Heavenly Court was attacked by several terrifying forces, including 'Nine Nether,' 'Beast Realm,' and 'Ghost Domain,' among others. During this chaotic battle, the Heavenly Court was blown up,” the lady from Nine Lanterns raised her second finger to explain.

Scholar Song nodded silently. This possibility made sense! He couldn’t help but picture a grand scene of monsters, demons, ghosts, and beasts besieging the Heavenly Court, culminating in its tragic fall—now that would be an epic spectacle!

“The third theory is that the Heavenly Court was secretly sabotaged by the 'New Heavenly Dao,' resulting in a sudden explosion that turned past glories to nothingness,” the lady from Nine Lanterns raised her third finger.

After saying that, she narrowed her eyes and asked, “So, which of these three possibilities do you think is closest to the truth?”

Scholar Song shook his head honestly, “Lady from Nine Lanterns, I’m just an ordinary worker who has been in contact with cultivation for only a few months. I don’t even know what the 'Heavenly Court' is like, so I really can’t answer that.”

“How boring! You could at least take a wild guess,” the lady from Nine Lanterns said as she released the hand she had been holding.

At that moment, Scholar Song noticed that the mist under his feet felt solid, allowing him to stand on it with ease.

After curiously stepping on the clouds a few times, he casually replied, “Guessing randomly isn’t interesting… Besides, compared to the three possibilities, I’m more curious about what you mentioned earlier—the ‘New Heavenly Dao.’ What is that? Can there be a new or old Heavenly Dao?”

The term 'Heavenly Dao' represents ultimate truth, origin, essence, principles, and rules—everything that governs existence. It is intrinsically linked to the practice of cultivation.

But could such an existence really be categorized as 'new' or 'old'?

If the Heavenly Dao were to constantly change, how would cultivators even practice cultivation?

Today it’s "eating watermelon leads to immortality," tomorrow it could change to "eating pumpkin is the key to longevity," and then the day after it might become "eat squash to achieve eternal life." Wouldn’t that just be a nightmare for cultivators?

“The Heavenly Dao is constant and unchanging, but the will of those who govern it has undergone several shifts throughout history,” the lady from Nine Lanterns gazed ahead and said softly. “Our goal as cultivators is immortality—to cultivate our true selves. Ultimately, we will suppress all realms, bear the heavenly mandate, become the sole entity of the universe, and wield the will of the Heavenly Dao. From there, we transcend mere immortality and forge true permanence, becoming indestructible and eternal. In a way, we can say we merge ourselves with the 'Heavenly Dao'!”

Scholar Song asked in confusion, “If one can truly achieve immortality and invulnerability, why has the will of the Heavenly Dao’s rulers changed several times?”

The lady from Nine Lanterns shrugged, “Who knows? I don’t understand either. I’m just a messenger, relaying knowledge I heard from my predecessors. How much you grasp depends on your own imagination.”

Scholar Song nodded and asked his next question, “Then why does the ‘New Heavenly Dao’ want to target the Heavenly Court?”

The lady from Nine Lanterns suddenly burst into laughter, “Young man, that’s a great question! Now you’re asking in the correct flow of conversation. Your previous queries were so disjointed; it made me feel like I had a lump in my throat that I couldn’t clear.”

Scholar Song: “…”

“Cough, why would the ‘New Heavenly Dao’ target the Heavenly Court? Because the Heavenly Court was the strongest force among us cultivators at that time. To strike at cultivators, of course, the first target would be the 'Heavenly Court,'” the lady from Nine Lanterns sighed.

“Strike at cultivators, target the Heavenly Court? Why?” Scholar Song frowned in confusion, and suddenly, a thought struck him: “Is it possible that the New Heavenly Dao is not a cultivator?”

In this world, there are cultivators, and there are also monsters, demons, ghosts, and other beings.

If the one bearing the heavenly mandate and becoming the sole entity of the universe—the 'New Heavenly Dao'—is not a cultivator and perhaps even has a grudge against them, then targeting cultivators makes perfect sense.

“You’re quick on the uptake,” the lady from Nine Lanterns said with a pained expression, “You guessing the answer so quickly reduces my satisfaction in explaining by about eighty percent.”

“I’m sorry,” Scholar Song promptly apologized.

“You guessed correctly; the one who becomes the 'New Heavenly Dao' is not a cultivator. We don't even know the origins of the 'New Heavenly Dao,' its race, or its faction. One night, the 'Heavenly Dao' that we cultivators relied on was replaced by the 'New Heavenly Dao.' It’s said this happened a long time ago… But whenever the surviving seniors in the cultivation world mention that period, their expressions are filled with deep regret,” the lady from Nine Lanterns said gloomily.

Scholar Song rubbed his temples.

How did this topic suddenly become so heavy?

It felt like an employee working hard to gain their boss's appreciation for a promotion, only for the boss to suddenly be replaced by someone who holds a grudge against them just when everything seemed promising.

And, he was just a rookie cultivator; learning about such a terrifying reality had a huge psychological impact on him.

…

…

As the lady from Nine Lanterns continued to share tales of the cultivation world’s past, she led Scholar Song into the Southern Heavenly Gate.

Once inside, Scholar Song looked around and was met with a vast sea of clouds, floating palaces, and countless places where only foundations remained, devoid of palatial structures.

“This is the Heavenly Realm; the great predecessor is located in that massive bronze palace at the deepest part,” the lady from Nine Lanterns pointed towards a grand bronze palace in the depths of the cloud sea.

“The Heavenly Realm… the Heavenly Court. Lady from Nine Lanterns, are you all planning to rebuild the Heavenly Court?” Scholar Song asked.

He spoke with a sense of certainty; anyone who beheld this scene could guess that the lady from Nine Lanterns and her predecessor forces were intent on reconstructing the Heavenly Court!

“Yes, we are indeed in the process of rebuilding the Heavenly Court,” Nine Lanterns acknowledged without hesitation, as this was precisely the information she wished for Scholar Song to know.

Once they left the Heavenly Realm Island, Scholar Song’s memories of this place would be temporarily sealed. Only when he made a certain decision in the future would that seal automatically lift, allowing him to revisit the Heavenly Realm Island.

At that time, Scholar Song would have the opportunity to become part of the Heavenly Realm Island...

“I see, so to prevent the 'New Heavenly Dao' from learning about your plans to rebuild the Heavenly Court, all cultivators leaving this place have chosen to seal their memories?” Scholar Song speculated.

“It’s not that simple,” the lady from Nine Lanterns smiled.

Just that alone wouldn’t compel cultivators to willingly seal their memories.

After all, sealing memories could easily lead to a loss of spirit, making future advancements in cultivation significantly harder.

“The matter of rebuilding the Heavenly Court concerns the future of every cultivator. If you want to know more, you should ask the great predecessor,” the lady from Nine Lanterns said, leading Scholar Song past a palace.

In an instant, Scholar Song felt as if he had crossed an invisible barrier and entered a different world.

“Real Illusion!” Scholar Song exclaimed.

There was no mistaking that feeling. He had personally experienced the 'Real Illusion' of the White Venerable before, and it felt exactly like this.

“Indeed, it is a Real Illusion. It seems you’ve encountered a venerable-level cultivator before,” Nine Lanterns smiled slightly. “Moreover, the Real Illusion was also the greatest secret of the Heavenly Court back in the day.”

As they spoke, Nine Lanterns continued to guide Scholar Song, soon arriving at the entrance of the ancient bronze palace.

Scholar Song took a deep breath.

He resolved that once he entered the ancient palace, he would say nothing, ask nothing, and remain curious about nothing. After sealing his memories, he would just leave the Heavenly Realm Island.

He had a strong feeling that being overly curious would lead to trouble.

…

…

On the other side.

In the jungle of the Heavenly Realm Island.

The old professor was carefully bending down to cut a leaf, delicately placing it in his pocket, looking quite satisfied.

Suddenly, a gigantic worm-like creature burst from the ground, swallowing the old professor whole in one bite.

Blood sprayed everywhere… the old professor screamed in agony.

The passengers behind him were terrified, huddling together, screaming and crying.

Just as it seemed the old professor was about to meet his end, flames burst forth from his body, and moments later, he transformed into particles of light and vanished.

This was the third method of leaving the Heavenly Realm Island—die once, and you’ll be promptly sent back home. Moreover, when you return, you’ll be treated with a high-efficiency healing spell, revitalizing you from head to toe, inside and out.

Of course, this healing spell came with a small fee, as the Heavenly Realm Island is a place of 'absolute fair trade.'

Yes, this was also the correct answer to the lady from Nine Lanterns when she assured Scholar Song that “ordinary people’s lives would never be in danger.”
