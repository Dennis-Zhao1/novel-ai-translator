Chapter One: The Explosion and the Discovery

After the earth-shattering boom, it felt exhilarating! (One update, please send in your monthly votes!)

Why did it have to explode? What an unfortunate turn of events!

Scholar Song couldn't help but lament, activating the ‘Armor Talisman’ in his hand with lightning speed, his heart aching at the loss. 

This was his last Armor Talisman! Using it meant he would be without this vital means of protection for a long time to come!

As the talisman activated, the energy within transformed into a protective barrier that enveloped Scholar Song, forming an all-encompassing shield.

Boom!

The core of the meteorite exploded, unleashing a torrent of high-temperature flames that engulfed and consumed Scholar Song.

Simultaneously, the explosion sent countless shards of meteorite flying like bullets, hurtling towards him!

Clang! Clang! Clang! The protective layer of the Armor Talisman shook violently, rippling like water swirls with each impact.

Scholar Song’s expression shifted as he pushed off the ground, swiftly retreating from the epicenter of the explosion. The talisman was supposed to withstand the full force of a third-grade cultivator's attack, yet it was visibly unstable under these impacts!

Those shards, propelled by the explosive force, each bore the force of a typical third-grade cultivator's strike!

Scholar Song swallowed nervously, relieved that he had blown the meteorite apart on a remote hillside. If he had done it at home, his father would have surely fainted in the bathroom, contemplating a move to a new house!

Swish! Swish! Swish! The fiery meteorite fragments continued to fly, many of them heading straight for the tractor parked nearby.

At that moment, the ‘Reinforced Chassis’ formation placed on the tractor by Venerable White finally ran out of energy after enduring the repeated shocks.

The tractor's body was instantly riddled with holes, becoming a colander. At the same time, the intense flames from the meteorite set the tractor ablaze.

With a loud boom, this flashy tractor, capable of going 150 miles per hour, met its spectacular end after experiencing thrills that no other tractor could ever hope to endure.

Even in death, it contributed all its energy, radiating one last burst of light and heat!

A chain reaction of explosions!

“Does it have to be this thrilling?” Scholar Song managed a bitter smile as he activated the ‘Gentleman’s Journey’ footwork to its fullest, using the remaining strength of the Armor Talisman to escape the dual explosion site as fast as he could.

…

…

After a considerable amount of time…

The residual force of the explosions finally dissipated.

Scholar Song checked his Armor Talisman; its power had dwindled to a mere thin layer…

“How terrifying! If I hadn’t had the talisman, I wouldn’t have died, but I’d have lost half my life!” he thought anxiously.

Once he confirmed that the explosions had ceased, Scholar Song lightly leaped back to the site.

The place where the meteorite had been was now a deep crater.

The tractor was utterly unrecognizable, reduced to a heap of blackened scrap metal. The few A4 paper talismans attached to the tractor by Venerable White had lost their magical properties and were now just regular paper, burned to ashes in the flames.

“Tsk tsk, now I won’t even need to trouble Brother Zhou Li.”

With the tractor in such a state, it was entirely useless. Now he just had to spend some money to clean up the wreckage.

Then, Scholar Song approached the crater left by the meteorite explosion.

Why had the meteorite suddenly exploded? Even if the residual sword energy from Venerable White and Master Yunwu clashed within the meteorite, it shouldn't have turned it into a bomb, right?

Unless, something inside the meteorite had been activated, reacting with the sword energy, causing the explosion.

Scholar Song’s gaze fell into the pit, and sure enough, he spotted something.

It was a fist-sized, dark yet diamond-like gem. Remarkably, amidst the violent explosion, this gem had remained intact, resting in the center of the crater.

“Indeed, there’s something!” He carefully jumped into the pit and cautiously extended his finger towards the gem.

A chilling sensation traveled through his fingertip; even after the violent explosion, the gem's temperature remained unchanged.

“Could it be that when the meteorite hit Master Yunwu, it was ablaze? But by the time I went to move it, the flames had extinguished, and the entire meteorite had turned cold? So it was all because of this black stone…” Scholar Song pondered.

This thing had to be a treasure.

It might even be the ‘Enlightenment Stone’ that Venerable White had mentioned days ago!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At that moment, over a thousand meters away from the explosion site, a slender figure stood watching.

This figure had long green hair tied into adorable twin ponytails. She wore a cyan qipao that accentuated her slim yet voluptuous figure.

Her name was Mistress Scallion, a three-hundred-year-old scallion spirit!

Three hundred years of cultivation—was she afraid of anything?

However… when it came to recounting her three hundred years of experiences, Mistress Scallion couldn’t help but shed tears.

Three hundred years ago, she was just an ordinary wild scallion, fortunate enough to take root near a naturally occurring spiritual spring. Day after day, year after year, one day, she suddenly became a scallion spirit.

To be honest, she had no idea why she became a spirit.

But hey, she became a spirit, so she would live happily as a cute scallion spirit!

True to her word, she lived carefree in the deep mountains and forests for several years.

Until one day… a monster organization called ‘The World’s Monsters Unite to Become One Family’ approached her and gave her the name ‘Mistress Scallion.’

This organization taught Mistress Scallion a set of ‘Two Hundred Essential Skills for Monsters to Survive.’

These two hundred skills were a dazzling array of abilities.

Among them were ‘Sacred Thieving Techniques,’ ‘How to Team Up to Rob Human Cultivators Successfully,’ ‘Five Hundred Ways to Surrender When Outmatched by Human Cultivators,’ and ‘Charm Techniques for Beautiful Female Monsters.’

There were also skills like ‘How to Become the Mistress’s Mistress and Engage in Palace Intrigues’ and ‘Seventy-Two Methods for Male Monsters to Win Over the Mistress and Displace Their Partners.’ Various skills abounded.

Recalling these ‘Two Hundred Essential Skills,’ Mistress Scallion felt like crying—yet, back then, the naive her truly believed these ‘skills’ were grand techniques and studied them earnestly.

Until one day, Mistress Scallion felt she had mastered the arts and was ready to find a human cultivator to try out her skills.

Three hundred years ago, the atmosphere in the Hua Xia cultivation world was somewhat strange; most human cultivators hid their tracks, making it hard to spot them in the mortal realm—something seemed to have changed drastically in the human cultivation world.

But Mistress Scallion didn’t give up; she kept searching!

Hard work pays off!

Finally, one day, she found a human monk.

He was a handsome monk, named Jiu Deng. He had thick eyebrows and big eyes, a shiny bald head, and a tall, lean figure with impressive pectoral muscles.

Mistress Scallion was overjoyed to finally encounter a human cultivator.

So, she began to display everything she had learned!

Let’s briefly describe the process:

First, Mistress Scallion used the ‘Sacred Thieving Techniques’ on Jiu Deng. The technique succeeded, and she managed to obtain a scroll of the ‘Lion’s Roar Technique’ from the Buddhist sect.

Upon being attacked by the skill, Jiu Deng immediately retaliated, unleashing various Buddhist techniques that Mistress Scallion had never seen before; their power was immense!

Mistress Scallion was stunned and quickly attempted to use the ‘How to Team Up to Rob Human Cultivators Successfully’ skill.

However, the skill failed because she had no teammates!

Terrified, Mistress Scallion quickly switched to another skill—‘Five Hundred Ways to Surrender When Outmatched by Human Cultivators!’

The skill succeeded halfway!

Why halfway? Because while Jiu Deng agreed to her request for surrender, he insisted on taking her back to the temple for five hundred years of confinement.

Five hundred years? A little scallion spirit like her would surely turn into a scallion stalk after being sealed for five hundred years! How could she play happily then? No way!

So, Mistress Scallion rallied herself once more, using her next skill—‘Charm Techniques for Beautiful Female Monsters!’

This skill was an unprecedented success!

To what extent? Mistress Scallion, looking back now, couldn't find the words to describe the effect of this skill.

In short, it might be summarized in one phrase—afterward, Jiu Deng had a very enjoyable experience!

…

…

Not long after the skill was cast.

Mistress Scallion sat dazedly on the ground, feeling like something was off about the skill she had used yesterday—it wasn’t quite as her teacher had described it.

“Come back to the temple with me,” Jiu Deng said.

And then, the innocent Mistress Scallion was taken back to a temple by Jiu Deng, locked away in a Buddhist pagoda.

From that day on, Jiu Deng never reappeared.

…

…

Over the years of being confined in the pagoda, Mistress Scallion didn’t feel much resistance, aside from her lack of freedom.

Most days, only a few young monks would come to bring her food and drink. Occasionally, a young monk would come by to recite scriptures for her.

Moreover, an old monk would come to teach her the cultivation methods of the Buddhist sect, imparting knowledge about the cultivation world and various incidents.

Thanks to this knowledge, Mistress Scallion realized how ridiculous her ‘Two Hundred Essential Skills for Monsters to Survive’ were.

She began diligently practicing the Buddhist techniques, with the aspiration to one day achieve great mastery and—then, she would definitely get back at Jiu Deng for trapping her!

Unfortunately, Mistress Scallion seemed to be innately incompatible with the Buddhist teachings; her progress in cultivating the techniques was painfully slow. Nearly three hundred years had passed, and she hadn’t even broken through to the first-grade Transcendence realm, having only opened her heart, eyes, and nose. It took her a century to open each sense.

Mistress Scallion was on the verge of going crazy…

Just a year ago, an old monk released her from the pagoda.

Then, she aimlessly roamed across Hua Xia, trying to find ways to improve her realm. She had a grand goal—she wanted to achieve mastery!

“That place of the explosion seems to have a treasure’s aura?” Mistress Scallion murmured to herself.
