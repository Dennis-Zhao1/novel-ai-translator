**Fatherly Love is as Solid as a Mountain**

“Yo, that kid finally logged on!” Brother Sanri chuckled, springing high into the air and executing a stunning 360-degree spin before slamming the ball through the hoop with a powerful dunk.

The beautiful basket drew cheers from the surrounding brothers.

“Substitute, substitute! Damn, I almost pulled my back just now. This showing off is exhausting. If I didn’t use my true energy, I could’ve just done a simple 180-degree spin. Speaking of, we need to convince Master to build a sturdier basketball court—one where we can use our true essence and spiritual energy; now that would be fun!” Brother Sanri twisted his waist playfully, laughing as he swapped places with a junior.

He then grabbed his phone and sent a message to Scholar Song: “Brother Shuhang, are you online? I tried calling you yesterday, but your phone was off. Are you with Venerable White?”

Scholar Song quickly received the message and replied, “Haha, sorry Brother Sanri! My phone died yesterday. I just got home today, and Venerable White is right next to me.”

“Ha! Have Venerable White confirm your location so I can send you the supplementary techniques for ‘Immovable Diamond Body’ via flying sword,” Brother Sanri replied with a grin.

The reason for using a flying sword for communication instead of a direct computer transfer was that techniques like these required complete confidentiality; they must never leak!

While online transfers are convenient, they come with the risk of exposure. Thus, they are only used for less critical tips about spiritual power. For instance, Brother Sanri had previously shared with Scholar Song the ‘Mark Sensation Method,’ ‘Mental Marking Technique,’ and ‘Temporary Sword Control Technique.’

True cultivation techniques, however, must be transmitted physically. Even the USB drive used for this purpose is heavily sealed to prevent theft.

“Got it, I’ll let Venerable White know,” Scholar Song replied, then casually asked, “By the way, Brother Sanri, do you have the usage method for ‘Charging Technique’?”

Brother Sanri responded, “Charging Technique? Oh, right! I think there’s such a little spell. But before you learn it, you need to transform the energy within you into lightning-type power. You can learn it once you advance to the second rank True Master. By the way, aren’t you in the Ninefold Land No. 1 group? I remember that little spell was invented by a senior in that group; you might find the training method in the group space.”

“Thanks, brother!” Scholar Song replied, then turned to look at Venerable White.

Venerable White was munching on some waxberries with gusto. 

“Senior, Brother Sanri wants to send me a flying sword message and needs you to confirm our location. Is that okay?” Scholar Song inquired.

“Sanri? Is he that disciple from Tongxuan? Wow, he’s improved so quickly! That little brat has already reached the fourth rank and can control his sword now; young people today are impressive. When I saw him a few hundred years ago, he had just joined Tongxuan and was just a little squirt,” Venerable White nodded, reminiscing with a hint of nostalgia.

However, Scholar Song felt a sense of dissonance seeing Venerable White act all senior-like. Could it be because Venerable White looked way too youthful?

Venerable White stepped onto the balcony, raised his finger to the sky, and held still.

……

……

Meanwhile, at Tianya Wandering Temple.

Brother Sanri held his finger up to the sky, confirming the location with Venerable White.

“Brother, I borrowed the flying sword for messaging,” a little monk rushed over, sweat dripping down his face as he carried a small black iron sword.

This was the same sword used by Master Tongxuan and the Alchemical Sage for communication, and it seemed to have a special connection with Scholar Song.

“This flying sword is truly the one used by the abbot for messaging; it’s so heavy!” The little monk struggled, feeling as if he was carrying a person.

“The sword is made of sturdy material, which is why it’s normal for it to be heavy,” Brother Sanri chuckled. He then set up multiple seals on a USB drive; if anyone attempted to forcibly break the seals, the USB would explode.

After placing the USB on the flying sword, he formed a hand seal: “Sword Control Technique, go!”

Swish!

The black iron flying sword, with the USB, shot up into the sky, disappearing into the clouds in a flash.

Many disciples looked at Brother Sanri enviously, admiring his ability to fly with a sword at such a young age. Brother Sanri had become a goal for many disciples at Tianya Wandering Temple.

“Keep going! Whoever’s tired next can swap with me!” Brother Sanri laughed as he squeezed toward the edge of the basketball court, ready to take over when a junior got tired.

Although he was a true disciple of Master Tongxuan, Brother Sanri never put on airs and maintained great relationships with his fellow brothers.

……

……

In the Alchemical Sage’s residence.

Venerable White retracted his finger: “Done. The flying sword message should arrive in about four to five hours.”

“Thanks, Venerable White.”

Scholar Song then opened his computer and browsed through the resources shared in the Ninefold Land No. 1 group, searching the lengthy list of shared documents.

Found it!

**[Title: Are you still troubled by your phone running out of battery while out? Are you frustrated when your electronic devices suddenly lose power during adventures? Try the Charging Technique, and worry no more! Fellow Cultivators, who wants to give it a shot? — Wild Blade of Three Tides!]**

Ah, just from the title, it was clear that it was written by the Wild Blade of Three Tides.

Due to the excessive fluff in the title, Scholar Song had previously overlooked it multiple times while browsing the shared documents. He hadn’t expected it to contain a useful little spell.

However, it was surprising that the Wild Blade was developing such a minor technique; it seemed so out of character. It felt like his specialty was more about self-destructive antics rather than spell research.

Scholar Song opened the document and began to study the principles of the ‘Charging Technique.’

Half an hour later… he looked up, stars dancing before his eyes.

Although this ‘Charging Technique’ was just a minor spell, the Wild Blade of Three Tides had filled the description with complex cultivation principles and a plethora of specialized terminologies; Scholar Song found it completely incomprehensible.

The techniques shared by the Drunken Moon Scholar had been straightforward and easy to grasp, but this one felt like it was meant for advanced practitioners.

Good thing I have Venerable White!

Scholar Song turned to look at Venerable White again.

Venerable White met Scholar Song’s gaze and then resumed munching on waxberries: “Munch, munch, munch…”

Yep, Venerable White really loved waxberries; the big box was almost empty now.

“Senior, I have this ‘Charging Technique’ spell, but I can’t understand it at all,” Scholar Song pointed at the content on the screen.

“Let me take a look,” Venerable White leaned closer, his fingers gliding across the screen lightly.

A few seconds later.

“Hmm, I’ve grasped the basic usage method. I’ll try it out later, and once I learn it, I’ll teach you,” Venerable White replied.

“Thanks, Senior!” Scholar Song's fist pumped in excitement: “I’m so glad you’re here to guide me!”

“Hmm, no need to be polite,” Venerable White replied calmly. “By the way, I remembered something. Yesterday, the agent for the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain called again, saying that all the cars ordered by the Immortal Sage would arrive the day after tomorrow. We should go and finalize the contract when we have the time.”

“Sure, no problem.” Scholar Song nodded.

At the same time, he anticipated that once they received this batch of cars, he’d also need to return home.

With summer vacation approaching, it was only natural to go home. Otherwise, his mother, Mother Song, would be worried sick.

Moreover, he was eager to let his close family try the ‘Spiritual Pulse Tea’ to improve their health.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Two hours later.

In the Ninefold Land No. 1 group.

Fay Yu logged in and first sent a sweet smiley face, then replied: “@Book Mountain Pressure, Senior Song, I think the same! This mysterious island is too dangerous for us. Besides, I found a great place! Hehe, this morning I found a treasure map in my dad’s notes, and it looks really fun! Senior Song, let’s go treasure hunting!”

“A treasure map? That sounds great! Young people should explore more, go for it, Fay Yu!” Hermit of North River was the first to respond.

However, he thought to himself: Being a parent isn’t easy. The Immortal Sage of Lingdie truly cares.

To prevent his daughter from enthusiastically wanting to go to the mysterious island, the Immortal Sage of Lingdie quickly conjured a treasure map to redirect her focus. Not only does it satisfy her adventurous spirit, but he is also careful not to let her discover anything amiss.

Who knows, the treasure location might have been meticulously set up by the Immortal Sage himself…

Such is the heartache of parents everywhere.

Book Mountain Pressure replied: “Alright! I’m free for the entire summer break these two months. Just let me know when you’re ready to set off, Fay Yu.”

“Mm-hmm, I have some small matters to prepare. Once I’m done with those, I’ll gather my gear and head out!” Fay Yu said happily, then added, “Oh, right, Senior Song! The ‘Spiritual Pulse Green Tea’ I personally picked is in its final tea-making stage. Once it’s done, I can send it to you. I’ll need an address that can receive it when you send it!”

“Sure, thanks, Fay Yu,” Scholar Song smiled.

Speaking of which, he had been taken care of by Fay Yu for so long; he should find an opportunity to return the favor.

Just as he was pondering, a new ID popped up in the Ninefold Land No. 1 group.

Dou Dou Dawang: “Yellow Mountain, Yellow Mountain! When are you bringing me back?”

While Scholar Song was away from home, Dou Dou applied for an account and joined the Ninefold Land No. 1 group.

After a moment, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain replied: “Soon.”

“If you don’t come for me in half a month, I’ll chew your ‘Jade Palace Sky Weaver’ into a sieve,” Dou Dou threatened.

“……” The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain broke into a cold sweat—his ‘Jade Palace Sky Weaver’ was his treasure. That was a celestial vessel, akin to a luxury car for cultivators. It always made him feel proud when he took it out.

Dou Dou was known for being serious; if it said it would chew, it would indeed chew!

“Also, I want to learn how to drive!” Dou Dou added.

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain replied: “Stop messing around. What do you want to learn to drive for?”
