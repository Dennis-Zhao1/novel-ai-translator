**The Young Man in the Blue Robe on the White Horse**

    All around him was a sea of yellow sand, not a single blade of grass in sight, just an expanse of deathly silence.

    Scholar Song couldn’t help but smile wryly; he had never learned how to survive in the desert. On top of that, his current cultivation level was insufficient to use the retreat technique, and he hadn’t brought along any retreat pills today.

    Was this how his life was finally going to end? — July 3rd, 2019, Scholar Song had crossed over.

    And then, death?

    “I don’t want to die like this! I can’t give up… I was just stepping through the door when I ended up in this desert. If Venerable White and Dou Dou are at home, they should sense something’s wrong, right?” Scholar Song rubbed his temples, trying to analyze the situation calmly.

    With Venerable White’s cultivation at the seventh rank, if he sensed something unusual, he would surely be able to rescue him, right?

    For now, all he could do was hang on. If possible, it was best to find a way out of this desert. At the very least… he needed to find a water source.

    Putting away his phone, Scholar Song made his way through the desert as straight as he could.

    This desert was barren and desolate, with no landmarks to identify. Moreover, the sky was devoid of the sun, moon, or stars, making it even harder for him to maintain a straight course, despite his keen eyesight. He could only do his best.

    Speaking of which, this desert had many strange aspects. There was no sun in the sky, yet the desert was bright as day and sweltering hot. Who knows where all this light and heat was coming from? Did this world not have to obey the laws of energy conservation?

    ……

    ……

    After walking for about ten minutes, Scholar Song still found himself surrounded by yellow sand, without a single plant or animal in sight; it was nothing but silence.

    Being in such a stark and monotonous world for too long could easily drive someone insane.

    “Even a fly would be better than this,” Scholar Song lamented. At this moment, he wouldn’t even mind the annoying buzzing of a fly.

    Just as he was feeling despondent, a melodious jingling sound suddenly came from the distance.

    He looked up and saw a young man in a blue robe, leading a white horse, slowly approaching him from afar.

    The young man looked to be around fifteen or sixteen, with rosy lips and pearly white teeth, his skin as smooth as jade — a strikingly handsome boy.

    Finally, he had encountered a living person! Scholar Song couldn’t help but feel a surge of relief.

    At this moment, the young man in the blue robe also spotted Scholar Song, and he suddenly called out joyfully, “Little White, Little White! I finally found you!”

    Scholar Song was puzzled. Was this boy referring to him as "Little White"?

    Did I not only cross over but also have my soul transferred? Did I leave my body behind?

    No! I still have my phone with me! Moreover, the clothes on my body, the opened heart and eye orifices, and the Phantom Spirit curled up in my heart orifice all proved that this was indeed his body, not just a soul transfer!

    “Little White, where did you run off to? I thought you were lost!” The young man in the blue robe came up to Scholar Song, revealing a bright smile that could light up the day.

    “Hello, young brother, I think you’ve mistaken me for someone else,” Scholar Song replied, cupping his hands in salute, given the boy's ancient attire.

    However, the young man in the blue robe seemed to ignore Scholar Song's words. He pulled the horse aside and said, “Little White, shall we practice some punches?”

    Scholar Song frowned. “Young brother, who are you? You’ve definitely mistaken me for someone else; I’m not the Little White you speak of.”

    But the young man chuckled lightly and, like a fierce tiger, lunged at Scholar Song.

    Scholar Song vaguely saw a phantom tiger behind the young man, roaring through the forest as a palm shot toward his forehead. If this hit him, his head might just burst!

    “Can’t we chat without it turning violent?!” Scholar Song raised his hand like a claw, aiming for the young man's wrist — Basic Fist Technique, Level Three! At the same time, his claw concealed a change, ready to transform into a palm or knife strike to cut down his opponent.

    “Hehe.” The young man smiled, seemingly aware of Scholar Song's changes. Midway, he altered his attack, transforming his palm into a finger and pointing directly at Scholar Song.

    This finger landed precisely on the flaw in Scholar Song’s punch, causing him immense discomfort and forcing him to change his move.

    Scholar Song transformed his claw into a straight punch: Basic Fist Technique, Level One!

    The punch came in like a heavy cannonball, direct and powerful, relying solely on brute strength.

    “Hehe!” The young man continued smiling; his finger twisted with lightning speed, landing on Scholar Song’s wrist.

    Scholar Song felt a tingle in his right fist as a powerful blow was effortlessly deflected. He rubbed his wrist and quickly retreated two steps.

    The young man did not seize the opportunity to attack; he simply gazed at Scholar Song, smiling innocently, “Let’s go again, Little White!”

    “Basic Fist Technique, Level Two!” Scholar Song decisively switched tactics, his punch becoming a meteor, a storm of fists raining down upon the young man. If he couldn't win with strength, he'd win with speed and quantity!

    However, the young man’s body swayed like a willow in the wind, deftly dodging.

    All of Scholar Song’s lightning-fast punches missed him entirely! Not a single hit!

    Were his punches too slow?

    “Hah!” Scholar Song ignited the blood energy within his heart orifice and continued executing the Basic Fist Technique, Level Two. Under the influence of this power, his punches sped up dramatically, their lethality increasing as if he were firing a machine gun.

    The young man still wore a smile, suddenly leaping into the air, temporarily evading Scholar Song’s assault. Then, with a swift finger, he pointed.

    His gaze was sharp as an eagle’s, and this finger slipped through Scholar Song’s barrage of punches, landing on his right shoulder.

    Scholar Song felt a tingle in his shoulder, and the power behind his punch wavered, causing Basic Fist Technique, Level Two to falter.

    Using the force of his finger, the young man spun mid-air, delivering a whip kick aimed at Scholar Song.

    Scholar Song, having been disrupted and exhausted from his previous efforts, took the full brunt of the kick, sent flying across the desert, rolling several times before managing to counter the force.

    The young man laughed, “Little White, let’s go again!”

    Is he a madman?

    Scholar Song felt frustrated… but he had no choice but to fight back. If he didn’t, the young man would just come over and beat him up! He didn’t have a penchant for lying on the ground being beaten senseless; he could only resist!

    ……

    ……

    Fifteen minutes later, Scholar Song had executed the entire Basic Fist Technique from start to finish, yet he hadn’t even grazed the hem of the young man’s robe.

    No matter which move he used, the young man would always counter with a single finger. His fingers were like the legendary “Dugu Nine Swords,” finding and exploiting the flaws in Scholar Song's techniques with every point.

    Thanks to him, Scholar Song realized many of the errors in his fist techniques and corrected them for the next attempt.

    Another fifteen minutes passed.

    He executed the Basic Fist Technique once more, but just like before, he didn’t lay a finger on the young man. Time and time again, he was countered with a single point, and Scholar Song had lost count of how many times he had been hit, his entire body feeling numb.

    “Hehe.” The young man chuckled again, repeating, “Let’s go again, Little White!”

    “Basic Fist Technique, Level Two!” Scholar Song gritted his teeth; he realized that the only effective way to counter the young man’s “Dugu Nine Swords”-like finger was with the Basic Fist Technique, Level Two.

    The reason he kept being countered was his lack of speed and insufficient number of punches!

    Whether it was using brute force to overcome wisdom or relying on speed alone, once a single force reached its peak, it would achieve miraculous results.

    Scholar Song decided to forgo all other techniques, channeling his heart orifice’s blood energy to unleash a barrage of punches with the Basic Fist Technique, ignoring everything else.

    About half an hour later…

    Scholar Song collapsed to the ground, unable to rise.

    His body had been struck by the young man's fingers, feeling as if he had been electrocuted, twitching involuntarily.

    “Hey, Little White, let’s call it a day here. I’ll come back to play with you tomorrow!” The young man laughed, hopped on his horse.

    With the sound of tinkling bells, he soon vanished from Scholar Song's sight.

    “Wait! If you’re leaving, at least take me with you!” Scholar Song shouted from behind, but his numb body wouldn’t allow him to stand.

    He could only lie on the ground, twitching, watching as the young man disappeared without a trace.

    What on earth was happening?

    ＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

    Scholar Song lay on the scorching sand for a long time, resting until the red spots from the young man’s finger strikes finally disappeared. After regaining some strength, he managed to stand up.

    “That little brat,” Scholar Song cursed internally. How could you beat someone up and then just leave them in the desert?

    Don’t let me see you again, or else… or else… damn it, even if I meet that young man again, I wouldn’t be able to defeat him!

    If I encounter him again, I won’t be able to do anything about it.

    Ding ding ding~~ The sound of cheerful bells rang out.

    Scholar Song looked up and saw the young man in the blue robe leading a white horse, swiftly approaching him once more.

    Was he finally having a change of heart and coming back for him? Scholar Song thought to himself.

    “Little White, where did you run off to? I thought you were lost!” The young man cheerfully ran up to Scholar Song, flashing a bright smile that could light up even the sun.

    Wait, this line sounded familiar…

    “We just met, for crying out loud!” Scholar Song yelled in frustration.

    Yet the young man paid no heed to Scholar Song’s furious outburst. He pulled the horse aside and said, “Little White, shall we practice the sword?”

    “Again? I just finished practicing punches with you, and my body feels like it’s about to fall apart! Besides, I haven’t learned any sword techniques. How can I train with you?” Scholar Song shouted. And didn’t you say you’d come back in a day? Why are you here again in the blink of an eye?

    But the young man seemed to be deaf to Scholar Song’s complaints; he dismounted his horse and pulled out two identical long swords, tossing one toward Scholar Song.

    The blade glinted sharply in the sunlight, clearly a fine weapon capable of severing hair!

    Scholar Song snorted coldly; since the young man wouldn’t listen to him, why should he play along? He took a step back, letting the sword fall at his feet.

    Scholar Song crossed his arms defiantly, adopting a posture of ‘I’m not cooperating!’

    One hand cannot clap alone; that’s just how it is.
