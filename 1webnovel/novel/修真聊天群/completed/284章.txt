**Cut, cut, cut the plane!**

A small green light was still flickering with a golden glow?

Scholar Song's heart raced with a bad premonition. Could it be that he was about to encounter that mysterious island?

Just as he was thinking this, Gao, one of his companions, confirmed his fears with his next words.

“It’s getting closer! I can vaguely see… a small island?” Gao widened his eyes, rubbed them vigorously, and then bitterly smiled, “That island seems to be floating in the air? Am I really just imagining things?”

Beside him, Tu Bo chuckled wryly, “It really is a small island.”

Ya Yi chimed in, “It’s definitely floating.”

Scholar Song was speechless.

What a disaster! He had previously thought that if he encountered the 'mysterious island' during this trip to the East Sea, he could always just choose not to go in!

When their predecessors, the Wild Blade of Three Tides, the Hermit of North River, and the Elder of Ancient Lake, encountered the mysterious island, it was their own will that drove them to explore.

But now that Scholar Song knew entering the mysterious island would lead to amnesia, he certainly wouldn't choose to go inside.

Yet he never expected the mysterious island would be so sneaky, even going invisible!

If Gao and Tu Bo hadn’t been beside him, pointing out the floating island ahead, Scholar Song might have dashed right into it without a second thought!

“Why is it that the seniors in the group can choose whether or not to enter the mysterious island, while I feel like I’m being forced to go in?” Scholar Song pondered for a moment, silently touching his chest.

Although it was no longer visible, he knew there was a causal line connecting the Daoist Stone in his pocket to Mistress Scallion, and from her to the 'Nine Lanterns' in the 'Sky City.'

If the Sky City was indeed the mysterious island, could it be that this causal line was at work, trying to pull him onto the island?

Could it really be that deceptive?

“Heh, if you want to drag me up there, I’m just not going,” Scholar Song silently resolved.

He then said to his companions, “I feel like that island definitely has issues; let’s avoid it!”

“Agreed, that’s what I think too,” Gao said, a shiver running down his spine at the thought of that floating island.

Tu Bo was overly curious and eager for knowledge. “I think we should check it out!”

“Gao, where is that island now? Let’s steer clear of it,” Scholar Song automatically dismissed Tu Bo's suggestion.

“It’s over in that direction.” Gao pointed to where he saw the 'floating island.'

Scholar Song nodded, maneuvering the plane to change its course, carefully avoiding the location of the floating island.

The plane continued to fly for a long while...

“Did we avoid it?” Scholar Song asked, his voice laced with uncertainty.

Since he couldn’t see the floating island through the darkness in front of him, he could only ask.

“We avoided it!” Gao replied, nodding.

Scholar Song sighed in relief.

Then… the plane continued onward.

Just as they were flying, suddenly, a brilliant light appeared ahead!

Gao, Tu Bo, and Ya Yi squinted their eyes against the sudden brightness.

“Finally, have we broken through that dark area?” Scholar Song’s heart leaped with joy. He opened his eye aperture, quickly adapting to the light.

In the blink of an eye, he adjusted to the dazzling brightness before him.

He gazed greedily at the scenery ahead, eager to see where they had ended up.

Upon opening his eyes, Scholar Song's eyes immediately moistened.

Before him lay a vast jungle. The trees were enormous, soaring towards the heavens, exuding an aura of grandeur. Scholar Song wasn’t a botanist and couldn’t identify the species of these towering trees, but he felt they were completely out of place in this era.

At the end of the majestic jungle was an endless expanse of grassland, so vast that when the breeze swept through, the grass swayed like ocean waves.

Then… Scholar Song spotted a familiar sight.

It was a massive crescent-shaped lake, identical to the crescent lake he had seen in his dream of the 'Sky City' while on the plane.

Seeing the crescent lake made his heart ache. If his dreams on the plane were real, lurking beneath the surface of this lake was a massive fish over ten meters long. And that was just the small part of its body that breached the water's surface; who knew how terrifying the rest of it was?

At the same time, he was certain that the island below was undoubtedly the magnificent 'Sky City' from his dreams. Moreover, there was over a seventy percent chance that the Sky City was the mysterious island.

[Am I destined to lose my memory after all?] Scholar Song's eyes brimmed with tears.

And… why did I avoid the floating island, yet still end up here?

Can someone please explain what’s going on?

Don't tell me Gao and the others saw just a mirage, the reflection of the floating island. The real floating island is right in front of my flight path, waiting for me to walk right into its trap?

That's just too despicable!

……

“Beautiful!” Ya Yi, having adjusted to the light, nestled closer to Gao.

Tu Bo was equally awestruck, marveling at the stunning scenery.

In the cabin, about twenty passengers remained, all sensing the changes outside the plane. They rushed to the windows to catch a glimpse.

“Oh, so beautiful!” Scholar Song's nominal disciple, Joseph, exclaimed loudly. Joseph was an avid traveler, often taking his family around the globe.

However, he couldn’t recall any beautiful place that compared to the enchanting scene before them.

Yes, enchanting. This was a picture-perfect scene straight out of a fairy tale or a movie, so breathtaking that it could rival any legendary paradise!

“Have we been saved? Did we finally cross that damn dark area?” the slightly plump flight attendant cheered loudly.

“No one is glowing with flames anymore, and no one has vanished! Are we safe?” a white-collar woman exclaimed, her tone filled with relief and joy.

Lu Fei's sister also approached the window, asking, “But what place is this?”

“I don’t know; there’s no signal on my phone. Could it be an island in the East Sea?” Lu Fei pulled out her phone to check.

“Maybe it’s because we’re inside the plane that the signal is disrupted. We’ll check once we land,” Zhuge Yue suggested, pulling out a camera and starting to film the view outside.

Zhuge Yue, a member of the school’s news team, instinctively documented the strange, interesting, and unique sights before them.

Zhuge Zhongyang quietly sighed in relief, grateful that everyone in his party was safe. Had anything happened to anyone he invited on this trip, he would have blamed himself for life.

……

In the cockpit.

“Scholar Song, should we find a place to land?” Gao asked, puzzled.

“Let me try something first,” Scholar Song replied.

Of course, Scholar Song wasn’t trying to land; he wanted to see if he could break through the 'floating island' and return to reality!

However, when he attempted to increase the plane’s altitude and speed, his expression suddenly changed.

No matter how much he pushed the throttle, it felt as if the plane had lost all power and was steadily descending.

What’s going on?

Scholar Song’s mind raced.

Quickly, he recalled some information mentioned by the seniors in the Ninefold Land group regarding the 'mysterious island.'

For instance, at the entrance of the mysterious island, there was a 'forbidden air formation.' Even a fifth-grade Golden Core Spirit Emperor could only land upon entering the mysterious island, unable to fly with a sword.

If even the Golden Core Spirit Emperor could only land, a mere plane stood no chance of taking off.

Scholar Song sighed inwardly and could only do his best to glide the plane toward the grassy area, at least avoiding a crash landing in the jungle, where the towering trees would surely pierce the plane.

……

Just as Scholar Song was doing his utmost to glide the plane, two beams of light suddenly flashed in the void.

They looked like two sword lights!

The two beams zipped past the plane and then abruptly halted in mid-air.

Then, the two beams of sword light turned around and shot toward Scholar Song!

“If I’m not mistaken, those are Elder White’s ‘one-time flying swords version 004,’ right?” Scholar Song stared at the two beams of light.

At the same time, an overwhelming sense of dread washed over him.

Oh shit, those two flying swords can’t be aiming for me, can they?!

Just as Scholar Song had this fleeting thought, the two one-time flying swords version 004 slammed into the plane, slicing through the nose like tofu…

Elder White, can you sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star?

Sorry, Scholar, I only know how to cut planes…
