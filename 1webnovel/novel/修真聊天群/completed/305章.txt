**I Hope for World Peace... Just Kidding!**

As he watched Miss Nine Lanterns swaying back to the temple, Scholar Song hurriedly jogged to catch up. 

At this point, he had no idea what Miss Nine Lanterns would do next. For all he knew, she could suddenly whisk him away to the most sacred part of Celestial Island, erase his memories, and send him off...

Regardless, he had completely given up on trying to guess what this Nine Lanterns girl might do next.

Once back at the temple, Nine Lanterns settled into her usual spot and quietly undid the array that had bound the Enlightenment Stone and Mistress Scallion. Then, feeling bored, she extended her finger to poke at Mistress Scallion.

Mistress Scallion: "..."

Seeing that Miss Nine Lanterns had fallen silent again, Scholar Song thought for a moment and retreated to the corner, crouching down to continue reading his book.

After poking at Mistress Scallion for a while, Nine Lanterns finally calmed her mood—just thinking about that embarrassing rabbit dance made her want to crawl into a hole.

Once her spirits were restored, she pulled out that little notebook again and dashed a line through the first few items.

1: Cook a meal and watch him eat it bite by bite. (Line crossed)

2: Accompany him on a medium-sized adventure. (Line crossed)

3: Save him once. (Line crossed)

4: Read many books together. (Line crossed)

5: Dance for him in a sea of flowers amidst green mountains and clear waters. (New line crossed)

6: ...

Just like last time, after crossing out the fifth item, the sixth item's content was revealed as the spell's concealment effect lifted.

6: Fulfill one of his medium-sized wishes.

Ah, this is what young girls feel, isn’t it?

Cooking for her perfect ‘him,’ accompanying him on trips (adventures), saving his life to boost affection, reading together, dancing for him—these all fit the mold of youthful sentiment.

But what does it mean to fulfill one of his wishes?

“I’m not a wishing machine... Why did I write this down back then?” Miss Nine Lanterns racked her brain but couldn’t remember why she had included that wish.

“Did I really write this myself?” She rubbed her temples.

Just the sixth item was already a frightening matter like being a ‘wishing machine.’ What other terrifying things had her younger self written down?

Fortunately, after the sixth wish, “Things Nine Lanterns Want to Do” only had one final wish left, and soon she could accomplish all seven of her youthful aspirations.

Closing the little notebook, Miss Nine Lanterns forced a smile and looked at Scholar Song.

At that moment, Scholar Song had just finished a thin volume of scripture and, sensing her gaze, looked up to meet her eyes.

“This is for you.” Miss Nine Lanterns gently pushed a box toward Scholar Song.

He caught the box and opened it to find the shed skin of a one-inch finger snake inside.

With this snake skin, once he left Celestial Island, he just needed to ask some senior craftsmen for help to create a ‘shrinking pouch.’

“Thank you,” Scholar Song said with a smile, carefully stowing the box away.

This little box was also a treasure—the snake skin would shrink upon contact, but it was a gift from Miss Nine Lanterns.

“By the way, Scholar, do you have any wishes?” Miss Nine Lanterns rested her chin on her hand and blinked her eyes.

“Wishes?” Scholar Song put down the scriptures and pondered. After a moment, he replied with a question of his own, “What kind of wishes? Material ones? Situational ones? Or something else?”

“Anything is fine; feel free to share whatever comes to mind.” Miss Nine Lanterns smiled warmly.

“For example, I wish for world peace?” Scholar Song answered—he didn’t even know why those words slipped out of his mouth.

Miss Nine Lanterns’ forehead twitched slightly, a visible vein popping up since she was a beautiful bald girl. Scholar Song caught a glimpse of her ‘vein of anger.’

“Wait, Miss Nine Lanterns, I was just joking! The atmosphere was so good that I couldn’t help but make a joke!” Scholar Song hurriedly tried to remedy the situation.

Lately, he often found himself blurt out reckless remarks without thinking. It must be due to the deep influence of the Wild Blade of Three Tides, he mused.

When he returned, he’d definitely need to remember to mute that senior for a while; this reckless tendency was contagious, and its infection rate was alarming!

Miss Nine Lanterns’ ‘vein of anger’ finally eased a bit.

“Ahem, actually, I have quite a few wishes. For example, I want to become stronger as soon as possible so I can stand on my own,” Scholar Song replied thoughtfully.

Once he had the strength to stand on his own, he could ensure his family enjoyed a good life without worrying that his identity as a cultivator would put them in danger from hostile cultivators. Only by becoming stronger could he better help his friends. For instance, he felt utterly useless regarding Fay Yu’s trip to her friend’s cultivation family because of his low power.

“The path of cultivation requires steady progress—physical strength, cultivation realm, and spiritual refinement all need to be improved gradually. You must not rush; otherwise, it may leave hidden dangers,” Miss Nine Lanterns explained seriously, her hands clasped.

Scholar Song’s wish was a common one among cultivators, but it was also the hardest to achieve quickly.

“I know that, but that’s precisely why it’s a wish,” Scholar Song replied with a smile.

Miss Nine Lanterns silently nodded.

“And then, on the material side, I’ve been wanting something lately.” Scholar Song stroked his chin.

Miss Nine Lanterns’ eyes lit up: “Do tell!”

“It’s a treasure called ‘Dragon Bone Creep Vine.’ I have a friend who got injured, and if I had the Dragon Bone Creep Vine, it could speed up her recovery.” Scholar Song thought of Sable Sixteen.

Ever since that day when she came over to play for a day and was taken back by Senior Su Clan Aqi, he hadn’t heard anything from her.

When the seniors in their group asked about Sable Sixteen’s condition, Senior Su Clan Aqi only mentioned that she needed the ‘Dragon Bone Creep Vine’ to hasten her recovery, without going into details about her injuries.

“Dragon Bone Creep Vine? That’s quite rare; mainly, in recent centuries, not many have encountered dragons, those mythical beasts,” Miss Nine Lanterns pondered.

The Dragon Bone Creep Vine grows on the bones of dragon corpses—not dinosaur bones, but true dragons.

However, dragons have their burial grounds, and there are very few dragons that die outside. Moreover, dragon corpses do not decay for a thousand years, making it difficult for them to turn into dragon bones, and even harder for the creep vine to grow on those bones.

“It doesn’t have to be from a dragon; even if it’s from a flood dragon, that’ll do.” Scholar Song chuckled.

Miss Nine Lanterns began tapping her fingers on the table.

After a moment, she looked at Scholar Song with a bright smile: “If it’s just the Dragon Bone Creep Vine from a flood dragon, I know of a place on Celestial Island where it exists.”

Scholar Song blinked in surprise, and then he sat up straight, eyes gleaming with anticipation as he looked at Miss Nine Lanterns.

“However, obtaining that Dragon Bone Creep Vine from the flood dragon won’t be easy,” she continued, her fingers still lightly tapping the table.

“Please guide me, Miss Nine Lanterns,” Scholar Song said earnestly. He sensed from Miss Nine Lanterns’ expressions and words that she was about to offer him a benefit—though it seemed there might be a price.

If the benefit was the ‘Dragon Bone Creep Vine,’ he truly couldn’t refuse.

Suddenly, Miss Nine Lanterns perked up: “I like how you used the word ‘guide’!”

Scholar Song: “…”

“Ahem, you take a break, I’ll prepare and then take you to meet a guardian spirit beast senior on the island. I remember it has a very old flood dragon corpse with Dragon Bone Creep Vine growing on it. The Dragon Bone Creep Vine is of no use to that spirit beast senior, but if you want to obtain it from him, it won’t be an easy task. You need to be mentally prepared for failure,” Miss Nine Lanterns said, standing up and brushing off her monk robes with a smile.

Scholar Song took a deep breath and replied, “As long as there’s hope, I’ll give it a try.”

“Alright, adjust your state of mind. That spirit beast senior might test your strength. I’ll go change my clothes; please wait a moment.” Miss Nine Lanterns said, waving her hand gently to return the Enlightenment Stone and Mistress Scallion to Scholar Song’s hands.

Then, she walked toward the back of the temple to change.

What kind of senior spirit beast would require Miss Nine Lanterns to change her clothes so formally?

When it came to guardian spirit beasts, the first ones that came to Scholar Song’s mind were the four sacred beasts: the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise.

Just the thought of possibly meeting such legendary living spirit beasts excited him a little.

Additionally, when Miss Nine Lanterns mentioned changing clothes, could it be that she was going to switch back to her female attire?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

When Miss Nine Lanterns reappeared, she was clad in a brand new... monk robe. Oh, the color had changed from gray to a light blue-green.

“Let’s go.” Miss Nine Lanterns smiled slightly, gripping a golden staff and leading the way out of the temple.

Scholar Song tucked away the Enlightenment Stone and Mistress Scallion and followed closely behind Miss Nine Lanterns.

Without a mount or carriage, they walked on foot.

After nearly half an hour of walking, Scholar Song spotted a massive valley.

Ling Mountain's Splendid Valley, where he could faintly hear celestial melodies drifting from within; it seemed like the sounds of strings intertwined with the joyous songs of a hundred birds.

What a paradise on earth!

The spirit beasts residing in this paradise seemed to love music. He wondered if they would test him on musical skills during the encounter.

“Watch my steps and follow my footprints closely; don’t step wrongly,” Miss Nine Lanterns’ voice called from ahead.

Scholar Song nodded slightly and followed her closely as they approached the valley, soon catching sight of a giant phoenix tree at the valley's entrance...
