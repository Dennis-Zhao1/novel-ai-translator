**Marry! Marry! I Marry! (Seeking Monthly Votes)**

"This time, I must be dead for sure!" The masked figure panted slightly. Even though he was a Second-Rank True Master, the continuous high-intensity bursts of energy were starting to take their toll.

But just as the third Scholar Song fell, a flash of light erupted from the bed, and another new Scholar Song appeared!

This one appeared faster than the previous two!

Is the monster respawn rate in this game set to +1?

The new Scholar Song wore a bitter smile as he said, "Hello, Immortal Sage of White, I'm right here beside you!"

The masked man's hand froze.

He realized something was seriously wrong with this world, but he couldn't figure out what was causing it.

This wasn't an illusion; the man he had killed over and over again was real. The sensation of his fingers piercing flesh and the smell of blood were definitely not fake!

Yet this man kept getting killed, only to reappear again. What on earth was going on?

As he pondered, the fourth Scholar Song that appeared spoke up: "Hello, Immortal Sage of White."

The masked man frowned and responded, "Hello."

But the fourth Scholar Song didn't immediately reply.

Sure enough, about thirty seconds later, he suddenly looked terrified and shouted, "Brake! Quick, brake! ...Wait, Immortal, there’s a cliff ahead!"

The masked man sighed, suppressing his urge to kill. He decided to try to play along, hoping it might lead to some new development: "Alright, alright, I'll brake!"

The fourth Scholar Song was stunned once more.

After about twenty seconds of silence, he suddenly said with a goofy expression, "For instance—Little White, when your hair reaches your waist, will you marry me?"

The masked man: "..."

Marry your grandpa!

With a flurry of punches, palms, fingers, and claws, he unleashed a barrage of attacks.

Ah, beat, beat, beat!

"Ahhhh~~" came the wailing.

Fourth Scholar Song fell!

...

...

"This time, it has to be over, right?" the masked man murmured.

As he was lost in thought, another flash of light erupted, and the respawn rate seemed to have increased even further!

The fifth Scholar Song appeared before him, surrounded by four bloody corpses.

He opened his mouth, and just as expected, he said, "Hello, Immortal Sage of White."

"Kill, kill, kill, kill!" the masked man roared.

I don't care how many of you there are; since these aren't illusions, I'll kill one each time you appear!

I refuse to believe this! Can you really keep spawning thousands of them?

...

...

Time passed, second by second.

The ground was littered with over sixty corpses of Scholar Song.

"Huff, huff, huff, this is getting strange. Is it still not finished?" The masked man smiled bitterly—he knew he had fallen into a dreadful trap.

As he killed the tenth Scholar Song, he thought about leaving this bizarre place—he couldn't provoke them; could he not avoid it?

But it turned out he couldn't escape!

The bed was only a few steps from the window, yet no matter how hard he tried—running, jumping, sprinting—he felt like he had gone far away... but when he looked back, it was still the same bed, still that gentle-faced man, and still a ground littered with corpses.

And he was always a dozen steps away from the window, a hopeless distance apart!

So he steeled himself and returned to kill Scholar Song again.

He thought, I won't believe it; can this trap really spawn thousands of them to kill?

If it could spawn thousands, how twisted would the person who set this trap be? Watching their 'doppelgangers' get tortured in every possible way? That’s pure psychopathy!

Never mind, just keep killing!

But he was growing weaker, and his attacks were getting slower.

In front of him, he didn't know how many Scholar Songs had fallen, but as he collapsed, he stubbornly said, "Marry me... will you?"

The masked man: "..."

He was on the verge of breaking down; he really was.

...

...

Time flowed like water, never to return.

He no longer knew how many +1 Scholar Songs had appeared: "Marry me... will you?"

"Marry, marry, I’ll marry, isn’t that enough?" The masked man cried, "Please, let me go! Let me out, and I’ll do anything for you!"

But as the next Scholar Song appeared, he was too injured, his head drooped, and he fell.

Then another +2 Scholar Song appeared.

Still the same line.

This time, the masked man didn't strike again; he just blankly waited for the recording-like dialogue to finish.

Finally, the N+2 Scholar Song asked, "Will you marry me?"

"Marry, marry! I’ll marry! I’ll marry!" the masked man shouted eagerly, full of excitement.

But after N+2 Scholar Song finished speaking, he froze, standing there motionless.

"I’ll kill you!" the masked man roared in anger, using his last ounce of strength to take down N+2 Scholar Song.

But it was useless!

One Scholar Song fell, and thousands more stood up!

N+3 Scholar Song appeared in a flash.

Then, the same phrase began again.

And still, the last question: "Will you marry me?"

The masked man stared blankly, lacking the will even to move a finger.

After a moment, he finally regained his composure.

"Calm down, calm down. Since this is a trap, there must be a way to break it. I can't let them dictate my rhythm. Let’s rest for a bit and recover my true energy. As long as it’s a trap, the person who set it will eventually reveal themselves. That’ll be my best chance to strike!"

The masked man finally calmed down. He pulled out a precious recovery pill and swallowed it in one gulp.

Then he sat down to recover his strength and energy.

Waiting… waiting for that moment when the trap shows a flaw; I’ll make you regret it!

I’ll torment you in the cruelest ways!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In this transparent space, he didn’t know how much time had passed.

Scholar Song climbed over to ‘Scholar Song #2’, pulled out his phone, and took a selfie with himself.

Click!

The phone’s flash lit up!

But just then, the ‘transparent world’ suddenly vanished!

So abruptly, Scholar Song was caught completely off guard.

In the next moment, he found himself back in the real world.

He discovered he was sitting beside the Venerable White.

Venerable White had already sat up, wearing a smile.

Before them—there was the masked man, sitting cross-legged, recovering his true energy.

The masked man also sensed the change in the external world and suddenly opened his eyes.

Still the same room! Still that bed! Still the same gentle yet utterly detestable man!

Only now, the ground was devoid of corpses...

Instead, there was a man, ethereal and otherworldly, like an immortal from a scroll!

But that was fine; the opportunity had arrived!

"Hahaha! That damned trap has finally disappeared; your life is mine!" The masked man gritted his teeth, soaring into the air, his right claw aimed at Scholar Song, intending to create five beautiful little holes in his head.

Scholar Song remained calm, smiling—his big backup was awake, so what was there to fear?

Beside him, Venerable White's expression was calm as he extended a hand toward the masked man, uttering four words: "Earth Spell—Turn to Sand!"

It appeared that Venerable White's main attribute was related to earth. Whether it was the stone shell that appeared when he was in seclusion, the earth spells, or the skills he was using now.

A rune made of earth appeared out of nowhere and imprinted itself onto the masked man.

Zhi... The masked man felt a wave of weakness wash over him, not just physically, but even his soul was rapidly diminishing. He looked down and saw a terrifying sight.

His body was turning into a handful of golden sand, spilling down like an hourglass...

"No, what’s happening? An illusion? An illusion?" He was filled with dread.

In the blink of an eye, the masked man’s body, along with everything on him—including his soul—turned into a mound of shimmering golden sand.

This was the first time Scholar Song truly witnessed Venerable White's ability to kill, and he was deeply shocked—Venerable White's spell lacked any hint of smoke or fire, yet it was incredibly powerful. A cultivator who could wield true energy had been reduced to a small handful of yellow sand.

Then, with a gentle sweep of Venerable White's right hand, a breeze appeared out of nowhere, lifting the mound of sand and sending it out the window, merging it with the earth below.

Outside, the night was still deep—meaning Venerable White had not yet completed his seclusion.

"Venerable White, you woke up early?" Scholar Song asked, relieved.

"I sensed a very distinct murderous intent right beside me. So I ended my seclusion and woke up... But it’s alright, this was just a short retreat, and I’ve mostly completed what I wanted to comprehend," Venerable White smiled gently, "Now, I just need to experience a few more interesting things before I can continue my seclusion. The next time, it should be for about three hundred years."

Three hundred years in the next seclusion? Scholar Song couldn’t help but gasp internally.

"Scholar Song, don’t be complacent in your training. A First-Rank cultivator can only live to the limit of a normal person's lifespan, a little over a hundred and twenty years. A Second-Rank cultivator's lifespan can increase roughly twice that, reaching about two hundred and twenty to two hundred and forty years. Only by reaching Third-Rank can one live to three hundred or four hundred years," Venerable White said slowly.

Scholar Song nodded inwardly.

"Though there’s still a long time until my next seclusion... I hope that when I come out next time, I can still see you," Venerable White smiled.

That meant Scholar Song needed to at least reach the Third Rank to live long enough to see Venerable White's next emergence.

Was this a blessing from Venerable White? Scholar Song thought to himself.

"I will do my best, Venerable White." He said confidently, "By the way, I have a rare stone here; let me show you!"

Then, he pulled out the rare stone from his pocket.

The leaves of Mistress Scallion shrank back slightly, as if afraid of Venerable White.

"This is... the Enlightenment Stone?" Venerable White took the stone, "No wonder, I can see that you’ve successfully broken through your nasal orifices, and even your ear orifices are filled with vitality. Did you have some fortuitous encounter these past few days?"

"Yes, I had a bit of a fortunate encounter," Scholar Song chuckled.

At the same time, he recalled something: Could it be that the masked man had stumbled upon the Enlightenment Stone on me, which is why he tried to come and snatch it?

He hadn’t witnessed the scene of the masked man crazily slaughtering his 'duplicates' in that 'real illusion.' The masked man’s target was definitely not as simple as the Enlightenment Stone.
