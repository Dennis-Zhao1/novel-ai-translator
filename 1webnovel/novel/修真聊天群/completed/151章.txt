**The Unnamed Immortal Statue Has Been Stolen!**

After leaving the Unnamed Temple, Scholar Song's heart gradually slowed its frantic pace.

Outside the temple, the flow of visitors offering incense did not wane. Just a few days ago, most of the worshippers were older women and grandmothers. Now, however, a significant number of young men and women had joined the ranks.

As Scholar Song walked out of the temple, four young men and women entered together.

One of the girls, lowering her voice, asked her companion, "Lin Yue, do you think the Unnamed Immortal is really that powerful?"

The girl beside her, with a bit of baby fat, replied softly, "I'm curious too! You know that rich kid, Yu? His family has some spare cash, and he's changed girlfriends like changing clothes. But just the other day, he came to the Unnamed Temple out of curiosity to see the statue of the Unnamed Immortal. Ever since, he’s become a different person. He doesn't even care about his girlfriend anymore and just wants to come here every day."

The boy next to them nodded in agreement. "I came because I was curious about Yu, too. I mean, what kind of statue could make someone so infatuated?"

These three students were simply drawn by curiosity. They were not alone; many others had come to the temple for the same reason. It’s no wonder that the offerings at the Unnamed Temple had surged recently.

Next to the trio was a young man in his late twenties.

Unlike the students, he had traveled a great distance after hearing that the Unnamed Immortal was very effective. 

Upon entering the temple, he lit incense and candles, whispering a prayer: "Immortal, please bless my sister with healing from her strange ailment so she no longer suffers from this debilitating condition. If you grant my wish, I swear I will build a grand temple in your honor!"

After finishing his prayer, the young man lifted his head and gazed at the statue of the Immortal.

Just that brief look made his heart race and breaths come heavy—this statue of the Immortal was exquisitely perfect, almost mesmerizing! 

He felt that even if he had to give everything he owned for it, he would have no regrets!

This thought lingered in his mind, becoming an obsession.

With his eyes glazed over, he eventually lost track of how he left the temple, almost in a daze as he returned to his car.

When the driver called his name multiple times, he finally snapped back to reality.

"Young Master Gu, are we heading back?" the driver asked, frowning—he sensed that his young master had been bewitched.

"Yeah, let's go back. Right, we’ll talk about it later," Young Master Gu nodded.

The statue of the Unnamed Immortal... this needed more thought!

Back at the internet café, Scholar Song knocked on the door of his booth.

His friend, Jing Ba Dou Dou, quickly opened the door, then dashed back to his computer.

"Dou Dou, stop playing games and check on me first!" Scholar Song called out.

Without turning his head, Dou Dou replied, "What is it?"

"Look at me! Give me a full body check-up!" Scholar Song insisted.

"Why would I check you? You're not a girl! Did you run into some ghost or something?" Dou Dou shot him a sideways glance.

"No, no! I just went to the Unnamed Temple and saw the statue of the Unnamed Immortal. Some strange things happened after!" Scholar Song quickly explained the bizarre heartbeat he experienced when he saw the statue and the details of the situation: "So, please check if there's anything weird about that statue, or if I've fallen under some charm spell!"

Dou Dou paused, then his eyes gleamed with golden light as he looked Scholar Song over from head to toe, finally saying, "No problem, you're as fit as a horse. No spells lingering on you."

With that, Dou Dou returned to his game.

Scholar Song felt a little relieved.

Could it be that the statue of the Unnamed Immortal was truly a masterpiece, exceeding the pinnacle of sculptural art, so that just one look could ensnare a person's soul?

But still, something felt off.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

As the evening wore on, Scholar Song obediently stayed in his booth.

He opened the Ninefold Land chat group, hoping to catch up on the latest gossip, but today the group was eerily quiet.

The Hermit of North River, Wild Blade of Three Tides, and the True Monarch of Ancient Lake must have entered a mysterious island and couldn’t access the internet. But where were the other seniors?

With nothing else to do, Scholar Song resorted to resting, cultivating, taking some medicinal pills, and cultivating again...

The waiting felt incredibly long.

Finally, he made it to around eight in the evening.

The Venerable White was about to emerge from his closed-door cultivation!

"The time is almost up," Scholar Song said, taking out his small flute, ready to contact the Venerable White.

Just then, his green flute vibrated, and a soft voice came from it: "Hello! Is this Scholar Song?"

It was a message from the Venerable White, who had used the ‘Thousand-Mile Sound Transmission’ artifact to let him know he was ready to be picked up.

Scholar Song replied, "Hello, senior Venerable White. Have you finished your cultivation?"

"Yes, I’m done... you can come and get me now," Venerable White responded.

Scholar Song asked, "Where is your location in Lin Yao Village? I’ll come find you."

"Let me see... I seem to be in a small room. Haha, it seems like there’s some odd disturbance around me. Here’s what you can do... just follow the connection of the ‘Thousand-Mile Sound Transmission’ to find me. As long as you hold the flute and channel your mental energy, you’ll feel a special sound wave linking the artifact to me. Follow that sound wave, and you’ll find me," Venerable White instructed.

Scholar Song focused and, sure enough, sensed a special sound wave attached to the flute. The other end connected deep within Lin Yao Village.

"I felt it, Senior Venerable White. I’ll be there soon," Scholar Song replied.

Then he turned to Dou Dou and asked, "Dou Dou, want to come along to pick up Venerable White?"

"Forget it, just bring him back. Oh, and when you go out, could you recharge my internet fees? The manager just warned me that I’ve already exceeded ten hours and owe for more than an hour," Dou Dou replied without looking back.

"Just stay put and don’t wander around. I’ll be right back with Venerable White," Scholar Song said, heading to the front desk of the café to add another hundred to the account.

Then, following the special sound wave through the ‘Thousand-Mile Sound Transmission,’ he set off.

…

…

The closer he got to Venerable White, the more familiar the terrain became.

Eventually... he arrived at the Unnamed Temple.

"Here?" Scholar Song looked puzzled at the Unnamed Temple.

At that moment, there were still plenty of worshippers outside, and the temple was brightly lit.

Holding the ‘Thousand-Mile Sound Transmission’ flute, he asked, "Senior Venerable White, is your closed-door location at the Unnamed Temple?"

"The Unnamed Temple? Now that you mention it, I seem to be in a temple," Venerable White's voice replied. "Scholar Song, I can feel your position now. You can enter the temple, and you’ll see a statue being worshipped—that’s me!"

That’s me... that’s me...

Scholar Song was stunned—was the statue of the Unnamed Immortal in the temple really Venerable White?

This revelation was beyond his expectations.

Before this, he never would have connected ‘Venerable White’ with the Unnamed Immortal statue!

One was a senior who had been in seclusion for a long time, while the other was a statue worshipped in a temple.

One was an imagined luxurious place of cultivation, while the other was an ancient, nameless temple.

Even more confusing was that Venerable White had supposedly gone into seclusion over a hundred and fifty years ago, while the information he found online stated that the statue of the Unnamed Immortal had been established hundreds of years ago. Clearly, the tales passed down through generations often contained numerous errors and exaggerations—over a hundred years of discrepancy!

So, no matter how wild his imagination was, he couldn't connect these two entirely different concepts.

…

…

No grand location for seclusion, no layers of defensive formations—just an old temple!

Scholar Song couldn’t resist asking, "Senior Venerable White, weren’t you in seclusion? Why did you turn into a statue and get worshipped in a temple?"

"Haha, it’s a long story. I’ll explain everything once I’m out," Venerable White sighed. "Scholar Song, do you have a way to divert the worshippers below so I can come out of the statue? It’ll be quite a spectacle when I break through the outer stone shell. If people see it, it might cause unnecessary trouble."

If Venerable White were to ‘boom’ and burst out of the statue in front of the worshippers... it would certainly make headlines and attract a lot of unwanted attention!

Scholar Song glanced at the number of worshippers outside the temple; there were still quite a few.

With so many people, he had no idea how to clear them out in one go!

"How about waiting, Senior Venerable White? If we wait a little longer, the worshippers will likely disperse," Scholar Song suggested after some thought.

"That’s fine, as long as you’re not in a hurry." Venerable White didn’t mind; after being secluded for over a hundred and fifty years, waiting a few more hours was nothing to him!

…

…

In life, things rarely went as planned.

Time passed slowly, and by around ten o'clock that evening, the number of worshippers outside the Unnamed Temple had not decreased; in fact, it was growing!

At this rate, even if they waited until dawn, many worshippers would still linger.

Some might even stay until the morning!

If that happened, how would Venerable White ever get out of the statue?

"Senior, I’ll go find some help to temporarily disperse the crowd. Then you can make your move," Scholar Song thought of Dou Dou; perhaps it could help clear the crowd?

"Sounds good," Venerable White agreed.

Scholar Song quickly dashed back to the internet café.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Not long after Scholar Song left, four small trucks rolled up to the Unnamed Temple.

From the trucks, about sixty burly men jumped out and gathered together.

Then, the young Master Gu, who had been about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old, stepped out of one of the trucks.

He gazed at the Unnamed Temple from a distance, took a deep breath, and commanded, "Go, dig up the Unnamed Immortal statue and bring it back! Be careful not to look directly at the statue!"

"Understood!" The sixty men shouted in unison, rushing toward the Unnamed Temple, pushing aside the worshippers in their way. Among them, ten strong men with tools approached the statue, preparing to uproot it and take it away.
