**Chapter XX: The Gorilla Showdown**

The body of the mighty gorilla was like a fortress, and even though Scholar Song knew it was just a big brute, the force behind its charge was nothing to scoff at.

Choosing not to withstand the impact head-on, Scholar Song swiftly shifted his body, channeling the steps of "Gentleman's Journey" as he elegantly danced away, effortlessly maneuvering to the gorilla's rear.

With a decisive strike, he unleashed a powerful palm strike against the gorilla’s back, igniting the blood energy from his heart and eyes. This wasn’t just a mere slap; it was a forceful explosion of power!

**Boom!**

The gorilla, caught off guard, took the full brunt of the blow. Scholar Song’s palm penetrated through the thick fur, tearing through muscle and sending shockwaves through its internal organs.

“Ow!” The gorilla howled in pain, saliva flying from its mouth. The impact sent it crashing into a boiling pot, toppling it over and falling into the flames.

Flames licked at the gorilla’s fur, igniting it instantly. It screamed in agony but quickly rolled on the ground, adeptly extinguishing the fire with swift movements. Clearly, these creatures had experience with fire—probably a result of their frequent encounters with it.

Scholar Song’s lips twitched—was this really just an ordinary gorilla and not some kind of smart beast?

After rolling around to extinguish the flames, the robust gorilla lay on the ground, motionless. This time, it was genuinely injured; it wouldn’t be getting up anytime soon.

Scholar Song turned his gaze back to the group of gorillas.

“Ugh, ugh!” The remaining gorillas roared at him in anger.

Suddenly, from the crowd, another towering gorilla charged forth, heading straight for Scholar Song.

Oh? These gorillas had a knightly spirit, opting for one-on-one combat instead of ganging up!

…

…

As the towering gorilla approached, it picked up a hefty rock mid-charge and hurled it at Scholar Song. Ah, so the tactic of throwing rocks before fighting wasn’t unique to the first robust gorilla but rather a racial instinct of these creatures!

“Throwing rocks won’t work on me!” Scholar Song exclaimed, effortlessly swatting the rock aside with his palm.

However, something unexpected occurred.

As the towering gorilla drew near, its little legs suddenly executed a few peculiar steps—steps that mirrored the very movements Scholar Song had just used with "Gentleman's Journey"!

Then, in a flash, the towering gorilla shifted behind Scholar Song and delivered a powerful palm strike aimed at his back!

This whole sequence mirrored the actions of the robust gorilla Scholar Song had just sent flying.

What incredible mimicking ability!

Though the steps of "Gentleman's Journey" still seemed superficial, the learning capacity of these gorillas was astonishing!

Should I consider capturing one to show to Venerable White? Scholar Song thought to himself.

As the towering gorilla's palm struck from behind, Scholar Song swiftly lifted his leg and executed a powerful kick, striking the gorilla with a resounding impact.

The gorilla’s physique was clearly inferior to that of the previous robust one. Scholar Song’s kick sent it crashing to the ground, where it promptly lost consciousness, unable to rise again.

Scholar Song surveyed the remaining 19 gorillas—if this were a series of one-on-one battles, taking them down wouldn’t be too hard!

But would they continue to challenge him one by one?

The answer was… no.

With the two strongest gorillas defeated, the remaining 19 gorillas roared in unison and charged at Scholar Song.

What’s more, as they closed in, they all bent down in unison to pick up rocks, ready to hurl them at Scholar Song.

This really was a racial instinct!

With so many rocks flying at once, the quantity transformed into a qualitative threat, increasing their lethality exponentially!

Scholar Song looked at the barrage of rocks coming his way, feeling a twinge of pain in his side.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile, not far away on the grassland…

The wreckage of the plane lay scattered across the ground, its nose seemingly vanished without a trace.

The passengers inside were somewhat fortunate; they hadn’t faced the full force of the flying swords like Scholar Song and his companions.

When the accident occurred, the plane had already been descending slowly under the influence of a "Flight Restriction Array." This array didn’t just pull objects from the sky directly to the ground; it nullified their flight power and gently lowered them with another force.

After the plane landed on the grassland, although many passengers were injured, they were all alive.

However, now… the twenty or so survivors faced an even greater crisis.

Over fifty black gorillas rushed in at the moment of the plane’s landing. Before the passengers could react, the gorillas formed a circle, surrounding them.

Once encircled, the gorillas began pulling out ropes, seemingly intending to bind each passenger one by one.

Screams from women and cries from children echoed through the crowd…

“Oh God, what’s happening?” a burly black man shouted in English, his voice booming above the chaos, drowning out the screams and cries.

In his mind, gorilla troops typically numbered around thirty at most—how had so many gathered here? And gorillas using ropes to bind people? What kind of gorillas were these?

The loud exclamation from the burly man caught the attention of the gorilla troop.

One particularly muscular gorilla stepped forward, standing directly in front of him, and let out a loud roar.

It seemed… that the loud voice of the burly man had been taken as a provocation by the gorillas?

The muscular gorilla pounded its chest like a battering ram and charged toward the man.

The burly man’s legs turned to jelly.

The gorilla reached him in an instant and knocked him out cold with a single punch.

“Humph!” The muscular gorilla displayed a clear expression of disdain on its face. Then, it pulled out a rope, expertly binding the burly man.

It was a rather tragic scene.

Yet, there was something inexplicably humorous about seeing a gorilla skillfully tying up a burly man, as if a needle had poked at the audience's funny bone.

After binding the burly man, the gorilla let out a triumphant roar and began thumping its chest in classic gorilla fashion.

The remaining passengers were terrified.

Some frantically pulled out their phones, futilely attempting to call for help; others screamed loudly, tears streaming down their faces; some curled up in a ball, trembling in fear…

Among the remaining passengers on the plane, twelve were frail women.

From the nine men left, five were slightly overweight humanities majors.

The remaining four included one already bound burly man, a cute little boy, an elderly professor with white hair, and Scholar Song's nominal disciple, Joseph.

Aside from Joseph and the already bound burly man, who looked somewhat capable of fighting, the rest were utterly useless.

The young and healthy men who had been on the plane had vanished into particles of light amidst the flames.

It was a scene that felt utterly despairing!

…

…

In the crowd, Lu Fei whispered to her sister, “What do we do?”

Lu’s sister frowned, sighing quietly, “We’re in trouble; we’re surrounded. In our current state, there’s no way we can escape from the gorillas.”

Next to them, Joseph clenched his teeth, silently protecting the two girls. His daughter had vanished during the flight; he couldn’t let anything happen to these two girls!

He gazed at the fifty or so intimidating gorillas surrounding them, realizing they had fallen into a desperate situation. If he didn’t fight back now, it would only lead to death.

But if he did fight back, it was twenty fragile individuals against fifty powerful gorillas—there was no way to win.

Perhaps now was the time to use the unparalleled martial arts taught by my master! Joseph tightened his fists.

He had absolute faith in his master, Scholar Song—he believed in the martial arts that could shatter the air with a flick of a palm.

Even though he had only trained for a month, Joseph felt significantly stronger.

“Ugh, ugh!” The muscular gorilla roared again, pounding its chest as it advanced toward the crowd.

Behind it, the other gorillas also roared, stepping forward with ropes in hand, closing in on the passengers.

Their movements were synchronized… they looked almost like a group of humans acting together.

The muscular gorilla wore a satisfied expression on its face.

Then, it pulled out another rope, reaching for a nearby flight attendant.

At that moment, Joseph finally stepped forward, shouting in anger, “Stop!”

The muscular gorilla turned its head in confusion, looking at Joseph.

Joseph’s eyes gleamed with determination, and his expression turned serious.

Then, he began to demonstrate the first move of "The Era Calls," the preparatory move.

First, he stood tall and straight, then raised his left arm to the side, gazing at his left hand.

Next, he stepped forward into a bow stance with his right foot while his left arm swung inward to lower in front of him, watching his right hand.

Then, he returned his right leg to a standing position, raising both arms to the side (palms facing outward) while lifting his head slightly.

Joseph provocatively glared at the muscular gorilla.

The muscular gorilla hesitated for a moment.

Then, a look of contemplation crossed its face. Shortly after, disdain appeared on its face—its expression was so vivid, it resembled that of a human.

Next, the muscular gorilla stood up straight!

It raised its left arm to the side, looking at its left hand!

It stepped forward with its right foot, swinging its left arm inward to lower in front of it, gazing at its right hand!

Finally, it returned its right leg to a standing position, raising both arms to the side (palms facing outward) while tilting its head slightly.

The movements were flawless, flowing smoothly, and it didn’t look like it was doing this for the first time! Quite a sight to behold!

After completing the first move of "The Era Calls," the muscular gorilla turned back and provocatively glared at Joseph!
