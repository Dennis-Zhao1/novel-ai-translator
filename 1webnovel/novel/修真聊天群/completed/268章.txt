**Chapter 1: The Illusionary World**

As Scholar Song was sent flying, the golden little shield shattered around him. He felt his body plummet towards the location of Venerable White.

Above Venerable White's head, a bamboo slip array slowly rotated.

This special defensive formation was a reverse defense—defending against internal threats while leaving external ones unguarded. It had been meticulously modified by Fay Yu from Spirit Butterfly Island! Because of this unique design, Scholar Song and Fay Yu had previously taken advantage of the formation's activation to experiment with various hairstyles for Venerable White.

However, at this moment, the runes on the bamboo slips were all 'flowing'—indicating that the power of the formation was fully activated. In other words, Venerable White had unleashed his ultimate technique; the bamboo slip array had been initiated.

As Scholar Song landed, he found himself… not colliding with Venerable White.

In an instant, he felt as if he had passed through an 'interface'—a sensation he was all too familiar with. He wouldn't mistake it for an actual traversal this time.

This feeling was unmistakable; it was the 'real illusion' of Venerable White, and it was time for the passionate desert to unveil itself!

Scholar Song quickly turned to look behind him… and saw the masked figure chasing him relentlessly, crashing into the 'bamboo slip array' and entering the realm of the 'real illusion.'

At that moment, he felt a wave of relief wash over him.

He had feared that this masked person would remain outside, posing a threat to his family. Now that they had entered, they could play with the 'young man in the white horse and green robe' until Venerable White's retreat came to an end!

By that time… once Venerable White emerged from his meditation, the masked figure would become a monkey in the palm of his hand, with nowhere to escape!

...

Scholar Song felt assured, waiting for the 'passionate desert' to manifest, eager to meet the young man in the white horse and green robe once more.

But as he waited and waited, the desert and the young man failed to appear.

How strange, could there be a shift in the world?

Scholar Song was certain he was within the 'real illusion'—not only because he had passed through a certain 'interface,' but also because the masked figure who had followed him had vanished as well.

Yet, the desert did not appear, and his current situation felt a bit odd.

“Or perhaps this is the 'real illusion' of this time? So, is this world a 'transparent world'?” Scholar Song muttered to himself.

The world he found himself in had no physical substance; it was like a transparent realm overlaying the real world.

In his eyes, he remained in 'his room,' with all the furnishings identical to his memories.

However, this room gave him a feeling of 'infinite vastness.' Moreover, the bed was empty, with no sign of Venerable White!

This wasn’t the 'passionate desert' but a whole new world?

Or perhaps… it was a world still taking shape in Venerable White's heart, which is why this world remained 'transparent' and had not materialized?

Scholar Song's mind raced, and he began to piece together the possibilities before him.

If it was indeed a brand-new world, who would appear in it?

In the desert, the young man in the white horse and green robe had emerged; who would show up in this unformed world?

While he pondered, a figure suddenly sat up from the bed… There had been no one there just a second ago, yet someone had appeared so abruptly.

As he recognized the figure before him, Scholar Song's expression turned peculiar.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

The masked figure had also crossed into this strange transparent world, unaware of the 'real illusion.' He looked around the room, a mix of confusion and wariness in his eyes.

Was this some kind of trap? The masked figure wondered, staying on high alert.

Just then, a figure suddenly sat up from the bed.

The masked figure's pupils dilated; just a second ago, he could have sworn the bed was empty!

But immediately after, he felt a surge of joy.

“Hahaha!” The masked figure let out a maniacal laugh, his feet moving as he lunged towards the figure on the bed.

Before the figure could utter a word, the masked figure unleashed a torrent of relentless attacks.

Fists, palms, fingers, claws!

Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!

“Ahhh!” The figure on the bed screamed, blood spraying wildly…

The masked figure ceased his barrage.

The figure on the bed stared wide-eyed, his throat punctured by sword energy, his chest caved in from a punch, his abdomen riddled with finger holes, and a gaping claw wound atop his head.

The body of the figure fell to the ground with a thud, lifeless and unblinking.

This figure had short black hair, was about eighteen or nineteen years old, and stood around five foot nine. Even with his eyes wide open, one could still vaguely discern his kind demeanor.

It was none other than—Scholar Song?!

“Hahaha, you thought you could hide your figure with that concealing technique? Too naive. From the moment you encountered me, your fate was sealed—death awaits!” The masked figure cackled, his voice raspy.

Then he stepped forward, grabbing Scholar Song's head, and with his right hand formed into a blade, he struck down.

Blood gushed forth as Scholar Song's head was severed…

“So easy,” the masked man said, a gleam of delight in his eyes, and then he turned, ready to flee through the window.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On the other side.

Scholar Song stared blankly at the figure on the bed. Yes, that figure—was his very own self!

He never imagined he would become a new character in Venerable White's 'real illusion'!

Facing an 'alternate version' of himself was certainly a strange feeling. Scholar Song looked at the other version of himself and thought, fine, let’s call him 'Scholar Song 2.0.'

After Scholar Song 2.0 sat up, he quickly began to play his part.

With a bitter smile, Scholar Song 2.0 said, “Hello, Venerable White, I’m right beside you!”

That expression… could it be reminiscent of the moment he had just met Venerable White after retrieving his statue? Back then, he had eagerly awaited for Venerable White to break free from the statue.

“Hello, Venerable White.” After a moment, Scholar Song 2.0 smiled again, speaking like a tape recorder.

Clearly, Scholar Song 2.0 lacked the liveliness and authenticity of the young man in the white horse and green robe from the 'passionate desert.'

But thinking back, it made sense; the young man in the white horse and green robe was a completed version of a real illusion.

While the Scholar Song 2.0 before him was still only a half-formed version.

After two lines of narration, Scholar Song 2.0 suddenly wore a face of terror: “Brake! Quick, hit the brakes!… Don’t, Venerable, there’s a cliff ahead!”

Was this scene from the moment Venerable White first drove off a cliff?

Scholar Song felt his heart ache as he observed Scholar Song 2.0's fearful expression.

Immediately after, Scholar Song 2.0’s demeanor shifted to a cute, naive one: “For instance—Little White, will you marry me when your hair reaches your waist?”

“Ugh!” Scholar Song spat out a mouthful of blood.

As the scene reached this point… Scholar Song 2.0 suddenly froze, as if Venerable White was still in the process of constructing this 'transparent new world.'

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On the other side.

As the masked figure carried Scholar Song's severed head away, he suddenly heard a noise coming from behind.

When he turned around, he was left dumbfounded.

From the bed, yet another Scholar Song was climbing up—while the previous Scholar Song lay lifeless on the ground, headless and bleeding.

“Damn it, how did you come back!” The masked figure glared at the Scholar Song's head in his hand and then fixated on the Scholar Song sitting on the bed. “Who the hell are you?”

After sitting up, the second Scholar Song looked at the masked figure and offered a bitter smile: “Hello, Venerable White, I’m right beside you!”

“Right beside me?” The masked figure glanced at Scholar Song's head, a chill creeping into his eyes.

“Are you playing with me? Then you can die too!” He dropped the head he was holding and leaped forward, launching a furious assault on the second Scholar Song.

Once again, the masked figure unleashed a storm of attacks.

The second Scholar Song was completely defenseless, instantly following the fate of the first Scholar Song, collapsing to the ground. He too suffered from a perforated forehead, a pierced throat, a caved-in chest, and multiple holes in his abdomen.

As the second Scholar Song fell, he opened his mouth, desperately uttering his final words: “Hello… Venerable… White…”

The masked figure snorted in disdain, but what was 'Venerable White' anyway… was he referring to some 'Sixth-Rank True Monarch'?

He glanced at the lifeless body of the second Scholar Song sprawled on the ground and raised his hand to strike off the head once more.

No matter which one was real, bringing back the head was sufficient.

Thus, the masked figure turned, carrying two 'Scholar Song heads,' and made his way toward the window.

...

...

As he turned to take a few more steps, a rustling sound echoed from behind him.

Then came the familiar voice: “Hello, Venerable White, I’m right beside you!”

The masked figure spun around, shocked to find yet another Scholar Song appearing at the bed's edge, wearing a bitter smile. Beside him lay the previous two headless corpses of Scholar Song.

“……” The masked figure could feel an overwhelming sense of unease.

“An illusion! Right! I must be caught in an illusion!” The masked figure thought, extending his finger to stab into his thigh. Blood sprayed as the sharp pain jolted his senses.

Not an illusion?

Then what was happening before his eyes? The continuous appearance of figures could perhaps be explained as imposters or twins, but what did three signify?

While he pondered, the third Scholar Song began to speak: “Hello, Venerable White.”

Masked figure: “…”

He dropped the two 'Scholar Song heads' he had been holding and stared at the third Scholar Song, contemplating before he responded, “Hello?”

Just then, the third Scholar Song suddenly wore a terrified expression: “Brake! Quick, hit the brakes!… Don’t, Venerable, there’s a cliff ahead!”

Masked figure: “…”

The conversation was completely out of sync!

What the hell was going on? Were they playing him for a fool?

Fury surged within the masked figure as he lunged at the third Scholar Song, unleashing a brutal series of attacks.

The third Scholar Song, too, fell…
