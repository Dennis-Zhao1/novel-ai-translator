**Chapter 1: A Twist of Fate**

“Something feels off about this good luck!”

The ghost general in the sky maintained a menacing stance, his sword aimed at the village below. How could all his subordinates and minions just vanish into a black hole in the blink of an eye?

The ghost general stood frozen for a moment, then, sensing danger, he rode the black clouds and fled frantically into the distance—he had encountered a powerful figure! His entire battalion had been whisked away in one go; survival was his only option!

“Hahaha!” Brother Sanri laughed heartily as he stowed away the black flag in his hand.

Meanwhile, the residents of Luoxin District felt an inexplicable chill for just a moment before warmth returned to their bodies. The villagers were baffled, clueless as to what had just transpired.

“Scholar Song, let’s go!” After putting away the black flag, Brother Sanri swiftly grabbed Song Shuhang and, with a flash of light, they took off on the flying sword, quickly chasing after the ghost general.

Brother Sanri had deliberately allowed the ghost general to escape… But if he let it go, how would they locate its lair? They needed to eliminate all the resentful spirits, ghost soldiers, and ghost generals in one sweep!

The ghost general flying ahead was also lacking in intelligence—after all, although it had awakened most of its memories from its past life and possessed a certain level of awareness, its intelligence was generally low.

This was a fundamental flaw; only by leveling up to a ghost commander would it have a chance at salvation.

Thus, the ghost general hadn’t even considered the possibility that it had been intentionally let go.

All it could think about now was to escape! It needed to return to its lair, where its two elder brothers awaited. With more ghost soldiers and resentful spirits, perhaps it could save its own life.

As it fled desperately, Brother Sanri concealed his presence, skillfully maneuvering the flying sword to leisurely follow the ghost general.

…

…

Soon, the ghost general flew to the cemetery on the back mountain of Luoxin District.

So this is where it is? Song Shuhang’s eyes lit up; this cemetery was the very place his grandfather had mentioned seeing a “ghost shadow.” Perhaps this was the lair of the ghost generals!

“Things are going smoothly.” Brother Sanri smiled softly.

Indeed, everything was just going too smoothly. But wait, this phrase felt oddly familiar?

Just as they were talking, the ghost general dove headfirst into a graveyard.

It plunged into the ground as easily as a regular person would dive into water, passing through the cemetery and directly into its depths. Ghosts could bypass the constraints of the material world, effortlessly traversing walls and earth…

“Brother Sanri, how do we get in?” Song Shuhang asked, dazed.

“Haha, why do we need to go in?” Brother Sanri’s eyes glowed with a faint azure light, a mysterious mark flickering within them.

With his talent of the Eye of Insight—much superior to Song Shuhang’s ‘Enhanced Vision’—Brother Sanri’s gaze could pierce through the cemetery and the ground alike.

“I see it! The builders of this place were quite cunning.” Brother Sanri chuckled, leading Song Shuhang as they flew forward on their sword, eventually landing before a mountain wall.

After the ghost general entered the graveyard, it followed a long passageway straight into the mountain wall. The interior of the mountain had long been secretly hollowed out, creating a separate realm.

On the wall was a hidden door… However, Brother Sanri had no time to ponder how to open it. He raised his hand and struck the dark door with a palm. A seemingly ordinary strike unleashed a torrent of true energy.

Boom! The door exploded with a loud crash!

Inside the hidden door lay a vast space teeming with ghosts.

At that moment, the returning ghost general wore a face of terror, frantically recounting its encounter with a powerful cultivator in the village to two other even stronger ghost generals.

Suddenly, the stone wall door swung open!

The fleeing ghost general turned around and was met with the sight of Brother Sanri, causing it to gasp in shock.

“It’s him! Big brother, it’s that human cultivator!” the ghost general screamed in panic.

“Don’t be afraid! Attack together!” The leading ghost general rose to its feet, bellowing—this one was already nearing the realm of a ghost commander and was quite cunning.

While directing the ghost soldiers to attack Brother Sanri and Song Shuhang, it quietly began to retreat, preparing to make its escape.

“Hahaha, where do you think you’re going?” Brother Sanri summoned the enormous black flag once more, making it swirl and transform into a black hole.

The black hole exerted a tremendous pull, sucking in all the ghosts in the vicinity, including the leading ghost general, who screamed as it was caught in the vortex.

By the time Brother Sanri stowed the black flag away, not a single resentful spirit remained in the cave.

“What a huge harvest!” Brother Sanri was filled with satisfaction, his mood elevated.

Song Shuhang glanced around; this was the headquarters of the “Claw Mark Beast” organization that the “Master of the Altar” had led. Today, however, this organization had finally been obliterated, sinking into the depths of history.

“Good and evil will eventually be repaid; it’s not that it won’t be, just that the timing hasn’t come yet.” Song Shuhang murmured—he would update the group later to inform the Seven Lives Talismans’ master that the Claw Mark Beast organization was thoroughly finished.

Finally, he’d fulfilled one of the “wishes” that the master had made in his youth.

“Eh? Shuhang, you know this place?” Brother Sanri asked, puzzled.

“Yes, I had some past grievances with an organization here, but now, it’s all over.” Song Shuhang replied, beaming.

“You came here to deal with that organization?” Brother Sanri inquired.

“Exactly, but… all the members of that organization were completely slaughtered by the ghost generals and resentful spirits. I actually had a question I wanted to ask them.” Song Shuhang sighed, adding, “This organization had destroyed villages everywhere, using living people to summon resentful spirits. Now, they have all died at the hands of the very spirits they created. It’s a fitting end.”

Brother Sanri nodded and said, “If this was once the territory of a small cultivator organization, then Shuhang, you should search around here. There might be some additional loot to be found.”

As long as it was a cultivator organization, big or small, there would always be some treasures stashed away.

Song Shuhang suddenly realized that when he had taken down the Master of the Altar, he had acquired a large black box of treasures. Now that they were at the Master’s headquarters, there would undoubtedly be more treasures!

“Let me lend you a hand.” Brother Sanri activated his Eye of Insight again, scanning the entire stone-walled space for hidden items.

…

…

With Brother Sanri’s assistance, Song Shuhang quickly began to gather items from within the stone wall.

First, there was a large leather suitcase filled with cash—approximately three million in total.

Given the organization’s nature, the Master would never have kept too much money in the bank; most transactions were done in cash. Originally, the Master had amassed hundreds of millions in cash, along with diamonds and gold… However, after his death, most of that money had been divided among his subordinates. This three million was merely what remained, left in the headquarters just in case.

Next, there was a box of black beads, which seemed to be infused with a dense ghostly aura.

“What are these?” Song Shuhang asked in confusion, certain they weren’t black pearls.

Brother Sanri took a glance and chuckled, “These should be ‘soul beads’ left behind after the death of ghosts. Aside from ghost cultivators, nobody would bother collecting these; they’re pretty much useless.”

Song Shuhang nodded; they did seem to be worthless items.

Just as he was thinking this, the Phantom Spirit in his mind conveyed a vague message: Food!

Food?

Song Shuhang suddenly recalled the scene of the Phantom Spirit devouring pieces of the ghost general—could it be that these soul beads could also serve as food for the Phantom Spirit? If so, these beads weren’t entirely useless after all.

Lastly… a pile of medicinal herbs.

As Song Shuhang looked at the herbs, he felt a sense of déjà vu.

“Hey, aren’t these the medicinal materials for refining the Blood Qi Pill?” Song Shuhang exclaimed, noticing that all the herbs from the list that Venerable White had given him were right before his eyes!

“It seems like the Alchemical Sage has taught you quite a bit~ These are indeed the materials needed for refining Blood Qi Pills,” Brother Sanri chuckled.

“Brother, I really need these herbs! Can I take the majority?” Song Shuhang said, thickening his skin as he prepared to split the spoils with Brother Sanri.

“Hahaha, no need! Just take them all!” Brother Sanri patted Song Shuhang’s shoulder vigorously, saying, “The money is of no use to me; those soul beads are useless; as for Blood Qi Pills, I can get as many as I want! But you’re in dire need of these materials, so don’t be shy. Besides… the fact that I’ve managed to collect so many resentful spirits, ghost soldiers, and ghost generals this time has already surpassed my expectations. I’m thoroughly satisfied!”

Song Shuhang thickened his skin and nodded, “Then Brother, I won’t be polite!”

He genuinely needed these resources, so he couldn’t afford to be modest.

If he were to be overly polite, Brother Sanri might insist on rejecting him, and that would leave Song Shuhang with only a portion of the herbs, with no chance to regret it later.

Thanks to Brother Sanri’s help, he packed up the herbs, and got the box of soul beads and the suitcase full of cash.

Brother Sanri said, “Let’s go. We should leave. Even though all the ghosts have been eliminated, this place still feels eerie and unsettling.”

With that, he activated his escape light, carrying Song Shuhang as they flew out of the stone wall space and back to Luoxin District.

As Song Shuhang looked at the suitcase and the bundles in his hands, he thought to himself.

Today, his luck was truly extraordinary. Not only had he successfully dealt with the scourge of the “Master of the Altar’s subordinates,” but he had also gathered the medicinal materials for the “Blood Qi Pill” that Venerable White needed!

This luck was simply divine!

However… despite his incredible fortune today, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was amiss.

Was there something he had overlooked?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At this moment, in the void, Master Jingmo gritted his teeth as he headed toward Luoxin District in J City.

Beside him was a man proudly riding a gourd; this was the helper Master Jingmo had recruited! A fourth-tier loose cultivator.

Finally, he had waited for an opportunity to catch “Scholar Shuhang” when he was separated from his fellow cultivators. This time, Master Jingmo swore he would capture “Scholar Shuhang” and obtain the Blood God Diamond!

This loose cultivator was a rare friend of Master Jingmo, who had just come out of seclusion and was bored, following Master Jingmo around for a bit of fun.

When he heard that Master Jingmo was targeting a cultivator, he became quite interested and decided to tag along.
