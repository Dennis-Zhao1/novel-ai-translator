**Contracting the Phantom Spirit**

Below the video, the number of comments and likes was staggering. The view count was skyrocketing, with nearly thirty percent of the campus network users having watched it, and the numbers were still climbing.

Scholar Song wiped the sweat from his brow—wasn’t Joseph Guy Maupassant’s daughter a student at Jiangnan University Town? What would her reaction be if she saw this video?

The first reaction would undoubtedly be to tear apart that scumbag Zhuge Yue who posted the video!

The second reaction would certainly involve ripping apart the “nameless expert” who taught her father about ‘Huaxia Kung Fu’!

Fortunately, when he taught Joseph Kung Fu, he didn't use his full name. Otherwise, wouldn’t her daughter be out for revenge?

...

In the afternoon, Scholar Song obediently went to class. He felt a bit guilty about skipping classes recently.

Tu Bo leaned over, whispering, “Song, what have you been up to these past few days? Haven’t even returned to the dorm.”

Next to him, Lu Fei was equally curious, having come to class just to cool off.

“Oh, a friend came by a while ago, and I helped him find an apartment. I’ve been going over there a lot to lend a hand,” Scholar Song replied with a smile. It was the truth, although his ‘friend’ was a bit extraordinary.

Gao, adjusting his glasses, said, “Scholar, don’t take any leave for the next couple of days. We’re summarizing the key points for the semester exams. The final exams are on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th, and we get a break on July 6th. If you don’t pass, you’ll have to stay for a make-up exam, which would be a hassle.”

Final exams? Oh no, he had almost forgotten about that!

Scholar Song rubbed his temples. Ever since he got involved with the 'Ninefold Land' cultivators, his life had turned upside down. From refining body-enhancing liquids to the various incidents with the sects, and hosting Venerable White’s return from seclusion, he had experienced more in just over a month than an ordinary person would in a lifetime. Not to mention that he had even suffered a few hits to the head.

Thinking back, it felt like everything he had recently gone through was a dream.

And, he had almost forgotten that he was still a student. The semester was about to end, and summer vacation was just around the corner. But before he could enjoy the wonderful summer break, he still had to face—final exams.

He needed to hit the books hard in the next couple of days!

“Do you feel confident about passing?” Tu Bo nudged him.

“Don’t worry, the final exams won’t trip me up,” Scholar Song said confidently.

Li Yangde chuckled, “Last year, Tu Bo said the same thing. Then he ended up needing to retake the exam, and I had to tutor him through it.”

“Don’t kick a man when he’s down, Yangde!” Tu Bo punched Yangde playfully.

Gao turned to them and asked, “So, do you guys have any plans for the summer?”

Tu Bo replied, “What else? I’ll just go back home and mess around at my dad’s auto repair shop. He’s brought in a lot of new machinery this year, so I’ll have plenty to tinker with all summer.”

As Scholar Song arrived, the temperature around them had noticeably dropped to a refreshing chill—what a strange occurrence.

Li Yangde added, “I have to attend a launch event. The new program I’ve been developing with others is nearing completion. I’ll be busy with that for the next couple of months.”

Gao looked pained and exclaimed, “You two just don’t understand how to enjoy life, do you? Besides machinery and programming, this beautiful summer should be spent having fun! Beaches, plateaus, snow-capped mountains, the depths of the ocean, tropical islands! Life is short; we should be making the most of our youth!”

Li Yangde shot him a strange look and said, “What’s the point of wasting life on frivolous activities like tourism?”

“You’re hopeless in every sense!” Gao sighed, rubbing his forehead.

Tu Bo tilted his head and asked, “Okay, so are you treating?”

“It’s not me treating… it’s Zhuge Zhongyang,” Gao chuckled, glancing at Scholar Song and nodding towards Lu Fei.

Scholar Song immediately understood—Zhuge Zhongyang had finally picked a date for a date trip and wanted to invite Lu Fei’s sister out to sea!

“Have you settled on a location? Need any help?” Scholar Song asked.

“Heading out to the depths of the East Sea, there’s a newly built artificial island that’s supposed to be quite nice. After we get bored, there are several nearby countries to choose from, so we can go anywhere we want. We’ll finalize everything after the exams,” Gao replied with a grin.

“Alright, just call me if you need assistance,” Scholar Song said.

...

In the afternoon class, the other students were busy jotting down the key points the teacher highlighted. These points were basically the topics that would appear in the exams.

Scholar Song rested his chin on his hand, multitasking.

On one hand, he was secretly operating the “True Self Meditation Scripture” to purify and enhance his mental power. On the other hand, he was effortlessly memorizing everything the teacher was saying.

Lu Fei stole a glance at Scholar Song. She initially thought he was paying close attention, but upon closer inspection, she found he seemed to be daydreaming. She couldn’t help but chuckle.

After class.

The three roommates packed their things, and Scholar Song stood up to stretch.

“Scholar, do you want to borrow my class notes?” Lu Fei asked quietly.

“Ah? No need, I’ve got it all in my head,” Scholar Song replied with a smile.

“Okay, just let me know if you need them.” Lu Fei kindly pulled back her notebook and, after thinking for a moment, offered to walk back to the dormitory with him.

Behind them, Gao nudged his glasses, “Looks like you’ve already made a connection.”

“Isn’t it from the last time we had the spicy fish heads? Tsk tsk, Scholar Song is so contradictory. He says he doesn’t want anything, yet he’s already holding hands,” Tu Bo whispered.

Scholar Song sighed inwardly, deciding to maintain his silence…

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

After parting ways with his roommates, Scholar Song returned to the Alchemical Sage’s house.

Doudou wasn’t in the room—he probably went to chase that handsome guy with a striking appearance and strong build, as per their agreement. Whether the other person was a cultivator or an ordinary person would soon be revealed.

Venerable White was sitting in front of the computer, his fingers flying across the keyboard.

“What are you looking at, senior?” Scholar Song casually asked.

“Various things—movies, classics, Huaxia history, world history, and so on. I’ve been in seclusion for over a hundred and fifty years and need to quickly familiarize myself with the common knowledge of this world. I must say, with the internet and computers, it’s so much easier to gather information,” Venerable White smiled, sharing his experiences of how to supplement his knowledge after a long period of isolation.

“How does the current world feel compared to over a hundred years ago?” Scholar Song asked with a grin.

“Hmm, technology has advanced rapidly, but the price paid is also significant. Moreover, literary works are much more interesting compared to what they were a hundred and fifty years ago. In this era, people's ways of thinking and creativity have exploded,” Venerable White nodded thoughtfully.

Since ancient times, he could only see scripts and epics. So, for now, he found it easier to accept written forms of information like movies and television.

“Haha.” Scholar Song nodded, chuckling—thanks to the internet, authors' imaginations had run wild, spiraling out of control.

“However, there are still some things that catch my attention,” Venerable White smiled slightly, his eyes narrowing.

“Like what?”

“Castration? Bad endings?” Venerable White chuckled.

“......”

“Enough of that. Little friend Song, come here!” Venerable White closed his computer and beckoned Scholar Song over.

Curious, Scholar Song walked over to him.

Venerable White extended his slender fingers and pulled out the ‘Soul-sealing Ice Pearl’ hanging around Scholar Song’s neck. “This is a mid-grade phantom spirit; its quality is quite good. Are you not going to contract it?”

“I was waiting for your guidance on how to contract a phantom spirit,” Scholar Song replied. “When I obtained the phantom spirit, I was still skeptical about the existence of cultivators. Later, I was fortunate to gather the materials for the ‘Five Elements Contracting Spirit Altar’, but I hadn’t even completed my foundation establishment. By the time I opened my heart and finished my foundation, you had left. So no one has taught me how to contract a phantom spirit yet.”

“Perfect! I’ll teach you!” Venerable White smiled. “I’ve always been grateful for your care. Tonight, at midnight, when the yin energy is at its peak, I’ll help you set up the ‘Five Elements Contracting Spirit Altar’. Before that, I’ll explain the principles of the altar and how to handle the backlash from the phantom spirit during the contracting process.”

“Great!” Scholar Song said, joyfully gripping the ‘Soul-sealing Ice Pearl’ against his chest.

Finally, it was time to contract the phantom spirit!

“However, senior, I only have two sets of materials for the contracting spirit formation,” Scholar Song mentioned.

“Two sets? Hmm, if all goes well, that should be enough. No worries; they’re easy-to-collect items. Even if you fail both times, I can take you around the world to gather more materials for the ‘Five Elements Contracting Spirit Altar’,” Venerable White laughed.

With Venerable White's reassurance, Scholar Song felt a sense of calm wash over him!

With newfound confidence, he felt the chances of success rising significantly.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Midnight was approaching, the time between eleven o’clock and one in the morning.

Scholar Song opened his eyes, finishing the operation of the “True Self Meditation Scripture.” He had adjusted his state to the best possible condition—his vitality was abundant, and his spirit was high.

Venerable White took out a robe etched with the formation, making a few adjustments to perfect it.

Then, he placed the five elemental stones in the five corners of the formation, with the Thunderstrike Wood in the center. Afterward, he placed various materials representative of the five elements accordingly.

“Take the Soul-sealing Ice Pearl and place it on the Thunderstrike Wood. Then recite the incantation I taught you to activate the formation,” Venerable White instructed, holding the bottle of Ghost Dragon’s Saliva.

Scholar Song carefully placed the Soul-sealing Ice Pearl atop the Thunderstrike Wood.

He began to recite the incantation.

Seizing the opportunity, Venerable White opened the bottle containing the Ghost Dragon’s Saliva and poured it over the formation’s robe and the Soul-sealing Ice Pearl. As the saliva landed on the pearl, it sizzled like it was dropped onto molten iron, instantly releasing a cloud of white mist.

In the next moment, the white mist coalesced into the form of the spirit that had previously manifested the ‘Golden Shield’!
