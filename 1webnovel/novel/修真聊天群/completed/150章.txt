**The Enigmatic Immortal Statue**

Deep within the village of Linyao, the sound waves resonating from the surroundings connected with the green flute in Scholar Song's hand.

*“Zizi…”* A crackling noise emerged from the flute, followed by a soft, gentle voice: “Hello!”

Was that really the voice of Immortal White? It sounded incredibly clear; this communication device was just as effective as a modern smartphone!

“Hello, Immortal White,” Scholar Song replied to the green flute. “I am Scholar Song. Under the direction of Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, I have come to escort you out of your seclusion. Where are you at this moment?”

He felt a thrill of anticipation. Soon, he would witness the place where a ‘True Immortal’ had been in seclusion for over a hundred years!

He envisioned a scene akin to a ‘fairyland,’ with layers upon layers of dazzling magical formations overhead, shielding the area like a grand cinematic effect.

It had to be magnificent!

*“Zizi… Hello, this is ‘A Bai’s’ seclusion location. There are still 0 days, 5 hours, and 6 quarters until the end of seclusion. Please wait patiently!”* The soft voice continued, slightly stiff when announcing the countdown.

Scholar Song froze for a moment, immediately reminded of the automated voice prompts from his mobile carrier whenever he checked his balance.

After a while, he looked at his companion, the Shih Tzu, Dou Dou. “Isn’t Immortal White supposed to be the one responding?”

Was the voice coming from the green flute just another automated message?

“Of course not! Immortal White is still in deep seclusion. Have you ever seen a cultivator in deep seclusion come out to chat? That wouldn’t be deep seclusion; it would just be regular seclusion,” Dou Dou scoffed.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but feel a bit scorned by his fluffy companion.

“I’ve never been in deep seclusion, nor have I heard any seniors in the group mention what it’s like to be in that state. Plus, didn’t Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain say that Immortal White had already contacted him? I thought Immortal White could occasionally reach out while in seclusion,” he explained.

It seemed that Immortal White had set up the ‘voice prompt’ long before, programmed to automatically contact Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain when the seclusion period was nearing its end.

It turned out that the functions of modern smartphones, such as voice prompts and alarm reminders, had already been toyed with by the elders of the cultivation world hundreds of years ago.

“There are still over five and a half hours left—about eleven hours. We can’t just wait here. How about we find a place to sit?” Scholar Song sighed.

“Great idea! Let’s find an internet café! That’s plenty of time for me and my wife to clear a few dungeons!” Dou Dou perked up with excitement.

“Don’t be ridiculous. Playing games in an internet café would draw too much attention,” Scholar Song quickly dismissed.

Dou Dou looked at him disdainfully. “Duh! Can’t you just book a private room?”

Once again, Scholar Song felt the sting of being looked down upon by his own pet.

“Fine, you make a good point. I’ll book a small room for you!” He patted his pockets, glad to find he had his wallet and ID.

“Scholar Song, you’re awesome! What a great person!” Dou Dou immediately showered him with praise.

—Being called a good person by a dog was something else entirely!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Linyao Village was a bustling settlement, thanks to its proximity to the city center, drawing in a large crowd.

Scholar Song easily found a decent internet café.

With the widespread use of personal computers, internet cafés had seen a decline in business. However, due to the high transient population in Linyao Village, there were still many people visiting to go online.

“Excuse me, do you have any private rooms available?” Scholar Song inquired.

The cashier checked the computer and replied, “Hello! Yes, we still have small rooms available!”

“Great! I’d like to book one. How much is it?” Scholar Song asked.

“It’s twenty yuan per hour.”

Scholar Song handed over his ID and two hundred yuan. “Let’s book it for ten hours.”

After completing the registration, he followed the manager to his private room with Dou Dou in tow.

As they walked, Scholar Song overheard the cashier talking with a colleague behind him. “Hey, have you heard? The unnamed immortal statue in the Unnamed Temple has become more lifelike recently. People say it almost seems like it’s coming to life!”

“You heard about that too? I have an even juicier piece of gossip! My mom told me a girl next door has been lovesick ever since she visited the Unnamed Temple a few days ago. She’s so infatuated with that immortal statue! Can you believe it? A statue!” 

Another staff member chimed in, “Haha, that girl’s lovesickness can be cured, but I have something even crazier. You know the manager who left a few days ago? He also visited the Unnamed Temple to pay respects to the statue. He came back acting dazed for days and eventually quit. I heard he’s planning to become a Taoist priest at the temple now! Now that’s a serious case of lovesickness, and it’s incurable! And that statue is a male!”

Scholar Song’s ears perked up, and he quietly slipped into his room.

“Sir, here’s your membership card. Anyone who spends over two hundred yuan gets one for free. Please keep it safe.” The manager handed him a card before departing.

“Thank you.” Scholar Song smiled and tucked the card away.

“Enjoy your time!” The manager waved goodbye.

Dou Dou hopped excitedly to the computer, exclaiming, “Scholar Song, hurry and log on! I can’t wait to dive into dungeons with my wife!”

He wondered if his wife had been harassed while he was offline. Just this morning, she had been camped out by another player.

“Hang on, I want to look something up first.” Scholar Song moved Dou Dou aside and opened a browser, searching for ‘Linyao Village, Unnamed Temple, Unnamed Immortal.’

Soon, a series of detailed news articles appeared on the screen.

Legend has it that centuries ago, during a severe drought, the villagers unearthed the ‘Unnamed Immortal Statue’ while digging a well. They then began to worship it. This tale was well-known among the villagers of Linyao.

The articles also included the exact address of the Unnamed Temple.

“Are you interested in this?” Dou Dou asked, puzzled.

“Yeah, I’m curious about all things ‘mysterious’ right now!” Scholar Song affirmed, intrigued by anything that defied ‘common sense’!

“Stay here and play. I’m going to check out that Unnamed Temple. Lock the door behind me, okay?” Scholar Song smiled.

“No problem! Just don’t disturb me. It’s best if you come back after you’ve escorted Immortal White!” Dou Dou waved his paw, eagerly diving into a game.

…

Following the address he found online, Scholar Song soon arrived at the Unnamed Temple in Linyao Village. “This is it!”

At first glance, he noticed many people paying their respects to the Unnamed Immortal, forming a queue to enter.

Inside the temple, the air was thick with incense, as worshippers made their wishes beneath the statue…

However, many young men and women appeared entranced, their eyes glazed over.

After lighting their incense, they stared dreamily at the Unnamed Immortal statue for a long time before reluctantly leaving. Clearly, they were members of the ‘lovesick’ and ‘incurable’ club.

Finally, it was Scholar Song’s turn. He purchased two incense sticks from a novice Taoist at the entrance for a reasonable price of twenty yuan.

Once inside the temple with three elderly women, he watched as they expertly inserted their incense and began their prayers.

They spoke in hushed tones, but Scholar Song could hear every word—his hearing had become exceptionally sharp lately.

“Immortal, my daughter is about to take her college entrance exams next year. Please grant her wisdom and intelligence so that her grades improve! Let her get into Kyoto University!”

“Immortal, my son is almost eighteen and still hasn’t found a girlfriend. Please help him find one. I have no other requirements—just a woman who can bear children!”

Then, the last elderly woman, calm and composed, whispered, “Immortal… I love you so much!”

Scholar Song nearly choked and had to stifle a laugh!

So it wasn’t just the ‘young men and women’ who were lovesick; even the elderly women were infatuated! Who knew there might even be some lovesick elderly men?

Scholar Song had never worshipped before; he had always believed in science and rejected superstition. He never thought he’d have the chance to enter a Taoist temple.

Following the lead of the three elderly women, he lit his own incense but found himself at a loss for what to wish for.

After all, his primary goal was to see the Unnamed Immortal statue.

Taking advantage of the distraction, Scholar Song quietly looked up at the Unnamed Immortal statue.

Just one glance… and in an instant, he felt his heart race.

It was just a statue, yet he was struck by the appearance of a figure in his mind.

A figure exuding a warm, jade-like aura, with an otherworldly grace.

Long, dark hair cascaded like a waterfall, eyes twinkling like stars, and a flowing white robe that gave the impression of soaring into the skies. Even the noble figure he’d seen from the Moon Blade Sect paled in comparison to this one.

Absolutely breathtaking!

Scholar Song could only describe the statue with that phrase.

Moreover, the longer he stared, the more he felt as if he was being drawn in, unable to pull away.

Wait a minute? Why am I also captivated by this statue?

Scholar Song felt a jolt of alarm and quickly closed his eyes, silently channeling the *True Self Meditation Sutra*.

His pounding heart gradually calmed down.

At that moment, the three elderly women rose and turned to leave the temple.

Scholar Song hurriedly followed suit…

What on earth just happened? Was I affected by some sort of mental spell? Was it akin to the ‘enchantment’ one might see in various films and shows?

He quickly scanned himself with his spiritual energy but found no traces of any spell affecting him.

Could it really be that the ‘statue’ was so exquisitely crafted that it reached an extreme of beauty?

Was it that perfect, causing anyone who saw it to be entranced, lost in its perfection?

Could such a perfect object exist in this world?

Scholar Song pondered—no, that’s impossible!

Then, I’d better go back and let Dou Dou check my condition again.
