**Look, a whale is flying in the sky!**

“Understood.” Whale Eight chuckled warmly, ending the communication with Wolf One.

Then, Whale Eight turned to Shark Nine. “Old Nine, go! Wolf One said we absolutely cannot let that little girl escape. Use lethal force to take her down!”

“Lethal force?” Shark Nine nodded silently. “I understand.”

This is the art of passing messages. 

Every original statement, when relayed verbally, changes just a little bit. By the time a message has been passed three times, it can end up being significantly different from the original.

Thus, Shark Nine, who received the command to “use lethal force,” sprang into action.

In an instant, he darted toward the girl in the black dress.

The girl, Chuchu, was a skilled swimmer, but compared to the two seasoned water dwellers—Whale Eight and Shark Nine—her swimming skills were hardly noteworthy.

Previously, Shark Nine and Whale Eight had surrounded her, pushing her into a corner without actually attacking her. But now that Shark Nine had received the order for a kill, his true swimming prowess came to the forefront.

In the blink of an eye, the distance between Shark Nine and the black-dressed girl shrank to about five meters.

Cold light flickered in Shark Nine’s tiny eyes as he wildly splashed his hands in the water.

As he moved his hands, his vital energy blended with the water, transforming into a swarm of sharp-toothed sharks. These sharks came to life, filled with vital energy, and swam energetically toward Chuchu.

“Kill! Hundred Sharks Palm!”

With his first move, he unleashed a deadly skill aimed at taking a life.

Shark Nine was a powerful cultivator at the second rank, an old-school true master with profound vital energy.

Feeling the murderous intent and the overwhelming pulse of vital energy behind her, Chuchu reluctantly halted her escape. Continuing to flee would mean taking the brunt of the attack on her back. The amount of vital energy behind this attack was terrifying; if it hit her, she wouldn’t just be injured—she’d be lucky to survive with half her life intact.

Although she was called a genius disciple, her cultivation time was still short, and she had only recently stepped into the realm of a second-rank true master. She wasn’t strong enough to face a full-force strike from another true master head-on.

Chuchu stopped and quickly drew a small short sword strapped to her thigh from beneath her stockings.

With a powerful stroke, she leapt out of the water.

As she broke the surface, she whispered, barely audible to anyone but herself, “In this life, I will forge only one sword.”

At that moment, the short sword in her hand hummed with energy.

Then, she spun around abruptly and thrust the short sword backward.

Behind her were thirteen vividly animated, sharp-toothed sharks surging through the water, crashing toward her.

Swish!

Chuchu’s short sword flickered rapidly as she unleashed twenty-six streaks of sword light in an instant, targeting the oncoming water sharks. Each shark received at least two strikes, crumbling under the sword energy and dissolving back into the ocean.

With the recoil from her thrust, Chuchu accelerated and dove back into the water, desperately swimming away…

She knew the two pursuing her were experts in the water; their speed would likely surpass hers. She had to find a way to escape quickly, or things were going to get very unfavorable for her.

Just as Chuchu turned to retreat… suddenly, she felt herself slam into a thick wall of flesh.

“Hehehe.” A deep, heavy laugh echoed in her ears.

Two massive arms wrapped around Chuchu, enveloping her in a terrifying grip.

Chuchu felt as if every bone in her body was about to shatter.

“Girls like you, delicate and petite, I love to hold you tight and then… crush you against my chest until you turn into a puddle of meat.” The deep voice chuckled.

It was the hulking Whale Eight. She hadn’t realized he had positioned himself right in her path, trapping her.

“Ahhhhhh…” Chuchu screamed as the grip tightened, making her feel like her bones were breaking. “You bastard, die!”

She twisted her wrist, aiming the short sword at Whale Eight.

“Useless. Your short sword can’t even pierce my defenses.” Whale Eight grinned foolishly.

Swish!

Chuchu’s short sword pierced his body but felt as though it had struck a thick, elastic rubber surface, sinking in until the hilt, yet not a drop of blood flowed from Whale Eight.

This thick layer of elastic material was Whale Eight’s prideful defense. The short sword hadn’t even penetrated his skin!

“I told you, it’s useless.” Whale Eight grinned mischievously, tightening his grip.

Crack! Crack! Chuchu felt her bones splintering. As if that wasn’t enough, two wild streams of vital energy surged into her body through Whale Eight’s arms, wreaking havoc from within.

“I love the feeling of petite women like you dying in my embrace; it’s truly a tragic scene. So… I’m going to kill you. Even if Wolf One wants you alive, I still want you dead.” Whale Eight whispered sinisterly.

But Chuchu couldn’t hear him anymore.

Am I going to die?

Her vision started to blur… her body felt lighter, as if her soul was about to leave her body.

And perhaps because she was on the brink of death, she began to see hallucinations.

She actually saw a giant whale flying in the sky.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

“Ahhhhhh!” In the sky, Scholar Song let out a string of terrified screams…

His mind was a muddled mess.

Scholar Song vaguely remembered meeting Tu Bo, Gao someone, and Zhuge Zhongyang and Zhuge Yue at the airport. Then he unexpectedly encountered his ‘nominal’ disciple Joseph, who had stared at him for a long time with a resentful expression.

Afterward, he seemed to have boarded a plane?

But then the next memory became fuzzy… Did he fall asleep?

He didn’t know how long he had been asleep, but when he opened his eyes, he suddenly realized he was high in the sky, plummeting downwards.

What’s happening? Did a plane crash? Where’s the plane? What about the other passengers?

A flurry of thoughts raced through his mind.

These thoughts intertwined, morphing into the scream that escaped from Scholar Song’s lips. However, his screams were quickly interrupted by another sound.

“Moo moo moo~~ moo~~” A deep, powerful call rang above Scholar Song’s head.

It was a… gigantic whale.

Like Scholar Song, the whale was stunned.

As a whale, it had experienced remarkable events in its life—like desert journeys, riding flying swords, and teleportation; and now, it was experiencing high-altitude free fall without a safety line!

What a grand whale life! If whales could communicate like humans, this epic adventure would surely impress many whale ladies.

The giant whale was screaming, but Scholar Song was in a daze.

What the hell… I can fall from the sky due to a plane crash, but how can this giant creature be falling too? Is there a whale hiding on the plane we’re on?

Don’t joke around; this is a civil aviation flight, not whale aviation.

Scholar Song felt that his memory was a bit off… It seemed like he had forgotten something important.

He furrowed his brows, desperately trying to recall.

Just then, a memory suddenly popped into his mind.

“Daddy, Daddy, aren’t you sad?” A cute little girl ran up to him, looking up with a bright smile. “If you’re sad, I can make you smile! If I make you smile, you’ll be happy, right?”

This was truly an angelic smile! Healing the heart, a single glance could make someone forget all their troubles.

Song Miao… his daughter!

A bewildering thought crossed Scholar Song’s mind.

What the hell! My daughter? Who gave birth to her? I haven’t even reached the legal marriage age!

While deep in thought, another scene invaded his mind.

He suddenly saw himself with a hazy-faced woman, watching their son, Song Ren, get married. A large, pregnant woman in a wedding dress approached them; she was his daughter-in-law.

Then he was holding a grown-up version of his daughter, Song Miao, and sending her off to get married…

What the hell! What is this memory?

Is this a dream I had on the plane?

No… something isn’t right.

These seem like experiences I actually went through? Did I lose my memory from boarding the plane until now?

Lose my memory?

East Sea?

Mysterious Island!

Scholar Song immediately thought of the Mysterious Island… Had he accidentally entered it? But he had clearly decided not to enter it even if he saw it; how did he end up inside without knowing?

Great, now he’s lost his memory.

…

…

“Moo~~ Moo moo moo~~” At that moment, the giant whale’s urgent calls yanked Scholar Song back to reality.

Damn… almost forgot, I’m currently plummeting from the sky.

What should I do now?

“Ahhhhhh… help!” Scholar Song screamed loudly—what else could he do? He couldn’t think of anything else.

Just as he was desperately screaming, another scene floated into his mind.

A hazy-faced woman was teaching him a martial arts technique. It seemed like a really powerful technique?

Instinctively, Scholar Song used the method of this technique.

“Roar~~~ Roar~~~” A heavy lion's roar echoed across the East Sea, booming like thunder rolling through the heavens, resonating endlessly.

A special technique: **Lion's Roar Art**—when roaring, it reverberates like thunder, capable of instilling terror and making enemies feel intense fear, possessing an incredible power to intimidate!

After two roars, Scholar Song realized his throat felt remarkably smooth, as if he had just taken a throat lozenge.

Unable to resist, he roared again, “Roar roar roar~~”

Wait a minute, am I too unconcerned? I’m currently falling from the sky, and while the water is below… 

While he was lost in thought, Scholar Song felt the energy in his fifth orifice, the **Mouth Orifice**, boiling over, gushing forth with vigor!

**Mouth Orifice, open!**
