**The Needs of Each Party**

"That day, Sable Seven of the Su Clan met with our sect leader. He is a well-known fifth-tier cultivator, and of course, we treated him with the utmost respect. Sable Seven and our leader exchanged pleasantries for quite a while, and at first, it was all very cordial," Brother Zhengyan recounted, his tone indicating a mix of nostalgia and bitterness.

"After that, Sable Seven inquired about the 'Seven Radiant Fruits.' He had a junior who had failed a tribulation and was injured by the heavenly wrath, so he was looking for a remedy to heal the wounds. Through introductions, he came to our sect... The 'Seven Radiant Fruits' have been a treasure passed down through our sect for generations, but somehow, their existence was leaked to some fellow cultivators and was even rumored to be a miraculous medicine. Eventually, the legend grew, and it was said that the 'Seven Radiant Fruits' could heal injuries from heavenly tribulations. Ironically, even we didn't know the fruit had such miraculous effects," Brother Zhengyan chuckled self-deprecatingly.

Rumors can only be quelled by the wise, yet foolishness runs rampant in the world. Especially for those in despair, it's easy to cling to extreme beliefs of "better safe than sorry."

Scholar Song listened quietly, wondering why Brother Zhengyan was sharing this story with him. However, since it concerned the esteemed Sable Seven, he remained attentive.

"In the end, Sable Seven asked if we could part with the 'Seven Radiant Fruits.' He would be willing to exchange it for a more valuable treasure. Our sect leader rejected his request because the 'Seven Radiant Fruits' are a priceless treasure of our sect, and they do not possess the ability to heal injuries from heavenly tribulations, making the trade impossible. Sable Seven did not insist further. He bid farewell to our leader and left the sect with his companions."

At this point, Brother Zhengyan paused, a frown creasing his brow. "However, none of us expected that on the very night after... Sable Seven broke into our sect, injuring eighteen of our disciples and stealing the 'Seven Radiant Fruits!'"

This was the grudge between Sable Seven and their sect.

Thus, the subsequent events unfolded where the comical elder tracked down Sable Sixteen, trying to capture him and force Sable Seven out into the open.

After hearing this, Scholar Song frowned slightly.

He recalled the assassin who attempted to kill Sable Sixteen. Clearly, there were individuals behind the scenes inciting the conflict between the sect and Sable Seven.

With this thought, Scholar Song softened his tone, "Do you have confirmation that it was indeed Sable Seven who broke into your sect that night?"

"Of course, we can confirm that. That night, our strongest brother, Zhengneng, along with thirty other brothers, was guarding the secret grounds of our sect. Sable Seven suddenly appeared, defeating Brother Zhengneng in one strike and severely wounding eighteen disciples. Every disciple present witnessed his appearance and his unique sword technique, 'Heavenly Blade Burying the Star Sea,'" Brother Zhengyan explained.

"..." Scholar Song's mouth twitched—there were just too many inconsistencies, and he didn't know where to begin with his sarcasm!

Sable Seven went to rob someone else's house and showed his true face?

And while committing such heinous acts under the cover of night, he had to showcase his 'unique skills'? As if he was afraid others wouldn't recognize him?

How foolish or arrogant must Sable Seven be to act like this?

"I suspect you might have some connection with Sable Seven's junior, which is why I'm sharing this account of events with you. I hope you won't get involved in the grudge between our sect and Sable Seven," Brother Zhengyan said, trying to dissuade Scholar Song from getting entangled in the dispute.

Scholar Song thought for a moment before replying, "I don’t know much about the enmity between you and Sable Seven, so I don’t have the right to speak on it. However, there's something I think you should know—it happened not long ago. That uncle from your sect tried to capture Sable Sixteen alive and failed. Afterward, he... retreated. But shortly after he left, an assassin made a sudden move to kill Sable Sixteen. If I hadn't coincidentally been present at the time, Sable Sixteen might have already been killed."

Having said that, Scholar Song refrained from elaborating further.

If they believed his words, they would reflect on their implications. If they didn't believe him, his explanations would only backfire.

Brother Zhengyan frowned, deep in thought.

In South Huazhong, Blue Origin Valley.

The Moonblade Sect had relocated its entire sect and arrived at 'Blue Origin Valley.'

This valley had been secretly constructed by the Moonblade Sect many years ago as a refuge, equipped with all sorts of facilities—it was essentially the sect's second headquarters.

Thanks to their prior preparations, the relocation of the Moonblade Sect's disciples was swift. In less than three hours, they had moved everything.

Under the arrangement of the elders of the Moonblade Sect, disciples settled into their respective residences based on their identities and statuses, unpacking their belongings.

Finally, the disciples began to set up a protective formation around the sect.

This 'Protective Sect Formation' had been researched and improved by Elder Hai. Once activated, it could temporarily boost the combat power of the Moonblade Sect disciples by twenty percent.

The disciples of the Moonblade Sect believed that with this formation in place, they could withstand an attack even from fifth-tier Spirit Monarchs who had condensed their Golden Cores!

With everything settled, Elder Hai reported the situation to Sect Leader Ba Qianjun. After that, he returned to his private residence in Blue Origin Valley.

His residence was clean and simple, with only a solitary purple bamboo placed in a pot.

As soon as Elder Hai entered the room, he activated the defensive formation to temporarily shield against outside prying eyes.

Then, with a flick of his right sleeve, a dark mist akin to the avatar of 'Anzhi Demon Lord' emerged, emitting a strange cackling laugh.

At the same time, the purple bamboo trembled slightly.

"The mission to assassinate Sable Sixteen has failed?" the purple bamboo quivered, producing a mechanical voice.

"Yes, what a pity. Even the 'Blood God Blade' talisman treasure couldn't eliminate Sable's junior. It turns out these young cultivators from prominent families are not so easily dealt with," Elder Hai said, placing his hand casually on the sword at his waist, a faint smile gracing his lips.

"This is troublesome; without this, we can't lure Sable Seven to deal with the Xian Nong Sect," the purple bamboo complained.

"Hehe, we anticipated this possibility from the start," the dark mist of Anzhi Demon Lord's avatar cackled. "As long as we can incite the Xian Nong Sect to attack the Moonblade Sect, we can achieve our goals regardless."

"Hmph, it doesn’t matter for you two, but I'll have to put in extra effort. So, as a fallback plan, have we captured Sable's junior? Without her, we can't lure Sable Seven here," the purple bamboo continued.

Elder Hai's expression turned serious, "Anzhi Demon Lord's avatar personally went to capture Sable's junior. I've also sent a lovely tool to temporarily hold Sable Seven back. You should have succeeded, right?"

"Uh..." the dark mist hesitated, "How should I put it? Because a large dog interrupted, in my haste, I caught the wrong person... You all know that to me, humans and monkeys look quite similar; it's hard to distinguish."

The purple bamboo mocked, "So you’re saying the second plan has also failed?"

"Not entirely. As long as we make a move against Sable's junior, regardless of whether we successfully capture her, Sable Seven's character dictates that he will come to the Moonblade Sect seeking revenge for any clue he receives about her. If he doesn't come... I will personally lure him here," the dark mist of Anzhi Demon Lord's avatar gritted its teeth.

"That's what you said, not us pressuring you," the purple bamboo sneered. "Just don’t get cleaved by Sable Seven in the process."

"Hmph. Don’t worry; I have my ways," the dark mist of Anzhi Demon Lord's avatar coldly replied.

Elder Hai sat in a chair, propping his chin with one hand, a subtle smile playing on his lips, "Then let’s proceed with the second plan... For now, we need to draw the Xian Nong Sect over here to test out the might of the formation I’ve 'painstakingly reformed.' It’ll also boost the morale of the Moonblade Sect disciples since they will soon face the formidable Sable Seven."

The purple bamboo trembled slightly, "Alright, I will figure out a way to draw the experts from the Xian Nong Sect. At that time, we must eliminate their key figures, but the sect leader must be kept alive for a few days to arrange the aftermath, allowing us to seize the secrets of the Xian Nong Sect."

Elder Hai nodded, "Act quickly; we need to get the Xian Nong Sect's people to Blue Origin Valley before Sable Seven arrives."

"Rest assured, I will prepare right away," the purple bamboo replied.

At that moment, the dark mist of Anzhi Demon Lord's avatar cackled, "Hehe, by the way, I didn’t manage to catch Sable Seventeen, but I encountered some people from the Xian Nong Sect on the way, one of whom seemed to be named 'Zhengde.' He appears to have some standing in the Xian Nong Sect. I thought he might be useful, so I captured him."

"Zhengde of the Xian Nong Sect? If it's him, he could indeed be useful. Keep him alive for now, just in case," the purple bamboo responded.

"Alright, let’s set our plans in motion. Here’s to our success," Elder Hai stood up.

"It will definitely go smoothly," Anzhi Demon Lord's avatar grinned menacingly.

"We will surely succeed," the purple bamboo trembled slightly before settling down.

The dark mist of Anzhi Demon Lord's avatar slid back into Elder Hai's sleeve.

…

…

Elder Hai removed the defensive formation from the room, rested for a moment, then headed back to Sect Leader Ba Qianjun.

Ba Qianjun was still lounging in a chair made of cold iron, staring blankly at the 'Seven Radiant Fruit' beside him. This was the treasure that could heal his injuries from the heavenly tribulation. Unfortunately, it couldn't simply be consumed; it lacked the 'method of use.'

Upon seeing Elder Hai enter, Ba Qianjun's eyes brightened. "Elder Hai, is the second plan about to commence?"

Elder Hai nodded slightly, "Yes, Sect Leader. I've just contacted our inside man in the Xian Nong Sect. He has begun spreading the word about 'Sable Seven' and the 'Seven Radiant Fruits' within the Moonblade Sect. Next, we need to find a location to ambush the Xian Nong Sect and wipe out their key figures. This way, our informant can inherit everything from the Xian Nong Sect and acquire the recipe for the 'Seven Radiant Fruits.' At that point, the 'Heavenly Tribulation Fire' that has tormented you for so long can finally be cured."

"That would be wonderful!" Ba Qianjun exclaimed, the torment of the 'Heavenly Tribulation Fire' weighing heavily on him. Now, he wouldn't miss any chance for even a glimmer of healing!

"What a pity; if the first plan had gone smoothly, we wouldn't even need to lift a finger. With Sable Seven's power, we could have crippled the entire Xian Nong Sect, allowing our inside man to seize all of their secrets," Ba Qianjun lamented.

"Man proposes, heaven disposes," Elder Hai smiled gently.

"You’re right, Elder," Ba Qianjun straightened his back. "But if we plot more, I don’t believe that heaven will deny us success every time!"

Elder Hai nodded with a smile.

Heaven disposes? Ha!

Everything is within my control; why rely on heaven?

Meanwhile, at the disciples’ quarters of the Xian Nong Sect.

"Brother Zhengneng is here!" a disciple exclaimed joyfully.

In the distance, a man clad in the blue attire of the Xian Nong Sect was swiftly approaching them, moving at a remarkable speed…
