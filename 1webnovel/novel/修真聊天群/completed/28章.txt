**A Dead Horse is Better Than No Horse at All, Let's Go!**

**3.5 Hours Later...**

Scholar Song's eyes sparkled with determination, but his body was starting to feel the strain. 

"Forty-first herb down, finally nearing the end," he muttered to himself.

He hadn’t expected to last this long on his first try at alchemy. However, he was reaching his limits. After this herb, he only had the Fresh Overlord Branch, Nine Yang Red Flame Bamboo slices, Deep Sea Cold Crystal, and the Snow Demon’s Core left. He could hold on until the end!

With a swift motion, he opened the pot and tossed in the forty-first herb.

Just as he was about to put the lid on, a sudden change erupted from the hot pot.

The pale gray potion, which had combined with the previous forty herbs, released a dreadful stench and burnt odor upon contact with the new ingredient!

The half-filled pot of potion quickly evaporated, losing a fifth of its volume in an instant!

“Tsk, is it a failure already?” Scholar Song sighed, feeling distressed. He wondered if adding water at the beginning had doomed him from the start.

Yet, having made it to the forty-first herb without mishap, a flicker of hope ignited within him. Perhaps this was the unique gambler's psychology of humanity?

But now, was he destined to fail completely?

“No, not yet!” Scholar Song exclaimed, noticing that although the gray potion was evaporating rapidly, it was still stubbornly merging with the forty-first herb.

He realized he needed to take action; doing nothing would indeed lead to disaster.

In fact, the forty-first herb was the most critical step in creating the "Simplified Body Refining Liquid." From this point on, the next four herbs would not enhance the potion's potency.

The Fresh Overlord Branch and Nine Yang Red Flame Bamboo slices were the essence of Yang and strength, while the Deep Sea Cold Crystal and Snow Demon’s Core represented Yin and gentleness. These four herbs were essential for purifying the "Simplified Body Refining Liquid."

Purification was the most crucial step. Without it, the potion would merely be a nourishing soup, giving a pleasant feeling but lacking real refining effects. By adding the purification step, this ordinary soup could transform into a celestial liquid, a potion of true power.

The forty-first herb served as the catalyst for this purification.

This step was notoriously the easiest to botch. Fay Yu had failed countless times at this very point.

But how could he salvage this failure?

If only an experienced alchemist were present, their skills and expertise could save this batch—no, this pot of "Body Refining Liquid."

But Scholar Song had neither experience nor the technical knowledge of an alchemist.

“The evaporation is too fast; I need to slow this down. Add water!” He acted on impulse, pouring a ladle of water into the pot. While uncertain if it would help, the evaporation rate did slow considerably.

“Four herbs left.”

Scholar Song's mind raced.

He didn’t have time to refine another batch. In an hour or two, his roommates would likely return.

Honestly, if they caught him in the kitchen "refining pills," he couldn’t guarantee they wouldn’t tie him up and haul him off to a psychiatric hospital.

Given their overly enthusiastic characters, each of them would probably hand him at least ten “good person” cards—a high likelihood!

“Let’s just throw in the remaining herbs all at once and see what happens. After all, I’m already close to failure; I might as well gain some experience,” he resolved.

The Hermit of North River and Fay Yu had both failed many times. If he were to succeed on his first try, that would be truly bizarre!

He opened the pot again.

The Fresh Overlord Branch, Nine Yang Red Flame Bamboo slices, Deep Sea Cold Crystal, and Snow Demon’s Core were all tossed in together.

He quickly covered the pot!

What followed was a true display of ‘ice and fire’ in the hot pot.

The Fresh Overlord Branch and Nine Yang Red Flame Bamboo slices began to glow red as they heated up, looking as if they might ignite at any moment. The potion bubbled even more violently, and the steam began to escape through the pot’s vent like a geyser.

Meanwhile, the Deep Sea Cold Crystal and Snow Demon’s Core reacted to the heat, cracking open and releasing a chilling blue liquid. This icy fluid seemed to drop the temperature considerably, calming the boiling potion.

The cooler potion was dropping in temperature while the boiling portion evaporated faster, showing signs of separation.

He couldn’t let them split apart! Scholar Song's mind raced, and he immediately cranked up the induction stove, trying to bring the cooling portion back to a boil.

As the temperature rose, the evaporation rate increased. In less than a minute, what had once been half a pot of potion dwindled to less than a third.

At this rate, it would evaporate completely within ten breaths.

“Well, it seems I’ve failed completely,” Scholar Song chuckled, having prepared himself for this outcome. He wasn’t too concerned about the failure.

He reached out to turn off the induction stove, knowing that if he let it keep cooking, the pot would burn.

Just as his finger hovered over the switch, he paused—he saw that although the potion was evaporating faster, it was no longer separating. It was merging back together!

Without thinking, Scholar Song decided against shutting off the heat. Instead, he steeled himself and cranked the heat up to maximum!

He was making a bold bet, pushing the potion to merge all forty-five herbs and extract their properties before the entire mixture evaporated! Perhaps he could salvage something before it was all gone?

The induction stove roared to life, making strange noises.

Inside the pot, ice and fire intertwined in a dazzling display. The two potion segments rolled and thrashed violently.

In the end, Scholar Song could no longer see the changes within the pot.

The potion had evaporated to the point that a thick layer of residue coated the reinforced glass lid.

Drip, drip... The sound of the boiling herbs echoed, each bubble popping precisely every second.

Scholar Song grasped his phone tightly, keeping an eye on the time.

With the pot's contents obscured, he planned to shut off the induction stove in five minutes.

Three minutes and twenty-three seconds.

Boom...

Suddenly, a high-pressure wave erupted from the pot, launching the lid into the air.

Immediately after, a plume of black smoke burst forth, enveloping the entire small kitchen and filling the air with a pungent odor.

The stench was overwhelming, a fusion of the most repugnant smells imaginable. Just catching a whiff made him feel like he might vomit.

“Ugh...” Scholar Song pinched his nose and quickly turned off the induction stove.

“It stinks!” Even with his nose pinched shut, the foul odor invaded his senses, refusing to dissipate.

He dashed to the window and threw it open; if he didn’t ventilate the kitchen, he’d have to wait for his roommates to find him and take him to the morgue—cause of death: suffocation from the terrible smell.

As the window opened, the black mist billowed out, and the rancid odor gradually dissipated.

“This smell is beyond description. It's haunting!” Scholar Song lamented, suspecting he wouldn’t be able to shake this scent for days. Would he even be able to eat again soon?

“This concoction went so wrong it could serve as a biological weapon. If I could bottle this smell, I’d unleash it in someone’s room whenever I felt displeased—guaranteed unforgettable!” he joked to himself.

On the floor, the pot lid continued to spin. Fortunately, it was made of tempered glass, so it didn’t break; otherwise, he would have to pay for damages to the school.

After picking up the lid, Scholar Song felt a wave of dizziness wash over him. Exhaustion crashed over him like a tidal wave, accumulated over nearly four hours of effort!

He quickly braced himself against the table and sat down slowly.

After resting for a moment, he pinched his nose and peered into the bottom of the pot, curious about what exactly had gone wrong to produce such a foul odor.

Inside the pot, he saw that what had once been half a pot of potion had reduced to a thin layer.

It was black and transparent, exuding a piercingly strong odor.

“Black and gooey, looks a bit like transparent sesame paste. Just way too stinky,” Scholar Song grimaced.

“Wait? This... how is this possible?” He suddenly remembered something and quickly pulled out a notebook that contained the alchemical formulas from the alchemist.

The potion had become a paste, was black and transparent, with a strong odor. This was precisely how the alchemist described the final state of the simplified body refining liquid.

It seemed to bear a striking resemblance to what he had produced...
