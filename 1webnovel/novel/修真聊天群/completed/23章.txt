**The Methods of Master Lingdie**

The opponent's strength was far beyond what the altar master had imagined; they were on completely different levels.

With just a casual slap, that girl demonstrated terrifying power. The formidable golden shield of the Phantom Spirit crumbled like paper beneath her delicate hand.

Moreover, when dealing with the two Phantom Spirits, she had pulled out a golden talisman. That level of high-grade material would cost him at least half his life if he took a hit.

"She’s at least at the peak of the second-grade True Master level, and could even be the legendary third-grade Postnatal Battle King. And yet, she’s so young!" The altar master couldn’t help but feel that all these years he had lived were practically wasted.

In terms of both strength and treasures, he was nowhere near her match. If he attempted a sneak attack, the outcome would be no better than the two Phantom Spirits.

No, if he dared to attack, he would undoubtedly fare worse than the two Phantom Spirits. After all, they still had some value to Fay Yu, while he held not even the slightest worth. A worthless enemy was best sent to the grave without a second thought.

And then there was that seemingly ordinary man. He couldn’t sense even a hint of vitality or true energy emanating from him. Yet, this unassuming man casually sat down and located the terrifying focal point of the massive sealing formation. At the most critical moment, he activated the formation, completely sealing the two Phantom Spirits.

That level of insight and confidence, paired with his status as a ‘senior,’ made the altar master’s legs tremble with fear when he reflected upon it.

He had always been a cautious man, or rather, someone who was easily frightened.

It was precisely because of his caution that he had been able to practice the ‘Ghost-Banishing’ dark arts, creating evil spirits and Phantom Spirits everywhere, yet had lived unscathed for over a hundred and seventy years.

But still, he couldn’t accept it.

Sixty years! He had spent sixty years at Ghost Lantern Temple, battling Phantom Spirits! All of his schemes from sixty years ago, all his waiting, had ended with nothing to show for it.

No matter how timid he was, he could not simply resign himself to this fate.

The altar master felt a heaviness in his chest. He looked up at the starry sky, his voice filled with sorrow, “You took your Phantom Spirits, but at least leave mine behind!”

One of the Phantom Spirits in Ghost Lantern Temple had been sealed by Master Lingdie. The other, however, belonged to the altar master!

Why had he not taken his Phantom Spirits away long before, and instead waited until Fay Yu and her companions arrived?

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to take them. For years after the Phantom Spirits matured, he had been consumed with thoughts of retrieving them from Huang Dagen's grave!

But he simply couldn’t do it!

The original Ghost Lantern Temple, surrounding Huang Dagen’s grave, was maddeningly protected by seven incredibly powerful formations. Aside from the obvious spirit-confining formation and the ‘Poison Dragon Grass’ formation triggered by Scholar Song, five more terrifying formations lurked around Huang Dagen’s tomb. These were the kind of formations he couldn’t break even if he had a thousand years.

Once activated, these formations required a descendant of Master Lingdie’s bloodline to open them. As long as these formations remained intact, no one could retrieve the Phantom Spirits inside!

The Phantom Spirits could enter but could not exit!

This was precisely what the altar master despised the most—he could put Phantom Spirits in, but he couldn’t take them out.

Years ago, he had overlooked the hidden formations, mistakenly believing that by relying on Huang Dagen, he could break the spirit-confining formation. He had then blissfully treated Ghost Lantern Temple as his own treasure, just waiting for the Phantom Spirits to mature.

Perhaps this Luo Xin district was truly his blessed land. After hiding away for a few years, he fortuitously obtained an immature Phantom Spirit. He happily sent it into Huang Dagen’s grave for nourishment.

But when the Phantom Spirits matured and he sought to retrieve them, he discovered the six hidden formations.

This was utterly infuriating.

In truth, he should have realized it with a bit of thought—after all, it was a place prepared for his daughter’s cultivation of Phantom Spirits. Master Lingdie would never have been careless. Even if the master looked down upon Phantom Spirits, once he had purchased the land, he would have regarded the Phantom Spirits as his own treasure. There was no way he would only leave behind a spirit-confining formation!

Sadly, this simple logic had eluded the altar master, blinded by greed, sixty years ago.

“No, I can’t just let this go. At the very least… at the very least, I must retrieve the Phantom Spirit that belongs to me. I would pay any price, even sacrificing everything I have now.” The altar master muttered to himself.

As long as he had a single Phantom Spirit, he would have the opportunity to break through his current second-grade True Master realm and reach the third-grade Postnatal Battle King realm, extending his dwindling lifespan by another hundred years!

Even if he had to kneel and offer everything he owned, he wouldn’t hesitate to pay any price at all.

With one last look at Huang Dagen’s tomb surrounded by the formations, the altar master walked away, his steps heavy with sorrow.

……

After the altar master left, a tall, handsome young man appeared in the forest. He wore a lazy expression as he pulled out his phone and made a call.

“Master, my junior sister has successfully located Ghost Lantern Temple and sealed the Phantom Spirits. She’s back now and likely to return to Lingdie Island tomorrow or the day after.” The young man reported earnestly, though his voice carried an innate languor.

“That’s good. That girl has been quite a handful; did she encounter any troubles along the way?” The voice of Master Lingdie came through the phone.

“Not really, no issues.” The young man replied.

“Very well. Continue looking after your junior sister, and report back to me when you arrive at Lingdie Island. Also, tidy up the formations I set up, to prevent them from activating and causing harm to ordinary people. I appreciate your hard work, Jian Yi.” 

“Leave it to me! I’ll handle it, you can count on me!” The young man, Liu Jian Yi, grinned and hung up, shrugging his shoulders.

In reality, there were some small surprises, like that altar master, and that man named Scholar Song.

Watching the altar master’s retreating figure, Liu Jian Yi yawned, “Well, what can I say? This guy seems to know his place. He didn’t make a move, saving me the trouble.”

The altar master was fortunate; he hadn’t found an opportunity to act. Otherwise, even if he dared to assume an attacking posture against Fay Yu, he would have ended up alongside Huang Dagen in the grave.

As for Scholar Song… he was quite the headache! If Master Lingdie discovered that Fay Yu had barged into this man’s room at night, wouldn’t he be furious?

He wondered if his master would assign him the task of monitoring Scholar Song. So, it was imperative to keep any information regarding Scholar Song from the master.

What a hassle, Liu Jian Yi thought lazily. After all, Fay Yu hadn’t lost a single hair or suffered any losses; instead, she had received a lot of help from Scholar Song.

Most importantly, he was a man who valued efficiency—he had once trained in breathing techniques to the point where he only needed to breathe two or three times a month. His life philosophy was simple: if a task could be accomplished with one finger, he would never use two.

He would never voluntarily seek out trouble!

……

Fay Yu would never suspect that her journey to Ghost Lantern Temple, spurred by her father’s journal, had been silently supported by him all along. Master Lingdie had even sent disciples to watch over his daughter, demonstrating his deep care.

In truth, even if the Wild Blade of Three Tides hadn’t acted foolishly, Master Lingdie would have found another reason to temporarily leave Lingdie Island.

It was just unfortunate that the Wild Blade of Three Tides had stumbled into the line of fire, saving the master the effort of finding an excuse.

The next day.

June 3rd, Monday, sunny.

Scholar Song didn’t manage to drag himself out of bed until eight o'clock.

This time, Fay Yu did not barge into his room, which relieved him greatly.

After getting up, he dialed the bedside phone to Fay Yu: “Are you awake?”

“I’m up already. Just finished my morning meditation. Senior, are we heading back?” Fay Yu’s soft voice replied.

“Let’s have some breakfast first, then we’ll head back.” Scholar Song responded, as the hotel offered a complimentary breakfast buffet.
