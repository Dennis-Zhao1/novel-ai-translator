**Using Magic to Play Basketball is a Dishonorable Act!**

As soon as the Hermit of North River and the Wild Blade of Three Tides returned to the chat group, the atmosphere in the Ninefold Land One group instantly became lively.

Earlier that morning, the two had been discussing the mysterious island, their conversation buzzing with excitement and curiosity, despite the fact that their memories had been sealed and they couldn’t yet unlock them.

Wild Blade of Three Tides asked in the group, “North River, don’t you have a company that’s assisting Middle Land with the Mars probe? Can you get us a probe? We can find a way to modify it so that it won’t be blocked by the mysterious island’s power! Then we can locate that mysterious island and send the probe in!”

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain chimed in, “Brilliant idea! If we go in ourselves, we’ll have our memories sealed. But if we send a probe in remotely, we might be able to capture some secrets of the mysterious island. I refuse to believe that the powerful beings on that island can seal our memories from afar!”

“Exactly! That’s what I was thinking,” replied the Hermit of North River. “I initially invested in this to get a few probes out. Once I advance to the sixth rank of True Monarch, I plan to launch them to nearby planets to search for cultivation resources. However, creating a complete Mars probe won’t be easy and will take time.”

“Great! We’re in no rush; we can wait,” Wild Blade of Three Tides praised.

Scholar Song, observing the conversation, felt a surge of excitement. Were the seniors already investing in aerospace, preparing to conquer the stars and seas?

After some more discussion about the modifications needed for the Mars probe, the seniors’ spirits were high.

Then, the Hermit of North River shifted the conversation to other topics: “I saw today’s Cultivator Daily, and it says that the Feast of the Food Immortals hosted by the beautiful Biexue Fairy is in the preparation stage. Who has more extra slots for participation? Just thinking about the Feast makes my mouth water!”

“The slots? Aqi and the Tianhe Su Clan might have a few, and the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain will definitely have some as well. As for the rest, I’m not sure,” said the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain casually. “This year, I only have one slot for myself—no extras.”

The Hermit of North River exclaimed eagerly, “@Su Clan Aqi, Aqi, Aqi! Do you have any extra slots?”

“Nope, I’ve given them all away,” Su Clan Aqi quickly replied. He was currently busy torturing the leader of the Jingmo faction to extract information about the Wujimazong's branch.

“…” The Hermit of North River felt dejected and then called on the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain again: “Immortal Sage, do you have any extra slots?”

“None. This year, I only have one and a half slots. Besides myself, I can take one more person—just Dou Dou,” replied the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain. “Others probably don’t have extra slots either. Biexue Fairy suddenly reduced the number of slots for her Feast this year; usually, there are two or three, but this year most people only got one.”

“Don’t! I want to meet the beautiful Biexue Fairy! What’s the menu like this year? Are there any ingredients missing? If it comes to it, I can donate ingredients to attend the Feast!” the Hermit of North River lamented.

The Feast of the Food Immortals distributes some slots each year to powerful families and sects. These families and sects are responsible for providing Biexue Fairy with a large number of cultivation resources and exotic ingredients throughout the year. The more resources and ingredients they provide, the more slots they can receive for the Feast. Additionally, outside of the Feast, Biexue Fairy often hosts banquets for these families and sects with fixed slots.

However, every year during the Feast, there are always some ingredients that even the most powerful families and sects can’t provide. That’s when Biexue Fairy issues a menu. Anyone who can provide around twenty items from this menu can exchange them for a slot at the Feast.

“The menu is still a while off; the families just started submitting their ingredients to Biexue Fairy. Once they finish, if there are any shortages, that’s when she’ll put out the menu. You should prepare in advance,” the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain chuckled.

Wild Blade of Three Tides also sent a smiley face: “Prepare well, North River. When Biexue Fairy doesn’t want certain ingredients, you might consider selling them to me at a low price~”

“Get lost!” the Hermit of North River retorted angrily. Can ingredients worthy of the Feast of the Food Immortals be anything ordinary? Sell them at a low price? No way!

Scholar Song observed this exchange, stroking his chin. “It seems the Feast of the Food Immortals is really special?”

Even a senior like the Hermit of North River wanted to attend this banquet. He couldn’t help but wonder what kind of charm Biexue Fairy possessed that could stir the entire cultivation world just with one Feast.

“Yeah, the Feast of the Food Immortals is fantastic. After attending, not only does your cultivation increase, but your lifespan also extends, and it boosts your physique and potential. There are all sorts of benefits. And it’s delicious,” Venerable White nodded in agreement.

“Will you attend, Senior White?” Scholar Song asked.

Venerable White shook his head, “I attended once before, but four hundred years ago, after I refused Biexue Fairy’s request to take her as my dual cultivation partner, she never sent me another invitation to the Feast.”

“…” Scholar Song blinked, suddenly feeling that his own upcoming experience at the Feast might not go so smoothly.

…

Scholar Song read through the chat history and then typed a message in the Ninefold Land One group.

**Scholar Song:** “@Fay Yu, Fay, I wasn’t online yesterday. If you’re looking for an adventure spot recently, how about we find somewhere else? Anything but the mysterious island is fine. I have two months off for summer vacation!”

However, Fay Yu wasn’t online and didn’t reply.

Scholar Song then typed again, “@Su Clan Aqi, Aqi, how is Sable Sixteen’s injury now? You left too quickly last time; I didn’t get a chance to ask you.”

Thinking back to the last time, Aqi had put him in a tough spot. Venerable White’s “Sword Transfer Technique” had given him a taste of what “speed and passion” meant, but after that thrilling experience, he had no desire to go through it again.

The first to respond was the Hermit of North River: “Young friend Scholar Song, what happened to Sable Sixteen?”

The Hermit of North River was concerned about Sable Sixteen, but since they had entered the mysterious island over twenty days ago, he was unaware of the incident involving Su Clan Aqi, the Immortal Farmer Sect, the Moon Blade Sect, and Scholar Song.

Before Scholar Song could respond, Su Clan Aqi chimed in: “Haha, don’t worry, Young Friend Scholar Song and North River Brother. Sable Sixteen only sustained some injuries due to the Heavenly Tribulation; she’s doing much better now.”

“Is there anything we can help with?” the Hermit of North River asked.

“Yes,” Su Clan Aqi replied. “If anyone has ‘Dragon Bone Withered Vine,’ please contact me. If we can get that herb, Sable Sixteen’s recovery will go more smoothly.”

“Dragon Bone Withered Vine? That’s quite rare these days,” the Hermit of North River sighed.

The Dragon Bone Withered Vine is a special spiritual material that grows on the bones of a dragon. And by “dragon,” they didn’t mean dinosaurs; they meant real dragons.

However, true dragons are few and far between, and their remains are even rarer. Moreover, dragon corpses do not decompose for a thousand years, making it difficult to wait for them to turn into dragon bones.

“Haha, it’s not that complicated. The ‘Dragon Bone Withered Vine’ that grows on the corpse of a flood dragon will suffice,” Su Clan Aqi replied with a smile.

“If it’s just flood dragon-level ‘Dragon Bone Withered Vine,’ then there might be a chance to acquire it. I’ll ask a few friends I know; they might have some in their collection,” the Hermit of North River responded.

Scholar Song lightly tapped at the keyboard, but couldn’t find a way to join the conversation.

He was just a first-rank cultivator, and he didn’t even know what a ‘Dragon Bone Withered Vine’ looked like, let alone where to find it.

At that moment, a deep sense of helplessness welled up inside him.

If only he were stronger, like the Hermit of North River, maybe he could lend a hand?

“Don’t overthink it. Everyone’s strength is built step by step through cultivation. Don’t get stuck in a dead end; that will only breed inner demons,” Venerable White said, appearing behind him and giving him a gentle pat.

Scholar Song nodded silently.

“Sometimes it helps to read some Taoist scriptures or Buddhist texts. If that doesn’t work, you can also read various religious texts from the West. After all, religious texts help resist inner demons and cultivate a calm mind,” Venerable White chuckled.

“I understand. I really enjoy reading,” Scholar Song replied with a grin. He could spend an entire afternoon engrossed in any book he hadn’t yet read without getting bored.

Looks like he’d be visiting the beautiful proprietress to borrow some books again soon.

In Middle Land, there’s a small temple called Tanyayun Temple.

The temple may be small, but it receives a steady stream of visitors. The overwhelming number of worshippers fills the temple with fragrant smoke, obscuring its internal details.

Beneath this veil of incense, a towering pagoda stands.

Through the entrance of the pagoda, you can glimpse the temple’s true paradise.

Mountains, flowing rivers, countless relic towers, and temples create the real “Tanyayun Temple.”

Tanyayun Temple exists in a unique space between the present world and another dimension, half-hidden from view.

In a large open area within the temple... there is a basketball court, enlarged to ten times the size of a standard basketball court.

On the edge of the court, several blood-red signs hang ominously.

“Using true qi and spiritual energy to play basketball is a dishonorable act! We only use our bodies to play basketball! — Master Tongxuan.”

“The basketball court of Tanyayun Temple: those who use magic to play basketball will be executed without mercy! — Discipline Academy.”

“Those who cheat using magical tools in basketball will be sentenced to scrub pots for ten years. — Miscellaneous Department.”

There were several similar inscriptions, all in dripping red letters.

However, even without using blood energy, true qi, spiritual power, or magic, the basketball court was still a whirlwind of chaos.

At that moment, a tall monk jumped high, soaring an incredible thirty meters into the air, executing a powerful axe-style dunk that brought cheers from the crowd surrounding the court!

Another monk, relying on his powerful physique and skillful footwork, created a series of afterimages, weaving past three defenders and scoring with a graceful layup—though he took strides so long that each step was over two meters.

Just then, a spectator shouted to the monk known as the Three Sun Monk on the court, “Three Sun Brother, the player you told me to watch, ‘Scholar Song,’ has just logged in!”
