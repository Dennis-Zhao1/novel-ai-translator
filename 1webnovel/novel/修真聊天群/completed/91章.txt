**Scholar Song, Admired by His Elders**

"Vitality Pill! That's a pill crafted from extremely precious herbs. Unlike the 'Body Refining Liquid,' which is just a potion, this is a genuine top-tier elixir.

Even the lowest quality version of it can completely restore the vitality of a foundational stage cultivator like Scholar Song within half an hour. He could disregard time limits and practice the 'Diamond Basic Fist Technique' repeatedly in a single day!

This is a pill that can expedite one's foundation establishment—it's incredibly valuable!

After the incident with the forum moderator, Scholar Song became acutely aware of how precious elixirs are in the cultivation world. That long-armed man nearly lost his mind just because the moderator confiscated a bit of his Body Refining Liquid! And this is a true elixir?

Moreover, besides the elixir, there’s an even more valuable cultivation technique to follow!

“It’s impossible not to be tempted,” Scholar Song sighed—yet why did it feel like Elder North River was trying to set him up?

The feeling was so strong that he couldn’t ignore it.

Let me think carefully, which elder in the group would be bored enough to want to learn to drive?

It shouldn’t be one of the regulars who frequently pop up; those who often chime in have already integrated into modern society and wouldn’t need Scholar Song’s help to learn how to drive.

The only ones who fit the bill were the elders who had been in seclusion for hundreds of years, completely clueless about modern society, and who were recently about to emerge.

Which elder in the group is about to break out of seclusion? Scholar Song’s mind sparked with a realization.

“Master White?” he typed into the chat.

Elder North River paused for a moment, a bit embarrassed: “Hahaha, so Scholar Song knows Master White too! Did you see our chat history last time? Just a little hint, and you immediately thought of Master White—you're truly sharp-witted!”

Then Elder North River continued, “Ahem, that’s right! It’s Master White who’s about to come out of seclusion. He has a keen interest in mechanical contraptions. He used to study things like wooden horse-flowing cattle, mechanized dragons, and puppet divine beasts. So whether it’s cars or planes, if he comes out, he’ll definitely want to research these things. This is a golden opportunity; Master White is known for being generous, and a little treasure slipping through his fingers could benefit you immensely! Also, I suggest you learn to get your pilot’s license while you’re at it; it’ll be incredibly beneficial. Don’t worry... if you want to learn to get a pilot’s license, I can hook you up with a way to ensure you obtain it in the shortest time possible.”

Elder North River was rambling on, but his attempts to change the subject were too clumsy and obvious.

Scholar Song pulled the topic back to where he wanted it: “We can talk about the pilot's license later. Elder North River, I just want to ask one question—why do you all seem so afraid of Master White? If I agree to help him come out of seclusion, you should at least give me some mental preparation, right?”

“Scholar Song, you’re mistaken!” Elder North River declared earnestly. “None of us fear Master White! On the contrary, we hold him in the utmost respect. As for why I’m avoiding him, it’s a personal reason that’s hard to articulate. But I assure you, under the name ‘North River,’ Master White is a very kind elder. Although he sometimes appears lost in thought, he is very supportive of the younger generation! His reputation for generosity is well-earned!”

Then what exactly are you afraid of? Scholar Song felt a knot in his throat that wouldn’t go away.

Scholar Song asked again, “Is it the same for Elder Wild Blade of Three Tides? Is it also due to some personal reason that's hard to explain?”

Wild Blade of Three Tides piped up: “Yes, it is also due to some private matters that can’t be explained to outsiders. But I can assure you, Master White is an exemplary elder worthy of our admiration! I can guarantee this under the name ‘Wild Blade of Three Tides!’”

“...To be honest, the more you all say this, the less secure I feel,” Scholar Song admitted.

“…” Elder North River.

“…” Wild Blade of Three Tides.

“However, if Master White is truly as kind as you describe, then I have no reason to decline this task.”

Even if he suspected Elder North River might be setting him up, he had no choice but to brace himself and jump into the pit.

The Vitality Pill—this was a benefit he couldn’t refuse. If he missed this opportunity, it might take him several years of hard work to obtain even a small amount of Vitality Pills.

He wasn’t crazy; why would he pass up the chance to get the Vitality Pill right now and instead wait for years to earn it the hard way?

Elder North River gave a thumbs up: “Scholar Song, I admire your rationality and intelligence!”

Wild Blade of Three Tides quickly followed with a response: “Scholar Song, I also admire you!”

Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram appeared: “Scholar Song, this humble master admires you too!”

Master of Seven Lives: “Scholar Song, I admire you!”

Drunken Moon Scholar: “Same admiration, same admiration!”

The Alchemical Sage: “Admiration!”

The Wandering Monk Tong Xuan appeared, silently sending a thumbs-up emoji.

Mistress Fay Yu appeared, sending a cute smiley face: “Although I’m not clear on what’s happening, I’ve always admired Scholar Song.”

What in the world! Everyone in the group was actually lurking, watching the show, and as soon as he stepped into the trap, they all came out in a row to express their admiration.

Scholar Song felt—he was probably going to be set up badly this time!

He covered his face. Was it too late to back out now? If he changed his mind, would these elders chase him down and beat him to death?

Scholar Song felt the pressure mounting: “Elder North River, what if I want to back out now?”

Elder North River sent a smiling emoji but didn’t say a word.

Wild Blade of Three Tides also added a smile.

Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram added a shy smile.

Master of Seven Lives added a grinning smile.

The group chat in Ninefold Land was filled with rows of bright and dazzling smiley faces.

Scholar Song silently shut off his phone, resolutely deciding not to mention the word ‘back out’ again.

What a misfortune!

…

…

When a person feels they are unlucky, misfortune will indeed come knocking at the door.

Just as Scholar Song put down his phone, it rang again.

“Who’s calling?” Scholar Song opened his phone, only to find the name ‘Zhao Yaya’ glaring back at him on the screen.

“Why is Zhao Yaya calling me at this time? Could it be she wants me to join her for a meal?” He swiped across the screen to answer the call.

“Hey, sis, what’s up?” Scholar Song asked casually.

“Where are you?” Zhao Yaya’s sweet voice came through.

Uh-oh, this situation isn’t good! Zhao Yaya’s tone was sharper than usual, which indicated she was upset.

Could it be that someone teased her at school?

“I’m on the subway back to Jiangnan University Town. I had to step out for something earlier, but I’m on my way back now. I should arrive in about half an hour,” Scholar Song replied.

“You’re back pretty quickly,” Zhao Yaya said flatly. “I heard you went all the way to Guangyuan Road’s Yuanlong Herb Shop to buy some obscure herbs?”

“Hahaha, sis, how did you find out?” Scholar Song wiped the sweat off his forehead.

“I heard it from Yang De,” Zhao Yaya replied.

Yang De, are you okay? Please don’t die on me~~ 

Zhao Yaya’s voice came again: “Be honest with me, Scholar. Is your health really okay?”

“Of course not! I’m perfectly fine; there’s absolutely nothing wrong!” Scholar Song hurriedly replied. “I’m just buying some herbs for a friend, not for myself. And I haven’t even made it to that herb shop yet; I ran into some issues on the way back.”

“Well, that’s good… Call me when you get back to school; I need to talk to you about something.” Zhao Yaya finished, not waiting for Scholar Song to respond before hanging up.

Holding the phone, Zhao Yaya frowned, feeling incredibly anxious.

The first time she encountered Scholar Song’s strange tonics, she could still believe it was just a coincidence. But now that he was once again dealing with odd herbs, how could she not worry?

She recalled how Scholar Song looked when they met that day; he had been pale and unwell, which didn’t match his claims of having exercised vigorously. Even running a marathon wouldn’t leave one looking that pale!

This kid wouldn’t really be hiding an illness from his family, would he?

No, she needed to take him to the hospital for a thorough check-up. If something were to happen to Scholar Song, how would she explain it to her aunt?!

…

…

On the subway.

Scholar Song gripped his phone rigidly, feeling completely stiff.

It’s over; from Zhao Yaya’s tone, she definitely misunderstood!

Scholar Song quickly opened his phone and entered the Ninefold Land group.

“Accidentally let my sister know I just came back from the herb shop, and now she thinks I have a hidden illness. What should I do? Online help needed, it’s urgent!”
