**Reflecting Upon the Self Through Meditation**

With a swift sidestep, he executed a powerful punch, then crouched low to sweep with his leg.

Then came… two hands clasped into fists, striking down.

Basic boxing technique, level six!

By the time Scholar Song completed this step, he was already feeling utterly drained, his body on the verge of collapse from the intense exertion and fatigue.

To be honest, for an ordinary person with no foundation in martial arts, reaching this level on the first try was quite impressive. The Alchemical Sage had predicted that Scholar Song would struggle to make it through the fifth move.

However, Scholar Song appeared to still have some fight left in him!

"That said, the energy from the body-tempering elixir within him is nearly depleted… Well, it’s been over twelve hours since he consumed it. There was hardly any elixir left in his system, so he should run out of energy after completing the fifth move," the Alchemical Sage mused, taking out a small porcelain vial containing the simplified body-tempering elixir that Scholar Song had helped him refine earlier. "If he were to supplement himself with more elixir mid-way, could he last longer? Scholar Song, let’s see the limits of your willpower! If you can complete this set of boxing techniques in one go, the value of my simplified body-tempering elixir will skyrocket!"

Moments later, after Scholar Song completed the ‘Basic Boxing Technique Six’, the Alchemical Sage called out, "Scholar Song, open your mouth!"

With his mind already foggy from exhaustion, Scholar Song instinctively opened his mouth.

A small blob of black liquid was shot from the Alchemical Sage’s hand, landing right in his mouth.

Instantly, he felt an explosion of pain and heat in his throat!

Followed by that, the explosive elixir transformed into a wave of warmth that slid down into his abdomen, filling him with a cozy, almost overwhelming sensation.

Body-tempering elixir? Scholar Song quickly realized.

The fresh medicinal energy surged through his body, erupting forth. The immense power felt as if it could burst from his skin at any moment, yet it also provided him with boundless vigor.

With the abundant energy propelling him, he executed Basic Boxing Technique Seven effortlessly.

Then came Basic Boxing Technique Eight and Nine!

Like a force of nature.

The swelling energy prompted a low, almost primal growl to escape Scholar Song's lips, a sound he couldn’t suppress.

With a deep, powerful voice, he recited the boxing sutras, moving in sync with his intentions, every strike flowing seamlessly.

Each technique pushed Scholar Song further into exhaustion, but he knew that as long as he could push through, the body-tempering elixir would replenish his strength and ease his fatigue.

"Keep going! You must hold on until you finish the entire set of ‘Diamond Basic Boxing Techniques’!"

That single thought consumed Scholar Song’s mind.

Finally… he completed all eighteen moves of the ‘Diamond Basic Boxing Techniques’!

Within him, his vital energy surged.

His body flushed with heat, the vibrant energy feeling as if it were about to burst forth from every pore.

He had done it! With his fists clenched tightly, Scholar Song suppressed the urge to howl at the sky—after all, this was the rooftop of the boys' dormitory, and a loud outburst would surely attract unwanted attention.

A satisfied smile crept onto the Alchemical Sage’s face.

He had truly managed to complete the ‘Diamond Basic Boxing Techniques’ from start to finish—what an unexpected achievement!

"Excellent! Now, while your vital energy is still surging and hasn’t cooled down, sit cross-legged immediately and practice the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’!" he urged Scholar Song.

In the realm of cultivation, meditation techniques were as numerous as the stars in the sky.

However, all meditation techniques fundamentally aimed to concentrate one’s spirit to cultivate a thread of spiritual energy.

Spiritual energy, combined with the energy within one’s body, forms the bedrock of a cultivator's power.

In a normal state, the human body’s vital energy is not subject to conscious control. Only through highly concentrated spiritual energy can one guide the flow of vital energy within in simple movements.

Moreover, as one’s vital energy evolves into true qi or even higher-level energy, it requires a corresponding level of spiritual energy for guidance and control.

If a cultivator’s spiritual energy lags behind their cultivation level, they risk losing control and succumbing to demonic temptations. This is why cultivators frequently engage in closed-door meditation and worldly experiences to enhance their spiritual capabilities.

Furthermore, the type of spiritual energy one cultivates varies according to the meditation technique. Some have spiritual energy that resembles dark stillness, others possess the fierce might of tigers and lions, while some exhibit the calmness of ancient trees. These differences arise from the varied meditation methods.

The ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’ utilizes meditation to visualize the ‘True Self’ in one’s mind, dispelling all distractions and allowing the spirit to condense into a pure form of spiritual energy.

Scholar Song took a deep breath, calming the restlessness within him, and settled into position for the final step.

Reciting the contents of the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’, he began to visualize the essence of his ‘True Self’ in his mind.

Though the Diamond Temple belonged to the Buddhist sect, the ‘True Self’ mentioned in this sutra differed from the ‘Eight Great Freedoms’ discussed in Buddhism.

Here, the ‘True Self’ simply refers to the genuine self—meditation serves to consolidate the authentic you in the mind.

This ‘True Self’ isn’t static; it evolves with a cultivator's age, life experiences, techniques practiced, and changes in identity.

It may manifest as an ordinary child, a white-clad swordsman, a fierce blade master, a benevolent elder, or even as a mundane person, and, in some cases, it might take the shape of a bloodthirsty demon due to hatred and resentment. Each period of a cultivator’s life can yield a different representation of the ‘True Self’ in the meditation.

Compared to other meditation techniques, the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’ lacks the ferocity of a tiger or lion, the serenity of ancient trees, or the vast stillness of the starry sky. Yet, it stands as the most suitable meditation for one’s ‘self’ because it embodies the ‘True Self’.

"So, who will I, Scholar Song, become?" he pondered inwardly.

Would my ‘True Self’ take the form of a legendary hero I once yearned to be?

Or perhaps, having entered this world of cultivation, my ‘True Self’ would manifest as a cultivator surrounded by celestial energy?

Surely, I won't become a demonic figure or anything like that? I've lived a rather ordinary life, without any grudges or enemies…

At the very least, I hope I’ll look good!

With such thoughts swirling in his mind, as he finished reciting the contents of the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’, Scholar Song felt a wave of clarity wash over him.

A figure began to take shape in his mind, or rather, in the depths of his consciousness.

First came the crossed legs, followed by arms, then his torso, and rising upward…

It was like a 3D printer constructing a human form within his mind.

What kind of ‘me’ will this be?

Scholar Song felt a surge of anticipation.

Through meditation, he would behold his true self, unveiling the essence of who he really was!

In the depth of his eager anticipation, the ‘True Self’ took shape within his mind.

How to describe it?

Surprisingly ordinary!

The ‘True Self’ looked exactly like Scholar Song, dressed in a simple short-sleeved shirt and black casual pants, seated cross-legged with a gentle smile on his face.

Reflecting upon the ‘True Self’.

This remarkably ordinary ‘True Self’ seemed more fitting for an everyday person. Was it a message telling me that I’m still just an ordinary mortal?

There was no time for further contemplation. The moment the ‘True Self’ materialized, all of Scholar Song's distractions vanished, and his spirit became highly concentrated. With the aid of the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’, he birthed the first pure thread of spiritual energy.

As his spiritual energy formed, Scholar Song swiftly followed the guidance from the meditation method, directing the overflowing vital energy within him.

He guided it towards his ‘Heart Aperture’.

The Heart Aperture is where the heart resides. However, it isn’t the heart itself but rather a cavity located where the heart is. It cannot be touched; even if one were to dissect the body, they wouldn’t find the ‘Heart Aperture’. Yet, it undeniably exists!

Scholar Song's overflowing vital energy was significant, and under the guidance of the spirit birthed from his ‘True Self’, the excess energy surged towards the Heart Aperture from all directions.

As this process unfolded, the intense heat in his body gradually faded. It felt akin to stepping out of the blistering summer sun and into the refreshing coolness of an air-conditioned room, an indescribable relief.

He lost track of time, but eventually, with the ‘True Self’ guiding him, the overflowing vital energy had fully integrated into the Heart Aperture. At that moment, Scholar Song felt a gentle warmth at the center of his chest with a strong heartbeat.

Hmm, judging by the sound, it should be a very healthy heart. Scholar Song nodded; no heart disease—quite good indeed.
