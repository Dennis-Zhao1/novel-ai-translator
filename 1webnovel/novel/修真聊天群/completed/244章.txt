**Car God Old Lu: My Back! (1st Update, Monthly Tickets Requested)**

The mountain road of Niu Ding Mountain has been transformed into an exceptionally wide path, seemingly built purely for the purpose of "safe street racing." So, even a tractor zooming along at 150 kilometers per hour, as long as one is careful and doesn’t act recklessly, can speed along this mountain path without any issues.

Now, all Scholar Song could do was hope that Old Lu wouldn’t do anything reckless while driving! He couldn’t shake off a nagging worry—after all, Old Lu had had quite a bit to drink.

The thought of someone who had been drinking, driving a tractor at 150 kilometers per hour, was terrifying.

……

On the winding road of Niu Ding Mountain, the tractor was still far ahead of the three sports cars trailing behind.

At that moment, Old Lu’s excited voice boomed from the front of the tractor, “Old Song, did we just overtake three sports cars?”

His tone was filled with disbelief.

“Uh-huh.” Scholar Song’s dad answered stiffly, his mind racing with one question—where on earth did Scholar Song get this tractor? A tractor going over a hundred kilometers per hour? What a joke! This was a tractor, not a sports car!

“Overtaking three sports cars and still going over 120 kilometers per hour! Hahahaha!” Old Lu laughed maniacally.

Hearing that laugh, Lu Tianyou in the back of the tractor suddenly felt a sense of unease—a premonition. His dad often laughed like that when something was about to go terribly wrong. It usually fell into two categories:

1. When Scholar Song had come to poke at his dad’s sore spots, and after Scholar Song left, his dad would laugh nervously for a long time. This type fell under the category of "anger turned to laughter."

2. When his dad had managed to poke at Scholar Song’s weaknesses, he would come home and laugh like this for ages—this was the type of laughter that came from sheer delight.

But regardless of the reason, whenever his dad let out that peculiar laugh, it signaled that his mind was about to go haywire.

Sure enough, after laughing, Old Lu sighed deeply, “Turns out I’m already drunk!”

What kind of situation could a tractor go over a hundred kilometers per hour? What kind of scenario could a tractor overtake three sports cars? It only happened in dreams! Or when someone was drunk and hallucinating!

At that moment, Old Lu seriously began to question whether he was completely out of it.

Hearing his dad’s words, Lu Tianyou tensed up, “Dad, stay focused! Drive steadily; Scholar Song and I are still behind you!”

“Don’t worry, even if I’m drunk, driving a tractor is still my forte!” Old Lu chuckled, his body swaying with the tractor's vibrations. “Old Song, let’s have some fun!”

Then, Old Lu began to belt out a song, “The big river… flows eastward! The stars in the sky… mix with the Big Dipper! Old Song, your turn to sing! Let’s get hyped!”

“Get real!” Scholar Song’s dad roared back, “Just drive the tractor properly; keep your eyes on the road and don’t mess around!”

“You’re such a buzzkill, Old Song! At a time like this, we should be singing together, trading verses back and forth! It’ll be so lively!” Old Lu shook his head and swayed…

As he swayed, he felt himself truly starting to feel the effects of the alcohol. His mind was still clear, but his reactions were a beat slower than before. 

Nevertheless, Old Lu shook his head vigorously, forcing himself to continue, “Fine, if you won’t sing, I’ll sing by myself—let’s go, we’re all in this together! When you see injustice, you shout out—wah wah wah wah wah…”

He wasn’t actually losing the lyrics… He’d been singing this song for half his life—he knew it by heart and could sing it without thinking.

The problem was, just ahead, a sharp U-turn appeared, the kind with a massive bend!

This caused Old Lu’s song to turn into a scream of alarm.

Scholar Song’s dad saw the sharp turn too, “Steady, Old Lu! Slow down the tractor! Now!”

“I’ve already been braking, but it’s not slowing down fast enough! We were going too fast before!” Old Lu shouted as he desperately fought to turn the tractor right, trying to navigate the U-turn.

Due to the tension, he instinctively twisted his back to lean toward the right, trying to steer the vehicle.

As the tractor’s front inched closer to the curve, Scholar Song’s dad finally let out a sigh of relief.

But just then, Old Lu let out a horrified scream, “Oh my God, my back! I threw it out!”

Although Old Lu still looked as strong as a bear, he didn’t have the same resilience as he did in his younger days. In his excitement to turn, he had twisted his back too sharply and had injured himself!

The sudden pain shot through him, almost causing him to lose control of the tractor.

At that moment, the angle of the tractor's turn shifted slightly… Just a tiny shift, but they were still barreling down the mountain at 150 kilometers per hour!

With that immense speed, even a minor deviation could lead to catastrophic consequences!

In the back, Scholar Song’s dad yelled, “Watch out! Hold on tight, we’re going to hit the guardrail!”

“Damn it! If it weren’t for my back, I could handle this U-turn easily!” Old Lu roared, and in the next moment, he gritted his teeth against the pain and stomped on the brakes to regain control of the tractor!

True to form, the seasoned driver of twenty years managed to jam the speeding tractor into the U-turn!

As the front of the tractor entered the curve, the two rear wheels of the trailer almost lifted off the ground, propelled by the force of inertia, getting “flung” into the U-turn!

If it weren’t for Venerable White having reinforced the tractor’s body, this strong tailspin could have easily caused the trailer to snap off or get flung away!

But now, thanks to the reinforcement and the formation's protective effects, the trailer simply made a screeching noise and remained intact. Even the massive boulders, small boxes, Scholar Song’s dad, and Lu Tianyou inside were all protected by the formation’s power, only rocking violently before settling back to a basic level of stability.

They successfully navigated the first U-turn!

Everyone in the tractor let out a silent sigh of relief.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Behind them, three racing girls had been tailing the tractor closely.

They had just witnessed the tractor’s spectacular “drift” into the U-turn.

How should they describe it? Handsome? This was truly a display of car god-level driving skills!

“Yaya, that Uncle Lu you were talking about really has amazing driving skills! Just now, even though he slowed down a bit, he must have been going at least 120 kilometers per hour, right? That drift into the turn was so cool! No doubt he’s a car god!” Xiaomai Sui exclaimed through her earpiece to Zhao Yaya.

“A tractor doing a drift? I just saw the rear trailer nearly go airborne, actually getting ‘flung’ into the U-turn! Is your dashcam recording? Did it capture that amazing drift?” The fashionable girl, Arthur, asked excitedly.

“I think mine is on, but it’s a bit far. I’m not sure how clear the footage is,” Zhao Yaya replied, clicking her tongue.

—Experts in the ordinary?

Uncle Lu, driving a modified tractor at over 150 kilometers per hour, pulling off such a beautiful drift, was truly a master. Should they consider asking Uncle Lu for driving tips later? After all, she remembered Uncle Lu used to be a driving school instructor.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile, the “car god” Old Lu, who looked so impressive to the girls, had a pale face, his back throbbing with pain.

Seeing Old Lu’s pallor, Scholar Song’s dad quickly said, “Old Lu, don’t push yourself! Pull over and let someone else drive!”

Lu Tianyou beside him forced a smile, “Uncle Song, I can’t drive a tractor!”—He thought Scholar Song’s dad wanted him to take the wheel.

“It’s fine, I can drive. Old Lu, just pull over!” Scholar Song’s dad urged.

Don’t let his seemingly frail demeanor fool you; he had endured hardships in his youth, and his tractor driving skills were no worse than Old Lu’s!

“I’ve been braking all this time, but the speed was too high before, and it’s taking forever to slow down. Ah, it hurts so much! Let me just bring down the gears… Ahhhhh!” Old Lu was halfway through when he suddenly screamed again!

Ahead of them lay another large U-turn.

And it was even steeper and sharper than the last one!

Moreover, this U-turn was flanked by a steep rock face on one side and a five-meter-deep drop on the other.

Not just a single drop, but multiple layers of steep cliffs, forming a terraced slope, each layer a good four to five meters deep, all the way down to the foot of the mountain.

On either side were dangerous hazards; crashing into the rock or flipping off the cliff could easily lead to death.

And yet, the speed just wouldn’t go down! Old Lu’s gut was twisting with anxiety.

At that moment, Scholar Song’s dad calmly said, “Old Lu, hold on. Let’s get through this turn, then we’ll switch drivers!”

“Ugh, this hurts! I’ll just have to go for it; what’s just another turn? If I can handle one, I can handle two! Watch me!” Old Lu shouted defiantly.

He gritted his teeth against the excruciating pain in his back and started controlling the tractor to maneuver into the sharp U-turn!

If he could just get through this turn, they’d be safe! He could handle it, it was just a turn!

Ah, time is a knife, always reminding people of their age. He couldn’t deny it anymore; his back was protesting loudly.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At that moment… the three racing girls were still trying their hardest to keep up with the tractor.

“Wow, up ahead is a series of sharp S-turns! Both turns are huge! Let’s catch up and see how the car god tackles these S-turns. I really want to see his continuous drifts!” Xiaomai Sui exclaimed, glancing at her car’s navigation excitedly.

“Xiaomai Sui, don’t get too ahead of yourself! You’re not a car god; slow down and take the turns steadily!” fashionable girl Arthur quickly warned.

“Don’t worry, I won’t let my guard down,” Xiaomai Sui chuckled.

……

S-turns were incredibly challenging; they were composed of two huge U-turns connected together.

It made one wonder if Old Lu’s back could hold up through this!
