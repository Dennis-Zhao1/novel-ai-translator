**New Grudges and Old Hatreds**

In the Boundless Demon Sect, atop Mo Hou Peak, within the cave dwelling of Young Master Hai.

Young Master Hai stood once again at the edge of the cliff, his aura becoming even more ethereal. 

Moments later, the fragmented soul of the Demon Lord An Zhi appeared quietly beside him.

Before long, Zheng Neng floated over, swaying gently on a bamboo sword.

All three of them exhibited significant changes in their respective auras, each on the verge of a breakthrough.

An Zhi, with a strange grin, spoke up, “Captain Jing Mo suffered a loss at the hands of ‘Shushan Pressure,’ one of his subordinates was killed by that ‘Shushan Pressure.’ Hehe~~”

“That’s not surprising. If ‘Shushan Pressure’ were really that easy to deal with, I would have acted long ago,” Young Master Hai replied with a light chuckle. “Is there a powerful figure by ‘Shushan Pressure’s side?”

“Yes, I dare not approach closely even with my split soul, but I can confirm that there is a powerful cultivator living with ‘Shushan Pressure.’ It seems that retrieving the Blood God Jewel won’t be easy in the short term,” An Zhi responded.

Young Master Hai sighed inwardly.

At that moment, Zheng Neng smiled slightly and said, “I think you should be more worried about another issue—what if ‘Shushan Pressure’ gives the ‘Blood God Jewel’ to the senior he’s with?”

“Hehe, if that happens, it’ll be interesting. You’d be the one at a disadvantage, Young Master Hai,” An Zhi teased with a wicked smile.

“That’s exactly what I’m worried about,” Young Master Hai replied with a faint smile. “Fortunately, that Blood God Jewel was part of the surplus budget we gained after improving the formation. The three Blood God Jewels we have on hand are enough for now.”

However, Young Master Hai’s tone shifted. “But that extra Blood God Jewel can very slightly increase the number of ‘Dan Pattern Dragon Tails,’ so we must find a way to get it back!”

Mentioning the Dan Pattern Dragon Tail caused both Zheng Neng and An Zhi to straighten up.

“If it really comes to it, we can perform another blood sacrifice?” An Zhi suggested.

“We don’t have that kind of time… Where can we find another ‘Moon Blade Sect’ to sacrifice in the short term?” Young Master Hai replied. “So, An Zhi, I’ll need you to keep an eye on ‘Shushan Pressure’ with your split soul. As long as there’s a chance, we have to retrieve the Blood God Jewel.”

“Understood, our time is limited,” An Zhi affirmed.

“Good luck,” Zheng Neng said softly.

The three exchanged glances and then dispersed.

Just before leaving, An Zhi suddenly said to Zheng Neng, “By the way, Brother Zheng Neng, let me give you a piece of free information. The Immortal Farming Sect is doing well, protected by Su Shi A Qi. No nearby troublemakers dare to lay a hand on it. Hehe~ It seems that once they get past this crisis, they will slowly regain their vitality, right?”

“What does the Immortal Farming Sect have to do with me now?” Zheng Neng turned around to retort, his expression calm, as if everything about the Immortal Farming Sect no longer concerned him.

Having said that, Zheng Neng sat on his flying sword and vanished into the sea of clouds.

“Tsk tsk.” An Zhi, feeling a bit embarrassed, transformed into demonic smoke and also dispersed.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Time flew by, and it was now six in the evening.

“Venerable White, I’m heading out now!” Song Shuhang waved goodbye to Venerable White.

After returning successfully at noon, Tu Bo called to ask if he wanted to study together at Yang De’s rented place that evening. Thinking he had no plans for the night, Song Shuhang agreed.

At the same time, he brought along a small packet of ‘Spirit Pulse Green Tea.’ He had asked Venerable White, and this tea could be consumed by ordinary people, boasting the ability to nourish the mind and improve physique.

However, the dosage had to be small; for an ordinary young person, using two leaves per serving was sufficient.

Song Shuhang planned to bring some for his roommates to try, hoping to give them a boost before the exams. After the summer break, he also wanted to take some back for his close family to taste. He just needed to be careful not to let too many people know about the ‘Spirit Pulse Green Tea,’ to avoid unnecessary troubles.

As he took out the Spirit Pulse Green Tea, Song Shuhang couldn’t help but think of Su Shi A Sixteen… I wonder how that girl is doing now? Has her injury healed?

It had been quite a while since she last appeared in the Ninefold Land No. 1 group. Senior A Qi was also busy dealing with the people from the Boundless Demon Sect and hadn’t mentioned how A Sixteen’s condition was.

I hope she’s safe and manages to get through this ordeal. Song Shuhang silently wished.

At that moment, Dou Dou asked, “Do you need me to tag along?”

“No, it’s fine. The place my roommates rented is very close, just a short distance away,” Song Shuhang replied with a smile.

With the distance being so short, even if something happened, Venerable White and Dou Dou could come to their aid at any moment.

“Be careful on the way, and stay safe~” Venerable White smiled as he sent Song Shuhang off—once Shuhang left, he could continue with the renovations in his room.

After all, whether it’s tearing down one or two, it’s all the same. Once the entire family renovation was complete, there would be no problem!

Earlier that day, he had even opened a bank account. He was just waiting for the Master of Snow Wolf Cavern to transfer the funds, and then he would go buy new furniture.

……

……

At Li Yang De’s residence.

After entering, Song Shuhang glanced around and noticed only Yang De and Tu Bo were present. He asked, “Is Gao Mou Mou not here?”

“He’s still with his girlfriend; he won’t be coming tonight. That guy, forgetting his loyalty to friends for the sake of romance, you’re the better one, Shuhang. You just need to make a call, and you’re here,” Tu Bo complained.

“Ha ha.” Song Shuhang placed the snacks he brought along on the table. “Yang De, do you have any tea cups?”

“There are some in the kitchen; did you bring something to drink?” Li Yang De stepped out from the room, looking visibly exhausted. It seemed he had stayed up all night again.

“A friend brought me some good tea; I thought I’d let you guys try it,” Song Shuhang said, searching through the kitchen. He found three tea cups that were similar to single-use cups and brewed three pots of hot tea, putting two leaves of ‘Spirit Pulse Green Tea’ in each cup.

“What kind of tea is this? Let me see.” Tu Bo leaned over, only to find there were just two leaves floating alone in the hot water.

Tu Bo couldn’t help but laugh and cry at the same time, “I say, Shuhang… this is too stingy, right? Two leaves in a cup of tea? Even if this is Wuyi Da Hong Pao, you don’t have to go so stingy, right?”

“Hehe, don’t say too much. Just drink and you’ll know,” Song Shuhang chuckled. “If you don’t like it, then don’t drink it. I can’t bear to waste it on you.”

Tu Bo knew Song Shuhang’s personality; since he wasn’t being stingy, then this tea must have some special effect.

He skeptically blew on it and took a small sip.

Though it was hot tea, once it entered his mouth, he felt a cool sensation sliding down his throat and into his abdomen, as if his entire being was being cleansed from the inside out, extremely comfortable. Not only that, the fragrance of the tea lingered, leaving a lasting aftertaste.

With his eyes closed in pleasure, Tu Bo took a moment before exclaiming, “Refreshing!”

“Is it that exaggerated?” Yang De watched as Tu Bo wore an expression of ecstasy before grabbing the tea cup and taking a small sip himself.

He didn’t find it quite as intense as Tu Bo, but upon swallowing, he felt instantly refreshed, all the fatigue accumulated from staying up late the previous night vanished without a trace!

“What kind of tea is this?” Li Yang De felt that this tea was simply extraordinary. He had never heard of any tea with such effects!

“It’s something a friend brought me; the name is a bit silly, so I won’t say. But this is an extremely rare good thing that ordinary people can’t even drink,” Song Shuhang replied with a smile, lifting his own cup to take a gentle sip.

While it didn’t have the miraculous effects of body refining liquid or blood-boosting pills, the Spirit Pulse Green Tea contained very little spiritual energy, yet its aroma was rich and lingered long. Coupled with its relatively affordable price, it was no wonder it was a favorite among cultivators… though to this day, he still had no idea how much ‘Spirit Pulse Green Tea’ was actually worth.

“That Gao guy missing out on this is a big loss,” Tu Bo laughed heartily, feeling invigorated, making studying much easier. This time, he absolutely wouldn’t fail the exam!

“I’ll save some tea leaves for you guys. But be careful, maximum two leaves per cup. If you use more, it’ll harm your body. Just one cup a day, don’t overdo it. I don’t want to be responsible for harming you!” Song Shuhang said with a smile as he sat down to study with Tu Bo and Yang De.

“There are so many restrictions?” Tu Bo cradled his tea cup, suddenly feeling reluctant to take a sip. One cup a day was all he got!

Li Yang De held his tea cup, deep in thought.

Song Shuhang flipped through his textbooks, actually already quite familiar with the knowledge points on them. The key topics the teacher covered were all firmly in his mind; calling it a review… there really wasn’t much to review.

Being a cultivator is really great! Song Shuhang sighed inwardly, at least his memory was outstanding, his thoughts clear, and learning was incredibly efficient.

“By the way, Shuhang, do you have free time after the exams?” Tu Bo raised his head and asked.

“I do.” Song Shuhang smiled and asked, “Are you planning on helping Zhuge Zhongyang to woo Lu Fei’s sister?”

“No, Zhuge Zhongyang’s arrangement is for mid-summer vacation, right? I mean, after the exams, don’t rush to go home, okay? My grandfather wants to invite you to his place as a guest.” Tu Bo said with a grin.

“Your grandfather? The one from the neighboring city, in the Luo Xin district?” Song Shuhang replied—what a coincidence, he was planning to go there too. But why would Tu Bo’s grandfather think to invite him over?

Song Shuhang remembered Tu Bo’s grandfather as a very talkative and fashionable old man who believed in science and rejected superstition.

“Yes, that’s right. My grandfather called me earlier, saying some strange things have been happening in the village recently, and he’s been feeling uneasy. For some reason, he thought of you and asked me to invite you over. But he didn’t tell me what’s been happening. Old people are so weird, always finding ways to bother their grandchildren… But hey, the mulberries in my grandfather’s place are ripe and ready for harvest now; he planted quite a few. We can go pick mulberries together,” Tu Bo laughed.

“Sounds good, just let me know when you’re going back, and I’ll join you,” Song Shuhang agreed.

Tu Bo’s grandfather mentioned strange occurrences in the village, and Song Shuhang immediately thought of the ‘Forum Master’s’ subordinates. The Forum Master’s organization was located near the Luo Xin district of the neighboring city.

If something strange really happened, it was highly likely that they were behind it!

If that were the case, it was a matter of old grudges and new hatreds all bundled together!
