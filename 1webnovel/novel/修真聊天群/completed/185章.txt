### Their Fighting Styles!

One hand alone can’t create a sound, but when it comes to beating someone up, one punch is more than enough!

“Little White, watch the blade!” The young man in the blue shirt flashed a bright, sunny smile, completely unconcerned with whether Scholar Song was holding a knife. He gripped his own knife with both hands, leaped into the air, and came crashing down with a powerful slash aimed right at Scholar Song’s head.

This attack was clearly intended to slice Scholar Song in half from head to toe.

“Damn it!” Scholar Song rolled away lazily, narrowly dodging the deadly strike.

What grudge do you have against me? Why jump straight to violence the moment we meet?

A gentleman uses words, not fists. Can’t we have a polite conversation first?

Besides, when it comes to unarmed combat, Scholar Song at least had a set of the “Basic Diamond Fist Technique” to back him up. But with blades? He only had that one fiery knife technique taught by the rogue cultivator Li Tiansu in a dream. And even that technique was something he hadn’t mastered yet… relying on the ancient bronze ring he wore to execute it completely.

He had no foundation in swordsmanship whatsoever. Even if he picked up a knife, he could only swing it around randomly.

Random hacking might work against amateurs, but against a master swordsman… who knows how effective it would be?

“Little White, take the knife!” The young man in the blue shirt shouted, kicking a treasure knife from the ground right towards Scholar Song.

With no choice, Scholar Song caught the knife.

Gritting his teeth inwardly, he thought, you brought this upon yourself! Let’s see how you fare against my ‘Fire Blade’!

Once Scholar Song gripped the knife, the young man in blue chuckled and lunged at him again with another strike. This time, the slash left behind three indistinct afterimages. It was both slow and impossibly fast at the same time!

Facing such an opponent, one would feel incredibly suffocated.

Scholar Song’s gaze steadied. No matter how extraordinary that slash was, he focused on recalling the “Burning Heaven Blade” that ‘Chixiaozi’ had demonstrated in his dream. With a flick of his wrist, he swung the knife! Simultaneously, he activated the attack array of the ‘Fire Blade’ on his ancient bronze ring.

Woosh—flames erupted from the knife in his hand, and regardless of the young man’s incoming strike, Scholar Song’s fiery blade cut towards him—one blade against another, but his was engulfed in flames. Let’s see who feels the burn more!

“Ha ha, good move!” The young man in blue laughed, no longer using his flashy techniques. Instead, he swiftly jabbed the tip of his sword, quick as lightning, right against the handle of Scholar Song’s knife.

Clang…

Scholar Song felt a jolt in his grip, and suddenly, he couldn’t hold onto the knife anymore. It fell to the ground, extinguishing the flames that had been burning brightly.

“Not good, Little White!”

“You can’t grip a knife like that!” Instead of pressing the advantage, the young man began demonstrating in front of Scholar Song.

He showed how to hold the knife correctly so that one wouldn’t lose it, how to control the force of a slash to maximize its lethality, and which angles were the most effective and deadly… a whole series of advice.

If this were a game, Scholar Song imagined there would be a notification sound echoing in his head.

Ding! System notification: Congratulations, player ‘Scholar Song’ has received foundational knife techniques from the Master of Swordplay. You've learned Basic Knife Techniques.

Ding! Player ‘Scholar Song’ gains +1 experience in Basic Knife Techniques, and an additional +1…

That would probably be the kind of message he’d get.

“Come on, Little White, let’s try again!” The young man in blue said with a smile, picking up the treasure knife from the ground and tossing it back to Scholar Song.

Scholar Song's eyes lit up as he looked at the young man. 

Suddenly, a lot of thoughts crossed his mind, and he began to piece things together… perhaps he hadn’t been transported to another world after all!

But those thoughts didn’t matter now.

With the young man’s guidance, he at least knew how to use the knife at a basic level now. Grasping the treasure knife confidently, Scholar Song charged toward the young man!

The two of them clashed, exchanging blows in a flurry of sounds—bang, bang, bang!

Scholar Song’s understanding of knife techniques grew deeper, quickly absorbing what the young man had explained, transforming it into his own experience.

He even began applying some insights from his fist techniques to his knife techniques, executing a series of rapid slashes akin to his ‘Basic Fist Technique’. In an instant, he unleashed dozens of strikes. However, he left himself wide open, resembling a reckless fighter.

After about half an hour…

Scholar Song found himself sprawled on the ground again, unable to get back up.

Even though he learned how to use the knife, he was still just a rookie, and it was perfectly normal for him to be defeated by the young man in blue…

This time was even worse than before; his clothes were shredded by the knife’s aura, and his body bore numerous cuts. If he went out looking like this, he could easily rake in a couple of hundred bucks just by sitting on a street corner—people would spare him a glance, unable to look away from his pitiful sight.

“Hey, Little White, we’ll wrap it up for today. I’ll come back tomorrow to play!” The young man in blue laughed, repeating those familiar words.

Then he hopped back on his horse. As the sound of jingling bells rang out, the young man soon disappeared from Scholar Song’s view once again.

This time, Scholar Song didn’t even have the strength to shout, lying on the ground to catch his breath and regain his strength.

Once the young man had gone far enough, Scholar Song grumbled under his breath, “Damn it, don’t let me see you again, or I’ll settle the score with you.”

Just as he finished speaking, a delightful jingling sound came from afar—another young man in blue, leading a white horse, was approaching him quickly.

What the hell? It’s too fast! I’m still lying here recovering; can’t I at least get back to full health first?

I regret it! Is that okay? I don’t want to see you!

Where’s Doudou? Where’s Doudou? Help me out here~

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Where is Doudou right now?

At this moment, it lay helplessly in the desert.

Just like the desert where Scholar Song was, all it could see for miles was a stretch of sand, barren and lifeless—no grass, and not even a cockroach in sight.

Nearby, a young man in blue leading a white horse was approaching him.

“Little White, where did you run off to? I thought you’d gotten lost!” The young man exclaimed cheerfully as he ran over to Doudou, flashing a bright smile.

“Are we not done yet?” Doudou silently rolled its eyes.

The young man led the horse to the side, then shouted at Doudou, “Little White, shall we practice knife techniques?”

As he spoke, he unsheathed two identical long knives from the horse’s saddle, tossing one toward Doudou.

Doudou rolled its eyes again, letting the knife land beside it.

Doudou didn’t pick up the knife, but the young man didn’t mind. He gripped his knife and charged at Doudou.

With a mighty strike, he brought the blade down onto Doudou.

Clang! The knife collided with Doudou’s body, sending bright sparks flying. Though the young man’s swordsmanship was impressive, his strength was lacking, and he couldn’t break through Doudou’s defense.

Doudou sighed, closed its eyes, and flipped its ears down to cover them.

Undeterred, the young man continued striking, the sound of metal clashing ringing out as he kept hacking away at Doudou.

After a full half-hour of relentless attacks, the young man finally laughed brightly, “Hey, Little White, we’ll stop here today! I’ll come back tomorrow to play!”

Then he hopped back on his horse. With the jingling bells ringing as he rode off, the young man vanished from Doudou’s sight.

Doudou sighed again and pulled out a computer from beneath itself.

The time displayed was already eight o’clock in the evening.

On the screen, it could still see itself battling a boss in the game, with its in-game wife and a video chat window still open beside it.

“Surely my character in the game must have died by now. I hope my new ‘Overlord Set’ doesn’t break!” Doudou’s eyes glimmered with unshed tears. It had spent all night grinding for that set and had just equipped it to show off to its wife…

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In another endless desert, barren and silent.

The venerable Master Bai was quietly… meditating with his eyes closed.

He was engaged in his daily cultivation practice.

In the past, people in the group used to call him the “Cultivation Maniac, Venerable Bai,” because cultivating was his favorite pastime. Whenever he had even a moment of free time, he would dedicate himself to rigorous training.
