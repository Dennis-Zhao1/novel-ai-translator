**Another Urgent Air Delivery**

“I do know a few things, but they’re from forty years ago,” the master of Seven Lives Talisman explained softly. “Forty-three years ago, I was wandering all over the world. During that time, I passed through a village in the eastern region of the Middle Land. At that time, the entire village was brutally blood-sacrificed—every single person was killed without exception. The purpose was to artificially create resentment and gather vengeful spirits. This was a method used by those practicing the evil path of ghost cultivation.”

“I was enraged at the time, and I swore an oath that I would eradicate those evil ghost cultivators down to the roots. Afterward, I tracked them for a long while, but sadly, I only managed to eliminate a few insignificant subordinates of the ghost cultivators. However, from them, I discovered the paw mark beast's head insignia.”

The master of Seven Lives Talisman had been a man with a strong sense of justice in his youth—overly so, in fact. He had a fiery temperament and loved to make grand vows whenever he encountered injustice. Just like with the incident of the ghost cultivators slaughtering the village, he swore an oath before heaven and earth to eradicate those who created vengeful spirits.

He had made nearly a thousand such vows in his youth. Now, he had a little notebook specifically for recording all the vows he made back then. 

For cultivators, vows are sacred and cannot be taken lightly. Once made, one must find a way to fulfill them, or else their heart will never feel complete, and they may face inner demons when trying to advance in cultivation.

Now, the master of Seven Lives Talisman was in tears, trying his best to fulfill all the vows he made in his youth. Despite feeling that he was working diligently to accomplish them, the number of vows in his little notebook seemed unending.

There was a time when the master of Seven Lives Talisman desperately wished for the ability to traverse time. He wanted to go back and give his younger self a solid slap to wake him up, ensuring that the reckless youth wouldn’t add burdens to his future self!

Returning to the topic at hand, he asked, “I heard from Brother Alchemist that you now have leads on the ghost cultivators with the paw mark beast head insignia?”

“I have a small lead, thanks in part to the help of Senior Alchemist. If all goes well, I should be able to find the approximate location of the leader of this organization within the next few days,” Scholar Song replied. The information about the leader had come from the long-armed man the night before.

“Excellent! These evil ghost cultivators deserve to be exterminated. It’s a pity I’m currently in the western region of the Middle Land, tied up with other matters, and cannot lend you my aid,” the master of Seven Lives Talisman said, looking somewhat gloomy. “So, my young friend, please send me your delivery address. Tomorrow, I will express mail you a few talismans; I hope they can help you.”

Talismans! Scholar Song immediately thought of the golden talisman paper that Fay Yu had used to defeat the Phantom Spirits. 

“Lastly, don’t forget that your nickname is the face of a cultivator. Your nickname is rather awkward and doesn’t roll off the tongue easily. It would be best to change it to something else! Remember to send me an address that can receive the package, and I’ll send it right away.” With that, the master of Seven Lives Talisman quickly hung up the phone, fearing that Scholar Song might reject his kind offer.

“……” Scholar Song.

‘Book Mountain Pressure’ is just my chat nickname, not my actual nickname!

Maybe I should change my nickname? 

Otherwise, if everyone thinks that’s my real nickname, it would be so embarrassing to meet people who call me ‘Book Mountain Pressure Friend’ or ‘Book Mountain Pressure Senior.’ Just thinking about it makes my heart ache.

Afterward, Scholar Song pulled up a text message template, edited his delivery address, and sent it to the master of Seven Lives Talisman.

In truth, the master of Seven Lives Talisman didn’t need to hang up the phone so quickly. Scholar Song wasn’t one to put up a front; he understood the gap in strength between himself and the enemy, the ‘leader.’ At this moment, whether it was talisman support or direct assistance, Scholar Song would never turn down anyone’s goodwill.

When it comes to life and death, what’s the point of pride?

“I wonder what kind of talismans the master of Seven Lives will send me?”

Talismans! 

The golden talisman paper that Fay Yu had used could pin down two Phantom Spirits with a single throw—it was incredibly powerful. 

For Scholar Song, this was undoubtedly a timely blessing!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On June 7th, the sun blazed down.

This time of year marked a grueling and tense period for high school students, as the national college entrance examination in the Middle Land was held annually starting on this day.

And every year, during this time, Jiangnan University City would mischievously hold its sports festival, showcasing the deep malice of the upper management towards the struggling exam students.

Among the events, the men’s 5,000-meter long-distance race took place on the first day of the festival.

As a participant, Scholar Song woke up early, intending to stretch and casually grab a first place finish to make a statement.

When he woke up, he reached for the black flying sword lying beside his bed.

The flying sword, a treasure that should be untainted by blood, somehow gave him the impression that it still carried a scent of blood.

“Guess this isn’t a dream,” Scholar Song murmured to himself.

Yesterday… he had killed someone for the first time, and it was a head shot at that. The image of the long-armed man’s head soaring into the air was still fresh in his mind, marking the first drop of blood he had ever shed. This sight would linger in Scholar Song’s thoughts for a long time.

“Next up, it’s that leader,” Scholar Song tightened his grip on the flying sword.

The enemy mistakenly believed he was a ‘master,’ which scared them off from the Jiangnan area. But Scholar Song couldn’t rely on the enemy’s ‘misunderstanding’ for his and his family’s safety.

He wouldn’t find peace until this nuisance was resolved. Fortunately, he would have leads by this afternoon at the latest.

……

……

After washing up, Scholar Song opened the dormitory door to go stretch his legs.

As soon as he opened the door, he found a smiling man in a suit standing right outside.

Wait, who is this again?

“Scholar Song, we meet again. I’m Mr. Jiang from Harvest Express, and I have another delivery for you.” The man in the suit forced a friendly smile.

Oh, it’s Mr. Si Ma Jiang from Harvest Express!

Last time, when delivering a package, Scholar Song didn't recognize his identity and thought he was just a delivery guy, so he called him ‘Little Jiang.’ At that moment, Mr. Si Ma Jiang couldn’t help but twitch at the corner of his mouth—he was a person of some standing, and being called ‘Little Jiang’ felt a bit ridiculous.

But this time, he introduced himself as ‘Little Jiang.’ In just three days, he had made two deliveries from different senders and addresses, but both senders were shockingly important figures.

Now, this ‘Little Jiang’ was set in stone! Forget just ‘Little Jiang,’ even calling him ‘Little Little Jiang’ wouldn’t be an issue!

Seeing Mr. Si Ma Jiang reminded Scholar Song of the promise from the master of Seven Lives to send a package.

An express package sent in the early morning had arrived by six o’clock? That’s some incredible speed!

“Good morning, Little Jiang! Another urgent air delivery?” Scholar Song asked.

“Indeed, it’s an urgent package from the western region. I personally flew out overnight to pick it up and delivered it to you as quickly as possible. I hope I didn’t take up too much of your time, Scholar Song!” Mr. Si Ma Jiang said as he pulled out a package the size of a mobile phone box.

It was wrapped tightly, sealed securely.

“It’s perfect timing; you didn’t take up any of my time at all. Where should I sign?” Scholar Song said, feeling quite trusting of this delivery man. The last item he delivered was flawless.

“Just sign here.” Mr. Si Ma Jiang handed over a pen.

As Scholar Song was signing, he thought of Master Tong Xuan’s black iron flying sword and casually asked, “Hey, Little Jiang, I might have a package to send out in a few days. I’ll contact you then, okay?”

After he dealt with the ‘leader’ situation, he planned to send Master Tong Xuan’s sword back. Given how great the service from Harvest Express was, Scholar Song naturally thought of him first.

“Where is it being sent? Do you need me to use express air delivery?” Mr. Si Ma Jiang’s eyes brightened, his excitement evident.

“No, no, it’s not urgent. A regular delivery will do. I’ll contact you when I’m ready to send it.” Scholar Song smiled.

“No problem! You can contact me anytime, twenty-four hours a day!” Mr. Si Ma Jiang beamed, his customer service attitude earning top marks.

Holding the package, Scholar Song wondered what kind of talismans the master of Seven Lives had sent him.
