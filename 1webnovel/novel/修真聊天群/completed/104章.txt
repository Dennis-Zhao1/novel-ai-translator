**It Turns Out to Be a Trial Version!**

Scholar Song opened the last file with excitement, but soon his face fell in disappointment as he closed it again. 

This set of 'Temporary Sword Control Technique' was actually a failed product from Master Tongxuan's experiment to 'lower the usage level of Sword Control Technique.' Later, the master modified it a bit to let his disciples experience the wonders of Sword Control in advance.

First, Master Tongxuan would embed a special formation inside a flying sword, storing some of his own spiritual energy within it. After that, low-level disciples could temporarily use and experience the magical Sword Control Technique by following a set of activation commands, incantations, and hand seals.

However, since Master Tongxuan's stored spiritual energy was limited, this temporary Sword Control Technique couldn't last long. Therefore, it was also called the trial version of the temporary Sword Control Technique.

This 'temporary worker' version of Sword Control was so simplistic that even if Scholar Song learned it, it would be of no use. After reading through the entire document from beginning to end, he simply shut the folder.

"Hope breeds disappointment. Tonight, I still have to treat Yang De, Tu Bo, and the others to some ten-spiced fish heads. With six or seven hours left, I can just manage to practice a few times. Time is money! If you don't work hard when you're young, you'll regret it when you're older!"

As he began his training with the 'Basic Vajra Fist Technique,' for some unknown reason, Scholar Song's mind kept drifting back to the face of that silly uncle. 

So, he put more effort into every punch he threw!

By the end of the set, it felt as though the vitality he generated had increased a little?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At the Fourth People's Hospital in Jiangnan, in the patient room.

Sima Jiang stood up from the hospital bed, lit a cigarette, and quietly gazed out the window.

"Sima, the person has been brought in," said a bespectacled man in a suit from outside the door.

Sima Jiang ground his teeth together. "Bring him in."

The door swung open, and a group of burly men dragged a tightly bound robber into the room.

Sima Jiang turned his head, coldly locking eyes with the robber. "Guasong, do you recognize me?"

The robber looked up at Sima Jiang and suddenly grinned. "I do."

Earlier, facing so many guns, he had no choice but to back down. But now... this small hospital room and the bodyguards outside couldn't hold him back!

To catch the thief, one must catch the leader. If he could seize this handsome uncle, he could escape with the hostages.

As for the ropes binding him... how could they truly hold him?

With a slight struggle, the robber broke free of the ropes. In a flash, he darted toward Sima Jiang like an arrow, his speed terrifying.

His right hand clawed toward Sima Jiang's throat, aiming to seize him as a hostage!

However, seeing the robber suddenly break free of the ropes, Sima Jiang showed no fear in his eyes.

Positioned at the door, the bespectacled man pushed his glasses up, calmly pressing a remote button with his right hand.

"Bang! Bang!" Two almost inaudible explosions echoed.

The robber, mid-leap, widened his eyes in shock as his legs were blown off at the knees, blood gushing everywhere.

This was a precaution set up by Sima Jiang's people from the very beginning, designed to prevent the robber from escaping and to guard against any accidents.

"Ah..." The robber screamed in agony, falling from the air and writhing in pain on the ground.

Sima Jiang nodded, and two men who appeared to be doctors approached calmly, injecting the robber with medication and bandaging his severed limbs.

After a moment.

The robber sat quietly in the corner, his gaze vacant. His legs... were gone?

It was over; everything was over!

Without legs, how could he even think about cultivating?

His life, everything he had, was finished.

Sima Jiang crushed the cigarette butt, looking down at the robber from above. "Guasong, aren't you going to jump around anymore?"

The robber wore a lifeless expression, not uttering a single word.

"I can't be bothered to ask your name or your background. I just want to know, where is the package you stole from me?" Sima Jiang asked solemnly.

"Heh." The robber rolled his eyes.

"Not going to tell me? I like your kind of tough guy," Sima Jiang said, giving him a thumbs up, and then pulled out a metal rod from somewhere, smashing it hard against the robber's head, causing blood to burst forth. "Here’s a stick for you!"

"And then you'll tell me everything you know, I guarantee it!"

"Take him away; let him experience our methods!"

……

In less than ten minutes, the robber quickly broke down.

He confessed readily, not because Sima Jiang and his men were particularly skilled at coercion, but because he wanted revenge!

He described his master's location and his brother's appearance in detail—just waiting for Sima Jiang and the others to go find his master!

His master was an inner disciple of the Moon Blade Sect, with second-tier cultivation. Dealing with these ordinary people was a piece of cake for him!

Even if by some chance his master ended up in trouble, ambushed by these ordinary folks—that would be a cause for celebration!

That bastard had stolen his invisible divine sword and pretended to offer it to the sect leader. If it weren't for his own lack of strength, he would have already fought him!

Sima Jiang and his brother were both targets of his disdain. Watching them tear each other apart was just what he wanted! The more they hurt each other, the better.

Of course, he wouldn’t be foolish enough to reveal that the other party was his brother and that he had formidable strength. He only said that he was an accomplice living with him, and that the package and its contents were in his hands.

Sima Jiang lit another cigarette, taking a deep drag.

"You better hope everything you said is true. If you dare to deceive me, I’ll make your life worse than death," Sima Jiang said fiercely. In a lawful society, killing someone wasn’t good, after all—they were law-abiding citizens.

But there were plenty of ways to make someone wish they were dead.

Like throwing him into a special prison for a while and forcibly altering his views on love... then having people line up every day to pick up his soap.

"Based on his description, find his companions!" Sima Jiang commanded solemnly.

"With such detailed descriptions, we can have this guy's partners dug out by tomorrow at the latest. Leave it to us," the bespectacled man said confidently, pushing his glasses up.

"The sooner, the better!" Sima Jiang nodded.

Let’s hope nothing else goes wrong…

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At four-thirty in the evening.

Scholar Song had practiced the fist technique seven times and consumed two blood vitality pills.

The number of blood vitality pills was dwindling, but the vitality in his heart aperture was increasing, now around twenty veins of vitality.

Now, with just a moment of meditation, he could sense a warm current swirling within his heart aperture! Once he gathered over thirty veins of vitality, his physique could undergo another transformation, allowing him to cultivate even more 'blood vitality' in a single day.

Seeing that it was about time, Scholar Song concluded his practice.

He found a bathroom at the Alchemical Sage's place, took a shower to wash away the impurities and sweat from his practice, and changed into the fresh clothes he had prepared earlier.

Then, he jogged over to Ten-Spiced Fish Head and reserved a room.

"Yang De, bring Tu Bo, Gao and the others to Ten-Spiced Fish Head. I’ve booked a room, number 303!" Scholar Song called Yang De.

"Got it, we'll be there soon!" Yang De chuckled, turning to his roommate beside him and saying, "Get ready, we're off to Ten-Spiced Fish Head—A-Hang’s treating!"

Tu Bo, Gao, and Zhuge Zhongyang were right next to him.

"A-Hang’s treating at Ten-Spiced Fish Head?" Gao’s eyes shifted as he quickly pulled out his phone and dialed a number.

"Hello? Is this Classmate Lu Fei? It’s me, Gao. Remember Scholar Song said he’d treat us to Ten-Spiced Fish Head? Yes, yes, you’re invited too. Get ready to come over! The private room? Yes, it’s room 303!" Gao adjusted his glasses, the lenses reflecting a glimmer of wisdom…
