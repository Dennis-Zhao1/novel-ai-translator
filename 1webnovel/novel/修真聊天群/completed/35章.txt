“Don’t be shy, just answer me loudly!”

The Hermit of North River continued, “So, I suggest that you possess a certain level of strength. After you have enough Essence Refinement Liquid for your own cultivation, you can quietly let your friends and family use the surplus. And during this process, there are a few points you need to pay attention to.”

“First, until you have sufficient self-defense capabilities, try not to reveal your identity as a cultivator. This is to avoid bringing disaster upon yourself and your loved ones. This isn’t just a scare tactic; throughout history, countless cultivators have suffered because of such details—they could line up around the globe! Therefore, before you let your friends and family take the Essence Refinement Liquid, you need to find a reasonable excuse to cover up its origin and effects.”

Scholar Song nodded; he understood this point well. One should never harbor malicious intentions, but one must remain vigilant against others.

“Moreover, not just anyone can consume the Essence Refinement Liquid. Before taking it, the body’s vital energy must be sufficient. If someone is too old or their vitality has waned, they absolutely cannot take the Essence Refinement Liquid, or they may risk losing their life. Generally, even in sects, when giving it to new disciples, they have to undergo training for several months or even half a year to ensure their vitality is at its peak before they can consume it,” the Hermit of North River patiently explained.

Hearing this, Scholar Song felt a wave of disappointment wash over him—his parents, Father Song and Mother Song, were already past their prime, and their vitality had begun to decline. That meant they wouldn’t be able to take the Essence Refinement Liquid after all.

“By the way, Scholar Song, you managed to take the Essence Refinement Liquid without any issues. You must exercise regularly, right?” The Hermit of North River suddenly had a thought and asked.

“Uh… I used to maintain a certain level of physical activity. But due to various reasons, I haven’t exercised in over a year,” Scholar Song replied shyly.

“Not exercised in over a year? Then how did you not feel any discomfort after taking the Essence Refinement Liquid?” The Hermit of North River was a bit surprised. If that were the case, either Scholar Song had an absurdly strong physique, or…

Scholar Song replied, “I didn’t feel any discomfort. At first, my throat was a bit fiery, but afterwards, I just felt very comfortable and full of energy.”

“How interesting, Scholar Song! I want to ask you a question, and don’t be shy—answer me loudly,” the Hermit of North River said. “Have you ever had a girlfriend?”

The sudden leap in topic was jarring; what did taking the Essence Refinement Liquid have to do with girlfriends?

And was this even a shy topic?

Scholar Song responded, “I just started university not long ago, so I haven’t had the chance to date yet.”

“So, you’ve never lost your virginity? Still a virgin?” the Hermit of North River pressed.

Scholar Song replied, “Why does your way of questioning make me feel so mocked?”

“Oh? So you really are a virgin. Hahaha! I was just being straightforward; looks like you prefer a more subtle way of asking? Let me ask you again,” the Hermit of North River chuckled. “Have you ever done something like King Kong, you know, on the top of the Empire State Building?”

“That’s not subtle at all! That’s an old joke from twenty years ago; any regular person would see right through it!” Scholar Song retorted, “And why King Kong? North River senior, are you so free that you watch movies?”

“Well, I’m one of the more up-to-date members of the group,” the Hermit of North River replied. “Now answer me, don’t avoid the question. Have you ever done that?”

“No,” Scholar Song gritted out, a single word. Due to some embarrassing past experiences, he had never dared to imitate King Kong. He didn’t want to think about those black history moments; just the thought made him want to roll on the floor.

“Oh, this young man has potential!” The Hermit of North River laughed heartily. “Last question for you: have you lost your dreams on the grasslands?”

“What?” Scholar Song was unable to keep up with the Hermit of North River’s rapid topic shifts. Just a moment ago, they were discussing his virginity, and now it was about dreams and grasslands?

“See? If I were to be subtle, you wouldn’t catch on, would you? Let me just ask you plainly: have you ever had a nocturnal emission? You’re not that young anymore; it’s about that time, isn’t it?” The Hermit of North River was still playing with innuendos.

“…” Scholar Song really didn’t want to answer this question, but he steeled himself and said, “Fine, I don’t think I’ve ever experienced that. But my body is definitely healthy, and I’m only eighteen. Normally, it’s perfectly normal for someone aged sixteen to twenty to experience that, so even if it happens a little later, it’s no problem!”

“Why are you rambling on? I never said your body wasn’t healthy,” the Hermit of North River said. “I just wanted to point out that you are indeed still a virgin. So even if you haven’t exercised for over a year, because of your unspent vitality, you managed to pull through. You should be glad you didn’t learn from King Kong; otherwise, if you had carelessly taken the Essence Refinement Liquid, you might have exploded! I mean, really exploded—blood everywhere, ‘boom!’” the Hermit of North River laughed.

Scholar Song felt like he could just strangle the Hermit of North River at that moment.

“Alas.” The Alchemical Sage interjected with a deep sigh, “Scholar Song, while it’s amusing to see you being led by this guy and revealing all sorts of embarrassing secrets in the group chat, I still can’t help but remind you of one thing.”

“Don’t you know there’s a function called private chat in messaging tools?”

“…” Scholar Song felt like he wanted to cry.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

After chatting in the group for a while, Scholar Song bid farewell to his seniors and logged off.

At this time, the Alchemical Sage privately messaged the Hermit of North River: “North River, why did you recommend the scattered cultivator’s cultivation method to Scholar Song? You and I both know how difficult it is for scattered cultivators to achieve success; you should understand that well!”

He was well aware of the challenges faced by scattered cultivators, so he didn’t understand why the Hermit of North River recommended that path to Scholar Song. Wouldn’t it be better to directly suggest that Scholar Song join one of the sects of the friends in the group?

The Hermit of North River sighed, “I know all too well; it’s harder for scattered cultivators than climbing to the heavens. If I had any other choice, I wouldn’t be recommending that path to Scholar Song.”

The Alchemical Sage frowned, “Then why still recommend it? Our group has many sects, and several friends within those sects hold significant positions. Finding a suitable sect for Scholar Song shouldn’t be difficult.”

“It’s because of his age,” the Hermit of North River explained. “Don’t forget Scholar Song’s age. He’s already eighteen. For an ordinary person, that’s just the beginning of life, but for us cultivators, it’s already well past the optimal age for foundation building.”

It was commonly recognized among cultivators that the best age for foundation building was around four to five years old. At this age, a child’s bones are still soft, and more importantly, the innate true energy from the womb is still present. If they succeed in foundation building at this stage, they can merge this innate true energy, laying an incredibly strong foundation for their cultivation path. With this innate true energy, there are almost no bottlenecks before reaching the third rank!

However, children at this age are still physically fragile, and the total amount of vital energy may not be sufficient. So even the most carefully selected disciples from sects may not complete foundation building between four and five years old.

Four to five years is the best time for foundation building, while the latest acceptable age is eight.

Once past the age of eight, the innate true energy from the womb completely dissipates. This opportunity, once missed, can never be regained. Without that innate true energy, even if one later attempts foundation building, it will be fraught with difficulties. The time and resources required to advance each level will be more than one and a half times that of those who successfully built their foundation before the age of eight.

And at eighteen years old, that’s a full ten years past the acceptable age!
