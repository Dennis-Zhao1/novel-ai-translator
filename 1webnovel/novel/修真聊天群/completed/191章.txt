**Blessings from Venerable White**

The next morning, Scholar Song awoke groggily—he had experienced a series of bizarre dreams during the night.

In one dream, the elevator suddenly malfunctioned, and he plummeted down from several floors;

In another, he found himself as a janitor, washing windows on a skyscraper when the rope snapped;

There was also a dream where he stood at the edge of a cliff, admiring the view, only to feel someone give him a gentle push from behind;

And yet another where he was walking down the street and suddenly fell into a bottomless well, tumbling and tumbling without hitting the bottom.

In short, his dreams were filled with sensations of weightlessness and falling. Scholar Song's legs felt weak just thinking about it…

Upon waking, he was still rattled.

There was no denying it; these strange nightmares were definitely influenced by his bungee jumping escapade with Venerable White the previous day.

“Did I channel the spirit of the Wild Blade yesterday?” Scholar Song regretted his impulsive words, wondering how he had lost control of his mouth so suddenly.

He hoped that Venerable White had calmed down and wouldn’t drag him off to bungee jump again today! Otherwise, if he went through that ordeal a few more times, he feared his acrophobia would worsen to the point where he might even hesitate to fly with a sword. That would be a disaster…

After his usual morning exercises, Scholar Song got ready—today was the last day of final exams. Once he completed today’s exam, a two-month summer vacation awaited him!

As he headed downstairs, he planned to sneak a peek at Venerable White’s mood for the day.

But strangely enough, Venerable White was nowhere to be seen that morning. Even Tangtang, the disciple from the Empty Thief Sect, was absent, leaving only Doudou to guard the house.

“Doudou, where’s Venerable White?” Scholar Song asked, puzzled.

“Venerable White went to retrieve his flying sword! After you fell asleep last night, he took that disciple from the Empty Thief Sect and left,” Doudou replied casually, seemingly engrossed in some news on the computer.

Scholar Song nodded inwardly; Venerable White had indeed mentioned this to him before.

“What are you looking at, Doudou?” Scholar Song leaned over curiously, peering at the computer screen—ah, it was the morning news from the Jiangnan region?

Doudou was actually watching the news?

Scholar Song glanced at the news content.

Reports indicated that several areas in Jiangnan had seen a rise in cases of missing pet dogs, with the police suspecting a dog-stealing gang had infiltrated the region. Their methods were quite skilled; they always tried to avoid surveillance cameras and left very few traces behind. The police urged residents to pay attention to the safety of their dogs and not give the gang any opportunities…

A dog-stealing gang?

Jiangnan had many dog owners, so every year, these gangs would come to prey on them. Sometimes, dogs worth tens of thousands would be snatched and sold for a mere hundred bucks to dog meat restaurants. The police in Jiangnan managed to catch a few of these gangs each year, but they remained stubbornly persistent.

Seeing this news, Scholar Song couldn't help but mourn silently for the dog-stealing gang—why must they target Jiangnan of all places?

And why steal dogs? Catching cats or stealing chickens would be fine, but why dogs? If they didn't court disaster, they'd be fine—why couldn't people grasp such a simple truth?

Including yesterday’s version of himself!

“By the way, before Venerable White left, he left you a few things. He said you could take them with you to deal with that ‘subordinate of the altar master’ in neighboring City J,” Doudou said, still scratching at the mouse with his paw while nonchalantly kicking a package towards Scholar Song.

“What is this?” Scholar Song asked as he received the package.

“Just open it first; I’ll explain it afterward,” Doudou replied without looking back.

Scholar Song opened the package.

First, there was a wooden sword, intricately engraved with complex patterns, clearly a crafted item from Venerable White. At the hilt, there was a small box with a button, seemingly a matching accessory for the wooden sword.

Upon seeing the button, Scholar Song felt an irresistible urge to press it. It was a human instinct—most people get the itch to press strange buttons.

However, the cautious ones would resist the urge, while the reckless ones would press it without a second thought.

Next to the wooden sword was a—temporary tattoo sticker. It looked just like the kind Scholar Song used to play with as a kid, costing fifty cents a piece.

Additionally, there was a handwritten list.

“The wooden sword is called ‘One-Time Flying Sword, Version 004’. As the name suggests, it can only be used once. But since it’s a treasure made by Venerable White, it should easily be able to slice through a fourth-rank cultivator,” Doudou explained.

“The accompanying item is called ‘Flying Sword Launcher, Version 013’. You just need to inject your own blood energy into the launcher to resonate with the sword, allowing you to lock onto an enemy with your intent. Then, you can simply press that button. Whoosh! The ‘One-Time Flying Sword, Version 004’ will launch out to slay your locked target. It’s convenient and practical, your first self-defense item from Venerable White,” Doudou elaborated.

A flying sword launcher? Scholar Song had thought that the ‘experience version of sword control’ from the Grand Master was impressive, but Venerable White had taken it up a notch by creating a flying sword launcher.

Just imagine—one gentle press, and the sword would fly out to strike. It sounded exhilarating!

“And that sticker? It’s a talisman inscribed with Venerable White’s coordinates, called ‘Ten Thousand Li Escape Technique’. If you encounter an enemy you can’t possibly defeat, just activate this talisman with your mental energy, and you’ll teleport to Venerable White’s side at incredible speed,” Doudou explained.

“This sticker—is it this one?” Scholar Song held up the fifty-cent temporary tattoo sticker, seeking confirmation.

“That’s it! Venerable White said he modified the talisman for easier carrying. You can stick it on your arm, and it’ll imprint like a tattoo, making it practical and impossible to lose,” Doudou replied.

“Wow, talismans can be used like this?” Scholar Song exclaimed, grabbing the sticker and applying it to his wrist, the talisman’s design imprinting itself onto his skin.

This method was indeed clever—it saved him the trouble of fumbling through his pockets for the talisman during a life-or-death situation.

“By the way, Doudou, don’t you find this design familiar?” Scholar Song pointed at the tattoo pattern, puzzled.

“Of course! Venerable White said he wanted to cover the design before he made the talisman, so enemies wouldn’t recognize it as the ‘Ten Thousand Li Escape Technique’ and prepare against it. So, I searched online for a picture of a gourd baby, but used an abstract version. If you hold your palm up and look at it sideways, can’t you see a three-dimensional gourd baby? Isn’t it cool?” 

A three-dimensional gourd baby?

“…” Scholar Song suddenly felt a strong desire to smack Doudou.

Plus, he regretted sticking it on his wrist so hastily. If he had known, he would have placed the tattoo sticker somewhere more discreet, so it wouldn’t be seen by others!

“By the way, if you find yourself in a dangerous situation and can’t even release your mental energy, this ‘Ten Thousand Li Escape Technique’ also has a voice activation function. I’ll tell you the incantation… Listen carefully, the incantation is ‘Lunar Prism Power, Transform’—got that?” Doudou continued.

“Wait… what’s the deal with this incantation? Don’t tell me you just found it online?” Scholar Song gritted his teeth.

“Yep, just a random search turned it up,” Doudou admitted.

Doudou, come here! I swear I won’t smack you!

……

……

“Finally, there’s this last list, which is a materials list for the ‘Blood Qi Pill’. Venerable White has noticed that your supply of Blood Qi Pills seems low, so he made this list for you to see if you can find some of the herbs mentioned. If you can gather them all, he can teach you how to concoct the Blood Qi Pill. Though he’s not an alchemist, he can still manage to brew some low-tier pills,” Doudou added.

Scholar Song opened the list and saw a dazzling array of herbs. Some names were familiar from traditional Chinese medicine, while others were specific to cultivators.

Fortunately, Venerable White had thoughtfully drawn pictures of the herbs alongside brief descriptions, preventing Scholar Song from being completely clueless.

“Collecting all these materials for the Blood Qi Pill won’t be easy, right?” Scholar Song sighed.

“Yeah, I think so too. But maybe to Venerable White, gathering the materials for the Blood Qi Pill is something he could do on a casual stroll,” Doudou commented.

With Venerable White’s luck, if he really wanted the materials for the Blood Qi Pill today, he might just step outside to find a box dropping from the sky filled with them.

Or perhaps someone would show up, and after defeating them, he’d be left with a pile of Blood Qi materials.

Even wandering through a forest, he might stumble upon a bounty of Blood Qi herbs, right?

Scholar Song couldn’t help but empathize with Venerable White’s ‘luck.’ He nodded inwardly. However, as for himself, he could forget it—he didn’t have luck as outrageous as Venerable White’s. Finding the materials for the Blood Qi Pill would have to wait.

Still, he diligently read through the list Venerable White left behind, committing its contents to memory.

At the end of the list, he spotted a message from Venerable White.

“Dear Scholar Song, I wish you a smooth journey to City J. May you successfully find the materials for the Blood Qi Pill!”

Was this Venerable White’s blessing?

Venerable White’s blessing! Scholar Song felt his heart race; he was taken aback by the unexpected warmth. Was he feeling flattered, or was there an undercurrent of anxiety he couldn’t shake off?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Finally, the last exam was over.

Students from Jiangnan University City let out deep sighs, those who felt they had done well wore relaxed expressions, ready to enjoy a pleasant summer vacation ahead.

Meanwhile, those who had unfortunately flunked wore expressions of despair... Perhaps shortly after the summer break, they would receive their report cards. Then… they’d be waiting for the school to arrange make-up exams.

The make-up exam schedules at Jiangnan University City were notoriously capricious; it completely depended on the school’s whims. Sometimes, halfway through the vacation, students who failed would suddenly be called back for make-up exams; other times, they would be subjected to hellish tutoring at the start of the new semester, then tossed back for retests. At times, they would even organize make-up exams just two or three days after the regular exams—such efficiency in grading left students both loving and hating the system.

Since it was the last exam, Scholar Song didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he waited for his roommates to come out. With the semester ending, they should all go out for a meal together before diving into their summer adventures.

“How did it go?” Gao asked his roommates with a relaxed expression, clearly confident about his performance.

“No problem,” Li Yangde replied, his glasses gleaming. For a student like him, passing was never a concern; his only goal was to dominate the top ten rankings.

“It was pretty easy; I don't foresee any issues,” Scholar Song responded with a smile.

“Ha ha ha! I think I did well too! Feeling sure I passed!” Tu Bo gave a thumbs up. With the help of the magical tea Scholar Song had sent him, he had studied with vigor and confidence, and the exam went smoothly.

That evening, the roommates invited five close friends to go out for a drink.

In the end… Scholar Song called three taxis to ferry the drunken friends back to their respective dorms.

“Scholar, wake me up in the morning! We… we’re going to my grandpa's house together!” Tu Bo said, his eyes bleary but still remembering this plan.

“Sure, I’ll come get you tomorrow,” Scholar Song replied with a grin.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Back at the Alchemical Sage’s residence, Scholar Song found Doudou searching through maps of the Jiangnan region.

“Doudou, I’m heading to neighboring City J tomorrow. Want to come with me?” Scholar Song asked. Doudou was a valuable ally; bringing it along would ease his worries about any unexpected events.

“Woof woof~ I think I’ll pass. I have some things to take care of in the next few days,” Doudou replied, shaking its body and shedding a dog hair, which it then picked up with its paw and handed to Scholar Song.

“If you run into any danger, just hold onto my hair and shout, ‘Doudou, save me!’ Then my dog hair will come to your aid. Woof~ Go ahead and have peace of mind,” Doudou said with a serious expression.

Scholar Song took the hair, examining it closely. “Will this really work?”

“Woof, you don’t want it? If you don’t, just give it back. I’m reluctant to part with it!” Doudou immediately protested.

Scholar Song quickly tucked the dog hair away. Come on, you don’t take back gifts! Even if this hair wasn’t particularly useful, he still wanted to keep it. After all, it was hair from a great demon dog—who knows, it might even make for good crafting material!

……

……

The next day.

Scholar Song packed his bag and was ready to go. He first visited the underground parking lot, pulling out a cheap domestic hatchback to pick up Tu Bo for their trip to City J.

Since it was the start of the summer break following the exams, the number of students returning to Jiangnan City that day was overwhelming, causing the subways and trains to be packed to the brim. 

Upon arriving at the dorm, he found his three roommates struggling to get out of bed, their eyes bloodshot and still recovering from the night’s revelry.
