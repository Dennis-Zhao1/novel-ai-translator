**"Hold on, fellow cultivator!"**

"Indeed, if I truly wish to find it, I will definitely be able to locate the mysterious island," Venerable White declared confidently.

Following the divination array, he arrived at a special location in the East Sea. Subsequently, Venerable White extended his spiritual sense into the void, finally making contact with the coordinates of the ‘Thousand Miles Escape Technique’ branded on Scholar Song's hand.

Venerable White had pinpointed Scholar Song's location.

However, at this moment, Scholar Song's condition seemed a bit peculiar. It felt as if he was not in this world, but rather in some illusory realm.

“Is this sensation a true illusion?” Venerable White murmured.

In other words, there was at least one powerful cultivator of the Venerable rank stationed on the mysterious island. Through the coordinates of the Thousand Miles Escape Technique, Venerable White could faintly sense that Scholar Song was calm and seemingly unharmed.

"Then how do I get to Scholar Song's side?" Venerable White pondered. Suddenly, he recalled the two ‘one-time flying swords, version 004’ that had disappeared while he was pursuing the coordinates of Scholar Song's Thousand Miles Escape Technique.

At that time, Doudou and the little monk had been blocked from entering the mysterious island, but the one-time flying swords had faced no such restriction and had flown into the island.

Perhaps, by using one of those one-time flying swords, he could open a passage to reach Scholar Song.

With Venerable White's strength, he could seize the fleeting opportunity to follow the one-time flying sword and teleport to Scholar Song's side.

It might just work!

However, he was currently surrounded by vast seas and couldn't find a branch to use as material for the one-time flying sword.

Should he try to use something else to replace the branch and craft a one-time flying sword?

As Venerable White scanned his surroundings for a substitute, he suddenly spotted a figure in a white suit in the distance, gracefully standing with hands behind his back, riding a fresh tree branch across the ocean waves!

...

...

My name is Fox Ten, and that’s my code name.

I belong to a mysterious organization that specializes in taking care of all sorts of troubles. We’re well-versed in killing, kidnapping, and scamming, but I rarely participate in the killing aspect. Instead, I handle other special tasks, like helping someone fulfill their wish of having a child, or tricking young ladies into giving me a baby. That’s what I’m good at.

Today, Wolf One assigned me a task to trick a young lady.

The talented young lady from the Chu family, named Chu Chu, possesses a scroll of the ‘Ancient Sword Technique.’

My mission was to play the role of a hero rescuing the beautiful damsel from the grips of Whale Eight and Shark Nine. Afterward, I would use my best skills to deceive her and obtain the ‘Ancient Sword Technique’ scroll from her.

The mission’s setting was on the surface of the East Sea.

So, I prepared for the most stylish entrance.

I donned my favorite white suit and stood on a branch, gliding across the ocean waves.

Unfortunately, I still couldn’t fly with a sword; otherwise, I’d look even cooler.

But riding a branch across the sea is quite a stylish way to make an entrance.

I’m Fox Ten. Want to have a charming and adorable child? Please contact me; I represent my own handsome genes.

Huh? What’s that ahead? A giant whale? There’s a beautiful person, a little monk, and a small Pekingese on top of it.

That beautiful person is looking at me!

Her eyes sparkled like those of a thirsty traveler in the desert who has just spotted a refreshing spring.

Indeed, someone as handsome as me is bound to attract attention wherever I go.

“Hold on, fellow cultivator!” the beautiful person called out, clearly wanting to stop me.

But, alas, I can’t stay today.

I ran a hand through my hair, fixing my hairstyle, and struck a handsome side pose.

Goodbye, beautiful person.

I have a mission to attend to today; otherwise, I would have definitely asked you to bear my child. But I’ll leave you with the most handsome image of me. Remember me well.

Huh? Wait, why can’t I move my body?

I’m drifting toward that beautiful person!

...

...

Venerable White harnessed his aura, unmatched under heaven.

“This branch came just in time, and it’s my favorite willow branch!” With a swift motion, Venerable White reached out and grasped the figure in the white suit and the branch beneath his feet, pulling them closer.

Fox Ten's eyes went wide—oh no, he had encountered a formidable opponent!

Thud! Fox Ten clumsily landed in front of Venerable White, rolling on the massive back of the whale, then maintaining a half-kneeling position while staring fixedly at Venerable White. He grasped his waistband with one hand—that was a disguised soft sword.

“Greetings, fellow cultivator. What is your surname?” Venerable White asked with a slight smile.

Fox Ten swallowed hard—he had no intention of answering.

But when Venerable White smiled at him, he felt mesmerized. “Fox Ten.”

“Your surname is Fox, and your name is Ten? There’s actually someone with that name?” Venerable White stroked his chin thoughtfully.

Fox Ten: “…”

He had been selected by the organization to cultivate from a young age, and 'Fox Ten' was his entire identity. But he didn’t actually have the surname Fox or the name Ten.

“Alright, fellow cultivator. Actually, I have something I’d like to discuss with you.” Venerable White reached out and grasped the fresh branch: “I’d like to borrow this branch of yours for a moment.”

Fox Ten's thoughts raced—he had been yanked out of the ocean for just this branch?

But the situation was beyond his control; the beautiful person in front of him had effortlessly pulled him closer as if he were a baby with no power to resist.

If the other party wanted this mere branch, could he dare refuse?

He wasn’t foolish enough to offend a terrifying cultivator over an ordinary branch.

Thus, Fox Ten chuckled awkwardly, “Senior, if you wish to use it, please feel free. It’s just a branch found everywhere.”

Venerable White’s mood instantly lifted: “Indeed, you are a straightforward fellow cultivator. I’ll remember this favor! However, without this branch, you’ll have no means of transportation. Let me give you something in exchange?”

“Senior, you are too kind.” Fox Ten replied, but inside he was excited. What kind of treasure might this senior offer him as a substitute for transportation?

Just as he was pondering this, he saw Venerable White suddenly reach out and grab something from the water.

Soon, a fish over two meters long, with a spear-like snout, was pulled from the sea.

The fish struggled violently as it surfaced.

Was that a species known as ‘swordfish’?

What was he going to do with that swordfish?

Next, Fox Ten watched as the beautiful senior patted the swordfish, causing it to faint instantly.

Then came the shocking scene.

Venerable White began to draw a formation in the air using his finger, and a surge of spiritual energy poured out, forming an array on the swordfish's body.

Setting up an array in the void—what kind of power did that require?

Fox Ten was terrified.

“All done! Successful,” Venerable White clapped his hands and explained, “This is a combination of acceleration, mental control, murky water, and spirit gathering array—a four-in-one formation that lasts for a month.”

“After a while, if you stand on the swordfish, Fox Ten, you’ll be able to control it through mental connection. With the murky water array, you won’t have to worry about getting wet or the swordfish drying out. The spirit gathering array will keep the swordfish vital and tireless.”

At this point, Venerable White beamed with pride as he said, “And that acceleration array is my proudest creation. Ten times the speed—way cooler than your branch! So, what do you think? Do you like your new transportation?”

Acceleration arrays were Venerable White's specialty. Unfortunately, this swordfish had poor aptitude; otherwise, with all these arrays, it might have even gained sentience.

Fox Ten nodded with a forced smile.

“Then, fellow cultivator, I still have matters to attend to, so we part ways here!” Venerable White said to Fox Ten.

Without waiting for Fox Ten to respond, he pushed with both hands.

Both the swordfish and Fox Ten were tossed back into the sea.

The swordfish awakened from its stupor and began to swim joyfully, while Fox Ten stood atop it, feeling the mental control array subtly guiding the fish's direction.

Thus, Fox Ten rode the swordfish, continuing to ride the waves...

Fox Ten still looked dashing, but as soon as the transportation changed from a branch to a swordfish, he could no longer maintain his composure.

It was like a handsome prince on a white horse suddenly finding himself atop a husky; no matter how charming the prince was, he would lose his flair.

Yet, there was one thing Fox Ten was undeniably pleased about.

That was the speed—oh, the speed!

Ten times faster, the swordfish could achieve a burst speed of one hundred miles per hour! With the spirit gathering array to assist, the swordfish wouldn’t tire out and could continuously zip through the water at nearly a hundred miles per hour.

And more importantly, this ten times speed had no gears... no gears... no gears!

With a ‘whoosh’, the swordfish shot forward.

He couldn’t stop it.

“Aaahhhh!” Fox Ten's frantic screams echoed across the East Sea.

**Senior! You forgot to give me brakes!**

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

After sending off Fox Ten, Venerable White swiftly carved several notches into the fresh branch, quickly transforming it into a ‘one-time flying sword, version 004.’

“Next... the true illusion!” Venerable White spread his hands, and a vast illusionary desert unfolded.

Doudou and the little monk watched in astonishment as they were transported into the desert.

Also caught in the whirlwind was the innocent whale beneath Venerable White.

As the whale suddenly appeared in the desert, it froze in shock and instinctively began to struggle.

“Ah, my apologies for bringing you here. Don’t worry; we’ll be back shortly.” Venerable White spoke soothingly to the whale, patting it gently and casting a ‘floating spell’ on it. This spell would support the whale’s weight, preventing it from being crushed by its own mass.

Then, he poured a vast amount of spiritual energy into the one-time flying sword, version 004.

“Let’s go!” Venerable White formed a hand sign, remotely locking onto Scholar Song’s ‘Thousand Miles Escape Technique’ coordinates.
