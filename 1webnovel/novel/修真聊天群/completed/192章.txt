**A Quick Workout After Getting Out of the Car!**

“Scholar Song, you’re here!” Tu Bo sat on the bed, rubbing his red eyes—he was still feeling resentful. Back in the dorm, he used to be the one who could hold his liquor, effortlessly knocking down everyone, including Scholar Song and Gao Moumou. 

But at some point, Scholar Song’s drinking capacity skyrocketed, seemingly becoming bottomless. Ever since then, Tu Bo had never seen him get drunk. No matter how much he drank, Scholar Song maintained that “while everyone else is drunk, I alone am sober” demeanor.

Scholar Song held three servings of breakfast in his hands and smiled, “Yep, got up early! We can avoid the crowds while most of the students are still sleeping in.”

Yang De took the breakfast and replied, “I’m not heading home just yet. I have some business to take care of here.”

He had mentioned before that the software he developed in collaboration with others had been successful, and he needed to stay in Jiangnan University Town for a while due to a launch event during the summer.

“I’m planning to go somewhere with Mei Yi for a little getaway during the summer. I’ll just head straight to the airport instead of squeezing onto the subway with you guys,” Gao Moumou yawned.

Recently, Zhuge Zhongyang had been following him around like a shadow, leaving him and Mei Yi with no private time. Now that summer vacation had started, they secretly booked tickets, planning to zip away somewhere far to escape that pesky shadow.

“Yang De, since you’re staying in Jiangnan University Town, why not join me and Scholar Song for a visit to my grandpa’s place? It’ll only be a day or two, just to pick some berries or something,” Tu Bo suggested to Yang De.

The more friends he brought along to his grandpa's house, the better. If he accidentally annoyed his grandpa, having a bunch of classmates around would definitely soften the blow. Otherwise, if it was just Scholar Song, his grandpa might just smack him in front of his friend!

Yang De thought for a moment and nodded, “That sounds good.”

“Alright, so it’ll be Scholar Song, Yang De, and me heading to my grandpa’s place. Gao Moumou, you focus on your girlfriend instead,” Tu Bo laughed heartily and jumped off the bed.

Suddenly, he let out a scream, tears streaming down his face. He quickly lifted his foot and blew on it desperately.

Scholar Song looked confused, “What happened?”

“When did I hurt my foot?” Tu Bo stared at the sole of his foot, where a fresh burn mark was evident.

“Oh, I remember that scar,” Gao Moumou pushed up his glasses. “Last night, Tu Bo suddenly got up from bed, barefoot, and crawled to the window table to light a cigarette. I thought he had woken up, but he seemed still drunk. After he finished smoking, he tossed the butt on the floor and… I saw him instinctively lift his foot to stomp on it. Next thing I knew, he let out a scream that startled me. After screaming for a while, he crawled back to bed and went back to sleep. I thought he wasn’t hurt too badly.”

“Gao Moumou, you heartless jerk! You couldn’t even check on my injury?” Tu Bo felt like crying.

“Haha.” Gao Moumou adjusted his glasses, “You really think I’d run over in the middle of the night to check a guy’s foot? I’m not into that!”

Yang De nodded seriously and said, “Tu Bo, smoking is harmful to your health. Do you understand that now?”

“Understand this, you deadbeat!” Tu Bo said, tears flowing; his life was unfortunate, surrounded by such lousy friends.

“Given the situation, we can’t take the subway to your grandpa’s place anymore. Since it’s just the three of us, why don’t we take a taxi instead?” Yang De suggested.

“Looks like that’s the only option,” Tu Bo sighed with a bitter smile—taking a taxi would be expensive; the trip would take five hours.

“No worries, we don’t need to take a taxi. I borrowed a car from a friend, and we’ll drive there ourselves,” Scholar Song waved his hand with a smile.

“A friend? Oh, is it that friend who came to Jiangnan to visit you recently?” Tu Bo’s eyes lit up.

……

……

Ten minutes later, the three of them were ready.

Scholar Song and Yang De helped Tu Bo out of the car, bouncing slightly as they headed toward the parking lot.

“Safe travels~” Gao Moumou stood at the dormitory door, smiling and waving at the three of them.

They reached the small hatchback, and Scholar Song unlocked the car, helping Tu Bo inside before placing their luggage in the back.

As they got in, Tu Bo glanced at Scholar Song oddly.

Then Yang De and Tu Bo sat in the back seat together.

Scholar Song set the car’s navigation to J City’s Luoxin District, pressed the gas pedal, and they were off.

As they drove out of the campus, Tu Bo leaned over to Yang De and whispered, “Yang De, Scholar Song’s friend isn’t a girl, is she?”

“?” Yang De looked puzzled.

“The car he borrowed is called the ‘XY Yueliang Women’s Car,’ designed explicitly for women by a domestic car company. No man would buy this kind of car. So, Scholar Song has been staying out late these days to accompany a girl,” Tu Bo grinned mischievously.

Yang De suddenly understood and nodded!

Up front, Scholar Song was sweating bullets… Although Tu Bo spoke quietly, his ears were sharp enough to catch every word.

This was so unfair!

His knowledge about cars was limited to a few well-known brands; who would have thought the random car he picked would be a “women’s car”?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

The drive from Jiangnan University Town to Tu Bo’s grandpa’s place took about five hours. Luckily, the weather was decent, overcast with no sun, so it wouldn’t be too hot. Otherwise, by the time they arrived, they’d all be dried out from the heat.

Initially, Scholar Song planned to take turns driving with Tu Bo, but since Tu Bo’s foot was injured, he was the only one behind the wheel.

In the back seat, Tu Bo and Yang De had prepared plenty of snacks, chatting and joking.

Time passed slowly… they took a break halfway through.

After four and a half hours, they finally approached J City’s Luoxin District.

Tu Bo and Yang De were starting to doze off.

At that moment, Scholar Song suddenly slammed on the brakes, pulling the car over to the side of the road.

Tu Bo rubbed his eyes and asked, “Are we there yet?”

But when he turned his head, he found they were still on a road at the foot of a mountain. This was the road leading to the village of Luoxin District, still over ten minutes away from their destination.

Not there yet?

He looked at Scholar Song with confusion.

“Yep, we’ll be there soon. You guys can catch a few more Z’s; I’m just a bit tired from driving and need to get out and stretch,” Scholar Song turned his head and grinned at Tu Bo.

“That makes sense; you’ve been driving for four or five hours straight. Sorry about that, if my foot wasn’t hurt, we could’ve switched drivers,” Tu Bo chuckled.

“Not a problem,” Scholar Song shrugged, shaking out his arms and twisting his neck.

His gaze fell on a spot about twenty meters ahead on the road.

There, a shadowy, ghostly figure loomed in the middle of the road, exuding an eerie, chilling aura.

It was a towering man clad in ancient soldier armor, wearing a terrifying mask, with long silver hair flowing behind him. Thick chains were tied around his hands, and the other ends of the chains held two blood-stained sabers.

Surrounding this man, Tu Bo could faintly see shards of glass from vehicles and some plastic parts, remnants of a car accident that had yet to be cleaned up.

“Is that a ghost?” Scholar Song murmured.

Because it was overcast, there was no sun, so even during the day, ghosts could appear on the road without fear?

As he pondered, the imposing ghostly figure’s gaze swept towards Scholar Song. But it didn’t seem interested in him, turning its attention back to the parked car by the roadside. Its mission appeared to be causing accidents on this stretch of road.

It was merely a low-tier ghost soldier. Scholar Song sensed its aura and confirmed its level. However, he couldn’t rule out the possibility that this ghost was hiding its true strength.

Scholar Song walked straight up to the ghost soldier. The ghost towered at two meters tall, making Scholar Song look like a kid standing next to it.

The ghost soldier continued to look down at Scholar Song, still not making a move.

Low-tier ghost soldiers lacked much intelligence; once tamed, they mechanically executed their master’s commands with little initiative.

“Fundamental Fist Technique, Volume One!”

Scholar Song channeled his vitality and blood force from his heart and eyes into his right fist, delivering a powerful uppercut to the ghost’s chin.

“Ugh—” The burly ghost soldier was sent flying, crashing heavily to the ground with a mournful wail.

This ghost was just a low-tier soldier, its strength comparable to a newly awakened cultivator!

Scholar Song stepped forward, his pace appearing slow but actually swift as lightning—using the “Gentleman’s Journey” movement technique!

In the blink of an eye, he was before the towering ghost soldier.

The ghost hadn’t even had time to get up when Scholar Song swung his fist again, raining blows down on the ghost’s head. Each punch landed with a thud, while his knee pressed against the ghost’s chest, preventing it from rising.

Three breaths later… Scholar Song smashed the ghost’s head, causing it to dissipate into a cloud of black smoke.

At that moment, the Phantom Spirit in Scholar Song’s chest emerged, half of its body visible. It grabbed the smoke and swallowed it whole, then smacked its lips in satisfaction.

“Hmm?” Scholar Song looked at the Phantom Spirit in confusion. Could it restore energy by consuming ghostly beings?

He hadn’t yet synchronized with the Phantom Spirit, and their ‘consciousness connection’ was still intermittent, so he couldn’t grasp its current thoughts.

However, knowing that the Phantom Spirit could consume ghostly beings to restore energy, this trip to Luoxin District should allow it to feast well.

Withdrawing his fist, Scholar Song exhaled deeply.

Luoxin District in J City was indeed facing problems. Ghostly beings were brazenly causing accidents on the road—was it the handiwork of the “Lord’s subordinates,” or were these wandering ghosts or rogue spirits?

Regardless of the force at play, taking down this ghost soldier would surely attract attention.

Soon enough, the “Lord’s” subordinates would probably come to investigate. When they did, he could follow the trail and uncover the truth!

……

……

In the car, Tu Bo watched Scholar Song throw punches at the air and then take a few steps forward, wildly punching at the ground as if he were beating someone up, looking possessed.

“Seriously, is he just building up this much stress after only five hours of driving?” Tu Bo wiped his forehead; Scholar Song couldn’t be trying to hit him, could he?

At that moment, Scholar Song hummed a tune as he returned to the car, “Alright, let’s go!”

Tu Bo offered a flattering smile, “Scholar Song, you’ve worked hard! I’ll call my grandpa and let him know we’re almost there.”

The car started up again, heading toward the village of Luoxin District.

Tu Bo called his grandpa: “Hey, Grandpa. I’m coming with Scholar Song and another classmate, Yang De. We’ll be home in about ten minutes.”

“Did you take a taxi?” his grandpa’s voice came through, though it sounded a bit weaker than two days ago.

“We drove ourselves,” Tu Bo answered.

“Be careful on the road, especially on the mountain path leading into the village. There have been three traffic accidents there in the past few days,” his grandpa advised.

“Don’t worry, we’ve already passed that section,” Tu Bo laughed, glancing at Scholar Song.

What a coincidence; Scholar Song had stopped there to stretch for quite a while!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Ten minutes later, Scholar Song parked the car in Tu Bo’s grandpa’s yard.

Tu Bo’s grandpa had been waiting at the door for their arrival.

As the car door opened, Tu Bo got out first and gave his grandpa a big hug. Yang De followed, rubbing his eyes as he exited the car, and Scholar Song parked and locked up before joining them.

“Grandpa, let me introduce you. This is my roommate Li Yang De, and you’ve met Scholar Song before,” Tu Bo said with a smile.

“Welcome, welcome!” Tu Bo’s grandpa greeted Scholar Song and Li Yang De warmly.

However, after Scholar Song parked and locked the car, Tu Bo’s grandpa glanced at the vehicle, a hint of disappointment flickering in his heart. Where was that mysterious girl he had been hoping to see?

He had recalled the strange events happening in the village and immediately thought of Tu Bo’s classmates because of that mysterious girl who came with Scholar Song.

But now that Scholar Song was here, where was that girl? It was hard not to feel a bit let down. Of course, Tu Bo’s grandpa quickly shook off that disappointment.

He had invited Tu Bo to bring his classmates over, and he couldn’t lose his courtesy.

Scholar Song also warmly hugged Tu Bo’s grandpa, “Grandpa, we’re here to visit again!”

Tu Bo’s grandpa laughed heartily; he quite liked this polite junior.

While hugging, however, Scholar Song furrowed his brow slightly.

Tu Bo’s grandpa carried a trace of ghostly energy, a remnant from an encounter with a ghost recently.

Looking at Tu Bo’s grandpa’s weakness, it seemed he had lost some vitality from a ghostly being recently.

After releasing Tu Bo’s grandpa, Scholar Song looked around… Although he couldn’t see, he could feel through his spiritual sense that the area was steeped in ghostly energy.

There was a significant presence of ghost activity in the skies above Luoxin District. Normally, these traces would vanish under sunlight, but with the overcast skies today, some ghostly remnants lingered on…
