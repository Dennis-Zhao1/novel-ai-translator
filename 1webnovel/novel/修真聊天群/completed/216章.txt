**Chapter 1: A Flight of Wishes**

"Did you think you could fly to space in a helicopter? Haha!"

If there ever came a day when I could pilot a supersonic jet through the skies, I would truly have no regrets about dying.

This was once a dream of Little Li.

Today, however, it seemed like fate was in a generous mood, ready to grant him two wishes all at once—his first wish of taking a ride in the co-pilot seat of a supersonic jet, and his second wish of dying without regrets, as he was about to kick the bucket!

Tears welled in Little Li's eyes.

In that moment, as the helicopter's rotor blades shattered, the glass of the cockpit couldn't withstand the sonic boom pressure, beginning to splinter. Parts of the fuselage joyfully detached, flinging themselves away.

This was merely what Little Li could see from his angle. Out of sight, at the rear of the helicopter, a disaster movie was unfolding—its tail had completely disintegrated, sparks flying everywhere, smoke billowing all around.

Now, only the semi-circular shell of the helicopter remained… and it had lost a lot of its panels.

Due to the extensive damage, the helicopter had lost its power and was retreating from the state of 'supersonic.'

Moments earlier, the helicopter had been moving so quickly that debris from the disintegration had vanished without a trace.

Little Li, the instructor, squeezed his eyes shut in agony. Although he had signed a hefty insurance policy before boarding, ensuring his family would receive a massive payout in case of an accident, he had even mentally prepared himself for the possibility of sacrificing his life.

But when death truly approached, all that filled his heart was terror!

He realized he wasn't as strong as he had imagined. His so-called 'courage to face death' was built on the premise of 'there’s still a chance to survive.'

When confronted with a situation where survival seemed impossible, all his bravado and bravery evaporated.

Little Li burst into tears, "Mom! I don’t want to die! Boohoo… I’m still so young; I don’t want to die so early!"

It’s said that real men rarely shed tears unless they’re truly heartbroken.

But now, knowing he was about to crash and die, he had no shame left to worry about—he let himself cry freely.

And so, Little Li cried his heart out.

"Tsk... this helicopter is even flimsier than I thought," Venerable White murmured, clearly displeased. Without any further ado, several invisible sword energies shot from his body.

The sword energies melted the shattered glass—yes, melted, not shattered! Not a single shard left behind!

Then, the energies spread out in all directions.

In places unseen by Scholar Song and Little Li, the helicopter’s rotor, tail, armor, and other components were all struck by the invisible sword energies, shattering into dust midair.

This way, they avoided the risk of these helicopter parts falling and causing harm to those below.

At the same time, a protective shield activated around Venerable White, safeguarding the remnants of the helicopter, acting like the helicopter’s outer shell and glass.

…

At that moment, Scholar Song swiftly removed his 'spacesuit' helmet and placed it on the unfortunate Little Li’s head, activating the oxygen supply to prevent him from suffocating due to lack of air.

Little Li managed to lift his head slightly, gazing at Scholar Song with gratitude—yet he couldn’t help but let out a sigh. What was the use of this spacesuit helmet? The helicopter was in such a state, they were destined to plummet.

"Grandma, see you in heaven!" Little Li shouted one last time, his head lolling to the side… and he fainted.

Scholar Song found himself torn between laughter and tears at Little Li’s antics.

"Well, it's fine if he’s passed out; he can just consider it a bad dream when he wakes up." Scholar Song thought to himself.

He glanced at the wrecked helicopter beneath them and felt a wave of relief—considering the damage, there was no way they could continue on. This meant Venerable White's plan to chase after the other flying cultivator had to come to an end, right?

Scholar Song spoke up, "Senior, with the rotor gone, the helicopter has lost all power. Shouldn't we evacuate?"

"…" Venerable White looked speechless, his face clearly showing reluctance.

Scholar Song used his silver tongue to its fullest, continuing to persuade, "This time it’s the helicopter’s quality that failed us. Even if we can’t catch up to that flying cultivator, it’s not our fault. If we switch to a better quality aircraft, we could easily surpass him!"

"Yeah, this helicopter's quality is indeed too poor. We should’ve taken a jet fighter instead," Venerable White lamented.

"It’s alright; we can learn to fly a jet fighter next time. Let’s just abandon this one for now?" Scholar Song clenched his fist secretly, feeling success was within reach!

"Um… but we shouldn’t give up until the very last moment!" Venerable White suddenly changed his tone, filled with fervor.

Scholar Song hurriedly advised, "No, Senior. Sometimes, giving up is also a form of courage!"

"It’s fine; we haven’t reached the point where we must give up," Venerable White said as he stood from the pilot’s seat, crouching down to draw a series of formation symbols on the helicopter’s deck.

The formation was one Venerable White was clearly very familiar with, one he had drawn countless times.

Scholar Song recognized it too.

As the formation neared completion, Scholar Song realized—wasn’t this the formation on Venerable White’s prized 'One-time Flying Sword Version 004'? A little while back, Venerable White had casually carved a branch into a flying sword by infusing it with spiritual energy.

Could it be that Venerable White planned to turn this helicopter shell into a One-time Flying Sword Version 004?

Wasn’t that a bit too extravagant?

Could something like this even be done?

Transforming a wooden sword into a one-time flying sword was already unbelievable, but if this massive helicopter shell could also become a one-time flying sword… Holy crap, it actually transformed!

Just like that, it changed, defying all expectations.

Venerable White etched the final symbol, clapped his hands in satisfaction, and infused spiritual energy into the formation, completing the creation of the "One-time Flying Sword Version 004."

The entire helicopter shell emitted a soft humming sound, akin to the sound of a sword vibrating.

"Just as I imagined, it’s quite easy!" Venerable White clapped his hands in satisfaction. "Scholar Song, hold on tight. We’re taking off again!"

Scholar Song quickly grabbed the seat.

Venerable White formed a sword seal and shouted, "Let’s go!"

Whoosh!

The helicopter shot forward.

Even without its rotor and many essential helicopter parts, this modified 'supersonic helicopter' was airborne once more.

And its speed? Unbelievably fast.

"Hahaha, incredible!" Venerable White beamed with pride, then infused more spiritual energy into the 'Enhanced Qingfeng Acceleration Formation' beside him: "Tenfold speed!"

The helicopter version of the one-time flying sword’s velocity soared again… soon, it shattered the sound barrier for the second time.

Scholar Song sighed inwardly; whatever, let Venerable White enjoy himself!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

The Wind Blade Swordsman Yang Yuxiang was gradually slowing his sword flight. Although he had surpassed that helicopter earlier, the helicopter was moving at a snail's pace, leaving him utterly devoid of any sense of victory.

What a letdown! Even a helicopter should at least reach a speed of 150 kilometers per hour!

However, the people inside that helicopter were quite amusing, especially the one in the back seat, who was completely encased in a bulky spacesuit. It was hilarious.

Did he really think he could reach outer space in a helicopter? Hahaha, how ridiculous!

"Well, whatever. I’ll just find an air force base soon. That feeling of racing against a supersonic fighter jet last time was absolutely the best!" Wind Blade Swordsman Yang Yuxiang stretched lazily, ready to speed up again in search of a flying target.

Suddenly… Yang Yuxiang sensed something strange behind him.

He swiftly turned around and witnessed a scene he would never forget.

An aircraft… well, it was probably a helicopter? It was rapidly approaching him!

Speed aside; the main point was the helicopter’s appearance!

The rotor, tail, and supports were all gone—just an empty shell, and even the glass was missing! The tail was still smoking.

How could this thing still be flying? And at such a fast pace, nearing Mach 2?

Yang Yuxiang felt an urge to roar at the helicopter: What kind of physics and dynamics allow you to fly so nonchalantly?!

Before he could even finish his thoughts, the helicopter was almost upon him. Yang Yuxiang finally caught a clear glimpse of the people inside.

A handsome man was striking a pose as if he were piloting the aircraft—except it was all for naught, as all the instruments were dark and unresponsive.

In the co-pilot seat, there was a man who had fainted for some unknown reason.

And in the back was a guy he couldn’t forget—dressed in a spacesuit.

The handsome man locked eyes with Wind Blade Swordsman Yang Yuxiang and grinned, crossing his hands in a cultivator's gesture.

Yang Yuxiang recognized that hand gesture well, as he often posed like this himself.

This gesture was typically used by two cultivators racing against each other—oh no… racing swords! It didn’t hold any special significance; it simply said, “You’re weak, come race me in speed if you dare!”

A provocative gesture indeed.

The man in the spacesuit shrugged apologetically at Yang Yuxiang, a sheepish smile on his face.

"Ha! You want to race me in speed? Just what I wanted!" Yang Yuxiang smirked coldly. "I’m the three-time champion of the Sword Flight Competition—Wind Blade Swordsman Yang Yuxiang!"

Yang Yuxiang assumed a starting position on his flying sword and waited for the bizarre helicopter to draw closer.

Once the helicopter was level with him, Yang Yuxiang let out a long shout, pouring all his energy into the flying sword!

Let them see the power of the three-time champion of the Sword Flight Competition; they’d soon understand the vast speed difference between us!

Ah?
