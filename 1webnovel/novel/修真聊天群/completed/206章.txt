**Scholar Song's Harvest and Unease!**

“????” Fay Yu from Lingdie Island was filled with question marks. Hadn’t the three seniors just returned from the mysterious island?

Then, Wild Blade of Three Tides popped up cheerfully, “Fay Yu, are you coming with us? That would be awesome! Plus, you can let the respected Lingdie know that with the three of us around, we’ll keep you safe, so she can rest easy!”

Next came a message from Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake.

Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake: “If Fay Yu is joining, let’s set a place to meet. The three of us have prepared a lot for this trip to the mysterious island, including spells, magical artifacts, and modern equipment. Just choose a spot to meet us, and we’ll get you geared up. That way, once we enter the island, you won’t have to worry about memory loss. Even if you do forget, as long as the spells and equipment are intact, we should be able to find some clues.”

As soon as Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake finished speaking, the seniors in the group began chiming in.

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain quickly asked, “Three Tides, forget the date—tell me what day it is today?”

“June 17th, of course! That’s the day we agreed to set out,” Wild Blade of Three Tides replied promptly.

Upon hearing this, Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake immediately clicked on his computer’s date tab: “Wait, it’s July 8, 2019?!”

The Hermit of North River also caught on: “July 8, 2019? Did we three experience memory loss?”

“Memory loss +1,” said the Dharma King of Creation.

“Memory loss +2,” chimed in the Master of Snow Wolf Cavern gleefully.

“+3,” added the Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram with a smug emoji.

“And it’s a big problem,” the owner of Seven Life Talismans interjected. “The memory you three lost is even more exaggerated than what the Alchemical Sage’s two companions experienced—they at least remembered entering the mysterious island; they just forgot what happened there. After waking up, they found themselves inexplicably on a deserted beach. But you three? Your memories were cut off right at ‘before departure’!”

The Alchemical Sage added, “And after you left the island, you didn’t even end up on a beach; instead, you all went straight home! I want to know—did you three sleepwalk back to your caves after losing your memories?”

One could imagine the three of them emerging from the mysterious island with zero memories.

Then they returned to their caves, opened their computers, and innocently thought they hadn’t even set out yet, so they started making plans to ‘battle the mysterious island’ again.

Hypothetically—if the Hermit of North River, Wild Blade of Three Tides, and Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake returned from this trip and no one reminded them of their amnesia, they might end up having the following conversation.

Hermit of North River: “Hey Three Tides, Ancient Lake, how about we explore the mysterious island together?”

Wild Blade of Three Tides: “Count me in!”

Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake: “I’m in too; I’ll prepare some gear.”

And just like that, the three would venture back to the mysterious island… only to lose their memories again.

……

……

Twenty days later.

The three contacted each other again, still muddled.

Hermit of North River: “I say, brothers, how about we go on another adventure to the mysterious island?”

Wild Blade of Three Tides: “Count me in!”

Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake: “Let’s go together, I’ll get some gear ready. Huh, why does this conversation sound so familiar?”

Then, the three would head back to the mysterious island, only to lose their memories once more.

Would this cycle continue?

Of course, the chances of that happening were slim, unless all three of them lost track of time!

“……” Fay Yu quietly touched her chest, a bit frightened. If these three powerful seniors lost their memories going to the mysterious island, what would happen to her if she went? Would she lose her memories completely, like being reborn? Oh dear, should I just stay at home?

At that moment, the drunken moon scholar casually remarked, “Didn’t you three prepare various measures to deal with memory loss? Why don’t you pull out your spells, artifacts, and modern devices to see what you experienced on the mysterious island?”

Hermit of North River: “I’m checking, but all the spells we had lost their effects.”

Wild Blade of Three Tides added, “The reconnaissance artifacts we carried also malfunctioned; everything it recorded is just a black screen.”

Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake: “The needle-type cameras did manage to capture a few images.”

Then, Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake shared the images from the electronic camera in the group chat.

First… were the faces of Hermit of North River and Wild Blade of Three Tides. This should have been from June 19, the day the three discovered the mysterious island and gathered to prepare to enter.

Next were a few blurry images of the island—lakes and forests—but nothing useful could be gleaned from them.

Finally, there were images of Hermit of North River looking dazed and Wild Blade of Three Tides appearing half-asleep.

These should have been taken after the three emerged from the mysterious island and were heading back to their homes. However, none of these images were in their memories.

As the images were posted, Venerable White commented in the group, “Interesting.”

“Eh? Venerable White is interested in this mysterious island too?” Scholar Song turned to ask.

What he saw was quite a comical scene. Venerable White had stuffed his cheeks with seven or eight bayberries, both cheeks bulging.

“Pfft.” He spat the seeds into a trash can like bullets.

“I’m very interested in this mysterious island, but… I just can’t find it,” Venerable White replied. “I heard about the mysterious island a long time ago and searched for it many times. But every time I walked for a bit, I’d get lost—I just can’t find that island. I’ve looked for it three or four times, then I got too lazy to keep searching.”

Venerable White can’t find the island? Could his luck be working against him?

Because if Venerable White were to find that little island, he would lose his memories, so his innate luck might be preventing him from entering that mysterious island?

It seemed that the mysterious island was truly not a good place. Scholar Song thought to himself that he would try to dissuade Fay Yu from going there!

With that thought, he turned back to read the chat logs, flipping to the next page.

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain: “Are there no other clues?”

Hermit of North River: “I only have a few blurry images from my needle camera, and they’re pretty much the same as what Ancient Lake shared, just from my angle.”

Wild Blade of Three Tides: “Same here—what a joke, not even a single trace of memory left. And I didn’t even notice anything!”

Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake: “@Alchemical Sage, have you figured out the reason for the memory loss of those two friends and their disciples?”

Alchemical Sage: “I’ve made some progress. Those two friends and their disciples actively signed a sort of ‘contract’ with a certain powerful entity, sealing their memories! If nothing unexpected happened, your situation should be similar. When can you three come over? I’ll check it for you.”

Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake: “Alchemical Sage, is there a way to break the memory seal now?”

“No way, that contract requires a specific ‘trigger’ to be released. But nobody knows what kind of contract you signed with the powerful being on the mysterious island, and what that trigger is, except for you. Trying to forcibly remove the seal might damage your memories, causing you to permanently lose them,” Alchemical Sage replied rapidly, clearly with Jiang Ziyan typing for him.

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain fell silent for a moment before asking, “Alchemical Sage, keep looking for solutions for the memory loss. This contract-type memory seal won’t greatly affect your cultivation. Now, check again—did you gain anything from this trip to the mysterious island?”

Right, since they entered that mysterious island, even if they lost their memories, they couldn’t have come back empty-handed, right?

Hermit of North River: “I already checked myself; I found two small spiritual herbs in my pocket. What a loss!”

Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake: “Better than me—I only ended up with a piece of cold iron… that’s everywhere. I lost my memories and wasted so much time for just a piece of cold iron. My heart aches! Three Tides, what about you?”

Wild Blade of Three Tides: “……”

“Three Tides, you didn’t end up with nothing, did you?” the Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram asked curiously. “Before you entered the mysterious island, I specifically calculated for you, and I predicted you’d have good fortune this time.”

“……” Wild Blade of Three Tides was silent for a moment before suddenly asking, “Diviner, where are you now?”

“Currently in Huaxi, doing divination,” the Master Diviner replied.

“I see… I’ll come find you right away!” Wild Blade of Three Tides sent a gritting-teeth emoji.

Clearly, from the divination, it was evident that Wild Blade of Three Tides had come back empty-handed. Even if he had a piece of cold iron, he wouldn’t be this furious.

“……” Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram.

“Hahaha, you who read black omens, just wait!” Hermit of North River burst into laughter.

The Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram coldly retorted, “Hmph, a month and a half from now, at the Summit of the Forbidden Purple, let’s see if you’re still laughing.”

“That’s exactly what I want to tell you! I, North River, will definitely be the last one laughing!” Hermit of North River said confidently, feeling assured of victory.

Next, the seniors in the group began updating Hermit of North River, Wild Blade of Three Tides, and Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake about the major events and news that had happened over the past ten days.

Scholar Song nodded silently at this and murmured, “It’s decided; I will never go near that mysterious island!”

“Eh? I actually hope you go look for that mysterious island! Who knows, you might bring back some memories and let me know what’s inside. I’m quite curious!” Venerable White casually remarked.

Scholar Song’s body stiffened—was this just Venerable White casually saying something? It couldn’t be considered a ‘blessing from Venerable White,’ right?

That said, he still felt uneasy. His hands unconsciously pulled back to the chat log, glancing once more at the few blurry images of the mysterious island shared by Immortal Sage of Ancient Lake.
