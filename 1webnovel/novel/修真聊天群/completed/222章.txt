**The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain was deeply troubled!**

Grinding his teeth, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain said in a low voice, “Keep a close watch on that Pekingese in the helicopter. And... don’t let it have any chance to come into contact with other aircraft! Once it’s finished this flight, keep it grounded and don’t let it move. I’ll send someone to handle the other matters.”

He hoped that this time, Dou Dou wouldn’t cause too much chaos.

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain wasn’t worried about the flight school people filming and posting it online. 

If someone filmed a Pekingese flying a plane, anyone who saw it online would likely dismiss it as a computer effect, or assume it was for a movie promotional stunt.

Moreover, even if a major uproar did occur, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain had ways to resolve it—after all, this wasn’t Dou Dou’s first time causing trouble. How naive! Dou Dou had previously stirred up countless situations, and each time, it was the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain who quietly cleaned up after it. He had long since become experienced in dealing with such messes.

At the flight school, Cassie let out a sigh of relief after hearing the Immortal Sage’s instructions and immediately set about following his orders.

After hanging up the phone, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain quickly dialed Scholar Song.

Soon, a friendly automated voice greeted him on the other end: “We’re sorry, but the number you’ve dialed is currently out of service, _redial_later.”

Out of service? Did they really go to space?

With both Scholar Song and Venerable White unavailable, how was he supposed to get Dou Dou down from the helicopter?

He did have a team specifically trained to handle Dou Dou’s antics, but they were currently a bit far from Dou Dou’s location.

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain sighed in frustration.

……

Twenty minutes later, Venerable White skillfully piloted the aircraft-shaped sword back through the atmosphere, returning to Earth. 

Although space was beautiful and breathtaking, it was undeniably comforting to be back on Earth, Scholar Song thought to himself.

“Senior, where are we?” Scholar Song casually asked, as with his current eyesight, all he could make out were vague outlines of tall buildings and clusters of lights below.

And it was night down there?

He remembered that when he and Venerable White had gone to learn about flying, it had still been morning.

“I don’t know. I just picked a spot to dive into after seeing Earth. We’ll figure out where we are once we descend a bit more,” Venerable White replied casually.

After a while, as they descended to a lower altitude, Scholar Song quickly spotted a very prominent structure below.

It was a tall statue of a goddess, dressed in ancient Greek-style clothing.

The statue wore a crown with seven sharp spikes, raised a torch high in her right hand, and held a law book in her left. Beneath her feet lay shattered handcuffs, shackles, and chains.

“The Statue of Liberty?” Scholar Song broke out in a cold sweat. How did they end up in America?

Venerable White steadied the aircraft-shaped sword and looked up and down at the statue before saying, “Oh, so this is the famous Statue of Liberty from the internet. It’s quite ugly!”

“Ugly? No way! I think this statue looks pretty good,” Scholar Song replied, stroking his chin. He was a complete novice when it came to art, but from his perspective, he couldn’t call the statue ugly at all.

As he spoke, Scholar Song turned to look at Venerable White—wait a minute. Was Venerable White’s standard for judging ‘beauty’ based on himself? If that were the case, then this Statue of Liberty must be hideously ugly.

Realizing this, Scholar Song suddenly leaned forward and asked, “Senior, do you think I’m handsome?”

Venerable White paused for a moment before bursting into laughter. “Scholar Song, are you under the impression that my aesthetic standards are high? Not at all! My taste is pretty much in line with the average person’s… maybe just a tad above. From my perspective, you’re not bad-looking—not ugly.”

“Really? Just not ugly? I actually feel like I’ve been a bit handsome lately,” Scholar Song said, stroking his chin.

Venerable White: “…”

“Hahaha! But now that I know we’re in America, it’ll be easier to get home. If we go straight in that direction, we can reach Middle Land,” Scholar Song said, pointing toward China with a hearty laugh.

“Got it, let’s head out then.” Venerable White winked, forming a hand seal, and the aircraft-shaped sword roared to life, speeding toward Middle Land.

……

During the flight, Scholar Song grew bored and decided to pull out his phone to try connecting to the internet. With a hefty phone balance, international data charges were nothing to worry about.

Next, Scholar Song uploaded several photos to the Ninefold Land One group chat.

First were the photos of Venerable White diligently repairing the hole in the space station, where Venerable White was all focused, connecting pipes and wires, completely absorbed in his work.

Caption: “Venerable White working hard to repair the space station’s hole in the universe.”

Just as Scholar Song posted the pictures, he hadn’t even had time to refresh the group chat when a flurry of comments from the seniors began to pop up.

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain: “Scholar Song, you really went to space? No wonder I couldn’t reach you when I called earlier.”

The Hermit of North River quickly followed up: “I’m more curious about how you and Venerable White suddenly went to space to repair a space station. What happened?”

The Master of Seven Lives explained: “Haha, I remember today was when Scholar Song and Venerable White were supposed to learn about flying.”

The Wild Blade of Three Tides: “Daring to learn to fly with Venerable White? Tsk tsk, that’s practically asking for death! Who else in the world could fly an ordinary plane into space except for Venerable White? Scholar Song, I recommend you get life insurance; you’ll definitely need it.”

The Drunken Moon Scholar: “I see, so you went to learn flying and ended up in space. By the way, Brother Sanlang, I feel the one in a perilous spot isn’t Scholar Song but you! Don’t you know that Venerable White has also joined the Ninefold Land One group? Haha.”

The Alchemical Sage: “Haha.”

The Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram: “Haha!”

Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan: “Haha!”

“Go to hell!” The Wild Blade of Three Tides yelled in frustration. “Venerable White is in the group now; will he see my previous comment? Damn it, how do I delete comments? Stop laughing and tell me how to delete it!”

The Dharma King of Creation: “Haha, I don’t know how to delete it, but I can teach you a method: you can try searching online for how to delete comments.”

The Master of Snow Wolf Cavern: “Haha, I know how to delete it, but I don’t want to tell you.”

The Wild Blade of Three Tides: “You bastards! If I catch you, you’ll feel the edge of my seventy-two swift blades!”

The Hermit of North River: “I say, are we focusing on the wrong thing? I just looked at the photos again and noticed a big problem—how did that huge hole in the space station appear?”

“I can’t believe it, yeah, how did that hole get there?” The Master of Seven Lives added with a dumbfounded expression.

The Alchemical Sage: “@Scholar Song, I have the same question.”

At that moment, an ID suddenly popped up.

Venerable White: “It was my fault. I accidentally crashed the helicopter into it, haha, but I fixed it!”

“Venerable White is awesome!” The Wild Blade of Three Tides quickly flattered, as he had just managed to delete his previous comment and seeing Venerable White had appeared, he wanted to throw some sweet words at him first.

“Yeah, Sanlang. I saw your comment earlier,” Venerable White replied with an embarrassed smiley. “I saw it before you deleted it.”

The Wild Blade of Three Tides: “…”

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain chimed in, changing the subject: “Ahem, Venerable White, where are you and Scholar Song right now? I need to talk to him about something.”

Scholar Song: “We should be in America? We’re on our way back to Middle Land. Did you need something, Immortal Sage?”

“Yeah.” The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain sighed. “If possible, I’d like to ask you and Venerable White to head back to the flight school as soon as possible.”

Venerable White: “What happened?”

“Dou Dou is flying a plane!” Although it was just a short sentence, the weight of the Immortal Sage’s words conveyed a deep sense of melancholy that everyone in the group felt...

“That’s impossible! Dou Dou was supposed to stay home and guard the house!” Scholar Song instinctively replied.

But as soon as he sent that message, he suddenly remembered something.

He reached into his pocket, where he had previously kept a piece of Dou Dou’s fur. But now, the fur was nowhere to be found.

Dou Dou!

Scholar Song couldn’t help but laugh and cry at the same time.

“Dou Dou must have used some sort of spell to sneakily follow you. Sigh, once you catch it, feel free to hit or scold it; just give it a good lesson!” The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain said angrily.

Hit or scold it as I please? But the problem is, can I even handle Dou Dou?

“I understand. Venerable White and I will rush back as quickly as possible,” Scholar Song replied.

After closing the group chat, Scholar Song looked over at Venerable White.

Venerable White chuckled, “Alright, hold on tight.”

“Sky-Peng Escape Technique!”

The helicopter shell sprouted a pair of Sky-Peng wings, and with a gentle flap, the aircraft-shaped sword entered supersonic mode, rapidly soaring toward Middle Land.

Meanwhile, aboard the space station...

The 'Alliance' spacecraft successfully docked with the space station, preparing to bring two astronauts, Akuro and Anthony, back to Earth.

“Where are Anthony and Akuro? Why aren’t they responding to us?”

“Let’s just go in and check. These two wouldn’t still be doing experiments, would they? The last time I picked up Anthony, he suddenly remembered an experiment he hadn’t finished and wouldn’t come out of the lab.”

A moment later.

“I found them! Oh my god, Akuro and Anthony are unconscious!”

“What’s going on? Damn it, what happened on the space station? Quick, check the video records.”

“The video records have been deleted. All the footage from the last few hours is gone; what’s going on?”

“Oh my god, there’s a huge hole in the space station… wait, it looks like it’s been repaired?”

“Enough talking, let’s get Akuro and Anthony back to Earth first. Once they wake up, we’ll find out what happened.”

The space station was thrown into chaos...
