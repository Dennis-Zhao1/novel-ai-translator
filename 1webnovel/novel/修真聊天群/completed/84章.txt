**Underground Metro No-Holds-Barred Fighting Tournament**

As the Western monk chanted his sutras, a faint golden glow emanated from the Buddhist scripture in his hands, creating an aura of solemnity and sanctity that would be perceived as divine by ordinary people.

However, for any cultivator with awakened senses present, they would witness the monk’s massive mental energy guiding the scripture’s physical form, where the verses transformed into tangible golden runes, each about the size of a fingernail, flying forth like a deluge toward the vengeful spirits ahead.

The illusions created by the ghost commander, Ku You, met the onslaught of the scripture runes, and immediately, they were dispersed like smoke blown away by a strong wind.

As the illusions dissipated, the passengers in the train car remained in a state of confusion—unlike Scholar Song’s car, they had been enveloped in illusions for too long, partially drained of their energy by Ku You, leaving them dazed and disoriented.

“Eep…” Ku You emitted a sharp cry and retreated repeatedly. Having barely regained some energy, it was once again dissolved by the Western monk, leaving its form even weaker than before.

At this rate, in just half an hour, it would be completely purified by the monk and turned to ashes.

“Damn those foreigners!” The two men who arrived from behind were nearly overwhelmed by rage at the sight.

One of them, a white-collar worker, took a deep breath, and in the next moment, his muscles bulged, bursting the seams of his fitted suit. If not for the unchanged skin color, he could easily be mistaken for the Hulk.

Transformed, he was now twice as muscular as the Western monk, though a bit shorter. He charged forward like a battering ram, crashing into the monk.

Along his path, ordinary passengers were sent flying…

His companion was quite cooperative; just before the transformation, he threw out eight needle-like projectiles, shattering all the surveillance cameras in the subway.

Even the most nefarious ghost cultivators didn’t want to expose themselves brazenly before the public eye—after all, the passengers in the car were still in a dazed state, so it was no issue.

With the cameras destroyed, the ordinary-looking man gripped a bone artifact in his hand, preparing to manipulate Ku You.

The ghost’s intelligence was not high, and while free, it could only exert about fifty to sixty percent of its power. However, under someone’s control, its lethality would double.

The ordinary-looking man used the bone artifact to command Ku You, instructing it not to engage the Western monk directly and waste energy. Ku You retracted the energy used for illusions, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

At the same time, the ordinary man produced a small vial containing the ashes of a low-tier Flame Ghost.

The term “Flame Ghost” referred to vengeful spirits that died by fire, contrasting with Water Ghosts. A Flame Ghost needed to be a martial artist with strong vitality, who suffered great injustice before being burned alive, to have a chance of forming.

Low-tier Flame Ghosts had very low intelligence and only attacked like rabid dogs. However, through its ashes, the man could control its targets.

As he opened the vial, the Flame Ghost sprang forth. This low-tier vengeful spirit lacked a fixed form, merely a ball of burning ghostly fire, but it moved at incredible speed.

The ordinary-looking man commanded the Flame Ghost to attack the Western monk.

With a fierce roar, the Flame Ghost rushed towards its target, its speed many times faster than the transformed white-collar worker, arriving at the monk’s back.

The monk sensed the approaching Flame Ghost, a smirk of disdain curling at the corner of his mouth, while he continued reciting his sutras.

Boom!

The Flame Ghost collided with the monk.

Yet, the monk remained unscathed—though he had no hair.

At that moment, a thick layer of golden light separated the Flame Ghost from the monk, absorbing all of its attack!

When that golden light flared to life, it was as if the heavens were declaring the numerous merits of the monk’s past deeds to the world. The light of merit surrounded him, rendering him impervious to all evil!

What the hell, how many vengeful spirits and souls has this monk saved in his lifetime?

The ordinary-looking man was taken aback.

One must know that saving a hundred souls could be deemed as merit; saving a thousand would grant one the protection of merit’s light. The thick layer of merit surrounding this monk suggested he had saved at least ten thousand souls!

Knowing he had the protection of merit, ordinary small spirits could not harm him, which was why the monk stood so confidently, allowing the Flame Ghost to crash into him.

Damn it, why is this foreign monk so dedicated? Local monks don’t even have this much merit, right? Nowadays, there are very few high monks in the Middle Land who have saved over ten thousand souls.

The ordinary-looking man hastily commanded the Flame Ghost to retreat. With such a thick layer of merit light, there was no need to embarrass himself by sending ordinary spirits against him.

But… it was too late.

What came easily was difficult to leave. The monk shouted loudly, chanting his sutras, as seven golden talismans formed from the scripture wrapped around the Flame Ghost, spinning around it.

In a moment, the ghostly fire of the Flame Ghost was extinguished, revealing the visage of a resolute spectral man.

Initially fierce in appearance, the spectral man’s face softened as the golden talismans rotated. He smiled gracefully at the monk before dissolving into particles of light.

Smash!

The vial holding the “Flame Ghost’s ashes” shattered in the ordinary-looking man’s hand, the ashes scattering everywhere…

“Roar!” Just then, the transformed white-collar worker finally reached the monk, delivering a powerful black bear charge.

The monk remained still, bracing for the white-collar worker's attack.

Bang!

The transformed white-collar worker’s muscles were not just for show; the impact sent the larger monk staggering back, interrupting his recitation of the sutras.

“Ah!” Seizing the moment when the monk was off-balance, the white-collar worker unleashed a fierce double-fisted attack aimed at the monk’s face.

The monk smacked his lips, a joyful smile appearing on his face: “You really are a shy bee!”

The attacking white-collar worker was left bewildered.

“You guys just hit me first!” the monk proclaimed triumphantly. “So, I can retaliate. My master said this is called self-defense!”

With that, the monk clapped his palms together: “Roll, little bull!”

The white-collar worker was swatted away like a fly, crashing against the subway wall.

Not only was this monk fluent in Mandarin, but he also had a knack for using some popular internet slang… even if it was a bit outdated from over a decade ago. But one could not deny, he was indeed fluent!

“I knew there was someone manipulating that powerful vengeful ghost behind the scenes. They say, ‘Cutting the grass does not remove the roots; the spring breeze will make it grow again!’ I’m going to take you both down!” the monk declared, full of confidence as he assumed a martial arts stance, saying, “Come on, you two shy little bees!”

……

Hello, audience friends! Welcome to the ultimate underground no-holds-barred fighting tournament, the Line 5 regional match in the Jiangnan area.

Let’s take a moment to introduce the competitors.

The home fighter is the Western monk, dressed in thick monk robes, sporting six distinct scars from his vows.

The guest fighters consist of two individuals: one in a black suit and the other in a plain T-shirt. Yes, this is a two-on-one ultimate fighting match! Quite unfair, but in this no-rules tournament, the lack of rules is the greatest rule!

And now, the match has begun!

The guest fighter in the black suit launches the first attack, executing a beautiful charge! This could deal at least a hundred points of collision damage!

However, the home fighter does not evade the attack! Yes, the monk takes the hit head-on! And he remains unscathed. Though it’s just the first round, it’s clear both fighters possess significant strength.

The black-suited fighter attacks again, this time with a dual fist strike!

Impressive! The home fighter, the Western monk, blocks this dual fist attack.

The monk retaliates; this is his first counterattack, using the great ape’s technique of swatting flies!

Remarkable! A thousand points of critical damage! The black-suited fighter is sent flying, crashing against the train wall and unable to move.

He has ten seconds to stand up; if he can’t get up in ten seconds, he’ll lose his qualification to compete.

Ten, nine, eight… four, three!

Oh, the guest fighter in the black suit struggles to rise, defiantly standing back up. This time, he and his T-shirt-clad companion regroup.

The match is heating up! So, which side will claim victory in this battle? Let’s stay tuned!
