**The Cold Spirit Box**

The foreign monk sat cross-legged on the prison bed, calmly cultivating his energy. 

To the average person's eyes, this monk appeared to be just a tall foreigner. 

But Zhao Bulu, having already opened his second eye, could discern that the monk's internal energy and blood had thickened to a viscous state. With each breath, his energy surged and rolled around him, clearly reaching the pinnacle of the first-grade cultivator level—only a single opportunity stood between him and a breakthrough that would transform his energy into true qi, allowing him to enter the realm of second-grade cultivators!

However, that wasn't the most important part—surrounding this foreign monk was a robust golden light of virtue.

In Zhao Bulu's eyes, the monk shone like a small sun.

The presence of such dense virtuous energy indicated that this monk was a high-ranking monk of great virtue! But why was such a monk locked away in prison?

Sensing someone had entered the prison, the monk slowly opened his eyes and gazed at Zhao Bulu.

"Ah, a newcomer has arrived? What crime has brought you here?" the foreign monk asked.

Zhao Bulu then saw the prison guard wearing a fawning expression as he replied, "Master, this person is a robber. To steal a package, he even destroyed the delivery truck and severely injured the delivery man. Truly a heinous crime!"

Upon seeing the guard’s overly ingratiating demeanor, Zhao Bulu felt something was off.

“Good, good, this prisoner shall be entrusted to me for proper guidance,” the monk said, pressing his palms together and reciting a Buddhist chant. As he spoke, the golden light of virtue surrounding him seemed to pulse with life, almost blinding to behold.

“Then I’ll leave it to you, Master,” the guard respectfully closed the prison door behind him.

The monk had initially been imprisoned as a suspect in a subway murder case. The guards had not thought much of him at first; they had seen many murderers. However, shortly thereafter, someone from above mysteriously instructed them to treat this monk well, providing him with ample food and drink.

Yet, they had not mentioned releasing him; they simply said to let the master do as he pleased.

Do as he pleased? In a prison, he could do as he pleased?!

And so, this master truly made the prison his home. He taught prisoners the Buddhist scriptures, guided them spiritually, and often ventured into the darker corners of the prison to help restless souls.

After a month, the guards noticed that the oppressive atmosphere in the prison had significantly lessened. Moreover, the monk’s aura of a high-ranking monk grew increasingly profound, his every movement exuding an indescribable charm.

Though they did not fully understand the monk’s intentions, the guards felt that he might be on the verge of a breakthrough in his understanding of Buddhism.

……

After the guards left, the foreign monk pressed his palms together and greeted Zhao Bulu with a Buddhist gesture, “Greetings, fellow cultivator.”

Zhao Bulu could sense the monk's powerful energy, and the monk could clearly see that Zhao Bulu was not an ordinary person.

“Hello, Master,” Zhao Bulu replied, a frown on his face. He felt that his life had taken a tragic turn recently.

“There is no need to be alarmed, fellow cultivator; we are fated to meet,” the monk smiled gently. “Once I guide you, I will accumulate enough virtuous energy to attempt to break through the ‘Dragon Gate’ and transform! You will be the last prisoner I guide here!”

His month spent in the prison had been dedicated to converting souls and redeeming some deeply sinful prisoners. Over this time, he had gathered a substantial amount of virtuous energy.

With enough virtuous energy and the monk's already surging internal energy, his ascension to the second-grade realm was practically guaranteed.

Zhao Bulu forced a smile, “Master, I have my own sect.”

“It matters not; I have no intention of making you betray your sect,” the monk said with a carefree smile, reassuring him.

Hearing this, Zhao Bulu felt a wave of relief wash over him.

“I simply wish for you to become a monk, don’t worry; this has nothing to do with your sect.” The monk pressed his palms together again. “Come, come, there’s no better day than today. Once I explain this Buddhist scripture to you, how about we shave your head? By the way, do you want any precepts? Since you and I are fated, I can gift you six points of precepts! I had to beg my teacher for a long time to get just four, and the last two I earned myself. Pretty cool, right?”

The thought of being bald with precepts made Zhao Bulu feel despondent.

He truly wanted to escape, but when he glanced at his severed legs, his eyes turned hollow and devoid of hope.

Nothing is worse than a heart that has died…

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On July 1st, Monday.

Scholar Song woke up early as usual, ready to practice the “Fundamental Diamond Fist Technique,” converting the energy he had accumulated overnight into blood power to channel into his second eye.

After washing and getting dressed, he planned to take Venerable White out to buy a phone, a computer, and various daily necessities, while also familiarizing himself with the neighborhood.

“I should take another day off.” Scholar Song thought to himself. He had already grasped most of the knowledge taught in class and didn’t particularly need those few attendance credits.

At that moment, the doorbell rang from downstairs.

“Who is it?” Scholar Song leaned out to look and saw a large white wolf-man standing upright, one paw resting on the doorbell.

He immediately recalled the “Master of Snow Wolf Cavern” from the “Ninefold Land Group” chat from yesterday.

“Is he here to deliver Venerable White’s legal identification documents?”

Scholar Song hurried downstairs to greet the snow-white wolf.

“Hello, are you Scholar Song?” the wolf asked with a bright, youthful voice.

“Yes, that’s me.” Scholar Song opened the door.

“I have been sent by my master, the Master of Snow Wolf Cavern, to deliver something to you.” The wolf pointed to a small pouch around its neck, took it off, and handed it to Scholar Song.

“Thank you, Senior Snow Wolf mentioned this yesterday.” Scholar Song accepted the pouch, which contained Venerable White’s identification card, household registration, passport, driver’s license, and other documents.

Wait, a driver’s license?

Scholar Song pulled it out and indeed found a driver’s license.

Hadn’t Venerable White never even touched a car? How could he have a driver’s license? Was this really okay?

“Then I’ll take my leave now. If you have the time, Mr. Song, do come visit the Snow Wolf Cavern. That’s what my master said.” After finishing, the snow-white wolf lightly leaped away, disappearing into the mist.

It felt like the wolf was avoiding something.

Was it avoiding Venerable White?

That shouldn’t be the case; beasts don’t seem to fear Venerable White, as evidenced by Dou Dou.

Could it be avoiding the little Pekingese, Dou Dou?

Scholar Song’s thoughts wandered as he went upstairs to find Venerable White. Oh, now he should be referring to him as Venerable One!

But Scholar Song couldn’t help but keep calling him “Venerable White,” often thinking of him as the senior with the surname Bai and given name Zhenjun.

When Scholar Song returned upstairs, he found Venerable White… disassembling the refrigerator. Next to him on the computer screen were detailed materials on the structure of refrigerators.

“Oh, so that’s how the refrigerator is constructed! Fascinating! It’s amazing how these components work together to artificially create cold air, achieving the effects of a formation. Humanity’s creativity is incredible!” Venerable White murmured, a satisfied expression on his face.

Before long, the refrigerator was in pieces, scattered across the floor…

Scholar Song couldn’t help but laugh and cry at the same time. “Venerable One, what about the stuff inside the refrigerator?”

“Oh, I put those on the table. Don’t worry; I’ll put the refrigerator back together afterward!” Venerable White said confidently.

Scholar Song looked at the table, where a box of “open and crispy ice pops” he had just bought sat, feeling a bit awkward.

Well, it’s just a box of ice pops. At most, I’ll have to drink them as melted water later.

Then… half an hour later.

“I fixed it!” Venerable White laughed heartily and reached for the refrigerator’s power cord, ready to plug it back in.

At that moment, Scholar Song’s sharp eyes noticed several components still lying beside the refrigerator!

He couldn’t discern their purpose, but he knew that even a seemingly insignificant component was essential for the refrigerator to function properly.

“Wait, Venerable One, you haven’t put back a few parts!” Scholar Song exclaimed.

“It’s fine; those parts are unimportant. I couldn’t even remember where they go. But don’t worry! The refrigerator will definitely work! Trust me!” Venerable White insisted as he firmly plugged the power cord into the socket.

The next second, there was a loud pop followed by sizzling sounds, and a foul smell of burnt wires filled the air as smoke began to billow from the refrigerator.

Scholar Song: “…”

Venerable White quickly unplugged the power cord, a confused look on his face as he stared at the refrigerator. “How strange! There shouldn’t be any issues with the principles! Scholar Song, why did this happen?”

“Uh-huh.” Scholar Song forced a laugh.

Looks like he would have to go out and buy another refrigerator today. A summer without a refrigerator wouldn’t do; a summer without ice pops or cold drinks isn’t a complete summer!

“While it’s a clever piece of technology, it’s really fragile. It seems I need to study it more. Just thinking about all the things I can research is wonderful.” Venerable White muttered, waving his hand to disperse the burnt smell wafting from the refrigerator.

Scholar Song didn’t hear Venerable White’s murmur and thought he was feeling down. So, he spoke up to comfort him, “It’s okay, Venerable One; we can just go buy another one.”

“No need, no need! I broke it, so I’ll fix it! It’s just a refrigerator!” Venerable White declared confidently.

……

In just three minutes, Venerable White exclaimed triumphantly, “Done!”

Scholar Song opened the refrigerator door, and a refreshing gust of cold air rushed out!

It really worked!

Looking inside the refrigerator, Scholar Song noticed that on either side of the interior, Venerable White had inscribed two formations.

One was the Gathering Spirit Formation, which could slowly absorb the wandering spiritual energy from the world and store it within the formation.

The other was the Ice Formation, which could convert the absorbed spiritual energy into cold air for preservation.

“How is it?” Venerable White asked proudly.

Scholar Song rubbed his cheeks, revealing a bright smile, “It’s amazing, Venerable One!”

From today onward, this refrigerator was no longer an ordinary appliance.

It had become a cooling magic tool!

Let’s call it… the Ice Tool? Or perhaps the Cold Spirit Box?

Hmm, the Cold Spirit Box has a nice ring to it.
