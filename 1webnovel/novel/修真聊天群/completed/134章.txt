**Chapter XX: The Mysterious Valley**

"Why is Su Clan Ah Seven here?" 

The one who arrived was none other than one of the strongest fighters of the Xian Farming Sect, Master Zhengneng, the most powerful cultivator among the 'Zheng' generation. He was an exceptionally gifted practitioner, who, despite being in a small sect like the Xian Farming Sect, had managed to break through numerous obstacles and reach the Fourth Rank in a mere one hundred and eighty years, relying solely on ordinary cultivation techniques.

If he could join a more powerful sect...

As he approached the members of the Xian Farming Sect, Master Zhengneng pulled back his escape light, which transformed into a small wooden sword that he tucked away into his sleeve. He then gracefully landed on the ground.

His tall frame and gentle demeanor made him appear less like a cultivator and more like a scholar who had stepped out of a painting. It was hard not to feel a sense of warmth upon seeing him.

"Master Zhengneng, something terrible has happened! Master Zhengde has been captured! Master Zhengyue is chasing after them, and we haven't been able to contact her yet. The Su Clan’s Ah Sixteen we were planning to capture is also missing! What should we do?" A young disciple rushed up to him, throwing himself into Master Zhengneng's arms and bursting into tears.

"Don’t worry, Zhengli, I am here now," Master Zhengneng said with a gentle sigh. "I just received a message from the Sect Leader. They've discovered the whereabouts of Su Clan Ah Seven, who has entered a massive valley! It seems to be under the influence of a faction called the 'Moon Blade Sect.' The Sect Leader has already summoned our sect's protective treasures, and our strongest forces have arrived at the valley. We must demand an explanation from Su Clan Ah Seven! It’s likely that Master Zhengde has also been captured and could be rescued alongside him!"

Su Clan Ah Seven in the massive valley? Scholar Song felt a flicker of confusion in his heart.

"I just don't understand why they captured Master Zhengde," the young disciple, still not fully out of his childish demeanor, asked between sobs, clearly upset.

"Ah Seven's goal is the 'Seven Radiant Fruits,' but they cannot simply be consumed. He must have wanted to extract the usage method from our sect, which is why he captured Zhengde," Master Zhengneng replied sternly.

He gently patted the young disciple Zhengli and continued, "Now, those who are able to move, come with me to the valley and join the Sect Leader! Whether it's the Moon Blade Sect or Su Clan Ah Seven, we shall not fear them!"

Most of the disciples sprang to their feet, excitement lighting up their faces.

However, one unfortunate disciple, who had been severely injured by Lord An Zhi's sword qi, had not fully recovered. As he leaped up, his wound reopened, blood staining his abdomen worse than a menstrual period.

Seeing this, Master Zhengyan spoke gently, "Zhengfeng, your injuries are too severe; stay behind until you are fully healed to avoid any long-term issues. Zhengli, stay here and take care of Zhengfeng."

Zhengfeng wore a face of despair.

Zhengli, who had been told to stay back, pouted but dared not disobey Master Zhengyan, letting his head droop in disappointment.

"We're off!" Master Zhengneng waved his hand and took the lead.

Since none of the disciples were capable of flight, he didn’t want to leave them behind in the air.

"Just a bit further, and we’ll reach the main road. I rented a large passenger bus on my way here. It should be parked by the roadside, waiting for us. We'll drive closer to Lanyuan Valley and then walk the rest of the way to save our energy!"

Suddenly, the atmosphere shifted from a classic Xianxia vibe to a peculiar modern style.

...

...

Zhengfeng and Zhengli remained behind.

Along with them was the neglected Scholar Song.

Zhengli had not given Scholar Song a friendly look the entire time, acting as stubborn as a child throwing a tantrum.

Zhengfeng, despite his injuries, had the characteristic gentle nature of the Xian Farming Sect.

Scholar Song had originally planned to leave with the Xian Farming Sect's group to find the road back to Jiangnan University City, but all the cultivators from the sect were above the Second Rank, and they had swiftly leaped away, leaving him behind.

So, he resigned himself to resting a bit longer to gather his strength before taking action. At least he had a general direction and shouldn’t get lost.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

After resting for a while, Scholar Song stood up, glancing at the two Xian Farming Sect disciples—if he were to borrow their phones to call Su Clan Ah Sixteen and check in, would they beat him to a pulp?

Well, they probably wouldn't kill him, just beat him half to death, right?

So, it was best to avoid that.

"Two friends, you continue to heal; I have some matters to attend to!" Scholar Song bid farewell to the Xian Farming Sect disciples, intending to see if there was a public phone booth nearby.

"Hmph, who are you calling a friend?" Zhengli snorted coldly.

"Zhengli, don’t be rude. Scholar Song was dragged into this trouble and has no grievances with our Xian Farming Sect," Zhengfeng scolded gently, ruffling Zhengli's hair. He then clasped his fists toward Scholar Song, saying, "Please go ahead, but I hope you don’t get involved in any conflicts between our sect and Su Clan Ah Seven."

Scholar Song mimicked the clasped fist gesture, internally sighing.

Fine, I’ll head back to Jiangnan University City first. Everything can wait until I meet with the elder Ah Seven.

Just as Scholar Song was about to leave, he suddenly heard a bright voice calling from above, "Scholar Song... Scholar Song!"

"Huh?" Scholar Song looked up towards the sky.

He then saw a tall man descending, riding on escape light, accompanied by a short-haired, exquisite-looking girl.

"Ah Sixteen?" Scholar Song exclaimed in surprise.

How did she find this place?

And was that Su Clan Ah Seven next to her?

But wait, hadn’t Master Zhengneng just said that they saw Ah Seven in some massive valley? Now, everyone from the Xian Farming Sect was rushing over there!

How was Ah Seven appearing here now?

As Su Clan Ah Seven and Ah Sixteen landed, Ah Sixteen's eyes sparkled with joy. "Did you escape from that black smoke ball?"

"Maybe today was just my lucky day. I happened to run into the Xian Farming Sect disciples who intercepted that black smoke ball with Lord An Zhi inside. They thought the person trapped in the smoke ball was Ah Sixteen. So, I took the chance to use a sword talisman and escaped from the demon lord," Scholar Song explained, pointing to the two Xian Farming Sect disciples nearby.

At this moment, the two disciples were on high alert, their eyes fixed nervously on Su Clan Ah Seven.

Ah Sixteen frowned at the two Xian Farming Sect disciples, her small nose scrunching adorably. She didn’t have much fondness for the Xian Farming Sect either.

"Don’t act like that; the disciples of the Xian Farming Sect might have been deceived," Scholar Song clarified, recounting the situation as described by Master Zhengyan.

Su Clan Ah Seven said solemnly, "So, someone impersonated me that night and stole the Seven Radiant Fruits from the Xian Farming Sect, then unleashed the 'Heavenly Blade Burying Stars' move?"

The young Zhengli, still naïve, shouted angrily, "What impersonation? It was clearly you who did it! You stole our sect’s Seven Radiant Fruits; why won’t you admit it?!"

Zhengfeng quickly covered his mouth, a look of wariness on his face.

"Hahaha, not admitting? Since I, Ah Seven, started my journey, I've owned up to everything I've done. But if someone wants to pin something on me that I didn't do, they better ask this knife in my hand if it agrees!" Ah Seven declared loudly.

Zhengli and Zhengfeng found themselves speechless, unable to refute Ah Seven's claims.

"Also, that thief used the 'Heavenly Blade Burying Stars' technique to severely injure eighteen disciples of your sect? Hahaha, what a joke! The 'Heavenly Blade Burying Stars' is a technique I haven’t even mastered myself. Once unleashed, it’s impossible to control its power. Under that technique, do you really think your disciples could survive?" Su Clan Ah Seven countered.

Zhengli and Zhengfeng were left dumbfounded—they had never encountered high-level cultivators' methods, so they had no concept of the 'Heavenly Blade Burying Stars.'

But today, they had witnessed Lord An Zhi's single move that had wiped out fifteen of their sword handlers, giving them a glimpse of the power of high-level cultivators.

If even a Fourth Rank cultivator like Lord An Zhi could defeat so many of them in one blow, how could they expect to survive if the even stronger Su Clan Ah Seven were unable to control his ultimate move?

The higher-ups of the Xian Farming Sect should have realized this... but those involved were always blind to the truth.

Scholar Song sighed inwardly and then curiously asked, "By the way, Ah Sixteen, how did you find me?"

"Hehe, of course, it was through Master Tong Xuan's 'Mark Sensing Technique.' I suddenly remembered that you were carrying the Master's flying sword, which has a spiritual mark on it. By using this 'Mark Sensing Technique,' we could locate you! So, I went through your chat history and found this spiritual technique. With Ah Seven’s powerful spiritual sense, we were able to lock onto your position!" As she spoke, Ah Sixteen looked a bit shy. "But I didn’t ask for your permission to read your chat history. You don’t blame me, do you?"

Scholar Song smiled and shook his head, grateful to them.

"By the way, Elder Ah Seven. Just now, the Xian Farming Sect's Master Zhengneng rushed over and said their Sect Leader saw 'Su Clan Ah Seven' in a massive canyon, and they were all heading over there to join the Sect Leader." Scholar Song spoke up.

Zhengfeng and Zhengli exchanged glances; they suddenly felt a spark of realization: if Su Clan Ah Seven was right here, then the one in that massive valley must be a fake!

"Another impersonation? Looks like they’re getting addicted to it!" Su Clan Ah Seven exclaimed furiously, letting out a light whistle as the blade transformed into escape light once again.

"Come on, we’re heading there now to find the Moon Blade Sect and see what tricks they’re trying to play!"

As she spoke, Su Clan Ah Seven raised her right hand, and Scholar Song and Ah Sixteen were pulled by an invisible force, standing confidently atop the escape light.

They were flying on their swords!

This time it was real sword flight!

The dream of a good man soaring through the blue skies—Scholar Song, here I come again!
