**The Hilariously Useless Good Guy**

Not far from the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University Town, at a street corner...

Old Zhou was feeling particularly gloomy today. While driving to work, he had made a phone call when suddenly, out of nowhere, a guy sprinted toward his car at breakneck speed, as if he were running a hundred-meter dash.

Startled, Old Zhou quickly tossed his phone aside, his reflexes kicking in. He gripped the steering wheel, swerved sharply, and just barely missed the rushing man. “Phew!” he thought, letting out a silent sigh of relief. “That was close! If it weren’t for my driving skills, that young man would’ve been toast today!”

But before Old Zhou’s heart could settle back to a normal rhythm, the guy suddenly defied all laws of physics and dramatically fell backward, rolling three and a half times before clutching his legs in apparent agony. “Ouch! My leg! My leg is broken!” he screamed.

The man’s cries quickly attracted a crowd of bewildered onlookers, all unsure of what had transpired—did the car hit the man, or did the man hit the car? The discussions began to swirl.

What the hell! Dude, I didn’t even hit you! Did you crash into an invisible wall or something? I don’t possess any superpowers to have an air wall!

This must be what they call “scamming,” right?

But isn’t it usually the case that these scammers go after flashy, expensive cars? Could my old clunker really attract a scammer?

Old Zhou didn’t realize that in this day and age, business was tough, and it didn’t matter what kind of car you drove.

With a perplexed expression, he sighed deeply. There were no surveillance cameras nearby, and his junky car didn’t have a dashcam.

He rummaged through his pockets, finding only a few cards and a twenty-yuan bill along with two one-yuan coins.

Twenty-two yuan? That won’t even be enough to placate the guy wailing on the ground! I mean, that guy’s acting skills deserve more than twenty bucks!

…

…

Scholar Song had just helped a short-haired girl reach the intersection and was about to hail a taxi when they both witnessed the “car accident” unfold.

“Looks like the person hit the car, right?” the short-haired girl said coolly, noting that the car had already swerved away but the man still rushed forward and fell to the ground screaming.

“No, it’s not that he hit the car... he didn’t even touch it,” Scholar Song replied, his eyesight sharp as he observed the scene. From his angle, he could clearly see the guy had never made contact with the vehicle and was merely rolling on the ground now.

“Oh, I see. That’s called scamming,” the short-haired girl shot him a glance. “Are you going to go testify?”

This good Samaritan couldn’t just stand by and do nothing, right?

“If there aren’t enough witnesses, it won’t help, and we don’t have any recordings. Besides, there are no cameras around,” Scholar Song shook his head, knowing that the man on the ground was a professional in this kind of stunt, having chosen a prime location for his scheme.

“What, are we just going to ignore this?” After a moment’s thought, the short-haired girl’s eyes lit up. “How about we go over and give that guy a beating?”

“Absolutely not! Violence won’t solve everything; it’ll just land the driver in deeper trouble!” Scholar Song quickly advised. “Just wait here. I’ll call a taxi for you in a bit... by the way, do you have any spare change?”

The short-haired girl’s expression stiffened as she shook her head.

“Then let me borrow some from you. If we meet again, remember to pay me back.” Scholar Song pulled out a fifty-yuan note from his pocket and handed it to her. He had just come into some unexpected cash and was feeling generous.

Without waiting for her response, he strode over to the “accident” scene and squeezed through the gathering crowd.

“Excuse me, coming through!” His muscular build allowed him to quickly clear a path.

Then, he crouched next to the wailing man, watching him for a moment. “Wow, looks like you’re in bad shape.”

The man on the ground sneaked a glance at Scholar Song, ramping up his cries even more dramatically.

Scholar Song cleared his throat and called out, “Hey, driver! Look at this poor guy; he’s been hit so badly! Why not just get out and settle this with a few thousand yuan?”

Hearing this, the man’s heart stabilized—he had initially been worried that this handsome young man would expose him, but now this young man was actually providing him with an unexpected assist. He couldn’t help but feel overjoyed, wailing even louder.

Inside the car, Old Zhou fished out his twenty-two yuan, feeling utterly defeated. He held the phone in his hand, ready to call the police.

“Come on, driver, what are you waiting for? Get out of the car!” Scholar Song urged, while his hands were busy feeling around the scammer’s body.

The scammer felt something was off. This guy’s hands were moving around too much. Was he trying to take advantage of me? Is he a pervert?

Goosebumps broke out all over the scammer’s body.

But... he was a man of considerable acting talent, not a professional actor, but he knew he had to endure and keep up the act, even if he was being molested.

His cries couldn’t stop!

However, the scammer quickly realized something else was wrong.

He noticed that the handsome young man had reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet.

Inside was all the cash he had—around two thousand yuan.

The money was meant to cover any hospital bills in case his scam went wrong—scamming was a dangerous line of work. One could easily meet a reckless driver or a female driver who might just take off without paying, leaving him in a hospital without any cash.

These days, many hospitals only cared about money, not people. What if he didn’t have any on him?

To sum it up, what he really wanted to say was that there was money in his wallet!

The handsome young man pulled out his wallet, which was stuffed, looking very satisfied. Then, he smiled warmly at the scammer. And then… he stood up and sprinted away, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

The scammer realized what was happening: “You’ve got to be kidding me!”

He rolled over and sprang to his feet with the speed of lightning, chasing after him without hesitation. “Stop! You little thief! Don’t run! You’ll pay for this!”

The scammed driver’s old car was worth at most a few hundred yuan. But his wallet had over two thousand! He couldn’t let a small loss turn into a big one!

The onlookers, who had been oblivious to the situation, now saw the man who had been rolling on the ground in pain suddenly sprinting after the young man like a cheetah. Clearly, his legs were not broken at all! This guy was definitely a scammer!

Old Zhou sighed in relief inside his car and loosened his grip on the twenty-two yuan note. He couldn’t help but think about the handsome young man. “There are still good people in this world.”

With that thought, he started his old car and drove away.

Meanwhile, the short-haired girl, having watched the entire scene unfold, couldn’t help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all.

…

…

Scholar Song had a great time leading the scammer on a wild chase for nearly a mile and a half until the man was panting heavily, pale-faced and clutching a wall to vomit. Only then did he speed away, leaving the scammer in a cloud of dust.

He even had time to hail a taxi along the way to pick up the short-haired girl. The cheerful taxi driver happily set off to fetch her…

The scammer looked helplessly at Scholar Song’s disappearing figure, feeling utterly frustrated: “Why did you have to drag me along for so long? You could have just ditched me sooner!”

…

…

A taxi pulled up in front of the short-haired girl. “Hey there, did a young man just call for a ride for you?”

“Yeah, that’s me,” she replied, clutching the fifty-yuan note as she got into the cab.

What a hilariously useless good guy.
