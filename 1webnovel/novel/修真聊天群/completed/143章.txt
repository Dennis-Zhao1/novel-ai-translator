**An Unexpected Visitor in the Dormitory**

    With his heart and blood power surging, the key to his heart opened naturally!

    Once the heart key is unlocked, a cultivator can truly harness the 'power of qi and blood' within themselves, unleashing strength far beyond human limits! With sufficient qi and blood power, one could even bend steel bars with their bare hands!

    In his consciousness, his true self became more solid, revealing the unique aura of a cultivator.

    Scholar Song stood up and took a deep breath.

    Memories of the time he had seen the master performing martial arts in the illusion of the "Fundamental Vajra Boxing" flooded his mind.

    A simple set of basic boxing techniques had become a symphony of movement in the hands of that master, weaving curves into straight lines; the power was immense and heavy, each punch akin to cannon fire; yet at times it could be as gentle as a breeze, blending hardness with softness.

    Before his heart key was opened, Scholar Song could never achieve such effortless grace.

    Now, however, with his heart key opened, perhaps he could give it a try!

    He could sense the ceaseless flow of qi and blood power pouring out from his heart key, circulating through his body with each heartbeat; after one full cycle, the qi and blood power would return to the heart key, stronger than before. As long as Scholar Song was alive and moving, the qi and blood power would gradually strengthen.

    As the qi and blood power flowed through his body, he could perceive the state and explosive potential of every muscle.

    This was a realm of self-mastery.

    Scholar Song raised his stance for the "Fundamental Vajra Boxing," his body half-relaxed, half-tense, as he seemed to merge with the surrounding environment, exuding a fluid grace.

    Holding his breath and concentrating, he threw a punch!

    Though the speed wasn’t fast, the air around him erupted with a thunderous boom, heavier than the explosive sound from when he had previously thrown all his strength into a punch. Even a casual strike now carried the power of the 'martial arts mantra' that once commanded the energies of heaven and earth.

    After completing the set of "Fundamental Vajra Boxing," Scholar Song let out a long breath.

    This was truly a 'single breath' to finish an entire set of basic boxing techniques.

    With that deep breath released, every muscle in his body vibrated slightly, adjusting to an extremely healthy and perfect state.

    A satisfied smile spread across Scholar Song's face.

    Today’s training was done.

    Although he could rely on the 'qi and blood pill' to train a bit more, Scholar Song decided to stop here.

    Haste makes waste; having just completed his foundation, he needed some time to adapt to his current physical state and fully master this new body!

    Sharpening the axe does not delay the work of chopping wood.

    After a quick shower, Scholar Song retrieved the black box he had received from the forum master.

    He placed the 'Blood God Drill' he had obtained yesterday inside it, along with the treasured sword from the Moon Blade Sect’s leader.

    The sword was engraved with its name—Crush Tyranny.

    Measuring three feet and three inches long, its blade had been burned by calamity fire, transforming it entirely to a deep black. Once a beautifully crafted treasure, it now resembled a glossy black dagger.

    However, after being subjected to the calamity fire, the restraints and mental imprints left by the Moon Blade Sect’s leader, Ba Qianjun, had been completely incinerated. Now, this sword was a clean, unclaimed item.

    “If only I could enchant this sword with an invisibility array like the Alchemical Sage’s flying sword. Then I could carry it with me at all times,” Scholar Song sighed inwardly.

    He had grown quite fond of this sword, wishing he could keep it with him constantly.

    Unfortunately, it was a sharp weapon; if it wasn’t concealed, it wouldn’t be long before the police confiscated it on the streets. He didn’t want to risk being charged for ‘carrying a controlled weapon.’

    After securing these treasures in his room’s safe, protected by the formations he had laid out at the Alchemical Sage's house, he felt assured that no petty thief would dare to bother them. They were as safe as could be stored here.

    Then, Scholar Song took the Master Tongxuan's flying sword and headed back to Jiangnan University Town.

    This sword needed to be sent back to Master Tongxuan.

    He had already contacted his senior, the ‘Three-Day Little Monk’ on Soft Heaven Chat, to inform him that he had retrieved the flying sword.

    ……

    On the way, Scholar Song called Si Ma Jiang: “Hey, is that you, Xiao Jiang? Haha, I’m calling you so late! How’s your injury? Can you come over? I need to send that package again.”

    Si Ma Jiang quickly responded over the phone, “No problem! Are we going to Jiangnan University Town again? Got it, I’ll be there soon!”

    Initially, Si Ma Jiang had been worried that Scholar Song might not take care of his business anymore, but with this call, he finally felt at ease.

    “Bring four people with you; let’s go together.” Si Ma Jiang said. If the package were to be robbed again, he wouldn’t be able to face anyone.

    “Mr. Si Ma, how should we deal with that robber?” a bespectacled man in a black suit asked, adjusting his glasses.

    “Let’s keep him locked up for now. I’ll ask Scholar Song for his opinion when I see him,” Si Ma Jiang replied, taking four big men in black suits with him as they walked.

    ＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

    On his way back to the university town, Scholar Song unexpectedly ran into two 'familiar faces.'

    The towering Nan Haomeng and the skinny Lin Tao.

    Lin Tao was the senior who, during the ‘forum master incident,’ had sold information about Scholar Song and had received a friendly punch from him.

    Scholar Song spotted them as he turned a corner, but the angle meant they didn’t see him.

    It seemed to be a coincidence for both sides.

    Nan Haomeng approached Lin Tao with a bright smile, “Hey, Lin Tao, have you gotten your tooth fixed yet?”

    Lin Tao’s face was still slightly swollen, and he looked miserable as he replied, “Yes, yes, it’s fixed.”

    However, since he had many teeth to repair, that unexpected windfall had been spent almost entirely. In the end, he hadn’t made any profit and had lost half his teeth. Lin Tao felt utterly miserable…

    “That’s good; technology is advanced now—no one can tell they’re fake teeth. By the way, you didn’t report us to the school, did you? We’re not kids anymore; we’re all adults here, and if we make mistakes, we have to take responsibility, right?” Nan Haomeng said with a friendly smile, patting Lin Tao on the shoulder.

    “No, of course not,” Lin Tao shook his head vigorously.

    “That’s great! After all, we’ve met through this little scuffle, so let’s be friends now. But you wouldn’t want to go through a ‘fight to make friends’ again, right? So let’s just let the past go. What’s done is done; it’s all water under the bridge, isn’t that right?” Nan Haomeng continued to pat Lin Tao's frail shoulder enthusiastically.

    “Yes, yes,” Lin Tao wanted to cry—who would want to be friends with you guys?

    “Well then, see you in a few days, and I wish you success in your studies!” Nan Haomeng laughed heartily, waved, and left with a flourish, looking quite relieved, as if he was worried Lin Tao might report them to the school and had come to intimidate him.

    Who knew this big guy could be so detail-oriented?

    Lin Tao clenched his teeth, touching his swollen face, murmuring, “If I had strength, I’d definitely take you down. Bastards!”

    Just as he finished speaking, he suddenly heard a ghostly voice behind him, “Hmm, not bad, still have some ambition.”

    Lin Tao jumped in shock; who was this person, sneaking up behind him without making a sound?

    He turned around and found Scholar Song’s pale face smiling at him.

    Instantly, Lin Tao’s face twitched, and the spots where he had been punched a few days ago began to throb painfully again.

    “But you really need to work out; you’re as weak as a chicken right now. I could knock you down with a single finger. Once you’re strong enough, feel free to come find me anytime for revenge,” Scholar Song said, then glanced around and noticed an old building that was undergoing demolition nearby.

    He approached a wall of the building, clenched his fist, controlled his strength, and gently punched the wall.

    With a loud bang!

    The wall cracked like it had been struck by a giant hammer.

    Scholar Song nodded with satisfaction and turned to Lin Tao, “See that? When you reach that level, you can come find me for revenge.”

    Lin Tao stared blankly at the cracked wall, speechless for a long time.

    He waited until Scholar Song walked far away before finally approaching the wall to touch it and push against it.

    This wall, set for demolition, was not poorly built; it was solidly constructed!

    Lin Tao felt his legs go weak.

    ＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

    More than ten minutes later, at Jiangnan University Town, in the male dormitory.

    Si Ma Jiang once again took the package from Scholar Song’s hands and carefully placed it into a high-tech-looking black box.

    “Thanks for the trouble with this package, Xiao Jiang,” Scholar Song said.

    Si Ma Jiang laughed heartily, cleverly avoiding any questions about how the package had returned to Scholar Song.

    Before leaving, Si Ma Jiang asked, “By the way, Scholar Song, how should we deal with that robber I caught last time?”

    “Oh, the guy whose leg you blew off? You handle it as you see fit; if it’s too troublesome, just throw him in jail,” Scholar Song replied thoughtfully.

    Speaking of jail… he wondered how that foreign monk was doing. How could he find out about the foreign monk?

    “Got it. This time, I’ll make sure the package gets delivered safely, don’t worry!” Si Ma Jiang assured him confidently.

    “I believe in you,” Scholar Song waved—he felt a bit guilty; Si Ma Jiang had been dragged into this mess because of him. He vowed to find a way to repay him in the future.

    After sending Si Ma Jiang off, Scholar Song returned to his dorm.

    None of his three roommates were back yet, and since Yang De rented a place outside, the dorm felt quieter than before.

    Should he get a pet?

    No, no, students aren’t allowed to have pets.

    Lost in thought, Scholar Song pushed open the dorm room door.

    And then… he saw a big furry tail. It was huge, looking as big as a floor-standing fan!

    Scholar Song quickly shut the door and rubbed his eyes vigorously.

    An ominous feeling washed over him.

    Taking a deep breath, he opened the dorm door once more.

    This time, he saw a gigantic Pekingese, panting and looking adorably at him…
