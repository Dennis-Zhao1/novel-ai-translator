**Bamboo Slice Formation (3 updates, seeking monthly tickets)**

“Brother Zhou Li is still complaining to Scholar Song,” the young man sighed, “It was just like yesterday. After Dou Dou handed me the phone, it went inside with the little monk to get treated for hemorrhoids. But after a long while, I went to check, and they had already left… I wasn’t able to keep an eye on it again.”

But what could he even do?

Dou Dou's skill in running away was at an EX level, something even the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain couldn’t guard against. Zhou Li, who was responsible for dealing with Dou Dou's troubles, was nothing but a repeat loser with a record of one hundred and nine failures.

“Anyway, I'll do my best to find Dou Dou soon and update you. As for the traffic accident on your side, I’ll arrange for people to handle it, so don’t worry,” Zhou Li said, pulling himself together once more.

He was a man who was used to losing—he had the experience of bouncing back from every defeat, no matter how heavy. After all, he had ample experience in self-psychological comfort...

Scholar Song suddenly felt a wave of guilt towards Brother Zhou Li. Just thinking about Zhou Li's mysterious immortal partner made him feel a twinge of sympathy.

“Hang in there, Brother Zhou Li. Once you find Dou Dou, I’ll make sure to keep a tight watch on it. I can’t promise much, but I’ll definitely ensure it doesn’t cause any trouble for at least a week!” Scholar Song assured him.

On the other end, it seemed like Zhou Li's voice was choked with happiness.

...

After hanging up the phone, Scholar Song let out a long sigh—whether it was Dou Dou or the little monk, neither of them was exactly a source of peace.

“Dou Dou ran away again?” Fay Yu asked.

“Yeah, and it took the little monk Guo Guo with it. The little monk Guo Guo is a new disciple of Master Tong Xuan. A while back, he secretly ran away from the ‘Wandering Monastery’ to get treated for hemorrhoids and ended up here with me. Later, Brother San Ri entrusted me to take good care of him,” Scholar Song rubbed his temples. “I thought this little guy, with his serious and cute look, would be easy to handle, but it turns out he’s even more trouble than Dou Dou!”

“Hehe, heh,” Fay Yu chuckled dryly—she was also a runaway in her own right.

In truth, Scholar Song’s worries weren’t just about ‘Dou Dou taking the little monk away.’ He was also anxious about who would handle Venerable White’s situation if Brother Zhou Li didn’t come over.

He had promised Mother Song that he would definitely wake Venerable White up for lunch—he had even planned to wait for Brother Zhou Li to come over to cast an illusion or something to disguise himself as Venerable White.

But now, Brother Zhou Li was off chasing Dou Dou and the little monk.

Not only that, but when Venerable White was in closed-door meditation, there was a chance he might accidentally unleash a ‘passionate desert with a young man in a white horse and green shirt.’ To prevent unforeseen circumstances, he had wanted to ask Brother Zhou Li to set up a defensive formation in his room.

What a headache!

Scholar Song looked troubled... Do parents feel this worried when their kids run away? If he sneaks out, would his dad worry this much too? Fay Yu silently patted her chest, feeling quite guilty. Maybe when she returned, she should apologize to her dad?

At that moment, Scholar Song suddenly slapped his forehead: “Duh!”

He looked at Fay Yu with hopeful eyes and asked, “Fay Yu, can you set up a defensive formation?”

He remembered that Fay Yu could also arrange formations—back when he accompanied her to the ‘Luo Xin District’ to catch a phantom spirit, she had once used some silver sticks and talismans to set up a defensive formation.

“I can set up defensive formations, but there are many types, and their strengths vary. What kind of defensive formation does Scholar Song want? What’s it for?” Fay Yu asked.

“The strength doesn’t need to be too high, as the main defense isn’t against outside enemies.” Scholar Song glanced at Venerable White… Even though Venerable White was in closed-door meditation, no one could guarantee that he had completely cut off all senses from the outside world. After only two days of meditation, Venerable White might still have some awareness left.

So, Scholar Song silently took out his phone and sent Fay Yu a private message.

He briefly described how Venerable White had accidentally unleashed a ‘true illusion’ during his cultivation, leading to chaos with the desert and the young man in a white horse and green shirt.

He also reminded Fay Yu that previously, because the Alchemical Sage had set up a defensive formation in his building, Venerable White’s ‘true illusion’ had been confined within that building.

Thus, Scholar Song wanted to try setting up a defensive formation in his room; the strength didn’t matter, but it was crucial to block the ‘true illusion’ inadvertently leaked by Venerable White.

Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable—his family was just ordinary people. If they got caught up in the true illusion...

Tomorrow’s headlines in the Wen Zhou City newspaper would undoubtedly read: "University student goes insane, brutally murders his parents, and engages in various desecrations..."

Seeing this, Fay Yu quickly replied: “Oh, that’s simple. That was just a tiny bit of ‘true illusion’ inadvertently leaked by Venerable White during his closed-door meditation. A small formation at the bed should do the trick. Just watch me!”

Her tone was brimming with confidence.

After all, her father was also a ‘Venerable’ level figure, so she was familiar with ‘true illusions.’ She had experience in blocking the true illusions that inadvertently leaked from Venerable figures.

Then, Fay Yu pulled out a pen made from the hair of a magical beast from her small pouch and asked, “Scholar Song, do you have any talisman paper?”

“Talisman paper? Would A4 paper work?” Scholar Song inquired—he had seen Venerable White using A4 paper to make various runes.

“……” Fay Yu: “Scholar Song, don’t joke around. How can A4 paper substitute as talisman paper?”

“Eh? Can’t it?” Scholar Song sighed inwardly—sure enough... using A4 paper to draw runes was Venerable White’s specialty.

After thinking for a moment, he took an A4 sheet from his pocket and handed it to Fay Yu. It was the ‘invisible formation’ A4 paper that Venerable White had previously stuck on a tractor. The others, like the enhanced tractor or anti-gravity ones, had been burned to ashes along with the tractor.

This A4 paper, perhaps, could serve as a reference for Fay Yu.

Fay Yu took the A4 paper, staring at it for a while, and tentatively asked, “Is this a work by Venerable White?”

“Yeah, it is,” Scholar Song nodded.

“Indeed! My dad mentioned that when it comes to ‘formations,’ Venerable White ranks among the top three in the entire cultivation world. It has completely surpassed my understanding,” Fay Yu said, carefully grasping the A4 paper, and asked hopefully, “Scholar Song, can I keep this A4 paper for research?”

“Sure thing! If you want it, take it,” Scholar Song replied.

“Thank you, Scholar Song!” Fay Yu carefully tucked the A4 paper away.

Then she added, “But if there’s no talisman paper, A4 paper definitely won’t work; my skills aren’t that high.”

“What materials do you need?” Scholar Song asked curiously.

“Well, let’s go find some fresh bamboo slices. We can use bamboo as talisman paper and harness the wooden attribute aura in the fresh bamboo to set up a small wood-based defensive formation,” Fay Yu suggested.

Scholar Song thought they might need something like ‘thunder-struck wood’ or other hard-to-find materials. Hearing that they only needed bamboo slices, he immediately relaxed: “That’s simple! There are some bamboo plants growing behind my house; I’ll go chop a piece down.”

“I’ll go with you to chop the bamboo,” Fay Yu jumped off the bed and began putting on her sandals.

“Sounds good!” Scholar Song agreed.

He hoped Venerable White wouldn’t unleash that ‘passionate desert’ at a critical moment as he clasped his hands together in silent prayer.

“Mom, I’m going downstairs with Fay Yu to chop some bamboo and make something fun!” Scholar Song shouted towards Mother Song in the living room.

“Sure, have fun! Don’t play for too long, and remember to come back for lunch,” Mother Song called back.

“Alright!” Scholar Song grinned.

He took the ‘Treasure Blade of Shattering’ from the living room and headed downstairs with Fay Yu.

On the other side.

Lu Tianyou and Old Lu had also gone to the hospital for a check-up—Scholar Song’s dad had called them over a dozen times, insisting they go for a medical examination.

According to Scholar Song’s dad: “I was dragged off to the hospital for a check-up after sitting in the back of the truck, so Old Lu, you can’t avoid it. How could you not go? Even if we can’t share the blessings, we must share the troubles!”

Thus, Scholar Song’s dad called every ten minutes, pushing Old Lu and his son to the hospital. For this, he had wasted quite a bit on phone bills.

At this moment, Lu Tianyou was driving Old Lu back home.

On the way, he seemed a bit distracted.

“Tianyou, what are you thinking about?” Old Lu asked.

“Thinking about Scholar Song’s tractor,” Lu Tianyou replied honestly.

“Oh, that tractor runs really fast,” Old Lu nodded.

Lu Tianyou smiled slightly—he was more concerned that the tractor not only ran fast but also was very stable. Moreover, the passengers hardly felt any wind pressure.

Although he didn’t know what technology or principle it used... he felt it might be something worth investing in.

He wondered if Scholar Song’s friend who modified the tractor had secured any investments yet.

If not, Lu Tianyou wouldn’t mind pouring all his savings into helping Scholar Song and his friend improve the technology.

It would definitely be a surefire profit.

Before long, they arrived home.

After parking the car, Lu Tianyou and his father headed upstairs. Along the way, he pulled out his phone, swiped through a few chat apps, and checked for any news.

At that moment, a post in his friend circle caught his attention.
