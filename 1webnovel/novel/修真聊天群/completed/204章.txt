**Chapter 1: The Unearthly Escape**

“Such speed! It's simply beyond salvation!”

As Scholar Song observed the monitor, he couldn’t help but sneak a glance at the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain when he noticed Yunwu Daoist in high spirits, reciting poetry.

Although the nickname “Yellow Mountain Big Fool” rolled off Dou Dou's tongue daily, it was merely a term of endearment coming from Dou Dou, the adorable pet of the Immortal Sage. To the Sage, it was just a cute quirk of Dou Dou’s personality. However, the current figure of Yunwu Daoist—a middle-aged man with no charm—was anything but cute. Would he really call the Immortal Sage “Yellow Mountain Big Fool” and not end up being slapped to death?

“Heh heh heh, looks like it’s time for him to experience the power of my improved version of the ‘Five Finger Mountain Sealing Technique.’ I’ll make sure to seal him to the point of death!” The Immortal Sage chuckled coldly.

Scholar Song silently mourned for Yunwu Daoist for three seconds...

At that moment, on the surveillance screen, Yunwu Daoist suddenly froze in place, looking around with a tense body, frequently glancing up at the sky. Unfortunately, due to the increased thickness of the fog around the forbidden area set by the Immortal Sage, he couldn't see through the dense mist. His searching eyes found nothing.

“Why do I feel an overwhelming sense of dread the moment I step out? Is that Yellow Mountain guy setting up some second trap next to me?” Yunwu Daoist muttered to himself.

But it didn’t matter; he had broken free from his seal. From now on, the world was his oyster, and he could soar high like a bird!

“Come forth, Sword!” Yunwu Daoist called out. A sword pellet flew out from his ragged sleeve, transforming into a beam of sword light. He stepped lightly onto the beam and shot up into the sky.

“I wish to ride the wind and return—ah, a sword light for five thousand miles! I’ll slice off my enemies' heads like chopping chickens!”

From his chaotic poetry, it was evident that Yunwu Daoist was a man who loved ancient poetry but had absolutely no talent for it. Moreover, having been sealed for so long, he looked ragged, lacking the refined image of a scholar.

As he soared higher and higher, Scholar Song hurriedly asked, “Sage, aren’t we going to recapture him and seal him again?”

“Not yet.” The Immortal Sage smirked darkly. “If I capture him right now and seal him again, it would be too kind. Let him enjoy some days of freedom first and taste the splendor of the world today. When he becomes deeply enamored with this world’s prosperity, that’s when I’ll catch him and suppress him again. The pain he’ll feel then, having tasted the sweetness of life, will be unbearable!”

It was like someone who had never touched the internet. Just seeing printed materials or television seemed enjoyable. Then one day, they stumbled upon the internet and became addicted. A day without it would leave them restless. If they were suddenly cut off from the internet and the power for a day or two, it might be manageable, but prolonged disconnection would drive them crazy.

“And, I’ve already secretly tampered with Yunwu’s situation. He won’t escape my surveillance,” the Immortal Sage said confidently.

Scholar Song gulped—he couldn’t shake the feeling that offending the Immortal Sage would end terribly.

Thus, the Immortal Sage, Venerable White, and Scholar Song watched as Yunwu Daoist continued to ascend into the sky, flying further and further away.

Meanwhile, Tang Tang of the Empty Thief Sect secretly saluted Venerable White while her mind buzzed with tales of “the love and hate between a female disciple of the Empty Thief Sect and a domineering, handsome cultivator elder.”

It seemed that the matter of Yunwu Daoist from the Empty Thief Sect had reached a temporary conclusion?

“Hope Yunwu Daoist finds happiness…”

……

Not long after Yunwu Daoist broke free from his seal, a streak of escape light quickly approached the sky.

Then, Su Clan’s Aqi descended from above, his tall figure landing gracefully.

“Scholar Song!” he called out to Scholar Song with a hearty smile. However, upon seeing the Immortal Sage and Venerable White beside him, his smile faltered slightly.

Still, he maintained a cheerful demeanor as he greeted them. “Elder Aqi, you came quite fast. This is the disciple of the Wuji Demon Sect, already captured by Venerable White and the Immortal Sage,” Scholar Song pointed to the captive Captain Jingmo.

“Thank you again, Scholar Song!” Elder Aqi strode over to Captain Jingmo, searching him thoroughly. He pulled out several small vials, a pitch-black flying sword, and a cloud of mist.

After placing a hand on these items to temporarily seal them, he tossed them to Scholar Song. “Take these, Scholar Song. In a month or two, once I’ve dealt with this guy and the offshoot of the Wuji Demon Sect, you can open them. By then, they’ll be unclaimed items, and you can use them without worry.”

The flying sword and magical artifacts carried the original owner’s imprint; as long as the original owner was alive, they couldn’t be used. Removing the imprint was troublesome, so Elder Aqi chose to seal them temporarily. After he dealt with Captain Jingmo in a few days, Scholar Song could use these items.

“Scholar Song, we’ll meet again! When the ‘Feast of Immortal Food’ begins, I’ll come looking for you!” With that, Elder Aqi lifted Captain Jingmo and, after bidding farewell to the Immortal Sage and Venerable White, soared into the sky, disappearing in a flash.

Once he had flown far away, Elder Aqi thought, “I almost forgot that Scholar Song was last seen with Venerable White. That gave me quite the scare! Thankfully, I reacted quickly and left.”

……

“Then, Immortal Sage, we’ll take our leave!” Scholar Song bid farewell to the Immortal Sage with a smile.

The Immortal Sage replied, “Please take care of Dou Dou for a few more days. Once I’ve recaptured Yunwu Daoist, I’ll come back for Dou Dou!”

“Understood, Elder! I’ll pass the message to Dou Dou,” Scholar Song waved.

Shortly after, Venerable White summoned his flying sword, carrying Scholar Song back to the Alchemical Sage’s residence.

Moments later, the Immortal Sage also rode off on his flying sword, leaving the sealing grounds.

“Huh? Why is everyone leaving?” Tang Tang of the Empty Thief Sect finally realized that everyone had departed, leaving her alone in the place.

“…”

Am I finally free? But why do I feel so dissatisfied?

Tang Tang felt a wave of sadness at being ignored, a bitter taste filling her heart.

Clenching her fists, she vowed towards the direction Scholar Song and Venerable White had left, “I will come back!”

……

Scholar Song sat atop Venerable White’s sword, feeling inexplicably weak in the legs—was it a lingering effect from the bungee jump last time?

That had been a heavy lesson, so he resolved to control his mouth this time, absolutely avoiding speaking without thinking.

While he pondered, his phone buzzed. Pulling it out, he saw it was a call from Tuobo. Why was Tuobo calling him at this hour?

Scholar Song answered the call.

“Scholar, where are you? I just checked your room, but you weren’t there?” Tuobo’s worried voice came through. He had trouble sleeping and had wanted to find Scholar Song, hoping to chat if he was still awake. But upon reaching Scholar Song's room, he found it empty, only a set of car keys left on the table, prompting his concern.

“Uh, I just went out to buy a pack of cigarettes. I’ll be back soon, don’t worry,” Scholar Song replied quickly.

“When did you start smoking? Wait…” Tuobo suddenly lowered his voice, “Are you being kidnapped? Do you need me to call the police?”

“Your imagination is running wild! Stop thinking so much. I’ll be back in a moment,” Scholar Song chuckled.

“Oh, okay, come back quickly. I’ll wait for you,” Tuobo responded.

Scholar Song laughed heartily and hung up.

“Venerable White, could you take me to J City first?”

“Of course,” Venerable White nodded. “I’ll use another flying sword to send you there, and then I’ll wait for you to return at the Alchemical Sage’s residence.”

“You’ll use another flying sword to send me?” Scholar Song asked in confusion. Did Venerable White have a way to transport him without riding the sword himself?

“Yep, it’s quite simple, just like using a flying sword to send a message,” Venerable White explained.

“Sending a message with a flying sword? Don’t you need another cultivator to help you lock onto the position?” Scholar Song asked, recalling how the Alchemical Sage and Master Tongxuan had used a resonance method to determine the location when they sent messages with flying swords.

“No need! Just tell me the address, and I’ll look it up on the map with my phone to confirm the location. Then I can send you there. I just figured this method out recently. You can trust me; I’m a seventh-grade cultivator,” Venerable White reassured him.

“Uh, Venerable White, won’t you come to J City to have some fun?” Scholar Song asked carefully.

He had a nagging feeling that relying on Venerable White’s phone map method might be a bit unreliable. If possible, it would be best if Venerable White personally took him there.

“Hmm, I’m suddenly feeling a bit down,” Venerable White sighed. “I clearly suppressed my aura, but Aqi still looked like he was avoiding me. He barely spoke before darting off like he was running for his life. So, I’m not going to accompany you to J City. Come on, let’s get going!”

Aqi? Scholar Song felt like crying. Why did he have to bear the brunt of Elder Aqi’s actions?

While they were speaking, Venerable White took out the blue short sword belonging to the rogue cultivator Li Tiansu and tapped it lightly. The short sword transformed into a beam of sword light, floating in the air. Scholar Song was then transferred to the escape light of the blue short sword.

“Where’s the address?” Venerable White asked.

“54 Luoxin Street, J City. By the way, Venerable White, I won’t die, right?” Scholar Song asked with a sorrowful face.

“Rest assured, you won’t have any problems,” Venerable White said, swiping his phone. “Alright, coordinates confirmed.”

Then, he formed a sword gesture and pointed at the flying sword beneath Scholar Song. “Let’s go!”

The blue short sword shot forward with a whoosh, the speed astonishing. How fast was it? It was fast to the point of being beyond salvation.

For instance, as the sword shot out, Scholar Song let out a scream, “Ahhhhhh~”

By the time he reached the fourth scream, from Venerable White’s vantage point, an ordinary person’s vision could barely see a tiny black dot in the distance. Scholar Song had already flown far away…
