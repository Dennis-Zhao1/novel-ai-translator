This is some serious corpse-whipping!

The leader of the Jingmo sect was utterly bewildered, and I mean really bewildered.

“Is it because I opened the door incorrectly?” he muttered to himself. After pushing open the gate to a courtyard, he stepped inside, only to find himself staring at a vast desert?

Could it be that I activated the protective array of the courtyard?

He quickly turned to glance back at the entrance gate, and sure enough… the gate had vanished without a trace.

Tsk tsk, they really took the precautions seriously. The defensive array is set up this well. Thankfully, I used a phantom puppet to scout ahead, so my real self is safe and sound. The leader of the Jingmo sect thought to himself.

But just then, as he flew through the air on his sword, his real body froze in shock—he had lost the five senses connection with his phantom puppet!

The desert, it seemed, was completely cutting off any contact with the outside world.

Damn, these methods are quite crafty.

Fortunately, the phantom puppet wasn’t just reliant on ‘remote control.’ When using a phantom puppet, a cultivator must infuse their true energy and mental strength into the puppet.

Even if the five senses connection with the real body was severed, the phantom puppet could still act on its own, recording everything it saw and heard. Once the connection was restored, it could transmit the stored information back to the real body.

However, this mode of operation was quite dangerous. While remotely controlling the phantom puppet allowed the cultivator to avoid certain disasters, when the puppet acted on its own, it would only rely on instinct.

Moreover, it would faithfully record any ‘pain, mental shocks,’ and other negative sensations, transmitting them to the owner once the connection was restored.

If the phantom puppet got stabbed by someone, when the real body reconnected with it, it would experience the sensation of being stabbed too.

How should I put this? Things that can have it all are few and far between in this world.

As a low-tier ‘substitute’ magical artifact, the phantom puppet could already achieve a senses connection, which was quite remarkable.

In fact, it was precisely because the phantom puppet had this irreparable flaw when the connection was severed that it was so affordable, allowing even fourth-grade cultivators the chance to acquire one.

...

The phantom puppet, resembling the leader of the Jingmo sect, wandered around the desert for a while when suddenly, a young lad in a white horse and blue robe approached him.

“Little White, where did you run off to just now? I thought you were going to get lost!” The boy in blue cheerfully called out, repeating his usual line.

Then, with a bright smile, he tossed a huge hammer toward the puppet, “Come on, let’s practice hammer techniques!”

Before the phantom puppet could even react, the boy in blue had already swung the hammer down… and just like that, the precious phantom puppet was crushed!

However, the boy's hammer didn’t stop; it continued to joyfully smash down on the phantom puppet.

After a full half an hour of pounding…

The boy in blue laughed heartily, “Hey, Little White, we’ll call it a day here! I’ll come back to play with you tomorrow!”

With that, he hopped back onto his horse. As the sound of jingling bells echoed, the boy vanished into thin air.

All that remained was the battered phantom puppet lying on the ground, twitching slightly before falling silent.

Only a small component within its heart, meant for storing information, emitted a faint glow.

Waiting to reconnect with the real body and transmit everything that had just occurred, completing its final mission…

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At eleven o’clock at night.

The projection beside Venerable White began to fade, no longer appearing.

The vast desert outside slowly started to retract.

Venerable White’s closed-door retreat was finally coming to an end.

In the desert, the little bean's eyelids finally fluttered open: “It’s finally ending.”

Fortunately, the Alchemical Sage’s residence was surrounded by a sturdy defensive barrier, preventing the ‘real illusion’ released during Venerable White’s retreat from spilling out. Otherwise, the entire Jiangnan University Town would have been shrouded in desert, and who knows what might have happened?

Perhaps there would have been rivers of blood, and by the next day, everyone would have mysteriously died?

Just thinking about it was terrifying!

Little Bean decided that tomorrow, she would reinforce the defensive barrier outside the Alchemical Sage’s residence! It would be best to add ten more layers of defense; who knows what kind of trouble Venerable White might stir up next?

...

At eleven twenty-three.

Venerable White finally opened his eyes, stretching comfortably: “Ah, that was nice!”

At the moment he opened his eyes, the desert and the young boy in blue vanished without a trace.

...

At the same time, Scholar Song felt a darkness envelop him, realizing he had returned to reality.

The moon was bright and the stars sparse; the night was deep.

“Back already?” Scholar Song murmured.

Dragging his weary body, he prepared to head to the third floor to find Little Bean and learn what had just happened.

At that moment, he spotted a damaged puppet at his feet and casually picked it up to take upstairs.

...

Third floor.

The Sugar Young Master lay softly on the floor, silently crying, her sorrow indescribable. She felt more wronged than ever in her life.

Not far from her, Little Bean was quickly plugging in the computer and connecting to the internet.

The next moment, Little Bean’s eyes also glistened with tears: “My Overlord set!”

...

In a hotel in Jiangnan.

The leader of the Jingmo sect, who had been meditating to recover his true energy, suddenly opened his eyes wide, his golden-fish-like eyes bulging with bloodshot veins. He clutched the bedsheets tightly, letting out pained groans!

Just moments ago, he had suddenly reconnected with his phantom puppet. And then, there was the agonizing sensation of a huge hammer smashing into his face.

As if that wasn’t enough, the hammer continued mercilessly pummeling him all over for a full half-hour!

The pain was maddening!

What a monstrous being! Just one blow had already flattened the phantom puppet! Yet he continued to hammer away at the broken puppet for a whole half-hour?

Isn’t this corpse-whipping? How bored and sadistic must one be to smash a little puppet with a giant hammer for so long?

You could have just smashed the puppet to bits, but instead, you left that last little component meant for storing information intact?

“Ugh!” The leader of the Jingmo sect gasped in pain.

“The pressure from books is heavy, I’ll remember this grudge, ugh~ I’ll remember it!” he muttered, filled with resentment.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

A few minutes later.

When Scholar Song learned from Little Bean that the desert had been inadvertently created by Venerable White during his closed-door retreat, he was at a loss for words to express his feelings.

At that moment, his heart was completely shattered.

Little Bean comfortingly patted Scholar Song, then pointed at the Sugar Young Master, who was sobbing on the kitchen floor: “At least you’re okay. Look at her, she’s not even in human form anymore.”

Scholar Song glanced at the Sugar Young Master. This girl had just managed to recover from her ‘interrogation’ state, but after today’s events, it was just too cruel!

Seemingly sensing Scholar Song's gaze, the Sugar Young Master looked up with tear-filled eyes, then broke into a genuine silly grin.

It’s over, she’s really lost it. Scholar Song thought to himself.

Just as he was thinking this, Venerable White stretched and approached, smiling at Scholar Song: “You’re back, Scholar. How did the exam go?”

“Thanks to your guidance, it went very smoothly,” Scholar Song replied cautiously.

Venerable White was practically a walking disaster; when he turned into a statue, he exuded irresistible charm, when he was confused, he could fall flat, and when he was alert, he could trigger all sorts of bizarre ‘risk-it-all’ situations; even during his retreat, he could unintentionally create a vast desert…

“Why are you looking at me with such a strange expression?” Venerable White asked, scanning himself up and down, noticing nothing unusual.

That’s the scariest part—he wasn’t even aware of his own destructive potential!

“Nothing, Venerable White. I just feel like you seem particularly revitalized after your retreat today!” Scholar Song replied carefully, afraid to provoke Venerable White and trigger another desert incident.

Oh… a desert is one thing, but if it were to suddenly turn into a deep sea, he would be doomed, drowning for sure.

“Haha, you feel it too? I seemed to recall many interesting things during my retreat today. I’m in a good mental state. Cultivating really is the best!” Venerable White laughed heartily, then headed toward the kitchen: “Sugar, is dinner ready?”

“Wah wah wah… I’ll have it ready soon,” the Sugar Young Master replied, feeling wronged.

“Why are you crying?” Venerable White asked, puzzled.

“It’s nothing, nothing. Just suddenly got some dust in my eyes, it’s so uncomfortable,” the Sugar Young Master wisely chose the same route as Scholar Song, definitely not daring to provoke Venerable White.

...

That day, Scholar Song didn’t practice but collapsed onto his bed to sleep. He was utterly exhausted and had no energy left for cultivation.

Early the next morning, Scholar Song got up early.

After practicing some fist techniques, he hurried off to school—he was afraid that Venerable White might suddenly want to cultivate for a bit longer and conjure up another vast desert to envelop him. If that happened, he would surely fail the exam.

When he arrived at school, Scholar Song found Tu Bo, Gao Moumou, and Li Yangde already chatting at the examination center.

“Hey, you guys are here so early today?” Scholar Song asked.

Gao Moumou pushed his glasses up: “It’s because Tu Bo couldn’t sleep and dragged us all up. We share the blessings and share the troubles.”

“Haha.” Scholar Song chuckled awkwardly; that was indeed Tu Bo’s style, so he promptly changed the subject: “What are you guys talking about?”

“We’re discussing trade and harm!” Tu Bo said seriously: “Scholar, there are at least three hundred million students in Huaxia right now, right?”

“I’ve never paid attention, but Huaxia has over a billion people, so three hundred million students should be about right,” Scholar Song replied.

“Let’s assume it’s three hundred million. Let’s calculate. If every student has five subjects to take each semester, with two papers for each subject, and they take two exams a year, that would mean sixty billion exam papers every year!”

“Let’s say one tree can make fifteen hundred sheets of exam paper. Sixty billion means we would need four million trees! That could fill up the entire capital of Huaxia! So, to protect the environment, shouldn’t we refuse to have exams? You know, without trade, there’s no harm!”

“……” Scholar Song nodded, replying: “Don’t worry, Tu Bo. In the future, the examination method will gradually evolve into electronic format, and we won’t consume so many trees.”

“Damn it!” Tu Bo grumbled angrily.
