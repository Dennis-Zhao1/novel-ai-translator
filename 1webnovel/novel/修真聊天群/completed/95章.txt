**Incredible Patient**

Height, weight, physical examination, blood tests, urine tests, electrocardiogram, and then liver function, kidney function, blood lipids, and more. Scholar Song felt his head spinning, overwhelmed like a marionette strung up in a multitude of machines for various checks.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, he completed all the examinations. Exhausted, he felt more drained than after a rigorous practice of the "Diamond Basic Fist Technique." He didn't even want to move a finger.

And then there was that moment earlier... when he had to strip down for the examination, the female doctor’s gaze felt like it could devour him whole, making him squirm uncomfortably.

Now, Zhao Yayao was sitting beside him in the waiting room, anxiously waiting for the test results, which would take about half an hour.

Thank goodness for the rapid advancements in technology over the past few years; the efficiency of hospitals had improved significantly. Otherwise, if it had been four or five years ago, it would have taken about a week to get the results of a full-body checkup.

Zhao Yayao looked visibly nervous, fidgeting in her seat and occasionally pacing back and forth. She dreaded the thought of receiving news that Scholar Song had a terminal illness. If the results took a week like they did in the past, who knew how she would cope with that agonizing wait?

Scholar Song, on the other hand, seemed oblivious, his mind wandering as he reflected on a series of recent events.

Suddenly, he recalled something from earlier at the hospital.

"By the way, isn't Professor Renshui here at this hospital? Maybe I should buy some fruit and visit him after this," he mused aloud.

Professor Renshui was the teacher who had had his legs broken by Fay Yu's spell because he had "a class in the afternoon." Initially, Fay only intended to break one of his legs, but who could have predicted that Professor Renshui would fall off the bed awkwardly? He ended up with only a sprained ankle on one leg, while the other was beyond saving. And as a result... well, he ended up in the hospital!

"I didn't kill Professor Renshui, but he ended up in this situation because of me."

Fay had assured him later that she had compensated Professor Renshui, but Scholar Song still felt guilty about it.

"Professor Renshui? Your teacher?" Zhao Yayao asked, tilting her head.

"Yeah, I heard he was hospitalized a few days ago after getting hurt. I’ll check with the front desk to see which ward he’s in," Scholar Song sighed.

Just then, a bespectacled female doctor entered the room. With a smile, she said, "Professor Renshui? Is he the one with both legs broken? It's quite rare for someone to break both legs just from falling out of bed! I happen to know where he is—Room 532 in Building 8B. Many of our doctors are aware of his situation. Are you one of his students?"

The doctor adjusted her glasses, smiling. Scholar Song recognized her as the one who had looked at him so intensely during the examination, and now he felt a bit threatened by her gaze.

"Haha, Professor Renshui’s injury is indeed quite incredible. Thank you; I’ll visit him shortly," Scholar Song said, feeling increasingly guilty. Not only were Professor Renshui’s legs injured, but it seemed his spirit had also taken a hit.

He imagined that for a long time, the story of a professor who could break both legs just by getting out of bed would become a popular joke among the faculty.

Zhao Yayao, however, was not concerned about Professor Renshui; her focus was on Scholar Song's checkup results. "Doctor Li, has Scholar Song's report come out? Is my brother okay?"

"I can only say... he's as healthy as can be. Honestly, I don't know why you were so worried about bringing your brother for a full checkup. Just look at this data yourself; he's as strong as an ox! If I hadn’t personally conducted his examination, I would suspect these results were fabricated. This data doesn’t look like that of a student; it's practically that of a national-level athlete," Doctor Li chuckled—his results were even better than many professional athletes!

That said, Zhao Yayao's brother indeed had that physique that didn’t show much muscle when clothed. When he had taken off his shirt for the examination, those well-defined muscles made him look like a charming young man. If she weren’t married, she might have considered a little sibling romance!

"Are you sure there are no hidden issues?" Zhao Yayao asked, still feeling uneasy despite the impressive health data.

"Yayao, do you really want your brother to have a hidden illness? Are you a sickly sibling fan?" Doctor Li teased, adjusting her glasses with a grin. They were familiar enough to joke around like this.

"Of course not!" Zhao Yayao replied, annoyed, shooting a glare at Scholar Song.

This wasn’t my fault! It was merely an unfortunate coincidence. Scholar Song shrugged innocently.

Zhao Yayao put on a fierce expression, but inside, she was relieved.

Finally, she wouldn’t have to worry about some terminal illness or the like. Looking at the health report in her hands, a smile crept onto her face. It seemed her brother was genuinely working out, which was good news.

……

At that moment, a shy young nurse knocked and entered. "Doctor Li, are you there?"

"What’s up?" the bespectacled doctor asked.

"The patient in Room 570 of Building 8B is back again. Do you need to check on her?" the young nurse said with a cute dimpled smile.

"Back again? Alright, I’ll head over right away," Doctor Li frowned slightly, rubbing her temples.

Seeing the doctor’s furrowed brow, Zhao Yayao asked, "Is it a troublesome patient?"

"Troublesome, and… quite incredible," Doctor Li explained. "The patient is a young girl, even younger than your brother. But her condition is peculiar... Her body appears perfectly fine from the outside, yet her internal organs and some of her tissues show signs of charring. I still can’t wrap my head around how someone could be ‘tender on the outside but burnt on the inside.’ If I hadn’t personally examined her, I would’ve thought it was a prank. Frankly, with such injuries, anyone else would have been dead long ago! Yet this girl is still alive!"

"And what's more, she seems to know she's facing death and has a surprisingly easygoing attitude about it. She never once asked us to save her life. Whenever the pain becomes unbearable, she comes in for painkillers and prescriptions. To be honest, with a case like this, we usually send patients home to eat something nice instead of admitting them. But for some reason, after meeting with the hospital director, she was personally assigned a special room, and now I’m the one doing her regular checkups and administering painkillers."

"And what's even stranger is that every time she asks for an injection, she brings her own needles! Have you ever heard of a patient bringing their own needles for injections?! In my entire career, I’ve never encountered a patient like that."

"Sounds like a troublesome case," Zhao Yayao said, rubbing her temples.

"The world is a vast place, full of wonders," Scholar Song said calmly from the side—ever since his worldview shattered that day, he felt he could handle any bizarre or extraordinary event without breaking a sweat.

"Thank you for your hard work, Doctor Li. My brother and I won’t disturb you any longer," Zhao Yayao said as she stood up to express her gratitude. She still needed to return to Jiangnan University Town for her medical internship.

Scholar Song followed suit, saying, "Thank you, Doctor Li. Goodbye~"

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At the same time, in Jiangnan University Town Affiliated Hospital, on the fifth floor of Building 8B.

A middle-aged office worker suddenly stopped, gritting his teeth. "I can feel it, finally sensed it! The little sprite from the Su family is right here! Su Aqi... that wretched Aqi!"

After chasing this junior for days, he finally found a lead! This time, he wouldn’t let her slip away again!

But the next moment, his expression changed again—had the aura of the Su family junior vanished once more?
