**Sorry, I Mistook You for Someone Else!**

As they entered the electronic city, Scholar Song accompanied Venerable White to buy a phone, get a phone card, and then purchase a laptop.

The entire process went incredibly smoothly... The prices for the phone and laptop were so affordable that Scholar Song found it hard to believe!

He didn’t even need to haggle; the shop owner offered him a near-cost price for both the laptop and the phone, and even generously threw in a membership card and discount vouchers!

The reason he could secure such a great deal was simply that Venerable White was right behind him, wearing a steady smile the entire time.

Venerable White didn’t need to say a word or do anything at all. Just his presence alone made the shop owner practically jump at the chance to sell, almost giving things away for free.

It was truly an era where one's face value mattered immensely.

After considering this, Scholar Song decisively led Venerable White on another round through the electronic city. He ended up buying two tablets, a DSLR camera that he had been eyeing for a long time, and a small projector!

With Venerable White at his back, he managed to snag everything at great prices.

This was fantastic!

It was like having a maxed-out “Personal Charm +10” skill in a game, enjoying extra discounts when trading with NPCs!

“Sir, once you’ve made your purchases, please keep your invoices and receipts. After spending over ten thousand, there’s a lottery event at the exit of the electronic city with some really nice prizes,” the owner of the camera shop kindly informed him.

The electronic city held such lottery events every few months to boost business, but of course, the prizes were usually just consolation ones.

“Thank you,” Scholar Song replied with a smile, glancing at the array of items he held.

A laptop, two tablets, a DSLR camera, an external hard drive, a small projector... a whole bunch of things.

Oh no... he had inadvertently bought too much, and now both his hands were full. If Venerable White were to stumble, he wouldn’t be able to lend a hand to help!

With that thought in mind, he discreetly glanced at Venerable White.

Venerable White seemed to be in a good mood, fiddling with the phone Scholar Song had bought for him, so he wasn’t likely to suddenly fall into deep thought or drift away.

As if sensing Scholar Song's gaze, Venerable White looked up and asked, “Are we done? Ready to take the bus back? Don’t worry, this time I’ll remember to conceal my aura.”

“No, it’s fine. I suddenly feel like taking a stroll; let’s go a different way!” Scholar Song replied decisively. He absolutely did not want to squeeze into a bus with Venerable White again!

“Okay,” Venerable White said agreeably. He was a very easy-going person, always considerate of his juniors—just as the Hermit of North River had described.

Arriving at the lottery area at the entrance of the electronic city, Scholar Song handed over his shopping receipt. The total came to over twenty thousand, granting him two chances to enter the lottery.

“Please draw here,” a young man said to Scholar Song with a smile, handing him a physical scratch card.

Venerable White watched Scholar Song with curiosity.

“Watch this, I’m a legendary ‘Scratch Card Master,’ hailed as a lucky draw expert since I was a kid!” Scholar Song boasted, blowing on his palm before reaching into the box to pull out a scratch card, which he then scratched open.

The young man leaned over to take a look and laughed, “Congratulations, it’s a consolation prize!”

He then handed over a palm-sized plush bear.

A consolation prize—

Scholar Song chuckled awkwardly as he accepted the small toy. “Hehe, my luck seems a bit off today. Want to give it a try, Venerable White?”

“Sure!” Venerable White smiled widely. He copied Scholar Song, blowing on his palm, and reached into the box to take out a card, scratching it open.

The young man leaned over again and exclaimed loudly, “Congratulations!! Grand prize! A brand-new laptop worth ten thousand! Brother, you’re incredibly lucky!”

“Thank you.” Venerable White accepted the laptop with a calm smile.

That smile was like a captivating glance that left the lottery attendant momentarily dazed.

“Not at all, not at all.” He stood there grinning foolishly, still waving goodbye even after Scholar Song and Venerable White had walked away.

After a moment.

“Wow, that guy was something, right?” the young man suddenly snapped to his senses, anxiously touching his chest.

His heart was racing so fast.

Oh my, what if I’ve turned gay?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In the Ninefold Land group chat.

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain suddenly asked, “Is Scholar Song around?”

Scholar Song was still out and couldn’t respond.

After a long time.

The Master of Snow Wolf Cavern replied, “Looks like he’s out with Venerable White—by the way, Venerable White has been out of seclusion for a while now, so it’s about time we see that strange luck of his erupt, right?”

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain nodded, “Considering the time, it should have started by now.”

“That’s great.” The Master of Snow Wolf Cavern said this with a hint of confusion.

“Yeah, it really is great.” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain sighed, “By the way, has anyone reminded Scholar Song to be cautious of Venerable White's inexplicable luck?”

The Master of Snow Wolf Cavern was surprised. “Huh? Didn’t you remind Scholar Song?”

“Didn’t you guys trick him into taking this task? Why should I remind him?” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain said with a bewildered expression.

“But isn’t it your responsibility as the group leader to announce tasks?” the Master of Snow Wolf Cavern replied.

“……” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

After a long pause.

“I’ll give him a call,” he finally said. “Who has his number? I didn’t save it last time.”

Drunken Moon Philosopher: “I have it; I just topped it up. I’ll send it to you.”

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile, on the way back, Scholar Song intentionally chose a less crowded route.

He led the way, with Venerable White on his right, still fiddling with his phone.

Scholar Song's hands were full, but thankfully he was strong enough that it didn’t feel heavy at all.

All along the way, he kept a careful watch on Venerable White, afraid he might suddenly zone out.

“Haha, why are you staring at me? I’m able to control my aura now,” Venerable White said, feeling a bit uneasy under Scholar Song's gaze and laughing.

“It’s nothing; I’m just worried you might zone out unexpectedly,” Scholar Song replied truthfully.

“I won’t! I’m currently researching all the features on this phone; I won’t zone out, don’t worry!” Venerable White said confidently.

“That’s good. Once we get back, I’ll help you register a chat account,” Scholar Song said while walking.

“Great!” Venerable White chuckled.

…

…

“Found him, Scholar Song!” the Sunflower Cultivator finally spotted his target—just as described in the data, it was a student-like boy with a harmless demeanor.

Next to the target stood a handsome young man, and they were chatting and laughing.

The Sunflower Cultivator sensed that Scholar Song had just opened his meridians and was at a relatively low cultivation level with weak vitality.

The handsome young man beside him was just an ordinary human!

Glancing around, he noticed this was a secluded road with hardly anyone passing by all day!

What a perfect opportunity!

The Sunflower Cultivator felt a surge of determination and strode forward, booming, “Hey, you there! Stop!”

Let’s see how I’m going to catch this Scholar Song!

…

…

Hearing someone shout, Scholar Song curiously turned around to look.

Then he saw a clean-featured, muscular guy dashing toward him.

Scholar Song was puzzled; he didn’t know this person.

“Is he calling us?” Venerable White asked, equally curious as he turned to look.

“Probably not. I don’t know him,” Scholar Song replied.

“Oh,” Venerable White responded casually.

Just as they were speaking, Venerable White suddenly stumbled as if something had tripped him, and he fell forward!

Had he zoned out when he turned his head back?

Scholar Song’s pupils dilated in an instant!

Damn it, despite all the precautions, I never expected this! How could Venerable White trip just by turning his head?

In the blink of an eye!

Scholar Song barely had a moment to think before Venerable White had already hit the ground.

Boom...

The deafening sound echoed like a thunderclap in the clear sky.

“I’m about to fall into a pit!” Scholar Song thought to himself.

Dust flew everywhere.

The next moment, a crater with a diameter of thirty meters appeared at the spot where Venerable White had fallen!

Scholar Song found himself sitting right in the center of the crater.

He quickly patted himself down—unharmed?

Did Venerable White protect him at the last moment?

As the dust settled.

Venerable White calmly got up from the pit, brushing off what little dust there was on him, “Hmm, how did I trip again? Scholar Song, are you okay?”

“I’m fine, no problems here. The things in my hands are fine too,” Scholar Song replied.

Wait a second!

What about the person who called out to them earlier?

Scholar Song opened his eyes, looking in the distance.

The Sunflower Cultivator, who had been running toward them, hadn’t managed to stop in time and had also tumbled into the crater. Fortunately, he landed on the edge, so aside from looking a bit disheveled, he wasn’t injured.

He swallowed hard, staring wide-eyed at Venerable White and Scholar Song in the pit.

At that moment, his brain felt as empty as the crater itself, completely jammed.

After a while, he scrambled to his feet, trying to climb out of the pit.

“Excuse me, friend, were you calling out to me earlier?” Scholar Song chuckled awkwardly, “It’s quite strange; how did a sinkhole suddenly appear here? Luckily, we’re all okay!”

A sinkhole, my foot! You lying bastard with your eyes wide open! I clearly saw that handsome young man beside you fall and directly create this huge hole!

The Sunflower Cultivator roared in his heart, but his face showed only terror, “S-sorry, I mistook you for someone else! I thought you looked like a friend of mine when I saw your back. The moment you turned around, I realized I’d made a mistake, and I really missed my friend!”

“Well, I’ll be on my way now. This sinkhole is quite scary,” the Sunflower Cultivator turned around and, using all his strength, fled away.

“Mistaken identity?” Scholar Song rubbed his chin, feeling something was off with this guy.

At this moment, Venerable White said, “Scholar Song, let’s get out of here; I need to use the Earth Flattening Spell.”

“No, no, no, let’s just leave, Venerable! Let’s pretend this is just a sinkhole!” Scholar Song gulped. Although this place was remote, that massive sound earlier would have definitely attracted attention. Who knows how many eyes were watching from afar right now?

Suddenly multiple craters appearing could be explained away as a sinkhole.

But if Venerable White used the Earth Flattening Spell to fill it in, it would look like a bizarre supernatural event, and that would cause more trouble.

Sometimes, the best course of action is to simply walk away!
