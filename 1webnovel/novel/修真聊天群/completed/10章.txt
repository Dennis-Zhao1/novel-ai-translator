**A Little Interlude on the Streets**

Scholar Song had racked his brain for a while, recognizing that the name "Luoxin District" sounded familiar, but he just couldn't place it. Ah, it was the famed food paradise!

But wait, didn't Fay Yu mention that Luoxin District was in J City? This was clearly in the Jiangnan region.

Could it be that Fay Yu mixed up the location?

Or perhaps both J City and the Jiangnan region had a Luoxin District?

That was certainly possible, as city names and county names rarely duplicated.

However, town names, districts, and villages often did, so it was more likely that Fay Yu was talking about the one in J City and wouldn’t have come all the way to Jiangnan.

Since he was out to clear his mind, Scholar Song decided not to think too much about it.

He walked, ate, and strolled around, enjoying the sights.

He couldn't tell how long he had been wandering, but after feeling a bit tired, he grabbed two more crispy chicken rolls and plopped himself down on a bench in the district, taking a break.

……

Across from the resting area was a large square in Luoxin District, bustling with activity.

The weather had just turned warm, but that didn’t stop the women from flaunting their love for beauty.

Everywhere, there were dazzling tank tops, crop tops, mini skirts, low-rise hot pants, high heels, and pointed sandals. The lovely necks, ample chests, slender waists, and shapely legs added countless styles and vibrant colors to the square of Luoxin District.

Just sitting in the resting area, Scholar Song could see countless long legs shimmering like rays of light.

The spot he casually picked to take a break was an excellent place to enjoy the view—next to him, three guys were seriously rating the long legs of passing beauties.

“Did you see that red dress under the electronic billboard? That figure, those legs, at least an 80!” shouted the chubby guy with thick glasses, pointing excitedly.

“Ah Xu, your standards need some work. I’d say 73 is generous. Sure, her legs are long, but overall, she’s a bit too skinny. Plus, the proportions of her calves make them look slightly short, affecting the overall appeal,” chimed in a handsome, sunny guy, adopting an expert posture.

“Really?” The chubby guy scratched his head and took a closer look, realizing the sunny guy had a point. But honestly, it was hard to notice at first.

“I think it’s at least a 77, maybe even higher. After all, it’s rare to see legs like that in real life. We can’t compare them to those online models,” said the short-haired guy, lounging back in his chair with a lazy demeanor.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but glance in the direction the chubby guy was pointing. There was indeed a woman in a tight red dress striding confidently by, her long legs clad in crystal sandals.

Women bold enough to wear such figure-hugging dresses usually had a lot of confidence in their bodies.

While Scholar Song didn’t have a leg-fetish, he had to admit the woman in the red dress was stunning, her thighs long and fair, clearly well-maintained.

It’s often said that men look at women first for their faces, then for their chests as they mature, until finally, they appreciate their legs. Scholar Song felt he was still not quite a mature man—he had no particular fascination with legs. Even amidst the sea of fair thighs around him, he felt no impulse and certainly didn't share the same desire to rate them like his three companions.

He found it hard to understand why his friends were so obsessed with the long legs of celebrities from neighboring countries.

Legs are just legs; men have them too. A woman’s legs might be a bit fairer or smoother, but what’s so special about that?

That was his honest thought, and if the three guys beside him knew, they would probably shower him with ridicule.

“Look! A perfect score, a perfect score!” Suddenly, the chubby guy exclaimed, his voice rising with excitement.

“Where?” the sunny guy asked, though he knew the chubby guy's taste, while not top-notch, was still decent. A perfect score was not something to be thrown around lightly.

The lazy short-haired guy sat up, curious, following the chubby guy’s gaze.

Still beneath the LED screen, a tall, graceful figure emerged from around the corner. She was dragging a massive suitcase, yet she looked completely at ease.

Her long black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall, swaying in the wind.

She was tall, and even in her sneakers, it was obvious that her legs towered over the crowd. Each of her steps was the equivalent of two or three normal strides.

She was like a natural movie star; even standing still in a crowd, she commanded attention. It was as if she was born to be the center of attention.

The black-haired beauty moved quickly, soon catching up to the red-dressed woman, who had just been critiqued by the three guys. In a way, the red dress became a mere backdrop. As the black-haired beauty swept past, her legs stood in stark contrast to the other woman’s.

“Ah Xu, no doubt about it! That’s definitely a perfect score!” The sunny guy immediately jumped up, patting down his clothes and smoothing his hair.

“What are you doing?” the short-haired guy asked.

“Going for it! A woman this perfect is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. So, no matter if I succeed or fail, I have to go ask her out. Otherwise, I’ll regret it for the rest of my life!” The sunny guy flashed a bright smile, his white teeth glimmering in the sunlight. He certainly had a knack for attracting women, the kind of guy who had the makings of a life winner—good-looking and charming.

Even if he failed, it wouldn’t be a loss; if he succeeded, he’d hit the jackpot! It was a win-win situation, so why not go for it?

A true man should be fearless and brave at moments like this!

With that, the sunny guy pushed his way through the crowd, heading toward the black-haired beauty.

……

A mere two minutes later, the sunny guy returned, head hanging low, looking dejected.

“Failed? That was quick?” The chubby guy queried, surprised—though he expected his friend to fail, he thought at least the guy could have managed a chat, given his decent looks and charm. How could he fail so quickly? With his skills, even if he struck out, he could have talked with the beauty for a while, right?

“I didn’t even get a chance to ask! That beauty’s legs were so long and she walked so fast; one of her steps was like three of mine! I was practically jogging but still couldn’t catch up!” The sunny guy lamented, tears welling up in his eyes.

“……” The short-haired guy was speechless.

Scholar Song nearly burst out laughing—these three guys were hilarious.

But honestly, that black-haired beauty’s legs really were eye-catching.

In today’s world, where the internet flourishes and countless beauties emerge, people often become desensitized to the idea of ‘beauty.’

Yet real beauty, the kind that stands out amidst the crowd, will always captivate attention.

For instance, that black-haired beauty was the kind of unforgettable face that once seen, one would carry in their memory for a long time.

……

The chance encounter with a beauty was merely a little side note to his street stroll.

After resting for a bit, Scholar Song got back up to continue his exploration.

“I should grab some snacks to take back with me,” he thought. His roommates had taken care of him during his recent cold, so since he was in this food paradise, he couldn’t return empty-handed.

Not knowing what they liked to eat, he decided to just grab a bit of everything to share with them.
