**Black Box, Red Bills, and... Qi Blood Pills!**

Upon returning to Jiangnan University Town, Scholar Song didn’t rush to find Zhao Yaya. Instead, he headed straight to the five-story building purchased by the Alchemical Sage.

He was still carrying the black handbag belonging to the head of the clan, and it was highly likely that it contained the four rare medicinal herbs he had acquired. If Zhao Yaya were to discover these herbs inside the bag, Scholar Song would be in deep trouble—no, he wouldn't be able to wash away the consequences even if he jumped into the Yellow River... or the Pacific Ocean for that matter.

Without a doubt, Zhao Yaya would call Mother Song, and before he knew it, she would be on a flight to Jiangnan University Town the very next day.

And who knows what other terrifying or misleading items could be hidden inside that handbag?

How could he possibly face Zhao Yaya without first dealing with this bag?

With a key in hand, he opened the door and climbed to the third floor. There, he found the Alchemical Sage crouched in a corner, engrossed in his phone, while there was no sign of Jiang Ziyan.

“Hey, senior, busy?” Scholar Song approached the Alchemical Sage and asked.

Since arriving in Jiangnan University Town, the Alchemical Sage had been busy refining body-strengthening solutions. It was rare to see him taking a break!

“Oh, Scholar Song, you’re back!” The Alchemical Sage didn’t even look up, his fingers moving rapidly across the screen.

“What are you playing?” Scholar Song leaned in to take a look.

Then, his entire expression soured.

The Alchemical Sage was actually stealing vegetables from someone else's farm in a game. In his friends list for stealing vegetables, Scholar Song could see familiar names like the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, the Hermit of North River, and members of the Ninefold Land like the Yunyue Monk and others—famous figures in the cultivation community.

What’s going on? Are all the senior cultivators in the world just sitting around with nothing to do? So many of them are wasting their time playing a game about stealing vegetables?

Their disciples would be crying, for sure!

Their sect leaders would be crying too!

“Done! That guy from North River even set up an automatic vegetable collection program, but it’s useless~~ I already set the alarm, so I can steal his veggies in no time. He’s so naive; the speed of the automatic program can’t compare to my hand speed!” The Alchemical Sage said proudly to Scholar Song.

“Senior… if you practiced typing as much as you played games, you’d be much better off!” Scholar Song thought to himself.

“By the way, Scholar Song, I’m not saying this to criticize you, but don’t just hoard coins like a miser. When you have enough money, upgrade your land level so your vegetables grow faster. Sharpening the axe doesn’t hinder the cutting of wood!” The Alchemical Sage lectured him earnestly.

Scholar Song was at a loss for words.

“Right, did you need something from me?” The Alchemical Sage finally returned to the main topic.

Scholar Song silently nodded, placing the black handbag on the coffee table. “I’d like to ask you to check if there are any traps or tricks inside this handbag. I got it from the head of the clan after taking down the claw beast. The other party is a wicked ghost cultivator, so I don’t dare open it lightly.”

“You’re wise to think of that,” the Alchemical Sage nodded. Scholar Song had many good qualities—brave and meticulous. In terms of character, he was quite suited for the cultivation path. The only pity was that he was a bit older, having missed out on the innate qi from birth.

If only he had encountered the world of cultivators earlier… but unfortunately, there are no ifs in the world.

The Alchemical Sage took the black handbag and pressed his palm against it.

“Indeed, there have been a few tricks played here, but these little tricks are nothing I can’t handle.” He chuckled, his true qi swirling around his right palm.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

The sound of glass shattering echoed from the black handbag, accompanied by faint, wailing ghostly cries...

“All done. You can open it now.” The Alchemical Sage returned the handbag to Scholar Song.

Scholar Song reached out and opened the black handbag.

What greeted him was a stack of neatly arranged red bills, each bundle containing a hundred thousand, totaling seven bundles. Another bundle had been split into nine smaller stacks with some loose change, likely the amount the head of the clan had used recently.

In total, there were about eight hundred thousand red bills. While that might just be a number in a bank account, having that much cash piled up in front of him was quite a visual shock.

However, as Scholar Song stared at the mountain of red bills, a wave of disappointment washed over him.

Given the identity of the head of the clan, he had expected the handbag to contain some valuable treasures from the cultivation world. Instead, all he found was a pile of cash...

The higher the expectation, the greater the disappointment.

Taking a deep breath, Scholar Song thought, “Fine, red bills are red bills. I’ve been short on money lately anyway.” He planned to look for a well-equipped gym nearby and buy various fitness equipment. Additionally, to ensure his qi and blood remained abundant, he needed to maintain a quality diet.

Thinking about it this way, eight hundred thousand didn’t seem so bad. It was like in a game—defeating a high-level boss might not yield excellent equipment, but there would definitely be plenty of coins as a reward.

The Alchemical Sage chuckled gently, reminding him, “Little friend, don’t let these mundane riches cloud your judgment. This small amount of money is nothing. Once you successfully establish your foundation, you’ll have as much as you want. This cash is merely a distraction; the real treasures are hidden beneath the money, in the secret compartment of the bag.”

“Secret compartment?” Scholar Song promptly dumped all the money out and indeed discovered a partition board at the bottom of the handbag, which could easily be overlooked if one wasn’t paying attention.

Excitement surged in Scholar Song’s heart!

He lifted the partition board and found many small bottles, about the size of gum containers. There were fourteen small bottles in total, in red and blue colors. Additionally, there was a metal box the size of an A5 notebook.

He first picked up one of the blue bottles and asked, “Senior, is there any trickery with this bottle?”

“Don’t worry, I’ve cleared all the little tricks from inside the bag.” The Alchemical Sage tossed his head back, causing his wild braids and various adorable ornaments to jingle together, producing a crisp sound.

What a hairdo that was to comment on!

Scholar Song tightened his expression, stifling a laugh—what if the Alchemical Sage actually liked his hairstyle? He didn’t want to risk offending him.

The blue bottles were plentiful, totaling twelve. He opened one and peered inside.

Inside, there was a thick, black liquid, accompanied by a foul odor: “Body-strengthening liquid?!”

The color and smell confirmed it undoubtedly was body-strengthening liquid!

The Alchemical Sage sniffed and replied, “That’s right, and it’s the unrefined version. The quality is decent. Once you train for a month and your physical constitution is sufficiently enhanced, you can take this old version of body-strengthening liquid. Its potency is stronger; one dose is equivalent to three doses of the simplified version you have now.”

“Just in time! Senior North River warned me that even if the herbs Fay Yu sent were fully refined into body-strengthening liquid, they still might not be enough for my foundation establishment. With this batch of body-strengthening liquid, I should have enough to last until I complete my foundation establishment, right?” Scholar Song said with a smile.

“You’ll have more than enough, and there might even be some left over.” The Alchemical Sage replied.

More than enough? That was great news!

Next, Scholar Song opened one of the red bottles.

Inside the red bottle were several small pills, a total of eleven pills. As soon as he opened it, a fragrant aroma wafted out. Another red bottle contained fifteen pills.

“Senior, what kind of pills are these?” Scholar Song inquired.

The Alchemical Sage sniffed and then made a strange face, responding, “Qi Blood Pills, and their quality is all acceptable!”
