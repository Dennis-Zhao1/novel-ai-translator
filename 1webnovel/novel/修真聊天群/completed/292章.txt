Scholar Song, is he truly a martial arts master?!

Joseph was struck by how dashing his master appeared as he raced forward. To the untrained eye, it seemed as if Scholar Song was merely strolling, but in reality, his speed was astonishing, shrinking his figure to the size of a mere dot in the blink of an eye.

This was the hallmark of the Confucian sect's techniques—style, one must always maintain their style!

A well-groomed hairstyle during a PK—this was the essence of a Confucian cultivator.

"Is that lightness skill?!" Joseph blinked in amazement. He began to ponder an important question—now that he had finally encountered his master again and learned his name, should he follow him closely? It would be best to move nearby so he could learn more skills!

……

……

A dozen breaths later.

As Scholar Song swiftly approached the city gate, two massive eagles swooped down simultaneously!

They dove fiercely, their talons ready to seize their prey.

One eagle captured a certain Mr. Gao and an African uncle; the other eagle, arriving slightly later, snagged a female white-collar worker and a slightly plump flight attendant.

“Mr. Gao!” Mei cried out, leaping forward in an attempt to help.

Fortunately, Sister Lu Fei was right there, tightly holding Mei back...

After catching their targets, the two eagles flapped their enormous wings, creating a strong gust of wind.

Their massive bodies began to ascend again!

Caught in the eagle's talons, Mr. Gao sighed heavily—just moments ago, in a moment of crisis, he had shoved his girlfriend Mei aside and was now whisked away by the eagle.

He sighed deeply, feeling that his luck had truly run out lately... Ever since that guy Zhuge Zhongyang traveled thousands of miles to find him, his luck had plummeted from the peak of A-grade luck to a dismal E-grade.

Ten days ago, his beloved cat, which he had raised for years, suddenly dashed onto the road and was hit by a car. He was heartbroken.

Nine days ago, the three goldfish he had just adopted died because his mother, bored, fed them too much, causing them to explode. He was heartbroken.

Eight days ago, a story he had secretly written online under a pseudonym got flagged by the censorship gods for being too suggestive. Despite his careful wording, he was still caught. He was heartbroken.

Three days ago, his romantic getaway with Mei was interrupted when Zhuge Zhongyang showed up unannounced. He was heartbroken again.

And today, their plane had an accident, forcing an emergency landing in a mysterious place. Now, inexplicably, he found himself captured by a giant eagle.

Soon enough, he would likely be swallowed whole by this massive creature, only to be excreted later. It was truly a tragic tale.

Just as Mr. Gao was lost in these morose thoughts, a figure suddenly sprinted toward him from below. The speed was astonishing, comparable to that of a car.

It was Scholar Song!

Seeing his good roommate, Mr. Gao gritted his teeth in determination.

He held back tears—he couldn't cry. Before his demise, he wanted to maintain a strong, brave image for Mei.

“Song, take good care of Mei for me. We'll be brothers in our next life!” Mr. Gao shouted dramatically, waving fervently at Scholar Song.

Mei, watching from the city gate, immediately burst into tears.

……

……

Scholar Song gritted his teeth, realizing he was still a step too late... but thankfully, it wasn't too late yet; there was still a chance to remedy the situation!

“Get down here!” Scholar Song shouted, his voice thunderous and deafening! The soaring eagles were startled by the sound.

“Song, don’t do anything foolish!” Mr. Gao called out from mid-air, while the eagle had already ascended vertically for over ten meters.

The two eagles continued flapping their wings vigorously, climbing higher and higher; they were about to soar into the clouds.

In that moment, Scholar Song suddenly leaped toward the nearby city wall, landing firmly upon it!

In the next instant, he began running straight up the wall.

The forty-meter high wall was tiered like a pyramid in four layers, each over ten meters tall. It was a sheer vertical surface with no places to gain a foothold.

Even the most skilled rock climber would struggle against such a wall without specialized equipment.

Yet at this moment, Scholar Song ran as if on flat ground, sprinting straight up the wall with incredible speed.

In that moment, it seemed like the laws of gravity had lost their hold on Scholar Song.

He ran with all his might, using the tiered sections of the wall to gain momentum. With each ten-meter elevation, he would leap again, propelling himself further up the wall.

Fortunately, the wall’s tiered design allowed him to achieve this feat.

Otherwise, with his current skill level in the "Gentleman’s Long Journey," he wouldn’t have been able to scale such a height in one go.

Those watching from the city gate were dumbfounded. A person was actually running up a nearly vertical wall that was over forty meters high!

Is this something a human could do?

Everyone’s minds immediately recalled the enthusiastic Uncle Joseph who called Scholar Song "Master Wet."

Could it be that Scholar Song is truly a martial arts master?

Martial arts masters, the kind that only appear in films and dramas—do they really exist in reality?

……

……

In the blink of an eye, Scholar Song had reached the top of the forty-meter wall!

Just then, the two soaring eagles arrived at that height—Scholar Song was now level with them.

“Leave them!” Scholar Song gritted his teeth and stomped down hard on the wall, propelling himself nearly seven meters into the air, landing squarely on the back of the first eagle!

The first eagle, carrying the flight attendant and the female office worker, was completely unprepared for this tiny figure to suddenly appear on its back, caught off guard.

In the next moment, Scholar Song delivered a powerful kick onto the eagle’s back. The energy surged through his four vital points, all concentrated into his right leg.

This kick carried the force of a thousand pounds, landing hard on the eagle’s back!

The eagle let out a shriek, its body instinctively tumbling downward.

Using the force from that kick, Scholar Song leaped high again, gripping his treasured blade, “Bash Broken,” preparing to strike at the other eagle—this one carrying Mr. Gao and the African uncle, which was his true target.

Scholar Song was neither a saint nor an enlightened master; he couldn’t regard all lives as equal.

In his heart, he cared about the safety of all four passengers that had been captured—but compared to them, he was naturally more concerned about the safety of his roommate, Mr. Gao.

Among the two eagles, Scholar Song intended to deal with the one carrying Mr. Gao first.

He absolutely couldn’t let it escape; otherwise, in this vast, mysterious island teeming with danger, Mr. Gao’s chances of survival would be slim to none.

……

……

He had to strike true, not allowing it a chance to flee.

“Flame Blade!” Scholar Song called out, activating the skill from his bronze ring without hesitation.

The Flame Blade could be used three times a day, and this was his final use for today; to use it again, he would have to wait twenty-four hours after the first strike.

Brilliant flames surged into Scholar Song’s hand, the fire flickering and the blade’s aura intensifying.

The eagle's eyes filled with fear; it instinctively realized that the flames in the hands of this tiny creature held the power to kill it.

It couldn’t let the flames touch it.

“Gather!” the eagle screeched, flapping its wings frantically, ascending even higher!

“Die for me!” Scholar Song shouted, gripping his blade tightly and swinging it down with all his might.

The Flame Blade transformed into a crescent arc of energy, slashing toward the eagle’s neck...

“It has to succeed!” Scholar Song gritted his teeth mid-air.

Whoosh! The flame blade sliced toward the eagle's neck.

The eagle desperately flapped its wings, increasing its speed to climb higher and higher.

One must never underestimate any creature’s will to survive… In the face of a life-and-death crisis, every being can unleash unimaginable potential.

At that moment, the eagle was fully unleashing its potential.

The flame blade’s energy was almost instantaneous, poised to strike its neck when, at that critical moment, the eagle forcefully beat its wings, elevating its body and arching its neck backward with all its might.

The blade of flame grazed past the eagle’s neck… the fiery blade sheared off a large tuft of feathers from its neck and chest.

Blood gushed from the eagle’s neck, but it had narrowly escaped death.

“It’s not over yet!” Scholar Song opened his left hand, revealing a shimmering "talisman" glowing with light.

He had been prepared; after all, the Flame Blade was a skill tied to the bronze ring, and he couldn’t control its execution as freely as he wished.

Fortunately, he still had one last sword talisman. Although it felt slightly wasteful to use a talisman capable of unleashing the power equivalent to a third-grade cultivator against this enormous eagle, for the sake of saving his friend, Scholar Song had no time to think about that.

“Sword!” he shouted firmly.

However… the expected sword energy did not shoot out.

How could this be? Scholar Song glanced at the talisman in his hand, his face suddenly turning pale.

He wasn’t holding a sword talisman; instead, he had mistakenly grabbed an exorcism talisman.

At this moment, Scholar Song’s body lost its upward momentum, plummeting toward the ground.

The eagle, carrying Mr. Gao, flapped its wings, now pulling away from him.

How could this happen?! Why was the talisman in his hand the exorcism talisman? There was no time to switch; all the remaining talismans were in his backpack!

Damn it, he had let his guard down… because of this oversight, he had lost his last opportunity to save his roommate.

If only his first strike with the Flame Blade had hit the eagle, if only he hadn’t been so careless, if only his power were stronger, it wouldn’t have ended up this way.

Scholar Song’s heart burned with anger—anger at his own negligence, anger at his lack of strength.

This fury flared up in his heart, reaching a boiling point.

—At that moment, an image filled with flames suddenly flashed through his mind.

It was Daoist Chixiao, wielding a branch as a sword, gently slashing, causing flames to erupt and engulfing the heavens, scorching the earth, devouring the world!
