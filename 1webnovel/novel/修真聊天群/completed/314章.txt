**The Damaged Southern Heavenly Gate**

A woman in a black dress gritted her teeth and ran frantically.

The bull-like man was clearly not the sharpest tool in the shed—this little island was small, but the ocean surrounding it was vast and boundless. She wasn’t some ghost with a ‘restricted activity range’ who had to stay on this tiny island.

As long as she could escape the island and enter the ocean, the vast waters would allow her to leap like a fish. With her excellent swimming skills, there was no way she would be caught. As she sprinted towards the ocean, the woman in the black dress ripped off the hem of her skirt, ensuring that it wouldn't hinder her movements in the water.

“Yuan Si, stop her!” shouted the wolf-like man, using both hands and feet to get closer.

Yuan Si, a tall man with long limbs, desperately increased his speed, rapidly closing the distance between him and the woman in black, Chu Chu.

But alas, Yuan Si was still a step too slow.

Chu Chu had already approached the ocean, leaping gracefully into the air like a nimble mermaid, and in an instant, she vanished beneath the waves. Clearly, she was an exceptional swimmer…

Though Niu Er, Yuan Si, and the wolf-like man could swim, their skills paled in comparison to that of the woman in black.

“She escaped into the water… what a pity! We had a chance to enjoy that little beauty,” Niu Er lamented as he stood on the shore, scratching his nose.

The wolf-like man rolled his eyes; he was at a loss when it came to the dim-witted Niu Er.

Then, he reached up and flicked his communicator at his ear. “Shark Nine, Whale Eight, that girl has already made it to the water. You two take some men and capture her.”

After finishing that, he tapped on the communicator again, switching channels. “Fox Ten, everything is ready. You can prepare to act. We’ll try to force this little girl into a corner to create an opportunity for you. Remember, you only have one chance—get that ‘Sword Technique’ from her.”

They were quite envious of the ‘Sword Technique’ that the Chu family had obtained.

The ‘Void Sword Sect’ thought they were keeping the news under wraps, but several factions already knew that the Chu family had gotten their hands on the ‘Sword Technique.’ Most of those who were aware of this information were powerful families or sects that wouldn’t care about a mere sword technique.

The Void Sword Sect was the small sect that was constantly making things difficult for the Chu family.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On Heavenly Island, outside the Nine Lantern Temple, near a sea of ‘flawed beauty’ flowers.

“Roar~~” A roar erupted, sounding like a lion’s roar, deafening and making one’s heart tighten inexplicably, instilling fear.

This was the ‘Lion’s Roar Technique’ from the Buddhist school.

Scholar Song, under the guidance of the Nine Lantern Girl, had started practicing this technique. At this moment, his roar already vaguely carried the majesty of a lion king.

The Nine Lantern Girl meditated in mid-air, her body supported by two golden lotuses. “Not bad! After just a few lessons, you’ve grasped the essence of the ‘Lion’s Roar Technique.’ What you need now is to practice diligently. Also, if you can awaken your mouth aperture talent when breaking through, combining it with the Lion’s Roar will yield excellent results.”

After saying this, she turned her gaze towards the grass beside Scholar Song, where Mistress Scallion rested on the Insight Stone. “You should try too.”

A little mouth poked out from Mistress Scallion’s green shoots. Then, she too let out a long cry: “Meow~”

Scholar Song: “…”

Nine Lantern: “…”

“Are you trying to be cute? I taught you the Lion’s Roar Technique, so give me a proper lion-like roar!” Nine Lantern struggled to remain composed. “I’ll give you another chance—let it out loud and strong!”

Mistress Scallion swayed in the wind, seemingly gathering strength.

After a moment, her little mouth opened: “Meow meow meow meow~~”

The ‘angry vein’ on Nine Lantern’s forehead throbbed.

“Be serious! I’m teaching you the ‘Lion’s Roar Technique,’ not ‘Cat’s Meow Technique!’ If you keep meowing like a cat, I’ll pluck your new green shoots! One last chance—try it like Scholar Song and give me a heartfelt roar!” Nine Lantern said, her smile taking on a terrifying edge.

Mistress Scallion’s body trembled violently.

Then, her shoots shook even more vigorously; this time, it seemed she had gathered enough power: “Mew~~ Mew~~ Wuwuwu~~”

By the end, Mistress Scallion was nearly in tears…

The ‘angry vein’ on Nine Lantern’s forehead throbbed three times in succession.

Seeing this, Scholar Song hurriedly spoke up for Mistress Scallion, “Cough, cough, Nine Lantern, please don’t be angry. Look at Mistress Scallion; she’s clearly not doing it intentionally. Maybe this technique just doesn’t suit her? Besides, she’s quite small right now. Perhaps when she returns to her human form someday, she can master the ‘Lion’s Roar Technique,’ right?”

Nine Lantern rubbed her temples. “Fine, Mistress Scallion’s ‘Lion’s Roar Technique’ will be your responsibility from now on. I won’t deal with it anymore!”

Scholar Song smiled awkwardly, putting away the Insight Stone and Mistress Scallion.

Mistress Scallion was immediately moved to tears.

Nine Lantern waved her hand and said, “Alright, I’ve taught you the essence of the ‘Lion’s Roar Technique.’ Once you leave the island, practice it well; it’ll greatly benefit your breakthrough of the ‘mouth aperture.’”

Having said that, she stood up, her golden lotuses supporting her as she flew to Scholar Song’s side. She extended her hand toward him. “Let’s go; I’ll take you off the island.”

Scholar Song’s heart stirred—finally, they were leaving Heavenly Island.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In the air above Heavenly Island, a massive red moon had appeared at some point.

Nine Lantern held Scholar Song’s hand, stepping on the golden lotuses, ascending step by step.

With each step she took, the lotus beneath her feet would disappear, only to be replaced by a new one blooming where she would next step.

Flowers bloomed and withered, with each step revealing golden lotuses.

How stylish, Scholar Song thought to himself.

It’s a pity this is a Buddhist technique, or else it would be quite dashing if a scholarly-looking man stepped through the void, one golden lotus at a time.

“Miss Nine Lantern, are we heading to the most mysterious part of Heavenly Island?” Scholar Song inquired.

Next would be the process of sealing memories, right?

However, he was curious as to why every elder in the group willingly sealed their memories to leave Heavenly Island.

What kind of secrets were hidden in this Heavenly Island that would make the elders willing to seal their memories and not disclose its mysteries?

“The place we’re going next is the true ‘Heavenly Realm,’” Nine Lantern replied with a smile.

The true ‘Heavenly Realm’? Then, is it somewhere in the sky? Scholar Song wondered.

As their figures rose higher, Scholar Song unexpectedly spotted a few black dots at the edge of the jungle—Professor and his group, who had separated from them after disembarking the plane.

“Miss Nine Lantern, um… if possible, could you please look after those people? After all, Heavenly Island is fraught with dangers, and they are just ordinary folk. They could easily run into trouble on the island,” Scholar Song implored.

The only thing he could do now was plead for the safety of these passengers with Nine Lantern. Whether she agreed or not was beyond his control.

“Don’t worry, these ordinary people won’t be in life-threatening danger on Heavenly Island. However, they won’t be forced to leave. They will have to find the ancient city on their own, and when they wish to leave, someone will guide them to the ‘Starry Home’ to complete their transaction and exit Heavenly Island,” Nine Lantern reassured him.

With her response, Scholar Song felt a little more at ease.

The two continued to ascend.

Finally… they flew up to the massive red moon.

At that moment, Scholar Song realized this wasn’t just a red moon, but a red tunnel, a long passageway.

The tunnel emitted a red glow, and when looking up from below, one could easily mistake it for a moon.

“Let’s go in,” Nine Lantern said, leading the way into the red tunnel.

Scholar Song, holding her hand, stepped into the passage.

Speaking of which—he had been holding hands with Nine Lantern for quite some time now. She wouldn’t end up pregnant, would she?

Puh puh puh puh!

……

……

After entering the red tunnel and walking about a hundred meters, Scholar Song felt his eyes brighten.

What appeared before him was a fairyland shrouded in auspicious energy, with myriad golden lights flashing and purple mist swirling. Above thick clouds, there stood an enormous portal.

The portal was a deep blue, as if forged of glazed glass; it sparkled brightly, adorned like a treasure!

On the door was a plaque inscribed with the three characters “Southern Heavenly Gate,” radiating brilliant light.

However, these three characters seemed to have been written in two different styles.

Half of the characters for ‘Southern’ and ‘Heaven’ were written in one style, while the other half of ‘Heaven’ and the character for ‘Gate’ were written in another style.

It appeared as if these three characters had been split in half before someone had tried to mend them.

Not only did these three characters display such a phenomenon, but the massive, magnificent portal also bore many signs of repair.

At first glance, due to its brilliant radiance, it was easy to overlook the signs of past damage. But upon closer inspection, Scholar Song could see numerous imperfections on the “Southern Heavenly Gate.”

“Southern Heavenly Gate? The Southern Heavenly Gate from mythology?” Scholar Song turned to gaze at Nine Lantern.

The Southern Heavenly Gate itself wasn’t anything special; there were plenty of ‘Southern Heavenly Gates’ throughout Huaxia. However, the one before him inevitably reminded him of the mythological Southern Heavenly Gate in the celestial realm. Coupled with the title of this place, ‘Heavenly Island,’ could it be that this Heavenly Island is the so-called ‘Celestial Court’ that governs the three realms and ten directions of all beings?

“Indeed, it’s the Southern Heavenly Gate, but it’s not the celestial court you are familiar with from mythology,” Nine Lantern sighed deeply as she gazed at the resplendent portal.

“What exactly happened?” Scholar Song asked, intrigued as he looked at the severely damaged and repeatedly repaired Southern Heavenly Gate.

“Every practitioner who comes here asks this question,” Nine Lantern replied.

Not just practitioners; any Huaxia person aware of the myths would undoubtedly ask this question, Scholar Song thought to himself.

Nine Lantern began to narrate, “According to the descriptions given to me by the elders… the celestial court exploded. Hmm, the celestial court I speak of is entirely different from the ‘myth’ you know. The appearance of the ‘Southern Heavenly Gate’ should just be a coincidence.”
