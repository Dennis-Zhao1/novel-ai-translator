**Can You Hold On?**

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain quickly dialed Scholar Song's number. After listening to a pleasant ringtone that repeated three times, he heard, "Sorry, the number you have dialed is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later!"

With a sigh, the Immortal Sage hung up the phone. "What could young Scholar Song be doing? How can he not even pick up the phone?"

At that moment, Scholar Song was busy making a contract with a Phantom Spirit. With his phone on silent, there was no way for him to answer.

"Should I try sending him a voice transmission across a thousand miles?" The Immortal Sage pondered to himself.

But then he shook his head. Even though Scholar Song possessed a ‘Thousand-Mile Voice Transmission Flute,’ his strength was insufficient. If they were to communicate, it would only be a one-way conversation—Scholar Song could hear but not speak back.

If the Venerable White happened to be right next to Scholar Song, and heard their conversation, it would be quite awkward.

"Well, I’ll just try again later. Tomorrow, the first batch of vehicles will be delivered to that parking lot in Jiangnan. I can also share some stories about Venerable White with Scholar Song then!"

The Immortal Sage thought to himself.

Meanwhile, taking advantage of the moment before midnight, Venerable White was re-establishing the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar’ formation.

This time he didn’t use ‘Ghost Dragon’s Tears,’ as the Phantom Spirits had already broken free from the Soul Freezing Ice Pearl, rendering the tears unnecessary.

After setting up the Five Elements Contract Spirit Formation, Venerable White placed a fist-sized Phantom Spirit in the center of the altar, without needing to use any sealing formations.

The Phantom Spirit squirmed uncomfortably for a moment but then obediently stayed in place. It was too weak to move—and even if it could, it wouldn’t dare to!

“Scholar Song, skip the earlier steps of the ‘Five Calamities’ and activate the formation directly. Form a contract with it,” Venerable White reminded.

Right now, the Phantom Spirit was extremely weak. Its ‘rank’ had temporarily dropped, and it couldn't even use its golden shield. At that point, not to mention the Five Calamities, even the first calamity, ‘Golden Calamity,’ might take its little life.

Scholar Song nodded and began to chant a spell, circling the formation while performing a great incantation. He then placed both hands on the formation to activate the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar.’

Once activated, he skipped the preliminary steps and directly unleashed the power of the altar, transforming it into a ‘contract’ that reached out to the Phantom Spirit.

The Phantom Spirit trembled slightly; this time, it did not resist and willingly accepted the contract. It was too weak, and if it didn’t receive some nourishment soon, it might risk dissipating into nothingness.

Moreover, after condensing its ‘Phantom Spirit Core,’ its intelligence had increased significantly, making it understand the wisdom of yielding to avoid immediate disaster.

In order to survive and recover quickly, after forming the contract with Scholar Song, it actively opened its consciousness and energy channels, linking itself to him.

This way, Scholar Song’s synchronization with it for ‘consciousness sharing and energy sharing’ would consume much less time.

Within about a week, he would be able to complete the synchronization with the Phantom Spirit.

With everything set, Scholar Song called out, “Contract, established!”

The five elemental stones and various materials on the altar lit up, and finally, the power of the formation transformed into two contract runes, one merging into the Phantom Spirit's body and the other sinking into Scholar Song’s heart.

“Success!” Scholar Song exclaimed joyfully. Achieving the contract in just two tries was far better than he had expected.

After all, Fay Yu had failed several times!

“Well done,” Venerable White continued to instruct. “While the contract is fresh and the effects of the ‘Five Elements Contract Spirit Altar’ haven’t dissipated, quickly operate your meditation method to understand the connection between you and the Phantom Spirit. Strike while the iron is hot.”

“Yes!” Scholar Song immediately sat cross-legged and activated the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra.’

His spiritual energy spread from his ‘True Self,’ attempting to connect with the Phantom Spirit through the contract rune.

Within the formation, the Phantom Spirit's body floated up and, following the contract rune from the heart, entered Scholar Song’s body.

Suddenly, Scholar Song felt a weightlessness, like being in an elevator. Then, his senses connected with those of the Phantom Spirit!

He could perceive the outside world through the Phantom Spirit!

The Phantom Spirit had human-like senses; its hearing, vision, smell, and touch were all similar to those of a human.

However, its vision could transform; in addition to having a human-like perspective, it could also possess ‘godly vision’—looking down at the earth from the sky.

Now, through the Phantom Spirit, Scholar Song sensed that it was in a warm place, with warm energy flowing toward it from all directions, allowing it to recover swiftly.

“Is this… the Heart Aperture?” Scholar Song quickly realized that the Phantom Spirit was located within his first opened aperture, the ‘Heart Aperture,’ and the energy continuously flowing toward the Phantom Spirit was his ‘Qi and Blood Power.’

The Phantom Spirit’s recovery consumed a tremendous amount of energy, and its rank had dropped to a lower tier. Now, it needed a substantial amount of Qi and Blood Power to heal its injuries and regain its rank as a ‘Mid-Tier Phantom Spirit.’

Unfortunately, he had only opened one aperture, limiting the amount of Qi and Blood Power he could provide for the Phantom Spirit’s recovery. If he could open another, he would be able to supply double the energy, greatly accelerating the Phantom Spirit's recovery.

Scholar Song thought to himself.

He had to work harder—before the Phantom Spirit fully recovered, it would continuously consume the Qi and Blood Power from his aperture, which would inherently increase the difficulty of opening his next aperture.

However, sharpening the knife doesn’t hinder the work of cutting firewood; this consumption could be seen as an advance payment for purchasing a Phantom Spirit's enhancement.

As this thought flashed through Scholar Song's mind, he suddenly felt the Phantom Spirit within his Heart Aperture tremble.

Then, the Phantom Spirit’s body dissipated, leaving only the ‘Phantom Spirit Core’ and the minimal energy needed to maintain its existence. The rest of its body transformed into pure energy and flowed into Scholar Song's Heart Aperture.

This pure energy then continuously overflowed from the Heart Aperture, following the pathway between the Heart Aperture and the Eye Aperture, pouring into the Eye Aperture!

What does this mean? Scholar Song quickly realized that the Phantom Spirit wanted to help him break through to the ‘Eye Aperture’ in one go!

In the next moment, Scholar Song experienced the thrilling sensation he had felt before when standing at the coordinates pointed out by the seniors outside Moon Blade Sect—his Qi and Blood Power within the aperture surged dramatically.

This time, the rise in Qi and Blood Power within the Eye Aperture was even faster and more intense!

Venerable White quickly noticed Scholar Song's unusual condition.

He rapidly checked Scholar Song's status and then chuckled softly.

“Indeed, a lucky little friend,” Venerable White murmured to himself. He then took out the tattered bronze ring that had fallen when the ‘Blue Robed Man’ from outside the realm was killed.

For someone of Venerable White’s caliber, this ring, which was only around the third tier, was far too low in grade. Even the most useful ‘Spirit Gathering Formation’ inscribed on it was a mere trinket—Venerable White's own Spirit Gathering Formation drawn in his fridge would likely perform just as well.

Of course, for Scholar Song, who was only at the first tier, the effects of the Spirit Gathering Formation were incredibly valuable!

Venerable White waved his hand over the bronze ring, erasing the mark of its previous owner, ‘Li Tiansu.’ Then, he squatted beside Scholar Song and slipped the bronze ring onto his finger.

With a chuckle, Venerable White said, “This will just about cover the cost of the computer and phone you bought for me.”

The ring that Venerable White gifted was like the finishing touch for Scholar Song at this moment!

As soon as the ring was on Scholar Song's finger, it activated on its own. Instantly, the spiritual energy around him thickened. He could inhale a substantial amount of pure spiritual energy with every breath.

Within the Eye Aperture, the Qi and Blood Power surged continuously!

Finally, just like with the Heart Aperture, everything fell into place, and the Eye Aperture burst open!

Scholar Song opened his eyes, and a bright light emanated from them. Black tears streamed down his cheeks—those were the impurities that had been blocking the Eye Aperture, now expelled from his body.

The Second Aperture, the Eye Aperture—opened!

After a month of cultivation, successfully opening two apertures at the first tier was quite rare even among disciples of prestigious sects. Although the way Scholar Song achieved it was somewhat opportunistic, for cultivators—luck is a form of strength!

Luck is an enigmatic concept, but every cultivator knows not to underestimate it. With enough luck, even mediocre individuals can become unparalleled experts!

Cultivators are inherently reliant on luck in their profession!

Scholar Song wiped away the black tears from the corners of his eyes and gently blinked.

At that moment, the entire world felt as though it had transformed from ‘standard definition’ to ‘high definition’—the sensation was absolutely fantastic!

Meanwhile, in Jiangnan Prison.

Zhao Buluy was leaning against his bed.

A foreign monk sat in front of him, a serious expression on his face, reciting, “Until the end of your life, do not kill. Can you hold to this?”

Zhao Buluy's eyes were filled with tears. “I can hold.”

The foreign monk continued, “Until the end of your life, do not steal. Can you hold to this?”

Zhao Buluy's voice trembled. “I can hold.”

“Until the end of your life, do not lie. Can you hold to this?” the foreign monk asked for the third time.

Zhao Buluy replied, trembling, “I can hold.”

The foreign monk nodded in satisfaction. He extended his hand, fingers forming a blade, and gently scraped over Zhao Buluy's head.

Zhao Buluy's black hair began to fall in clumps.

The foreign monk then asked, “Until the end of your life, do not drink alcohol. Can you hold to this?”

Zhao Buluy replied absentmindedly, “I can hold.”

The foreign monk, pleased with himself, shaved Zhao Buluy's head to a shiny baldness. For the final question, he asked, “Until the end of your life, do not engage in sexual conduct. Can you hold to this?”

Zhao Buluy's eyes were hollow, his face devoid of hope. “I can hold.”

“Good, good!” The foreign monk took out some special incense he had prepared earlier and poked Zhao Buluy's head six times, branding six neat scars.

The foreign monk blew on Zhao Buluy's head, admiring his handiwork. “I’m so good to you, giving you six scars all at once. Unlike your master, who only gave me four and made me add two more myself.”

A flicker of emotion finally appeared in Zhao Buluy's lifeless eyes—a deep, unshakeable sorrow. He would have preferred if the monk had been as stingy as his master, or better yet, not given him a single scar at all!
