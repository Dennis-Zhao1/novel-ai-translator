The old man had finally turned the tide, ha ha!

"With just one of him, he can't fight off four hands," the white-collar man wiped his face, revealing a mouthful of blood.

The T-shirt man slipped out two handle-less sharp blades from his hands, his gaze icy. "Kill him! I can erase the traces, and then we’ll leave the subway as fast as we can!"

The white-collar man nodded, roaring in anger as his muscle-bound body charged toward the foreign monk again.

The T-shirt man moved like a ghost, hovering just behind the white-collar man. However, compared to the white-collar man, he was even more dangerous. The blades in his hands were like the fangs of a venomous snake; once exposed, they could claim a life!

"Come on!" the foreign monk laughed heartily.

...

...

Two minutes later.

The white-collar man lay twisted on the ground, his limbs contorted in unnatural angles, blood splattered across his face, his eyes vacant and dazed.

The T-shirt man was pinned against the wall by the foreign monk, taking hard punches to the face. He too was bloodied and staring blankly.

"How can you two little sprouts, who haven’t even completed your foundation, think you can confront me directly?!" the foreign monk exclaimed, tossing the T-shirt man to the ground and casually snatching the bone artifact from his possession.

He had reached the realm of the First Grade Sixth Aperture, known as "Leaping Over the Dragon Gate," which symbolized the fish leaping over the dragon gate. Once crossed, it could transform the internal energy and blood into tangible true energy, allowing one to transcend the mortal realm! This big monk was already a peak master of the First Grade.

The foreign monk held the bone artifact tightly, gazing at the ghostly general, Ku You.

"This vengeful ghost is at least worth hundreds or thousands of ordinary ghosts. Once purified, I’ll be closer to the vision of the fish leaping over the dragon gate. Heh heh, once I leap over, I can take another step forward," he muttered, crushing the bone artifact with force.

The artifact was linked to the ghost general, and as it shattered, Ku You let out a chilling scream: "Screech... Screech..."

Seizing the opportunity, the foreign monk grabbed the scriptures and prayer beads.

The scriptures fluttered without wind, flipping to the appropriate page.

The foreign monk began to chant loudly, swinging the prayer beads with all his might.

The beads scattered like golden bullets, shooting toward Ku You.

The speed was incredible, and Ku You had no time to dodge, getting struck repeatedly by the golden beads, creating several hollow points in his body as his ghostly aura waned. The cries were relentless!

Yet, the foreign monk frowned, clearly dissatisfied with the results. He then threw the scriptures out as well; like the beads, they disintegrated mid-air into sacred pages, enveloping the ghost general.

Ku You's screams intensified.

The foreign monk executed the Breaking Evil and Subduing Demon Seal, golden light flashing in his eyes as he chanted sacred sounds.

"Dammit, stop... Stop!" the white-collar man crawled toward the foreign monk, struggling to shout as he dragged a bloody trail along the floor.

If this ghost general was purified, he and the T-shirt man would undoubtedly perish!

The T-shirt man also regained his senses, crawling like a worm toward the foreign monk, desperately pleading, "Stop! Don’t purify it... Don't! We’ll die! Stop!"

Such was the sorrow of the little people... they were powerless in life and death.

The foreign monk’s gaze darkened, yet he did not cease his chanting. There must be something contemptible in those pitiful souls!

He had seen many evil ghost cultivators before. He had experienced this kind of situation too many times. He wouldn't stop purifying this ghost general for the sake of these two men! Even if it meant their deaths.

"All vengeful ghosts must be purified. Every last one of them must be purified, not a single one spared!" The foreign monk's eyes were filled with unwavering resolve.

At this moment, the foreign monk failed to notice a hunched figure silently approaching him.

In the heightened state of the foreign monk’s spiritual energy, he was unable to sense the presence of the other.

As the figure drew near, it raised a seemingly ordinary hand and struck at the foreign monk’s back.

Bang!

With a single strike, a surge of true energy erupted from the palm, solidifying and pressing against the foreign monk’s back.

The sound of bones cracking echoed painfully, as if someone had been run over by a heavy truck, leaving a handprint indented into the monk’s back.

Caught completely off guard, the foreign monk coughed up blood, the golden light in his eyes flickering out, his chant abruptly halting!

The prayer beads and sacred pages that had enveloped the ghost general lost their support, falling to the ground like mere objects. The scattered beads clinked as they hit the floor...

Then, the foreign monk crashed to the ground, his eyes wide with disbelief as he looked towards the figure behind him.

True energy! A Second Grade True Master!

Why had this expert only acted now? They could have crushed him from the very start!

“Cough, cough.” The figure coughed a couple of times, his face pale.

He shot a cold glance at the monk before turning his attention to the downed white-collar and T-shirt men. "You two worthless fools... If it weren’t for my plan having changed suddenly, and fortuitously arriving at this Line 5 subway, I would have lost a precious ghost general."

The two men immediately turned pale, trembling all over: "M-Master..."

Why was the Master here?

The hunched figure was indeed the Master that Scholar Song had intended to find at the ‘Yuanlong Pharmacy.’ Now, the Master appeared ghostly pale, clearly still afflicted by an unresolved toxin.

“Master, please spare us! We... We tried our best this time! But that foreign monk is just too strong!” The T-shirt man pleaded desperately—this failure wasn’t due to their weakness but the enemy's overwhelming strength! And now that Ku You hadn’t been purified, perhaps the Master would spare them?

"Spare you?" The Master’s expression darkened. "Useless trash has no value remaining in this world. But... you still have some use."

The white-collar man and the T-shirt man exchanged glances, their eyes lighting up with hope.

But the next moment, they felt a sudden throbbing pain in their heads, and before they could react, they lost consciousness.

"Ku You... devour them," the Master said, wiping the blood from his hands coldly.

The ghost general Ku You pounced greedily towards the two men's bodies, snatching their souls. Without giving them a chance to react, he swallowed them whole.

With the souls of the two men to supplement him, Ku You’s injuries healed significantly.

"Good thing the plan changed, or else I would have suffered heavy losses in this trip to Jiangnan, like a fool!" the Master murmured to himself.

Originally, he only wanted to exchange for the Phantom Spirit from that 'Senior Song,' but due to some inexplicable 'intel,' he had fallen into greed.

As a result, he lost a precious subordinate and was inexplicably poisoned himself.

Having barely escaped to Guangyuan Road, he had been nursing his wounds in silence. He then fortuitously found a pharmacy nearby, hoping to procure an antidote.

But today, by chance, he discovered someone online asking which pharmacies in Jiangnan were selling four types of detoxifying herbs. Suddenly, he felt a chill run down his spine.

He realized the four detoxifying items were traps laid out by 'Senior Song' to expose him as the mastermind behind it all!

No wonder his poisoned subordinate had somehow managed to escape back to his hotel; it was all a trap.

Realizing this, the Master wasted no time packing his bags to flee.

It seemed luck was on his side, as he caught onto the online traces just in time!

As an evil ghost cultivator, he had survived this long through caution; even if there was only a one-in-a-thousand chance, he would undoubtedly flee.

It was pure coincidence that he ended up on this Line 5 subway.

Another coincidence that he found his two useless subordinates and a precious ghost general being hunted and purified by a foreign monk.

What luck! If he had caught an earlier or later subway, he would have missed this train and lost a valuable ghost general!

"It seems that after all these misfortunes, the old man will finally turn his luck around," the Master thought to himself.
