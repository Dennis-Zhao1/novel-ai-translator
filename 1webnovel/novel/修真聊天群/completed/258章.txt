**The Plans of the Young Monk and Fay Yu**

Scholar Song scrolled through the chat records, a slight smile spreading across his face.

Earlier that afternoon, when the seniors in the group were responding to his question about the ‘Three Hundred-Year Scallion Demon’, the conversation had meandered its way to the topic of the ‘Gourmet Banquet’ hosted by the renowned Immortal Snow Fairy. 

Many of the experienced seniors were speculating about what delectable dishes would be served at this upcoming banquet. 

As they reminisced about the mouth-watering delicacies from previous banquets, the chat filled with bizarre and whimsical dish names that sounded absolutely delicious. Scholar Song rubbed his stomach, still feeling the lingering effects of the ‘Empty Hands’ cleanse from Daoist Cloud Mist. Just reading through the list of dishes made his mouth water.

Scrolling down, he noticed a message from Fay Yu, the charming girl from Spirit Butterfly Island.

Fay Yu: “@Scholar Song, what’s your current mailing address? I’ve successfully made the ‘Spirit Vein Green Tea’ by hand and would love to send you a portion!”

At that moment, Scholar Song had been lost in a horrific nightmare, so he hadn’t had the chance to reply.

Seeing Fay Yu’s message now brought a smile to his face. He opened up a private chat with her and quickly typed back: “Thank you, Fay Yu! I’m really looking forward to the Spirit Vein Green Tea you made!”

He attached his home address and then stretched his arms, feeling quite hungry as he prepared to head to the kitchen for a late-night snack.

On Spirit Butterfly Island, a strikingly handsome middle-aged man furrowed his brows as he opened a message on his phone. 

After reading it, he grinned, revealing a set of perfect teeth. “Someone, replace the batch of Spirit Vein Green Tea made by Fay Yu with the ordinary kind—quietly, of course.”

Thank goodness I saw this message. If not, that kid would be stuck on the toilet for the next month!

In the middle of the night, Mother Song suddenly woke up, rubbing her eyes as she made her way to the kitchen.

Habitually, she reached for the chopping board—but as she pulled it, the once sturdy board cracked into several pieces. Not just the board, but there were also deep knife marks on the marble countertop beneath.

“What in the world?” Mother Song jolted awake, her mind racing.

She began to recall the events of the morning... it must have been when she was preparing the stir-fried lamb with scallions. There was one scallion that simply wouldn’t cut no matter how she tried. Then she remembered going to retrieve Scholar Song’s ornate knife to chop the lamb instead.

As the memory settled in, Mother Song felt a chill run down her spine. “Am I going mad?”

Forget about the scallion that wouldn’t cut—why on earth did I think to grab that three-foot-long knife to chop it?

And what was up with that scallion? Why couldn’t I cut it?

Normally, if she encountered an unyielding scallion, her first thought would be to toss it or call someone over to check it out. But at that moment, she had been fixated, only thinking about how to get that scallion cut!

Mother Song recalled that she felt influenced by something, as if she had lost her mind, her thoughts clouded.

“That scallion... it was brought back by Song, said it was a new variety.” Mother Song pieced together the memories.

Then she recalled how Scholar Song had devoured an entire plate of stir-fried lamb with scallions all by himself.

There couldn’t be anything wrong with that scallion, right?

And right after he finished the dish, he had headed straight to his room.

Later, Zhao Yaya had found him asleep on the floor of his room and had called Father Song to help carry him to bed. At the time, everyone assumed he was just exhausted from the journey.

But now, putting two and two together, the more she thought about it, the more suspicious it became.

“That kid, Scholar Song.” Mother Song frowned, striding toward his room.

Just then, a hungry Scholar Song emerged from his room, rubbing his stomach, and ran right into his mother.

“Mom? Why are you still awake at this hour?” he asked, puzzled.

“I was just about to check on you,” she replied.

“Check on me? Haha, I just suddenly felt really hungry while I was sleeping and wanted to grab a snack,” Scholar Song chuckled.

“There’s still some rice left. Let me fry you an egg fried rice,” Mother Song said.

Together, they returned to the kitchen, and she began preparing the dish for him.

As she cooked, she asked, “Scholar Song, be honest with me—was there something wrong with that scallion you brought back?”

Scholar Song glanced at his mother’s expression and decided to answer straightforwardly. “There is a bit of an issue, but it’s hard to explain. To put it simply, people with weak bodies shouldn’t eat that scallion; otherwise, it can have effects on their health.”

“But don’t worry, Mom. My body is completely fine. That scallion was brought back with intention; I know what I’m doing,” he said with a bright smile.

As for the truth about cultivating... now wasn’t the time to reveal it to his parents. He still wasn’t strong enough and needed to wait until he had accumulated more resources before gradually coming clean.

“If you say so, I can rest a little easier,” Mother Song sighed. “If you have time tomorrow, go with your dad and let Yaya take you to the hospital for a full check-up.”

Since Father Song and the others had just been in an accident, Mother Song was worried and wanted Zhao Yaya to take him in for a check-up, just in case there were any lingering issues.

“Is that really necessary? I just went for a full check-up with Yaya a while ago,” Scholar Song replied without thinking.

“You went for a full check-up recently?” Mother Song asked, her brow furrowing in confusion.

“Ahem, it was during the last sports meet. Yaya was interning at our school, so she took me along for a check-up. I’m perfectly healthy, really!” Scholar Song boasted, patting his chest.

At the hotel near the Sixth Hospital, the young monk secretly rubbed his bottom, still feeling the effects of his hemorrhoid treatment, which still had one more session to go.

Once that’s done, he’ll be heading back to Scholar Song’s house.

In his mind, the words from the video that Doudou played kept echoing.

Scholar Song shouted in fury, “No matter whether you have hemorrhoids or not, I’m going to beat the crap out of you!”

Beat the crap out of you! Beat the crap out of you!

Those words kept repeating in the young monk’s mind.

His face grew serious; he was a very earnest child. “If tomorrow’s treatment ends and I go home, Scholar Song is definitely going to beat the crap out of me, right?”

Just thinking about it was terrifying.

He glanced over at Doudou, who was sleeping nearby, and then at Zhou Li, who was meditating with his eyes closed.

Maybe he should try discussing with Doudou tomorrow to postpone going home. The two of them could escape for a while until Scholar Song calmed down before returning?

Back on Spirit Butterfly Island, Fay Yu looked at the enormous wooden box before her with satisfaction. “Perfect! Now all that’s left is to ship the box out!”
