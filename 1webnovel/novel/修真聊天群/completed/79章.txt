**"Second Place... It's Yours!"**

As Scholar Song and the dark-skinned classmate sprinted ahead at full speed, they quickly pulled away from the other competitors, creating a significant gap that had them leading the race by nearly an entire lap!

“Is this for real? When did Scholar Song get so fast? And how can he keep this up?” Lin Tubo was the first to express disbelief, his eyes wide in shock.

“This is... the power of love!” someone named Gao adjusted his glasses, the cold lenses reflecting the bright sunlight.

Li Yangde instinctively glanced over at Lu Fei, who was nearby.

Suddenly, a girl with shoulder-length hair beside Lu Fei’s exclaimed, “Hey Fei, isn’t that Scholar Song, the guy who showed off his muscles on the track last time?”

“Ha ha, that must be him…” Lu Fei felt a faint twinge of anxiety rising within her—summer was still long, and if she didn’t act soon, more people might notice Scholar Song’s strengths, and he could be snatched away!

“If that’s the guy from the track, then this speed can’t be his top speed, right?” the shoulder-length hair girl murmured.

She remembered how that guy had run around the track, completing who knows how many laps, all at a sprinting pace.

…

…

The dark-skinned classmate felt his worldview shattering. After all this time sprinting, this pretty boy wasn’t even breaking a sweat; he looked as if he was handling it with ease!

Impossible! This guy must be pushing himself to the limit.

Running at this pace was exhausting. He felt like he couldn’t keep it up much longer; surely, this pretty boy would collapse after a while—there was no way it could be any different.

Gritting his teeth, the dark-skinned classmate slightly slowed his pace. After all, even he couldn’t maintain a sprint for five thousand meters.

“Hey, you seem to be slowing down a bit. At this rate, you won’t be able to leave me in the dust,” came Scholar Song’s calm voice from behind.

“Huff, huff... What do you mean?” the dark-skinned classmate gasped, breathing heavily.

“If you’re going to slow down, I’ll just pass you,” Scholar Song kindly pointed out, slightly increasing his speed to maintain a half-meter distance between them.

“Huff, huff, I was just adjusting my breathing! Just wait, I’ll show you my true strength! You’ll see, I’ll leave you two streets behind!” the dark-skinned classmate retorted angrily, gritting his teeth as he began running hard again.

He could manage to sprint for another three laps or so, then slow down to rest. Even if he got overtaken during his rest, he could recharge and sprint back to the lead during the final three laps.

Right now, the most important thing was to leave that pretty boy behind during these three laps and show him the difference between a long-distance runner and just some pretty face!

“Roar!” the dark-skinned classmate resumed his furious sprint, saliva flying.

He and Scholar Song fell back into a one-meter gap.

Scholar Song, with a smile of satisfaction, trailed closely behind the dark-skinned classmate, matching his speed and maintaining exactly one meter of distance—no more, no less.

…

…

“Hey, why are those two going all out from the start? If they keep this up, they won’t last the five thousand meters!” one of Scholar Song’s classmates wondered aloud.

“Plus, that dark guy running looks pretty disgusting.”

The dark-skinned classmate ran like a mad deer, droplets of spittle flying everywhere, making it seem like he was frothing at the mouth.

Soon enough, they completed three laps.

The dark-skinned classmate felt his stamina nearing its limit, but when he turned his head, he saw that the pretty boy was still right behind him, not falling behind at all.

“How is this possible?! Huff, huff—why are you still keeping up with me?” the dark-skinned classmate panicked, “With you being just a pretty boy, huff, huff—why haven’t you collapsed yet? You should fall down already!”

Why was this guy such a good runner? And why did he have so much stamina?!

“Classmate, we’ve only run a little over three laps, and there are still nine more to go! Why are you slowing down?” Scholar Song’s voice chimed in again.

“Stop joking! You should be exhausted by now. Huff, huff—don’t push yourself too hard, just fall down already!” the dark-skinned classmate shouted.

“I’m not going to collapse. I feel like I can keep running for a long, long time,” Scholar Song said with a warm smile, “Besides, you should still have energy left. Do you need me to help you?”

“What do you mean? Huff, huff—you jerk!” the dark-skinned classmate roared, feeling insulted.

Scholar Song took a deep breath, channeling his mental energy to bear down on the dark-skinned classmate. This was a technique of mental intimidation. However, Scholar Song controlled the intensity so that the dark-skinned classmate would feel fear but wouldn’t break down like that one female teacher had.

At this moment, the dark-skinned classmate felt as if a fierce beast was chasing him from behind, ready to pounce.

“Aaaah!” he yelled, sprinting with all his might.

So terrifying, so terrifying!

“Looks like you can keep going, and even at a good pace. People are always lazy; it’s not physical fatigue that makes them stop, but their own perception of ‘limits,’ thinking they can only sprint this far, so they slow down. In fact, they can still run fast,” Scholar Song said as he kept pace behind the dark-skinned classmate, offering a ‘professional’ assessment.

Another good deed done, right? How delightful!

“Come on, you’re the guy who’s going to leave me in the dust!” Scholar Song cheered from behind.

“Aaaah!” the dark-skinned classmate screamed, his face smeared with tears, sweat, snot, and saliva, making him look utterly miserable.

Meanwhile, Scholar Song remained just one meter behind him.

One lap, then another. Another lap, another!

Fear can push people to their physical limits; the dark-skinned classmate was now tapping into all his potential. Five thousand meters didn’t seem so far when driven by the power of fear.

Everyone stared, slack-jawed, at the dark-skinned classmate, who was running like a wild beast.

If he kept this up, would he break the world record?

He ran on, seemingly tireless, though his legs felt numb and senseless. His stomach churned violently, and he felt like throwing up.

This was the fastest he had ever run in his life. It was also the most exhausting and painful experience he’d ever endured.

But the effort was finally paying off—only half a lap remained.

He was the victor; he was faster than that pretty boy behind him! Even if it was just by a meter!

The dark-skinned classmate was on the verge of foaming at the mouth.

The finish line was just a few steps away. They had lapped the third-place competitor by a full three laps—a shocking statistic.

“I’m the true winner!” the dark-skinned classmate gathered his remaining strength, charging toward the finish like a hungry wolf.

Just a few dozen meters left—this was the distance for a final sprint!

Victory was practically within reach.

Just then, as he was about to cross the finish line, a figure like a howling wind zipped past him with a whoosh.

So fierce and swift!

The speed was so immense that he couldn’t even see who it was.

It wasn’t until the figure reached the finish line and raised both hands in triumph that he realized who it was.

In that moment, the dark-skinned classmate felt a sharp pain in his heart.

It was that pretty boy!

At the last moment, the other had surged ahead, surpassing him with composure and crossing the finish line first.

“This first place was going to be yours anyway, but since my friend wanted to win, I’m sorry—I can’t let you have it,” Scholar Song said, turning back with a bright smile at the finish line, giving him a thumbs up. “But you’re a great opponent. Keep it up; second place is yours!”

Second place, second place… it’s yours, it’s yours!

At that moment, the dark-skinned classmate felt a crushing disappointment.

“Ugh!” His stomach finally revolted, unable to hold back any longer. Losing the belief of winning, his left leg buckled, and he tripped, falling to the ground as he was propelled forward, dragging his body across the ground for quite a distance…

At this moment, the dark-skinned classmate was only—three to five steps away from the finish line!

But that distance felt like a vast chasm, an insurmountable gulf.

Scholar Song scratched the back of his head, lamenting, “What a shame—it’s just like migrating birds; they don’t fall during the long journey but collapse right before the finish line. You were a great opponent.”

The dark-skinned classmate finally felt darkness take over, losing consciousness.
