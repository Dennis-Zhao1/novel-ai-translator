**Scholar Song, why not learn to drive?**

As the day came to a close, it was already nearing noon.

After bidding farewell to the little loli and her family, and politely declining her invitation to visit their home, Scholar Song boarded the subway back to Jiangnan University Town.

Neither party exchanged contact information; after all, they were merely passing acquaintances. If fate allowed, they might meet again, but if not, there was no need to linger on it.

In truth, the man in the white shirt had wanted to ask for Scholar Song’s contact details, but he hesitated, unsure how to approach the subject…

The subway ride home was surprisingly sparse in passengers, and Scholar Song was fortunate enough to snag a seat. He placed a large shopping bag beside him—a bag containing the black briefcase he had received from the forum’s host.

As soon as he stepped off the subway at the accident site, he had quickly wrapped the black briefcase in the shopping bag. After all, it had quite the dubious origin, and it was better to keep it hidden.

With the subway slowly pulling away, Scholar Song felt his tense heart finally start to calm down.

Leaning back against the subway seat, he replayed the scene of his confrontation with the forum’s host in his mind, going over it again and again, using it to fully pacify his emotions.

After taking a deep breath, Scholar Song opened his phone and logged into the Ninefold Land No. 1 group.

There were no new messages in the group chat for now.

The last conversation he saw was from last night when he had discussed the “Claw Marks Beast’s Leader” with North River Hermit and Fay Yu.

After a moment’s thought, Scholar Song typed in the group: “@Seven Lives Talisman’s Master, senior, I have successfully located the mastermind behind the Claw Marks Beast's leader, the forum host. The enemy has been dealt with, and it cost me two ‘Evil-Breaking Talismans’ and three ‘Sword Talismans’. I don’t plan on pursuing the remaining scattered members for now.”

“Also, senior, should I send the remaining talismans back to you?”

Just as he finished typing, a reply came through the Ninefold Land No. 1 group.

Seven Lives Talisman’s Master: “Scholar Song, you’re as swift as a rabbit, and your efficiency is commendable. Well done!”

“Also, there’s no need to send the talismans back to me. Consider them a small gift from me to you. Besides… even if you wanted to send them back now, I wouldn’t be able to receive them.”

“I’m currently on a small island in the Pacific, teaching a bunch of primitive people how to read. What was I thinking when I swore to ‘teach without discrimination, guiding ten thousand people to literacy’? How much does one have to suffer to make such a ridiculous vow! And nowadays, with compulsory education, it’s hard to find anyone who can’t read. I finally found a deserted island with nearly ten thousand primitive people, all illiterate.”

“If I can teach them to read, I’ll fulfill that old vow. But this will take a few months at least, or a few years maybe? What a ridiculous promise! If I ever get the chance to become a legendary figure and reverse time, I’ll definitely go back and slap my younger self a dozen times for making such a foolish vow!”

Scholar Song only asked a simple question, yet Seven Lives Talisman’s Master had gone on and on, and from his tone, it was clear how much resentment he held for his younger self.

It seemed that everyone had a past they preferred not to revisit.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but sigh.

Also, Seven Lives Talisman’s Master was quite busy; just yesterday he was in the Huaxi region, and now he was off to some island in the Pacific?

“Well, thank you, senior. Your talismans are indeed simple yet effective, with great power!” Scholar Song flattered him a bit, hoping that his compliment would lighten the senior’s mood.

“Of course! When it comes to talismans, I’m the best in the group! But I won’t say much more; I need to get back to teaching these primitives. They’re so slow! I teach them a word, and they might forget it the moment they turn around. It makes me want to smack them around… Hey, that’s actually a great idea! Let’s capture the ones who forget their words and give them a good beating. Let’s see which little rascal dares to forget again!” Seven Lives Talisman’s Master seemed to easily be sidetracked into discussing his plans for the primitive people.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but touch his chest, feeling a twinge of guilt. He envisioned a group of primitive people in animal skin skirts, sitting on stones, pitifully reciting: “The hoe and the sun at noon, sweat drops into the soil below, who knows the meal on the plate, every grain is hard-earned…”

Suddenly, one of the primitives forgot the words, and so Seven Lives Talisman’s Master would hang him from a tree and whip him mercilessly.

“Surely, this isn’t my fault. I didn’t lead the senior to beat the forgetful primitive!” Scholar Song murmured to himself.

Ding ding ding.

A new message came through in the Ninefold Land No. 1 group.

Sure enough, it was North River Hermit, who leisurely chimed in: “Scholar Song, you always manage to surprise me. I heard that the enemy leader you killed was a second-grade cultivator?”

“It’s not as exaggerated as it sounds. The opponent was indeed a second-grade cultivator, but first, he was poisoned by the Alchemical Sage, and then, due to a misunderstanding by Fay Yu, combined with the support of Seven Lives Talisman’s Master’s talismans, I finally had the chance to take him down,” Scholar Song briefly explained the series of events.

“Bold and meticulous. Your success in taking down the enemy leader isn’t just luck. Keep this up, and I believe you can go further on your cultivation path,” North River Hermit encouraged.

Wild Blade of Three Tides came online: “Scholar Song, well done! You’ve got more flair than I did at your age!”

“Three Tides, didn’t you say you were going into seclusion to break through your realm?” North River Hermit teased with a sly grin.

“Yeah, I am. But even when in seclusion, one must balance work and rest. You can’t just lock yourself away!” Wild Blade of Three Tides replied.

“Quit the nonsense,” North River Hermit laughed in mock reproach.

At that moment, Drunken Moon Scholar jumped in with a comment: “Three Tides, you seem unusually serious today. With no seniors around, why aren’t you cracking any risqué jokes? This isn’t like you.”

“Don’t mention it. There’s been a surge of mythical beasts online recently, and I can’t risk telling risqué jokes. The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain even said I’d be kicked out of the group if I did! I’ve been holding back!” Wild Blade of Three Tides chuckled.

“Ha ha,” Drunken Moon Scholar sent a shy smile before quietly going back to lurking.

Scholar Song scratched his head—speaking of which, Drunken Moon Scholar’s ID felt oddly familiar, but he could never quite remember him.

Just then, North River Hermit suddenly asked, “By the way, Scholar Song, aren’t you planning to learn to drive soon?”

“Yeah, that’s right. I’ve been studying the theory for driving recently and plan to take the driving test soon. How did you know I was learning to drive?” Scholar Song asked, puzzled.

“Hehe, I happened to sneak a peek at your game farm while I was ‘borrowing’ some vegetables. I also checked your personal space. You had noted your intention to learn driving in your memo,” North River Hermit said smugly. “Also, if you have time, upgrade the land in your vegetable garden. Why hoard so many coins? Upgrading will speed up your planting, and I can steal more from you!”

Stealing vegetables?!!

Scholar Song thought to himself, “How idle can you be, senior? You actually play a vegetable-stealing game? And you’re bored enough to go through my personal space?”

What a blow to his image! Ever since he met these seniors, the lofty image he had of cultivators had shattered completely. If only he could keep a small part of that grandeur for nostalgia!

But that was a tangent… Why was the senior asking if he wanted to learn to drive?

Scholar Song tentatively asked, “Could it be that North River Senior wants to learn to drive too?”

“What do I need that for? Flying on a sword is way faster than driving a car. No traffic jams to worry about… Just need to be careful not to crash into an airplane!” North River Hermit chuckled. “But… let me drop a hint for you. If you have time, try to learn your driving license as soon as possible. I guarantee you’ll gain a lot of benefits!”

Scholar Song’s eyes suddenly lit up—could it be that one of the seniors in the group wanted to learn to drive for fun? If he got his license first, he could come back and teach that senior how to drive!

And the benefits were clear—according to the group’s custom, putting in effort would yield rewards!

“You guessed it, didn’t you? By the time you finish, if you want a Blood Qi Dan, that won’t be a problem at all! Not just pills, but even advanced cultivation techniques will be available! The Alchemical Sage only gave you basic foundation techniques, which will only take you to the peak of first-grade at most. So I highly recommend this opportunity; you’ll get some excellent follow-up techniques!” North River Hermit added a toothy grin emoji: “Excited, right?”

Scholar Song was definitely excited!
