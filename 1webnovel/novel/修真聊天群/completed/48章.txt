**The Art of Law Not to be Lightly Shared**

“USB drive…” Scholar Song felt much like the people in his group when they found out he was using an electric stove and hot pot to refine pills.

The Alchemical Sage took the USB drive, then tossed a black flying sword toward Scholar Song. “Here, catch the flying sword first. Tomorrow, I’ll give you the address of Master Tongxuan. You need to send this flying sword back to him in a few days.”

Scholar Song exclaimed, “...Send it back?”

“Of course! What, do you expect me to deliver it myself?” the Alchemical Sage retorted.

Scholar Song protested, “No, I mean—aren’t flying swords supposed to just *whoosh* back on their own?”

“Haha, how could they? They can’t fly back by themselves! When the sword flew over, it required energy! Master Tongxuan could provide that energy when it flew here. But for it to return, he’s thousands of miles away and can’t transmit power over such a distance. Plus… this flying sword is Master Tongxuan’s exclusive weapon; no one else can use it without his permission. So I can’t infuse it with energy either,” the Alchemical Sage explained.

“Why is it that at this moment, the law of conservation of energy suddenly matters?” Scholar Song felt a bit stifled: “Also, this black flying sword is already a sharpened blade, right? Sharpened weapons can’t be sent via courier, can they? And even if they could, wouldn’t it be a hassle if such a precious item got lost in transit?”

The Alchemical Sage smiled smugly. “Don’t worry; I’ve sent flying swords dozens of times without any issues. Master Tongxuan’s flying sword has a hidden formation attached to it, so unless the Master agrees, no one else can see it. Right now, only the Master, you with the Master’s approval, and I can see and sense this sword. To everyone else, it’s invisible. Plus, the sword is incredibly light; you can easily conceal it in a large package. And if it gets lost, there’s no need to worry—there’s a master’s imprint on the sword, so if it goes missing, it can always be tracked down. In short, you can rest easy.”

“Even so, I still feel it’s strange to mail back a flying sword,” Scholar Song said, holding the sword in his hand, feeling a bit uneasy.

“Don’t overthink it. Anyway, the seal on the USB drive has been broken. Next up, the ‘Foundational Vajra Fist Technique’ and the ‘True Self Meditation Scripture.’” The Alchemical Sage tossed the jade-like USB drive to Scholar Song.

To be cautious, Master Tongxuan had placed a seal on the USB drive, which could only be broken using the correct method. If forced, both the USB drive and the seal would be destroyed.

Upon receiving it, Scholar Song indeed saw the USB port, and it was just a USB drive!

“Ah, before you start learning the techniques, I must remind you of something. Unlike pills and magical artifacts, the law is not lightly shared!” the Alchemical Sage warned.

Since Scholar Song was a novice with no knowledge of cultivators, there were some taboos the Alchemical Sage had to clarify beforehand.

“If you receive techniques from someone else or a sect, you must not casually share them with others without permission! This is a taboo among cultivators! For example, if you want to pass on these two techniques to someone else, you must first obtain the permission of the technique’s owner, Master Tongxuan, and pay a certain price to him. Moreover, the person you’re passing the techniques to must also adhere to this taboo; they cannot share the techniques without permission either. Just as I need Master Tongxuan’s consent to teach you these two techniques.”

“If someone is found sharing techniques privately, no one in the Ninefold Land group or in the entire cultivation world will ever want to share their techniques with you again,” the Alchemical Sage emphasized.

Techniques are the foundation of a sect or a cultivator. No one wants their techniques to be spread far and wide, so sharing techniques privately is absolutely forbidden.

Of course, if it’s a technique you created yourself, you can share it however you wish—that’s your freedom.

Scholar Song nodded in understanding. The techniques created or obtained by others are private property, and being willing to share them is already a favor. If you then casually pass on someone else's techniques, what does that make you?

Receiving the USB drive, Scholar Song couldn’t help but feel a surge of excitement.

Taking a deep breath, he opened his computer, then disconnected from the internet and performed a thorough antivirus scan.

He didn’t have much on his computer, so the scan took just over a minute.

After that, he carefully inserted the USB drive into the computer.

The Alchemical Sage stood quietly behind Scholar Song, nodding in satisfaction. Even though he was excited, Scholar Song remained composed. Maintaining this demeanor would be beneficial for his future path as a cultivator.

Scholar Song clicked on the USB drive, revealing two folders.

- **Foundational Vajra Fist Technique**
- **True Self Meditation Scripture**

He opened the **Foundational Vajra Fist Technique** folder and found a total of eighteen images, each one a photo of a scroll.

He clicked on the first image.

Although the name **Foundational Vajra Fist Technique** sounded a bit ordinary, that was fine as long as it was effective. After all, typical martial arts usually had grand names for each move, like the *Eighteen Palms of the Dragon*—something like *Dragon Soaring in the Field* or *Divine Dragon Wagging Its Tail*, right?

He was both eager and excited.

Then he saw the name of the move.

‘Foundational Fist Technique One’

The font was in traditional Chinese.

That was it.

There was no impressive continuation like *Vajra Subduing Demons* or anything—just a simple title: *Foundational Fist Technique One*.

Scholar Song opened the second image: *Foundational Fist Technique Two*.

Not ready to give up, he opened the third image: *Foundational Fist Technique Three*.

“…” Alright, Scholar Song realized he didn’t need to look further.

It continued with *Foundational Fist Technique Four* through *Foundational Fist Technique Eighteen*.

The Alchemical Sage watched as Scholar Song quickly clicked through the images, puzzled. “What are you doing?”

“I’m looking at the names of the moves,” Scholar Song replied. “I just didn’t expect the names to be so simple?”

“Practicality is what matters; move names serve to mark and differentiate the sequence of techniques,” the Alchemical Sage answered calmly.

That was true; practicality mattered. Scholar Song nodded, but why did he feel a lingering sense of disappointment?

Just imagine—when he eventually faced off against someone on the peak of the Forbidden City.

His opponent would let out a clear shout, soaring into the air, drawing their sword with grace: “Celestial Being Descending from the Heavens!”

Then he’d huff dismissively, charging with a bold strike: “Foundational Fist Technique Three!”

He’d already be losing in terms of momentum.

“Stop dwelling on the move names. They don’t matter. If you really care about it, you can always rename them later,” the Alchemical Sage said nonchalantly. “Now, let me explain the first few levels of a cultivator’s realm and the significance of foundation building.”

Scholar Song quickly sat up straight, focusing intently, ready to listen.

“The path of cultivation involves myriad roads and countless methods, with each sect having its own ways of practice. However, regardless of whether it’s Dao cultivation, Buddhist cultivation, ghost cultivation, or demonic cultivation, the first step into the world of cultivators is mostly the same—refining the body and condensing the internal energy and blood. This step is known as foundation building.”

“The first step of building the foundation is to practice basic fist techniques, leg techniques, sword techniques, etc., to refine the body and bring it into a state of abundant energy and blood. Afterward, the next step is inward practice through meditation, collecting the overflowing energy and blood and condensing it into the heart’s acupoint. Normally, without using pills, if one practices diligently, it takes about a hundred days for the heart’s acupoint to be filled with energy and blood, achieving a natural opening. Once the heart’s acupoint opens, the previously accumulated energy and blood transforms into a thread of energy, marking the foundation building, also known as opening the acupoint.”

“Once the heart’s acupoint opens, it signifies that one has truly entered the ranks of cultivators, surpassing ordinary people, achieving the first rank of transcending the mundane.”
