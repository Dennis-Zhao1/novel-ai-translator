**Foundation Building Techniques**

**Group Ninefold One**

Alchemical Sage: “@Wandering Monk Tongxuan, Master Tongxuan, fourteen years ago during the cave exploration, could you lend me the ‘Vajra Basic Fist Technique’ and the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’? We can discuss the price next time.”

Scholar Song watched as the Alchemical Sage typed out this lengthy message. He felt a pang of sympathy. It was only about fifty characters, including punctuation, yet the Alchemical Sage took five minutes to delete and rewrite, sweat beading on his forehead.

In that moment, Scholar Song finally understood why the Alchemical Sage tried to keep his messages short. But why go through all that trouble when voice messages were an option?

Once the Alchemical Sage sent the message, the Ninefold One group quickly buzzed with activity.

Hermit of North River teased, “Oh? Alchemical Sage is asking for these two foundational techniques. Is it for our young friend Scholar Song’s hundred days of foundation building? These techniques are quite good. Has Alchemical Sage been bewitched by Scholar Song like Fay Yu?”

Fay Yu quickly posted a pouty face emoji: “North River Senior, I have not been bewitched!”

“Bewitched?” Wild Blade of Three Tides was feeling lively since Fay Yu’s father had finally stopped bothering him, having returned to Lingdie Island just yesterday! After being cooped up for days, the phrase “bewitched” brought up a flood of classic jokes in his mind. Awesome, he was ready to drop a few in the chat.

“Don’t dig your own grave, Three Tides.” North River Hermit reminded him again, “You know you can log in to your chat account on both your phone and computer.”

What if right now, ‘Fay Yu’ was being used by her father on his mobile?

Wild Blade of Three Tides’ expression changed in an instant, and he quickly went quiet. Oh no, how could he have forgotten that? With Fay Yu’s father’s prowess, if he discovered Three Tides dared to joke around in front of his daughter, he’d definitely jump from the plane just to continue pestering him.

The Alchemical Sage chuckled, then his fingers flew across his phone. After a while, he managed to type out a few words: “Top-grade mutated poison dragon grass, worth it!”

Wandering Monk Tongxuan came online, first sending a smiling emoji. Then, he shared a picture of a small sword.

“Nice!” Alchemical Sage replied.

The exchange between these two was simply bizarre.

Fay Yu asked, “Seniors, are the ‘Vajra Basic Fist Technique’ and the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’ really that good?”

“This is the technique from the Vajra Temple eight hundred years ago. Although it was designed for disciples to build their foundations, the power of the ‘Vajra Basic Fist Technique’ rivals a first-grade martial skill. Among foundation building techniques, it's quite good,” North River Hermit explained. “It’s a pity the Vajra Temple has now lost its lineage and vanished into the annals of history, taking many profound techniques with it.”

The Alchemical Sage nodded in satisfaction and then turned off his phone.

After that, he went to the balcony of his dormitory and pointed toward the sky.

Scholar Song watched curiously, unsure of what he was trying to do.

Soon, ten minutes passed...

The Alchemical Sage remained motionless in that pose, like a statue.

Just as Scholar Song was about to ask what was going on, the Alchemical Sage's eyes lit up, and he exclaimed softly, his outstretched finger glowing a fiery red.

To be honest, that pose was quite impressive.

But to Scholar Song, it looked like the Alchemical Sage's finger was as red as a piece of iron that had been heated up, reminiscent of a movie character who accidentally smashed their finger with a hammer, causing it to swell and turn bright red.

“Done!” the Alchemical Sage grinned with satisfaction.

“?” Scholar Song looked utterly puzzled.

Seeing the confusion on Scholar Song’s face, the Alchemical Sage explained, “I just set the coordinates with Master Tongxuan. In four to five hours, he will send over the ‘Vajra Basic Fist Technique’ and the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’.”

“Master Tongxuan is coming here?” Scholar Song asked.

“Why would he come? I just set the coordinates with him, and he can send the texts using his flying sword,” the Alchemical Sage said proudly.

“Oh.” Scholar Song nodded, his mind conjuring an image: in a secluded mountain forest, a wise monk smiled quietly, drawing a small sword from his robes and securing a bundle on it containing several martial arts manuals.

As for the manuals, they should ideally be in paper-bound books or even ancient animal skin scrolls.

Then, the monk pointed toward the sky, aligning coordinates with an old friend far away.

Following that, he would tap the short sword, and it would zoom upwards with the package, soaring elegantly and dramatically.

Awesome! Sending texts via flying sword! How much strength would I need to fly a sword? Scholar Song secretly envied.

Sword flight! Compared to that, flying on a plane felt so inferior.

The sky is forever a man’s romance!

“Let’s go. We need to find a place to stay and refine some body tempering liquid! Should we bring your induction cooker and hot pot?” the Alchemical Sage inquired.

Scholar Song hesitated for a while but ultimately pulled out his black suitcase, packing those two items. After all, he was quite accustomed to using the induction cooker and hot pot. Moreover, if the place he rented didn’t have a stove or hot pot, or if they were of a different brand, it might lead to a failure in refining the body tempering liquid.

Then he opened his storage locker to retrieve the materials for the body tempering liquid.

“Scholar Song, you don’t need to bring the materials. Since I’m asking you for help, I’ll cover the costs of the materials,” the Alchemical Sage quickly called out to him. — What a joke! He was a renowned alchemist, how could he ask someone else to pay for the materials while requesting their assistance in experimenting with a formula?

Scholar Song nodded silently, locking the locker. Now wasn’t the time to show off; after all, he only had thirty-two sets of materials, and according to North River Senior, that might not be enough for his hundred days of foundation building. So, saving was a wise choice.

He pulled along his small suitcase, asking as they walked, “So, what are your requirements for renting a place?”

The Alchemical Sage replied, “It should be quiet, and the soundproofing needs to be good. Otherwise, I’ll have to set up a soundproof array, which is quite troublesome.”

Scholar Song glanced at his wallet, calculating his living expenses. His mother gave him three thousand each month. After all, times had changed; back then, twenty years ago, a college student could live comfortably on a thousand RMB a month.

Since he hadn’t found a part-time job yet, he thought about renting a place for a month.

“A small apartment should be around five to six hundred.” Scholar Song murmured.

The Alchemical Sage immediately expressed concern, “Isn’t a five-hundred apartment too small? We need at least an independent, large apartment. Otherwise, my alchemy furnace won’t fit!”

Independent? And large? Was he talking about an apartment or a villa?

Scholar Song replied with a wry smile, “Renting one of those would start at over ten thousand a month. I don’t have that much money.”

“Of course, I’ll pay for it! How can you help someone and also pay for it?” The Alchemical Sage quickly stopped him. As a senior, how could he let a junior spend their money?

“Well then, let’s look properly. There really aren’t many independent large apartments near the school,” Scholar Song thought, feeling a little pained at the thought of renting a place that costs over ten thousand a month. However, he had another question in mind.

“By the way, Senior, do you guys have regular jobs or income sources in the mundane world?” Scholar Song had been pondering this for some time. The people in the group didn’t seem to be isolated from the world; they used computers, phones, and other modern devices and even went online. Surely, they didn’t rely on gold bars for transactions, right?

“Of course, we have our own sources of income. We haven’t isolated ourselves from the world. I’m not too clear about others’ sources, but my main profession as an alchemist covers my daily expenses,” the Alchemical Sage nodded.

At that moment, he glanced at Scholar Song and smiled, asking, “What’s up? From your tone, it sounds like you’re worried about mundane money?”

Scholar Song honestly nodded, “After getting involved in cultivation, I realized I might need a lot of money. At least, I was thinking yesterday about whether I should rent a place outside of campus to keep my identity as a cultivator secret and make alchemy easier. But to rent a place, I need to consider the financial expenses.”

He felt a bit embarrassed to mention his thoughts about getting a part-time job.
