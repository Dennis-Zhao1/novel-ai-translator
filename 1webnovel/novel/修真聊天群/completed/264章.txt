**Bamboo Slip Formation**

In this day and age, if you want to grab everyone's attention on social media, your post title has to be eye-catching, and the poses must be stunning.

This particular post ticked both boxes, and out of curiosity, Lv Tianyou clicked on it. 

What he saw were several images. 

The photos depicted a logistics company transporting sedans, with a total of nine trucks, each loaded with about five luxurious cars of various models. The pictures were clear, showcasing a fleet of high-end vehicles. 

However, the most striking aspect wasn’t the thirty-odd luxury cars. Instead, it was the presence of three trucks that stood out—one carrying a flashy hand-pushed tractor, another a small excavator, and the last a sturdy bulldozer.

These three vehicles jostled for attention amidst the sea of sedans, standing out like sore thumbs.

The post briefly explained that all these luxury cars were purchased in one go by a mysterious individual from the Jiangnan region, which included the hand-pushed tractor, excavator, and bulldozer…

Lv Tianyou paused, suddenly recalling Scholar Song's hand-pushed tractor and the dozens of 'vehicle registration certificates' associated with him during the rollover incident.

“So they've already started hauling in investments, huh?” Lv Tianyou sighed inwardly.

It seemed likely that the hand-pushed tractor, along with the various luxury cars, were experimental models provided by the investors for Scholar Song and his friends to develop technology.

Indeed, knowledge is power, and technology is wealth.

Lv Tianyou quietly turned off his phone, realizing it was best not to let his father know about this. Otherwise, Old Lv might get triggered and retreat into his room to brood alone.

Downstairs from Scholar Song's home, there was a small grove of bamboo that Father Song had brought down from the mountains. Years ago, Father Song had taken an interest in caring for and trimming the ordinary water bamboo daily.

However, as the novelty wore off, he left it to grow wild. Fortunately, these water bamboos were resilient; even without care, they thrived.

“Which one should we choose?” Scholar Song asked, eager to see how Fay Yu would turn these ordinary bamboos into a ‘defensive formation.’

“I’ll take a look,” Fay Yu replied, closing her eyes momentarily before reopening them, her pupils glowing with a diamond-like sheen.

Was this a spell? Or perhaps Fay Yu's ‘eye talent’? Or was it the effect of the ‘contact lenses’ in her eyes?

After observing for a while, Fay Yu pointed to one particularly robust bamboo and said, “Let’s go with this one. It contains the strongest wood energy!”

Scholar Song nodded, raising his treasured blade, the Dominator of Shattering, and lightly struck the chosen bamboo, severing it cleanly.

“What’s next?” Scholar Song inquired.

“Hand me the blade,” Fay Yu instructed.

Scholar Song passed her the Dominator of Shattering—this moon-blade had experienced quite the life since following Scholar Song, chopping scallions and now bamboo, effectively living the life of a kitchen knife.

Fay Yu took the blade and began to wield it with remarkable speed. 

With swift strokes, the blade flashed, and soon the bamboo was stripped of its branches and cut into sections resembling ancient bamboo slips.

Then, Fay Yu’s pupils shifted again, and she selected twenty of the bamboo pieces from the pile.

“Alright, these twenty should be enough for us,” Fay Yu said with satisfaction. “Let’s head back to the room and set up the formation.”

Scholar Song grabbed a broom and swept the leftover bamboo scraps into a corner.

……

……

Once back in the room, Fay Yu produced a brush made from a magical beast’s hair and a special ink mixed with herbs, beginning to inscribe runes on the bamboo strips.

“By the way, should I step outside?” Scholar Song asked.

In the cultivation world, both techniques and spells are highly confidential matters. Learning someone else's techniques is a serious taboo.

“No need, Senior. This defensive formation is just a basic one I’ve modified, nothing advanced. No need for discretion,” Fay Yu replied.

Hearing this, Scholar Song shamelessly stayed by her side to watch her engrave the runes—he wasn’t trying to steal any techniques, just genuinely curious about how defensive formations were created!

As Fay Yu inscribed the runes, Scholar Song noticed that with each stroke, a faint glow emanated from the brush tip. She was channeling her true qi, blending the special ink as she inscribed the runes. Every character she wrote was carved into the bamboo slip, with the special ink merging into the bamboo.

This principle was similar to how he used ‘Palm Thunder,’ drawing on his qi to inscribe ‘thunder symbols’ in his palm. The special ink could carry the power of true qi, merging with the wood attributes of the bamboo to form the defensive formation.

After all, a defensive formation differs from ‘Palm Thunder’; it requires a ‘lasting’ force and needs to ensure that the true qi within the runes doesn’t dissipate too quickly over time.

In total, more than two hundred runes formed a small text, completely filling the twenty bamboo strips, creating a scroll of bamboo slips.

“All done!” Fay Yu said, blowing gently on the slips.

The ink glimmered like fireflies, stunningly beautiful, resembling a true work of art.

“Is it ready?” Scholar Song asked, his curiosity piqued.

“Yes, we just need to activate it. However, Senior, the power on these bamboo slips can only sustain the formation for about two days. Within that time, you need to figure out a way to move Venerable White elsewhere,” Fay Yu replied.

Scholar Song breathed a sigh of relief. “Two days is enough; by then, Venerable White will have finished his closed-door retreat.”

—As long as Venerable White doesn’t suddenly think, “Ah, what a lovely day to meditate, I think I’ll do it for a year,” then everything should be fine!

“Then I’ll activate it now!” Fay Yu declared, raising two fingers to her chest, murmuring an incantation before exclaiming, “Bamboo Slip Formation, activate!”

With her command, the bamboo slips laid out on the table were drawn by an unseen force, floating in front of Fay Yu, arranging themselves upright. Light connected each piece, creating a stunning display.

“Go!” Fay Yu pointed at the unconscious Venerable White lying on the bed.

The bamboo slips spread out, forming a circle that enveloped Venerable White entirely.

“Now, even if Venerable White inadvertently reveals a bit of ‘real illusion,’ it won’t affect those outside the bamboo slip formation,” Fay Yu clapped her hands, satisfied.

Scholar Song finally relaxed, secretly grateful. “Thank you, Fay Yu. You’ve truly been a great help!”

“Giggle, no need to be polite, Senior!” Fay Yu grinned, her eyes narrowing in delight.

Time flew by, and soon it was lunchtime.

Today’s meal was particularly lavish, even more so than when Old Lv had visited yesterday.

“Scholar, hurry and bring Fay Yu out to eat!” Mother Song called out.

Once Scholar Song and Fay Yu sat down at the table, the family gathered around.

“Hmm? Isn’t your friend up yet?” Mother Song frowned slightly, inquiring.

“He’s up, but he’s still a bit dazed and needs some time to wake up. He’ll join us as soon as he’s ready!” Scholar Song replied with a smile.

Mother Song nodded, then turned her attention to Fay Yu… after all, compared to that man, Scholar Bai, Fay Yu was far more worthy of her focus.

As they began to eat, Scholar Song quickly devoured his meal, his speed akin to that of a famished man who hadn’t eaten for days!

In just over thirty seconds, he had finished everything.

“Mom, I’m done eating! I’ll go call my friend!” Scholar Song announced.

“Why did you eat so fast?” Mother Song shot him a glare—eating so quickly meant leaving the poor girl alone at the table. What kind of manners was that?

Fortunately, Fay Yu had chatted with Mother Song for quite a while in the morning, so she wasn’t left feeling awkward.

Scholar Song dashed back to his room.

Moments later, a composed Venerable White emerged from the room.

His long hair flowed down, his handsome features akin to a painting, looking like a celestial being straight out of a picture, albeit with a hint of drowsiness lingering on his face.

“Uncle, Auntie. I’m sorry for waking up late. Thank you for having me over these days,” the man known as ‘Scholar Bai’ said, offering an apologetic smile.

Father Song chuckled heartily. “No worries, it’s no trouble at all. Since you’re Scholar Song’s friend, just treat this place like your own home.”

Mother Song immediately got up and served ‘Scholar Bai’ a bowl of rice. “Don’t be shy, where’s Scholar Song?”

“Thank you, Auntie. Scholar Song just went back to his room for a moment,” Scholar Bai replied with a smile—though his smile carried an odd dryness.

Beside him, Fay Yu buried her head, struggling to contain her laughter.

……

……

Finally finishing the meal.

Zhao Yayao helped Mother Song clear the table, and Scholar Bai and Fay Yu returned to Scholar Song's room.

Once back, Fay Yu leaned over the bed, bursting into laughter.

On the bed, Venerable White was blissfully immersed in his closed-door retreat.

Behind her, ‘Scholar Bai’ removed a brooch from his chest, his illusion dissipating to reveal Scholar Song’s true form.

After laughing for a bit, Fay Yu raised her head, mimicking Scholar Song’s earlier pose and tone as she said, “Thank you, Auntie! Scholar Song just went back to his room for something. Hehehe… Scholar, how does it feel to address your own mother as ‘Auntie’?”

Scholar Song: “…”

At this very moment, across town, in a first-class cabin on a high-speed train.

Gao Something lay back in his seat, wearing a foolish expression as his petite girlfriend, Mei Yi, nestled against him, fast asleep.

“Why are you all here?!” Gao Something gritted his teeth, speaking in a low voice.

Beside him were a pair of mixed-race siblings.

The childhood friends he least wanted to acknowledge—Zhuge Yue.

And the buddy he most wanted to cut ties with—Zhuge Zhongyang.

“Hahaha! Did you really think changing your phone number would allow you to slip away from my grasp? You’re so naive, Gao Something!” Zhuge Yue laughed triumphantly.

Zhuge Zhongyang chimed in, “Come on, Gao Something. I’ve already got plane tickets ready for you and your classmates, heading towards the East Sea!”
