**Scholar Song and the Academic Gorilla**

At this moment, in the skies above the Eastern Sea.

Venerable White frowned slightly: "..."

Before him, Dou Dou and the little monk were unconscious, suspended in the air by his spiritual power. However, the flying swords carrying Dou Dou and the little monk were nowhere to be found.

Scholar Song had called Venerable White before boarding the plane, informing him that he was on the flight and would contact him again upon arriving at the vacation island. Naturally, Venerable White hadn’t forgotten this.

So, when he targeted the 'coordinates of the Thousand Mile Flight Technique' in Scholar Song's hand and launched Dou Dou and the little monk, he followed closely behind.

Venerable White planned to take control of the flying swords as soon as they reached the vicinity of Scholar Song's plane, then have them follow the plane slowly to the vacation island in the Eastern Sea.

With him personally overseeing the flight, it was guaranteed that the two 'one-time-use flying swords, version 004' would catch up with Scholar Song without causing any harm to the plane he was on.

However, during the launch of the flying swords, a slight mishap occurred…

Just a moment ago, as the flying swords carrying Dou Dou and the little monk soared over the Eastern Sea, they suddenly seemed to hit an invisible barrier. That barrier carried a strange force, and the moment Dou Dou and the little monk made contact with it, they were put into a deep sleep.

Meanwhile, the two flying swords plunged into the invisible barrier and subsequently vanished like starlight!

Fortunately, Venerable White was right behind them. Seeing Dou Dou and the little monk begin to fall into the sea, he quickly reached out, using his spiritual power to catch them.

Gazing at the invisible yet tangible barrier before him, Venerable White pondered.

"The flying swords disappeared. Is this a space transfer spell?"

The one-time-use flying swords version 004 had been tracking Scholar Song… Now, if they had crashed into this barrier, did it mean that the plane Scholar Song was on had also entered this mysterious barrier?

Where could this barrier lead to?

Venerable White stepped onto the void as if walking on solid ground and approached the transparent barrier.

"Is it the mysterious island?" he thought to himself.

Recently, the strange phenomena in the skies above the Eastern Sea had been attributed to that mysterious island, which had caused everyone in the Ninefold Land Group to lose their memories, hadn’t it?

After some thought, Venerable White reached out to touch the barrier—he had long wished to locate the mysterious island, but it felt like the island had been playing hide and seek with him; no matter what he did, he couldn’t find it.

Having finally found a lead, he certainly didn’t mind investigating this mysterious island.

Then, the moment Venerable White’s hand pressed against the transparent barrier… *Crack!* A series of strange sounds erupted.

The transparent barrier shattered as if it had broken apart, disappearing without a trace.

The skies above the Eastern Sea returned to tranquility, empty and void of anything.

Venerable White’s expression stiffened—what the heck? I just pressed my hand against it, and the barrier shattered?

How rude!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On the island in the sky.

It seemed like quite a while had passed since the incident of the 'flying sword cutting the plane.'

Scholar Song gradually regained consciousness… The last image in his memory was of the two one-time-use flying swords version 004 slicing off the nose of the plane.

Then, he lost consciousness.

—Am I still alive?

He marveled at his tenacity in surviving yet another day!

"So, where am I now?" he mused—he seemed to have fallen into the water, his body immersed in a liquid, floating up and down.

Please don’t tell me I fell into that Crescent Lake? There could be monsters in there!

But the water feels a bit warm and comfortable.

Is the water of Crescent Lake a hot spring?

While he was pondering, a hurried shouting echoed in his ears.

The sound was rhythmic, as if many people were shouting together—not in fear, but singing?

Scholar Song took a deep breath.

He opened his eyes.

Then, he was stunned.

What the heck is this Crescent Lake?

What the heck is this hot spring water?

At that moment, he found himself lying in a large pot, flames roaring beneath it. The water inside was slowly heating up, bubbles rising to the surface.

And he could see a variety of spices and vegetables floating in the water...

He was tightly bound!

This scene immediately reminded him of cannibalism in movies. But the image of boiling a living person in a pot was purely fictional. Even in reality, cannibals wouldn’t do that!

What kind of bizarre twist is this?

Who is playing this cruel prank on him?

Scholar Song looked towards the edge of the pot where the shouting 'people' were.

He froze again.

Because the ones surrounding the pot were not humans, but over twenty black gorillas.

They stood upright, circling the pot, shouting, cheering, and jumping around like primitive tribes from a movie.

"They want to eat me." Scholar Song chuckled bitterly; he had never thought he would be treated as food one day.

If he hadn’t woken up just in time, who knows, in another hour or two, a dish called ‘Boiled Scholar Song’ would’ve appeared on the gorillas’ dining table, and he would have been devoured whole!

Moreover… Why are these gorillas cooking in a pot like humans? Where did this pot come from?

Well, now is not the time to think about that.

Scholar Song exerted a little strength, and even without using any blood energy, the ropes binding him snapped apart.

Then, he stood up from the pot and looked around. He quickly noticed Tu Bo, Gao, and his girlfriend Mei Yi, also tightly bound nearby, along with his backpack and the invisible sword, the Breaking Blade, tossed aside.

Thank goodness… he was the first one thrown into the pot. If the gorillas had chosen Tu Bo and the others first, they might have been cooked alive!

Also, where did the other passengers go?

Tu Bo and the others were with him in the cockpit; had the other passengers scattered away?

…

…

As Scholar Song suddenly stood up from the pot, the dancing gorillas froze.

“Grrr?”

“Ughh?”

They looked at the food that had just stood up in confusion.

After a moment, the strongest gorilla let out a loud roar, pounding its chest vigorously.

Was it challenging him?

Scholar Song jumped out of the pot, cracking his knuckles.

“Grrr.” The strong gorilla dropped to all fours and charged at Scholar Song. At the same time, it picked up a massive rock and hurled it at him.

These black gorillas have become smarter, haven’t they?

With a twist of his wrist, Scholar Song lightly slapped the rock coming his way, unleashing his foundational martial arts technique. He used the finesse of his technique to send the giant rock flying away.

“Roar!” The powerful gorilla lunged at him, its thick arms reaching for Scholar Song.

“Hehe.” Scholar Song laughed heartily: “Foundational Martial Arts Five!”

Foundational Martial Arts Five was a technique similar to a crashing attack, perfectly suited to deal with the massive gorilla before him.

The strong gorilla felt the ‘food’ in front of him suddenly vanish with a flicker.

Then, it felt a sharp pain in its chest, as if it had been struck by a boulder during a landslide.

The strong gorilla was sent flying by Scholar Song’s strike, crashing to the ground. It struggled for a long time but couldn’t rise.

Using that momentum, Scholar Song gauged the gorillas' combat capabilities.

The strong body of the gorilla was more than twice as powerful as that of a normal one in the wild. In terms of sheer physical strength, it was comparable to a practitioner at the Three Apertures level.

Of course, a Three Apertures level practitioner could easily take down these gorillas using blood energy.

Scholar Song sighed inwardly.

Despite easily sending the strong gorilla flying, he had to use blood energy from the Heart Aperture. And even then, he hadn’t dealt it any serious injuries.

These gorillas had an impressive resistance to damage.

Although the gorilla was currently down, it wouldn’t be long before it regained its strength and stood up as a fierce warrior once more.

What’s more concerning was that there were over twenty strong gorillas surrounding Scholar Song!

…

…

After the strongest gorilla was knocked down, the remaining gorillas were momentarily stunned. They growled softly at Scholar Song but didn’t charge recklessly.

“Strike first, or it’ll be troublesome if they surround me,” Scholar Song thought, glancing at his backpack and the Breaking Blade.

It would be best to retrieve the Breaking Blade first; having that sword would make dealing with these gorillas much easier.

Scholar Song took a deep breath and activated his auxiliary technique, *Immovable Diamond Body*, channeling blood energy through his heart, eyes, nose, and ears, adjusting himself to peak condition.

“Grrr!” The knocked-down gorilla had already gotten back on its feet.

It dropped to all fours and approached Scholar Song once more.

The other gorillas parted to give it room, allowing it to face Scholar Song head-on.

“Grrr!” The strong gorilla stood upright again, banging its chest and producing a booming sound.

Then, it charged at Scholar Song once more.

It followed the same routine, picking up a large rock along the way to throw at him.

Scholar Song, still composed, twisted his wrist and effortlessly deflected the rock once again. He readied his fist, preparing to unleash Foundational Martial Arts One to directly smash through the strong gorilla before him.

But just then, he noticed the strong gorilla bend its body, shoulder forward, preparing to charge.

This posture closely resembled the one he had used earlier for Foundational Martial Arts Five.

Although it was just a mimicry… seeing it learn so quickly made Scholar Song wonder if this thing was really a gorilla?

This impressive learning ability was at a scholar level!

At that moment, the strong gorilla charged at Scholar Song like a bulldozer.
