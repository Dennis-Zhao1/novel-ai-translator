### The Robbery of the Delivery

Then, Scholar Song felt the world around him plunge into darkness, his consciousness becoming increasingly hazy.

Had that uncle really beaten him up? Who would have thought that the uncle shared the same thoughts?

No, wait... How could an ordinary person, someone without any training, throw punches so fast that he couldn’t even see them? And the force behind those punches—he felt like he’d been hit by a freight train.

Was he a master?

No, I can’t pass out now—I'm really going to faint…

That was the last fleeting thought of Scholar Song before he lost consciousness.

Nearby, the uncle let out a cold smile. Amidst the stunned crowd watching, he strode away, leaving Scholar Song sprawled on the scorching pavement, unconscious and unresponsive.

The onlookers had initially thought that this uncle and the young man were old acquaintances who were joyfully reuniting, hence the young guy's enthusiastic sprint towards him for a warm embrace. They certainly didn’t expect that the moment the young man got close, the uncle would mercilessly land a punch, knocking him out cold.

This was bound to be the talk of the town.

Many people quickly whipped out their phones, snapping pictures and posting them to their social media feeds.

Tonight, the news of "A certain uncle in the Luo Xin block knocks out a young man with a single punch" would spread far and wide. It was likely that many would marvel at the uncle's impressive martial prowess.

As for Scholar Song, he would sadly become nothing more than a backdrop, highlighting the uncle's intimidating presence.

……

A little while later, Tu Bo emerged from the store, having finished shopping, but he couldn’t find Scholar Song anywhere.

Finally, he spotted his friend sprawled on the ground, surrounded by a crowd.

Tu Bo was startled.

He quickly dropped the pile of goods he had just bought and shook Scholar Song vigorously. *Cough*… Please, everyone, don’t emulate Tu Bo’s actions. Shaking someone who has fainted can be dangerous! If it’s a friend, that’s one thing, but if it’s a stranger, you could even end up getting charged for it!

Scholar Song slowly opened his eyes, only to be greeted by a sea of curious onlookers and a concerned Tu Bo.

As he tried to piece together what had happened, he thought, *Ugh, I wish I were dead!*

What bad luck—he had underestimated that silly uncle. It turned out he was a martial arts master! With a punch like that, an ordinary person would probably be out cold for a day and a night. Thankfully, he was fit enough to wake up so soon.

Seeing Scholar Song come to, Tu Bo sighed in relief. “You scared me! Didn’t you say you were meeting an old friend? How did you end up knocked out on the ground?”

“Let’s not talk about the past,” Scholar Song awkwardly replied as he stood up and dusted off his pants.

The crowd, filled with curiosity, seemed to be waiting for Scholar Song to explain the events leading up to this moment.

At that moment, Scholar Song desperately wanted to tell the onlookers snapping pictures: *Sorry, we're filming a scene for a movie!*

But alas, his face was too thin-skinned to concoct such a grand lie.

“Let’s talk while we walk.” He pulled Tu Bo away from the crowd, grabbing the pile of snacks Tu Bo had bought, and quickly made their escape.

On the way, Tu Bo still seemed worried. “What exactly happened? Should we go see your sister Zhao Yaya?”

“No way, absolutely not,” Scholar Song quickly interrupted.

It wasn't that he feared Zhao Yaya’s nagging; it was more that if she found out he had been knocked out cold by the silly uncle who mistook him for a "scammer," she would surely mock him for over a month. That would be unbearable!

“Then you have to tell me how you ended up fainting,” Tu Bo insisted, still concerned.

“I ran into someone I knew, and that guy had some misunderstandings about me,” Scholar Song gritted his teeth and explained. “Before I could clarify, he punched me really hard. I don’t know what happened next; I just blacked out.”

Tu Bo nodded, half convinced—could someone really be knocked out cold from just one punch? Surely, Scholar Song wasn't lying, was he? Was this some kind of martial arts movie?

Tu Bo had been in plenty of fights growing up and had taken hits to the face, but he had never been knocked out by a single punch.

Just then, his phone buzzed.

Tu Bo opened it to find a message from someone named Gao: “Hey, where are you? Didn’t you go out with Scholar Song to sign up for driving lessons? How come Scholar Song just got knocked out by some uncle?”

There was also a link to a social media post.

The accompanying image showed Scholar Song sprawled on the ground, with the uncle walking away like a king, cold and aloof, alongside a full description of how the uncle had knocked out the enthusiastic young man.

“Wow, you really did get knocked out by someone!” Tu Bo exclaimed.

Scholar Song leaned over to take a look and immediately saw the photo of himself on the ground.

Oh no, he was really going to be famous now.

Scholar Song facepalmed in despair, as merely covering his face couldn’t adequately express his sorrow.

What a misfortune!!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile, in a quiet private room at the Fourth People’s Hospital in Jiangnan.

Si Ma Jiang sat on the hospital bed, his expression as cold as ice, his head wrapped tightly in thick bandages.

A few men in suits stood around him, equally serious and silent.

“Have we found that robber yet?” Si Ma Jiang asked coldly, with a voice that suppressed a volcano of rage!

Yes, he had been robbed.

Robbed by a brazen punk with the audacity to intercept him!

This incident had happened yesterday afternoon, right after he had joyfully picked up the delivery from Scholar Song.

At the time, he was driving to the Jiangnan headquarters of “Harvest Express.” On the way, a young man on a motorcycle had zoomed up beside him, cutting in front and speeding ahead.

Then, that young man rode in front of his car for a while before suddenly slamming on the brakes.

He leaped off the motorcycle and jumped away from the car.

Si Ma Jiang’s car couldn’t swerve in time and crashed into the motorcycle, forcing him to brake.

At that very moment, the young man somehow managed to open his car door. Armed with a stick, he struck Si Ma Jiang on the head, knocking him out cold.

In the end, the young man stole the only package from his vehicle.

Si Ma Jiang had yet to muster the courage to call Scholar Song and explain what had happened.

It was embarrassing to promise that he would deliver the package to the customer, only for it to be stolen halfway there—his pride felt bruised!

He had to catch that damned robber and return the package before he could face Scholar Song.

No matter what that package contained or whether the motorcycle rider had specifically targeted it or just opportunistically grabbed it, the fact remained that he had lost it while it was in his possession. He had to get it back!

“Yes, we’ve tracked him down,” one of the suited men replied solemnly. In this day and age, finding someone was not difficult at all.

Did that robber really think that he could escape notice just because there were no cameras around? Such naivety!

As long as there were enough resources, they could trace someone’s every move, even if they were hiding in a restroom!

“Coordinate with the police and make sure to bring that scoundrel to me.” After a moment of thought, he added, “And be careful while capturing him. That guy isn’t simple.”

Si Ma Jiang was strong and had some martial arts skills, but that robber had knocked him out with a single blow. He hadn’t even had a chance to defend himself.

The way that young man had jumped off the motorcycle with such stability showed he had some serious skills.

“Let me know once you catch that bastard.” With that, Si Ma Jiang leaned back on the bed, closing his eyes to rest.

After they captured that robber... he’d give Scholar Song a call.
