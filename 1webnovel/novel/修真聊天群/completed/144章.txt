### Chapter Translation

**Big Dog: Let me borrow your chat account for a bit!**

Scholar Song steeled himself as he entered his dorm room, locking the door behind him. 

This giant Pekingese dog was one of a kind in the world—no doubt about it. It was the same one that had chased the Demon Lord An Zhi all over yesterday, eventually managing to bite him hard.

It turns out that the smaller the dog, the cuter it is. Even mixed-breed puppies, when they’re just born, are pudgy and adorable. But once they grow up, most of them lose that charm entirely. Even Pekingese, which are generally considered cute, become less lovable when they reach over five meters in length. 

The giant Pekingese squatted on the floor, panting with its tongue out like any ordinary puppy. In fact, for a spirit beast of its caliber, it wouldn’t even fear the heat. So why was it panting like that?

For a moment, Scholar Song remembered the method he had heard from the Xian Nong Sect: to face a giant carnivorous spirit beast and shout, “Come at me, you filthy horse!” 

Well, he wasn’t a fool. It was best not to try that.

“Hello,” Scholar Song ventured, waving at the giant Pekingese.

“Woof, woof, woof,” the giant Pekingese tilted its head, striking a pose that, if it were shrunk down a dozen times, might actually be quite cute.

“You can understand me, right? I know that higher-level spirit beasts are intelligent,” he continued, feeling a little relieved when the giant Pekingese showed no intention of attacking him.

The giant Pekingese changed its angle slightly, continuing to tilt its head adorably.

“Can’t understand Mandarin?” Scholar Song asked, puzzled.

This big spirit beast definitely had intelligence, perhaps equal to that of a human. He could tell by the ‘mocking’ expression in its eyes when it faced members of the Xian Nong Sect.

However, spirit beasts weren’t humans. They hadn’t gone through nine years of compulsory education. It was possible it spoke with a sweet local accent or some strange dialect, which might explain why it didn’t understand Mandarin.

So, when that disciple from the Xian Nong Sect had foolishly shouted ‘Come at me, you filthy horse!’ in front of the big spirit dog, it simply didn’t understand? That’s why it let those two disciples go?

The more Scholar Song thought about it, the more plausible it seemed.

So, it might be judging the meaning of words based on human expressions and tone?

With this in mind, Scholar Song’s mind sparked with a joke he had seen recently.

He smiled, adopting a gentle tone, “Hey there, your mother is a big monkey?”

Upon hearing this, the giant Pekingese stopped its cute act, straightened its head, and pulled back its tongue. Its eyes lit up with a teasing spark.

Then, in a round, Beijing accent, it retorted, “Your mother is a big gorilla! Woof!”

“……” Scholar Song was left speechless.

This giant Pekingese had quite the sense of humor!

After its cheeky reply, the giant Pekingese resumed panting, looking at Scholar Song’s expression of disbelief while blinking its eyes.

Scholar Song sighed, kicked off his shoes, and headed toward the bedroom—feeling more at ease knowing that this big spirit dog could joke with him. At least it wouldn’t just eat him, right?

He entered the bedroom, and the giant Pekingese followed him inside.

“Do you need something from me?” Scholar Song thought for a long time, unsure of how to address the giant Pekingese.

“Hmm, I came to ask a few questions,” the giant Pekingese spoke again, “You’ve been in contact with the Alchemical Sage recently, right?”

Scholar Song’s heart raced with caution, and he pondered how to respond.

“No need to deny it; in fact, I caught a whiff of the Alchemical Sage’s scent on you the other day. And yesterday, I also detected the scent of the Su Clan’s little girl on you, and later, that guy Su Aqi,” the giant Pekingese rattled off the names of the cultivators Scholar Song had been in contact with recently.

Hearing this, Scholar Song’s mind clicked into place.

“So you’re the runaway pet of the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain?” He recalled how, upon joining the group, the members had mentioned how busy the Immortal Sage was and how his precious pet had gone missing.

At that time, he had thought the seniors were just being melodramatic, but it turned out to be true—this giant Pekingese was indeed a pet, just a very large one at that.

“Woof,” the giant Pekingese turned its head, looking slightly annoyed—don’t ask Scholar Song how he could tell a dog was annoyed; he just could.

“Didn’t the Immortal Sage take you back last time?” Scholar Song asked curiously, as he had seen the Immortal Sage active online recently and thought the pet might have been found.

“Woof,” the giant Pekingese turned its head again, making a huffy sound.

Scholar Song sighed inwardly—having a pet like this must be tough for the Immortal Sage.

“So, do you need something from me?” Scholar Song asked again.

“I want to find the Alchemical Sage to ask for some elixirs as snacks,” the giant Pekingese continued to act cute. “So I followed you yesterday, hoping to find the Alchemical Sage. I trailed you all the way to the hospital. But then, some bastard set off a poison gas bomb. I got caught off guard and inhaled it, making me lose my appetite for a whole day. Woof woof!”

“……” Scholar Song’s mouth twitched. He hoped it wasn’t his ‘Stinking Pill’ that had caused this.

“So, I want to know where the Alchemical Sage is?” the giant Pekingese inquired.

“The Alchemical Sage seems to have urgent matters to attend to; he went to help some friends who became ill during an adventure. They seem to be suffering from amnesia, so the Alchemical Sage won’t be back for a few days. If you’re not in a hurry, you can come back in a few days to find him,” Scholar Song replied.

The giant Pekingese thought for a moment. “Alright then, I’ll come back later. By the way, are you a new member of the Ninefold Land One group? You have connections with the Alchemical Sage and that guy Su Aqi, but I haven’t seen you in the group before.”

Scholar Song nodded. “Yes, I just joined the Ninefold Land One group.”

“Good, can I borrow your account? I just want to chat a bit, woof woof!” The giant Pekingese’s tail wagged eagerly.

“Chat?” Scholar Song glanced at his small computer, then at the giant Pekingese. If it accidentally knocked over his computer with a paw, it would be shattered into pieces and sent to the recycling bin!

“I can shrink!” The giant Pekingese seemed to understand his thoughts immediately. With a shimmer of white light, it shrank down to the size of an ordinary Pekingese.

Now at this size, it looked quite adorable, didn’t it?!

“How’s that? Pretty cool, right? Come on, let me use your computer account,” the giant Pekingese bounced happily.

“Alright,” Scholar Song opened his computer but didn’t log into the chat software directly. Instead, he dug out another independent chat software backup from a subfolder in the E drive and logged in there.

Ever since the forum master incident, he had been more cautious about his identity as a ‘cultivator.’ He had installed various protections on his computer, even avoiding leaving traces of logged-in accounts. He used a net café mode, where every time he logged out, the account records would automatically erase.

After entering the account password, he turned the computer around and let the big spirit dog have its turn—he still kept his guard up. After all, whether this Pekingese was truly the Immortal Sage’s pet was just a guess at this point.

The giant Pekingese hopped onto the computer desk—seemingly lighter after shrinking, or else the desk would have collapsed under its weight.

Then, it expertly opened the chat window for the ‘Ninefold Land One’ group. 

Next, it even switched to the Wubi input method!

Scholar Song couldn’t help but think, wait, it knows how to use Wubi input? He only used pinyin!

While he was lost in thought, the giant Pekingese quickly typed a long string of text at lightning speed.

**Ninefold Land One Group**

Shu Shan Pressure: “@Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, you big silly—come out! If you’ve got guts, show yourself!”

Scholar Song’s cold sweat immediately broke out, and it wouldn’t stop flowing.

“?” The Hermit of North River was the first to reply, sending a confused question: “Little friend Shu Hang?”

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain: “……”

Shu Shan Pressure: “Haha, I’ve escaped again! What do you think? Come at me, you big silly—come bite me if you dare!”

Scholar Song silently watched as the giant Pekingese furiously typed on the keyboard—if the Alchemical Sage saw this, he would definitely cry in the restroom!

The Hermit of North River: “……”

Wandering Monk Tong Xuan: “……”

Alchemical Sage: “……”

Then came a string of ellipses from the seniors, all aligning in formation.

No need to say more; they had already guessed the reason—Yellow Mountain’s precious runaway dog had escaped again. And somehow, it had ended up at Scholar Song’s place, using his account to chat.

“Little Dou Dou, stop messing around,” the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain replied.

“Pfft, I’m messing around! What are you gonna do about it? Come bite me if you dare!” the giant Pekingese cheerfully tapped away at the keyboard.

Just as that message was sent, a system prompt appeared:

[System Alert: (＊＊＊＊＊＊) Shu Shan Pressure has been muted for 1 day by the group owner, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.]

Muted.

In recent days, the Immortal Sage had used that muting spell more times than in the entire previous month; it made Scholar Song feel exhausted just thinking about it.

“Damn it, you big silly! How dare you mute me! Woof, woof, woof!” the giant Pekingese barked angrily.

If I were the Immortal Sage, I’d definitely mute you too. No, I might even consider if I should have dog hotpot for dinner, Scholar Song thought to himself.

—Wait, hang on, this account is mine!

At that moment, in the Ninefold Land One group, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain sent another message: “Little friend Shu Hang, please take care of Little Dou Dou for a while. Once I finish my matters here, at most in two months, I’ll come to pick it up. Until then… don’t let Little Dou Dou run away!”

Scholar Song glanced at the giant Pekingese, then at his own thin arms and legs. Keeping an eye on ‘Little Dou Dou’? He felt like this task was utterly hopeless.

The giant Pekingese turned its head and looked at Scholar Song: “Woof, woof, with this rookie around, how could you ever keep me under control?”

Scholar Song felt a vein throbbing on his forehead!
