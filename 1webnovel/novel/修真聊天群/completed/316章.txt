**Chapter 1: The Chilling Entrance**

As Scholar Song approached the ancient bronze temple, a sudden chill washed over him, sinking deep into his bones. This wasn’t just the cold of the natural world; it was a piercing cold, infused with an icy spiritual energy. 

Within his body, the qi and blood in his meridians surged instinctively, fighting against the biting cold, and he felt a bit more at ease. 

Miss Nine Lanterns stepped forward and pushed open the massive doors of the bronze temple. Instantly, a wave of visible frost-laden mist surged toward them, as if a massive icebox had just been opened. 

Scholar Song shivered violently, consciously igniting the qi within his meridians to counteract the cold. “It’s so cold,” he muttered.

Was this ancient bronze temple a training ground for someone who practiced ice-based techniques? It felt like stepping into a gigantic freezer.

“This place is always like this. Today’s actually warmer than usual. The last few times I came here, it was covered in ice shards,” Miss Nine Lanterns said, floating gracefully like a golden lotus to Scholar Song’s side. With a gentle clap of her palm, she parted the oncoming mist to the sides. “Come on, let's go inside.”

With her shielding him from the cold, Scholar Song immediately felt a surge of warmth return to his body.

Inside the bronze temple, the air was thick with cold mist, reducing visibility to nearly nothing. Even with his opened spiritual eyes, he could only see about three meters ahead. He had to keep closely behind Miss Nine Lanterns; if he lost her, he risked being frozen solid by the frigid energies lurking within the temple.

“Here we are,” Miss Nine Lanterns said softly as she paused in front of a small pedestal.

“Achoo! Achoo!” Scholar Song sneezed multiple times, hugging his arms tightly against his body to stave off the chill.

“Open your mouth,” Miss Nine Lanterns instructed with a smile.

Scholar Song obediently complied, and soon he felt a pill drop onto his tongue. It melted instantaneously, and warmth flooded through his entire being, making him let out a contented moan.

“What was that pill?” he asked.

“It’s a Cold Resistance Pill, not quite a true pill, but it’s useful in cold secret realms or during cave explorations,” she explained. 

Scholar Song shot her a resentful glance. “Miss Nine Lanterns, if you had such a great pill, you should’ve given it to me sooner! I’ve been shivering like a dog out here!”

“Ha ha ha! ‘Shivering like a dog’—I appreciate that expression!” Miss Nine Lanterns gave him a thumbs up.

“And if I had given it to you earlier, you would have regretted it,” she continued, gesturing to the swirling cold mist around them. “While it may freeze you solid, the cold spiritual energy within actually strengthens your body. Young man, you must endure hardships to reach greatness!”

“Achoo! Achoo!” Scholar Song sneezed again. Although his body felt warm after taking the Cold Resistance Pill, another wave of bone-chilling cold swept over him.

He turned toward the source of the cold and saw a figure in a white robe standing on the pedestal three meters away. 

The figure was enveloped in a voluminous white robe, and a delicate metallic mask covered their face. Apart from their hands, no skin was visible.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but stare at the figure’s hands—one was as white as jade, while the other was a deep crimson.

“I apologize, young friend. My domain is a bit chilly; please forgive me,” the figure spoke in a deep, sonorous voice. This must be the elder Miss Nine Lanterns mentioned.

At that moment, a fluffy rabbit emerged from beneath the figure's robe. The elder bent down to scoop up the long-haired white rabbit, gently stroking it with their jade-like hand.

“Hello, Elder,” Scholar Song said, curiosity getting the better of him as he gazed at the elder’s metallic mask. There was something compelling about it, and he felt an urge to lift it and see the elder’s true face.

Miss Nine Lanterns gently nudged him. “Young man, don’t stare at the elder’s mask… They have encountered the secrets of ‘Immortality.’ With your current strength, even with the mask, staring too long could affect your ‘Dao Heart.’”

Encountering the secrets of ‘Immortality’? From Miss Nine Lanterns’ previous conversations, Scholar Song had gathered that the pinnacle of cultivation was the ‘Immortal’ realm. Beyond that lay the ability to carry the heavenly mandate and forge the ‘New Way of Heaven.’

The Way of Heaven was singular; unless the ‘Old Way of Heaven’ disappeared mysteriously, no one could claim to have the right path while dismissing another’s. So, while this elder hadn’t yet reached ‘Immortality,’ they had touched upon its mysteries, hinting at their formidable nature.

Scholar Song quickly averted his gaze, determined not to stare any longer.

“I’m sorry, Scholar Song, that I can’t show you my true face,” the elder’s voice softened, attempting to be more approachable. “How is Daoist Chixiao doing these days?”

“Elder, you know Daoist Chixiao?” Scholar Song exclaimed in surprise.

“Daoist Chixiao and I are old friends. I see you’ve inherited his unique fire blade technique. Is he still active in the mortal realm?” the elder inquired.

“He should be,” Scholar Song replied. As far as he could tell from the memories of ‘Mistress Scallion’ and ‘Wandering Cultivator Li Tiansu,’ Daoist Chixiao had planted Mistress Scallion three hundred years ago, and at some point, took Li Tiansu as a disciple during an unknown dynasty.

The elder nodded slightly, satisfied with that answer. He didn’t press further, content to know that his old friend was still among the living.

Daoist Chixiao had chosen a path distinct from his own; with countless paths to choose from, no one could claim to have the right one.

The elder settled down cross-legged, placing the long-haired rabbit on his lap, and said to Scholar Song, “Scholar Song, when you entered this place, you must have guessed that we are in the process of rebuilding the Heavenly Court, correct?”

Scholar Song nodded in affirmation.

“Then would you like to know why we are risking so much to rebuild the Heavenly Court, right under the nose of the ‘New Way of Heaven’?” the elder asked.

Scholar Song immediately shook his head vigorously—curiosity could be dangerous!

He had no interest in finding out. He just wanted to seal away his memories, leave Heavenly Island, and return to Earth to continue living his adorable life with Venerable White, Doudou, and the little monk.

But just as he was shaking his head with all his might, a pair of delicate, soft hands cupped his face, forcing his head to nod twice.

It was Miss Nine Lanterns.

No! I don’t want to hear it! The more I know, the more perilous it becomes!

Scholar Song struggled a bit, but his power was no match for Miss Nine Lanterns, and he couldn’t escape her grasp.

“Just nod your head, and I’ll explain our reasons for risking everything to rebuild the Heavenly Court!” The elder’s tone softened, full of encouragement.

Wait a minute… Elder, are you blind? I’m being forced to nod here! Scholar Song thought with exasperation. He refrained from voicing his complaints, knowing that even if he did, the elder would likely be too hard of hearing to catch them. It was clear the elder was eager to enlighten him on the ‘mysteries of rebuilding the Heavenly Court.’

And it seemed he was going to be compelled to listen.

“Anyway, this part of your memory will be temporarily sealed, so you might as well listen to the elder ramble for a bit. He hardly gets the chance to explain things up here on Heavenly Island, and if he doesn’t vent a bit, he might just go mad,” Miss Nine Lanterns whispered to him, giggling. “Once he’s done, he’ll give you some good stuff in return. If you can toss your dignity aside and applaud along with him, the benefits will be plentiful.”

With that, she released her hold on his face and settled cross-legged on her golden lotus, floating gracefully to Scholar Song’s right side.

“Benefits?” Scholar Song mused. If Miss Nine Lanterns considered it a ‘benefit,’ it probably wouldn’t be anything too shabby. And if he could score some amazing perks, he’d throw his dignity to the wind!

After all, whatever pride he had would bounce back after a good night’s sleep.

“Ahem.” The elder cleared his throat, drawing attention to himself.

His posture instantly reminded Scholar Song of leaders at school events, who would always clear their throats before saying: “Let me keep this brief.”

“I’ll summarize a few key points,” the elder began. 

Scholar Song sighed internally, bracing himself for a lengthy lecture.

“First, let me ask you a question—do you know why all cultivation techniques, regardless of the type, can only reach the ninth level, the ‘Tribulation Immortal’ realm, without ever attaining ‘Immortality’?” The elder caressed the rabbit, his voice rich and captivating.

“…” Scholar Song fell silent.

After a moment, he reminded, “Elder, I think you’ve asked the wrong person. I’m just a lowly first-tier cultivator; I haven’t even come across second-tier techniques yet. So, I have no clue what a ninth-tier technique even looks like.”

The elder blinked, momentarily taken aback.

Then, with a wave of his hand, he seemed to flip through an invisible set of pages in the air.

“Ahem, my apologies. I seem to have read the wrong script; that question is meant for cultivators of sixth tier or above,” he said, clearing his throat again as he flipped through the ‘pages’ multiple times.

Scholar Song’s eyes widened in disbelief—script? 

This elder, who appeared so profound and mysterious, was actually reading from a script? Did he really need to go through such lengths just to deliver a few remarks?

“Ahem, but regarding the previous question, do you have any guesses or thoughts?” the elder pressed, maintaining a serious facade.

“A guess or thought?” Scholar Song rubbed his chin, wondering if everyone on Heavenly Island had a penchant for riddles.

After contemplating, he said, “Alright, if it’s just a guess, then here goes—could it be that the final realm can’t be achieved through fixed techniques? Instead, it requires personal enlightenment, right?”
