**Zhuge Yue's Video**

As they made their way back, Scholar Song frowned—something about that strange guy earlier felt off. It wasn't just his eccentric appearance; there was an overall vibe that he wasn't a 'normal person.' Was he a cultivator?

Returning to the Alchemical Sage's building, Scholar Song found Jingba Dou Dou still engrossed in his game, happily spending time with his in-game wife. Surprisingly, he hadn’t started a video call yet—he was waiting for Scholar Song to come back so they could video chat with that girl.

Scholar Song first finished assembling Venerable White's computer and installed some essential programs. He also set up a chat software account for him.

"Senior, what nickname do you want?" Scholar Song asked.

"White, that is my Immortal Name," Venerable White replied.

"Got it." Scholar Song filled in the basic information, created the chat account, and then submitted a request to join the 'Ninefold Land One Group': "Done! Just waiting for Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain to approve the request."

Just as he finished, his phone rang.

"Hello, who is this?" Scholar Song answered.

"Young friend Song, it’s me, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain. Is this a good time to talk?" The cheerful voice of the sage came through.

"Absolutely! By the way, Senior, I was just about to look for you. I’ve just registered an account for Venerable White and submitted the request to join the Ninefold Land One Group. Could you handle it when you’re online?" Scholar Song said with a smile.

"Sure, I’ll take care of it right away. Is Venerable White with you?" Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain asked.

"Yes, I’m currently installing some software on his computer," Scholar Song replied.

"Great! I’ll go add Venerable White's account now." Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain said quickly before hanging up.

"Hey? Senior, you didn’t tell me what you wanted to talk about!" Scholar Song called out, but the line had already gone dead.

What was that all about?

Ding—The chat software on the computer chimed as Venerable White's account was successfully added to the group.

"He's in the group now. Do you want to set a group nickname?" Scholar Song asked.

"Let me see," Venerable White replied, briefly checking the group. After a moment of consideration, he changed his nickname to 'Venerable White.'

As soon as he finished updating his nickname, the Ninefold Land One Group became lively.

"White Daoist, did you break through?" Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain asked excitedly.

"Ah, Venerable White! Congratulations on reaching the Seventh Grade Spirit Lord!" Yuyue of the Daluo Sect chimed in.

"Congratulations on your successful promotion, Senior!" Drunken Moon Scholar added.

A wave of group members quickly poured in to offer their congratulations.

"Well, I actually broke through a hundred years ago," Venerable White chuckled as he replied.

"A hundred years ago? So you’ve been in seclusion for over a century since your breakthrough?" Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain wiped his brow nervously. No wonder they called him the seclusion fanatic, Venerable White—oh no, now he’s Venerable White!

"Master of Snow Wolf Cavern: I bow to you, Senior!"

"The Dharma King of Creation: Senior, here’s my ten years' worth of respect, please accept it!"

"Seven Cultivators' Lord: Congratulations to White Daoist on attaining Spirit Lord status! Yellow Mountain, you need to catch up. White Daoist achieved this a hundred years ago—you can’t fall too far behind!"

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain laughed heartily—how could he compare to Venerable White? After all, his only hobby was seclusion and cultivation!

The group gradually became more animated, with Venerable White resting his chin on his hand, casually scrolling through the screen and chiming in every now and then.

Every time he emerged from seclusion, it felt like the world had changed so much and everything was unfamiliar. But as long as his Daoist friends were around, he could slowly reacquaint himself with this transformed world.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

After sorting out Venerable White's account, Scholar Song turned to Dou Dou: "Hey Dou Dou, how about I get you a present?"

"What kind of present?" Dou Dou asked, tilting his head in confusion.

"Ta-da!" Scholar Song pulled out the top-tier computer that Venerable White had won. Since Venerable White already had one, this extra one was up for grabs: "It's yours, if you want it!"

Dou Dou stared at Scholar Song for a moment, then stuck out his tongue: "Woof! Alright, what do you need my help with?"

"Hehe, Dou Dou knows the score. It’s a small task, just a piece of cake for you!" Scholar Song explained, "Earlier when I was with Venerable White, we ran into someone who felt a bit strange!"

He described the encounter with the strikingly handsome, muscular stranger they had crossed paths with earlier.

Since they had recently dealt with the incident involving the forum master, Scholar Song felt particularly cautious about such 'suspicious characters'—what if this guy was like one of the forum master’s subordinates, looking to harm his friends?

"So, what do you want me to do?" Dou Dou asked, still puzzled.

"Could you run over to the edge of the pit where Venerable White fell and track down that fleeing stranger by scent? I want to know who he really is and what his intentions are," Scholar Song requested.

"Sure, it’s a deal!" Dou Dou extended his paw and slapped Scholar Song's hand: "But just to be clear, I’m only responsible for investigating his identity, not for taking action."

"That’s fine by me," Scholar Song replied with a smile.

"Alright then, I’ll take on your task. Now it’s your turn to handle mine." Dou Dou pointed at the computer: "Come on, get ready to video chat with my 'wife'!"

"What do I need to do?" Scholar Song asked.

"Just sit still and don’t move. I’ll operate the character in the game. Then… when I want you to smile, just flash a charming smile!" Dou Dou instructed.

Fine, if it’s just smiling, I can manage that.

Scholar Song took a seat in front of the computer and turned on the webcam.

Dou Dou opened the chat software and logged into his account.

"Wife, let's go video chat! I want you to see how handsome your husband is!" Dou Dou typed excitedly on the keyboard.

As Dou Dou boasted about his looks, Scholar Song felt a bit shy—after all, the one singing praises was him!

"Hey? Husband, is the video ready?" A young girl quickly replied, accepting the video call.

In no time, a girl around seventeen or eighteen appeared on the screen. Compared to yesterday, her complexion looked rosy, and she seemed even more vibrant.

Scholar Song's face also appeared on her computer screen. Compared to a few years ago, he looked more mature, with a newfound aura about him.

"We have video, but the sound isn’t set up properly. Just bear with it," Dou Dou quickly replied, then turned to Scholar Song: "Don’t just sit there; smile for the camera—a warm and gentle smile."

Scholar Song waved at the camera and flashed a natural smile.

"So handsome! Husband, I like you the most!" The girl pouted, making a kissing gesture.

Scholar Song felt his face heat up; it was so embarrassing.

"Come on, let’s get into the game. Today we’re not running dungeons; we’re going to hunt some people! Last night, I stayed up all night gathering a full set of War God gear; those guys who guarded your body yesterday will pay back a hundredfold!" Dou Dou exclaimed excitedly, then turned to Scholar Song: "Give me a confident and dashing expression to match!"

Scholar Song took a deep breath, his eyes shining brightly, filled with confidence and charisma.

"Husband, you’re the best! Love you to bits!" The girl giggled.

Scholar Song gave a thumbs-up to the camera—still, that saying about shyness? Once it reached its limit, it could lead to a carefree explosion, tossing all embarrassment aside!

Dou Dou and that girl quickly dove into the game, charging ahead to defeat enemies.

Scholar Song was busy keeping up with Dou Dou, making all sorts of expressions—handsome, excited, or laughing wildly…

He felt like he was sprinting straight down the path to becoming a movie star!

With some downtime, Scholar Song pulled out his phone, opened the campus forum, and began browsing the news.

Soon, a post caught his attention.

"Shocking! This morning, a massive sinkhole appeared near Jiangnan University City’s electronics market! The sinkhole has a diameter of over thirty meters! Nearby residents reported hearing a deafening explosion just before it occurred. The cause of the sinkhole is still under investigation, so please be cautious, students!"

So quickly, this news was already on the campus forum?

Hopefully, the authorities will provide an explanation for the ‘sinkhole’ soon.

As he continued scrolling through the campus forum, he suddenly spotted a familiar name—Zhuge Yue.

"[Hahaha, laughing my head off! Check out the true face of Chinese Kung Fu from a foreigner's perspective—Warning: Do not drink water while watching this video!]" 

Accompanied by a cellphone video and a brief introduction.

"Last night, I accompanied my mom to a corporate reception to welcome a foreign partner to our company. During the reception, this foreigner had a bit too much to drink and insisted on demonstrating a set of Chinese Kung Fu he learned from a master during his daughter’s school sports day. Without further ado, here’s the video!"

Scholar Song's expression stiffened—Chinese Kung Fu, foreigner, sports day, master?

These words alone didn’t raise any alarms, but together, they painted a troubling picture.

He clicked play on the video.

A tall foreigner appeared on the screen.

"Burp—I'm feeling great today! Let me show you all some Chinese Kung Fu! Zhong—guo—gong—fu! Recently, during my daughter’s sports day, I met a master and begged him to teach me a secret technique!" The foreigner spoke in awkward Chinese.

After finishing, he clasped his hands together and bowed.

Then he began performing what he claimed was Chinese Kung Fu.

"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight! Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight… Four, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!" The foreigner shouted the numbers, executing the second set of radio calisthenics, "The Times Are Calling," to the astonishment of everyone present!

The Chinese shareholders were blushing, forced to stand and applaud vigorously!

Damn it, how could they not applaud? Otherwise, they would burst out laughing, and clapping would help mask the laughter.

If that didn’t work, they could always use the applause to cover their laughter!

In the video, Zhuge Yue was already laughing uncontrollably.

Scholar Song covered his face, unable to watch any longer—simply hiding his face wasn’t enough to express his tumultuous feelings at that moment—he recognized that foreigner.

The foreigner was named Joseph Guy Maupassant, Scholar Song's nominal 'registered disciple'!
