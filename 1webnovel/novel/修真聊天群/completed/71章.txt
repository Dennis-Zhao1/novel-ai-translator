**Dismantling Buildings with Bare Hands Is No Dream**

Scholar Song understood in his heart that the Alchemical Sage was subtly helping him. Those who wanted to seize his Phantom Spirit likely possessed strength above the second-grade True Master level.

“Is this considered a magical artifact?” Scholar Song asked.

“A magical artifact? What a joke! It’s just a smoke bomb with biochemical attack capabilities. I’ve named it the Stinky Pill!” The Alchemical Sage said proudly.

That name had a strong flair reminiscent of the "Basic Fist of the Diamond" style.

“……” Scholar Song held the Stinky Pill in his hands, “Can I change its name? Senior?”

“Change it? If you don’t like it, just give it back to me!” the Alchemical Sage replied, visibly displeased.

Scholar Song quickly stashed it away, laughing, “Actually, upon further reflection, the name Stinky Pill is quite fitting. Besides, I must accept something given by a senior. It's a matter of politeness, yes, a matter of politeness!”

“Also, here’s a bit of the body-refining liquid as a token of my goodwill. Don’t refuse it,” the Alchemical Sage said, taking out a small portion of the refined liquid for experimentation and tossing the rest to Scholar Song.

Scholar Song had limited time; after helping him refine medicine every day, he hardly had time to make body-refining liquid for himself. And at this critical moment of building his foundation, he had a significant demand for it.

“Thank you, Senior.” Scholar Song didn’t refuse; he genuinely needed it and saw no point in pretending otherwise.

However, he had to remember the Alchemical Sage’s kindness.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

By the afternoon, there were two classes, and by the time they finished, it was already four o'clock.

His three roommates finally managed not to skip their afternoon classes.

“Ugh.” A certain Gao was clutching his stomach in pain, still feeling the effects of his hangover, “Finally, class is over. These three classes felt like torture.”

His girlfriend, Mei Yi, was gently massaging his temples, her big, adorable eyes glaring fiercely at Tu Bo and Scholar Song. She had heard from Li Yangde about how they had mercilessly fed Gao too much liquor the previous night.

Yangde… this guy is a professional at selling out his teammates. Whether in reality or games, he specializes in throwing his friends under the bus.

“Hey, I suddenly remembered I need to buy something, so you guys don’t have to wait for me tonight, okay?” Tu Bo couldn’t stand Mei Yi’s resentful gaze any longer and quickly used his ‘shopping escape technique’ to flee.

Scholar Song cleverly followed suit, “I just remembered I have to practice for a 5000-meter run tomorrow! I’m going to the track to train, so you guys don’t have to wait for me tonight!”

His words were half-true; he did need to practice, but running was merely a cover.

At this moment, his internal energy had fully recovered, and he could once again practice the “Basic Fist of the Diamond.” He was ready to find a quiet spot on campus to hone his skills.

The first round of practice had brought about earth-shattering changes in his body. Would the second round take his physique to the next level?

……

……

This time, Scholar Song chose a different practice location, arriving at an abandoned teaching building in the third district of the university town.

This teaching building had been constructed a decade ago and originally served as a laboratory for graduate students. However, last year, a fire broke out in the building. Fortunately, there were no casualties, but after the fire was extinguished, the laboratory became a dangerous structure and was abandoned. As the reconstruction plans had not yet been finalized, no one would come here for the time being.

This was one of the places Scholar Song found suitable for his cultivation on the campus network.

“This location is perfect; it hardly has any rotten smells. Until it’s rebuilt, it should serve as a fixed spot for my cultivation on campus,” Scholar Song thought, quite satisfied with the site.

Closing his eyes, he first recalled the eighteen moves of the “Basic Fist of the Diamond” in his mind. Then, he took out the bottle containing the ‘simplified body-refining liquid’ from his pocket and swallowed it.

He quietly awaited the medicinal effects to spread and erupt within him.

“Alright, it’s about time!” Scholar Song opened his eyes and assumed the starting stance of the basic fist technique.

“Focus your gaze, align with your waist... your body like a bow, power from your feet... fists moving like a mountain landslide.”

Muttering the fist technique’s incantation, he unleashed the basic fist techniques.

In his ears, the deep, resonant sound akin to a grand bell rang again. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth was mobilized by the incantation, converging towards him. The spiritual energy pressed against him, coiling around his fists, refining his body.

With the influence of the spiritual energy, each punch he threw felt as if he had blasted out thousands upon thousands of strikes.

His body quickly became hot, blood and energy surging within him. Compared to the first round of practice, the rise of his energy was even faster.

Sweat poured down like rain, yet he felt immensely satisfied.

This time, as Scholar Song practiced the basic fist technique, he no longer solely pursued brute force. Instead, he aimed for a balance, much like the blurry-faced master he had seen in the ‘Illusion Space’—sometimes strong, sometimes soft, with varied techniques in every move.

Spiritual energy wound around him, with some spilling out as he executed his punches.

The foul air around him quickly dissipated, transformed into the refreshing scent of a new dawn under the influence of the spiritual energy...

“A mountain isn’t high; it becomes spiritual if a deity resides within. The spiritual energy invoked by cultivators during their practice gradually infuses the area, filling it with spiritual essence day by day.”

He moved gracefully, his punches like shooting stars, and soon completed the eighteen moves of the fist technique.

Immediately afterward, a surge of energy burst forth from within him, and his entire body flushed crimson!

“Did I finish?” He couldn’t quite believe it.

Yesterday, practicing the “Basic Fist of the Diamond” had been torturous, almost pushing him to his limits several times.

But today, as he executed the techniques, aside from feeling a bit sore, he smoothly completed the entire set of movements!

Was it because he had successfully practiced it once that his body had adapted to the “Basic Fist of the Diamond”?

Or had his physical condition dramatically improved overnight?

But now wasn’t the time to ponder such things.

Taking advantage of the boiling energy within him, he quickly activated the “True Self Meditation Sutra,” using spiritual power to guide the overflowing energy within him to smoothly store it in his heart aperture.

This marked the second strand of energy in his heart aperture.

After completing all this, Scholar Song plopped down on the ground, panting heavily. He still felt a bit weak, as he had yet to perfectly control the amount of overflowing energy absorbed by the “True Self Meditation Sutra.” However, it was a vast improvement compared to the previous time when he couldn't even move a single finger.

After resting for about four to five minutes, Scholar Song’s strength was restored.

He gently clenched his fists, once again feeling a continuous surge of power coursing through him, giving him the illusion that he could split mountains and shatter rocks.

Looking around, he shifted his feet and naturally executed the footwork of the “Basic Fist of the Diamond,” taking two steps to the nearest wall.

With a straight punch from his right fist, he didn’t channel any spiritual energy; it was just a regular straight punch.

Boom!

The hard wall was left with a dent.

Scholar Song stared at his fist, which was only slightly coated in dust; his fist was unscathed. The foundational fist technique provided comprehensive enhancement to his body—not just strength but also overall resilience.

This change far exceeded his expectations—just two rounds of practice had strengthened his body to this extent.

Scholar Song assumed his stance again, this time applying the striking methods of the “Basic Fist of the Diamond” to punch the wall once more.

Boom!

The wall was punctured by his fist, yet the power remained concentrated, leaving only a fist-sized dent on the surface. The damage area was smaller, but the power was dozens of times greater!

In a sudden burst of excitement, Scholar Song continued to punch, wreaking havoc on the poor abandoned teaching building. He tried out various striking techniques from the basic fist method—sometimes delivering heavy punches, sometimes using soft palms, testing all eighteen methods.

Dust filled the abandoned teaching building.

This was the legendary skill of dismantling walls with bare hands; the next level of this skill would be dismantling skyscrapers with bare hands!

After a long while, Scholar Song felt thoroughly satisfied. Looking at the pockmarked walls of the teaching building, he stroked his chin, “It seems I really have a talent for demolition.”

Now, in the eyes of ordinary people, he could already be considered a martial arts master, right?

And he had only practiced the foundational fist technique twice so far.

He couldn’t help but wonder how strong he would be after completing his foundation?

And how much energy would it take to fill his heart aperture?

“If only there were faster ways to enhance my physical abilities, so my energy could recover quicker, allowing me to practice more often each day,” Scholar Song muttered.

Energy pills and such were not something he could consider in the short term.

“What other methods can enhance overall physical quality besides practicing the ‘Basic Fist of the Diamond’?” Scholar Song pondered.

Maybe he should ask his seniors in the group?

“Hey, I can answer that for you! Scholar Song, the Demolition Expert,” a charming and enticing voice echoed in Scholar Song’s ear, “There are actually very simple ways to enhance your physical qualities.”
