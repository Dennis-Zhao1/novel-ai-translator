**Evil Fate**

After saying goodbye to Doctor Li, Scholar Song turned to Fay Yu and asked, “Sis, I’m planning to visit Professor Ren Shui soon. Do you want to come along?”

“Why would I go with you? I’m not his student. I need to head back to Jiangnan University Town; there are plenty of things I need to help with there.” The sports meet at Jiangnan University Town was in full swing, and there were quite a few injuries in the competition area. As an intern doctor, she had her hands full.

Thinking about the sports meet, Fay Yu suddenly remembered something.

She rolled up Scholar Song’s health check report into a tube and playfully tapped it on his head. “I have a question for you. What’s the deal with that big guy who ran the 5,000 meters? I heard he was running alongside you and that you two were leading the pack. But then, out of nowhere, he collapsed? When we brought him in for treatment, he kept mumbling, ‘The silver medal is yours! The silver medal is mine!’ as if he was possessed! What’s going on?”

Oh, it must be that dark-skinned classmate!

“Even after being carried to the infirmary, he was still chanting about the silver medal? Talk about a relentless will to win,” Scholar Song remarked with admiration. “That big guy has quite the determination. Even though his words can be a bit harsh, you could see his fierce desire to win during our race. We were almost three laps ahead of the other competitors... At one point, I could see how strong his will was, so I gave him a little push. Honestly, with his skills, he could have easily taken first place. But right now, I’m just a bit stronger than him. He’s a worthy opponent.”

“…” Fay Yu said, “While your description is heartfelt, I can’t shake the feeling that there’s a deep layer of sarcasm in your words. I think I might understand why the big guy fainted.”

“I’m really not being sarcastic,” Scholar Song shrugged.

“Sure, sure, you’re not being sarcastic,” Fay Yu laughed. “I’m heading back to the university town now. Call me if you need anything. Just be careful not to say anything out of line when visiting Professor Ren Shui.”

“Got it! I always know how to choose my words wisely,” Scholar Song retorted.

…

…

After parting ways with Fay Yu, Scholar Song first stopped by a store outside the hospital to buy a bag of apples and a seasonal watermelon.

The prices for these fruits were outrageous, more than twice as high as at the fruit market. Especially for that bag of apples, the seller practically sold them by the gram!

Afterward, Scholar Song found Building 8B, climbed to the fifth floor, and located Professor Ren Shui’s room, number 532. He knocked on the door.

“Come in, the door isn’t locked,” came Professor Ren Shui’s voice from inside. Due to both of his legs being broken, he couldn’t get up to open the door, so it was left slightly ajar.

Scholar Song pushed the door open and immediately spotted Professor Ren.

At that moment, the professor was lying in bed, both legs wrapped in bandages and elevated high. The sight was increasingly awkward.

“Ah, hello! Who are you?” Professor Ren Shui squinted, feeling that Scholar Song looked familiar. He should be one of his students, but he taught several classes, and there were too many students for him to remember all their names.

“Hello, Professor! I’m Scholar Song from Jiangnan University, Mechanical Engineering Department, Class 43 of 2019.” He smiled shyly and introduced himself. “I came for a check-up today and heard you were in the hospital, so I thought I’d drop by to see you.”

That department name was quite long; saying it all at once made it feel like he was out of breath.

“Ha ha, thank you for your concern.” Professor Ren Shui’s mood brightened. A student coming to visit him indicated he was well-regarded among his students.

Scholar Song’s name was noted down in Professor Ren’s mind. The professor decided he would give Scholar Song a little surprise in this semester’s credits.

After Scholar Song sat down, they engaged in cheerful conversation.

They chatted about the recent fun happenings at school and the ongoing sports meet. They even shared a laugh about the monotonous speeches given by the leaders at the opening of the annual sports meet.

Professor Ren Shui was an eloquent teacher, and with his deliberate guidance, the atmosphere between them remained lively and comfortable.

A scene of mutual enjoyment unfolded.

…

…

Meanwhile, in the corridor of the fifth-floor ward, a well-dressed uncle was knocking on the doors one by one.

“Room 530, not this one. Damn, where could Su’s junior be hiding?” The office worker gritted his teeth as he pushed open room 531.

Inside, a frail old man looked up in confusion. “Young man, who are you looking for?”

“Sorry, wrong room,” the office worker chuckled awkwardly and closed the door.

Earlier, he had vaguely sensed that Su’s junior was in this building. But once he tracked them to the fifth floor, the person suddenly concealed their presence.

Thus, he could only confirm that the target was indeed on the fifth floor, but he had no idea which room they were in.

To find his target, the office worker had to resort to the most primitive method—trying each room one by one.

But now, having opened thirty rooms without a sign of Su’s junior was disheartening.

Could it be that he truly lost them again?

He needed to pick up the pace. If Su’s junior left the hospital, all his efforts would be in vain, he thought.

Reinvigorating himself, he arrived at room 532 and knocked on the door.

Then, noticing the door was ajar, he decided to save time and pushed it open directly!

“Eh? Who are you?” Professor Ren Shui looked toward the entrance, puzzled, since this was not someone he recognized.

Scholar Song turned around as well, his face registering surprise.

“Sorry, I knocked on the wrong door… Uh? A con artist?” The office worker started to apologize, but upon seeing Scholar Song, he suddenly exclaimed.

Scholar Song felt a vein throb on his forehead!

“I tell you, uncle, there’s a saying that things come in threes! This is the third time you’ve called me a con artist! Even if I have a good temper, I can still get angry!” Scholar Song rubbed his temples, gritting his teeth.

“Sorry… sorry. I walked into the wrong room; I’ll leave right now!” The office worker quickly turned around, his expression showing a clear desire to avoid any connection with Scholar Song.

“Hey, wait a minute!” Scholar Song called out.

But the office worker fled as if he had seen a ghost, not giving Scholar Song a chance to explain.

“…” Scholar Song looked up, feeling an urge to curse. He and this uncle had bumped into each other three times in one day, which could be seen as a fateful encounter. But this fate was definitely a cursed one!

“?” Professor Ren Shui looked at Scholar Song, puzzled.

“I’m completely at a loss with this uncle,” Scholar Song massaged his temples and succinctly recounted the incident from earlier when he was mistaken for a con artist.

Professor Ren Shui burst into laughter after hearing the story, amused by the existence of such a character—then he felt a strange sense of balance knowing he wasn’t the only unfortunate soul in the world.

“Professor, I have to return that money to that uncle today, no matter what. I’ll leave the fruits here for now and go find him. See you!” Scholar Song stood up to say goodbye.

“Make sure to explain yourself well. I’m sure if he’s not completely clueless, he’ll understand. And remember to close the door behind you,” Professor Ren Shui waved with a smile.

The problem is… that uncle might really be clueless!

After bidding farewell, Scholar Song left the ward, chasing after the uncle's retreating figure.
