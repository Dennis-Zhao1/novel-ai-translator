**Eye Aperture Talent**

After activating the second eye aperture of the First Grade, cultivators have a certain chance of obtaining a special talent ability.

Those with good luck might receive the legendary "Heavenly Eye," while others could gain abilities like "Long-Distance Vision," "Insight," "Microscopic Vision," and various other powers. However, if one's luck is truly poor, they might end up with nothing at all.

But even if they gain nothing, there's no need to be disheartened. In the First Grade, there are five major apertures: the heart aperture, eye aperture, nose aperture, ear aperture, and mouth aperture. Excluding the heart aperture, each of the remaining four can potentially awaken a talent ability when activated.

So far, practically every cultivator has at least awakened one talent from these apertures, with the luckier ones even managing to obtain two different abilities.

However, two is generally the limit; there haven't been any reports of anyone awakening more than that.

Scholar Song's luck was not bad; after activating his eye aperture, he discovered that he had indeed received a talent ability.

Curiously, he immediately decided to put this eye aperture talent to use.

It wasn't the "Heavenly Eye" of legends, nor was it one of the familiar powers like long-range, microscopic, or insight...

At the moment he activated his talent, the entire world seemed to hit the ‘pause’ button, and then shift into ‘slow motion.’

The gently swaying curtains, the debris stirred by the wind, and the summer insects flitting outside—all of these moments were presented to Scholar Song in a mesmerizing slow-motion display.

Though it lasted only about a second, Scholar Song felt as if he had experienced over ten seconds of this surreal perception.

Then, suddenly, he felt his mental energy plummet, and a dull pain began to throb in his head as he was forcibly kicked out of this slow-motion mode...

This eye aperture talent could be considered a form of "Master's Vision" or perhaps "Superhuman Vision."

—To a master, an enemy's movements appear almost frozen.

The effect was impressive; at a crucial moment, it could potentially turn the tide of battle. However, it did come with a hefty toll on his mental energy and vitality.

Early on, using it once would completely drain his mental energy; later, as he became more skilled, the likelihood of using this talent would diminish even further. Overall, it appeared somewhat lackluster.

Not too great, but not too bad either.

However, awakening any talent was still a stroke of fortune; over half of cultivators fail to awaken a talent when opening their eye apertures.

“Did you awaken a talent when opening your eye aperture?” Venerable White asked.

“Yes, I did awaken a talent ability, but it consumes quite a bit of mental energy,” Scholar Song replied with a wry smile.

Venerable White chuckled, “As long as you’ve activated it, that’s a cause for celebration. With the first aperture activated, you still have the chance to awaken another talent from the remaining three apertures. If your mental energy is low, just find ways to improve it!”

“However, let’s stop here for today! You should rest well and refrain from further cultivation,” Venerable White added.

At this moment, Scholar Song was experiencing significant mental fatigue, and continuing to cultivate would only leave hidden injuries on his body.

“Alright, Senior,” Scholar Song replied.

In truth, even if he wanted to cultivate, he lacked the energy to do so. After using "Master's Vision," his mental drain had been immense, and now he felt an overwhelming drowsiness wash over him. All he wanted was to find a bed and simply sleep.

“Then, Senior, I’ll go rest!” Scholar Song said.

He wearily headed to his room, so exhausted that he hadn't even noticed the ancient bronze ring on his finger.

After Scholar Song left, Venerable White approached and closed the window of the room.

Then, he lightly flicked his finger against the blue short sword. The sword seemed to have a mind of its own, rising into the air and following behind Venerable White.

“Renegade cultivator, Li Tiansu,” Venerable White whispered. Since he had asked about his name, he had chosen to accept a strand of fate with him. Should he ever encounter Li Tiansu’s descendants or relatives in need of help, Venerable White might lend a hand, remembering today’s connection.

Next, Venerable White descended the stairs and carved a few runes near the building to repair the array that had been shattered by the "Alchemical Sage."

“All done.” Venerable White stretched and pondered, “What should I do next?”

Soon, his gaze landed on the air conditioner on the second floor.

Hmm, since I managed to convince Scholar Song to go sleep, I might as well take this opportunity to dismantle the air conditioner and study it!

With that thought, Venerable White happily set to work on the air conditioner...

On another side, the Sunflower cultivator was currently staying at a hotel near Jiangnan University Town.

From the daytime until now, just past one in the morning, he had finally managed to recover from the shadow of the "ground pit incident."

During this time, fearful that Scholar Song might suddenly show up seeking revenge with his seniors, he had changed disguises multiple times. He even found several places to wash up to rid himself of his scent, constantly spraying himself with odor-eliminating potions, and had been frazzled all the way until now.

“Since that ‘Scholar Song’ hasn’t come looking for me, perhaps he really thinks I’m just an ordinary passerby?” the Sunflower cultivator thought to himself.

He sat down to meditate and calm his spirit, recalling the events of the day.

It was certain that ‘Scholar Song’ was indeed a novice cultivator; if it were just him alone, capturing him and obtaining the ‘Blood God Diamond’ would pose no problem.

However, he was uncertain about the identity of the terrifying senior beside him and their relationship with ‘Scholar Song.’ Was this senior going to stick around Scholar Song, or would they leave in a few days?

Rubbing his temples, he had already sent members of the "Wuji Demon Sect" to investigate the recent whereabouts of ‘Scholar Song,’ hoping to uncover some clues.

Just then, his phone rang.

“Hello, is this the Sunflower cultivator? The recent information on ‘Scholar Song’ has been compiled. Please come to the Barteme Hotel so we can hand over the intel,” a cold male voice spoke from the other end of the line.

“Got it.” The Sunflower cultivator stood up and hailed a taxi.

---

“Hey, where to, buddy?” the driver, a scruffy-looking man with a weary face, asked.

“Barteme Hotel,” the Sunflower cultivator replied flatly.

“That’s a bit far,” the driver remarked.

“No problem, I won’t skimp on the fare,” the Sunflower cultivator assured.

“Alright then, hold on tight.” The driver grinned broadly, pressing the gas, and the taxi sped off like a bullet.

In the passenger seat, the Sunflower cultivator furrowed his brows, lost in thoughts about ‘Scholar Song,’ appearing somewhat gloomy.

Noticing this, the driver asked, “Hey, buddy, feeling down? Want to listen to some music to lighten the mood?”

The Sunflower cultivator pondered for a moment, then nodded, “Alright, let’s hear some music to relax.”

He had indeed been too tense; some soft music would help ease his emotions.

However, moments later... the Sunflower cultivator regretted this foolish decision immensely.

The driver, instead of turning on the car’s music, began to sing cheerfully, belting out a light and upbeat love song.

Imagine a scruffy man singing sweet love songs in a high-pitched voice—it's quite the sight to behold.

To make matters worse, he had no awareness of how ridiculous it sounded and believed he was doing a fantastic job.

As the driver sang, he found his rhythm, moving from one love song to another—every single one a soft, sentimental tune sung by female artists.

This wasn’t the driver’s fault; he usually listened to such songs, and over time, he could only sing a few.

The Sunflower cultivator leaned back in the passenger seat, feeling his stress levels rise even further.

“Stop singing,” he said in a low voice. “I want some peace!”

The driver clicked his tongue, looking disappointed.

---

Meanwhile, above the Sunflower cultivator’s taxi, a small Pekingese was leisurely following him.

The Pekingese had a DSLR camera around its neck, recording the scene of the Sunflower cultivator making a phone call earlier. Dou Dou looked at the footage and felt proud of how well he had captured it.

As a powerful demon dog, staying behind the Sunflower cultivator without being detected was a piece of cake for him. Gathering intel on the Sunflower cultivator was effortless.

Now, he just needed to see what information the ‘Sunflower cultivator’ could extract from Scholar Song and what decisions he would make.

After filming, Dou Dou prepared to head home...

---

Before long, the driver pulled up at the Barteme Hotel.

The Sunflower cultivator paid the fare and nearly sprinted from the car.

Then, he headed to an internet café next to the Barteme Hotel, where he was set to meet the intel members of the "Wuji Demon Sect."

Recently, due to Su Shi Aqi causing trouble for the Wuji Demon Sect, the intelligence operatives had been particularly cautious, fearful of being traced back by Aqi, which could lead to the entire branch being eliminated.

The Sunflower cultivator casually found a computer, sat down, and logged in.

He pulled out a pack of cigarettes as he began to browse the internet.

About half an hour later, a man sitting next to him suddenly murmured, “Here’s all the intel on that Scholar Song. Be extra careful in your actions; avoid being discovered by the Tianhe Su Clan. Su Shi Aqi has gone mad; many of the Wuji branch's info agents have been captured by the Tianhe Su Clan.”

As he spoke, the man discreetly flicked a USB drive to the Sunflower cultivator.

The Sunflower cultivator quietly tucked away the USB drive. After another half hour of browsing, he got up and left the internet café without ever looking at the man beside him.

“If it weren’t for the Tianhe Su Clan causing a ruckus, we could have sent this intel directly online,” the Sunflower cultivator thought to himself with a sigh...
