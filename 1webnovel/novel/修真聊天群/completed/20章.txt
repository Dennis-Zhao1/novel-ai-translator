**Phantom Spirit**

“Little girl, how do you know all this?” Grandpa Tupo asked curiously. “Indeed, after that Huang Bapi built the large grave, just seven days after the tombstone was erected, he died. Then, one by one… within a year, all ten members of the Huang family were gone without a trace. Everyone in the district said it was eerie. That Huang Bapi really built a big grave and buried his whole family.”

“It’s because there are Phantom Spirits in the Ghost Lantern Temple that a skilled person bought it and set up seals to prevent the Phantom Spirits from harming anyone. However, someone pushed down the Ghost Lantern Temple and built a grave on top. That’s like digging at the head of a Taisui… The Phantom Spirits can trace the aura on the tombstone back to the grave owner and his family, absorbing their essence. Losing the whole family is still fortunate; not losing nine generations is already quite good,” Fay Yu explained. This knowledge wasn’t something that needed to be kept secret from ordinary people, so she spoke freely.

Grandpa Tupo fell silent for a long while, staring at Fay Yu and muttering two words: “Superstition!”

“Young people must believe in science; knowledge is power. Don’t follow those ghostly superstitions!” Grandpa Tupo was indeed a trendy elder.

“Pfft—” Scholar Song couldn’t help but chuckle.

However, after laughing, he felt a chill in his heart.

Was it really just that simple? Was it really so coincidental?

Fay Yu’s face suddenly turned red from embarrassment; she was sometimes quite bashful.

Fortunately, Grandpa Tupo didn’t linger on this topic for too long. He was a very talkative old man, knowledgeable about all sorts of random topics from the farthest corners of the earth.

Scholar Song and Fay Yu rested at Grandpa Tupo’s home until nine in the evening, enjoying their time together.

Borrowing a motorcycle from Tupo, Scholar Song and Fay Yu returned to their hotel.

“Get some rest early.” Scholar Song felt mentally and physically exhausted after a whole day. After bidding farewell to Fay Yu, he slipped into his room to sleep.

Fay Yu smiled sweetly and waved goodbye.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Then, deep in the night…

“Senior, wake up. Wake up.” In his dream, Scholar Song felt a cool little hand patting his face.

“Hmm? Let me sleep a little longer, I’m so tired.” Scholar Song waved his hand vigorously to swat away whatever was touching him.

“Senior, wake up quickly; it’s almost time.” The two little hands rubbed his face insistently.

The small hands were icy and felt quite pleasant against his skin.

Still in a dreamy haze, Scholar Song finally opened his eyes, only to find a stunningly beautiful girl standing at his bedside, rubbing his face with determination… It was Fay Yu.

As the saying goes, thoughts of the day lead to dreams at night.

He had spent the entire day with Fay Yu, so it made sense that he’d dream about her rubbing his face?

What a bizarre dream; dreaming of a beauty, and she’s rubbing my face?

Get away, dream! Let me sleep properly; I’m really too tired.

So, Scholar Song closed his eyes and tried to return to sleep.

“Senior, wake up! This isn’t a dream!” Fay Yu pinched his cheeks and rubbed harder.

Scholar Song finally woke up.

Damn, this isn’t a dream. In the dead of night, Fay Yu had come into his room.

What’s more… he was the only one with the room key! How did she get in? This was the twenty-third floor!

He looked at the time; it was eleven at night.

Girl, sneaking into my room at this hour is really going to lead people to think the wrong things!

“What’s going on?” Scholar Song tried to maintain his composure and asked.

“We need to go to the Ghost Lantern Temple,” Fay Yu replied. “Midnight is the best time to find Phantom Spirits.”

What? Phantom Spirits?

Girl, you traveled all the way to City J just to catch a Phantom Spirit?

This is ridiculous!

He had thought Fay Yu had come to the Ghost Lantern Temple for something important… he never imagined someone would travel so far just to ‘catch a Phantom Spirit.’

But he really couldn’t refuse Fay Yu’s enthusiasm.

“Okay, okay, I’m getting up right now… um, Fay Yu, could you turn around for a second?” Scholar Song said with a wry smile—though he wasn’t the type to sleep in the nude, he was only wearing a pair of shorts and didn’t want to stand in front of a girl like this.

And besides, coming to a man’s room in the middle of the night, didn’t she fear he might act on his instincts?

Uh… perhaps Fay Yu wasn’t afraid at all. With her kick that could take down five drunken men, if Scholar Song really did act on his instincts, it would definitely end in tragedy.

Fay Yu blinked her eyes and nodded, turning away to avoid looking at Scholar Song.

Scholar Song: “…”

Fine, fine, he resigned himself and quickly got up, putting on his pajamas. Then he dashed into the bathroom to change his clothes and splash some water on his face to wake up—he had already accompanied her to City J, so he might as well go all in and join her craziness.

“Are we riding the motorcycle?” Scholar Song asked.

“Yep.” Fay Yu nodded while pulling a huge suitcase behind her.

Scholar Song: “Is it okay for you to bring such a big suitcase?”

Fay Yu flicked her slender hand, and the suitcase was lifted effortlessly to her head: “No problem, it doesn’t take up space.”

Scholar Song felt his knees go weak again.

…

…

The roaring sound of the motorcycle disturbed the peaceful night as Scholar Song decisively twisted the throttle, swiftly leaving the hotel area.

Following Grandpa Tupo’s directions, they quickly found a wooded area. It wasn’t hard to find; it was just that this place was a graveyard, and no one knew it used to be the Ghost Lantern Temple.

Further ahead, the motorcycle couldn’t go any farther; they had to park and walk.

“Do you need my help?” Scholar Song asked.

“Don’t worry, Senior, a mere Phantom Spirit can’t harm me. I’ll take care of it quickly; you just need to stand by and support me,” Fay Yu said with a cheeky smile.

As they spoke, they had arrived at the burial ground of the Huang family.

The massive chair-shaped grave was a popular style from fifty or sixty years ago. It was unclear if Huang Dagen knew his whole family was about to die, but he built a grave so grand that it could fit all fourteen members of his family across four generations.

As it was late at night, the graveyard appeared somewhat eerie.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but wrap his arms around himself, thinking, “Please don’t let me actually encounter a ghost!”

Meanwhile, Fay Yu had already started her preparations.

When she opened her large suitcase, a layer of glowing light shimmered. Scholar Song could see stacks of jade pieces, at least a hundred of them!

There was also a large purple-golden bell, neither bronze nor gold, but it gave off an impression of being extremely valuable!

“Whew!” Fay Yu let out a breath, her long black hair seemingly moving without wind, exuding a heroic charm!

Then, she pulled out silver metal rods from the suitcase and began to place them in a circle around the large grave. These silver rods seemed quite valuable too. She then took out a string of talismans strung together and wrapped them around the silver rods.

That wasn’t all; she pulled out various powders and sprinkled them around the graveyard. Scholar Song had no idea what these powders were, but they glowed faintly once scattered, looking quite beautiful.

Scholar Song found a clean rock to sit on, watching Fay Yu busying herself by the grave.

Unknowingly, drowsiness crept over him, and he felt his eyelids growing heavy.

He didn’t know how long it had been.

When Scholar Song opened his eyes again, he saw Fay Yu dancing gracefully among the graves… dancing in a graveyard in the middle of the night; this girl certainly had a unique hobby!

Huh? It looked like two balls of green light were swirling around her, as if dancing alongside Fay Yu, creating a beautiful scene. The only downside was that the graveyard made this lovely picture seem eerie.

Such a beautiful scene deserved to be captured!

Scholar Song reached into his pocket for his phone. It was remarkable how fearless Scholar Song was; most people would probably freak out at such a sight. Yet here he was, wanting to record the moment.

In his dazed state, he accidentally stiffened his hand, and the phone slipped from his pocket and fell to the ground.

The glow from the phone screen faintly illuminated something peculiar beneath his feet!
