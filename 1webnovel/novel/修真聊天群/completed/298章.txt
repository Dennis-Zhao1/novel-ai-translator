**Releasing Past Grudges?**

In front of him stood a bald girl with her hands clasped together, a look of satisfaction on her face as she watched Scholar Song splatter meat soup everywhere.

“Wait! I think you have the wrong person!” Scholar Song hurriedly exclaimed.

He gazed at the bald girl before him, her sword-like brows and bright eyes, but there was an undeniable air of beauty about her—she was clearly the “Monk of Nine Lanterns” from Mistress Scallion's memories.

Honestly, it was only Mistress Scallion, this peculiar fairy, who could mistake this bald girl for a master; it was obvious to anyone that she was a nun!

—Scholar Song had also speculated about what identity the ancient NPC might hold.

However, when the ancient figure suddenly transformed into this bald girl, Scholar Song was completely unprepared! His heart raced with a thousand galloping horses.

Even though he had suspected Monk Nine Lanterns might be on this mysterious island, he never imagined she would make such an entrance.

Wait! This wasn’t the time to ponder those thoughts.

The pressing issue was that this Nun Nine Lanterns clearly mistook him for Mistress Scallion, whom she had… well… enjoyed herself with three hundred years ago.

She must have misunderstood something, right?

Could it be because Mistress Scallion was currently in his pocket, growing on the Enlightenment Stone? Perhaps due to their close proximity, Nun Nine Lanterns mistook him for Mistress Scallion?

Or maybe… it was because he had once consumed Mistress Scallion, which left him with her lingering essence, leading Nun Nine Lanterns to believe he was either Mistress Scallion or her reincarnation?

Regardless, he had to clarify things with Nun Nine Lanterns—his chastity was at stake!

Nun Nine Lanterns joined her palms and silently gazed at Scholar Song, smiling without saying a word. Her enigmatic smile only added to the pressure he felt.

“Nun, you must have misunderstood; I’m really not Mistress Scallion!” Scholar Song insisted seriously.

Nun Nine Lanterns smiled brightly, her expression radiating warmth: “Scholar Song, you’re too attached to your thoughts.”

“I really am not Mistress Scallion. Look, she’s right here!” Scholar Song quickly reached into his pocket to pull out the Enlightenment Stone.

But as his hand delved into his pocket, he suddenly felt a fierce bite on his fingers.

The pain shot through him! No doubt it was Mistress Scallion biting him… but hadn’t she just recently sprouted a little bud? When they arrived at the Heavenly Island, she hadn’t even been able to speak!

When had Mistress Scallion even grown a mouth?

At that moment, Nun Nine Lanterns suddenly squinted her eyes and smiled, “Scholar, I never said you were Mistress Scallion. In my eyes, Mistress Scallion is Mistress Scallion, and Scholar Song, you are Scholar Song—two entirely different entities.”

Scholar Song froze, even the pain from Mistress Scallion’s bite faded into the background.

If she knew he wasn’t Mistress Scallion, then what about that incident from three hundred years ago? 

Could it be time travel? Had his future self traveled back to three hundred years ago and… been involved with Nun Nine Lanterns?

Since coming into contact with the “Cultivation World,” Scholar Song felt that anything was possible. Time travel was something he could accept.

Just as he was lost in his thoughts, Nun Nine Lanterns began to explain.

“Four days ago… while I was in seclusion, I suddenly had a sensation. Then, for some unknown reason, a memory from three hundred years ago surfaced in my mind. It was a rather… interesting memory.” As she spoke, her gaze deepened, making it impossible to discern her current feelings. “What’s even more amusing is that while recalling that memory, I suddenly realized something had inexplicably intruded upon it. It was like a blade, forcefully cutting into my thoughts.”

Four days ago? Scholar Song swallowed nervously—could it be that after he consumed Mistress Scallion, they formed a bond, allowing him to dream of her life experiences?

Was the “extra thing” in Nun Nine Lanterns’ memory poor little him?

“As for what that ‘extra thing’ in my memory could be… do I need to remind you? Scholar, Song, Hang, right?” Nun Nine Lanterns’ smile was as bright as the first spring breeze of the New Year… although it felt warm on the surface, it hid the chilling bite of winter beneath.

She was indeed referring to him—however, the matter of receiving Mistress Scallion’s memories hadn’t been his choice. He couldn’t stop it even if he wanted to, and he had experienced the embarrassment of Mistress Scallion being… well… involved with someone.

Heaven’s mercy, at that time, he had shouted, “Stop it! Please stop!” but the dream about Mistress Scallion’s memories relentlessly continued.

“Gulp.” Scholar Song swallowed hard, then replied, “Uh, I should be considered a victim too, right?”

“A victim?” Nun Nine Lanterns seemed taken aback for a moment.

After a short pause, she suddenly gave Scholar Song a thumbs up: “Yes, the term ‘victim’ is used wonderfully!”

Seeing the expression on Nun Nine Lanterns’ face left Scholar Song feeling confused—had he said something wrong again?

“I forgive you! Considering you used such a great term!” Nun Nine Lanterns burst into hearty laughter.

Scholar Song: “…”

This Nun Nine Lanterns’ thought process was too erratic; he found that even after undergoing trials within the ‘Ninefold Land Group,’ he couldn’t keep up with her mental gymnastics.

Moreover, what was so great about the word “victim”? Why did it unexpectedly hit her soft spot?

“Don’t look so glum; let’s just let this matter go! Let bygones be bygones!” Nun Nine Lanterns clapped Scholar Song on the shoulder, laughing heartily.

Suddenly, she switched from a cunning demeanor to an upbeat and carefree mood, leaving Scholar Song utterly unable to adapt.

“I understand, Nun. This situation… never happened. I’ve never known about this matter,” Scholar Song nodded earnestly.

“You don’t have to be that extreme; there’s no need for you to deliberately forget it. In fact, I never intended for you to forget it. Otherwise, I could have easily erased it with a memory-eliminating spell. Plus, I’m a person of the Buddhist path, most skilled at resolving conflicts with a smile,” Nun Nine Lanterns continued to laugh.

Scholar Song nodded, somewhat understanding but still perplexed.

“All right, the matter is settled. You can trade at the ‘Starry Home’ once more, and then you’ll be free to leave this ‘Heavenly Island,’” Nun Nine Lanterns cheerfully declared.

“Just like that?” Scholar Song asked dubiously.

“Just like that! I’m a straightforward and decisive person, never one to drag things out,” Nun Nine Lanterns slapped her chest, causing her impressive chest muscles to quiver.

“So, I can really leave?” Scholar Song asked cautiously.

“Go ahead, goodbye!” Nun Nine Lanterns waved her hand playfully.

Scholar Song scratched his head.

After a long moment…

“I can’t leave just yet,” Scholar Song said with a bitter smile.
