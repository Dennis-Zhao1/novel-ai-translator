**Scholar Song, did you offend someone recently?**

As he returned to the dormitory, Scholar Song pushed the door open and called out, “I’m back!”

No one responded to him.

Is nobody here?

He glanced down at the shoe rack and noticed that the leave of absence note was gone; his roommate must have handed it over to the teacher.

“Are classes still going on? I remember that there are four periods in the afternoon, but since Teacher Ren Shui broke both legs and hasn’t been discharged yet, there should only be two classes this afternoon, right?” Scholar Song thought to himself.

Could those guys have gone to the place they rented outside of campus again?

That works out fine; if they’re not here, it’ll be easier for the Alchemical Sage to come by and collect the ‘Flying Sword Message’ without worrying about his roommates catching on to anything strange.

Lost in his thoughts, he kicked off his shoes, preparing to head into the bedroom.

At that moment, voices floated out from the dorm bedroom.

“Gao something, please, you’re the only person I know who has experience with girlfriends!” A voice, gender-neutral yet quite crisp, rang out.

“So what do you really want to say? Stay away from me, your expression is disgusting right now! Just get to the point; I’m in a hurry to go out!” Gao something replied.

In front of him stood a student dressed in the Jiangnan University City uniform, with mixed heritage and golden hair!

At first glance, this person looked like a sunny and handsome girl, but on closer inspection, they seemed more like a beautiful cross-dresser?

This was someone whose gender was impossible to determine by appearance alone.

Now, this gender-ambiguous student wore a face full of unmet desire, inching closer to Gao something as they spoke.

Gao something raised a hand to keep this classmate at arm’s length—if it weren’t for the fact that they had grown up together, he would have kicked them away a long time ago.

“So, today I went on a date with Xiaomei,” the gender-ambiguous classmate said with a giggle.

Xiaomei, that sounds like a girl’s name. So, it must be a ‘he’?

Gao something replied calmly, “Oh, that’s great, isn’t it?”

“And then we held hands! It was so exciting!” The classmate rolled around on Gao something’s bed, clearly thrilled.

Gao something sighed, “Okay, I can understand your excitement. But I really don’t have time for this; can you just get to the point?”

“You’re so unromantic, Gao something! Even though we’re childhood friends, you still can’t get a girlfriend! Our families have been trying to set us up since we were kids!” the classmate complained.

“Zhuge Yue, please get to the point.” Gao something rubbed his temples in frustration.

“Fine… the thing is, since it was my first date with a girl, I was so nervous that my body stiffened up, and when I held Xiaomei’s hand, I held it too tightly! I think she was in pain; it was a total disaster!” Zhuge Yue’s face fell.

Gao something was at a loss for words.

“Tomorrow, I have another date with Xiaomei. This time, I’m planning to kiss her! But I’ve never kissed anyone before, and I’m so scared that I might accidentally hit her teeth too hard, and that would really hurt her.” Zhuge Yue’s eyes sparkled as he stared at Gao something.

Gao something felt a chill run down his spine, a sense of foreboding creeping in: “So, you came to ask me for advice on kissing?”

“Uh, from a certain perspective, yes. After all, you’re the only one in my circle of friends who has a girlfriend, so you must have kissed a lot, right?”

Gao something could only nod; he couldn’t deny that.

“So please, let me kiss you! Teach me how to do it, so I can have a better experience!” Zhuge Yue said, clenching his fists.

“Wait… what? Did I just hear you wrong?” Gao something shivered, looking at his childhood friend, who was acting so absurdly.

“Let me kiss you, like a French wet kiss!” Zhuge Yue exclaimed.

“Sorry, I refuse. I’m not into that, and besides, I already have a girlfriend. Go find something else to practice on, like a pillow or a post, anything!” Gao something firmly denied.

“No way! I’ve tried pillows and even inflatable dolls, but there’s no feeling at all! I want the real deal, with real lips to practice with! Especially the tongue part; I’m begging you, Gao something, you’re my only hope!” Zhuge Yue pleaded sincerely.

“Here’s a suggestion: there’s a place two blocks off-campus where the girls are top-notch. I guarantee you’ll learn some kissing skills that will satisfy your girlfriend!” Gao something pointed out.

“No way! I’d never betray Xiaomei! Plus, I have a cleanliness obsession.” Zhuge Yue shook his head. “So please, Gao something, help me out. Don’t worry, we’re close enough that it won’t be weird. I even brought some plastic wrap; if you’re shy, we can practice with that first!”

“Even with plastic wrap, I can’t help you! Have you lost your mind? My mind is still perfectly fine. You can’t betray your girlfriend; do you think I want to make my girlfriend sad? Absolutely not, so give up! Wait, what are you doing? Mmm!”

Then came the sounds of Gao something struggling, mixed with the sounds of things falling.

When Scholar Song heard this, his legs trembled. Damn, Gao something’s virtue isn’t going to get lost, is it?

As a good roommate, should he rush in to help now, or wait outside and comfort Gao something after the whole ordeal?

After thinking for a moment, he decided to take a middle ground and wait for two minutes before going in.

What if Gao something is tsundere, saying no but actually wanting it? Wouldn’t that ruin his chances?

A minute and a half later.

Scholar Song was still caught up in whether or not to enter when the bedroom door swung open.

Zhuge Yue, with golden hair, stepped out, looking satisfied and rosy-cheeked.

Scholar Song’s eyesight was sharp; just a glance allowed him to clearly see Gao something on the bed, looking lifeless and vacant, as if he had been thoroughly played with.

When Zhuge Yue saw Scholar Song standing at the door with a conflicted expression, they froze for a moment. The smug smile on their face quickly faded, and a shy blush crept up their cheeks—did they actually know how to feel shy?

“Haha, you guys finished? Young people sure have a good relationship,” Scholar Song imitated the Alchemical Sage’s hearty laugh, trying to gloss over the situation to ease the tension.

Zhuge Yue blinked, then immediately broke into a bright and open smile, extending a hand toward Scholar Song. “Hello, I’m Zhuge Yue, Gao something’s childhood friend.”

“Hello, I’m Scholar Song, Gao something’s roommate.” Scholar Song shook Zhuge Yue’s hand cautiously. Their hand was delicate and small, suggesting a higher chance of being female.

But looking at Gao something, who appeared utterly ruined on the bed—if he’d been kissed by a girl, he shouldn’t look like this, right? Scholar Song quickly reassured himself that Zhuge Yue was more likely to be male.

“Nice to meet you! Gao something can be a bit proud and incredibly awkward, so please take good care of him,” Zhuge Yue said with a smile, exuding the grace of a refined lady.

If one only saw Zhuge Yue’s current demeanor, who could have imagined that just a minute and a half ago, they had forcefully kissed Gao something until he was completely out of it?

“Too kind! Actually, I receive more care from them,” Scholar Song replied with a smile.

“By the way, I think I’ve heard your name somewhere before, Scholar Song,” Zhuge Yue said, blinking as they pondered.

Scholar Song replied, “I don’t think so; this is the first time I’ve met you, Zhuge Yue.”

“No, my memory is usually spot on. I must have heard your name somewhere,” Zhuge Yue said, furrowing their brow in deep thought.

After a moment, Zhuge Yue suddenly clapped their hands and exclaimed, “I remember! Scholar Song, did you offend someone recently?”
