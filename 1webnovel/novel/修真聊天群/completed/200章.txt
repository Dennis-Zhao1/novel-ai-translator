**A Tragic "Air Disaster"!**

Was it because he drank too much? Or was he dreaming? Or maybe… someone was playing a terrible joke on him?

As the burly man pondered, he suddenly noticed a small Pekingese dog pulling out a… phone! With its tiny paw, it tapped three digits on the screen.

**110!**

Then, in a calm voice, the little Pekingese said, “Hello, is this the police officer in the Jiangnan University area? I’m just a kind ordinary citizen. I’ve discovered the whereabouts of that audacious ‘dog theft gang’ outside the old factory on Phoenix Road. There are many poor little dogs that have been captured. Please come quickly to rescue them!”

The burly man stared in shock, thinking, Am I dreaming? I must still be asleep—otherwise, how could I possibly see a Pekingese dog calling the police?

This is real life, not a movie!

“Dazhuang, that damn dog is calling the police! Stop it!” shouted the chubby guy next to him, panic evident in his voice. No matter how this dog came to be, it was still calling the police!

“Just to correct you, while my mother is indeed a beautiful Pekingese, I was raised by the Great Silly of Yellow Mountain,” the dog, Doudou, replied coolly as it hung up the phone.

Without a moment's hesitation, the chubby guy lunged at Doudou.

At the same time, the burly man instinctively pulled out a dog-catching loop from his waist, aiming to snag Doudou.

Doudou scoffed and swatted its paw at the chubby guy, sending him flying—he fell in a parabolic arc, landing with a scream, unable to get up for a long while. Forget about just half an hour; he probably wouldn’t be able to get up for the next half month.

After dealing with the chubby guy, Doudou turned and leaped high into the air, like a martial arts master from an action movie, landing right in front of the burly man and unleashing a flurry of slaps across his face.

*Smack! Smack! Smack! Smack!*

In no time, the burly man was knocked down.

Within moments, Doudou had dispatched the two members of the dog theft gang and stood proudly, howling at the sky: “Woof woof!”

“Monster!” the other gang members yelled, terrified, and fled in all directions.

…

…

A minute later, the entire dog theft gang was knocked out, stacked like a pile of pancakes in the center of the abandoned factory. No matter how fast an ordinary human could run, they couldn’t outpace a four-legged demon dog.

Fifteen minutes later, several police cars screeched into the abandoned factory.

As the officers rushed inside, they found the gang members piled together and, nearby, hundreds of various dogs trapped in cages. The officers exchanged puzzled glances.

“Did the person who called the police do this? Taking down ten by one? That must be someone at the level of a boxing champion!” a young officer exclaimed.

Two older officers squatted beside the gang members, staring blankly at the paw prints on their bodies.

Regardless, they had apprehended a cunning dog theft gang and rescued over a hundred pet dogs—definitely a cause for celebration, right?

But why did these experienced officers feel a nagging unease in their hearts?

On the roof, Doudou watched as the dog theft gang was captured and the dogs were freed.

Then, with a gentle leap, it quietly slipped away.

With the matter resolved, it felt like a hero, confident that it was the epitome of coolness.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In the southeast of the Middle Land, there lies a mysterious area that ordinary humans cannot enter. This place is shrouded in mist year-round, attracting many adventurers who seek to explore it. However, no matter how experienced they are, they always seem to find themselves inexplicably back at the entrance.

Experts speculate that this place might be a naturally occurring labyrinth, and the persistent mist causes those who enter to lose their way, ultimately returning to their starting point without understanding how.

But in reality… this is a place of sealing.

At the core of this mysterious forbidden zone, a sixth-grade True Monarch had brought down a celestial meteorite to create the 'Five Finger Mountain Sealing Technique' to imprison a powerful cultivator within.

The imprisoned cultivator is known as 'Cloud Mist Daoist' and has a significant background.

Two hundred years ago, he was a renowned elder of the Empty Thief Sect, having invaded many fifth-grade Golden Core masters’ lairs with impressive feats.

Indeed… this Cloud Mist Daoist is the one who provoked the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain and was subsequently sealed and suppressed.

During his imprisonment, he was constantly teased by the Immortal Sage.

The sage even set up a server and created a chat app, establishing three hundred alternate accounts to join a group to chat and boast with Cloud Mist Daoist, ensuring that his days of imprisonment wouldn't be so dull.

Now, this Cloud Mist Daoist was brimming with confidence, preparing to break the 'Five Finger Mountain Sealing Technique' and re-enter the world.

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain was curious as well. He had made time in his busy schedule to lurk nearby and observe how Cloud Mist Daoist would break free.

Originally, watching Cloud Mist Daoist escape was supposed to be a personal entertainment show for the Immortal Sage.

However, at this moment… beside the Immortal Sage was a slightly baby-faced beauty, looking very anxious, her hands clasped together, her expression conflicted.

Next to her stood a handsome, no—perfectly flawless cultivator, quietly standing behind her. The cultivator wore a gentle smile, like a spring breeze.

The Immortal Sage cast a bitter glance at the stunning cultivator beside him—he never expected that despite all his attempts to dodge, he still couldn’t escape the clutches of Venerable White.

“Venerable White, what brings you here today?” the Immortal Sage asked cautiously, keeping his thoughts guarded, even afraid to look too long at Venerable White.

“Ah, it’s quite a coincidence. I didn’t expect to run into you here, Yellow Mountain friend… Actually, I’m here to retrieve my Meteor Sword,” Venerable White explained, stroking his smooth chin. “My Meteor Sword was taken by a disciple of the Empty Thief Sect during my last retreat. That disciple, named Liu Tianzong, has made quite a name for himself as the ‘Cold Flame Sword.’ As far as I know, Liu Tianzong is preparing to come to this sealing area to help the imprisoned Cloud Mist Daoist break the seal. I just need to wait for him here to get my sword back.”

At that moment, the Immortal Sage felt a wave of regret wash over him.

Just because he wanted to toy with Cloud Mist Daoist, he hadn’t released him in time, resulting in the arrival of Venerable White.

Had he known this would happen, he would have released Cloud Mist Daoist much earlier and even thrown a banquet to send him on his way.

Unfortunately, now it was too late for regrets.

But speaking of which… it seemed like Venerable White had changed a bit? The strange charm around him seemed to have subdued? Could it be… that he had learned to control his allure after advancing?

“Hmm, you guessed correctly. I can finally control my aura a bit now,” Venerable White suddenly turned to the Immortal Sage with a smile.

What?! I was just thinking that in my mind; I hadn’t even said it out loud! The Immortal Sage was taken aback.

“Hmm, how should I put it? You’re still the same as before, Yellow Mountain friend. What you think is always written on your face. Just by looking at your expression, I can roughly guess what you’re thinking,” Venerable White said with a gentle smile.

Oh my goodness! Isn’t this mind reading? The Immortal Sage quickly forced a neutral expression, not allowing any emotion to leak.

“Ha ha.” Venerable White chuckled lightly.

Then, he tossed his long hair with a flick of his wrist, and his glossy black locks danced in the breeze.

Next, Venerable White beamed, and the restrained charm he had released a little.

In an instant, the world dimmed.

Much like the scene Scholar Song had witnessed when he made a reckless decision days ago, the Immortal Sage saw Venerable White now standing as the center of the universe.

The entire world faded to black and white, while Venerable White was the only color amidst the monochrome… brilliant, dazzling!

The Immortal Sage’s heart began to race uncontrollably.

Moments later, Venerable White deliberately restrained his charm again. That overwhelming 'center of the universe' feeling vanished.

After a brief silence, the Immortal Sage forced out an awkward smile.

“How was that? Pretty impressive, right? I can now control it at will!” Venerable White proudly declared. “So you guys don’t have to avoid me anymore! I actually know that many people in the group are secretly dodging me; I just haven’t called anyone out on it.”

The Immortal Sage silently nodded.

Then, as soon as Venerable White turned away… the Immortal Sage quickly pulled out his phone, opened the Ninefold Land No. 1 group, clicked on the ‘Lychee Fairy’ profile, and entered her group space.

Looking at the many beautiful selfies of the Lychee Fairy in the group space, the Immortal Sage let out a quiet sigh of relief.

Then, he cautiously glanced at Venerable White—compared to the previous Venerable White, who couldn’t control his charm, the current Venerable White felt even more dangerous!

…

…

“Ah, haven’t we arrived yet?” At this moment, Scholar Song was still flying in mid-air. After flying for so long, he felt like he was suffering from a bit of ‘flying dizziness.’

More importantly… a menacing figure, the leader of the Jing Mo, was hot on his tail!

Where is Venerable White? What if he happens to be flying on his sword just as I’m following him with my escape technique?

Lost in thought, Scholar Song suddenly spotted a figure walking through the air ahead.

It was a serious, cold-faced middle-aged man, holding a long sword in one hand and walking slowly as if treading on solid ground.

He wasn’t flying on a sword or using any miraculous techniques—this cold-faced middle-aged man seemed lost in thought, stepping through the air while lost in deep contemplation.

But that wasn’t the most important part—the critical part was that he was right in Scholar Song’s flight path!

“Please, no! I’m going to crash!” Scholar Song screamed… He desperately wanted to maneuver out of the way of the man. Unfortunately, the ‘Ten Thousand Mile Escape Technique’ was beyond his control.

And it seemed that he was getting closer to Venerable White, as the speed of the escape technique increased, even feeling like it was careening out of control.

The cold-faced middle-aged man remained deep in thought, completely oblivious to Scholar Song’s cries.

Then, with a loud crash, Scholar Song collided with the middle-aged man’s back like a cannonball, propelling them both forward…
