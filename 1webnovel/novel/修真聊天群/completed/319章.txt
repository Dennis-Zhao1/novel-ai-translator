**Chapter 1: The Mysterious Disappearance**

"Let's go!" Venerable White flicked his fingers, activating the disposable flying sword 004. He could only hope that this sword would open a path to Scholar Song; if it did, he would instantly follow.

In that split second as the flying sword shot forth, perhaps the terrifying sword energy startled the massive whale lurking nearby.

The giant whale let out a cry and, with a powerful leap, its massive body soared gracefully into the air!

Both Dou Dou and the little monk were thrown off the whale's back.

The sudden turn of events caused Venerable White’s mouth to twitch. He quickly shifted his weight, dropping down from the whale and grabbing both Dou Dou and the little monk.

Then, something coincidental happened.

As the enormous whale leapt into the air, its body collided with the disposable flying sword 004.

With a whoosh, the massive whale was lifted by the flying sword, which locked onto Scholar Song's position, and in the blink of an eye, the whale vanished from sight.

The echoes of the whale's wails could still be heard: “Moo~~ Moo~~…”

If one were to anthropomorphize the scene, the whale would surely be singing, "My voice is laughing, tears are streaming... Do you know on the other end of the line?"

Venerable White blinked, instinctively waving a hand at the giant whale.

"Wait, what am I waving for? I need to catch up!" Venerable White muttered to himself.

He quickly grabbed Dou Dou and the little monk, and followed after the disposable flying sword.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At this moment, within the copper ancient palace on Celestial Island.

"Because I really like rabbits," the elder's voice echoed in Scholar Song's ears.

Clutching the rabbit-shaped package, Scholar Song felt a swirl of confusion in his mind.

Finally, mustering his courage, he tentatively asked, "Elder, can it change shape?"

As soon as the words left his mouth, the rabbit perched on the elder's lap glared at him with its bright red eyes, clearly displeased.

"Huh? You don't like the rabbit shape?" The elder paused, then, surprisingly, did not refuse: "Alright, changing shapes is fine. But what do you want it to turn into? I’m not very good with animals other than rabbits."

Not very good with other animal shapes?

Scholar Song pondered for a moment before asking, "Elder, what do you think an alligator would look like?"

"Pfft—Kid, you don't think I’ve never seen an alligator, do you? Although I've been on Celestial Island for nearly a thousand years, I traveled to every corner of the world a millennium ago." The elder chuckled, then began sketching in the air.

Soon, a crude outline of an alligator took shape.

Scholar Song looked at the so-called 'alligator,' and if he hadn’t known beforehand, he would never have associated it with the word 'alligator.'

Alligator, is that how you look? Does your dad know?

With a decisive nod, Scholar Song shrunk the rabbit-shaped package and tucked it away, laughing heartily, "Elder, I just realized that rabbits are really cute! Little white rabbit, white and fluffy, with two ears standing upright, the cutest when skinned and roasted..."

Halfway through his song, Scholar Song suddenly sensed a wave of killing intent directed at him, emanating from the elder's red-eyed rabbit.

Oh crap, I messed up the lyrics.

"Well, if you like it, that's even better. Now, let me send you away." The elder nodded.

"Thank you, Elder." Scholar Song said, then made a hand seal—activating the 'seal my memories' talisman.

As he pressed the seal, the talisman in his mind began to work. Using the energy of his own qi and blood, it started sealing away all memories of his time on the island and everything related to the mysterious island.

He absolutely could not carry any memories of Celestial Island to the outside world.

Otherwise, if the 'New Heavenly Way' detected any anomalies, they could trace it back to Celestial Island, bringing catastrophe upon it.

He was about to forget everything that had happened on Celestial Island.

Though his time there had been short... he had encountered many interesting things. Thanks to it, he was on the verge of unlocking the next realm in his cultivation, the Gateway of the Dragon Gate.

Unknowingly, he was about to touch upon the final step of the first-tier realm, the Gateway of the Dragon Gate.

In addition, there were the dragon bone withered vines, the one-inch snake pouch—his harvest was quite substantial. And of course, there was... Jiu Deng.

But soon, he would forget all of this.

This trip to Celestial Island would leave him with no memories at all.

And... it was a pity that time was running out. He had originally wanted to capture a gorilla to bring back for Venerable White, thinking that such a highly intelligent creature would surely pique Venerable White's interest.

But there wasn't enough time.

As Scholar Song's memories began to seal away, he started to forget certain things.

The sealing began the moment he boarded the plane...

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Above the copper ancient palace, Jiu Deng stood atop two golden lotuses, a string of prayer beads quietly turning between her fingers.

Outside the ancient palace, she gazed through layers of mist at Scholar Song activating the 'seal memories' talisman.

With a gentle smile, Jiu Deng stepped lightly, making her way back to Celestial Island below.

The bonds had been formed, the matter concluded.

She was ready to break through to the sixth-tier True Monarch level!

……

……

On the opposite shore of the Black Sea in Celestial Island.

The massive Thunder Pig flipped over, its eyes half-open and half-closed. Its gaze seemed to pierce through the deep ground, staring intently at the tomb chamber.

Within the tomb chamber, the little white dragon in the crystal coffin remained unresponsive.

In the groove of the crystal coffin, the bowl of blood that Scholar Song had placed sat quietly, flowing softly. Although it showed no signs of reacting with the crystal coffin... it was also not being rejected!

It was neither a success nor a failure. That was the exact phrase the spirit of the dragon bone had mentioned.

"What is this? No response, no rejection... at least give me some reaction." The Thunder Pig sighed inwardly, its wound still gruesome and showing no signs of healing.

"When will this end?" The Thunder Pig closed its eyes, falling back into a deep slumber.

……

……

In the jungle of Celestial Island.

The scene was utterly bloody, with traces of blood splattered across the jungle branches.

The group of passengers with the old professor had all 'perished' in the mouth of that giant worm-like beast. However, just before their deaths, they had been sent away from Celestial Island and received a powerful healing spell... along with a bonus memory-erasing spell.

The enormous beast gnawed at its mouth, feeling perplexed.

What was going on? It had devoured eight prey, yet aside from tasting some blood, it felt far from satisfied.

When did its appetite become this large?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Scholar Song's memory sealing process went smoothly.

But suddenly, the 'Ten Thousand Li Escape Coordinates' on his arm began to glow faintly.

"Huh?" The elder looked at Scholar Song curiously; with his cultivation level, he could naturally sense that someone was locking onto Scholar Song's position.

At the same time, he glanced at the glowing coordinates on Scholar Song's wrist.

"Is this the coordinate for the Ten Thousand Li Escape Technique? But... it’s still covered by my 'True Illusion' and separated by Celestial Island. How did they lock onto the little guy's coordinates?" The elder was momentarily dumbfounded.

Celestial Island was built upon the remnants of the 'Heavenly Court'.

Typically, it remained in absolute concealment, undetectable even to the immortal existence bearing the heavenly mandate—the 'New Heavenly Way'.

But now... someone had managed to lock onto Scholar Song's position on Celestial Island simply using a basic 'Ten Thousand Li Escape Technique' coordinate?

This was frightening.

It felt akin to two walkie-talkies with a 100-meter range suddenly achieving interstellar communication—terrifying!

"While I’m curious to meet this remarkable fellow, now is not the time... I cannot let you enter Celestial Island." The elder smiled faintly.

Since the target was Scholar Song, he would return him right away, and just in time as Scholar Song's memory sealing spell was nearly complete.

With a flick of his hand, the elder unleashed a flame-like glow around Scholar Song. In the next moment, a 'space gate' appeared beside Scholar Song, visible only to the elder. This technique was a spatial spell, a method of a ninth-tier calamity immortal.

The space gate enveloped Scholar Song, transforming his body into luminous particles that began to dissipate.

"Goodbye, little guy. I hope the next time we meet, you'll have become a formidable force." The elder silently offered his blessing.

Just as the elder's words fell, suddenly, a wooden sword also pierced through the spatial barriers, appearing right next to Scholar Song.

The wooden sword was accompanied by an enormous whale.

The whale let out a mournful "Moo~~ Moo~~" cry, clearly terrified.

"Spatial ability?" The elder's eyes widened.

He wasn’t mistaken; the way the wooden sword and whale had appeared was indeed a form of spatial traversal. This was a technique of a ninth-tier calamity immortal... no, wait. This seemed different from a spell; the way they traversed space looked more like a talent ability?

Moreover, it appeared that the owner of this talent ability couldn’t quite grasp it yet?

“……” Even the elder was left dumbfounded for a moment.

Who on earth is this terrifying breed of human that possesses 'spatial' talent abilities?

After the giant whale and wooden sword materialized, they gently bumped against Scholar Song.

In the next second, the whale and wooden sword were also engulfed in the same flame-like glow and, along with Scholar Song, transformed into luminous particles, disappearing once more.

“Moo moo moo~~” The poor whale let out a desperate cry just before vanishing, clearly frightened out of its wits.

……

……

Over the East Sea.

Venerable White, puzzled, retracted his 'True Illusion' ability.

Just moments ago, after locking onto Scholar Song's position and launching the disposable flying sword, the sword had soared through the void before suddenly vanishing, seemingly triggering something, along with the massive whale.

With the flying sword disappearing in mid-air, there was no way to open a passage between Scholar Song, the mysterious island, and himself.

"Did I fail? This mysterious island really has some tricks up its sleeve." Venerable White murmured.
