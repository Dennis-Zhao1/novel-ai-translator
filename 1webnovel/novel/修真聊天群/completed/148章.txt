**Anticipation! (Cold Flame Sword Alliance Bonus Update)**

    Scholar Song felt the pressure of the book mountain weighing heavily on him. "Immortal Sage, what does '都有' mean in this context?"

    After a moment of contemplation, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain replied with two words: "Keep going!"

    Scholar Song was left speechless: "…"

    A little while later, the Wild Blade of Three Tides made an appearance, shifting the topic. "North River, have you arrived yet? I have a feeling we’ll find the mysterious island in the next few days!"

    "I’ll be there soon. I had to prepare a few magical tools and modern gadgets to deal with the amnesia situation, so it took me a bit longer," replied the Hermit of North River.

    The Alchemical Sage chimed in, "Actually, I think it would be best for you to wait a few more days until I can figure out the reason behind our friends' amnesia. It would be better to enter the mysterious island then."

    It was clear that someone was typing quickly; it must have been Jiang Ziyan helping out.

    The Hermit of North River urged, "Alchemical Sage, hurry up and find out the cause of our friends' amnesia. The mysterious island appears and disappears without warning. If we happen to cross paths, we can't afford to miss our chance."

    "I'll do my best," the Alchemical Sage promised.

    The conversation in the group continued to revolve around the 'mysterious island' and 'amnesia.'

    Scholar Song, feeling a bit drowsy, watched the messages in the group chat flicker before him, gradually drifting off into a dream.

    **Late Night.**

    One by one, his three roommates fell asleep.

    At that moment, a pitch-black spirit materialized above Scholar Song's head.

    "I hate it! I really hate it!" the spirit screeched, slowly expanding in size.

    Scholar Song, lost in slumber, instinctively shrank back.

    "Tsk, here we go again?" Doudou the Pekingese opened its eyes and, with a practiced motion, swallowed the dark spirit whole. Given its skill and nonchalance, this wasn’t the first time Doudou had done this.

    **＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊**

    The next day, June 19th, with intermittent rain.

    Today, the coach arranged for Scholar Song and Lin Tubo to practice driving before heading to the road test site for a few laps to familiarize themselves with the area.

    After doing a few rounds of basic martial arts practice in the morning, Scholar Song jogged slowly toward the east school gate at the agreed time.

    Lin Tubo was already waiting at the east gate.

    "Has the coach not arrived yet?" Scholar Song waved and asked.

    "The coach said there's a girl who will join us for the practice, so she’s driving over first," Lin Tubo replied.

    Just as they were talking, a coach car rolled up.

    The coach, a man in his thirties with a buzz cut, was seated next to a nervous girl with a ponytail.

    Scholar Song's keen ears caught snippets of their conversation from a distance.

    The buzz-cut coach pointed at a passerby in front of them and shouted, "You see that person up ahead? Drive over and run them over!"

    "Huh? Why do I have to run them over?" the ponytailed girl exclaimed, looking shocked. "I don’t want to hit anyone!"

    "Don’t want to? Then step on the gas!" the coach barked.

    The girl immediately became flustered.

    "Alright, stop for now. Remember the steps to park? Turn signals, then check for pedestrians, and finally ease over to the side. Stop next to those two boys," the coach instructed step by step.

    With Scholar Song and Lin Tubo as quick learners, the coach felt an urge to roar at his other students when he turned back to them.

    Once the coach car stopped, Lin Tubo opened the door and got in.

    "Come on, Scholar Song, it's your turn to drive for a bit," the buzz-cut coach beckoned.

    The ponytailed girl breathed a sigh of relief and quickly ducked into the back seat.

    "Sure," Scholar Song calmly fastened his seatbelt, adjusted the seat, and the rearview mirror.

    The vehicle smoothly took off, shifting gears skillfully, gradually picking up speed.

    If one didn’t know it was Scholar Song's first time driving, the buzz-cut coach might have thought he was an experienced driver.

    This was the kind of student he had always wanted. The coach wore a satisfied smile; if every student were this easy to teach, he wouldn’t need to shout every day.

    "Great, Scholar Song! Change lanes, then switch back, and let Tubo drive again. With your skills, you’ll be ready to sign up for the road test in a week!" the buzz-cut coach said, grinning.

    "What about me?" the ponytailed girl piped up.

    "Hmm, for you… I’ll sign you up for the road test when you can get in the car without constantly trying to take me down with you!" the buzz-cut coach replied seriously.

    "…" The girl forced a laugh and shrank back.

    After Lin Tubo got behind the wheel, Scholar Song slid into the back seat, leaning against the door and opened the Ninefold Land group chat to prevent the ponytailed girl from peeking at his phone.

    At that moment, the group was buzzing with activity.

    "We’ve found the mysterious island! It’s an interesting place. Just like the Alchemical Sage's intel said, as we got closer, we could feel the power of the 'no-fly' formation. However, even through the thick fog surrounding the mysterious island, I can already smell the fragrance of medicinal herbs," the Wild Blade of Three Tides messaged.

    The Ancient Sea View Immortal replied, "Three Tides, send me your coordinates. North River and I will head over immediately."

    The Hermit of North River added, "Bring along the magical tools I prepared, and make sure each of you has one of those needle-shaped cameras. If we really do experience amnesia, as long as those magical tools and cameras are intact, we’ll have a chance to unravel this mystery."

    The Alchemical Sage cautioned, "Be careful. There are fierce beasts on the island that even two Golden Core Spirit Emperors can’t handle. Don’t be greedy; caution is the best policy."

    The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain reminded them, "Don’t forget to activate your mental protection spells to avoid interference."

    About five minutes later, the Wild Blade of Three Tides, the Hermit of North River, and the Ancient Sea View Immortal met up and entered the mysterious island together.

    The Ancient Sea View Immortal was highly skilled, and both Three Tides and North River were among the top cultivators in the Ninefold Land group.

    Should these three fail, the mysterious island would be marked as a high-risk secret realm.

    Today, Sable Seven and Sable Sixteen had not yet made an appearance.

    Fay Yu was still battling alongside the Phantom Spirit.

    "I hope the seniors entering the secret realm will come back safe, and I hope Sable Sixteen can survive this ordeal," Scholar Song silently prayed.

    **＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊**

    Eight days later, on June 27th, Thursday.

    Scholar Song and Lin Tubo successfully obtained their driver's licenses after passing both the road test and the theoretical exam, and they treated their roommates to a hearty meal.

    Eight days had passed since the Wild Blade of Three Tides, the Hermit of North River, and the Ancient Sea View Immortal had entered the mysterious island. The three seniors still had not emerged, leaving everyone wondering what their findings were.

    ……

    ……

    On June 29th, Saturday, heavy rain poured down.

    In the five-story building belonging to the Alchemical Sage.

    Scholar Song was busy concocting body refining liquid.

    He lifted the lid off the hot pot, turned on the range hood, and set the fan to the maximum. The overpowering stench was mostly sucked away, but the room still reeked terribly.

    Fay Yu's provided herbs for the body refining liquid had already been moved to the Alchemical Sage's place in batches.

    The Blood Vitality Pill had long been used up, but the 'simplified body refining liquid' was still usable.

    As Scholar Song's physique improved, the amount of refining liquid he consumed also increased. Now, each batch he concocted was only enough for one use.

    Moreover, the strengthening effect of the body refining liquid was becoming less significant. Once it no longer worked, he would have to stop using it.

    Nearby, the large demon dog Doudou rolled around in boredom. "Didn't they say the Alchemical Sage would be back soon? Why is he still not here?"

    "The amnesia situation at the Alchemical Sage's place is quite tricky, causing delays in his return," Scholar Song replied, pinching his nose as he finished drinking the liquid once it cooled.

    "Every time I see you drink that stuff, I feel sorry for your stomach. How can you even swallow such a foul thing?" Doudou grumbled as it got up from the floor.

    "Aside from the smell, it actually tastes pretty good. Want to try some?" Scholar Song offered.

    "Not even if it were free! I’d rather have the Alchemical Sage's meatballs or even dog food than that. I'm so bored! Give me something fun to play with!" Doudou said, rolling around again.

    "Aren't you going back to the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain?" Scholar Song asked, puzzled.

    "I'm waiting for him to come find me. Woof! Otherwise, I’d be embarrassed rolling back by myself!" Doudou replied haughtily before suddenly remembering something. It ran to Scholar Song's computer and powered it on. To make it easier for Doudou to play games, Scholar Song had moved his computer to the Alchemical Sage's building.

    "Scholar Song, come on! Log into the chat account!" Doudou bounced up and down.

    Today, it hadn’t had the chance to tease the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain yet. Teasing him a few times before getting muted had become an indispensable part of Doudou's daily life.

    Scholar Song casually logged in.

    **Ninefold Land Group**

    Scholar Song typed: "＠Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, Yellow Mountain! I’m back! When are you coming to get me? I'm so bored!"

    "No time. Come back yourself!" the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain replied.

    Scholar Song typed again: "Big silly Yellow Mountain, it would be so embarrassing for me to go back by myself! You come and get me instead!"

    "No time," the Immortal Sage replied again, swiftly muting Scholar Song's account.

    "Ahhh, can’t you chat with me a bit longer without dying?" Doudou rolled around on the floor in frustration.

    About three minutes later, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain spoke up again: "Little Doudou, go call Scholar Song over; I have something to discuss with him!"

    "Scholar Song, the big silly Yellow Mountain wants to see you. He has something to say!" Doudou exclaimed excitedly.

    "Is it that Venerable White is about to finish his closed-door training?" Scholar Song approached the computer, opened the private chat window with the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, and sent a question mark.

    It was about time for Venerable White to emerge from his training.

    Doudou's eyes lit up as it remembered, "I can't believe I forgot there’s a private chat function! Woof! Let’s see how Yellow Mountain can mute me then!"

    "Scholar Song, I received a message from Venerable White via a long-distance transmission. He’ll finish his closed-door training tomorrow night. I’ll send you the address shortly; you should go pick him up," the Immortal Sage stated.

    It really was Venerable White! Scholar Song smiled and replied, "Great! Please send me the address, and I’ll go to pick him up tomorrow night."

    "The address is Lin Yao Village in Nan Hua Lake City. Today, I’ll also express mail you a long-distance transmission magical tool. Once you arrive at the destination tomorrow, you can use it to contact Venerable White and locate his training site," the Immortal Sage explained.

    "Got it!" Scholar Song replied eagerly.

    Feeling a bit nervous, he thought about finally visiting Venerable White's training grounds the next day.

    He wondered what Venerable White's training location would be like. It must be quite secretive, right? Surely there would be hundreds of defensive formations protecting it!

    After all, that one hermit who survived a nuclear blast had set up hundreds of defensive formations around his training area.

    What a thrilling prospect!
