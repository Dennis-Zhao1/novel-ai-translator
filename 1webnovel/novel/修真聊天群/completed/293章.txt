**Flame Blade: Streamlined Version**

The Flame Blade is just a common, ordinary sword technique in the realm of cultivation.

It ranks at the second tier, which means that cultivators at the first tier cannot effectively use this move. Even if they learn the stance of the Flame Blade, they won't be able to produce sparks when they wield it.

Only when a cultivator converts their internal blood energy into true qi can they use the ‘Flame Blade’ technique, catalyzing the true qi into flames.

The flames burning on the blade enhance its destructive power and can be shaped into a crescent-shaped flame slash, just like Scholar Song did before.

It boasts decent power in close combat and respectable long-range damage. Among the basic cultivation techniques, it's considered quite impressive.

—When Scholar Song saw the way Daoist Chixiao wielded the Flame Blade in the memories of the rogue cultivator Li Tiansu, it was overwhelmingly dominant.

When he struck, boundless flames surged from the blade, flames that could burn anything without extinguishing!

That was a blade that could scorch the heavens, enveloping the world in flames.

Even as a mere observer, Scholar Song felt his body heating up, thirsting and drained of blood, just from witnessing Daoist Chixiao's strike.

…

In that moment, Scholar Song's mind replayed the memory of Daoist Chixiao using a branch as a sword to execute the Flame Blade.

This memory was so vivid that he could recall every small motion of Daoist Chixiao’s wrist with clarity.

Yet, the specific movements of the sword technique were not the most important aspect; what truly mattered was the intent behind the strike—the fiery will of Daoist Chixiao… that was the embodiment of his spirit.

At that moment, Scholar Song felt as though he had personally experienced Daoist Chixiao’s sword intent.

In mid-air, he unconsciously flicked his wrist, clumsily mimicking the ‘sword intent’ of his predecessor.

In the next instant.

*Boom!* The treasured sword broke apart, igniting a layer of flames.

However, these flames were much weaker than those produced by the ancient bronze ring's Flame Blade, flickering like they might extinguish at any moment—a mere thin layer of flame wrapped around the broken treasured sword.

Let’s call it the ‘Flame Blade: Streamlined Version’ for now.

Regardless, Scholar Song succeeded!

He had forcibly catalyzed the second-tier ‘Flame Blade’ technique while still at the first-tier level.

Inside him, the blood energy from his heart, eyes, ears, and nose surged into the broken treasured sword. Even the energy reserves from the Phantom Spirit in his body continuously flowed into the broken sword.

Scholar Song’s gaze was fixed on the soaring eagle in the sky.

The eagle, startled, soared higher, while Scholar Song himself was plummeting downwards, the distance between them quickly stretching to nearly ten meters…

“Ha!” Scholar Song swung the broken sword again, dragging it down and slashing upwards at an angle.

A tiny, pitiful flame floated toward the eagle.

Scholar Song's cultivation level was simply too weak. Even with the Phantom Spirit's assistance, the flame blade he unleashed couldn't take on a crescent shape. It transformed into just a small, flickering flame, appearing as if it might blow out with the slightest breeze.

This small flame no longer targeted the eagle's neck but drifted toward its massive body.

Despite its size, the flame traveled rapidly! Just a second after Scholar Song unleashed it, it struck the eagle's vast frame.

The eagle was unable to dodge this time; its enormous size made it impossible to evade the flame.

Additionally… this time, its instincts failed to warn it; it felt no sense of danger.

*Crack!*

The minuscule flame collided with the eagle, and then… it shattered.

Just like that, it broke apart, causing not a scratch on the eagle?

This was completely different from the earlier powerful flame blade!

…

However, as Scholar Song continued to fall, he let out a silent sigh of relief.

He gently tightened his fist.

“Caw~~” At that moment, the eagle let out a long, mournful cry. It flapped its wings furiously, yet its body continued to plummet.

Suddenly… a burst of blood erupted from its back as a small flame shot through, barely the size of a candle flame, piercing from its back.

This burst of blood seemed to signal an attack, and in the next moment, dozens of small holes erupted from the eagle's back, tiny flames escaping from these wounds.

Each flame carried the formidable intent of the blade—earlier, that small flame hadn’t merely shattered upon impact; it had entered the eagle’s body, severing its life force from the inside out.

As the eagle fought desperately before dying, its claws instinctively loosened.

Gao and the Black Uncle fell from the sky simultaneously.

“I did it,” Scholar Song murmured.

Next, he needed to catch Gao and the Black Uncle… otherwise, from nearly forty meters up, a fall would turn them into mush.

Scholar Song glanced at the nearby city wall, calculating where they would land.

Then, he lightly tapped the pendant around his neck.

The ‘Azure Wind Acceleration’ pendant could be used twice a day; this was the second use today.

Activating the spell on the pendant, a layer of azure wind enveloped Scholar Song.

His body felt lighter, but more importantly, the azure wind slowed his descent significantly.

Scholar Song floated down like a willow leaf, while his hand reached for the side of his bag…

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At that moment… in the city gate, the Lu Fei sisters, Mei Yi, Tu Bo, and the other passengers stared wide-eyed, utterly astonished.

Scholar Song’s earlier display had completely exceeded their expectations. Running straight up nearly forty meters of wall, continuously striking the eagle with flame blade techniques.

In the end, Scholar Song had even killed a massive eagle with a wingspan of nearly ten meters—was this something a human could do?

Was he truly a martial arts master?

From this point on, even if Scholar Song suddenly extended his hand to unleash eighteen golden dragons while shouting ‘Eighteen Dragon-Subduing Palms,’ everyone present would hardly be surprised!

And more astonished than the passengers were Gao and the Black Uncle, who were plummeting from the sky.

Gao had thought he was going to die.

As the eagle carried him higher into the air, he even contemplated what would happen to his beloved girlfriend Mei Yi—would she find another boyfriend and gradually forget him? Just thinking about that made him want to scream.

But unexpectedly, his roommate transformed into a superhero! He could scale walls, stomp on a giant eagle, and slice through flame blade techniques with his bare hands.

In a flash, a nearly ten-meter wingspan eagle was taken down!

Could this really be Scholar Song? He was so powerful? The Scholar Song I knew couldn’t possibly be like this! Was he replaced by an alien?

Gao's emotions were a tumultuous wave, rising and crashing.

In contrast, the Black Uncle's thoughts were simpler: “Help, help me! I’m falling, ahhhh…”

All the Black Uncle could think was that he didn’t want to die; he wanted to live!

…

High above, Gao, the Black Uncle, and the eagle’s corpse fell in succession, while Scholar Song, buoyed by the ‘Azure Wind Acceleration,’ descended slowly.

The distance between them quickly closed, from over ten meters to just about three.

“Now!” Scholar Song pulled out a long bundle of rope from his backpack—the same rope he had casually collected when untying Gao and the others not long ago.

He had sensed that this kind of thing would surely come in handy on this mysterious island, and now it was proving to be just that.

The gorillas had tied Gao and the others together with a single length of rope; this rope was quite lengthy. Scholar Song had only taken a segment; the whole thing was a massive bundle that wouldn’t even fit in his backpack!

Next, Scholar Song infused the last of his blood energy into his arm and hurled the rope toward Gao with all his might.

*Whack!*

The rope streaked straight toward Gao, propelled by his blood energy. Then, with a flick of his wrist, the rope deftly wrapped around Gao.

After securing Gao, Scholar Song let out a quiet sigh of relief. He gripped the other end of the rope and repeated the process for the Black Uncle.

“Hold on tight; don’t blame me if you fall,” Scholar Song called out.

Gao and the Black Uncle quickly grasped the rope tightly.

Scholar Song squinted his eyes and bit down, crushing a blood energy pill. The vast surge of blood energy flooded into him, replenishing what he had expended on the earlier ‘Flame Blade.’

Directly below, the eagle, which Scholar Song had stepped on earlier, was clawing at the plump flight attendant and the female office worker, flapping its wings in a frenzy as it tried to regain altitude.

As Scholar Song fell, he had been subtly adjusting his angle to land on the eagle.

At this point, the eagle was already soaring at a height of about twenty-five meters.

With one hand gripping the rope and propelled by the ‘Azure Wind Acceleration,’ Scholar Song landed squarely on the eagle's back.

“Get down!” Scholar Song shouted, channeling blood energy into his feet and stomping down hard on the eagle’s back.

The eagle let out a mournful cry, its body once again sinking.

It flapped its wings frantically, attempting to regain its height.

At the same time, it turned its head, its sharp beak aimed at Scholar Song and his friends.

With his left hand gripping the rope, Scholar Song deftly flicked his right wrist. Mimicking Daoist Chixiao’s ‘sword intent’ once more, he aimed to finish off this eagle in one go.

“I mean, is it really okay to flaunt such blatant cheating? The Flame Blade is a second-tier technique, right? This guy is only at the first tier!”
