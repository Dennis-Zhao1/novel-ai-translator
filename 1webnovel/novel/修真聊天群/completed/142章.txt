**The Nameless Temple and the Nameless Immortal (C League Bonus Chapter)**

Should I call customer service and ask what’s going on? After all, it’s a million-dollar amount!

As I pondered this, a special notification popped up on my chat app—a mention from someone in the Ninefold Land One group.

Since I no longer had any outstanding bills, the network was back up.

Scholar Song clicked on the 'Ninefold Land One' group to take a look.

Drunken Moon: “@Book Mountain Stressed, young friend Song, your service is back, right? I just topped up your account a bit, so you don’t have to worry about disconnection anymore!”

A senior in the group topped up my account?

“Wait a minute, senior, when you say ‘topped up a bit,’ it’s not a million, right?” Scholar Song quickly replied.

“Yeah, that’s the amount. Did you receive it?” Drunken Moon’s words carried a hefty air of extravagance.

“Isn’t that a bit excessive? That’s way too much!” Scholar Song felt like his online nickname’s second half—totally stressed out!

Just to keep me from worrying about disconnection? And they went ahead and topped me off with a million? The balance on this phone was already equivalent to the entire fortune of an average person.

“Excessive? Not at all! Our group members often communicate across half the globe, so we rack up quite a phone bill every year. Plus, with all the other expenses, a million is just a couple hundred years’ worth of credit—it’ll run out quickly!” Drunken Moon replied.

A couple hundred years? And it’ll run out quickly?

Scholar Song bumped against a nearby tree to calm himself down—were the seniors in the group really calculating time in ‘centuries’?

I can’t keep up. Just a month ago, I was an ordinary person, and now I can’t match the thought process of these seniors!

“Don’t be so startled by a bit of mundane money.” The Master of Seven Lives forcefully chimed in, “By the way, young friend Song, what benefits did you gain from that ‘Blood God Evil Blade Array’?”

For me, this isn’t just a bit of money!

Sure, to the seniors it might be small change, but can’t they consider that I was just an ordinary guy not long ago?

Alright, wishing for their understanding is unrealistic. I should just work hard and catch up with the way these seniors think!

Scholar Song took a deep breath and replied to the Master of Seven Lives, “I did gain something. While in that array, my qi and blood value increased significantly; I estimate I now have around ten strands of qi and blood. I should be able to complete my foundation building in a hundred days! My body has also received extra strengthening. Lastly, I got a Blood God Diamond.”

After a moment’s pause, Scholar Song typed, “But senior, can I exchange this Blood God Diamond for something more suitable for me? Like pills, techniques, or magical tools, or talismans?”

Holding that Blood God Diamond felt oddly uncomfortable.

Besides—didn't that Young Master Hai seem overly confident when he told me that given time, he would come to visit and reclaim the Blood God Diamond?

When that time comes, let him visit one of the seniors in the group to exchange for the diamond!

“Haha, I was waiting for you to say that!” The Master of Seven Lives replied with a grinning emoji, continuing, “Once I teach these wildlings on the island to recognize Chinese characters, I’ll come find you. We’ll go through my treasury and pick out some equivalent items to trade for your Blood God Diamond.”

The Blood God Diamond wasn’t just a crafting material; it was also a prime ingredient for creating high-level talismans.

High-level talismans require special ink for every stroke and line.

For instance, the golden reusable talisman that Fay Yu casually used was made with ‘Dragon Ink’ from the blood of a horned serpent.

The Master of Seven Lives needed that Blood God Diamond.

At this moment, the Hermit of North River chuckled, “Looks like you’re about to make a breakthrough in your talisman-making, Seven Lives!”

“Hehe, I recently got some inspiration and am planning to make ‘high-level talismans’ to break through the bottleneck in my talisman path. Plus, I’m aiming to advance to the fifth-grade Spirit Emperor soon; if I delay too long, the younger generation will catch up!” The Master of Seven Lives replied with a smile.

He could have condensed his golden core long ago to ascend to the fifth-grade Spirit Emperor.

However, to form a more perfect golden core, he’d been holding back his cultivation, waiting until now.

The golden core realm is divided into various ranks, based on the number of dragon patterns on the core—there are nine grades in total. The more dragon patterns, the higher the quality of the golden core. A higher-grade golden core means a longer path for the cultivator.

To put it bluntly, a one to three-pattern golden core, without any fortunate encounters, would only reach the fifth-grade Spirit Emperor level in their lifetime.

While those with a four to six-pattern golden core, as long as they don’t fall midway, basically have a good shot at reaching the sixth-grade Spirit Monarch, with hopes of reaching the seventh-grade Spirit Sovereign!

To advance further and achieve the eighth-grade Mystic Sage status, they would need at least a seven-pattern golden core.

The Master of Seven Lives was aiming for a seven-pattern one.

Moreover, no one in the entire ‘Ninefold Land One’ group had a golden core with fewer than seven patterns; every one of them was a standout among fifth-grade Spirit Emperors.

“Alright, I’ll be waiting for your good news, senior.” Scholar Song quickly replied, “Well, I’ll take my leave for now to rest.”

“Wait! Young friend Song, hold on!” The Hermit of North River quickly said.

“?” Scholar Song sent a question mark.

“I have something to inform you. The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain just received a contact from Venerable White. Venerable White will be coming out of seclusion in about twenty days! When that happens, the Immortal Sage will inform you of the location. Make sure to go and welcome Venerable White out!” The Hermit of North River said quickly.

The seniors in the group fell silent—worried that Scholar Song might refuse. If the Immortal Sage got angry and decided to draw lots, it would be disastrous.

“Oh, alright, no problem! Just let me know the location when it’s time.” Scholar Song replied, “Then, seniors, if there’s nothing else, I’ll head off to rest!”

All he wanted now was to take a nice shower and enjoy a good night’s sleep. Today had left him utterly exhausted.

“Go on, rest well. We’re all rooting for you.” The Hermit of North River replied.

Scholar Song nodded and carefully placed his phone down—don’t let this phone, worth just over a thousand bucks, fool you; it contained a million dollars’ worth of credit!

June 11, Tuesday.

During the day, Scholar Song and Tu Bo went to pay for their driving lessons.

Then they waited for the instructor to summon them for practice.

Tu Bo had pulled all the strings, and today they paid, so tomorrow the instructor would call them to practice driving. Within a week, they’d be ready for the written test. If they passed, they could take the road test within twenty days. If they were lucky, they might even get their licenses in twenty days!

It was a peaceful day; nothing chaotic happened—well, except during class, Lu Fei started openly moving closer to Scholar Song for the air conditioning.

After dinner, the three roommates in the dormitory each busied themselves with their own activities.

Gao was dragged away by Zhuge Zhongyang, reportedly to start setting up meetings with Zhuge Zhongyang’s first ‘fiancée’ candidates.

Yang De continued working on developing a new program.

Tu Bo had gotten lost in a game these past few days.

In this way, Scholar Song had the perfect opportunity to practice.

He headed to the building owned by the Alchemical Sage and began his training.

First, he practiced the ‘Vajra Basic Fist Technique,’ followed by the ‘True Self Meditation Scripture’ to guide his qi and blood.

Today’s practice was particularly smooth; he didn’t even need to take a qi and blood pill, yet he managed to run through the Vajra Basic Fist Technique nine times!

During foundation building, the more qi and blood values in his heart aperture, the more feedback it would provide to strengthen his body.

And Scholar Song’s body had received extra strengthening from the Blood God Evil Blade Array at the Moon Blade Sect.

With his current physical strength, he could practice fourteen or fifteen times without needing a qi and blood pill!

After finishing nine rounds of the Vajra Basic Fist Technique, Scholar Song suddenly felt an unusual heat radiating from his heart aperture.

“Qi and blood overflowing!” Scholar Song’s heart stirred, and he swiftly ran the ‘True Self Meditation Scripture,’ guiding the qi and blood into his heart aperture.

This surge of qi and blood entering the heart aperture became the final straw that broke the camel’s back!

The qi and blood surged out from his heart aperture, flooding forth!

The aperture opened!

He had officially completed his hundred-day foundation building!

In that moment, he had officially stepped into the ranks of cultivators!

Scholar Song opened his eyes, feeling his essence, energy, and spirit begin to transform!

About five hundred kilometers south of Jiangnan District lies a city called Nanhua Lake.

Within this city is Lin Yao Village.

In the village, there exists a well-known nameless Daoist temple.

Due to its reputation, many pilgrims visit from afar each year, yet this temple has no name. Over time, it has come to be called the Nameless Daoist Temple.

The Nameless Daoist Temple isn’t large, and it doesn’t worship the Three Pure Ones, but rather houses a delicate statue of the Nameless Immortal.

This statue depicts an extraordinarily handsome man sitting cross-legged, tranquil and lifelike upon a stone platform.

It is said that this statue was discovered hundreds of years ago during a severe drought.

Legend has it that it was an extraordinary drought that occurred only once in decades, with no rain for over six months. The rivers ran dry, and the villagers faced starvation and thirst.

They futilely dug wells, hoping to strike water. But after digging over forty deep wells, they found nothing.

Just as despair was setting in, they accidentally unearthed a lifelike statue while digging—a statue that would become the Nameless Immortal in the Nameless Temple.

It was not sculpted by human hands but formed naturally!

Of course, some villagers speculated that this immortal statue was an ancient person buried underground many, many years ago.

Ultimately, the desperate villagers began to worship this statue.

Miraculously, on the second day after they began their worship… torrential rain poured down, a much-awaited deluge, bringing great joy.

Thus, the Nameless Immortal Temple became famous.

Even today, there are frequent rumors that villagers’ wishes come true. The reputation of the Nameless Immortal Temple continues to grow!

At this moment, a few pilgrims in the temple were quietly conversing.

“Have you guys noticed that the Nameless Immortal seems to be becoming more lifelike lately?”

“Do you feel that too? It’s as if the Nameless Immortal could come to life at any moment and ascend to immortality!”

“And… it feels like the Nameless Immortal is becoming more attractive.”

Whether male or female, everyone felt that the statue was growing more beautiful, radiating an endless charm.
