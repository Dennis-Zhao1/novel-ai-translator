**Keep Pushing!**

In his lower abdomen, the residual power of the ‘Body Tempering Liquid’ was once again activated. A warm surge of energy rapidly flowed from his abdomen to his shoulders, waist, and legs.

“What’s going on?” Scholar Song paused, reflecting on the earlier experience. He quickly realized the cause of the unusual sensation—it was the Martial Arts Sutra!

As he recited the Martial Arts Sutra, the unique rhythm of its syllables resonated with a strange force in the world around him, pressing down on his body and wrapping around his fists, transforming his recent punch from mundane to extraordinary.

This was the essence of a cultivator’s body tempering technique!

“Ha ha, you can feel that magical energy in the world, can’t you?” The Alchemical Sage squinted his eyes and smiled, explaining, “This is the biggest difference between cultivators and ordinary martial artists. You can call it spiritual energy; it’s just a name, but it’s one you’re somewhat familiar with.”

“This is spiritual energy?” Scholar Song was not unfamiliar with this concept; in fact, it was a staple in any cultivation novel.

“Exactly! The most important aspect of any martial art is the 'Sutra.' Even the most basic body tempering techniques can draw upon a tiny bit of spiritual energy through specific syllables to enhance and refine the body. That punch you threw just now had the effect of a mundane martial artist training for over three thousand sessions,” the Alchemical Sage explained. “Congratulations, my young friend, Scholar Song. You possess the most fundamental qualification for cultivation—an affinity for spiritual energy. This was somewhat evident when you consumed the Body Tempering Liquid without any adverse effects after a long period of inactivity. Now, we can officially confirm this.”

“An affinity for spiritual energy, meaning that even if I obtain the Martial Arts Sutra, not everyone can tap into the spiritual energy of the world?” Scholar Song keenly caught the deeper meaning in the Alchemical Sage’s words and asked.

“Exactly! If one cannot harness the spiritual energy of the world, they cannot establish their foundation and will lack the qualifications for cultivation. This is the very foundation of cultivation,” the Alchemical Sage smiled. “Now, don’t pause and don’t overthink it. After finishing the first basic punch, immediately move on to the second. Keep your body engaged; the more exhausted you are, the better the foundational techniques will work.”

“Yes!” Scholar Song responded firmly.

He felt fortunate to be part of the Ninefold Land One group.

Fortunate to have encountered Fay Yu, the Alchemical Sage, and the seniors in the group.

Fortunate to possess a body that was attuned to spiritual energy.

He was lucky, so he absolutely could not waste this opportunity.

With a swift turn of his foot, Scholar Song recited the Sutra for the second basic punch, executing the techniques with determination.

The second basic punch consisted of only one move, as he stepped rhythmically while his fists traced a smooth arc through the air. His punches flew out like shooting stars.

The tempering effect was even more pronounced than the first. The spiritual energy of the world enveloped his fists and shoulders. After ten consecutive punches, Scholar Song felt as if his fists were weighted down, as though they had been burdened with heavy weights.

The sound of rapid punches slicing through the air echoed like thunder.

Each punch demanded more strength, and sweat poured from him as if he were sprinting down a track after consuming the Body Tempering Liquid, the sweat carrying dark impurities with it.

Scholar Song’s eyes sparkled with delight.

This time, without the Alchemical Sage's reminder, he seamlessly transitioned into the third basic punch.

Springing forward with a lunging punch, pivoting for a back fist, and executing a feigned step with a palm strike. Although the third move was still a form of punching, it also incorporated palm strikes and dragon claw techniques. His palm sliced through the air like a blade, and his fingers danced like a dragon.

“Huff, huff, huff…” Scholar Song's breathing became labored as the residual power of the Body Tempering Liquid combined with the execution of the third basic punch, melting away in a single breath and spreading to every corner of his body.

In the next moment, he felt every muscle in his body vibrating, his already heated body turning fiery hot!

In this indescribable heat, a warm energy surged from his muscles—was it blood energy?

If he could let it overflow, he could gather the excess energy in his ‘heart orifice,’ and once that orifice was full, he would manifest the first thread of blood energy, marking the establishment of his foundation!

“I wonder how far an ordinary person, who has never practiced before, can push themselves after consuming the simplified Body Tempering Liquid while practicing the ‘Vajra Basic Fist’ before they collapse,” the Alchemical Sage mused, watching Scholar Song with his arms crossed.

He had not told Scholar Song that this ‘Vajra Basic Fist’ was not something a beginner could complete in one go.

Though it was merely a foundational technique, it possessed the attack power of a first-tier martial skill.

Even elite disciples under a mystic master, when first practicing the ‘Vajra Basic Fist,’ usually only managed to reach around the thirteenth to fifteenth moves.

Since the master received the ‘Vajra Basic Fist,’ none of the elite disciples he had taken in had ever completed the entire set in one breath!

And Scholar Song, despite taking the Body Tempering Liquid in advance, had missed the optimal age for foundational cultivation, and he hadn’t trained his body in a long time. He would likely fall short compared to the elite disciples of the sect. The Alchemical Sage even wondered if Scholar Song could last until the fifth move.

Of course, he didn’t share this with Scholar Song; instead, he subtly instilled the idea in him that completing the entire set of foundational techniques was necessary before using the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’ to accumulate blood energy in the heart orifice.

This way, Scholar Song unconsciously built a standard in his mind that he had to complete the entire set in one go to be considered competent. With this mindset, he might push himself further through struggle and effort.

“Come on, young friend. Show me the potential that comes from taking the Body Tempering Liquid early,” the Alchemical Sage thought to himself.

Just as he pondered this, Scholar Song had already completed the fourth foundational punch.

At this point, Scholar Song was panting heavily, his hair drenched as if it had been rained on, and his clothes were thoroughly soaked.

Not only did his fists feel heavy, but every part of his body felt as if it were weighed down by mountains. Even lifting an arm or taking a small step was exhausting, and every muscle ached with fatigue.

What move was I on? The fourth foundational punch, right?

The ‘Vajra Basic Fist’ has a total of eighteen moves! Am I really going to finish it in one go?

Sweat dripped down his eyelids, and Scholar Song blinked, letting the sweat trickle down his eyelashes.

……

……

I can do it! I definitely can!

Today, the Alchemical Sage was in a ‘good mood’ and agreed to guide me in cultivating the ‘True Self Meditation Sutra’ only after I completed an entire set of techniques. Who knows if his mood will remain pleasant in the following days?

If I fail to finish the ‘Vajra Basic Fist’ today, I might forever miss the chance to get guidance from the Alchemical Sage.

I have to keep pushing!

From the moment he sat at his computer and typed out his first message in the Ninefold Land One group, he had made up his mind!

Even the threat of ‘death’ did not frighten him. How could he compromise and give up to mere exhaustion and heaviness? If he couldn’t overcome this small hurdle, what was the point of pursuing cultivation?

He might as well quit the Ninefold Land One group and live as an ordinary mortal!

Scholar Song gritted his teeth and continued reciting the Martial Arts Sutra. With his left hand supporting his palm, he launched a piercing punch with his right—a foundational punch, the fifth!

As he threw this punch, he felt the bones in his body creaking under the strain. The fifth foundational punch not only trained the muscles but also affected the internal structure of his body.

“Ha!” He exhaled a breath of air.

Even in the heat of summer, the breath he released turned into visible vapor.

The warm blood energy inside him thickened further, accumulating gradually, just waiting to overflow.

At the same time, the residual energy from the Body Tempering Liquid in his lower abdomen was finally depleted after this punch.

Without the support and rejuvenation from the Body Tempering Liquid, the next round of practice became increasingly difficult, and his fatigue multiplied tenfold, even dozens of times...
