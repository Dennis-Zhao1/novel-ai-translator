**Can’t I Just Enjoy My Meal in Peace?**

For some inexplicable reason, upon hearing Scholar Song's words, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain felt a strange sense of emotion welling up inside him. Reflecting on Venerable White's personality... it didn't seem entirely impossible that he might just plunge into the cosmos.

"I understand now. I will prepare everything you need," the Immortal Sage assured him.

Before hanging up, he added with a note of caution, "Oh, and make sure not to let Dou Dou board the plane with you. It keeps insisting it wants to learn how to drive. If it gets on that plane, who knows what might happen? We absolutely cannot give it the chance to mess with an aircraft!"

"Senior Huangshan, you're overthinking it," Scholar Song sighed. "Even Dou Dou doesn’t want to accompany me and Venerable White to learn how to fly. So you can rest easy."

Previously, Dou Dou had only given him a strand of dog fur for protection; even Dou Dou knew that learning to fly with Venerable White might lead to some chaotic situations.

"Is that so? If that's the case, then that's fantastic." The Immortal Sage responded, pondering whether Dou Dou had genuinely turned over a new leaf.

In his memory, Dou Dou was the kind that thrived on chaos; it would never pass up an opportunity to stir things up, especially something as thrilling as learning to fly. Had it really been influenced by Scholar Song and decided to stop causing trouble? If that were true, it would be wonderful indeed.

When he first took in Dou Dou, it was because he found the Pekingese adorable, gentle, and far less hyperactive than a husky. But somewhere along the way, Dou Dou had transformed into a little troublemaker. What on earth had happened during that time? The Immortal Sage couldn't quite wrap his head around it.

...

Just then, while the Immortal Sage was deep in thought, a melodious sound echoed from outside his cave. It was the sound of fellow cultivators visiting, triggering the cave's barrier, akin to a doorbell.

The Immortal Sage activated a mirror, which lit up like a computer screen, revealing the scene at the entrance of his cave.

There stood a beautiful fairy, smiling warmly. It seemed that she sensed the Immortal Sage was watching her, as she waved her hand cheerfully, "Senior Huangshan, I’ve come to visit you!"

"Ah, it’s Lychee! What brings you here today?" The Immortal Sage chuckled as he dispelled the barrier.

The Lychee Fairy smiled sweetly, her expression disarmingly innocent...

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile, after finishing his conversation with the Immortal Sage, Scholar Song returned to browsing the internet, searching for tips on "how to protect oneself during a plane crash" and "how to use a parachute," among other beginner’s guides to flying.

Despite having Venerable White's flying sword and Dou Dou's protective fur, it was always best to be prepared. Opportunities favor those who are ready!

Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to maintain a cheerful smile as he headed downstairs for a meal.

Since he had forgotten to bring back the 'Skythief Candy' from the 'Five Finger Mountain Sealing Forbidden Zone' last time he returned home, the quality of his meals had plummeted.

Breakfast was an assortment brought back by Venerable White: several bowls of soy milk, steamed buns, fried dough sticks, porridge, and pickled vegetables...

There was quite a variety.

As for why Venerable White had thought to buy breakfast, Scholar Song turned his head to look at him.

At that moment, Venerable White, engrossed in his tablet, seemed to sense Scholar Song's gaze and looked up, his cheeks puffed out like a chipmunk: "Munch munch munch..."

Several boxes of bayberries were stacked next to Venerable White, indicating that he had picked them up while out. 

But hadn’t he tired of bayberries by now? It had to be said, cultivators had incredible bodies. A normal person would be left with aching teeth after eating so many bayberries, yet Venerable White was still enjoying them with glee.

Scholar Song settled down, reaching for a slice of white bread. "Senior, has Guoguo come out for breakfast yet?"

"Still in the bathroom, it’s been a while," Venerable White replied.

A while? It seemed like his hemorrhoids were quite severe. No wonder he couldn't resist the urge to go for a surgery.

"Guoguo, just a reminder, make sure to wipe your bottom clean, or it might worsen your hemorrhoids," Scholar Song casually mentioned.

Sitting for long periods can lead to hemorrhoids, and not wiping properly can also contribute—these were basic bits of knowledge.

"Ah? Does that really worsen hemorrhoids?" came a startled voice from the bathroom.

"It does, so hygiene is important," Scholar Song said as he grabbed a fried dough stick, wrapping it around the slice of bread before taking a big bite. This was his favorite way to eat.

Then, he turned on the TV in the living room, flipping through channels to see what news was on.

After changing channels several times, he paused when he reached a news segment about the Jiangnan region.

What flashed on the screen was a talk show.

On the left was a middle-aged man wearing glasses, exuding a vibe of "I am an expert." On the right was a beautiful female host dressed in sexy black stockings, engaged in a Q&A with the expert.

"Professor Liu, as a leading authority in geology, we have a question that has been troubling many residents in the Jiangnan region," the female host smiled. "It concerns the massive ground subsidence that suddenly occurred near the electronics market on July 1st. What was the cause of this?"

Scholar Song froze mid-bite, realizing that the incident the host was referring to was undoubtedly the result of Venerable White’s mishap—the huge pit created by his stumble.

There was a lot of discussion online about that hole.

Some people were shouting at the top of their lungs: "This is definitely not an ordinary ground subsidence! It’s never been so perfectly round, expanding outwards from a central point! Compared to a subsidence, this looks more like a meteorite crater!"

But if it was a meteorite crater, how could that be? In broad daylight, no one had seen any meteorites fall, nor were there any signs of flames or burning from a meteorite impact.

In short, this incident had sparked endless discussions among the residents of Jiangnan, with opinions all over the place.

"Without a doubt, this is ground subsidence!" Professor Liu asserted confidently.

He then elaborated, going on to discuss the causes of ground subsidence, such as excessive underground mining, over-extraction of groundwater, and so forth, his explanations flowing like a river.

As the topic dragged on, it unintentionally morphed into a lecture on 'ground subsidence,' then into a critique of the evils of capitalists exploiting underground resources, and finally into a discussion on environmental protection and everyone's responsibility.

While the professor was passionately speaking, the audience was left bewildered.

At that moment, the female host was thinking: What on earth is this? Can we get back on track here and summarize this in twenty words or less?

But she couldn’t voice her frustrations, forced to maintain a façade of agreement with Professor Liu, nodding along from time to time. Being a host could be tough too.

"Alright then, let’s just call it ground subsidence," Scholar Song sighed inwardly, a sentiment shared by many residents in Jiangnan.

Professor Liu had won this round!

At that moment, Venerable White glanced up at the TV and chuckled, "Oh, isn’t that the pit I accidentally made?"

"No, Senior! That's ground subsidence!" Scholar Song turned to him earnestly. "This is the result of the evil capitalists continuously exploiting underground resources, leading to this ground sinking. As for why it resembles a meteorite crater, Professor Liu will surely explain that!"

"Oh, I see," Venerable White nodded. "So in the future, if I accidentally create a pit, I won’t need the 'Earth Leveling Spell' anymore?"

"Exactly, Senior!" Scholar Song gave him a thumbs up. "That's right!"

Then he resumed munching on his fried dough stick wrapped in bread, enjoying the moment.

Experts can be quite handy sometimes...

He took another hearty bite of his makeshift meal.

At that moment...

The bathroom door swung open.

Little monk Guoguo emerged with a serious expression, then quickly dashed over to Scholar Song, naked as the day he was born.

Scholar Song was puzzled—what was this little one up to?

Guoguo ran up to him, turned around, and raised his little bottom, asking, "Brother Shuohang, can you check if I wiped properly?"

Scholar Song turned his head just in time to see Guoguo's little behind, and the sight made him freeze in shock: "..."

He was completely flabbergasted!

Could he not enjoy his meal in peace anymore?

Looking down, he noticed the golden fried dough stick in his hand, which now looked like a massive stick. Well, there went his appetite.

"Brother Shuohang?" The little monk turned to him, confused.

"You're all clean," Scholar Song forced a chuckle. "Now go wash your hands and let’s eat."

"Okay!" Guoguo quickly pulled up his pants and dashed back to the bathroom.

Scholar Song tossed the fried dough stick aside and quietly nibbled on the slice of bread. Without the fried dough stick, the bread was merely sweet and quite hard to swallow.

Before long, little monk Guoguo returned: "Brother Shuohang, what’s for breakfast?"

"We have soy milk, fried dough sticks, bread, porridge, and pickles. You can choose," Scholar Song gestured toward the table.

"Huh? Is that all? Aren't we having 'Spirit Rice Balls' or 'Nectar Liquid'?" Guoguo asked, looking up at Scholar Song in confusion.

Spirit Rice Balls, Nectar Liquid?

These sounded like delicacies meant for elite disciples of a sect. Where was a little loose cultivator like him supposed to find those? Scholar Song sighed deeply, "I don’t have those."

As he spoke, he turned to look at Venerable White.

Venerable White just kept munching: "Munch munch munch..."

Then Venerable White explained, "Well, Spirit Rice is rice grown with magical techniques, infused with spiritual energy. Nectar Liquid is the juice of a spiritual plant, and cultivators in the Body Refinement Stage consume these spiritual grains to enhance their vitality and accelerate their cultivation speed. Whenever you have time, I’ll take you to plant some. I used to do it, and I miss it."

"Thank you, Senior!" Scholar Song smiled.

Guoguo seemed to understand Scholar Song’s awkwardness. He clasped his hands together and chanted a Buddhist saying, "It’s alright, Brother Shuohang. Even if it’s just ordinary breakfast, I won’t mind."

After a moment, he asked, "Brother Shuohang, is this fried dough stick fried in vegetable oil or animal fat?"

Scholar Song’s heart broke: "I have no idea."

"Oh, then I can’t eat it. I can’t break my precepts," Guoguo said, grabbing a slice of bread and imitating Scholar Song as he quietly munched away.

Scholar Song felt inexplicably melancholic...
