**Chapter 1: The Mysterious Tower**

After exchanging a passionate handshake with Scholar Song, the old man dressed in ancient garb floated away, leaving Scholar Song bewildered in the wind.

Tupo, noticing the rigid expression on Scholar Song's face, asked curiously, "What did the old man say to you at the end?"

"Nothing much, just wished us to have fun on the island," Scholar Song replied.

"That's it?" Tupo was even more puzzled. "Then why do you look like you've lost your virginity?"

"..." Scholar Song gave Tupo a firm pat on the shoulder. "Tupo, you really need to pay attention in language class next time. Your metaphor was completely inappropriate."

Tupo: "..."

At that moment, a voice called out, "Speaking of which, Scholar Song, do you think what that old man said was reliable? Can we really leave this island by trading in the tower of the ancient city?"

Even though Gao had never encountered anything like the supernatural events they were experiencing now, he couldn’t shake the feeling that leaving was not going to be that simple, as depicted in movies or games.

Scholar Song smiled and said, "Whether it's true or not, we'll find out if we go take a look."

They were definitely going to leave this strange island... so no matter whether the old man’s words were true or false, they had to try their luck at the tower.

The group nodded silently, their gazes shifting toward the towering structure in the ancient city.

At that moment, a female office worker asked, "What do you think the people in that tower will want from us for a trade? Do we even have anything suitable for trading?"

After the plane crash, they barely managed to crawl out of the wreckage, and they had immediately encountered a bizarre group of apes. Most of their belongings were still on the plane, leaving them with little to offer.

As soon as she finished speaking, many passengers’ faces changed!

The flight attendant quickly patted herself down, pulling out a business card, shopping card, handkerchief, phone, and a few keys—just a hodgepodge of items.

She looked as if she might cry. "Will they even take these things in the trading area of the tower?"

Not just her, but many passengers also revealed similar expressions of despair after patting themselves down—clearly, their belongings weren't any better than the flight attendant's.

The mysterious tower didn’t seem like a place that would take junk; could these items even be used for trade?

A female passenger weakly suggested, "What if we go back to the plane and bring our things back?"

"How are we supposed to go back? Don’t forget there’s a giant eagle in the sky and large lizards in the jungle," said the guy who had danced in front of the apes earlier, chuckling bitterly. "And let’s not forget those strange gorillas. They seemed quite intelligent; the things on our plane might already belong to them."

The thought of those gorillas made everyone sigh heavily.

"Stop overthinking it. Let’s eat something to regain our strength, and then we’ll check out that tower. Who knows, maybe the trading area has exactly what we need?" Scholar Song said calmly.

In fact, ever since entering the ancient city, Scholar Song had been pondering… why had this mysterious island, or rather, the ‘Heavenly Realm Island,’ brought so many ordinary passengers here?

At first, he suspected it might be because of him; perhaps the Heavenly Realm Island wanted to draw him in, and these passengers were just innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire. It wasn’t arrogance; after all, he was the only cultivator on the plane. If the island had a target, it would likely be him!

But then he realized that didn’t add up.

If the Heavenly Realm Island just wanted him, it could have easily brought him alone onto the island during the flight.

Even if that wasn’t possible, the island could have just made all the passengers disappear, leaving Scholar Song alone on the plane! This was something the island could definitely do!

So, was there some special purpose behind the selection of these passengers to bring them to the Heavenly Realm Island?

If so, what could that special purpose be?

At that moment, hearing the old man mention the trading area in the tower sparked something in his heart.

Could it be that the remaining passengers carried something that the ‘Heavenly Realm Island’ found interesting?

"But we don’t have anything valuable on us," the flight attendant remarked, looking at the assorted items in her hands. She couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to trade for these.

"Don’t panic. Let’s just take a look at the tower first. Maybe we have some hidden treasures we don’t even know about," Scholar Song reassured them.

The passengers fell silent, quietly regaining their strength.

Soon, some of the passengers started glancing at Scholar Song—his display of strength when he defeated the giant eagle had left a deep impression, making them eager to learn a thing or two from him.

Like Joseph, they wished they could pick up a trick or two from Scholar Song.

However, unlike Joseph, they didn’t have the same boldness to approach him right away, unsure of how to strike up a conversation.

No worries, though; they knew they would have plenty of opportunities to connect with Scholar Song once they escaped the island.

Many passengers had this thought in mind.

Meanwhile, Gao and Tupo, who were closer to Scholar Song, didn’t want to put him on the spot at that moment. After all, they’d have plenty of time to get to know him in the future.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

About ten minutes later, the old man in ancient clothing reappeared.

He was now wearing a chef’s apron, wielding two large cleavers, and was covered in blood, sporting a terrifying smile on his face.

When a few female passengers saw the old man’s appearance, they immediately recalled various horror movie scenes and screamed in fright.

The ancient-clothed old man, however, remained unfazed, still wearing that eerie smile, and spoke like an NPC, "Esteemed heroes, the three flat-haired beasts have been dealt with. I’ll have them sent up shortly. Please enjoy!"

As he spoke, five burly men appeared behind him, each carrying large pots of delicious-looking meat soup that made everyone’s mouths water just from the aroma.

Seeing this, the passengers behind him finally relaxed a little, though they still watched the old man warily.

Scholar Song’s mouth twitched—this old man was clearly doing it on purpose for his own amusement. He was sure the old man was enjoying the panic on the passengers' faces.

The five strong men set down the large pots and filled bowls to the brim with meat soup for the hungry passengers.

The passengers, already exhausted and starving, found the soup incredibly enticing and began gulping it down without even considering if there might be any issues with it...

Scholar Song intended to warn Tupo and Gao, but before he could say anything, Tupo and the others had already started drinking the meat soup with great enthusiasm.

Scholar Song sighed, taking a bowl of meat soup and looking at the old man. "Old man, you should have some too."

The old man grinned widely and then gritted his teeth, saying, "Unfortunately, I only eat vegetarian! No meat for me!"

So he was a vegetarian, but why did he have to say it through gritted teeth?

Scholar Song smiled and gently set the bowl of soup aside.

"Don’t worry, the meat soup is perfectly safe. It’s my compensation for you all," the old man said in a lowered voice.

"I still can’t eat it," Scholar Song replied honestly. Until he knew more about the old man, he wasn’t about to eat anything he provided.

"Well, if that’s how it is, I’ll just keep the soup for you. Let me know when you want to eat it," the old man seemed to have anticipated that Scholar Song would refuse, so he simply took the bowl of soup back.

After waiting for the passengers to finish their soup, the old man smiled and said, "Are you heroes done resting? Then let’s head to the ancient city tower for the trade!"

The passengers patted their bellies, feeling an unprecedented sense of fullness after consuming what was supposed to be just a regular bowl of soup.

Moreover, they felt a surge of strength coursing through them, as if they could run a marathon without breaking a sweat!

What a magical soup it was.

…

…

Following the official road of the ancient city, under the guidance of the old man in ancient attire, they entered the inner city and finally arrived at the foot of the tower.

Along the way… the number of residents in the ancient city made the passengers feel a bit strange. There were simply too few people; even in the inner city, it was sparsely populated, making the enormous ancient city feel almost like a ghost town, with only the occasional shadow flitting by.

This stark contrast left the passengers, who were used to the bustling cities of China, feeling quite uncomfortable.

Soon, they reached the base of the tower.

The old man tucked his hands into his sleeves and said, "I can only bring you this far. You’ll enter the tower through the entrance, and someone will be there to welcome you."

"If all goes well, once the trade is completed, you should be able to obtain a way to leave this place."

"Finally, I wish you all success in obtaining the items you desire." The old man smiled.

"Thank you for your kind wishes," Scholar Song replied.

Then, he led Gao and the others into the ancient tower.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

As soon as they stepped into the tower, the group suddenly felt a weightless sensation, reminiscent of an elevator descending.

A moment later, the scene before them transformed into a vast hall filled with gemstones!

Every item in the hall was made of various gems and diamonds. Even the tables were constructed from countless gems piled together. Some cup-like objects were hollowed out of enormous gemstones.

An overwhelming aura of wealth and luxury washed over them.

When the flight attendant saw the scene, she bitterly touched the items she was holding. Not to mention her belongings, selling her entire self wouldn’t even be enough to buy the smallest diamond in the hall—here, even the smallest diamonds were the size of a fist.

How could they trade happily here? What could she possibly offer?

This sentiment was shared by many passengers, who felt a wave of helplessness wash over them.

"Welcome to the Starry Sky House! Here, we adhere to the absolute principle of ‘equivalent exchange,’ ensuring our customers can buy with confidence and sell with peace of mind!" A clear voice echoed from all corners of the gemstone hall. "At the Starry Sky House, we guarantee honesty and authenticity—refunds available, and if it’s fake, we’ll pay you tenfold!"

Scholar Song "…"

That kind of cliché advertising slogan made the prestige of the ‘Starry Sky House’ plummet drastically.

"Next, please take a moment to relax, and a trading interface will appear before you. According to the principle of equivalent exchange, we will show you the items you can trade and the items we have for trade. It’s guaranteed to be equal and fair!" the cheerful voice continued.

Upon hearing this, everyone took a deep breath and tried to relax their minds.

Suddenly, trading windows made of light appeared before their eyes—these screens were only visible to them.

At that moment, the flight attendant suddenly exclaimed, "Wait, wait, wait? You only want my pendant?"

She looked down at her chest, realizing the pendant was just a small wooden carving of a fish she had bought for thirty bucks at an antique shop. She had no idea what it was; she only thought it looked cute at the time.

To her surprise, the ‘Starry Sky House’ wanted to trade for her little fish carving.

Could it be that this little fish carving was a treasure?

Curious, she glanced at the items the ‘Starry Sky House’ was offering in exchange.

[Youthful Beauty Pill: Want to maintain a youthful appearance like a twenty-year-old when you’re fifty? Want to still look thirty when you’re seventy? Don’t think too hard; one Youthful Beauty Pill greatly delays the aging of your appearance. You deserve it!]

If anyone had pushed a ‘Youthful Beauty Pill’ on her before, she would have cursed at them for being a scammer. But given everything that had happened that day, she couldn’t help but believe it now.

Then she looked at another item being offered for trade.

[Disaster Expulsion Talisman: Wearing this talisman can save you from a life-threatening crisis.]

This remark seemed to carry more weight.

There were only these two items for trade, and after some thought, the flight attendant decisively chose the ‘Youthful Beauty Pill.’

For her, the chance to save her life was less appealing than the allure of beauty... youth and beauty were indeed more precious.

"Congratulations, you have successfully traded an item at the ‘Starry Sky House.’ Would you like to leave Heavenly Realm Island immediately or wait for 24 hours before returning?" the voice in the gemstone hall announced.

At the same time, the flight attendant found a fragrant, shimmering pill in the palm of her hand.

She turned to look in Scholar Song’s direction, seemingly seeking his opinion.

Scholar Song thought for a moment and replied, "Given the numerous dangers on this Heavenly Realm Island, I recommend everyone leave as soon as possible. After all, I can only be in one place at a time. If we encounter another crisis like the giant eagle, I can't guarantee I can protect everyone."

At the thought of the giant eagle disaster at the city gate, everyone’s expressions changed.

"In that case, Scholar Song, we’ll meet in reality," the flight attendant nodded vigorously. She swallowed the fragrant pill and then chose to leave ‘Heavenly Realm Island’ immediately.

Scholar Song nodded slightly.

But would they really meet again? By the time they crossed paths again, she might not even remember what had happened on this island.

Erasing memories was not a difficult task for powerful cultivators.

And from the experience of Venerable Jiu Zhou, it was evident that memories of the Heavenly Realm Island would not be retained...

Once they left the Heavenly Realm Island, the flight attendant and Scholar Song would be in a state of ‘meeting but not recognizing’ each other.

…

…

At that moment, the flight attendant chose to return immediately.

Then, flames of light erupted around her—this was the same light they had seen when the group had dissolved into particles of light at the airplane door.

The flight attendant panicked.

The voice in the Starry Sky House explained, "Don’t be alarmed; this is just how we send you back. It won’t cause you any harm. Once you recover, you’ll find yourself back in the warmth of your home."

Hearing this explanation, the passengers recalled the ‘Yes (Y), No (N)’ options at the entrance… so that choice was indeed about sending them back home warmly and lovingly.

Joseph felt a wave of relief wash over him—so, his daughter had also been sent home during the incident on the plane?

Several others shared Joseph’s relief, as they also had loved ones or friends who had vanished during the flight.

With the flight attendant going first, other passengers began to trade.

The items being exchanged were diverse, exceeding everyone’s imagination.

Some exchanged their leather jackets...

Others traded their engagement rings...

Interestingly enough, the guy who had danced in front of the apes traded away a birthmark he had had since childhood… and in return, he received a thick solid gold chain, the kind you might use as a dog collar. He had long wanted to get rid of that birthmark, and now not only did he save on surgery costs, but he also got a big fat gold chain—a huge profit!

Meanwhile, Tupo was left in shock as he looked at his trading options.

What he had to trade was—an entire syringe of his blood.

And the only thing he could receive in return was a pot of meat soup, the same kind everyone had been given by the old man earlier, and that was his only option.

"Blood? Meat soup?" Tupo was puzzled.

However, he didn’t immediately click to agree; instead, he exchanged glances with Gao before turning back to Scholar Song.

Seeing the worried expressions on his friends’ faces, Scholar Song smiled and said, "You two don’t need to hesitate. Just complete the trade and leave Heavenly Realm Island."

"And what about you?" Gao asked, sensing that Scholar Song wasn’t planning to return with them.

"Don’t forget about Zhuge Zhongjie and Zhuge Yue," Scholar Song replied with a smile. "I need to find them first before I leave."

"Make sure to come back quickly," Tupo urged.

Scholar Song nodded with a smile.

Taking a deep breath, Tupo pressed the trade button. Soon, a pot of delicious meat soup appeared in his hands... and then, his form ignited with flames, and he vanished.

Gao, Mei, and the Lu sisters followed suit, clicking their trades and disappearing with Tupo.

In the end, only Joseph and Scholar Song remained in the ‘Starry Sky House.’

"I’ll go with you, Master!" Joseph exclaimed excitedly, determined to follow his master and witness his great feats.

"You should go back first," Scholar Song chuckled. "Otherwise... we won’t be able to enjoy being neighbors later."

Upon hearing this, Joseph sighed. He wasn’t sure what he had traded, and then he too vanished into particles of light.

Ultimately, Scholar Song was left as the solitary figure in the Starry Sky House.

…

…

Scholar Song let out a heavy sigh, and then, out of nowhere, he raised his middle finger at the gemstone hall of the Starry Sky House.

Afterward, he casually shoved his hands into his pockets and left the ‘Starry Sky House’ without hesitation.

As he exited the gemstone hall, he felt that familiar sensation of an elevator moving up and down.

In the next moment, Scholar Song found himself at the entrance of the tower.

"Hey, Scholar Song! Why didn’t you trade anything but just come out?" The old man in ancient attire looked at Scholar Song with no surprise, smiling broadly.

"Why ask questions you already know the answers to?" Scholar Song raised an eyebrow. "The Starry Sky House clearly had no intention of sending me back, did it?"

Just a moment ago in the gemstone hall, everyone had received a trading window, but Scholar Song hadn’t seen any such window pop up for him—even though he had many treasures on him.

If no one was pulling strings behind the scenes, who would believe that?

"Hehehehe." The old man chuckled delightfully, pulling out the bowl of meat soup again. "Want some?"

Scholar Song stepped closer to the soup, gritting his teeth. "Let’s cut to the chase. Who are you really, and what do you want from me?"

"If I told you... that the problem lies within this soup, would you believe me? You didn’t drink it, so you couldn’t trade with the ‘Starry Sky House.’ Do you believe it?" The old man laughed.

Scholar Song rolled his eyes.

"Drink it while it’s hot. Don’t worry; if I meant you any harm, I could have made you absorb this soup by other means," the old man said with a smile.

Scholar Song gritted his teeth, grabbed the bowl of soup, and took a hearty sip. "Now can you tell me who you are and what you want from me?"

"Ah, young man, that’s a good question!" The old man smiled slightly.

He then pointed at his head, and suddenly, the originally gray hair vanished, revealing a shiny bald head.

His once hunched back straightened, and his face quickly transformed. In an instant, he became a striking figure with sharp brows and bright eyes, hiding a delicate beauty beneath his heroic demeanor.

"Indeed, young man... you could say I’m the one who, three hundred years ago, had a little tête-à-tête with your Nine Lantern!" The bald figure before Scholar Song clasped his hands together, beaming at him.

"Pfft..." The meat soup in Scholar Song's mouth erupted out in a spray.
