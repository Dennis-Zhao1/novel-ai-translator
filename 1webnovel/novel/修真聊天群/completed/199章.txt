**The Embarrassing Ultimate Move**

The sword came too fast; Scholar Song had only one option—“Eye Prowess, Master’s Vision.”

In an instant, he activated his Eye Prowess.

Suddenly, the entire world seemed to slow down. He could clearly see the trajectory of the lightning-fast, pitch-black flying sword!

However, the vital energy and mental strength within Scholar Song's heart and eyes were rapidly depleting—this ‘Master’s Vision’ consumed far too much energy. At his current level, even in peak condition, he could only maintain this ‘Master’s Vision’ for a few breaths.

Seizing that fleeting moment, Scholar Song desperately activated his arm. With a flick of his wrist, he activated the ‘Flame Blade’ on his bronze ring.

Under the Master’s Vision, he saw that his wrist movement was as slow as a turtle… Fortunately, calculating the trajectory, he believed his blade could catch up!

Boom… The precious Flame Blade ignited, clashing against the pitch-black flying sword.

Thanks to Venerable White, Scholar Song had received training from the young man in the green robe in that desert world, where he mastered the basics of swordsmanship.

He unleashed the full power of this ‘Flame Blade.’

Blade and sword collided.

Then, flames erupted. The Flame Blade was cleaved apart by the pitch-black flying sword.

Scholar Song felt a numbness in his palms and a heaviness in his chest as he was sent flying backward.

Even with the Flame Blade activated, it was only a second-tier attack.

That flying sword was a furious strike from the leader of the Jingmo Sect, a full-force attack from a fourth-tier cultivator.

The full power of the Flame Blade merely delayed the attack of the pitch-black flying sword. After a brief pause, the sword, under the control of the Jingmo Sect leader, relentlessly slashed toward Scholar Song again.

In fact, if he hadn’t been wielding the Flame Blade at that moment, he might have already met his end.

After being struck head-on, Scholar Song's Master’s Vision faded. At the same time, the vital energy in his body was depleted, and his mental strength was utterly exhausted.

Just as the flying sword was about to strike him again, a small golden shield unexpectedly appeared in front of him.

It was the Phantom Spirit within his heart, sensing its master was in danger, gathering all its remaining vitality to manifest its innate ability, creating a small shield to protect Scholar Song.

Clang!

The sword clashed with the shield.

In the next moment, the shield shattered…

Yet, the strike of the pitch-black flying sword was finally blocked!

However, the residual sword energy from the flying sword swept over Scholar Song, sending him crashing against the mountainside.

Scholar Song slid down the stone wall, weakly sitting on the ground, gasping for breath, unable to move.

His body was drained of all vital energy, and even the energy stored by the Phantom Spirit had been consumed in the form of that golden shield. Coupled with the damage from the sword energy, he couldn’t even move a finger now.

In the sky, the leader of the Jingmo Sect did not strike again. The golden lightning in his eyes gradually receded, and the pain of losing his friend was forcibly suppressed.

He descended from the sky, looking down at Scholar Song: “You little brat, I intended to finish you off with one strike. However, I can give you a chance—hand over the Blood God Drill, and I might spare your life!”

Killing this kid so easily would be too cheap. After murdering his only friend, he had to capture this brat and bring him back to the Wuji Demon Sect, making him experience thousands of tortures worse than death!

The Wuji Demon Sect specialized in such torment.

“Hehe.” Scholar Song chuckled lightly, showing no fear.

Because he still had one last resort.

He never expected to resort to this move in the end. To be honest, if he had even a sliver of vitality or mental strength left in his body, he wouldn’t want to use this move.

Because it was simply too embarrassing. Just thinking of the way to use this ultimate move filled him with a sense of maliciousness from the world.

Yet, when faced with death… he felt that no matter how embarrassing the ultimate move was, he had to use it.

“Moon Prism Power… Transform!” Scholar Song gritted his teeth and shouted.

As he uttered this incantation, he had mentally cursed the name ‘Doudou’ dozens of times!

“?” The leader of the Jingmo Sect immediately became alert—transformations like this weren’t uncommon among cultivators.

Many cultivators possessed ancient bloodlines or beast bloodlines, which could be activated in life-or-death situations to unleash terrifying combat power.

However… Moon Prism Power Transform? What ancient bloodline was that? He had never heard of it!

In that moment of distraction, Scholar Song’s wrist projected a ‘3D Calabash Boy’ image. This projection enveloped Scholar Song and, with a pop, transformed into a burst of light particles, whisking him skyward in a rapid escape…

Though it sounded lengthy, in reality, from the moment Scholar Song recited the incantation to his swift escape was merely an instant!

Damn it, what kind of transformation was this? It was an escaping spell!

As Scholar Song was whisked away by the light particles, he thought, “So, this is the ‘Ten Thousand Li Escape Technique’? This speed is incredible!”

At that moment, he was flying southeast—if all went well, he would eventually reach Venerable White's side.

After a brief moment of surprise, the leader of the Jingmo Sect yelled furiously, “Damn it, trying to escape from me? You must be dreaming!”

He stepped onto his flying sword, pushing its speed to the limit.

While flying, he transformed into a bolt of lightning, chasing after Scholar Song.

The leader of the Jingmo Sect practiced lightning techniques, making his fleeing speed among the best of cultivators of the same tier. Now, with his secret technique accelerating him, he was nearly reaching the speed of a fifth-tier cultivator!

He would definitely catch up to that brat.

The distance for an escaping technique must be limited. This time, if he caught up to him, he would simply chop him down. At most, it would take a bit more effort to extract his soul and retrieve the memories of the ‘Blood God Drill’!

Although extracting memories from a soul required a hefty amount of spirit stones, if it led to a Blood God Drill, it would be worth it.

Damn it! If he had known, he would have just chopped this brat down without any more idle chatter!

The leader of the Jingmo Sect regretted it deeply.

As he thought about this, he urged himself even more, vowing to sever Scholar Song’s head… to make up for his regrets.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile.

Near Jiangnan University Town.

Doudou lay atop a seven-seater van, gazing out the window at the scenery, letting out a soft sigh.

He never expected that the dog hair he gifted to Scholar Song would actually be activated… Scholar Song was facing a formidable enemy.

However, he wasn’t worried about Scholar Song’s safety—because if Scholar Song truly faced death, the ‘Ten Thousand Li Escape Technique’ mark on his arm would automatically activate, safely transporting him to Venerable White.

Yes, aside from shouting “Moon Prism Power, Transform!” it also had a ‘Low Health Automatic Return’ function. After all, it was something Venerable White had left for Scholar Song to ensure his safety, considering various scenarios.

Hmm… it seemed he had forgotten to mention this detail to Scholar Song?

But it didn’t matter; whether he said it or not, it wouldn’t change the fact that he wouldn’t die. Doudou thought to himself.

If Scholar Song knew that Doudou had concealed such an important function of the ‘Ten Thousand Li Escape Technique’, he would definitely turn into a mad dog, making Doudou realize what it meant to be a ‘mad dog patient with sharp teeth’!

“Hmm, whatever. I should focus on my own business now.” Doudou turned to look around, spotting rows of dog cages, each containing a trembling little dog.

There were pet dogs, stray dogs, native dogs, and even precious purebreds, all sorts of breeds. These dogs were now soft and limp in their cages, lacking even the strength to bark, clearly drugged.

—Doudou had been captured by a ‘dog theft gang’! He was then stuffed into a van, prepared to be sent to a location for processing and sold to various dog meat hotpot restaurants.

The driver was a big fat man, who, while driving, laughed triumphantly, “Tsk tsk, Jiangnan is really a good place; there are many dog owners, and their vigilance is far from enough. Just a casual stroll, and we’ve caught so many dogs! At two hundred a piece, that’s several thousand in this van.”

“However, it’s about time we change locations; the police here are starting to move.” The burly man in the passenger seat said with a sly grin.

“What’s there to fear? We’ve come to Jiangnan several times; when have the police ever caught us?” The fat man replied, puffed up with pride.

“Constantly walking by the river, it’s better to be cautious, so you don’t get your feet wet.” The burly man said in a low voice.

The Jiangnan police were not to be underestimated. While their gang had never been caught, it was only due to their rich experience and varied methods. Many other dog theft gangs had fallen into the hands of the Jiangnan police.

While they were speaking, the fat man drove the van to an abandoned factory.

This place used to be a large ironworks but closed down for some unknown reason. Now, it had become a transfer station for the fat man’s dog theft gang.

“Alright, we’re here.” The fat man parked the van skillfully and opened the back doors.

The small pet dogs in their cages trembled with their tails tucked between their legs, anxiously looking at the unfamiliar environment and the people.

The burly man jumped out of the van and shouted, “Qizi, Tianji, come help us move these dogs inside. We’re processing these dogs today, and we’ll leave Jiangnan tomorrow.”

Soon, two strong men rushed out from the abandoned factory, ready to lend a hand in moving the dogs from the van.

Just then, suddenly, a muffled voice came from inside the van: “Oh, so this is your lair? Honestly, sitting in the car has made my butt hurt!”

“Who?” The burly man was startled, his hair standing on end. After all, they were engaging in illegal activities; if discovered, they would face prison time, and that was no joke.

Bang!

At that moment, a loud noise of a cage being smashed came from the van.

Subsequently, a small Pekingese casually walked out of the van.

It stood at the van's doorway, propping itself up on the door frame, looking down at all the humans present with its ridiculous eyes: “Four people outside, seven more inside the van; is this all the members of your gang?”

The little Pekingese opened its mouth, speaking human language.
