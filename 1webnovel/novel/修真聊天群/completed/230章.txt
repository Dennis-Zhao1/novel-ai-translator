Chapter 1: Unexpected Encounters

"Master Cao, someone is looking for you." 

The little monk's surgery went surprisingly well; his hemorrhoids weren't nearly as severe as he had feared. 

The doctor administered two injections at the area in question before employing a specialized treatment device. This device was gently inserted, and the procedure commenced. 

In less than twenty minutes, the treatment was complete—there was no need for minimally invasive surgery at all. 

There were no incisions, no blood loss, and in just twenty minutes, the little monk's hemorrhoids were practically healed. However, he had to maintain a position with his legs apart, waiting for the effects of the medication to wear off. 

"All done, little guy! You’ll need to come back for two more treatments in the next couple of days. In three days, your hemorrhoids will be completely healed," said the doctor, a kind-looking woman who couldn’t help but feel a rush of maternal affection seeing the little monk's chubby cheeks. 

"Ah, three times?" The little monk was taken aback. After a moment, he cautiously asked, "May I ask how much that costs?" 

With a smile that crinkled her eyes, the doctor replied, "Four hundred for each session, so it’ll be twelve hundred for all three." 

"Ahhh?!" The little monk breathed a sigh of relief, joy shining in his eyes. That was much cheaper than he had anticipated. 

The doctor gently removed her medical gloves and playfully pinched the little monk's cheek. "Just hold that position and don’t move around. You can get up in five minutes." 

"Thank you, kind lady!" The little monk pressed his palms together in a gesture of gratitude. 

The doctor chuckled, teasingly pinched his little nose, and then moved on to treat another patient. 

Five minutes later, the little monk emerged from the treatment room. He reached down and gingerly touched the area—oh wow, it felt so much better now; there was no pain at all! 

With his hemorrhoid troubles behind him, he felt ready to face whatever his master had in store for him, no matter how secluded the place might be! 

...

As he took a few steps, three police officers approached him, led by a nurse. 

"Here he is," the nurse pointed at the little monk. "This little one is likely a child who’s been abducted." 

The trio of police officers halted and scrutinized the little monk from head to toe. 

The little monk blinked his eyes, pressed his palms together, and bowed politely to the officers and the nurse. "Hello, kind sirs! Are you looking for the little monk?" 

"Hello, young master," one of the older officers squatted down beside him, trying to soften his tone so as not to frighten the child. "You mentioned earlier that you were bought for four thousand from a certain uncle?" 

"Yes, that's right." The little monk nodded affirmatively. 

The older officer continued, "Do you know the uncle's name? Where can we find him now?" 

"The uncle's surname is Cao, and his name is De Lian. Before I went into the operating room, he said he had to step out for a few cigarettes because his cravings kicked in," the little monk recounted earnestly. 

"Cao De Lian? Does anyone recognize that name?" the older officer turned to his colleagues. 

The officer on the left shook his head. 

The officer on the right pulled out a device resembling a smartphone and began searching through it. This device stored various criminal records from the police department, especially detailed files on wanted fugitives. 

However, there was no record of a Cao De Lian in the electronic database. 

"Captain, there's no information on Cao De Lian," the officer on the right reported, shaking his head as well. 

"Young master, do you know what this Cao De Lian does? Can you lead us to him now?" The older officer pressed on, looking intently at the little monk. 

"Of course! He's a human trafficker," the little monk answered honestly. 

"Are you sure? Young master, this is not a matter to joke about," the older officer confirmed, his brow furrowing. 

"Absolutely! I put in a lot of effort to find him. He's quite a notorious trafficker in the Jiangnan area," the little monk exclaimed. "And then he paid four thousand to buy me!" 

"Can you take us to Cao De Lian?" the older officer asked gravely, understanding that they needed to confirm the little monk's claims in person. 

"Yes, if everything goes smoothly, he should be waiting for me at the hospital entrance," the little monk replied, nodding enthusiastically. "Follow me! By the way, do you kind sirs have business with Mr. Cao?" 

"We just need to ask him some questions," the older officer said, a slight twitch at the corner of his mouth. 

The officers couldn't shake the feeling that this little monk was involved in something far more complex than it appeared! 

...

Meanwhile, above them, Dou Dou, shrunk to the size of a fist, was using its invisibility to remain unseen by anyone. 

As long as Dou Dou wished to hide, the little monk Guo Guo would never be able to detect it. 

"This is getting more interesting—leading the police to meet Mr. Cao De Lian? I have a feeling their encounter will be quite amusing," Dou Dou muttered to itself. 

Just then, it pondered how to make that 'Cao De Lian' face some misfortune. Well, this seemed like a perfect opportunity! 

Dou Dou decided to act. 

It flew quietly to the side of the three officers, sweeping its tail across them, casting an illusion over them. 

In the next moment, the three officers' forms became concealed. 

The officers could see each other, and the little monk could see them, but to the other passersby, they could only see the little monk Guo Guo, unaware of the three officers standing right there. 

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Cao De Lian sat in his beat-up car, waiting for the little monk Guo Guo to emerge from the hospital. 

He had been keeping a close eye on the hospital entrance and hadn’t seen any officers enter—of course, there were multiple entrances, and the police could have come in from another direction. 

Therefore, he had to remain cautious. If he saw the little monk come out with anyone else or noticed any suspicious figures, he would immediately drive away! 

"By now, the surgery for those pesky hemorrhoids should be over," Cao De Lian thought to himself, glancing at his watch. 

Just as he was thinking this, he spotted the little monk emerging from the building. 

With that shiny bald head glowing under the night lights, he was hard to miss. The streetlights cast a bright reflection off the little monk's head, making him almost luminescent. 

Cao De Lian didn’t call out immediately; he remained hidden in his car, peering cautiously at the little monk's surroundings. 

Perfect. No one else was around. 

It seemed that nurse hadn't alerted the authorities after all. Perhaps he had overthought it. Nevertheless, it was always better to be safe than sorry. 

Confirming that there was only the little monk, Cao De Lian pressed the horn of his clunker, signaling to the boy that he was right there. 

"I found you!" the little monk exclaimed, a smile spreading across his face as he waved and jogged over. 

He opened the car door. 

"Mr. Cao, you really did wait for me at the hospital entrance," the little monk said cheerfully. 

"Yeah, I've been waiting half the day," Cao De Lian replied, extinguishing his cigarette. "Surgery’s done, huh? Let’s head back." 

"Yes, it’s done. But I’ll need to come back tomorrow and the day after for two more treatments to completely cure my hemorrhoids," the little monk explained, grinning. 

Cao De Lian stiffened at that moment—was this forcing him to sell the little monk off tonight? 

"By the way, Mr. Cao, these three kind sirs want to talk to you," the little monk said, pointing behind him. 

"Who?" Cao De Lian's heart raced as he stared past the little monk, searching for anyone—only to see nothing. 

"The three kind sirs are right in front of you," the little monk insisted, pointing to where the officers stood. 

Cao De Lian felt a chill run down his spine—what was going on? He couldn’t see anyone! 

At that moment, Dou Dou perched atop the car’s roof was having the time of its life. 

It lightly patted its paws, and without him noticing, it now held a key—the key to Cao De Lian's dilapidated car. 

Then, Dou Dou waved its tail, lifting the illusion it had cast on the officers. 

In Cao De Lian's eyes, the three officers suddenly appeared as if by magic, like living beings emerging from thin air. 

He was scared stiff! 

This was genuine terror! 

"Police!" Cao De Lian screamed, lunging for the ignition switch, desperate to start the car and flee. 

But as he reached out, he realized his car keys had somehow vanished... 

The three officers were equally perplexed. 

They had been standing in front of him for quite some time, yet he had acted like he was blind, not noticing them at all. And now he was screaming as if he had seen a ghost. 

However, seeing how startled he was by their sudden appearance confirmed their suspicions—this guy was definitely up to no good! 

"Human trafficker Cao De Lian, you're under arrest! Come with us!" the older officer declared sternly. 

After the initial shock, Cao De Lian quickly composed himself, realizing he had no choice but to go all in. "Officers, you must be mistaken! I, Cao De Lian, am a law-abiding citizen. How could I possibly be a human trafficker? Don’t slander a good person without evidence!" 

At this point, he couldn’t help but commend his own quick thinking! 

He had no criminal record, and even if he ended up in the station, as long as he denied everything, what could the police do to him? 

Meanwhile, the little monk looked puzzled. "Wait, Mr. Cao, you’re not a human trafficker? But you bought me, right?" 

"That was just a joke! I was just messing with you!" Cao De Lian said, trying to sound serious. 

"But you brought me all the way from Jiangnan to Wenzhou City," the little monk countered. 

"Uh..." Cao De Lian froze, his brain racing to find a plausible explanation. He had to come up with something fast; otherwise, he’d be in deep trouble! 

"Also, before I was looking for you, I gathered a lot of information about you. For instance, I got details about you selling many children from a man named 'Three Blades Liu,'" the little monk revealed, pulling out a thick stack of evidence from his clothing. 

"Don’t underestimate me, little monk! If I wasn’t sure you were a human trafficker, why would I have let you buy me?" the little monk said proudly... 

In an instant, the expressions on Cao De Lian’s face and those of the three officers turned into exaggerated looks of bewilderment!
