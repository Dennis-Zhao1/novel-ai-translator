**The Hidden Card of Master Jingmo**

When the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain sent this message, Scholar Song was riding on Venerable White's flying sword, making his way home.

The car had crashed, and Venerable White had dug a deep pit on the spot, burying the vehicle inside. He then used the 'Earth Leveling Spell' to cover the hole, restoring the ground to its original state, leaving no traces that it had ever been disturbed. He had used this Earth Leveling Spell countless times, so he was quite adept at it!

After that, Venerable White activated the blue flying sword, carrying Scholar Song on their journey home.

During the trip, Scholar Song pulled out his phone and entered the Ninefold Land No. 1 group, where he immediately saw the message from the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, urging him to learn to fly a plane.

All the hairs on Scholar Song's body stood up at once. He quickly turned around, using his body to shield his phone from Venerable White's sight.

What a joke! If Venerable White could speed in a car under the enhancement of spells, eventually leading to a crash off a cliff, what would happen if he learned to fly a plane? Wouldn't he fly straight into outer space?

By then, the ‘plane’ would really turn into ‘ash’!

No way, he absolutely could not let Venerable White have the chance to touch a plane. He needed to reject the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain first; after all, learning to fly was far too dangerous right now.

Scholar Song thought to himself, preparing to privately message the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain to refuse.

However, just then, an account named ‘Venerable Bai’ in the Ninefold Land No. 1 group sent a message: “Oh? Huangshan, you can directly arrange for someone to learn to fly? When will it be arranged? Let me and my little friend Scholar Song go together! I just learned to drive today, and it was really fun! I can only imagine that learning to fly will be even more interesting.”

Seeing this message made Scholar Song's heart race. He turned to look and found Venerable White was flying the sword while playing with his phone.

Is it really okay to mess with your phone while flying a sword? They don't allow phone use while driving a car!

Venerable White seemed to sense Scholar Song's gaze, looked up, and locked eyes with him. Then, as if he could read his mind, he laughed: “Haha, it's fine. I set the landing coordinates on the Alchemical Sage's building, and the flying sword will automatically take us there, just like an automatic car. I just need to pay a little attention and avoid colliding with anything in the air.”

Hearing Venerable White's words, Scholar Song felt relieved.

So, flying swords had ‘autopilot’ functions too? What modern folks thought was novel had already been thoroughly mastered by these cultivator seniors.

But suddenly, Scholar Song felt tense again—“Just pay a little attention and avoid colliding with anything in the air?”

With Venerable White's personality, what if he daydreamed and crashed into a plane or a UFO? That would be way too normal!

All he could do was pray, sincerely hoping such a disaster wouldn’t happen.

“By the way, Scholar Song, Huangshan just mentioned in the group about arranging for you to learn to fly. When are you free? Let's learn to fly together!” Venerable White said expectantly.

“Haha, I actually just saw the message from Elder Huangshan. But I have finals coming up tomorrow, so after those are over, I plan to head over to the Luoxin District in the neighboring city,” Scholar Song replied calmly.

Since he couldn’t avoid it, he might as well delay the time… After he had a bit of psychological preparation, he could accompany Venerable White to learn to fly. Oh, or maybe it would be learning to turn into ash.

“Neighboring city, do you have something to do?” Venerable White asked curiously.

Scholar Song explained, “I need to find a group of people. They are the subordinates of a former ‘forum master’ who once tried to rob me. This time, during the incident involving the ‘Kite Flower Cultivator’ and the Blood God Diamond, they were implicated. The Kite Flower Cultivator has some kind of cooperation with them, so they might know his background. If I can find out which branch of the Wuji Demon Sect he belongs to, that would be even better.”

If he could discover the location of the Kite Flower Cultivator's branch, he could send that information to Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan and take down that branch!

“Hmm, okay, then let’s learn to fly in a few days. No rush, we have plenty of time,” Venerable White replied with a smile. “After all, there are still so many cars in the garage; I can still have a lot of fun with them.”

“Haha, as long as you’re happy, Senior.” Cold sweat began to pour down Scholar Song’s forehead like a waterfall. Was Venerable White planning to exhaust every single car in the garage?

…

…

About three minutes later, the chat software pinged, and the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain quietly sent a private message to Scholar Song: “Little friend Scholar Song, did you take Venerable Bai to learn driving today?”

“Yes,” Scholar Song replied.

“Was it safe?” the Immortal Sage asked, his question short and to the point!

“Elder Huangshan, I can only say—I'm still alive!” Scholar Song sighed. “You know what? Venerable Bai set up three formations in the car. One for invisibility, one for sound insulation, and another for counter-surveillance called ‘Hidden Energy’! In the end, he even added a ‘Clear Wind Acceleration’ to the car!”

The corners of the Immortal Sage’s mouth twitched.

“And in the end, the steering wheel broke! The brakes failed! We fell off a cliff—though luckily, I found a purple ‘Bamboo Shoot’ that enhances olfactory senses, which is greatly beneficial for opening my nasal passages. Hehehe.”

The message ended with a string of laughter—Scholar Song himself didn’t even know what that laughter represented. But if he didn’t add a few “hehes” at the end, he would feel uncomfortable all over.

“……” The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

“Good luck!” After a long pause, the Immortal Sage replied, “After this mission, Venerable Bai will reward you with some compensation. Also, the others in our group have discussed it, and once the mission is over, we’ll pool together a big red envelope for you that will definitely satisfy you!”

After all, with Venerable Bai’s power increasing, his destructive capacity had also risen, making the difficulty of the missions proportionately greater, thus requiring compensation.

Scholar Song quickly replied: “That’s exactly what I was waiting to hear from Elder Huangshan!”

“Also, make sure to take Venerable Bai to learn to fly when you have the chance,” the Immortal Sage advised. “Not to mention, learning to fly with Venerable Bai should enhance safety. Just think about it—if a plane crashes… if you’re learning alone, you’ll definitely be in big trouble. But if Venerable Bai is learning with you, at least he can use his sword to fly and take you to safety! Right?”

What the Immortal Sage said made too much sense, and Scholar Song felt he couldn’t refute it at all!

Yes, at the very least, if a plane crashed, Venerable Bai could still take him away on his sword.

Thinking this way, it didn’t seem so bad to learn to fly with Venerable Bai after all.

“Then after my finals are done and I deal with a personal matter, I’ll go learn to fly with Venerable Bai,” Scholar Song replied.

As he said this, he looked enviously at the flying sword beneath him.

Flying on a sword was so amazing! Unfortunately, one had to be at least a fourth-grade cultivator to be able to do it.

For now, this was his biggest life goal—standing on a flying sword and swooping up into the sky. How cool would that be!

Oh, right! When he eventually had his own flying sword, he must make it a bit bigger and add a guardrail around it for extra safety!

Scholar Song thought to himself.

Meanwhile, at the headquarters of the Wuji Demon Sect.

Master Jingmo had finished some trivial matters at ‘Mao Hou Peak’ and was flying swiftly toward Jiangnan on his sword.

Along the way, he contacted his branch’s steward, Chen.

“Steward Chen, how is the investigation into ‘Scholar Song’s Pressure’ going?” Master Jingmo asked in a deep voice, his silver hair standing on end in the wind.

“Master, we arranged for the nearest ‘Kite Flower Cultivator’ to investigate Scholar Song's situation a few days ago. However, today, we suddenly lost contact with the Kite Flower Cultivator, so it seems like he’s in grave danger. Our second batch of investigators is nearing Jiangnan University Town. We’ll at least find out the cause of the Kite Flower Cultivator’s disappearance before making further judgments,” Steward Chen replied cautiously, careful not to say anything wrong that might anger Master Jingmo.

Upon hearing this, a flicker of lightning sparked in Master Jingmo's eyes. After a moment of contemplation, he said, “I remember the Kite Flower Cultivator; he should be quite cautious in his dealings. Scholar Song is just a rookie who has just opened his spiritual senses, so he shouldn’t be his opponent. If the Kite Flower Cultivator was taken out, that means Scholar Song must have a powerful ally by his side.”

Just as they were speaking, a subordinate of Steward Chen handed over a letter. It was a message that had been sent through layers of communication, received from the Kite Flower Cultivator before he met his fate.

Steward Chen opened it and found it contained recent intelligence regarding Scholar Song, revealing that he indeed had a formidable ally by his side.

“Master, we just received intelligence from the Kite Flower Cultivator that was sent yesterday. Scholar Song does have a powerful ally. It’s a strong cultivator who, when they accidentally fall, creates a crater thirty meters in diameter!” Steward Chen quickly relayed.

“A thirty-meter-wide crater? Could it be another fifth-grade Golden Core Spirit Emperor like Sable Sixteen?” Master Jingmo pondered for a moment before responding, “You all work on pinpointing the locations of Scholar Song and that powerful cultivator. Once I return, I’ll have a proper meeting with both of them.”

Master Jingmo's tone was filled with confidence as he secretly clenched a talisman tightly in his arms.

Recently, due to Sable Sixteen’s frenzied attacks on the branches of the Wuji Demon Sect, he had begged his master for a talisman.

This talisman was inscribed with the ‘Blood Escape Great Technique’. Once activated, not even a fifth-grade Golden Core Spirit Emperor would be able to stop him, let alone a sixth-grade True Monarch! He could even protect himself if he encountered Sable Sixteen.

With this talisman, he could quietly observe Scholar Song and his powerful ally up close.

If that powerful ally was merely a fourth-grade cultivator, he was confident he wouldn’t lose to them. He could forcefully seize the ‘Blood God Diamond’ without a hitch.

If the ally was above fifth-grade Golden Core, he would escape quickly. If the other party noticed him and attacked, at least he could protect his life with the talisman.

After all, that powerful ally next to Scholar Song couldn’t possibly be a seventh-grade Venerable, could they?

Of course… it would be even better if he could encounter Scholar Song alone. If he could avoid a direct confrontation with that powerful cultivator, it would certainly save him a lot of effort.
