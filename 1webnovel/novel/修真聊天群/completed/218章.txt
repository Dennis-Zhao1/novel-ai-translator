**Chapter 1: Into the Void**

“Oh no, we’re going to crash! What the heck, Elder White, snap out of it!”

The Turtle Breathing Technique—this was a name that even a novice could easily grasp. It was a spell designed to help cultivators reduce their breathing rate. 

In the world of cultivation, there were countless methods and techniques that focused on minimizing breathing and heartbeat. The Turtle Breathing Technique itself had two variations: the ‘Short-Term Turtle Breathing Technique’ and the ‘Long-Term Turtle Breathing Skill.’

Fay Yu’s senior brother, Liu Jianyi, was a man so lazy he barely breathed. He had diligently practiced the Turtle Breathing Skill and had now reached a level where he only needed to breathe two to three times a month.

The ‘Turtle Breathing Technique,’ on the other hand, allowed a cultivator to use their magical abilities to replace their breathing function for a short duration. The stronger the cultivator, the more effective the spell.

This technique was widely applicable; once a low-level cultivator mastered it, they could explore underwater or delve into oxygen-deprived depths without any issues.

But that wasn’t the problem. The real issue was—why in the world was Elder White choosing to teach him this Turtle Breathing Technique right now? Scholar Song felt a wave of panic wash over him!

Elder White remained calm and serene, asking softly, “So, do you want to learn it?”

“Elder,” Scholar Song frowned, “just tell me straight, is something happening?”

Elder White turned his head slightly and smiled. “Well, if all goes well, after we fly a bit higher, we’ll break through the atmosphere and enter space!”

We’re about to break through the atmosphere… and enter space…

Of course, what he feared most was coming true.

“Elder White, can’t you stop the flying sword? With your strength, it should be no problem!” Scholar Song asked cautiously.

Honestly, if it were just him and Elder White, he would have accepted the adventure of entering space. After all, he was prepared with a spacesuit—he could just consider it a thrilling “One-Day Universe Tour with Elder White” experience.

But this time, there was an additional person, Instructor Li. There was only one spacesuit! Wait a minute… so that’s why Elder White wanted me to learn the Turtle Breathing Technique?

Was he suggesting that I give the spacesuit to Instructor Li and use the Turtle Breathing Technique myself? Scholar Song’s eyes welled with tears!

“You guessed it right; the spacesuit can be given to Instructor Li.” The Mind Reader, Elder White, continued to smile and gave a thumbs up. “You see, when I was flying with that little brat earlier, we went too fast, and now we can’t stop. Of course, I could force it to stop, but the outer shell of this helicopter wouldn’t withstand the pressure and would explode. For me, it’s no problem, but you and Instructor Li… well, that’s uncertain.”

Scholar Song’s mouth twitched. Uncertain? Does that mean we’re going to die?

“I understand, Elder.” Scholar Song said, “Please teach me the Turtle Breathing Technique!”

At the same time, he took off his spacesuit and handed it to poor Instructor Li. He felt a bit guilty about dragging Instructor Li into this mess.

Hopefully, after all this is over, Elder White would use some kind of ‘mind-wiping technique’ to help him forget this troublesome episode, so he could go back to living happily.

“Don’t worry; with me around, you’ll be perfectly safe in space! I’m a Seventh-Rank Spirit Master, after all,” Elder White assured him.

However, Elder White was lying. Well, a little white lie for a good cause.

With his power, even if the ‘helicopter-type disposable flying sword’ were to increase its speed tenfold, stopping it would be a mere thought for him.

And he would definitely stop it smoothly.

But Elder White remembered the spacesuit Scholar Song had and their conversation before boarding the aircraft.

Scholar Song must have been eager to visit space.

Moreover, due to his admiration for astronauts, he couldn’t help but wear the spacesuit during the flight, wanting to experience what it felt like to be an astronaut.

Although he didn’t know what concerns Scholar Song had, Elder White thought back to all the care Scholar Song had given him over time. Now that he had the opportunity, why not fulfill his wish?

While they might not be able to go too far, they could take a quick tour around the edge of Earth, find a slightly larger meteorite to land on, and take a photo for keepsake.

Elder White was a very considerate mentor.

Sometimes, he could be quite thoughtful, too!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Perhaps it was the sense of impending danger from “about to face the cosmos” that spurred Scholar Song on; he quickly mastered the Turtle Breathing Technique.

The Turtle Breathing Technique was only slightly more complex than the ‘Palm Lightning,’ requiring the use of vital energy to draw a Turtle Breathing rune in the palms of both hands.

Then, by activating the power within the ‘Turtle Breathing Rune’ using mental energy, and forming the Xuan Turtle Seal with his hands, he could trigger the spell and enter the Turtle Breathing state.

Moreover, the Turtle Breathing rune consisted of just six simple strokes.

It felt as if all the spells Elder White taught him had some similarities in usage. They all involved drawing runes in the palm and activating them with mental energy, either by softly chanting the spell name or forming a seal to cast the spell.

Could it be that these were all ‘White’ series spells after Elder White’s unique modifications?

Under Elder White’s direct guidance, Scholar Song attempted to activate the ‘Turtle Breathing Technique’ to enter the Turtle Breathing state.

He formed the Xuan Turtle Seal and activated the spell!

In the next moment, he felt his heartbeat slow, and his breathing… stopped!

Breathing was a natural instinct for humans; there was no need to consciously control it. But now, he had stopped breathing entirely, and he didn’t feel any discomfort—it was as if he was born to not need to breathe.

This feeling was quite strange.

—It felt more like a technique for passing on than for breathing.

“Good, with your current strength, you can maintain the Turtle Breathing Technique for about an hour, maybe two hours. When the effect is about to wear off, I’ll remind you to reinforce it, so you won’t have any breathing issues in space,” Elder White chuckled.

However, simply solving the breathing issue wasn’t enough to survive in space.

Without a spacesuit, the vacuum of space, extreme temperatures, solar radiation, and micro-meteoroids could harm the human body.

For example, in a vacuum environment, the nitrogen in a person’s blood would turn into gas, expanding in volume. Without a pressurized and sealed spacesuit, the pressure difference between the inside and outside could lead to life-threatening situations.

For Elder White, these were non-issues. For cultivators, as long as they had condensed their Golden Core and were Fifth-Rank Spirit Emperors, their physical strength was sufficient to survive in space. If they could resolve the breathing issue, even a Fifth-Rank Spirit Emperor could live comfortably in space.

But Scholar Song was a mere First-Rank novice, just a bit stronger than an average person—not enough to withstand the various dangers of the cosmos.

“Hmm, without a spacesuit, we’ll need to provide you with some more protection,” Elder White said, pulling out a small notebook from his pocket.

It was a palm-sized notebook. Elder White opened it and began to draw on it with his fingers.

“Elder, what are you doing?” Scholar Song asked cautiously.

Elder White replied, “I’m drawing a talisman for you, a protective charm to ensure you don’t just float away and die in space. It’s a shame; if you had prepared a second spacesuit, you could have truly experienced the life of an astronaut.”

“Hahahaha.” Scholar Song forced a laugh—actually, I never wanted to experience the life of an astronaut!

Besides, talismans can also be drawn with a ‘notebook’?

Today, Elder White had once again expanded Scholar Song’s understanding of talismans since seeing him forge flying swords from branches.

“All done!” Elder White said as he tore a page from the notebook, folded it into a small piece, and handed it to Scholar Song. “Put this deep in your pocket. When we break through the Earth’s atmosphere, it will protect you like a spacesuit.”

Although he wanted to complain about Elder White drawing talismans with a ‘notebook,’ this concerned his life and safety, so Scholar Song carefully accepted it and tucked the ‘talisman’ into his ** pocket.

Just as they were speaking, suddenly, the ‘helicopter-type disposable flying sword’ seemed to break through some kind of restriction, and Scholar Song’s vision went dark.

Then, a myriad of bright stars appeared before him.

They had broken through the atmosphere and entered space!

I didn’t even get to properly experience the process.

But…

“It’s breathtaking!” Scholar Song exclaimed, his eyes wide open, unsure of where to look. Every sight was so beautiful that he wished he could imprint them permanently in his mind.

He was still inside the helicopter’s shell, with a layer of protection set up by Elder White outside. Since he could still speak, he figured he should take advantage of it before they exited the helicopter and ventured into space, where sounds wouldn’t carry.

“Isn’t it beautiful? I’ve always loved flying out here to take a look… Actually, there was a time when I wanted to find a planet in space to retreat and cultivate. But I had to give up due to many unresolved issues,” Elder White remarked with a smile.

He continued to smile, but then suddenly, Elder White went blank.

The vastness of the cosmos had stirred a distant memory within him, drawing him into a trance.

Elder White… had spaced out.

However, while Elder White was lost in thought, the ‘helicopter-type flying sword’ didn’t stop; it continued to fly at a speed akin to spatial jumps.

At that moment, sharp-eyed Scholar Song suddenly noticed a massive object slowly moving in the direction they were heading.

“Hey, Elder White, there seems to be something ahead! Ah, Elder White, turn around, we’re going to crash!” Scholar Song shouted.

But Elder White didn’t respond for a long time.

Scholar Song looked at Elder White—oh no, Elder White is really lost in thought!
