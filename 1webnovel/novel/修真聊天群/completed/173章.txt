**The Flame That Lasts Only Two Seconds: Dou Dou**

Flames blazed fiercely along the blade, a sight to behold.

However, it was not Scholar Song who ignited this fire.

The 'Flame Blade Technique' taught by the Daoist Master Chi Xiao in his dreams seemed simple, yet in reality, it represented the very essence of the Dao—returning to simplicity and purity. A simple slash was capable of incinerating everything in the world; nothing was immune to its flames!

Even if you gathered the talents of a hundred Scholar Songs, it would be impossible to master this technique after just one viewing and practice.

Moreover, he had never touched a blade before this moment. Wielding the treasured sword, he was merely flailing about randomly. To unleash flames from a blade, one needed to reach at least the second tier, where the power of blood and energy transformed into true qi.

At this moment, the flames erupting from his sword stemmed from the ancient bronze ring on his finger.

This ring was imbued with a second-tier fire attack, the 'Flame Blade,' specifically added by its original owner, Li Tiansu.

In fact, the ordinary 'Flame Blade Technique' had long ceased to enhance Li Tiansu’s battle prowess after he condensed his golden core. The reason he preserved this technique was out of nostalgia for his mentor, Daoist Chi Xiao—and a lingering desire.

When Daoist Chi Xiao and Li Tiansu parted ways, he had suddenly wielded a branch like a sword and performed the 'Flame Blade Technique,' creating flames that scorched the heavens and turning a towering tree to charcoal in an instant. It had profoundly shaken Li Tiansu’s spirit.

As Li Tiansu's power gradually increased, he sought ways to transform this 'Flame Blade Technique' into an attack spell, embedding it within his ancient bronze ring. As long as the ring's owner struck the pose for the 'Flame Blade Technique,' the spell within the ring would activate, allowing them to unleash the technique.

Earlier... when Scholar Song had turned to strike, he had indeed used the pose of the 'Flame Blade Technique.' At that moment, when the energy within his heart and eyes surged, it triggered the spell within the ancient bronze ring!

Without the awe-inspiring presence of Daoist Chi Xiao, the flames on the blade weren't all-consuming. Yet even so, this 'Flame Blade Technique' still possessed the might of a full-force second-tier strike!

The raging fire on the sword turned into a scorching wave, slashing toward the enemy!

The Sunflower cultivator felt a wave of heat wash over him, yet he found himself unable to evade—he was too fast, boosted by the 'Green Wind Acceleration' spell, and could not stop!

This was what they meant by excessive speed being dangerous.

Thus, unable to control his velocity, he crashed headlong into the oncoming wave of fiery heat.

Amidst the flames, a glint of sharp blade light flashed.

The Sunflower cultivator's towering body was cleaved in two, the flames ruthlessly consuming him...

It was over!

Scholar Song felt mentally drained, dizziness overtaking him.

At that moment, Dou Dou suddenly appeared beside the Sunflower cultivator, extending a paw and gently tapping him.

Two small porcelain bottles and a pendant talisman were produced from Dou Dou's possession.

Afterward, the Sunflower cultivator’s body was completely consumed by the flames of the 'Flame Blade Technique,' leaving nothing behind.

Dou Dou's eyes sparkled with delight as he tossed the three items to Scholar Song. "Here you go, spoils of war. It would be a pity to let them burn away."

One of the porcelain bottles contained a decent-quality vitality pill.

And the pendant was the low-tier artifact the Sunflower cultivator had previously employed, the 'Green Wind Acceleration.' If used wisely, it could yield unexpected results.

Scholar Song collapsed onto the ground, panting heavily as he accepted the three items.

His 'Eye Talent' had nearly drained all his mental energy, and activating the 'Flame Blade Technique' from the ancient bronze ring had truly left him utterly spent.

"Ha... Dou Dou, shall we head back?" Scholar Song smiled at Dou Dou.

At that moment, a figure slowly stood up from a corner. "Hahaha, what an exciting battle!"

It was a subordinate of the 'Altar Master,' a first-tier cultivator with two apertures. Earlier, he had suffered several punches from Scholar Song's 'Fundamental Fist Technique II' and had probably sustained only minor injuries due to some defensive measures.

He had been playing dead on the ground, waiting for the Sunflower cultivator to perish and for Scholar Song to exhaust himself before revealing himself.

He grinned maliciously, wielding two hiltless knives in each hand, eyeing Scholar Song with glee. The grand opportunity was right before him—if he could cripple this 'Scholar Song' and take him to the 'Wuji Demon Sect,' he would have a chance to join their ranks. From there, his cultivation journey would soar to new heights!

Who knows, he might even become stronger than the original 'Altar Master.'

Seeing this subordinate of the altar, Scholar Song sighed inwardly. "I really am lacking in experience. Next time, I’ll make sure to pay close attention to every fallen enemy."

The altar master’s subordinate laughed, "Too bad, you won’t get a next time."

As he spoke, he hurled his four hiltless blades toward Scholar Song, aiming to cripple his limbs.

"Experience takes time to accumulate; I’ll be more cautious next time," a voice suddenly chuckled from the void.

It was Dou Dou’s voice.

With that, Dou Dou elegantly stepped forward, positioning himself in front of Scholar Song, transforming into a five-meter-long giant dog.

Clang, clang, clang!

The sharp hiltless blades struck Dou Dou, but they couldn’t even cut a single hair. It felt as if dust had simply fallen on a person, entirely unbothered.

A gentle breeze swept by, and the larger-than-life Dou Dou looked remarkably suave.

The altar master’s subordinate's eyes widened in horror as he gazed at the giant dog before him!

This was a demon beast!

Why had a demon beast appeared here?

But there was no time for further thought; Dou Dou opened his mouth and unleashed a stream of azure demon fire that engulfed him, instantly turning the altar master’s subordinate to ash.

The remaining five subordinates of the altar master lying on the ground met the same fate, as Dou Dou showered them all with azure demon fire, erasing their existence completely.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but think that he was lucky to have Dou Dou with him; otherwise, he would have been in trouble.

"Let’s go home now," Dou Dou said as he picked up Scholar Song and his backpack, gently placing him on his back.

With a light leap, they soared into the air, wrapped in a mist of demon fog that concealed their figures.

Dou Dou raced through the void, his soft fur enveloping Scholar Song completely.

Scholar Song lay weakly on Dou Dou’s back.

"Wow, lying on Dou Dou's back feels so soft and comfortable," he chuckled, rubbing against Dou Dou.

No bed, no matter how soft, could compare to the comfort of Dou Dou’s back.

"……" Dou Dou paused for a moment. "Just so you know, I’m male. If you’re looking for a romance like in movies and TV shows, I’m not the right match for you. How about I introduce you to some cat girls? I won’t introduce you to dog girls; I can’t let you harm my kind."

Scholar Song: "……"
