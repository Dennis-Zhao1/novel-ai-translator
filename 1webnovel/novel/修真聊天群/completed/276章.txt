### The Jealous Man

“Zhou Li, let go!” Doudou shouted at Zhou Li.

“Ha ha ha, Doudou, don’t even think about it. Once I catch you, you won’t escape!” Zhou Li declared, as chains extended from his sleeves, ending in sharp, curved hooks.

These chains were Zhou Li’s cultivation weapon, known by his nickname, ‘The Hidden Sky Hook.’ Not only could this weapon kill, but it also had a unique technique for capturing enemies—this was precisely why Zhou Li had been appointed as one of the captors of Doudou. Whether it was catching people or dogs, Zhou Li had a reputation for being exceptionally skilled.

“Correct, I won’t let you escape, you monster!” shouted a young monster catcher girl from above, using a distinctive doll-like voice.

“Benefactor, the little monk… is dying… um… um…” The little monk, frothing at the mouth, could no longer hold on and slumped downwards.

The little monk had only recently completed his foundational cultivation and had opened the second channel, ‘Eye Channel,’ before leaving the temple. His physical strength was still inferior to that of Scholar Song at present.

Having his neck restrained for so long, he finally collapsed. Ultimately, the young monster catcher girl pulled the little monk away from Doudou.

“Ah ah ah ah!” A series of screams erupted, but they did not come from the little monk; instead, they were shrieks from the young monster catcher girl.

Clearly, her cultivation level was low… she lacked the ability to fly.

As the little monk fell from Doudou, she followed suit, plummeting from the sky, and the chains around the little monk’s neck slackened.

At that moment, Zhou Li shouted sharply, and the chains coiled around the young monster catcher, pulling her and the little monk back to his side. The hooks floated in the air, writhing like a great serpent.

With his fourth-tier cultivation, Zhou Li employed a technique called ‘Flying with the Hook,’ using the chains as his weapon. 

While the hook had its unique advantages in restraining foes, its speed in flight was a significant drawback compared to flying swords or flying daggers.

But that was fine; there were no rules saying a cultivator could only use one weapon!

Suddenly, a sword pellet shot out from his left sleeve, transforming into a beam of sword light.

This was a flying sword pellet specially given to him by the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain for the purpose of capturing Doudou. Its attack power was average, not very effective in combat.

The only advantage of this sword pellet was its speed, incredibly swift.

“Doudou, don’t even think about running! I have the little monk in my grasp; can you escape?” Zhou Li bellowed.

Ahead, Doudou stopped, turned around, and revealed a human-like smile: “The little monk is someone I intentionally had you take down… because he was stuck on my back, I couldn’t untie him.”

“Ha ha, regardless, today I must take you back!” Zhou Li said sternly—he was determined to catch Doudou for the sake of his love. After all, a seven-day blissful date awaited him!

That was a whole seven days of vacation, during which he could do whatever he desired.

Just thinking about it made Zhou Li feel invigorated, his eyes gleaming with excitement.

Standing on the sword pellet, gripping the chain hook, he watched Doudou with a fierce gaze, subconsciously locking onto her escape routes…

“Don’t panic, I have something interesting to show you.” Doudou raised her left paw, waving it with a smiling expression, while her other paw pulled out a smartphone from her fur and logged into an account.

Zhou Li watched Doudou warily, fearing she might pull some trick.

At that moment, a bizarre smile appeared on Doudou’s dog face, and she began to recite: “Ahem… Ah, darling, I miss you so much! I think of you every night and day, so much that I can’t sleep! Ah, darling, I can’t wait to be by your side forever! Oh, how cheesy.”

After Doudou finished reciting… Zhou Li, who had been filled with excitement just moments before, suddenly wore a strange expression, his gaze fixated on Doudou and the phone in her paw.

“Want me to keep reading? Oh, the timestamp of the next message was last night. Ah, darling! I think of you 365 days a year～ Soon, I can catch Doudou and hand her over to a little friend, and I will get at least seven days of vacation! Darling, I can’t wait to fly to your side and share those seven sweet days together; I have already planned the locations for our dates, ensuring we have beautiful memories. Ha ha ha,” Doudou continued.

Zhou Li’s eyes were glazed over, and then he roared angrily, “Doudou, where did you get that chat log!”

This was clearly a sweet chat between him and his girlfriend, a private account he had! How dare Doudou invade his privacy!

His private account wasn’t part of the ‘Ninefold Land One Group’ and wasn’t connected to other cultivators, so it wasn’t hard for Doudou to intercept the messages.

“You must think I hacked your little account?” Doudou chuckled. “So naive!”

Saying that, Doudou flipped the phone around, letting Zhou Li see her account.

What appeared was a chat account with a beautiful fairy avatar, filled with sweet nothings sent by Zhou Li’s little account.

“And you probably think I hacked your ‘darling’s’ account.” Doudou laughed mischievously. “You’re being naive again!”

“Let me show you the brutal truth of this world—throughout all your sweet nothings, your conversations about love, future, and happiness, it was all me, Doudou!” Doudou laughed triumphantly.

Zhou Li was stunned.

“No way, I’ve met her in real life!” Zhou Li shouted.

“Ha ha ha, with my charm, it’s easy to find a female cultivator from any sect to act cute and get her to help me with a small task. Think back to your first meeting with her; didn’t she always show you a gentle smile, as if she could accept everything about you? Yet she never wanted to talk about your online chats?” Doudou’s smile was devilish.

“Impossible, you’re lying to me.” Zhou Li gritted his teeth.

“Ha ha, impossible? You’re too naive, Zhou Li!” Doudou laughed loudly. “Do you really think any female cultivator could stand a man like you? Always too busy chasing a Pekingese around while leaving her alone at home?”

Doudou paused, shaking the phone screen vigorously: “There are no female cultivators like that in this world; if there are, they only exist in dreams and deception! Do you see? This is reality!”

Zhou Li stood frozen in shock.

And in that moment of shock… Doudou darted like lightning, snatching up the little monk and fleeing swiftly into the distance.

The little monk, lying on Doudou’s back, looked back at the dumbfounded Zhou Li with concern.

“Doudou, do you think we’re being a bit too harsh on Zhou Li?” the little monk asked cautiously, feeling that Zhou Li was quite pitiful.

The female cultivator he admired was actually being impersonated by Doudou? Just imagining Zhou Li in a romantic relationship with a Pekingese made the little monk feel that if he were in Zhou Li’s shoes, he would probably go crazy.

“Pitiful? Ha! Others are envious of him!” Doudou snorted. “Chasing a Pekingese around while actually having a female cultivator waiting for him to date? This scenario, which only exists in dreams and deceptions, has truly manifested in this guy’s life. How many people must be envious of this darned reality?”

“Eh? That female cultivator isn’t someone you impersonated, is she?” the little monk questioned.

“You think I’m the type to tolerate a male like Zhou Li, exchanging cheesy texts every day? That account was secretly obtained after I acted cute at that female cultivator’s place for several days,” Doudou chuckled.

“I think you are someone who would do something like that,” the little monk asserted—if it were anyone else, he wouldn’t be so sure, but Doudou had the potential to pull off such shameless acts.

“And also, Doudou, it’s not good to lie. You might get spanked,” the little monk said seriously.

Doudou: “…”

“Believe it or not, I could drop you from high up, you brat! I’m telling you, I made up this big lie just to save you!” Doudou roared.

“Sorry!” the little monk quickly apologized, but after a moment, he still said seriously, “But lying really is bad.”

At that moment, Doudou truly wanted to send the little monk back.

……

……

Behind them, Zhou Li stood dazedly on the flying sword, his face pale.

“Uncle, don’t cry,” the young monster catcher girl said cautiously from the side.

“Ha ha… Doudou, Doudou! You dare to toy with my feelings!” Zhou Li uttered a strange laugh. “I’m going to battle you!”

The flying sword’s light flared up, and Zhou Li, along with the young monster catcher girl, rushed towards Doudou.

“Uncle, let’s get that big demon dog!” the young monster catcher girl called out in her unique doll-like voice.

“Let’s get it, let’s get it!” Zhou Li roared.

Wenzhou City, Scholar Song’s home.

Scholar Song opened his eyes, concluding today’s meditation.

“Venerable White hasn’t sent any news yet. Will the senior bring Doudou and the others back tomorrow?” he pondered silently.

“Also… I didn’t complete today’s routine cultivation… I’ll have to wait until everyone is asleep before sneaking out to cultivate. The accumulation of qi and blood in the ear channel is happening faster than I expected. I should be able to break through by tomorrow,” Scholar Song muttered to himself.

He wondered if, after opening the ear channel, he would have the chance to gain an ear channel talent.

Among the four channels—eyes, nose, ears, and mouth—each one opened presented the opportunity to gain a channel talent. He hoped to awaken a useful talent!
