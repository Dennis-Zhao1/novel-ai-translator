**A Blade to the Neck**

Scholar Song carried the small boy on his back and led everyone to the edge of the ancient city.

The city walls were primarily structured in a traditional Chinese style, yet the towering walls had an unusual design, resembling step-like pyramids, stacked layer upon layer.

Each layer stood ten meters high, with a total of four layers.

Even the city gate stood at a height of eight meters and was approximately four lanes wide. A massive 'metal gate' that was several times larger than a large dam gate blocked the entrance securely.

Intricate, mysterious patterns were carved into the metal gate, which at first glance appeared decorative.

However, upon closer inspection, Scholar Song noticed that each of these patterns had a specific arrangement. The numerous designs seemed to form a gigantic formation of some kind of mystical arts, though its purpose remained unknown.

As expected, this ancient city was built by cultivators; there was a good chance they could find a way to escape the mysterious island here! Scholar Song felt a wave of reassurance wash over him.

At that moment, the group behind him gaped at the towering walls and the heavy metal gate—how on earth were they supposed to open and close such a door?

"Scholar, how do we get inside?" someone named Gao asked, noting that there were no guards at the city’s edge, and the gate didn’t appear to be automatic. How could they possibly enter?

"I don't know… This is my first time here, just like you all," Scholar Song replied. "I'll look around to see if there's a way into the city. You all rest here and don’t wander off."

In fact, there was no need for Scholar Song to urge them; no one wanted to roam around aimlessly.

The enormous lizard they had encountered earlier had frightened everyone, not to mention the absurdly large gorillas.

Moreover, after running from the grasslands to the ancient city, everyone was already exhausted. Now, upon reaching the base of the wall, they slumped against it to take a breather, completely drained of energy.

"I still have some strength left; I’ll go look around with you," Tupo said as he stood up, his regular exercise granting him a bit more endurance.

Gao pounded his legs and chuckled, "I’ll join you too! The ancient city is so vast; having more people searching could help us find clues faster."

"No need for that. You and Tupo stay here and take care of Yayi and the girls," Scholar Song smiled. He was a bit uneasy about leaving Yayi and the other girls unguarded if both Gao and Tupo followed him.

Gao glanced at his girlfriend Yayi, who was already worn out, and sighed, "Just be careful. This ancient city gives off a strange vibe."

"Don’t worry, I run pretty fast," Scholar Song replied with a grin.

With that, he waved and headed left along the city wall.

"Wait for me, Scholar! I’m coming with you!" Joseph suddenly scrambled to his feet and quickly caught up with Scholar Song. His stamina was impressive; he had run all this way while Tupo was starting to tire, yet Joseph looked as energetic as ever.

Scholar Song glanced at his nominal disciple, chuckling as he nodded.

Joseph beamed with excitement, quickening his pace to keep up with Scholar Song.

……

After Scholar Song and Joseph had walked a considerable distance along the city wall, Tupo curiously asked, "By the way, how did Uncle Joseph become Scholar Song’s disciple?"

He had seen the video that Zhuge Yue posted online—virtually every student in Jiangnan University Town had watched it. But Tupo was curious about how Uncle Joseph had connected with Scholar Song and ended up as his disciple.

And he learned a set of "The Times Are Calling," treating it as an extraordinary skill to practice?

"Actually, if you think about Scholar Song’s kind nature, you can probably piece together the story," Gao said, adjusting his glasses out of habit, though he was frustrated that they were missing, so he settled for rubbing the bridge of his nose. "I bet it was during the school athletic meet; Scholar Song was probably bored and doing some calisthenics in a corner of the campus, working out. And 'The Times Are Calling' does have some poses resembling martial arts from movies."

"Then I suspect Uncle Joseph must have been interested in Chinese martial arts. So on that athletic meet day, while wandering Jiangnan University Town, he stumbled upon Scholar Song doing calisthenics, mistaking it for some kind of martial arts. After that, I imagine he approached Scholar Song and asked him to teach him 'The Times Are Calling'... Given Scholar Song’s kind nature, he probably wouldn’t have refused such a simple request and ended up teaching Uncle Joseph some calisthenics," Gao speculated.

His reasoning was quite good; apart from the 'cultivation' part, his guesses were pretty close to the truth.

Lufei nodded in agreement, "That makes sense. I heard Shuangxue mention that her dad has always been a fan of martial arts movies. He’s fascinated by Chinese martial arts, which is why he married a Chinese woman and even self-studied Chinese because of his love for martial arts."

"That’s reasonable," Tupo considered for a moment before saying, "It seems we should avoid shattering Uncle Joseph’s 'martial arts' dream."

Gao and Yayi chimed in, "Plus, thanks to Uncle Joseph doing those exercises, he managed to distract those gorillas for quite some time."

Everyone nodded in agreement... but when they thought back to the experience of being forced by the gorillas to learn "The Times Are Calling," a mix of emotions stirred in their hearts.

"This is definitely an experience I won’t forget for the rest of my life. I’ve decided, once I get back, I’ll do 'The Times Are Calling' at least three times a day," the slightly plump flight attendant declared, clenching her fist with determination.

"I’ll do it ten times every day!" the black uncle laughed, calling out in stiff Chinese, "I’ll turn 'The Times Are Calling' into street dance and spread it in the dance community!"

The female white-collar passenger giggled and joined in, "I’m going to do it every day too, not just 'The Times Are Calling,' but I also remember 'The Eagle Soars!'"

"And 'The World is Beautiful,' and 'The Energy of Youth,' I did those back in school," a young male passenger chimed in.

"I remember learning 'Dance of Youth' back in high school," Yayi added, laughing as she joined in.

As they chatted, warm laughter filled the air, and the oppressive feelings in their hearts seemed to dissipate significantly.

Afterward, the surviving passengers began introducing themselves.

At heart, humans are social creatures; in times of crisis, it’s instinctive to band together.

Just as everyone was chatting away, Tupo suddenly pointed to a shadow in the sky and shouted, "Wait, what’s that!"

In the sky, a shadow was rapidly descending, seemingly heading straight for the ancient city.

It was an eagle!

And not just any eagle—a gargantuan one. Its wings spread wide, measuring over ten meters across, its body was like a small aircraft.

Whether it was the previous lizard or now this eagle… everything on this island seemed to be oversized.

Or perhaps, they were the ones who had shrunk?

"Not just one; there are more behind it!" Gao shouted as he spotted two more massive shadows rapidly closing in behind the giant eagle.

"Quick, hide near the city gate!" Lufei called out.

Though the gate was closed, it was dropped from the middle of the city entrance, creating a half-meter gap that allowed them to slip inside for shelter.

While this wasn’t an ideal hiding place, there was no choice; aside from the walls, the area around the ancient city was nothing but open plains, leaving them without any cover.

Everyone hurried toward the gap between the city gate and the entrance, squeezing together in fear as they gazed up at the gigantic eagle in the sky.

"Oh God… I hope they’re not targeting us," the black uncle murmured, crossing himself anxiously.

Lufei couldn’t help but smile bitterly; the vast open plain around them was completely barren. Besides the walls, there were just them—the few surviving passengers.

From the direction the giant eagle was diving, it was clearly heading towards the walls. If there was nothing appealing for it to eat inside the ancient city… then the eagle's target was likely this group of people.

……

Meanwhile.

Scholar Song and Joseph had walked quite a distance along the city wall, but it seemed to stretch endlessly, with no signs of anything worthwhile.

They still had a long way to go before reaching the next gate that Scholar Song remembered.

At that moment… if only Venerable White or Dou Dou were around, they could fly to the next gate in the blink of an eye. Even a simple hypnotic spell could put everyone to sleep and carry them over the wall into the ancient city.

Just as he was lost in thought, a sudden sense of unease washed over Scholar Song.

He abruptly looked up at the sky, only to see three massive eagles soaring towards the city wall—one leading, two following closely behind.

The two slower eagles were headed towards the previous gate.

The fast one, however, was diving straight for Scholar Song and Joseph.

"Master! B-b-bird!" Joseph exclaimed, spotting the enormous eagle descending upon them.

"Stay behind me and don’t move," Scholar Song commanded, pulling out the treasured blade, Bafa.

To ordinary eyes, Bafa appeared invisible.

Though the eagle was colossal, it was still just an ordinary beast, like the gorillas—merely wild creatures, and not magical beasts. They couldn’t see the blade in Scholar Song’s hand.

Before long, the fast eagle reached Scholar Song and Joseph, letting out a piercing cry as it lunged forward, its massive talons aimed at grabbing both of them in one swoop.

Joseph felt his legs go weak.

This was different from facing the gorillas; while they were terrifying, at least they resembled gorillas from the outside world.

But this eagle, with a wingspan nearing ten meters—what kind of monster was this!

In that instant, Scholar Song gently pushed Joseph aside with a palm, using the soft technique from "Fundamental Skills of the Vajra."

Joseph felt as if he were weightless, flying out of harm's way, narrowly escaping the eagle’s talons.

Yet, he felt no pain where Scholar Song had struck him—had his master’s martial arts reached such a miraculous level?

As that thought crossed his mind, Joseph’s fear evaporated. With a powerful master by his side, perhaps this giant eagle wouldn't be a problem after all.

……

Scholar Song activated "Gentleman’s Long Journey," skillfully dodging the eagle's attack, then leaped up, using the eagle's talon as leverage.

With a powerful push, he soared into the air, spinning as he built momentum before swinging Bafa down towards the giant eagle's neck, aiming to decapitate it!

He needed to deal with this eagle quickly; two more massive eagles were already heading towards the city gate! Scholar Song had no time to waste.

The eagle couldn't see the invisible blade in Scholar Song's hand, but its instincts kicked in, sensing the impending danger.

It instinctively swung its head, using its sharp beak to snap at Scholar Song's arm.

Clang!

As the beak struck Bafa, sparks flew… and then, with a clean cut, the eagle’s beak was severed as easily as slicing tofu!

Keep in mind, Bafa was the legendary blade of the Moon Blade Sect, capable of breaking through the defenses of fourth-grade cultivators. How could the beak of an ordinary eagle, not even a magical beast, withstand it?

As its beak was severed, the eagle was instantly filled with panic. It had never encountered such a situation!

In a flurry of wings, it attempted to gain altitude before making another attack.

But Scholar Song would not give it the chance to flee.

"Fire Blade!" he summoned decisively, activating the ‘Fire Blade’ skill from his ring, flames igniting along the blade.

Scholar Song aimed at the eagle’s neck once more and swung.

"Boom!" The fiery blade shot forth, forming a crescent-shaped wave that struck the eagle’s neck with tremendous force.

The power of the Fire Blade was at the ‘second-grade’ level, second only to Scholar Song's sword talisman.

This time, the eagle could no longer save its head.

Its head flew off, the wound instantly cauterized by the flames, not even a drop of blood escaping.

Scholar Song rolled in mid-air, using his momentum to land gracefully on the ground.

Joseph, standing aside, wiped the drool from his mouth: "That was a blade aura release! It’s similar to the external sword qi from martial arts! Just like a special effect in a movie! One day… can I do that like you, Master?"

Hope filled him for his future.

"Joseph, be careful. I’m heading back to the city gate," Scholar Song said after landing.

"Okay, Master! You take care!" Joseph replied.

Scholar Song nodded, activating "Gentleman’s Long Journey" to its full extent, moving like lightning towards the city gate…

The ‘Fire Blade’ skill could be used once more, and he still had one last sword talisman in hand.

In the sky, the two remaining eagles were drawing ever closer to the city gate.

He must catch up!
