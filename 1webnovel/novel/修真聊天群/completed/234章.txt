**Life Endlessly, Death Pursued Relentlessly**

Just like last time, the young man in the blue robe spotted Scholar Song from afar and happily shouted, “Little White, Little White, I finally found you!”

With the experience from their previous encounter fresh in his mind, Scholar Song clenched his fists and approached, saying, “Yeah, yeah! It’s been a few days since we last met!”

Of course, his words didn’t elicit any response from the blue-robed youth, unless he mentioned the key phrase "rest." Otherwise, the young man would stick to his scripted routine without fail.

However, Scholar Song wasn’t ready to say "rest" just yet; he intended to engage in a battle with this youth to test if his martial skills had improved recently.

Compared to the last time he entered the "Real Illusion," when he had only learned the "Fundamental Vajra Fist," this time, Scholar Song had mastered the "Gentleman's Journey" movement technique and the "Immovable Vajra Body" auxiliary body refinement technique. While his realm hadn’t advanced significantly, his fighting ability had skyrocketed.

“Little White, where did you run off to? I thought you were going to get lost!” The blue-robed youth stood in front of Scholar Song, beaming with a bright smile. He was like an NPC in a game, following a set pattern, repeating the same lines over and over.

“Enough chit-chat! What are we training this time?” Scholar Song boldly proclaimed—while secretly channeling his blood qi to draw a ‘Thunder Talisman’ in his palm, gathering a "Palm Thunder" ready to unleash!

“Little White, let’s practice our punches!” The blue-robed youth didn’t throw a weapon but instead assumed a fighting stance.

Scholar Song chuckled heartily, “Perfect timing! Watch my moves—Fundamental Fist Three!”

Before the blue-robed youth could throw a punch, Scholar Song took the initiative, using the "Gentleman's Journey" technique to maximize his speed.

As he closed the distance to the youth, he unleashed a flurry of punches like a storm, targeting the blue-robed youth with relentless ferocity.

This was a lesson learned after being thoroughly beaten for nearly half an hour last time.

The blue-robed youth was a master of various martial arts, with his punches being exceptionally refined and featuring a finger technique akin to the "Nine Swords of Dugu." Under that one finger strike, Scholar Song's entire "Fundamental Vajra Fist" was easily dismantled.

In such a scenario, the only way to counter was to use speed to break through—“When everything else fails, the only unbreakable truth is speed.”

This time, Scholar Song's realm had improved, and with the help of the Phantom Spirit and his "Gentleman's Journey" technique, his punches rained down faster than before, with sharper angles!

“Hehe, Little White, you’re doing great!” The blue-robed youth giggled.

Just like last time, the blue-robed youth moved like a slippery eel, effortlessly dodging Scholar Song's storm-like punches. Though they came fast, not a single one could graze his body!

After a relentless barrage of seventy punches, Scholar Song was out of steam!

At that moment, the blue-robed youth suddenly pointed, “Hehe, Little White, take this move!”

This single finger strike was still like the "Nine Swords of Dugu," targeting the flaws in Scholar Song's punches. At a moment when his strength was waning, and his old energy was spent while new energy hadn’t yet risen, there was no way to defend!

Last time, it was this divine finger that had nearly knocked Scholar Song out, leaving him sore all over.

But this time, Scholar Song was prepared… The "Palm Thunder" in his hand was already charged and waiting for this very moment!

The blue-robed youth’s finger struck down on Scholar Song’s shoulder.

Scholar Song instantly felt a jolt of numbness and pain, as if shocked by electricity. However, this time, with the protection of the "Immovable Vajra Body," the tingling sensation was bearable.

As the blue-robed youth’s finger pressed down, Scholar Song shouted, “Palm Thunder!”

The Thunder Talisman in his palm erupted into a burst of lightning, which Scholar Song unleashed with a forceful shake of his shoulder, hurling it toward the blue-robed youth.

The blue-robed youth seemed completely unprepared for Scholar Song to use a technique, and for a moment, he didn’t even attempt to dodge.

The Palm Thunder crackled as it struck the youth.

The power of the Palm Thunder was enough to blast a hole the size of a football in solid rock; what would happen to the blue-robed youth after taking a hit from it was uncertain.

Scholar Song wasn’t concerned that the blue-robed youth would actually be killed… This was just a "phantom of the real" caused by Venerable White’s training; even if the blue-robed youth really did get knocked out, a new one would appear shortly thereafter—there was nothing to fear!

“Boom!”

The blue-robed youth was hit by the Palm Thunder, his body flying off to one side, rolling several times in the sand, still crackling with faint arcs of lightning. He lay on the ground, shaking slightly, as the electricity left him numb.

“Hahaha! Got you! I can use Palm Thunder!” Scholar Song laughed triumphantly—finally letting out some pent-up frustration!

Last time, in this desert, the youth had mercilessly beaten him, yet now, this Palm Thunder had allowed him to regain his pride, filling him with a sense of achievement!

As Scholar Song was reveling in his victory, the blue-robed youth rolled over again, then stood up.

He brushed the dust off his blue robe and called out to Scholar Song, “Little White, that’s cheating! You used a technique!”

Scholar Song’s eyes widened in disbelief. “What?! You took a direct hit from Palm Thunder and you’re not hurt?”

“Well, I won’t hold back then!” The blue-robed youth unexpectedly uttered a completely new line.

—It seemed that this hit of the Palm Thunder had triggered a new turn in the storyline, just like how the word "rest" acted as a key phrase.

But this new twist in the plot didn’t appear to be favorable!

Scholar Song swallowed nervously, “Hold on! I think it’d be better if we kept things civil? I’m feeling a bit tired; how about we take a break?”

Yet this time, the word "rest" failed to provoke any change in the blue-robed youth’s script.

“Hehe, watch my technique! Super Invincible, Divine Dragon Nine Appearances, Furious Thunderstorm Great Spell!” The blue-robed youth clasped his hands together and chanted a long, elaborate name.

Is he trying to scare me?

This thought had only just formed in Scholar Song’s mind when suddenly, he heard the rumble of thunder rolling in the sky, followed by… a rain of lightning descending upon him.

Yes, a rain of lightning!

The bolts fell like raindrops, denser than the thunder tribulation faced by Sable Sixteen after crossing the third-grade Heavenly Tribulation.

Scholar Song gazed up at the sky in despair; this onslaught of lightning left him with no room to evade. He could unleash the "Gentleman’s Journey" technique to its fullest to dash a hundred meters in an instant, but the area of the storm was at least five to six hundred meters wide!

I think… I might have just accidentally caused my own demise again?

Scholar Song felt tears welling up in his eyes.

Moments later, the desert echoed with Scholar Song’s pig-like screams…

So painful.

Scholar Song felt as though he was being scorched by the lightning… and his consciousness began to blur.

Stop! If this continues, I’m going to die!

Speaking of which… did I forget something important?

Upon seeing this bizarre desert, his first reaction was that he had the chance to "get back" at the blue-robed youth, and he felt exhilarated. Yet, he sensed something was amiss, something he couldn’t quite put his finger on.

Right! Instructor Li!

Instructor Li was still asleep on the couch!

He wouldn’t have run into this blue-robed youth too, would he? But Instructor Li is just an ordinary person; he could actually die!

Please don’t die, Instructor Li!

Then, Scholar Song’s vision went dark as he was knocked unconscious by the lightning…

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Instructor Li slowly opened his eyes.

“Hmm? Where is this?” He looked around, puzzled by the desert scenery.

Wait—desert!

What happened? How did I end up in a desert?

Let me piece together my recent memories—I seemed to have agreed to take two rich novices flying due to my urgent need for money. This morning, after signing the contract with my colleagues, I was waiting for the two wealthy students to come to learn how to fly.

Then, I met the two wealthy students. One was a handsome young man, and the other was a friendly-looking university student.

After that, my memories went blank… Oh, I vaguely remember some indistinct Western faces, but I can’t recall what exactly happened.

“What’s going on? How did I end up in the desert? Am I dreaming?” Instructor Li rubbed his temples and reached down to scoop up some sand.

The feel of the grains slipping through his fingers sent a jolt of reality to his brain. Instructor Li pinched his thigh—ow! This isn’t a dream; he really had been dumped in the desert.

Could it be that an accident occurred while flying with the two students, and the plane crashed into the desert?

But wait, there’s no desert near Jiangnan!

“Little White, you’re awake!” At that moment, a crisp male voice rang out beside Instructor Li.

He turned to see a blue-robed youth sitting not far away, dressed in ancient attire, with a pure white horse beside him!

What a handsome young man! Is this some sort of filming for a period drama?

And who is Little White? Is he calling me?

“Little White, where did you run off to? I thought you were going to get lost.” The blue-robed youth squinted and smiled.

“Wait a second, kid. Are you calling me Little White?” Instructor Li pointed to himself, confused. “You must have mistaken me for someone else.”

My name is Li Xihua, a young flight instructor at the aviation school, and I’m unmarried.

I have a great reputation at the aviation school, and everyone affectionately calls me Little Li.

But strange things have been happening lately—first, I was mistaken for Anthony, and now someone’s calling me Little White. What on earth is Little White?

Wait, hold on!

What’s Anthony supposed to mean??

That day, Instructor Li discovered something terrifying—strange fragments of memory seemed to have appeared in his mind. Or maybe, he felt like he was missing many memories?

…

…

But the blue-robed youth seemed not to hear Instructor Li’s protests; he turned and pulled a steel sword from his horse, tossing it toward Instructor Li!

“Little White, let’s practice swordsmanship, okay?” The blue-robed youth said, pulling out another steel sword from the horse!
