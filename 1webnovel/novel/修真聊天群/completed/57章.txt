**Mighty Man Nan Haomeng**

It turns out that even a newly initiated cultivator is no longer an ordinary person. After consuming the refining body liquid twice and practicing the *Vajra Foundation Fist* and *True Self Meditation Scripture*, Scholar Song not only found his physical fitness greatly enhanced, but his alcohol tolerance had skyrocketed as well.

Previously, he could only hold his own against the likes of Gao and others, but today, he confidently knocked down the cunning Lin Tubo and Li Yangde after they had too much to drink.

After finishing off those two, Scholar Song felt remarkably clear-headed, his thoughts sharp, and his limbs agile. It was as if he hadn’t just downed a box and a half of alcohol, but merely a glass of plain water.

He hoisted the three drunken guys onto the bed.

After rinsing his mouth, he got up and headed back to his dorm—he had no interest in squeezing into a bed with three drunks.

As he walked alone, he found himself, without realizing it, back in the chaotic alleys of the Dajijie district.

"I shouldn't run into that wall-slammed girl again, should I? After all, I already encountered her this afternoon," he thought to himself. Unless she was lurking around here all day waiting to be wall-slammed, it was unlikely they would cross paths so often.

The journey was peaceful.

“This is a truly peaceful world,” he nodded to himself, wishing every day could be this tranquil.

Speaking of which, he hadn't encountered any trouble when searching for a house with the Alchemical Sage earlier. It had also been peaceful then.

Oh, wait! Remembering the Alchemical Sage brought something to mind.

When he was out with the Alchemical Sage, it hadn’t been entirely peaceful, as there had been someone tailing them, only to be scared off by a glance from the Sage.

With that thought, Scholar Song rubbed his chin.

Moments later, he suddenly turned around, his gaze sharp. “Come out! You've been sneaking behind me for quite a while, haven’t you? Or do you want me to pull you out myself?”

This action was merely a spontaneous impulse on Scholar Song's part.

In truth, he had just begun his foundation building. Although his eyesight and other senses were significantly sharper than those of an ordinary person, he was still a novice without much combat experience, incapable of detecting if someone was following him.

He just wanted to bluff a little.

If no one was behind him, then great; no one would notice his ‘shameful’ act.

And if someone did show themselves, he could wrap up this little situation neatly.

At the same time, Scholar Song discreetly opened his phone to the dialing page, pulling up the Alchemical Sage's number from yesterday.

This way, if something did go awry, he could quickly call for help. Though it might be a bit embarrassing, if his life were at stake, he could easily throw his pride out the window.

Scholar Song kept his gaze locked on the area behind him.

After a moment, a figure indeed emerged from a blind spot.

“Impressive! I’ve hidden so well, yet you still found me,” the figure said, revealing a two-meter tall man, broad-shouldered and muscular.

He had a fierce bald head that exuded an overwhelming aura. However… strangely, this guy gave Scholar Song a sense of ‘peaceful demeanor.’

Yes, despite his intimidating size and physique, the man’s face somehow conveyed a ‘simple and lovable’ vibe.

What a bizarre contrast!

Moreover, this hulking figure had been able to silently follow Scholar Song from behind—his stealth and sneaking skills must have been maxed out!

“Who are you, and why are you following me?” Scholar Song squinted, eyeing the massive man's bulging muscles, filled with explosive power.

“No need to be so tense, Scholar Song. I’m also a student from Jiangnan University City, the vice president of the Sanda Club—Nan Haomeng.” The big man introduced himself and flexed his fist. “The reason I’m following you is because last night, there were two useless guys from my club who were harassing a girl, and they got schooled by you, Scholar Song…”

“Oh, so your little brothers come crying to you when they get bullied, and you, as their big brother, want to take revenge, right?” Scholar Song replied.

If it had been Scholar Song two days ago, seeing a hulking figure like this with a menacing fist would have made him run for his life.

But now, having consumed the refining body liquid twice and practiced the *Vajra Foundation Fist* and *True Self Meditation Scripture*, he felt no fear—only a fierce fighting spirit.

Besides, since this guy was the ‘big brother’ of those troublemakers, he couldn't possibly be the one who had investigated him at school the day before, because Scholar Song had encountered those troublemakers wall-slamming the short-haired girl the previous night.

“Haha, of course not! Those two wouldn’t dare to mention the harassment to me. I only found out because I overheard their conversation. Those useless guys were hanging out with the wrong crowd, and they didn’t know they shouldn’t mess with a girl who couldn’t even fight back. I gave them a good beating afterward; they won’t be getting out of bed for a while,” Nan Haomeng said with a simple smile.

A girl who couldn’t fight back? Big guy, you haven’t seen that girl unleash her power. If you had seen her take down eleven troublemakers in ten seconds this afternoon, you wouldn't be labeling her as ‘harmless.’

“Then why are you following me?” Scholar Song pressed, his voice low.

“Well, I’ve heard from those useless guys that you’re quite impressive, Scholar. So I wanted to see for myself,” Nan Haomeng said, still wearing his naive smile. He was born with incredible strength; not only was he big, but his power was also double that of someone his size. In the Sanda Club, he was already considered a top-notch fighter.

So, when he heard about someone who could lift his useless little brother with one arm, his instincts told him he had found a worthy opponent. Thus, he had followed him here.

Now, seeing Scholar Song up close, he was more convinced of that thought—this seemingly shorter and thinner junior was indeed a master!

“Of course, you could also think of it as me wanting to stand up for my little brothers. If that makes you feel better, then we can have a good fight. Anyway, I do have intentions of standing up for them,” Nan Haomeng said, assuming a fighting stance, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

In an instant, he transformed from a harmless giant into a ferocious beast.

“You’ve been rambling for so long; so you just want to fight, right?” Scholar Song said.

“Yes, I just want to fight,” Nan Haomeng grinned widely. “By the way… all that rambling was just because you wanted me to. In reality, I’m not much of a talker; I prefer to let my fists do the talking.”

Scholar Song: “…”

If you’re not much of a talker, then why did you say so much? What level of chatterbox would that make you?

“I’m coming at you!” Nan Haomeng took a sliding step closer, his right fist ready to unleash a powerful straight punch.

Scholar Song didn’t dare to underestimate him. Today, he had just officially begun his foundation building and wouldn’t look down on this Sanda giant.

As Nan Haomeng threw his straight punch, Scholar Song swiftly turned his wrist and executed the basic fist technique.

He clawed his hand into a grip, his fingers dancing like a dragon.

With a precise movement, he seized Nan Haomeng’s wrist, effectively halting the advancing punch before it could go even an inch further.

Nan Haomeng felt a sharp pain in his wrist; Scholar Song’s grip felt as strong as a steel clamp. Typically, he could easily toss someone of Scholar Song’s size with one arm. He struggled a few times, but Scholar Song’s grip remained unyielding.

At that moment, Scholar Song furrowed his brow—this guy was weak!

Weak as a feather.

Despite his massive size and the force behind his punch, the actual power felt like he was grappling with a child.
