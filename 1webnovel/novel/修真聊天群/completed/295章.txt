**YES... NO!**

Just as Scholar Song's heart felt like a thousand galloping steeds racing through his chest, he heard the voice of Tu Bo from behind cry out, “Scholar Song, look! Words have appeared on the metal door!”

Scholar Song turned his head and saw a shimmering layer of light manifesting on the intricately designed metal door.

The light revealed a string of bizarre characters.

These characters were neither Chinese, nor English, nor any other mainstream script from around the world, but somehow, everyone present could eerily understand the meaning behind these words.

“Do you miss home? Do you long for the warmth of home? Do you wish to instantly return to that place you think about day and night... home? Wandering traveler, make your choice—YES or NO.”

Make your choice, make your choice! Those three words echoed in everyone’s minds like a spell.

Everyone exchanged glances and then simultaneously looked at Scholar Song.

Having witnessed Scholar Song single-handedly slay two giant eagles, the passengers instinctively thought of him when faced with this strange situation.

Scholar Song frowned and speculated, “Could this be the way to open the door? Or... is this a method to leave this island?”

Given that the choice appearing on the door was most likely related to opening it, the tone of these words seemed to imply sending someone back home.

Tu Bo suggested, “How about we try pressing ‘YES’? If the door opens, we can enter the ancient city.”

“Wait, Tu Bo. What if this is a way to leave the island? Where would we end up after leaving? And how would we leave? What if a passage suddenly opens beneath our feet and we fall through?” Gao Moumou asked, holding his girlfriend Mei Yi tightly, his worry evident.

Everyone turned once more to Scholar Song.

Scholar Song shrugged, “I don’t know.”

He wasn’t a miraculous prophet or a magic mirror, after all.

At that moment, an older man pushed his way forward, laughing heartily, “Whether it’s opening the door or going home, I’m all for it! Let me give it a try—YES, I want to go home!”

Saying this, the older man firmly pressed his palm against the ‘YES’ option.

In the next instant, he suddenly felt a warmth enveloping his entire body.

So warm, it felt like he was back in his mother’s loving embrace from childhood.

“Ah… is this the warmth of home?” he exclaimed in a melodious tone.

However, the other passengers looked at him with horror in their eyes.

The older man looked down at his body—oh, no!

A flame-like glow ignited around him, the warmth he felt earlier was coming from those fiery rays.

And that glow seemed so familiar... wasn’t it the same fiery light that enveloped the passengers who had vanished on the plane? After that fiery glow consumed them, they turned into particles of light and disappeared, their fates unknown.

Is this what they mean by [the warmth of home]? Warm my ass, warm your whole family tree!

In the end, the older man turned to Scholar Song, his dark face reflecting an oddly sacred aura in the firelight, “Dude, am I going to die?”

Scholar Song paused for a moment, then replied seriously, “It seems... you are about to leave this island. If you think about it, maybe the people who disappeared on the plane weren’t dead, but sent away instead. Perhaps the next moment you wake up, you’ll find yourself back home!”

Even if he were to die... at least give the older man some psychological comfort.

Would a heart filled with resentment become a vengeful spirit?

Just then, the speakers on the city wall emitted a harsh buzzing sound.

Then a powerful, heavy voice boomed, “You vile creature, get out!”

As soon as the words were spoken, the older man’s body transformed into particles of light, dissipating like flowing sand.

He was so compliant!

“Fuck you, you vile creature!” the older man flipped the bird toward the city wall, roaring with his last ounce of strength.

Scholar Song: “…”

Tu Bo: “…”

Gao Moumou: “…”

The remaining passengers: “…”

By the way, this older man’s Chinese was quite awkward, yet he understood a relatively obscure insult like ‘vile creature.’ Is learning Chinese a trend among foreigners these days?

...

...

Soon, the older man disappeared without a trace.

Everyone fell into silence.

At that moment, a little boy turned to Scholar Song, “Brother Scholar Song, did that uncle really go home?”

The little boy’s big, dark eyes were so pure.

Scholar Song gently patted his head, “I can’t be sure what happened. Maybe he went home, or maybe he just vanished.”

“Thank you, brother.” The little boy beamed with a bright smile, then suddenly ran under the door, stood on tiptoe, and forcefully pressed his small hand against the ‘YES’ option.

“Goodbye, everyone! I’m going to find my dad and mom now.” The boy was enveloped in a fiery glow and waved goodbye to the crowd.

His father and mother had already turned into particles of light on the plane.

This little guy had been following everyone without crying or making a fuss, a very understanding child. He was the type of well-behaved kid that Scholar Song liked, completely different from his own cousin, a seemingly serious little monk who was actually a little troublemaker. He belonged to the “I wish I could take him home and raise him” category.

...

...

The little boy also vanished in a swirl of light.

After the older man and the little boy pressed ‘YES’ and left, the others remained frozen in place, hesitant to approach the two treacherous options again.

After all, they couldn’t be sure if pressing ‘YES’ meant truly leaving the island or turning into particles of light and dying. Naturally, no one would make such a reckless choice.

Life is precious; it’s not a game where you can respawn after death.

“Well, if the ‘YES’ option leads to disappearance, then perhaps the ‘NO’ option is the way to open the door,” Scholar Song suggested.

He took a step forward, ready to press the ‘NO’ option.

“Wait, Scholar Song.” At that moment, Tu Bo stopped him, “Let me do it… If you press ‘NO’ and turn into light particles, then no one will be able to deal with those giant eagles if they attack again. So, let me handle it.”

“No, let me do it,” Scholar Song replied softly, “At least I have some means to defend myself. Even if I do end up turning into light particles, I have ways to protect myself…”

Just then, a figure came running breathlessly from outside the city gate. It was his disciple, Joseph.

“Master, I’m here! Master has something to attend to, and I’m here to help!” Joseph called out loudly, raising his hand.

Then he quickly dashed toward the door, reaching out to slap the ‘NO’ option.

Joseph’s daughter had disappeared on the plane... so if it meant turning into particles of light, he wouldn’t mind. Perhaps he might just find his daughter in the process.

And if he didn’t turn into light, he could stick around with Scholar Song for a while longer, which wouldn’t be bad either.

“Master!” After Joseph pressed the ‘NO’ option, he said, “If we survive leaving here, can I move near your home?”

Joseph took the opportunity to make his request.

Previously, he had watched Scholar Song explode the air with a single punch, creating a deafening sound, and felt incredibly excited. He thought that if he could reach Scholar Song's level in his lifetime, he would have no regrets, even if he died.

But today, after witnessing Scholar Song’s fiery blade that cleaved the eagle’s head, he was completely fired up. The martial arts of Middle Land could achieve such heights! This was beyond ‘martial arts’; it was in the realm of the superhuman!

He had to seize this opportunity. Even if he had to be shameless about it, he would find a way to live near his master. Joseph resolved in his heart.

He had already decided—regardless of whether Scholar Song agreed, he would buy a house near him after leaving the island.

“Sure,” Scholar Song replied readily.

Having more neighbors wouldn’t be a bad thing... and if one day he managed to cultivate to a higher level and wanted to take his family away from the mundane world, he would consider taking Joseph along if their fates aligned.

In that case, Scholar Song wouldn’t mind that Joseph wanted to live nearby.

Joseph looked satisfied.

A moment later...

“Hmm? Why hasn’t anything happened yet?” Joseph wondered, pressing the ‘NO’ option repeatedly without any response.

Joseph, not giving up, slapped the ‘NO’ option several more times.

Still no response?

He pressed again!

Slap, slap, slap—Joseph hit the option a dozen times.

Finally... there was a reaction!

A new line of text appeared on the shimmering door: [Are you trying to slap a dead man’s head, hoping to reincarnate? Can’t you see how heavy this door is? It takes a lot of effort to open it!]

Joseph: “…”

Scholar Song: “…”

Gao Moumou, Tu Bo, Mei Yi, the Lu sisters, and the other passengers: “…”

“However, if ‘NO’ is to open the door, then could it be that ‘YES’ really sends people back home?” Gao Moumou said, pinching the bridge of his nose.

After all, with the appearance of the giant eagles, everyone’s previously established beliefs had shattered in an instant. Perhaps that light transformation was indeed a means of sending people home through ‘spatial transmission’ or something similar?

Establishing a worldview is difficult... but shattering it is all too easy. That’s the ease of destruction against the backdrop of hard-earned construction.

The slightly plump flight attendant’s eyes lit up upon hearing this. She quickly ran forward, seizing the chance while the door was still closed and the words on the shimmering screen were still illuminated, and forcefully slapped her hand against the ‘YES’ option.
