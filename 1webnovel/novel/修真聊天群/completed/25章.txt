**Two Boxes of Medicinal Ingredients!**

At first glance, most people would definitely remember Fay Yu for her long, beautiful legs. However, after spending some time together, what comes to mind when thinking of her is that adorable smile she flashes when her cheeks turn a lovely shade of red. It's simply endearing.

At that moment, Tu Bo and two other guys stood up, quickly walking over to Scholar Song's side, and asked, "Hey, Scholar, is there something going on?"

These were Scholar Song's three dorm roommates. Seeing a big guy approaching Scholar Song, they felt a mix of curiosity and concern.

“It’s nothing much, just a delivery. I have two packages to sign for,” Scholar Song replied with a smile. He then turned back to Sima Jiang and asked, “Hey, Jiang, where are the boxes?”

Sima Jiang… The corner of the suited man's mouth twitched. It had been years since anyone had dared to call him that. He never expected to hear it again, especially from a young guy.

Nevertheless, he forced a smile, revealing his teeth. “They’ve already been placed at your dorm’s entrance. We’re just waiting for you to come over and accept them.”

“Well then, shall we go? I have a fifteen-minute break between classes,” Scholar Song suggested.

Sima Jiang chuckled heartily, “I was just waiting for you to say that!”

…

…

At the entrance of the boys' dormitory on the second floor, four men in black suits stood guard over two boxes, each measuring 80 by 80 centimeters, their expressions serious.

Scholar Song was taken aback. “Is the service of Fengshou Express always this good?”

With service like this, do other delivery services even stand a chance?

“Ha ha, our service has always been top-notch. But this time, the client is quite special, so our service is even better,” Sima Jiang replied with a hearty laugh.

“Thanks for your hard work,” Scholar Song nodded and approached the two large boxes, glancing at the delivery slip.

Sure enough, the sender's name read ‘Fay Yu’. But the recipient's address was completely blank.

These two boxes likely contained the raw materials for the ‘Simplified Body Refinement Liquid’ that Fay Yu had promised to make for him.

“Do you need to open them and check?” Sima Jiang asked politely.

In reality, there was no need to open them. Even if Sima Jiang was given a pair of dragon hearts and tiger guts, he wouldn’t dare to open them without permission.

“Ha, no need. If there’s a problem, I can just contact you directly,” Scholar Song waved the business card in his hand.

“Of course, if everything’s alright, could you please sign here, Scholar Song?” Sima Jiang said, his fondness for Scholar Song increasing as he pointed at the delivery slip with a smile.

“Sure.” Scholar Song reached out and quickly signed his name.

“Well then, goodbye, Scholar Song. Wishing you a pleasant day,” Sima Jiang waved and turned to leave with the four men in black.

Scholar Song felt that these five guys didn’t seem like regular delivery workers; each of them looked incredibly cool, almost inhuman.

He opened the door to his dorm room. “Oh no, I forgot to have them help carry these two boxes inside. They wouldn't be heavy, would they?”

He had a vivid memory of that large box from Fay Yu and was worried that these two boxes would weigh a ton.

Picking up the two large boxes, he found them surprisingly light.

He carried them one by one back to his bed in the dorm.

After shutting the door, Scholar Song couldn’t contain his excitement and opened the cardboard boxes. Inside were beautifully crafted wooden boxes. Each large box contained four layers, with four small wooden boxes per layer. In total, there were thirty-two small wooden boxes across the two large boxes.

Carefully opening the small wooden boxes, he discovered neatly organized medicinal herbs—over forty different types.

There were familiar items like ginseng, goji berries, Yangqi stone, and daughter’s fragrance, as well as herbs he had never seen before. Just the scent of them felt refreshing, as if his body had been cleansed by the fragrant aroma. These must be the mystical ingredients like Fresh Tyrant Branch and Nine Suns Red Flame Bamboo slices.

Staring at the two boxes of medicinal herbs, Scholar Song found himself in a daze…

Just considering the ginseng slices alone in these two large boxes represented a significant fortune. Meanwhile, the Morning Dew Mystic Grass, Tyrant Branch, and Nine Suns Red Flame Bamboo were likely worth a hundred times more than ginseng.

But the value wasn’t the reason for his daze.

He only had one thought in his mind—were these ingredients truly the ones needed for the ‘Simplified Body Refinement Liquid’?

Could he use these herbs, following the method introduced by the alchemists in the Ninefold Land group, to brew the simplified refinement liquid in a big pot, paying attention to the temperature?

What kind of effects did the body refinement liquid possess? Could it really transform a person as described in various cultivator fantasy stories?

“Perhaps with these ingredients and the alchemist’s formula, I could finally confirm whether cultivation really exists!”

A thought sparked in Scholar Song’s mind, igniting a fire within him that couldn't be extinguished.

Scholar Song considered himself open-minded. If the body refinement liquid truly had such miraculous effects, he would be willing to believe in the existence of cultivation.

And once he was convinced that cultivation existed, what should he do next?

“I don’t have any classes this afternoon. There are a total of forty-five types of herbs, and if each one takes about five minutes, that means it’ll take me around three to four hours. I can give it a try this afternoon!”

Scholar Song was the kind of person who acted on his thoughts. Since he had made up his mind, he was determined to turn his ideas into action!

“If I’m going to brew the liquid, I should first have a… alchemy furnace?”

Alchemy furnaces were definitely not sold in stores; they might be available on Taobao, but what could be bought there would surely be mere toys.

So if he wanted to brew the body refinement liquid this afternoon, finding an actual alchemy furnace was impractical; he needed a substitute.

Scholar Song headed to the small kitchen to look around.

Soon, he spotted something that could simmer the herbs… a hot pot.

But as soon as the thought crossed his mind, he quickly dismissed it. “No way, this thing is way too different from an alchemy furnace.”

He had never seen an alchemy furnace and had no idea whether it resembled those depicted in movies. But regardless, it should at least be a furnace; a hot pot was just too far off.

Setting the hot pot aside, he continued his search in the small kitchen.

After a long while, he still came up empty-handed.

Rice cookers, electric kettles, frying pans, pressure cookers—none of them could replace an alchemy furnace.

While the pressure cooker looked quite sturdy, it was meant for high-pressure steaming and couldn’t be opened during cooking. But brewing the body refinement liquid required adding a new herb every five minutes.

In the end, after much deliberation, the only thing that seemed somewhat suitable was—Scholar Song reluctantly stared at the hot pot.

“Hey, it’s only going to be used for simmering, so maybe I can give it a shot?” He scratched his chin, thinking that with thirty-two ingredients, even if the attempt failed, he could accept that!

Though it felt a bit wasteful since these herbs seemed quite valuable.

“Let’s give it a try; if I don’t, I’ll never know if I can succeed. And if I do try, even if I fail, I can consider it an experience.” Scholar Song made up his mind.

This afternoon, he would go for it!

He sincerely hoped his roommates wouldn’t mind him tinkering in the kitchen; perhaps he should find a quiet place outside to try it out?

But for now, he had to finish his last class of the morning.

Scholar Song opened his storage box and began placing the medicinal materials from the two large boxes into the storage compartment, one by one.

The school-provided storage box was just the right size. After he emptied it of his personal belongings, he could fit all the medicinal materials inside perfectly.

“Thank goodness! Otherwise, I wouldn’t know where to hide all this stuff.” Scholar Song thought to himself.
