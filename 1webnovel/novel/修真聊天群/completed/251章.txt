**Absolutely Forbidden!**

“Haha, I just accidentally twisted my waist a bit. I’ll be fine soon,” Scholar Song chuckled awkwardly as he settled into his seat, carefully gripping Mistress Scallion. At the same time, he slipped the fist-sized stone that might be the ‘Stone of Enlightenment’ into his pocket.

Zhao Yayao casually asked, “By the way, did you get that tractor sorted out yet?”

She hadn’t gotten out of the car earlier, and her line of sight hadn’t caught the wreckage of the tractor that had burned to scrap metal, nor the signs of the recent explosion, which is why she asked.

“Hahaha, there was a little mishap with the tractor afterward. But no worries, I’ll just call a friend to help out shortly,” Scholar Song continued to chuckle nervously.

“Oh,” Zhao Yayao nodded, “Scholar, you’ve changed quite a bit lately, haven’t you? When I visited you back in June, you seemed shorter. And where did you learn those agile moves? You’re like a monkey now!”

She had countless questions for Scholar Song, whether it was about how he managed to easily carry Father Song and Old Lu up the hill or how that tractor could outpace a sports car…

But more than the tractor, she was curious about his newfound agility.

“Hehe, when you visited me in June, I was really committed to exercising! Without realizing it, I’ve gotten in shape,” Scholar Song laughed heartily. “Also, a good friend of mine sent me some amazing stuff recently. I’ll let you try it when we get home.”

He was referring to the ‘Spirit Vein Green Tea,’ and since he ran into Zhao Yayao, it was the perfect opportunity to share with her.

“Good stuff?” A smile crept onto Zhao Yayao's face as she pressed further, “And what’s up with that tractor?”

Scholar Song had anticipated that question and had prepared an answer long ago: “The tractor has been enhanced! The specific process of enhancement is a secret because the technology belongs to my friend. I can’t disclose it without his permission.”

Zhao Yayao nodded in understanding. “Oh, you mean the friend who’s been sleeping since you brought him back?”

“That’s him.” Scholar Song felt a twinge of melancholy as he thought about the Venerable White, who was still in seclusion. He was anxious; what if Venerable White remained in meditation and accidentally manifested that desert again? — He hoped his family wouldn’t have such bad luck.

At the same time, he needed to find Doudou and the little monk quickly.

At the very least, he wanted Doudou to set up a defensive barrier in his room so that Venerable White’s desert wouldn’t leak out.

Right, he had already arrived in Wenzhou City, so he should give Doudou a call.

With that thought, Scholar Song pulled out his phone and made a call.

This time, Doudou picked up quickly.

“Hello, is this Scholar Song?” Instead of Doudou's voice, it was Zhou Li, who was handling Doudou's troubles.

“Ah, Senior Zhou Li! Where’s Doudou?” Scholar Song asked, puzzled.

“He just took the little monk Guoguo to the hospital for a hemorrhoid surgery, so he handed the phone to me for now. I’m waiting outside for them,” Zhou Li sighed heavily.

Earlier that day, he had just helped Doudou deal with a traffic accident, and now Doudou had summoned him again.

He thought it was something important, but when he arrived, he learned it was just to accompany the little monk for a hospital visit — since the little monk was too young, an adult had to be there to sign and register.

Zhou Li couldn’t help but laugh and cry at the same time.

Scholar Song comforted him, “You’ve worked hard, Senior Zhou Li.”

“Thanks.” Zhou Li sighed again and added, “Doudou said the little monk would need to come back for treatment tomorrow. I’ll bring them over to you around tomorrow afternoon, okay?”

“That’s great! You’re a lifesaver!” Scholar Song replied.

With this, he wouldn’t have to make a special trip to pick them up.

“It’s no trouble; it’s what I’m supposed to do,” Zhou Li chuckled. Then, lowering his voice so Scholar Song could hear, he mumbled, “Honestly, I sometimes wish I could take a vacation, even just for a week…”

“No problem, Senior Zhou Li. I promise that once Doudou is with me, I won’t let him cause any trouble for a week,” Scholar Song assured him.

“Thank you! Scholar, thank you!” Zhou Li expressed his gratitude.

“You’re welcome! Actually… Senior Zhou Li, I just had a little mishap here too. The tractor that Venerable Song returned got a bit out of hand and ended up in a ravine. When you come over, I’d like to ask for your help to handle the accident scene. No need to trouble two masters,” Scholar Song said, a bit embarrassed for causing more trouble.

“Venerable Song? Oh, oh, Venerable White! No problem, I’ll take care of it once I’m there,” Zhou Li readily agreed.

“Then it’s settled. See you later, Senior Zhou Li.” Scholar Song breathed a sigh of relief after hanging up.

After he ended the call, Zhao Yayao casually asked, “Is that friend of yours who’s handling the tractor?”

“Yeah, that’s him. He’ll help with the accident scene recovery when he gets here. I’m really sorry to bother him again,” Scholar Song chuckled sheepishly.

On the other side.

At the Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center.

Xiao Li finally woke up from unconsciousness. As soon as he regained consciousness, he shot up from the bed, his muscles taut with tension!

Huh? Why did I jump up from bed like that? Xiao Li was confused.

Then he noticed a group of people sitting around his bedside, including Kessili and several flight instructors from the school.

They were all crammed into the small staff lounge, looking at Xiao Li with the same curiosity one might have when observing a giant panda.

Kessili beamed at him, “Xiao Li, you’re finally awake!”

Seeing her smile, Xiao Li felt a slight flush on his face — Kessili, the Western beauty, was the goddess of the Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center and the object of admiration for many flight instructors, including Xiao Li.

“So, Xiao Li, what happened between you and those two wealthy guys these past few days? Where did they take you?” One of the instructors couldn’t wait to ask.

“Wealthy guys? Where did they take me?” Xiao Li was puzzled, frowning as he tried to recall, but his memory seemed oddly fragmented.

His last recollection was climbing into a helicopter with the two wealthy individuals. But after that, it was all blank.

Feeling the eager gazes of his colleagues, Xiao Li sensed something was off and asked back, “Did something major happen while I was gone?”

“You don’t know?” One of the flight instructors stared at him in disbelief and pulled out a prepared video: “This is the footage of the American Alliance's space capsule safely landing back on Earth.”

In the video, two astronauts in space suits were seated in their chairs.

In the background, the sound of cheering from the crowd could be faintly heard: “Akuro, Akuro!”

In the video, one of the astronauts removed his helmet, revealing a shiny bald head as he waved to the crowd.

The crowd cheered again, “Anthony, Anthony!”

Anthony? That name sounded familiar. Xiao Li furrowed his brow even tighter. Why did thinking of that name make him feel a wave of pain, as if he had suffered some harsh punishment?

In the video, the second astronaut struggled to remove his helmet.

After a moment, with the help of the staff, the helmet finally came off.

Under the space suit was the astonished face of an Asian man!

In reality, Xiao Li was frozen — wasn’t that me?!

“Is that me?” Xiao Li asked.

“You’re asking us? We want to ask you!” Kessili and the other instructors replied in unison.

“Why can’t I remember anything? Damn it, I think I’ve lost my memory.” Xiao Li rubbed his temples vigorously.

Kessili and the flight instructors exchanged glances.

Xiao Li didn’t look like he was pretending… he genuinely seemed to have lost his memory.

“Damn it, Anthony… Anthony. What the heck is Anthony?” Xiao Li gritted his teeth.

As soon as he said that, he felt another half-sentence escape his lips without thinking: “And what the heck is Xiaobai?!”

“Xiaobai? Are you talking about the ‘Song Bai’ from the two wealthy guys?” Kessili immediately pulled out the information on the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain that she had received from Venerable White and handed it to Xiao Li.

“Song Bai? Song Bai?” Xiao Li pressed his finger hard against his temple, racking his brain for memories.

“Anthony, Anthony… Xiaobai, Xiaobai… Song Bai, Song Bai?”

In his mind, it felt like some fragments from his memory were being unearthed, but they were too fragmented for him to piece together.

A white horse… right, the desert… a young man in a green robe… and martial arts? Then, oh, the pain! I was beaten up!!

Tears suddenly streamed down Xiao Li’s face.

“Huh? Why am I crying?” Xiao Li wondered aloud, wiping away the tears at the corners of his eyes — but no matter how hard he tried, they wouldn’t stop. It was as if a faucet had been turned on, and they just kept flowing.

“Why do I feel so sad? Why can’t I stop crying?” Xiao Li was puzzled.

Around him, Kessili and the flight instructors stared at him in shock — they had an instinct that Xiao Li seemed to have gone through a very sad story.

Zhao Yayao’s sports car parked in front of Scholar Song's house.

“Let’s go, we need to hurry upstairs. Uncle is waiting for you to save the day,” Zhao Yayao said with a smile.

“Coming right away!” Scholar Song tightened his grip on Mistress Scallion, lowering his voice to threaten, “Remember, once we’re at my place, absolutely do not reveal your true form. Don’t let anyone find out you’re a fairy. Otherwise… don’t blame me for being rude!”

Mistress Scallion trembled at his words, frightened…
