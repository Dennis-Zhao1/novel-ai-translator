**Did I Just Time Travel?**

"If the frost on the surface of the girl's body had just begun to form, I could have intervened to save her. But now, unless I cultivate to a level where I can display my divine abilities, like an Eighth-Rank Sage, there's no way to save her," the Master of Snow Wolf Cavern said sincerely.

Apart from him, there were others in the group who practiced ice spells, but none were specialists. The only true authority on ice magic was the Master of Snow Wolf Cavern, the recognized expert in their circle.

"So what’s the principle behind this cold energy? Is it an issue with one of her organs?" Scholar Song tentatively asked. If magic couldn't solve it, maybe technology could? After all, the Three-Star Fire Fan was a fusion of science and cultivation.

"Are you suggesting we perform surgery to replace an organ, my young friend? That's pointless. The frost has already formed an ice coffin on her body; the cold energy has permeated every inch of her being and may even affect her soul. Are you planning to replace her entire body and soul?" The Master of Snow Wolf Cavern shattered Scholar Song's hopes without mercy.

"Ah, what a sad story," Scholar Song sighed. "Senior Li Tiansu, don’t blame me! I’m powerless to help! Please don’t come back as a vengeful spirit to haunt me!"

As a good person, he felt helpless.

……

……

Breakfast was a carefully prepared meal by the charming young master of the Empty Thief Sect.

Today, she still wore a bright smile, though it seemed she had regained some of her spirit compared to yesterday.

Scholar Song secretly let out a sigh of relief. If this girl really became a complete idiot, he wouldn't know how to handle her. He couldn't just let her be a cook for life.

Before leaving, Scholar Song waved goodbye to Dou Dou and Venerable White. "I’m off now. Dou Dou, don't cause any trouble!"

Dou Dou rolled her eyes and turned to Venerable White, saying, "White Senior, Scholar Song is actually using me as a shield. He’s telling me not to cause trouble, but we all know that’s directed at you!"

Venerable White chuckled awkwardly.

Scholar Song’s hand froze mid-wave—Dou Dou, what are you saying? Some things are better left unsaid! It’s not good to voice such thoughts!

……

……

In Jiangnan University Town, the final exams had begun.

As graduation certificates were at stake, the value of a degree from Jiangnan University Town was quite high, and every student needed to strive for it.

As the exam approached, Scholar Song felt a bit nervous.

In the past, he would cram the night before every exam. But last night, he went to bed early. The shift in his routine made him feel uneasy.

When the exam papers were handed out, Scholar Song started writing furiously, his pen flying across the page…

Before he knew it, he had finished the entire exam paper.

"It seems a bit too easy," Scholar Song thought to himself, glancing around. All the other students were still struggling with their answers.

The only sound in the examination hall was the rustling of paper as pens scratched against it. He looked up at the clock on the wall—oh no, it had only been three minutes.

How fast was his writing to complete a full exam in just three minutes?

What should he do now? The exam required at least half an hour to submit!

Moments later, Scholar Song sighed inwardly. He gripped his pen, assumed the writing position, and closed his eyes to meditate on the "True Self Meditation Scripture." Life is short; one shouldn’t waste time when they can cultivate.

Speaking of the "True Self Meditation Scripture," as he opened his heart and eyes, and after forming a contract with the Phantom Spirit, the image of his 'true self' in the sea of consciousness began to change.

However, instead of becoming more ethereal and transcendent, it evolved in a peculiar direction.

In the conscious space, his true self had a serious expression, with no upper garments, showing off a body sculpted like marble. And it seemed… his hair had gotten shorter?

Something was off! Scholar Song was someone who loved reading and admired the idea of flying through the skies on a sword, living a carefree life as a cultivator. But why was his true self’s image becoming so strange?

Had he not read enough lately, losing some of his scholarly air? That’s it! After the exam, he’d visit the bookstore and catch up on some reading. It had been ages since he visited that rental shop…

Scholar Song mused.

After half an hour of meditating on the "True Self Meditation Scripture," he opened his eyes, submitted his exam paper, and leisurely left the examination hall.

Behind him, the supervising teacher frowned as she looked at Scholar Song, then back at his heavily filled exam paper, falling into deep thought.

She remembered this student… because shortly after the exam papers were distributed, he had maintained one position without moving.

During her rounds, she had even seen him dozing off.

When did he write all those answers?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In the afternoon, during the university English exam, Scholar Song applied what he learned and took his time answering, finishing in half an hour without attracting the teacher's attention this time.

He wandered through a few other classrooms and saw Yang De, Gao, and Tu Bo still hard at work, showing no signs of finishing.

"Forget it, I’ll just check out the rental bookstore," Scholar Song thought.

He easily found his way to the familiar rental bookstore.

Same road; same store; and the same gentle, graceful beauty of a shopkeeper.

Though it had only been a month since he last visited, Scholar Song felt as if a century had passed. Had he really experienced too much in just one month?

Once inside the rental store, he felt at ease as he quickly searched for a few books related to ‘airplanes’ and squatted in a corner of the bookshelf to start reading.

He was scheduled to learn about flying planes with Venerable White soon. Although he had Venerable White’s expertise in "Sword Flight" as a foundation, it wouldn’t hurt to have more knowledge.

At the entrance of the rental store, the beautiful shopkeeper glanced up at Scholar Song—wasn't this the young man who often came to read? Shouldn't he be worried about his exam scores today?

She knew that at Jiangnan University Town, if students failed two retakes and flunked three core subjects, they were sent back with a free return ticket. Or was this young man just confident?

Moreover, had he grown taller? He looked more slender, no longer the slightly chubby figure he had a month ago. His body was now lithe and elegant, resembling a model.

Had he become more handsome? The shopkeeper pondered, then returned her gaze to her book…

……

……

Time flew by, and soon it was evening.

"That was fast," Scholar Song said, grabbing two books and completing the rental process with the shopkeeper, leisurely making his way back.

Upon returning to the Alchemical Sage’s building, Scholar Song inserted the key, opened the door, and stepped inside, casually closing the door behind him.

Then, as he turned around… What the hell was going on?

Before him lay an endless desert, with nothing but yellow sand underfoot.

Am I seeing things? Is this an illusion?

Scholar Song quickly crouched down and scooped up some sand—this was indeed yellow sand! The fine grains slipped through his fingers, confirming it wasn’t an illusion; he was in a real desert!

Is this the doing of Venerable White? That was his first thought, an entirely reasonable conclusion.

"Venerable White? Dou Dou! Are you there?" Scholar Song shouted out.

However, aside from his own echo, there was no response.

After a long moment.

Scholar Song rubbed his forehead. Could it be that Venerable White and Dou Dou were not behind this?

What is this? Did I get spatially transported and ended up in the desert?

Or did I… just time travel?

Scholar Song now found it easy to accept such ‘supernatural’ phenomena. With cultivators truly entering his life, time travel didn’t seem impossible.

But most famous protagonists before their time travel typically faced dissatisfaction in their lives, then suddenly got struck by lightning, electrocuted, or hit by falling meteorites—various deaths leading to their crossing over.

But here I am, Scholar Song, a vibrant college student attending the fine Jiangnan University Town. I was just beginning to explore the real world of ‘cultivation’ and was ready to embark on a grand journey—so why am I time traveling?

Besides, I simply opened the door to the Alchemical Sage’s building and stepped into the courtyard! I wasn’t struck by lightning or crushed by a meteor!

Just opening a door leads to time travel? What is going on?

I’m not prepared to time travel! No, I need to go back!

Scholar Song turned around to see if the door he came through was still there. But turning back revealed only the endless desert—no trace of the door.

Is this how it’s going to end for me?

Now what?

Scholar Song felt his heart racing, yet somehow he managed to stay calm.

"First, I need to determine whether I’ve been ‘spatially transported’ to this desert or if I’ve crossed dimensions and entered some fantasy world. If it’s just ‘spatial transportation’, then there shouldn’t be any problems. But if it’s a dimensional crossover, then we have serious issues," Scholar Song murmured.

Then, he pulled out his phone.

If there’s still signal, it means I’m still on Earth! If there’s no signal…

He checked his phone and, to his dismay, there was no signal at all.

"Stay calm. Don’t panic. Maybe it’s just because I’m in the desert and the signal is weak. From the countless experiences I’ve read, if it’s a dimensional crossover, there’d definitely be two or three moons in the sky. The sky is still bright, so I’ll wait until it gets darker… Wait, where’s the sky?" Scholar Song looked up, only to find a bare expanse above him—no blue sky, no white clouds, just a swirling mass resembling a black hole.

Have I truly crossed over into a world where even the laws of physics have changed?

If I have crossed into another dimension, what am I supposed to do?

Scholar Song scrolled through his phone, regretting that he had deleted all the ‘dimensional travel’ material he had saved.

Otherwise, he might have found a protagonist like him who also landed in a desert, figuring out how to survive and thrive in this new world.

"Calm down. Don’t lose your mind. First, I need to figure out how to survive in this desert," Scholar Song told himself.

But… how can I remain calm?

I’ve time traveled!

This is no dream; he really has time traveled. And he has been thrown into a godforsaken desert!
