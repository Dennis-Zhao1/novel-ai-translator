**The Inch-Long Snake's Shrinking Bag**

"Take, for example, that legendary sword technique, the Eight Styles of the Divine Sword. Although it’s known as the Eight Styles, the ancestral manual only contains seven. The last style? That one has to be deduced and understood by the practitioner based on the previous seven," Scholar Song speculated.

Despite having never encountered a ninth-grade technique, he had absorbed plenty from the realms of xianxia, fantasy, and film! Scholar Song felt like his imagination was bursting at the seams!

"..." The elder remained silent for a moment, then replied, "Sorry, let’s pretend I never asked that question."

With that, the elder’s fingers danced in the air, a heavy voice continuing to resonate. Since Scholar Song had already noticed him reading from a script, he decided to be bold and read openly!

Scholar Song thought, "..."

Elder, you’re too straightforward! I finally made a guess, and you’re just going to reveal it like that? It’s kind of hurtful.

"Ahem, the reason there are no subsequent techniques after the ninth-grade ‘Transcending the Immortals’ is that it represents the limit of what a cultivator can achieve. If the ‘Heavenly Dao’ is left unmastered, then after transcending, it’s a free-for-all as everyone vies for their fate!"

"Only one among them, possessing the ‘Fate of Heaven,’ can transcend and sweep away all foes, standing above the masses, invincible in this world. They will suppress the ages, bear the fate, forge an immortal body, and take control of the ‘New Heavenly Dao.’ In other words, after transcending, one reaches the ‘Heavenly Dao’!"

"But here comes the problem… If there is already a master of the ‘Heavenly Dao’ in this world, then only that one person can bear the fate. Others will be permanently stuck at the ‘Transcending the Immortals’ realm. Though powerful, the ‘Transcending the Immortals’ stage is the limit for cultivators, allowing them to live for millions of years. However, even the ‘Transcending the Immortals’ can’t escape death!" The elder spoke passionately, and if it weren't for his mask, Scholar Song would have suspected the elder's fervor might spray him with spit.

It’s just a script reading, elder! You’ve probably read it countless times already, yet you can still maintain such excitement. Truly a rare talent.

Even though these thoughts raced through his mind, Scholar Song's face lit up with excitement as he applauded vigorously—forget about decorum; let’s toss it aside for now.

After all, it’s just decorum; a good sleep can restore that!

Speaking of sleep, Scholar Song glanced sideways at the girl, Jiu Deng.

She had a serious expression, her two golden lotus flowers supporting her, making her look sacred and beautiful. But Scholar Song noticed her eyes were unfocused, and a hint of transparent liquid lingered at the corner of her mouth.

This was the hallmark of the ‘Sleeping God Technique’—she was already in a deep slumber.

Had she been forcing herself to nod off earlier to attract the elder's attention? Now she was quietly sitting to the side, peacefully asleep?

Suddenly, Scholar Song had an epiphany.

……

With Scholar Song's applause, the elder became even more excited.

"So, the ancient transcenders frantically sought methods to achieve ‘immortality’ and ‘longevity’ even under a master of the Heavenly Dao. They didn’t seek true immortality, just a chance to prolong their lives."

"The ancient transcenders developed many methods, and several powerful transcenders with the ‘Fate of Heaven’ created their own ‘Dao.’ These transcenders, if the ‘Heavenly Dao’ was unmastered, had the capability to contend for fate and grasp the Heavenly Dao! Take my old friend, Chi Xiaozi, for instance. He was the most talented individual I ever met with a clear ‘Fate of Heaven.’ Even back when he was an eighth-grade Mystic Sage, he was already practicing his own ‘Path to Longevity.’ However, most of the ‘Paths to Longevity’ developed by these fated transcenders were tailored just for themselves."

At this point, the elder finally closed that invisible ‘script’ and began to speak without notes.

"And me? I’m a dullard, wasting countless years without ever finding a way to practice my ‘Path to Longevity.’ In the end, I turned my gaze toward the ‘Heavenly Court.’"

"At this point, you should be able to guess. The ancient Heavenly Court was the ‘Emperor of Heaven’s’ path to longevity! The entire structure of the Heavenly Court was constructed by the Emperor of Heaven using ‘True Illusions’ fused with countless divine materials. Later, many powerful figures above the seventh grade joined under the Emperor of Heaven, using their own ‘True Illusions’ to supplement and perfect the ancient Heavenly Court, collectively establishing the ‘Heavenly Court.’"

"True Illusions are ethereal yet possess real characteristics. Once the Heavenly Court was established, it transcended the myriad realms, becoming an independent world unaffected by the ‘Heavenly Dao.’ Without the Heavenly Dao’s influence, the Emperor of Heaven perfected his ‘Path to Longevity.’ Not only him, but all powerful cultivators who joined him gained the opportunity to access the secrets of ‘Longevity’ and the qualifications to ascend to a ‘Longevity’ realm. To be honest, the Emperor of Heaven truly deserves to be called the greatest genius beneath the ‘Heavenly Dao’ in all of history. His ‘Path to Longevity’ is not limited to himself; it encompasses all! He and the Heavenly Court are one— the more powerful members that join the court, the stronger it becomes; the stronger the court, the stronger the Emperor of Heaven!"

As the elder spoke, he gently caressed the rabbit in his hands, letting out a deep sigh.

"The chance to access the ‘Secrets of Longevity’?" Scholar Song couldn’t help but glance more intently at the elder.

The elder looked back at Scholar Song and chuckled, "What a perceptive little fellow. Yes… I was once a member of the Heavenly Court. So, I was fortunate enough to grasp the secrets of ‘Longevity’ while at the seventh-grade Sage level. The Heavenly Court’s destruction happened overnight—many members scattered outside at that time, avoiding the catastrophe. I was one of them. But none of us knew how the Heavenly Court fell."

Scholar Song nodded thoughtfully.

Having once been a part of the Heavenly Court and obtaining fragments of the original court’s wisdom is likely why the elder considered the arduous path of ‘rebuilding the Heavenly Court.’

At that moment, Jiu Deng, still half-asleep, wiped her mouth: "Is it finally over?"

"Did you sleep well?" The elder responded, but his voice suddenly transformed into Scholar Song's!

Scholar Song instinctively touched his throat, pondering that for an instant, if he hadn’t confirmed he hadn’t spoken, he would have suspected the voice was his own.

"Uh, sleeping was alright," Jiu Deng replied instinctively upon hearing Scholar Song’s voice, still in a daze.

But as soon as she finished her response, she abruptly woke up.

She whipped her head around and saw Scholar Song looking at her with an odd expression while touching his throat. Jiu Deng's face fell as she turned away, glancing at the elder with a pitiful look.

"Hehe, too late," the elder chuckled lightly.

Then, he flicked his finger.

An invisible force acted upon Jiu Deng.

"Ahhhhhh—" she screamed as she was sent flying away! That speed was unbelievable. By the time she let out her four cries of "ah," she had already vanished beyond the bronze ancient hall.

"Never sleep during my lecture! This little girl just never learns." The elder muttered.

Scholar Song quietly swallowed hard.

"Alright, little guy, I’ve finished my rambling. It’s time to send you off the island." The elder stood up, rummaging through the long-haired rabbit. Afterward, he produced a piece of cloth inscribed with runes and handed it to Scholar Song.

Scholar Song took the rune cloth and asked, "Is this a memory-sealing spell?"

As he grasped the cloth, a bright light suddenly filled his eyes.

The runes on the cloth transformed into countless tiny characters that surged into his mind. These runes combined into a ‘memory-sealing’ spell. However, this spell was in a ‘pending activation’ state, waiting for Scholar Song to activate it himself to seal his memories.

"This rune allows you to seal one memory at will. Hidden within the sealing spell is an opportunity for unsealing. Once you activate it, it will seal all your memories of being on the island," the elder explained. "The chance to undo the ‘self-sealing’ will depend on whether you encounter a fateful opportunity."

"Lastly, in return for you listening to my ramblings for so long, could you give me that inch-long snake skin you have? I'll personally make you a small ‘shrinking bag.’" The elder smiled.

Upon hearing this, Scholar Song's eyes lit up.

After all this time listening to the elder, he finally had something to gain. Although he had the inch-long snake's skin, finding someone to craft it into a shrinking bag wouldn’t be easy and would likely require a hefty price. He might not have a ‘shrinking bag’ of his own for quite some time.

The elder’s request was exactly what he wished for.

Thus, Scholar Song quickly pulled out the box Jiu Deng had given him and handed it to the elder.

The elder took out the inch-long snake's skin and pressed his palms together.

The long-haired white rabbit in his arms opened its mouth, producing several materials, which fused into the elder's hands.

One by one, the spell runes flickered in the elder's palms.

Moments later, the elder extended his hand, and a cute rabbit-shaped purse appeared.

"It’s been ages since I practiced crafting such low-grade magical tools; I’m a bit rusty," the elder said proudly as he handed the rabbit-shaped purse to Scholar Song. "Squeeze the array on the left ear and channel your vitality into it. Then, press it against the item you wish to shrink, and you can store it in the purse."

Scholar Song trembled as he received the purse.

"Elder… why does it have to be a rabbit shape?" Scholar Song asked cautiously. If possible, he’d prefer a crocodile purse or even a standard men’s wallet. But a cute bunny purse? It was a bit hard for him to accept.

"Because I really like cute rabbits," the elder replied solemnly.

"I found a clue!" Elder Bai's eyes sparkled.
