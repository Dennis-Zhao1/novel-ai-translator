**I Never Expected You'd Force Me to Use This Move!**

As a three-hundred-year-old scallion spirit, she had an innate sensitivity to heavenly materials and earthly treasures, even more so than human cultivators!

In a flash, she darted toward the site of the explosion.

Although her cultivation level was low, being a three-hundred-year-old fairy meant her speed was no joke.

Before long, she arrived near the epicenter of the blast.

There, in the center of the explosion, stood a young human cultivator, gripping a pitch-black stone. He was enveloped in a faint layer of defensive energy.

“Human cultivator?” The scallion spirit immediately halted, cautiously hiding behind cover. After the incident with the Nine Lantern Monk, she had developed an instinctive fear of human cultivators.

Scholar Song felt a strange change occurring within him the moment his fingers made contact with the black gemstone!

From the instant he touched the stone, an unusual energy surged from it into his body.

This power was neither blood energy nor true qi, nor was it spiritual energy; it belonged to a realm outside of cultivation. Yet, it had the ability to influence cultivators.

In the past month, while hanging around Venerable White, he had stumbled upon quite a bit of good fortune and encountered numerous opportunities. His third acupoint, the ‘Nasal Acupoint,’ had already accumulated enough energy and was itching to break through, just waiting for the right moment.

As this strange force from the black gem flowed into him, it began to affect the barriers of his acupoints.

To his surprise, this force started to weaken the threshold of his Nasal Acupoint.

The barrier of a cultivator’s Nasal Acupoint could be envisioned as a sturdy iron door. Cultivators had to continuously gather blood energy within the acupoint, and when it overflowed, they would forcefully break through this heavy door using their accumulated energy.

However, now, under the influence of this strange power from the black gemstone, the iron door that was once solid began to weaken, transforming from a thick iron door to a wooden one… until, ultimately, it became a paper door!

A mere bump could shatter that paper door into pieces!

Opportunities like this are fleeting!

Scholar Song fished out a ‘Blood Energy Pill’ from his pocket and swallowed it in one gulp. Immediately, he nimbly maneuvered across the terraced hillside.

Using the body technique of “Gentleman’s Journey” in conjunction with the “Basic Vajra Fist,” and aided by the “Immovable Vajra Body,” he adjusted his internal blood energy as he practiced.

Then, he continuously funneled all the excess blood energy into his third acupoint, the Nasal Acupoint.

Sensing Scholar Song’s actions, the Phantom Spirit within his heart acupoint actively responded, offering a pure stream of blood energy to aid him in breaking through the acupoint barriers.

After completing three rounds of the “Basic Vajra Fist,” the blood energy within his Nasal Acupoint accumulated to its peak and began to overflow.

What was once a challenging barrier to break through, in this moment, was effortlessly shattered.

The third acupoint, the Nasal Acupoint, was open!

A refreshing breath of energy filled Scholar Song’s nostrils.

Opening the first acupoint, the Heart Acupoint, marked the true beginning of foundation establishment, allowing him to step into the ranks of cultivators.

Once the second acupoint, the Eye Acupoint, was opened, it would enhance a cultivator's vision and dynamic sight.

Opening the Nasal Acupoint, however, would significantly improve his sense of smell.

While the enhancement of sight came with myriad benefits, an increase in smell could also bring about numerous troubles.

At least until his cultivation reached the third-grade realm, he would be unable to control his olfactory senses at will—if an ‘Odorous Pill’ were to fall nearby, the stench would amplify a hundredfold, a thousandfold, or even ten thousandfold, enough to knock Scholar Song out cold from sheer disgust.

Of course, the benefits were plentiful as well. Aside from the enhanced sense of smell… with the Nasal Acupoint opened, every breath he took would draw in the ‘spiritual energy’ drifting through the air. Part of it would convert into blood energy stored within the Nasal Acupoint, while another part would merge into his body, strengthening him.

In other words, with the Nasal Acupoint opened, every breath would be a form of cultivation!

This sensation was simply incredible!

The only downside was that Scholar Song didn’t awaken any ‘Nasal Acupoint talents’ this time. But there was no rush; he still had the Oral and Auricular Acupoints left, with opportunities to awaken more talents.

With his eyes wide open, Scholar Song greedily inhaled, wanting to draw in more ‘spiritual energy’ from the world around him!

The next moment…

“Ugh… it stinks!” He retched, as the smell that filled his nostrils was heavily laced with the acrid scent of burnt remains from the explosion.

It felt like his nose was pressed right against a spot of charred filth, inhaling deeply.

While the opening of the Nasal Acupoint brought many advantages, it also came with plenty of inconveniences.

Scholar Song sighed inwardly.

He weighed the black gemstone in his hand, and at that moment, he could almost confirm that this black stone was undoubtedly the ‘Extraterrestrial Enlightenment Stone’ that Venerable White and the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain had mentioned.

Just being near the stone made the barriers within him feel so much easier to breach. Furthermore, simply gazing at this stone, Scholar Song found that a torrent of chaotic information flooded into his mind.

This information was indescribable in words; it was merely a form of understanding.

As these insights filled his mind, he realized that his comprehension of the “Basic Vajra Fist,” “Gentleman’s Journey,” “Immovable Vajra Body,” and “True Self Meditation Sutra” had deepened significantly.

If he were to practice these techniques again, he was confident he could manifest even more variations.

“Fortune favors the bold?” Scholar Song murmured as he surveyed the devastation surrounding him.

It seemed the ‘meteorite’ that had fallen from the sky was meant for the Cloud Mist Daoist.

And this explosion was a calamity aimed at him, wasn’t it? But what he gained was this ‘Enlightenment Stone’?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

“Broke through? Just by holding that gemstone?” The scallion spirit’s eyes sparkled with excitement—if she could obtain this stone, she fantasized about rapidly advancing her own cultivation.

She had to get her hands on that pitch-black stone.

Simultaneously, she began to calculate.

“That human cultivator just opened his Nasal Acupoint… and I’ve had mine open for decades. Plus, I’ve been cultivating for three hundred years. I can definitely win!” The scallion spirit thought to herself, feeling assured that she could easily outmatch this young human cultivator.

Coincidentally, Scholar Song’s protective ‘Armor Talisman’ had nearly exhausted its energy, and its defenses had faded.

What a perfect opportunity!

The scallion spirit cautiously approached Scholar Song.

Once she got within striking distance, she sprang into action, her fingers darting like arrows as she unleashed a series of “Basic Finger Techniques of the Heavenly Dragon Temple” aimed at Scholar Song’s back, targeting several key acupoints. A single hit would incapacitate him, allowing her to gleefully snatch away the black stone.

“Come at me!” Yet, at that moment, Scholar Song defied expectations and let out a fierce shout, turning around to punch with no mercy. The ‘Basic Fist Technique I’ hit like a cannonball, hurtling toward the assailant.

In truth, Scholar Song had noticed someone sneaking up on him long ago—after opening his Nasal Acupoint, his sense of smell had sharpened.

Although the scallion spirit had been cautious, she had no idea how to conceal her presence. From a distance, Scholar Song had already caught a whiff of the strong scallion aroma emanating from her!

---

The scallion spirit never expected Scholar Song to react so quickly—she had no real combat experience. Three hundred years ago, when she first set out, she had already crossed paths with the Nine Lantern Monk.

She had been trapped by him until just a year ago when she was finally released.

In terms of fighting, she was a complete novice, even more inexperienced than Scholar Song.

Seeing Scholar Song's fist coming at her, she gritted her teeth and decided to counter with the ‘Basic Finger Techniques of the Heavenly Dragon Temple’ directly against his punch.

Finger techniques emphasized agility, relying on quick jabs and thrusts.

Fist techniques emphasized raw power, making frontal confrontations the most effective.

The scallion spirit was completely attacking with her weakness against his strength.

When their strikes collided, Scholar Song felt the power from his Heart, Eye, and Nasal acupoints merging seamlessly, and he unleashed his full strength with exhilarating ease.

The scallion spirit was sent flying by the impact… crashing to the ground.

---

Scholar Song stared at the scallion spirit lying on the ground, and without thinking, he blurted out, “So weak!”

So weak, so weak, so weak!

The three words echoed repeatedly in the scallion spirit’s mind.

In an instant, her anger flared.

“You little cultivator, you’re seeking your own death!” Her gaze turned sharp.

Simultaneously, a surge of overwhelming power erupted from her, affecting the surrounding space, and a gust of icy wind rushed toward Scholar Song.

Scholar Song’s pores stood on end; he recognized this type of power, having experienced something similar from Dou Dou before—it was demon power!

“Are you scared now, human little cultivator?” The scallion spirit spoke coldly. “I am a great demon who has cultivated for three hundred years. How dare you defy me? You’re simply courting death!”

A three-hundred-year-old great demon?

To be honest, Scholar Song was genuinely startled. The overwhelming demon power radiating from her was no joke; it looked quite intimidating!

“If you don’t want to die, hand over the stone you’re holding, and I’ll spare your life today, as I’m in a good mood.” The scallion spirit ground her teeth.

Scholar Song didn’t respond; instead, he took a deep breath…

He had once doubted his sanity, having felt exhilarated even when he was nearly assassinated by the forum master’s subordinate.

Now, his thrill-seeking tendencies flared up once again.

“If you want that stone, come and take it!” Scholar Song extended his hand, quickly drawing a lightning talisman in his palm using blood energy.

Then, he shouted, “Palm Lightning!”

Crackle, crackle, crackle!

Lightning erupted from his palm!

---

When the scallion spirit saw the lightning burst forth from Scholar Song’s hand, she was taken aback, “What the heck!”

When did Palm Lightning become something even a first-grade little cultivator could use?

This was getting out of hand.

She had been bluffing; despite her three hundred years of demon power, her real training had been in Buddhist techniques.

Her vast demon power was just for show—she couldn’t actually use it.

What? You say she didn’t spend a long time in a demon organization?

Yeah, she had learned how to ‘accumulate demon power’ and the ridiculous ‘two hundred skills necessary for a demon spirit to survive’—but aside from that, she hadn’t learned anything else, not even basic demon techniques.

---

“I never expected that, after so many years, you’d still force me to use this move.” The scallion spirit glared at the lightning in Scholar Song’s hand, her voice icy.

The next moment, she decisively activated a skill—one of the five hundred methods for surrendering when outmatched by a human cultivator!
