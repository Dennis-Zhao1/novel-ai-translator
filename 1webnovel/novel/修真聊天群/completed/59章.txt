**Deadly Poison**

In the quiet of the night, the sounds of summer cicadas and frogs echoed back and forth, creating a rhythmic backdrop.

Amidst the darkness, a figure clad in a black stealth suit stealthily approached the boys' dormitory, finally stopping beneath the balcony of Scholar Song's room.

"This should be the place," the shadowy figure murmured to himself. With a graceful leap, he soared effortlessly onto the balcony.

The boys' dormitory was two stories high, standing at about three and a half meters, with an additional half-meter for the railing, making it a total of four meters. Yet, the figure didn't need any assistance; he jumped straight up, landing on the balcony with ease.

Such exceptional jumping ability—if he were to serve his country, world championship titles would surely be his to claim. After all, how many high jump athletes could boast about leaping without a running start? Even the best would probably shed tears, silently offering up their knees in defeat upon witnessing such a feat.

Of course, the more likely scenario was that people worldwide would question whether he'd been doping or if he had some advanced technological enhancements secretly implanted in his muscles.

The balcony's door was a sleek floor-to-ceiling window. The black-clad figure first scanned the area with sharp vigilance, ensuring no one was watching. He then retrieved a thin blade from his waist and slipped it into the crack of the window.

In an instant, the lock clicked open without a sound—his lock-picking skills were top-notch.

Pushing the window open gently, the figure slipped inside. His movements were as silent and graceful as a cat, making sure not a whisper of noise escaped.

Inside the bedroom, Scholar Song lay sprawled on his bed, sound asleep.

Earlier that morning, he had helped the Alchemical Sage find a house and refined some body tempering liquid. He'd also spent time learning basic martial arts and meditation techniques, and even got into a scuffle before heading home. The day's events had drained him completely.

Right now, even if someone were to slap him awake, it would be an uphill battle to rouse him from his slumber.

As a cultivator, Scholar Song's experience and vigilance were still far from sufficient; he was still a rookie, requiring much more training.

Similarly, as a novice in his line of work, it was unreasonable to expect him to sleep as alertly as a seasoned cultivator, always aware of the slightest stirrings in his surroundings.

The black-clad figure observed Scholar Song for a moment, comparing the image in his mind with the actual boy before him, confirming his identity: "No doubt about it, it's him."

The target seemed completely unaware of his presence, making the infiltration unexpectedly easy.

Yet, the black-clad figure did not dare to let his guard down. The leader had cautioned him about this ordinary boy, Scholar Song, urging him to be cautious and act according to the situation. If he were detected, he was to retreat immediately without hesitation!

Thus, from the moment he entered the room, he had maintained a careful demeanor, holding his breath and suppressing his presence.

"Now, where is the Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl?" The figure's gaze swept around the room, as he had come to retrieve the fabled spirit ghost.

The room was small, and it didn’t take long for him to find his target—the Soul-Sealing Ice Pearl, which contained the spirit ghost, was hanging from Scholar Song's neck as a pendant, completely unguarded.

Excitement surged within him.

“This mission is way easier than I thought—fantastic!” The black-clad figure felt a rush of joy. The target lay there, deep in sleep, appearing utterly unbothered, not at all resembling a formidable opponent. He couldn’t fathom why the leader would have any reservations about such an ordinary mortal.

With his left hand, he reached toward the pendant around Scholar Song's neck.

At that moment, as he gazed at the still-slumbering Scholar Song, a thought sparked in his mind.

Simply retrieving the spirit ghost would only fulfill the leader's task and earn him a small reward.

But what if he could bring Scholar Song's head back along with it?

Perhaps he could gain the leader's favor and access deeper levels of cultivation techniques!

Before long, he would rise through the ranks, become a key member within the organization, and be the leader's right-hand man, reaching the pinnacle of life. Who knew, he might even attain immortality like the leader! The thought sent a thrill of excitement through him.

The black-clad figure flipped a small, handle-less blade into his right hand, his eyes glinting with murderous intent. He pressed the blade against Scholar Song's throat while his left hand crept forward to grasp the pendant's chain.

Once he secured the spirit ghost, he would finish off the boy with a swift strike, and wealth and glory would be his!

The black-clad figure licked his lips, his heart racing with dreams of a bright future.

Just as his fingers were about to touch the pendant—

Suddenly, he felt an inexplicable heaviness settle over his body, followed by a fierce wave of dizziness hitting his head. It felt as if someone had plunged a mixing stick into his brain and was stirring it violently. The pain was intense, almost bringing forth a scream.

"What’s happening?" He gritted his teeth, swallowing the cry that threatened to escape.

An ominous sensation washed over him.

As anticipated, in the next moment, a wave of weakness flooded through him, accompanied by nausea and the urge to vomit. The blade slipped from his fingers and clattered to the floor.

"This feeling... is it poison? Damn it, where did this poison come from? When did I get poisoned?" Panic gripped the black-clad figure.

Trained through countless brutal scenarios, he quickly realized he had been poisoned, and it was a particularly vicious one. As it took effect, even the ‘blood energy’ within him could no longer be mobilized, and he felt his body weaken rapidly.

He shot a glance at Scholar Song on the bed.

At that moment, he caught sight of Scholar Song's lips curling into a slight, wicked smile while he slept. (Was that a sweet smile?)

Not good!

"I’ve been tricked!" The black-clad figure reacted instinctively, retreating swiftly. While his body still had strength, he rolled off the balcony.

“Wow!” Upon hitting the ground, he spat out a mouthful of blood, staining the mask over his face.

In a panic, he fished out several antidote pills from his pocket, swallowing them without a second thought.

However, the dizziness in his head showed no signs of easing, and the weakness only intensified. As he jumped from the balcony, he felt his legs wobble, his body having sustained some internal injuries.

The antidote had no effect.

All he felt was his mind growing hazy from the intense pain, akin to a drunkard losing his ability to think clearly.

I have to get back to the leader quickly, before the poison fully takes hold and seek his help!

With that thought, he forced his poisoned body to sprint toward the ‘leader.’

This was undoubtedly a grave mistake—if he had been in his right mind, he would never have headed straight for the leader. Doing so would only expose the leader’s hideout.

But at this moment, his mind was a jumble, and instinct urged him to seek the leader for rescue.

...

...

The leader was currently staying in a hotel outside the university town.

He leaned back in his chair, trying to clear his mind, but the piercing gaze of the Alchemical Sage, with those dark circles under his eyes, kept flashing in his thoughts. That terrifying gaze refused to leave his mind.

Just the thought of that stare made his body feel weak.

He dared not approach the Alchemical Sage and couldn’t get close to Scholar Song either. He was unsure whether Scholar Song was truly a ‘high-level individual’ or merely an ‘ordinary person.’

It was only deep into the night, after learning that Scholar Song had separated from the Alchemical Sage, that he, driven by his desire for the ‘spirit ghost,’ sent a newly trained subordinate to investigate Scholar Song.

Uncertain of Scholar Song's true strength, he hesitated to send a strong subordinate, fearing they might fall into the boy's hands. His subordinates were costly and time-consuming to train.

“Let’s see, if everything went well, my subordinate should be back by now, right?” The leader thought to himself. If he had failed, the consequences would surely be dire.

The world of cultivators is far crueler than that of ordinary people!

Just then, there was a knock at the door.

Could it be his subordinate returning?
