**Father Song: My liver is going to shatter!**

When Scholar Song finally returned home, he was about to face Old Lu head-on. Old Lu’s fighting spirit after a few drinks was definitely three times more than usual. Father Song rubbed his liver area, feeling the impending doom.

That kid, Book Hang, really should’ve called earlier if he was coming home! At least that would’ve given him some time to mentally prepare. Now, he only got the call when there were just over ten minutes left until home. Father Song felt completely blindsided!

“Just be careful on the way back, and come upstairs to greet Uncle Lu when you get home... By the way, what’s that ‘rumbling’ noise coming from your side?” Father Song shouted, pressing the phone to his ear—he deliberately emphasized ‘Uncle Lu’ to prepare Scholar Song for what was to come.

“Haha, it’s nothing. I just took a special mode of transportation this time,” Scholar Song replied with a laugh. “I’ll hang up now; I’ll be home soon.”

With that, he ended the call.

Father Song put away his phone, puzzled—what kind of transportation could make such a loud engine noise?

A sports car? No, that didn’t sound right. The noise resembled the engines of the cargo boats that used to run on the river or the tractors that were becoming rare in the village.

A tractor? No way! A chill ran down Father Song’s spine, causing him to shiver involuntarily.

It couldn’t be. He never skimped on Book Hang’s living expenses, so there’s no way he was poor enough to ride a tractor home.

I must’ve heard it wrong—maybe it was an SUV that just sounded like a tractor?

As he thought this, he glanced at the BMW 7 Series parked outside his house.

Son, please don’t come home on a tractor—otherwise, I’ll lose all my face!

…

…

“Old Song, was that Book Hang on the phone?” Old Lu, sitting nearby, interrupted with a loud laugh, “Is he coming home?”

“Yeah, he’s making a surprise visit, saying he’ll be home in ten minutes. Honey, get a few more dishes ready for Book Hang!” Father Song called out to Mother Song.

“Oh, he’s coming back? That child, he never tells us in advance,” Mother Song replied with a smile, relieved that they had already prepared plenty of ingredients for Old Lu’s visit.

“Old Song, where is your Book Hang now? Should I have Tianyou go pick him up? Haha!” Old Lu laughed heartily, “It’s been over a year since I’ve seen Book Hang; I wonder how he’s doing!”

“Haha, no need to trouble Tianyou. That kid said he’s coming over by himself and will be home soon,” Father Song forced a laugh.

Then, Father Song began to down drinks with Old Lu.

Ten minutes… If possible, Father Song wished he could get Old Lu drunk. That way, it wouldn’t matter what kind of vehicle Book Hang arrived in.

But unfortunately, Old Lu was not someone who got drunk easily.

The ten minutes flew by…

Downstairs, a strange ‘putt-putt, rumble’ of an engine echoed.

Scholar Song had arrived home!

…

…

As Scholar Song got closer to home, he found a secluded corner and tore off the ‘invisibility’ rune from the tractor that Venerable White had stuck on it. The tractor immediately reappeared from its hidden state.

He didn’t remove any of the other runes; otherwise, the tractor’s two to three dozen miles per hour speed would be too alarming. As long as the tractor was visible, it wouldn’t scare anyone. Speeding wasn’t a problem—he could slow down as he approached home!

Initially, Scholar Song had planned to quietly park the tractor in an empty lot nearby instead of driving it home—he felt a bit embarrassed. More importantly, Uncle Lu was at home. Scholar Song knew that Uncle Lu and his father had a playful rivalry; they would compete and tease each other relentlessly. The thought of driving a tractor home was too much to bear!

However, after picking up the meteorite and running into the Cloud Mist Daoist, Scholar Song had no choice but to abandon that plan. There was no way he could carry Venerable White and the Cloud Mist Daoist while dragging a huge meteorite home, right?

So, in the end, Scholar Song gritted his teeth, tossed aside his shame and dignity, and drove the tractor rumbling down the road toward home.

Honestly, if he thought about it carefully, a hand-held tractor could be pretty cool!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

“Is that Book Hang back?” Hearing the roaring noise, Old Lu stood up from his chair, laughing as he walked toward the window. He wanted to see what Old Song’s son looked like after a year.

Father Song felt an increasingly bad premonition as he listened to the ‘rumbling’ noise from downstairs. His face stiffened, and he joined Old Lu at the window.

They both looked down at the same moment.

Upon seeing the scene below, both Old Lu and Father Song’s expressions changed dramatically.

Downstairs, Scholar Song was gripping the handle of the hand-held tractor, bouncing up and down with the vehicle, looking quite exhilarated.

Behind the tractor, a large stone was being dragged along…

It was indeed a tractor, and a hand-held one at that!

What kind of play is this?

Moments later… Scholar Song elegantly parked the tractor!

“Haha, Old Song, your son is driving a hand-held tractor! That’s impressive! I remember driving one of those twenty years ago. Hand-held tractors, wow! Where did he dig up this antique? You hardly see these on the road anymore!” Old Lu laughed heartily.

Just thinking about his son’s BMW 7 Series parked nearby and Old Song’s son rolling in on a hand-held tractor made Old Lu feel a wave of satisfaction. He could relish this moment for an entire year!

Meanwhile, Father Song’s face turned a shade of green with anger, his teeth clenched tightly, as he felt like he could burst with rage.

That rascal actually rode a tractor home, and not just any tractor—he drove it himself!

And it was a hand-held one!

Father Song could no longer contain himself; it felt like his liver was about to shatter!

…

…

Downstairs, after parking the tractor, Scholar Song lifted something from beside the driver’s seat.

“Are there guests?” Father Song’s expression softened slightly.

But why was Book Hang carrying guests?

As he pondered this, Scholar Song rummaged around behind the tractor and pulled out another figure from behind the large stone—this person was even more troubling!

Father Song noticed that this person had very little clothing on. In broad daylight, they were completely bare—what a sight!

Scholar Song casually grabbed this person and slung them over his other shoulder.

Then, balancing one on each shoulder, he wobbled his way toward the stairs.

“What kind of act is this?” Old Lu asked, baffled.

Father Song shook his head—how would he know what was going on?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Before long, Scholar Song had reached the top of the stairs and knocked on the door.

Mother Song ran over and opened the door.

Upon seeing the two figures, she quickly asked with concern, “Book Hang, who are these two people on your shoulders?”

“Haha, don’t mind them,” Scholar Song shrugged, adjusting the weight on his left shoulder, where Venerable White was still in closed-door training. “This one is my good friend; I invited him over, but he fell asleep on the way. Once he falls asleep, he sleeps like a log—no matter how much you call him, he won’t wake up.”

“…” Mother Song glanced at Venerable White. Sleep like a log? He looked like he was in a deep slumber indeed.

Venerable White hung limply over Scholar Song’s shoulder, long hair cascading down… his arms dangled helplessly, and his legs swayed with Scholar Song's movements.

To be able to sleep so soundly, this kid must have some incredible sleep quality.

Mother Song sighed, “Come on, hand this girl over to me. You can’t just carry her like this!”

Seeing Venerable White’s long black hair and slender figure, she mistakenly thought Venerable White was a girl at first glance.

“What girl? Cough, cough, Mom, Bai… Song Bai is a guy. He just has long hair; it’s common among art students,” Scholar Song fabricated an excuse.

Luckily, at this moment, Zhao Yaya wasn’t visiting; otherwise, she would’ve immediately seen through Scholar Song’s lie.

“What? It’s a boy?” Mother Song’s expression fell, disappointed.

She had thought that finally, Book Hang had come to his senses and brought a girl home! But alas, nearly a year of college had gone by, and he still brought a boy home—what a shame!

“Then what about this one?” Mother Song looked at the other side, where the Cloud Mist Daoist was. Her eyes widened in shock—this guy looked a bit worse for wear, with a bloodied face? His clothes looked burned and torn, giving off a charred smell. Yet, remarkably, his skin was unharmed.

“This is someone I found on the side of the road. I checked, and he just has some minor injuries but fainted. I figured it wasn’t good to leave him lying outside, so I brought him back,” Scholar Song explained with a friendly smile.

“You…” Mother Song pressed her forehead, feeling exasperated with her son’s ‘good Samaritan’ tendencies, “At this time, shouldn’t you have called for an ambulance? What if your interference makes his condition worse?”

She didn’t voice her other concern—what if the injured person attempted to extort him? He’d be in a world of trouble!

“Don’t worry, it’s fine,” Scholar Song assured her. “I know this person; I’ll call his family to come pick him up later. It won’t be a hassle!”

“Knowing him? That’s good to hear,” Mother Song sighed, “Alright, stop lingering at the door. Bring them in! The injured one can go in the guest room, and your friend can stay in your room.”

“Sure, no problem.” Scholar Song carried Venerable White and the Cloud Mist Daoist up the stairs, waving at Father Song and Uncle Lu, who were by the window.

Then, he confidently carried Venerable White and the Cloud Mist Daoist into his bedroom.

…

…

“Your Book Hang is quite strong!” Old Lu leaned against the window, looking rosy and delighted as he spoke to Father Song.

Carrying two people upstairs without breaking a sweat!

“This kid has some brute strength,” Father Song smiled—by the way, has Book Hang grown taller? He seemed much taller than the last time Father Song saw him.

“Let’s go down and try out your son’s tractor,” Old Lu was clearly poking at Father Song’s sore spot, “It’s been years since I’ve driven one!”

Wanting to try out a hand-held tractor was just an excuse; Old Lu was clearly trying to provoke Father Song.

“Oh, you old coot, stop messing around. After drinking so much, you’re not afraid of causing a traffic accident?” Father Song snorted.

“Who’s afraid? Over twenty years ago, I drank Erguotou with one hand and drove a hand-held tractor with the other, and nothing happened! I know my own limits. Besides, I’ll just drive it to the roadside of Baijing Road for a spin. What’s there to worry about?” Old Lu replied proudly, waving for his son Tianyou, “Tianyou, come over and help me get the tractor started!”

Get the tractor started? Tianyou wanted to cry at that moment.

Father Song sighed, but he had no choice but to accompany Old Lu downstairs—he had to keep an eye on Old Lu; who knows what would happen if he went a little crazy and drove the tractor far away while drunk?

The three of them went down together, and Old Lu excitedly hopped into the driver’s seat, his hands caressing the familiar yet slightly foreign tractor handle.

Time flies, and twenty years have passed in the blink of an eye; his son has grown up!

He definitely wanted to relive the feeling of driving a hand-held tractor, even if it was mostly to poke fun at Father Song.

“Tianyou, don’t just stand there! Go ahead and get the tractor started!” Old Lu shouted to his son.

Tianyou smiled wryly, grabbed the tractor’s handle, and started to pump it energetically. He had often seen Old Lu do this as a child, so he was quite adept at it.

Vroom vroom… putt-putt.

The hand-held tractor roared back to life.

“Get in! Get in! You two go to the back; let me take you for a spin!” Old Lu yelled excitedly.

Father Song felt helpless as he climbed into the back of the tractor.

Tianyou grimaced, “I think I’ll sit this one out.”

“Don’t even think about it! If it stalls mid-ride, who’s going to get it started again?” Old Lu retorted angrily.

Tianyou could only smile wryly and climb in beside Father Song.

“By the way, what’s that massive stone Book Hang brought back for?” Tianyou asked, eyeing the stone.

Father Song shook his head.

…

…

Upstairs, Scholar Song had just settled the Cloud Mist Daoist and was placing Venerable White on his bed when he suddenly heard the sound of a tractor roaring to life downstairs.

Scholar Song rushed to the window and looked down.

Then he saw Uncle Lu excitedly sitting in the driver’s seat of the tractor, with Father Song and Tianyou in the back, as the tractor began to move slowly.

Oh no! Scholar Song broke into a cold sweat.

The runes that Venerable White had put on the tractor—he had only torn off the invisibility rune. The runes for acceleration and reducing friction and resistance were still intact. That tractor could go a hundred miles per hour!
