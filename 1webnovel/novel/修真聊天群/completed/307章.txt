**The Ailing Spirit Beast Elder**

Hobbies and personalities are often a mystery; even taboos can change frequently, and appearances can vary greatly. Is this a spirit beast elder with shapeshifting abilities that adopts a different persona with each transformation?

With these thoughts swirling in his mind, Scholar Song followed the Nine Lantern Girl as they stepped onto the dock, traversing the long official road until they arrived at a magnificent palace.

The palace was incredibly opulent, resembling a celestial abode rather than a mere mortal structure.

There were no guards at the entrance.

The Nine Lantern Girl led him directly inside.

Upon entering the main hall, Scholar Song beheld a row of musical instruments lining both sides of the great hall. There were guqin, pipa, bells, and a variety of other ancient instruments.

Though no one was playing them, the strings of the guqin plucked themselves, and the bells chimed harmoniously, creating enchanting melodies that filled the air—truly a miraculous sight.

At the front of the palace stood a massive platform, covered with layers of thick animal furs that looked incredibly soft and comfortable.

On this platform lay a ball of lightning, motionless.

Upon closer inspection, he could see a plump pig-like figure nestled within the electric glow, even rounder than the one perched on the phoenix tree at the valley entrance.

“Tsk, is it in pig form today?” the Nine Lantern Girl murmured.

The pig form was one of the thirty-six shapes of this spirit beast elder, and it was quite a troublesome one.

The giant pig, wrapped in lightning, slightly opened its eyes, glancing at the Nine Lantern Girl and Scholar Song before… closing them again.

“Elder, I’ve come to find you!” the Nine Lantern Girl called out loudly to the spirit beast on the platform.

The giant pig opened its eyes again, its mouth moving as if to speak, but no sound emerged.

The ‘anger vein’ on the Nine Lantern Girl’s forehead reappeared, and she took a deep breath: “Elder Thunder Pig, Nine Lantern has come to see you!”

The giant pig opened its eyes once more, seemingly making an effort to look at the Nine Lantern Girl: “Oh.”

After a moment, the giant pig shifted a bit: “It’s you, Nine Lantern.”

After another pause, it panted, “Nine Lantern, please don’t disturb the elder for trivial matters; I… am sick.”

The Nine Lantern Girl’s ‘anger vein’ throbbed again: “Elder, what illness do you have?”

“I… I have an incurable terminal illness,” the giant pig gasped, struggling to speak.

Can such a powerful spirit beast really get sick? Scholar Song wondered.

“What terminal illness?” The tension in the Nine Lantern Girl’s forehead eased slightly.

“It’s cancer.” The giant pig revealed a bitter smile. “This illness is terrifying.”

“You must be joking!” the Nine Lantern Girl shouted angrily. “You, a seventh-grade spirit beast venerable, how on earth could you have cancer?”

This seemingly hefty giant pig was indeed a seventh-grade venerable being, on par with Venerable White.

“I’m not lying to you.” The giant pig’s eyes were filled with sorrow, as if it might perish at any moment.

Scholar Song curiously asked, “What kind of cancer?”

The Nine Lantern Girl rubbed her forehead forcefully and then clasped her hands together, reciting a mantra.

The giant pig sighed heavily: “It’s a type called lazy cancer, and it’s already in the late stages. Medicine and herbs are useless.”

Scholar Song: “…”

“Lazy cancer, my foot! Last time you said there was a problem with your chrysanthemum and wanted to change your name to Chrysanthemum Pig… *Pfft*…” Before the Nine Lantern Girl could finish her sentence, a massive pit suddenly opened up beneath her feet, and she fell right in.

“Ahhh!” The Nine Lantern Girl’s screams echoed, growing fainter as she plummeted.

The pit seemed quite deep. Moreover, it was definitely set up with some kind of anti-flying formation, making it impossible for her to fly back up after falling down.

After the Nine Lantern Girl fell, a stone slab ‘thudded’ back into place above the pit, sealing it off.

“Cough, really a person who doesn’t learn from their lessons. I clearly told her last time to stay quiet here and not shout loudly. Why does she always forget?” Elder Thunder Pig murmured, placing a control device down with its claws.

Scholar Song: “…”

After dealing with the Nine Lantern Girl, Elder Thunder Pig’s small eyes turned back to focus on Scholar Song: “Little one, who are you?”

“Junior Scholar Song, greeting the elder,” Scholar Song replied, bowing appropriately.

Elder Thunder Pig tapped its head with a paw.

After a while, it curiously asked, “Do we know each other?”

Scholar Song shook his head: “I was brought here by the Nine Lantern Girl, and it’s my first time meeting the elder.”

“Oh.” Elder Thunder Pig nodded silently, then closed its eyes, seemingly ready to sleep again.

Scholar Song: “…”

Fortunately, Elder Thunder Pig quickly opened its eyes again: “By the way, the little girl brought you to me; is there something you want to ask?”

“Yes, she wanted to bring me here to see if we could get a Dragon Bone Withered Vine from the elder,” Scholar Song replied earnestly.

It was best to be sincere before knowing the elder’s personality and taboos.

“Dragon Bone Withered Vine? Oh, so you’re interested in that dragon skeleton I’ve collected,” Elder Thunder Pig chuckled, then waved a paw dismissively. “Little one, I can give you the Dragon Bone Withered Vine, but my lazy cancer has flared up again, and I need to rest properly. How about you come back next time? I’ll just give it to you then; it’s not worth much.”

Scholar Song: “…”

“By the way, don’t just stand there staring at me; if someone stares at me, I won’t be able to sleep,” Elder Thunder Pig continued, waving its paw, indicating Scholar Song should leave.

Scholar Song contemplated for a moment before asking, “Elder, when should I come back?”

“Three hundred years from now. This time, I need to sleep for a good long while—ah no, I must battle this illness and defeat lazy cancer!” Elder Thunder Pig gritted its teeth.

Scholar Song: “…”

These deeply cultivated elders are so willful; a nap spans three hundred years.

But three hundred years later, he might already be ashes, and Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan wouldn’t wait that long.

Thus, Scholar Song cautiously asked, “Elder, how can I get the Dragon Bone Withered Vine in advance?”

Elder Thunder Pig opened its eyes slightly and sighed: “As long as you don’t disturb me.”

Scholar Song gritted his teeth and asked, “Could you please enlighten me on how to do that specifically?”

“Literally!” Elder Thunder Pig lamented.

Of course, Scholar Song understood it was a literal meaning, but he couldn’t wait three hundred years. So, he fixed his gaze on Elder Thunder Pig’s massive frame, unblinking.

Elder Thunder Pig: “…”

In the next moment, it reached for the nearby remote control.

Scholar Song felt a chill run down his spine when he realized this was the trap remote that had swallowed the Nine Lantern Girl, so he quickly jumped to the side!

“Naive.” Elder Thunder Pig smirked coldly.

The next instant, the entire floor of the great hall collapsed, revealing an abyss so deep it seemed to have no bottom.

“Ahhh!” Scholar Song screamed as he plummeted into the pit.

…

…

“Ah… finally, I can have a good sleep. This time, I’m going to sleep for three hundred years,” Elder Thunder Pig murmured, pressing the remote again, causing the previously empty floor to quickly restore itself.

Then, Elder Thunder Pig closed its eyes, sinking into a deep slumber.

Lightning crackled across its body.

The dazzling lightning gradually faded, revealing a deep wound on the other side of Elder Thunder Pig’s body, exposing bone. Black mist swirled around the wound, preventing it from healing.

But the previous brilliance had been so blinding that even the Nine Lantern Girl hadn’t noticed the injury on its body.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Scholar Song felt his body falling, endlessly down, as if the abyss had no bottom.

Could it be that I’ll keep falling until I drop out of the ‘Heavenly Realm Island’? he thought.

Just then, his body suddenly lightened, and he floated upwards.

After floating about an inch, he gently landed.

He felt the touch of rubble beneath his feet.

Finally at the bottom?

At that moment, a familiar voice floated over from the side: “You’ve been tossed down too, huh?”

Scholar Song turned to look in the direction of the voice, barely making out the Nine Lantern Girl’s bald head in the darkness. She was sitting cross-legged on the ground, looking quite dejected.

“Nine Lantern Girl.” Seeing her made Scholar Song feel relieved. “How do we get out?”

“We just need to wait for that fat pig to finish sleeping, and it’ll let us out. It was the same last time,” the Nine Lantern Girl said, sounding quite experienced.

Scholar Song: “…”

Scholar Song: “Speaking of which, Elder Thunder Pig just said he was going to battle lazy cancer this time and sleep for three hundred years.”

“Three hundred years? What a joke!” The ‘anger vein’ on the Nine Lantern Girl’s forehead bulged again. “What else did it say to you?”

Scholar Song recounted his earlier conversation with Elder Thunder Pig.

“Damn it, even if it’s going to sleep for three hundred years, it should at least let me out first! I’ll remember this grudge; once I advance to the seventh-grade venerable realm, I’ll make it sleep once a year for the rest of its life!” The Nine Lantern Girl gritted her teeth in anger.

“Nine Lantern Girl, can’t we climb out of this hole?” Scholar Song asked, puzzled.

“The walls are covered with restrictions set by that fat pig; we can’t climb out,” the Nine Lantern Girl replied, looking frustrated. “Plus, there’s a powerful anti-flying formation. Unless you have the strength of a seventh-grade spirit venerable, even if you had ten pairs of wings, you wouldn’t be able to fly.”

“Could there be a hidden exit here?” Scholar Song pondered.

“I scoured every inch of this place when I fell down last time and didn’t find any secret passage,” the Nine Lantern Girl said, resting her chin on her hand, looking gloomy.

“Then how do we get out? Are we really going to wait for three hundred years?”

“Don’t worry; I came prepared this time,” the Nine Lantern Girl said, pointing to her pale blue monk robe. “The reason I changed my clothes before coming is to deal with situations like this!”

With that, she began to remove her pale blue monk robe.

Scholar Song quickly covered his eyes…
