**Just Stand There!**

On the battlefield, things were heating up.

“I don’t know what kind of scheme you’re plotting,” Sable Seven said in a deep voice. “But it doesn’t matter. No matter what you intend to do, all I need to do is chop you in half, and that’ll be the end of it!”

“Brother Seven, you’re still as decisive as ever,” Young Master Hai replied with a smile. “Please, go ahead and make your move! Don’t hold back. With the protection of the Moon Blade Sect’s grand formation, I can surpass my limits to fight you. Isn’t it exhilarating for us to duel with swords again?!”

“A duel?” Sable Seven’s voice turned icy. “Do you think this is still a friendly competition? Today, I have no interest in sparring with anyone.”

He had always loved challenges and combat, which earned him the title of ‘Battle Maniac’ in the Ninefold Land’s chat group. But today, all he wanted was to spill blood.

Sable Seven continued, “There’s a vast difference between a first and second-tier cultivator. The same goes for the fourth and fifth tiers.”

“Yes, I know,” Young Master Hai nodded.

“No, you don’t understand.” Sable Seven smirked, and suddenly, his entire body shimmered with a crystalline glow, revealing a golden dan within him, shining like the rising sun.

A fifth-tier golden dan. Once a cultivator forms the golden dan, their ‘true qi’ undergoes a transformation into spiritual power.

Spiritual power and true qi originate from the same source, but spiritual power overwhelmingly dominates true qi in terms of rank. It’s like comparing a wooden sword to a sharp iron blade.

Since Sable Seven had condensed his golden dan and advanced to the Spirit Monarch rank, the number of opponents he could challenge had dwindled. Even the other battle maniac in the Ninefold Land chat group, Wild Blade of Three Tides, had been intimidated by him. So, during his usual sparring and challenges, he rarely unleashed his full strength!

Sable Seven pointed a finger at Young Master Hai.

A droplet of spiritual power surged from his golden dan and flowed into his index finger.

As this droplet of spiritual power left his body, it transformed into a golden pearl that shot toward Young Master Hai. The pearl moved so swiftly that to other cultivators, it appeared as a mere flash of golden light!

Moreover, within this tiny pearl of spiritual power were encapsulated a total of eighty sword beams!

“Formation, activate!” Young Master Hai’s expression turned grave as he shouted, “Change the formation, Fifth Formation!”

The disciples of the Moon Blade Sect sprang into action, guided by several elders, to form the ‘New Sect Protection Fifth Formation.’

Within the formation, every disciple of the Moon Blade Sect roared with fervor, merging their true qi and vital energy into the protective formation, amplifying its power for Young Master Hai.

Simultaneously, the blood mist above Blue Source Valley suddenly gathered, forming layers of defenses in front of Young Master Hai.

The golden pearl of sword beams was now just a moment away.

Whoosh!

The pearl of spiritual power collided with the blood mist, and the defenses formed by the mist crumbled as easily as tofu, causing a pang of heartbreak. It was easily pierced through.

In an instant, the golden pearl of sword beams struck right before Young Master Hai.

He hurriedly summoned a small jade shield.

This jade shield wasn’t a magical artifact but rather a talisman—a precious one capable of withstanding an attack from a ‘fifth-tier Spirit Monarch’ just once.

The golden pearl of sword beams collided with the jade shield.

In the blink of an eye, the jade shield began to shatter.

It was indeed capable of blocking an attack from a fifth-tier Spirit Monarch, but only from the most ordinary of them—not from Sable Seven.

Young Master Hai’s right sleeve flared open. “Anzhi Demon Lord, it’s your turn.”

The split soul of Anzhi Demon Lord cackled maniacally and, just before the jade shield shattered, darted in front of the droplet of spiritual power, swallowing it whole.

Then, the split soul of Anzhi Demon Lord rapidly soared upwards.

In less than fifty meters, the droplet of spiritual power exploded.

Boom~~~

The sword beams erupted, shredding the split soul of Anzhi Demon Lord into pieces. The massive shockwave from the explosion sent Young Master Hai, who was flying with his sword, staggering dangerously.

He hastily summoned another jade shield talisman to block the explosive sword beams.

Young Master Hai struggled to steady himself and sighed inwardly. “So… just how terrifying is the golden dan realm? I’ve known it all along.”

It was precisely because he understood the terror of a fifth-tier Spirit Monarch that he was determined to become one himself!

……

Sable Seven’s attack had been thwarted.

Yet the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect below felt the immense pressure of Sable Seven’s strength, struggling to breathe under the invisible weight.

Faced with the fearsome Sable Seven, they could only do their utmost to maintain the ‘New Sect Protection Formation,’ as it was their only means of defense at the moment.

The disciples moved about, channeling their true qi into the protective formation!

At that moment, they all shared a single thought: as long as they could maintain the formation, they would withstand Sable Seven’s attack.

Then, they would push him back!

Unbeknownst to them, the eyes of the Moon Blade Sect disciples turned bloodshot, their breaths coming in quick gasps.

“Elder Young Master Hai!” In the end, the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect, in a frenzy, chanted Young Master Hai’s name.

“Done.” Among the crowd, a disciple whose face was shrouded in dark mist quietly slipped out of the ‘New Sect Protection Formation’ and vanished without a trace.

It was Anzhi Demon Lord, who had stealthily blended in among the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect, using his demonic arts to confuse their minds, driving them into a frenzy even faster.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

After much effort, Young Master Hai managed to stabilize himself and gazed at Sable Seven.

Though he appeared somewhat disheveled, he still maintained his graceful demeanor.

“And what now? Are you just going to rely on these talismans and magical artifacts to struggle in vain?” Sable Seven said indifferently. “Come at me!”

The blade fell into his hand.

He didn’t need to fly on a sword; Sable Seven stood firmly in the air as if he were on solid ground.

In that instant, the blade’s momentum was like the wrath of the heavens. Sable Seven, now gripping the blade, seemed like an entirely different person than before.

Young Master Hai’s body trembled slightly under the influence of the blade’s aura, but he quickly regained his composure. “I never thought that way. Even if I summoned all my talismans and magical artifacts, I could never withstand your third strike.”

Sable Seven’s brow furrowed slightly.

“In fact, the moment you, ‘Sable Seven,’ appeared in this Blue Source Valley, my plan was complete,” Young Master Hai said, opening his arms and smiling.

Everything was within his grasp. Now was the time to reel it in!

“Do you see, Brother Seven? The charming cries of the Moon Blade Sect disciples down below. They are fervently pouring all their strength into the protective formation. Their minds are consumed with a single belief—to drive back Sable Seven!”

“This is your role in my plan, Brother Seven—you don’t even need to lift a finger. Just standing there is enough to exert immense pressure on the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect. To combat you, they are desperately squeezing their potential, channeling all their true qi and vital energy into the ‘Protective Formation.’”

“But that’s not enough. The modified protective formation is quite greedy. It doesn’t just absorb the true qi from the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect—it even consumes their life force and their frenzied souls!”

“Because they possess unwavering conviction, they resemble the most fervent zealots of ancient times. Rather than being slaughtered as despairing sacrifices, these frenzied Moon Blade disciples can contribute much more life force and soul power. They are the perfect offerings!”

“Revel, sing, dance!”

“My… sacrifices!”

Below, the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect danced like madmen, chanting Young Master Hai’s name, their eyes bloodshot, having lost all rationality.

One by one, the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect fell to the ground!

“Formation, activate! Blood God Evil Blade Formation!”

Young Master Hai raised his hands high, and the blood mist surged up in Blue Source Valley.

The true body of Anzhi Demon Lord chuckled ominously, stealthily appearing behind Young Master Hai. His body was engulfed in demonic flames. The reason the Moon Blade Sect disciples fell into madness so quickly was all thanks to him.

Anzhi Demon Lord and Young Master Hai stood back to back, both raising their hands high, presiding over the ‘Blood God Evil Blade Formation’ together!

“Leftover remnants of the Blood Blade Sect, are you?” Sable Seven assumed a peculiar stance for drawing his blade.

“Sky! Blade! Buries! Star! Sea!”

Years later, Sable Seven once again unleashed the Sky Blade Buries Star Sea—what kind of power would it hold?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On the other side, the Master of the Seven Lives Talisman was seizing the moment to explain to Scholar Song the peculiarities of the ‘Protective Formation.’

“This combination of the Blue Source Valley and the Moon Blade Sect disciples’ formation is essentially the ‘Blood God Evil Blade Formation’ used by the Blood Blade Sect, which was exterminated back in the day to sacrifice living beings and condense the Blood God Blade. However, the formation of the Moon Blade Sect has evidently undergone modifications from the original.”

“But no matter how the formation is altered, it never strays far from its essence and cannot escape our eyes!”

The Master of the Seven Lives Talisman’s voice was filled with a sense of triumph. “Has anything changed in Blue Source Valley?”

“A massive blood mist has risen, enveloping the entire Blue Source Valley. Senior Seven seems to be preparing to strike!” Scholar Song replied swiftly.

“This is the time! Go, Young Friend Song, rush to the position we marked! If you can hold out until this formation concludes, you’ll hit the jackpot!” The Master of the Seven Lives Talisman laughed heartily.

Scholar Song had already tensed his muscles like a coiled leopard, sprinting toward the nameless tree. He asked, “Will Senior Seven not break this formation?”

“It can’t be destroyed. Even if the person controlling the formation is killed, the formation will still operate automatically! And if one tries to kill all the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect, it only speeds up the formation’s activation. Because once this grand formation starts, all disciples of the Moon Blade Sect become living sacrifices, materials for the Blood God Blade! Their early or late deaths make no difference; it will only slightly influence the harvest after the formation ends.”

The Master of the Seven Lives Talisman continued, “Unless one strikes with a single blow to flatten the entire Blue Source Valley! Senior Seven could indeed accomplish that, but it would take a long time to gather power. There isn’t that much time for him to build up strength now; we can only hope he can slash down the one controlling the formation.”

At that moment, Scholar Song had already reached his destination. “I’m here! What should I do next?”

“Do nothing at all. Just stand there and wait quietly for the pie to fall from the sky,” the Master of the Seven Lives Talisman said smugly. “The only thing you need to be cautious of is not being killed halfway through. I’m signing off now; if you’re still alive later, just call me to tell me what you’ve gained.”

Scholar Song hung up the phone and carefully crouched in the position designated by the Master of the Seven Lives Talisman, attempting to minimize his visibility.
