**Causing Trouble One After Another!**

Upon closer inspection, one could even notice that Mr. Anthony's body was trembling.

Was Mr. Anthony excited?

……

……

My name is Li Xihua, a young flight instructor at an aviation school, unmarried.

I’m quite popular; everyone at the school affectionately calls me Xiao Li.

Since childhood, I’ve loved the blue skies. As a kid, I longed to become a little bird, so I could fly freely in the sky without a care in the world.

I yearned so much for the skies... and the mysterious, vast universe above!

Eventually, I worked hard toward my goals.

When I grew up, I became a flight instructor at the aviation school. I learned to fly planes and often soared through the blue skies. My childhood dream was finally realized.

Then, I developed a new dream—if I ever get the chance, I want to pilot a supersonic jet and race through the skies!

The helicopters I teach now fly at a snail's pace. Although I have fulfilled my childhood dream, I still lack the chance to truly soar freely in the sky.

And let's be honest, speed is the essence of a man’s passion! Just imagine a plane breaking the sound barrier, whoosh! Entering supersonic mode, traveling faster than sound, that would be incredible!

Of course, this dream is basically impossible. After all, I'm just an ordinary private plane instructor, with little chance to ever pilot a supersonic jet.

In fact, deep down in my heart, there’s an even more outrageous dream—I want to enter the universe and personally touch a meteorite.

I want to see what a space station looks like, stand outside the atmosphere, and see what the sun, stars, moon, and Earth look like with my own eyes.

This dream is even more absurd.

But then, one day, I woke up from a nap to find myself inside a metal capsule, wearing a spacesuit, plummeting toward the ground.

What’s going on? Why am I in a spacesuit?

I have no recollection of how I got here!

The metal capsule landed successfully, but I felt weak all over. Soon, two people came to open the hatch, helped me and another astronaut to our feet, and sat us down in chairs.

In front of us was a large group of blonde, blue-eyed foreigners, who were cheering in English and calling out a name—"Anthony, Anthony!"

"Well, welcome back, hero from the universe—first up, Mr. Akuro!" a beautiful foreign woman announced.

The crowd erupted in applause.

The astronaut next to me unfastened his helmet to reveal a bald head. He smiled and waved, soaking in the cheers from the crowd.

Can someone please tell me what’s going on here?

Let me think... I remember that recently, due to a pressing financial need, I took on a dangerous task at the school, instructing two rookies on how to fly.

They were two wealthy rookies who supposedly had never even touched a plane but wanted to take to the skies. Accepting this task was a matter of life and death.

Next, I recalled meeting those two rookies. One was a shy-looking college student, and the other was a strikingly handsome young man.

And then... my memory goes blank. I vaguely sensed that a lot happened, but I can't remember anything, as if I just took a nap.

When I opened my eyes again, I found myself in this situation.

At that moment, the beautiful foreign woman spoke again, "And another hero—Anthony!"

"Anthony! Anthony!" The crowd's cheers grew even louder... were they calling for me?

I’m Anthony?

No, wait, I’m Li Xihua, flight instructor Li Xihua!

This is a big problem—I’m trembling all over. If I am Li Xihua, then where is Anthony?

If I am Anthony, why do I only have Li Xihua’s memories?

“Everyone, don’t panic. Anthony might still be adjusting to Earth’s gravity. It’s okay; please assist him by removing his helmet!” the bald man called Akuro said in English.

No, no! Don’t take off my helmet! I screamed internally.

But my body was too weak to move.

Two staff members smiled and approached, helping to detach my helmet from the spacesuit, lifting it off my head.

In the next moment… the scene fell silent.

You could hear a pin drop!

……

……

Akuro’s mouth dropped open. What’s going on? Underneath the helmet was not Anthony, but a young Asian man!

What happened? Where was his buddy Anthony? Where did Anthony go?

What on Earth happened in the space station? Why can’t he remember anything?

The crowd nearby rubbed their eyes in disbelief—Oh my God, can someone tell them where this young Asian man came from?

Where’s Mr. Anthony?

This deafening silence lasted for what felt like an eternity.

Long moments passed, and not a single person reacted.

……

……

At the Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center.

“Spit!!” A flight instructor drinking water sprayed it everywhere, choking as he coughed.

He pointed at the enlarged face of the Asian man on the television screen.

“Xiao Li! That’s Xiao Li, right? I can’t be mistaken; it’s definitely Xiao Li! That hairstyle is from just two days ago when we went to the barber together!” the instructor shouted.

In truth, he didn’t need to remind anyone; the instructors who knew Xiao Li were already stunned, their mouths agape enough to fit a fist.

“What’s happening? Why is Xiao Li appearing in the return capsule from the ‘space station’? And being hailed as a hero returning from space?”

“Returning from space? Xiao Li was just out flying with those two rich kids a few hours ago. What kind of space are they talking about?”

“Could he be a distant relative of Xiao Li? Was that ‘Anthony’ name mentioned before?”

“No way! If Xiao Li had such a relative, I would know! I’m the one who wants to marry Xiao Li’s sister; I know all her relatives by heart!”

“It’s Xiao Li himself! Look at the mole under his left ear; even if he had a twin, they wouldn’t have the same mole!”

The Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center suddenly buzzed with excitement, everyone talking at once.

Kathy was also fixated on the television, thinking deeper than the instructors—she recalled a young man named Scholar Song.

Before boarding the plane, he had to wear a spacesuit.

Such a bizarre action made Kathy ponder even more!

……

……

In the sky, Dou Dou’s helicopter descended quietly, and staff members quickly approached to assist.

Dou Dou hopped off the aircraft with ease, and the nearby staff didn’t stop it. Miss Kathy had specifically instructed them to avoid harming the Pekingese as long as they were careful and kept it away from other aircraft.

Scholar Song stood on Venerable White’s flying sword, both maintaining an invisible state. Scholar Song’s gaze was fixed on the television screen at the Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center.

He saw Instructor Xiao Li’s stiff face filling the entire screen.

Scholar Song couldn’t help but chuckle to himself; they were too late. Instructor Xiao Li had already been brought back to Earth.

Venerable White pointed at the television screen showing Instructor Xiao Li and asked, “What should we do? Go rescue him?”

“What else can we do? Just let it be!” Scholar Song sighed inwardly, pulling out his phone to call Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

Soon, the call connected.

Scholar Song said, “Immortal Sage, Dou Dou has been picked up.”

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain sighed deeply, “That’s good. Keep an eye on it; don’t let it cause more trouble! I’ll send someone to handle the follow-up, so don’t worry.”

“By the way, the plane we took has broken apart and is currently abandoned in Jiangnan City… I’ll send you the coordinates on the map,” Scholar Song added.

“No problem. The team that will handle Dou Dou will also take care of the helicopter issue,” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain replied readily; these were minor matters.

With Immortal Sage’s skills, it would be sorted out in no time.

“There’s one last thing,” Scholar Song said sheepishly, “Didn’t the Americans just send a spacecraft to the space station to retrieve the two astronauts?”

“Is it the space station you crashed into? So what if you crashed? It’s not a big deal. No one in the group invested in that space station, so don’t worry,” Immortal Sage reassured.

“Uh, that’s not the issue I wanted to discuss. Actually, for various reasons… we accidentally left our flight instructor, Xiao Li, at the space station and brought back a certain astronaut named ‘Anthony.’ Right now, he’s on live television being hailed as an astronaut back on American soil, undergoing an interview,” Scholar Song chuckled awkwardly.

On the other end of the line, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain rubbed his face in frustration.

Each and everyone of them just knows how to stir up trouble!

Not only did they create chaos at the space station, but they also dragged it all the way to the Americans across the Earth.

It feels like everyone is getting better at causing trouble lately.

My head hurts, and my liver hurts too!

“Where’s the instructor now?” Immortal Sage sighed, asking.

“From the live broadcast, he’s still sitting in a chair and looks like he’s about to cry. Oh… it seems someone is coming to take him away. Not sure if it’s the FBI or the CIA; I couldn’t see clearly,” Scholar Song weakly replied.

“Just wait; I’ll send someone to you. Is that astronaut named ‘Anthony’ still with you? I’ll contact a friend to arrange a swap for your instructor, but it might take a few days,” Immortal Sage said.

“Sorry for the trouble,” Scholar Song said, feeling embarrassed.

“You’ve worked hard too,” Immortal Sage replied, offering mutual support.

Scholar Song turned to look at the television screen... hoping that Instructor Xiao Li would return safely after being taken away. They say the Americans have a peculiar taste, and with Xiao Li being somewhat handsome, his chastity could be at risk.
