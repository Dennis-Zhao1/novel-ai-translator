**Chapter 1: A Strange Encounter**

“Something weird has definitely crept in here!” 

Instructor Xiao Li stared at the sword at his feet, its blade shining brilliantly under the light. It was sharp too! The way it glinted made it look like an extraordinary sword that could slice through hair. Just a scratch from it could be deadly, right? Instructor Xiao Li felt a wave of panic wash over him.

If this were a play, there wouldn’t be any need for the real deal, would there? Sure, he had heard of some twisted film crews using real weapons for authenticity, but at least those blades weren’t sharpened!

Xiao Li’s mind raced as he called out, “Wait a second, kid! I think you’re misunderstanding something! I’m not a newbie, and I’m definitely not an actor! If this is a theater, I’m just an accidental extra who stumbled in here without knowing what’s going on!”

However… the young man in the blue robe wouldn’t pause or change his course unless he hit the right ‘keyword.’ 

“Newbie, look at my sword!” The boy raised his sword, and in an instant, he flashed right in front of Instructor Xiao Li. With a swift flick of his wrist, the sword’s light split into three, aiming for Xiao Li’s shoulder, abdomen, and thigh.

Xiao Li was just an ordinary person; he couldn’t dodge the boy’s quick strike. He stood there like a wooden puppet, accepting the boy’s sword thrust without any resistance.

Blood splattered from his shoulder, abdomen, and thigh...

It hurt!

Then, Instructor Xiao Li collapsed to the ground, howling in agony—what was going on? What did I ever do to you? Why the hell are you stabbing me right off the bat?

Fortunately, the young man wasn’t trying to kill him; he was just ‘letting the newbie practice swordplay.’ He merely pierced the skin, not aiming to cause lethal harm.

The boy sheathed his sword and looked down at the sprawled Instructor Xiao Li with a puzzled expression. “Huh? Why didn’t you dodge, newbie?”

Dodge? I couldn’t even see the sword clearly!

“Waaah…” Instructor Xiao Li burst into tears, feeling utterly wronged. They say big boys don’t cry easily, but today, he didn’t even know what was happening. Suddenly, he felt an overwhelming sadness and injustice, and he sobbed uncontrollably.

Maybe it was the influence of the memories he had lost? It felt like he had endured a lot of grievances during the time he couldn’t remember anything. So now, combined with the inexplicable sword stab, his sad emotions bubbled over uncontrollably.

Instructor Xiao Li desperately wanted to stop crying, feeling embarrassed to be a grown man sobbing so heartbreakingly in front of a child.

But the more he tried to suppress the tears, the louder his cries became. Soon, his vision blurred with tears, making it hard to even open his eyes.

Seeing him cry so sorrowfully, the young man in the blue robe froze. He rushed to Instructor Xiao Li’s side, worry written all over his face. “Newbie, newbie, what’s wrong?”

As he spoke, the boy gently pressed his finger against the three bleeding wounds on Xiao Li.

Miraculously, the blood stopped flowing.

“I’m not a newbie! I’m not!” Instructor Xiao Li choked out, still sobbing—I'm Li Xihua, the flight instructor Li Xihua!

“Newbie, do you not want to practice swordplay?” The young man seemed to have shifted into another storyline mode, unfazed by Xiao Li's tears.

“Let’s do something different today, and we can try the new stuff tomorrow. Didn’t you tell me last time that you wanted to learn some boxing techniques? How about I teach you some boxing?” The young man asked cheerfully.

This new storyline resembled the time when the young man had taught Scholar Song the basics of swordplay in a ‘real illusion.’

“I don’t want to! I want to go home!” Instructor Xiao Li protested.

Yet, the boy paid him no mind. Instead, he gently pulled Instructor Xiao Li upright from the ground.

“Watch closely, newbie! This is the basic boxing technique!” The boy declared, demonstrating a set of punches right in front of Xiao Li.

For a cultivator, this was standard foundational boxing, the same kind the Alchemical Sage had initially wanted to teach Scholar Song. However, after acquiring the poisonous dragon grass, he had switched to teaching Scholar Song the ‘Diamond Foundation Boxing.’

After finishing the demonstration, the young man turned back to Xiao Li. “Did you remember it?”

Instructor Xiao Li was utterly confused. What? Remember what?

It wasn’t like this was a series of calisthenics you could learn just by watching once!

Even for calisthenics, you had to watch several times and practice before you could learn them!

“Remember well, and we will practice boxing, okay?” The blue-robed boy flashed a bright smile.

“I didn’t remember anything!” Instructor Xiao Li roared.

But before he could finish, the young man lunged at him like a tiger, delivering a punch straight to his head.

In an instant, everything went dark for Instructor Xiao Li... he fainted dead away, losing consciousness.

Yet even as he lay unconscious, the boy showed no signs of stopping.

Fists rained down like a storm, mercilessly pummeling him, similar to the fate of the puppet substitute at the hands of the past leader, Jing Mo.

Fortunately, the blue-robed boy had switched to boxing midway; if it had been with the sword… Instructor Xiao Li would have been turned into a sieve.

While unconscious, Instructor Xiao Li let out muffled groans of pain, his body curling up in agony like a cooked shrimp.

It hurt so much! Was this hell?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Time passed, though how long he couldn’t tell, until Scholar Song finally regained consciousness.

“Hisssss…” As soon as he woke up, he felt a searing pain all over his body.

“Scholar, you’re awake!” Beside him, Venerable White was pressing his hand on Song’s body, channeling pure spiritual energy into him.

Scholar Song felt the pain and injuries healing rapidly under the influence of Venerable White’s energy.

Venerable White had finally come out of his closed-door retreat! Song’s heart swelled with gratitude and emotion.

“Scholar, did anything happen while I was in seclusion? Why do you look like you’ve been struck by lightning? When I found you, you were all charred!” Venerable White asked, his brow furrowed.

“It’s nothing! Just a little incident! I got a sudden whim to stick my finger into a power outlet and got electrocuted,” Scholar Song said, spinning a little white lie.

“Is that so?” Venerable White nodded, half believing him. Then he asked, “And what about Instructor Xiao Li? When I found him, he was gravely injured, looking like he might die any moment. Luckily, I arrived in time to treat him.”

Scholar Song sighed, realizing that Instructor Xiao Li hadn’t escaped his fate after all. “Oh, poor guy! He must have been through quite a lot of abuse over there! This is all my fault for dragging him into this mess!”

Venerable White nodded, still skeptical.

“By the way, Venerable White, when they brought Instructor Xiao Li over, they mentioned that there were some issues with erasing his memories. They didn’t manage to wipe all of his memories from ‘the Americans.’ So, I was hoping you could help delete his memories one more time to avoid leaving traces,” Scholar Song said, recalling what his senior brother Zhou Li had told him.

Venerable White nodded, “I’ll give it a try. To be honest, I’m not very skilled at memory deletion.”

Moreover, repeatedly erasing memories in a short time could cause some unavoidable harm to a person’s brain.

As he spoke, Venerable White moved to Instructor Xiao Li’s side, placing a hand on his forehead.

The memory-cleansing spell was cast again, wiping Instructor Xiao Li’s memories back to the moment he encountered the two wealthy students on July 9th.

“Done! However… since the previous deletion wasn’t complete, there might still be some fragments left. But it should be fine,” Venerable White clapped his hands, saying.

“Will he suddenly remember those memory fragments someday?” Scholar Song asked, a bit worried. He feared Instructor Xiao Li might recall the abuse he suffered and be distraught.

“As long as he’s not triggered, he shouldn’t remember,” Venerable White replied, though he lacked certainty because memory deletion wasn’t his forte.

“Anyway, I hope he can live happily from now on,” Scholar Song thought somberly.

These past few days must have been terrible for Instructor Xiao Li.

…

…

Morning, 9:23 AM.

Venerable White rode his flying sword, bringing Scholar Song, Instructor Xiao Li, and some luggage to the ‘underground parking lot’ in the Jiangnan region.

A few days ago, the agent for the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain had called to say that all the cars had arrived, just waiting for Scholar Song to come by and verify them.

Today, since Scholar Song planned to return to Wenzhou City with Venerable White, he called the agent to come over and complete the verification and sign the contracts.

This batch included thirty-one vehicles, just like last time, with various brands, price ranges, and styles.

As before, all the cars were registered under Scholar Song’s name. The vehicle registration certificates bore only his name.

Scholar Song scanned the parking lot, noting that this second batch consisted mostly of luxury cars, with several sports cars in view.

Wait a minute, it seems there’s something strange mixed in with this batch!

Scholar Song’s gaze landed on three particularly conspicuous vehicles among the luxury cars—they were large, with wild designs: one tractor, one mini excavator, and one bulldozer…

“Are these three also from Mr. Huang Wenzhong?” Scholar Song asked, sweat beading on his forehead.

“Yes, all ordered by Mr. Huang Wenzhong,” the agent replied, wiping the sweat from his brow. Honestly, he’d been flabbergasted when he saw the tractor, excavator, and bulldozer on the contract.

“Alright, thanks for your hard work,” Scholar Song sighed and finally signed his name on the contract.

The agent beamed with joy—this transaction amounted to several million in profit!

…

…

After the agent left, Scholar Song stretched. “Venerable White, let’s pick a car to drive back to Wenzhou City. And we need to drop off Instructor Xiao Li at the flight school first!”
