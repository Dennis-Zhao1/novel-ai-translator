**Dao Techniques, Dao Techniques!**

“I've studied the 'Basic Diamond Fist Technique,' and my meditation method is the 'True Self Meditation Technique,'” Scholar Song replied honestly. After a moment of thought, he added, “Maybe I’ve learned a bit of the 'Flame Blade' too?”

Venerable White nodded, acknowledging that he had only learned the basics of martial arts.

In that case, it would be better for him to complete the basics for Scholar Song.

A cultivator should not only master the foundational body refining techniques and meditation methods but also possess a light-body technique for dodging and evasion.

Moreover, since Scholar Song had successfully built his foundation and opened his second acupoint, he had sufficient blood energy within him. Coupled with the mid-tier Phantom Spirit in his body, he should be able to learn a basic Dao technique that could utilize his blood energy—something like 'Palm Thunder,' a foundational Dao technique that could be executed with just blood energy, making it ideal for Scholar Song at this stage.

And of course, the 'Basic Diamond Fist Technique' should have accompanying advanced techniques, Venerable White thought to himself. However, he would need to ask in the group chat or check the trading section of the Cultivator's Daily for those.

First, he would teach Scholar Song a light-body technique, followed by 'Palm Thunder.'

A cultivator's light-body technique is not just about dodging and moving lightly; it serves a deeper purpose.

The light-body technique can also have a body tempering effect when practiced. It’s similar to how running can build physical strength. Once you learn the light-body technique and integrate it into your daily life, every step you take is a form of training. Although it's not as effective as specialized body refining techniques, it excels in its gradual, steady enhancement.

“Follow me!” Venerable White exclaimed, grabbing Scholar Song. A flying sword shot out from his sleeve, landing beneath them and transforming into a streak of light, propelling them upward into the sky.

Inside the room, Dou Dou let out a quiet sigh of relief.

Then, it temporarily exited the game to start reinforcing the defensive formations around the building. Before Venerable White returned, it planned to add another ten to twenty layers of defensive arrays.

The sugar-laden young master of the Empty Thief Sect clasped her hands in a prayer-like gesture, murmuring her prayers, though no one knew what she was hoping for.

…… 

Venerable White led Scholar Song to a secluded area deep within the mountains behind Jiangnan University City, where they landed in an open space devoid of any onlookers.

Scholar Song, puzzled, asked, “Senior, why have you brought me here?”

“This place is spacious. I’ll demonstrate several types of ‘light-body techniques’ for you. Watch closely and choose one to learn,” Venerable White replied with a chuckle.

Light-body techniques? Scholar Song's eyes lit up. “Snow-Tracking Steps? Dragonfly Skimming Water?”

“Yes, the techniques you mentioned can indeed be practiced,” Venerable White acknowledged. “However, there are many types of light-body techniques, each with different focuses. Some emphasize evasion, others speed, while some prioritize weightlessness or stealth, making one undetectable. There are even techniques that are ghostly and unpredictable. Just watch carefully.”

With that, he stepped out, moving in a peculiar rhythm. After five steps, a myriad of illusions suddenly surrounded him, creating a mesmerizing spectacle. Moreover, Venerable White moved with a grace akin to dance, looking absolutely stunning.

“This is the 'Illusionary Body Technique,' which belongs to the category of unpredictable techniques,” Venerable White explained.

Then, he shifted forms once more. With a heavy and swift step, he suddenly appeared behind Scholar Song, startling him.

“This is the 'Instantaneous Shape.' I slowed down specifically to show you. In reality, you’d only see me disappear and reappear. This technique emphasizes speed,” Venerable White elaborated.

Next, he demonstrated a powerful and aggressive step technique, explaining, “This is a technique from the Buddhist school, known as the 'Tiger Subduing Steps.' It appears forceful, yet it contains countless variations. Strong on the outside, gentle on the inside. It’s suitable for both offense and defense and is great for a newcomer like you.”

As Scholar Song observed this technique, he was struck by its impressive aura.

But when Venerable White mentioned it was a Buddhist technique, he recalled the 'True Self' in his consciousness sea—his 'True Self' had recently become increasingly muscular, with his hair getting shorter by the day. If he learned this 'Tiger Subduing Steps,' his 'True Self' might end up bald, right?

“Then, this is a hidden attribute technique I learned long ago, called 'Shadow Stealth.'” Venerable White stepped into the shadow of a nearby tree, and without any apparent movement, he suddenly vanished from sight.

A moment later, he reemerged from the shadow, “However, this technique requires the presence of a shadow, which limits its use.”

“Besides these, I have another technique you can learn; I learned it from an exchange with a scholar from the Confucian school. It’s called 'Gentleman’s Journey of a Thousand Miles,' which implies that reading thousands of books is not as valuable as traveling thousands of miles.”

He continued, “Confucian techniques tend to be verbose and long-winded in their explanations. However, this technique is quite good—it’s suitable for long-distance travel without tiring. 

Furthermore, as the name suggests, once you walk a thousand miles, you’ll become proficient enough to use it effectively in small-scale evasions. After traveling tens of thousands of miles, you’ll be like a swan, skimming over water.”

In short, this technique is about the 'journey of a thousand miles.' The longer you walk, the more potent the technique becomes.”

As he spoke, Venerable White began to demonstrate the technique.

He started to walk forward slowly, appearing just like an ordinary person. His pace was unhurried, but upon closer inspection, Scholar Song noticed that Venerable White's speed was astonishing—several times faster than his own full-speed run.

Moreover, as he walked, there were countless subtle variations in his movements.

After finishing the demonstration, Venerable White turned to Scholar Song and asked, “So, have you decided which technique to learn?”

“Senior, can I learn more than one?” Scholar Song felt that all these techniques had their unique advantages, making it hard to choose just one!

“Don't be greedy,” Venerable White chuckled. “With your current cultivation level, learning multiple techniques would require too much time, and it would only slow down your advancement. It’s best to focus on one light-body technique for now and practice diligently. Once you reach the second tier and transform your blood energy into true energy, you can consider learning additional techniques to enhance your agility.”

Scholar Song nodded, deep in thought.

He wouldn’t consider the 'Tiger Subduing Steps' for now… unless there were no better options.

'Shadow Stealth' had too many limitations, making it unsuitable as a primary technique, but it could be useful later as a supplementary skill.

While the 'Illusionary Body Technique' seemed intriguing, it still felt slightly lacking compared to the other two.

In the end, his choice lay between 'Instantaneous Shape' and 'Gentleman’s Journey of a Thousand Miles.'

'Instantaneous Shape' was undoubtedly a powerful technique, capable of breaking through countless defenses with its speed. Suddenly appearing behind an enemy to strike was quite practical. However, its initial energy consumption was high, and it required significant bodily demands, making it unsuitable for continuous use.

On the other hand, while 'Gentleman’s Journey of a Thousand Miles' lacked the inherent advantages of 'Instantaneous Shape,' it excelled in versatility and had significant potential for growth.

Scholar Song pondered for a moment before asking, “What technique would you recommend, Senior?”

“Well, if I were to recommend, I would suggest 'Tiger Subduing Steps.' Since you have already learned the 'Basic Diamond Fist Technique' and 'True Self Meditation Sutra,' it would pair nicely with the Tiger Subduing Steps,” Venerable White replied after some thought.

“I understand! Senior… I choose 'Gentleman’s Journey of a Thousand Miles!'” Scholar Song declared decisively.

“Huh? But I recommended 'Tiger Subduing Steps,'” Venerable White said, surprised.

“It’s alright, Senior. 'Gentleman’s Journey of a Thousand Miles' is excellent! I trust your judgment!” Scholar Song replied, clenching his fist.

“Alright then, I’ll teach you the 'Gentleman’s Journey of a Thousand Miles' technique and its mantra,” Venerable White chuckled.

He began to teach Scholar Song the methods and mantras for practicing the technique step by step. Afterwards, he guided Scholar Song through a hands-on practice of the 'Gentleman’s Journey of a Thousand Miles.'

Once they finished, Venerable White smiled and asked, “Did you remember everything?”

“I’ve got it all down,” Scholar Song nodded. With some practice alongside the technique's mantra, he would soon master this light-body technique.

“Now, you should practice it a few more times on your own. The 'Gentleman’s Journey of a Thousand Miles' is truly suitable for integrating into daily life. You can practice it while walking, continually improving your proficiency,” Venerable White said with a gentle smile, then he sat down nearby, watching Scholar Song practice.

Occasionally, he would offer pointers on minor flaws, aiming to help Scholar Song achieve perfection.

……

As Scholar Song finally mastered the basics of the 'Gentleman’s Journey of a Thousand Miles,' it was already nearing five o'clock. He let out a sigh of relief, feeling a slight increase in the blood energy within his acupoints, his heart swelling with joy.

Venerable White lightly applauded, saying, “Very good. From here on, it’s up to you to practice diligently. Lastly, I have a Dao technique to teach you.”

“Dao technique?!” Upon hearing this, Scholar Song's eyes sparkled with excitement.

A Dao technique! He had thought he would have to wait until reaching the second tier, when his blood energy transformed into true energy, to come into contact with Dao techniques. He never expected to use a Dao technique while still in the first tier!

“It’s just a very basic Dao technique, with minimal lethality. However, it’s quite effective against ghostly entities. You can use your blood energy and runes to cast it,” Venerable White explained.

“What Dao technique is it?” Scholar Song asked eagerly. Since entering the world of cultivators, he had learned and witnessed many wondrous things, but he had only cultivated a few abilities akin to martial skills.

“‘Palm Thunder,’ a basic lightning technique. Once you grow stronger, you can further develop into its advanced version, 'Heavenly Thunder in the Palm.' The advanced version packs quite a punch,” Venerable White elaborated.

The reason he chose to teach Scholar Song 'Palm Thunder' was that he planned to take the little girl from the Empty Thief Sect out tomorrow to retrieve his flying sword, Meteor.

Meanwhile, Scholar Song was preparing to visit the neighboring city in the next couple of days to seek out the ghost cultivator known as 'the Altar Master.'

With their schedules overlapping, Venerable White wouldn’t be able to accompany Scholar Song on his trip to the neighboring city, so he decided to impart this lightning technique, specifically effective against ghostly entities, to Scholar Song for self-defense.
