**Just a USB Drive**

“Wait, what? Why are you asking that?” Scholar Song looked puzzled.

“Because yesterday afternoon, I saw someone asking around the school about ‘Scholar Song from Jiangnan University City.’ They dug up information about your class, age, residence, and even your close acquaintances. It felt off to me, so I noted it down. By the way, I’m a member of the school’s news department,” Zhuge Yue said with a cheerful smile.

“Someone’s investigating me?” Scholar Song was taken aback; he couldn’t recall having offended anyone recently.

The Alchemical Sage had mentioned someone trailing him before. Maybe someone noticed him with the Alchemical Sage and decided to follow and dig up his information. But the Alchemical Sage had only arrived this morning!

Besides, yesterday evening, he had fought against some troublemakers while playing the hero to save a beauty. But that was all from the previous night, unrelated to what happened yesterday afternoon!

Scholar Song couldn’t piece together any clues.

“In any case, I think you should be careful lately. Someone might be plotting against you. That’s all I wanted to say. I have to leave now, so take care,” Zhuge Yue said with a giggle, patting Scholar Song’s shoulder before humming a tune as she left the dorm.

“Thanks,” Scholar Song replied.

If someone’s plotting against him, he wasn’t too worried about it. However, the fact that they were investigating not just him, but also his friends and family, made him uneasy.

For now… he needed to be cautious.

When the Alchemical Sage arrived later, he would ask if there was a way to find out who was behind the investigation. The Alchemical Sage seemed quite experienced in tracking evasion.

……

With these thoughts in mind, Scholar Song entered his bedroom.

Gao Moumou was still lying there like a dead dog, unmoving. Scholar Song worriedly asked, “Hey, Gao Moumou, are you alright?”

“Scholar, I’ve been tainted,” Gao Moumou muttered.

“‘Tainted’ is such an inappropriate term. You’re not some ancient maiden, so stop using such disgusting descriptions,” Scholar Song said, giving Gao a pat before casually asking, “By the way, was that Zhuge Yue just now a guy?”

Gao Moumou’s face turned pale, and after a long pause, he bitterly shook his head. “No.”

“Then it’s a girl? You’ve got to be kidding me! Why act like you’ve been ruined after being kissed by a girl? You’re just showing off, you know that?” Scholar Song slapped Gao Moumou on the back. “Don’t worry, I’m tight-lipped. I won’t let your girlfriend know about today’s incident. Just think of it as some unexpected good fortune!”

However, Gao Moumou’s expression grew even worse, and he shook his head even more desperately.

“What does your shaking head mean? Could it be… Zhuge Yue isn’t a girl either? What the heck? Don’t tell me she’s a hermaphrodite or a transgender?” Scholar Song was confused.

“Neither… it’s just that you guys wouldn’t understand this kind of thing,” Gao Moumou tilted his head, looking as if he had given up on love for life.

This guy was hopeless.

“Alright, you just keep lying there,” Scholar Song said, giving Gao Moumou another pat.

Then he hummed a tune as he walked to the balcony, staring up at the sky.

I wonder what it’s like to send messages using flying swords?

……

After lying there in a half-dead state for more than ten minutes, Gao Moumou finally got up numbly and washed his face. “Scholar, Tu Bo said he wants to have a few drinks tonight. Let’s go hang out at Yangde. You free?”

Scholar Song thought for a moment before replying, “No problem, but I have a friend coming over later to pick up something. I might be a bit late, probably around six!”

“Then I’ll head over first. Today… I want to get completely drunk,” Gao Moumou said with a forlorn expression.

“Drinking to drown sorrows?” Scholar Song laughed.

Gao Moumou nodded and pushed open the dorm room door. “I’ll go ahead; remember to come early.”

“Got it, no problem.”

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Time ticked by.

Scholar Song felt like he was a ‘waiting husband stone,’ his gaze fixed on the sky, his heart filled with anticipation.

About twenty minutes later, at 4:07 PM.

The Alchemical Sage finally had news; he called, “Scholar, Master Tongxuan’s flying sword message is on its way. I’m coming over to you now; you’re alone, right?”

“No problem, my dorm mate is going out for drinks tonight, so I’m the only one here,” Scholar Song quickly replied.

“Wait for me; I’ll be there right away.” The Alchemical Sage hung up.

Two minutes later.

The Alchemical Sage arrived by Scholar Song’s side.

“Here!” he said with a hearty laugh.

“What are we supposed to do?” Scholar Song asked. “Do we just sit here and wait?”

“Just watch me,” the Alchemical Sage said as he stepped back onto the balcony, then pointed at the sky. His fingers turned a bright red and started to flicker.

Scholar Song’s eyes were glued to the sky, and he saw a flickering light in the distance rapidly flying toward the Alchemical Sage.

The light got closer and closer, moving at an incredible speed—he could faintly see that it was a sword-like object.

“A flying sword message out in the open like this, without any concealment or tricks?” Suddenly, Scholar Song had an epiphany—could it be that the UFOs and flying objects people often captured on camera in recent years were actually cultivators sending messages via flying swords, or perhaps they were simply flying on their swords?

Cultivators doing this was quite dangerous; with technology advancing rapidly, every country had anti-aircraft systems and aerial defense systems deployed. What if they got shot down by an anti-aircraft gun?

While Scholar Song was lost in thought, the flying sword had already landed beside the Alchemical Sage.

It was a sharp little black iron sword, hovering silently above the Alchemical Sage’s glowing red finger, defying the laws of physics completely.

Scholar Song remained unfazed; since his worldview had been shattered that day, he had already discarded most of the physics knowledge he learned over eighteen years. If it weren’t for the fact that physical laws still applied in the mortal world, he would have thrown the rest away long ago.

“Hmm? Where’s the secret manual?” Scholar Song suddenly asked, thinking that the flying sword should have a large package attached, filled with scrolls or manuscripts.

But the black iron sword in front of him had nothing attached; it was completely empty.

“Did it get lost during the flight?” Scholar Song wondered.

“The manual is right here.” The Alchemical Sage reached out, and the black iron sword landed steadily in his hand. Then, he removed a thumb-sized jade tube from the sword's hilt, which looked a bit like a jade thumb ring.

A jade tube? Upon seeing this, a name flashed into Scholar Song’s mind, and he blurted out, “Transmission jade slip?”

Also known as inheritance jade slips or transmission law jade slips.

This was one of the essential items that protagonists in cultivation novels must obtain! Just stick it to your head, and the cultivation techniques and mental methods would be imprinted in your mind! Even a fool could remember an entire cultivation technique!

“You’re overthinking it…” The Alchemical Sage shrugged. “Transmission jade slips are incredibly precious, invaluable in themselves. They are only used to record those ‘unrecordable in words’ supreme techniques. Ordinary foundational techniques like this aren’t worthy of being recorded in a transmission jade slip.”

Only those supreme techniques that embody the laws of the universe and profound truths cannot be recorded in writing. Even if someone forced them into writing, the laws of the universe would erase them, hence the need for precious items like ‘transmission jade slips’ to record them.

“Then what is this?” Scholar Song asked.

“This is just a regular USB drive. To be honest, as human technology advances, many inventions are also quite handy for us cultivators. A small USB drive can store the contents of an entire scripture pavilion and even include videos; it’s incredibly convenient,” the Alchemical Sage calmly crushed Scholar Song’s illusions again.

Ouch, Mom, my liver hurts so much!
