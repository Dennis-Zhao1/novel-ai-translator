**Chapter Title: Aiming for the Cosmos**

“Is the goal the sky? How naive! It’s the universe!” 

Scholar Song thought to himself, still feeling slightly incredulous. 

After spending so much time meditating and cultivating, who would have thought it could lead to something as unfortunate as hemorrhoids? Sure, sitting for long periods was a known culprit for that condition, but really? 

In his short time as a novice cultivator—just over a month—Scholar Song had been fortunate enough to open his heart and eye orifices in one go. He couldn’t even begin to imagine what it must be like for lower-tier cultivators who sat in meditation every day for years on end. 

And don’t even get him started on what the little monk described about meditating on “Fire Rock” and “Ice Stone.” Those were likely treasures the sects used to enhance their disciples' meditation efficiency, right? Just like the “Cold Jade Bed” from the Tomb Sect?

In any case, Scholar Song felt like he’d gained some insights today. 

But surely cultivators had ways to deal with hemorrhoids? Otherwise, wouldn’t every low-tier cultivator be plagued by them? 

Moreover...

“Guoguo, don’t you take the body-refining elixir?” he asked, genuinely curious.

He remembered vividly the first time he took the body-refining elixir; it had cleared out all the hidden injuries in his body. Although the effects diminished with each subsequent dose, it still had some refining effects.

Surely hemorrhoids could be treated with just a single dose of the elixir, right? 

It should... approximately... work, right? Unless this little guy had taken too many body-refining elixirs beforehand, rendering them ineffective for him?

“I thought about the body-refining elixir too, but it didn’t work,” the little monk Guoguo sighed heavily, his small face clouded with sorrow.

Then he lowered his voice further. “The first time I took the elixir, I didn’t have any hemorrhoids. But the effects were really good; all my hidden injuries were cleared out. 

Then, after two years of meditating on Fire Rock and Ice Stone, when the hemorrhoids came, I immediately thought of the body-refining elixir. I took it right away, but for some reason, it didn’t work on my hemorrhoids.”

In reality, it didn’t matter how low Guoguo tried to keep his voice—Venerable White, with his immense cultivation level, could hear every word clearly, even if they were a thousand meters apart. And as for Dou Dou, being a Pekingese, its hearing was top-notch.

Of course, Scholar Song wouldn’t expose the truth. 

Hearing this, he quietly turned his head to glance at Venerable White.

The Venerable subtly moved his lips, sending a message to Scholar Song: “The little monk has consumed too many ordinary-quality body-refining elixirs... Now, regular elixirs have little effect on his body. Only high-quality elixirs would work.”

So that’s how it is, Scholar Song thought, letting out a quiet sigh.

While scattered cultivators were exhausting themselves and going bankrupt trying to concoct a batch of body-refining elixirs, elite disciples from sects had already drunk them to the point of vomiting. Such was the advantage of sect accumulation.

Guoguo, unaware of Scholar Song’s realization, continued in a hushed voice, “Plus, recently, my master wants me to go to the Thousand Layer Hell’s cave, an ice-and-fire duality place to speed up my cultivation. I feel like if I go to the Thousand Layer Hell, my hemorrhoids will get worse, so I thought I’d come out for a small operation to prevent future issues!”

“I’ve even found a hospital; it’s minimally invasive, painless, and won’t relapse!” The little monk's face lit up with hope.

Scholar Song sighed in response. Sure, it might be painless, but the claim of it not relapsing sounded like pure advertisement. In this day and age, advertisements with such enticing promises were often designed to deceive pure-hearted souls like Guoguo.

After his sigh, Scholar Song asked, “Little guy, why don’t you talk to your master about this? Master Tongxuan must have some way to treat this little issue, right?”

“My master is currently meditating in silence. Everything in the temple is being managed by Uncle Tongmiao from the Discipline Institute. If I were to ask Uncle Tongmiao, he’d surely say: This little issue can be overcome with willpower alone. This... is also part of cultivation!” Guoguo mimicked Uncle Tongmiao’s tone. “Because Uncle Tongmiao follows the path of the ascetic.”

Ascetics: Our suffering is our joy. The more we suffer, the more we can appreciate the sweetness within the bitterness! So, let the hemorrhoids come even stronger!

Scholar Song couldn’t help but twitch at the corners of his mouth. “Then why not ask your senior brother from three days ago? They’ve been through it and must have some solutions!”

“No way! That’s too embarrassing; this is something my senior brother absolutely cannot know!” Guoguo declared firmly. “So, I think it’s best to just get the surgery done. Once it’s over, I won’t have to worry about relapses, and then I won’t fear going to the Thousand Layer Hell!”

Scholar Song gently pinched the little monk’s cheek. “Alright, then. Good luck! If it’s just for treating hemorrhoids, our Jiangnan University City Affiliated Hospital is a good option. They do minimally invasive surgeries there; I can take you to get it treated.”

Guoguo pondered for a moment before replying, “Okay, I’ll give it a try!”

Scholar Song shrugged his shoulders. “Come on, I’ll assign you a room. And while you’re staying here, you absolutely cannot run around, understand? Otherwise, I won’t be able to explain it to your senior brother!”

“I understand! I won’t cause you any more trouble!” Guoguo said obediently.

Scholar Song nodded—hopefully, this little guy would indeed be as well-behaved as he claimed.

After all, he was a good person, unable to refuse such a simple request as “taking care of the little monk.”

...

After arranging Guoguo’s room, the little monk settled in and closed his eyes to recuperate—he needed to recover from the exhaustion of flying on the sword for over four hours.

Scholar Song returned downstairs, where Venerable White was inserting a USB drive into the computer, preparing to work on the “Indestructible Diamond Body” technique.

Because it was a branch of the “Basic Diamond Fist” cultivation method, the techniques of the “Indestructible Diamond Body” were similar, comprising a few images and mantras.

However, it was an auxiliary technique with only two illustrations and a line of mantras.

The method was to focus on the images for a while to memorize the content, then take a relaxed look at it again, which would allow him to enter an illusory space and receive the inheritance of the “Indestructible Diamond Body.”

Once Scholar Song grasped the cultivation method, Venerable White guided him on a little technique called “Charging Technique.”

This involved using his vital energy to draw a lightning symbol in his palm. Compared to the lightning symbol of “Palm Lightning,” this one was much simpler. All he had to do was point it at the phone or laptop that needed charging.

Charge until full; any excess energy would dissipate naturally.

Scholar Song quickly mastered this “Charging Technique.”

However... he couldn’t shake the feeling that Venerable White’s method differed slightly from the content left by the Wild Blade of Three Tides in their group space.

Did Venerable White modify this “Charging Technique”?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

The next day, July 9th.

When Scholar Song woke up early and opened his door, he found Venerable White pacing back and forth in the corridor outside his room.

“Good morning, Venerable White,” Scholar Song greeted.

“Good morning, Scholar Song.” Venerable White smiled, happily handing over a tablet. He pulled up a message for Scholar Song to see.

It was a message from the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

“Venerable White, I have arranged for you and Scholar Song to participate in flight training. On July 9th, an agent will deliver your Class II medical examination certificate and private pilot license (PPL). The agent will escort you to a specialized airport for a test flight. I wish you a pleasant flight! —Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.”

Venerable White wore a blissful smile, clearly in a good mood.

“Delivering the medical examination certificate and pilot license?” Scholar Song rubbed his eyes in disbelief. “I haven’t even touched a plane before, and you’re giving me a license directly, Elder Huang?”

“Mm-hmm, don’t mind the details! Hurry up and get ready!” Venerable White chirped happily. “Someone will be here soon to take us to the specialized airport for the test flight! Don’t be late!”

“Alright, Elder, no problem! I’ll get ready and wait to set off!” Scholar Song beamed at Venerable White.

“Good, make it quick!” Venerable White hummed a tune, then took the tablet and headed downstairs.

Once Venerable White was gone, Dou Dou quietly emerged. Without a word, it shook its body, shedding a single strand of dog hair.

Then, it silently handed the dog hair to Scholar Song. “Take this; keep it on you just in case!”

“Dou Dou!” Scholar Song exclaimed, excited—at a critical moment, Dou Dou was truly dependable!

Dou Dou heavily patted Scholar Song with its paw before quietly returning to its own room.

Once back in its room, Dou Dou revealed a human-like grin. “Heh heh, Yellow Mountain, you won’t let me learn to drive a car, so I’m going to learn to fly a plane instead!”

So, it turned out... that strand of dog hair wasn’t meant for Scholar Song’s protection after all?

...

Unaware of the truth, poor Scholar Song carefully tucked the dog hair away, then quickly opened his chat app.

As expected, there was a message from the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain waiting for him.

“Scholar Song, I’ve arranged for you and Venerable White to take flight training. On July 9th, someone will deliver your medical examination certificate and flight license. Then they’ll take you to learn how to fly a plane. I hope you enjoy yourselves! —Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.”

Scholar Song replied, “Elder Huang, couldn’t you have told me this a few days in advance so I could mentally prepare?”

At that moment, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain was online: “Haha, didn’t I already tell you that I would arrange for you to learn to fly soon? Plus, it’s not easy to get you two inserted into the flight training program. Seize the opportunity and stop complaining!”

“Fine,” Scholar Song sighed, “But I have one additional request. Elder Huang, please make sure to prepare me a full ‘spacesuit’ and the accompanying oxygen equipment!”

“Why do you need those? It’s just a flight in the blue sky!” the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain asked.

“Elder Huang,” Scholar Song said gravely, “When I’m with Venerable White, my goal isn’t merely the blue sky. My journey is into the cosmos!” 

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain: “……”
