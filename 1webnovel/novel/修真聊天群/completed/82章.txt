**The Foreigner Monk and the Mysterious Car Accident Scene**

As the train pulled into the Jingli Square Station, Father Song, dressed in a white shirt, nodded at Scholar Song and then moved with his young wife towards the subway exit to secure a good spot for their exit at the next station.

He had intended to leave a business card for Scholar Song, but since he was out with family for a day of fun, he hadn’t brought any cards with him. He decided against it; after all, they were just passing strangers, and it was unlikely they would meet again... or so he thought.

The subway was relatively empty at Jingli Square Station. As the doors opened, passengers filed out in an orderly fashion, and those on the platform lined up to board.

The last person to board was a tall, bald white man, who caught everyone’s attention.

Bald white men weren’t uncommon, but a bald head adorned with six neatly arranged prayer scars was quite a rarity.

This man was the real deal—a foreign monk, towering over everyone at over six feet tall, with a shiny bald head. Despite the sweltering heat, he wore a thick monk’s robe that wrapped around him tightly. He held a string of prayer beads in his hands, murmuring under his breath with an air of professionalism.

Is being a monk really such a lucrative job these days? Even foreigners are coming to take a slice of the pie?

They say foreign monks have a way with words. Being from so far away must grant them a certain allure, right?

As the passengers on the subway caught sight of the foreign monk, they instinctively kept their distance. In this scorching weather, even just looking at his heavy attire made them feel unbearably hot. Being too close felt as if they were being enveloped by waves of heat radiating from him!

Scholar Song instinctively glanced at the foreign monk—his towering physique and robust energy were clearly above that of an ordinary person. Furthermore, his spiritual energy was terrifyingly powerful; in his vigilant state, Scholar Song could sense the stark difference between their spiritual strengths. If Scholar Song's spiritual energy was like a small light bulb, then the monk's was akin to a massive searchlight!

However, it seemed the monk couldn't control his immense spiritual energy, letting it scatter chaotically around him.

This guy isn’t ordinary—could he be a cultivator too? Scholar Song pondered.

He quickly closed his eyes again, entering a state of heightened vigilance, using this focus to mask his aura. Until he had strong enough power, he didn’t want to expose his identity as a cultivator—he understood all too well the troubles that could bring.

Once on the subway, the foreign monk scanned his surroundings as if searching for something, his brows knitting tightly together.

He didn’t take any further action, instead quietly leaning against the subway wall while reciting scriptures in Chinese, his pronunciation precise—this foreigner must have a level eight proficiency in Chinese.

As the train slowly started moving, the passengers swayed slightly, and then the subway accelerated.

The stretch from Jingli Square Station to the next stop headed towards the suburbs was over 4,400 meters long, making it one of the longer stretches on the line, as all tracks were underground. Due to numerous junctions and turns, the subway’s speed couldn’t pick up much, and this segment would take nearly thirteen minutes to complete.

Father Song cautiously held his daughter in his arms, but the little girl, perhaps feeling the absence of Scholar Song's cooling presence, stirred restlessly in her sleep.

The young mother waved her delicate hand beside her daughter, trying to dispel the heat enveloping them. Just like in the station, the subway car was also stifling due to the crowd.

…

…

About six minutes into the subway ride, Scholar Song suddenly furrowed his brow, bracing his feet firmly.

Then, the train jolted violently, the handrails and overhead rings swinging and colliding.

Passengers clung desperately to handrails, poles, and rings, yet still swayed dangerously, some losing their balance and tumbling to the floor. “What the hell is happening?!”

“Damn! We've had junctions and turns before, but not like this!”

“Ahhh!” The young mother plopped down next to Scholar Song, wincing in pain as tears filled her eyes.

Father Song staggered back a few steps, unable to steady himself, and fell backward.

Scholar Song stepped forward, gently pushing the back of the man in the white shirt. He used soft strength, applying a technique from the foundational skills of the Iron Fist style.

The white-shirted father regained his balance, turning to see the gentle Scholar Song and expressing his gratitude. “Thank you.”

“Not at all... but hold on, the shaking isn’t over yet,” Scholar Song replied.

In his vigilant state, his senses were heightened—he realized the subway had abruptly braked, causing the violent shaking. This rough jolt was not a one-time occurrence; it would continue until the train came to a complete stop.

Could there have been an accident up ahead?

As he contemplated this, the shaking intensified, causing the entire compartment to sway.

Along with it came the frantic alarm bells from the subway.

Suddenly, all the lights in the subway went out, and passengers toppled like dominoes. Many were hurled against the walls of the train, eliciting cries of pain.

In such chaos, Scholar Song could barely maintain his footing.

The young mother, sprawled on the ground in shock, was dragged along by inertia. Though Father Song had managed to grasp the handrail thanks to Scholar Song’s warning, the force was too great; he couldn’t hold on and fell sideways.

The little girl was thrown from her father’s arms, her eyes wide with terror.

Seeing this, Scholar Song quickly extended his arm like a dragon’s claw, using gentle strength to grab the little girl’s clothes. At the same time, he subtly adjusted his wrist to dissipate her momentum in mid-air, cradling the frightened little girl in his embrace.

Inside the dimly lit subway, Scholar Song’s view was limited by the darkness. The little girl pressed tightly against him, not daring to move. Despite her fear, she remained remarkably quiet, holding back her tears.

“What’s happening?”

“Did we derail? Or flip over? Ouch, this hurts!” someone shouted in panic.

“Help me! I'm pinned down… it hurts so much, I can’t move.”

“No… cough, cough. I must be dreaming.” A wounded person groaned in agony.

“Don’t crush me… get off me! I think my ribs are broken!”

Around them, cries, screams, and moans of pain turned the subway car into utter chaos.

Some trembling passengers pulled out their phones, using the flashlight function to illuminate the carriage. When the light shone down, more terrified gasps echoed.

The scene was bloody—is this a horror movie?

Everywhere was blood. The walls of the train, stained with red from the impact, made the compartment feel like hell. A few windows had shattered, and passengers by the windows were pierced by shards of glass, helplessly slumped against the wall, unable to move. Some had even been impaled by large pieces of glass, lying on the ground, their fate uncertain.

Many had head wounds, desperately pressing their hands against their injuries. Lacking knowledge of self-rescue in emergencies, the passengers were clearly in a state of panic.

“Ugh…” The passenger who had turned on their phone quickly shut it off, retching.

The man in the white shirt lay on the ground; aside from a sprained arm, he was mostly unscathed. The young mother, having hit her back against the seat, was in tears from the pain, but thankfully had no other injuries. The two of them looked at the daughter cradled by Scholar Song, letting out a sigh of relief.

Scholar Song surveyed the hellish scene around him, frowning deeply.

“How strange,” he thought—had the shaking of the subway really been that severe?

The windows shattered? And how could people be impaled by glass? Even more outrageous, half the walls were splattered with blood! How much blood would it take to achieve that?

A derailment or flip wouldn’t cause this level of devastation.

If a few jolts could wreak such havoc, they might as well rename the subway the ‘Hell Express’!

“Shit!” The towering foreign monk rose from the ground, brushing off debris as if he were a bear standing on its hind legs.

He surveyed the bloody scene in the subway, a cold smile creeping across his face.

Then, he spread his hands apart, clutching his prayer beads, and formed a mudra with his fingers, loudly reciting scriptures in clear, resonant Chinese.

His booming voice echoed throughout the compartment, overpowering the cries of the wounded. 

“What’s this foreigner babbling about?”

“Is he reciting some kind of exorcism scripture?”

“What a lunatic! The place is a disaster, and he’s here trying to chase away ghosts?”

The tall foreign monk ignored their curses, continuing to chant loudly from his scriptures.
