**Scholar Song, why are you bending over like that?**

As soon as the words left her mouth, Mistress Scallion leaped high into the air and executed a dramatic kneeling pose, clasping her hands together. “Oh great immortal, please spare this little demon! I was only joking with you earlier, I surrender!”

“……” Scholar Song held the Thunder Palm in his hand, his expression stiff as he stared at the little scion lying flat on the ground, completely surrendering. “Surrender?”

“A very sincere surrender!” Mistress Scallion replied earnestly.

Scholar Song’s mind momentarily froze as he recalled countless movie scenes—like the villain who, after being defeated by the hero, suddenly falls to their knees and begs for mercy. Yet, underneath, they’re secretly preparing a powerful move. Just as the hero's heart softens and they consider accepting the villain's surrender, the villain smirks and unleashes their hidden strike…

After thinking it over, Scholar Song decided it would be best to blast this female demon with a Thunder Palm first, leaving her half-dead before negotiating. After all, she was a demon with three hundred years of experience; he couldn’t afford to underestimate her.

Underestimating the enemy was suicide—he would never forget the wisdom passed down from his predecessors!

Thus, he sent another Thunder Palm toward the female demon.

Although Mistress Scallion was lying flat on the ground in surrender, her eyes remained fixed on Scholar Song, darting back and forth nervously.

When she saw the determined look on his face as he prepared to unleash another Thunder Palm, her heart sank.

He was refusing to accept her surrender—how ruthless!

“Darn it!” Mistress Scallion gritted her teeth, transforming back into her true form.

Then… with a swift motion, she dove deep into the earth, disappearing from sight.

This wasn’t some kind of demonic technique, but rather her innate ability as a scion—a demon that sprouted from the ground. In a pinch, she could revert to her original form and quickly burrow underground. This ability was akin to an earth-shifting technique, though only effective over short distances.

Moreover, in her true form, aside from her 'earth-burrowing talent', she had a strong self-preservation ability. As long as her roots remained intact, she could survive!

Even if the green shoots above were completely destroyed, she could still absorb nutrients from the soil and regrow new shoots.

Boom!

Scholar Song’s Thunder Palm struck the ground, creating a massive crater.

After the dust settled, however, there was no sign of Mistress Scallion—he had indeed underestimated this demon!

With a serious expression, Scholar Song began searching for her whereabouts.

Moments later, he spotted her—not far off, in a patch of grass, stood a vibrant green scallion, proudly upright and glaring at him!

“Nowhere to run!” Scholar Song shouted as he charged toward the large scallion.

He absolutely could not allow her to escape. She knew about his Dao Stone! A common man is innocent, but carrying a treasure makes him guilty. If the female demon spread the word about his possession of the Dao Stone, Scholar Song would find no peace for a long time.

“How could you find me so easily?” the verdant scallion exclaimed as it emerged from the ground and began fleeing.

Please, it’s because your aura hasn’t dissipated! Scholar Song thought to himself.

“Wait! Human! I really surrender! I’m not scheming! I truly surrender!” Mistress Scallion cried out as she ran.

“Put your hands up and come back with me. I can accept your surrender,” Scholar Song said sternly—at the very least, he intended to take her back for Venerable White to wipe her memory.

Upon hearing the words "come back with me," Mistress Scallion's expression changed dramatically—she was instantly reminded of her nearly three-hundred-year imprisonment at Tianlong Temple.

This human cultivator wanted to capture her and lock her away for hundreds of years too?

No way, absolutely not! She had just been imprisoned for three hundred years, and although plant-based demons typically had longer lifespans, she didn’t have a few hundred years left to live. If she were to be locked up for several hundred more years, she would truly die of old age and become a dried scallion.

She had only one option left.

Clenching her teeth, Mistress Scallion recalled that last resort—though the last time she used it on Nine Lanterns, the effect had been completely different from what her teacher described!

Moreover, during her time locked in the pagoda, she learned a lot about common sense. She knew that the so-called “two hundred essential skills for demons to survive” were all a load of nonsense.

But when push came to shove, perhaps that final move would still have some effect!

Men have a natural tendency to cherish beauty.

With this thought, Mistress Scallion gritted her teeth and unleashed her ultimate technique—the “Charming Demoness Technique of Alluring Beauty!”

Scholar Song stared at her, dumbfounded: “…”

Mistress Scallion was taken aback when she noticed that the young human cultivator seemed completely unaffected by her allure. How could this be? Look at this demon, giving her all for the “Charming Demoness Technique of Alluring Beauty!”

She put even more effort into swaying her body.

Scholar Song could only stare in disbelief: “…”

Mistress Scallion was stunned; this young human cultivator had astonishing self-control!

Finally, Scholar Song broke the silence, asking, “What are you doing?”

“You actually ask me what I'm doing? Don’t you think my posture is alluring and enticing?” Mistress Scallion retorted, puzzled.

Scholar Song sighed: “…”

After a long pause, he couldn’t help but scoff, “You look like a scallion stuck in the ground, twisting around in the wind, and you dare tell me you’re alluring and enticing? Are you kidding me?”

Mistress Scallion had just revealed her demonic form and hadn’t transformed back into her human shape yet. Now she was merely a scallion, swaying in front of Scholar Song… the image was comically absurd.

Rubbing his temples, Scholar Song finally realized—this female demon was a silly scallion!

“Oh, sorry! I was too nervous earlier and forgot to change back into my human form,” Mistress Scallion exclaimed, and with a loud pop, she transformed into her human shape, sporting green twin tails and a fitted qipao. “Shall we start again?”

Scholar Song ground his teeth, “No time for games! I’ll give you two choices. Either you come back with me willingly, or I’ll knock you out and drag you back.”

Mistress Scallion panicked, “No, no! Just give me another chance! My ‘Charming Demoness Technique of Alluring Beauty’ is really powerful! Just one more opportunity, and if it doesn’t work, I’ll go with you!”

Scholar Song sighed heavily.

Was the Earth spinning oddly this year, causing all the weirdos to cross his path?

Whether it was the ‘foolish uncle from the Immortal Farmer Sect’ or this silly scallion, they were both simply too outstanding!

Couldn’t he be assigned a normal demon to fight instead, to earn some experience?

After sighing, Scholar Song extended a finger toward Mistress Scallion. “You get one chance, just one! If it doesn’t work, you’ll come with me. Don’t even think about playing tricks, or I won’t hold back!”

As he spoke, he discreetly prepared a ‘Sword Talisman’; this was the last one he had left—if Mistress Scallion tried to escape, he would use it without hesitation!

“Watch closely! I guarantee you won’t be able to resist!” Mistress Scallion declared, flipping her long hair.

*System Notification*—Mistress Scallion once again unleashed her full power with the “Charming Demoness Technique of Alluring Beauty!”

Mistress Scallion’s charm surged, hitting a staggering +10086!

Her allure was off the charts—no one could resist! This charm was irresistible to both men and women! Come on, young man, let’s enjoy this!

Mistress Scallion’s body danced joyfully, throwing flirtatious glances at Scholar Song.

She was brimming with confidence in her charm; surely even women would be enchanted by her allure, let alone this young male cultivator!

And then… Mistress Scallion completed her dance.

“Clap, clap, clap!” Scholar Song applauded vigorously, “That was really impressive! Beautiful!”

“Is that all?” Mistress Scallion asked in disbelief.

“I even clapped for you! Aren’t you satisfied? You should know that my standards have been raised recently!” Scholar Song said, standing up straight from his bent position. “No more talking, surrender now! Or I’ll make you incapable of moving and drag you back!”

“You… you’re not a real man! You didn’t feel a thing?” Mistress Scallion shouted, pointing at Scholar Song.

“Ha ha ha.” Scholar Song continued standing straight, clenching his fist with a cold smile. “I can’t pretend I didn’t hear what you just said! Looks like I’ll have to beat you to the brink of death before you’ll cooperate.”

“I’m sorry… can I take back what I just said? I’ll go with you! I’ll willingly go with you, please?” Mistress Scallion pleaded, on the verge of tears. Why couldn’t they just talk things out without resorting to violence?

Scholar Song nodded in satisfaction.

At that moment, Zhao Yaya’s sports car came into view, approaching from a distance!

Zhao Yaya’s timing was perfect; had she arrived a moment sooner, she would have witnessed the explosive scene. If she had been any later, Scholar Song would have already dragged Mistress Scallion away.

……

“Transform into your scallion form, and I’ll take you back,” Scholar Song instructed, pulling out the Sword Talisman. “Don’t think about escaping; if you do, you’re done for.”

Under Scholar Song’s threat, Mistress Scallion obediently transformed back into her scallion state.

At the same time, she made one last request, “Oh great immortal, how long do you plan to seal me? Can you shorten the time? I just got out after being trapped for three hundred years.”

Scholar Song’s heart softened at the thought of her just being imprisoned for three hundred years. That was truly harsh.

Not receiving an answer from Scholar Song, Mistress Scallion grew anxious. “How about this? I can give you a cultivation technique in exchange for a little less time…”

She had stolen a scroll of techniques from Nine Lanterns three hundred years ago, and Nine Lanterns had never asked for it back.

“Don’t worry; I won’t keep you for too long. Just come with me to meet a senior… if things go quickly, you’ll be released in a few days,” Scholar Song replied.

“Really?” Mistress Scallion’s eyes lit up.

Scholar Song sighed, “Really, I have no reason to lie to you.”

“Good, good!” Mistress Scallion felt a wave of relief wash over her.

Then, Scholar Song scooped up her scallion form and leaped lightly to the side of the mountain path, waiting for Zhao Yaya’s car.

As Zhao Yaya’s sports car pulled up, she executed a perfect U-turn.

“Get in the car! Auntie is furious at home right now, and Uncle can barely hold on. She secretly messaged me to hurry and bring you back!” Zhao Yaya cheerfully called out.

When she had taken Scholar Song’s dad and the others back earlier, Scholar Song’s mother had looked puzzled.

But when she learned that Scholar Song’s dad had flipped the car, she exploded with rage. Now, Scholar Song’s dad, Old Lu, and Lu Tianyou were all sitting in a row, being fiercely reprimanded by Scholar Song’s mother.

At that moment, all Scholar Song’s dad wanted was for Zhao Yaya to hurry and bring Scholar Song home to diffuse his wife’s fury.

“Haha!” Scholar Song laughed heartily as he maintained his bent posture, climbing into the sports car.

“Why are you still bent over?” Zhao Yaya asked, puzzled.
