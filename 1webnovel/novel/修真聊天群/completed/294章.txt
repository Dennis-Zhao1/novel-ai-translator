**Chapter 1: The Call of the Beasts**

"Monstrous beasts, begone!"

A heavy male voice suddenly broke through the chaos, laced with a hint of amusement. “You’ve misjudged this situation; this is no ordinary Fire Blade.”

“Even ordinary Fire Blades are already cheating. If this isn’t an ordinary Fire Blade, doesn’t that mean we’re really stacking the odds?” 

“Ha ha ha, you make a valid point.” The deep voice chuckled in response.

“Never mind, the irritating eagles are mostly dealt with. I’m ready to open the city gates.”

“Wait!” the heavy voice interrupted urgently. “Those three eagles are just the first batch. There’s a whole flock more on the way.”

“... Wasn’t it usually only a few? Why are so many coming today? If they annoy me, I’ll take them all down!”

The heavy voice quickly panicked. “No, please! Those are precious experimental subjects. Losing two or three is one thing, but if you wipe them all out, it’d be such a waste. Just drive the rest away!”

“Fine, we’ll just chase them off.”

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At this moment, Scholar Song reignited the flames on his Blade of Shattering. This was a simplified version of the Fire Blade—Flame Flicker!

With a swift motion, he slashed through the air, sending a flicker of flame directly at the beak of the eagle.

Compared to his first strike, Scholar Song was now more adept with his technique.

The flame landed on the eagle’s beak, bursting forth into dozens of small, candle-sized flames, which shot toward the eagle’s head.

The eagle had no defenses, and its head was instantly riddled with holes.

“Ha... ha...” Scholar Song panted heavily, feeling the energy within him drain yet again. However, the vitality from the Blood Essence Pill he had swallowed quickly replenished his energy, restoring his drained vitality.

The giant eagle fell from the sky, crashing down...

“Ahhhhh!” The flight attendants and office ladies beneath it screamed in terror as they were still hovering about twenty meters high.

Scholar Song sighed.

He then leapt into action, pulling the ropes tied to Miss Gao and Uncle Black, propelling himself toward the city wall.

“Aahhh!” This time, it was Uncle Black and Miss Gao who let out cries of fright.

As they were yanked along, they eventually landed on the second tier of the city wall.

They stumbled upon landing but were unharmed.

“Stay put here,” Scholar Song instructed them. With another powerful leap, he launched himself toward the falling eagle.

This particular eagle, perhaps because its head had been blasted apart, still clutched tightly with its talons, holding the flight attendant and the office lady firmly in its grasp.

To rescue them, he would first need to cut through the eagle's claws and then bring them out—time was running out.

“Then, let’s fully utilize this giant eagle's massive body,” he thought, formulating a plan.

Scholar Song dashed beneath the eagle and shouted, “Basic Fist Technique One!”

With the boost from "Wind Acceleration," he unleashed a powerful punch against the side of the eagle, flipping it over.

The massive eagle turned in mid-air, landing on its back with its feet pointed skyward, continuing its descent.

Now, it was about ten meters from the ground.

With the giant eagle's body acting as a cushion, no one should die from this fall.

Unfortunately, "Wind Acceleration" could only be used twice. Otherwise, if he could attach it to the eagle's corpse, its descent would be slower, providing more safety for the two women caught in its claws.

But there was no time for more.

He quickly flipped onto the eagle's back, using it to propel himself back toward the first tier of the city wall.

He still needed to get Miss Gao and Uncle Black down.

“Scholar! Hurry!” Miss Gao suddenly shouted in urgency from the top of the wall.

He looked up to see a swarm of black dots flying toward them from the sky.

There were at least a dozen of them.

Scholar Song's scalp tingled with fear.

He quickly tossed the rope upward for Miss Gao and Uncle Black to catch.

Then, he climbed up the rope to join Miss Gao.

…

…

At that moment, the two giant eagle corpses crashed to the ground with a thunderous impact.

“We’re going down!” Scholar Song said, grasping Miss Gao with one hand and Uncle Black with the other.

“How do we get down?” Miss Gao asked, curious.

They were at a height of more than twenty meters—he wasn’t suggesting they jump down, was he?

“Run down!” Scholar Song exclaimed, tightening his hold on Miss Gao and Uncle Black. With a powerful push, he activated "Wind Acceleration" and began to sprint down the wall…

“Ahhhhh!” Miss Gao screamed, not out of cowardice but pure instinct. Just like tears flowed from a punch to the nose, anyone would scream when being pulled headfirst from a height of over twenty meters.

This experience was more thrilling than bungee jumping—at least bungee jumping had a rope.

Uncle Black next to them didn’t scream this time; he simply shut his eyes tightly, gripping Scholar Song’s arm with all his strength.

…

…

A few moments later.

Scholar Song landed safely with the two of them.

“Get into the city cave and hide!” he instructed, heading toward the giant eagle's corpse.

The flight attendant and office lady were still alive, struggling to crawl out from the eagle's claws. The flight attendant bore several scratches from the eagle's talons.

The office lady was worse off; the eagle's claws had tightened just before its death, nearly crushing her waist. If she had been a bit heavier, her insides would likely have burst out by now.

Scholar Song jumped onto the eagle's corpse, grabbing the office lady and the flight attendant, and helped them down.

“Let’s go,” he urged.

More than ten giant eagles were still flying in the sky... Just thinking about that many made Scholar Song's scalp prickle.

If he struggled so much to kill two, how would he possibly protect so many passengers from a dozen at once?

And… Zhuge Yue and Zhuge Zhongyang were still out there...

…

…

Inside the city cave, Mei Yi cried in Miss Gao’s arms, pounding her small fists against her chest. Miss Gao looked blissfully happy, whispering sweet words to comfort his girlfriend.

Uncle Black, hiding among the crowd, trembled uncontrollably. He was the most unfortunate of the bunch, having been captured by gorillas at first, and then caught by the giant eagle. Today was definitely not his lucky day.

The office lady and flight attendant entered the cave, their faces reflecting the relief of having survived.

“Stay still and don’t move; there are more giant eagles coming!” Scholar Song warned as he approached the entrance of the cave.

The passengers' faces went pale, and they quickly huddled behind Scholar Song.

Scholar Song gripped his Blade of Shattering tightly, his gaze fixed on the approaching giant eagles in the sky.

Wait a minute, did I forget something? Scholar Song pondered, standing at the cave entrance, feeling like something was missing.

Suddenly it hit him—Joseph!

Joseph hadn’t returned yet; he was still on his way back to the cave!

Please don’t let anything happen to him!

“By the way, are we not like chicks being hunted by eagles? The giant eagles up there are like our predators, and I’m the mother hen, Scholar Song?” Miss Lu Fei suddenly piped up, blinking innocently.

Scholar Song turned back stiffly and forced a smile at Lu Fei.

This girl had quite the optimistic spirit, making jokes even at a time like this.

“Ahem, I shouldn’t be the mother hen; I should be the father hen,” Scholar Song sighed. “After all, I’m a guy.”

“Hee hee,” Lu Fei giggled.

The passengers looked at Scholar Song’s back. Though he wasn't particularly big, in their eyes, he seemed incredibly tall and strong, giving them an inexplicable sense of security—especially with the two giant eagle corpses nearby, which only amplified Scholar Song's imposing presence!

The giant eagles in the sky were drawing nearer.

However, when they reached a certain height, they didn’t dive down as they had before. The giant eagles, despite their low intelligence, recognized the danger of the three fallen corpses below and circled above cautiously.

…

…

Scholar Song tightened his grip on the Blade of Shattering, popping another Blood Essence Pill into his mouth to replenish his energy.

Just then, a strange sound came from above the city wall.

It sounded like some sort of switch being flipped, followed by the noise of something being lifted. It wasn’t loud, but only Scholar Song, with his keen senses, could hear it.

“Is the ancient city’s defense system activating?” Scholar Song thought to himself.

“Buzz… buzz…”

Suddenly, a piercing buzzing sound echoed from the ancient city wall, reminiscent of a speaker being turned on—sharp and grating!

The passengers behind Scholar Song quickly covered their ears.

“Monstrous beasts, begone!” a thunderous voice boomed from the speaker, powerful and commanding.

However, beyond its volume, the sound held no particular force.

Scholar Song was puzzled, but the giant eagles in the sky suddenly reacted as if they had heard something terrifying. They flapped their wings with all their might and took off in a panic.

In the blink of an eye, the dozen or so giant eagles were reduced to mere black dots in the sky, vanishing from sight.

“…” Scholar Song was dumbfounded by this dramatic turn of events.

Was it the master of the ancient city, using the speaker to drive away the giant eagles?

It seemed that the ancient city’s owner had noticed their presence.

Scholar Song pondered briefly, sheathing his Blade of Shattering and turning toward the ancient city, cupping his hands in gratitude. “Thank you for your assistance, esteemed elder. I, Scholar Song, am eternally grateful!”

“Buzz buzz…”

The speaker emitted that irritating noise again.

Then...

“Monstrous beasts, begone!” The massive voice echoed once more, still powerful and commanding.

Scholar Song: “…”

Wait, could it be that the ancient city's master was referring to them as ‘monstrous beasts’ and telling them to scram?

Just as Scholar Song was deep in thought, the speaker crackled again a moment later.

“Buzz buzz…” 

“Monstrous beasts, begone!” The same booming voice proclaimed.

Really now? It was just a recording on a loop!
