**Put down the disciple of the Su Clan!**

**4 PM.**

After finishing the theoretical learning course at the Vehicle Administration Office, Scholar Song and his friend Tu Bo signed up for the "Driver's License Subject One Exam."

For both of them, the theoretical exam posed no challenge at all.

In less than five minutes, they both completed the exam with perfect scores.

Then, they received their theoretical exam score sheets from the examiner and left the examination hall.

“Scholar, I’ve already found a driving school instructor. When the time comes, we’ll pay the driving fees and just wait for him to notify us when we can practice driving. We’ll be ready to take the Subject Two exam in no more than half a month,” Tu Bo said with a grin. The instructor he found was known for being time-efficient, scheduling the Subject Two exam as quickly as possible.

“Great, just let me know when you go to pay,” Scholar Song replied. “By the way, Tu Bo, I have things to do tonight, so don’t wait for me for dinner.”

“Got it, no problem,” Tu Bo said.

The two waved goodbye as they exited the Vehicle Administration Office.

…

…

As Scholar Song left the office, Sable Sixteen, who had been waiting outside, approached him.

“Where are we going next? What’s the lead you mentioned?” she asked curiously.

Scholar Song patted the black iron flying sword at his waist. “The lead is this flying sword belonging to Master Tong Xuan.”

Due to the concealment array, Sable Sixteen couldn’t see the flying sword, but she remembered that Scholar Song used it to decapitate the assassin.

This flying sword is the clue?

Wait a minute! — This flying sword was originally brought by that assassin?

“The flying sword was left behind by Master Tong Xuan after he sent a message through it. Later, the Alchemical Sage asked me to mail it back to Master Tong Xuan,” Scholar Song explained. “But yesterday, the courier, Xiao Jiang, called to tell me he was knocked out and robbed, and the package was taken.”

What a coincidence…

No one expected that the ‘assassin’ would bring the black iron flying sword to kill Sable Sixteen. In the end, Scholar Song used the sword to turn the tables.

Sable Sixteen asked, “Was the flying sword taken by the assassin?”

Scholar Song shook his head. “No, the person who robbed the courier wasn’t the assassin. Xiao Jiang mentioned on the phone that the robber has already been caught and is currently in custody. I suspect the robber and the assassin might be in cahoots.”

“So, we’re going to meet the robber? Maybe we can get the information we need from him. Once we figure out who he is, everything will fall into place.”

Scholar Song suspected that the incident with the Xian Nong Sect was also related to the forces behind the assassin. Clearly, they aimed to create a conflict between the Xian Nong Sect and Sable Sixteen from the Su Clan to benefit from it.

“Should we go find Xiao Jiang?” Sable Sixteen’s eyes sparkled with excitement.

“I’ll call Xiao Jiang first to see where he is,” Scholar Song said as he pulled out his phone and dialed Si Ma Jiang’s number.

It didn’t take long before Si Ma Jiang picked up the call.

Before Scholar Song could say anything, Si Ma Jiang quickly interjected, “Scholar, are you calling about the courier’s status? Don’t worry, we’ve already extracted the appearance and location of his accomplices from the robber. I’ll definitely retrieve the package tonight!”

Scholar Song glanced at the flying sword at his waist and chuckled, “Haha, there’s no need to look for that package anymore. Due to a series of coincidences, the contents of the package have already come back into my possession. I’ll explain the details later. Right now, I need you, Xiao Jiang, to do me a favor and arrange for me to meet the robber to ask him a few questions.”

Si Ma Jiang paused for a moment, but then replied, “No problem! I’m currently at the headquarters of Jiangnan Harvest Express. Where are you? I can drive over to pick you up right away!”

“Okay, let’s meet outside the east gate of Jiangnan University Town. We’ll wait for you there,” Scholar Song responded.

“I’ll be there soon,” Si Ma Jiang replied.

…

…

After hanging up, Scholar Song said, “Let’s go wait at the east gate for Xiao Jiang.”

“Okay,” Sable Sixteen nodded.

The two walked along the artificial lake on campus toward the east gate.

“Sable Sixteen, why hasn’t Senior A Qi arrived yet?” Scholar Song asked.

He recalled that she had said she would be here in ten minutes, yet it had already been several hours.

“Who knows?” Sable Sixteen replied.

“I’ll ask in the group chat.” Scholar Song opened the Ninefold Land One chat group and sent a message.

**Scholar Shushan:** “Senior A Qi, aren’t you here yet?”

**Hermit of North River:** “I haven’t received any replies from A Qi either. Let’s keep in touch. I’ll inform you the moment I hear from him.”

“Okay, stay in touch. We’re heading to Jiangnan Harvest Express headquarters soon. If Senior A Qi gets back to us, let him know to meet us there,” Scholar Song replied.

**Hermit of North River:** “Sure, take care.”

Sable Sixteen sighed and said, “Forget it, let me ask. Can I borrow your phone, Scholar? I’ll call A Qi and see where he is.”

“That sounds perfect,” Scholar Song said, turning to hand her his phone.

Sable Sixteen looked down and began dialing the number.

After a moment, she frowned. “A Qi’s phone is dead? It’s turned off.”

“Then we’ll just have to wait for him to contact us… Oh, what’s that?” Scholar Song suddenly pointed into the distance, puzzled.

Following his finger, they spotted a ball of black smoke swirling rapidly in the sky, while a five-meter-long Pekingese dog chased after it, its tongue lolling out.

The ball of smoke and the dog were engaged in a game of chase in mid-air.

However, none of the students below seemed to notice the strange spectacle, as if it were invisible to them.

“Is that a demon beast?” Sable Sixteen asked.

Demon beasts have a special constitution, making them undetectable to ordinary humans.

As they spoke, the black smoke ball suddenly changed direction and charged toward Scholar Song and Sable Sixteen.

Scholar Song placed one hand on the flying sword and the other reached into his pocket for a talisman, ready to unleash it at any moment.

As the black smoke ball drew closer, it suddenly burst open, enveloping Scholar Song and Sable Sixteen within it.

A chilling voice echoed from the smoke, “Kekeke, little disciple of the Su Clan, I’ve found you!”

“Who are you?” Scholar Song shouted.

Before he could finish, he suddenly felt a gigantic hand grab him, lifting him off the ground as if he were flying!

Meanwhile, Sable Sixteen was swept away by an invisible force.

“Kekeke. You can call me Lord An Zhi!” The voice from the black smoke ball chuckled ominously. “Little disciple of the Su Clan, how about you come with me? Don’t worry, I have no intention of taking your life.”

“Are you an accomplice of the assassin?” Scholar Song inquired.

Also, I’m not a disciple of the Su Clan.

Did Lord An Zhi grab the wrong person?

The demon lord didn’t respond to Scholar Song because the enormous Pekingese behind them let out a furious bark, quickly closing in to bite at the smoke.

“That damn dog!” Lord An Zhi tightened his grip on Scholar Song and accelerated into the sky.

“Woof woof!” The massive Pekingese dog was relentless in its pursuit.

Just as Lord An Zhi was soaring into the air with the ‘little disciple of the Su Clan,’ a figure suddenly burst forth from a corner of the campus, chasing after the black smoke ball. “Put down the little disciple of the Su Clan, you bastard! She’s our target!”

It was the goofy uncle from the Xian Nong Sect, his hands still wrapped in bandages.

The chase among the demon lord, the dog, and the goofy uncle quickly vanished from sight.

Meanwhile, Sable Sixteen, the actual target of this entire incident, was groaning in pain as she clutched her abdomen, struggling to get back on her feet. — Speaking of which, she was indeed the disciple of the Su Clan, right?

What kind of show were these guys putting on by taking Scholar Song away?
