**Pill of Solitude**

Scholar Song and the Alchemical Sage wandered through the bustling Daji District, checking out around ten rental apartments, but none seemed to catch the Sage's discerning eye. Scholar Song was at a loss, unsure of what exactly the Sage was looking for.

*If this doesn’t work, we can always check out other neighborhoods,* he thought to himself.

Just then, the Sage's gaze landed on a house that sparked his interest.

It was a brand-new building, a three-bedroom, five-story residence, complete with a surrounding wall and front and back yards. The decor was exquisite, clearly reflecting the owner's effort and care in crafting the space.

*What a great place!*

However, it was evident that this house was not intended for rent!

“This is the one! Let’s rent it!” The Alchemical Sage laughed heartily.

“Wait, senior! This place isn’t for rent; it’s someone’s personal home!” Scholar Song exclaimed.

But the Sage paid no heed to his words, chuckling as he dragged Scholar Song to the front of the house and pressed the doorbell.

“Coming!” A deep voice echoed from inside.

Moments later, the door swung open to reveal a middle-aged man with a buzz cut, slightly overweight, peering out at them. After scrutinizing the Sage's wild hair for a moment, he curiously asked, “Delivery?”

“No, we’re looking to rent a place,” the Sage replied, diving straight to the point.

The middle-aged man froze for a moment, his lips twitching. Nevertheless, he politely responded, “Sorry, but my house is for family use. We don’t really like living with strangers, so we have no plans to rent it out.”

“Not liking to live with strangers? That’s perfect!” The Sage beamed. “I feel the same way—I really don’t want to live under the same roof as strangers. So how about you move out and rent the whole building to me instead? Just name your price, and I won’t haggle!”

Scholar Song felt a strong urge to facepalm—asking the owner to move out so he could rent the place? Wouldn’t that leave the owner homeless? There was no way such a ridiculous request would lead to a successful rental!

As expected, the middle-aged man’s forehead twitched with anger, his expression turning dark. “I’m sorry, but I’m not in need of that little bit of money, so the house is not for rent. Please look elsewhere. Goodbye.”

The fact that the man could keep his cool at that moment showed he was a refined gentleman. If it had been Scholar Song, he knew he wouldn’t have been able to hold back—at the very least, he’d have to curse out loud!

“Hey, think about it! Money isn’t an issue!” The Sage still didn’t want to give up.

Scholar Song could already envision the furious scene of the owner kicking them out, so he quickly grabbed the Sage, attempting to drag him away.

……

To their immense surprise, the Sage and Scholar Song ended up moving into that same three-bedroom, five-story house.

“Oh my, this independent house is just perfect! The size is just right, and after knocking down a wall, one floor can become a wonderful alchemy room!” The Sage walked through the house, nodding in satisfaction as he explored room after room.

“But we only needed to rent a single room,” Scholar Song pointed out, a bit exasperated.

In the mundane world, everything had its price. Sometimes, you couldn’t buy something not because it was not for sale, but simply because your offer was too low.

The three-bedroom, five-story house before them was just like that.

Even though the owner had painstakingly crafted it for his family, after the Sage dropped an irresistible sum of money… the middle-aged man, who moments ago seemed ready to explode, suddenly transformed from a stormy expression to sunshine.

Then, with a cheerful demeanor, the man handed over the house and land usage certificates along with all the keys, setting a time for the paperwork to transfer ownership.

Before long, the man and his family moved out of the house within two hours. What efficiency!

Yes, the Sage had outright bought the place.

He casually purchased the entire building.

*What a splurge!*

“Don’t mind the details; the most important thing is we finally have the perfect alchemy room, and we can start refining the Body Strengthening Liquid!” The Sage laughed heartily, pulling out a porcelain bottle from his robe and tossing a pill to Scholar Song.

Scholar Song caught it, his face puzzled.

“This is the Pill of Solitude, a staple for cultivators that can be eaten like food. When your cultivation deepens in the future, you might find yourself in closed-door training for months, or maybe even years or decades. And cultivators still need to eat, which is where this pill comes in handy. Just hold it in your mouth, and its effects will continuously dissolve. This one is the lowest quality, but for you, it’s enough to replace a month’s worth of meals,” the Sage explained with a smile.

“Thank you, senior.” Scholar Song felt warmth in his heart; the Sage had remembered he hadn’t eaten lunch. The Sage, who seemed to be a bit scatterbrained, turned out to be surprisingly thoughtful.

“Don’t mention it! Just hold it in your mouth for a while, and once you feel full, we can go ahead and refine the Body Strengthening Liquid,” the Sage added.

Scholar Song held the Pill of Solitude in his mouth, and immediately, he was met with a delightful flavor. The gnawing hunger in his stomach vanished, and moments later, he even felt a slight urge to burp.

“Take it out when you feel full, don’t overdo it. Also, you can reuse the Pill of Solitude until it’s completely dissolved. Keep it safe; you might need it later,” the Sage added, reassuring him. The Sage’s creations had a shelf life measured in centuries, so there was no worry about spoilage.

Hearing this, Scholar Song carefully took the Pill of Solitude out of his mouth and stored it away. Thankfully, he hadn’t swallowed it—he had just been wondering if this pill could help him avoid eating and drinking for an entire month like in the shows.

Now, it seemed that swallowing it would have been a recipe for disaster.

……

Electric stovetop? Check.

Hot pot pot? OK.

Forty-five types of simplified Body Strengthening Liquid ingredients were already prepped beside Scholar Song.

“Just repeat the process from your first attempt. Let’s get started,” the Sage instructed. “Don’t feel pressured or worry about failure; I have plenty of materials for the Body Strengthening Liquid.”

Scholar Song smiled shyly, closing his eyes to recall the steps from his first attempt at refining the liquid. Since it had only been yesterday, and it was his first time, he remembered each step clearly.

“First, add water.” He poured a ladle of water into the pot.

Next, he added sliced ginseng, letting it simmer for five minutes.

Then came the goji berries, simmering for another five minutes.

When it was time for the third ingredient, *Morning Dew Mysterious Herb*, Scholar Song no longer hesitated with timing. He began to observe the subtle changes in the ingredients within the pot, and after a moment, he increased the heat on the electric stove.

The Sage stroked his chin, watching Scholar Song closely, remaining silent and not interrupting.

“Even with prior preparation, I still can’t connect Scholar Song’s actions with ‘refining pills,’” the Sage mused internally.

Fortunately, he was a forward-thinking alchemist.

If a more traditional alchemist were to discover that Scholar Song was using a hot pot and electric stove to refine pills, they would likely be infuriated!

“Also… modernizing the alchemist’s furnace should be added to the plan. At least when refining pills that don’t require ‘pill fire’ or special flames, modern equipment makes controlling the heat and temperature much easier,” the Sage thought to himself.

Scholar Song, at that moment, was in a state of heightened concentration with the help of the ice bead. In his eyes, nothing existed outside of the Body Strengthening Liquid he was refining.

The Sage’s expression displayed admiration.

Though he was a bit older, Scholar Song might just have a talent for alchemy!
