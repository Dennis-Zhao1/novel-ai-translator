“Surprise, Senior Song! Ah, yay?” 

Scholar Song couldn't help but think that this girl was really something, throwing around money like it was nothing. But with such a grand gesture, he wondered if he’d ever be able to repay her kindness in the future.

Honestly, stepping into the world of cultivation and immediately meeting characters like Fay Yu, Sable Sixteen, Venerable White… oh, and even Dou Dou, was incredibly lucky. 

“Wait a moment, Xiao Jiang,” Scholar Song said to Sima Jiang over the phone. “I’m outside. I’ll have my mom come down to open the door for you.”

“No problem,” Sima Jiang replied with a laugh.

After hanging up, Scholar Song called his mom again. “Mom, there’s a delivery downstairs. Can you go open the door and sign for it?”

“Delivery? Okay, got it.” Then, Scholar Song’s mom shouted, “Old Song, there’s a delivery for Scholar! Can you go check downstairs?”

“Got it,” Father Song replied boisterously.

Looks like Father Song and Zhao Yaya are back from the hospital, he thought.

At that moment, Scholar Song’s mom asked casually, “What kind of delivery is it? It came really early?”

“It should be tea from a friend. By the way, is Yaya still at our place?” Scholar Song replied.

“She’s still here. I asked her to stay for dinner. She’s been resting these past few days,” his mom answered.

“Okay, once the delivery comes, could you open it for me? If it’s a whole box of tea, just take out a can for Yaya. Tell her it’s the same kind she had yesterday.” Scholar Song had meant to send an extra can of tea to Zhao Yaya the day before, but he’d fallen asleep before he could do it.

“Sure, I’ll take care of it,” his mom replied. “And make sure to come home for dinner soon. Don’t play for too long.”

“Got it, I’ll be back quickly,” Scholar Song assured her.

After ending the call, he swallowed a Qi Blood Pill and resumed his cultivation. Since he was out, he might as well complete today’s training schedule.

…

Meanwhile, Father Song came downstairs and saw the burly Sima Jiang standing at the door, flanked by four tall men in black, who were carefully carrying a wooden box.

“Is this the delivery for Scholar?” Father Song asked, puzzled. He spoke with the local dialect of Wenzhou. “Which delivery service operates like this? And why do you have four guys in black bringing it?”

“Ha ha, you must be Scholar Song’s father! You two look so much alike!” Sima Jiang laughed heartily, also using a perfect Wenzhou accent. He stepped forward and handed a business card to Father Song. “I’m Sima Jiang from Fengshou Express. This box is a bit large; would you like us to carry it upstairs for you?”

As a qualified express delivery elite, Sima Jiang had mastered various languages and dialects across the country, eliminating any potential communication issues with customers.

“Thank you so much!” Father Song said, taking the business card and nodding appreciatively.

The box was about six cubic meters; he couldn’t manage it alone. Besides, Father Song and Scholar Song only shared a slight resemblance, but Sima Jiang’s flattery hit him right in the feels.

“Is the service of Fengshou Express always this good?” Father Song asked casually.

“Of course! It’s always excellent! If you ever have a delivery, just call me, and we’ll be there!” Sima Jiang shamelessly promoted his company while handing over a signature sheet. “Could you please sign here, Mr. Song?”

Father Song smiled and nodded before signing his name.

He couldn’t help but wonder—was Scholar Song a big customer of this delivery service? The service was exceptional.

Father Song, not new to the world, had been around long enough to get a sense of things with just a glance. He couldn’t help but wonder if the items in the box were something precious.

The four men in black carefully carried the wooden box into Scholar Song’s home and placed it in the living room.

Afterward, Sima Jiang bid farewell to Scholar Song’s family. “Alright, Mr. Song, we won’t disturb you any longer.”

After saying their goodbyes, he left with the four men, their eyes straight ahead as they walked away from Scholar Song’s house.

…

“Was that the delivery?” Scholar Song’s mom emerged from the kitchen, puzzled. They definitely didn’t look like delivery personnel, especially those four men in black who looked like bodyguards from a movie.

“What is that kid up to at school this year?” Father Song muttered, recalling the tractor that could reach 150 mph.

Considering that Scholar Song was studying mechanical design and manufacturing, could it be that he was already designing and creating large machinery?

Looking at the big box in front of him, Father Song asked curiously, “By the way, what’s in this delivery?”

“Scholar said it might be tea… but does tea need to be packed in such a large box?” Scholar Song’s mom’s mouth twitched.

How much tea could fit in such a big box? Would they drink it all? Was this enough tea for a lifetime?

Just as they pondered, a noise suddenly came from inside the box.

“Is there a sound?” Father Song said, on guard.

Creak, crack, the noise grew louder, indeed something was moving inside.

Then, they saw the lid of the wooden box slowly being pushed up.

The sound sent a chill down their spines.

Scholar Song’s mom exchanged a glance with Father Song. He grabbed a broom nearby, flexing his arm, muscles subtly bulging.

Bang!

At that moment, the lid of the wooden box was suddenly launched off.

“Hahaha! Ding ding dang! Senior Song, I’m making my grand entrance! Surprise!” A tall girl sprang from the box, her arms raised high, a mischievous grin plastered across her face.

She had long, black hair cascading down her back like a waterfall, dressed in a simple white T-shirt and cropped pants, exuding youthful exuberance. But the most eye-catching feature was her incredibly long legs—almost impossible to miss!

Scholar Song’s mom’s mouth dropped open in an ‘O’ shape, unable to close for a long time.

Father Song, still holding the broom, stood there, utterly embarrassed.

“Ah?” The long-legged girl glanced around, noticing the astonished looks on Scholar Song’s mom and Father Song. Then she turned, scanning but not seeing Scholar Song.

“Um, is Senior Song not here?” The proud smile on her face shifted to an awkward chuckle.

“Senior Song?” Scholar Song’s mom asked, puzzled.

Seeing the confusion on her face, the girl blinked. “Oh no, did I deliver to the wrong place?”

Then, in front of the wide-eyed Father and Mother Song, she climbed back into the wooden box, picking up the lid she had just knocked off.

After that, she crawled back inside the box and crouched down.

It was quite a challenge for a tall girl to fit into such a small box.

Before closing the lid again, she awkwardly said to Father and Mother Song, “Sorry, Uncle and Auntie. It seems the delivery went to the wrong place, ah ha ha. I’ll call and check the situation, don’t worry!”

Then they heard her pull out her phone and dial.

The call connected quickly.

“Hello… is this Senior Song?” the girl asked anxiously.

“Haha, Fay Yu, are you about to tell me about the delivery of the Lingmai Bichai tea? The delivery just arrived at my house,” Scholar Song chuckled.

“It arrived at your house?” Fay Yu paused. “But I don’t see you!”

“You don’t see me?” Scholar Song was also taken aback.

He rubbed his forehead, recalling the last large delivery he had received—from Sable Sixteen, which included a box of Lingmai Bichai tea, a bottle of fasting pills, and a cute Sable Sixteen plushie…

“Fay Yu, did you ship yourself?” Scholar Song asked cautiously.

Fay Yu laughed. “Ah, you guessed it! Haha!”

“Wait a moment, I’ll be home soon… I was just outside cultivating. My dad and mom are the ones who received the delivery.” Scholar Song sighed.

“Ah? Oh! No wonder I couldn’t see you,” Fay Yu nodded. “Should I wait in the box for you to come back?”

“... No need; just come out. I’ll call my parents and explain,” Scholar Song said, extinguishing the flames from his ‘Fire Control Technique.’

Then, he activated the ‘Gentleman’s Journey’ movement technique and rushed home at full speed.

He had a feeling—once Scholar Song’s mom met Fay Yu, there would be some serious chemistry happening!

…

Meanwhile, as Father Song and Mother Song watched, Fay Yu pushed open the lid of the delivery box again.

She stood up, a little embarrassed, and waved to Father and Mother Song. “Hi, Uncle and Auntie, I’m Fay Yu, a friend of Senior Song!”

Scholar Song’s mom had already guessed this possibility when Fay Yu was making the call from inside the box.

She had remained quiet, feeling too excited to speak.

She had thought that her son would come home with a guy during the break, leaving her utterly disappointed, but unexpectedly, he had quietly shipped a beautiful girl home!

“Sweetheart, come on out! Don’t stay in the box!” Scholar Song’s mom urged, exchanging a glance with Father Song, signaling him to put the broom down quickly.

She hurried over and helped Fay Yu out of the box.

“Haha,” Fay Yu chuckled awkwardly, then turned back to retrieve a small gift box from the wooden box and handed it over. “A little something for you, Uncle and Auntie!”

“Just your presence is enough; you don’t need to be so polite! Treat this place like your home; don’t hold back!” Scholar Song’s mom beamed, her face radiant with joy.

At that moment, Zhao Yaya, who had been resting in the living room, walked out.

She spotted Fay Yu immediately, noticing those long legs.

“That must be her, the tall girl!” Zhao Yaya recalled, remembering the whispers from Scholar Song’s classmates during the sports meet about a stunning girl he had been seen with.

It seemed that this was indeed the girl they had been talking about!
