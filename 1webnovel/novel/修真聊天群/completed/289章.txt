**Chapter [Insert Chapter Number Here]**

“Hello, my life's blemish!”

Scholar Song and his companions successfully located the wrecked airplane and its passengers. 

Fortunately, they hadn’t encountered any terrifying beasts on their journey. 

But when Scholar Song finally reached the passengers, he was struck dumb. 

Before him was a bizarre scene: over fifty gorillas had surrounded around twenty passengers, who were lined up in four neat rows. 

At the front, a massive gorilla was leading a calisthenics routine to the tune of “The Era Calls,” directing the group with surprising enthusiasm. 

Below, the passengers wore complex expressions as they awkwardly mimicked the gorilla’s movements! 

What on earth was happening? Scholar Song nearly wanted to poke his eyes out. Even if gorillas had evolved, could they really be this human-like?

Behind the throng of gorillas, a black uncle, a slightly plump middle-aged man, an elderly professor, a flight attendant, and Scholar Song's nominal disciple, Joseph, were all tied up like dumplings and tossed on the ground.

“What’s going on here?” Gao, standing at a distance, squinted his eyes. His nearsightedness made it hard to see the scene clearly, but he could still imagine the chaos unfolding!

“Are the gorillas teaching the passengers calisthenics?” Tuba whispered as he pulled out his phone, trying to record the unusual spectacle. Unfortunately, it was too far away, and all he captured were blurry black dots.

“Is this a movie or something?” Mei muttered, still trying to wrap her head around the absurdity of gorillas instructing humans.

As they were talking, suddenly, one small boy lagged behind the others in their synchronized exercise routine, missing a few beats. 

At that moment, one of the surrounding gorillas lunged at him with the fierceness of a predator, swiftly grabbing the boy. The gorilla expertly tied him up and dragged him to join the group with the others: the black uncle, the professor, the flight attendant, and Joseph.

“Is there even a punishment involved?” Tuba felt his worldview shattering completely.

Gao couldn’t help but chuckle: “Is this an ape uprising or something?”

The scene before them was more surreal than any sci-fi movie!

Scholar Song’s mouth twitched, and he said softly, “You all stay here and don’t move; I’ll go take a look.”

“You’re going alone? I’ll go with you!” Tuba gritted his teeth.

“Yeah, if we’re going, we should all go together,” Gao echoed, equally determined.

“It’s fine; I just need to go check it out. If there’s danger, I’ll run back immediately. You all know I’ve been training lately, I can run fast,” Scholar Song reassured, giving a thumbs-up.

After considering it, Gao and Tuba agreed; after all, Scholar Song had won the long-distance race at school recently. If they followed him, they might just end up slowing him down.

“Just be careful. I heard gorillas can sprint really fast, so make sure to stay safe,” Gao advised cautiously.

Scholar Song nodded. “You guys hide well and don’t get spotted.”

With that, he quickly approached the gorilla group alone.

As he drew closer, Scholar Song secretly activated the “True Self Meditation Sutra,” channeling his mental energy to its peak state.

Speaking of the “True Self,” he had to mention his recent ‘True Self’ state — it had completely twisted into something unrecognizable.

In his sea of consciousness, his True Self remained seated cross-legged as before. 

Perhaps due to practicing the “Gentleman’s Journey” technique, his True Self's hair had transformed into an ancient scholar’s bun, with a serene expression that radiated a scholarly aura. 

As for his appearance above the neck, Scholar Song was quite satisfied. 

But below the neck? Suddenly, his form had morphed into a muscular physique akin to that of a bodybuilder. Each muscle was large, robust, and well-defined, with veins popping out. 

Occasionally, his True Self’s muscles would emit a flash of golden light — a result of practicing the “Immovable Diamond Body” technique. 

Moreover, his True Self's upper body was bare, while he wore only a pair of colorful shorts below.

Scholar Song was utterly despairing about his True Self’s appearance. He now had one goal: when he eventually leaped over the dragon gate and transformed his internal energy into true qi, he would definitely seek out various “Taoist sword techniques” and “Confucian martial arts” to practice. 

He absolutely had to reshape his True Self's image!

---

Before long, Scholar Song was nearing the gorilla group.

As he got closer, another five or six passengers, unable to keep up with the gorilla’s calisthenics, were tied up and tossed next to Joseph. 

Scholar Song took a deep breath, gripping his treasured sword, the “Bashua,” tightly. After all, there were over fifty gorillas; he couldn’t afford to be careless, fearing that a rampaging gorilla might accidentally harm the passengers.

When he was at an appropriate distance, Scholar Song suddenly revealed himself, gripping the Bashua tightly.

At the same time, he activated a mental technique, “Mental Pressure,” channeling all his accumulated spiritual energy into a force of suppression aimed at the fifty-plus gorillas before him! 

His fingers danced over the “Green Wind Acceleration” talisman hanging from his chest, and a layer of green spiritual energy enveloped him, boosting his speed to the limit.

Scholar Song needed the gorillas to show a moment of vulnerability, and then, bolstered by the Green Wind Acceleration, he would swiftly deal with most of them in one go.

This way, the remaining gorillas could be handled one by one later.

---

The mental pressure radiated over all the gorillas and enveloped the ordinary passengers. In an emergency, Scholar Song didn’t have time to target them individually.

Under the weight of the mental pressure, all the gorillas froze.

In the next moment, just as Scholar Song was about to unleash his “Flame Blade” to take out most of the gorillas, they suddenly screeched and scattered like birds and beasts...

They fled at lightning speed, not a single gorilla left behind.

Scholar Song was stunned. He had activated the Green Wind Acceleration, yet the gorillas had fled so decisively. It felt like hitting a cotton pile — utterly frustrating. 

Could it be that my “Mental Pressure” technique has advanced again? Scholar Song pondered in confusion.

“Dad! Dad!” At that moment, Joseph, bound like a dumpling, saw Scholar Song appear and joyfully shouted. He wriggled toward Scholar Song like a happy little worm.

Meanwhile, the passengers who had been forced to do “The Era Calls” collapsed onto the ground once more, some crying loudly, others laughing heartily, and some simply crumpled from exhaustion, each finding their own way to express their emotions.

“It’s Scholar Song!” Lu Fei and her sister also sat on the ground without any pretense, gazing at Scholar Song’s figure.

Though they didn’t understand why the gorillas had suddenly fled upon Scholar Song’s arrival, they were just relieved that the danger had passed.

---

Scholar Song looked at the “Green Wind Acceleration” spell still surrounding him and cautiously stepped forward. With the protective green wind, he felt as if he had lost gravity, effortlessly floating for a moment... his feet seemed to spring up as if the ground were made of springs.

Then, amidst the astonished gazes of the passengers, Scholar Song leaped like a grasshopper, bouncing toward Joseph.

What was Scholar Song trying to do? Most passengers couldn’t comprehend his bouncing antics.

Once he managed to reach Joseph, he wiped the sweat from his forehead and crouched down to untie him.

He then moved on to free the others one by one.

The freed black uncle burst into tears of joy; he thought he was doomed, but here he was, alive against all odds. The other freed individuals echoed similar sentiments.

---

After rescuing those who had been tied up, Scholar Song waved to Lu Fei and her sister.

They got up from the ground and approached Scholar Song.

Scholar Song asked, “Lu Fei, have you seen Zhuge Yue and Zhuge Zhongyang?”

Lu Fei shook her head. “They seem to have gotten separated from us. I thought they were with you.”

“I see.” Scholar Song rubbed his temples, feeling a headache coming on. It was frustrating to learn that the passengers had split into several groups. 

“I was with Tuba, Gao, and his girlfriend when we fell together. Zhuge and the others are not with us. First, let me take you to a safe place; then I’ll try to find Zhuge Zhongyang and the others,” Scholar Song replied.

After saying this, he glanced at the surrounding passengers.

None of them had any outdoor survival experience. After narrowly escaping the gorilla threat, they were now resting weakly on the ground.

Not just the passengers, Scholar Song himself lacked outdoor survival skills—he had only watched survival shows on TV.

Well, I’ll just take Lu Fei and her sister, along with the other passengers, to the ancient city first. Scholar Song thought to himself.

---

“Everyone, please quiet down,” Scholar Song clapped his hands and said.

After all, it was thanks to Scholar Song’s appearance that the gorillas had fled, and the passengers gradually settled down, focusing their attention on him.

“Ahem, as you all saw, this area is not safe. Besides the gorillas, there are other ferocious beasts lurking. Earlier, my companions and I spotted an ancient city in that direction. If anyone is willing to join me, I can lead you there,” Scholar Song announced.

The passengers exchanged glances, some gleeful, some grateful... but inevitably, there were also those who remained skeptical. Each person had their own thoughts.

But Scholar Song couldn’t afford to worry about that right now.

For those willing to follow him, he would do his best to care for them. For those who didn’t want to tag along, he wouldn’t force them. He hadn’t reached the point of begging others to let him help them.

For now, he could only do what he could... after all, forcing it wouldn’t bring happiness.

---

“Strength is at the first-grade, five orifices, with the ear orifice opened.”

“He values friendship greatly and has a delicate mind.”

“Oh, he’s even willing to actively seek out and assist the remaining passengers? Does he possess a good-hearted disposition?”

“Ah... my life’s blemish, welcome to ‘Heavenly Island!’”
