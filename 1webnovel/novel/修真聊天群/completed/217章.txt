Scholar Song, do you want to learn the Turtle Breath Technique?

“Huh? What’s going on?”

The grand champion of the Sword Flight Competition, the Wind Blade Yang Yuxiang, was waiting for that 'helicopter' to fly alongside him. He was channeling all his energy into his flying sword, eager to compete with this bizarre helicopter!

But just as they flew side by side, that peculiar helicopter suddenly accelerated again. With a swift whoosh, it left the three-time champion Yang Yuxiang behind by over seven hundred meters! In the blink of an eye, it was already several kilometers away!

The scene was so reminiscent of the moment when Yang Yuxiang had outpaced Venerable White’s helicopter; it felt like déjà vu.

In the distance, Yang Yuxiang could vaguely see a handsome man on the helicopter waving at him with a smug grin!

“Interesting, very interesting!” Yang Yuxiang wasn’t angry; instead, he burst into hearty laughter. “Now, this is exciting! If you could only manage that speed earlier, I wouldn’t even have broken a sweat. Now we're talking—I can finally take this a bit more seriously!”

As he spoke, he formed a sword seal with his hands, and the flying sword under his feet surged with wind, creating a mini tornado. He was called the 'Wind Blade' for a reason, as his specialty was wind-based techniques.

Wind and lightning were both attributes associated with speed in escape techniques. However, lightning was known for its explosive power, while wind was celebrated for its endurance and sustained velocity.

With the mini-tornado swirling around him, Yang Yuxiang took on a surfing stance on his sword, and with a dazzling flash, he accelerated, pursuing Venerable White with frenzied speed.

The chilling winds whipped against his face, tousling his hair and making him look even more striking.

Just five breaths later, he had already caught up to the bizarre helicopter.

Inside the helicopter, Scholar Song looked back at the Wind Blade with envy—now this was the proper way to ‘fly with a sword!’

Cultivators would ride their swords, some with their hands behind their backs looking aloof, and others energetically surfing through the air, with the gentle breeze caressing their faces while their hair danced in the wind, and their clothes billowed lightly.

So stylish!

This was the kind of 'sword flight' that Scholar Song longed for; unfortunately, every time he had the chance to try, things went awry.

Especially that one time with Venerable White’s “Sword Flight Inheritance” service, where he had to lie flat on the sword. No matter how cool a cultivator looked, sprawled flat like a frog on a sword was not a good look at all. Just thinking about it felt like a stain on his life.

As Scholar Song was lost in envy, the Wind Blade Yang Yuxiang had already caught up to the strange helicopter.

“Heh, not bad,” Venerable White acknowledged with a nod. “But you’re still too inexperienced!”

Venerable White then formed a hand seal and casually executed a sword escape technique: “Heavenly Roc Escape!”

The Heavenly Roc Escape was a widely known sword escape technique among cultivators, with nearly every practitioner possessing a copy. 

However, just because it was common didn’t mean it was ineffective.

The Heavenly Roc Escape was part of the legendary ‘Nine Escapes of the Divine Beasts’ from ancient times. Even though the version circulating in the world was incomplete, among the fourth-grade escape techniques, few could rival it.

Its only drawback was the difficulty in mastering it… Although nearly every cultivator had a copy, those who had successfully learned it were still fewer than a hundred.

When the Heavenly Roc Escape was activated, a pair of gigantic golden wings appeared on either side of the helicopter’s exterior. With a flap of the wings, the speed of the helicopter skyrocketed once more, leaving the Wind Blade Yang Yuxiang in the dust.

“Whoa, is that the Heavenly Roc Escape?” Yang Yuxiang was initially shocked by this technique, but then he had another thought: “The Heavenly Roc Escape is a sword escape technique, so that means the exterior of that helicopter is a flying sword?”

This was mind-blowing! How could a flying sword look like that?

“But… regardless of whether it’s a flying sword or not, since the Heavenly Roc Escape is out, it’s worth me going all out!” The Wind Blade Yang Yuxiang felt a fire igniting within him.

If he could surpass the ‘Heavenly Roc Escape,’ then the next Sword Flight Competition champion would undoubtedly be him.

“I’m fired up; my blood is boiling!” Yang Yuxiang raised his hands high, unleashing all his true energy. “Watch my Moonlight Escape!”

The Moonlight Escape was a premium sword escape technique from the Falling Moon Sword Sect.

Wherever the moonlight shone, that was where our sword escape could reach—that was the essence of the Moonlight Escape. Unfortunately, it was daytime; if it were nighttime under a bright moon, his Moonlight Escape would have been even faster.

With a confident smile, Yang Yuxiang activated his Moonlight Escape. Beneath his flying sword, two crescent moons appeared alongside the swirling winds, resembling small wings.

Then, in a flash, Yang Yuxiang’s body shot forward like lightning.

This time, it took a little longer—after fifteen breaths, the Wind Blade finally caught up to Venerable White’s helicopter again!

“Senior, that guy is catching up!” Scholar Song turned to look behind him. The sword-flying cultivator was gaining speed, transforming from a small black dot to the size of a small fist.

“Hehe, what a formidable little guy,” Venerable White couldn’t help but compliment, even though he had intentionally suppressed the speed of the Heavenly Roc Escape to a fourth-grade level for fun.

But to catch up so quickly, this speed was already faster than most fifth-grade Spirit Emperors.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The Wind Blade Yang Yuxiang approached rapidly, aligning with Venerable White once more.

Then, he smugly spoke to Venerable White, “Friend, I can still go faster! How about you? Can you keep up?”

Venerable White shook his head and replied, “No, I’m waiting for you to catch up.”

“Ha ha ha! Interesting! Are you saying you can go faster? Then let’s see who’s faster!” The Wind Blade Yang Yuxiang was brimming with confidence.

Having caught up to the ‘Heavenly Roc Escape,’ he felt invincible.

“Hmm, you’re the fastest junior I’ve encountered lately. I’m going to reward you by showing you what true sword flight speed looks like.” Venerable White smiled.

That smile felt like it contained all the beauty in the world, causing Yang Yuxiang to momentarily freeze in awe.

Then…

He saw the strange helicopter’s exterior move again!

It was speed like no other!

Unbelievable speed!

If his own full-speed movement was like a flash of lightning, then this bizarre helicopter had shattered the constraints of space, leaping through it like a spatial jump!

In an instant, it appeared at the very limit of his vision.

In another blink, it had completely vanished… already flashing to a distance he couldn't hope to pursue.

This was the kind of speed that made him truly feel despair. The gap between him and his opponent felt as if it were an insurmountable chasm.

“True sword flight speed?” The Wind Blade Yang Yuxiang stood dazed on his flying sword, frozen in place for quite some time…

After a good ten minutes, he finally sighed, “What an impressive senior.”

Compared to the other’s speed, his own proud velocity felt like that of a snail.

But instead of feeling discouraged, a flame of determination ignited within him.

“Senior, one day, I will reach that kind of speed too!” He shouted toward the empty sky with all his might.

Then… it was time to go back and prepare for a breakthrough to the fifth-grade Spirit Emperor realm!

He had lingered in the fourth-grade realm for far too long; in fact, he had intentionally restrained his progression these past few years to fulfill his dream of being a ‘four-time champion.’

But now, he no longer needed to hold back.

Being a four-time champion was just a fleeting thought—he had a bigger goal, a more ambitious dream!

That was to achieve the terrifying speed demonstrated by that senior and, if possible, to have another chance to race with him in sword flight.

Ah… and that smile from earlier was just amazing. It felt like it surpassed all the beautiful senior sisters and junior sisters he had ever seen combined.

What the heck was I just thinking about? The Wind Blade Yang Yuxiang shook his head vigorously, driving away those ridiculous thoughts.

“Back to training, then… and I’ll cultivate stronger escape techniques. Before I can match that senior’s speed, I’m going to dominate the fifth-grade Sword Flight Competition!” Yang Yuxiang set a new goal for himself.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Meanwhile…

Inside the helicopter, which was essentially a one-time-use flying sword.

“Ahhhh—” A long, shrill scream pierced the air, deafening those nearby.

It wasn’t Scholar Song’s scream.

Despite having a slight fear of heights and a newly developed fear of speed, he was safe inside the protective shell of the helicopter and wouldn’t be scared.

The one screaming was the poor flight instructor, Xiao Li.

Xiao Li, while unconscious, had vaguely felt an odd sensation of weightlessness and then woke up to find the scenery around him retreating at a terrifying speed.

That strange weightlessness was actually caused by the helicopter moving too fast.

Of course, the speed was only one reason; the other was that the helicopter was ascending vertically into the sky, which was the real cause of Instructor Xiao Li’s sensation of weightlessness.

Venerable White frowned in displeasure and, with a single palm strike, knocked the shrieking instructor back into unconsciousness.

“Senior, shouldn’t we be heading back now?” Scholar Song asked, having already left that flying sword cultivator far behind.

“Yeah,” Venerable White nodded.

Scholar Song beamed, “Then let’s find a place to land!”

Venerable White didn’t answer immediately. After a pause, he asked, “Scholar Song, I suddenly want to teach you a little spell. Do you want to learn it?”

“What spell?” Scholar Song was puzzled as to why his senior suddenly wanted to teach him a spell, but spells were always welcome, so he wouldn’t refuse.

“Well, it’s the Turtle Breath Technique,” Venerable White said serenely.

Scholar Song: “…”

Upon hearing the name of this technique, a bad premonition surged within him like an erupting volcano!
