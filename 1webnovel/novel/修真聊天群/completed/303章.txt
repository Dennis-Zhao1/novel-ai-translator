**I Have a Few Wishes**

1. To cook a meal and watch him eat it bite by bite.  
2. To accompany him on an adventure that’s neither too small nor too big.  
3. To save him once.  
4. To read many books together.  
5. …  

The first three options were underlined. It seemed like all of these things were what Lady Jiu Deng wanted to do.

After putting away her small notebook, she hurried forward and gently caught the tiny Scholar Song, who was no bigger than the palm of her hand.

Scholar Song let out a sigh of relief. "Thank you, Lady Jiu Deng."

"You're welcome! By the way, your expression when you called for help was amazing. I really appreciate it," she said with a thumbs-up and a smile.

Scholar Song: "..."

Lady, your angle of appreciation is too bizarre, making me feel quite embarrassed!

With one hand supporting Scholar Song, Jiu Deng waved the other hand lightly. The golden Buddhist bead flew back from the giant tree, still covered in the skin of a one-inch snake.

The golden bead was surrounded by a layer of spiritual energy that kept it from shrinking down with the snake skin.

As Scholar Song gazed at the shed snake skin, envy flickered in his eyes... The skin of the one-inch snake was the perfect material for crafting a ‘space pouch’—a primitive version of an item storage bag.

"Do you want it?" Lady Jiu Deng asked, shaking the snake skin gently in front of Scholar Song.

"I want it!" Scholar Song answered honestly. Ever since he saw Fay Yu's ‘shrink pouch,’ he had been incredibly envious.

"Hehe, but this is mine, and I won’t just give it to you. So, give up on that idea," Lady Jiu Deng said mischievously, putting away the snake skin that made Scholar Song drool.

Scholar Song: "..."

After a moment, he forced out a bitter smile and asked, "Lady Jiu Deng, what happened to the two passengers who traveled with Zhuge Zhongyang?"

Since they were already here, they might as well bring those two passengers back with them.

"Their aura has mixed with that of the previous group of eight, so they probably ran into each other. The cultivators from the Nine Nether Realm are only targeting your two friends; no one is chasing those two passengers, so they haven’t been harmed," Jiu Deng replied.

Hearing this, Scholar Song felt a slight sense of relief.

...

Behind them, Zhuge Zhongyang stared blankly at the suddenly appeared bald girl—where did she come from?

Only after Lady Jiu Deng appeared to catch Scholar Song could Zhuge Yue and Zhuge Zhongyang see her figure.

At the same time, Zhuge Zhongyang was confused: how did Scholar Song suddenly become so small? Not just him; even Zhuge Yue beside him had shrunk down.

Zhuge Yue had regained some of her size and was now about eighty centimeters tall, resembling a little loli.

Adding to this the earlier invisible being—and the fact that Scholar Song had run straight up a ten-meter high tree trunk—Zhuge Zhongyang’s mind was in a whirlwind. What in the world was going on?

He found himself unable to sort through his chaotic thoughts no matter how hard he tried.

"Come on, say hello to your friend," Jiu Deng said, holding Scholar Song in her palm and presenting him to Zhuge Zhongyang.

"Whoa!" Scholar Song was startled by Zhuge Zhongyang's enormous face.

Imagine a human face magnified dozens of times—that was a horror movie waiting to happen!

"Lady Jiu Deng, don’t get so close!" Scholar Song shouted.

Jiu Deng playfully shook Scholar Song in front of Zhuge Zhongyang a few times before pulling him back.

Scholar Song rubbed his eyes and turned to glance at Jiu Deng's face... fortunately, even magnified dozens of times, a cultivator's face remained smooth, fair, and not monstrous.

"Song, what on earth is happening?" Zhuge Zhongyang asked cautiously.

"This kind of thing is hard to explain quickly. Hold onto Zhuge Yue and follow me. We need to get back to the ancient city first; after getting you out of here, I’ll explain everything properly," Scholar Song sighed and said.

After all, when leaving Tiangui Island, their memories would definitely be erased, so explaining now would be a waste of breath. Better to get them away from Tiangui Island first.

"You two follow me." Jiu Deng laughed, leading the way ahead.

Zhuge Zhongyang silently picked up Zhuge Yue and followed Jiu Deng.

On the way, Zhuge Zhongyang anxiously asked, "By the way, Song. Did you run into Gao or anyone else? How are they doing?"

It was all his fault for insisting on visiting the vacation island in the East Sea, which had put everyone in danger. If anything happened to Gao and the others, he would never find peace in his life.

"Don’t worry, Gao, Tu Bo, Lu Fei, and her sister have all safely left here. My main goal was to find you and take you away." Scholar Song smiled.

Upon hearing Scholar Song's explanation, Zhuge Zhongyang felt a lot more at ease.

Soon, both of them, filled with countless questions, followed Scholar Song to the ancient city.

This time, with Jiu Deng leading the way, the four of them successfully reached the base of the tall tower.

"Enter this tower, and then follow the instructions inside to complete a transaction. After that, you can leave here," Scholar Song explained.

"What about you, Song? Aren't you coming back with us?" Zhuge Yue asked, puzzled. By this time, her size had almost returned to normal.

"I need to wait a bit longer. Look at my current state; I’ll have to wait until I return to normal before discussing anything," Scholar Song chuckled. He was still sitting in Jiu Deng's palm, feeling quite uncomfortable. "Don’t worry; you go ahead. Once I return to my original size, I’ll catch up. Make sure to reunite with Gao and the others after leaving, so you won’t get lost again."

Zhuge Yue and Zhuge Zhongyang nodded and turned to enter the tower.

This strange place felt like a nightmare; they really didn’t want to linger any longer.

...

After watching Zhuge Yue and Zhuge Zhongyang leave, Scholar Song let out a sigh of relief.

"Well then, Lady Jiu Deng, I think it's about time for me to take my leave. If I want to exit, do I need to seal my memories?" Scholar Song inquired.

"You seem to know quite a bit about Tiangui Island," Jiu Deng said, lifting Scholar Song and poking him lightly with her finger.

"Don’t mess around; that really hurts," Scholar Song swatted her finger away and replied, "I’m in contact with some seniors. They all sealed their memories when leaving Tiangui Island. Although I don’t know why they willingly sealed their memories to leave... It seems that cultivators must seal their memories to exit Tiangui Island."

"Yes, you guessed correctly." Jiu Deng giggled. "Cultivators have a different process for leaving Tiangui Island than ordinary people. I need to take you to the most mysterious place on Tiangui Island, where you’ll make an oath. After that, I’ll teach you how to seal your memories, but you can only leave Tiangui Island once you’ve completed the sealing."

"Then please lead me to the oath-taking place, Lady Jiu Deng." Scholar Song clasped his fists in respect.

"Not in a hurry," Jiu Deng squinted her eyes and smiled, pulling out the snake skin with the Buddhist bead attached. "Want it?"

Scholar Song's eyes fixed on the one-inch snake's skin. "I want it!"

"If you want it, then you need to trade with me," Lady Jiu Deng said cheerfully.

"Trade? What do you want in exchange?" Scholar Song asked—he had quite a few items belonging to cultivators.

He had the Qingfeng pendant, bronze ring, the Ba Sui sword, the Wudao stone with Mistress Scallion growing on it, the Scallion Demon crystal, the brooch that Fay Yu had lent him, as well as various charms and elixirs.

Among these, the most valuable was undoubtedly the Wudao stone. The other items, while precious, paled in comparison to the snake skin and couldn't be traded equally.

However, if she wanted him to trade the Wudao stone for the snake skin, he certainly wouldn’t agree. The Wudao stone was extremely precious to him, far more important than the snake skin. Plus, it had Mistress Scallion growing on it!

"You have quite a few items, but nothing I find appealing," Lady Jiu Deng chuckled.

"Then what do you want?" Scholar Song asked, subconsciously shrinking back—he wasn’t going to sell himself!

"I want you... to read books with me for a while," Lady Jiu Deng said, poking Scholar Song with her finger and laughing heartily.

"Just read books for a while?" Scholar Song asked, curious.

"Yep, just read books for a while," Lady Jiu Deng laughed.

"Deal!" Scholar Song agreed without hesitation.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Green mountains, clear waters, and a small Buddhist temple.

A flickering lamp, an ancient Buddha, and mountains of Buddhist scriptures.

This was where Lady Jiu Deng resided on Tiangui Island.

"Although I wanted to get you some Confucian or Taoist books, I’m sorry to say that I’m a disciple of the Buddhist school. Besides these scriptures, I don’t have any other collections," Jiu Deng said, sitting cross-legged on a mat, looking lazy.

"What are these scriptures about?" Scholar Song asked curiously. "Are they cultivation techniques for cultivators?"

"You’re overthinking it," Lady Jiu Deng rolled her eyes. "Even I can’t just casually teach my cultivation methods to others; that’s a rule among cultivators."

"So these are just ordinary Buddhist scriptures?" Scholar Song’s lips twitched—he felt that his ‘true self’ was becoming increasingly misguided. Would reading too many Buddhist scriptures make his ‘true self’ turn bald?

"Don’t take it so seriously; just think of it as a trade. If you accompany me to read books, I’ll give you the one-inch snake's skin. Oh, and can you lend me Mistress Scallion? I haven’t seen her in three hundred years, and I miss her a bit," Lady Jiu Deng suddenly said.

"Just don’t harm her; she’s been with you for three hundred years," Scholar Song said as he reached into his pocket.

"Hiss!" He was bitten hard by Mistress Scallion again.

Nevertheless, Scholar Song took out the Wudao stone and Mistress Scallion, handing them to Lady Jiu Deng.

"Hey, where did the scallion sprout go? Why is it just the scallion bud left?" Lady Jiu Deng asked curiously as she accepted the Wudao stone and the scallion spirit.

"Uh, there was a small accident," Scholar Song said, feeling a bit embarrassed.

Seeing that Scholar Song didn’t want to elaborate, Lady Jiu Deng didn’t press any further. She held the Wudao stone and began poking Mistress Scallion with her finger—poke, poke, poke!

This was a part of her life’s blemish.

Poke hard!
