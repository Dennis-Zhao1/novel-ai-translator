**Chapter: The Twin-Tail Venerable White! (Monthly Ticket Request)**

In the afternoon, Father Song finished his meal and headed back to the company. He worked at the National Power Grid Company, and his job wasn’t particularly exhausting... but Father Song had grown somewhat weary of his current life.

He secretly planned to save up a bit more money, waiting until Scholar Song graduated from university. Then, he wanted to open a fitness equipment factory with two close friends.

In recent years, home-use small fitness equipment had been flying off the shelves, and Father Song had been tempted for quite some time. If it weren’t for his concern that a sudden business venture might impact Scholar Song’s studies, he would have already quit his job to take the plunge with his friends.

This matter was still under wraps between Father Song and his two friends; none of them had mentioned it to their families yet... but they had already started quietly planning and preparing for the factory. Within three years, at most, they aimed to get this factory up and running.

Meanwhile, in the living room, Mother Song was chatting with Zhao Yaya.

—Mother Song was asking which places in Wenzhou City were suitable for dates, specifically those with a nice ambiance and not overly chaotic.

She felt that given Scholar Song’s bookworm tendencies over the past few years, even if he wanted to take a girl out, he wouldn’t know where to go. As a caring mother eager for her son’s future, she wanted to prepare a bit early.

As they chatted, Scholar Song pushed open the living room door, ready to grab some snacks.

His family always kept a stock of snacks in the living room—whether it was Mother Song enjoying a Korean drama or Father Song absorbed in a Western sci-fi film, those snacks always came in handy.

“Mom, Yaya, what are you two talking about?” Scholar Song casually asked as he squatted down to rummage through the snacks.

“We’re discussing where you could take that girl, Fay Yu, for some fun,” Mother Song replied earnestly. Speaking of which, the girl’s name was a bit unusual—Fay Yu...

Well, names were just a façade. What mattered was that she was pretty, understanding, and quite fun!

“Scholar, I’m leaving the car keys with you. Wenzhou City has plenty of fun places to explore—take that girl out for a spin! I’m rooting for you two!” Zhao Yaya encouraged Scholar Song, giving him a thumbs up.

“Pfft! What are you two scheming about?” Scholar Song laughed. “Fay and I are not in that kind of relationship!”

Fay Yu was indeed beautiful... but Scholar Song knew his own limits. He wasn't some harem protagonist whose mere presence attracted all the female leads—after all, this was only the second time he had met Fay Yu in real life!

“And besides, Fay has plans tonight and can’t stay out much longer,” Scholar Song added.

“She’s leaving soon?” Mother Song’s expression fell at the news.

“I’ll head back to my room then,” Scholar Song said, grabbing the snacks with a cheeky grin.

Before Mother Song could say anything else, he dashed away.

...

...

When Scholar Song opened the door to his room, he blinked in surprise at the sight before him.

“Aha! Scholar, you’re here!” Fay Yu turned her head, flashing a shy smile at Scholar Song.

At that moment, Fay Yu was kneeling next to Venerable White, taking pictures of him.

Taking pictures wasn’t a big deal, but the problem was that Venerable White’s current pose was a bit off.

On the bed, Venerable White was arranged into an adorably awkward position by Fay Yu—his hands were raised with his index fingers pointed at his face.

“Pfft!” Scholar Song burst out laughing.

“Um, Scholar, I just thought Venerable White would look cute like this when I saw him. Hahaha,” Fay Yu explained with a shy giggle.

She was a little worried that Scholar Song might scold her for being disrespectful to Venerable White.

However, Scholar Song’s next reaction greatly surpassed Fay Yu's expectations.

He gave her a thumbs up. “Good! If you could tie Venerable White’s hair into twin-tails, he’d definitely look even cuter!”

—Perhaps influenced by the antics of his seniors, Wild Blade of Three Tides and Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram in the Ninefold Land group chat, Scholar Song occasionally had these ‘brain-fog moments’ where he did some really reckless things without even realizing it.

Fay Yu was momentarily stunned, then her eyes sparkled. “Wow! Scholar, you have a great eye!”

Then Fay Yu suggested, “How about we try it together?”

Scholar Song hesitated for a moment, worried, “What if we wake Venerable White?”

“Don’t worry! As long as we have no ill intentions, we won’t disturb the meditating Venerable White. I have plenty of experience!” Fay Yu assured, patting her chest—she was quite experienced! But who knew if the Lingdie Virtuoso came out of meditation each time with a stylish new hairstyle?

“Okay, let’s give it a shot?” Scholar Song felt tempted. “I’ll go get some hair ties!”

“I have hairbands!” Fay Yu replied, pulling out an array of colorful hairbands from her pocket. Although she usually liked to let her long black hair flow freely, she occasionally switched up her hairstyle. She had all kinds of girlie accessories!

They were well-prepared!

“What kind of twin-tails should we try?” Scholar Song asked. He hadn’t tied hair for a girl before, but he had seen plenty of girls with twin-tails.

He knew there were many styles of twin-tails.

For instance, there were the classic twin-tails that were tied high above the ears, giving a playful, cute look.

Or, one twin-tail could be tied high on the head while the other hung down behind the ear, making for a fun style.

There were also options to tie the twin-tails behind the ears, letting them hang straight down, paired with bangs for a cute yet scholarly vibe.

And they could braid the twin-tails that hung behind the ears and let them fall over the shoulders for a refreshing look.

With various hair accessories and tying methods, the possibilities were endless, like a kaleidoscope of styles.

“Let’s try them all!” Fay Yu said decisively. “And not just twin-tails; we can also do a single ponytail, a bun, and a flower bud hairstyle! I know plenty of ways to style hair!”

“Alright, you style, and I’ll assist!” Scholar Song was completely caught up in the excitement, no longer thinking about the consequences.

Next...

Scholar Song carefully lifted Venerable White’s neck, while Fay Yu pulled all of Venerable White’s hair from beneath him.

“Venerable White’s hair is so long, thick, and silky,” Fay Yu marveled as she gently brushed through Venerable White’s hair, straightening it out. Then she said, “Okay, Scholar, you hold the hair in a ponytail while I tie it!”

“Got it!” Scholar Song gently lowered Venerable White’s neck and took the hair from Fay Yu’s hands. Following her instructions, he gathered the long hair above the ears into a ponytail.

It was indeed soft... Scholar Song thought to himself. The feeling was like holding the finest silk, making it hard to let go.

“Scholar, raise your hand a bit higher; otherwise, it won’t look good at the roots,” Fay Yu instructed.

Next, she pulled out two white hair ties, tying a lovely bow at the spot where Scholar Song was holding the hair.

“Now the other side! I feel like the white ties paired with Venerable White’s black hair look super good together,” Fay Yu exclaimed eagerly.

“Same here!” Scholar Song shifted to the other side, helping Fay Yu tie the other ponytail.

Done!

At this moment, Venerable White lay peacefully on the bed, his face serene. With his long hair tied into twin-tails, his features were fully revealed, looking even more picturesque.

And with those twin-tails... there was an indescribable charm!

“Awesome!” Fay Yu exclaimed as she grabbed her phone, snapping away at the twin-tailed Venerable White.

“Come on, Scholar! Make Venerable White raise his index fingers like before!” Fay Yu urged excitedly, like a child who found a new toy.

“Sure!” Scholar Song complied, positioning Venerable White’s hands so the index fingers pointed at his cheek.

Wow, this version of Venerable White was adorably cute!

If they hadn’t been living together for quite some time, Scholar Song felt his heart would be racing right now!

“Oh dear, I can’t take it anymore! I want to take Venerable White home to keep as a pet,” Fay Yu mumbled, snapping pictures fervently.

“Wait, don’t include me in the shots!” Scholar Song said.

Fay Yu stuck out her tongue.

After Scholar Song moved aside a bit, she resumed her photography spree.

“Okay, Scholar, let’s change hairstyles!” Fay Yu said after her last series of clicks.

...

...

Next up was the single ponytail version of Venerable White!

The single ponytail version of Venerable White was also amazing—snap, snap, snap!

The twin-braid version of Venerable White was also incredible—snap, snap, snap!

The bun version of Venerable White was unbearably cute—snap, snap, snap!

Hmm, what is this hairstyle? Two horn-like tufts? A bullhorn hairstyle? Oh my, it looks great on Venerable White too—snap, snap, snap!

And this one where the braids were coiled up on top? What style is that? Regardless, it looks good—snap, snap, snap!

Venerable White had been thoroughly styled.

...

...

Scholar Song lost track of how many hairstyles he and Fay Yu had put Venerable White through or how many poses they had tried.

Finally, Fay Yu was satisfied. She sneakily glanced at Scholar Song and smiled mischievously—after all, Scholar was the best; he cooperated with her in these activities.

She stretched and squinted her eyes, saying, “Hehe, I took so many pictures! When I get home, I’ll definitely show these to my dad. Oh, Scholar, I’ll pick out a few of the best ones and send them to you!”

“Hahaha, sure... huh?” Scholar Song had been laughing halfway through when suddenly his ‘brain-fog moments’ returned, and he snapped back to reality.

Oh crap... what did I just do?

As he recalled the earlier actions, Scholar Song suddenly felt his legs go weak—he felt like his acrophobia had kicked in unexpectedly.

“Ahem, Fay Yu. Just keep those photos saved quietly. I mean, I see Venerable White every day, so you don’t need to send me any,” Scholar Song coughed a couple of times and said seriously.

“Hmm, I’ll see how it goes then,” Fay Yu replied, but in her mind, she thought—regardless, it was the fruit of their labor together!

When the time came, she had to pick out a few of the best pictures of Venerable White to send to Scholar Song secretly...
