**Chapter: The Heartache of the Hermit of North River**

Even if the journey of cultivation is fraught with terrifying tribulations like the fearsome lightning tribulation encountered by Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan, what does it matter? Even if greater calamities lie ahead, what difference does it make?

Do I even have to say the answer?

No matter how many dangers lurk, no matter the myriad tribulations that arise, no matter the constant threat of death lurking around the corner...

Yet, a life as grand and sweeping as this could never be compared to an ordinary, mundane existence, right?

To hear the path of enlightenment in the morning and face death by evening—what more could one ask for?

Indeed!

He would not let this opportunity slip by. Unless one was a waste of space waiting for death or a cowardly mouse, who would abandon such a chance?

———

Inside the Ninefold Land group chat, a lively conversation was taking place.

Fay Yu was sharing with the Hermit of North River the details of her recent trip to City J—how she met Scholar Song, found Ghost Lantern Temple, and captured the Phantom Spirit.

Seeing Fay Yu online brought a wave of calm to Scholar Song’s mind.

He pressed the enter key with emphasis, sending his first message into the Ninefold Land group.

**Scholar Song**: "Hello, esteemed seniors."

A very ordinary greeting, but for a newcomer, this seemed like the perfect way to start, right?

**Fay Yu**: "Which senior has just logged on? Hello, senior!"

Fay Yu was delighted to see him. To her, anyone in the group besides 'Sable Sixteen' was a senior.

“Wait, is that Scholar Song?” the Hermit of North River expressed his surprise.

He recalled that a few weeks ago, the group leader, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, had mistakenly added a regular person. But the newcomer hadn’t said anything and was nearly forgotten in the group.

He thought the person would soon leave—after all, if a regular person didn’t know they were mingling with cultivators, they’d surely think they’d stumbled into a group of lunatics and would leave without a second thought.

Yet, here was Scholar Song still in the group after so long. And to greet them as seniors, could it be that he had discovered something special about the group?

**Scholar Song**: "Hello, Hermit of North River. Fay Yu, thank you for the two boxes of medicinal herbs!"

“Wait, wait, wait? It’s Scholar Song!!” Fay Yu quickly realized, her joy palpable. She had been searching for the senior in the group named 'Song Shuhang' and was thrilled to see him online today.

**Scholar Song**: "Fay Yu, just call me Shuhang. I was mistakenly added to the group by the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain. It turns out my account number is only one digit off from yours. I intended to contact you, but he added me instead."

“Wow! I hadn’t noticed that our numbers are just one digit apart. We must be fated!” Fay Yu exclaimed cheerfully—this girl, it seemed, would take a while to stop calling him 'Scholar'!

The Hermit of North River pieced it together; the 'kind Scholar Song' Fay Yu had encountered in Jiangnan City was indeed this Scholar Song.

Now it made sense that upon entering the group, he addressed everyone as seniors.

**Hermit of North River**: "Young friend Shuhang, since you’ve started messaging in the group, you must have seen something of significance from Fay Yu, right?" He added a smiling emoji to his message.

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain's divination was indeed impressive, far surpassing that of the Master Diviner of the Copper Hexagram. This young friend truly seemed to have a connection with the group. But why had the Immortal Sage not shared the result of his divination earlier?

**Fay Yu**: "What could Scholar Song possibly see in me?"

**Scholar Song**: "To be honest, it has a lot to do with you, Fay Yu. When I was helping you find Ghost Lantern Temple, I felt a significant difference between you and ordinary people. But more importantly, the two boxes of 'Simplified Body Refinement Liquid' you sent—I just tried following the Alchemical Sage's formula… and I just swallowed a mouthful of the liquid."

**Hermit of North River**: "Oh? Did you actually succeed in refining the Body Refinement Liquid?" The Hermit was astonished. A regular person receiving Fay Yu's herbs and successfully refining the liquid without guidance? 

When did alchemy become this easy?

Or could it be that Scholar Song possessed an extraordinary fortune, an unbelievable stroke of luck?

Fortune is an enigmatic concept, but one cannot deny its existence. The Hermit knew someone with incredible luck—this person could go out and find money without lifting a finger. Just one outing would cover their expenses for days.

Unfortunately, despite such formidable luck, they lacked any talent for cultivation. Otherwise, the Hermit would have taken him as a disciple without hesitation.

**Fay Yu** was equally astonished: "Scholar Song, my herbs should have only arrived around noon today, right? That means it’s only been enough time to refine one batch of pills? Did you really succeed on the first try?"

“I’m not sure if I succeeded or failed… Although I followed the steps in the formula meticulously, there was a little mishap by the time I reached the forty-first ingredient,” Scholar Song explained. “In the end, I only managed to obtain about five spoonfuls of the Body Refinement Liquid. I tried taking a bit, and my body felt significantly reinforced. My vision, physical strength, endurance, and overall strength have all improved!”

“Given those results, there’s no doubt you succeeded in refining it. Even if there were some mishaps, it would only mean the quality was a bit subpar,” the Hermit of North River confirmed.

The liquid refinement process is one of the most basic alchemical concoctions, with very low resistance to medicinal properties.

Unlike high-tier pills that have stringent quality requirements, lower-tier ones are more forgiving. Even if the quality is slightly lower, taking more can achieve similar effects—this is why the effects of the Alchemical Sage's simplified body refinement liquid, despite being half as potent, were still praised by everyone in the group.

If it were a higher-tier pill, a drop in quality would create a natural disparity in effect, and it would be difficult to compensate for the lack of quality just by increasing the quantity. The higher the tier of the pill, the more resistant it is to medicinal properties. If the quality drops even slightly, one might need hundreds of lower-quality pills to compensate. The more one took, the stronger the resistance, and eventually, those high-tier pills would become ineffective for the cultivator.

“Honestly, what I’m more curious about is how many batches of Body Refinement Liquid you managed to refine, Young Friend Shuhang? How many times were you successful?” the Hermit inquired with intrigue.

“Batches? I think there was only one. I only have one electric stove,” Scholar Song replied honestly.

Before he could finish, Fay Yu chimed in: “In terms of times, Scholar Song, it should only be once. Because it has only been five or six hours since my herbs arrived.”

“One batch, and you succeeded on the first try?!” The Hermit of North River suddenly felt his knees go weak; he wanted to kneel down and cry—he was a hermit, and everything in his cultivation journey had been self-taught.

How many times had he failed when he was refining the Body Refinement Liquid? He could no longer count! Suffice it to say, he had failed countless times, losing everything before finally grasping the method to refine it! True, he had been working with the older, more complex formula, but still—people can really make one feel inferior!

By the way, what exactly is this electric stove? Is it a new type of alchemical furnace?

Could it be that Fay Yu gifted Scholar Song a furnace? Could this new model increase the success rate?

With that thought, the Hermit of North River tentatively asked: “Young Friend Shuhang, the electric stove you mentioned, could it be a new model of alchemical furnace?”

“Oh? Is there such a model of alchemical furnace?” Fay Yu replied, puzzled.

Seeing Fay Yu's response, the Hermit felt his heart ache—he had a premonition that Scholar Song’s next reply would bring him to tears!

“……” Scholar Song looked toward the electric stove in his kitchen, his fingers tapping on the keyboard: “No, it’s just a home-use model number 12 electric stove produced by Weizhen Company.”
