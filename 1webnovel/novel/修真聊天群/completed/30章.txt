**Morning of Enlightenment, Evening of Death? So be it!**

At this moment, in the girls' dormitory B6 building.

The view here perfectly overlooks the school's sports field.

“Wow, haha! You girls, come here and take a look! Can you believe there’s still a fool running on the track in this weather?” A girl with shoulder-length hair laughed heartily.

“Is this just another one of those flashy stunts to attract clueless little girls?” Another girl, curvaceous and lounging on her bed, fanned herself with a small hand fan, trying to dispel the heat. She was feeling really hot and couldn’t help but think of a certain someone.

The girl with short hair chuckled, “If he’s really trying to show off, then he’s failed miserably. No girl in this world would think such a fool is cool, right? By the way, Lu Fei, come take a look. That guy seems a bit familiar. Is he from our class?”

“Let me see.” The curvy girl climbed over to the window to take a look at the field.

Just then, she saw the man stop running and take off his shirt, holding it in his hand. His muscular build was on full display, showcasing a strong back and a defined waist, radiating raw power.

The girl with shoulder-length hair giggled, “Wow, without his shirt, it’s hard to tell. His physique is really impressive. Just this body alone could attract quite a few clueless girls!”

“He’s from our class!” The curvy girl’s eyes widened in surprise, as she realized she had been thinking about him just moments ago.

What a great physique, so manly!

And that refreshing aura about him—perhaps she should seize the opportunity before other girls realized his charms?!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Scholar Song stared at his clothes, noticing that they were not just soaked with sweat but also covered in dark, gritty impurities—these were the body impurities expelled along with the sweat.

He looked down at his body and indeed noticed some black specks and small particles clinging to his skin.

Purification of the body, purification of the body. It wasn’t just about strengthening his physique; the essential purpose was to refine the body and eliminate impurities.

Then, he reached down to touch his abdomen.

To his astonishment, he found something he hadn’t seen in a year and a half—his abs!

It had been about a year and a half since he last saw them, having lost his toned stomach to the sedentary lifestyle of cramming for university entrance exams in his senior year. What used to be firm abs had been replaced by a bit of flab.

But now, after just a few laps around the track, his abs had reappeared.

Moreover, many of the minor ailments plaguing his body had all vanished. For instance, the dull pain in his right shoulder from long hours spent at the computer, and the little neck aches from sitting too long—everything was gone!

Additionally, Scholar Song noticed that the world around him appeared exceptionally clear. He had suffered from slight nearsightedness, a consequence of overusing his eyes during the intense studying before the exams. But now, his nearsightedness had completely healed. In fact, his vision had improved dramatically.

With a focused mind, he could even see the tiniest details on a fly's corpse ten meters away by the field's fence… its legs!

“Calm down, calm down. Let’s test other aspects—strength and endurance have clearly improved. Now, let’s check my power.” Scholar Song tried to keep himself composed.

In reality, he was already bursting with excitement. His current state felt akin to being tipsy; his brain was desperately trying to maintain calm, but his body was revealing just how thrilled he truly was.

He clenched his fists, feeling an overwhelming surge of energy coursing through his arms, igniting an urge to unleash this pent-up power.

His gaze drifted toward the shot put practice area, where two sizes of shot puts were placed.

The school's shot put for men weighed 5 kg, while the one for women was 4 kg.

Scholar Song approached and picked up the heavier shot put, intending to test his newfound arm strength.

However, as he lifted it, he was momentarily taken aback—was this truly a shot put and not a basketball or soccer ball?

The increase in strength was unmistakable.

At that moment, he felt a burning desire to hurl the shot put and see how far he could throw it. But he restrained himself; who knows how far it might go? It could cause trouble.

“Just from a few drops of this potion, perhaps even a half-baked or failed product, my body has been enhanced to this extent. If I were to consume a full dose of the purification liquid, would I suddenly become a hulking powerhouse capable of feats like uprooting trees or lifting planes?” Scholar Song mused, distracted as he made his way back to the dorm.

He opened the dormitory door and headed to the kitchen, gazing at the hotpot and the black medicinal paste floating within.

“Purification liquid, true to its name—this is real purification liquid!”

That day, the man named Scholar Song was utterly humbled!

…

…

After joining the Ninefold Land Group, the concepts of heavenly tribulations, phantom spirits, ice pearls, and Fay Yu's extraordinary strength, along with the remarkable medicinal materials she sent him, all collided with Scholar Song's worldview.

And the ‘simplified version of the purification liquid’ dealt the most devastating blow to his understanding of reality.

June 4, 2019.

On this day, Scholar Song’s worldview, which had taken him eighteen years to build, crumbled completely, leaving not even a shred behind.

Building a worldview is no easy feat, but shattering it is surprisingly simple.

“Fine, if my worldview shatters, so be it. Only then can I see the true nature of the world,” Scholar Song murmured.

At that moment, his resolute heart kicked in.

First, he cleaned up the remnants of the ‘purification liquid’ from the hotpot, leaving not a single drop behind. For now… he dared not consume any more of it.

Then, he took a shower.

While bathing, he noticed his reflection in the mirror… he looked much fairer? His skin was now a bright, rosy hue, radiating a healthy glow. It was softer than even a woman’s skin!

Great, when his roommates came back from their stroll and saw him looking suddenly fairer, how would he explain it? Should he say he had used a new whitening cream?

Well, those weren’t the important issues.

What mattered was… the people in the Ninefold Land Group were all genuine cultivators!

Indeed, he could hardly keep his cool!

How could he remain calm? Anyone in his situation would feel the same.

A chat group that he thought was a gathering of delusional fantasy enthusiasts had suddenly transformed; now, every member appeared as a true cultivator, making everything seem so grand and high-end.

This was far more exhilarating than winning a five-million dollar lottery.

Compared to ‘cultivation,’ five million dollars was nothing but dust.

The two boxes of medicinal materials that Fay Yu sent him were worth far beyond that amount.

What should he do next?

Knowing that true ‘cultivation’ existed in this world, that miraculous herbs truly existed, and that various magical elixirs were real, along with the existence of the Ninefold Land Group!

Scholar Song pondered what his next step should be.

He sat down at his computer, logging into the chat account.

Taking a deep breath, his fingers hovered over the Ninefold Land Group icon in the chat software. Ignorance is bliss; it’s only when one knows more that fear arises. His finger paused over the Ninefold Land Group icon—this time, clicking it held a significance that was entirely different from before.

Now, a door leading away from the mundane world lay beneath his fingertips, right there on his computer screen!

He faced two choices.

Should he live a plain and ordinary life as a normal person?

Or should he delve deeper into the world of the cultivators in the Ninefold Land Group, immersing himself in their realm to become a cultivator himself? To step onto that perilous path of cultivation?

Cultivation is fraught with danger; just the thought of ‘heavenly tribulations’ sends shivers down the spine. The thunder tribulation that Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan faced in H City was terrifying, and it was merely a third-grade postnatal tribulation.

Even with Senior A Qi from the Su Clan by her side, she still faced the possibility of failure and injury. Without the presence of the senior, her life would have been at stake.

Scholar Song himself did not have such a powerful mentor; if he encountered such a dreadful thunder tribulation, he might end up with nothing but bones!

He hesitated… for all of one second!

Then, he decisively clicked on the Ninefold Land Group icon.
