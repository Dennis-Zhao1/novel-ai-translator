**The Burning Blade**

Scholar Song's “Fundamentals of Vajra Fist” was no weak attack, and it was only natural that the former subordinates of the 'Forum Master' would find themselves defeated.

“Phew~” Scholar Song sighed in relief, subtly revealing a flaw, attempting to lure out the last hidden assailant.

In the shadows, the Sunflower Cultivator sneered. His robust frame suddenly erupted into action, moving with the agility of a feline. In an instant, he appeared behind Scholar Song, gripping a sharp dagger tightly, and stabbed down fiercely.

Clang!

The defensive shield of his talisman flared to life once more, blocking the Sunflower Cultivator's strike.

Here he comes! Without hesitation, Scholar Song kicked backwards.

The Sunflower Cultivator, missing his attack, wore a look of regret as he gracefully leaped back. Then, he unleashed his mental pressure, his voice deep and commanding, “Surrender now, Scholar Song! You have no chance against me.”

“Did Young Master Gongzi send you?” Scholar Song replied coolly. At the same time, he assessed the defensive talisman on him. Its power had weakened significantly, and it could only withstand one more attack from the Sunflower Cultivator before shattering. As expected from a disciple of a major sect like the “Wuji Demon Sect,” that last strike had equaled the might of some ordinary second-tier cultivators.

“Ha! Think what you will. Don't even think about stalling for time. I've already captured the last senior you were with. You should just lie down and accept your fate!” The Sunflower Cultivator bent his body slightly, activating a low-tier magical artifact: “Rapid Gale!”

A faint blue wind began to swirl around him, dramatically increasing his speed.

In an instant, he vanished, reappearing next to Scholar Song, his dagger aimed straight for Scholar Song's abdomen. “Don't worry; I won't kill you. I still need to keep you alive...”

The speed was too fast; Scholar Song had no chance to evade.

Clang!

The talisman's energy flared again, blocking the Sunflower Cultivator's thrust.

Taking this opportunity, Scholar Song performed a roll, putting some distance between them. However, his talisman was now completely drained of energy.

The speed was overwhelming; unless he activated his sword talisman, he had no chance of winning.

“Doudou!” Scholar Song shouted. It was time for Doudou to make his grand entrance.

“Wahahaha! I knew you suddenly wanted to take me for a walk this morning just so I could help you! Don't worry; I came prepared! I brought your blade!” Doudou transmitted a mental message, then lifted a paw, sending a dark, long blade flying towards Scholar Song, landing perfectly in his grasp.

It was the famed blade, Smash!

Scholar Song clutched the treasured weapon, utterly bewildered...

What good would the blade do him?!

He had only practiced the “Fundamentals of Vajra Fist” and never learned any sword techniques! Was Doudou seeking revenge because he hadn’t praised it after it defeated that black-backed beast this morning?

But there was no time to think further.

The Sunflower Cultivator had already reappeared, his dagger spinning as it charged towards Scholar Song like a drill. If it pierced through a body, it would surely leave a gaping hole.

Now that his talisman's effect had just expired, he hadn’t even had time to activate his second life-saving measure; he absolutely could not let himself be stabbed!

Scholar Song quickly raised the blade, swinging it fiercely at the Sunflower Cultivator's dagger.

Clang!

The dagger in the Sunflower Cultivator's hand was cleaved in two by the Smash, and the unstoppable force continued to slice towards the Sunflower Cultivator's arm.

The Smash was a legendary sword technique capable of severing the flesh of fourth-tier cultivators. The dagger in the Sunflower Cultivator's hand was merely crafted from ordinary steel, and it could not withstand the blow.

The Sunflower Cultivator hastily retreated, narrowly evading the blade aimed at his arm.

He then fixed his gaze on the treasured blade in Scholar Song's hand, his eyes shining with greed—if he could seize this blade, his fighting power would soar to unimaginable heights.

Wait a minute!!

Where did this blade come from?

It seemed to have appeared out of nowhere right before his last attack, landing in the hands of this 'Scholar Song'?

The Sunflower Cultivator could not see Doudou.

But as his mind raced, a thought emerged—could it be that the 'White' cultivator was hiding nearby? Had the 'Street Office' members he'd arranged failed to delay his opponent?

If that 'White' senior was truly nearby, he wouldn’t even have a chance to escape.

“I have no choice.” The Sunflower Cultivator thought grimly. Regardless of whether that 'White' senior was hiding, he had to subdue 'Scholar Song' first if he wanted to survive!

In a split second, the Sunflower Cultivator decisively discarded the half of the dagger in his hand. Both hands engaged in a grappling maneuver—one reaching for Scholar Song's gripping hand, the other aiming for Scholar Song's throat!

Scholar Song, unwilling to back down, swung the Smash wildly at the Sunflower Cultivator. He had never trained in swordsmanship; his strikes were chaotic and uncoordinated. One moment he aimed at the Sunflower Cultivator's upper body, the next at his thigh.

The Sunflower Cultivator, wary of the blade's sharpness, dared not clash with it directly, and for a moment, he found himself unable to seize Scholar Song!

At that moment, Doudou's voice echoed in his mind: “Scholar Song, stop flailing around! Use some sword techniques!”

“I’ve never learned sword techniques!” Scholar Song silently lamented. If he had, he would have used them long ago!

Unable to capture Scholar Song, impatience began to build within the Sunflower Cultivator: this couldn’t go on!

He steeled his resolve and activated the low-tier magical artifact once more: “Rapid Gale!”

The difference in speed between fifth-tier and second-tier cultivators was already significant, but with this enhancement, the Sunflower Cultivator’s speed skyrocketed, reaching a level where Scholar Song could barely react!

However, this spell placed a heavy burden on the body, and the Sunflower Cultivator’s physique was far superior to that of his peers; he could only use it twice in one day.

This was his only chance!

With a powerful push off the ground, the Sunflower Cultivator vanished from sight.

When he reappeared, he was already behind Scholar Song!

“Got you!” The Sunflower Cultivator thought joyfully, one hand reaching for Scholar Song's hand that held the blade, while the other clutched at Scholar Song's throat!

[Eye of the Heavens Talent, Master’s Vision!] At the moment the Sunflower Cultivator activated “Rapid Gale,” Scholar Song activated his eye talent without hesitation.

He clearly saw the Sunflower Cultivator sprinting behind him. However, while his eyes perceived the movement, his body couldn't keep up.

“What now?” Scholar Song's mind raced.

As the Sunflower Cultivator's hand grew ever closer... suddenly, a familiar scene flashed in Scholar Song's mind.

Flames burning... a blade that scorches the heavens.

Scholar Song twisted his wrist, spinning the blade.

The residual power from his heart and eye surged forth.

On his finger, the ancient bronze ring began to glow slightly, activating one of its formations.

Boom~ The blade ignited in roaring flames…
