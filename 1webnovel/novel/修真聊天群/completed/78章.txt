甲符, Jianfu, Po Xiefu!

Scholar Song found a secluded spot and eagerly tore open the delivery package.

Inside the small box was a thick stack of dark yellow talisman paper, each sheet adorned with intricate runes and array diagrams painted in gleaming red-gold ink. Alongside it, there was a note from the 'Master of the Seven Lives Talisman House' explaining the functionalities of this stack of talisman paper.

There were exactly twenty sheets in total.

The top five sheets were the '甲符' (Armor Talismans), aptly named as they activated the energy within the talisman treasures to form a layer of protective armor. This armor could withstand attacks from cultivators below the third rank.

Using them was remarkably simple; one only needed to press their thumb on the center of the talisman’s array diagram, channel the talisman’s spiritual energy with their mental force, and shout the word "甲" to summon the armor.

With five talismans, each could be used only once, providing Scholar Song with protection five times if utilized wisely.

The next five were the '剑符' (Sword Talismans), clearly meant for offensive actions. Their usage was the same as the Armor Talismans; one simply needed to shout "剑" to unleash the talisman’s power.

When activated, they could manifest a sword aura powerful enough to rival a third-rank Postnatal Battle King, easily cleaving through mountains and stones. For an average second-rank True Master without special defensive abilities, being struck by this sword energy could be fatal or at least leave them severely injured.

The most numerous were the ten '破邪符' (Evil-Breaking Talismans).

According to the note from the Master of the Seven Lives Talisman House, these were essential against the evil ghostly practitioners who could command malevolent spirits to attack, making them unpredictable foes.

Ghostly entities were immune to normal physical attacks and some even possessed special abilities to become invisible and lie in wait, posing a serious challenge to cultivators lacking strength.

These ten Evil-Breaking Talismans would help Scholar Song dispel any ghostly entities he faced!

Holding the box of talismans, Scholar Song felt as if the Master of the Seven Lives Talisman House had not just thrown him a lifeline but had provided a full suite of winter clothing, food, and shelter!

"This is truly an unexpected delight," he murmured, clutching the talismans tightly.

With these treasures, he felt a surge of confidence to confront the 'Moderator' head-on. Of course, he wasn't foolish enough to charge in recklessly, talismans in hand, simply to brawl.

As long as he could deal with the Moderator, he'd employ any means necessary.

He only desired results, regardless of the methods—he just needed to eliminate his opponent!

Carefully stowing away the talismans, he felt prepared. All that was left was to await the opportune moment...

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At 7:30 AM, the sports festival at Jiangnan University Town officially kicked off.

Before the opening ceremony, there was the customary speech from the school's leadership—a truly magical occurrence, as no matter how advanced technology became, this ritual remained unchanged throughout the ages.

Typically beginning with, "Next, I will speak briefly," it would drag on through countless 'brief moments,' leaving the students in a daze, half-dead from boredom, until the festival finally commenced.

At 8:40 AM, the men's 5000-meter race began.

Surrounded by three roommates and several other close friends, Scholar Song made his way to the track.

His roommates and friends wore mischievous grins, not cheering him on, but rather eagerly anticipating how Scholar Song would struggle through the 5000-meter track, hoping to see him collapse from exhaustion or even vomit.

The 5000-meter run was a grueling affair.

A single lap measured 400 meters, requiring the competitors to run twelve and a half laps in total.

It was a thankless endeavor, lacking the exhilarating rush of a 100-meter sprint or the camaraderie of a mixed relay race. The distance was long, the pace slow; few spectators gathered, and even fewer female spectators appeared to cheer.

With the absence of female admirers, the male competitors felt even less motivation.

As the other participants took their positions, Scholar Song stood yawning, ready for the race.

"Scholar Song, go for it!" called a bright voice from the crowd. "Aim to come in first!"

The sweet voice was exceptionally pleasant to hear.

Scholar Song looked up to see Lu Fei, the girl who had taken to hanging around him lately, waving enthusiastically, her face radiating youthful joy.

She was accompanied by four other girls, likely just passing by after watching another event.

Her name should be Lu Fei, right?

Scholar Song chuckled and gave her a thumbs up.

Seizing the moment, his roommates and friends began to tease him.

Tu Bo and Gao shouted in unison, mimicking Lu Fei’s tone, "Scholar Song, go for it!"

"Aim to come in first!" the others echoed, their voices high and teasing.

Scholar Song turned back and flashed them both the middle finger, "Why don’t you guys just go die!"

At that moment, a burly classmate beside him sneered, "Heh, first place? Pretty boy, do you think you can win a 5000-meter race just on looks?"

He flexed his muscular legs—resulting from years of running—while glancing disdainfully at Scholar Song’s slender limbs, clearly doubting his ability to even run a thousand meters.

"Pretty boy? Are you talking about me?" Scholar Song asked, touching his face. Thanks to the effects of the body-enhancing liquid, his skin had indeed become a bit softer and fairer.

So, being handsome really could stir up trouble?

Scholar Song nodded to himself, then casually countered, "Are you envious of my skin?"

"…Envy your face? Why would I envy a pretty boy like you?!" The burly classmate felt his forehead throb with veins, nearly bursting from frustration.

"Haha, don’t mind him. This black guy is just jealous you have a girl cheering for you. By the way, were you also forced to compete by your classmates?" another slightly chubby classmate, obviously a homebody, asked cheerfully. "I’m Yang Shangfa from the Computer Science Department."

"Kind of, since no one else signed up for the 5000 meters, and I happened to be free, it fell to me. I’m Scholar Song," he replied with a smile.

"Looks like we’re both in the same boat," Yang Shangfa said, his eyes misty.

Just then, the teacher in charge of the starting gun said in a deep voice, "Get into position, ready—"

All the competitors got into their starting stances.

"Damn pretty boy, I’m going to show you what a 5000-meter race is all about. This time, I’ll leave you in the dust!" the burly classmate gritted his teeth.

"Leave me in the dust? A whole street length? That’s at least 800 meters, which is over two laps," Scholar Song pondered aloud, then kindly advised, "Hmm, that’s not possible. You should just give up."

"Ha!" Yang Shangfa couldn’t contain his laughter.

"……" The burly classmate nearly ground his teeth to dust.

‘Bang!’

The starting gun fired.

The burly classmate shot forward like a sprinter, his speed comparable to that of a 100-meter dash. His endurance was excellent, easily surpassing that of the average university student! In a school sports event like this, his stamina would allow him to sprint ahead, creating a significant gap that he could maintain all the way to the finish line!

"Hmph, watch me, pretty boy. Leaving you in the dust is just me being polite. If I really unleash my full strength, I could leave you behind by at least four laps!" the burly classmate thought smugly.

In a 5000-meter run, everyone needed to maintain their pace; no one would start off sprinting. Therefore, the burly classmate quickly opened up a notable distance from the other competitors.

"How’s it going, pretty boy? Feeling desperate now?" The burly classmate confidently turned back to check, expecting to see the pretty boy trailing far behind—likely choking on dust, given his delicate appearance.

However, when he turned, he was shocked to find that Scholar Song was merely one meter behind him, keeping pace without faltering!

The pretty boy was actually keeping up with him?

"Huh? Are you an idiot? Starting off at sprinting speed right behind me? With your stamina, you’ll be out of breath after one lap," the burly classmate sneered.

"Sprint?" Scholar Song looked surprised before breaking into a gentle smile. "Nope, I’m just running at a normal pace. You don’t need to worry about me. You seem quite buff, yet here you are, concerned for me."

Concerned for you, my ass! The burly classmate was furious.

"Stubborn as a dead duck! Let’s see how long you can keep this up! I hope you don’t collapse after just one lap!" The burly classmate gritted his teeth, calculating his stamina, and slightly increased his speed.

That pretty boy was clearly an amateur at long-distance running—but even so, he couldn’t allow him to surpass him. He had to shake him off and leave this pretty boy far behind!

With renewed determination, the burly classmate surged ahead.

After running nearly a hundred meters, he felt he had reached his estimated stamina limit and decided to ease up on the pace.

At this distance, he was sure he had left that amateur pretty boy far behind!

As he turned to look back, his eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets—according to the script, the pretty boy should have been left far behind, yet he was still only a meter behind him, never wavering.

It felt like a supporting character who was supposed to die but had somehow survived multiple times!

"How is this possible? Am I hallucinating?" the burly classmate murmured, stunned.
