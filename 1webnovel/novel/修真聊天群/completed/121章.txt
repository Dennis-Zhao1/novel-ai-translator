**Chapter [Insert Chapter Number]: A Moment of Sharing**

“I have half a Pill of Fasting. Want to try some?”

Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan turned her head away, clearly embarrassed to meet Scholar Song's gaze. It seemed she was out of food and water.

“Relying on others is never as good as relying on yourself,” Scholar Song thought as he rummaged through his belongings. He found a bottle with six Blood Recovery Pills, a stinky pill, several talismans, some cash, and his phone.

None of these could quench hunger, and the Blood Recovery Pills didn't help with that either.

“Hmm? What’s this…?” Finally, he felt something in his hand. 

It was a used Pill of Fasting! A few days ago, the Alchemical Sage had casually given it to him for lunch. He had only used it once and kept it since then.

Thank goodness he hadn’t mindlessly eaten it over the past few days.

With a satisfied expression, Scholar Song popped the Pill of Fasting into his mouth. Instantly, a delightful taste filled his mouth, and the gnawing hunger in his belly vanished. Feeling a slight fullness in his stomach, he took the pill out and carefully wiped off the saliva on it.

He thought to himself that this pill might save his life someday.

Gurgle, gurgle… Was that a strange noise from his stomach?

“Hmm? I’m already full, why is it still gurgling? Could it be that the Pill of Fasting has expired?” Scholar Song wondered as he rubbed his belly, feeling quite satisfied.

Gurgle, gurgle… Another round of gurgling sounds followed.

Scholar Song turned his curious gaze toward Sable Sixteen, who was said to be adept at fasting. She forcefully turned her head away again, her face flushed.

After pondering for a moment, he tentatively offered her the half Pill of Fasting he had, asking, “If you don’t mind, do you want to give it a try?”

“No need, I can fast…” Her words were cut off by another gurgling sound.

After a brief moment, Sable Sixteen gritted her teeth and said, “Our levels are different. Even if I swallowed the entire Pill of Fasting, it would only slightly alleviate my hunger.”

“Then just take it,” Scholar Song urged. He felt uneasy with her stomach constantly gurgling.

Sable Sixteen took the Pill of Fasting, thought for a moment, and said, “Once we get through this crisis, I’ll repay you tenfold for this Pill of Fasting!”

“Alright, alright.” Scholar Song replied, treating the matter lightly as if dealing with a child.

Taking a deep breath, Sable Sixteen swallowed the Pill of Fasting like she would a medicine. With this half pill in her belly, her stomach finally stopped singing its gurgling song.

Meanwhile, Scholar Song pulled out his phone and opened the chat application, intending to check the Ninefold Land One group—by now, Sable Seven should be arriving here too, and he could send a message asking for help.

However, upon opening it, he was dismayed to find that his phone had no signal at all.

“Hmm? How can there be no signal?” he mused, puzzled.

“Of course there’s no signal. If we didn't block all communications, we’d easily be discovered, and how could we treat this as a secret room?” Sable Sixteen replied.

At the same time, she glanced at Scholar Song’s phone interface and noticed a familiar group chat, exclaiming in surprise, “The Ninefold Land One group?”

“Hmm? You didn’t know? Haven’t you checked the group at all these past few days?” Scholar Song countered.

“I ran away from home… Using chat apps would expose my location. I didn’t even bring my phone, or else Sable Seven would come looking for me. That would be a hassle,” Sable Sixteen stated matter-of-factly.

No, even if you weren’t online, Sable Seven could still find you. Scholar Song silently complained, realizing that Sable Seven was likely already on her way to Jiangnan to search for her.

With no signal, he quietly shut off his phone. He didn’t plan to tell Sable Sixteen that Sable Seven was already heading towards Jiangnan to look for her—Sable Sixteen would be much safer if she was brought back home quickly.

“Have you guessed my identity? Did Sable Seven send out a message in the group asking everyone to help look for me?” Sable Sixteen suddenly asked, realizing that since Scholar Song was a new member of the Ninefold Land One group, he likely had guessed who she was.

“…” Scholar Song’s expression stiffened. He pondered whether to tell a white lie to cover this up.

“No need to deny it. You’re clearly not good at lying, and your expression has already given me the answer.” Sable Sixteen sighed.

“……” [You’re not Zhao Yaya, so don’t just read answers from other people’s expressions! That’s so rude; it leaves me with no privacy at all!]

“Are you going to tell Sable Seven about my situation here?” Sable Sixteen asked softly, hugging her knees.

“……” [I probably will, right?]

“You’re the kind of person who would definitely tell Sable Seven.” Sable Sixteen answered her own question.

[You’ve already said what I was going to say, so what else can I add?]

A heavy silence fell between them.

Long moments of silence…

Finally, Scholar Song broke the stillness by asking, “Why did you run away from the Su Clan? Wouldn’t you receive better treatment for your injuries there?”

He recalled that during the time of her Heavenly Tribulation failure, Sable Seven had mentioned in the group that Sable Sixteen had only sustained minor injuries and would recover back in the Su Clan. If that were the case, why did she escape? Why was she still going to the hospital for pain relief?

“Because… I’m dying. I estimate that in about twenty days, I’ll be dead.” Sable Sixteen spoke calmly as she hugged her knees tighter. “The various methods recorded in the Su Clan can’t heal my wounds, and Sable Seven can’t do anything either. My injuries are not just a result of the Heavenly Tribulation; there was also a mistake in my cultivation technique. That Heavenly Tribulation merely exposed my underlying injuries.”

“Let’s not talk about this topic anymore. I hate this topic.” Sable Sixteen abruptly stopped speaking and looked at Scholar Song. “You might know my name already; I’m Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan, which is both my name and my Immortal Name. What about you? You haven’t introduced yourself yet.”

“Scholar Song,” he replied.

“And your Immortal Name?” Sable Sixteen inquired.

“Immortal Name… I don’t have one yet. I’ll think of one in a few days?” Scholar Song sighed, realizing he needed to address this quickly. Otherwise, once all the elders associated him with the Immortal Name ‘Scholar Under Pressure,’ it would be hard to change it later.

“You’re supposed to come up with one yourself? Which elder are you a disciple of in the group? Didn’t your master give you an Immortal Name?” Sable Sixteen asked, puzzled. Normally, disciples formally accepted under someone would receive an Immortal Name.

Moreover, since he was the disciple who had been introduced into the Ninefold Land One group, he must have been favored by that elder. How could he not have an Immortal Name?

“Well, you see, my joining the Ninefold Land One group was a bit… coincidental,” Scholar Song scratched his head and began recounting the story of how he joined the Ninefold Land One group to Sable Sixteen.

Scholar Song spoke quietly, while Sable Sixteen listened quietly, hugging her knees.

“And that’s about it,” Scholar Song shrugged.

“You… chose to become a cultivator yourself?” Sable Sixteen raised her head slightly to look at Scholar Song, “Don’t you know the dangers of becoming a cultivator? Like—my Heavenly Tribulation, and countless other dangers!”

“I know. I was aware of your Heavenly Tribulation before I chose to become a cultivator—even saw the vast lightning of the tribulation myself,” Scholar Song replied casually.

“Then why did you still choose to become a cultivator?” Sable Sixteen’s eyes widened, staring at Scholar Song.

“Why?” Scholar Song pondered before answering, “Perhaps it’s because I’m unwilling to live an ordinary life.”

“Before becoming a cultivator, the only thing that truly brought me joy was being able to help those in need within my capacity. If I hadn’t entered the Ninefold Land One group, I might have spent an ordinary life like everyone else. However, that’s not the life I want… I’m not particularly ambitious, but I like a grand life. Even if it means facing terrifying tribulations and countless calamities brought by evil cultivators, I will never regret my choice.”

Scholar Song found it hard to articulate his feelings back then. The only thing he wanted to express was that the path of a cultivator was his irrevocable choice!

Sable Sixteen blinked, “I suddenly realize that your passionate speech is quite out of character, but… it’s interesting. Get ready; we’re about to head out.”

The pain from her injuries had faded earlier than expected. Now, she had accumulated enough true energy within her to deal with the uncle from the Celestial Farmer Sect outside!
