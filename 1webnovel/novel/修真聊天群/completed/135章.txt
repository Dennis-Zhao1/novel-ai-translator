**Bloodshed at Blue Vale (Part Three)**

Years later, within the ranks of Ninefold Land, a junior once asked Scholar Song about his first experience flying with a sword (or blade) and what that felt like.

Scholar Song's answer was a simple two-word response: "Legs weak!"

In an instant, the escape light from Su Clan's Aqi shot up into the sky, carrying him and Sable Sixteen into the air at a speed that defied description.

In the blink of an eye, they were soaring high above.

As they flew, Scholar Song felt an emptiness all around him, with only a faintly glowing escape light beneath his feet providing any semblance of safety. 

In truth, there was an invisible layer of energy shielding them from the howling winds that accompanied flying at such speeds—a precaution set up by Senior Aqi to protect both him and Sable Sixteen.

Otherwise, a powerful cultivator like Aqi wouldn’t bat an eye at such meager gusts. This was evident from the wild, explosive hairstyle of the Alchemical Sage after his long-distance flight.

However, that invisible layer of energy was neither seen nor felt, offering Scholar Song no real sense of security—if only it could morph into four guardrails, he would definitely feel more at ease.

Then, glancing down, he saw houses smaller than matchboxes, winding rivers, roads, and mountains.

So high, incredibly high!

Scholar Song felt a wave of vertigo wash over him, and his legs turned to jelly. Instinctively, he reached out and grabbed hold of Sable Sixteen. Without something to cling to, he feared he might just collapse.

"First time flying with a sword?" Sable Sixteen's dark, glimmering eyes locked onto Scholar Song.

"Hahaha." Scholar Song found even speaking a challenge.

Everyone has a bit of acrophobia, to some degree. Some might not notice it until they reach a certain height, while others may have a milder case that they can easily overcome with sheer will.

"Then take your time to conquer it. If you don’t, you won’t be able to fly with a sword in the future," Sable Sixteen encouraged, her tone tinged with sympathy.

The dream of a young man soaring through the blue skies often accompanies tears and hardships.

……

The speed of their sword flight was beyond explosive.

Based on the position described by the legless disciple from the Moon Blade Sect, Zhao Bulü, Senior Aqi quickly pinpointed their destination.

The vast Moon Blade Sect was hidden among high mountains and dense forests, shrouded by formations that concealed its presence from the mundane world.

Yet, such formations were no match for Senior Aqi's keen eyesight. He guided the escape light down in front of the Moon Blade Sect, his gaze piercing through the protective barrier.

Sable Sixteen lightly hopped down onto the ground.

Scholar Song, however, found himself collapsing to his knees, his legs utterly weak…

Senior Aqi approached the edge of the sect's protective formation and called out, "Open!"

Without even drawing his sword, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth converged at his command, forming a colossal blade that came crashing down on the protective barrier.

Crash! 

The protective formation of the Moon Blade Sect shattered like glass, splintering into countless pieces.

"Huh?" Scholar Song and Sable Sixteen looked around, only to find the sect's interior desolate, devoid of any figures.

With no one to maintain it, the protective formation had become incredibly fragile.

"Not a single soul? Did Zhao Bulü deceive us?" Sable Sixteen furrowed her brows, "He’ll be in for it when I get my hands on him!"

Scholar Song asked, "Who’s Zhao Bulü?"

"He's the one who robbed the Jiang Express delivery. After you were taken, Aqi and I visited the Jiangnan Harvest Express headquarters and managed to corner this Zhao Bulü. We got the location of the Moon Blade Sect from him," Sable Sixteen explained.

Scholar Song nodded in understanding.

At that moment, Aqi spoke up, "It's not a false report; the people of the Moon Blade Sect have moved. Moreover... it hasn’t been long since they left."

As he spoke, he stepped into the Moon Blade Sect, ascending a straight staircase with deliberate ease.

It was only then that Scholar Song and Sable Sixteen noticed a figure clad in white standing on the staircase.

With a long sword at his waist and an ethereal air, he looked like a celestial being stepped straight out of an ancient painting.

"Indeed, it’s you… Young Master Hai," Senior Aqi declared, his hands clasped behind him, gazing at the figure on the stairs.

Young Master Hai was someone Senior Aqi had encountered during an adventure in ancient immortal ruins years ago. Though he was only at the fourth grade level then, his swordsmanship was exquisite. They had once sparred, and while Aqi lost, he had gained immense respect for him.

Just days ago, upon learning that Senior Aqi was searching for medicine to heal from tribulation injuries, Young Master Hai had recommended the 'Seven Glorious Fruits' from the Immortal Farmer Sect and even accompanied him there.

If Young Master Hai was behind all this, it suddenly made sense. They had lived in close quarters for nearly a year during their adventures, and Young Master Hai had once seen him utilize the 'Heavenly Blade Burial Stars Sea' skill.

With that foundation, Young Master Hai could easily disguise himself as Senior Aqi and deceive the disciples of the Immortal Farmer Sect.

As for that 'Heavenly Blade Burial Stars Sea' technique, Young Master Hai would undoubtedly be unable to replicate it, but creating a facade of it to fool the Immortal Farmer Sect wouldn’t be difficult.

"You’ve come, Brother Aqi," the figure in white turned, revealing a handsome face and a warm, inviting smile.

Senior Aqi approached Young Master Hai step by step, "Since when did you start plotting against me?"

"Not at all. From the very beginning, I never intended to scheme against you. It just so happens that your situation perfectly fits the role I needed in my plan," Young Master Hai replied with a smile.

Without Senior Aqi, he could have sought out Wang Clan's A-Ba or Zhao Clan's A-Jiu. It would’ve been no problem at all as long as they were powerful and had someone close to them suffering from tribulation injuries.

"Hahaha, it truly reflects your character and swordsmanship," Senior Aqi laughed heartily, then turned serious, "But have you considered the outcome of your schemes against me?"

"Of course, I’ve thought it through. Everything is within my control," Young Master Hai replied, giving a thumbs up to Senior Aqi, "Don’t worry about me, Brother Aqi. Just do as you wish! Cultivators seek freedom and unrestrained existence. To live freely, do what you desire, drink what you want, and play with the women you fancy. Isn’t that what you taught me?"

"Hahaha, beautifully put!" Senior Aqi suddenly drew his sword and slashed at Young Master Hai before him.

The blade gleamed brightly, radiant like the sun, blinding anyone who dared to look!

The blade struck…

Young Master Hai was cleaved in half, crashing to the ground.

"Just like that, he’s done for?" Scholar Song wondered, surprised that such a handsome entrance led to such a swift demise.

"Not done yet. We’re leaving; we need to capture this guy's true form and offer it to my sword!" Senior Aqi said without looking back, striding towards the exit of the Moon Blade Sect.

Behind them, the cleaved Young Master Hai suddenly floated up with the wind, transforming into a paper figure cut in half.

This wasn’t a clone but merely a spell akin to a '3D virtual projection.' The paper figure was merely a medium for the spell. Young Master Hai's true self had never been present.

Sable Sixteen exclaimed in annoyance, "What on earth does Young Master Hai intend to do?"

"To sow discord, to create animosity between me and the Immortal Farmer Sect, then use me to obliterate them. That’s certainly one of his objectives. But knowing this guy, this is just his cover story for the outside world. Regardless of whether I can destroy the Immortal Farmer Sect, it doesn’t matter to him. What he truly desires… I can’t fathom," Senior Aqi grimaced.

He preferred straightforward resolutions, cutting down all grievances. He loathed those who played with tactical schemes; their hearts were too murky!

So, any plot or trick he couldn’t comprehend, he opted not to ponder.

Capturing Young Master Hai and sending him off to the afterlife with one strike was the best answer.

If he felt anger, he’d just chop him into pieces to relieve his rage.

"Where do we go now?" Scholar Song inquired.

"To find that guy," Senior Aqi gritted his teeth.

Young Master Hai had left behind a projection spell; he could follow the traces of this spell to locate him!

However, the mere thought that this might very well be a clue left intentionally by Young Master Hai made Aqi’s teeth itch.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Outside Blue Vale.

The sounds of battle roared, with various energies clashing and exploding.

This place had become a blood-soaked battleground.

The Immortal Farmer Sect had sent nearly all its elite members, attacking the Moon Blade Sect at Blue Vale with a frenzied intensity. These cultivators, who typically shied away from combat, unleashed terrifying battle prowess one after another.

While the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect suffered significant casualties, the losses for the Immortal Farmer Sect were even more devastating!

Something felt off; the sect leader of the Immortal Farmer Sect sensed a growing unease. They were determined to fight to the death, fueled by a desire to show Senior Aqi what they were made of.

But now, they hadn’t even seen a shadow of him and were ensnared in battle with the Moon Blade Sect. Soon, they were inexplicably caught in a relentless bloodbath. 

Not long after, every member of the Immortal Farmer Sect seemed to have gone mad, losing the ability to retreat, consumed only by a thirst for blood.

The sect leader vaguely sensed that a hidden formation within Blue Vale was driving the cultivators into a frenzy, inciting them to kill. They were unable to control their emotions.

The more deaths there were, the more blood spilled, the stronger the power of that hidden formation became!

But by the time the sect leader realized something was wrong, it was too late. Even he couldn’t control his own body anymore as his eyes turned crimson, his reason ebbing away.

The elite members of the Immortal Farmer Sect fell one after another, their fates uncertain. Soon, only the sect leader and five or six disciples with relatively strong spiritual energy remained, less affected by the formation.

"It’s over, all over." The sect leader sighed, knowing that the centuries-old legacy of the Immortal Farmer Sect would end with him.

Everything felt so inexplicable.

"Master!! Quick, save the sect leader!" At that moment, he heard a familiar voice calling from a distance.

Opening his eyes, he saw his eldest disciple, Zheng Neng, leading a team of Immortal Farmer Sect disciples rushing toward him.

It was Zheng Neng!

A hint of relief flickered in the sect leader's eyes…

Thud!

Just then, Ba Qianjun from the Moon Blade Sect appeared beside the sect leader, slicing through his defenses and piercing him.

"Haha," Ba Qianjun grinned, his breath laced with a foul stench.

"Thief! Don’t harm my master!" Zheng Neng shrieked, raising his hand. A wooden sword shot forth, soaring through the air to slash at Ba Qianjun…
