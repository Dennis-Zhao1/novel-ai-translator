**My Uniquely Distinct Alchemy Furnace**

After a calm final class, Scholar Song stretched lazily, putting his textbooks away.

Next to him, a curvy female classmate reluctantly departed, her gaze lingering on him. In her heart, the thought of confessing to Scholar Song resurfaced—at least during this sweltering summer, being his girlfriend would mean enjoying the luxury of a human air conditioner.

Scholar Song felt a bit uneasy under her wistful gaze, the awkwardness settling in.

Fortunately, at that moment, Tu Bo and two other roommates approached.

“Damn it, I almost melted away in this heat!” Tu Bo fanned himself with his notebook, beads of sweat cascading down his forehead. “By the way, Scholar, want to go out for a stroll this afternoon?”

“Are you guys serious about wandering around in this weather?” Scholar Song chuckled; today’s sun was particularly fierce, definitely not ideal for shopping.

“Hehe, Yang De recently developed a program and made some cash. So, he’s planning to rent a two-bedroom apartment off-campus to chill without interruptions. We’re just scouting for a good spot; who knows, it might become our second base—plus, we’re thinking of giving him a good dinner tonight,” Tu Bo said with a sly grin.

Scholar Song gave the slightly dark, thin roommate a thumbs up. “Yang De, you’re impressive! You’re way better than Tu Bo when it comes to tinkering. You can earn money, while Tu Bo can only spend it!”

Tu Bo: “…”

Yang De laughed, flashing a set of pearly white teeth. Even at a young age, he exuded the aura of a seasoned programmer, not one for much talk since he spent more time communicating through his keyboard than his mouth.

“But I’ve got something to deal with at noon—two big boxes just arrived. Once you guys find a place, give me a shout, and I’ll head over!” Scholar Song quickly replied. His roommates heading out was fantastic news; it meant he could try out his alchemy alone without interruptions.

“You sly dog, trying to mooch off dinner without lifting a finger!” Tu Bo scoffed, tilting his head back in mock disdain. “Just so you know, not a chance! But there is a window available; introduce your pretty sister to me!”

“Get lost,” Scholar Song shot back. “Not a chance! But there is a window available—treat me to supper tonight!”

Scholar Song didn't lack pretty sisters; he had several. As for the one Tu Bo was eyeing, named Fay Yu, sorry, but she wasn’t his sister.

Tu Bo immediately struck a pose as if begging for help. “Deal!”

Yang De, puzzled, wondered if they were talking about Zhao Yaya, who had dropped Scholar Song off at Jiangnan University Town during the semester's start. Had Tu Bo set his sights on Scholar Song's cousin?

That seemed quite the challenge; Zhao Yaya had an incredible kick.

Recalling the incident from the semester’s beginning when Zhao Yaya had delivered Scholar Song to the campus, they had run into a few troublemaking boys.

Soon, Tu Bo and Yang De had witnessed Zhao Yaya’s prowess. That pair of long legs had kicked up effortlessly, landing squarely on target—Zhao Yaya definitely knew how to fight, and her legendary kick had likely been used often. Those delinquents had quickly crumpled to the ground, clutching their groins and howling in pain. As an observer, it made one wince just watching.

After lunch, the three roommates wandered off, leaving Scholar Song alone.

“Whew.” He took a deep breath, the ice beads hanging around his neck keeping his mind clear—now that was a good state to be in.

He opened a small box filled with medicinal herbs and compared it to the formula for the ‘Alchemical Sage’s Essence.’

The box was neatly divided into four layers, each containing about ten types of herbs.

“Ginseng, goji berries, yangqi stone, daughter fragrance…” Scholar Song quickly checked off the first thirty herbs he could find online.

As for the morning dew dark grass and the subsequent fresh tyrant branches, as well as the nine sun red flame bamboo slices, those weren’t found online. Even if they were, they’d likely just be items or equipment from some game.

Fortunately, Fay Yu was a meticulous girl. As Scholar Song checked the herbs, he noticed they were arranged in the order prescribed by the formula, from left to right and top to bottom.

Even the quantities were pre-measured.

“Thoughtful and gentle girls are the best,” Scholar Song sighed in relief. “This saves me from consulting the Ninefold Land group.”

When refining the ‘Alchemical Sage’s Essence,’ the herbs needed to be added to the furnace in sequence. If he got the order wrong, it would all fail. If the materials Fay Yu had sent were all mixed up, Scholar Song would have been in trouble.

“Follow the formula ratios, add the herbs to the furnace one by one, and simmer for about five minutes before adding new herbs. Pay attention to the heat! Repeat until the liquid turns into a paste. The finished essence should be black, transparent, and pungent.” Those were the Alchemical Sage’s exact words.

It sounded simple enough; it seemed anyone could concoct the liquid as long as they were careful, right?

Indeed, the Alchemical Sage’s Essence was merely the most basic ‘elixir,’ not even worthy of being called a potion or herbal residue. It didn’t require the consumption of one’s spiritual power or true energy, nor did it need special earth fire, heavenly fire, or alchemical fire.

Even an ordinary person, as long as they focused, could concoct it!

But success wasn’t so easily achieved.

The key was the timing, and the “five minutes” meant that it wasn’t a fixed duration; it needed the alchemist to adjust based on their experience and the quality of the herbs.

Moreover, the entire concoction comprised forty-five herbs, taking nearly four hours, requiring intense concentration without the slightest distraction. For an ordinary person to concoct this ‘Essence,’ immense willpower and experience were essential.

Scholar Song opened the hotpot and tossed the sliced ginseng into it.

“By the way, does the formula mention if I need to add water?” Scholar Song scratched his head.

They should need water, right? If not, the ginseng slices would surely burn to a crisp after five minutes!

But how much water should he add?

“Should I just ask the group?” Scholar Song pulled out his phone, but after some thought, he calmly put it back down.

This was his first time trying to concoct the Alchemical Sage’s Essence; he would undoubtedly encounter many questions along the way. He couldn’t just start boiling the herbs and dash to the group every time he faced a problem, could he?

Not everyone in the group was online all the time. If he kept asking every time an issue arose, by the time he got a response, it might already be past five minutes, and he would have failed. At that point, the thirty-two sets of herbs wouldn’t be enough for him to mess around with.

So, he had better approach this with the mindset of inevitable failure and attempt it according to the Alchemist’s formula. Then, he would record all the issues encountered during the process and ask the group everything at once.

“Let’s pour in a scoop of water first.” He added a scoop of water to the pot and pressed the button on the induction cooker.

The induction cooker… was an unavoidable choice.

Because the school dormitory had no open flames, and to prevent fires, all sources of fire were prohibited. Having an induction cooker was already a great luxury.

Since it was all about heating and simmering, heating with electricity should be just fine, right?

Then he selected the ‘soup’ option. The induction cooker provided four settings: ‘stir-fry, boil, stew, fry.’ Plus, it had a feature to adjust the temperature freely.

If ‘cultivation’ really existed, he would undoubtedly be the first person in history to use an induction cooker and hotpot for alchemy. Scholar Song thought to himself, chuckling at the absurdity.
