**The Master’s Way of Pushing Open the Door**

June 4, Night.

Scholar Song was wide awake, unable to sleep a wink.

Perhaps it was the excitement of meeting the ‘Alchemical Sage’ from the group the very next day. He was looking forward to learning the basics of meditation and the body-refining sword technique, embarking on a hundred-day foundation-building journey. The anticipation was almost unbearable.

Or maybe it was due to the body-forging liquid he had consumed, which had enhanced his physical capabilities, reducing his need for sleep compared to before. Whatever the reason, he simply could not find rest.

His three roommates were already deep in slumber, while he tossed and turned in bed.

Even with his eyes closed, his mind was racing, fully alert.

He felt he had been lying there with his eyes shut for ages, so he checked his phone, only to realize that less than five minutes had passed.

“This is unbearable,” Scholar Song sighed.

……

……

June 5, Sunny, and still hot.

After a sleepless night, Scholar Song felt a bit sluggish, but it wasn't the kind of fatigue that stemmed from lack of sleep—physically, he felt fine. In fact, he didn’t feel the slightest hint of drowsiness despite being awake all night.

However, the weariness of eighteen years of ordinary life made him feel mentally drained, as if he had partied all night long without rest.

He had four classes in the morning, and he made sure to bring his phone. This time, he fully charged it, ensuring that he wouldn't miss any communication from the Alchemical Sage.

As he hoped, the first two classes flew by—yet the Alchemical Sage still hadn’t reached out to him.

The agonizing wait, filled with hope, made every minute feel like an eternity, making it impossible for Scholar Song to concentrate.

The third class was English.

During the break, Professor Smith arrived early, leaning on his cane.

This meticulous old man would never tolerate tardiness from his students, and even less so from himself. He was strict with others but even stricter with himself.

Rumor had it that he had been hospitalized three days prior after being bitten by his beloved dog. After being discharged the night before, he had promptly sent that same dog to a butcher for hotpot.

Was this the lesson that love can hurt even more when it comes from someone you cherish?

Scholar Song looked at the meticulously groomed British professor and felt a pang of guilt.

According to Fay Yu, she had already compensated the poor Professor Ren Shui and Professor Smith after the incident, but Scholar Song hadn’t inquired about the specifics of that compensation.

“What a pity, I thought Professor Smith would stay in the hospital longer!” Tuba shuddered upon seeing him.

His English grades were not the best, and with Professor Smith's strict demeanor, he found himself at a loss on how to navigate the class.

“I need to change my position; I’ll move a bit further away. What about you, Scholar Song?” Tuba asked.

“Same, I’ll shift too,” Li Yangde nodded quietly.

Unlike Tuba, who struggled with English, Li Yangde excelled in the subject. He had already mastered the key points discussed in class, allowing him to slip to the back and focus on the programming project he was working on.

“I’m going to accompany Ya Yi as well; I’ll move too,” the last roommate, Gao Moumou, adjusted his glasses and smiled.

Gao Moumou’s name was quite ordinary, and like Tuba, he harbored resentment towards his name. He once even tried to sneakily change it at the police station when he was young, but to no avail. Unfortunately, he was still called Gao Moumou.

He had paid a heavier price than Tuba for his name change attempt; while Tuba only faced a stern lecture from his father, Gao Moumou had to endure the wrath of both his parents, leaving him in tears and unable to get out of bed the next day.

The "Ya Yi" he mentioned was his girlfriend, a petite girl standing at only one meter forty-three, quite adorable. Scholar Song often wondered how Gao Moumou had the nerve to date someone so young-looking. She could easily pass for a middle school student, or even a primary school one. Aside from those with a particular preference, it was hard to see how any normal man would find interest in someone with that appearance.

“Isn’t this a bit much? Everyone’s moving?” Scholar Song sighed, starting to pack his books to accompany his roommates.

Just then, Tuba grinned and held him back, “Scholar Song, you should stay and be a good student and listen to the class.”

“?” Scholar Song looked puzzled, not understanding Tuba's intent.

“Seize the opportunity! Didn’t you always say you wanted to find a girlfriend in college?” Li Yangde whispered in Scholar Song’s ear, raising his eyebrows suggestively.

“No need to thank us; just call us your active benefactors,” Gao Moumou added coolly.

With that, the three roommates left one after another, leaving Scholar Song bewildered.

After a moment, he turned to see that the girl with an alluring figure was sitting just one seat away from him. As soon as she caught his gaze, her eyes narrowed into a playful smile.

These three must have misunderstood something, right?

……

……

Meanwhile, the three roommates had squeezed to the back of the classroom.

Tuba wiped the sweat from his forehead, “What the hell, why is it so hot? It was perfectly cool just a moment ago!”

“Are you really that oblivious?” Gao Moumou pushed his glasses up, channeling his inner detective. “It’s because we’re away from Scholar Song now.”

“What does that have to do with Scholar Song? Can he control the weather?” Tuba scoffed, waving his book in mockery.

Gao Moumou replied cryptically, “He can’t control the weather, but for some reason, it feels like Scholar Song emits a cool aura, like a walking air conditioner. I almost doubted if he was carrying around a block of ice.”

“Now that you mention it, it does feel that way. By the way, did you notice how Scholar Song has gotten a lot whiter? He didn’t look this pale yesterday morning, did he? We’ve been out searching for a place for so long, and he’s turned white as a ghost?” Li Yangde closed his tablet, speaking casually.

“Yangde, you’re not developing feelings for him, are you? Noticing something like Scholar Song’s skin turning white?” Tuba teased in a silly tone.

“Shut it, Tuba,” Li Yangde smirked. “Do you still want the hidden ‘study videos’ on your F drive and the other five virtual drives?”

“Yangde, I’m sorry!” Tuba immediately backpedaled, knowing those were the treasures he had accumulated over three years of high school. Wait, how did Yangde know about his five virtual drives? This was a violation of privacy! You can’t mess with program nerds.

“I think he might have used some skin-whitening cream. As for the makeup reason... it’s probably because he’s in love,” Gao Moumou continued with his cryptic analysis, pointing at Scholar Song and the girl, “I bet a hundred bucks... they’re definitely involved in something. I’ve noticed that throughout all the courses yesterday, Lu Fei would always find an opportunity to sit next to Scholar Song.”

“Looks like giving them some private space was indeed the right choice.”

“When it works out, Scholar Song will definitely treat us to a meal.”

The three of them nodded in agreement, feeling a sense of pride for being discreet benefactors.

……

……

Unfortunately, the reality was far from their idealistic assumptions.

Scholar Song had no intention of pursuing a relationship with the girl. Instead, his mind was preoccupied with thoughts of cultivation, basic meditation techniques, and the hundred-day foundation-building process.

As Professor Smith wrote a series of words on the blackboard, the classroom was silent. Though the room was equipped with high-tech teaching aids, the elderly professor preferred the traditional blackboard.

In this quiet classroom, students who didn’t enjoy his class were free to doze off, as he didn’t force anyone to pay attention. However, if anyone dared to make noise and disturb his lecture, they could forget about passing the class.

Since college students had chosen to attend, they were there for the credits. Nobody wanted to jeopardize their credit scores, so dozing off was a fair compromise.

Suddenly, loud crashing noises broke the silence, echoing sharply in the stillness of the classroom.

All eyes turned toward the source of the commotion—the classroom door.

The previously locked door appeared to be under immense pressure, the screws coming loose from the wooden frame.

With a sharp crack, the lock burst open.

It was as if someone outside had used a battering ram to smash it open, sending the entire lock flying. The scene was nothing short of dramatic!
