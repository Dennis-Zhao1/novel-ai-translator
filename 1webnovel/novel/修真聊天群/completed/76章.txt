**Chapter: The Master of the Seven Lives Talisman**

After Scholar Song left, Jiang Ziyan's figure appeared on the rooftop of the wedding photo studio.

She dialed the Alchemical Sage's number and lazily said, “Alchemical Sage, Scholar Song has returned safely.”

“Also, Alchemical Sage, I want to make it clear that I will never give up. Stop thinking you can push me away—it’s useless.” With that, she hung up before the Alchemical Sage could respond.

“I will get what I want,” Jiang Ziyan murmured to herself.

With a leap from the rooftop, she arrived at the site where the long-armed man’s remains had been disposed of by Scholar Song. She formed a hand sign and cast a small spell to erase all traces of what had happened here.

Scholar Song had done well, but to some skilled trackers among the cultivators, there would still be signs left behind. Jiang Ziyan was here to eliminate those signs.

These experiences would be grasped by Scholar Song once his strength increased, so it was nothing to worry about.

After safely returning Zhao Yaya, Scholar Song also brought some food and drinks for his roommate along the way.

Back at the dorm, he lay on his bed. The ‘true self’ in his mind dissipated, and the experience of slaying the long-armed man replayed in his mind again and again.

There was a sense of lingering fear, some discomfort, and a thrill… much like the joy he felt when helping others.

His three roommates were still shouting and having fun gaming.

After resting for a moment, Scholar Song pulled out the beast head token from his pocket. He then took a picture of it with his phone and sent it to the Ninefold Land group chat.

He followed up with a question in the group: “Elders, does anyone recognize this token? What sect does it belong to?”

Not long after posting, a reply came from one of the elders.

The first to respond was the ever-reliable Hermit of North River: “I haven’t seen it, nor have I heard of anything like it. It’s probably some insignificant small sect from a corner somewhere?”

Upon hearing this, Scholar Song felt a sense of certainty—after all, the Hermit of North River was the group's know-it-all, fully aware of each member's circumstances. If he hadn’t heard of it, it meant that the organization represented by the beast head token likely wasn’t affiliated with any of the elders in the group.

Scholar Song had been worried that the beast head token belonged to someone in the group, which would complicate things.

“Senior Song, is the organization represented by this token significant?” Fay Yu, surprisingly still online, asked. Ever since returning to Lingdie Island, she had been diligently practicing every night without fail.

“It’s quite important to me personally,” Scholar Song replied.

“Then I’ll ask my dad about it,” Fay Yu said excitedly before quickly logging off to find the Lingdie Elder.

The Hermit of North River inquired further, “Are they friend or foe?”

“They are foes,” Scholar Song replied succinctly.

The Hermit of North River replied, “Can you deal with them? Do you need assistance?”

Scholar Song responded, “I’m currently tracking their whereabouts and have some clues. If it gets too tough, I will seek help from the elders.”

“Is the Alchemical Sage still with you?” The Hermit of North River asked, a hint of concern in his voice. After all, Scholar Song had just started out and was still quite weak.

“The Alchemical Sage is still here; he might stay for a few more days.”

“That’s good,” the Hermit of North River said, visibly relieved.

At that moment, Fay Yu returned and logged back in: “Senior Song, my dad doesn’t know what this token is either. It must be from some small sect that doesn’t hold much significance. By the way, I’ll finish the spirit contract array tomorrow, and then I can help you take down this small sect! It’ll be a great way to test the new spirit’s power!”

With Fay Yu’s cheerful message, Scholar Song’s mood brightened significantly. “Thank you.”

“After we take down that small sect, Senior, we should head to the East Sea to search for the mysterious island. I’ve heard that someone discovered a legendary ‘mysterious island floating in the air’ there, where it’s said that the sounds of birds and fragrant flowers can be heard, overflowing with spiritual energy, and even extinct creatures are said to exist there. It’s bound to be thrilling!” Fay Yu’s imagination seemed to run wild.

The Wild Blade of Three Tides logged on and, seeing the situation, couldn’t help but critique, “However, Miss Fay Yu, you need to finish the spirit contract first!”

Fay Yu’s warship was sunk with a single shot.

“We’ll finish the spirit contract tonight!” the long-legged girl exclaimed.

With that, she quickly logged off—perhaps to struggle with the spirit contract formation.

The Hermit of North River sent a smiley face and added, “Speaking of which, does anyone want to team up to check out that mysterious island near the East Sea?”

As soon as the Hermit finished his sentence, many lurking elders in the group began to surface, discussing forming a team for the mysterious island dungeon.

The chat became lively.

Scholar Song scrolled through his phone screen, a smile unconsciously appearing at the corners of his mouth.

Ding ding ding.

At that moment, someone suddenly private messaged Scholar Song.

He opened it to find it was Fay Yu, who had logged off earlier.

“Senior Song, did something happen today? You seem a bit off,” she asked with concern.

Off? Scholar Song was puzzled and scrolled through his chat history but couldn’t find anything odd in his words.

He scratched his head—did she really notice that he was in a different state today? Was it that mysterious sixth sense women supposedly had?

“If you’re asking if something happened, I did kill someone today,” Scholar Song thought for a moment and typed, “I personally cut off his head with a sword, watching it fly away. Looking back now… it feels unreal, like a dream.”

For some reason, after typing this out, Scholar Song felt a release, as if a heavy stone had been lifted from his chest.

“Is it your first time taking a life? Do you regret it?” Fay Yu quickly replied—she recalled how, after her first time acting, her father, the Lingdie Elder, had comforted her.

She didn’t know how to console others, but she could replicate how her father comforted her back then. Learning by doing!

“I don’t regret it,” Scholar Song firmly typed those three words. Even if time turned back, he would still decisively swing that sword!

“I see your resolve and the conviction behind your strike. Senior Song, don’t dwell too much on the trivial matters. Right now, just remember why you swung your sword and stay true to that belief. As long as your conviction is firm and correct, it is a choice without regret. Don’t put pressure on yourself; I’ll always be here to support you,” Fay Yu said gently.

As she typed this, her face glowed with a hint of the divine.

“Thank you.” Scholar Song’s face revealed a soft smile. Fay Yu’s comforting words felt a bit awkward, making him feel like he was talking to an elder. But he truly appreciated her kindness.

“You’re welcome, Senior. I’m off to tackle the contract array now! Once I finish, I’ll seek you out for the mysterious island adventure!” Fay Yu said happily before logging off.

She was thrilled to be able to help Scholar Song.

Meanwhile, in a corner of Lingdie Island.

The Lingdie Elder was staring at the conversation between his daughter and Scholar Song on his phone, having fainted in the restroom.

The Elder was secretly logging into his daughter’s account again—what a scandal!

……

……

Around three in the morning.

Scholar Song had long fallen asleep, but his spiritual energy intermittently awakened—this was a natural instinct to keep his spiritual power alert. After maintaining the ‘alert’ technique throughout the day, his body had developed a habit. Thus, even in sleep, his body would occasionally activate his spiritual energy to stay vigilant.

He wasn’t even aware of it himself.

In a daze, Scholar Song heard his phone ringing.

He quickly opened his eyes and silenced it to avoid disturbing his sleeping roommates. Then, he picked up his phone to check the caller ID.

It was an unfamiliar number, the area code indicating it was from Huaxi.

Could it be a scam call? Scholar Song instinctively pressed the answer button—bantering with scammers was something he and his roommates enjoyed.

Especially Li Yangde, who, like all programmers, was a classic introvert with a flair for voice pranks. Whenever he encountered a female scammer, his combat power would triple, leaving the scammers in tears.

“Is this Book Mountain Pressure Road friend?” A young man's voice came from the other end of the line.

Not a scammer—“Book Mountain Pressure Road” was his chat nickname, combined with the term “friend,” indicating this was a senior from the Ninefold Land group?

Scholar Song rubbed his eyes and quickly became alert. “Hello, this is he.”

“Young friend, are you sleeping? I’ll keep it brief,” the young voice chuckled. “I’m the Master of the Seven Lives Talisman from the Ninefold Land group. I got your number through the Alchemical Sage. I mainly wanted to ask about the beast head token you posted in the group tonight.” 

“Do you have information about that organization, Elder?” Scholar Song fully woke up.
