**Chapter Translation**

Today is definitely my lucky day!

What to do now?

Scholar Song felt troubled—he could only seek help from the seniors in the Ninefold Land One group.

He pulled out his phone, opened the Ninefold Land One group chat, and began to organize his thoughts in his mind, pondering how to describe what had just happened and ask the seniors for a solution.

Just as he was about to type in the chat box, a message popped up from his friend list.

It was from a user named Three-Day Little Monk, a lay disciple of Master Tongxuan.

Last time, he had remotely sent Scholar Song a compressed package containing three techniques: "Mental Branding Technique," "Branding Sensation Method," and "Temporary Sword Control Technique."

Though it was likely a transmission error on Three-Day’s part, he was grateful for the "Temporary Sword Control Technique," which had helped him successfully deal with several assassins trying to kill Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan.

“Scholar, are you there?” Three-Day Little Monk asked.

“Yes, I’m here. Is there something you need, Three-Day Brother?” Scholar Song quickly responded.

“I heard you were asking in the Ninefold Land One group about how to seal a Ghost General?” Three-Day Little Monk inquired. Although he wasn’t a member of the group, he could gather some information through his connections with Master Tongxuan.

“Did you have a method to seal the Ghost General, Three-Day Brother?” Scholar Song said with a bitter smile. “But it’s too late. I already killed it.”

“What a pity…” Three-Day Little Monk said, clearly pained. He then asked, “Scholar, can I ask where you encountered this Ghost General? Where there’s a Ghost General, there should be many other vengeful spirits and ghost soldiers, right? There can’t be just one Ghost General, can there?”

Recently, Three-Day had been practicing a Buddhist technique that required him to collect many ghosts and seal them in a pagoda. He would then chant scriptures to gradually purify these spirits, transforming them into pure souls. Finally, with these pure souls, he could refine the pagoda.

Once the pagoda was complete, paired with the "Buddha's Passage Pagoda" technique, he would be able to suppress enemies with a single strike. Its power rivaled the Daoist "Universe in One Sleeve" spell.

However, in this day and age, while it might still be possible to find single vengeful spirits, finding a large batch of them was quite challenging. The Middle Land had enjoyed peace for many years without major wars.

Locations that had previously experienced great conflicts had long been quietly purified by senior cultivators; most of the vengeful spirits there had already been captured.

So, upon learning that Scholar Song had captured a ghost soldier, he excitedly approached him to inquire.

“I’m not entirely sure… but there should be quite a few souls appearing here. As for whether there are still Ghost Generals, I can’t say, but there should be no shortage of ghost soldiers, and there will likely be even more vengeful spirits,” Scholar Song quickly replied.

“Really? Where are you right now?” Three-Day Brother asked excitedly.

Scholar Song replied, “In the Luo Xin District of J City.”

“Ha ha! That’s not far from me. Wait for me. If I fly on my sword, I’ll be there in an hour at most!” Three-Day Brother said before going silent.

Scholar Song held his phone tightly… It seemed like the trouble he had stirred up might just have a solution?

He felt a bit lucky after all!

……

……

Next, Scholar Song called Tupo, telling him he wanted to explore the village thoroughly and might be back a bit late to avoid worrying Tupo and the others, who might otherwise come looking for him and get caught up in the mess.

Now he just hoped that Three-Day Brother could arrive before the vengeful spirit army attacked.

I hope I have good luck today! Scholar Song silently prayed in his heart.

In fact… Scholar Song was indeed having a good day.

About forty-five minutes later, a streak of sword light swooped down from the sky right in front of him. Above the light stood a bronzed-skinned man who gracefully leaped down from the glimmering light.

The man was strikingly handsome, the kind of healthy good looks that could not be diminished even by his shiny bald head.

“Scholar!” the man smiled at Scholar Song. No need to say, he was definitely Three-Day Brother, the lay disciple of Master Tongxuan.

“Hello, Three-Day Brother!” Scholar Song finally felt a heavy stone lift from his heart, relieved.

With Three-Day Brother around, even if a horde of vengeful spirits attacked, he wouldn’t be afraid! Three-Day Brother was a highly skilled disciple of Buddhism, most adept at dealing with ghostly beings.

However, wasn’t Three-Day Brother a lay disciple? Why did he shave his head?

“This place is thick with ghostly energy,” Three-Day Brother commented, turning his head to take a look, slightly squinting his eyes and nodding in satisfaction.

He had thought that when Scholar Song mentioned a “considerable number of vengeful spirits,” there would be at most a hundred. But looking at the dense aura of Yin energy enveloping the village, it seemed there were likely thousands of ordinary low-tier vengeful spirits! Among such a massive number of vengeful spirits, there were bound to be several ghost soldiers, and perhaps even a Ghost General!

“Good, good, good!” Three-Day Brother exclaimed three times in a row. “Scholar, I don’t even know how to thank you. You’ve really helped me a lot!”

Scholar Song chuckled in response, “Haha, you’ve also helped me tremendously, Brother.”

“You don’t have to say anything. The number of vengeful spirits here far exceeds my expectations. Once I capture all these vengeful spirits, I must give you a nice gift to show my gratitude!” Three-Day Brother patted Scholar Song’s shoulder enthusiastically.

If he captured all the spirits here, he would almost be able to return and begin cultivating his “Buddha’s Passage Pagoda” technique right away, saving him a tremendous amount of time.

This was a significant favor; if he didn’t give Scholar Song something good, wouldn’t he be laughed at by his peers? The cultivators in the Ninefold Land One group never skimped on gifts for their junior brethren, especially for those they had a karmic connection with.

Thinking of this, Three-Day Brother made a phone call.

“Master, I want to pass on the ‘Immovable Diamond Body’ technique to Scholar Song and do him a favor. What do you think?” Three-Day Brother asked over the phone.

There was a brief silence on the other end, followed by the steady sound of wood fish being tapped three times.

“Alright, thank you, Master,” Three-Day Brother said with a smile.

He then clapped Scholar Song on the back. “Little Friend Scholar, you’re still living with Venerable White, right?”

Scholar Song nodded; Venerable White had just gone to retrieve his flying sword but would be back soon.

“Then in a few days, when you return home, let Venerable White set the coordinates for me. At that time, I’ll send the ‘Immovable Diamond Body’ technique to you via my flying sword. No need to refuse; it’s what you deserve,” Three-Day Brother said.

“The ‘Immovable Diamond Body’? What kind of technique is that?” Scholar Song instinctively touched his head at the mention of Buddhist techniques. After all, he had finally selected the “Gentleman’s Journey” to alter his ‘True Self’ appearance, and he didn’t want to revert back.

“You’ve been practicing the ‘Basic Diamond Fist Technique,’ right? The ‘Immovable Diamond Body’ is an auxiliary technique for the ‘Basic Diamond Fist Technique.’ It’s not a fist technique but rather a first-tier body refining technique that enhances physical defense. It pairs well with the basic fist technique, allowing you to more easily break through to the first-tier Leap Dragon Gate!” Three-Day Brother laughed heartily.

“Thank you, Brother!” As soon as Scholar Song heard it was an auxiliary technique for the Basic Diamond Fist, he knew he had to accept the ‘Immovable Diamond Body.’

Even if it meant his ‘True Self’ might turn bald as a result... it was more important to prioritize strength over appearance. At worst, once he advanced to the first-tier realm, he could switch to practicing Confucian techniques and alter his ‘True Self’ appearance anew!

But truly, today was going smoothly; not only had he effortlessly resolved the “vengeful spirit revenge” issue, but he had also obtained a first-tier auxiliary body refining technique from Three-Day Brother.

What a stroke of luck!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Half an hour later…

Above the Luo Xin District, a thick black cloud rolled in, low and ominous, bearing down on the village.

Ordinary people couldn’t see this cloud, but those with innate spiritual sight or those who had opened their spiritual eyes could see that the swirling cloud was filled with hundreds of vengeful spirits howling and screeching.

They emitted chilling cries… countless cold powers spread out. Anyone standing beneath this ghostly cloud would feel an inexplicable chill all over their body.

And above these hundreds of low-tier vengeful spirits stood nearly twenty ghost soldiers. They wore ancient armor, wielding various ancient weapons, and all wore horrifying masks, looking cruel and evil.

Above the twenty ghost soldiers stood a Ghost General adorned in exquisite chain mail, wielding a large saber! He too wore a ghostly mask… and unlike the Ghost General Scholar Song had slain, this one was filled with ghostly energy and was no longer in a weakened state! His strength was comparable to a peak second-tier cultivator.

“Tsk tsk, I’ve hit the jackpot. Just these vengeful spirits are enough for my cultivation! Moreover, it looks like there are even more souls behind them. The more grieving spirits there are, the faster my technique will be refined!” Three-Day Brother rubbed his hands together, excitement shining in his eyes.

Scholar Song patted his chest, immensely grateful—thank goodness Three-Day Brother contacted him in time! Thank goodness he was nearby in J City! Thank goodness Three-Day Brother had rushed over!

If Three-Day Brother had arrived half an hour later, facing this horde of over a thousand vengeful spirits, Scholar Song would have been at a loss and unable to manage.

What incredible luck, Scholar Song thought inwardly.

“Kill, kill, kill! Slaughter all living beings here!” The Ghost General waved his large saber angrily. They had learned of their companion’s death and had come for revenge.

Let all living beings in the village pay for the life of the Fourth Brother! The Ghost General coldly commanded.

The ghost soldiers shouted in unison, dispersing to lead their respective vengeful spirit teams, slowly surrounding and enveloping the entire village.

Then, the ghost soldiers led the vengeful spirits, charging down like a tidal wave toward the living beings in the village. Whether human or livestock, any being with life energy was their target.

“Hahaha, this is great!” Three-Day Brother laughed heartily, reaching behind him to pull out a rod wrapped in long cloth.

When the rod was unfurled, it transformed into a black flag. The flag was made of an unknown material; it felt soft like fabric yet gleamed like metal.

Once the flag was unfurled, it conjured a gigantic black hole. Then… the countless vengeful spirits and twenty ghost soldiers all screamed in terror as they were sucked into this black hole.
