**Cultivator Madman Bai Zhenjun!**

As Young Master Yi led his sixty strong men, they worked together efficiently, each knowing their role.

Ten burly men approached the statue, ready to dig up the ‘Nameless Immortal Lord Statue.’

First, four of them lifted a massive cloth cover, tossing it high into the air to shroud the ‘Nameless Immortal Lord Statue’!

This was meant to prevent the men from being influenced by the statue's overwhelming allure during the lifting process.

Next, six more men prepared their ropes, just waiting for the statue to be excavated so they could lift it out.

Finally, another big guy drove a ‘high-lift truck’ to the temple entrance.

The rest of the men spread out, rudely pushing away the worshippers, preventing anyone from approaching the Nameless Temple!

Everything was set.

“Remember, don’t look at the statue! Move quickly; we need to have it out of here in ten minutes!” Young Master Yi shouted from the back.

After the four men tossed the cloth cover, their eyes glazed over — despite Young Master Yi's prior warning, the moment they looked up to throw the cover, they were deeply captivated by the perfect ‘Nameless Immortal Lord Statue.’

In that instant, thoughts of seizing the statue for themselves surged in their minds!

Young Master Yi rushed forward and kicked one of the dazed men, “Get out there and block those worshippers!”

The four men, still entranced, stumbled out to stop the worshippers.

Outside, the worshippers were already in an uproar.

“What are you scoundrels doing?!”

“Thieves! They’re trying to steal the Immortal Lord Statue!”

“This is illegal! Get out of here! Don’t let them take the statue!”

“Take these guys down!”

Angry shouts erupted as worshippers picked up bricks and bottles to throw at the men.

The burly men were not gentle souls; they grinned wickedly and swung their fists at the worshippers.

“Call the police! Someone call the police!” one worshipper cried, having been knocked to the ground, pulling out his phone.

In an instant, the worshippers flooded the police with calls.

— The scene was chaotic.

Young Master Yi glanced outside with a cold snort, “Don’t worry about the worshippers; hurry up!”

Soon, the statue transformed from Bai Zhenjun was uprooted by the ten strong men.

Nearby, the six men who had been ready quickly tied the statue with ropes, lifted it, and placed it onto the ‘high-lift truck.’

The truck roared to life, transporting the Nameless Immortal Lord Statue toward a waiting truck behind.

The worshippers, unable to break through the men’s blockade, could only watch helplessly as the statue was taken away, their curses and shouts echoing throughout the Nameless Temple!

……

……

Meanwhile, Scholar Song had finally dragged Dou Dou away from his computer and brought him to the Nameless Temple.

At that moment, Bai Zhenjun's voice came through the ‘Long-Distance Sound Transmission Flute’: “Song Dao Friend, your people are really efficient. They’re about to take me out of the Nameless Temple… But you know, as cultivators, we need to accumulate virtue. Sometimes, we shouldn’t be too aggressive. Those worshippers outside are innocent; you should tell your subordinates to go easy on them and not seriously hurt them!”

“What?” Scholar Song was confused; he was still on his way to the Nameless Temple, so where did the help come from? “Bai Zhenjun, someone already dug you out of the Nameless Temple?”

“Yeah, I’m now in a vehicle that looks like a horse cart. Wait, could it be… are these people not the ones you hired?” Bai Zhenjun asked.

“My hired help is still on the way to the Nameless Temple—I haven’t even seen the place yet!” Scholar Song chuckled bitterly, wondering who was trying to dig up Bai Zhenjun.

“Oh, that makes sense. Anyone chosen by the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain wouldn’t be so brutal. If they’re not your people, then I can relax,” Bai Zhenjun laughed lightly.

“I’ll come to get you right away.” Scholar Song said—if Bai Zhenjun was taken away, he would have no face to meet the seniors in their group.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. This way, we won’t have to drive away the worshippers ourselves. Once these folks take me to a quiet place, I’ll come out of the statue,” Bai Zhenjun said nonchalantly, still chuckling.

“Alright… I’ll follow behind you. The moment you come out of the statue, I’ll be there to assist you,” Scholar Song replied.

Using the ‘Long-Distance Sound Transmission Flute,’ he could track Bai Zhenjun’s location and follow at a distance.

“Let’s keep in touch then,” Bai Zhenjun said cheerfully.

……

……

“Did you just talk to Bai Zhenjun?” Dou Dou asked. “What happened?”

“Bai Zhenjun has been dug out,” Scholar Song rubbed his temples.

“What?” Dou Dou’s expression was one of disbelief. He had never heard of a closed-off cultivator being dug out!

“I should’ve realized earlier. The statue Bai Zhenjun transformed into has an irresistible allure that mere mortals can’t resist. Under that influence, some guys would definitely risk everything to seize the statue,” Scholar Song sighed.

But this worked out; it saved him the trouble of driving away the worshippers from the ‘Nameless Temple.’ Now, he just needed to retrieve Bai Zhenjun from whoever had taken the statue!

As they spoke, Scholar Song passed by a mask shop. “How much for the masks? Boss!”

“Five bucks each, made from reinforced plastic, durable,” the shop owner smiled.

“I’ll take a Ultraman mask.” Scholar Song fished out some change.

He might just need it when he went to pick up Bai Zhenjun later.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Young Master Yi’s subordinates worked quickly, loading the ‘Nameless Immortal Lord Statue’ onto the truck in under ten minutes.

“GO! Move out!” Young Master Yi shouted.

Over sixty subordinates swiftly retreated, climbing onto the truck, and in the blink of an eye, they vanished from sight.

All that remained were the furious worshippers, stomping their feet in anger outside the Nameless Temple!

“Where are the police? Why haven’t they arrived?” one bruised worshipper yelled.

“It doesn’t work that fast. It takes a while to process a call, and if there happens to be a patrol car nearby, it’ll still take at least ten minutes to get to the ‘Nameless Temple,’” someone grumbled.

“Did anyone get it on camera? We need to post these shameless scoundrels’ faces online for everyone to see!”

“The lighting’s too dim; the photos are all blurry!”

Just then… two more trucks pulled up at the entrance of the Nameless Temple.

A young man jumped down from one of the trucks.

Forty burly men climbed down from the cargo truck. “Young Master Yu, is this the place?”

“This is it! Let’s go! Dig up the Nameless Immortal Lord Statue! Remember, don’t look at the statue!” Young Master Yu said with determination.

The forty burly men charged toward the Nameless Temple.

As they ran halfway, they felt something was off; the worshippers were looking at them as if they were a bunch of clowns, most calmly pulling out their phones to record the scene.

Although the forty men felt puzzled, their mission took precedence. Young Master Yu had spent a lot of money; money talks! The fact that the worshippers weren’t stopping them made it even easier!

They stormed into the Nameless Temple, where three men raised a large cloth, preparing to cover the statue.

But once they entered, they froze in shock.

Huh? Where’s the statue?

The promised Nameless Immortal Lord Statue had left nothing but a hole behind!

“Damn it!” Young Master Yu shouted furiously, “Someone got here first! Which bastard dared to steal it before me?”

Just as Young Master Yu was fuming, the sound of screeching brakes echoed outside the Nameless Temple.

This time, two large trucks pulled up.

Fifty men in black suits jumped down, all equally burly and imposing.

Then, a young woman stepped out of the truck, her voice dripping with sweetness, “This is the temple! Everyone, go! Dig up the Immortal Lord’s statue! Remember, don’t look at the statue! And be careful; if you damage the statue, I’ll smash your heads!”

Almost identical phrases, even the tone was similar to Young Master Yu’s earlier orders.

“Yes!” the fifty men in black suits shouted in unison, charging toward the Nameless Temple.

Just as these black-clad men reached halfway, another screech of brakes was heard from behind.

A luxury car with a manure fork logo and three sturdy transport vehicles came to a halt.

Forty muscular men and a beautiful woman jumped out.

“Damn it! Someone got here first! Go! We cannot let the ‘Immortal Lord Statue’ fall into anyone else’s hands. We must seize it!” the beautiful woman said angrily.

A chaotic three-way battle was now inevitable!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Scholar Song tracked Bai Zhenjun using the ‘Long-Distance Sound Transmission Flute’ and finally arrived at a luxurious estate on the outskirts of Nan Hua Lake City.

The four small trucks carrying the statue that transformed from Bai Zhenjun had already entered the estate.

Tall walls and steel gates blocked Scholar Song’s path.

“This must be the place.” Scholar Song gripped the ‘Long-Distance Sound Transmission Flute’ and blew into it, trying to contact Bai Zhenjun.

Now, even if Bai Zhenjun burst out from the statue like a gourd baby, it wouldn’t cause any disturbance — at most, it would scare off those trying to dig up the statue.

“Zzzz… Hello.” Bai Zhenjun’s soft voice came from the flute.

“Senior, it’s almost time; you can come out of the statue now. I’ll take you away,” Scholar Song said.

“Zzzz… Hello, this is ‘Ah Bai’s’ closed-off location. There are still 1 hour and 2 quarters until the end of this session. Please wait patiently,” the soft voice continued.

Scholar Song: “…”

What the heck, he’s in closed-door training?

At this moment, Bai Zhenjun had actually entered into closed-door cultivation again. Although it would only last for about an hour or two, did he really need to be this diligent, Senior Bai Zhenjun? He couldn’t bear to waste even that little time on closed-door training?

At the same time, Scholar Song recalled something the Hermit of North River had once said in their group — “Bai Zhenjun is indeed a madman of closed-door training; he’s a true role model for us.”

So that’s what they meant by closed-door madman, always cultivating and never wasting a second!

Scholar Song felt this had to be a kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder for closed-door training; it needed treatment!

“Fine.” He sighed softly.

In that case, he would just have to take Bai Zhenjun’s statue back himself.

He held a ‘Jia Talisman’ in his left hand just in case.

Then, Scholar Song put on the Ultraman mask and slowly approached the thick steel gate.

“Here we go!” He took a deep breath.

The power of blood and energy from his dantian surged through his arm.

Muttering the mantra of the ‘Basic Vajra Fist’ in his mouth.

Basic Fist Technique — One!

A fist like a cannon, sweeping through thousands of troops!

Then, Dou Dou stood by, bored, sticking out his tongue… an utterly deflating sight!
