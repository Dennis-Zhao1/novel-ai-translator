**The Correct Way to Practice Foundation Fist Technique**

Scholar Song nodded earnestly, flipping back to the second image of the "Foundation Fist Technique of the Diamond." He made sure to memorize every detail firmly.

After that, he immersed himself in the world of the "Foundation Fist Technique of the Diamond" once more.

The same verdant grassland, the same muscular men, continuously executing the Foundation Fist Technique—only this time, the movements were different.

Scholar Song felt his blood boiling with excitement, wishing he could leap into action right away to perform the techniques he had just learned!

…

…

The unique space created by hypnosis felt long, but each session only lasted about one or two minutes.

The Alchemical Sage had given Scholar Song a two-hour limit, but he finished the remaining seventeen movements of the "Foundation Fist Technique" and the entire "True Self Meditation Scripture" in just over an hour, committing everything to memory.

Leaning back in his chair, he rubbed his temples vigorously. This short hour felt more exhausting than the four hours he had spent refining the body-enhancing liquid, and his head felt slightly swollen.

The Alchemical Sage asked, "Are you done?"

"Done! Now let's find a place to try it out?" Scholar Song opened his eyes, excitement evident in his voice. Despite feeling a bit fatigued, just recalling the "Foundation Fist Technique" made him eager to give it a go.

"Let’s go to that grassy area below; it’s spacious enough to move around freely," the Alchemical Sage pointed toward the grass patch not far from the boys' dormitory.

"Practice martial arts in such a public place? What if someone steals my techniques?" Scholar Song questioned, remembering the Alchemical Sage's previous warning against privately teaching martial arts. If someone learned his techniques and thought he was the one who taught them, wouldn’t that be incredibly unfair?

More importantly, practicing martial arts on that bustling grassland felt embarrassing.

Even though he was practicing legitimate cultivation techniques, the students at Jiangnan University Town would have no idea.

To them, Scholar Song would be seen as someone who had watched too many martial arts films, completely losing touch with reality as he practiced martial arts on the lawn.

"Haha, if the Foundation Fist Technique could be learned just by watching, then what’s the point of the technique’s incantations? You think those complicated characters are just there to hypnotize you? That’s the real secret that shouldn’t be passed on," the Alchemical Sage chuckled.

"I still think we should find a more private place. There’s a large open space on the roof of our dormitory; no one goes up there," Scholar Song insisted.

"You’re quite picky, aren’t you?" The Alchemical Sage shrugged casually. "Alright, let’s go to your roof then."

Scholar Song let out a sigh of relief.

He had dodged a bullet, avoiding the embarrassment of performing in front of a crowd.

…

…

The rooftop was a great place—perfect for flirting, hanging out, or watching meteor showers. It had been the setting for many couples at Jiangnan University Town.

Unfortunately, lately, too many people had taken a liking to the rooftop. Many of those who went up there liked to recreate scenes from the Titanic, spreading their arms wide at the edge of the railing, enjoying the wind against their faces. It was unclear if they enjoyed it too much, but often someone would slip and end up falling off the rooftop…

So, for safety reasons, a heavy lock had been installed on the boys' dormitory rooftop.

Of course, this lock posed no challenge for Scholar Song.

Calmly, he pulled a spare key from his pocket and unlocked it—this lock had been bought by his roommate, Tu Bo, at the beginning of the school year. Given Tu Bo's personality, it was only natural for him to get a few spare keys made. Each of the roommates had one.

The rooftop was separated from the stairwell, and Scholar Song and the Alchemical Sage chose a spot on the left side.

The Alchemical Sage began explaining, "The Foundation Fist Technique consists of eighteen moves. Generally, after you complete a full set of the technique, your body’s qi and blood will become full and overflow. Then, you can meditate and operate the 'True Self Meditation Scripture' to refine your qi and blood, storing it in your heart’s acupoint."

Scholar Song nodded, closing his eyes to mentally rehearse the eighteen moves of the "Foundation Fist Technique" from start to finish.

Then, he positioned himself to perform the initial stance of the Foundation Fist Technique.

To his surprise, the intensive training in the illusionary space had proven effective. As soon as Scholar Song struck the starting pose, a sense of familiarity washed over him, as if he had practiced this technique countless times. His body instinctively moved, and the first three movements flowed smoothly like a river.

It felt effortless, presenting no challenge at all. After the refinement from the body-enhancing liquid, Scholar Song's physical flexibility was comparable to that of a yoga expert. He could easily tilt his head back and dive through his legs without any struggle; the movements of the Foundation Fist Technique posed no difficulty for him.

He completed the 'Foundation Fist Technique One' all the way through to 'Foundation Fist Technique Ten' with ease, feeling as though he had merely completed a round of morning exercises.

However, he found it strange that after finishing the entire set of movements, he didn’t feel any sensation of 'qi and blood.' Let alone overflowing 'qi and blood.'

What was going on? Scholar Song felt puzzled and looked over at the Alchemical Sage.

Noticing Scholar Song's gaze, the Alchemical Sage asked, "What’s up?"

"Alchemical Sage, I just completed a full set of the techniques, but I didn’t feel any qi and blood!" Scholar Song expressed his frustration.

"You finished a full set? When did that happen? I didn’t see you do it!" The Alchemical Sage's eyes widened in surprise.

"Did you zone out, Alchemical Sage?" Scholar Song replied. "I just moved from 'Foundation Fist Technique One' all the way to 'Foundation Fist Technique Eighteen,' right?"

"……" The Alchemical Sage: "Weren't you just familiarizing yourself with the stances of the 'Foundation Fist Technique'? Practicing the movements before fully engaging?"

"No, I was seriously executing the entire 'Foundation Fist Technique' from start to finish," Scholar Song insisted.

Could it be that the Alchemical Sage was secretly mischievous?

The Alchemical Sage's expression twitched, followed by hearty laughter: "Scholar Song, practicing the cultivator's foundation techniques isn’t as simple as just posing for show! That’s why I told you before, even if someone learns the poses, it won’t be effective. The most important part is the incantation!"

After laughing, the Alchemical Sage continued to explain: "Let’s try again. Don’t just focus on the poses; softly recite the technique's incantation while adjusting your breathing. When you punch, put your power into it! Don’t act like a weakling. Go ahead and start over from the beginning!"

So it turns out I had the wrong approach earlier? No wonder the 'Foundation Fist Technique' felt so mundane, like just another exercise routine.

And was the Alchemical Sage naturally teasing? Watching him practice like a clown without a word of warning?

Shaking his head, Scholar Song mentally rehearsed the "Foundation Fist Technique" once more.

Then, he began to silently recite the deeply esoteric incantation of the technique, no longer just focusing on the stances. He recalled the moment when the faceless man executed the movements with force.

In that illusionary world, when the faceless man performed the first three movements of the Foundation Fist Technique, he could be both fierce and unyielding, charging forward; or he could be balanced and restrained, exerting seven parts strength while holding back three, sending his punches along a curve, seeking straightness within the curve.

Now, Scholar Song needed to refine his body, so he must unleash his full potential with every punch and every movement to achieve the desired results.

Once again, the first three movements of Foundation Fist Technique One unfurled in his hands.

"With the eyes as the guide, both movement and stillness originate from the waist… body like a bow, strength from the feet… fists like a mountain crashing down."

Eyes fixed ahead, he stepped forward, exerting force from his waist. As he activated the Foundation Fist Technique One, his fists shot out like cannon fire, powerful and forceful.

With a punch!

A resonating buzz echoed in his ears, as if a mighty bell were ringing.

As he continuously recited the technique's incantation, it felt as if an invisible yet undeniably real energy converged upon him from the world around. That force pressed heavily upon him, wrapping around his fists as they struck out.

With this punch, Scholar Song felt as if the air in front of him was about to explode.

At the same time, his body began to heat up, and he could faintly sense soreness and tension in the muscles of his shoulders, waist, and legs. It felt as though he had not just thrown one punch but had unleashed the Foundation Fist Technique One hundreds or even thousands of times!
