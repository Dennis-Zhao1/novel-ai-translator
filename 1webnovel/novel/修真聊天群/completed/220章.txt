“Hey, where did Instructor Li float off to?” 

“I don’t want to be brainwashed!” Instructor Li cried, tears streaming down his cheeks.

*Slap!* Venerable White gently tapped Instructor Li's helmet. Li's eyes rolled back, and he fainted once more.

“Got it! The memory-erasing spell is such a hassle; I managed to wipe his memories back to when he first saw us this morning... If it weren’t for his wild thrashing, I could have let him keep a bit more,” Venerable White said.

Scholar Song glanced at Instructor Li, feeling a little guilty.

Then, Venerable White unfastened his seatbelt and exclaimed, “Next up, let’s go patch up that big hole in the ‘Space Station’!”

“We? Together?” Scholar Song pointed at himself, surprised. “I’m going too?”

“Of course! That hole is massive; having you around might help with a few little tasks,” Venerable White replied cheerfully.

“Alright then,” Scholar Song agreed.

He was clueless about repairing the ‘Space Station,’ but at least he could keep an eye on Venerable White and prevent him from going off the rails.

“Let’s go!” Venerable White grabbed Scholar Song, opened the protective shield of the ‘helicopter-like flying sword,’ and with a gentle leap, they landed on the Space Station.

After the shield vanished, Instructor Li floated inside the helicopter. Thankfully, his seatbelt kept him from drifting away into the void.

Some parts from the helicopter also floated around; if not dealt with properly, they would definitely turn into space debris.

At that moment, Venerable White landed gracefully next to the hole in the Space Station. Both of them were protected by spells, making them appear almost invisible.

Then, with a flick of his wrist, Venerable White summoned an invisible force that gathered the floating debris around him. He believed these parts might be useful for patching the hole.

Next, Venerable White formed a hand gesture, and the helicopter shell slowly withdrew from the gaping hole.

Scholar Song stared at the damaged area for quite a while. After examining it, he still couldn’t figure out which part of the ‘Space Station’ had been damaged.

In any case, there was a thick outer layer that had been smashed open, revealing a tangle of wires and various pipes inside.

Although Scholar Song studied mechanical design and manufacturing, he couldn’t make heads or tails of the Space Station's design. After staring for so long, he still couldn’t discern anything useful.

“How do we fix this?” Venerable White crouched by the edge of the hole, casting a shield spell to prevent any debris from flying out of the Space Station.

“Does Senior have any restoration spells? One spell could reverse the damage and restore everything to its original state?” Scholar Song asked.

Venerable White rolled his eyes. “Do you think a spell like that even exists in this world?”

That made sense; if such a spell existed, Venerable White would have been the first to learn it.

“However, based on my experience dismantling various electrical devices, electronics, and cars... For anything broken, just reconnect the wires and weld the pipes back together, and you can’t go wrong! As for the outer layer, we just need to replace it. That should do it!” Venerable White said confidently.

Scholar Song nodded. “Then give it a shot, Senior.”

There was no harm in trying; if it worked, great! If not, they could just have Venerable White cast a shield spell to temporarily block the hole and let the Space Station personnel figure out a proper repair later.

“Leave it to me.” Venerable White began tinkering at the gaping hole, occasionally asking Scholar Song to fetch parts from the floating debris.

Gradually, the complex, severed wires were reconnected, and the broken pipes were rejoined—though Scholar Song wasn't sure if it was done correctly, it looked fine on the surface.

Thirty minutes later.

“Ha ha ha, when I focus, there’s really no problem! It’s done!” Venerable White stretched and turned to Scholar Song. “Come on, take a photo for me, and when we get back to Earth, post it in the group chat with the title: ‘Repairing a Hole in the Space Station in the Universe!’”

“…” Scholar Song.

Still, he took out his phone, adjusted the angle, and snapped several pictures of Venerable White.

“All done! Now we just need a new outer layer. How about we cut off the helicopter shell and weld it on for now?” Venerable White suggested.

“No way! Setting aside the strength of the outer layer, the helicopter shell has all sorts of obvious markings. If people discover that this was a helicopter shell that flew into space and was welded onto the Space Station, how would we explain that?” Scholar Song quickly countered.

“That’s true. Then I’ll carve a little formation and set up a shield to hold for a while. If they can’t repair this hole in a week, I’ll go back to Earth and bring back a steel plate to replace it,” Venerable White agreed, using his spiritual power to carve a small formation by the edge of the hole and infusing it with energy.

This way, a protective shield would form around the hole, capable of holding for about a week.

“Alright, let’s leave,” Venerable White said, clearly satisfied.

He then gently leaped back into the helicopter shell with Scholar Song.

……

……

Venerable White proposed, “Next, let’s find a meteorite or something to play with for a bit, then we’ll head back to Earth!”

“Sure.” Scholar Song touched his chest, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the day’s excitements. He really wanted to go home quickly.

However, noticing Venerable White still appeared genuinely interested, he didn’t want to dampen his enthusiasm. Since they were here, Scholar Song figured he might as well accompany Venerable White a little longer in space.

As they settled back into the helicopter shell, Scholar Song suddenly froze, lifting his head abruptly to look towards the co-pilot seat.

“Venerable White… where’s Instructor Li?!”

He noticed the co-pilot seat was empty, and Instructor Li was nowhere to be found!

Venerable White was momentarily stunned. “Huh? Where did he go?”

“Senior, could it be he woke up suddenly and ran off?” Scholar Song speculated.

Venerable White shook his head. “That’s impossible. The spell I used on him was strong enough to keep him unconscious for a whole day and night.”

“Then how could he just vanish… Could he have floated away?” Scholar Song carefully inspected the co-pilot seat, a cold sweat breaking out on his forehead—he had specifically reinforced Instructor Li’s seatbelt while they were fixing the hole.

But now, the seatbelt on the co-pilot seat was broken.

Broken!

“Oh no, Venerable White. Instructor Li really floated out into space!” Scholar Song exclaimed in a panic.

“Don’t panic; we didn’t spend too long fixing the hole, so he can’t have drifted far. I can use my mental power to locate him,” Venerable White said, unleashing his mental energy to scan the surroundings.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Time rewound, about ten minutes earlier…

Inside the Space Station.

“Akuro, has the damn surveillance found anything?” the white-haired Anthony shouted.

“F*ck! There’s a big hole appeared in the Space Station; we have no idea what it collided with. Damn it, there wasn’t even an alarm! How did this hole even form?” Akuro, the bald man, cursed loudly.

“Stop yelling! Will that hole impact the operation of the Space Station?” Anthony was concerned about the more critical matter—his life was at stake.

“Not really; that’s just a robotic arm platform. It won’t affect the overall operation of the Space Station,” Akuro replied.

While they were talking, a white object zipped past in the surveillance feed. 

“What was that?” Anthony jumped back in shock. Seeing something suddenly dash by in space was pretty terrifying!

Akuro quickly adjusted the camera, and soon they could see that white object clearer—it was a human figure in a spacesuit.

“It’s an astronaut!” Akuro said in disbelief.

“Could that collision have something to do with him? Quickly, bring him in!” Anthony urged.

“Watch this; I hope our buddy is still alive,” Akuro replied.

Five minutes later…

The two astronauts finally managed to retrieve their comrade, floating in space, and dragged him into the Space Station to the ‘service chamber.’

“He’s an Oriental and still alive! Wow, this guy is lucky.” Akuro remarked. “Wake him up and ask him what happened.”

Four minutes later…

The astronauts tried every trick they knew, but couldn’t wake the Oriental astronaut.

Just then, Anthony’s eyes lit up. “Let’s take off his spacesuit! I remember this model has a camera in the helmet and video storage and playback functions. I’ll check it out; maybe he recorded what happened before he lost consciousness.”

Two minutes later…

The two astronauts clumsily removed the Oriental astronaut’s suit and replaced it with a spare suit from the Space Station.

Then, Anthony, who had a similar build, climbed into the Oriental astronaut’s suit and began operating the controls.

The originally transparent helmet visor lowered a black material over Anthony’s face, but it also gave the helmet video playback capabilities.

This feature was developed in 2019, but it was somewhat gimmicky and posed safety risks, so very few suits used it.

“Strange, why isn’t this guy’s camera function activated? It’s just a black screen!” Anthony complained, fiddling for a long time without finding any useful information.

Just then…

The door to the service chamber opened automatically!

Anthony and Akuro turned to look at the door, only to find it completely empty.

As they puzzled over what happened, a wave of heavy drowsiness washed over them.

Neither could withstand the dizziness, and they both fainted.

Three figures in spacesuits floated in the service chamber.

“Got it! I didn’t expect Instructor Li to end up in the space chamber!” Scholar Song’s figure appeared in the chamber, grinning.

Then he stepped forward, grabbed the familiar figure in the spacesuit, and swiftly exited the service chamber.
