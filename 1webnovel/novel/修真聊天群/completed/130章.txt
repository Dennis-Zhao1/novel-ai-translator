**A Rough Start to the Blue Sky Experience: One Star Review!**

Seventeen reinforcements from the Xian Nong Sect had arrived, all brimming with spirit and enthusiasm. Unfortunately, that was their only redeeming quality. Their overall combat prowess was rather lacking, with only two of them being third-tier cultivators and the rest stuck at the second tier.

Considering that the Xian Nong Sect was already notorious in the nearby cultivation community for their weak combat capabilities, it was hard to say how much destruction these seventeen could actually cause.

At that moment, an uncle from the Xian Nong Sect came rushing in from the rear. He wore a pair of blue boots that were clearly a magical artifact. With these boots, he managed to keep pace with An Zhi Mo Jun, even surpassing the speed of the Great Jingba Hound!

Of course, part of this was because the Great Jingba Hound wasn’t putting in its full effort—being at such a high level, it had the intelligence to recognize the friction between the uncle and An Zhi Mo Jun. It was content to hang back and wait for the uncle to take the lead.

Before the uncle even arrived, his voice echoed out: “That guy in the black mist over there kidnapped Su Shi A Sixteen! Let’s get him!”

With a furious shout, the uncle leaped high into the air, his body spinning like a dragon’s horn, aiming straight for An Zhi Mo Jun. He launched right into his ultimate move.

The seventeen Xian Nong Sect cultivators immediately followed suit, each unleashing their own techniques.

Since only cultivators of the fourth tier could control swords, aside from the three who wielded bow and arrow magical artifacts, most of the remaining disciples could only jump high alongside the uncle!

With the uncle included, there were a total of eighteen cultivators from the Xian Nong Sect, each leaping as high as a five-story building, their attack creating a spectacular scene. They unleashed their spiritual energy, with various light effects that made the scene even more dazzling than a modern martial arts film.

Yet, the result was… zero damage dealt to An Zhi Mo Jun.

The figure of An Zhi Mo Jun merely sneered coldly, the black mist around him solidifying into a spherical shield that provided full coverage.

A cacophony of sounds erupted as the attacks from the Xian Nong Sect cultivators only served to create sparks against the spherical defense.

Then, under the influence of gravity, the cultivators all fell back to the ground.

An Zhi Mo Jun didn’t even regard these weaklings; his gaze drifted toward the Great Jingba Hound, which was panting and closing in fast.

In just ten breaths, the Great Jingba would be able to bite down on him again.

“I’ve got to take care of these weaklings in five breaths!” An Zhi Mo Jun thought to himself.

“Drink!” He shouted, and the spherical defense exploded, transforming into hundreds of black short swords.

“Go!” An Zhi Mo Jun commanded, and the hundred short swords flew like a school of piranhas, darting towards the eighteen cultivators from the Xian Nong Sect.

Swish, swish, swish… the sound of blades slicing through flesh filled the air, blood sprayed, and screams echoed.

One breath later…

Except for the uncle and two third-tier cultivators, all the other members of the Xian Nong Sect had fallen to the ground, each with dozens of sword wounds.

In one glance, over half had been taken out in an instant; it was truly a testament to the strength of the Xian Nong Sect’s disciples!

“Fourth-tier cultivators are indeed not to be trifled with,” the uncle from the Xian Nong Sect gritted his teeth in frustration.

Controlling swords required a fourth-tier cultivator. In ancient times, fourth-tier cultivators were referred to as ‘Void Dan Cultivators,’ just a step away from forming the Golden Dan and becoming a fifth-tier Golden Dan Spirit Monarch.

Even with their numbers, they were no match for their opponent.

Damn it, their strongest reinforcements were still on the way and would need some time to arrive!

They must hold out, at least until Brother Zheng Neng made it here.

Just as he was thinking this, the uncle’s eyes widened as he stared at the center of the black mist: “Huh?”

As the protective black mist transformed into a school of swordfish to attack, it dissipated, finally revealing An Zhi Mo Jun’s true appearance. He was a short-haired man clad in red armor, his face obscured by a layer of black mist that made it impossible to discern his features.

But that wasn’t the point; the real focus was on the figure behind An Zhi Mo Jun—there was a massive tail that had transformed into a giant hand, clutching someone.

Logically, the one being captured should have been the young girl, Su Shi A Sixteen.

But to the uncle's astonishment, the figure he saw was a pretty boy.

“Fraud!” The uncle pointed at Song Shuhang, shouting furiously, “Bastard, why are you here? Where’s Su Shi A Sixteen?!”

“What?” An Zhi Mo Jun was taken aback as well, turning to look at the “humanoid creature” his tail had grabbed.

“Hehe… ugh.” Song Shuhang managed a bitter smile.

He had envisioned soaring into the blue sky countless times.

In his dreams, he imagined himself piloting a plane, soaring through the skies like an eagle, traversing the land and sea.

Or perhaps he would learn to fly on a sword, stepping upon light and laughing at the world below!

What a magnificent image that was!

But he never imagined that his actual first flight experience would involve being forcibly whisked away by someone else. The giant hand formed from the demon lord’s tail was gripping him tightly, shaking him wildly, almost causing his insides to spill out.

This blue sky experience? Thirty-two one-star reviews! It shattered his dream of becoming a “true man soaring into the sky” in an instant!

Ideals are so bountiful, but reality is a harsh and painful truth.

“Not Su Shi A Sixteen?” An Zhi Mo Jun asked, confused.

“Hehe.” Song Shuhang let out a sarcastic laugh, expressing his complex feelings at that moment.

“Not A Sixteen? Then what were you doing when I called out ‘Junior Su’? Why did you come running?” An Zhi Mo Jun demanded angrily.

“...Hehe.” After a moment of silence, Song Shuhang decided to respond with another sarcastic smile. Seriously? All I said was ‘who’s there,’ and you just assumed I was Su Shi A Sixteen and grabbed me?

“There’s a problem with our target. We’re retreating!” The goofy uncle from the Xian Nong Sect decisively declared, shouting.

As for this damned fraud, whether he lived or died was none of his concern; he only cared about Su Shi A Sixteen!

An Zhi Mo Jun paused for about two breaths…

“Jekekek, interesting, very interesting!” Suddenly, the demon lord burst into laughter, leaving everyone wondering what was so amusing.

“Hehe! Sword!” At that moment, Song Shuhang struggled to grasp the talisman in his pocket and activated it.

Having been gripped too tightly by the demon lord, he had finally managed to get a finger around the “sword talisman.” Seizing the opportunity while An Zhi Mo Jun was distracted, he finally found a chance to use the [Sword Talisman].

As the sword talisman activated, a phantom figure appeared behind Song Shuhang, standing proudly and gazing at An Zhi Mo Jun.

Then, that figure pointed like a sword, guided by Song Shuhang’s will, and slashed at the base of An Zhi Mo Jun’s tail.

Brilliant sword light erupted, firmly locking onto An Zhi Mo Jun. In the demon lord’s eyes, it seemed as if the world had narrowed down to just that sword, with nothing else in sight.

This talisman had been crafted by a master of talismans, and that sword light represented a sophisticated sword technique!

However, the master’s cultivation level wasn’t high, and when creating this talisman, he hadn’t yet condensed a Golden Dan to ascend to Spirit Monarch. Thus, the power of this sword light only matched that of a third-tier cultivator.

But An Zhi Mo Jun wouldn’t dare underestimate this sword light; although its power was only at the third tier, it was a cunning sword technique—if he wasn’t careful, he might just find himself falling into a pit!
