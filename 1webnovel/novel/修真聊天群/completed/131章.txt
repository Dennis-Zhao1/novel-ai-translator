What to Do When Encountering a Large Carnivorous Monster?

As the blade of light slashed toward his tail, the Demon Lord An Zhi suddenly broke into a strange smile. With a flick of his tail, he tossed Scholar Song down from the high sky.

No one could understand the thought process of demon cultivators… Scholar Song had aimed to force the Demon Lord to throw him away with that swing of his sword in hopes of escaping. 

However, to his surprise, the blade of light didn’t even touch him, and An Zhi had already decided to throw him away on his own.

Perhaps to the Demon Lord, since Scholar Song wasn't Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan, he had no value? Or did he have some other plan in mind?

No one could know his thoughts.

Immediately after, An Zhi clasped his hands together. Countless black little swords whirled back, forming a massive sphere of blades right in front of him.

The sword sphere met the incoming brilliance of the talisman weapon's sword light.

Boom!

The black sword sphere collided with the exquisite sword light, and the two energies exploded, sending shockwaves rolling outwards in all directions.

As Scholar Song plummeted from the sky, he was caught in the blast of the shockwave, accelerating downward like a rocket…

In that moment, the only thought racing through Scholar Song's mind was: Don’t crash into anything hard!

Boom boom boom...

In the sky, after the turbulent clash of blades and lights, An Zhi remained proudly standing in midair, unscathed, with a black light beneath him supporting his figure.

He was completely unharmed, exuding the undeniable aura of a master!

“Woof Woof!” At that moment, the massive Dajingba dog howled in the distance, and four fiery wheels suddenly appeared beneath its feet, resembling flaming wheels.

With the assistance of the flaming wheels, the Dajingba dog demon's speed skyrocketed, and like a starving dog pouncing on its prey, it lunged toward An Zhi.

“Damn it, why is this big dog chasing me?” The Demon Lord's masterful demeanor dissipated in less than two seconds.

He hurriedly retracted the swarm of black little swords, transforming them back into smoke, and quickly dodged in midair, desperately avoiding the Dajingba demon dog.

...

Thud!

Scholar Song finally hit the ground. Luckily, he didn’t crash into any rocks. But even so, he felt as if his internal organs had shattered, an intense pain surging through him, relentlessly assaulting his nerves.

At that moment, he was grateful for the rigorous training he had been doing over the past few days. Fortunately, his physical condition had improved to this level; otherwise, that fall could have killed him…

Meanwhile, the uncle from the Xian Nong Sect and two third-grade cultivators were swiftly tending to their fallen companions.

The Xian Nong cultivators were somewhat fortunate; even though many were severely injured and had fallen, at least no one had died.

“Big dog, just you wait. Once I get the chance, I’ll definitely hunt you down and make a feast out of you!” An Zhi's furious roar echoed in the sky.

It seemed he had suffered a bit of loss under the Dajingba's jaws.

Next, he swooped down like an eagle catching a chick… and snatched the Xian Nong uncle!

He didn’t grab Scholar Song; instead, he took the uncle away and fled into the distance…

Was the Demon Lord nearsighted and grabbed the wrong person?

In midair, the Dajingba spat out the black substance it had bitten, its eyes filled with disdain: “Woof Woof!”

“Brother Zhengde!” One female third-grade cultivator from the Xian Nong Sect exclaimed in shock as she saw the uncle being taken away. Without hesitation, she leaped after the direction An Zhi had gone.

It turned out… the goofy uncle from the Xian Nong Sect was known as ‘Zhengde.’

The remaining third-grade cultivator wanted to pursue as well, but seeing the numerous injured brothers on the ground, he could only grit his teeth and hold back the urge to chase, staying behind to treat his companions.

With his assistance, the injured disciples of the Xian Nong Sect slowly sat up, meditating to recover their injuries.

With a light sigh, this third-grade cultivator glanced at Scholar Song, who was lying nearby.

After contemplating for a moment, he walked over, half-supporting Scholar Song, and fed him a healing pill.

The Xian Nong Sect was adept at cultivating various spiritual herbs and elixirs, so they had enough pills on hand to spare for a stranger.

On the other hand… this was also in line with the Xian Nong Sect’s ethos. Their sect had a straightforward style, and most of their disciples had good character. If it weren’t for the fact that their sect’s treasure, the ‘Seven Radiant Marvelous Fruits,’ had been stolen, they wouldn’t have been so enraged.

Fortunately, the world of cultivators had been relatively peaceful in recent centuries. Otherwise, a good-hearted sect with low combat strength would find it hard to endure.

After swallowing the pill, Scholar Song could clearly feel a refreshing aura flowing from his mouth into his internal organs, easing the intense pain that had plagued him. Within moments, his injuries were healed!

“Thank you.” Scholar Song took a deep breath and got back on his feet.

The third-grade cultivator looked at him with complex emotions and finally sighed, “You’re welcome.”

As he spoke, the disciples of the Xian Nong Sect, having finished recovering, gathered around.

With the uncle Zhengde having been captured and the female third-grade cultivator chasing after him, the highest-ranking and strongest member among the Xian Nong disciples present was this third-grade cultivator beside Scholar Song.

A young disciple, still with a youthful face, frowned and asked, “Brother Zhengyan, what do we do next?”

They hadn’t captured Sable Sixteen; instead, their Brother Zhengde had been taken by that strange person, and even Sister Zhengyue was pursuing him. It was truly a case of losing a woman and losing soldiers—a total loss!

With this thought in mind, the young disciple shot a resentful glare at Scholar Song, feeling that all of this was his fault.

“What we do next… let’s wait for Brother Zhengneng to arrive and then discuss it. Brother Zhengde has Sister Zhengyue with him, so we can stay in contact at any time,” Zhengyan sighed, saying that ‘Brother Zhengneng’ was the fourth-grade cultivator in this rescue team and currently the strongest fighting force of the Xian Nong Sect.

For a moment, the faces of the Xian Nong members were filled with worry and despair.

At that moment, Scholar Song suddenly raised his hand and asked softly, “Um… I know this might be awkward, but can I ask a question?”

“Hmph.” The young disciple with the youthful face snorted coldly.

“Please go ahead, friend,” Brother Zhengyan replied.

“I’d like to know, if a powerful beast is coming toward us, how should we deal with it?” Scholar Song’s gaze flickered toward the sky.

The massive Dajingba dog demon, having grown tired of chasing the Demon Lord An Zhi, took a lap on its flaming wheels, panting as it turned and approached the Xian Nong disciples.

The disciples of the Xian Nong Sect stared blankly at the large Dajingba dog slowly floating down from the sky, unable to answer Scholar Song's question.

“Does it eat meat?” someone whispered.

“Definitely,” Scholar Song replied. Had they ever seen a big dog that didn’t eat meat?

“Should we run away?” another person asked, posing a foolish question.

Who could outrun this Dajingba? Plus, it could fly!

Did that mean they could only leave their fate to chance? Or hope that the dog wasn’t hungry?

“By the way… before I left the sect, Brother Zhenghong gave me a handbook on how to deal with various crises. Maybe it can help!” At that moment, the young disciple suddenly remembered something. He quickly rummaged through his clothes and pulled out a hardbound notebook.

Brother Zhenghong was a specialist in raising demons in the Xian Nong Sect, often wandering outside with rich adventure experience. He might have recorded ways to handle crises involving large ferocious beasts!

The young disciple quickly flipped to the ‘Beast Section’ of the handbook.
