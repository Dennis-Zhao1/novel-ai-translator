**Translation:**

The Master said: "Peeling away the skin reveals the flesh!"

"Is that so?" Scholar Song rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "After coming back from the brink of death, hearing that such severe injuries can heal in a few months only made her faint again. It seems she must have some urgent matter to attend to. When she heard that her recovery would take time, she panicked and fainted?"

"Senior Scholar Song is truly wise," the little monk solemnly praised.

Ever since Scholar Song had stopped the little monk from 'making him poop his pants', their relationship had unknowingly grown much closer.

While they spoke, Dou Dou returned, swaying slightly. "Venerable White's retreat isn't over yet. Scholar, have you figured out the background of this woman in the black dress?"

"I haven't had the chance to ask. She fainted again in excitement," Scholar Song shrugged. "How about I try another healing spell? We can wake her up and ask her then."

"Give it a shot. If she wakes up again, you should inquire about her identity. It might also be a good idea to have her write a will or something. Her injuries are too severe, and the Alchemical Sage doesn't know when he'll be back. If he arrives late, she might just... well, you know," Dou Dou replied.

Though Dou Dou’s words were harsh, they held a ring of truth.

"That's true." Scholar Song nodded.

He first took off his T-shirt and placed it over the legs of the black-dressed woman.

Chu Chu, the woman in black, had torn the hem of her skirt while fleeing from the attack of the Wolf One, Bull Two, and Monkey Four, escaping into the sea… The T-shirt would cover her exposed beauty.

After that, Scholar Song activated the bronze ring again and cast a healing spell on the woman.

Three breaths later, the excitedly fainted Chu Chu opened her eyes once more.

This time, her gaze was much steadier.

She forced a bitter smile. "Thank you, friend, for your help."

"Stay calm. Try not to faint from excitement again." Scholar Song said. The healing spells on the bronze ring only had one chance left; he couldn't waste it.

Chu Chu nodded—this small movement sent pain shooting through her entire body. It was as if pulling a single thread would unravel her completely. Luckily, she had encountered Scholar Song and Venerable White; otherwise, given her injuries, she would have long since passed away.

Scholar Song asked, "Don't move around. Also... while you're still conscious, would you mind telling me about your identity? And, just to be safe, would you consider leaving a will or something?"

Chu Chu was silent for a moment before cautiously asking, "Didn't you say I still have a chance at survival?"

Scholar Song chuckled awkwardly. "Well, it's just a precaution. My esteemed senior with excellent medical skills doesn't know when he'll return. Your injuries are far too severe, and if he hasn't come back and you... well, cough... it’s just, would you mind writing a will?"

The little monk chimed in, "Scholar, you’re being too direct. You should be a bit more tactful."

Scholar Song: "…"

He knew he should be more tactful, but this was the first time he had to advise someone to write a will, and he didn't know how to approach it delicately. Should he say: 'Hello, I’m gently reminding you that you might need to write a will soon'?

Chu Chu sighed softly. "It's alright. If a cultivator can't look at life and death with indifference, then what’s the point of cultivating?"

Then, she began to introduce herself.

There wasn’t much to hide about her identity since she carried the identity badge of the 'Chu Clan', and if someone was curious, they could easily guess her background by going through her belongings.

"My name is Chu Chu, and I’m a disciple of the Chu Clan." She took a deep breath and started recounting her story.

Upon hearing 'Chu Clan', Scholar Song felt a sense of familiarity. "What about those who were chasing you? Who are they, and why are they after you?"

"They should be members of a sect that does 'take money to eliminate disasters'... As for why they are after me, it’s because our Chu Clan has a recent feud with the 'Void Sword Sect'. Due to some conflicting reasons, both sides are preparing to settle their grievances at the 'Immortal Severing Platform'. I’m a member representing the Chu Clan in this event, and the Void Sword Sect has resorted to underhanded tactics against me to ensure their victory at the Immortal Severing Platform," Chu Chu explained.

While introducing herself, she intentionally left out the source of the feud between the 'Chu Clan' and the 'Void Sword Sect'—the "Sword Manual". One should never harbor malicious intentions, but always be on guard. Moreover, the "Sword Manual" wasn’t something that needed to be mentioned, so she naturally kept quiet to avoid unnecessary trouble.

"The feud between the clan and the sword sect?" Scholar Song tapped his head, suddenly recalling what Fay Yu had told him, and he asked, "Wait, is it because of a 'Sword Manual' that your Chu Clan has been troubled by a nearby small sect, leading to enmity between both sides?"

Chu Chu's eyes widened: "…"

I haven't said anything! How does this guy know about the conflict between the Chu Clan and the Void Sword Sect? Moreover… calling the Void Sword Sect a ‘small sect’? They’ve made our Chu Clan suffer terribly!

"Your expression confirms it. Looks like I have some fate with your Chu Clan," Scholar Song smiled. "Let me introduce myself. I’m Scholar Song, a loose cultivator. I have a friend, Fay Yu, who is a friend of a disciple from your Chu Clan."

Chu Chu looked at Scholar Song calmly—what a coincidence is this?

At this moment, the little monk joined in, clasping his hands together. "My name is Guo Guo, a disciple of the Tanyayun Temple."

"Tanyayun Temple?" Chu Chu blinked, then her eyes widened in surprise. "Is it that Tanyayun Temple?"

The one said to be half in reality and half in another space, a temple that could appear anywhere in the world? That was a revered force in the cultivation world, one that even small clans like hers looked up to!

"I remember that our Tanyayun Temple should be the only one in the cultivation world, with no other branches," the little monk smiled slightly, proud of his sect.

After the little monk introduced himself, the Pekingese Dou Dou couldn't wait to squeeze in.

"I'm Dou Dou, the demon dog. Just call me Big Brother Dou Dou. Little girl, I see you have potential. If you’re willing to be my little sister, I’ll take care of you! A mere Void Sword Sect? I’ll flatten them for you!" Dou Dou boasted proudly.

"Dou Dou, don’t cause trouble." Scholar Song lightly tapped Dou Dou on the head. Having Dou Dou help often led to more complications. Scholar Song knew this from experience—like the time he asked Dou Dou to help find the little monk Guo Gu, and Dou Dou ended up leading the little monk away from home…

Chu Chu forced a smile.

"Ahem, let’s get back on track. Chu Chu, do you have any last wishes?" Scholar Song redirected the conversation.

With a final sigh, Chu Chu said, "If something truly happens to me, please make sure to return my remains to the Chu Clan."

"Alright, I’ll remember that." Scholar Song nodded. "You should rest well for now."

Chu Chu slightly nodded and closed her eyes to recuperate.

Scholar Song rubbed his chin—by the way, what is the Immortal Severing Platform? Is it something like a martial arts arena?

…

About five minutes later, Chu Chu fell into a faint again; her physical condition was just too terrible.

Dou Dou lay on the small island, sunbathing, feeling bored. Even if he wanted to do something, he had the will but lacked the strength.

The little monk quietly sat on a rock, beginning to meditate and recite scriptures. Even away from Tanyayun Temple, he still maintained his daily practice of reciting scriptures.

Scholar Song, bare-chested, found a shaded spot and began sorting through his belongings.

First was the broken precious sword, a disposable flying sword version 004, and a backpack.

In the backpack were soul beads, medicinal pills, a transformation brooch, talismans… and a small box.

Hmm? This small box looks unfamiliar. What could be inside?

Curious, Scholar Song opened the small box and found sixteen thin plant tendrils inside, shaped like vivid, lifelike dragons.

But he couldn’t recall where he had acquired these plants. Were they a find from the mysterious island?

Just then, he spotted a note at the bottom of the box. It bore his handwriting with the words 'Dragon Bone Withered Vine' written on it.

"Dragon Bone Withered Vine?! Isn't this a heavenly treasure that can greatly aid Sable Sixteen's recovery?" Scholar Song carefully put away the 'Dragon Bone Withered Vine', his heart racing with excitement.

With these Dragon Bone Withered Vines, he could help Sable Sixteen recover from her injuries!

After securing the box, Scholar Song rummaged through his backpack and found another unfamiliar item—a cute rabbit-shaped wallet.

Seeing this item made Scholar Song feel a surge of embarrassment. Why was this in his backpack?

Did he pick it up casually on the mysterious island?

He had to return any found items to their owners.

But the problem was, he had no memory of the mysterious island and didn’t know how to find the wallet's owner.

Should he throw it away? Or give it to some girl?

After all, such a cute wallet didn't seem suitable for him to use.

While pondering this, Scholar Song opened the wallet to take a look inside.

Then he found a very small piece of paper in the wallet.

Curious, he took the note out.

The moment he pulled out the note, it suddenly... transformed from the size of a pinky finger to a large sheet of paper.

It grew larger?

On the gigantic white paper were several powerful characters: "One-Inch Snake Wallet."

Next to it were smaller words: "Pinch the left ear of the rabbit, infuse it with blood energy or true energy, and you can shrink the objects touched by the wallet and store them inside."

And beside those small words were even smaller characters: "I hope you didn’t throw away this cute wallet."

Scholar Song: "…"

That was close! He almost threw this wallet away just a moment ago!

He had gathered such rich rewards on the mysterious island? He even obtained a 'One-Inch Snake' skin wallet!

While lost in thought, Scholar Song pinched the left ear of the rabbit, channeling his blood energy, and pressed the rabbit wallet against his backpack.

In the next moment, the backpack shrank to the size of a fingernail and was stored inside the rabbit wallet.

"Awesome." Scholar Song murmured. With this, it would be so much more convenient for him to go out in the future!

Carefully stowing away the rabbit wallet, Scholar Song opened his phone to scroll through.

On the small island, he couldn't receive any mobile signals.

He had planned to contact Sable Seven through the Ninefold Land group to have him bring the 'Dragon Bone Withered Vine' to Sable Sixteen. But it seemed he would have to wait until he returned to an area with signal to contact Sable Seven.

Also, since his phone had no signal, he hadn’t received the surprise gift pack from Fay Yu.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

On a small island in the Pacific Ocean adjacent to the East China Sea, another event was unfolding.

On this day, several large flames suddenly descended from the sky over the tranquil island.

The first fireball landed, and many figures emerged from within the flames.

Among them were two men dressed as airline captains, several flight attendants, and many men and women, including Joseph's daughter, Ji Shuangxue. All of them landed on the island, scattered chaotically on the beach, all in a state of unconsciousness.

Next was the second fireball, which was small and contained only two figures—a street dance master from the black community and a sensible little boy who wanted to reunite with his parents. They were both those who had chosen 'YES' during the 'Ancient City' gate options.

The third fireball contained a group of individuals including Gao Moumou, Joseph, Tu Bo, the Zhuge siblings, and the Lu Fei sisters, all of whom had successfully completed a 'transaction' to leave the Heavenly Island.

In the fourth fireball were eight figures covered in blood, their clothes torn and soaked, yet oddly, none of them bore any wounds.

They were all the passengers from the ill-fated plane.

After the four fireballs landed, they quickly extinguished.

All the passengers, apart from Scholar Song, lay scattered on the beach, unconscious.

…

About ten minutes later.

A group of primitive men dressed in animal skins and wielding primitive weapons ran from the depths of the island to the beach. They had been drawn to the beach by the descending flames.

"People! Many people!" One female primitive pointed at the passengers on the beach, speaking awkwardly in Chinese.

"A wise man once said: 'Isn't it a joy to have friends come from afar?' These people are friends! We should rejoice!" a leader-like primitive said earnestly.

As soon as the leader finished speaking, a chubby primitive’s eyes lit up. "The wise man also said: 'Peeling away the skin reveals the flesh!' These people are energy! I haven't had meat in a long time!"

Smack! The leader swiftly slapped the chubby primitive’s head… he was clearly losing his mind over thoughts of meat!
