**Playing Along with the Plan**

After Scholar Song rushed home at breakneck speed with the bone-cutting knife and soy sauce in hand, a wave of annoyance washed over him. 

“Can you believe that crafty scallion spirit outsmarted me?” he thought, glancing at the ordinary green onion he held. Although it looked like a simple stalk, it was brimming with the essence of a ‘scallion spirit,’ which had fooled him for a moment.

Just earlier, while picking up the soy sauce, he had accidentally applied too much force with his fingers. In a split second, the ‘scallion spirit’ had snapped cleanly in half…

Snapped in half!

It dawned on Scholar Song that the ‘scallion spirit’ he had in hand was a fake. The real one could very well be back in his home, possibly having made a swift escape!

“Damn it, I was way too careless.” Scholar Song had always been meticulous and cautious when it came to matters related to ‘cultivation,’ but he hadn’t expected to let his guard down around this tricky scallion spirit.

……

Upon arriving home in a rush, Scholar Song quickly assessed the situation. 

He let out a silent sigh of relief as he found the house quiet. In the living room, Zhao Yaya and her two friends were whispering to one another; in the study, Father Song and Old Lu were engaging in some kind of discussion. Meanwhile, Mother Song was busy in the kitchen… it seemed the scallion spirit hadn’t caused any trouble after all.

“Did the scallion spirit escape right away?” Scholar Song thought, focusing his mind and activating the “True Self Meditation Scripture,” using a mental trick called the ‘Mental Detective Technique.’

With three of his spirit channels opened, Scholar Song’s mental power was significantly stronger than before. When unleashed, it could encompass his entire home.

As he activated the ‘Mental Detective Technique,’ the three girls in the living room and his father and Old Lu paused momentarily, a shiver running down their spines as if they sensed someone watching them.

At the same time, everything within the house, even the ants crawling in the dim corners, came into focus in Scholar Song’s mind. Of course, the images were still quite rough—while he could sense the ants, they appeared as pixelated blurs.

However, the larger human figures were now reflected in his mind like clear, moving video footage.

After searching diligently… Scholar Song couldn’t locate the ‘scallion spirit.’

This was a problem. If the spirit really had fled, and word got out about him possessing the ‘Path Enlightenment Stone,’ he would be in serious trouble.

Wait a minute!

What was Mother holding?

That three-foot-long thing—it was his precious knife, the Bone-Cutting Blade! How did it end up in her hands?

While he was puzzled, he saw Mother Song emerge from the kitchen, holding the gleaming knife.

“Oh, Scholar Song, you’re back! Why are you just standing there? Hand over the bone-cutting knife and soy sauce, I need them urgently,” she said, waving the Bone-Cutting Blade enthusiastically.

“Ahem, Mom, why are you holding that decorative knife?” Scholar Song swallowed hard and asked.

“Haha, this decorative knife is really something! It’s sharper than I expected. If I hadn’t wanted to keep it clean, I would have used it to chop some large ribs,” Mother Song chuckled.

She continued, “Just now, I noticed a scallion sitting on the cabinet by the door. I must have accidentally left it there when I came back from grocery shopping, so I thought I’d take it to the kitchen to chop it up for some ‘Scallion Lamb Stir-fry.’ But it was strange—I couldn’t chop it no matter what.”

At this point, Mother Song frowned, recalling, “It’s odd; I’ve never encountered a scallion like that before. The knife couldn’t cut it. Thinking back, it felt wrong.”

Oh no, the scallion spirit was taken back to the kitchen by Mother Song!

“Hahaha, Mom, that scallion is indeed quite special. It’s a new variety my friend gifted me. I was planning to plant it at home,” Scholar Song said, fabricating a lie—he was getting better at this. To protect some things about the ‘cultivation world,’ he had been telling more and more lies recently.

“Oh, so it’s a new variety you brought back! No wonder,” Mother Song replied, accepting his explanation without further thought.

Scholar Song sighed in relief—wait, his mom was holding the Bone-Cutting Blade… oh no, what if the scallion spirit was in trouble?

He swallowed again, “Mom, is that scallion still around?”

“Oh, I chopped it up. I couldn’t cut it with a kitchen knife, so I thought of your ‘decorative knife.’ When I used it, it cut through like butter! I sliced it into scallion pieces—this knife is fantastic!” Mother Song declared with pride.

Scholar Song was left dumbfounded: “Then, where are the scallion pieces?”

“I made them into Scallion Lamb Stir-fry! Speaking of which, your new scallion variety is really interesting. It seemed indestructible, yet once chopped, it cooked up quickly in the oil. The fragrance is amazing! You must try it; my Scallion Lamb Stir-fry is a masterpiece!” Mother Song beamed with pride.

Scallion Lamb Stir-fry… Scallion Lamb Stir-fry… Scallion Lamb Stir-fry…

What if the scallion spirit was dead?

And why didn’t it resist? Faced with a life-or-death situation, why did it allow Mother Song to slice it up?

“Mom, what about the scallion roots? Are they still there?” Scholar Song clung to a sliver of hope—would the scallion spirit survive if the upper part was cut off? After all, it was a plant-type spirit, so perhaps the roots could still hold a chance of survival?

“I tossed them aside in the kitchen. Why do you need the roots? Oh… I forgot you wanted to take that scallion home to grow it,” Mother Song pointed to the kitchen, “You can look for yourself; there are several scallion roots mixed together next to the cutting board. I’ll go hang this knife back up for you.”

……

Scholar Song dashed into the kitchen, quickly spotting the scallion spirit’s ‘roots.’

They still radiated a strong essence of scallion spirit.

“Hey, are you still alive?” Scholar Song whispered.

However, the scallion spirit didn’t respond, only its roots quivered slightly.

It seemed to be alive for the moment…

Scholar Song sighed in relief, carefully picking up the roots and tucking them away. His gaze fell upon the plate of Scallion Lamb Stir-fry, a proud creation of Mother Song.

Three-hundred-year-old scallion spirit stir-fried with lamb—was this a health boost? Or would it be deadly?

After contemplating, he pulled out his phone and hurriedly logged onto the ‘Ninefold Land Number One Group.’

**Book Mountain Pressure Is Heavy:** “Seniors, my 300-year-old scallion spirit was chopped up for lamb stir-fry by my mom… all that’s left is a root. Can it survive? Also, will eating 300-year-old scallion spirit stir-fry kill someone? I’m waiting online, it’s urgent!”

This dish was Mother’s pride and joy, and it would surely be served up to the family soon. What if it turned out to be deadly? He’d have to find a way to get rid of it!

Soon, someone replied.

It was Hermit of North River, who was always the first to respond: “[0_0] A 300-year-old scallion spirit? That's quite rare! To answer your first question: as long as the root isn’t too damaged, there’s still hope for it to survive. Plant it in the soil and water it with some spirit spring, and it should recover. As for your second question, I haven’t tried 300-year-old scallion spirit stir-fry, so I can’t say.”

Then, Drunken Moon Scholar replied: “For your second question: hypothetically, if your mom were a ‘Culinary Celestial,’ like that Snow Fairy, then 300-year-old scallion spirit stir-fry would be a great tonic. Even ordinary people could extend their lives by eating it!”

**Book Mountain Pressure Is Heavy:** “...Seniors, stop joking. My mom is just an ordinary person.”

Drunken Moon Scholar: “Hmm, then ordinary people definitely shouldn’t eat it! A 300-year-old scallion spirit contains a lot of spirit energy—ordinary people would be overwhelmed by it.”

**Book Mountain Pressure Is Heavy:** “What happens when they’re overwhelmed?”

Drunken Moon Scholar: “When overwhelmed… they die spectacularly! There are all sorts of ways to die; you’d better not try it out of curiosity.”

Scholar Song: “…”

Who in their right mind would even consider trying something like that out of curiosity?

Drunken Moon Scholar continued: “I also suspect that cultivators need to be cautious when eating this ‘300-year-old scallion spirit stir-fry.’ If they’re affected by the spirit energy inside, it could lead to serious issues.”

Scholar Song sighed—he wouldn’t want to eat it even if someone offered it to him. Just thinking about how the scallion spirit could transform into a delicate girl made it impossible for him to go through with it.

He wasn’t a monster, and he definitely didn’t have a taste for eating people.

—He really needed to get rid of this plate of stir-fry. While he felt terrible about wasting his mother’s culinary skills, it was for the best to toss it!

Just then, Wild Blade of Three Tides piped up: “Scholar Song, are you selling that 300-year-old scallion root? I’m collecting ingredients for the Snow Fairy’s ‘Celestial Feast,’ and your 300-year-old scallion spirit might come in handy.”

“…” Scholar Song fell silent for a moment, then replied: “Senior, that wouldn’t be right. A 300-year-old scallion spirit has cultivated for so long to take human form and gain intelligence. I feel guilty about sending her off to the Celestial Feast to be made into a dish for someone to eat. After all, she is a life form.”

Once Scholar Song sent that message, the group fell silent for a while.

“Wait!” Wild Blade of Three Tides sent a blood-splattering emoji: “You just said that your scallion spirit has gained intelligence? She can transform into a human?”

“Three-hundred-year-old scallion spirit transformed into a human?” Hermit of North River quickly followed up with a question.

“If she’s already transformed into a human, with your strength, why would you still be able to capture her? And she ended up being made into scallion stir-fry?” Drunken Moon Scholar chimed in.

“That’s impossible, right? Were you perhaps enchanted by the spirit energy radiating from the scallion spirit? For plant-type spirits, even after 300 years, they mostly accumulate spirit energy, but can’t even gain intelligence,” Master of Snow Wolf Cavern expressed his surprise.

Seeing the group’s overwhelming responses, Scholar Song was puzzled: “Is it really strange for a scallion spirit to transform into a human?”

At this moment, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain spoke up: “Scholar Song, let me fill you in on some common knowledge. I’ll use an example: Dou Dou should be right next to you, right? Its cultivation level is at the pinnacle of the fourth rank, just one step away from forming its ‘Spirit Core,’ which is equivalent to a human cultivator’s Golden Core. For any spirit, without a Spirit Core, it’s impossible to transform into a human! It’s difficult for animal spirits, let alone plant-type spirits that start without any intelligence!”

“Your scallion spirit is peculiar.” The Alchemical Sage slowly typed out his reply.

Wild Blade of Three Tides speculated: “Let’s try replanting her and see if there’s something special about her. Perhaps… she has some hidden treasures!”

Hermit of North River agreed: “Or maybe this scallion spirit possesses an ancient bloodline?”

The group buzzed with chatter as Scholar Song pocketed his phone.

He picked up the plate of Scallion Lamb Stir-fry, and after some thought, he gritted his teeth and headed toward the kitchen trash can to dump it.

At this point, there was no other option but to waste Mother Song’s culinary skills and the 300-year-old ‘scallion spirit.’

Just as he opened the trash can, preparing to throw the lamb stir-fry away, he suddenly heard footsteps approaching from outside—Mother Song was quickly making her way to the kitchen.

Scholar Song’s hand froze mid-action!

The kitchen door had two transparent floor-to-ceiling glass doors, and if he tossed the lamb stir-fry into the trash, Mother Song would see it from afar!

If that happened, he’d better come up with a good excuse, or Mother Song would surely blow up.

What to do?

Scholar Song’s mind raced.

At this moment, Mother Song pushed open the glass door: “Scholar Song, did you find the scallion roots?”

Scholar Song gritted his teeth, opened his mouth, and quickly shoved the entire plate of scallion lamb stir-fry into his mouth.

Just as Mother Song finished asking the question… Scholar Song had already swallowed the entire plate of stir-fry!

Mother Song: “…”

“Mom, this dish is delicious! I accidentally finished it all! Hahaha, it’s that good, I couldn’t save any for Dad and the others,” Scholar Song exclaimed, giving a thumbs up.

Mother Song was left speechless, playfully flicking his forehead.

“Hehe.” Scholar Song forced a silly smile and seized the chance to escape the kitchen, sprinting towards his room. He would find a way to puke it out before it digested…

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Once back in his room, Scholar Song shut the door and tried to induce vomiting in an attempt to get rid of the ‘Scallion Lamb Stir-fry’ as quickly as possible.

However, as he attempted to vomit, he was left dumbstruck.

He couldn’t do it—not at all.

It felt like his body had completely forgotten the concept of ‘vomiting.’ No matter how much he struggled, there was no response.

At the same time, he felt a warm sensation spreading through his stomach.

It felt like drinking hot soup in the dead of winter, the warmth radiating from his stomach down to his lower abdomen. Recalling what the seniors had said about the ‘300-year-old scallion spirit stir-fry,’ Scholar Song wondered if he was really in trouble.

Had his life script flipped to the wrong page recently?

Taking a deep breath, Scholar Song returned to the side of the bed.

On the bed, Venerable White remained completely still, still in meditation. If only Venerable White were awake, he could easily resolve his current crisis.

But for now, it was up to him to figure this out.

Scholar Song crossed his legs and sat down at the bedside, closing his eyes to begin practicing the “True Self Meditation Method,” hoping to digest the strange energy spreading from his stomach.

……

……

“Hahaha, you think you can eat me and spit me out? Not a chance!” At that moment, the scallion spirit in Scholar Song’s pocket was laughing triumphantly. 

Being seized by Mother Song and sliced for cooking was an accident… but when she realized Mother Song was wielding the Bone-Cutting Blade to cut her, a brilliant idea sparked in her mind.
