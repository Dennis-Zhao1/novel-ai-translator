My Life, Did I Accidentally Hit the Fast-Forward Button?

Jiu Deng Gu Niang was completely on the verge of a breakdown.

Why on earth am I crying like a sobbing mess, curled up in bed? What kind of wish is this? Why did my teenage self think so far ahead? Why? Why is this happening?

Where's my youthful heart? What happened to my youthful heart? This is totally a middle-aged woman’s heart! No, it’s practically a mother’s heart or a grandmother’s heart! It has nothing to do with a youthful heart at all!

Jiu Deng Gu Niang's head slammed down onto the table again and again, thud after thud.

The solid table couldn’t withstand the assault and developed cracks… and finally, with a loud crash, it collapsed!

Scholar Song sat silently with his mouth shut, watching Jiu Deng Gu Niang throw a fit, not daring to say a word to stop her.

With bits of debris scattered around her, Jiu Deng Gu Niang lifted her head, staring at Scholar Song—am I really supposed to marry him and have two little troublemakers?

How could this be? How can we even have kids with such a gender difference?

What do I do about this wish?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Bang! Bang! Bang…

Suddenly, the sound of firecrackers exploded in Scholar Song’s ears, creating a lively atmosphere.

Huh? What’s happening?

Blinking in confusion, Scholar Song found himself sitting in front of a mirror.

Around him, several makeup artists were busy applying makeup, various powders being unceremoniously patted onto his face.

To his right, there was a row of formal suits, and he himself was also dressed in a sleek black tuxedo…

Behind him stood his smiling mother and his father, who looked proud and content.

—What is happening here?

“Finally, it’s time for Shu Hang to get married,” his mother said, tears of joy in her eyes as she dabbed at her cheeks.

“It hasn’t been easy, sigh, dear, why are you crying again? Today is our son’s big day; wipe those tears away so no one sees you and laughs,” his father said in a hushed voice.

What? Getting married??

Is there something wrong with my ears? Why am I suddenly getting married?

Wait a second, let me sort through my memories!

…

…

Scholar Song vaguely remembered being with Tu Bo, Gao something, and the Zhuge siblings? The Lu sisters, heading to a vacation island in Donghai.

Then, midway, the plane had an accident. After that, the crashed plane took them to a mysterious island, and then… whoa, all memories of what happened on the mysterious island were gone.

Was my memory sealed?

Furrowing his brow, Scholar Song pondered—no memory at all means it must have been sealed!

Well, even if I’ve lost my memories of the mysterious island… what’s going on in front of me now?

Why am I getting makeup? And what was my mom saying about getting married?

Are you kidding me? I haven’t even been in a relationship yet; why am I skipping straight to marriage?

Could it be that I accidentally hit the fast-forward button on my life?

Something must be wrong.

Scholar Song immediately thought of the “Ninefold Land Group.” Where’s my phone? I need to check in with my seniors to find out what’s going on.

As he was lost in thought, he continued to overhear his parents’ conversation.

“I’m just so moved,” his mother said.

She wiped her tears and continued, “Ever since Shu Hang went out with friends four years ago and the plane crash happened, he’s been so dazed and confused. He’s been like this for four years now. I’ve been so worried, watching the boys next door get married and start families while our Shu Hang might not even get a wife. It breaks my heart; I can’t sleep at night.”

What? Four years? I’ve been out of the mysterious island for four years?

And I’ve been dazed this entire time?

Could it be that when I came out of the mysterious island, something went wrong when I sealed my memories, and I accidentally became a fool for four years?

This is terrifying; I’ve been a fool for four years!

His mother choked up, “But I never imagined that the dazed Shu Hang from four years ago would somehow manage to get a girlfriend. And this girl doesn’t mind that he’s a fool; she’s willing to marry him. I’m so happy; if only Shu Hang could wake up from this daze now, that would be even better, sob sob…”

Scholar Song: “…”

Four years ago, I got a girlfriend? Who is she willing to marry me?

Scholar Song’s mind raced, recalling the girls he had interacted with four years ago.

First, there was Lu Fei, who was the first to confess to him. But the chances of her marrying the dazed version of himself were slim; their relationship wasn’t that close yet.

Then there was Fay Yu, whom he hoped it would be… but that was unlikely. She only saw Scholar Song as a passionate senior in the “Ninefold Land Group,” a kind-hearted person who helped her. They had only met twice, hardly enough for any romantic feelings.

Next was Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan. Like Fay Yu, they had only met a few times. But the relationship between Sable Sixteen and Scholar Song was slightly more complicated than that with Fay Yu. However, the chances were still low. The Tianhe Su Clan was a powerful family, not weaker than top sects like the Wuji Demon Sect. It wouldn’t be easy for Sable Sixteen to marry someone, let alone a dazed Scholar Song.

Besides these three girls, he also had Mistress Scallion, who would probably prefer to bite him rather than marry him! She might even wish for Scholar Song to drop dead sooner.

Wait, what about Venerable White? Where did he go?

Could it be that even Venerable White couldn’t help me break this memory loss and had to leave?

Did Venerable White leave me any messages?

This is such a headache… losing four years of memories.

Just then, Scholar Song’s father approached and pulled him up, now dressed in his formal attire.

“Let’s go, son. Today is your big day. Remember, don’t make a scene,” his father said, patting him on the shoulder and guiding him downstairs.

Scholar Song forced a smile and followed his father down.

…

…

The wedding venue was set in a grand cathedral in Wenzhou City.

That’s right, Scholar Song wasn’t mistaken; it was that magnificent cathedral. Very famous in Wenzhou City, many couples choose to have their weddings in that spectacular place.

But Scholar Song felt a strange sense of disconnection about having his wedding in a cathedral.

…

…

In a daze, Scholar Song was led by his father to the wedding car, arriving at the cathedral.

As he stepped out of the wedding car, he saw a crowd gathered near the cathedral.

There were the grown-up versions of Tu Bo, Gao, Yang De, and others, along with Zhuge Zhongyang, Zhuge Yue, and the Lu sisters. It was clear that the bride was not Lu Fei.

In addition to his college friends, there were also some childhood buddies, neighbors, and many relatives.

When they saw Shu Hang, his friends and family showered him with sincere wishes!

Walking down the long red carpet, his father led Scholar Song into the cathedral. Because of Scholar Song’s unique situation, his father had to guide him.

Upon entering the enormous cathedral, Scholar Song could see even more friends and family inside.

At the same time, a woman in a pure white wedding dress approached him, accompanied by a middle-aged man.

She wore a white veil that was quite special—not transparent at all, but a white scarf adorned with strings of pearls that completely obscured her face, making it impossible for Scholar Song to see her features.

Although he couldn’t see her face, the woman had an incredible figure, boasting a perfect hourglass shape—where she should be big, she was big, and where she should be slim, she was slim.

With a figure like that, as long as she didn’t look terrible, she’d definitely be considered a beauty.

Who could she be?

Scholar Song was extremely curious… who was this woman, willing to marry him, the fool, after four years?

Or could it be that he had become the “rebound guy” of a hero?

As the woman reached him, Scholar Song contained his curiosity, extending his hand, just like a proper groom, and took her hand from the middle-aged man, gently holding her arm.

His mother was overwhelmed with emotion, tears streaming down her face with joy.

His father also wore a satisfied expression.

…

…

The wedding march began.

Ding—ding ding ding~~ ding—ding ding ding~~

Scholar Song held the delicate hand of his bride, and they slowly approached the officiant.

Perhaps due to Scholar Song’s special situation, the officiant didn’t waste any time with small talk. There were no classic questions like, “Do you promise to love her in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer?” 

Nor did he ask, “Do you take him as your husband?” or “Do you take her as your wife?”

The officiant opened with a prayer, holding the Bible, blessing the newlyweds with a lifetime of love and companionship…

As soon as the prayer ended, the ceremony shifted straight to exchanging rings.

Everything was kept simple.

Scholar Song held back his curiosity as he exchanged rings with his bride.

The large diamond sparkled brightly on their fingers.

Yet, even at that moment, Scholar Song felt an overwhelming sense of unreality. His feelings could be summed up in one sentence—holy hell, I’m getting married just like this!

“May God bless you both,” the officiant proclaimed loudly to the couple.

Next came the most important moment.

Scholar Song reached out, gently lifting the bride’s pearl-adorned veil—let me see who is marrying the fool that I’ve been for four years!
