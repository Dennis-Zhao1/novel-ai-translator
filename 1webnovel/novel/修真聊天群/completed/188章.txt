**The Master’s Disciple is a Grandmaster**

In the morning, Scholar Song completed his exam effortlessly.

Taking advantage of his free time, he opened the Ninefold Land One group chat to see what was happening.

Scrolling through the chat history, he came across a selfie posted by Fairy Lychee—absolutely stunning, of course. It seemed she had just moved into a new cave residence, as she had shared several selfies, each more beautiful than the last.

Beneath her posts, the other seniors in the group were showering her with likes and compliments. 

However, ever since the Hermit of North River and the Wild Blade of Three Tides had stopped participating, the Ninefold Land One group had become considerably quieter over the past few days.

As soon as Scholar Song logged on, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain noticed him.

“Scholar Song, how is Venerable White doing lately?” the Immortal Sage quickly inquired.

“All good, everything is fine,” Scholar Song replied, but his mind immediately flickered back to the grueling experience he had in the desert yesterday. “Though, after Venerable White ascended to the seventh rank of Spiritual Sovereign, he gained this skill called ‘Real Illusion.’ It’s seriously amazing, like, off the charts!”

The Immortal Sage sent an emoji that expressed exasperation.

Lately, he had felt a pang of sympathy whenever he conversed with Scholar Song, as it seemed like the younger cultivator was constantly living in a state of turmoil. 

…

…

Meanwhile, far away, the Alchemical Sage calmly closed his phone.

As soon as Scholar Song logged in, he had intended to say something, checking in on how things were and mentioning that he might return soon. However, he was a slow writer…

Just as he was halfway through his message, Scholar Song mentioned Venerable White’s new skill, prompting the Alchemical Sage to hastily delete his unfinished message.

He then quietly resumed lurking in the chat, pretending he hadn’t seen Scholar Song’s arrival.

After putting his phone away, the Alchemical Sage called out, “Is Purple Smoke here?”

“I’ve been here all along,” came the soft voice of Jiang Ziyan from downstairs.

At that moment, she was staring blankly at a computer screen, which displayed the Alchemical Sage cautiously closing his phone. Yes, Jiang Ziyan had installed a high-tech camera in the Alchemical Sage's room, and she had cast several spells on it to ensure that he wouldn’t notice it for the time being.

With a disciple like her, the Alchemical Sage certainly had his hands full, in more ways than one.

“We're expecting a guest shortly—a friend of mine from long ago. Could you go grab some snacks and fetch that jar of fine ‘Immortal Brew’ we have?” the Alchemical Sage instructed.

“Immortal Brew?” Jiang Ziyan nodded slightly. This was a precious medicinal wine that the Alchemical Sage usually wouldn’t indulge in, so it seemed that this friend held a significant place in his heart.

“Is it a man or a woman?” Jiang Ziyan pressed, emphasizing the importance of the answer.

“A man!” the Alchemical Sage replied coolly—he was already used to such inquiries and answered promptly.

“Got it! I’ll take care of it quickly.” Jiang Ziyan closed her computer and responded.

…

…

Soon enough, the Alchemical Sage's friend arrived.

He was an ethereal-looking man, with a youthful appearance despite his white hair. Dressed in Taoist robes, he carried a feather duster in one hand. Now recognized as an official Taoist in Middle Land, he was free to wear his robes openly.

Upon entering, he boomed with laughter. “Alchemical Sage, the old Taoist is here!”

The Alchemical Sage welcomed him with open arms, giving his friend a warm embrace.

As they sat down, Jiang Ziyan sweetly stepped forward to pour drinks for both of them. In the presence of outsiders, she always made sure to give the Alchemical Sage full respect, playing the role of a well-behaved disciple.

“Immortal Brew, your favorite, Wuyinzi.” The Alchemical Sage raised his cup, clinking it gently with Wuyinzi.

“Ha, only here can I taste your Immortal Brew,” Wuyinzi said with a satisfied expression.

After a few rounds of drinks, Wuyinzi’s slightly tipsy demeanor emerged. “Alchemical Sage, you still look young, while I’m really feeling my age now.”

The Alchemical Sage’s hand stiffened slightly as he let out a soft sigh.

Though Wuyinzi and the Alchemical Sage were of the same generation, in terms of cultivation talent, Wuyinzi was actually superior. However, many years ago, Wuyinzi had suffered a grave injury that severely affected his foundation, significantly reducing his lifespan.

His cultivation had stagnated at the fourth rank for centuries, and if he couldn’t find a way to advance soon, he might be nearing the end of his life.

“No need to lament for me; I’ve long since grown accustomed to it,” Wuyinzi laughed heartily, then motioned towards Jiang Ziyan, who was serving drinks. “Your disciple, Miss Ziyan, is quite well-behaved.”

Jiang Ziyan smiled proudly.

The Alchemical Sage chuckled along in agreement.

“My newly accepted disciple, on the other hand, often drives me to the brink of wanting to slap him!” Wuyinzi’s expression turned sour when he mentioned his own disciple.

“Wait, you accepted a disciple?” The Alchemical Sage asked, puzzled.

“Oh, about ten years ago. I finally found a suitable successor to inherit my teachings,” Wuyinzi reminisced. “You know my situation; I’ve been searching for someone to take over for a long time. With my time running out, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity and accepted him as my disciple without hesitation.”

“Without hesitation?” The Alchemical Sage raised an eyebrow. “What’s so peculiar about this disciple?”

“Well… he’s a Westerner. But since becoming my disciple, he has settled down in Middle Land,” Wuyinzi said, a hint of nostalgia in his tone.

“It's a bit odd, considering we’ve never had a Westerner as a disciple before. But your situation is unique, so I suppose everyone can understand,” the Alchemical Sage nodded thoughtfully.

Still, even if he were a Westerner, it shouldn’t warrant Wuyinzi’s frustration, right?

“I accepted him as a registered disciple, intending to teach him some techniques to establish his foundation. You know what he said?” Wuyinzi downed his drink in one go. “That fool said: ‘Isn’t martial arts from Middle Land all about Shaolin? I want to learn Shaolin martial arts! The Golden Bell Shield, Iron Shirt, and the Seventy-Two Shaolin Secret Techniques!’”

The Alchemical Sage’s face twitched in disbelief.

“I was furious and gave that fool a good beating! I’m a Taoist, for crying out loud!” Wuyinzi gritted his teeth.

“But you know what? After I beat him, that fool went straight to the barbershop that very night and shaved his head bald, proudly returning to me—imagine this, a Taoist from my sect with a Western monk’s appearance! If it weren't for my reputation, the sect members would have kicked him out by now!”

“To ensure my teachings are passed on, I tolerated it. I worked hard to help him establish his foundation. After much effort, he finally completed it. Then, I officially held a ceremony to accept him as my personal disciple. You won’t believe what that fool asked for next—he wanted me to brand him with the monk's scar! He said all serious disciples need one, right?”

“A scar? Have you ever seen Taoists with scars?”

“In the end, I had to endure that fool pestering me for a whole year! I was so frustrated that I ended up branding him with four scars,” Wuyinzi said, exasperated. 

When he reached this part of the story, his expression was one of utter despair. “But then he said: ‘Monks in movies always have six scars! You have to give me two more!’”

“I was livid and beat him again.”

“And then… the next day, that fool went and branded himself with two more! I gave him another thrashing!”

“That would have been fine… After he finally reached the third aperture realm, I couldn't handle his antics anymore and held a ceremony to send him down the mountain. Normally, our sect requires a third rank in cultivation to leave, but my junior brother was also at his wit's end with this guy, so we hastily arranged the ceremony. I even prepared a Taoist robe and protective talismans for him.”

“But that fool… on the very day he left, he wore a layer of monk’s robes over his Taoist garb! And secretly swapped out the flying sword for a shabby Vajra Pestle! It drove me insane! I beat him again!”

“Years later, I went to visit him again. That fool had even learned some Buddhist scriptures! He somehow got his hands on the ‘Earth Store Soul Saving Sutra’ and was helping lost souls, accumulating a ton of merit light.”

“If you didn’t know his foundation, anyone would think he was a disciple of the Buddhist sect! I’ve lost all face to bring him back to my sect!” Wuyinzi poured himself another glass.

This disciple was practicing both Taoism and Buddhism? Internal cultivation of Taoism, external cultivation of Buddhism?

Hearing the end of the story, the Alchemical Sage’s lips twitched in disbelief.

Could there really be such an absurd coincidence in this world? He recalled Scholar Song mentioning a certain Western monk who had taken the blame for a murder and was honorably arrested on the train...

That monk couldn’t possibly be the disciple of his old friend, could he?

Realizing this, the Alchemical Sage cautiously inquired, “Wuyinzi, where is that foolish disciple of yours now?”

“He got himself thrown in jail not long ago,” Wuyinzi gritted his teeth in frustration. “Somehow, he ended up in prison. As soon as I learned of it, I used my connections to get him out. But that fool has grown so fond of it there that he refuses to leave! He said he wants to wait until he finishes ascending to the second rank before coming out. It drives me insane! When he finally gets out, I’m going to catch him and give him a good beating for ten days and nights!”

The Alchemical Sage tilted his head back, putting on an exaggerated sigh—he couldn’t help it. If he didn’t look up, he was afraid he might burst out laughing in front of his friend; that would be too rude.

Without a doubt, this old friend’s disciple was the very same Western monk that Scholar Song had spoken about.

What a coincidence—

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Time flew by, and another exam day had come to an end.

Scholar Song returned home, cautiously opening the door.

He didn’t step inside immediately; instead, he leaned in to peek inside, feeling relieved to see everything was normal in the backyard.

Then, he carefully entered halfway, gripping the door tightly with one hand.

After confirming that all was well, he finally felt at ease to step fully into the house.

“Scholar Song, you’re back!” Venerable White stood in the small courtyard, seemingly waiting for Scholar Song’s return.

Scholar Song froze for a moment before smiling, “Venerable, didn’t you practice today?”

“I already finished my training,” Venerable White replied with a smile. “Scholar Song, what techniques have you learned? You’ve been a bother for me these past few days, so let me guide you in your cultivation today!”

Hearing this, Scholar Song’s heart soared with joy!
