**My Kirin Arm Is Faintly Heating Up! (Combined Chapter)**

Scholar Song’s luck was pretty good; upon awakening his mouth acupoint, he had gained a unique talent!

When the acupoints of the eyes, nose, ears, and mouth are opened, every cultivator can at least receive one talent, while the lucky ones might receive talents from two acupoints. If the talents are particularly powerful, they can be used for a lifetime.

Like the eye acupoint, the mouth acupoint talents also come in various forms. There are talents like "Tongue Blossoming," "Lips Like Swords," aggressive sound waves, and even the ability to shoot divine light from one's mouth to defeat enemies.

Scholar Song’s talent from the mouth acupoint was quite special, classified as a sound wave talent—**Illusionary Sound**.

By manipulating sound, he could induce certain illusions in those who heard it.

“Roar~~” As Scholar Song unleashed his final roar of the **Lion's Roar Technique**, it was automatically accompanied by the talent ‘Illusionary Sound.’

The lion’s roar thundered like rolling thunder and carried an enchanting ability.

Below, the black-skirted girl, Chuchu, along with Whale Eight and Shark Nine, were all affected by the Lion’s Roar and the Illusionary Sound.

Chuchu, already in a semi-dazed state, under the influence of the Illusionary Sound, seemed to see the road to the underworld unfolding before her. Was she about to die?

Meanwhile, Whale Eight and Shark Nine felt their heads spinning, as if chaotic images were flashing before their eyes like a revolving lantern.

This was because Scholar Song had just awakened his mouth acupoint talent; he couldn’t fully control the ‘Illusionary Sound’ yet. For those with strong willpower, its effects were minimal.

However, when paired with the **Lion’s Roar Technique**, even second-grade cultivators would be affected, showcasing the high practicality of this mouth acupoint talent.

In a life-or-death battle, if Scholar Song suddenly roared while using Illusionary Sound, it might very well turn the tide.

...

...

After a moment, the lion's roar ceased, and the effects of the Illusionary Sound faded.

Chuchu looked blankly at the sky, “Isn’t this an illusion? Are there really whales flying in the sky?”

Whale Eight and Shark Nine shook their heads vigorously, their inner energy surging as they broke free from the effects of the Illusionary Sound. They too raised their heads to gaze at the sky.

Then, both felt a chill running down their spines.

Their eyes first fell upon the enormous whale descending from above, and being second-grade true masters, they had sharp eyesight and quickly discerned the wooden sword beneath the whale’s belly.

The sword looked simple, but its sword energy was rampant, sharp beyond compare.

Flying with a sword?

Could this be a great whale demon that had mastered the technique of flying with a sword?

At that moment, the two had no time to think further and swiftly swam forward—no matter what the huge whale was, it seemed to be diving into the ocean.

They were right beneath it; if they didn’t run, were they just going to wait to be crushed by its massive body?

Thanks to the large whale, Whale Eight loosened his grip on Chuchu’s arms, preventing her from being crushed directly and allowing her a breath of air.

...

...

In the blink of an eye.

The whale, propelled by the **One-Time Flying Sword Version 004**, crashed into the ocean before Scholar Song.

“Boo～ Boo Boo Boo～” The whale cried out in panic.

Boom! Crash! Water splashed everywhere, waves crashing out in all directions.

If it hadn’t been for the **One-Time Flying Sword** and the earlier levitation spell cast on it by Venerable White, the whale would have been smashed to pieces when hitting the water's surface.

Soon after, Scholar Song’s figure also plummeted toward the water.

“Green Wind Acceleration!” Just before hitting the water, Scholar Song quickly activated his **Green Wind Acceleration** talisman.

A swirl of green wind enveloped him, wrapping around his body. With the buoyancy created by this green wind, Scholar Song’s descent slowed, and he ultimately landed gently in the ocean.

The Green Wind Acceleration talisman had been used three times already when he was on Heavenly Realm Island, consuming all its energy. The reason he could use it again was that a whole day had passed since his last activation.

Today was July 15, 2019, a Monday.

“Safe landing! Today, I’ve lived to see another day,” Scholar Song said as he emerged from the water, wiping the seawater from his face, his eyes slightly misty.

Living is truly wonderful...

As the massive whale dove into the sea, it swished its tail and instinctively plunged into the depths, sensing it needed to stay low for a while...

After the whale disappeared, a wooden sword floated on the water's surface, drifting toward Scholar Song.

Scholar Song casually grabbed the wooden sword, “Oh? One-Time Flying Sword Version 004?”

He was all too familiar with this type of wooden sword.

It belonged to Venerable White!

Could it be that this whale was sent here by Venerable White?

He gently touched his wrist, where a coordinate for the **Thousand Miles Escape Technique** was located, meaning Venerable White should be arriving soon.

After pondering for a moment, Scholar Song hung the **One-Time Flying Sword Version 004** onto his waist.

...

...

The waves stirred up from the whale's plunge finally calmed down.

Once the surface of the sea settled, Scholar Song noticed three figures not far from him.

One was a gloomy man with shark teeth.

The second was a tall, sturdy man with a silly grin.

And the third was a black-skirted girl who was being tightly held by the tall man, struggling fiercely...

What a bizarre combination.

It looked like two big men were trying to bully a weak girl?

But soon, Scholar Song sensed the faint fluctuations of true energy from the three. Having opened his acupoints, he was now at the peak of the first-grade, about to enter the realm of the Dragon Gate. He could vaguely sense the aura of second-grade true masters around him.

All three in front of him were second-grade true masters.

By comparison, Scholar Song was the ‘weakest’ person present.

When did cultivators become so common? Even when he casually dropped from the sky, he encountered three cultivators?

Was it that upon leaving the mysterious island, he was intentionally brought to this location?

Regardless of whether the other party was friend or foe, without clarity, Scholar Song cautiously grasped a talisman from his pocket—his last **Sword Talisman**.

At the same time, his other hand clutched the treasured knife, Shattering Dominance. Aside from the talisman, the only weapon he had left capable of harming second-grade cultivators was the ‘Flame Knife’ from his ancient bronze ring.

As Scholar Song observed the others, they were also watching him closely.

Shark Nine immediately recognized Scholar Song’s cultivation level: “A first-grade cultivator.”

“We can’t let this get out of hand,” Whale Eight said slowly, pausing before adding, “So let’s kill him.”

What kind of logic is this? If we can’t let things escalate, shouldn’t we talk it out peacefully instead?

Scholar Song had no chance to voice this thought before Shark Nine let out a sinister laugh and lunged at him, his right palm slamming toward Scholar Song’s chest.

Shark Nine’s lips curled into a cruel smile, his sharp teeth making one shudder—if he bit down, it would hurt a lot.

Filled with killing intent, he attacked without hesitation.

“Are you a wicked villain?” Scholar Song sighed inwardly, raising the **Sword Talisman** with a steady hand, aiming it at Shark Nine, his fingers pressing down on the activation rune.

Shark Nine’s pupils constricted sharply.

Boom!

Just as he was charging toward Scholar Song, Shark Nine slapped the water’s surface hard, using the force of the impact to propel himself backward rapidly.

He then cautiously looked at Scholar Song. The moment he got close, he sensed a terrifying sense of crisis emanating from the other.

Ultimately, his gaze landed on the talisman in Scholar Song’s hands.

Talisman?!

What kind of talisman could evoke such a life-and-death crisis—one that was at least a third-grade attack talisman?

To be able to casually pull out a third-grade attack talisman... what a dangerous little guy.

Shark Nine licked his lips, but as long as he could eliminate this kid, the spoils would certainly be rich. His tiny eyes fixed on Scholar Song, waiting for the right moment to strike.

...

...

“Sword!” Scholar Song’s eyes darkened slightly, and without hesitation, he activated the **Sword Talisman**.

Although Shark Nine was retreating, he was still within the range of the talisman! In that case, Scholar Song wouldn’t hold back.

As the talisman activated, a phantom figure appeared behind Scholar Song. The figure stood proudly, looking down upon Shark Nine and Whale Eight.

The two immediately felt a heavy pressure, their bodies freezing like frogs caught in the gaze of a snake.

“Shark Nine, dodge!” Whale Eight shouted loudly.

But it was too late.

The phantom behind Scholar Song pointed like a sword, following his will, and struck toward Shark Nine with a single slash.

Brilliant sword light erupted, locking onto Shark Nine.

In Shark Nine’s eyes, it felt like the entire world had narrowed down to just that one sword, with nothing else in sight.

The terrifying sword energy made Shark Nine realize that if he were struck by this sword, he wouldn’t just lose his life—he’d be left with half of it at best.

Without hesitation, Shark Nine dove deep into the water, frantically slapping his palms in the sea. Nearly thirty water sharks shot from his hands, rushing toward the sword light.

Yet, the sword light flashed past, and the thirty water sharks couldn’t even touch it. The water sharks merely charged into the void, their true energy dissipating, returning to the sea.

And that sword light swiftly pierced through the thick water surface and struck Shark Nine.

“Ugh…” Shark Nine let out a cry of despair, bubbles escaping his mouth as blood stained the sea surface.

Ultimately, after struggling a few times, his body sank to the ocean floor, leaving his fate unknown.

...

...

“Talisman,” Whale Eight’s face darkened as he glared at Scholar Song.

In battles of life and death among cultivators, it’s not just about who has the higher cultivation level; it’s also about whose equipment is more formidable. A first-grade cultivator wielding a powerful talisman can easily take down a second-grade cultivator.

In fact, it wasn’t just a second-grade issue—when Scholar Song wielded Venerable White’s treasures, he even took down a fourth-grade cultivator.

“Hehe.” Scholar Song returned a gentle smile, casually pulling another talisman from his pocket, pointing it at Whale Eight, “That’s right, it’s a talisman. Are you not convinced?”

He wore a wealthy man's grin, the talisman in his hand exuding a faint third-grade aura—if you’re not convinced, then bring it on!

Whale Eight’s face darkened like water, his eyes fixed on Scholar Song.

Scholar Song narrowed his eyes and shook the talisman at Whale Eight again, “Let go of the girl in your arms, or I’ll let you taste the might of my talisman. Let me tell you, I have several more similar talismans!”

Though... those talismans were all **Demon-Repelling Talismans**.

Scholar Song’s target was the black-skirted girl.

She was also a second-grade cultivator, and if Whale Eight really let her go, with the healing technique from Scholar Song’s ancient bronze ring, she might regain her combat strength. At that point, she would be a second-grade true master, and with Scholar Song’s support, they could confront Whale Eight head-on.

That was the idea in Scholar Song's mind.

Unfortunately, life doesn’t always go as planned.

Whale Eight gritted his teeth but chose not to release Chuchu. He tightened his muscular arms, squeezing her fiercely.

Crack, crack, crack—an unbearable sound filled the air.

“Pfft…” Chuchu coughed up blood, several ribs fracturing under the pressure. The internal injuries were severe, with Whale Eight’s true energy rampaging through her body, damaging her meridians.

Chuchu’s vision blackened, and she fell completely unconscious as the disparity in strength proved too great.

“You’re asking for death,” Scholar Song shouted angrily.

“Ke ke, what’s there to fear about death?” Whale Eight sneered, “You think I am? I’m the top-ranked Whale Eight in my group. Even if I die, I will complete my mission first. The mission is more important than my life.”

Crack, crack, crack—Chuchu's body was being crushed in Whale Eight’s powerful embrace.

Blood sprayed from her mouth, staining Whale Eight.

“Hahaha!” Whale Eight laughed maniacally, relishing the feeling of squeezing the petite girl to death in his embrace. This euphoric sensation was addictive to him.

Three breaths later, the black-skirted girl was no longer breathing... Whale Eight tossed her into the sea like garbage.

Chuchu’s blood stained the ocean, her body slowly sinking to the bottom—much like Shark Nine, her fate was uncertain.

Whale Eight licked the blood from his face, grinning wickedly at Scholar Song, “Ke ke, what’s wrong, little guy? Aren’t you going to use that talisman to kill me?”

Scholar Song clenched his treasured knife, Shattering Dominance, remaining silent.

“Or is it that... the talisman in your hand isn’t an attack type?” Whale Eight burst into maniacal laughter, “Then what kind of talisman is it? Let me find out!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Whale Eight’s gigantic form lunged, leaping onto the water's surface.

The next moment, he utilized a light-footed technique to run atop the water, charging at Scholar Song with ferocity.

Boom, boom, boom—he came crashing like a bulldozer.

Scholar Song sighed inwardly, putting away the **Demon-Repelling Talismans**. The other party wasn’t a ghost cultivator; the talismans wouldn’t have much effect.

Instead, he also leaped onto the water’s surface, using the **Gentleman's Thousand Miles Journey** technique, the effects of **Green Wind Acceleration** still lingering, allowing him to rush across the ocean.

He wasn’t running away; he was charging straight at Whale Eight, twisting his wrist, activating the ‘Flame Knife’ skill on his ancient bronze ring.

Boom—the blade ignited in roaring flames.

Even without the talismans, Scholar Song was no longer the weak rookie cultivator at the mercy of others.

Moreover, the treasured knife, Shattering Dominance, was forged from the divine metal of the Thunder Pool, exceedingly sharp—capable of slicing through the flesh of a fourth-grade cultivator.

As long as he landed a hit, no matter how massive Whale Eight was, he wouldn’t have an easy time.

“Flame Knife? That kind of common knife technique can’t hurt me,” Whale Eight sneered, showing no fear of the flames on Scholar Song’s knife. He clenched his fist, a pair of heavy-duty steel gauntlets shimmering with large gemstones, undoubtedly a formidable magical weapon.

“Great Whale Shot!” Whale Eight’s fist swung out fiercely, true energy erupting, a phantom whale appearing around his fist.

Then, he bent down, smashing his fist down toward the Flame Knife—after all, he was so tall that he had to bend down to hit Scholar Song, tiring himself out.

Clang!

The Flame Knife met Whale Eight’s fist, and Scholar Song immediately felt an immense force reverberating through the knife, shattering the flames in an instant.

Scholar Song’s hands were torn, blood spraying as he nearly dropped Shattering Dominance!

But that was just the initial clash.

Following that, the whale phantom on Whale Eight's fist surged forth, the true energy manifesting as a fist shadow, breaking through the flame knife's aura and crashing toward Scholar Song’s chest.

Boom!

Scholar Song was sent flying, crashing back into the water.

“Hiss.” The seawater stung his wounds, causing a sharp pain.

A golden little shield shattered on his chest.

Ultimately, that last punch was only countered by the golden shield, a skill from the Phantom Spirit. Since he had run out of protective talismans, this little spirit had saved Scholar Song’s life numerous times.

“A normal second-grade true master is terrifying,” Scholar Song murmured. How lucky was he to have taken down the weak state of the altar master back then?

The gap between him and second-grade true masters was vast, particularly in terms of vital energy and true energy; it was like the difference between water and ice. Vital energy couldn’t withstand true energy—once they made contact, it was as difficult to stop an ice pillar from piercing through as it was for ordinary water to resist.

“Weak, too weak,” Whale Eight sneered. “Now, let me send you off with my loving embrace. Come, let me hug you tightly, and in that wonderful creaking sound, I’ll send you to reincarnation.”

“No, I really don’t want to die in the embrace of a big man. At least let it be a beautiful woman,” Scholar Song retorted with a grin.

His eyes were calm, betraying no trace of fear.

“Hehehe, the weak have no choice,” Whale Eight laughed sinisterly, edging closer to Scholar Song—though inside, he was entirely on guard, this kid looked calm; he might pull out some strange item.

“You’re right, the weak have no choice—so watch closely, I’ll show you my true ultimate skill.” Scholar Song rolled up his sleeve, revealing a distinctive emblem: “My Kirin Arm is already faintly heating up!”

“Kirin Arm?” Whale Eight stared at Scholar Song's arm.

A thin arm, paler than a girl’s, bore a three-dimensional image of a gourd boy?

It was a gourd boy! This image stirred memories of good times from over twenty years ago for Whale Eight.

But what on earth does this have to do with the Kirin Arm?

As he pondered, Whale Eight saw the gourd boy image on Scholar Song's arm glow faintly with red light.

“Experience the taste of despair!” Scholar Song declared solemnly, his expression cryptic, “Then, take a good look at this beautiful world, for… this might be your last chance to appreciate its beauty.”

Damn it… it’s really not easy to buy some time. Thankfully, the moment was finally ripe.

His ultimate skill was about to be unleashed—**[Ding~~ Your friend, Venerable White, has logged in.]**

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

**Elsewhere.**

Venerable White held the little monk in one hand and Doudou in the other. He was enveloped in the glow of the **Thousand Miles Escape Technique**, heading quickly toward Scholar Song’s coordinates—somewhere in the East Sea.

Upon realizing that Scholar Song had returned from the mysterious island, Venerable White wasted no time activating the **Thousand Miles Escape Technique**.

As he soared through the skies, Venerable White felt a bit bored.

“How about I take this opportunity to meditate?” he thought to himself.

But then he remembered he was holding Doudou and the little monk, so he decided against it. If he meditated, he couldn’t take care of these two.

Thus, Venerable White extended six arms from behind him, a skill he had cultivated after advancing to the Venerable rank—**Eight-Armed Dharma Manifestation**.

From the extra six arms, he pulled out two smartphones from his pocket and started swiping on one of them.

However, it seemed he didn’t have any signal.

Without panic, Venerable White pulled out an antenna-like contraption from the phone case.

In the next moment, his phone regained signal.

This was a phone that Venerable White had secretly modified seventy times before finally succeeding. Although it looked like an ordinary smartphone from the outside, the internal modifications were numerous.

Venerable White entered the **Ninefold Land Group** and started scrolling.

Today, the Alchemical Sage had posted a few messages: “@Su Clan A Seven, A Seven, are you still looking for trouble with the Wuji Demon Sect? Have you pushed down a few branches?”

Su Clan A Seven replied: “A few days ago, I got a branch master-level disciple from Scholar Song. I managed to extract some useful information from him. I’m preparing to push down another branch.”

The Alchemical Sage responded: “That’s great! If you have time, bring me over a few dozen disciples from the Wuji Demon Sect, around second to third grade. I want to use them for a few experiments to see if there’s a way to break the seal on Sanlang’s memories on the mysterious island—P.S.: Jiang Ziyan is a substitute.” That mischievous girl, always getting into trouble.

Su Clan A Seven replied: “[Sweating profusely] Elder Alchemist, are you joking? It’s already a challenge to get ten second or third-grade disciples from a branch of the Wuji Demon Sect, let alone all alive!”

The Alchemical Sage replied: “So pitiful. Fine, I’ll take whatever you can get. Additionally, to the other friends in the group, if you encounter any hostile cultivators, just grab any second or third-grade ones alive. They’re valuable!”

Master Tongxuan sent a message with a monk praying followed by a series of nodding emojis.

The Alchemical Sage replied: “Got it! If I find any, I’ll grab them for you. Besides, A Seven, I have a clue about the Wuji Demon Sect. If I get the chance, I’ll collaborate with your Tianhe Su Clan.”

After sending the message, Venerable White put away his phone.

The **Thousand Miles Escape Technique** was getting closer.
