**Chapter 1: Struggles on the Rooftop**

Lin Tao knew that his time at school would eventually come to an end. He couldn't shake the thought that if that towering guy ever caught up with him, he might just want to show him a fist the size of a cooking pot. Lin Tao could already picture himself, before experiencing that fist's impact, booking a hospital bed with a view, somewhere familiar, where the air flowed freely and the scenery was nice.

With that thought weighing on him, he felt a surge of defeat wash over him. He could only force a bitter smile and rush to the rooftop with Scholar Song and Nan Haomeng.

Behind them, his roommates were curious but intimidated by Nan Haomeng’s hulking presence. They dared not ask questions, fearful of getting caught up in Lin Tao's troubles. They wanted to help, but felt powerless to do anything.

...

Just like in Scholar Song's dorm, the rooftop door here was locked, and Scholar Song didn't have the key...

But it didn’t matter; this wasn’t his dorm.

With wide eyes from both Nan Haomeng and Lin Tao, Scholar Song casually grabbed the door lock and yanked it. The lock, along with the screws holding it in place, came off effortlessly.

It was as though he was pulling a leaf from a tree.

This was beyond mere strength; he was practically a human Tyrannosaurus Rex.

Lin Tao couldn’t help but shiver.

Stepping onto the rooftop, Scholar Song's voice turned serious. “Now, tell me, who asked you to investigate my background?”

“I don’t know that guy!” Lin Tao forced a smile, realizing Scholar Song was starting with the very question he dreaded most. He had no idea who had asked him!

As soon as he finished speaking, he noticed Scholar Song’s expression darken.

In a panic, Lin Tao scrambled to remember. “Wait, I think I can remember what he looked like. He was about a head taller than me, around 1.83 meters; um, he was lean with long arms. They looked disproportionately long, almost like a gibbon. I couldn’t see his whole face because he was wearing a pair of big sunglasses. His lips were really thick, kind of like swollen sausages.”

“That’s all?” Scholar Song's face was like a volcano ready to erupt.

“Wait, there’s more! Even though he tried to disguise his accent while speaking, I could still tell; it sounded like he came from around City J and the Jiangnan region. I used to live there as a kid, so I’m quite sensitive to their accent.” Lin Tao said hurriedly.

City J and the nearby Jiangnan region referred to the Luoxin district.

Was it really related to the 'Phantom Spirit'? Scholar Song's mind started piecing things together.

“Other than that, I don’t know much else. And I didn’t reveal too much about you—just your residence, a few friends, and some immediate family. That info is all public knowledge among your classmates and can be found on the campus network. I couldn’t dig up anything else. Oh, right… this is the payment that man gave me; I’m returning it all to you…” Lin Tao anxiously fished out a wad of red bills from his pocket, hoping to appease Scholar Song.

Seeing the pile of cash, the last strand of Scholar Song’s composure snapped.

All that for this small amount of money? That guy had handed over his details to a complete stranger, putting his life in danger. If this wasn’t resolved quickly, even his loved ones would be at risk.

How infuriating!

Scholar Song grabbed Lin Tao by the collar, yanking him forward, and his right fist swung down hard, landing a solid blow to Lin Tao's face.

This was a forbidden technique in martial arts known as the Friendship Break Face Punch!

Lin Tao flew backward, blood spattering from his mouth, mingling with scattered teeth.

His already battered face quickly swelled up.

Scholar Song had held back most of his strength; otherwise, a single punch in his fury could have left Lin Tao severely injured, bedridden, and unable to care for himself.

Now, with just a few broken teeth and a swollen face, this was Scholar Song’s restrained outcome.

Lin Tao gasped in pain, weeping softly. The sight of his swollen face and missing teeth made his cries sound odd and muffled.

“From now on, it’s best to erase all thoughts about me from your mind. Otherwise, next time, it won’t just be a punch,” Scholar Song said, wiping the blood from his knuckles. “As for your face and teeth, you’ll have to figure out how to explain those. Say you fell, or that you got into a fight. Just don’t associate with me anymore. I hope I don't have to see you again.”

There wouldn’t be a next time. If there were, Scholar Song couldn’t guarantee he wouldn’t act even more recklessly. Even a Buddha could only endure so much, right?

With that, Scholar Song and Nan Haomeng turned to leave.

Lin Tao remained on the rooftop, crying, as the red bills scattered across the ground. He wondered if this money would be enough to cover the cost of fixing his teeth. It seemed like dental fees had skyrocketed lately.

...

...

“Hey, Scholar Song, aren’t you worried that Lin Tao will just turn around and tell the school that you assaulted him? That they might force you to drop out?” Nan Haomeng mused aloud.

“Not at all,” Scholar Song replied, surprisingly calm.

For some reason, that calmness sent a shiver down Nan Haomeng's spine.

“Why? Because I’ll never admit to hitting him. And…” Scholar Song turned to glance at Nan Haomeng. “Do you know why I brought you along?”

“What do you mean? Wasn’t it my idea to come here?” Nan Haomeng felt that something was off.

“Tell me, who stands out more, you or me?” Scholar Song asked, locking eyes with him.

Nan Haomeng shouted, “You set me up!”

“Yup, I totally did,” Scholar Song nodded. “Feeling angry? Go ahead, hit me.”

Sure, like that would happen! When the time came, it would be him getting his butt kicked. There was no way he would hit Scholar Song!

Grinding his teeth, Nan Haomeng turned back toward the rooftop. He felt it was necessary to give Lin Tao a thorough warning, just in case the guy did something rash.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In the sky, the sun climbed high, relentlessly pouring its light and heat upon the world. In such sweltering weather, everyone secretly wished the sun would take a day or two off.

With some free time before class, Scholar Song made his way to the Alchemical Sage’s residence.

He had too many questions to ask the wise old master.

At that moment, in the uniquely designed three-room, five-story courtyard, an old Volkswagen Santana was parked outside. It was the clunky model commonly used in driving schools over a decade ago. This type of car had long been retired from the market due to age and wear.

Who would have thought anyone still drove one of these? Scholar Song found himself questioning if it was even roadworthy anymore.

“Is there a guest?” he wondered, retrieving his keys to open the door.

Just then, the door swung open.

A woman with shoulder-length hair stepped out. She was petite, around 1.5 meters tall, but she commanded an imposing presence, striding forward like a tiger patrolling its territory.

She cast a sideways glance at Scholar Song before striding over to the old Santana, popping open the trunk, and pulling out a large alchemical furnace, roughly the size of a cubic meter.

Then, she lifted her leg and delivered a powerful kick to the furnace, which emitted a mournful hum in response.

This girl clearly wasn’t in a good mood; her temper seemed to match her size.

“Her anger levels are off the charts,” Scholar Song thought nervously. It seemed best to avoid this girl for now.

Just as he prepared to sneak inside to find the Alchemical Sage, a strange sound came from behind him.

Suddenly, the furnace that had just been kicked began to expand like it was filled with air, growing to the size of the car in an instant.

Kicking it made it grow larger?

Was that some kind of spell to compress an object’s volume?

With countless magical techniques and limitless powers, it was clear that cultivators had abilities beyond imagination!
