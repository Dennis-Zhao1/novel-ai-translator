**Unable to Refuse**

"Alright, whatever you want to call it. At least after I get it, I won't have to go out and buy a new fridge," Scholar Song muttered to himself, rubbing his face to prevent his cheerful smile from turning back into a bewildered expression.

At that moment, Venerable White shifted his attention to the air conditioner, standing beneath it with an eager look on his face.

Scholar Song quickly tried to redirect his focus. "Senior, how about you change into some new clothes? I can take you out to buy a computer and a phone, so you can communicate with the members of the Ninefold Land One group anytime you want."

"Clothes? Oh, right. This outfit is too eye-catching," Venerable White nodded, then deftly typed on the computer, searching for some men's clothing styles. In just one night, he had already made significant progress in using the computer, demonstrating a remarkable self-taught ability.

After a moment, he pointed at a casual outfit on the screen and asked, "What about this one?"

"It's nice," Scholar Song replied with a nod.

"Then this is it," Venerable White said, lightly brushing his hand over his white robe, causing a ripple of magical energy to shimmer in the air.

In an instant, the casual outfit from the web page had materialized on Venerable White's body.

Scholar Song's eyes widened—this spell was exactly the legendary transformation spell, and it didn't even have those awkward moments that often accompany transformation magic! This was definitely the kind of spell every woman in the world would dream of possessing!

Are you still troubled by how to organize that overflowing wardrobe?

Are you hesitating over which stylish piece to buy next?

Are you stressed about which outfit to take every time you go out?

With the transformation spell, one outfit can solve all your problems. You deserve to have it!

"Where should we go first?" Venerable White asked, gathering his long hair and putting on a casual hat to cover it.

Scholar Song snapped back to reality and answered, "We can take a bus for three stops to get to an electronics mall, where we can find what we need."

At the same time, he called out to his dog, Jingba, "Doudou, do you want to come out for a stroll?"

"I'm going to play a game soon, so if you want to take me out for a walk, you'll have to wait until I'm free," Doudou replied without looking back—after all, it was only when Venerable White left that Scholar Song's computer would finally be available for it to play, and his wife was waiting for him to log on!

"I never said I wanted to walk the dog," Scholar Song sighed. "Then let's go, Senior White."

If he was the only one accompanying Venerable White outside, he had to be extra cautious and vigilant—he absolutely could not give Venerable White any chance to demonstrate a 'falling-flat-on-his-face' moment!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

The Endless Demon Sect was a notorious sect within the cultivation world.

Its disciples were known for their extreme personalities and unconventional practices.

The location of the Endless Demon Sect was shrouded in mystery; to this day, no one in the cultivation world knew its exact address, except for those within the sect itself.

At this moment, on the sixty-ninth peak of the Demon Sect, 'Mao Hou Peak.'

Young Master Hai stood quietly at the edge of a cliff, with a sea of clouds swirling below him and his cultivation cave behind him.

A scholarly figure approached Young Master Hai from the distance, casually saying, "You seem quite relaxed?"

"My innate evil sword has been perfected, and condensing the Golden Core to advance to the Spirit Emperor is no problem, which is why I have this brief moment of leisure," Young Master Hai turned to smile at Zheng Neng. "Aren't you the same? We both have exceptional talents; our goals aren't as simple as just 'condensing the innate Golden Core.'"

The Golden Core had dragon patterns and was categorized into nine levels.

With the eyes of Young Master Hai and Zheng Neng, their sights were firmly set above the ordinary first and second patterns. A seven-pattern Golden Core was their true pursuit. At the very least, they needed to achieve a five-pattern Golden Core!

Thus, Young Master Hai had laid out plans to eliminate the Blood Blade Sect's 'Blood God Evil Blade Formation' to acquire the Blood God Diamond.

Zheng Neng sought the 'Seven Brilliant Fruits' from the Immortal Farmer Sect and aimed to obtain the method to utilize them.

And thus, the Demon Lord was scheming to drive the disciples of the Moon Blade Sect into madness, extracting the 'Three Evil Demonic Qi' from them.

Whether it was the Blood God Diamond, the Seven Brilliant Fruits, or the Three Evil Demonic Qi, all were methods for Young Master Hai and his companions to enhance their Golden Core dragon patterns!

"In the past few days, I've thoroughly contemplated the method of refining the 'Seven Brilliant Fruits.' In about a month, I will be able to produce them," Zheng Neng stood beside Young Master Hai, gazing out over the sea of clouds.

"I've also handled the Blood God Diamond, and in another month, I can deliver it for your use," Young Master Hai smiled.

As they spoke, a thick fog rose, and the Demon Lord's figure appeared mysteriously: "I have also preliminarily purified the Three Evil Demonic Qi, and in a month and a half, it can be shared for your use."

"Then let's work together. Enhancing our strength is key; with strength comes the right to speak," Young Master Hai's eyes gleamed with a frenzied light. "Having a voice means we can gain sufficient benefits from the upcoming grand plan of the Demon Sect!"

Mentioning the Demon Sect's grand plan, both Zheng Neng and the Demon Lord fell silent.

After a while, Zheng Neng softly responded, closing his eyes slightly as if lost in thought.

The Demon Lord wore a grave expression as well.

…

…

Suddenly, Zheng Neng whispered, "That guy is coming again."

"Is it the leader of the Jing Mo Sect? He shows up every few days; doesn't he get tired?" The Demon Lord chuckled. "I don't have time to deal with him; I'm leaving."

With that, he transformed into black mist and swiftly departed.

Zheng Neng remained silent, stepping forward as his wooden sword flew from his sleeve, transforming into a streak of light that supported him as he descended into the sea of clouds, disappearing from sight.

Young Master Hai opened his mouth—are these two just going to leave him here alone?

The leader of the Jing Mo Sect was a branch leader of the Endless Demon Sect, scattered around the world, and was also a disciple of the sixty-ninth peak, Mao Hou Peak.

This guy not only held himself in high regard but also had a volatile temper, making him a bomb that could explode at any moment.

In one moment, he could be laughing and drinking with you, and in the next, he might throw a punch over an offhand comment!

If your strength was on par with his, you might be able to fight him for three hundred rounds; otherwise, you'd get beaten up.

Almost everyone on Mao Hou Peak had clashed with him at least once. Eventually, even the peak master couldn't tolerate his temper anymore and sent him off to be a branch leader.

Because of that, Young Master Hai, who was now favored by the peak master, became the target of the leader of the Jing Mo Sect's harassment.

"Dealing with a guy who can't be reasoned with is such a hassle," Young Master Hai's face twitched as he sighed, trying to maintain a calm expression.

When facing someone like Jing Mo, the more you got angry, the happier he became.

"Haha, Young Master Hai, you really seem to have leisure time, standing here looking at the clouds? By the way, I heard some news today. I heard you caused a ruckus at the Moon Blade Sect, blood sacrificing the entire sect and obtaining four Blood God Diamonds. But in the end, it was snatched away by some nameless rookie? What an interesting piece of news! Hahaha!" The leader of the Jing Mo Sect's voice preceded his arrival.

Then, a tall figure appeared before Young Master Hai.

His silver hair stood on end like a hedgehog, and his golden eyes flickered with golden lightning due to his cultivation method.

Young Master Hai turned and slightly nodded. "That news has been known by everyone on Mao Hou Peak for quite some time. Brother Jing Mo, you only just found out?"

This was a jab at the other man's popularity; because of his explosive temper, no one on Mao Hou Peak wanted to associate with him.

Who would enjoy getting beaten up for no reason?

The leader of the Jing Mo Sect stiffened for a moment, then huffed, "I heard that the one who took your Blood God Diamond was just a rookie who recently started cultivating? He hasn't even completed the foundation yet?"

"Yes, an ordinary young cultivator, seemingly acquainted with Sable Seven. If I calculate it right, he should have opened his heart now and completed his foundation," Young Master Hai replied with a smile, revealing some intel regarding 'Shu Shan's Great Pressure.'

"Tsk tsk, so because you know Sable Seven, you got scared and didn't even go back for that Blood God Diamond?" The leader of the Jing Mo Sect cackled.

"Brother, you're joking; I just prefer to act with certainty. I'm simply not one to engage in a reckless endeavor," Young Master Hai maintained his gentle smile.

"I see you are just scared stiff by Sable Seven!" The leader of the Jing Mo Sect laughed heartily, revealing his shark-like teeth. "Since you don’t dare to go back for that Blood God Diamond, let me go take it back for you. You won’t mind if I step in, right? Though, even if you do mind, it won’t matter."

"Hehe." Young Master Hai smiled lightly. "Of course, I don’t mind. Brother Jing Mo, feel free."

He initially wanted to counterattack, but he found himself at a loss for words.

Unable to gain the upper hand verbally, the leader of the Jing Mo Sect spat silently—then I’ll just use facts to slap you!

With that thought, he stepped hard on the ground and turned to leave.

…

…

After the leader of the Jing Mo Sect departed, the cloud of demonic smoke formed by the Demon Lord rolled back in: "Are you really going to let Jing Mo deal with that 'Shu Shan's Great Pressure'?"

Zheng Neng's figure also shot out from the sea of clouds: "What if he really manages to snatch the Blood God Diamond from 'Shu Shan's Great Pressure'?"

"Then what does it matter? It's just a Blood God Diamond," Young Master Hai gazed into the distance, gently clenching his fist. "The premise is that he has a good appetite; if he obtains the Blood God Diamond, he must be able to digest it. Otherwise, hehehe..."

"Moreover, while 'Shu Shan's Great Pressure' might be lacking in strength, anyone who could precisely identify the flaws in our modified 'Blood God Evil Blade Formation' and effortlessly snatch what was practically in our mouths cannot be an ordinary cultivator," Young Master Hai's lips curled into a smile. "His ability to pinpoint our flaws is certainly not mere coincidence. So... either 'Shu Shan's Great Pressure' is playing the fool waiting to catch a tiger, or he has a powerful figure guiding him."

"As for which possibility it is—we won't know until we give it a try. And right now, the leader of the Jing Mo Sect is offering himself to be my pawn; I really can't think of a reason to refuse such a generous offer," Young Master Hai asked with a smile.

"I can't refuse," Zheng Neng replied flatly.

"I'll keep an eye on Jing Mo's movements," the Demon Lord added...
