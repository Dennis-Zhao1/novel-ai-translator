**Venerable White**: I’m going to find Dou Dou!

**Scholar Song**: “Hahaha, yes, Mom. Venerable White is quite the character! He was just too tired yesterday to show off his sense of humor!”

Indeed, **Venerable White** is quite amusing… He can dismantle electronics, perform a perfect fall, and even fly in space! It’s both entertaining and thrilling, bringing tears of laughter to one’s eyes.

“You two go sit in the dining room; I’ll make you dumplings,” **Mother Song** said with a smile.

“Okay!” **Scholar Song** eagerly pulled the slightly bewildered **Venerable White** toward the dining room.

…

After breakfast, **Scholar Song** told **Mother Song** that he wanted to go have some fun at **Jade Fish Mountain**.

With that, he and **Venerable White** made their way downstairs.

**Scholar Song’s** house wasn’t too far from **Jade Fish Mountain**—just six bus stops away.

However, after the last time he took **Venerable White** on the bus, he decided he would never do that again.

He was also hesitant to take **Venerable White** on his little electric scooter. He feared that **Venerable White** would pull out an A4 sheet of paper and stick it on the scooter, causing it to zoom off at a despairing speed that even a police car couldn’t catch up with… Imagine the police officer crying over that!

“So, absolutely no letting **Venerable White** near the scooter; let’s just take a taxi!” **Scholar Song** thought to himself.

And so, they arrived downstairs.

…

The definition of super bad luck is encountering the wrong person at the wrong place at the wrong time, who then does the wrong thing to you!

Time, place, character, and event—all four key elements happening in the worst possible way is what you call super bad luck.

As **Scholar Song** and **Venerable White** descended the stairs, they ran into Aunt Li from next door, who was wheeling **Mother Song’s** little scooter.

“Oh, **Scholar Song**, you’re just in time! This is your mom’s electric scooter. I borrowed it to run some errands at the market, and now that I’m done, I’m returning it to her. I saw you and thought I’d hand it over,” Aunt Li said cheerfully.

**Scholar Song** was momentarily dumbfounded—Aunt Li, couldn’t you have been a little less coincidental?

What he feared most had just happened.

He forced a laugh: “Hahaha, alright, Aunt Li, I’ll take the scooter!”

As he spoke, he cautiously turned to glance at **Venerable White**.

Sure enough, **Venerable White’s** eyes sparkled with excitement, revealing a clear message: “I want to drive!”

He had seen plenty of electric scooters when they were in the **Jiangnan District**. Given his adventurous spirit, he had long wanted to give one a try.

But he had never had the chance to ride one, especially after his attention had shifted to cars.

Now that the opportunity had presented itself, there was no way he could resist.

“Then it’s all yours!” Aunt Li said as she took her groceries off the scooter and waved goodbye before heading off.

Once Aunt Li was gone, **Scholar Song** turned to **Venerable White** and tentatively asked, “Do you want to give it a try?”

“Sure, sure!” **Venerable White** eagerly nodded—he had been waiting for **Scholar Song** to say those words.

With a flourish, **Venerable White** hopped onto the scooter, his long hair swaying dramatically behind him!

**Scholar Song** couldn’t help but chuckle as he handed over a safety helmet before taking a seat on the back.

“Which way should we go?” **Venerable White** asked.

“Just head straight along the main road. I’ll let you know when we need to turn,” **Scholar Song** replied, a bit worried. “But, **Venerable White**, do you know how to drive?”

“Of course! Don’t worry! I studied the theory of electric scooters while learning about cars,” **Venerable White** said confidently, twisting the key and revving the throttle.

Zing! The scooter shot forward like a bullet!

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

What was astonishing was that throughout the entire ride, **Venerable White** never once pulled out an A4 paper to stick on the scooter.

Even though the scooter was quite slow… Could it be that **Venerable White** was in a good mood today and decided not to speed?

**Scholar Song** pondered, but remained vigilant, directing **Venerable White** with commands like “left turn,” “right turn,” and “go straight.”

Before long, the electric scooter carrying **Scholar Song** and **Venerable White** arrived near the **Jade Fish Mountain** mulberry field.

“Venerable, we’ve arrived; you can park now,” **Scholar Song** said.

No sooner had he finished speaking than the scooter screeched to an abrupt halt.

Then **Venerable White** put his foot down, coming to a complete stop.

Was that a bit too sudden? **Scholar Song** thought, gazing curiously at **Venerable White**.

After stopping, **Venerable White** remained completely still, holding a pose like a robot.

“**Venerable White**?” **Scholar Song** called out.

But **Venerable White** remained frozen…

“I can’t shake this feeling that something's off,” **Scholar Song** thought as he cautiously climbed off the scooter and walked to the front. What he saw made him jump in shock.

**Venerable White** had a blank expression on his face, his eyes glazed over—he had spaced out.

Venerable White’s zoning-out skills had leveled up! He managed to tune out everything while still following **Scholar Song’s** directions of “left turn,” “right turn,” and “stop.”

At that moment, **Scholar Song** felt incredibly grateful that he had survived the ride to their destination. What a stroke of luck!

…

“**Venerable White**, **Venerable White**, we’re here; wake up,” **Scholar Song** called out again.

After a moment, **Venerable White** snapped back to reality.

“Oh? Have we arrived?” he asked.

**Scholar Song** couldn’t help but feel a rush of emotions: “Yes, **Venerable White**, we’re already at **Jade Fish Mountain**.”

And, it was you who was driving, **Venerable White**.

“Hahaha, while driving just now, I suddenly had a great idea for modifying a tractor—I want to add a ‘water treading’ device to it! Imagine during a tractor modification competition, one of the segments would be on water, and the tractor would glide over the surface of the sea! What do you think?” **Venerable White** exclaimed, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

“What?” **Scholar Song** was left utterly bewildered for a moment.

He realized that even with his wild imagination, he could never predict the antics of the elders in the **Ninefold Land** group—he had thought that the modified ‘hand-pulled tractor army’ led by fairies, Daoists, and masters would simply race a few laps on the main road and maybe tackle some challenging mountain paths.

But he never imagined that **Venerable White** was actually considering taking the tractor army for a spin on the ocean!

Just picture it: twenty or thirty hand-pulled tractors racing across the sea like it was dry land… And when a tsunami rolls in, the fairies, Daoists, and masters cheer with excitement, riding the waves on their tractors.

It almost sounded exhilarating, didn’t it?

Oh man, why do I feel like this image is thrilling?

“What do you think? Isn’t it an amazing idea?” **Venerable White** laughed heartily.

“Very amazing,” **Scholar Song** admitted honestly—there was a moment when he even imagined charging into the waves on a hand-pulled tractor, cutting through the tsunami as if he were storming through a tempest!

“Right? Racing on the ocean definitely feels more exhilarating than just on land. Let’s go with that plan!” **Venerable White** decided enthusiastically.

“Alright, enough daydreaming. Let’s go pick some mulberries,” the mere thought of mulberries made **Venerable White’s** eyes squint with joy.

Overall, their trip to **Jade Fish Mountain** was characterized by **Venerable White** going full throttle with excitement…

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

After spending the entire afternoon at **Jade Fish Mountain**, **Venerable White** left with a satisfied grin.

Before leaving, **Scholar Song** forced the manager to accept eight hundred coins—originally, the activity was priced per person, about forty to fifty yuan each, with as much food as one could eat.

If it had been an ordinary person, they might have eaten until their teeth hurt. But **Venerable White** was a living, breathing **B.U.G.**, and he didn’t even know how much he had eaten that afternoon.

Had **Scholar Song** not only brought eight hundred cash with him, he would have definitely given the manager even more.

After leaving **Jade Fish Mountain**, **Venerable White** happily hopped back onto the little scooter.

On the way back, he had been lost in thought, still relishing the experience of riding an electric scooter, which he would surely appreciate even more when they returned.

Just then, **Scholar Song’s** phone buzzed.

He checked to see it was the unfortunate **Brother Zhou Li** calling.

“**Scholar Song**, is that you? I’ve already sent someone to handle the accident site. The wrecked tractor has been taken care of, and the road has been repaired without leaving a trace. So don’t worry,” **Brother Zhou Li** said over the phone.

“Thanks, **Brother Zhou Li**… By the way, do you have any news about Dou Dou and the little monk, Guoguo?” **Scholar Song** inquired.

“Hahaha… Not a single clue. Dou Dou knows me too well; it’s figured out all my tricks and methods for searching. Over the years, it’s become an expert in counter-surveillance. From now on, I can only rely on luck,” **Brother Zhou Li** sighed heavily.

Hearing this, **Scholar Song** felt a wave of sadness wash over him.

“By the way, **Brother Zhou Li**, Dou Dou and the little monk, Guoguo, logged into the **Ninefold Land** group this morning. They might have bought new phones or mobile devices. I don’t know if this clue is useful to you?” **Scholar Song** said.

“Thanks, that should be somewhat useful,” **Brother Zhou Li** acknowledged with a sigh.

“Hang in there, **Brother Zhou Li**. Once I get Dou Dou back, I’ll take him to the East Sea for a week or two. You should take the opportunity to rest well, and maybe ask a fairy out for a date or something?” **Scholar Song** suggested.

“Thank you, thank you,” **Brother Zhou Li** said, his voice choked with emotion.

**Scholar Song** quietly hung up the phone—**Brother Zhou Li** really was easily satisfied.

…

After hanging up, **Venerable White** suddenly looked worried and asked, “**Scholar Song**, can I ask you something? If Dou Dou and the little monk, Guoguo, aren’t found… does that mean our plan to go to the East Sea has to be postponed or canceled?”

“**Brother Zhou Li** should be able to find Dou Dou by tomorrow, right?” **Scholar Song** chuckled nervously—he originally had faith in **Brother Zhou Li**, but now he felt like catching Dou Dou and the little monk before tomorrow was nothing but a dream.

**Venerable White** fell silent.

“Let’s go home first,” **Venerable White** said seriously. “Then… I’ll go find Dou Dou and the little monk!”
