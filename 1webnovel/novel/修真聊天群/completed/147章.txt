**Immortal Sage, What Does ‘All Have’ Mean?**

Fay Yu was having a blast, enjoying everything she could think of, trying out all the fun things until she finally wore a satisfied expression on her face.

As night fell, Scholar Song accompanied her to the rooftop of Guoxin Building.

Leaning against the railing, Fay Yu looked down at the nightscape surrounding Jiangnan University Town. Beside her was a large package, a trophy from their day of wandering the streets.

“Are you tired?” Fay Yu turned her head to ask.

“Not really,” Scholar Song replied.

After all, he was a cultivator with a cheerful temperament, full of energy, unlike those frail male leads in movies who would be utterly exhausted after a day of shopping with a girl.

“Haha, what a pity,” Fay Yu yawned lazily. “Let’s call it a day! Aqi should be here to pick me up soon!”

Scholar Song asked, “Is he coming to get you right here?”

“Of course, he’ll be flying on his sword; no one else can see him,” Fay Yu looked up and laughed. “I’ll pay you back the money I owe you next time we meet.”

“Okay,” Scholar Song nodded.

“Deal, I’ll pay you back when we see each other next!” Fay Yu stretched her body. “I’ve got to go now; Aqi’s here.”

As she spoke, a streak of light flashed past.

Aqi appeared in front of Scholar Song as if he had teleported.

Fay Yu giggled and waved, “Hey, Aqi! You’re late!”

Without hesitation, Aqi flicked her forehead, causing Fay Yu to crouch down, cradling her head in pain.

Feeling a bit embarrassed, Aqi turned to Scholar Song, “Sorry for bothering you again, little friend Shuhang.”

“It’s no problem; I was just idle this afternoon,” Scholar Song replied.

Aqi burst into laughter, then scooped up Fay Yu. With a wave of his sword, they transformed into a beam of light, “I’ll take her back now. See you next time!”

Scholar Song waved, “Goodbye, Senior!”

“Wait, my stuff!” Fay Yu exclaimed, flailing her arms.

Sable Sixteen of the Su Clan reached out and grabbed the large package from mid-air, placing it on the beam of light.

“Shuhang, see you!” Fay Yu beamed.

“Yeah, bye,” Scholar Song waved back.

Aqi leaped lightly onto the beam of light, which soared higher and higher into the night sky.

“Goodbye,” Fay Yu whispered.

In the next moment, it felt as if all her strength was suddenly drained away, and she went limp in Aqi’s grip.

Aqi whispered, “Sixteen… there’s still hope.”

“Mm-hmm, I know,” Fay Yu replied softly. “I’ll give it my all! Even if the chances are slim, there’s still a chance to survive!”

Aqi gritted his teeth, and the beam of light sped up even more.

…

…

Scholar Song’s smile faded as he watched the retreating light with unease. He couldn’t shake the feeling that Fay Yu’s visit felt like she was fulfilling a last wish.

Could it be that her injury couldn’t be healed?

Just the thought of that possibility made his heart feel heavy.

Who determines life and death?

“Peh, peh, peh, good luck and fortune. We should be able to meet again; she still owes me money,” Scholar Song muttered to himself.

After a long while, he picked up a bag of beef-flavored dog food and headed toward the boys’ dorm.

＊＊＊＊＊＊

Upon returning to his dorm, Scholar Song noticed the box that Fay Yu had sent over was shoved into a corner of the room. This large wooden box, he wondered how he should deal with it.

If it were an ordinary wooden box, he could just toss it, but since it came from Fay Yu, it might have been crafted from some precious wood. Maybe he should take it to the Alchemical Sage’s building when he has the chance.

All three of his roommates were present, including Zhuge Zhongyang.

When Tu Bo saw Scholar Song holding a bag of dog food, he curiously asked, “Shuhang, did you get a dog?”

“Nope, this is for a friend’s pet dog,” Scholar Song smiled, glancing around the dorm.

The mischievous dog, Doudou, was rolling around on the bed, bored. Since his roommates were back, it couldn’t play games openly. Otherwise, if they saw the computer playing itself, they would be scared out of their wits.

Seeing Scholar Song return, Doudou rolled over, focusing on the dog food in his hands.

Scholar Song casually tossed the dog food onto the bed and discreetly cut open the bag with his finger. As long as Doudou was careful while munching, his roommates wouldn’t notice anything odd.

At the same time, Scholar Song handed a big bag of snacks to his roommates. After spending the day with Fay Yu wandering the streets, he naturally wouldn’t forget to bring back some treats for them.

“Shuhang, you’re the best,” Gao Moumou said, grinning as he approached the bag of snacks.

“What are you guys talking about?” Scholar Song asked.

“We’re discussing how to help Zhuge Zhongyang continue dating girls. Today, he met his number one candidate for a fiancée, but they fell apart in less than ten minutes. They just didn’t see eye to eye,” Gao Moumou snickered. “Honestly, I feel sorry for that girl. Putting up with Zhuge Zhongyang’s annoying personality and still managing to last ten minutes before things fell apart? That girl really has it tough!”

Zhuge Zhongyang shook his head, “You’re just jealous of me.”

“Jealous of you? Yeah, right!” Gao Moumou shot back.

Scholar Song smiled and shook his head while putting away the bottled pills and the Lingmai Bichai tea that Fay Yu had given him.

He could let his roommates drink the Lingmai Bichai tea, but he needed to ask the seniors how much tea leaves to use for ordinary people to avoid overdosing.

Suddenly, Gao Moumou said, “By the way, Shuhang, did you know Lu Fei has a sister?”

“I never asked her,” Scholar Song shook his head. They barely knew each other; they only sat together in class and walked back to the dorm together after school. They hadn’t really interacted much, and he hadn’t even held her hand a few times.

Deep down, Scholar Song had a nagging feeling—was this girl trying to ride his coattails?

“Hehe, one of the candidates for Zhuge Zhongyang’s fiancée is Lu Fei’s sister, her biological sister! We’re thinking of arranging a meeting for them after summer break, preferably in a scenic spot overseas for a date. That way, even if Zhuge Zhongyang and Lu’s sister don’t hit it off, she can at least enjoy a trip and not waste her youth,” Gao Moumou said with a grin.

“Sounds like a good idea. Do you want me to pass the message to Lu Fei?” Scholar Song inquired.

“No rush, no rush. We’re still picking a location. Right now, we’re thinking about the East China Sea, somewhere far away would be best. A trip abroad would be nice too. We’ll decide after we pick a place,” Gao Moumou chuckled.

“Good luck. Let me know if you need any help,” Scholar Song smiled.

The roommates continued to browse maps, discussing dating scenarios.

Scholar Song leaned back on his bed, while Doudou nestled against him, chewing on the dog food.

He pulled out his phone and scrolled through the messages in the Jiuzhou No. 1 group.

Earlier in the afternoon, Fay Yu had been online.

After half a month of turmoil, she had successfully completed the ‘Five Elements Spiritual Contract Altar’ and signed a contract with the Phantom Spirit. She was in tears, immediately sharing her struggles in the Jiuzhou No. 1 group.

The seniors in the group showered her with compliments—consolation prizes.

Fay Yu had even tagged Scholar Song, but he couldn’t respond in time since he was out with Fay Yu.

So, Scholar Song replied in the group, “@Lingdie Island Fay Yu, [thumbs up emoji], congratulations, well done, Fay Yu.”

Fay Yu was still online and quickly replied, “Hehehe, thank you, Senior Song. Why did you just come online now?”

“I was out with a friend for some fresh air, just got back,” Scholar Song replied.

Lingdie Island Fay Yu: “Ahhh, I want to go out and have some fun too!”

“Wait, didn’t you just contract with a Phantom Spirit?” Scholar Song asked.

He remembered that Fay Yu had mentioned an agreement with the Lingdie Patriarch that she could go out and have fun once she completed the contract.

Fay Yu sent a crying face emoji: “Old ginger is more pungent than young ginger!”

“What?” Scholar Song asked.

“Senior Song, let me tell you, I thought that as soon as I completed the contract with the Phantom Spirit, I would be able to ‘connect with its mind’ instantly and share energy. Then, I could let the Phantom Spirit help me refine energy. But unexpectedly, after finishing the contract, I need another half month to synchronize with it! My dad never told me this—so I’ll need to stay in seclusion for at least another half month,” Fay Yu complained.

So now, Fay Yu had to hold back her tears and work hard, trying to synchronize with the Phantom Spirit as soon as possible—she was quite determined to get out and have some fun.

“Haha, good luck,” Scholar Song nodded silently, gaining some knowledge.

High-grade Phantom Spirits could help their masters refine energy, whether it was ‘vitality’, ‘true qi’, or ‘spiritual power’. They made their master’s energy purer and more valuable.

Plus, with the energy-sharing attribute, having a Phantom Spirit was like having an indefatigable, loyal clone helping you train at all times.

Phantom Spirit power-ups—every cultivator below the fifth rank’s dream!

“I’ll definitely work hard! I heard that mysterious island is still drifting in the East China Sea. Senior Song, once I synchronize with the Phantom Spirit, let’s go find that mysterious island and have some fun!” Fay Yu said excitedly.

“Alright, if there’s a chance then,” Scholar Song smiled, feeling his previously heavy heart lighten a bit.

“Then it’s settled! I’m off to synchronize with the Phantom Spirit!” Fay Yu said and hurriedly logged off.

The group fell silent for a while.

About ten minutes later, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain appeared: “@Scholar Song, Shuhang my friend, have you gotten your driver’s license yet?”

Scholar Song replied, “Not yet. I just passed the second test; I still need the road test. I can get my license within ten days at the earliest.”

“Good luck! The time for Venerable White to emerge is drawing near. Have you thought about what car you want once you get your license?” Immortal Sage asked with great enthusiasm, which made Scholar Song think of the million-dollar phone bills.

“I haven’t thought about it; I’m still a student and living on campus, so I don’t need a car,” Scholar Song quickly replied.

“You’ll need one!” Immortal Sage insisted. “And you should prepare several cars for yourself. Get different styles—at least twenty cars, that should be enough for Venerable White to tinker around with.”

“Tinker? Is Venerable White going to take them apart for research?” Scholar Song recalled hearing that Venerable White liked to study ‘mechanical devices,’ so different styles of cars must be for research purposes.

“Yeah,” Immortal Sage replied. After a pause, he added two words, “All have!”

What does “all have” mean?

Can you be more specific, Immortal Sage? What does “all” refer to?

Scholar Song felt a slight discomfort rising…
