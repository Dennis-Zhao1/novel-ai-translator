### The Dashing Hero Must Sink to the Depths

It seemed that the time had come to explore other options for forcibly entering the mysterious island, Venerable White thought to himself.

As he pondered this, he suddenly called out softly, “Huh?”

The coordinates of Scholar Song, which he had locked onto with precision, had vanished!

About three seconds later, Scholar Song’s presence re-emerged, this time, his aura was coming from a location somewhere in the East Sea.

“Has Scholar Song exited the mysterious island?” Venerable White immediately realized.

In the next instant, the Meteor Sword was drawn.

Venerable White, accompanied by Doudou and the little monk, stepped onto the flying sword and headed toward Scholar Song’s coordinates.

In the vast expanse of the East Sea.

The woman in the black dress named Chuchu was swimming with all her might, desperately trying to evade capture. Behind her, two figures were hot on her tail, intentionally driving her toward a specific direction.

“This must be the agreed-upon location, but where is Fox Ten?” one of the pursuers, a man with sharp teeth, said in a low voice.

“It’s strange; I haven’t seen any sign of Fox Ten. Let me ask Wolf One,” replied another man, whose massive frame belied an astonishing speed.

He then activated his communicator to connect with Wolf One.

Fox Ten was a unique presence in their organization; aside from Wolf One, no other members could contact him directly, so they had to relay messages through Wolf One.

Once Whale Eight reached Wolf One, he cut to the chase, “Wolf One, has Fox Ten arrived yet?”

“What? Fox Ten hasn’t shown up? Damn it, I told him to wait here early on! Just a moment; I’ll get in touch with him.” With that, Wolf One ended the call and turned his attention to contacting Fox Ten.

Before long, Fox Ten’s communicator was answered.

However, a strange sound emerged from the connection: “Doro Doro, Doro Doro~~”

Wolf One frowned, “Fox Ten, where are you right now?”

“Doro Doro~~ Doro Doro~~ I… I don’t know. I’m moving too fast to see anything around me… but I feel so cold,” Fox Ten’s voice trembled.

“Cold? You idiot, where did you run off to? Get back here! Whale Eight and Shark Nine have worked hard to corner the girl from the Chuchu family; it’s your time to shine!” Wolf One said sternly.

“Doro Doro, Doro Doro… Wolf One, I might not be able to return in the short term!” Fox Ten’s voice was tinged with panic.

At that moment, Fox Ten was riding on a swordfish, accelerating uncontrollably, unable to stop.

The swordfish’s initial speed, combined with its incredible inertia, had already exceeded a hundred yards. With the added effects of a tenfold acceleration formation, the speed soared past a thousand yards, an exhilarating experience.

The terrifying part was that with such speed, there was no way to slow down or stop.

But that wasn’t the most frightening aspect—despite Fox Ten being a Second-Rank True Master, even if he couldn’t stop, jumping off the swordfish into the sea shouldn't pose a problem.

However, the real problem lay with the so-called “Turbulent Water Formation.” This array allowed Fox Ten to ride the swordfish without getting wet, ensuring the fish wouldn’t die from dehydration. Yet, perhaps due to the swordfish’s incredible speed, after a period of operation, this formation generated an overwhelming attraction, pinning Fox Ten firmly to the swordfish and rendering him immobile.

Now, Fox Ten was stuck on the swordfish, unable to jump off.

The mental control array could only dictate the direction of the swordfish's movement; it had no options to make the swordfish stop. Under the influence of the “Gathering Spirit Array,” the swordfish exhibited limitless stamina and tirelessness.

Finally, there was a major issue—Fox Ten was completely lost.

He could only turn the swordfish left and right. But due to the swordfish's excessive speed, he had no idea where he was being whisked away in the East Sea.

All he knew was that this damned place was freezing; even he, a Second-Rank True Master, was shivering. He had only ever felt such cold in places like the Antarctic or Arctic!

Now, he had two options: 1) wait for the array on the swordfish to dissipate, which would take a month, or 2) if luck was on his side, someone could help him by taking out the swordfish... wait a minute?

“Holy crap, I can just kill the swordfish!” Fox Ten exclaimed in frustration.

Since he couldn’t get off the swordfish, why not just kill it outright?

“Wolf One, I can’t return right now; I’ve run into an accident. I’ll report back shortly!” With that, Fox Ten hung up the communicator.

Without hesitation, he drew the soft sword at his waist and infused it with true energy.

The soft sword instantly straightened, transforming into a blade capable of slicing through iron with ease.

Fox Ten gripped the sword and struck fiercely at the swordfish’s head.

Even with the four formations boosting its abilities, it was still an ordinary swordfish at its core, with no enhancements to its physical strength. Fox Ten’s strike pierced through its head, blood gushing forth.

Thus fell the first-ever ordinary swordfish steed that could swim at a thousand yards—dead.

Once the swordfish was dispatched, it lost its original speed; no matter how powerful the tenfold acceleration formation was, it couldn’t turn a speed of zero into a hundred yards.

Fox Ten let out a sigh of relief and reconnected with Wolf One to send a message.

But just then, the massive corpse of the swordfish beneath him began to sink to the ocean floor… and the attraction of the “Turbulent Water Formation” still held strong.

So, just as Fox Ten had relaxed, he was dragged down to the depths of the sea.

On the other side, Wolf One gripped his communicator tightly: “…”

Damn that Fox Ten, falling apart at the critical moment?

Once this mission ended, I’m definitely going to find a chance to tie him to a big rock and sink him to the depths!

After being in the organization for so long, he had long been displeased with that pretty boy—what was it with being handsome? Why should he and the other powerful seniors have to do the dirty work while this pretty boy gets to engage in tasks that involved beautiful women and charming young ladies?

This world, where looks mattered so much, was utterly despairing.

As Wolf One stewed in his grievances, Fox Ten’s communicator buzzed again.

Wolf One frowned slightly but still answered the call.

“Not good, Wolf One. Glub~ glub~” Fox Ten’s panicked voice came through, “I’m sinking to the bottom of the sea. Glub~ glub~ I’ll contact you later, glub~”

Wolf One: “…”

Damn it, sinking is just great!

After hanging up, Wolf One reconnected with Whale Eight and said in a serious tone, “Old Eight, Fox Ten has encountered an accident. The mission has changed; you and Shark Nine need to catch that girl named Chuchu. We absolutely cannot let her escape… if necessary, don’t hesitate to use lethal force!”
