Haha, I finally broke free from the seal!

Scholar Song silently watched as the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain suddenly moved to a position three meters away from him, feeling a stampede of thoughts racing through his mind. "Immortal Sage, why the sudden distance?"

"..." Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain.

Scholar Song pressed on, "Immortal Sage, are you thinking of something inappropriate?"

The Immortal Sage chuckled awkwardly, "Not at all! I just... let out a little gas, and thought it would be better to create some space."

Seriously? You're pulling my leg, right? At your level of power, you still have gas issues?

And even though I haven't opened my nasal passages, my sense of smell is still several times better than an average person's. If you let one rip, I would have smelled it long ago.

I must correct the twisted perception you have of me! Scholar Song decided it was time for a serious chat with the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain!

Just then... Venerable White approached Liu Tianzong, the Cold Flame Sword.

Liu Tianzong was still dazed, his gaze fixed in a stupor, as if his mind had hit a dead end, causing his brain to momentarily freeze.

Suddenly, he shook his head vigorously. "No way, what I saw back then was just an illusion!"

Years ago, he stumbled upon a cultivator’s cave and thought he had found a treasure when he unearthed that statue.

But after that, the statue emanated an irresistible charm. Even when he would open and close his eyes, a handsome man’s image would appear... it terrified him.

So, he buried the statue back into the ground.

Yet, even after doing so, the image of that handsome man refused to leave his mind, haunting him for a whole year until he finally found relief—a nightmare of an experience.

He initially thought the statue was cursed, having stolen treasures from many ancient immortal caves and encountered various curses.

But what was happening now? That illusion that had tormented him for a year was standing right in front of him!

"Hello." Venerable White waved at the Cold Flame Sword.

"Hello, Senior." Liu Tianzong's mental faculties were razor-sharp, every pore on his body alert.

"Relax, I'm not here to harm you. I just want to reclaim the 'Meteor Sword' in your hand. You took it while I was in seclusion. Now that I’m finally out, it’s time to return it," Venerable White said gently.

"In seclusion?" Liu Tianzong stiffened, then realization dawned on him!

"Yes, it seems you’ve figured it out. Back then, due to a secret technique, I transformed into a statue. I remember you moving me out of the cave and then burying me,” Venerable White replied calmly.

At that moment, cold sweat poured down Liu Tianzong like a waterfall, unstoppable.

After a moment, gritting his teeth, he raised the 'Meteor Sword' in his hand and slowly extended it towards Venerable White—regardless of whether this sword truly belonged to the senior, just based on the opponent's 'Seventh-Rank Venerable' strength, Liu Tianzong knew he had to obediently hand it over.

Moreover, this Meteor Sword indeed belonged to him, right?

Before Liu Tianzong could even hand over the sword, it joyfully emitted a sound, flying back to Venerable White’s side, swirling around him like a playful fish.

This divine sword was sentient; it was clear that the Meteor Sword had already developed its own spirit.

Venerable White smiled and gently caressed the Meteor Sword, which vibrated joyfully and settled at his waist.

At this moment, Scholar Song suddenly asked, "Hey, Senior. It’s the Meteor Sword, not the 'Leave the Immortal Sword,' right?"

He had keenly noticed the inscriptions on the sword, clearly spelling out 'Meteor Sword.'

"It's always been the Meteor Sword," Venerable White chuckled back, then added, "Scholar, the sword is back. Do you have anything else? If not, we can head back!"

Scholar Song replied, "If it’s not urgent, shall we wait for Senior Su’s A-Qi to arrive?"

"Sounds good." Venerable White nodded.

Just then, the conflicted Liu Tianzong spoke up, "Senior, may I ask you a question?"

Despite his turmoil, his eyes were filled with determination.

"Ask me?" Venerable White turned, puzzled, then nodded, "Go ahead."

"Senior, you’re cross-dressing as a man, right?" Liu Tianzong's eyes sparkled with hope.

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain silently facepalmed—Liu Tianzong was not the first to ask this question, and he certainly wouldn’t be the last.

"Well, if thinking that way makes you feel better, I don’t mind saying I’m cross-dressing," Venerable White scratched his head. "But do you believe it?"

"…I’ve been rude." Liu Tianzong respectfully bowed to Venerable White, then leaped into the air, laughing wildly as he flew away.

As for the unfortunate Sugar, a disciple of the Empty Thief Sect, she was ignored and left behind.

Scholar Song blinked, feeling as though he was watching a third-rate soap opera unfold.

At this moment, the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain quietly pulled Scholar Song aside and whispered, "Did you see that? If you don’t want to end up like him, think more about Su's A-Qi or Fay Yu. It wouldn't hurt to look at more pictures of the Lychee Fairy. And stop daydreaming; Venerable White could never be cross-dressing. Give up on that idea!"

"Senior." Scholar Song chuckled bitterly, unable to communicate telepathically, so he couldn’t explain. His admiration for Venerable White was purely from an aesthetic standpoint! He never even considered whether Venerable White was cross-dressing.

"Keep trying!" The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain gave Scholar Song a thumbs-up and then turned back to observe the actions of the Cloud Mist Daoist, who was sealed by the 'Five-Finger Mountain Sealing Technique.'

To prevent the Cloud Mist Daoist from being influenced by the outside world, the Immortal Sage had strengthened the density of the fog around him, creating a soundproof, visually isolating, and sensory-blocking effect.

As a result, the Cloud Mist Daoist remained blissfully unaware of the happenings outside, diligently trying to break the Immortal Sage's seal.

Let’s see how he breaks free! The Immortal Sage had been waiting a long time for this performance.

...

...

At this moment, Venerable White waved at Scholar Song, asking, "Scholar, how did your trip to J City go? And how did you end up encountering the disciples of the Wujimagic Sect?"

"If I had to say it went smoothly, then it was indeed quite smooth," Scholar Song smiled gently, beginning to recount his morning's adventures.

From meeting the vengeful ghost to accidentally killing that ghost commander, then the arrival of his senior brother from a thousand miles away to lend a helping hand... Lastly, he discovered a pile of medicinal materials for crafting 'Blood Energy Pills' among the former subordinates of the altar master. Finally, he had to deal with being chased by Jing Mo, the leader of the Jing Sect, and a half-bamboo Daoist.

As he spoke, Scholar Song couldn’t help but glance at Jing Mo—he initially thought the only regret from his trip to J City would be failing to extract information about the 'Kite Flower Cultivator' and the Wujimagic Sect's branch from the altar master's subordinates.

But now, with Jing Mo around, was he worried about not getting that branch information?

In other words, Venerable White's blessing written on his materials list had been perfectly fulfilled!

Just thinking about it felt incredible.

"Haha, looks like you had good luck, even managing to get the materials for Blood Energy Pills!" Venerable White laughed.

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain glanced at Scholar Song—could it be that Scholar Song had truly gained some fortune by being around Venerable White? His trip to J City had been unexplainably lucky, almost as if he had inherited Venerable White's aura!

"Scholar, now that you've opened your nasal passages, though having Blood Energy Pills can significantly speed up your cultivation, it still takes about a year or so," Venerable White stroked his chin. "Actually, if you were a bit luckier..."

Upon hearing this, Scholar Song leaped up, wanting to stop Venerable White from finishing that sentence.

He had already deeply understood how formidable Venerable White's 'blessings' could be. Even a written blessing could lead him into dangerous encounters with two Fourth-Rank cultivators, nearly costing him his life.

What would happen if Venerable White directly blessed him face-to-face?

Unfortunately, he barely jumped when Venerable White's next words slipped out: "Hmm, I remember a few hundred years ago, a cultivator found a mysterious stone, I think it was from the universe, quite extraordinary. It contained a special power—not spiritual energy, not something cultivators could wield. But the energy from that stone could greatly accelerate a First-Rank cultivator's 'opening of the orifices.' I recall that stone caused quite a stir in the cultivator world back then?"

"Yes, I remember," the Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain chimed in. "That stone was referred to as the 'Enlightenment Stone.' Just sitting near it would allow one to grasp the profound mysteries of the Dao. A First-Rank cultivator near the stone would find breaking through bottlenecks to be much smoother, almost guaranteed success. Unfortunately, I don’t know who ended up with it."

"If you could get your hands on that stone, Scholar, you might break through your 'Nose, Ear, Mouth' orifices in four years and leap through the dragon gate, advancing to the Second Rank!" Venerable White exclaimed.

"That's impossible; I'm not that lucky," Scholar Song waved his hands vigorously—Venerable White had just mentioned that the stone seemed to be a treasure not produced by Earth but rather from the mysterious universe.

In other words, it could very well come crashing down like a meteor!

Let’s hope Venerable White's blessing doesn’t come into effect.

Otherwise, for a while to come, he would have to worry about meteorites crashing down on him, and if he wasn't careful, he could end up flattened!

While the three were conversing, the seal around the Cloud Mist Daoist finally showed signs of change.

The 'Five-Finger Mountain Sealing Technique' began to tremble.

Then, a figure burst forth from the seal.

"Haha, I finally broke free!" The figure raised his hands to the sky, laughing joyfully.

Then he chanted, "At last, I break the seal and gain my freedom, stealing the spotlight from the foolish Yellow Mountain. Aiya, no, that doesn’t rhyme."

The Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain's face darkened, and he chuckled awkwardly.
