**City Play, Just for Myself**

Scholar Song felt the piercing gazes of people all around him—it was inevitable!

No matter who it was, upon seeing the tractor and its driver, they couldn't help but stop and stare.

First, there was the white-clad elder driving the tractor—he looked like a celestial being stepping out of a painting, strikingly handsome. When people laid eyes on this elder, they wished they could throw every word in their minds that meant "beautiful" or "handsome" at him! Anything less simply couldn't describe his looks.

Yet, this extraordinarily good-looking man wore a face full of excitement, gripping the tractor's handlebars with both hands, his body swaying rhythmically with the tractor as he embraced the thrill of the ride.

Next to him, Scholar Song, who was by no means unattractive, looked like a fresh-faced college student, youthful and innocent. He had to shrink himself into a small space beside the elder since the tractor only had one driver's seat, making him appear pitifully small.

The tractor roared to life, spewing out puffs of black smoke.

This scene was completely out of a fantasy!

"Venerable White, could you cast an invisibility spell?" Scholar Song turned his head to the elder, who was having a blast driving.

He could hardly bear the weight of the gazes on him, feeling as if they were thousands of arrows piercing through him, making him feel utterly uncomfortable.

"Huh? Oh! I forgot to use the invisibility spell!" Venerable White chuckled sheepishly. He then steered the tractor around a deserted corner.

Once certain that no one was watching, Venerable White pulled out a piece of A4 paper from his pocket and slapped it onto the tractor's seat.

By activating the array inscribed on it, the tractor could enter invisibility mode.

Scholar Song's face twitched slightly—was it possible that Venerable White had planned this all along?

Indeed, Venerable White had prepared ahead of time. He had several sheets of A4 paper with array symbols drawn on them, all disposable items—he had so many vehicles in the garage, it made sense to be well-prepared! Otherwise, it would be a hassle to draw arrays every time he wanted to go out.

"This one is for invisibility. When we get close to your house, just tear it off, and our tractor will become visible again," Venerable White explained.

[I would much rather stay invisible until I get home!] Scholar Song thought to himself.

Then, Venerable White pulled out four more A4 sheets: "This one reduces the weight of the vehicle, this one decreases air resistance, this one triples acceleration, and the last one strengthens the body of the tractor. With these four, even a tractor can go up to one hundred and fifty miles per hour without sustaining much damage."

Scholar Song silently affixed the four A4 sheets to the tractor.

With a snap of his fingers, Venerable White activated all the arrays, and they sped off towards the Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center.

Vroom, vroom… rumble, rumble…

The tractor joyfully raced down the road, quickly exceeding a hundred miles per hour.

Along the way, Venerable White showcased his exceptional driving skills, constantly overtaking other vehicles and increasing speed. Whenever they encountered a traffic jam, Venerable White would tap the vehicle and shout, "Traction Technique!"

The tractor would then leap into the air like a warhorse, soaring over the obstacles ahead, continuing its merry journey.

This was a completely off-the-wall way of speeding!

……

In a silver sedan trailing behind the tractor.

"Hey, honey, I think I just heard the sound of a tractor passing by us," the young woman driving said, puzzled.

Her husband, sitting in the passenger seat, pointed ahead, exclaiming, "Oh my gosh, what the heck is that?!"

In the distance, they saw a cloud of black smoke rising, accompanied by the unmistakable roar of a tractor's engine.

That black smoke was moving at an incredible speed, managing to reach over a hundred miles per hour even on the congested road.

"Could it be a ghost vehicle?" the young woman shivered, "Like, perhaps a tractor driver who died on this road long ago, whose restless spirit still drives his tractor here?"

Her husband sighed deeply, vowing to himself that he wouldn't let his wife watch any more strange movies for a while.

Similar scenes played out among the many vehicles on the road.

Every driver almost heard the tractor's rumbling as it sped past, and some even caught a whiff of the exhaust fumes.

—Venerable White had only remembered to make the tractor invisible, but not to mask its sound or eliminate its smell.

He felt that driving invisibly was far less fun. No matter how fast he went, it was like wearing fine clothes at night—no one would see it!

It was essential to have an audience; the astonishment of others was the driving force for a speedster.

However, Scholar Song was entirely oblivious to this.

He still thought this time would be like before, with the tractor being invisible, soundless, and undetectable.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Vroom, vroom… rumble, rumble.

The tractor soon arrived at the Jiangshui Civil Aviation Training Center.

As they approached, Scholar Song called ahead to Cassie at the aviation school, letting her know he would be bringing Instructor Li back. However, he didn’t plan to fly today; he needed to return home first and would come back to continue his flying lessons whenever he was ready.

Cassie readily agreed.

A few days prior, the incident with Instructor Li returning from space had piqued the curiosity of many flight instructors at the school. They were all eager to know what exciting things had happened after Instructor Li took two instructors for a flight.

As they neared the school, Scholar Song put away the A4 sheets inscribed with the arrays.

The tractor reverted from invisibility and drove into the school.

"Hey, is this Cassie?" Scholar Song called again.

Moments later, Cassie emerged from inside the school…

Her expression froze instantly…

She stared blankly at the tractor before her, and at Venerable White, whose face radiated joy as he drove, and at Scholar Song, who was crouched down making a call.

Cassie blinked hard and took a deep breath.

—How to put it? At that moment, she thought, wow, the world of the wealthy is truly beyond the comprehension of ordinary people. She was once again redefining the concept of "City Play."

While ordinary folks were still walking, those who played in the city were already riding bicycles; while ordinary folks were cycling, the city players were driving cars; while ordinary folks were driving cars, the city players were flying planes; and while ordinary folks were flying planes, the city players were driving tractors…

It's all about being different, not following the usual path—I'm only speaking for myself; this is what it means to play in the city.

"Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Scholar Song. Where's Instructor Li?" Cassie put on her perfect professional smile.

"He's in the back; Instructor Li fell asleep a little while ago," Scholar Song said, leaping down from the tractor and making his way to the back to carry Instructor Li down.

Two burly men rushed out from behind Cassie and took Instructor Li from Scholar Song's arms.

"Is Instructor Li alright?" Cassie asked curiously—she was particularly interested in how Instructor Li had managed to get into the American spacecraft's return module and what adventures he had been through in the last few days.

"He's fine; he's in great shape," Scholar Song replied with a smile. When Instructor Li was brought back from the States, he received treatment from Senior Brother Zhou Li, which not only healed all his injuries but also significantly strengthened his body.

Today, Venerable White had also used his spiritual energy to heal him, and it was clear that he had gained a lot from it. Scholar Song himself had experienced a boost in physical strength thanks to Venerable White’s treatment.

"We need to hurry back; if you have any other questions, you can ask Instructor Li once he wakes up. We'll be leaving now, and I’ll contact you, Cassie, once I'm back in Jiangnan to learn about other aircraft models," Scholar Song said, waving goodbye with a smile.

"Sure, no problem," Cassie replied—after all, once Instructor Li woke up, he would know everything.

Scholar Song climbed back onto the tractor.

Venerable White executed a perfect U-turn.

The tractor revved up, rumbling and roaring, then turned towards Scholar Song's hometown, Wenzhou City.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

At that moment, in Wenzhou City, on White Whale Road.

Outside Scholar Song's family home, a pristine BMW 7 Series parked smoothly.

Shortly after, a tall, bear-like man climbed out of the rear seat. He looked to be in his fifties, but due to his robust physique, he appeared much younger than he actually was.

This was Old Lu, a long-time friend of Scholar Song’s father.

"Heaven bless, bring out the gift I prepared for Old Song, hahaha!" Old Lu got out of the car, stretching his limbs and letting out a hearty laugh.

At that moment, Old Lu was practically strutting with pride, ready to show off.

From the car stepped out a similarly burly man, who looked like a younger version of Old Lu.

This was Old Lu's son, Lu Tianyou. He appeared to be in his thirties—though in reality, he was only two years older than Scholar Song.

Lu Tianyou wore an expression of reluctant amusement; he definitely did not want to accompany his father to Scholar Song's house to show off, but he couldn't resist his father’s enthusiasm.

He opened the trunk of the BMW and pulled out a small bronze statue wrapped in a red cloth, its shape hidden from view.

"Come on, come on, let's go! I can't wait to see the look on Old Song's face when he realizes he's been bested. I've been holding this back for a whole year just for this moment!" Old Lu laughed heartily, his face glowing with excitement as he charged up the steps to Scholar Song's home.

Lu Tianyou sighed deeply, wiping his face with his hand.

He felt a twinge of embarrassment over his father's antics.

After his sigh, he adjusted his smile in the car window, finally managing to put on a somewhat presentable grin before following his father up the stairs.
