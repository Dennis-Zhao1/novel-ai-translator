**Invitation from Grandpa Tu Bo**

“Is it just my imagination, or does it feel like the spiritual energy in this building has become more abundant?” Scholar Song thought to himself as he walked toward the fridge.

After grabbing some snacks and preparing to heat them up in the microwave, he noticed Dou Dou quietly squatting next to him, looking at him with a goofy expression.

Scholar Song had seen that look from Dou Dou countless times, so he was particularly sensitive to it.

Was there something wrong with what he was about to do?

He carefully examined the snacks in his hands, then glanced at his outfit—nothing seemed off.

“Dou Dou, can we just be straightforward with each other?” Scholar Song sighed, feeling a bit exasperated.

“It’s nothing. I just wanted to see how you use the ‘microwave’ to heat up food,” Dou Dou grinned, showing off a big smile that was surprisingly hard to pull off for a Pekingese.

“Is there something wrong with the microwave?” Scholar Song quickly realized. He stretched out his hand toward the microwave—only for it to feel like he was reaching through the air, as if the microwave was nothing but a ‘spirit of the microwave.’

“Hehe,” Dou Dou chuckled mischievously.

“Is that you, Venerable White?” Scholar Song forced a smile, knowing that such things could only be the doing of Venerable White; no one else in the house would pull a stunt like this.

Then it hit him: “Was the television also acting up just now?”

“Hehe, I saw you pressing the remote control against the wall, looking so satisfied. It was quite amusing,” Dou Dou replied. Its ability allowed it to see through the illusion set by Venerable White, as the illusion wasn’t particularly advanced.

“Besides the microwave, what else is malfunctioning?” Scholar Song sighed and asked.

“Other than that modified fridge… almost everything on the third floor has been switched out,” Dou Dou said with a mischievous grin. “Oh, and I took a look around; many things on the second floor have also been tampered with. But thanks to the experience from the third floor, most things have been put back together just fine,” Dou Dou continued.

“……” Scholar Song began to understand why Venerable White had decided to exchange cash. He probably wanted to buy a bunch of new things to replace everything he had inadvertently damaged.

“Never mind.” Scholar Song put the snacks back in the fridge, pretending he hadn’t seen anything to spare Venerable White from embarrassment.

Then, with a smile, he turned to Venerable White. “Venerable White, I suddenly feel like buying some fresh snacks. After we finish inspecting the car, let’s go stroll around Luo Xin District. There are so many delicious treats in this era; I think it would be worth your while to try them.”

Venerable White nodded with a smile—he had overheard the conversation between Dou Dou and Scholar Song in the kitchen.

Wow, this is super awkward.

**In Li Yangde's Rental Room**

Tu Bo was sulking while cramming for his exams.

“Damn it, why is it that when others describe college life, it’s all about chasing girls and having fun? Meanwhile, we’re still just struggling student dogs, fighting for finals every semester?” Tu Bo sighed heavily.

“That’s because you chose Jiangnan University,” Li Yangde adjusted his glasses and replied.

At Jiangnan University, if you wanted to graduate, you couldn’t fail more than three courses throughout your four years. Failing meant having to take a makeup exam, with only two chances. If you flunked again, that counted as a dead subject.

If you hit three dead subjects… sorry, but your diploma wouldn’t be waiting for you.

Jiangnan University was still somewhat lenient; the neighboring Xuan City University was utterly ruthless—there were no makeup exams. Hit three failures, and they’d hand you a free ticket home.

“If I had known, I would have never picked Jiangnan University,” Tu Bo said, looking utterly defeated. “And why does that guy Gao X something have a beautiful girlfriend helping him study, while Scholar Song probably has Lu Fei by his side, and I’m stuck here with you, a programming geek?”

Li Yangde’s forehead twitched in irritation. “I’m sorry for being a programming geek! Do you want to study or not? If not, just go back to your dorm and stop bothering me!”

“I just wanted to vent and lighten the mood a bit. Can’t you cooperate with me?” Tu Bo chuckled and continued to wrestle with his study materials.

Just then, Tu Bo's phone rang.

He looked at the screen and saw it was his grandpa calling.

Tu Bo answered the call, “Hello, Grandpa, what’s up?”

“Tu Bo, tell me… do you think there are really ghosts in this world?” Grandpa Tu Bo asked in a heavy tone.

“Huh? Grandpa, aren’t you always the one who believes in science and not superstition? Why are you suddenly talking about ghosts?” Tu Bo asked, puzzled.

“Lately, I’ve been feeling that something strange is happening. There have been some bizarre incidents in the village, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve seen a ghost,” Grandpa Tu Bo said, sounding rather dispirited.

“……” Tu Bo was at a loss for words. “Old man, you have to believe in science! Science is power; don’t fall for that ghost stuff!”

This sounded so familiar.

This was exactly Grandpa Tu Bo’s catchphrase. Just a month ago, he had earnestly told Fay Yu the same thing.

“You little rascal, are you itching for a fight?” Grandpa Tu Bo shouted angrily.

“Eh, heh heh heh,” Tu Bo let out a nervous laugh.

“I’ve been thinking… I feel like that classmate you brought last time might have some significance. Since you’re about to have a break, why don’t you bring them to visit me afterward?” Grandpa Tu Bo asked, hinting at something.

After all the recent strange happenings in the village, he couldn’t help but recall the young couple who had visited his Luo Xin Village a month ago.

Especially the girl—whenever he thought of her, he couldn’t quite remember what she looked like. He only remembered that she seemed to be a very pretty girl, shrouded in mystery.

Thus, he had the impulse to call Tu Bo.

“Sure thing! Once the holiday begins, I’ll bring Scholar Song to visit you. If the exams go well and I don’t fail, I’ll be there in three days,” Tu Bo replied.

“Great! The sooner, the better,” Grandpa Tu Bo said contentedly, then added, “Good luck on your exams—don’t fail!”

The second half of his sentence was laced with a threatening tone.

Even through the phone, Tu Bo could feel his grandpa’s malice, making him shiver involuntarily.

After hanging up, he frowned slightly. Did something really happen to Grandpa?

“Yangde, do you believe there are ghosts in this world?” he asked, looking at Li Yangde.

“I don’t believe in them,” Li Yangde replied without hesitation.

After a pause, he added, “However, there might be some forces in this world that science can’t yet explain. There are still many mysteries left unsolved.”

“And also… you better not overthink it, or the door to makeup exams might open for you.”

“Can you stop cursing me with makeup exams? Is it still possible to have a pleasant conversation?” Tu Bo grumbled as he picked up his books…

**Before Lunch**

Scholar Song was currently using his computer to watch the ‘Sunflower Cultivator’ video that Dou Dou had recorded.

“So this Sunflower Cultivator is a disciple of the Wuji Demon Sect, and the sect leader sent him to deal with me?” Scholar Song shut off the video. “And the disciple that Venerable White captured was also sent by him to steal the Blood God Drill?”

“From the way he operates, it seems that this Sunflower Cultivator isn’t a subordinate of Young Master Hai.”

Scholar Song’s mind conjured an image of Young Master Hai. If this guy had a subordinate, he would definitely be more extreme, meticulous, and ruthless, unlike the Sunflower Cultivator, who seemed to act on impulse without a solid plan.

If he wasn’t Young Master Hai’s subordinate, then who did the Sunflower Cultivator serve? Could it be that he was simply tempted by profit?

Maybe it was time to ask the captive downstairs.

Scholar Song headed downstairs to confront the tied-up thief from the Empty Sky Sect, who was tossed onto the sofa.

Upon seeing Scholar Song, the Young Master of Sugar puffed up his cheeks and turned away in a huff.

“What’s your relationship with the Sunflower Cultivator?” Scholar Song got straight to the point.

“Who’s the Sunflower Cultivator? I don’t know him,” the Young Master of Sugar declared loyally, though in his heart he thought it was bad news—how did the other party know about the Sunflower Cultivator?

“The disciple of Wuji Demon Sect who commissioned you to steal the Blood God Drill,” Scholar Song said flatly.

The Young Master of Sugar’s pupils constricted slightly. “He’s just an ordinary contractor for me; we don’t have any special relationship.”

“Ha.” Scholar Song stretched out his hand, revealing a charm pendant in his palm.

“If it’s just an ordinary contractor relationship, then you shouldn’t need to hide anything from me. Tell me his identity, his rank in the Wuji Demon Sect, and who he takes orders from,” Scholar Song narrowed his eyes and demanded.

This charm pendant was the treasure of the Sunflower Cultivator, a magical item that could grant its user the ‘Blue Wind Acceleration’ ability. Now that it was in Scholar Song’s hands, it meant that the Sunflower Cultivator was in serious trouble.

“I really don’t know,” the Young Master of Sugar shook his head, forcing a bitter smile. He had merely owed the Sunflower Cultivator a favor and only knew he was a disciple of the Wuji Demon Sect; everything else was a mystery to him.

Scholar Song rubbed his temples, clearly dissatisfied with the response.

“Stubborn people are such a hassle,” he thought. He didn’t have any interrogation techniques; maybe he should take a class on how to interrogate people next time?

“Hey, I’m not being stubborn!” The Young Master of Sugar panicked.

Scholar Song looked at him with a goofy expression. “Do you think I’m going to believe you?”

Just then, Dou Dou happily hopped out. “Let me try! I’m really good at interrogating!”

Feeling bored, it was looking for something fun to do.

“Okay, just don’t take it too far. Venerable White seems to want to keep her around for some reason. Once he’s done with her, if she still doesn’t talk, you can eat her if you want,” Scholar Song added seriously—he intentionally made Dou Dou sound more terrifying to scare the Empty Sky Sect disciple.

Dou Dou complied by making a fierce face, but unfortunately, it still looked like a cute little Pekingese.

Scholar Song sighed gently. He had to find a way to discover which division the Sunflower Cultivator belonged to.

It seemed that Sable Seven was currently working on a mission against the Wuji Demon Sect.

If he could find out which division the Sunflower Cultivator belonged to and relay that information to Sable Seven, he was sure she would be quite pleased…
