**Chapter Begins**

With a face that was both handsome and rugged, the leader of the Jingmo Sect, Scholar Song, returned to his cave residence. He activated a specific formation used to communicate with the ‘Wuji Demon Sect Branch’—after all, the protective formation surrounding the main sect was always active, making it impossible to use mobile phones to contact the outside world.

A cautious Elder Chen from the branch connected through the formation, his voice laced with trepidation. “Master, is there something you need?”

The members of this branch had certainly drawn the short straw by having Scholar Song as their leader. Every single one of them had felt his wrath at some point, leaving a lingering fear that any misstep could result in a severe beating.

“Check on that guy, Gongzi Hai. Half a month ago, after he performed a blood ritual on the Moon Blade Sect, a low-level cultivator snatched a Blood God Diamond from him—can we locate that low-level cultivator now?” Scholar Song commanded in a deep voice.

“Yes, I’ll look into it immediately,” Elder Chen replied hastily.

“Let me know once you have results.” Despite his notorious temper, Scholar Song could maintain a level-headed demeanor when he wasn’t enraged.

Within the branch, Elder Chen quickly organized his subordinates to investigate the Gongzi Hai incident.

The Wuji Demon Sect boasted an extensive intelligence network, with every branch serving as an integral part of it. Each branch had the authority to tap into this vast reservoir of information to find what they needed.

Before long, they unearthed useful information from the Wuji Demon Sect’s intel network.

After losing the Blood God Diamond, Gongzi Hai had once commissioned the intelligence network of the Jiangnan Wuji Demon Sect Branch to investigate the low-level cultivator known as "Shushan Yali Da" (meaning "The Pressure of Shushan"). 

Five days prior, the branch responsible for Jiangnan had submitted a report regarding “Shushan Yali Da.” However, the report was heavily marked with large question marks, indicating that there were numerous ambiguities.

For instance, “Shushan Yali Da” had only appeared publicly as an ordinary student until this year. Yet, a well-known alchemist named “The Alchemical Sage” had developed a good rapport with him seemingly out of nowhere. Additionally, his relationship with Su Clan’s Aqi had also appeared quite suddenly.

Moreover, it seemed that there were several powerful elders lurking behind “Shushan Yali Da,” casting shadows of suspicion.

However, just as the Jiangnan branch attempted to delve deeper into their investigation, disaster struck.

Three days ago, the Jiangnan Demon Sect branch was completely wiped out.

It was the work of Su Clan’s Aqi, who single-handedly dismantled the entire branch with just one sword.

Afterward, Aqi had left gracefully, and the logistics team from the Tianhe Su Clan arrived at the Demon Sect branch, clearing out all the treasures and resources. Even the crucial intelligence documents that hadn’t been destroyed were swept away by the Tianhe Su Clan.

Fortunately, the intelligence materials stored at the branch were not classified at a high level, so they wouldn’t implicate the Wuji Demon Sect directly.

“Crazy Aqi.” Elder Chen shuddered at the thought. One person with a sword had eradicated an entire branch of the Wuji Demon Sect!

A typical branch housed at least 800 disciples, and with the protective formation in place, it could even withstand assaults from newly promoted “Sixth-Grade True Monarchs.” Yet, here was Aqi, a Fifth-Grade Spirit Emperor, who had taken them down with ease.

“Speaking of which... our branch seems to be relatively close to Jiangnan’s branch,” Elder Chen thought, a sudden realization striking him, and he quickly contacted Scholar Song.

“Did you find any information on ‘Shushan Yali Da’?” Scholar Song’s voice came through the formation.

“Yes, Master. I’m sending you the intel on Shushan Yali Da now—also, the Jiangnan branch was destroyed by Su Clan’s Aqi. Considering our proximity to Jiangnan’s branch, should we prepare for any possible repercussions?” Elder Chen cautiously chose his words, hoping to avoid provoking Scholar Song’s temper.

“Tsk, just more trouble brought on by Gongzi Hai, getting involved with that lunatic Aqi! Forget about Aqi; the sect will send someone to deal with him soon! I only need to find ‘Shushan Yali Da.’ Once I review his information, I’ll make a decision,” Scholar Song replied with a heavy tone.

Hearing that the sect would handle Su Clan’s Aqi put Elder Chen at ease.

...

...

After disconnecting the call, Scholar Song couldn’t help but smirk—would the sect really manage to deal with Aqi? Who would they send?

Even the formidable Mad Demon King had suffered losses at Aqi’s hands and had to retreat with Gongzi Hai and his three juniors.

If only his branch could be wiped out by Aqi. Then he could return to the main Wuji Demon Sect!

He couldn’t wait for his branch to meet its end.

Next, Scholar Song pulled out the information about “Shushan Yali Da” that Elder Chen had sent and began to read carefully.

“Heh, so many doubts? What a joke! I can tell at a glance that ‘Shushan Yali Da’ is just a lucky kid who got in tight with the Alchemical Sage and became a cultivator through him! And Aqi already had a good relationship with the Alchemical Sage; it’s normal for them to connect,” Scholar Song believed himself to be quite astute, seeing through the real situation with ease.

He quickly contacted Elder Chen again.

“Elder Chen, send someone smart to find ‘Shushan Yali Da’ and capture him alive. Don’t worry; neither the Alchemical Sage nor Aqi are around him. A mere low-level foundation cultivator should be easy to handle. Once I return, I’ll extract information about the ‘Blood God Diamond’ from him,” Scholar Song declared with a triumphant laugh.

Elder Chen nodded vigorously. “Understood, Master. I’ll arrange for someone to go right away.”

After ending the communication with Scholar Song, Elder Chen sighed to himself and asked his subordinates, “Has anyone in our branch been active in the ‘Jiangnan University Town’ lately?”

“Reporting to the Elder, I heard ‘Little Kuaikua’ applied to go to Jiangnan yesterday, saying he wanted to investigate something.” One subordinate mentioned, shivering at the mere mention of Little Kuaikua.

Little Kuaikua was a First-Grade cultivator currently attempting to break through to the “Leaping Dragon Gate.” He was known for his smooth demeanor and adeptness at concealing his presence, making him a reliable intelligence operative within their branch.

However, despite his cute name, Little Kuaikua was actually a towering brute, standing two meters tall with muscles bulging everywhere. To make matters worse, he had a strikingly handsome face.

Who said a handsome appearance couldn’t come with a powerful physique? Little Kuaikua shattered that stereotype.

“Little Kuaikua... hmm, I think it’s better to call him by his Taoist name, ‘The Sunflower Cultivator’,” Elder Chen stated sternly.

“Yes, the Sunflower Cultivator,” the subordinate replied, feeling that the title was no better and still hard to take seriously.

“Have the Sunflower Cultivator contact ‘Shushan Yali Da’ and see if he can find an opportunity to bring him back. He’s just a recently established foundation cultivator; the Sunflower Cultivator will be more than enough to handle him!” Elder Chen instructed emphatically.

“Got it, I’ll reach out to him right away.” The subordinate pulled out his phone and dialed the Sunflower Cultivator.

After a pleasant ringback tone, the call connected.

“Sunflower Cultivator, there’s a mission,” the subordinate stated directly.

“Ugh, just call me Little Kuaikua!” a gruff voice responded from the other end.

The subordinate rolled his eyes, feeling a headache coming on, and gritted his teeth. “Ahem, Elder Chen wants you to reach out to a newly established foundation cultivator called ‘Shushan Yali Da.’ If possible, bring him back to the sect. I’ll send you his information shortly!”

“Shushan Yali? Oh, I’ve been keeping an eye on his info, no need to send it. Leave the task to me!” the Sunflower Cultivator said before hanging up.

“Wow, I was right! This ‘Shushan Yali Da’ will definitely attract the attention of the Wuji Demon Sect’s higher-ups. If I can capture him, my chance to rise will come!” the Sunflower Cultivator guffawed, flexing his muscles with each hearty laugh.

After finishing his laughter, he dialed another number.

“Hello, is this Sugar Young Master? Haha, it’s me, Little Kuaikua! I need your help with something, could you help me steal something?” the Sunflower Cultivator said.

Sugar Young Master was a nickname for a member of the Empty Thief Sect, known for her exceptional talent in breaking formations and arrays. Since her debut, she had amassed a remarkable track record.

One must never put all their eggs in one basket; always have a backup plan.

The Sunflower Cultivator planned to capture “Shushan Yali Da” head-on.

Meanwhile, he would ask Sugar Young Master to sneak into “Shushan Yali Da’s” home to look for the ‘Blood God Diamond’! Sugar Young Master owed him a favor, and this was the perfect opportunity to cash it in!

**Chapter Ends**

At this moment, Scholar Song was riding the bus with Venerable White.

“Strange, why does the bus feel so crowded today?” Scholar Song mused, noticing that the number of people on the bus had increased several times compared to before, cramming into the cabin.

Moreover, it seemed that the crowd was constantly pushing toward where he and Venerable White were seated.

Wait! They were pushing toward **his** spot?

Scholar Song quickly looked up to scan the surrounding crowd—sure enough, most of the people were staring at Venerable White, their eyes glazed over, with some even blushing and breathing rapidly.

Could it be the unusual charm radiating from Venerable White affecting them?

No, that couldn’t be right; Venerable White had reined in that charm after coming out of seclusion!

After he emerged, Scholar Song had been able to look at Venerable White without feeling that uncontrollable heartbeat. Why had this strange charm reappeared?

Scholar Song quickly turned his gaze towards Venerable White.

And then... he saw Venerable White staring blankly into space, lost in thought.

After watching him for a moment, Scholar Song found his own heartbeat accelerating uncontrollably.

Next time, I won’t take Venerable White on the bus again, Scholar Song vowed silently.

Thankfully, they reached their stop soon.

“Venerable, we’ve arrived!” Scholar Song patted Venerable White to wake him up from his daze.

Venerable White snapped back to reality, chuckling, “Oh? So soon?”

The two finally squeezed off the bus.

“Let’s go; we need to buy you a new phone and a SIM card,” Scholar Song sighed.

Once they returned to Jiangnan University Town, he promised himself he would choose a less crowded route!

Scholar Song thought to himself.

There were indeed a few less crowded routes, but they would require a significant detour...
