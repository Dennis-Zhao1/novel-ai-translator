**Little Zhuge Yue**

Because Zhuge Zhongyang and Zhuge Yue were still on Heavenly Realm Island, Scholar Song felt an urgent need to search for them. Regardless of whether they were alive or dead, he had to go see for himself. If they were still alive, he would do everything he could to bring them safely back to the Ancient City.

“Oh? Are you planning to settle down on Heavenly Realm Island, Scholar Song?” Jiu Deng suddenly asked, a bright smile lighting up her face.

“……” Scholar Song paused for a moment, then replied, “Ahem, I have two friends who got separated from me when we entered Heavenly Realm Island. I want to find them first before leaving.”

“Oh? You have friends on Heavenly Realm Island?” Master Jiu Deng stroked her smooth chin thoughtfully. “Do you need me to help you look for them? I do have some connections on the island!”

Scholar Song was naturally eager for Jiu Deng’s assistance, even though he wasn’t quite sure what her status on Heavenly Realm Island was. She seemed to hold a significant position… If she were to help, finding Zhuge Zhongyang and Zhuge Yue would surely be much easier.

However, as Jiu Deng expressed her enthusiastic willingness to help, Scholar Song couldn’t shake off an uneasy feeling. In the past, he had learned to let go of certain doubts, but her eagerness felt a bit off—almost like she was being overly cordial without a clear reason. Was he being too suspicious?

After considering it for a moment, Scholar Song decided to ask, “Master Jiu Deng, do you need my help with something? If there’s anything you need, feel free to tell me.”

“You’re overthinking it! I don’t want anything. I’m just bored and thought I could accompany you around Heavenly Realm Island. After all, I’m practically a half-host here, and it’s my duty to show guests around!” Jiu Deng chuckled. “And you can just call me Jiu Deng.”

“Then… I’d appreciate your help, Jiu Deng.” Scholar Song replied—no matter what Jiu Deng’s intentions were, all he wanted was to find Zhuge Yue and Zhuge Zhongyang. Then, they would head straight to the Ancient City’s high tower, complete their transaction, and leave Heavenly Realm Island.

After leaving… regardless of whether his memories were sealed or completely erased, he would no longer have any ties to Heavenly Realm Island. They would part ways and take their own paths!

As soon as Scholar Song finished speaking, Jiu Deng gave him a thumbs-up. “You used the term ‘girl’ very well! I like it.”

Scholar Song: “…”

How on earth could he sync his thoughts with Master Jiu Deng’s erratic train of thought?

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

Three minutes later.

Scholar Song and Jiu Deng arrived at the city gates.

The massive gates… remained open at a height of two meters, showing no signs of closing.

Did Master Jiu Deng already know he would be leaving and therefore didn’t bother to close the gates? Scholar Song pondered.

While he was lost in thought, Jiu Deng led him through the gates.

Then, she slapped the gate with considerable force. “Wake up, you lazy gate!”

In the next moment, two red question marks appeared on the gate, and it closed with an embarrassed shudder.

Scholar Song: “…”

Was the gate asleep? It seemed like this gate was also an enchanted object, possibly even one with a spirit of its own. But it definitely had some personality!

After closing the gate, Jiu Deng turned to Scholar Song and said, “Let’s go find your friends.”

“Does Jiu Deng have a way to find them quickly?” Scholar Song inquired.

“With me around, don’t worry! Finding your friends will be easy—we’ll start from roughly where you entered Heavenly Realm Island and follow their lingering presence to find them. That is, unless your two friends accidentally wandered into some beast’s territory and got eaten!” Jiu Deng said confidently.

Scholar Song nodded silently. After all, tracking someone by scent was a skill any cultivator with their ‘nasal acupoint’ opened could master. However, Scholar Song hadn’t trained for it specifically and couldn’t yet use his sense of smell to track people.

…

…

Afterward, Scholar Song described the location of the plane crash.

Jiu Deng led him to the wreckage of the aircraft.

“This is where the plane’s wreckage is located. About twenty passengers survived the crash,” Scholar Song explained. “But among those who survived, my two friends weren’t here. I suspect they might be on another piece of wreckage.”

“I understand.” Master Jiu Deng closed her eyes for a moment to sense the surroundings. “From this area as a center, I can feel two groups of people. One group consists of eight individuals who were near the wreckage and are currently wandering in the jungle… Quite daring, indeed.”

Eight people near the wreckage? That must be the group of old professors who had split off from them. Their team was exactly eight people, and it seemed they hadn’t encountered any terrifying beasts or giant eagles, so they were lucky.

“The other group is a combination of four individuals, perhaps they are the ones you’re looking for. Should we go take a look?” Jiu Deng suggested.

“Then please lead me to find those four people,” Scholar Song nodded in agreement.

“Follow me.” Master Jiu Deng surprisingly complied without any signs of mischief.

From her demeanor, it seemed she genuinely had no ulterior motives—just a spontaneous decision?

…

…

Jiu Deng swiftly approached the massive jungle, her speed remarkable, while Scholar Song had to exert himself with the ‘Gentleman’s Journey’ technique just to keep up with her pace.

“Your movement style is quite impressive,” Jiu Deng said, glancing back at Scholar Song with a smile.

“I’ve been fortunate to meet a good senior who taught me this technique,” Scholar Song replied.

“Hmm, it suits you well.” Jiu Deng nodded. “I’ll speed up a bit more, so keep up!”

With that, she accelerated her pace through the jungle.

Scholar Song gritted his teeth and pushed himself to the limit with the ‘Gentleman’s Journey,’ barely managing to stay behind her.

“Not bad, you’re keeping up well.” Jiu Deng looked back at him with a grin.

“I’m already doing my best! If you speed up any more, I won’t be able to keep up, Jiu Deng!” Scholar Song said between breaths.

At that moment… Jiu Deng gave him another thumbs-up. “You used the phrase ‘doing your best’ well! I like it!”

Scholar Song was left speechless.

“Almost there.” Just then, Jiu Deng suddenly stopped, sniffing the air.

As she spoke, Scholar Song caught a whiff of Zhuge Yue’s scent.

He hurriedly looked in the direction the scent was coming from.

“Scholar Song?” a faint voice called out from that direction.

There sat Zhuge Yue, leaning against a towering tree, her delicate face lifted as she gazed at Scholar Song, looking adorably doll-like…

The comparison was spot on—because Zhuge Yue, at this moment, was indeed no bigger than a doll!
