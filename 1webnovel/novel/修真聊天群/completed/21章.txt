**Poison Dragon Grass, How Dangerous!**

As Fay Yu danced gracefully in the air, her heart simmered with frustration—she had been outsmarted by a mere Phantom Spirit. And worse, it had all happened in front of Scholar Song!

The tale of the Ghost Lantern Temple and the Phantom Spirits was something she had stumbled upon in an old notebook belonging to her father.

Years ago, her father had passed through this area and witnessed a Phantom Spirit on the verge of maturity.

Phantom Spirits were rare treasures; even a low-tier adult Phantom Spirit could form a contract with its master, allowing for a shared consciousness and energy exchange. This meant that having multiple low-tier Phantom Spirits effectively increased one’s energy reserves!

However, low-tier Phantom Spirits could only ascend to the third rank of the acquired realm at most.

Once a Phantom Spirit reached mid-tier or higher, it possessed decent offensive capabilities and could cultivate at a speed comparable to ordinary cultivators. With proper training, it could advance to the sixth rank of Spirit Monarch, making it an invaluable assistant for cultivators.

Additionally, mid-tier Phantom Spirits often came equipped with one or two innate skills. With a stroke of luck, these skills could double their master's combat power.

As for high-tier Phantom Spirits, they possessed intelligence on par with humans and cultivated even faster than ordinary cultivators. They could even learn ghostly spells and, at their peak, transcend into ghostly immortals, rivaling legendary techniques of avatars. However, high-tier Phantom Spirits were nearly mythical, with historical records showing fewer than five existing over thousands of years.

Moreover, mid-tier and above Phantom Spirits could refine their master's energy. Whether it be blood essence, true energy, or spiritual energy, they could purify and enhance the quality of these through their connection.

Once contracted, they would never betray their master, working tirelessly without complaint. Aside from not being able to warm the bed or produce offspring, Phantom Spirits were practically the ideal companions.

Unfortunately, their numbers had always been scarce, scarcely seen in ancient times and nearly extinct in modern society.

When Master Ling Die encountered a Phantom Spirit, he was astonished that such wild spirits could still exist in this era—like stumbling upon a living Tyrannosaurus Rex in a bustling city.

Regrettably, the Phantom Spirit he found was not yet mature, so Master Ling Die purchased the Ghost Lantern Temple and set up a simple seal to trap the spirit, waiting for it to grow.

To him, such a low-tier Phantom Spirit was simply too weak; even a mature one held little value. But with a daughter on the way, he thought it would be a fine gift for her in the future.

However, it seemed that Master Ling Die had forgotten about it? He never mentioned the Ghost Lantern Temple to his daughter. Perhaps, for someone of his stature, a single Phantom Spirit was utterly inconsequential.

Then, Fay Yu had ‘accidentally’ discovered her father's old notebook.

Seizing the opportunity while her father was busy dealing with the Wild Blade of Three Tides, she quietly embarked on a journey to J City, determined to capture this Phantom Spirit.

Everything had begun smoothly, but what she hadn’t anticipated was that there were two Phantom Spirits in the Ghost Lantern Temple!

While she was busy beating one Phantom Spirit, the second one had ambushed her from the shadows, leaving her in a mess.

Her father had sealed only one Phantom Spirit, so why were there two? Who had placed the other one there?

Furthermore, how could a mere Phantom Spirit leave her feeling so humiliated?

...

To subdue a Phantom Spirit, there were two methods: one was the emotional route, spending time with the spirit to create a bond that transcended the realms of human and spirit. If feelings blossomed, subjugating the spirit would naturally follow. This approach required a significant amount of charisma and presence; lacking these could lead to becoming the Phantom Spirit’s next meal.

The other method was brute force—larger fists meant stronger arguments. This straightforward approach involved beating the spirit into submission until it was nearly incapacitated.

Fay Yu opted for the latter.

As a third-rank Acquired Realm Warrior, her true energy was solidified into a true river, flowing endlessly, and her fists were as hard as steel! With a powerful father backing her, she was equipped with divine attire, effortlessly slaying gods and spirits alike!

Though she was startled by the Phantom Spirit’s ambush, that was the extent of it!

“Come forth, talismans!” Fay Yu shouted, twirling her hands as two shimmering gold talismans shot forth, aimed straight at the two Phantom Spirits.

She typically preferred not to use talismans, but her irritation pushed her to take swift action to subdue the two spirits.

Upon contact with the talismans, the spirits erupted in green smoke, shrieking pitifully as they rapidly weakened. Seizing the opportunity, Fay Yu closed in, her form a blur as she unleashed a flurry of strikes against the spirits, forcing them to retreat.

With every slap from her small hands, the Phantom Spirits emitted cracking sounds as their bodies threatened to shatter.

She was deliberately controlling her strength, aiming to merely injure the spirits rather than eradicate them. If she unleashed her full power, a single strike would surely send the spirits’ souls scattering.

Driven to their limits, the two spirits revealed their trump cards.

“Roar!” one spirit shouted, summoning a golden shield that surged toward Fay Yu.

The other spirit echoed its call, bathed in a crimson glow that suddenly doubled its size.

Innate skills! Both spirits were indeed mid-tier Phantom Spirits.

“Is this all you have?” Fay Yu’s gaze sharpened like a blade, her hands clasped together, transforming into a butterfly shape: “If this is the extent of your abilities, then surrender to me!”

Using a secret technique of Ling Die Island, the Butterfly Dance of the Palms, she specialized in breaking various shields. The amateur protective barrier summoned by a Phantom Spirit was child’s play for her.

With a single palm strike, the golden shield shattered like glass, and the spirit behind it was severely injured, collapsing to the ground with visible cracks forming on its body.

Now, all she needed to do was initiate the contract to bind it to her.

Just then, the other spirit, glowing red and swollen, charged forward, lifting its fallen companion as it darted toward the exit, intent on escaping.

Though Fay Yu was strong, her lack of experience in confronting foes resulted in the two spirits slipping right through her fingers.

Enhanced by their size increase, the spirit had gained considerable strength, smashing through the binding array Fay Yu had set up.

With the array destroyed, the two spirits charged toward Scholar Song, aiming to siphon his life force to heal their injuries before facing off against the terrifying woman behind them.

As for escape? That thought never crossed their minds—if they could merely flee, would they have lingered in this place for over sixty years?

Mid-tier Phantom Spirits were known for their considerable intelligence.

...

Meanwhile, Scholar Song was bending down to pick up his phone, which had fallen to the ground.

“Not good, Scholar!” Fay Yu cried out in alarm, her right foot stomping down hard as she transformed into a colorful butterfly, darting toward the two Phantom Spirits like a streak of light!

But the spirit that had activated its innate ability surged forward with reckless abandon, ignoring Fay Yu’s assault as it charged toward Scholar Song. They were determined to drag someone down with them!

As the two spirits lunged toward Scholar Song, he remained unfazed. He first grabbed his phone and switched on the flashlight, illuminating the ground—he had caught a glimpse of a peculiar plant while bending down.

In the glow of his phone, he recognized the plant—it was curled and growing like a coiled dragon, its tip adorned with sharp barbs, and its root was a deep purple-black.

Wait a minute, wasn’t this the “Poison Dragon Grass” that the Alchemical Sage had mentioned in the Ninefold Land group?!

Without a second thought, Scholar Song grasped the plant firmly and yanked it out of the ground—if Fay Yu saw this, she would undoubtedly find a way to present it to the Alchemical Sage.

Given that the Alchemical Sage might toss this into a pot and boil it for five minutes before consuming it, it could very well be fatal!

Thus, until he confirmed whether this plant posed any danger to humans, Scholar Song was determined to keep it hidden from Fay Yu.

Bang!

As he pulled the plant free, a loud crash echoed in his ears, as if something heavy had slammed into a wall. Looking up, he saw nothing out of the ordinary—only Fay Yu not far away, her face a mix of astonishment and excitement.
