**Don't worry, I have the Blood Escape Technique!**

Imagine a scenario where someone is driving, suddenly loses control of their vehicle, and just so happens to collide with a distracted pedestrian ahead. This could lead to a tragic disaster.

The cold-faced swordsman suddenly felt something bump against his lower back. Before he could comprehend what was happening, he was thrust forward, propelled by an unseen force, moving swiftly through the air with a 'whoosh.'

“Eh? What just happened?” The cold-faced man snapped out of his deep thoughts, turning his head calmly. What he saw was a young man with a wry smile, his body enveloped in the glow of the 'Escape Technique,' with his head repeatedly bumping against the swordsman’s lower back as he spun wildly in the air.

At that moment, the cold-faced man, a Fifth-Rank Golden Core Spirit Sovereign, was naturally strong, and the young man's continuous bumping only sent a tingling sensation through him. 

Though it didn’t hurt, having a grown man pushing against his lower back made him feel extremely uneasy, evoking memories of a forgotten, cringe-worthy chapter from his past over a hundred years ago.

With a twitching mouth, the cold-faced man asked, “What are you doing, junior?”

“Wuwu~” Scholar Song cried out in distress, trying to respond but failing to articulate anything. 

He didn’t want to spin around like this, but when the 'Ten Thousand Mile Escape Technique' activated to show off and whisk him away, he collided with something mid-flight, causing his body to drill into it like a drill bit, spinning madly as if trying to penetrate the obstacle before him.

He was already dizzy, and speaking was becoming increasingly difficult.

Just then, he heard a voice behind him—Captain Jing Mo was rapidly closing in, yelling, “You little brat, where do you think you’re going? Take this sword from me!!”

With a flash of light beneath his feet, a pitch-black flying sword transformed into a beam of lightning, slicing towards Scholar Song… and inadvertently enveloping the cold-faced man as well.

The cold-faced man thought, “…”

Did he forget to read the omens before heading out today? What a string of bad luck he was facing!

He slightly raised his sword, not even drawing it from its sheath, and waved it dismissively like swatting away a fly.

*Smack!*

The bolt of lightning shattered, reverting to a pitch-black flying sword that was knocked back toward Captain Jing Mo.

“Junior, when you strike, aim at your target! Didn’t your elders teach you that? Next time, if you pull me into your mess again without aiming properly, don’t blame me for being rude!” The cold-faced man glared at Captain Jing Mo, his voice cold and authoritative—though it was hard to take him seriously with Scholar Song still spinning against him.

Captain Jing Mo snorted coldly, gathering his true essence silently. 

From the cold-faced man’s words, he inferred that this man was not affiliated with the troublesome 'Scholar Song.' However, he was curious as to why this cold-faced man was entangled with him at all.

But that was fine—so long as the cold-faced man wasn’t a backup for 'Scholar Song,' he’d just wait for 'Scholar Song's escape technique to wear off, and then he’d strike the moment they separated.

As he pondered, the light of the escape technique surrounding Scholar Song began to dim, and his speed slowed down.

“Is the escape technique finally over?” Captain Jing Mo sneered.

“Am I finally reaching Venerable White?” Scholar Song thought to himself, though his vision was entirely blocked by the cold-faced man, preventing him from seeing where Venerable White was located.

“…” The cold-faced man was in shock as he caught sight of a figure that, by all logic, shouldn’t exist in the world and had only appeared in his hallucinations before.

＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊＊

In the forbidden area of the Five Finger Mountain Seal.

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain, Venerable White, and Tang Tang from the Empty Thief Sect stood quietly in a corner, ensuring they were out of sight from the Cloud Mist Daoist.

The three watched patiently, waiting for the Cloud Mist Daoist to break free from the seal.

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain was quite curious about how the Cloud Mist Daoist would ‘take revenge’ on him once he emerged.

The Cloud Mist Daoist was diligently working to break the 'Five Finger Mountain Seal,' but over the past two hundred years, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain had steadily improved his sealing techniques. His 'Five Finger Mountain Seal' had evolved to version 017. If the Cloud Mist Daoist wanted to steal from him again, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain wouldn’t mind sealing him away for several decades more.

Meanwhile, Venerable White was meditating, waiting for the Cold Flame Sword from the Empty Thief Sect to arrive so he could retrieve his stolen Meteor Sword.

Beside Venerable White, Tang Tang seemed a bit out of sorts. She tightly clutched her clothing, occasionally sneaking glances at Venerable White. 

Just a moment ago, Venerable White had demonstrated his ability to freely control his aura, and Tang Tang had been completely captivated.

“How… dazzling,” she murmured, feeling as if, perhaps, she had fallen in love?

[The story of a female disciple from the Empty Thief Sect who was caught stealing by a handsome senior and taken captive, only to have the sparks of love ignite between them over time…] This tale had been circulating among the female disciples of the Empty Thief Sect for centuries, yet it never lost its appeal.

Tang Tang felt that she was about to live out a real-life version of the ‘Empty Thief Sect’s domineering handsome senior’ story.

…

…

Suddenly, Venerable White opened his eyes and gazed at the sky.

In the next moment, Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain also felt something and turned his attention skyward.

The clouds shrouding the forbidden area of the Five Finger Mountain Seal couldn’t hide the gaze of Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain or Venerable White. In fact, these clouds only served to obstruct Fourth-Rank cultivators and below; they were ineffective against those who had condensed their Golden Core.

“There are three figures approaching here,” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain remarked, his brow furrowing slightly—this was a critical moment for the Cloud Mist Daoist to break free, and he didn’t want anyone to disrupt his ‘fun.’

“It’s Scholar Song!” Venerable White chuckled, pointing toward the sky at the cold-faced man behind Scholar Song—the one who was being propelled by him.

“Oh, so that’s Scholar Song?” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain said, looking at the young man spinning in the air.

He had been in harmonious connection with Scholar Song for a long time; he always felt that this young man lived in a constant state of adversity, having to care for Venerable White and also look after Dou Dou.

His plans to give Scholar Song a red envelope were growing larger by the day.

“However, he doesn’t seem quite right at the moment?” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain asked, squinting. Had he misread the situation? Scholar Song appeared to be foaming at the mouth, looking utterly miserable.

“Hmm, I gave him a 'Ten Thousand Mile Escape Technique' for emergencies, allowing him to escape to my side. It seems he’s run into some trouble,” Venerable White observed, his eyes narrowing on the last figure in the sky.

That figure had a sinister expression, silver hair, and eyes flickering with lightning, fixated on Scholar Song with murderous intent.

“Looks like Scholar Song bumped into someone while using the escape technique? No matter, let’s save him first.” Venerable White said with a gentle smile.

In the sky, the cold-faced man being propelled by Scholar Song was only a Fifth-Rank Spirit Sovereign, while the one chasing them was even weaker at Fourth-Rank.

—Both were opponents Venerable White could easily dispose of with a wave of his hand.

Venerable White reached out, summoning his power to dispel the 'Ten Thousand Mile Escape Technique.'

After spinning for too long and feeling nauseous, Scholar Song finally stopped spinning and was gently drawn toward Venerable White by his power.

The cold-faced man, who had been pushed along by Scholar Song all this way, was also caught by Venerable White's power and dragged over. Venerable White looked at Scholar Song and the cold-faced man, his gaze eventually landing on the sword in the cold-faced man’s hand.

It was his Meteor Sword.

Meaning, this cold-faced man must be Liu Tianzong, the Cold Flame Sword from the Empty Thief Sect, who had been delivered right to him by Scholar Song.

“Hmm, not bad luck,” Venerable White thought to himself.

Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain felt a chill run down his spine, his senses heightened as he scanned his surroundings—every time Venerable White had good fortune, it often meant misfortune for those around him.

But for now, it seemed that no misfortunes were about to unfold?

As Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain pondered, Captain Jing Mo was already drawing closer to the 'Five Finger Mountain Seal' forbidden area. With his cultivation level, he was unable to pierce through the ‘mist’ of the forbidden area.

Thus, he naturally couldn’t see the 'Venerable White' and 'Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain' hidden within the fog.

“You little brat, do you really think you can escape from me by diving into the mist?!” Captain Jing Mo shouted angrily, though he didn’t dare to enter the mist.

Who knows what might be lurking in there? Better to be cautious.

So he summoned his flying sword, raising it to the sky and reciting a spell. Then, with a powerful swing of his sword: “Heavenly Thunder Summoning Technique!”

Boom! Boom! Boom…

In the sky, a thunder dragon was summoned by his flying sword, crashing down from above.

The thunder dragon roared and clawed, coming to life as it aimed to obliterate everything within the heavy mist.

“Tsk, the Thunder Summoning Technique of the Wujimou Sect?” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain scoffed, making no other movements as he suddenly appeared beneath the thunder dragon.

“Whoosh!” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain blew a gentle breath at the thunder dragon…

That domineering, clawing thunder dragon was blown away like smoke, vanishing into thin air.

Captain Jing Mo was taken aback by this sight.

To travel through the air without the aid of any artifact was something only a Fifth-Rank Golden Core Spirit Sovereign could achieve.

But to extinguish his 'Heavenly Thunder Summoning Technique' with just a breath—it could only be done by a true sovereign.

Sixth-Rank True Monarch!

“Young one, I’m the branch leader of the Wujimou Sect, Jing Mo. May I ask if you have any ties to that ‘Scholar Song’?” Captain Jing Mo nervously gripped the talisman for the 'Blood Escape Technique' in his hand, feeling a little more assured.

With this treasure, even a Sixth-Rank True Monarch couldn’t hold him back!

“Hmm, we are friends,” Immortal Sage of Yellow Mountain replied.

Damn it, without hesitation, Jing Mo activated the 'Blood Escape Technique,' transforming into a mist of blood that scattered in all directions.

This 'Blood Escape Technique' was quite famous; the blood mist would eventually converge again at a certain location, reassembling into a living Jing Mo.

If any part of the blood mist were destroyed along the way, it would only incur minor injuries, and a few days of recovery would suffice to restore him.
