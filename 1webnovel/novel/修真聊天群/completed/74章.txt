**My Awakening, for You to See!**

Scholar Song clenched his fists tightly. The man's appearance matched precisely with the description Lin Tao had given him of the individual who had paid to gather information about him.

So it was indeed this group of people—he had told Jiang Ziyan this morning that he would be prepared for what lay ahead. Now, it was time to see just how far his preparation would take him!

At that moment, the tall man suddenly turned his head, looking directly at Scholar Song’s position.

Then, he lowered his gaze and opened Zhao Yay's phone, dialing a number.

Scholar Song's phone rang in his pocket—Zhao Yay's number. The man had discovered his presence.

This was something he had anticipated. After all, he had only practiced his foundational techniques for two days, and today was the first time he had attempted spiritual techniques. It was only natural that the other party would notice him.

Scholar Song answered the call.

The tall man wore a sinister smile as Zhao Yay's voice emerged from his lips, “Found you, Scholar Song.”

After saying this, he hung up the phone.

Following that, the tall man lifted the unconscious Zhao Yay and swiftly headed toward the dead-end alley behind the wedding photo studio.

Scholar Song ended the call, tightly shutting his eyes to calm his mind. Moments later, he left the Guoxin Building, chasing after the tall man's trail.

...

...

In a dead-end alley.

Zhao Yay sat limply against the wall, looking unharmed.

Scholar Song stood five meters away from the tall man.

The tall man looked up at Scholar Song, a smug grin spreading across his face. He used Zhao Yay's voice to say, “You made it, Scholar Song! Oh my, you look rather unwell.”

Yet, in truth, Scholar Song's expression remained stoic.

“How interesting. Back in the building, you didn’t seem surprised by my presence—only angry. Did you already know about me? How unexpected. I was hoping to give you a surprise,” the tall man continued in Zhao Yay's voice.

Scholar Song remained expressionless.

“Are you really that interested in my voice? Don’t be so angry; changing voices is just a little trick,” the tall man boasted, shifting back to his deep, hoarse male voice.

Not only his voice, but the tall man could also change his physique at will.

“However, I’m glad you made it here, as it shows you care about this woman beside me. Her identity is your cousin, isn’t it?” the tall man said in a mocking tone. “It's hilarious that you would care about the safety of a mere mortal! So, Scholar Song, answer me—are you here for ‘worldly cultivation’ or are you just an ordinary mortal?”

Scholar Song continued to remain expressionless.

“I've gathered all the information regarding you. You’re just a mortal kid, and all the records from your childhood indicate that you are completely ordinary!” The tall man suddenly screamed in frustration. “I can't understand why the master would be wary of an ordinary person like you! He even believes you’re a senior cultivator undergoing ‘worldly trials’, convinced that everything in your files is fabricated. He thinks your so-called family and friends are just strangers to you, incapable of threatening you. He even evacuated the Jiangnan University Town!”

Scholar Song still remained expressionless—yet he had gleaned some interesting information.

“He completely dismissed my intel, and even the ‘Body Refinement Liquid’ that was supposed to be my reward has vanished. All of this is because of you, Scholar Song! Just an ordinary person, why is the master so suspicious?” the tall man raged. “Now, tell me, Scholar Song. Tell me—you are just an ordinary mortal! Then, in this unnoticed dead-end alley, let me kill you! After that, I can tell the master that you are a mortal, and I'll claim the Body Refinement Liquid that belongs to me!”

“Don’t even think about escaping from me; I’m a cultivator with open eye and nasal orifices. You don’t stand a chance of getting away! No one will come to save you in this dead-end! I will kill you, then dissolve your body with corpse-dissolving liquid; you won’t have any chance to escape!”

The tall man took off his sunglasses, revealing bloodshot eyes.

He had snapped. Despite having thoroughly investigated Scholar Song’s information, and with the precious ‘Body Refinement Liquid’ within reach to elevate his cultivation to the next level, enabling him to open his third orifice—his ear orifice.

But just then, the master had reprimanded him, declaring all his intel was incorrect. Not only had the promised Body Refinement Liquid disappeared, but he had also lost his share of the liquid for the year.

More importantly, he had lost the master’s trust, and his future now seemed bleak.

This slew of setbacks had hit him hard, pushing him beyond what he could mentally handle. So, he had taken matters into his own hands, targeting Scholar Song and kidnapping Zhao Yay.

He aimed to kill Scholar Song and prove his worth to the master.

“Now it all makes sense; I understand everything,” Scholar Song said solemnly, finally breaking his silence.

No wonder the hidden ‘master’ hadn’t directly tried to seize the spirit demon from him. Instead, he had gone through such lengths to investigate his background and even sent subordinates to test him first. Such caution!

It turned out that like Fay Yu at the beginning, they believed he was a powerful senior cultivator.

Scholar Song speculated that the moment he and Fay Yu had stepped into the Luo Xin district of J City, they had already been targeted by the master’s people. The way Fay Yu kept referring to him as ‘senior’ and her own display of strength had led them to mistakenly think he was a formidable expert undergoing ‘worldly trials.’

Moreover, the coincidental poison incident involving the Alchemical Sage had only further solidified that belief.

What was more, the master’s ‘evacuation from the Jiangnan area’ implied that he had been nearby the Jiangnan University Town all along... which meant that the one who had poisoned him twice could very well be the master himself.

The fact that the master was cautious was good news for him.

“Well then…” Scholar Song fixed his gaze on the tall man, ready to use him to validate his awakening—the harsh reality of the cultivator world.

This was a dead-end alley, perfectly chosen by the tall man for its obscurity. Besides, the tall man had corpse-dissolving liquid on him, capable of erasing all traces.

As long as he covered up properly, this place would likely remain undiscovered for a while even after a murder took place.

The tall man was a cultivator with open eye and nasal orifices, and the ‘Stench Pills’ given to him by the Alchemical Sage might just come in handy. Before using the Stench Pills, he needed to bait the tall man into revealing a flaw—at the very least, getting him to move away from Zhao Yay!

“Answer me, Scholar Song!” the tall man yelled, his eyes wild as he pointed a knife without a handle at him.

Scholar Song replied, “Body Refinement Liquid.”

“What?”

“Is this what you’re after?” Scholar Song reached into his pocket with his left hand, pulling out a small vial and popping the cap with his thumb. Instantly, the unique pungent odor of the Body Refinement Liquid spread through the air.

“Body Refinement Liquid!” The tall man’s muscles tensed.

“Want it?” Scholar Song asked calmly.

“Throw it over to me!” the tall man demanded.

“Come get it yourself; I’m just an ordinary mortal, you have nothing to fear. I can give you this Body Refinement Liquid, but only if you let my sister go. I can give you even more.”

The tall man’s eyes widened in disbelief. “More?”

“Yes, more. Enough for you to use for a long time!” Scholar Song’s voice lured him in like a devil's whisper.

The dazed tall man stared at Scholar Song for a long moment, then cautiously stepped closer.

Scholar Song held the vial of Body Refinement Liquid with both hands, offering it to him with an innocent expression.

Each step he took toward the vial, the tall man’s eyes lit up with greed. Suddenly, he pushed off the ground with his right foot and lunged toward Scholar Song like an arrow, reaching for the vial of Body Refinement Liquid.

Regardless of whether Scholar Song had a trick up his sleeve, he was confident that with his incredible speed, he could snatch the Body Refinement Liquid without fearing any deception.

If this Body Refinement Liquid was genuine and Scholar Song could keep providing it, perhaps he would really consider sparing their lives—temporarily!

Blinded by greed and riches, the tall man completely overlooked why Scholar Song possessed the Body Refinement Liquid in the first place. Why was he able to produce so much of it?
