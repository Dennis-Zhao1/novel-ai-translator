**One-time Flying Sword, Launch!**

It seemed that Venerable White's blessing indeed came with side effects.

**Clang!**

In the sky, Dou Dou transformed and soared upward, slapping down on the wine-red gourd.

The massive wine-red gourd was instantly sent flying, spinning back into the sky.

“Woof!” Dou Dou's avatar looked incredibly majestic, its gaze coldly fixed on the heights.

There, two figures were hiding in the darkness of the night.

After being knocked away, the wine-red gourd returned to the feet of one of the men, who wore a proud expression.

The other figure was a man with a silver hedgehog hairstyle, his eyes flashing with lightning.

It was none other than Master Jing Mo, the leader of the gang, and his friend, the Half-Gourd Daoist. Both were coldly staring at Scholar Song and Dou Dou’s avatar.

“Oh? There's even a beast to protect him?” The Half-Gourd Daoist said, slightly surprised. “And from the looks of it, this beast seems to have at least fourth-grade cultivation.”

How could this little guy, who was only at first-grade, have such a powerful beast? Could it be he was the illegitimate son of a powerful sect leader?

“Hmph, one beast alone won't be enough to shield him. Besides, this beast isn't its true self; it’s merely a semblance, a form of projection that can’t last long,” Master Jing Mo said coldly, standing steadily in the air, surrounded by mist that seemed to be a form of flying artifact.

However, he had flown all the way to J City on his flying sword.

The flying sword beneath him... had now launched a surprise attack!

**Clang!**

Sparks erupted from Scholar Song's body as a sinister black flying sword appeared from the void, striking his 'armor talisman' shield.

With just one hit, the armor talisman shield shattered!

That armor talisman was powerful enough to withstand a full-force strike from a third-grade cultivator, yet it was cut through so easily. The opponent was a fourth-grade cultivator—Scholar Song finally understood!

—Was it really necessary to be this ruthless? I’m just a first-grade fledgling cultivator! Can’t you at least arrange for me an opponent of the same realm so I can have a proper match?

“Tsk, you have quite a few treasures on you. But it’s useless. No matter how many treasures you have, you won’t escape my grasp!” Master Jing Mo said coldly, his hand tightening into a fist.

The black flying sword swung again, aiming for Scholar Song's back, moving at breakneck speed.

The flying sword was a technique to take an enemy's head from a thousand miles away!

With his armor talisman destroyed and the second talisman yet to be activated, Scholar Song could only watch as the sword was about to strike down!

**Whoosh!** Dou Dou’s avatar flickered, instantly covering a distance of over twenty meters. With another swift paw, it accurately struck the black flying sword.

Just like the wine-red gourd before, the black flying sword was sent spinning back to Master Jing Mo's feet.

“This beast is no ordinary creature,” the Half-Gourd Daoist said in a deep voice. That instant of crossing over twenty meters was even faster than the flying sword!

“No matter, its power is still only around fourth-grade. I’ll hold it off; you take down that little brat!” Master Jing Mo sneered, his eyes flickering with lightning. He once again controlled the black flying sword, this time targeting Dou Dou’s avatar, preventing it from aiding Scholar Song.

The Half-Gourd Daoist slightly nodded, activating the gourd in his hand once more.

However, this time he wasn’t using the gourd to smash Scholar Song; he opened the gourd's stopper: “Absorb!”

As his words fell, a force of attraction surged from the gourd, pulling at Scholar Song’s body. Most of the Half-Gourd Daoist's powers were contained within this wine-red gourd, which possessed several miraculous functions.

“Woof!” Dou Dou’s avatar roared, leaping to return and assist Scholar Song.

“Not so fast!” Master Jing Mo laughed, blocking Dou Dou’s avatar with his sword, a flurry of sword lights cascading down. Though he had a flawed temperament, his strength was undeniably solid.

This barrage of sword lights completely enveloped Dou Dou’s avatar, trapping it and preventing it from utilizing its astonishing speed.

Unable to return for help, Dou Dou's avatar angrily turned to grapple with Master Jing Mo.

At this moment, Scholar Song's body was being pulled upward, drawn by the gourd's power.

Is this gourd wielded by a fourth-grade cultivator as well?

If that’s the case… it’s time to use this treasure!

Scholar Song reached for his waist and firmly grasped the "One-time Flying Sword 004 Version."

There was only one opportunity; he would see how effective the defensive item Venerable White left him actually was. If it turned out to be useless, he had no choice but to activate the ‘Ten Thousand Miles Escape Technique’ tattooed on his body.

As he was being pulled into the air, Scholar Song gripped the "Flying Sword Launcher 013 Version," channeling his blood and energy from his heart and eyes into the launcher.

In an instant, the flying sword launcher resonated with Scholar Song... and then, a targeting sight appeared out of nowhere in his line of vision.

That targeting sight was all too familiar.

Players who had played CS or Crossfire would recognize it immediately; it was the kind of reticle seen in those games. Scholar Song merely had to aim this targeting sight at the cultivator controlling the gourd in midair—lock complete!

Venerable White... what on earth have you been exposed to since you came out of seclusion and got your hands on a computer?

Just then, the Half-Gourd Daoist suddenly felt a wave of foreboding—a sensation emanating from the first-grade brat who was about to be sucked into the gourd!

“Absorb, absorb, absorb!” The Half-Gourd Daoist immediately increased the output of his true essence, frantically activating his wine-red gourd!

As a rogue cultivator, his sixth sense was extremely keen. Though he didn’t know why this little brat made him feel such dread, he knew he had to get the brat into the gourd!

“Fire!” Scholar Song pressed down hard on the button of the "Flying Sword Launcher 013 Version!"

At the same time, he condensed his spiritual energy onto the tattoo on his wrist, ready to flee at the first sign of trouble!

**Whoosh!** The One-time Flying Sword 004 Version shot out.

If the black flying sword Master Jing Mo had used earlier was akin to a supercar, then the sword that shot from Scholar Song’s hand now was equivalent to a supersonic jet!

The sword light flashed!

The Half-Gourd Daoist’s eyes widened; he saw a thin beam of light shooting towards him.

He wanted to dodge, but no matter how he adjusted his body, he could not escape the lock of that beam of light.

In a moment of desperation, he abandoned the 'absorption of Scholar Song into the gourd' and raised the gourd to shield himself.

However, before he could even move the gourd, that slender beam of light had already pierced into his body—so fast it was unreal!

**One sword through the heart!**

At the same time, the sword's intent exploded, directly severing the Half-Gourd Daoist's life.

The Half-Gourd Daoist could only look on in disbelief as his head drooped, and he breathed his last.

The One-time Flying Sword 004 Version pierced through the Half-Gourd Daoist but did not stop its flight; it continued to impale the Half-Gourd Daoist's corpse and shot into the sky.

It flew and flew until it eventually disappeared from sight.

If all went as planned, the Half-Gourd Daoist's body would be sent deep into the cosmos. After all, Venerable White had developed the "One-time Flying Sword 004 Version" specifically for 'destroying bodies and erasing evidence.'

It was a pity; his gourd was still a fine treasure. This gourd clearly wasn’t forged by the Half-Gourd Daoist; it must have been a treasure he obtained from some ancient ruins.

Who knows what opportunities this gourd will encounter once it enters the universe? Will it be smashed to bits by a meteor shower? Or will it melt in a star? Or perhaps it will wait in the cosmos for a fateful encounter?

As the attraction from the gourd dissipated, Scholar Song began to plummet from the sky.

He fell to the ground, wincing in pain.

“Half-Gourd!” Master Jing Mo roared, unable to believe that in the blink of an eye, his only friend, the Half-Gourd Daoist, was dead!

Killed by this first-grade brat right before his eyes!

“Woof.” Dou Dou’s avatar slipped free from the sword lights, a hint of mockery at the corner of its mouth.

Scholar Song was no easy prey!

“Damn it, damn it! You dare kill Half-Gourd, my only friend!” Master Jing Mo howled in grief and fury.

Without hesitation, Scholar Song gave him the middle finger and blurted out: “Your only friend? You really failed as a human being.”

“Ahhhh!” Master Jing Mo lunged at Scholar Song furiously: “Brat, I’ll tear you apart!”

The Blood God Drill, turns out to be from the Wuji Demon Sect?

“Dou Dou, block him!” Scholar Song shouted.

“Woof!” Dou Dou's avatar let out a roar, utilizing its incredible speed to position itself in front of Master Jing Mo, continuing the battle.

With one hand holding the treasured blade 'Bash Shatter' and the other clutching a protective talisman, Scholar Song felt a surge of confidence.

Dou Dou was indeed dependable at critical moments!

While the elders in the group regarded Dou Dou as a nuisance, Scholar Song felt that although Dou Dou was sometimes troublesome, it often provided him with tremendous help!

“Go, Dou Dou!” Scholar Song quietly held his last sword talisman, preparing to strike at Master Jing Mo in the sky at the crucial moment!

“Woof!” Dou Dou’s avatar barked, its fighting spirit ignited!

It and Master Jing Mo fought fiercely, their battle intensifying as they exchanged nearly a hundred moves. Then, they broke apart, temporarily facing off.

At that moment, Dou Dou’s avatar suddenly turned its head, offering Scholar Song a dry grin.

That grin looked a little awkward.

“What’s up?” Scholar Song wondered.

“I think I’m out of energy.” Dou Dou’s avatar apologized with a smile.

**Boom!** Its body transformed into a cloud of smoke, shrinking into a tuft of dog fur that slowly floated down from the air.

“……” Scholar Song.

I was wrong; at the critical moment, Dou Dou was still as unreliable as ever!

“Jie jie jie, this time, let’s see who can save you!” Master Jing Mo cackled in the sky, his eyes flashing with lightning, clearly entering a state of rage.

With a swish, he slashed the black sword a few times, shredding Dou Dou's energy-depleted fur to pieces.

Simultaneously, the black sword was raised, flying toward Scholar Song with a murderous intent!

In the blink of an eye, the flying sword was already slashing toward Scholar Song.

Looks like it’s all up to me now? I must block this sword and then immediately use the 'Ten Thousand Miles Escape Technique' to flee for my life.
