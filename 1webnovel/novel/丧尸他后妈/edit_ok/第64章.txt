Z noticed the complex expression on Sophia's face and paused, asking gently, "Should I head back then?"

"No need," Sophia sighed, settling back into her wheelchair. She rubbed her forehead, pondering, "What do we do now? Should we leave?"

Z glanced at the unconscious figure of Walter, his voice low. "Do you mind if I deal with him?"

Sophia was silent for a moment before replying, "Are you really asking for my opinion?"

"Of course."

"Do you want the honest truth?"

"You can say whatever you want," he replied with a polite nod.

Sophia's expression remained neutral. "Are you going to do it, or should I?"

Z raised an eyebrow, seemingly at a loss for words. But Sophia interrupted, saying, "There’s no turning back now that we’ve come this far. Regret will only kill the person I was yesterday, and I only want to live for tomorrow."

Z listened quietly, not saying much. He knelt beside Walter, searching his own pockets. His long fingers brushed over his waist and chest. He looked up with a hint of exasperation. "Ah, they took everything from me."

"Then I guess it’s my turn," Sophia bit her lip, looking at Walter. Although Walter was a threat, she found it hard to take action. After all, he was still her father, and she didn't want to handle it herself.

Z watched as Sophia moved her wheelchair closer, ready to act. He frowned and stopped her, saying, "He doesn't need to die right now. I'll handle it later." He stood and walked behind her, turning the wheelchair towards the door. "For now, we need to get out of here."

"Later?" Sophia asked, surprised. "You want to let a tiger back into the wild?"

Z scoffed, curling his lip. "You really think he can keep me trapped?"

"Isn’t the answer obvious? Even if you managed to trap him, it wouldn’t hold."

"Fine, I’ll explain just this once," Z said, pressing an invisible button on the wall. "I need him alive. I need them all alive, so they truly understand the consequences of their actions."

His heart had been a wasteland, but Sophia had built a wall in his heart, and now that wall was on the verge of crumbling. Those behind it could be crushed at any moment. In principle, Sophia should want to save the world, but...

"Your injury hasn’t healed yet. Let’s find somewhere to take care of it." After saying this, Z pressed the elevator button, sending them both down. As the elevator doors slowly closed, he smirked, a dark aura flickering across his face, his eyes hidden behind thin glasses holding a chilling depth.

Sophia nodded seriously. Yes, she did want to save the world, but the doctor said her injury wasn't healed, so she had to take care of herself first.

Just as the elevator doors were about to close, Charlie’s figure suddenly appeared outside, staring in shock at the two departing figures, his face painted with disbelief. Z sneered, "Go back and get stronger before you come looking for me."

He was way too straightforward; it was hard to even know how to retort.

"Do you think I’m being ruthless? I could have taken you away earlier, but I waited until you woke up to do it, right in front of you." In the enclosed elevator, Z's voice felt somewhat stifled, with a hint of a chilling tone that sent shivers down one's spine.

Sophia thought for a moment, and it did seem to be the case. But she still wanted to think positively of him. "You must have been worried about delaying my recovery, right?"

Z’s mouth twitched, and three dark lines seemed to appear on his forehead. He replied coldly, “You’re overthinking it.”

"Where are we going?" Sophia wisely changed the subject.

When the elevator reached its destination, Z effortlessly picked Sophia up and said with a soft grunt, "Nowhere. We’re staying right here."

Sophia looked around, and what greeted her was a fully equipped laboratory deep underground, almost blinding her. "When did you set this up? Charlie watched you leave; are you sure they can’t come down?"

Z carried her to a bed and began unbuckling her clothes. Sophia felt her cheeks flush as she looked at his face so close to hers. She reached up to brush his bangs aside, staring at his smooth forehead. His long lashes fluttered like tiny fans, blinking rapidly as if he were about to lie.

"Just finished setting it up."

Just as she suspected, it was a lie, and a vague one at that.

"If you don’t want to talk about it, I won’t ask," she said, reaching out to touch his forehead, causing his hands to pause mid-button as he stiffly fell silent for a moment before saying seriously, "Don’t move. I need to check your injury."

"Okay." Sophia stuck out her tongue, obediently lowering her hands, as if she had seen him… relax?

What was going on? This guy used to be all over the place, and now he seemed so restrained?

With this confusion in mind, Sophia watched as he changed her bandages. He focused entirely on his task, his demeanor extremely restrained, a stark contrast to the guy who used to feel uncomfortable if he didn’t take advantage of a situation.

Sophia had an ominous premonition. This time, she was cautious and didn’t ask outright. Instead, she subtly probed, "Weren’t you the one who said you wouldn’t care for me anymore? Why did you come back?"

Z paused while tossing aside a bandage, quickly regaining his composure. He didn’t answer.

She pressed on, "What have you been doing these past few days? I haven’t seen you."

Z turned to her, his expression flat. "Waiting for you to ask."

It seemed like he had said a lot, but in reality, he hadn’t said anything at all. Now, that was the art of conversation—a master at work.

"Idiot," Z suddenly muttered awkwardly, reaching out to ruffle her hair. He spoke in a low tone, "I don’t care about everyone."

Sophia looked up at him, his figure deeply etched in her mind. She tilted her head and said lightly, "Your wrist seems to have healed. Have I been unconscious for a long time?"

Z stared at her in surprise, seemingly not expecting her to remember that.

"Actually, I’m really tired now, but I don’t want to rest. I’m afraid that when I wake up again, you won’t be here." Sophia sighed, "My intuition has always been spot on. I know you’re hiding something from me again. Don’t you understand? Even if I’m standing on the edge of a cliff, I hope the one to push me off is you."

Z coughed lightly, quickly changing the subject. "You were unconscious for seven days. Not too long, just long enough for your wounds to scab over."

Sophia smiled wryly. "Right, you calculated the medication perfectly—made me sleep through the healing process, no pain whatsoever."

"Why didn’t humans evolve with a tail? Then I could know if you’re really okay or just pretending," Sophia fiddled with her fingers. "Sorry, I might be talking too much. If you have things to do, go ahead and handle them. I’ll behave and lie here." With that, she turned on her side, curling up like a shrimp, her eyes lightly closed, her lashes trembling.

There were other cruel people besides him, and while she could protect herself, the only one who truly cared for her wholeheartedly was him. For this person, Sophia chose to give in. If her feelings became a burden to him, that would be her greatest fear and regret. She had nothing left to lose in this world.

With her eyes shut, darkness enveloped her. She didn’t know what expression or actions Z was making; she could only tell that he hadn’t left, as there were no footsteps.

She felt uneasy, stubbornly hoping he would leave, yet deep down, she didn’t want him to go. She began to understand Z's feelings when she insisted on leaving. She hoped it wasn’t just her wishful thinking.

After a while, which didn’t feel long, Z gently sat beside Sophia. He brushed his fingers over her brow, his fingertip touching her eyelid as he gently opened her eyes, saying softly, "Do you understand what it feels like to never have an opponent and suddenly be taken down?"

Sophia obediently opened her eyes, staring blankly at him. "You haven’t been taken down."

"I have." Z pressed his lips together, "Your injury is my greatest failure. It’s not that I can’t get up; it’s that seeing you with your eyes closed makes me unsure of what to do next. No amount of good deeds can clear my name; one misstep and it’s a permanent mistake. The darkness of the past cannot be erased. Doing right or wrong will both have their consequences." He shifted his gaze away. "So I think maybe keeping you by my side is a mistake. Once I resolve everything, you can pursue your own life."

Sophia opened her mouth to refute him, but he raised his hand to stop her. "Don’t rush to reject me. I’m not thinking of anything else; this is my plan. You’ve given me a lot more than I ever expected, and I should learn to be content."

He seemed to breathe a sigh of relief as he smiled, turning his gaze back to meet hers, his eyes seamlessly connecting with hers. "You can rest assured and leave. You will meet someone more suitable for you. Don’t worry about me; I’ll be fine. A despicable and shameless person like me isn’t fit to stay by your side."

Here we go again! Every time there’s a problem, he wants her to leave! What does he think she is? A mindless fool who can be cast aside at will?

Sophia couldn’t care less about her sore legs. She sat up and glared at him, asking, "Why are you afraid of what others might say about you? Isn’t it normal to try to get what you like? Why belittle yourself? I’ve always cared about you; I don’t care how others see me. I won’t leave, even if my legs are shaking right now."

Taking a breath, she continued, "Besides, isn’t it usually the woman who leaves home during a fight? Why are you the one who keeps leaving? Are you bullying me because you know I’m soft-hearted?" The more she thought about it, the angrier she became. She wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling him closer as she lay back on the bed, glaring at Z, who was pinned on top of her. "Why should me liking you mean I have to compromise? I see it clearly now; being with you means I need to seize every moment. Otherwise, we might not see each other again the next second. Right now, I want to sleep with you. Can you feel that?"

Her hand slid down to explore his waist, but he swiftly caught her strong hand, causing her to frown as she looked at him seriously.

Z looked uncomfortable, a look of unprecedented weakness and repression crossing his face. He straightened up and moved away from the bed, backing away three meters before turning his back to her. "You can’t do those things right now. Just rest."

"I’m fine!" Sophia had no intention of backing down. If he wanted to avoid her, she would pursue him. If she didn’t manage to catch up this time, she didn't know when he would return or if he would at all.

With that in mind, Sophia braced herself and swung her legs off the bed. After a moment of recovery, her legs felt much better. Was the anesthetic wearing off? No matter; love is love, and this was a good sign.

"You…" Z seemed to want to say something, but Sophia wasn’t listening. She stood up, swaying a bit, and he instinctively stepped forward to support her. Seizing the opportunity, she wrapped herself around him, kissing him fiercely and tearing off his tie.

"I don’t know how to make you stay, but please don’t feel bad, and whatever you do, don’t leave." Sophia buried her head into his shoulder, her body pressed against his as she was lifted off the ground. "We can’t be apart anymore."

Z’s arms around her tightened gradually. She could sense his wavering resolve. She was fully prepared; if this didn’t convince him, then she would simply seduce him.

But what Sophia didn’t expect was that Z would ask her such a question.

"What if I’m about to die?" 

A particularly cruel reality loomed over them, one where one of them might not live much longer while the other faced eternal loneliness.
