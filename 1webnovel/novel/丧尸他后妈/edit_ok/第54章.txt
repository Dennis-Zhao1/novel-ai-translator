Yining stared in shock at Jack and Gary as they hurriedly left the path. "I never thought they would act like this," she murmured, "Is this how friends should treat each other?"

Sophia Smith looked at her with a cold expression. "That's because they never really saw you as a friend, and neither did you."

Yining's eyes filled with tears as she glared at Sophia. "Why? What makes you think you deserve all this?"

Indeed, all of this should have belonged to you. If it weren't for Bob switching lives and gaining the upper hand with an advantage like Ethan... But what's done is done—what use is there in dwelling on it now?

Sophia ignored her, her mind focused on the pressing issue concerning John Anderson. After all, he had once worked in the same lab as Ethan and had tampered with the device implanted in Ethan's body. She couldn't overlook that.

At this moment, John Anderson had already pieced everything together. His intelligence was beyond question, so he didn't need Ethan to spell it out—he knew he was doomed today.

Sometimes, people would rather self-destruct than let you have peace.

John's expression suddenly turned grim. He whispered something to Yining, whose face went pale with fear, shaking her head in desperate refusal.

He patted her hand, not saying more, but his eyes conveyed his determination. Yining hesitated for a moment before turning and running away in a direction different from where Jack and Gary had gone; her choice was distinctly her own.

To buy Yining some time, John stepped closer to Ethan. "I've already borrowed enough time just by being alive today." A wicked smile crept onto his face. "Since hope is lost for me, living has no meaning."

He moved closer to Ethan, who showed no signs of retreat, calmly awaiting him. In Ethan's eyes, eliminating John was the top priority at the moment.

"I know you've always wanted to get rid of me. My existence is a stain on your record; you can't stand that one of your subordinates slipped through your fingers and still poses a threat," John mocked, with a bitter smile. "Though you don't say it, I know you're afraid. You're a freak, Ethan."

He laughed—was it laughter or tears? "You want to see me in despair and pain, regretting why I fled; you want me to understand that only death can set me free."

Ethan listened quietly, nodding. "You're smart; that's the only thing about you I somewhat respect. But your intelligence has its limits." He glanced at his watch. "It's almost time; I still have to help Deputy Governor Smith with something, so goodbye."

"No!" John shouted before Ethan could make a move, as if he had lost all his strength. He could barely stand, his throat constricted; something was moving inside—it was likely the device.

His voice was distorted, "Do you really think I can't hurt you? You're too arrogant, Ethan."

With a strange laugh, John collapsed to the ground. "The source of my suffering is you, and the source of your suffering will also be me. I've long guessed that with your skills, you'd be able to extract the device, so…" He opened his mouth wide, blood trickling between his teeth. "Just wait; I will make you taste my pain today. One day, you will have to leave your loved ones behind, watching them die in front of you, or… you’ll have to choose between them and your own survival."

He shifted his gaze to the utterly shocked Sophia Smith, implying, "Even if I die, as long as you're alive for a second, I will make sure you won't have it easy."

These were likely John's last words. After uttering the final sound, he fell to the ground, lifeless.

His throat ruptured, something leaped out, bouncing a few times before settling at Ethan's feet.

Ethan kicked the bloody device aside with his shoe and turned to look in the direction of Sophia and Charlie. "How's the show?"

Charlie seemed indifferent to his question, turning away coldly, not uttering a word.

Sophia opened her mouth but couldn’t produce any sound; the previous scene had been too shocking. Only someone with Ethan’s psychological endurance could remain so calm...

Ethan said nothing further. He took a few steps forward, seemingly wanting to return to Sophia, but he stopped halfway, his brows furrowed tightly, a faint red glow blossoming in his dark eyes.

"Even if I die, as long as you're alive for a second, I will make sure you won't have it easy."

John's dying words echoed in his ears. Ethan took a deep breath, striving to calm his wildly racing heart. But no matter what he did, it was futile; he felt as if his heart was about to explode, racing at an unbelievable speed, something dangerous was about to break free from within him.

Ethan stepped back, looking at Sophia with an expression of regret. He retreated at least ten meters before sighing.

At this moment, he felt awkward, more embarrassed than he had ever felt in his life. He realized that his physical condition had deteriorated to the point where he could no longer remain here. He couldn’t resolve this problem in a short time; staying here might lead him to inadvertently harm Sophia. If that happened, it would be truly irreparable. But...

Even so, he still wanted to stay, even if it meant hiding like a rat in a filthy gutter, peering through rusty pipes to watch her. He didn’t want to leave.

"Charlie." Ethan suddenly spoke, casting a quick glance at Sophia. "Take her away to a safe place. I will ensure your sister is returned to you unharmed, otherwise, you'll only be able to remember her with sorrow."

Charlie was taken aback, frowning. "What do you mean by that?"

Ethan ignored him and swiftly told Sophia, who had sensed something was wrong, "Don't come looking for me." He turned away, the wind lifting the corner of his coat, and his figure rapidly disappeared into the dense foliage.

Sophia wanted to chase after him, but the silver robot that had been standing still suddenly moved, blocking her path and saying, "Please follow the gentleman's orders, ma'am."

“…” Sophia didn’t know how to describe her feelings at this moment. In short, she was incredibly… incredibly displeased!

"Get out of my way!" Sophia angrily sidestepped the robot's obstruction and dashed into the woods. Not far ahead, there seemed to be sounds of fighting. She quickened her pace, finally arriving just in time to witness a scene that was utterly incomprehensible.

Ethan, Gary, and Jack stood in a circle together. Gary was very close to Ethan, who looked in terrible shape—his eyes were bloodshot, and he held his gun tightly. Jack had already been shot, half-collapsed on the ground, gasping heavily.

"Sophia?!" Jack exclaimed as if seeing a savior. "Quick, get this lunatic away!"

Charlie had no choice but to follow Sophia after Ethan's earlier remark. Now, seeing that Sophia actually intended to approach Ethan, who was clearly not himself, he couldn't help but pull her back: "Take a good look at him; he’s not right. If you go up now, you’ll probably get caught in the crossfire."

Gary was struggling to confront Ethan. If he hadn’t seized the opportunity to grip Ethan’s wrist, they might have already been killed. Although he had only held Ethan for less than a minute, he was already reaching his limit.

Ethan’s hands were perfect for playing the piano, yet he could easily end all their lives.

Sophia felt like crying; seeing Ethan in such a state hurt her deeply. She bit her lip and pushed Charlie away. "I know what I’m doing; don’t interfere." Ignoring the obstruction, she stepped forward and said to Gary, "Just hold him for one minute."

Gary looked at her in confusion, but she didn’t respond. She quickly approached to grab the gun from Ethan, then concentrated, striking the back of his neck with her hand, deliberately using her special ability. Ethan’s eyes flashed; he closed his eyes and ceased resisting.

Sophia quickly pulled him into her arms, stepping back to create distance from everyone, holding the gun coldly at them: "Leave alive, or die here. It’s your choice."

Gary stared at her in shock, seemingly struggling to accept such a rapid change. After pondering for a while, he glanced at her with a complicated expression before leaving on his own.

Charlie frowned, "I won’t harm you, but I need to wait for him to wake up. I have to clarify my sister’s situation before leaving."

Sophia shot him a sidelong glance, dismissing him, then turned to Jack: "And you?"

Jack looked thoughtfully at Ethan before suddenly laughing. "Sophia, do you think I’m your father for no reason?"

Sophia was somewhat puzzled, but the next second she understood his meaning. A large number of quantum soldiers ambushed from all sides, and she had no time to think; she quickly fired her gun, taking down the attackers one by one, her hands almost going numb from pulling the trigger.

"How many bullets do you have left?" Jack clutched his shoulder wound, sneering, "Do you think you can hold off so many of us?"

Sophia looked at him in confusion: "Are you really a father?"

Jack paused, not yet reacting, when he saw Sophia directly discard her empty gun and single-handedly hold Ethan, taking down all the quantum soldiers trying to capture them in a way that was shockingly unfathomable. Thanks to Ethan, her powers were incredibly effective—swift, lethal, and invisible.

Jack quickly made a judgment, shouting, "Leave no survivors, just kill them all!" After all, once they were dead, he could seal the laboratory and get what he wanted. As long as Ethan died, it would be enough...

Unfortunately, Ethan was fated not to die. Although Jack ordered to leave no survivors, it was already too late. His greed had cost him the best opportunity for victory. The silver robot developed by Ethan arrived effortlessly, wiping out the disorganized crowd and carrying Ethan and Sophia into the cockpit, transforming into an aircraft that swiftly took them into the sky, leaving the area behind.

Jack hid in the grass, staring blankly at the flying machine, his expression heavy with both concern and desire.

If that thing obeyed him...
