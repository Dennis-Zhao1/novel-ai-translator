**Chapter 46**

Anticipation and fear intertwined as Ethan prepared to extend his invitation to Ivy. His calm exterior belied the turmoil within, his deep blue eyes narrowing with a mix of vulnerability and determination. In the dim light, his voice, rich and resonant, broke the silence, “Are you hesitating?”

Without waiting for an answer, Ethan gently took Ivy’s hand, pulling her closer. “I’m not really asking for your opinion here. I’m just stating how I feel. I like you. That’s all. I want you to be with me.”

Ivy’s frustration flared, recognizing Ethan’s unyielding nature. Her voice, initially soft, grew firm, “You’re fooling even me. What a waste of my kindness towards you!”

Ethan, seemingly unfazed, turned his attention to the chaotic scene around them. Nearby, a group of people, led by Tom, scrambled to avoid the encroaching danger, resembling a troupe of clowns in a dark comedy. Ivy couldn’t hold back a retort, “Did you not hear what I just said? Can you at least react a little?”

Ethan shrugged, his demeanor relaxed, “You can say whatever you want; what I choose to listen to is my business.” With a fluid motion, he pulled out his phone, glancing at a message with casual ease.

Bang—A loud noise echoed, startling everyone. In the confusion, Ivy noticed one of their allies, Lily, had been injured while trying to protect her friend. The sight of Lily’s pained expression and the spreading red stain on her shirt shook Ivy to her core.

“Troublemaker,” Ethan muttered, glancing back at Ivy, his tone laced with underlying meaning, “Did you see that? If you don’t behave, you’ll end up like this.”

Ivy was stunned into silence, processing the weight of his words before finally responding, “Enough already. Do you really find it amusing to threaten me like that?”

Ethan raised an eyebrow, his gaze heavy on her, pulling her along as they moved forward. The chaos in the banquet hall escalated, and Tom’s group was cornered, their resources dwindling.

Ethan led Ivy to a quieter spot, away from the turmoil. From high above, the scene below looked like a chaotic mess. “Winners flaunt their power, losers end up in a pool of blood. Do you feel it?” Ethan leaned close to Ivy, his voice carrying a cruel edge.

Ivy rolled her eyes at him. Truthfully, watching those people struggle didn’t bother her much. Maybe it was because she had been with Ethan for too long, but ever since Tom had insulted her, she had felt completely indifferent.

Ethan chuckled softly, testing a microphone he had found. “Hello everyone,” he announced, his voice carrying over the crowd, heightening the tension in the room.

In the midst of the chaos, Tom shouted, “Ethan! Where have you taken our soldiers?”

“Oh? You still have the energy to care about others at a time like this?” Ethan feigned a thoughtful smile, “I’m a merciful person. Those who should have died are still alive.” He pressed a button, revealing a group of trapped allies.

Seeing this, Ivy’s heart sank. This was originally an ambush for their allies, but Ethan had replaced them with something far more sinister.

“They are now under my control,” Ethan declared, a cruel smirk on his lips.

Tom’s team had run out of options, and Lily, exhausted, clung to hope as she hesitated over a decision.

“If you have a last weapon, you’d better use it soon,” Ethan casually remarked, glancing at Ivy, who seemed lost in thought. Suddenly, he turned off the microphone, “What do you think? They’re almost at my mercy.”

Ivy shot him a sardonic look. “You didn’t ask for my opinion before doing all this, so why should I share my thoughts now?”

“I already know your answer without asking, so I don’t need your input.”

“You think you know me well, huh?”

Leaning casually against the wall, he responded calmly, “Well, sort of.”

Ivy’s expression turned cold. “You say you know me, but you’re not me.” A smile tugged at her lips. “I can accept a lot of things, but you need to tell me about them first!”

Her words took Ethan by surprise, but seeing her fierce demeanor only irritated him more. Something violent inside him screamed for action—impulses filled with malice.

At that moment, a loud explosion echoed from below the stage. Someone had blown open a hole, and two figures rushed in, pulling the trapped people from the banquet hall.

“Trying to play the hero?” Ethan muttered, raising a tool in defense, intent on stopping them. But Ivy intervened, grabbing his arm with unexpected strength.

“You really need to work on your aim,” Ivy remarked, shooting Ethan a look that was both challenging and determined.

Ethan smirked, lowering his hand. “For what?”

“To end this,” Ivy pointed at the chaos below. The remaining people needed help, and she intended to give it. Even if it meant standing up to Ethan.

Ethan watched her, a mix of admiration and frustration flickering in his eyes. “You’re something else, you know that?”

“Then you stay here. I’m going down.” Ivy’s voice was firm, her resolve unwavering.

“You want to leave?”

“Yes. Keep your distance from me.” Ivy deliberately tried to scare him, “I never want to see you again. You deceived me!” This man was truly detestable, and she couldn’t forgive him so easily; otherwise, he’d only become more relentless.

“Tsk, you want to escape too?” Ethan stepped closer, his expression oddly intense as he stared at her.

Ivy retreated slightly in the narrow space. “I told you to keep your distance. Didn’t you hear me?”

“I did.” Ethan closed the gap, loosening his tie.

An ominous premonition washed over Ivy. “Why are you getting so close...?”

“Not sure what you’re thinking.” Ethan removed his tie, unbuttoning his shirt. Suddenly, he grabbed her wrists, loosely tying them with the tie.

“I always feel like when I’m standing next to you, it’s the farthest away I can be.” He chuckled coldly.

“What are you planning?” Ivy was startled by his sudden aggression, her ears turning red with embarrassment. “I was just joking earlier. You wouldn’t take it seriously, would you?”

“Funny how now it feels like you’re the one joking with me.” Ethan didn’t believe her, but surprisingly, this time she was speaking the truth.

Ivy regretted her words immensely. Had she known, she would have just compromised rather than complicate things.

“Let me go first. I really...” Before Ivy could finish her sentence, Ethan effortlessly lifted her and placed her safely on the ground. The height of the platform was just right, and she found herself in a more secure position.

“Don’t panic. I’ll make you comfortable.” Ethan smirked, adjusting his stance.

……

Ivy was well aware of the flirtations between them, and at that moment, she immediately understood what he intended.

A challenge? What the hell! Was he planning to test her limits?

“I was just joking, Ethan. Please don’t do this. I’ll apologize, okay? Just let me down...” Ivy weakly tried to appease him, wishing to avoid facing him in such a humiliating position.

Ethan gripped her chin with a manic smile, “No.” His voice dropped to a soft tone, “Does apologizing even work? Even if you kneeled before me and begged for forgiveness, I would still feel hurt. I’ve been so good to you, and you just said you wanted to leave me.” He patted her cheek, “But I’ve decided to forgive you. It’s just that no matter what, my heart can never be as it was before you came into my life. I’m giving you a chance to repent.”

Ivy felt frustrated. It was clearly him who had deceived her first yet made her feel like she was the one at fault. How was it that all the blame seemed to lie with her? This world had become a twisted place, and she wasn’t naive enough to cling to any notions of justice. Whether it was due to love or desperation, he was the only one she could trust in this chaos, her salvation, her lighthouse. For her survival and hopes, she couldn’t betray her own heart and leave him.

But……

“Enough! I can endure you cursing me or even hitting me, but this is too much! Even a bun has its temper! A rabbit will bite when cornered! Keep this up, and do you think I won’t cry in front of you?” Ivy finally snapped, her eyes welling up.

Ethan pulled his shirt from his pants and removed his coat, revealing a cruel smile. “You really can’t take a scare.” He spoke softly, “I’m the type who takes advantage of every inch. You’ve thought too highly of me, and that has led to your disgust after seeing the real me. But I won’t bear the nauseating feelings that arise from your negligence.” He lowered the rope slightly, causing Ivy’s face to align with his, gently stroking her head, whispering, “How about this? Let’s not separate anymore. Besides that protection, I don’t want anything else.”

Ivy looked up in astonishment. “Really?”

“Hahahaha.” He burst into laughter suddenly, then quickly returned to a blank expression. “How could that be? Of course, I’m just kidding.”

**Chapter 47**

Ethan loosened his stance, the tension between them easing. Ivy stared at him, bewildered by the abrupt change in his demeanor.

“Why do you always have to make things so complicated?” Ivy asked, a mix of exasperation and concern in her voice.

Ethan shrugged, his eyes softening. “I guess it’s just my way of keeping things interesting.”

Ivy rolled her eyes, her frustration giving way to a reluctant smile. “You’re unbelievable, you know that?”

Ethan smirked, his usual confidence returning. “I try.”

Despite the chaos around them, Ivy found herself oddly comforted by Ethan’s presence. It was a strange feeling, realizing that amidst the madness, he was the one constant she could rely on.

“Let’s get out of here,” Ethan suggested, offering his hand.

Ivy hesitated for a moment, her thoughts a whirlwind of conflicting emotions. But ultimately, she knew she couldn’t deny the truth any longer.

Taking his hand, she nodded. “Yeah, let’s go.”

Together, they navigated through the chaos, their intertwined hands a silent promise of the journey ahead.

**Chapter 48**

The aftermath of the chaos left Ivy and Ethan with a sense of uneasy calm. They had managed to escape the immediate danger, but the world outside was still a volatile and unpredictable place.

As they settled into their temporary safe haven, Ivy found herself reflecting on the whirlwind of events that had brought them to this point.

“You really scared me back there,” Ivy admitted, her voice tinged with vulnerability.

Ethan glanced at her, his expression softening. “I didn’t mean to. I just… I wanted to protect you in my own way.”

Ivy sighed, leaning back against the wall. “You have a funny way of showing it.”

Ethan chuckled, a hint of self-deprecation in his tone. “Yeah, I guess I do.”

Despite the tension between them, there was an undeniable connection—a bond forged in the fires of adversity.

“What’s next for us?” Ivy asked, her gaze meeting Ethan’s.

He shrugged, a thoughtful look in his eyes. “I guess we keep moving forward. Together.”

Ivy smiled, feeling a spark of hope amidst the uncertainty. “Together sounds good to me.”

In that moment, they both understood that whatever challenges lay ahead, they would face them as a team.

**Chapter 49**

The following days were a blur of planning and preparation as Ivy and Ethan worked together to carve out a semblance of stability in a world teetering on the brink of chaos.

Their bond grew stronger with each passing day, the initial uncertainty giving way to a deep sense of trust and understanding.

“You know, I never imagined I’d end up here,” Ivy mused one evening as they sat together, watching the sunset paint the sky in hues of orange and pink.

Ethan smiled, his gaze fixed on the horizon. “Life has a funny way of surprising us.”

Ivy nodded, leaning her head on his shoulder. “Yeah, it really does.”

In the quiet moments they shared, Ivy found solace and strength—a reminder that even in the darkest times, there was always a glimmer of light.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm glow over the world, Ivy knew that whatever lay ahead, she and Ethan would face it together.

And for the first time in a long time, she felt hopeful about the future.
