"What's wrong with her?" Sophia Smith asked hesitantly, her worry evident in her voice.

"Just a moment," Ethan replied, crouching down beside Ivy. He pulled out a small bottle of medicine from his jacket pocket, twisted off the cap, and took out two capsules. Gently, he helped Ivy take the medication, ensuring she swallowed.

Seconds later, Ivy jolted awake, her eyes blinking in confusion, still looking a bit dazed.

"Is she not back to normal yet?" Sophia crouched down next to Ethan, both of them studying Ivy with concern.

Ethan, with a glint of confidence in his eye, said, "Trust me, I know what I'm doing."

Sophia thought to herself with a hint of skepticism, "I agree with the first part, but I'm not so sure about the second."

Under Sophia’s doubtful gaze, Ethan demonstrated his confidence once more. Just like he had done with Ivy before, he activated his wristwatch again, casting a vivid red light over Ivy. Her pupils constricted under the beam, and Ethan quickly pulled Sophia back, maintaining a sense of calm detachment.

Ivy shifted slightly, looking disoriented. She sat up with a pained expression, clutching her shoulder.

Feeling guilty at the sight, Sophia glanced away.

"You two are here too?" Ivy noticed Ethan and Sophia standing nearby and instantly resumed her usual cheerful demeanor. Even in this unfavorable situation, she didn’t appear flustered; her features sparkled in the daylight.

Sophia couldn’t help but admire her. Truly, as the story’s heroine, Ivy had an effortlessly stunning appearance. Those eyes seemed to look right into you, brimming with unspoken affection. Whoever was caught in that gaze would easily find themselves drawn in—only someone of Ethan’s caliber could withstand such charm.

Sophia instinctively glanced at Ethan, who was casually brushing off Ivy's questions, giving her a few quick replies before leading her back to their vehicle, ready to continue their journey.

They still had a day's drive to reach the atomic base. If they started now, they could reach a town before nightfall, gather some supplies, and rest before setting off again at dawn.

Sophia was preoccupied with her thoughts, and the ride fell into a quiet lull. Ethan, aware she might be hungry, had set aside some food for her, though they hadn’t packed enough for the long journey they faced.

Sophia felt a headache coming on, frustrated with her own inability to address her awkwardness directly. She had been wrestling with her thoughts throughout the ride, while Ethan remained focused on driving. He noticed her discomfort but didn’t worry too much, reassured by the fact that as long as it wasn’t his fault, he could solve any problem.

As they drove, Sophia’s fatigue overtook her, and she gradually drifted off to sleep, her head tilting toward the window. Every now and then, her forehead bumped against the glass, causing Ethan to be momentarily distracted. With a sigh, he set the navigation device, gently pulled her into his arms, and used one hand to steer while awkwardly connecting the navigation cables, activating the autopilot feature.

Ethan had always avoided using this feature in front of her, fearing that if she ever attempted to leave, it would give her an unfair advantage. It was easy for a directionally challenged person to get lost, but once she knew of this function, escaping would be more difficult. Moreover, he suspected her already wavering heart would become even more restless. Therefore, he was determined not to reveal it.

As dusk fell, they arrived at a town less than a hundred miles from the molecular base. Ethan parked the vehicle, deactivating the autopilot mode. The slight movement startled Sophia awake from her near-sleep.

"Did I wake you?" Ethan asked, glancing at her while holding onto the navigation device.

Sophia remained nestled against him, her eyes quietly studying his calm demeanor as he seemed unbothered by her presence, almost enjoying it.

"You have serious dark circles under your eyes; you should rest well tonight," she finally managed to say, reluctantly pulling away as she opened the car door.

Ethan watched her retreating figure, his brows knitting together in thought. Suddenly, his eyes lit up with realization.

Stepping out of the car, Sophia spotted Ivy and the others walking towards her. James Carter was in the lead, flashing a smile and nodding at her. "Miss Smith."

"Please just call me Sophia," she replied, rubbing her eyes and stifling a yawn.

Noticing Sophia’s groggy demeanor, Ivy felt a wave of jealousy wash over her, recalling her own irritation at being unable to rest due to David's constant nagging. She adjusted her hair, putting on her best face as she approached Ethan, clearly still unwilling to give up on him.

Ethan didn’t even spare her a glance, stating, "We’re about sixty miles from the atomic base. Let’s take a short break; we’ll head out tomorrow morning. You all can do as you wish; Sophia and I will go ahead." He took Sophia's hand and led her away, showing no concern for any potential objections.

Sophia was pulled into an alley, winding through until they arrived at an old two-story building. The interior was dim and appeared somewhat eerie in the fading light. A withered tree stood in the yard, a swing set beside it swaying gently in the breeze, adding to the unsettling atmosphere.

"Please tell me we're not spending the night here..." Sophia pleaded, looking up at Ethan with wide eyes.

"We're resting here tonight," Ethan said bluntly.

"No way?" Sophia grimaced, "It looks really spooky."

"Places that appear dangerous are often the safest. It's like people; those who speak harshly often have softer hearts than they let on, while those who seem gentle may harbor true cruelty beneath their kind facade."

Sophia opened her mouth to respond but found herself speechless, trailing behind him into the dark building.

Inside, it wasn’t nearly as frightening as it appeared from the outside, but it was so dark that she could barely see. After just a few steps, she bumped into someone familiar. She instinctively wrapped her arms around his waist, feeling the narrowness of his waist and the broadness of his shoulders, which made him feel remarkably reliable. Her hands intertwined over his abdomen, and she could faintly sense the toned muscles beneath.

Ethan froze for a moment, his body stiffening before he relaxed, letting her hold him. After a brief hesitation, he asked, "Are you really that scared? We can go back to the car if you want. I spent some time here when I was younger; it’s changed a bit over the past few decades."

"Decades is a long time; of course, it’s changed," Sophia said softly from behind him. "You were quite young then, right? Were you in...?" She hesitated to finish her thought, not wanting to mention the word "lab," knowing it might be a sensitive topic for him.

Ethan didn’t seem as fragile as she feared. He replied candidly, "Yes, but I was underground, just below us."

"Oh," Sophia said, glancing at the wooden floor beneath them. In the stillness of the dark room, she gathered her courage to voice a question that had been plaguing her throughout the journey. "Why are you so good to me?"

“…,” Ethan was momentarily taken aback, caught off guard by her question. He quickly thought of various ways to respond, but each one felt inadequate.

Seeing him silent, Sophia continued, "You really shouldn’t be so nice to me. I’m particularly susceptible to being moved. If I end up liking you, it would be a disaster."

Ethan seized upon her words like a lifeline. Standing tall in the darkness, he wondered what expression she wore as she leaned against him. He slowly replied, "So, you really don’t want to like me?"

"That's not quite it," Sophia exhaled softly, "If I like you, I’ll like you. I won’t overthink the reasons I shouldn't. But... I can’t shake the feeling that liking you will lead to trouble." It seemed disconcerting to have feelings for someone like Ethan, but it appeared it was already too late—she might have already started to like him.

Ethan must have picked up on her unspoken words as he grasped her hands resting on his waist. Her fingers were mischievously toying with the buckle of his belt, causing his throat to tighten as he leaned closer, quickly saying, "Then just go ahead and like me."

Sophia froze, staring at him with wide eyes. "What did you say?"

“Everyone comes into this world alone and empty-handed. As long as the situation isn’t dire enough to cost you your life, it’s not as hard as you think," he replied to her earlier question.

Sophia pondered for a moment, then cautiously asked, "Do you believe in this kind of feeling? I mean, the kind between a man and a woman."

By all accounts, Ethan was precisely the type of person who seemed unlikely to like anyone. You could never imagine him developing feelings for someone; it seemed almost impossible.

Suddenly, Ethan turned to face her. She felt a surge of anxiety as she looked up at his face, but the darkness concealed his expression. She comforted herself, thinking he couldn’t see her either. Little did she know, Ethan's glasses weren’t ordinary, and even without them, his vision was far sharper than that of an average person.

Ethan clarified his stance, "I believe in love. I believe in it regardless of what others think. Otherwise, how would you explain it?" He gestured between them.

"Then..." Sophia started to say something but stumbled over her words. After a moment of hesitation, she boldly asked, "Do you like me?"

Ethan bit his lip slightly. Though his character made him reluctant to express such sentiments, he knew that denying it now would only worsen the situation. So, despite his awkwardness, he replied with a single word, "Yes."

Sophia was momentarily stunned. Although she had long suspected this, she had always chalked it up to her own vanity. Now, hearing it confirmed from his lips, she found herself momentarily speechless.

Indeed, those who seemed least likely to have feelings for anyone would often ignite a passionate fire once touched, vibrant and consuming to the point where nothing else mattered.

"But why me? There are so many girls prettier and better than I am; why do you like me instead?" Sophia murmured, torn between joy and sorrow, not truly expecting an answer to her dramatic question. Yet, to her surprise, Ethan responded.

It was only natural. Since the moment she met him, his every word and action had defied her expectations. Perhaps that was why she felt an increasing curiosity about him, a growing dependence, and a struggle to let go.

In a rather academic tone, he stated, "Because so many girls who are prettier than you simply can’t compare to you. So many girls who are better than you don’t hold a candle to your beauty."

Sophia gazed at him with wide eyes, her lovely irises sparkling in the dim light. Ethan raised his hand, brushing over her brow and cheek, before concluding with words that felt more like persuasion for himself than for her: "Look, your eyes are like springs filled with stars, reflecting only my image, still rippling with beautiful waves."

It was enough to bring her to the verge of tears. Sophia's lips twitched, and she swatted his hand away to wipe her eyes, feigning calmness as she said, "That’s terrible. Once we confirm this, freedom will be lost." Blushing, she stepped outside to catch some fresh air.

Ethan followed her out, smirking as he said, "Sophia Smith, you’re twenty-three this year, and you’re still dreaming of freedom? I can give you wings, but can you fly?" He warned her, "You might as well give up on that thought. I can give you everything, but freedom is off the table." His frustration with the very concept of "freedom" was palpable.

Sophia feigned shock, replying dramatically, "Then I take back what I just said! Let's revert to how things were before we stepped outside!"

Ethan pulled her over to the swing set, forcing her to sit before swiftly pushing her high up into the air. As he listened to her squeals of surprise, a wicked smile spread across his face, and he laughed heartily.

"You’re so terrible! This is pure revenge! You can’t stand even a hint of opposition!"

He caught Sophia as she swung towards him, stopping the swing from moving any further. Wrapping his arms around her neck, he leaned close to her ear and whispered ominously, "I won’t pretend to be understanding or accommodating. Right now, all I want to hear are those five words: 'Be with me.' If you think about it, that seems to be my only strong point. So, what will it be? Speak up."

He paused, as though he feared his tone wasn’t forceful enough, not shocking enough, so he lowered his voice further, almost to a whisper, adding, "Don’t think about tomorrow, and don’t consider forever."
