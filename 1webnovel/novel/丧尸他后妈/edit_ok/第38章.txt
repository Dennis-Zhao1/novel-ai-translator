After Ivy woke up, she noticed Ethan watching her eat. She was intrigued by the impressive spread of food in front of her, wondering how he managed to gather it all. Did he have some kind of magic trick up his sleeve?

"This is...quite the feast," she hesitated, glancing at him. Ethan adjusted his glasses, crossing his legs, and leaned back in his chair, his messy hair falling over his forehead in a way that was both casual and charming. "It's from the local community. What do you think? Not bad, right?"

Ivy nodded thoughtfully, feeling a warm sense of happiness as she began to eat. Ethan sat across from her, watching intently, neither eating nor leaving—an odd situation.

"Aren't you going to eat?" she asked, feeling a bit uncomfortable.

Ethan, slightly exasperated, said, "Do you know what time it is? It's already past noon! You should've finished lunch by now."

Ivy squinted and let out a soft laugh, saying playfully, "Yeah, it's my fault. I had a rough night and couldn't get up. You'll have to forgive me."

Ethan looked momentarily taken aback but maintained his gaze. His face was partly shadowed, his eyes squinting in an almost artistic way, making it hard for Ivy to enjoy her meal. Eventually, she set down her fork, signaling that she was full.

"You need to finish everything," Ethan joked with a mischievous smile. "Not a single bite left behind."

Looking at the massive spread meant for two, Ivy felt troubled. "Shouldn't this be for both of us? Aren't you going to eat? This is too much..."

"Food is especially precious these days. No one should complain about having too much," Ethan replied, turning his head slightly, trying to appear indifferent. "I'm not hungry; you should eat." Yet, after saying that, he awkwardly added, "Please," as if to soften his words.

Ivy stared at him for a moment before obediently lowering her head to eat. Ethan's mouth twitched as he stood up and walked to the corner of the room, grabbing a small bag and starting to fiddle with something inside. By the time Ivy had reluctantly finished all her food, he was already prepared.

"You can now access the monitoring system," Ethan said with a hint of nostalgia. "This place truly is well-equipped. I already tested it; your father is currently in the monitoring room."

Ivy responded with a nonchalant "Oh," without much emotion. "At this time, he should indeed be doing his rounds."

Ethan scrutinized her with a probing gaze, remaining silent. He continued to watch as she connected with a middle-aged man on the computer screen, explaining the current situation somewhat clumsily.

Ivy stumbled through the suspicious points about an individual named Yi Ning, relaying the latest updates on their community. This included that they had obtained a detoxifier to alleviate environmental toxicity, and that Yi Ning had begun to set her sights on the community's resources.

Most importantly, a man named Ouyang was dead, and the other three of his former subordinates seemed utterly loyal to Yi Ning, completely disregarding her as the nominal "young lady." The only explanation for this was that they were actually Yi Ning’s people.

Ethan listened to all of this with a calm demeanor, showing no surprise—whether it was Yi Ning’s identity or the events she described, he either didn’t care or had already known.

Mr. Smith had recovered from his initial shock upon seeing Ivy. He pondered for a moment and nodded gravely. "I understand. When are you coming back?" He sighed, "Dad is very worried about you. It’s been so long since you left without any news."

"I..." Ivy instinctively glanced at Ethan, whose position was out of the camera’s view, meaning Mr. Smith couldn’t see who was with her.

Ethan could clearly see Ivy’s hesitation. He averted his gaze, seemingly unwilling to interfere with her choice.

After a moment of hesitation, Ivy slowly said, "I don’t know yet. I need to finish things here first, probably..."

Mr. Smith frowned, clenching his fist and thinking for a long time. "I’ll come to get you."

"Huh?" Ivy exclaimed in surprise.

At that moment, Mr. Smith’s face, which was quite different from her father's, seemed to overlap with her father’s, and his words made Ivy’s eyes well up with tears. "You are Dad’s only daughter. I’ve already lost your mother; I can’t lose you too."

If Ivy hadn’t been injected with the H+ virus, perhaps Mr. Smith wouldn’t have been so cruel as to abandon her.

After all, she was his daughter—no matter how fierce a tiger can be, it won’t eat its own cub. Although Mr. Smith could sometimes be stubborn, he still had genuine feelings for his daughter.

"No need, Dad. I’ll contact you again. Staying here allows me to keep you updated on the latest developments," Ivy said gently, exhaling slowly.

Mr. Smith seemed to care about this and, covering his mouth, thought for a moment. "That’s fine, but you should have some idea of when you’ll be back."

Ivy didn’t know how to answer, so she bluntly said, "Someone’s coming. Let’s leave it at that for now. I’ll contact you another day. Goodbye."

"When are you coming back?" Mr. Smith pressed anxiously.

Ivy, feeling guilty and sad, softly repeated "goodbye" before quickly shutting off the computer. She turned away, wiping away her tears, unsure whether that "goodbye" was meant for Mr. Smith or for her father, who was far away in another time and space.

In truth, she felt insecure. It was only because Ethan was by her side that she could focus entirely on dealing with him, leaving no time to think about other things. Life in this harsh world was hard; if one hadn’t experienced it firsthand, they wouldn’t understand the feeling of having no one to rely on and nothing to hope for.

If she were alone, trying to escape the doomed fate that bound her, she would probably have to fight for survival after leaving the community. Just thinking about it, if she hadn’t met Ethan… life would have been incredibly tough.

This man, whom others deemed unworthy, was precisely her only support in this challenging world.

"What are you thinking about?" Ethan’s sudden question broke Ivy’s train of thought. She snapped back to reality, realizing she had unknowingly leaned into his embrace. He gently patted her back, and as she rested against him, her eyes focused on the collar of his white shirt. She whispered, "I want to live for a long time, no matter what happens, even if it means living in humiliation without dignity until I have to die."

"Seems like you've always had that thought; it shouldn’t be a result of your conversation with your dad," Ethan commented.

Ivy didn’t respond, instead changing the subject. "Speaking of which, he might come for me at any time. You heard him; he said he’d come to get me. What will we do then?" She stared at him, deliberately saying, "Even if he doesn’t come to get me, I will have to go back someday. What will you do then?"

Without a moment’s hesitation, Ethan replied, "I’ll go with you." He seemed surprised by his own words.

Ivy looked at him for a long time, then smiled broadly, joking, "How should I introduce you to Dad when the time comes? Should I have him call you professor?"

"Professor? Isn’t that kind of formal?" Ethan asked, his awkwardness evident in his stiff response.

Ivy said meaningfully, "Don’t you know that ‘professor’ sounds the same as ‘beast’ in a way?" She traced the word "beast" in his palm with her finger.

Ethan stared at his palm for a long moment before looking up at her seriously. "From now on, just call me Doctor."

He seemed a bit embarrassed about his earlier admission of "going with you," as if trying to reclaim some dignity by adding, "Don’t think I can’t live without you. It’s just that you were the one who proposed the ‘experience’ plan; you have to see it through to the end. One must have a beginning and an end in life."

Ivy nodded repeatedly. "Okay, okay. You can live without me; you’re just afraid of being dumped."

"Don’t be silly. I’ve never been dumped my whole life," Ethan said, standing up and walking toward the door.

Ivy leaned on her hands on the bed, laughing heartily at his retreating figure. "Don’t be silly yourself; this is your first time dating."
