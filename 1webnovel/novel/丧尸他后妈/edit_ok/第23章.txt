Ethan Michaels had been absorbed in the performance when he noticed Ivy Smith and immediately brightened up, exclaiming, "Ivy! What a pleasant surprise!"

Ivy paused for a second, "Ethan?"

"Yes, it's me." Ethan waved casually. "I'm here on behalf of my father to keep an eye on Miss Young. She has a... pretty significant connection with him." He hesitated slightly at the word "significant," sensing it wasn't the best choice, but given Lily Young's annoyed expression, he kept that thought to himself and cast a sympathetic glance at Oliver, almost as if he were wearing a giant flashing sign.

Ivy nodded, catching on, and turned to Lily with a smile, "So, what about you? Here to find me?"

"Well..." Lily stammered, "When Oliver and I noticed you weren't around, we decided to look for you. You can't go back to Quantum, and neither can he."

"Right, so you can't go back either," Ivy agreed thoughtfully. She then looked to Zach, "What should we do? It seems like I can't just leave; should I go back instead?" She admitted to herself that she was being a bit spiteful, retaliating for his earlier failure to leave on time.

Zach, picking up on her underlying message, blinked his calm eyes and replied, "I don't think going back is an option right now. Maybe once this is all resolved, we can consider it. If you want, you can join us."

Lily's expression shifted from worry to joy. "Really? What are you guys planning to do? Of course, we want to go!"

"..." Ivy discreetly pinched Zach's arm. Faced with his calm demeanor, she found it hard to keep her own composure.

Zach, seemingly unbothered, continued, "I've heard that there are four times as many threats at Atomic Base compared to other places. The people there are struggling with a lack of supplies. We're thinking of heading over to see if we can help."

Four times? Ivy looked at him in disbelief. His expression remained unchanged, as if he hadn’t just shared such shocking information. When had the Atomic Base become so dangerous? She didn’t recall hearing about that.

"What’s going on?" Oliver frowned immediately, "How do you know this? I didn’t hear anything like that before leaving Quantum."

Zach slowly rolled up the car window, "I won’t share my sources with you. If you’re interested, you can join us, but the car is small, so I won't invite you to ride along. Goodbye." As he finished speaking, the window fully closed, and he stepped on the gas, driving off into the distance. Ivy looked back, and soon, Lily and the others were nearly out of sight.

"What just happened?" Ivy asked, voicing her confusion. "Why is there suddenly such a huge problem at Atomic?"

Zach merely smiled and said nothing, which made Ivy's teeth grind in irritation. She muttered under her breath as she sat in the passenger seat, "You're really annoying."

Zach feigned innocence, "I haven't done anything."

"Exactly! That’s what makes you so irritating." If you had just driven off earlier, would those people still be tailing us? Ivy glanced through the rearview mirror at the rapidly approaching group behind them, feeling increasingly frustrated.

Up until now, Zach remained unfazed, as if he was enjoying Ivy's irritation. His plan was to teach her a lesson and simultaneously eliminate the competition represented by those who had no right to challenge him. The threats surrounding the Atomic Base weren’t new; they were just the old ones clustered together. If he could handle them while also dealing with Oliver and the others, he'd earn favor and eliminate potential future threats. It was a win-win situation since those threats were of no use to him anyway.

However, Zach didn’t stay pleased for long. He soon realized he had underestimated Lily’s relentless determination...

That night, as they stopped to rest and regroup, Oliver aggressively pulled Ivy away, while Lily positioned herself in front of Zach, refusing to let him pass. Zach seethed silently as he watched Oliver drag the struggling Ivy away, his expression clearly screaming "I’m done with this!"

...This was so embarrassing! So humiliating! How could he let himself be dragged away like that? Where was his composure? Where were the witty comebacks? Usually, she was so competent!

"Professor," Lily wore a gentle, beautiful smile. "They have some personal matters to discuss, so we shouldn't disturb them." She abruptly shifted her tone, "By the way... I have something to discuss with you as well."

Zach smiled at Lily, but internally he was sharpening his metaphorical knife to cut through her persistence. He realized he was reaping what he sowed.

"Move aside; good friends don't block the way," he said, suppressing his anger and keeping his composure steady. If it weren't for the complications that would arise from tearing the mask off, he would have dealt with her long ago.

Lily frowned at his response, annoyed. "Do you really dislike me that much?"

Zach exhaled, finally losing his patience. He dropped the facade of indifference and looked at her with a chilling smirk, raising an eyebrow. "Not only do I dislike you, but I also find you quite bothersome."

"You..." Lily stared at him in shock, tears suddenly welling up in her eyes. "Is it because Ivy is well-connected and I'm not, that you look down on me?"

"No, not at all. I’ve never even looked at you," Zach said, pushing her away with enough force that she nearly stumbled. He walked a few steps, then turned back to her, wearing a mocking smile as he scrutinized her. "Honestly, it's not even a secret. I have a thing for keeping things simple; I want to get rid of unnecessary complications. Especially when I see you." His brow arched, "And don’t even think about causing trouble for Ivy. Although I’ve always thought she could handle herself, I won’t allow anyone but me to challenge her." With that, he dashed off toward the direction where Oliver was taking Ivy, not looking back.

Lily watched his retreating figure, his tall and slender frame casting a long shadow in the moonlight. That simple silhouette left her smitten, but he showed no interest in her, which was a crushing blow.

After a long moment of staring into space, she slowly clenched her fists, inhaled deeply, closed her eyes, and when she opened them again, her expression was back to normal, though it now carried a hint of barely concealed coldness and determination.

Meanwhile, when Zach, with his keen hearing and quick thinking, finally found Ivy and Oliver, he saw Oliver pinning down Ivy, seemingly intent on something unspeakable. In a moment of heated impulse, Zach rushed over and threw a punch, knocking the seemingly sturdier Oliver to the ground. Before Oliver could even register what happened, Zach kicked him again, sending him crashing against a large tree, which shook violently from the impact.

Ivy coldly straightened her clothes and brushed off Zach's outstretched arm, walking towards Oliver with a stony expression. She delivered a sharp kick to his abdomen, and Oliver had no strength left to retaliate, cold sweat pouring down his face as he saw stars.

"Oliver, I suggest you straighten out your thinking. It's easy to tell the difference between those who like you and those who don't. Those who like you will touch you, while those who don't will only hit or kick you," she said icily before turning on her heel to leave. As she passed by Zach, she grabbed his hand and pulled him along.

Zach, being dragged back by her, kindly remarked, "Are you really okay just leaving him there? What if something happens? It's not safe here, and he's injured badly."

Ivy paused, staring at the ground in silence for a moment. Suddenly, she turned and threw herself into his arms. "I owe you a thank you, and I'm sorry."

Zach stood there in shock, momentarily taken aback, as if his heart skipped a beat. Time seemed to freeze; his existence paused for her.

"I think we can develop a great friendship," Ivy said playfully, looking up at him after a long moment.

In an instant, Zach's previous moment of joy and satisfaction vanished. His conflicted and gloomy expression did not go unnoticed by Ivy, who was completely certain of her observation. 

She wasn't foolish; she had been aware of his feelings all along. She just wanted confirmation, and he didn't disappoint her.

After a lengthy silence, Zach sighed, "Ivy Smith, don't say things like that. All relationships eventually flatten out into friendship or familial bonds, so this isn't a problem."

"Is that so? Alright then," she accepted his words without further argument, quickly changing the subject. "Will leaving Oliver there really cause a problem? His behavior was terrible, but I only wanted to incapacitate him, not kill him."

Zach countered, "What did he do to you?"

What did he do? Wasn't it just talking bad about you and trying to get physical with her? Oliver seemed to have been instructed by someone, and he appeared determined to overpower her, likely under Lily's orders. How ridiculous...

"Nothing, let's head back," Ivy said. Since Lily sent him, she wouldn't just leave him there to fend for himself. Perhaps she had already taken him back. And even though she had always thought Zach was insufferable, she didn't want to hear anyone else say it besides herself.
