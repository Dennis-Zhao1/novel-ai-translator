**Chapter 8: The Great Escape**

Sophia Smith sprinted through the dimly lit alleyways, her breath coming in gasps. Her new sneakers barely made a sound on the pavement, but she couldn’t afford to slow down. Her goal was simple—put as much distance as possible between herself and the looming threat of Z.

She zigzagged through the streets, trying to confuse anyone who might be following her, until she stumbled into a small park, dotted with wildflowers. The soft glow from the lighthouse at Quantum Base flickered in the distance, casting eerie shadows.

Am I safe now? she wondered, her chest heaving. Did I really escape?

Her relief felt fragile, as if the world might crumble around her at any moment. Shaking her head, she pulled out the vial Z had given her. Carefully, she uncapped it and dabbed a small amount of the liquid behind her ears and on her shoulders. The cool sensation of the serum brought an unexpected comfort.

Clutching the vial tightly in her hand, she took a moment to gather herself.

Then she heard it: footsteps.

**A Sudden Reunion**

The sound grew louder, and Sophia ducked instinctively behind a tree. Turning her head, she found herself face-to-face with someone unexpected—a stunning woman with long, flowing black curls and a face so delicate it seemed sculpted. Her confident posture radiated an air of effortless charm.

“Sophia! I finally found you!” the woman exclaimed, her voice bright with relief. She clasped Sophia’s hands warmly. “She’s here!” she called over her shoulder. “Everyone, over here!”

Before Sophia could react, a group of familiar faces came rushing toward her. Leading them was none other than Ethan.

He frowned the moment his eyes landed on Sophia, his sharp gaze narrowing with concern. “What happened to your clothes?” he asked, striding over and gently pulling her aside. “And what’s that in your hand?”

Sophia tightened her grip on the vial, her heart pounding. Over my dead body, she thought.

“Back off!” she snapped, her knee shooting up to push him away with a well-aimed kick. Ethan stumbled back, caught off guard.

**The Intruder’s Plea**

“Stop it, both of you!” the woman cried, rushing to Ethan’s side. She knelt beside him, her face a perfect mask of concern. “Ethan, are you okay?”

Turning to Sophia, the woman’s eyes brimmed with unshed tears. “Sophia, this is my fault. I shouldn’t have gotten involved. Please don’t take your anger out on him—it’s all my doing!” Her voice trembled, every word dripping with guilt.

She stood, her delicate frame quivering as she looked back at Ethan with an air of tragic resolve. “I’ve already decided,” she announced, her voice filled with quiet determination. “I'll leave Quantum Base. I’ll go far away, and I’ll never return. I’ll give Ethan back to you.”

Sophia stared at her, blinking. The pieces clicked into place. This can only be Ivy.

“Stop!” Sophia blurted, holding up her hands. “You can’t leave!” She forced a smile, her voice desperate with feigned sincerity. “This isn’t your fault, it’s mine. I’m stubborn, okay? Don’t let my stupidity ruin everything!”

Ivy’s tear-filled eyes widened slightly as she studied Sophia’s face. Her expression flickered briefly, but she quickly recovered, nodding with graceful acceptance.

“I’ve already made up my mind,” Ivy said. “I’ve told the community leader I’ll leave once I find you. My decision won’t change.” With that, she turned and began walking away.

**The Chase**

Ethan hesitated, his fists clenching and unclenching as he watched her retreating figure. He took a half-step forward but froze, visibly torn.

Sophia scowled and gave him a nudge. “What are you waiting for? Go after her! She’s out here alone, and this area isn’t safe. What if something happens?”

Ethan looked at her, confused. “Why are you—”

“Just go!” she snapped, throwing her arms up in frustration. I know this is all part of your plan, she thought grimly. But if you don’t go now, Ivy might actually run into real danger.

When he still didn’t move, Sophia gritted her teeth and bolted after Ivy herself.

“Where are you going?!” Ethan’s voice rang out behind her, full of disbelief.

**A Looming Threat**

Ivy had covered a surprising amount of ground. Sophia was panting as she tried to catch up, all the while muttering to herself. “This woman is supposed to be the heroine, not an Olympic sprinter…”

She was about to call out when she noticed something strange. Ahead of Ivy stood a tall, shadowy figure, partially obscured by a doorway. Sophia’s blood ran cold as the figure shifted, the faint glint of a syringe catching the light.

Z.

The realization hit her like a thunderclap. Her stomach twisted as she watched the scene unfold.

Z stepped forward, his movements precise and unhurried. He raised the syringe and, without a word, plunged it into Ivy’s neck.

Ivy gasped, her eyes wide with shock as the liquid entered her veins. She stumbled, her legs giving out beneath her as Z turned and walked away, his back straight and unbothered.

Sophia skidded to a halt, her heart pounding in her ears. Ivy lay motionless on the ground, her limbs splayed awkwardly.

“What…” Sophia’s voice faltered as she staggered backward, nearly colliding with Ethan, who had just caught up.

**A Stark Reminder**

Ethan’s horrified gaze flicked between Ivy and the direction Z had disappeared. “What happened?” he demanded.

Sophia shook her head, still trying to process what she’d just witnessed. Her thoughts raced. Why? Why would Z target her?

The faint glint of the syringe in Z’s hand lingered in her mind. What was in that injection?

Ethan dropped to his knees beside Ivy, shaking her shoulders in a panic. “Ivy! Ivy, wake up!”

Sophia remained frozen, her chest tight with a mix of fear and frustration. Deep down, she couldn’t suppress a bitter thought: Whoever this “Good Samaritan” is, they just took the heroine off the board.

For once, she didn’t feel bad about being a bystander.
