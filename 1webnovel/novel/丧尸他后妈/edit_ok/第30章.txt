Z walked away with a calm demeanor, and Sophia Smith followed suit immediately. Ethan, on the other hand, seemed to deliberately resist, standing still. Ivy glanced at him and gave a slight nod, which prompted him to reluctantly join them as they exited the small backyard.

Z gently pulled the dizzy Claire from Michael's grasp and bent down, firmly holding her arm while looking into her eyes. When Claire met his piercing gaze, she shivered with fear. The moment reminded Sophia of the first time she had encountered Z.

"Take me to your brother. He won't get mad at you for sneaking out; he might even thank you," Z coaxed her, trying to sound reassuring.

Claire looked skeptical. "What do you want with my brother? Going into that building means you're up to no good!"

Sophia quickly understood the weight of Claire's words. That building had a dark past, once used for unethical experiments. If exposed, it could unravel their image as the 'good guys' in this dystopian world.

Z was not about to let his plan fail. He swiftly used duct tape to cover Claire's mouth. Her eyes widened in shock, filled with accusation and grievance as she struggled, clearly unaccustomed to being handled so roughly.

Claire was indeed the cherished sister of Chris, the governor of Atom, the second-largest base after Quantum. Even amidst the chaos of the apocalypse, she had been doted upon and likely shielded from true hardship or fear.

Ethan, filled with a hero complex, was dissatisfied with Z’s actions. He seemed resolute on rescuing Claire from Z’s grip, but he failed miserably. Z swiftly drew a gun and aimed it at Ethan’s forehead.

Ethan froze, and Claire dared not move. Ivy wanted to intervene, but Sophia instinctively placed herself in front of her, ready to shield her from any potential conflict or unwanted advances from Z.

Ivy narrowed her eyes, her gaze on Sophia carrying a hint of something complex. The scrutiny made Sophia uncomfortable, so she averted her eyes and focused on Z and Claire instead.

Z, noticing Sophia's protective stance, softened his demeanor toward Claire. "You need to learn to listen," he said before turning his attention to Ethan. "And as for you..." He clicked his tongue, his towering figure casting a shadow over Ethan, who seemed smaller in this standoff.

Z looked down at Ethan with a smirk, "You seem pretty worked up. Are you interested in the governor of Atom's prized possession?"

The sarcasm in his voice stung Ethan's pride. His bright green eyes glared at Z, fists clenched, knowing that any sudden movement could be his last.

"I’ve sensed something off about you for a while. You’re putting such pressure on a defenseless girl; who exactly are you?" Ethan observed the weapon closely, frowning. "I’ve never seen a gun like that before. Did you build it yourself?"

Z looked at him as if he were an idiot. "If I didn't build it, who else would? Do you think you could?" He tapped the gun against Ethan's forehead, making him flinch, scream, and crouch down to shield his head, losing all dignity.

Ivy watched Ethan trembling on the ground in disappointment, puzzled as to how the once-brave man she had seen at Quantum could turn into such a coward.

She couldn't help but compare Z and Ethan in her mind, solidifying her resolve to win Z over. Why should Sophia Smith be treated differently? I deserve that attention too! Her lips tightened as she fixed her dark gaze on Sophia.

Sophia glanced back at her, her expression indifferent, blinking slowly before she bent down to secure Claire's flailing wrist. She had no patience left for the girl who might have caught a glimpse of her connection with Z. The thought of that innocent girl possibly knowing Z’s secrets made her uneasy.

Claire seemed to sense the resentment emanating from Sophia. Their eyes met, and in that fleeting moment, they exchanged a basic understanding of one another.

"I hope you can reflect on your actions," Ethan managed to regain some composure, feigning calm as he gazed at Z. "She's just a little girl. No matter what, you shouldn't treat her so roughly!"

Z clearly looked down on Ethan, seemingly too lazy to share the same airspace with him. He lightly tapped Claire’s cheek with the gun, signaling her to keep quiet and follow along, then turned and walked away without looking back.

Claire, genuinely frightened, did not resist anymore and let Sophia guide her away. Ivy followed Z without a word, while Michael trailed after her, fulfilling his father's orders, though his expression showed reluctance and disdain.

Ethan stood alone in the courtyard, realizing he had been left behind. He stood dazed for a moment, his mind racing with thoughts but not settling on any conclusion, ultimately deciding to follow the group out of there.

Back at their temporary resting spot, Z retrieved a pair of handcuffs from the vehicle and secured Claire's wrists. Her big eyes turned red, looking at Z with a mix of hurt and pleading, but he refused to acknowledge her, completely unfazed. She then shifted her gaze to Sophia.

Sophia was still preoccupied with what Claire might have seen. As Claire continued to stare at her, Sophia couldn't help but think about the implications of those big, red eyes potentially witnessing Z's private moments. What was this urge to dig deeper? It was almost enough to shatter her worldview!

Despair washed over Claire as she shifted her gaze to the only person who had spoken up for her—Ethan.

Ethan, caught by her soft gaze, felt a surge of righteousness again, suppressing his instinctive fear as he shouted at Z, "Enough! She's just a little girl. She can’t do anything. If she’s not struggling anymore, just let her go! You’re a man; can’t you reflect on your actions?!"

Z had initially intended to use Claire as their guide and connection to her brother, leading them to the core of Atom. But Ethan's interference sparked a thought in Z’s mind: perhaps it would be better to eliminate these nuisances right here.

"Why should I reflect?" Z coldly retorted, glaring at Ethan. "If she dares to sneak out, she should be prepared to be caught. I'm not her brother, nor her father. What should I reflect on? That time and money can be gained? If not, then shut your mouth."

"You!..." Ethan fumed, wanting to argue back but found himself at a loss for words, his mouth agape, eyes reddening with frustration as veins throbbed on his forehead. "Don’t get too cocky! Don’t think I’m afraid of you!" He resorted to threatening to regain some dignity. "I don’t even need this little girl to find Atom! Just follow my lead, and don’t hold us back!" He turned away haughtily towards the green pickup, but no one followed him.

Confused, Ethan turned back, finding everyone staring at him in silence. His already fraying patience snapped further. "What are you all standing around for?! Didn’t we want to go to Atom? If you’re not moving, we might as well turn back!"

Z disregarded Claire entirely, leaving her in Sophia's care. He crossed his arms, watching Ethan with a smirk, disdain evident on his face. "Let me ask you something. Do you know that the main gates of the Atom base are sealed due to the zombie siege? Where the real entry point is remains unknown, and they haven’t informed any of the bases."

"Why?" Michael interjected, puzzled.

Z replied nonchalantly, "Why? Probably because they think the sudden gathering of zombies around Atom is someone’s doing."

Ivy turned her head away at this, avoiding Ethan's gaze which sought her support.

Feeling neglected, Ethan instinctively looked at Sophia, who was completely focused on Z. They stood together, wearing matching uniforms, and in the sunlight, they looked like the perfect couple.

Ethan snapped. He could no longer contain himself and lunged at Z, but his three subordinates blocked him. Frustrated, he glared at Z. "Why should I listen to you? I was a captain at Quantum! What are you?!"

Ethan’s pathetic display only highlighted Z’s composed perfection. Ethan appeared like a rabid dog, while Z maintained a calm smile, exuding a strong presence. The contrast between them was far more entertaining than any potential outcome.

Z looked at Ethan with a tone of contempt, "Do you realize you’re asking for trouble? I always take shortcuts, and whatever I decide is undoubtedly the right choice. Do you think wasting my time will hurt me? I suggest you give up those unrealistic fantasies because with your intellect, you’ll never achieve them—mortal."

Indeed, if Sophia weren’t standing right next to him, he would have already silenced this fool with a scalpel. He felt a twinge of guilt; he had thought Sophia was slow, yet he never anticipated there could be someone as foolish as Ethan. The realization was surprising.

Life is full of things that are beyond our control, but stupidity is something we bring upon ourselves.
