When Ivy Mitchell woke up, the morning sun had already flooded the room. Her body ached as she straightened up, realizing she had fallen asleep at a desk with a soft cushion beneath her head, still in her clothes from the day before. The handcuffs that had marked her wrists were gone, and her shoulder-length, wavy brunette hair had been neatly brushed, cascading down her back. If it weren't for the red marks on her wrists, treated with some ointment, she might have thought everything from the previous night had been a dream.

“Awake?” A familiar deep voice broke through her thoughts. She turned her head to see Ethan, dressed in a crisp white shirt, standing with his back to her, writing on a whiteboard. The board was covered with complex symbols and formulas, while the table was cluttered with test tubes, beakers, and microscopes. After finishing his last stroke, he tossed the remaining stub of chalk into the tray and turned to look at her.

Ivy met his gaze through the thick lenses of his glasses. Her throat felt dry, and her heart ached, as if it had been struck by a hammer.

“Are you hungry?” Ethan slowly descended from the podium, the sound of his polished shoes echoing against the floor. “What do you feel like eating?”

Ivy’s body stiffened instinctively, a rush of tension coursing through her. Ethan’s sharp eyes caught every trace of her anxiety as he approached. Silently, he bent down and retrieved a briefcase from a nearby cabinet.

Ethan entered a code to unlock the briefcase, and once it was open, he began showing her its contents.

He first took out a container resembling a lunchbox, placing it on the desk before pushing his glasses up with his finger. “This container can keep food fresh for up to a year, and it won’t get cold,” he explained, lifting the lid. The enticing aroma of a hearty chicken and vegetable stew wafted into the air. “Do you like it?” he asked, his gaze fixed on her.

Ivy felt her lips twitch as her stomach grumbled loudly, but under Ethan’s expectant scrutiny, she struggled to reject his “kindness.” Maintaining a stoic expression, she replied, “No thanks.” Who knew if he had tampered with the food? His past actions had left her unable to fully trust him.

Ethan pouted slightly, setting the lunchbox aside, and continued to present various items from the briefcase, asking, “Do you like this?” “How about this one?” “What about this?” “This one’s good, right?” Until finally, after receiving unanimous rejection, his expression darkened.

“If you don’t like any of these, then what do you like?” he asked, his tone strained, staring intensely at her with his dark eyes.

Ivy opened her mouth, wanting to say, “I’d prefer if you kept your distance,” but the words felt too cliché. For some reason, she hesitated before saying something hurtful yet straightforward.

“I... I suppose I like more practical things, like the gadget you used to fend off those creatures last time?” After a long pause, she answered his question, dropping her gaze, almost bracing herself for his inevitable sarcasm—something along the lines of “With your skills, you shouldn't even think about gadgets.”

However, the reality defied her expectations. Instead of mocking her, Ethan responded with unexpected kindness. “That? Since you like it, why not have one?”

Ivy looked at him in surprise, doubting if he had been possessed by someone else or if he had hit his head while she wasn’t looking. How had he suddenly changed?

Ethan calmly handed her the entire briefcase, “These are the best items I have on me; they’re all yours.”

Dumbfounded, Ivy clutched the briefcase, her eyes scanning the miniature instruments and tools he hadn’t yet shown her, including the gadget she had mentioned.

She felt a swirl of confusion as she sat on the desk, clearly at a loss for what to do.

After a long moment, she finally raised her eyes to him, cautiously asking, “What’s your agenda this time?”

Ethan furrowed his brow at her words, as if the pent-up frustration within him had finally found an outlet, and his voice turned sharp. “What agenda do I have? What could I possibly want? Ivy Mitchell, did I only annoy you once? Do you really need to erase all my kindness?” He glared at her, exasperated. “You really have a talent for holding grudges without remembering the good.”

Ivy blinked in confusion, stammering, “Are you sure it was just once? You’ve broken your promises multiple times. Do you need me to remind you one by one?”

Ethan, frustrated, turned to leave. “No need for that. A bad impression lasts a lifetime. If one word goes wrong, you’ll never get back on my good side. Just pretend I said nothing; no matter how careful I am, it always ends in failure.”

Ivy closed the briefcase and hopped off the desk, quickly putting on her shoes before frowning and following after him. She wanted to defend herself, but for some reason, he stopped in his tracks when he opened the door. She leaned to the side, curious, and caught sight of Mike and Nina standing outside, their expressions a mix of surprise and intrigue. Mike still held his hand up, as if he had just been about to knock.

After a moment, Mike awkwardly lowered his hand, which had nearly struck Ethan in the chest. Though he wasn’t short, standing at nearly six feet tall, he only reached Ethan’s shoulder.

“Sorry,” Mike said, his voice filled with remorse. “I was so rude. Next time, I’ll definitely ask for permission before knocking. Professor, please don’t be angry with me.”

Ethan managed a humorless smile. “You’re in such a hurry to find me for the antidote, aren’t you? Fine, that saves me a trip.” He turned away, ignoring Ivy as he walked back into the lab. Moments later, he emerged, holding a syringe, expelling the air until the liquid filled the needle. He took a small porcelain bottle, inserted the needle into its rubber cap, and injected the solution inside before gently shaking it and handing it to Mike.

Mike received it with mixed feelings, gratitude shining in his eyes. “Thank you, Professor. You’re a savior to all of us in the lab,” he said, his tone almost reverent. “However...” He hesitated, the anguish evident in his expression. “But I have some unfortunate news. All our water sources have been poisoned overnight and are now undrinkable!”

Ivy immediately looked at Ethan, her eyes practically screaming, “You didn’t do it, did you? It has to be you, who else could it be?” The intensity of her gaze made Ethan’s eyes twitch, barely stopping himself from erupting in front of Mike and Nina.

“Is that so?” Ethan’s tone dripped with sarcasm. “That’s just unfortunate. Water is the source of life. Even if you manage to neutralize the toxins in the soil and air, you’ll still need to go out and find a new water source.”

Mike’s face fell, tears welling in his eyes.

Nina gazed at Ethan with sparkling eyes, her tone teasing. “Professor, don’t scare Mr. Mike anymore. You can create antidotes for the toxins in the air and soil; surely making one for the water is a piece of cake for you?”

Ethan narrowed his eyes slightly, glancing down at Nina, a thoughtful expression crossing his face.

Ivy’s gaze darted between them, instinctively stepping back to distance herself, her focus shifting back to Mike as she deliberately avoided their interaction.

Unbeknownst to her, Ethan had seemingly taken root in her life, like a dandelion that the wind had scattered across her heart. She hesitated, not immediately blowing it away. Instead, it took root and sprouted silently within her.

Watching him stand beside someone who would inevitably be linked to him in her mind filled her with a subtle sense of repulsion and discomfort, leaving her deeply unsettled.
