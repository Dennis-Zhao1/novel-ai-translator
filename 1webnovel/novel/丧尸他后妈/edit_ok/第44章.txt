Z had decided not to confront Ethan just yet, and it wasn't because of any personal shortcomings. He wasn't so arrogant as to believe he was invincible, though he often felt that way. But this time, he held back for two reasons: he couldn't act in front of Chloe, and the mutated virus in the zombies might be linked to the new bullets he had developed. These bullets were designed to interact with the virus inside Ivy, causing her suffering, but their effect on the older virus strain was unknown.

He pushed these thoughts aside. Time was of the essence, and he couldn't afford to worry about others. His priority was stopping Ivy, and if that meant a few casualties along the way, so be it. Risking his own safety for people he deemed inconsequential was not an option; he was already stretched thin managing things with Sophia.

Ethan had proven reliable, assisting Chloe with the zombie threat using a bacterial solution from their research lab. The solution was potent, though when Chloe asked about side effects, Ethan was evasive. He didn't promise there wouldn't be any, but Chloe allowed its use out of necessity—hesitation could lead to disaster, and using it bought them precious time.

As their team returned from the Atom facility, Z and Sophia arrived late. Ethan had been gearing up to speak but was interrupted by Z's timely entrance, which prevented him from taking action.

Sophia noticed Ethan's gaze linger on her before he shifted focus. Z remained silent, his presence dominating the room. He walked with a smile that hid a dangerous edge, a skill some mastered naturally.

Ethan felt a surge of urgency. He had hurried over when Ivy's tracker sent an emergency signal, but underestimating Z was a grave mistake. If he didn't act soon, the consequences could be dire—he needed to eliminate Z before it was too late.

That evening, Z handed Sophia a glass of water and two pills. Before she could ask, he said, "Take these, and it will help you conceive." Sophia trusted him implicitly and took the pills without question. But the more she trusted him, the heavier Z's conscience felt. After she took the medication, he stepped out, dressed formally in a simple black suit and tie, as if preparing for a significant event.

Sophia thought his attire was odd, but given his peculiar nature, she didn't dwell on it. They headed to a large banquet hall at the Atom facility after receiving a message from Chloe about an important announcement.

"What do you think they want at Atom?" Sophia asked, a hint of disdain in her voice. "Why don't we just leave and not get involved anymore?"

Z stopped abruptly, looking at her intently. "Are you sure?" He needed her decision to be firm to avoid the chaos he sensed was brewing.

Sophia hesitated, then nodded. "Let's wait until tomorrow. It's too late now, and the area around Atom isn't safe."

"If we're leaving, we should go now," Z insisted. "Otherwise, don't mention it again."

Sophia fell silent, and Z took this as indecision, continuing towards the banquet hall, engrossed in his handheld device, which displayed complex data she couldn't decipher.

Every path has an end, and some things must be faced. They arrived at the banquet hall, which resembled an old cinema with rows of seats and a grand stage. A deep red curtain hinted at something ominous.

"I..." Sophia's instincts flared. She tugged at Z's sleeve, eyeing Ethan and others by the stage, and stepped back. "Let's leave."

Z turned to follow her out, but the heavy doors slammed shut. Soldiers stood guard, armed with special weapons from the Ion facility—Ethan's doing, no doubt.

Z smirked, counting the guards. Ten. They underestimated him. One against ten? Laughable.

"Dr. Smith, Miss Johnson," a voice called from afar. "Since you're here, why not stay and catch up?" The speaker paused, adding, "Mr. Miyazaki, you have much to say to Dr. Smith, don't you?"

Sophia looked ahead. Miyazaki Yusuke stood out, unarmed amidst the crowd, his expression conflicted as he glared at Z.

Xiao Cong, the voice's owner, stepped forward in military attire, his presence commanding. "Dr. Smith? Or should I call you Mr. Z?"

Sophia felt a chill. She had suspected this moment would come. Was it relief or resignation that made her sigh?

"Stop struggling," Xiao Cong taunted. "Surrender quietly."

Z surveyed the soldiers, calm despite the tension. Xiao Cong's arrogance grew. "Cooperate, and I won't kill you immediately. Otherwise, you'll share Miss Johnson's fate."

Chloe interjected, "Miss Johnson might not know his true identity."

"Doesn't know?" Xiao Cong replied, skeptical. "A woman with a man like Z can't be clueless. She's complicit." He sneered, "Bitch."

The word "bitch" triggered something in Z. His demeanor shifted, and the soldiers faltered, their weapons dropping.

Z smiled slightly, producing a small vial from his pocket. The scent from the open vial rendered the soldiers dazed and immobile.

"What is this!?" Xiao Cong shouted, aiming his gun at Z. "Stay back!"

"Orders are only as valuable as the person giving them," Z replied, his voice dangerously calm. "From you, they're worthless."

"Even if you're unafraid of dying, consider Miss Johnson," Chloe pressed, her voice sharp. "You've acted behind her back. The zombie mutations, Yaya's injuries, Ivy's suffering—it's all you."

Sophia froze, stunned by the revelations. Z stood still, neither confirming nor denying.

Chloe continued, "You must have promised Miss Johnson something to gain her trust, but you've only brought chaos. Even if you helped create an antidote, your intentions were never pure."

Ethan stepped forward, addressing Z from a distance. "Miss Chloe has woken up. Your plan is exposed—deny it no longer."

Sophia watched, overwhelmed. Z moved forward, gripping her wrist. He was unfazed by the guns, turning to her. "Stop guessing. They're right. I never intended to change; I deceived you. This world needs to be remade."

He faced the crowd again, his dark eyes gleaming, a chilling smile on his lips. "Tonight, I'll introduce you to a new reality." With a snap of his fingers, the curtain fell, revealing iron barriers and a horde of zombies.

Sophia stood in shock, the words "zombies unleashed" echoing in her mind. They were the hunters, and the people below were prey.

Z turned to her, his voice soft yet firm. "I don't want to be a hero. I want to protect you, to be your knight. Will you help me build our new world?"
