**Chapter 1: The Unlucky Name**

Sophia Smith sat at her desk, her tone gentle and professional as she guided a buyer through the quirks of her online shop’s adult product catalog. Years of running her small e-commerce business had given her the patience to fend off most trolls and fake buyers looking for cheap thrills. Yet, every so often, someone came along whose cluelessness defied belief.

Like this guy.

**[Buyer]:** "Boss lady, I’m as nervous as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. Can you tell me more about this... uh... Golden Shield of Abundance thing?"

Sophia squinted at the screen, her lips twitching into a smirk. 

"Nervous like a cat? Please," she muttered. "Try living every day like you’re about to get audited by the IRS!"

Still, professionalism came first. She typed out a detailed description of the product, hoping to seal the deal. But then the buyer responded:

**[Buyer]:** "Thanks, boss lady! But my girlfriend’s super intimidating. She won’t let me use it on her. Can I use it on myself instead?"

Sophia froze. Blinking, she hesitated before typing back: "I guess so? But it’s not designed for that. Use at your own risk."

**[Buyer]:** "No worries! As long as it fits, I’m good."

"And if it gets stuck?" Sophia shot back, a mix of curiosity and disbelief.

**[Buyer]:** "That’s fine! My girlfriend’s into that. She’s a total queen."

“Oh, a certified masochist,” Sophia sighed, watching as the buyer finalized the purchase. Out of grudging respect for their "true love," she even upgraded the packaging.

With the order complete, Sophia checked the time—it was nearly noon. She shut her laptop and decided to call her dad for lunch.

Sophia walked into the living room to find her dad glued to the TV. The screen displayed a news broadcast, the rapid-fire commentary a blur to her ears. At first, she didn’t think much of it. But as she approached, she noticed her dad’s sweaty forehead and how he awkwardly held the remote in front of his lap, as if shielding... something.

The blush on his face confirmed it.

“Dad…” Sophia groaned, pinching the bridge of her nose. She patted him on the shoulder and switched the channel to a more wholesome program. “How about we cut back on… those kinds of videos, yeah? Mistaking a news program for your private stash is... dedication, I guess.”

Red-faced and mumbling, her dad sank behind the sofa, hiding his embarrassment. Taking pity on him, Sophia headed to the kitchen to scrounge up some lunch. Grilled cheese sandwiches it was—again.

Not long after, her father emerged from his hiding spot, calm and composed as if nothing had happened. Without a word, he tied on his apron and gently nudged Sophia out of the kitchen.

Sophia grinned. Her dad’s cooking skills were leagues above hers, and she wasn’t about to argue. Cheerfully, she plopped onto the couch, flipping through TV channels until her phone buzzed.

The caller ID read Security Guard Jack.

“Hello?”

A booming voice came through. "Hey, is this Little Smith?"

Sophia’s eye twitched. “...Please call me Big Smith.”

It was a sore subject. Growing up with the last name Smith had been a cruel joke. From childhood taunts of “Little Smith the turtle” to the inevitable “Old Smith” nickname waiting in her future, it was a curse she couldn’t escape.

"Whatever," Jack grunted. "Your dad left his book at the security desk. Should I bring it over, or are you picking it up?"

Sophia wasn’t about to pass up an opportunity to be lazy. Sweetly, she said, “Oh, Brother Jack, you’re so charming and generous! Surely you wouldn’t mind bringing it over for me?”

Ten minutes later, Jack arrived with the book.

The title was ridiculous: The Apocalypse Chronicles: A Lustful Rebirth. The cover was equally over-the-top, featuring a scantily-clad woman wielding a chainsaw against a horde of zombies.

Flipping through the pages, Sophia’s expression shifted from horror to pity. By the time she reached the third chapter, she felt an odd mix of guilt and resignation.

With the book in hand, she marched into the kitchen.

“Dad,” she began solemnly, “I’m so sorry. It’s my fault you’ve been lonely all these years. I’ll find you a stepmom soon, I swear!”

Her father froze mid-stir, glaring at her. “What nonsense are you spouting now? Need money again?”

“No, I mean it!”

“Whatever it is, no. You’re broke? Fine, I’ll just adopt a richer daughter.”

“...”

Unfazed, Sophia slapped the book onto the counter. “Explain this. Jack said it’s yours. Didn’t know you were into... this.”

Her dad’s brows furrowed as he stared at the gaudy cover. Finally, he sighed, voice heavy with despair.

“All of this—every page of that trash—is because of you.”

“Me?” Sophia frowned. “What does this nonsense have to do with me?”

“Everything! The villain in that story? Same name as you. Same single-parent background. Same violin lessons and low IQ. Honestly, I think someone wrote it just to drag you through the mud!”

“Pfft, it’s just a coincidence.”

“Coincidence?!” Her dad’s voice rose. “You’re practically living her tragic arc—dumped, humiliated, friendless—do you want your story to end in suicide or family massacre, huh?”

Sophia fled to her room with the book, determined to prove him wrong. She read straight through the night, closing the book just as the clock struck midnight.

Her verdict?

“What a mess…”

The villainess who shared her name had endured every imaginable horror: betrayed by her fiancé, robbed of her father’s base, infected by zombies, and gruesomely killed. It was a trainwreck of humiliation and despair.

“Unreal,” Sophia muttered, burying her face in her pillow. As sleep claimed her, she thought, At least it’s over now.


**Chapter 2: A New Nightmare**

Sophia woke with a start. Her head throbbed from what felt like hours of restless nightmares. Groggily, she took in her surroundings.

Something wasn’t right.

The bed wasn’t hers. The blanket wasn’t hers. And there, by the door, was a strikingly handsome stranger buckling his belt.

Her breath caught.

“What...?” she whispered, her voice cracking.

The man turned at her noise, his blue eyes narrowing in concern. “Sophia? Are you okay?”

Her pulse quickened. Who is this? Where am I?

Before she could speak, the man stepped closer, his golden hair catching the light. Leaning down, he pressed a soft kiss to her forehead before turning to leave.

“Wait!” Sophia blurted, panic flaring in her chest.

The man froze, looking at her with mild confusion.

“Who... who are you?” she stammered.

His brows furrowed. “Sophia, it’s me—Ethan, your fiancé. Are you feeling alright?”

The name hit her like a truck.

Ethan. Fiancé.

Oh, no.

She wasn’t just anywhere. She was in the book.

And not as the heroine. She was the doomed villainess.

Sophia forced herself to smile, masking the storm brewing inside. “Oh... Ethan. I was just joking! You know, to... lighten the mood.”

Ethan looked puzzled, his blue eyes scanning her face. He tilted his head slightly, clearly sensing something off. After all, the original Sophia Smith—the character he believed her to be—was a docile, love-struck fool who worshiped the ground he walked on.

“Joking?” he repeated cautiously. “Are you sure you’re okay? You’ve been acting strange since the fight with Emma.”

Emma. The heroine of the story. The original Sophia’s supposed “best friend” and the reason for her ultimate downfall.

Sophia’s mind raced. If she was right, she’d been dropped right into the opening act of The Apocalypse Chronicles: A Lustful Rebirth.

The timeline clicked into place. This was right after Emma had "accidentally" knocked the original Sophia unconscious during a confrontation over Ethan. It was the inciting incident that led to everything going wrong in the villainess's life.

“Don’t worry, I’m fine,” Sophia replied quickly, waving a hand as if brushing the matter away. “I just need a little time to think.”

Ethan hesitated, but the relief on his face was clear. “Alright, if you say so. But remember, Emma didn’t mean to hurt you. She was just scared.”

Scared? Sophia’s jaw tightened. “Right. Scared.”

Of course, in the original story, Emma could do no wrong. Everyone adored her, excused her flaws, and enabled her selfish behavior. Sophia Smith, on the other hand, was nothing but a punching bag—literally and figuratively.

Not anymore, Sophia thought grimly.

Ethan turned to leave, but Sophia stopped him with a casual tone that belied the tension in her chest. “By the way, I’ve decided to call off our engagement.”

He froze.

Sophia continued, her voice light and deliberate. “Don’t worry, I’ll handle my father. You’re free to be with Emma. No need to thank me—just call me Saint Sophia.”

Ethan turned back, his face pale with shock. For a man used to having two women wrapped around his finger, this was clearly not the response he expected.

The door clicked shut behind him, and Sophia let out a long breath, her composure cracking. She was in the book. The same book she’d just mocked the night before. And worse, she was stuck in the shoes of a character doomed to fail.

“Great,” she muttered, flopping back onto the bed. “I’m not just in a nightmare. I am the nightmare.”

**Escaping the Script**

The next morning, Sophia had a plan. She wasn’t going to sit around waiting for tragedy to strike. If this story wanted her to suffer, she’d flip the script and make her own way out.

Her first move? Escape.

The Quantum Base, where she was currently holed up, was the largest of the four human settlements left standing in this apocalyptic world. It was her father’s domain, and while that meant she had resources and safety, it also meant she was in the story’s central danger zone.

Sophia’s goal was clear: get far, far away from Quantum Base.

The perfect opportunity came with the morning supply run. The base regularly sent teams into the zombie-infested wilderness to scavenge for food, medicine, and weapons. It was risky, but Sophia knew the mission routes and where they intersected with the plot.

More importantly, she remembered a crucial detail from the book: the location of a secret lab where a vial of anti-zombie serum was hidden.

This serum, created by the infamous "Z," the story’s mad scientist and ultimate antagonist, was a game-changer. A few drops of the liquid emitted a scent that repelled zombies, making the user invisible to the infected.

In the original story, Sophia’s father discovered the serum by accident, but it was wasted in his futile attempts to protect her. Now, it was Sophia’s turn to claim it and rewrite her fate.

**A Risky Gamble**

As the supply team geared up, Sophia joined them, strapping on a small pistol.

Ethan intercepted her at the gates, his expression skeptical. “Are you sure you should be coming? You’ve barely recovered from the fight.”

Sophia rolled her eyes, brushing past him. “I’m fine. Besides, I want to help. Isn’t that what Emma would do?”

The mention of Emma was enough to shut him up.

The group set out, leaving the safety of the base’s perimeter. The world outside was bleak—a wasteland of crumbling buildings, overgrown streets, and the ever-present threat of the undead.

Sophia kept to the back of the group, her mind focused on her plan. The lab wasn’t far—a decrepit factory just off their usual route.

When the group paused to rest, she slipped away, darting toward the factory.

The building loomed before her, its broken windows and rusted doors a stark reminder of the apocalypse. Taking a deep breath, Sophia slipped inside.

The lab was just as the book described: dusty, cramped, and filled with abandoned equipment. Her heart pounded as she searched, each creak of the floorboards sending a chill down her spine.

Finally, in a small drawer near the back, she found it—a tiny glass vial, shimmering faintly in the dim light.

“Bingo,” she whispered, tucking the serum into her bag.

**A New Direction**

With the serum secured, Sophia rejoined the group unnoticed. Back at the base, she prepared for the next phase of her escape: leaving Quantum Base for Molecule Base, a smaller settlement far removed from the story’s chaos.

Her plan was risky, but she had no choice. Staying meant death—slow, humiliating, and inevitable.

As she packed supplies, she whispered to herself, “Goodbye, Quantum. Let’s see if I can survive this story after all.”

With that, she stepped into the night, the vial of serum her only ally in an unforgiving world.
