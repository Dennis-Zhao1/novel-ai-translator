Sophia Smith's main aim was to thaw Ethan's frosty demeanor. So, even after he had snapped at her, she chose not to get upset. Instead, she brushed off his rudeness with a gentle smile, feeling a sense of accomplishment.

Ethan was completely perplexed by her. His emotions were a tangled mess of confusion and irritation, yet he couldn’t bring himself to hold her accountable. He turned to Lily with a stern look and asked, "Miss Lily, are you going to give me the right directions now?"

Lily shivered slightly at his intimidating expression and quickly responded, "It's, um, this road. Just back up a bit and turn left when you see the bend..."

Ethan let out a dismissive grunt, started the car, and casually asked Sophia, "That was Nina who pushed you, right?"

Sophia looked surprised, lowering her gaze to her fingers. "Did you see?"

"Of course," Ethan replied, looking into the rearview mirror with a sarcastic grin. "Only someone completely oblivious wouldn't have noticed such a scene."

"Yeah," Sophia sighed as she stared ahead. "What do you think I should do?"

Ethan dryly suggested, "I think if you could just give her a piece of your mind, half of your problems would be solved."

Sophia studied his profile and paused before replying. Once they were on the right road, she noticed Lily eavesdropping and immediately covering her ears, her face showing a clear "don't listen" expression.

She turned back to Ethan, whispering, "I did think about confronting her, but in that moment, I realized if I really did, her friends wouldn't stand idly by."

"What are you afraid of with me around?" Ethan asked, his tone carrying a hint of bravado. Despite his disdainful attitude towards Sophia, he was keenly aware of how much he feared her leaving him.

"Two against four, and there are still challenges to face. The odds aren't in my favor, and I don't want to take any risks," Sophia replied, running a hand over her face. "If you get hurt because of this, it would be a loss for me."

Ethan felt his sharp retorts soften by her reasoning. He opened his mouth but finally settled on, "I'll handle this. You don’t need to worry about it."

"You will?" Sophia leaned closer, lowering her voice to prevent Lily from overhearing. "What’s your plan?"

Ethan felt a shiver run through him, his body reacting to her proximity. He focused intently on the road ahead, his voice steady as he said, "Just leave it to me. I'll make sure it’s taken care of." As he turned to look at her, his lips brushed against hers. Instantly, Sophia pulled back, her fingers brushing her lips in disbelief, and Ethan lightly chuckled, "You should think about how to repay me."

Sophia felt a bead of sweat trickle down her back. "With O'Hara out of the picture, my dad probably won’t hear from me anymore. He might worry, and there are some important things I need to tell him. Do you have a way for me to contact him?"

Ethan looked at her in surprise. "This is the first time you’ve actively wanted to contact your dad. I thought there was no affection between you two."

"..." There really wasn’t much affection. Just thinking about her dad reminded her of Mr. Smith, so unless absolutely necessary, Sophia chose to ignore the subject. "After all, with O'Hara gone," she sighed.

With her childhood sweetheart's fiancé out of the picture, there would definitely be some explaining required on her dad’s end. If Nina got there first to complain, it would be a disaster.

Ethan's expression darkened at the constant mention of O'Hara. Suddenly, he slammed on the brakes, stopping the car and getting out.

Sophia stared at his swift movements in disbelief and soon saw him opening the rear door, pulling Lily out of the car, and handing her over to Ken.

A moment later, he returned to the front seat, but instead of taking the driver’s seat, he walked over to the passenger side. "Get out," he ordered, looking at her. "You drive."

"Me?" Sophia pointed to herself in surprise.

"Yes, you. I'm tired and need to rest. Just follow Ken's car," he gestured towards the green pickup truck, making his intentions clear. Sophia glanced at his dark circles and obediently got out to take the driver's seat. She closed the door and hesitated, glancing at Ethan, who had crossed his arms and was feigning sleep. "I’m not very good at driving, so don’t fall too deep into sleep, or else..."

Ethan abruptly opened his eyes, coldly fixing her with a stare. "Sophia Smith, not sleeping well is a real problem. Do you realize you're putting my health at risk?"

Sophia turned back to the wheel, her voice softening as she said, "Then you should sleep well and have sweet dreams."

Ethan was momentarily taken aback. He regretted saying that, but he couldn't bring himself to back down, ultimately just getting angrier at himself, while Sophia remained unfazed, fully focused on driving, afraid of making a mistake and getting scolded again.

Leaning back, Ethan stared at the sky, exhaling deeply, not even sure what he was frustrated about, so he decided to blame it on the whole world for now.

With Ethan relegated to the role of a passenger, and her being the driver, Sophia couldn’t afford to let her mind wander anymore. She concentrated all her efforts on driving, and the car fell into a hush.

After considering the specific steps for dealing with Nina, Ethan finally closed his eyes and began to rest. This was rare for him; he rarely let his guard down in front of anyone, but when it came to Sophia, it was a different story.

Ethan's mind felt hazy, perhaps due to sheer exhaustion. Gradually, he fell into a deep sleep, his brain feeling cold and heavy.

It seemed he was dreaming. He couldn’t tell if it was because he’d mentioned "health" before sleeping, but he found himself with a son...

However, he wasn’t happy about it at all. Because... he and his son had been left by the child's mother.

The child's mother was undoubtedly Sophia. She had left them, and he and the child stood there, dumbfounded, watching her retreating figure. The child cried out, "Daddy, why doesn’t mommy want us? Aren't I your own? Why did mommy abandon us?"

Ethan felt an overwhelming guilt at his son's tear-streaked face, and he was overcome with emotion, tears streaming down his cheeks. Even he found his own reflection in this dream to be surreal.

He could hear himself saying, "Son, Daddy... I'm so sorry!"

...

Ethan jolted awake, drenched in cold sweat, gasping for breath. A pristine handkerchief was handed to him, and he followed the gesture to see Sophia's worried gaze.

"Did you wake up? Lily has brought us into the base. You’ve been asleep, and I didn’t have the heart to wake you. Do you want to meet Connor?" she asked softly.

Ethan looked at her, still shaken by the remnants of his dream. Serves him right for liking her! How pathetic! He needed to find an opportunity to clear his heart and mind.

"I won't meet him," Ethan replied blankly as he took the handkerchief, then added after a pause, "Where are Nina and the others?"

Hearing Nina’s name made Sophia inexplicably uneasy. She pursed her lips, "They should be having dinner with Connor right now."

"Why didn't you go?" Ethan asked, looking at her.

"Because you're here," Sophia answered matter-of-factly.

That was music to Ethan's ears, and his expression softened. Just when he felt his mood improving, someone interrupted him.

"Is Miss Smith here?"

A clear, melodious voice, as soothing as a gentle breeze, rang out from outside the car. Sophia opened the door to see a slender man in a dark blue single-breasted uniform standing a few steps away. The uniform had a formal air, with crimson piping at the cuffs and collar, highlighting the man's charm and providing a striking contrast to Ethan's more rugged demeanor.

It was Alex, Lily's older brother, Connor's younger brother, and the vice governor of the base.

With his black hair neatly styled, Alex stepped forward and smiled at Sophia. "Miss Smith, we met earlier. I trust you remember me?"

"Of course, Vice Governor Alex," Sophia nodded. "What can I do for you?"

Alex glanced inside the car, his approach polite and unobtrusive, allowing him to see without being intrusive. But upon locking eyes with Ethan's dark gaze peeking from under his bangs, he suddenly sensed a strong hostility coming from him.

Alex hesitated for a moment before saying, "I’m here on behalf of my brother to invite you and Ethan to dinner."

Before Sophia could respond, Ethan spoke up, his tone calm as he declined, "No need. We appreciate Vice Governor Alex's kindness, but we have some matters to attend to and won't disturb you."

Sophia leaned back in her seat to give Ethan space. Ethan crossed his legs, casting a cool glance at Alex. Alex stared at him, slightly taken aback as he replied softly, "Alright. You two are esteemed guests. If you finish your business and are hungry, feel free to ask the base staff to prepare a midnight snack. I wish you success." He politely bowed before turning to leave, his confident stride and upright posture making him even more handsome.

Watching the admiration in Sophia's eyes, Ethan rolled his eyes and got out of the car. He walked over and said gruffly, "I have things to do," before striding away.

Sophia looked at his aloof figure and couldn’t help but exclaim, "That’s beyond being a typical narcissist, isn’t it? That’s full-blown prince syndrome."

Ethan's keen hearing caught her words. He had intended to handle Nina alone, but now, with his mood slightly lifted, he turned back with an impassive expression, pulling Sophia down and dragging her into a secluded corridor.

His tone was calm, but the questions he fired at her made her flustered. "Did you just call me a narcissist?"

Sophia wanted to deny it quickly, but Ethan didn’t give her a chance to respond. He pressed on, "Have you ever seen such a lowly prince?"

Sophia was left speechless, feeling utterly helpless. She finally said bluntly, "What’s wrong with you? If there’s something I’ve done wrong, just tell me, and I’ll change. Can we not be so cryptic with each other?"

"Get along well? Of course, that’s fine," Ethan was about to voice his opinion when Sophia added hastily, "But let’s be clear first: our values and sense of right and wrong might differ, so let’s not try to change each other."

Ethan looked down at her, his expression tightening before he said in a low voice, "Good, then it’s settled."

Realizing she had misspoken again, Sophia felt a wave of despair wash over her. She felt like crying in frustration. Dating was definitely a brain-racking endeavor!

Ethan struggled to calm his own emotions, a myriad of thoughts racing through his mind. But he appeared composed, walking over to embrace her gently, patting her back soothingly.

Sophia froze in his embrace, feeling his warmth replace the previous hostility. Then... everything else seemed to fade away.

Ethan was a walking contradiction. Sometimes, he seemed emotionally inept, while at other times, he exhibited a level of emotional intelligence that was surprisingly high.

But what was really going on inside him? What did Ethan really think?

In this moment, he held Sophia, a radiant smile on his face. At the corridor’s end, he caught a glimpse of Alex and Ken hastily leaving, looking quite apologetic for having interrupted them.

Ethan smiled as serenely as a gentle spring rain, effortlessly wrapping Sophia around him. She clung to his waist, blissfully unaware that he had just eliminated two potential rivals in his eyes.

In his mind, Ethan kept a list of names—everyone who needed to be dealt with, whether they had provoked him or Sophia. One by one, he would eliminate those on the list, just as he had done with the researchers back then.

He was indeed a ruthless person, and that was his nature. If his depth could be likened to a place, then someone like Ken could be seen as a well, while Ethan's heart could contain at least two vast cities.
