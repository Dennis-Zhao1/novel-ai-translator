"Sophie?" Mr. Smith noticed his daughter, Sophie, standing there, seemingly detached and unresponsive. He furrowed his brow, repeating his request with a hint of urgency, "Come on over here, sweetheart."

Shouldn't there be a 'Daddy loves you' in there too? Sophie thought to herself, casting him a sideways glance. She replied with a hint of sarcasm, "Am I supposed to walk over just to get lectured?"

Mr. Smith was taken aback, looking at her as if he couldn't believe what he was hearing. His hands trembled slightly, as though he was struggling to contain his emotions, clutching his chest as if her words had truly hurt. "What do you mean by that?!"

"If you didn't catch that, I'd be happy to repeat it," Sophie replied coolly, her voice steady.

Zach, standing nearby with a confident smirk, leaned casually against a tree. Despite his relaxed demeanor, there was something unsettling about his presence.

"Mr. Smith, do you see now that I'm telling the truth?" said Emily, jumping into the conversation to stir the pot. Her logic seemed sound; after all, in tense situations, people often think of themselves first.

Mr. Smith looked at Sophie, disappointment etched across his features. "You've really hurt your old man's feelings."

Sophie shrugged, a faint smile tugging at the corners of her lips. "Someone I really look up to once said, 'I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but I definitely don’t want you to hurt mine.'"

Zach's curiosity was piqued. "Someone you admire? Who might that be?"

"George Clooney," Sophie replied without hesitation.

"Who? Is he dead or something?"

"..." Why do I suddenly feel like I want to strangle him?

"Enough." Mr. Smith gritted his teeth, forcing a smile. "Alright, since that's how it is, we don't need to pretend anymore."

"Mr. Anderson," chimed in James, trying to project a sense of righteousness. "Hold on, Sophie might just be confused for the moment."

"People change," Emily sneered, a smirk dancing on her lips. "Even flowers on the same branch can bloom differently."

Mr. Smith's eyes, filled with disappointment, swept over Emily, but he chose to remain silent, redirecting his gaze back to Sophie. It was as if he was looking past her to someone else. After a moment, he sighed. "Fine, no one is obligated to save someone who’s lost their way."

People really do change. Sophie resonated deeply with that thought, feeling transformed herself, as she looked at these people, feeling a strong urge to sever ties with them all.

James's face turned pale, his lips pressed tightly together as he lingered in the shadows of the crowd, occasionally glancing at Zach, looking utterly conflicted.

Zach strolled over to Sophie, asking politely, "May I start now?"

Sophie had been curious about the person Zach mentioned earlier who needed "emotion." Given the current situation, that person should be making an appearance soon, right? She looked at Zach with a questioning gaze, seeking clarification.

Zach smiled reassuringly, ready to enlighten her, but before doing so, he presented an enormous challenge to the group before him.

His long, slender fingers tapped rhythmically on the screen of his laptop, clearly preparing for something significant. Yet, the group, armed with weapons, didn't dare make a move against Zach, who had already disarmed himself.

Once bitten, twice shy; their fear of Zach was justified. He swiftly concluded his computer operation, pulling Sophie back a few steps. The fabric of his coat fluttered softly in the wind, gradually settling into calmness.

However, as it settled, a greater turbulence emerged.

A bridge was obliterated from below by an unknown force; earth and rubble mixed with dust blurred the scene. Sophie stood beside Zach, within the pre-calculated safe zone, realizing for the first time just how brilliant the man next to her truly was.

For the first time, she realized that Zach was indeed a super genius, crafted from the most perfect genes on Earth.

Turning her gaze toward him, she saw him looking at the emerging silver mech through the dust with a smile, then he turned to her, proudly asking, "What do you think? It took a little time, but the effect looks pretty good."

"A little time?" 

Sophie was utterly impressed, and she certainly wouldn’t criticize it. Her reaction pleased Zach, who watched as his designed mech warrior landed smoothly on the ground. It stood firm, its form and height impressively commanding.

"Is that... Iron Giant?" Sophie asked, her curiosity piqued.

Zach's lips twitched in denial. "What is that? I've never heard of it."

"Don't kid around! It looks exactly like him! You based it off Iron Giant, didn't you? I didn’t know you were a fan of animated classics!" Sophie seemed to have missed the main point entirely, especially as the group across from them stood frozen, unable to flee or fight, staring at their uncertain future with regret for following James into madness.

Zach had no desire to discuss that topic with Sophie. Why would he admit to something so trivial? Although... no, there were no 'although's.

He stepped forward a few paces, positioning himself before the mech. The silver warrior stood at attention, its electronic voice steady and deep: "Hello, sir."

"Good boy." Zach affectionately patted the mech's leg, his eyes gleaming as he turned toward James and the others. "You haven’t seen my latest invention, have you? I brought it out for you to see. Any suggestions you might want to give me?" He paused for a moment, then suddenly added, "Deputy Governor Michael, if you want to stay alive to see your sister, you’d better come here quickly."

Michael had remained silent the entire time, his quiet demeanor somewhat strange. The others hadn’t noticed, as Zach's presence was overwhelmingly strong, making it hard for anyone to focus on anyone else.

Zach's words pushed Michael to the forefront, and while others expected it to be Zach's divisive tactic, little did they know he had successfully instigated division.

Without a word, Michael quickly joined Sophie behind the mech, standing shoulder to shoulder with her, leaving Sophie feeling slightly overwhelmed.

"What is this...?" she asked, her lips twitching in confusion.

Zach said gently, "Deputy Governor Michael is a man who knows the situation. Now that he’s lost his elder brother, he can’t afford to lose his beloved sister. Although he has another sister, that young lady should currently be..." He glanced at James, his gaze deep and captivating, "with the authorities, am I right, X?"

"X?" Greg frowned in confusion, subtly distancing himself from James.

James's body was a significant disadvantage; he lacked the physicality to contend with Zach and had to rely on his wits. In a typical scenario, he would keep a safe distance, but for the sake of his loved one's safety, he had no choice but to tread this perilous path.

James stared at Zach, struggling to maintain his composure against the onslaught of emotions battling within him. With bloodshot eyes, he stepped forward with great difficulty. "You think this means I won't fight back?"

"Perhaps you care more about the safety of that Miss Young?" Zach cast an indifferent glance at Michael.

Receiving the message, Michael replied apathetically, "Maya will handle what you requested. When the time comes, please keep your promise."

"I will," Zach boasted without a hint of shame. "I always keep my word."

Sophie was tempted to scoff, but she realized she'd probably never get that chance again because the person she wanted to criticize was simply too formidable…

James was a clever man and naturally understood the implications of their conversation. His eyes widened in shock. "What have you done to Maya?!"

Emily stepped forward to support the unsteady James, while Greg and Mr. Smith exchanged glances, secretly distancing themselves and searching for an escape route.

"You'll soon reunite with Maya," Zach said with a malicious grin.

James froze, momentarily unable to process such devastating news. Meanwhile, Mr. Smith and Greg dealt him another crushing blow—they… had fled.
