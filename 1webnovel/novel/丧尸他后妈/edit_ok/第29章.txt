This was destined to be a sleepless night. Maybe it was because Sophie Smith had taken the initiative and cooperated for the first time, but Ethan seemed to be asking for too much.

By the time he finally let her go, the first light of dawn was beginning to creep across the horizon. Her throat felt a bit raw from the night’s events. Exhausted, Sophie leaned against him, allowing him to help her clean up and get dressed. He whispered in her ear, “Let’s go downstairs; I’ll help you get organized.”

Sophie gazed at him in confusion. “Where to?” She looked utterly drained.

Ethan scooped her up and carried her into the dimly lit little building, his strides purposeful as he ascended the narrow wooden stairs to the second floor. Next to an old wardrobe, he shifted a wooden sculpture resembling a table lamp, and suddenly, a row of buttons and a fingerprint scanner popped out from the center. After quickly pressing a few buttons, Ethan placed his right index finger on the fingerprint scanner. A beep echoed, and the seemingly solid wall before them began to change.

Sophie stared in awe as the wall gradually disappeared, revealing a sloped tunnel leading underground, almost identical to one she had seen near Ethan's lab.

Unpleasant memories surged in her mind, causing her body to stiffen. Noticing her discomfort, Ethan glanced at her and soothingly said, “Everyone here has already left.”

He said just that, leaving things vague, not clarifying who had left—other test subjects, researchers, or those involved with H+.

Sophie released a sigh of relief, trying to clear her mind of the past events that were now set in stone, more resolute than ever to encourage Ethan to do more good to atone for his past wrongs. At the very least, it would provide her with a bit of solace for her conscience. Of course, if he could create a solution to restore people affected by his experiments, she would be even happier.

Ethan carried Sophie into the underground laboratory. After passing through several secure glass doors, they stopped in a room filled with high-tech equipment and sealed containers. 

Sophie slipped from Ethan's embrace and took in the size of the room, her gaze finally landing on Ethan, looking confused.

Ethan adjusted his glasses and said, “This was my old room.” He pointed at the sealed glass containers. “Those were the places where the 26 test subjects lived.”

Sophie glanced at the cage-like structures, her understanding dawning on her about the design that had been used to imprison the mutated subjects. It seemed that those considered dangerous were all confined in such containers. Moreover, these instruments and vessels appeared impervious to aging and damage; even after more than twenty years, the laboratory still seemed brand new.

“The sun is almost up,” Sophie said, attempting to change the subject.

Ethan complied, pointing toward a door. “The bathroom is that way. I’ll find you some clothes and prepare a few things. You should take a shower first.” He turned and left, his tall figure quickly disappearing down the corridor.

Sophie rubbed her arms, feeling a strange discomfort wash over her as soon as he was gone. A sense of foreboding lingered in the air, but she took a soothing hot shower. She was incredibly curious about how this place managed to remain in such pristine condition amidst the chaos, but the thought of the owner of this place extinguished her curiosity entirely.

Just as she finished showering, Ethan returned, looking freshly washed as well. His hair was still damp, and he wore a pristine white lab coat over a fitted white protective suit. The suit looked like a typical shirt and trousers, just a bit more tailored. A holster at his waist hinted at a silver, finely modified handgun, and black combat boots accentuated his tall, commanding presence.

“Change your clothes, and we’ll leave,” Ethan said, handing Sophie a set of clothes identical to his, though much smaller and designed to fit a woman’s figure.

Sophie nodded, gratefully receiving the clothing and walking into the bathroom to change. She emerged with her shoulder-length brown hair partially dry and dressed.

Ethan raised an eyebrow at her appearance, a flicker of thought crossing his eyes before he led her to another room, opening a cabinet to reveal a selection of shoes for her to choose from.

Sophie gazed at the array of matching uniforms, her eyes widening slightly as she quickly found her size. Clad in her new outfit, she followed the silent Ethan back to the surface.

Once outside, she immediately felt the air around her grow noticeably stale. Sophie paused momentarily to breathe, taking about ten seconds before she could finally relax.

“The sun’s up,” Ethan said, his tone regretful as he looked out the window at the brightening sky. He mumbled something under his breath, but Sophie couldn’t quite catch it. It seemed he didn’t wish for her to know what he had said, nor did he elaborate as he guided her outside.

Sophie intended to catch up with him and ask what he had muttered, but just as they stepped out of the small building, they were met with an unexpected sight in the quiet courtyard that should have been empty.

A girl, dressed in a white linen dress with waist-length brunette hair, was swinging back and forth on the swing set.

Upon hearing their footsteps, she turned her head, revealing a cold and icy expression on her youthful face as she glared at Sophie and Ethan.

If it hadn’t been dawn, Sophie might have thought she was seeing a ghost. Yet, whether it was due to Ethan’s presence or her newfound abilities, she felt more grounded than before. She realized she wasn’t as timid as she used to be; rather than retreating in fear, she stood her ground against the eerily dressed girl.

“You two finally decided to come out,” the girl said, her tone laced with meaning. “I thought you’d just stay inside and repeat what you did here earlier.”

“…” Sophie stared incredulously at the girl. “Did you see that?”

The girl snorted dismissively. “I’ve been here the whole time. It’s hard not to see.”

Sophie immediately turned to Ethan, her gaze filled with blame and regret, making him quickly understand that she likely wouldn’t be as forward as she had been the previous night. “You didn’t notice such a big person around?” she asked doubtfully.

Ethan opened his mouth, his gaze drifting elsewhere as he lied through his teeth, “I didn’t notice.”

Sophie didn’t even need to roll her eyes at him; the little girl did it for her, expressing disdain. “Stop pretending. You’ve known I was here since you walked in. You just didn’t want your plans to be interrupted, so you kept quiet.” She seemed quite reflective, “You looked my way at least ten times while with her, clearly debating whether or not to drag me out.”

… A live broadcast, Sophie thought, rolling her eyes skyward. It seemed that negative energy truly turned people into oblivious fools.

Ethan was never one to put himself at a disadvantage, and this moment was no exception, especially not in front of Sophie. 

The reason he had remained silent was to avoid complications. Now that the girl had appeared, Sophie would undoubtedly want to know what was going on. Rather than explaining himself directly, he preferred to let the girl speak, thus sidestepping any suspicions or doubts she might have had.

Seeing that part of his plan had concluded, Ethan took out his glasses and wiped them before putting them on. He scanned the girl from head to toe, and a flash of light flickered on his lenses—her identity had been confirmed.

Ethan's glasses weren’t just for correcting his vision; they were specially modified to function like a mini-computer, scanning everyone and everything he saw, locking onto and extracting relevant information from a vast database. That was why he could recognize people like Sophie and others at a glance, despite never having met them before.

At this moment, the imperfect scan caused by the nighttime's poor lighting had successfully completed. Ethan smirked before turning his attention back to Sophie. “I mentioned the governor of Atomic State, Sam Collins, before. Do you remember?”

Sophie was puzzled by his sudden mention of this, but she nodded in acknowledgment.

Upon hearing Sam Collins' name, the little girl's face immediately stiffened. The smugness and pretentiousness vanished, replaced by a grim expression as she glared at Ethan, whispering, “Do you know him?”

“No,” Ethan replied curtly.

“Another one pretending,” the girl seemed to relax a bit but still maintained her bravado.

Ethan smiled, “You’re mistaken. I don’t just know Sam Collins; I know everyone.”

The girl gazed at Ethan, his tall, elegant figure illuminated by the soft morning light, surrounded by a faint mist that almost made him appear ethereal. When he smiled, the upward curve of his eyes and the way his lips turned up made him look charming, stirring feelings within the young girl at the cusp of adolescence.

However, she wasn’t an ordinary girl; even in the face of such charisma, she clung to her last defense. “You’re lying,” she challenged, unsure if she was trying to convince herself or question Ethan.

Ethan appeared unbothered, yet there were very few times when he was genuinely flustered. “Maya Collins, fifteen years old, is the biological sister of Governor Sam Collins,” he explained to Sophie. “Sam cares deeply for her; she has almost round-the-clock protection. It’s a miracle she managed to escape.” He said this with a tone of admiration.

Sophie’s understanding clicked into place. “That makes sense.”

If one were to ask who Sam Collins cared about most, aside from his responsibilities, it would undoubtedly be his little sister. 

In modern terms, Sam was the epitome of a protective older brother. He had another sister, but their bond wasn’t as close, whereas with Maya, they had grown up together, relying on each other, creating an unusually deep bond.

In the original plot, it was only after Alex had taken a liking to Maya that Sam became more fond of him. Meanwhile, Jake was a mere bystander, enduring Maya’s bullying without retaliation, maintaining the decorum expected of a governor’s daughter. It was no surprise that Sam would favor her.

Realizing who had appeared, Sophie sighed. It seemed she couldn’t escape the web of narrative characters; she would have to let things unfold naturally.

“You!” Maya was evidently agitated by Ethan’s remarks. She leaped off the swing, as if about to confront them directly, but halted a meter in front of them, fists clenched and hesitating, clearly torn about whether to advance.

Just then, the group that had been waiting for Sophie and Ethan to return found them. The first to enter was Jack Quinn, who immediately spotted Maya. Following his gaze, he saw Sophie, then Ethan, and finally appeared confused, bowing respectfully. “Sorry to intrude.” He turned to leave.

Ben blocked his path, frowning impatiently. “Where do you think you’re going?”

Jack replied earnestly, “It’s wrong to interrupt others’ private matters. We should give them space.”

Ben merely scoffed, disregarding his words as he strutted into the courtyard, boldly surveying the small building and the tense standoff between the three.

Alex followed closely behind Ben, his gaze on Maya, hands clasped behind his back, clearly plotting something that wasn’t good.

Sophie looked at Ethan, who took a bold step forward. Startled, Maya darted toward the exit, colliding awkwardly with Jack, who had been standing at the doorway.
