Chapter 7: A Storm of Choices

Sophia lay uneasily on the narrow bed, her heart still racing. The room was quiet, save for the faint hum of machinery and the occasional soft exhale from Zack, who had sprawled beside her, seemingly unfazed by the tension he’d created.

She stared at the ceiling, her mind a whirl of thoughts. Tomorrow, she reminded herself. Just make it until tomorrow, get the serum, and leave this chaos behind.

But the prospect of surviving another day in Zack’s presence felt as daunting as escaping a horde of zombies.

Zack’s voice broke the silence. “You’re not sleeping.”

Sophia tensed. “How could I?” she muttered.

“You should,” he replied, his tone indifferent. “Exhaustion leads to poor decision-making. Poor decisions lead to trouble.”

She turned her head slightly to glare at him. His eyes were half-lidded, but there was a sharpness in his gaze that made her stomach twist. “You’d know all about that, wouldn’t you?” she shot back.

A faint smirk played at Zack’s lips. “I would.”

The Intrusion

Before either of them could say more, a sharp, metallic beeping filled the room, slicing through the tension like a knife. Zack sat up instantly, his posture alert as his hand reached for a panel on the wall.

“What is it now?” Sophia asked warily, sitting up as well.

Zack didn’t answer immediately. His eyes scanned the display screen, his expression darkening. “Movement near the perimeter.”

Sophia’s blood ran cold. “Zombies?”

Zack shook his head, his lips curling into a thin line. “No. Humans.”

Her heart skipped a beat. “People from my father’s group?”

“Possibly,” Zack replied, his voice steady. “Or scavengers. Either way, they’ve crossed a line.”

Sophia watched as he stood and began pulling on his discarded shirt, his movements efficient and deliberate. There was no hesitation in his actions, no concern for the potential danger.

“What are you going to do?” she asked, her voice trembling.

Zack didn’t look at her as he fastened the last button on his shirt. “Deal with it.”

Sophia’s stomach churned. “You can’t just—”

“Stay here,” he interrupted, his tone leaving no room for argument. “This doesn’t concern you.”

Left Behind

The door closed behind him with a soft click, and Sophia was left alone in the sterile room. Her fists clenched as frustration bubbled inside her. Doesn’t concern me? Everything concerns me if I’m stuck here with him!

Her gaze drifted to the serum vial still sitting on the desk. She stood and approached it cautiously, her fingers trembling as she picked it up.

I could just take this and run.

The thought was tempting, but reality quickly set in. The serum alone wasn’t enough—she didn’t know the layout of the facility or how to avoid the dangers Zack likely had waiting for her.

Her eyes flicked to the door. I need to know what he’s doing.

A Desperate Gamble

Sophia’s bare feet padded softly against the cold floor as she crept toward the door. Pressing her ear against it, she listened for any sounds of movement. The faint echo of Zack’s footsteps was barely audible, growing fainter with each passing second.

He’s gone, she thought, her pulse quickening.

Pushing the door open a crack, she peeked out into the hallway. The sterile corridor stretched in both directions, dimly lit and eerily silent.

Gathering her courage, Sophia stepped out, clutching the serum vial tightly. She didn’t have a plan—just a growing sense of urgency and a gut feeling that staying idle would only make things worse.

She moved cautiously, her eyes darting to every shadow, every corner. The faint hum of machinery and the occasional creak of the facility’s structure were her only companions.

The Lab

Her wandering eventually brought her to another room—a larger laboratory filled with rows of equipment and shelves lined with strange vials and tools. The sight sent a chill down her spine.

What kind of experiments does he do here? she wondered, her eyes scanning the shelves.

As she moved farther into the room, something caught her attention—a set of handwritten notes scattered across a desk. The papers were covered in complex diagrams and cryptic formulas, but one word stood out: Quantum Base.

Her heart sank. She scanned the notes more closely, piecing together fragments of the text. It seemed Zack had been studying the structural weaknesses of the base, identifying points of vulnerability that could be exploited.

He’s planning something, she realized, her chest tightening. Something big.

Before she could process further, a low creak sounded from behind her.

Face to Face

“Curiosity,” Zack’s voice drawled from the doorway, “is a risky trait.”

Sophia spun around, clutching the papers instinctively. Zack stood in the doorway, his dark eyes glinting with quiet amusement.

“I told you to stay put,” he said, stepping into the room.

Sophia took a shaky step back. “What are you planning?” she demanded, holding up the papers like a shield. “What are you going to do to Quantum Base?”

Zack’s lips twitched into a faint smile. “That depends,” he said, his tone maddeningly calm. “What are you willing to trade for that information?”

Her grip on the papers tightened. “Trade?”

He gestured lazily toward her. “Everything in this world has a price. If you want answers, you’ll have to offer something in return.”

Sophia’s heart pounded. “You’ve already taken enough!”

Zack’s smile widened, the faintest hint of menace creeping into his expression. “Oh, Sophia,” he said softly, “I’ve barely begun.”
