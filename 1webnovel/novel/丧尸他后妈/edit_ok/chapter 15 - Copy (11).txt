Chapter 15: The "Professor" Joins the Ride

Z stood there, calm and collected, looking as if he'd just walked off the set of a fashion shoot, rather than standing in the middle of a post-apocalyptic chaos. His polite smile and gentlemanly demeanor masked the turmoil that seemed to follow him wherever he went.

Meanwhile, inside the car, Sophia Smith couldn't help but question every decision she'd made that led her to this moment.

What is he doing here? she wondered, panic swirling in her chest like a storm.

“Professor,” Z introduced himself with a cool detachment, but his eyes, sharp and calculating, locked onto Sophia like a hawk assessing its prey.

“Professor?” Sophia muttered under her breath, leaning her head on the steering wheel. “Sounds like a villain moniker. What's next? Giving TED Talks on how to end the world?”

“Miss Smith,” said Palace York, whom Sophia had privately dubbed ‘Pseudo-Putin’ for his commanding presence, interrupting her spiraling thoughts, “it seems we’ll be traveling with the Professor for a while. Isn’t that great?” His tone was filled with genuine, albeit misplaced, enthusiasm.

Sophia forced a smile, her jaw clenched. “Oh, absolutely thrilling. Can’t wait.”

Z, continuing his act of genteel charm, casually approached the car’s window, tapping the glass lightly as he leaned in to catch her eye. “May I?”

Sophia hesitated. She recognized that look—it always preceded Z doing something utterly unpredictable.

“Sure, why not?” she replied, unlocking the door with a sense of inevitable doom.

Z slid into the passenger seat with the kind of elegance one would expect from royalty arriving at a gala. Each movement was calm, measured, and utterly infuriating.

“Comfortable?” Sophia asked, her voice laced with sarcasm.

“Quite,” he replied smoothly, a glint of amusement in his eyes. He settled back and glanced over his shoulder at the rest of the group. “The rest of you can take the other vehicle. I’ll keep Miss Smith company.”

“What?!” Sophia exclaimed.

Before she could argue further, York nodded in agreement. “Good idea. It's better to have a clear distribution. Professor, if you notice anything unusual, let us know right away.”

Sophia felt her stomach drop.

Z's smile widened, his teeth flashing in the dimming light. “Of course. I’ll be vigilant.”

The Journey Begins

Sophia gripped the steering wheel like it was a lifeline—which it might very well be. Her mind raced as they set off, her car leading the way with York and his team trailing closely behind.

“You didn’t answer my question,” Sophia muttered, eyes fixed on the road ahead.

“Which question?” Z asked, his voice a soft rumble designed to get under her skin.

“What are you doing here?”

Z tilted his head, feigning consideration of her words. “You make it sound like I don't belong. Rest assured, Sophia, I have every right to be where I please.”

“That’s not an answer,” she shot back, frustration bubbling within.

“Very well,” he said, reclining slightly, his tone turning more serious. “You’re headed to the molecular base, correct?”

Sophia tensed. “And if I am?”

His smirk grew as he enjoyed her discomfort. “I’m merely curious to see their reaction when they discover what you’re carrying.”

Her hands tightened around the wheel. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Z chuckled softly, his fingers tapping a steady rhythm on the car door. “Oh, but you do. The real question is, do they?”

A Suspicious Stop

The convoy reached a dilapidated checkpoint a few miles from the molecular base. The once pristine road was now cracked and overgrown, with rusted signs warning of dangers ahead.

York signaled for them to stop, and both vehicles came to a halt. He approached Sophia’s car, leaning down to speak through the open window.

“This area used to be a military outpost,” he explained. “It’s best if we proceed on foot from here. The road ahead might be blocked, and we don’t want to risk the vehicles.”

Sophia looked over at Z, expecting him to protest, but he simply smiled and gestured for her to exit the car.

“After you,” he said smoothly.

Sophia groaned inwardly but complied, grabbing her bag and stepping out into the dusty dusk.

Unwelcome Discoveries

As the group moved forward, the oppressive silence of the wasteland enveloped them. The checkpoint loomed ahead, its gates twisted and broken, like the maw of some great beast.

Sophia couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched. Her eyes darted to Z, who seemed entirely at ease, as if he were on a peaceful walk through a park.

“Professor,” York called out, “do you know anything about this area?”

Z stopped, turning to face him with a faint smile. “Only that it’s seen better days.”

“Helpful,” Sophia muttered under her breath.

As they passed through the gates, a low growl echoed from the shadows. The group froze, their weapons at the ready.

Sophia’s heart pounded in her chest. She glanced at Z, who appeared... intrigued.

“Fascinating,” he murmured, his eyes gleaming with anticipation.

Before anyone could act, a hulking figure emerged from the darkness—a mutated beast that looked like it had stepped straight out of a nightmare. Its flesh was mottled and decayed, its eyes glowing an unnatural green.

The group braced for a fight, but Z calmly stepped forward, his posture unwavering.

“Stand back,” he said, his voice carrying a quiet authority that even Sophia found hard to ignore.

The creature snarled, its claws scraping the pavement. But as it charged, Z raised a single hand.

“Sit.”

To everyone’s amazement, the beast froze mid-charge. It hesitated, then slumped to the ground, its head bowed as if waiting for commands.

Sophia’s jaw dropped. “What on earth?”

Z turned to her, his smile enigmatic. “I told you, Sophia. I have a way with... family.”

Her blood ran cold.
