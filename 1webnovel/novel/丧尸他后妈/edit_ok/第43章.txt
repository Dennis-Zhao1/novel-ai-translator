Z watched as Jack Andrews and Lisa Carter left the room, a hint of mockery and indifference flickering in his eyes, the corners of his mouth curling into a disdainful smirk. Soon, the spacious conference room was left with just him and Sophia Smith.

Sophia rested her forehead against the table, her cheeks tinged with a faint blush. Z's earlier casual gesture had left her feeling both embarrassed and frustrated. While others were distracted, Z had quickly restrained his actions, yet she felt her emotions were like a simmering flame, waiting to burst forth.

“Z!” she hissed under her breath, turning her face to him with displeasure. But before she could finish her sentence, he silenced her with a sudden, unexpected kiss.

She froze, unable to react in time as he gently leaned her back onto the conference table. His hand rested on the edge, his gaze lowered, a shadowy emotion flickering across his face.

“Sophia…” His voice was low and hoarse, tinged with a deep-seated vulnerability. “Stop running away.”

Instinctively, Sophia pushed against his chest, her eyes simmering with a mix of anger and confusion. “You’re being too reckless! How can you do this in a place like this…”

Her words were laced with reproach, yet they couldn’t quite hide the complexity of her feelings. Even she couldn’t decipher whether it was anger or some hidden anticipation.

Z chuckled softly, as if he had heard an amusing joke. He gently wrapped his arm around her waist, pulling her closer until their foreheads touched. His voice was a low, gravelly whisper. “Reckless? Maybe.”

“You…” She opened her mouth to retort but was caught by the flicker of anxiety and uncertainty in his deep-set eyes.

Sophia was taken aback.

The expression on Z's face was one she had never seen before, a blend of obsession, pain, and a buried fear. He took a deep breath, looking down at her as he murmured, “Sophia, I… I always feel like something bad is going to happen.”

There was a note of helplessness in his tone, completely at odds with the confident and cold scientist she was used to.

Silence enveloped them. Sophia bit her lip and slowly reached out to grasp his arm, her voice softening. “Are you overthinking this? Everything’s going to be okay.”

But Z didn’t respond; he simply lowered his head and inhaled the scent of her hair. Then, suddenly, he spoke in a quiet voice, “Meeting you has turned my world upside down.”

Sophia blinked in surprise. “What?”

He lifted his gaze, his eyes swirling with complexity. “I’m scared. Scared that you’ll leave me.”

Sophia froze. It was the first time she had ever heard such a blunt confession from Z. His voice was low and steady, yet it felt like a stab to her heart. Her hand slid down slowly, wanting to speak, but he pressed down on her shoulder, rendering her immobile.

“Sophia,” he whispered, almost like a secret, “I want you to stay with me forever. Even if I… am no longer myself.”

“Z…” She hadn’t finished her thought when his palm brushed against her cheek. The warmth was more intense than usual, lacking the usual chill.

She closed her eyes slightly, feeling his hand gently rest on her shoulder, pulling her into a tight embrace, as if he were trying to meld her into his very being.

“Don’t say anything.” Sophia covered his mouth with her hand, her voice trembling slightly, barely audible.

Z remained silent. He looked down at her, his gaze filled with complicated emotions. Then, he slowly released his grip but held her a bit tighter.

Outside the conference room, the daylight began to fade.

The two of them remained in silent embrace, neither of them uttering another word. In this moment, they were both grappling with the fears and desires that lay deep within their hearts.
