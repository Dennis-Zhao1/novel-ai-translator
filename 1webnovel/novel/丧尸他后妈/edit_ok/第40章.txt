"I'm not giving anyone a medal," Zach quickly denied as the car rolled to a stop. They had arrived at the inspection site for the day.

Charlie was the first to step out, intending to open the door for Zach, but by the time he reached it, Zach had already disappeared from sight.

"Hmm?" Charlie paused, and beside him, his younger sister, Lily, tugged on his sleeve, pointing toward the wall. Charlie followed her gaze and chuckled, tousling her hair. "Good eye, Lily."

Lily spoke earnestly, "Charlie, I'm not trying to be mean, but if you're nearsighted, you should really get glasses. Pretending won't make your eyesight better."

A hint of embarrassment flickered across Charlie's face. He took her hand and led her toward Zach, whispering, "I just feel like I look goofy in glasses."

"You don't look goofy," Lily reassured, glancing at him before turning her attention to where Zach stood. "Though maybe not as sharp as Zach does, you still look fine."

Charlie followed her gaze to see Zach in front of a large gate, soldiers in protective gear and masks blocking his path, their expressions questioning.

Charlie nodded slightly, giving the soldiers a silent go-ahead. They quickly moved aside and opened the gate.

Zach didn't acknowledge them, bypassing any small talk as he walked straight ahead. His tall figure was striking even among the burly soldiers, though his lean frame gave an impression of fragility rather than strength.

However, Charlie quickly dismissed any doubts. Zach's demeanor and actions spoke volumes about his professionalism. Although this wasn't a disaster zone, there were significant risks involved, albeit somewhat controlled.

Once inside the inspection area, Zach moved independently, his long strides carrying him through the corridors. He seemed utterly unconcerned about the soldiers following him or the potential threat of zombies. It almost seemed like he was deliberately trying to lose them, testing their patience.

"Deputy Governor, this Dr. Harper is too full of himself. Doesn't he worry we might actually leave him behind? Is he here to help or hinder us?" grumbled a tall man with a scruffy beard.

Charlie raised an eyebrow, watching as Zach suddenly halted in front of an old factory. Zach tilted his head to inspect it, and from a distance, the lens of his rimless glasses caught a flash of light.

Just then, the rusty iron door of the factory creaked open. A horde of zombies shuffled out from the shadows, their faces bloody and skin hanging loose, emitting a stench that made Charlie and the others queasy just by approaching. Yet Zach stood there, seemingly unfazed by the grotesque sight.

"Good boy," Zach murmured as he adjusted his glasses, stepping back to lean against the wall. The rain pattered down on his black umbrella, the droplets sliding off like a slow clock ticking away.

This was indeed a form of timing. In his mind, Zach counted to twenty, and after that, a familiar figure emerged behind the horde—a woman, striking in her presence.

"Miss Taylor?!" Charlie gasped, staring at the woman who stood behind the zombies. Her eyes glowed with an eerie green light. In the rain, she wielded a slender sword in one hand and a gun in the other, her expression emotionless as she prepared to confront the zombies.

"What a persistent spirit," Lily, who had been hiding behind Charlie in fear, peeked out upon hearing Miss Taylor's name. Seeing it was indeed her, she couldn't help but express her astonishment.

Though Charlie wasn't a fan of Miss Taylor, her sudden appearance here, fighting zombies, felt surreal. He was aware of the zombies' existence, but his purpose today was merely to assess Zach's capabilities and see if he could be of use to them.

Miss Taylor's unexpected appearance threw a wrench in his plans, and he was puzzled about how she had discovered this operation.

Indeed, when circumstances required toughness, one had to be tough; it seemed he hadn’t fully grasped his father's teachings.

Charlie handed Lily over to the soldiers behind them and drew his gun, tossing aside his umbrella as he rushed forward to Zach’s side. "Dr. Harper, you should return to the main group. I’ll handle this…”

Before he could finish, Zach shot him a look that silenced him. No one liked to be bossed around while working. Zach took three steps forward, creating distance between them, raising his gun and squinting at Miss Taylor in the distance. "Her sudden appearance is suspicious, and her behavior is odd. She must have been infected with a special virus. It’s better to eliminate her first."

Charlie was momentarily taken aback by this statement but quickly regained his composure, rushing to stop him. "Is that really a good idea? After all, Miss Taylor is a guest, and Mr. Gordon is responsible for her safety. If she dies…”

"Quiet," Zach interrupted coldly, glaring at Charlie. Since his assistant left, his demeanor had shifted dramatically—less warmth, more coldness and disdain. His eyes glinted with a hint of madness, daring Charlie to challenge him.

Charlie hesitated, tightening his grip on the gun, visibly torn.

Zach didn’t regard him as a threat at all. With one hand, he pulled the trigger, the bullet slicing through the rain towards Miss Taylor, taking down four zombies along the way before hitting her in the chest.

Miss Taylor's body froze, her expression blanking out for a moment, her weapon slipping from her grasp as she collapsed backward.

Charlie watched in shock and immediately dashed forward. Although his speed couldn’t match Zach’s, he was still impressively quick for an ordinary person. Even Zach had to acknowledge his precise marksmanship and rapid firing. Clearing the zombies in front of him with a few well-placed shots, he grabbed Miss Taylor, whose features were becoming indistinct in the mud, and struggled back through the downpour.

The soldiers quickly drew their weapons and began to assist, but Zach coldly observed the individuals who were disrupting his plans, feeling a surge of irritation. He raised his gun slightly, aiming at Charlie. From this angle, he could shoot through Charlie’s heart and also finish Miss Taylor off.

Though the bullets were specially designed, the rain and the fact he’d already taken down four zombies made Zach uncertain whether Miss Taylor would even survive. He hesitated for about three seconds with his finger on the trigger before decisively pulling it again.

"Bang—"

Another gunshot rang out, and the bluish bullet sped through the air. Lily, watching from a safe distance, saw it and, in a moment of panic, rushed into the horde of zombies, shouting "Charlie, watch out!" She lunged toward Charlie, successfully diverting the bullet, but…

The bullet struck her instead.

Charlie stood frozen, staring at Lily, who collapsed onto him, warm blood trickling down his face. His usually composed features twisted into a mask of horror. He glanced at Miss Taylor, still breathing in his arms, then at his sister, who had thrown herself in harm’s way for him. For the first time, he truly felt the weight of regret.

"Lily…" he choked, holding her tightly, his eyes burning as he looked down at her. Rain washed the blood from his face, mingling with the warm scent of her blood. His eyes overflowed with tears, indistinguishable from the rain.

The soldiers had cleared the zombies, surrounding Charlie as they vigilantly scanned their surroundings for further threats. Charlie remained rooted in place, clutching Lily, while Miss Taylor lay abandoned on the ground, the scene heavy with despair.

Zach, the cause of it all, felt no remorse. He stood there, his mind racing as he mentally listed the series of issues he would need to address next, devising dozens of potential solutions. His eyes were dark and inscrutable, revealing nothing of his thoughts.

At that moment, an unexpected figure broke the stillness, disrupting the frozen moment.

"What happened?" Ashley hurried over with her gun in hand. She took in the bloodied Lily and Charlie, then glanced at the seemingly dazed soldiers and urged, "What are you all standing around for? Hurry up and get her back to the base!"

Charlie's gaze snapped back to reality, his expression toward Ashley complex. His thoughts had been chaotic, leaving him feeling strange and vulnerable.

Ashley nodded at him, suppressing her discomfort, before turning to Zach. Charlie regained his composure and cast a glance at Zach, his mind clouded with suspicion, though he decided not to voice it immediately. After all, one needed evidence before making accusations—he would wait until the bullet was extracted to gather proof.

Zach appeared unfazed. In fact, he had already severed all potential ties that could link him to the incident, especially regarding the bullets.

Those were his specially crafted guns and bullets. Upon contact with human flesh, the bullets dissolved like medication, ensuring that by the time Charlie returned to extract the bullet from Lily, it would vanish without a trace, leaving behind only severe aftereffects.

Thus, even if Miss Taylor survived, her wakefulness wouldn’t be much better than death.

It was a pity for Lily, but there was nothing to be done; she had recklessly rushed into danger, after all.

"Are you alright?" Ashley asked, shielding her eyes from the rain, frowning as she looked at Zach, who was drenched. "Why aren't you using your umbrella?"

Zach slowly raised the neglected umbrella above her head, coolly responding, "Aren’t you without one as well?" He grasped her wrist and, alongside the others, headed back to the base. He quietly murmured, "Did you see that muddy figure being carried? That’s Miss Taylor. Even if she doesn’t die this time, she won’t pose any threat to you anymore." He smirked, his white, neat teeth glinting coldly.

Ashley couldn’t help but shiver, casting a glance at the figure that was unrecognizable, she asked in a hushed tone, "Then how did Lily get hurt?"

"Her own doing," Zach replied, his expression unyielding. "Someone ambushed Charlie, and she jumped in front of the bullet. Truly foolish."

Ashley paused, feeling a surge of admiration for the young girl. "She’s not foolish; she’s kind."

"I don’t want that kind of kindness leading to a loss of life to be present in you," Zach replied coldly, devoid of any humor.

Ashley regarded his emotionless face, falling into silence for a moment before saying, "If it were you and me in that situation, I would have done the same for you."

"…" Zach abruptly stopped, looking down at her, his lips pressed together. He replied flatly, "Your hypothetical doesn’t hold because I would never let such a situation arise."

Ashley stepped forward, smiling as she said, "No one can predict exactly what will happen tomorrow. You surely didn’t anticipate doing a good deed today, right? Don’t speak in absolutes; just do your best and don’t leave regrets behind."

As they conversed, they had already returned to the base. The news of Lily’s injury reached Mr. Collins, and without hesitation, he rushed to the base, coincidentally encountering Charlie and the others.

Without a word, Mr. Collins snatched Lily from Charlie’s arms and rushed toward the medical center, leaving Charlie standing there, guilt-ridden, his head bowed. His damp bangs obscured his eyes, and he appeared utterly despondent.

Mr. Gordon was captivated by the muddy figure brought in by the soldier. He looked up in confusion, as if asking, "What the hell… who is this?"

Zach and Ashley witnessed the entire scene unfold. Ashley felt a tangle of emotions, a vague sense that something was amiss, but she couldn’t pinpoint what. Her instinct seemed to be conveying something, but she resisted it.

Once everyone had left, Zach and Ashley made their way toward their quarters. Neither had sustained injuries, so they didn’t need to visit the medical center—just a bath and a change of clothes would suffice.

Walking side by side in silence, Zach’s quietness ended as he entered the bathroom.

"I don’t believe in doing things halfway," he remarked. "When I need to do my best, it means I’ve already made an irreparable mistake. Let’s hope I don’t reach that point."

Many of Zach’s words sounded like riddles to Ashley. If she wanted to understand, she’d have to guess and ponder. This moment was no different. Regardless of whether she comprehended his meaning, she recognized that her mindset had shifted.

Humans truly are selfish. When they dislike someone, their good deeds appear to be bad, and when they like them, even their misdeeds seem forgivable.

People are always quick to judge others while excusing themselves, trapped in this vicious cycle.

Zach stepped into the bathroom first. Ashley wouldn’t initiate a shared bath with him, so she remained outside, patiently waiting.

Zach peeked through the crack of the bathroom door, watching her delicate silhouette for a couple of seconds before shutting the door.

It’s alright, he thought; there’s plenty of time for him to waste on her.
