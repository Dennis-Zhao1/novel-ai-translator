Sophia Smith only regained her senses when she found herself ushered into the cockpit of the large mech. She stood dazed at the window, gazing out at the vast blue sky, then glanced over at Ethan, who remained unconscious on the operating table. He lay there peacefully, a cozy blanket draped over him, looking far more harmless in his slumber than when he was awake.

Letting out a sigh of relief, Sophia wiped the cold sweat from her forehead, rubbing her sore hands where they had been tightly gripping the edge of the table. She returned to his side, half-sitting beside him, contemplating whether to try waking him up when a familiar mechanical voice broke the silence: "Ma'am, please restrain him."

Sophia turned, astonished, looking around. "What?"

"There's a drawer under the operating table containing the items you need," the mechanical voice explained.

Following the instructions, she opened the drawer and indeed discovered a collection of medical tape and other supplies that could securely bind someone to the operating table.

"…What does this mean?" she furrowed her brow and asked.

The voice replied, "Mr. Ethan instructed that if his condition were to reach a state similar to today’s, he should be restrained on the operating table and not allowed to leave until he regains his sanity."

Sophia pulled out the supplies. "When did he tell you this?" After a brief pause, she added, "Do you have a name? How should I address you?"

The mechanical voice hesitated before responding, "All information is programmed by Mr. Ethan. There is no corresponding answer for your second question within my programming."

"Okay…" Sophia stood, looking down at Ethan, a wave of unease washing over her. She absentmindedly said, "Then I'll just call you Robo."

"Understood. Name recorded."

Sophia let out a small chuckle as she adjusted Ethan's position, straightening his slightly disheveled shirt collar. While doing this, she couldn't help but brush her fingers across his face.

She pushed aside the messy strands of his hair, taking in his refined features—the delicate arch of his brows, the smoothness of his lips—and sighed deeply.

It seemed she could never be a good person; the world was filled with treachery, and not everyone harbored love and peace like she had hoped. The people she had encountered lacked even the most basic moral compass. Why should she feel guilt towards them? The world would never improve, and if it continued to worsen, it wouldn’t matter to her as long as the people she cared about were safe.

Just as she was lost in thought, the four corners of the operating table suddenly popped up, securing Ethan's wrists and ankles. It was clear that Robo was behind this.

"Ma'am, Mr. Ethan is about to awaken. Please step back. Based on my calculations, a distance of four meters is deemed safe."

Sophia took a step back, feeling both worried and curious. "Will I get hurt if I stay?" she softly asked, but there was no need for Robo to respond, as Ethan's eyes fluttered open.

His dark irises glimmered with a faint red glow, and his lips were pressed together in a way that looked extremely sensual. He gazed blankly upwards, his expression devoid of any emotion—no fear or malice, not even a hint of recognition.

"Ma'am, please move back."

The reminder echoed, but Sophia felt an unshakeable urge to stay by his side. How could he possibly be powerful enough to harm her? Even if the controller had released some sort of virus, it wouldn’t enhance him; it would more likely be destructive.

"What else did he tell you? No, what did he write in your programming? Is there a way to alleviate his symptoms?" Sophia observed Ethan’s stillness, his eyes occasionally blinking without any further movement.

Robo paused, likely searching through its data. After a moment, it replied, "The operating room is three meters behind the white door. Based on previous progress, Mr. Ethan's developed alleviating agent is still incomplete."

They had already researched it? Sophia furrowed her brow and took a few steps back, just as Ethan began to struggle, his movements shifting from feeble attempts to an almost dissociated thrashing.

She watched helplessly as the restraints dug into his wrists, turning them red, and instinctively looked away.

"Do we just wait like this?" she wondered aloud, unsure if she was asking him or herself. After a moment of contemplation, she returned to his side, forcing herself to maintain calm as she locked eyes with him. "Don't move. Look at me. Do you know who I am?"

Ethan slowly ceased his movements, directing his gaze towards her. His bangs fell over his eyes, and despite the eerie glow of his red pupils, his handsomeness remained undeniable. Sophia knew she shouldn’t be thinking about how attractive he looked at that moment, but… he was undeniably captivating.

"Sophia," Ethan spoke, his deep voice accompanied by the faintest hint of a smile.

The moment she heard her name, Sophia felt tears welling up in her eyes.

"At least you have a conscience," she said, gently ruffling his hair. He didn’t seem bothered by it at all; in fact, he responded with an odd softness, "Sophia, help me get this off."

He glanced at the restraints around his wrists and ankles.

Sophia instinctively nodded, about to bend down to look for a switch when Robo interjected, "No!"

Sophia froze. "Why not?"

"Those are sensory devices. If Mr. Ethan's bodily indicators meet the parameters he previously set, the system will automatically release. Otherwise…" Before Robo could finish, Sophia felt a cold gust of wind behind her. Ethan’s familiar scent surged into her senses, and then she felt his teeth sink into her neck with a fierce, unrelenting grip.

Sophia cried out in pain, stumbling back. But he, in his frenzy, seemed completely unaware of what he was doing. Even as she quickly pulled away, he had bitten down hard enough to draw blood.

Warm blood trickled down her neck, staining her white protective suit. She awkwardly half-knelt on the ground, taking a moment to steady her breathing, her arms bracing against the floor as she stared at Ethan, her expression more complex than his.

Ethan had blood at the corners of his mouth. He even wickedly licked his lips, and Sophia averted her gaze in exasperation, standing up and heading towards the operating room, ignoring him as if being bitten wasn’t a big deal.

"Where can I find a change of clothes? There should be medicine and bandages in the operating room, right? Do I need any vaccines? Getting bitten by a cat could give you rabies," she muttered, feeling slightly defeated.

Robo replied seriously, "No need. Your body has the vaccine injected by Mr. Ethan."

"…" Truly, he had thought of everything. But when had he done all this?

Sophia opened the door to the operating room, gently pressing against her neck wound as she scanned the small space for bandages and ointment. Sitting on a small round chair in front of the mirror, she carefully treated her wound while casually asking, "What can I do for him now? I can’t just ignore him like this. Where are we headed? Doesn’t this flying consume fuel?"

"…Solar energy."

Oh, right. Solar energy was predicted to become the primary fuel of the future world a long time ago.

"So what can I do?"

"If you must do something, share stories about your relationship. It might assist in his recovery on a conscious level."

…Share stories about their relationship? They didn’t exactly have a treasure trove of fond memories. Their time together had mostly revolved around mundane tasks and—

"Am I supposed to narrate our adventures?" Sophia muttered, her mouth twitching.

Robo, being a machine, heard her clearly and dutifully responded, "According to scientific research, engaging in storytelling can be effective in releasing emotions."

…No wonder Ethan had created such a gadget; it mirrored his temperament to a tee.

Sophia finished binding her wound, glancing down at her bloodstained protective suit, but before she could ask, Robo said, "To answer your initial question, clean clothes are in the closet of the operating room."

Though small, the operating room was fully equipped. Sophia walked over to the closet, pulling open the door to find a pristine white lab coat, neatly paired with a button-up shirt and trousers, with a simple pair of shoes, underwear, and socks beneath.

Quietly, she pulled out a fresh set of clothes, slipping off her outer layer and donning Ethan's oversized shirt, then throwing on the lab coat, ready for a theatrical performance.

She awkwardly rolled up the sleeves, kicked off her shoes, and padded barefoot out of the operating room. The plush carpet tickled her soles, and as soon as she emerged, she saw Ethan desperately trying to sit up, his wrists and ankles red and chafed from the restraints.

"Enough!" Sophia could no longer hold back. She rushed over and firmly commanded, "Stop!"

Ethan seemed taken aback by her sudden fierceness, stopping his movements instinctively, looking at her with a bewildered expression—as if he didn’t recognize her.

Sophia forced a smile, though it was strained. "What’s with that look? Trying to make me feel guilty? Do you not know who I am? Well, then I’ll just make sure you remember." She pressed against his chest, pushing him back onto the operating table. The narrow bed had no space for another person, so she straddled him at the waist.

With her head lowered, she spoke softly, a gentle smile playing on her lips, "I’ve poured all my courage into caring for you, so you have to be okay. If anything happens to you, I won’t be able to go on." Her eyes misted, and after saying this, she threw herself into his embrace, not caring if he bit her again. But he didn’t.

Ethan calmed down, lying still beneath her. Her soft skin pressed against him, and the occasional brushing of her long lashes along his neck, coupled with her warm breath, gradually soothed his racing heart.

The word "endure," which had been echoing in his mind, resurfaced. He closed his eyes, attempting to steady his breathing. Though the tumultuous waves within him made his fists clench so tightly that his fingertips dug into his palms, he had to hold on. If he couldn’t, he might do something regrettable beyond imagination.

Suddenly, the restraints on the operating table retracted completely. Sophia noticed and immediately sat up, her shoulder-length hair having grown significantly, with a few strands brushing against Ethan's lips.

Ethan opened his eyes. Though weary, the bloodshot gaze was devoid of the strange red glow, indicating that his sanity had temporarily returned.

"Sophia." When he spoke her name this time, she could feel her heart tightening in her chest.

"You’re awake?" Sophia exclaimed, cradling his face, her words tumbling out in excitement, "Yes, you seem awake now, but how long can you hold on? Can you get off this bed? What if you lose control again? What will I do if you bite me to death?"

Ethan's gaze drifted to the wound on her neck, and he moved his lips, saying, "I won't."

"Yes, you will." Sophia felt tears brimming in her eyes, "You just…"

"There won't be a second time," he emphasized, a hint of self-loathing slipping through his expression.

Sophia's heart sank. She quickly countered, "Even if you did, I wouldn’t mind."

Ethan simply looked at her with a faint skepticism, as if he didn't believe her words.

Anxiousness welled up in her, her voice thick with pleading and emotion: "I mean it." She caressed his face, "I genuinely care for you. Please get better. This is the most important thing I need to do while I’m alive."

Ethan paused for a moment, then suddenly smiled, wrapping his arms around her waist and pulling her closer, kissing her lips as he whispered against them, "If I go mad again, just distract me with your stories."

"…Wha—why?"

"Because then I won’t have the heart to lose my mind."

"…"

"I'll only be thinking about being with you…" Before he could finish, Robo interjected, "Mr. Ethan, please hurry. While your body is still normal, proceed to the operating room to complete the final steps of the temporary drug."

"…" Ethan clenched his fist, gritting his teeth in frustration, vowing that once this was all over, he would turn it into scrap.
