As soon as they stepped out of the molecular range, the surrounding environment and weather improved slightly. Even though the apocalypse had turned survival into a historical issue, the sight of the sky gradually turning blue still lifted Sophia's spirits a bit.

Sophia Smith stood idly with her arms crossed, waiting for Ethan. Every once in a while, she glanced around to see if he was back yet. On her seventh glance, she spotted Ivy walking towards her, her brow furrowing slightly in response.

"Sophia," Ivy said casually, flashing her a smile. Sophia returned a half-hearted smile that barely lifted the corners of her mouth before her expression went back to neutral, causing an awkward tension to linger between them.

The memory of how Ivy had pressured Owen into that situation last night made it impossible for Sophia to treat her nicely, let alone maintain even a pretense of harmony. If it hadn't been for Ivy's sudden departure from Quantum, the plot might have progressed further, and by now, Ivy could have had most of Quantum's real power in her grasp. Meanwhile, poor Ben would have been driven to madness and a dark transformation by both Ivy and Owen's antics.

As the original female protagonist, Ivy likely viewed her "true love" with Owen as something poignant and beautiful. Though she might have had a plethora of affections, each one was probably genuine, as is often the case with heroines in romance novels—an almost scientific impossibility of being so open-hearted.

Even though Ivy had come to occupy the role of the mistress, it was also true that, after Owen’s betrayal, Ben had done some truly foolish things in the heat of the moment—this was simply a narrative necessity. For instance, there had been a time when Ben contemplated harming Ivy by intentionally leading zombies to her, putting her life in danger.

However, it must be said that Ben was still Ben. In the original story, Sophia Smith never did anything truly earth-shattering or villainous. Sooner or later, she was worn down to exhaustion by Ivy and Owen, losing faith in herself. In a moment of desperation, she had wanted to expose Owen and Ivy's plans to Mr. Johnson, but when the opportunity arose, her heart wavered due to Owen—by the time she steeled herself, it was already too late.

Ivy caught wind of Ben’s intentions, and while she was busy conquering the world, she handed the task of dealing with Ben over to the competent Governor Charles of the harem. Charles fulfilled the queen's mission and injected Ben with the H+ virus. After becoming a zombie, she was promptly expelled from Quantum by her righteous father. In the end… well, it was best not to dwell on that.

Ivy had no idea that in just a short time, Sophia Smith had thought through all of this. She also couldn’t know that while Sophia appeared the same on the outside, she had already undergone a significant internal transformation.

Noticing Sophia's cold demeanor, Ivy decided against pretending to be friendly and instead scrutinized her expression, asking indirectly, "Sophia, you and the professor were in the car all night last night. What exactly did you… do?"

Sophia looked at her, puzzled. "Why would I tell you?"

"… Aren't we friends?" Ivy feigned ignorance.

Sophia couldn’t help but chuckle, exasperated. "At this point, you still want to pretend? Do you really think I’m that naive?"

Ivy’s eyes sparkled mischievously. "Of course, I always outlast you, no matter what."

"And what exactly are those aspects where you outlast me? Because I honestly don’t remember. Is my poor memory making me seem too magnanimous? Sorry, but I’m not angry at all," Sophia replied earnestly.

Ivy shifted the topic. "I didn’t come here to argue. I won’t leave because of what happened last night. You still have to go back to Quantum. I promised I would separate from Owen, and I will. You don’t need to doubt the truth of that."

"I’ve never liked used goods," Sophia stated coolly. "Besides, the governor of Quantum is my father. Whether or not I go back, and how I go back, I can communicate directly with him. Owen may be capable, but if he weren’t my fiancé, he’d be nothing in Quantum."

"How fortunate that he is still your fiancé," Ivy replied flatly.

Sophia shook her head. "No, from the moment he fell for you, he ceased to be."

Ivy stared at her in disbelief. "I don’t believe it. You really don’t like him anymore? You grew up together and went through so much. How could you just stop liking him like that?"

Sophia was at a loss for how to explain, so she resorted to a catch-all excuse. "Did you forget the question you opened with?"

Ivy paused, confused. "… What?"

"Because of the professor," Sophia said seriously. "Isn’t that obvious? Didn’t you ask what we did in the car last night? We did what we were supposed to do. Are you satisfied with that answer?"

Ivy was utterly shocked. "You… Sophia, how did you become like this? You weren’t like this before! You’re not married yet; how can you… no, this isn’t right! I have to report this to the governor!"

As she turned to leave, she was suddenly blocked by someone. Her gaze traveled up from the white shirt to find Ethan, whose dark eyes, partially obscured by bangs, looked down at her with a mix of sarcasm and calm. His voice was deep and melodic, yet carried an ominous weight. "Miss Ivy, where are you in such a hurry to go?"

Ivy's face stiffened for a moment before she quickly smiled. "Oh, it’s nothing. I just wanted to inform everyone to prepare for departure. It’s getting late; if we don’t leave now, we won’t make it to the next town before dark."

"Is that so?" Ethan's lips curved into a regretful smile. "That’s too bad; I was hoping you could join us for the show."

Sophia was taken aback, glancing at Ethan with surprise, unsure of what he was up to. Ethan reassured her with a look, and though she was skeptical, she didn’t argue.

Ivy hesitated, gazing at Ethan. "A show? In a place like this, in this era, where would there even be a show?"

Ethan slowly raised his wrist and casually adjusted his watch, pressing a hidden silver button embedded in the metallic strap. The device on the other side suddenly snapped a series of photos of Ivy’s upturned face, the faint blue flash illuminating her eyes in a strange green hue. For a moment, her eyes flickered, as if she had lost consciousness, standing stiffly in place.

"Come with us," Ethan said coolly, taking a step toward Sophia. Ivy followed him like a puppet, her limbs rigid and her expression blank.

"What’s going on?" Sophia asked in bewilderment.

Ethan took her hand and leaned in closer, his voice low and secretive. "You’ll find out soon enough. I had a hunch this would come in handy."

Sophia felt a shiver run down her spine as she followed Ethan into a secluded patch of woods. Once they were free from the toxic soil of the molecular range, the trees here were a bit lusher, providing at least some cover from prying eyes.

Ethan, filled with anticipation, pulled her closer, placing his hands on her shoulders and gazing into her eyes. "We can’t find good test subjects around here right now. Your abilities are unique and do not react strongly on solids, so you’ll be experimenting on her." He snapped his fingers, and the dazed Ivy took a step forward, as if compelled by an unseen force.

Sophia gaped at Ivy, who now resembled a robot. "What happened to her? When did you do this…?"

Remembering the last time he had unwittingly caused trouble, Ethan hesitated to answer, so he dodged the question. "She has the latest virus I developed inside her. Just conduct your experiments on her; she won't die." As if to reassure her, he pulled out a surgical knife from who knows where and plunged it into Ivy's abdomen without hesitation. Ivy didn’t even blink.

Sophia stared in disbelief at the unblemished skin of Ivy's stomach. "… She’s not bleeding?"

"She’s like a host of the H+ virus now, dependent on her nervous system. She only gains consciousness and agency under certain conditions, and to achieve that effect…" Ethan lifted his chin, "you’ll need my help."

Sophia bit her lip, looking uncertainly at him. "She’s staring right at me; I…"

"Just have her close her eyes," Ethan instructed, and Ivy immediately complied.

Sophia was left speechless. Ethan continued, "Still not working? Then cover her face." He pulled out a checkered handkerchief from his shirt pocket and covered Ivy's eyes. "There, now you can treat her like a zombie."

Sophia took a deep breath, trying to convince herself that Ivy was just a zombie. She asked hesitantly, "If I use my powers on her, she really won’t be harmed?"

Who knew? Although the new virus was an upgraded version of H+, he hadn’t yet had a chance to review the results of those experiments. He thought it would be a good opportunity to see; he really had no idea if Ivy would end up revealing his actions afterward.

"Of course," Ethan assured her with utmost seriousness.

Sophia sighed in relief. "Then that’s good." She smiled and placed her hand on Ivy's shoulder, trying to recall the method Ethan had taught her last night, channeling her electric energy into her palm. Sweat began to bead on her forehead as she concentrated, clearly struggling.

Ethan rested his chin on his hand, watching her without blinking. As the wind blew through his bangs, his slanted eyes narrowed slightly, and suddenly, he said, "Wait."

Sophia snapped out of her focus, panting slightly as she looked at him. "What’s wrong?"

Ethan used his lab coat sleeve to wipe the sweat from her forehead and pulled out a small silver handgun from his back pocket. "Try this. Direct contact with a zombie increases the risk; you’re still inexperienced, so it’s better to keep your distance."

… Play from a distance? Did he think this was a video game? What’s your role, then? Healer? DPS? No, wait, you’re the boss.

Sophia took the handgun and, under Ethan's guidance, loaded a bullet into it. She once again attempted to channel the energy she felt into her palm and into the gun. After having experienced it once, her nervous system seemed to have saved the memory, making this second attempt much easier. She felt a tingling sensation in her hand and inadvertently squeezed the trigger. The bullet shot straight through Ivy’s shoulder and struck the tree behind her. Ivy's body jolted, and she collapsed backward, while the tree that was hit fell with a crash, splitting from the ground up. Its dry leaves ignited, sending up plumes of black smoke.

Sophia’s heart raced as she realized she had unleashed such destructive power. Watching Ivy lying on the ground, completely unresponsive, she noted that while there was no blood from her shoulder, Ivy had closed her eyes and lay motionless.

"What happened to her?" Sophia gripped the gun tightly, looking at Ethan. "She’s not dead, is she?"

Ethan ran his long finger along his lips, adjusting his glasses. "She’s not dead." Probably.
