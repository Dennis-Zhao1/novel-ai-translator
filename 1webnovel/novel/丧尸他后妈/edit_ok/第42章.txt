"What's happening?" Alex was startled by the news, his face instantly tightening with concern. He stood up, ready to bolt, but paused after a few steps, glancing back at Dr. Smith with a mix of embarrassment and helplessness. “Dr. Smith, if it’s not too urgent, could you…”

“No,” Dr. Smith cut him off, her voice firm. “According to my calculations, these mutated creatures move at roughly 20 feet per second. With that kind of speed and force, do you really think you can fend them off with old tactics? Plus, their mutation rate means as soon as you handle one wave, another is right behind.”

She smirked slightly, her glasses catching the light as she leaned back, exuding calm confidence.

Alex was momentarily stunned, struggling to wrap his head around her technical explanation. Sam looked equally puzzled, her eyes fixed on Dr. Smith, filled with confusion.

Dr. Smith sighed, dialing down the complexity. “To put it simply, every second, a creature as heavy as Deputy Governor Alex is going to lunge at your team, knocking them down. Got it now?”

This time, everyone except James and Taylor nodded in understanding. Dr. Smith shot James a glance, her eyes carrying a hint of icy disdain.

James avoided her gaze, lowering his head, but memories of that chaotic night, filled with fire and screams, surged back into his mind.

It felt like just yesterday. He remembered dragging his nearly lifeless body from Dr. Smith’s operation, rescuing Taylor who was trapped beneath debris. If it hadn’t been for the chaos and their narrow escape, they might not have survived.

The fear of that night was etched in his memory. And now, he found himself once again face-to-face with the woman who both terrified and fascinated him.

Alex gritted his teeth, forcing himself to regain his composure. He returned to his seat, resting his chin on his hands, desperately trying to think of a solution.

Dr. Smith glanced at him before subtly pulling Sam’s chair closer to her own. Her cold gaze swept over James and Taylor, and they quickly took seats across the table, trying not to provoke her.

The room felt heavy, tension thickening the air. Alex was at a loss for words, and the others sank into a heavy silence.

“Does anyone have a better plan?” Alex finally asked, rubbing his temples, his fatigue evident.

The room fell into thoughtful silence, a few suggestions tossed around. However, the sharpest minds seemed uninterested in engaging.

Sam stared at the table, her thoughts wandering, when she suddenly felt her chair shift slightly. She turned, seeing Dr. Smith’s hand resting on the table, her gaze steady, her expression calm.

“What are you thinking about?” Sam asked quietly.

“Not much,” Dr. Smith replied with a hint of amusement, glancing at Sam, a slight smile on her lips. “I just find your recent performance quite intriguing.”

Sam was taken aback, unsure how to interpret her words. Just as she was about to respond, Alex’s voice broke through, “Dr. Smith, if you’re willing to join the operation yourself, our chances would increase significantly.”

At this, Dr. Smith turned her head, her glasses flashing coldly. She lounged back in her chair, her voice low yet teasing. “If there are no better options, I wouldn’t mind joining you on this little adventure.”

Her words sent a ripple through the room, igniting a flurry of reactions.
