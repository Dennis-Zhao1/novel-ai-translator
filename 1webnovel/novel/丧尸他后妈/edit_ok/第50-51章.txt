**Adaptation for American Audience**

---

Sophia Smith was startled by Ethan's unexpected tone. When she snapped back to reality, she noticed the playful grin on his face and realized she'd been tricked. To her surprise, instead of feeling upset, she found herself delighted by his ability to joke around. Was this what they called Stockholm Syndrome?

“I’ll help you clean this up,” she said, lifting the peculiar device from the table and heading toward the sink. Ethan seemed like he wanted to handle it himself, but she turned away from him and added with a smile, “Just sit back and relax. You don’t have to do a thing. Having you here is enough; it’s what I owe you.”

Ethan raised his bandaged wrist, surprise flickering across his face, but mostly he felt a sense of appreciation. However, she had it all wrong; it was Sophia who should be taking it easy. All he wanted was for her to be a part of his world, and he felt indebted to her for that.

As he was lost in thought, Sophia had already cleaned the device and brought it back. To her relief, it was much simpler than she had feared. Having read too many sci-fi novels, she instinctively thought it might be some sort of parasite, but it turned out to be a small gadget, barely the size of a fingernail.

“Check this out,” Ethan said, holding it up proudly, excitement radiating from him. “It’s got my name engraved on it!”

Sophia was puzzled by his enthusiasm, but she didn’t care much about the reason behind it; she was just glad he was happy. “It really does,” she replied, scrutinizing the glowing letters on the small spherical device.

“I knew this thing was causing trouble. I can’t believe I finally managed to get it out after all these years,” Ethan said, his spirit invigorated. “This device was created by the researchers who made me. It was supposed to control me. Every experimental subject gets one embedded at birth, and each controller is unique. Without the right password, you can’t access it.”

As he spoke, his expression suddenly darkened, and he casually turned his bandaged wrist. Sophia gasped. “To think they wanted to control me is simply delusional.”

Delusional? If you hadn’t managed to retrieve it in time, they might have really controlled you, Sophia thought, her expression conveying her opinion.

Ethan sneered. “Even though John was born before me, he’s only a prototype. The lab’s most perfect creation is me. His intelligence and genes can’t compare to mine. The moment I sensed something was off, I concocted a drug to force it out.” He shook the controller in his hand, his demeanor casual as if he were discussing something trivial.

“John?” Sophia caught the key point in his words. “You came from the same lab? He’s a prototype?”

“Right,” Ethan said, looking as if he had just remembered something. “I haven’t told you about this yet.”

Sophia was at a loss for words. “... Okay, fill me in.”

Ethan briefly explained the identities of the researchers and John, recounting how John had exploited this unknown bug to harm others. Ethan initially thought everyone in the lab had perished, which is why he hadn’t focused on extracting the controller from his body. Instead, he had concentrated on other research. Little did he know that there had been survivors from that fire.

John was digging his own grave; why didn’t he understand? It was as if fate had already given him a warning, yet he still insisted on pushing forward. Ethan felt a twinge of concern for him.

Sophia listened, wide-eyed. “I feel like we’re living in entirely different worlds…” It was all too advanced; she felt a bit dazed.

“It’s okay,” Ethan said as he hopped off the operating table. “Life consists of many aspects; failing in one doesn’t mean much.”

For once, Sophia was comforted by Ethan’s words, a wave of joy washing over her. However, his next comment hit her hard.

“Because you might be failing in other areas even more.”

“... Goodnight.” Sophia turned to head upstairs, her lips twitching in exasperation. He was the patient; she couldn’t bicker with him. She’d let him off this time!

Ethan watched her retreating figure but didn’t follow. Instead, he leaned against the table and picked up the cup she had used for coffee, which bore a faint lip print—so faint it was nearly invisible, but his keen eyesight caught it.

He brought the cup to his lips, brushing against her imprint, the faint aroma of coffee wafting into his senses, but all he could detect was her scent.

There was something he hadn’t mentioned to her, though: while he had retrieved the controller, it didn’t guarantee that John hadn’t already used it to release something before it was out. He still needed to check the controller for any preserved viruses.

As for her… goodnight.

The next day, Sophia awoke to find it was already noon. Seeing the time on the clock made her think she was mistaken, and she hurried down to the underground lab to find Ethan. He was indeed still there, looking a bit disheveled, with traces of dirt on the edges of his black shoes.

“Did you go out?” Sophia casually asked before quickly adding, “What time is it? Why didn’t you wake me? I planned to take a short nap and come down to keep you company, but I ended up sleeping until noon the next day!”

Ethan glanced at his watch and replied contentedly, “It’s exactly the time I set.”

“... Huh?”

“Since you’re awake, come look at this.” Ethan pulled Sophia toward a beautifully crafted door in the northeast corner of the lab. The white door was adorned with intricate patterns, and the translucent material allowed the sunlight to filter through.

… Strange, how was there sunlight underground?

Her confusion was resolved when the door opened. The room was enormous, resembling a field. The light wasn’t from the sun; instead, it was simulated sunlight emanating from lamps suspended from the ceiling, illuminating a patch of fertile soil below. Green plants were just beginning to sprout, and while she didn’t know exactly what they were, they looked promising.

“Although I only managed to get them to sprout overnight, I believe there will be more to harvest tomorrow,” Ethan said, crouching by the edge of the soil and glancing at her. “I only found one type of fruit seed—blueberries. Do you like them?”

Sophia watched him, her gaze drifting to a corner of the room where farming tools and a thick stack of books on crop cultivation were placed. It left her feeling a mix of joy and sorrow.

She slowly walked over to him, kneeling beside him and asking with a wry smile, “Why go to all this trouble?”

Ethan replied calmly, “Didn’t you say last night that you wanted fruit?”

“I meant, why are you acting so nice? Why are you so willing to cater to my every whim? Why do I want to hug you so badly?” Sophia exclaimed, before playfully leaping onto his back, wrapping her arms around his neck and refusing to let go.

Ethan remained unfazed, simply accepting her weight as he squatted there and said, “Because I don’t know when I might die. I want to make sure that every word I say now can serve as my farewell.” He reached up to caress her cheek. “This is the field I’ve prepared for you. While I couldn’t find the sunflowers and peas you wanted, you’ll soon be able to eat blueberries.” He seemed to smile. “And when you’re standing here, it feels like there’s a field of sunflowers.”

He looked into her eyes, his voice deep as he asked again, “Do you like it?”

Sophia glanced at Ethan’s wrist, which had been bandaged after the surgery. He was adept at taking care of himself, alleviating her worries. However, she felt a bit irritated by the glaring lights that were almost as bright as being outdoors. Ugh, so annoying!

“What’s wrong?” Ethan asked, his lips curving into a smirk. “You don’t seem very happy. Don’t you like it?”

Sophia quickly replied, “Of course not! I love it!” She crouched down beside him, studying the field. “Blueberries are delicious, but they’re difficult to grow. Are you sure you can cultivate them?”

Ethan didn’t answer her question. Instead, he seized her chin, pried her lips apart, and kissed her deeply. They slowly stood up, leaning against the wall.

Sophia wrapped her arms around his waist. He understood her thoughts so well; did her eyes betray her burning desire so clearly?

As if sensing her confusion, Ethan let out a low sound, tilting her chin upward and teasing her tongue with his, rubbing against her most sensitive spot with his thigh. “I’ve seen that look in your eyes many times; I’ll never forget it.”

With her eyes half-closed and a dazed expression, Sophia felt his gentle touch on her chest. He deftly unclasped her bra through her clothes, his technique as professional as if he were performing surgery, leaving her feeling inexplicably tingly.

Instinctively, she coiled around him like a snake, unbuttoning his white shirt collar and then the buttons below it, pulling the shirt out from his black trousers. Leaning close to his ear, she whispered, “Darling, I want you.”

With his injured hand hanging beside him, Ethan’s uninjured hand propped against the wall, he breathed out softly, “Then undo my belt.”

Sophia’s face flushed as she looked down at the slight bulge in his black trousers, her ears burning, but she followed her heart and his request, gently loosening his belt, pulling down the zipper, and sliding off his black trousers.

Ethan kissed the corner of her lips. “You put it in yourself.”

Sophia’s eyes widened in shock and embarrassment at his words. “... Are you joking?”

Ethan grinned maliciously. “What do you think?” He waved his bandaged wrist. “I’m the injured party, but if you want me, I’m more than willing to oblige. You just need to lend me a hand.” He suggested playfully, “It’s reasonable for us to help each other out.”

Sophia held her breath and turned her head away, but before she could sort through her feelings, he gently took her hand and placed it on the surface. “It’s not like it’s your first time,” he whispered, biting her earlobe, sending a wave of confusion and pleasure through her body as her fingers involuntarily twitched.

“Just like that, put it in yourself,” he patiently instructed.

Did she really need his guidance? She only felt a little shy, but now that they had come this far, she had been the one to take initiative before. With a determined breath, she pushed aside the last barrier between them and positioned his hardness between her legs. “Press against me,” she whispered, her voice hoarse with a hint of allure, pulling him closer with her hands on his waist as their intimate areas pressed together. He helped lift her skirt, moving aside her underwear, but she couldn’t get him inside.

“You’re so clueless,” Ethan teased with a smirk, turning her around and pressing her against the wall, entering her from behind. The moment he did, she let out a surprised cry, and he instinctively wrapped his arms around her chest, his hands gently exploring her soft curves beneath her shirt.

“... Mmm…” Sophia struggled to support herself against the wall as he pulled her arms back, forcing her to lean back against him. Dazed, she closed her eyes, following his rhythm as soft moans escaped her lips, reminiscent of pearls rolling off a plate, igniting the fire within the man who was causing her turmoil.

“Wait.” Sophia barely managed to open her eyes, the bright lights causing discomfort. She stammered, “Ha… Let’s… change places. It’s too bright… Ah!”

Ethan slowed his movements, his bloodshot eyes not focused on her. He held her tightly, seemingly lost in thought, but his brain reacted quickly. Following Sophia’s suggestion, he turned and carried her out of the experimental room, making a quick turn into a nearby storage space.

The dark, cool, and dry warehouse was draped in thick curtains, completely blocking out any light. Ethan closed the door behind them, setting her down on a nearby barrel, and entered her once again. She curled up in response.

“... It’s too big.” Sophia struggled to push him away. “It’s going to break…”

Her delicate demeanor was unlike any woman Ethan had ever seen. He had his fair share of experiences, and although many of those women had turned into zombies, there were still some alive, like Yi Ning and Xiao Yayou. However, those two were either overly flirtatious or still immature, making it impossible to compare them to her.

Sophia’s lips were kissed to a rosy hue, and each breath she exhaled was a deadly temptation.

“... Be gentle, don’t… don’t do that… Let go of me first…” Ethan’s sudden roughness made Sophia anxious. His wrist was still bandaged; vigorous movements could cause his wound to reopen!

But Ethan didn’t care about such superficial injuries. When she tried to evade his kisses, he kissed her neck instead, and she sighed, “Your injury isn’t healed yet. This isn’t good…”

Ethan nibbled at her chest, and she let out a soft moan, hearing him mumble, “I don’t want to hear you say that.”

Sophia’s heart raced at his “your words hurt my pride” expression, and suddenly impulsive, she jumped off the barrel, barefoot and circled around to press him down. She climbed onto him, straddling his knees, lowering her head with flushed cheeks as she gradually raised herself, slowly moving down.

“Hmm…” She took a deep breath, shyly glancing up at him. He was intently focused on their connection, his expression serious and captivated, igniting a strange sense of excitement and shame within her. This conflicting feeling heightened her sensitivity.

Sophia shot him a glare, and he caught her gaze, lifting his eyes to meet hers. His look was incredibly charming, reminiscent of an inexperienced youth in love. This glance only made her more restless, casting aside her reservations as she quickened her pace, lost in the desires and cravings that engulfed them in the darkness.

Ethan’s long eyelashes fluttered, and her watery eyes reflected his image. He saw his own eyes growing warmer, and it was no wonder she couldn’t hold his gaze. He could almost hear the frantic pounding of his heart, perhaps even more enamored with this unique experience meant for just the two of them.

It was a wild morning, and the two of them in the underground lab were too absorbed in each other to notice the unexpected events occurring outside.

In truth, John wasn’t one to remain idle. Alex was fighting for his life to save him and still hadn’t woken up. Charlie had even died at the fallen atomic base, and for both selfish and moral reasons, John had to come up with a complete plan to eliminate Ethan.

He had long decided to start with Sophia, using his exceptional persuasion skills to convince others to accompany him to Quantum. He met with Sophia’s “father,” Mr. Smith, to have a thorough heart-to-heart.

Mr. Smith had a different set of values compared to ordinary people. His grand perspective was famously unreliable.

During his previous conversation with Sophia, he had already been curious about her abilities. The young man accompanying her seemed quite suspicious in his eyes. He had never trusted them, and now with John’s explanation, he was even more certain that it was Ethan.

Only someone with the ability to infiltrate Quantum’s surveillance system could be Mr. Ethan. So, could Sophia still be seen as his trustworthy daughter?

The answer was no.

In fact, before their video call, he had already harbored doubts about her. He discovered that something hidden in the Quantum factory was missing, and the only ones who could know about it were Sophia or the ion spy, Yi Ning, she had mentioned.

Mr. Smith was a shrewd man, and he wouldn’t kill everyone indiscriminately. Thus, after speaking with Sophia, he began preparing to pick her up from the atomic site. If she spoke the truth, she would be his good daughter. But if she lied, he would have to think carefully about who had taken that priceless solution, which could be considered invaluable in the apocalypse.

“Governor John, I hope our cooperation will be pleasant and successful,” Mr. Smith said cautiously. “But I still hope you can hand Sophia over to me when the time comes, after all, she is my only daughter.”

John replied graciously, “Of course, Miss Smith isn’t beyond redemption. At least she isn’t helping the tyrants.”

Mr. Smith smiled slightly but did not respond. Leading a large group, he joined John and others in searching for Ethan’s laboratory, occasionally casting sharp glances at Yi Ning, who was cloaked and masked. 

What happened to her? Why did she look so disheveled? What happened to her face? Wasn’t Charlie’s sister dressed the same way? Could it be a result of the chaos at the atomic site?

Ha, John was truly naive. He didn’t even trust his own daughter, let alone others. He wouldn’t let anyone connected to the solution’s whereabouts go. He didn’t trust any of them; in this apocalypse, the only person he could trust was himself. He had solidified that belief since his wife died when Sophia’s mother passed away. 

He was a man burdened by heavy feelings, but most of that weight was for himself. Once his own safety was at stake, the scale in his heart would inevitably tip. From a human nature perspective, this didn’t seem unusual, but even a cruel tiger wouldn’t harm its cub. Could he really harm Sophia?
