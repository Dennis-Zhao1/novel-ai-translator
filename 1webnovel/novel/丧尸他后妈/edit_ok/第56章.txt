Although Z hesitated, he knew he had to follow Megatron's instructions and complete the final steps for the stasis agent in the control room. It was a crucial task, and failing to do so could lead to serious complications.

When Sophia Smith noticed Z entering the control room with a somber expression, she couldn't help but notice the bloodstains on his wrist, partially hidden by his watch. The sight made her wince in sympathy, yet Z seemed unfazed as he sat down and began operating the equipment.

Feeling a bit apprehensive, Sophia approached him, gently tapping his shoulder. With sincerity, she asked, “Got a minute?”

“What’s up?” Z replied, his tone hinting at a deeper meaning. “Don’t worry. I won’t keep you waiting too long.”

Sophia was momentarily taken aback, trying to decipher his words. Seeing her puzzled expression, Z assumed she was unhappy and leaned down to kiss her softly. Sophia straightened up, covering her mouth to regain her composure.

He couldn’t possibly think she was eager to get involved, could he? She was frustrated that he didn't seem to take things seriously.

Her lips twitched in annoyance as she took his hand and removed his watch.

Z looked on, eyes wide, realizing her intention. He swallowed the words he meant to say.

“Just remember to give it back when you’re done,” he said with mock-seriousness.

Sophia had planned to hold onto it until his wrist healed, but his comment prompted her to put the watch on her own wrist instead. “Oh, sure. Is it sentimental? You always wear it, even in the shower or bed.”

Without turning around, Z replied while focusing on the computer, “It’s connected to my personal network.”

Sophia stared at the steaming black coffee in his hand, her curiosity piqued. “Where did that come from? It wasn’t here just a moment ago!”

Z shot her a sidelong glance, explaining casually, “It’s programmed. When I come in, it prepares it for me.”

“Oh, you mean Megatron?”

“... Don’t give it names. I wouldn’t have let you access its voice functions if I’d known.” Z lamented as he buried himself in the equipment again.

Sophia watched his movements intently. Though the operation seemed complex, she made a mental note of the steps, just in case she needed to step in.

Z felt her gaze and suppressed a shiver. He hadn’t dared to believe she’d stay by his side. His plans prepared for her leaving, but had she actually left with Charlie back then, overcoming the chaos in his mind would’ve been tougher.

As he adjusted the settings, he muttered, “It’s good for you to watch. You never know when it might come in handy.” He glanced back at her, unease in his eyes. “With your smarts, you should remember the basic steps, right?”

“... Just hurry up and finish.” Sophia replied, a hint of fond exasperation in her voice.

Z said nothing more, a small smirk playing at his lips. He completed the preparation of the stasis agent, downed it, and tossed the test tube aside, turning to embrace her.

“Done,” he said, his voice gravelly.

Sophia stiffened slightly, murmuring, “Oh,” as she tried to push him away, “It’s a bit hot. Can you not be so close...?”

“Tsk, saying things you don’t mean again.” Z slowed his tone, his voice lowering to a sultry whisper. “You know, back in the day, I only had you from midnight to eleven at night, leaving me about an hour without you. But now...” He stepped back, fingers brushing through her hair. “Now I guess I’ll have to start resting normally. That means I only have you from six in the morning to eight at night.”

“... You could wake up later; I don’t mind,” Sophia said, blushing as she attempted to change the subject. “Where are we headed? We can’t just keep hovering. We should find a place to land; it wouldn’t be safe if it rains.”

“Isn’t it nice to stay put here?” Z stood up, shedding his lab coat as he adjusted his tie. He was clearly doing it on purpose!

In truth, Z was being intentional. Leaning casually against the desk, he adopted a posture that was hard to resist, speaking languidly, “I don’t want you to go out anymore. Whenever you insist on leaving, it feels like being forced to leave the lab right when success is within reach.”

Sophia thought he was about to say something romantic, her heart racing with anticipation. She shyly asked, “What kind of feeling?”

“Probably...” He hesitated, struggling to find the words. After a long moment, he finally said softly, “It’s the tragic feeling of being forced to leave the lab right when success is within reach.”

“Is that so?” Sophia looked at him, disappointment clouding her features as she pouted. “So my leaving doesn’t impact you much.”

“Of course it does.” Z quickly denied. “You being out there in the spotlight affects me a lot, so you really shouldn’t go.”

“Why not?”

“Because family matters shouldn’t be aired publicly,” Z replied with a straight face.

Sophia silently turned to leave the control room, asking Megatron as she walked, “Where are we headed right now? Is it safe around us? What’s the weather like?”

Megatron remained silent. Confused, she turned back to see Z following her outside, dressed casually in a loose white shirt, moving leisurely. “I disabled its voice function.”

“Why would you do that?” Her questions seemed endless today.

Z looked down, unbuttoning his shirt. “Some things are too personal. Even if it’s a machine, I don’t want it to eavesdrop.”

“...”

“What are you hiding from?” Z asked, furrowing his brows as he watched Sophia dash to the operating table.

At that moment, Sophia had her back to him. She touched the table before turning back with a meaningful smile on her lips. “Who’s hiding? I’m just looking for something. What are you afraid of?”

Z narrowed his eyes at the bandages, handcuffs, and... a syringe? His forehead twitched, and he rubbed it, feeling a headache coming on as he asked, “What are you planning to do?”

Sophia didn’t answer. She shrugged off the lab coat, wearing only his oversized dress shirt, barefoot and standing there. The shirt barely covered her, revealing her slender, graceful legs.

“Doing what you enjoy, of course.” She walked toward him holding the handcuffs, asking as she approached, “About the stasis agent’s ingredients and procedure, you should write it down on paper or save a copy on the computer later. I’m worried I might forget.”

Z stood still, watching Sophia as she stood on his shoes, stretching up to wrap her arms around his neck. He softly murmured, “Your brain is too slow. Doing this will lower the IQ of our future offspring; I need to think of a way to...”

“No.” Sophia pressed her finger against his lips, leaning in close, her body brushing against him. Breathing in his unique masculine scent, she sighed contentedly, “I didn’t forget; it’s just that... I might be doing something a bit too stimulating soon, and I’m worried I might forget those less important details in the heat of the moment.”

Hearing her suggestive words, Z felt no surprise at all. She was precisely the type of person he liked, but he realized he might have been too eager. Sophia didn’t seem like the kind who would easily give in to his advances.

“I’ve never heard you speak seriously to me before.” She tugged at his collar, leaning back slightly to meet his gaze. “So, tell me?”

Z squinted, puzzled. “Tell you what?”

“A confession.” Sophia stammered, hastily adding, “Like how you love me or something.”

“...”

“If you won’t say it, then fine.” She shrugged and turned to leave, but Z quickly pulled her back into his embrace. She giggled, “Are you scared? If you’re scared, just say it!”

Z's spirits were still somewhat low, but seeing her so lively eased his worries. Initially, he feared her blaming him and creating unnecessary troubles, but now it seemed that she saved him a lot of time and effort. Since she wanted to hear it, he would indulge her, considering it a reward for her ability to discern right from wrong.

In a deep, magnetic tone, he sincerely said, “You know, the reason I didn’t kill you the first time I saw you was twofold: one, your identity, and two...” He deliberately dragged out the last word, gauging her reaction, before casually adding, “Two, apart from your face and body, I couldn’t find any other redeeming qualities. And I don’t keep useless people around...”

“... Shut up.”

“What’s wrong?” He leaned in closer, “Not satisfied?”

Sophia, flustered, retorted, “You... You make me sound so terrible... Even if what you said is true, I still have plenty of people who like me...” Her protest lacked conviction, but she stubbornly held her ground, refusing to lose face in front of him.

However, she had inadvertently hit the nail on the head. In Z’s eyes, every man was his rival. Grinding his teeth, he scoffed, “Yes, you reminded me. I’m running low on bullets.”
