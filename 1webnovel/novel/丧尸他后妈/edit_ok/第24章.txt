Although Sophia Smith really disliked Ethan, she occasionally wished, rather mischievously, for him to just disappear. However, he hadn't yet done anything truly unforgivable. So, if something did happen to him, she might feel a pang of guilt—though not enough to dwell on.

Jake silently followed Sophia as they walked back, his eyes scanning their surroundings, clearly lost in thought. When they returned to the makeshift rest area, they found Emma had already brought Ethan, the new member of their group, back. Emma’s look towards Jake was layered with emotion, but she simply nodded at them before focusing on tending to Ethan's wounds.

Ethan was moved to tears, trembling with gratitude as he lay in the tent. David stood at the entrance, rubbing his temples in frustration, feeling both helpless and obligated to witness the scene despite wanting to look away.

“Miss Smith?” David noticed Sophia, whose clothes were slightly ruffled, and then glanced at the smirking Jake behind her. He opened his mouth to say something but reconsidered, finally settling on, “Dr. Johnson is back too, so let’s all get some rest.” He patted his chest in a gentlemanly manner. “I can keep watch tonight.”

Ethan glared resentfully at Jake, who squatted down in front of him, just an arm's length away from Emma, who was still tending to Ethan’s injuries. She flinched slightly as Ethan yelped in pain when she accidentally touched his wound.

Jake remarked pointedly, “Today was quite the adventure. But let’s not have any more of this nonsense. We’re living in a post-apocalyptic world where life is unpredictable—who knows what might happen next?”

Ethan seemed ready to lose his temper, pushing Emma’s hand away, as if about to confront Jake. But Jake suddenly stood up and stepped on Ethan's outstretched hand with considerable force, causing him to howl in pain.

“Oh dear,” Jake feigned surprise, quickly lifting his foot. “Sorry, didn’t see you there. Are you okay?” He seemed genuinely concerned, leaning down as if to inspect Ethan’s hand, but Emma stepped in front of him, frowning.

Their eyes met, and Emma said slowly, “That’s enough.”

Jake shot her a cold glance before taking a few steps back, creating some distance, and then pulled a bemused Sophia away. They walked over to the SUV and settled into the back seat.

“Feeling better now?” Jake asked.

Sophia grinned, “Yes, thanks for standing up for me.”

Jake paused, slightly embarrassed, and turned away. He huffed, “I wasn’t standing up for you. I just said what needed to be said; it had nothing to do with you. Don’t get carried away.”

“Alright then,” Sophia replied amicably, smiling as she unconsciously reached out to touch his smooth, pale cheek, inadvertently brushing against it twice before realizing what she was doing.

She immediately recoiled, hiding her hand behind her back, nervously watching for his reaction.

Jake raised his hand to the spot she had touched, not looking at her, and simply said, “We’re getting close to the danger zone. It’s risky over there, and in your current state, you definitely can’t go. We need a plan.” He then pulled out a briefcase from under the seat, pressed a button, and it transformed into a makeshift workstation, fully equipped with tools.

Sophia watched him operate the high-tech instruments with a mix of admiration and envy—he was both showy and practical.

Jake glanced at her and said, “If you want to learn, I can teach you. But given your intelligence, it might take a while. For now, you can try using it on your own.”

Ignoring his jab at her intelligence, Sophia asked earnestly, “How do you open it? Is this the briefcase from the lab? There must be a password, right?”

Jake nodded, “There is a password, and it’s…” He opened his mouth but then hesitated.

“What’s wrong?” Sophia asked, confused.

Jake lowered his head, closed the briefcase, and opened it again, inputting the password slowly. “Just watch.”

Sophia immediately focused on his fingers as he pressed the keys, memorizing the password: three letters—W, X, S.

She blinked, gazing at his side profile, noting how his glasses had slipped down his nose without him adjusting them. His long bangs fell messily in front of his face, and from the side, his elongated eyes had a beautiful curve.

However, what surprised her most was the almost unnaturally pale skin on his face, which made the slight flush behind his ears even more pronounced. Suddenly, he turned to look at her, adjusting his glasses, his dark-circled eyes unwavering as they met hers.

After a moment of silence, he pressed his lips together and stammered, “Why are you staring at me? Do you want me to kiss you or something?”

Sophia's gaze faltered. She looked away, and three seconds later, almost on impulse, she leaned down and pressed a soft kiss on his tightly closed lips, catching Jake completely off guard.

...What was with that startled expression? This was nothing; her experiences in relationships were far beyond his imagination. It was just that every time had been forced, leaving no room for enjoyment... yes, just that!

“Ahem.” Jake cleared his throat, covering his mouth as he redirected his attention back to the computer. “I thought about it, and if I teach you shooting in the short term, your success rate will be low. You might lack the courage when the time comes, but we have to go this time, so…”

“So what?” Sophia asked, puzzled.

Jake retrieved a small box from the bottom of the briefcase and carefully took out a set of test tubes, their cool mist escaping into the air. “Drinking this will recombine your genes and grant you a special ability.”

Sophia’s eyes widened as she stared at the blue liquid in the test tube. “What kind of ability? Can I take down a giant robot with my bare hands?”

Jake’s lips twitched. “Electricity. High voltage electricity. Zombies rely on their central nervous system, and electricity can bypass muscles and any defenses to directly attack the central nervous system. Plus, zombies have enough moisture in their bodies to conduct electricity. If you can control high voltage electricity yourself, even if the virus mutates, this solution won’t affect you, and you’ll be just fine.”

Oh… that explained why every survivor base had electric fences around it. Sophia’s gaze towards Jake began to shimmer with admiration, filling Jake with an intense sense of satisfaction, his desire to show off and protect her growing.

“So how do I operate this electricity? Can this generate power?” Sophia curiously pointed at the liquid in the test tube.

Jake spoke earnestly, “So you can’t completely dismiss my experiments as ineffective. These have all been developed through experimentation.” He beamed with pride, “This is a special ability. It generates biological electricity, safe and reliable.” His earnest tone was convincing, as if he were selling a must-have household item.

“Though I’m not sure how it works, it sounds impressive,” Sophia said, reaching for the test tube, but Jake pulled his hand back, clearly unwilling to give it up so easily.

“I knew it,” Sophia sighed. “What do you want in return for this?”

Jake smiled mischievously, his eyebrows arching like a crescent moon. “Why don’t you doubt that I’m trying to trick you?”

Sophia pouted, “If I’ve decided to try trusting you, I need to act on it. But my trust is a one-time offer. If you let me down, don’t expect me to trust you again.”

Jake’s expression flickered for a moment before he returned to normal, smiling. “Of course, how could I let you down? I absolutely won’t betray your trust.” He added, “This potion won’t have any serious side effects, just one minor one.”

“What is it?”

“You’ll get hungry more easily.”

“…” Sophia’s lips twitched slightly. “That’s a strange side effect. If there are no other issues, just give it to me.” She tried to take it again, but Jake still wouldn’t let go.

Looking at Jake with confusion, he hesitated for a moment before finally saying, “You need to kiss me again.”

Sophia stared at him, her cheeks flushing as she turned her head away, mumbling, “Uh… I… you…” She felt frustrated; his blatant request made her shy, especially with his intense gaze. How could she go through with it? Sophia hesitated, saying, “Just give it to me directly. I know you’re not the petty type who wouldn’t give it to me just because I didn’t comply.”

Jake reflected for a moment, then nodded seriously, “I am.”

Sophia didn’t expect him to respond like that, leaving her momentarily speechless. She just sat there cross-legged, staring at him in a daze, which made Jake feel an itch in his heart. He hurriedly threatened, “Think carefully! If you don’t kiss me now, it’ll double in five minutes. If you still don’t kiss me, it’ll be squared, and if you still refuse, it’ll be cubed!”

Sophia couldn’t help but laugh at his “threat.” Without any further words, she mimicked how he often ruffled her hair, running her fingers through his soft, tousled black hair. She gently leaned down and pressed a light kiss on his lips, but as she tried to pull away, he wrapped his arms around her and deepened the kiss.
