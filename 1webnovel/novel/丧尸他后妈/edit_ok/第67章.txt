Sophia Smith sat at her desk, her eyes glued to the flickering streams of data on her computer screen. The images relayed from the trackers on the zombies were oddly captivating, drawing her into a trance. The two sectors she had released were now complete, and the target numbers were steadily decreasing. Each step of the Z Plan was unfolding methodically before her eyes.

She stretched her stiff neck and instinctively glanced over at Ethan, who was engrossed in calibrating the equipment in his hands. His white shirt was slightly unbuttoned, revealing a glimpse of his neck in the dim light. Despite his focused demeanor, there was an unexpected allure about him.

Lately, Sophia had felt an inexplicable connection to Ethan. Maybe it was because she had come to appreciate the importance of his presence in her life. A small smile crossed her lips as she quietly walked over to him, searching for a moment to speak without disrupting his focus.

"What's going on?" Ethan asked, looking up before she could say anything, his voice calm and steady.

"I'm feeling a bit worn out," she admitted, twisting her waist slightly with a hint of fatigue in her smile. "I think I’ll take a nap."

Ethan glanced at the sectors on the screen, then replied with a relaxed tone, "Go ahead. Get some rest. If you feel like continuing later, you know where to find me."

Sophia nodded, her voice light but sincere as she said, "I’ve done what you asked, so you’ll do what I ask in return, right?"

Ethan's lips curled into a subtle smirk. "Are you doubting me?"

"Don't be so smug," she sighed, rolling her eyes playfully before turning to leave.

Watching her walk away, Ethan fell silent for a moment, then decided to follow her out.

As Sophia lay in bed, the room was enveloped in tranquility. The lights were dimmed, and the soft glow from the bedside lamp wrapped around her like a warm hug. She closed her eyes, imagining she could still hear Ethan's gentle murmur. A smile played at the corners of her mouth, and soon, she drifted into a deep sleep.

Ethan stood in the doorway, watching her sleep peacefully. He sighed softly, hesitantly pulling a light blanket over her. His gaze lingered on her serene features, the calmness of her sleeping face tugging at his heart.

"How can someone be so hard to let go?" he murmured to himself before quietly exiting the room.

When Sophia awoke, the only light in the room came from the faint glow of the bedside lamp. She stretched her shoulders and lazily got up, making her way back to the lab.

Pushing open the door, she found Ethan still hard at work. His posture was straight, his movements precise and efficient. The instruments on the lab table emitted a ghostly blue light, casting a stark contrast against his sharp silhouette.

"How long are you planning to stand at the door?" Ethan called out without turning around, his voice laced with playful teasing.

"I thought you couldn't see me," she replied, a hint of embarrassment creeping into her tone as she walked over and sat down at the computer. "Go back to your work."

"If your laziness causes delays, I might have to rethink our arrangement," he said nonchalantly, his sharp tongue teasing as always.

"Like what?" she raised an eyebrow, curious.

"There are no details. Just imagine something truly terrifying," he replied, his gaze focused on the tasks at hand, his glasses glinting faintly.

Sophia sighed as she looked at the screen, "Will these zombies eventually be able to receive the vaccine?"

Ethan continued working without looking up, "That depends on how things go."

"Great," she thought, rolling her eyes internally. This man’s one guarantee in life was to never make promises lightly.

Three days later, Sophia finally completed her tasks, while Ethan seemed to be at a standstill. He leaned against the lab table, propping his chin in thought, a pensive look on his face.

"Stuck on finding a solution?" she asked as she approached from behind.

Ethan glanced back at her, his tone flat, "I can think of something, but I'm not feeling particularly generous today."

"How unreasonable," she shook her head, turning to leave.

"Wait," his voice called out behind her.

Sophia stopped and turned back, "What now?"

"Don't walk away," Ethan slowly stood up, his voice low but carrying an undeniable weight that made it hard to refuse.

Her heart fluttered slightly, a smile creeping onto her face. "What if I don’t want to leave?"

"Then you’ll need to give me a reason to stay," he said, taking a step closer, a complex emotion flickering in his eyes.

"A reason?" she narrowed her eyes, a teasing lilt to her voice. "Just because... you need me."

Ethan paused, a barely perceptible smile twitching at the corner of his lips. "Fine, you win."
