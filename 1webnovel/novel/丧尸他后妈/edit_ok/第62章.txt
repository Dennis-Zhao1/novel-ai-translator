**Chapter 63:**

Sophia Smith rushed over to Ethan, her eyes wide with urgency. “Where have you taken my sister?” she demanded, her voice trembling with anxiety.

Ethan shot her a sidelong glance, a cold smirk curling on his lips. “If you hadn’t shown up today, she would have been just fine. Unfortunately, you’ve personally sealed her fate.”

“What do you mean!?” Sophia stood frozen, disbelief etched across her face as she looked at him.

Ignoring her, Ethan pushed past, striding toward the thicket. As he brushed against her, he shoved her shoulder roughly, causing her to stagger slightly. The weight of the possibility that her sister might already be gone crashed down on her, making it hard to breathe.

Ethan casually inspected the area near the bushes, seemingly ensuring that no one was left alive. Sophia glanced around, and everything appeared eerily calm, as if the chaos had finally subsided. But in reality, it was just the beginning—suddenly, without warning, her sister, who had seemed lifeless moments ago, shot upright.

Sophia screamed, instinctively retreating several steps, creating distance between herself and the resurrected figure. The sight was horrifying; her sister’s face and body twisted grotesquely, her features becoming unrecognizable as rotting flesh erupted from her skin, transforming her into a towering, skinless monstrosity.

Ethan turned to face the creature that had once been her sister, now an unrecognizable beast that howled in agony toward the sky.

The others present struggled to comprehend the transformation. Just moments ago, her sister had seemed perfectly fine—how could she have changed so drastically?

As they all took instinctive steps back, their eyes flickered toward Ethan, who stood calmly behind the monster, unwavering in the face of danger. Despite the threat looming behind him, he appeared utterly unafraid, seemingly indifferent to the creature’s wrath. His thin frame contrasted sharply with the terror surrounding him.

This man was impossible to describe; he evoked both hatred and fear. A villain who deserved every ounce of contempt, yet he exuded a strange charm. At that moment, his icy demeanor was more chilling than the monster itself.

“Did you use the gun I left behind?” Ethan asked Sophia, his tone casual, almost intrigued, as he kept his gaze fixed on her, even with the aberration looming nearby.

Sophia rubbed her throbbing forehead and nodded. “Yes, why?”

Ethan sighed, a hint of frustration in his voice. “I should have known better than to leave you alone. In just a few days, you’ve caused chaos.”

Sophia was at a loss for words, her mind racing. “Do you have a way to fix this? She seems to be getting bigger!”

Ethan’s expression turned serious as he regarded her, completely disregarding the monstrosity. Without a word, he drew the gun from his waistband, pointing its dark muzzle at the creature’s back, yet his eyes remained fixed on Sophia.

Feeling increasingly uneasy under his intense gaze, Sophia was unsure of his intentions. But three seconds later, she understood everything.

“Run!” Ethan suddenly shouted, firing his weapon behind her. She instinctively moved forward but was abruptly jerked back by someone—Caleb.

In a split second, Caleb positioned himself in front of Sophia, taking the bullet meant for her. Shocked, she turned to see him, her heart pounding.

As the bullet struck, a searing pain shot through her, and she cried out, clutching her right shoulder where the bullet had pierced, collapsing to the ground. Caleb held her tightly, shielding her from further harm as he struggled to keep her safe.

In that instant, Ethan froze, watching Sophia get shot. He fired again, attempting to deflect the bullet away from her heart, but it merely grazed her left shoulder, causing more damage.

His expression shifted from panic to regret as he watched the blood stain her white shirt, the sight hitting him like a punch to the gut. “Caleb,” he bit out, his voice laced with venom. “You’re done for.”

Ignoring the now monstrous figure, who began to seek out new prey, Ethan advanced toward Caleb, who was torn between fear and resentment, with an almost imperceptible hint of admiration. He would never dare defy Ethan if it were just him. Yet he was left with no choice, driven by a need to protect those around him.

“Stay back!” Caleb shouted, taking a deep breath, aiming his gun at Ethan. “If you come any closer, I’ll shoot!”

Ethan didn’t flinch or draw his weapon. He simply kept his expressionless gaze locked on Caleb, stepping forward without hesitation.

Caleb fired, but Ethan nimbly dodged, moving with a speed that wasn’t human.

Stunned, Caleb remained rooted in place. “Control Sophia!” he heard someone shout, and it snapped him back to reality.

He quickly reacted, pressing the muzzle of his weapon against Sophia’s temple. She was on the brink of unconsciousness, the special bullets dissolving within her, blood continuing to pour from her wounds, and even Caleb was now smeared with her blood, which flowed as if inexhaustible.

“If you come any closer, I’ll kill her!” Caleb yelled, desperation creeping into his voice.

Ethan’s steps stilled, his gaze fixed on Sophia, who was barely clinging to life. Her pale face filled him with dread. But just as he was about to concede, she suddenly opened her eyes, lifting her hand to grip tightly onto Caleb’s arm that held the gun. A jolt of electricity surged between them, causing them to separate.

Ethan seized the opportunity, pulling her into his embrace and retreating swiftly. But upon hitting the ground, Caleb lay lifeless.

“Sophia…” Ethan cradled her in his arms, discarding his weapon, as she grimaced in pain, her lips trembling. “The gun… pick it up. Be careful…”

Ethan realized the danger he was in, but he couldn’t force himself to calm down. For the first time, he felt the weight of his arrogance—the overconfidence that might win him love but could also cost him everything he held dear.

If he hadn’t been so careless, perhaps none of this would have happened. If only he had agreed to her wishes, or taken her away differently, maybe…

But there were no ‘ifs.’

Ethan let out a long breath, pressing his hand against her bleeding wound. As he glanced up, he saw a familiar figure emerging from behind Alex—John.

“Did you think you were the clever one? How naive,” Ethan’s lips curled into a cold smile.

“Well, Mr. Ethan, are you satisfied with my arrangements?” John asked with a smirk. But when he noticed Sophia bleeding and near death, his expression flickered momentarily before he turned away, feigning indifference. “If you surrender now, I can have someone tend to Sophia’s wounds. Otherwise…”

Before he could finish, the neglected monster charged forward, causing panic among the onlookers. It seized the last person in its grasp, tearing them apart. They were the loyal guards who had followed before the chaos unfolded.

Sophia, dazed, could only see vague shapes, struggling to breathe as panic set in. “Am I… am I dying?” she murmured.

Ethan’s voice was low but resolute. “No, you won’t. You’ll never die. I’ll save you.”

Sophia managed a weak smile, lifting her hand to caress his chin. But her strength failed her, and her arm dropped limply. “It seems you’ve blocked my view. I can’t see anyone but you…”

“Don’t talk,” Ethan urged, his focus solely on her wound, cursing himself for using the newly developed bullets. If only he hadn’t used them…

Sophia’s lips pressed together, her expression void of emotion. She opened her mouth, and after a long delay, she stammered out a final sentence before losing consciousness. But perhaps it wasn’t merely unconsciousness… Perhaps she truly was dying.

Before fading away, she said, “I want to give you a name—one that only I can call you. Not just a number… Ethan…” Her voice was filled with regret. “Ethan… I want to see you. I want to be with you… I… I love you.”

With you by my side, the world filled with chaos, the dark, terrifying nights have become bearable. I’m grateful for your care and kindness, for giving me a small corner of beauty in this wretched world. I had thought everything would be simple, but I didn’t realize how much effort you put in. I’m sorry.

I’m sorry, sorry. Sorry that I didn’t have the strength to say these words to you, sorry that I left you with regrets. I can barely hear you anymore, nor can I see you clearly, but when I close my eyes, you appear, a light in the darkness.

“Sophia…?” Ethan’s expression was hollow as he gazed at the unconscious Sophia. His hand found her wrist, feeling her faint pulse. He didn’t know whether to breathe a sigh of relief or feel joy. At least she wasn’t dead, which meant he had a chance to save her.

He turned to leave quickly but was suddenly confronted by the monstrous figure, who had turned its attention back to him. Ethan had left his gun behind and, with worry for Sophia clouding his mind, was momentarily caught off guard when it grabbed him.

But that moment was fleeting; he swiftly evaded its grasp, maneuvering with inhuman agility as he continued to hold Sophia, darting toward the fallen weapon. However, John, sensing his intention, recklessly rushed forward, grabbing the gun and firing it at the creature’s head.

Bang—The bullet penetrated the creature’s brain. The newly developed bullets that had nearly killed Sophia could also take down the monster, which Ethan couldn’t decide whether to consider good news.

John picked up the gun, wiping the black blood from his face, directing it at Ethan. “Come with me. Sophia can’t wait; the entire facility has been taken over by us. I’m the one who can provide what you need.”

Ethan frowned, studying him silently. He always exuded an icy composure.

“Do you think your tech can locate you based on your signal and save you?” John sneered. “I suggest you save your breath. I’ve set up a signal jamming network around here. None of your signals can get out.” He relished this moment of triumph. “You should regret ever sending a signal to Quantum so that Sophia and I could video chat; otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to obtain your signal sample.”

Ethan gradually relaxed his furrowed brow, casting a meaningful glance at Alex, the true clever one. What he needed to do now required the help of this intelligent individual.

“I can agree to any of your requests, but right now, I need a clean laboratory and medical personnel,” Ethan stated, conceding without hesitation as he hurried through the crowd toward John’s military vehicle, carefully placing Sophia inside before climbing in himself.

John immediately ordered his men to follow, hurrying alongside him, calling back to Alex, “Aren’t you coming? As long as he’s alive, there’s nothing we can’t obtain.”

Alex’s expression was turbulent; he felt a twinge of guilt for Sophia, whom he had thought highly of. Now that she was in this state because of this incident, he felt a pang of remorse. But then he recalled Sophia’s severe injuries at Ethan’s hands, and he felt slightly better, deeply contemplating as he followed suit.

John sat tightly behind Ethan in the second military vehicle, disliking unexpected surprises. If he hadn’t ensured everything was foolproof, he wouldn’t have come. He had to thank the disruptive chaos; otherwise, he might not have captured Ethan so easily.

He could have acknowledged Ethan as his potential ally, potentially easing the path to what he wanted, but given Ethan’s character, who could predict whether he would agree? Even if he didn’t, John couldn’t force him; Ethan’s strength was evident. Even if he coerced Ethan into fulfilling his demands, Ethan could still eliminate him when the time was right. John wouldn’t take that risk. So even if he used his ally status to help create what he desired, he ultimately had to eliminate Ethan.

After all, Ethan was the root cause of this chaos. John harbored deep-seated hatred for Ethan, but more importantly, who could assure him that Ethan wouldn’t sacrifice everyone for Sophia’s survival?

While the current situation was somewhat troublesome and costly, it was the safest and most direct method. He was satisfied with this outcome, even if… even if his only daughter was on the brink of death, and the consequences of that were unimaginable.

Yet for some reason, John was certain that as long as Ethan was present, Sophia would not die.
