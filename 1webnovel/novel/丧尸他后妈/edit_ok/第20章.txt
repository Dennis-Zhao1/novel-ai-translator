“Miss Evans is right…” Jake Miller said, finally realizing something as he looked at Ethan with a face full of admiration. “Ethan, with your vast knowledge, the contamination in the water source might really be…”

“No.” Ethan cut him off sharply, his handsome face betraying no emotion. “I’m leaving here. I don’t have the time or energy for this, so it’s not going to happen.”

Leaving? There were four people present, and aside from Ethan, the other three fixed their gazes on him. Yet, he only looked at Sophia Smith, something complex flickering in his eyes. It was a bit profound, and Sophia couldn’t quite grasp it.

“Can you all step aside for a moment? I need to speak to her alone.” Ethan knew Sophia might not understand on her own, so he asked Jake and Miss Evans to give them a moment, restoring their little world back to just the two of them.

As soon as they left, Sophia immediately asked, “You’re leaving? Does that mean you really did poison the water?” Her face was filled with reluctance; once there was a problem with the water source, she would have to leave too. Even if Ethan wasn’t there, she might still run into him on the way, which was incredibly frustrating.

Ethan let out a dismissive laugh. “I wouldn’t need to see blood to harm anyone. Why would I poison anyone?”

“…” Sophia pressed her hand against her twitching mouth. “Sorry, I overthought it.”

“Doesn’t matter.” Ethan glanced at his watch, fastening the buttons of his jacket. As he did, he kept his eyes lowered, speaking softly, “Just because I’m smiling and talking to you doesn’t mean I’m not upset. You might not realize it, but being around you feels like I’m being drained by a vampire. I’m just your mobile snack; you can bite whenever you’re hungry, until I’m completely drained dry, and then you look at me with disgust.” He paused for a moment, his long brows arching slightly, his expression darkening. “I guess you’re pretty sure you can find another one like me to take my place, so you don’t feel nervous about it.”

When he finished buttoning up, he finally met Sophia’s gaze. Seeing her furrowed brow and troubled expression made him hesitate, but he pressed on, determined to say what he needed to: “This time, I’m really leaving. If you’re not nervous, then fine. I won’t let you drain me again, and I don’t want you to worry anymore.” He sighed, putting on a cheerful facade. “I’m tired of you; I won’t be nice to you anymore. From now on, you’re just like everyone else in my eyes.” After saying that, he turned around decisively and walked away, leaving Sophia standing there, tears streaming down her face, unsure why his words made her feel so heartbroken.

Clearly… she should have been happy! This cold-blooded scientist, who treated countless innocent lives as mere subjects in his experiments, was finally not haunting her anymore. She had escaped his grasp and could finally breathe and work towards her goal of living a safe life. So why did it hurt so much?

Sophia sniffled, forcing back her tears. After a moment of composure, she gathered Ethan’s suitcase and left the lab, heading towards the residence for the other subjects.

With her head down, she walked along listlessly until a pair of white sneakers caught her attention. She looked up to find Emily Cooper.

“He really left?” Emily frowned and asked.

Sophia replied flatly, “I guess so. I’m not too sure about these things. If you want to know, it’s better to ask Jake. He’ll definitely know if anyone’s left here.”

“The facility is on lockdown. Governor Miller is trying to find out who poisoned the water. If he left through the front, there’s no way he could have gotten out.” Emily stated confidently.

“Is that so?” Sophia pursed her lips, trying to walk past her, but Emily grabbed her hand.

Emily looked at her earnestly. “Are you still mad at me? Aren’t we good friends? I know I hurt you, but I promise I’ll never do it again. Will you forgive me just this once? Please?”

“…” To be honest, if Emily wasn’t such a good actress, she might genuinely want to reconcile with Sophia. The sincerity in her eyes was evident, but unfortunately, Sophia had read the original text. Despite being unclear on some of the finer points, as “Sophia Smith,” she still found it hard to open up to Emily. “I’m not angry with you,” Sophia maintained a sincere facade. “I’m just feeling a bit unwell and want to go rest for a while.”

“Oh?” Emily raised an eyebrow, changing the subject, “Michael should be coming to pick you up soon.”

“He’s coming here?” Sophia frowned. “He didn’t come with you, so doesn’t that mean he doesn’t need to find me anymore?”

Emily blinked innocently. “We got separated due to some danger on the way. You’re the daughter of the quantum family; he came out to find you. If he can’t find you, he can’t go back and report to Governor Smith. How could he not come looking for you?”

Sophia forced a smile. “Oh, I see. Thanks for the heads-up.”

“No problem, we’re good sisters, right?” Emily took her hand and smiled. “I’ll keep my distance from Michael from now on, so don’t worry. I really won’t compete with you for him again. I promise I won’t make the same mistake twice.”

“Uh-huh.” Sophia smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “You said we’re good sisters. I’ve come to terms with it. Since you two are truly in love, I should naturally support you. I’d much rather have two friends than hold onto a man who doesn’t love me.”

Emily was momentarily taken aback, unsure of how to respond. Sophia immediately pulled her hand back and said her goodbyes, but Emily chased after her once more. “Wait, Sophia.” She grasped Sophia’s wrist, hesitating before asking softly, “Do you know him well? That professor?”

“…”

“Do you know his name? Did he really leave? The front gate hasn’t let anyone out; where could he have gone?”

“…”

“Sophia?”

Sophia expressionlessly pulled her wrist back and stared into Emily’s eyes, speaking each word deliberately. “I don’t know him at all. If you want to know anything, just ask Jake. My head hurts; I need to rest.” With that, she walked away, leaving no room for Emily to continue her questioning.

Emily watched her retreating figure thoughtfully, her long black hair cascading over her shoulders. Moments later, she turned and rushed back towards the lab.

Once back in her room, Sophia hid Ethan’s suitcase and began planning her escape from the facility. But every time she thought of leaving, Ethan’s image would swirl in her mind, making her dizzy and desperate to cry. Unable to hold back any longer, she let the tears flow. Sophia buried her face in the blankets on her bed, sobbing quietly, unaware of the soft sound of the door opening.

By the time she noticed someone had entered the room, that person was already sitting beside her.

“What are you doing here?” Sophia peered through her tear-stained eyes at the figure who was pulling the blanket away from her. Her voice was thick with emotion as she asked, “Aren’t you leaving?”

Ethan’s expression was icy, his indifference apparent. “I never said I was leaving today. I just said I was going to leave, not that I was leaving today.”

Sophia stared at him in confusion, as if he were speaking another language. After a moment of bewilderment, she finally understood, nodding slowly. Then, after a brief pause, she grabbed his arm and pinched it hard, her nails digging into his flesh. Yet, he didn’t flinch, his calm and sharp gaze fixed on her.

“You actually called me a vampire?” Sophia looked at him with an accusatory gaze. “And made me sound like a sanitary pad?” Her tone was complex. “You know, you’re way more pathetic than a vampire. At least vampires are cold-blooded. What about you? What do you have besides an empty shell?” She questioned, perplexed. “Why do you insist on doing this thankless research? Turning people into that, making the world so miserable, and living alone like this—what’s your goal?”

Ethan genuinely pondered her question for a moment. After a brief silence, he replied seriously, “I’m not bored enough to want to change a world that’s beyond saving. Instead, I’ve been creating my own world.”

“…What an impressive ideal.” You know that’s not cute in reality, right?

Ethan seemed to miss the underlying tone in Sophia’s words and smiled, his eyes softening. The cold mask he’d been maintaining fell away, revealing a genuine happiness as he allowed the suppressed joy—stemming from her tears over his departure—to surface. “Yeah, creating a new world where only the people I like can live. That’s probably what it feels like.”
