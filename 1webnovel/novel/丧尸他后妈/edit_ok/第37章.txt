Ethan Mitchell was actually aware that Connor was trying to keep him at arm's length for a reason, but he didn’t mind at all. In fact, he only needed Ivy to be safe; he had no interest in what she was up to, as long as it didn’t threaten the security of the community. She could do as she pleased.

When Connor asked Ethan to help look for Lily, he readily agreed. Despite being the son of the community leader, he found the constant politics there far more annoying than going out to search for her. His father had a way of choosing alliances, so why did he have to settle for such a troublesome young lady? Ethan hoped his father would reconsider soon.

With a sigh, Ethan set off in search of Lily. At that moment, Lily was receiving a talking-to from her older brother, Chris. Chris looked at his younger sister, who was gazing at him with a pitiful expression, and felt a mix of frustration and sympathy. Lily’s face resembled that of a small puppy, making it hard for him to scold her despite knowing she had made a significant mistake. He was already soft-hearted, and under the weight of her pleading gaze, all of his reprimands faded away.

“Next time…” Chris sighed and rubbed his forehead. “You can’t do this again, do you understand?”

Lily’s spirits soared, though she dared not show it on her face, maintaining a tone filled with feigned sadness. “I understand, big brother.”

“Alright.” Chris gently ruffled her hair and said warmly, “Go rest now. Although your elder brother entrusted your education to me, he might still approach you privately, so be prepared.”

At the mention of Connor, Lily’s expression stiffened slightly. She glanced at the ceiling, nodded, and asked, “Where did he go after dinner tonight?” She smiled, “I’m surprised he didn’t come immediately to scold me.”

Chris frowned in thought. “I believe he went to meet Miss Ivy.”

“He went to see her?!” Lily looked at him, astonished.

“Yes, why?” Chris asked, puzzled.

“Where are they?” Lily pressed eagerly.

Though Chris was confused, he told his sister Ivy's address. As soon as Lily heard it, she spun around and dashed out, disappearing in an instant.

Chris couldn’t help but ponder this, propping his head on one hand, lost in thought.

When Ethan arrived, Lily had just left not long ago. He explained his purpose for coming to Chris, who then informed him of Lily’s abrupt departure. After blinking in surprise, Ethan hesitated for a moment before sharing what had happened on the way to the community center.

Meanwhile, Lily had already sprinted to Ivy’s residence. By this time, Zach and Sophie Williams had been gone for a while. Lily pushed the door open and raced up the stairs, calming her breath to listen for any sounds on the second floor. She quickly located their room and pushed the door open with a determined shove, startling Ivy and Connor, who were in the middle of an intimate moment.

Ivy was disheveled, her upper body partially covered, with only her undergarments preserving her modesty. Connor, while still somewhat properly dressed, had his belt undone, and it was clear that things had escalated.

Lily’s anger surged, her expression morphing from neutral to one of fury, her brows knitting together tightly as her delicate face turned icy, sending shivers down anyone who dared glance her way.

“Lily? What are you doing here?” Connor rushed to her, but Lily didn’t even spare him a glance as she pushed him aside and walked toward Ivy.

“You seduced him, didn’t you?” Lily’s voice was laced with a mixture of accusation and mockery.

Ivy, with an indifferent expression, shielded her chest with one arm. Lily noticed this and looked down at her own flat chest, her eyes suddenly welling with tears.

Seeing her like this, Connor felt a pang of pain in his heart and moved to comfort her, wanting to explain, but he didn’t know how, and she wouldn’t let him near.

Prior to this, Connor had never imagined things would escalate to this point.

Ivy had written on the invitation for their meeting that she wanted a relatively quiet environment to discuss matters, which was why he had sent Ethan away. He had intended to talk to Lily about her sneaking out afterward. Yet, he didn’t foresee the trap he had walked into. He had only considered his perspective, not taking into account the variables on Ivy’s side.

Ivy was undeniably beautiful, and her presence was what every man dreamed of; any man who claimed to be uninterested in her allure was either a rare breed or a saint. As a normal man, he found it hard to resist.

When Ivy followed him out and led him into the room, her body pressed against his, his thoughts were consumed by Lily. But Lily was his sister—his biological sister. That twisted feeling of shame could never be voiced; even a hint of it had frightened her enough to run away from the community. If she knew what he truly felt, she would be terrified.

He didn’t want the two most important people in his life—his sister and his friend—to feel hurt. So, in a distorted way of thinking, he convinced himself that maybe it didn’t matter who was involved; when a tempting opportunity presented itself, how could he refuse?

Moreover, Ivy had her reasons for seeking him out. She had her own motives, ones that were related to the safety of the community.

As she embraced him, she whispered softly in his ear, “You’re wondering why so many threats have suddenly gathered here, aren’t you?” Her body brushed against him, igniting sparks of excitement.

Connor forced himself to maintain his composure. “What insights do you have, Miss Ivy?”

“Perhaps it’s the work of the community,” she replied with a playful smile. “Look at how attentive Ethan Mitchell is. Why is he so eager to offer help? He even suggested his father send people to assist the community center. Doesn’t that seem too generous?” Ivy continued meaningfully, “Don’t forget how dire the situation is at the community; they can barely hold on for long, and with the community center so close, it would be the perfect target if someone wanted to strike. In this situation, genuine feelings between people are hard to come by.”

Connor frowned, contemplating her words. “So why are you telling me this?”

Ivy wouldn’t reveal her true identity. Although she had no blood ties to the leader of the community, Jack Anderson had saved her life. He had cared for a group of orphans, teaching them how to read, write, and defend themselves—a sliver of warmth in a world filled with despair. She would give her all to repay him.

Her biggest goal in life, apart from unifying the four major communities and taking Zach into her fold, was simple.

“Because…” Ivy leaned softly against him, imagining that the man she was embracing was the aloof doctor she often saw in a white coat. A smile crept onto her lips, “As a fragile woman, what could my motivations be? If I had to find one, it’s likely because… the community leader is a lecher, and I need a stepping stone to escape them. It appears I’ve fallen for you at first sight.”

...

To harm someone means to make them fall in love with you, making them dependent and spoiled, giving in to their every whim. When they become reckless and out of control, you deliver a heavy blow, ensuring they crumble completely.

Ivy opened her eyes, her mind echoing with Jack Anderson’s gentle teachings. As a man began to invade her space, her brow furrowed. She stroked Connor’s soft dark hair, imagining him as Zach, and any feelings of resistance or discomfort vanished.

Connor didn’t fully believe Ivy; he was too shrewd to take her words at face value. While he accepted Ethan’s proposal for assistance from the community, he had his own reasons. Although Ivy’s warning was worth considering, the community was still smaller than the community center, and there were threats outside. Surely, the community wouldn’t be the one to suffer; why wouldn’t he take advantage of this?

Both had ulterior motives, engaging in actions that only lovers would do, unaware of the chaos that Lily would soon bring.

Seeing Ivy’s silence, Lily understood that she had accepted the situation. Yet, despite that, her hatred was directed squarely at Connor, for she knew that if he were unwilling, Ivy’s efforts would be in vain.

With red-rimmed eyes, Lily turned to face Connor, who stood there stiffly. He wanted to reach out and wipe her tears but was met with her questioning, disappointed gaze, forcing him to lower his head in silence.

“What a good brother I have,” Lily said, her anger turning into a bitter smile as she nodded repeatedly. “I tried to convince myself many times to let it go while I was out, but it was pointless. That’s why I came back with them. But you…” She took a deep breath, casting a sidelong glance before turning to leave. “You two continue on, pretend I was never here.”

Connor felt as if lightning had struck him, stunned in place. Once he snapped back to reality, he rushed out after her. Ivy remained behind, a mocking smile on her face as she watched their retreating figures, confidently revealing her chest, as if sure that no one would interrupt them tonight.

Coincidentally, someone else did arrive.

Chris had arranged accommodations for Ethan and was waiting for him at Connor’s place. However, after waiting for quite some time with no sign of Connor, he began to worry. He then checked in on Lily but found her missing as well.

Out of options, Chris suppressed his anxiety and headed to Ivy’s place. He knocked on the door downstairs but received no response. Instantly, the worst possibilities crossed his mind—what if something bad had happened? Were there spies? Or had threats gotten in?

Dashing inside, he found the first floor quiet and unharmed. He quickly rushed up to the second floor, lifting his eyes to see Ivy’s graceful figure.

Chris immediately turned away, his tall and lean figure outlined against the moonlight, as if surrounded by a faint mist.

Ivy was momentarily taken aback, then a helpless smile appeared on her face. “Deputy Leader Chris?”

Chris stood stiffly with his back to her, his expression darkening.

Generally calm people find it hard to get angry, but when they do, their fury is profound. Chris had a good relationship with Connor. Although they were not blood siblings, he was much closer to him than to their other sister, Sarah. Knowing a bit about the complicated situation between Connor and Lily, he had already pieced together what was happening when he saw the scene before him.

With his back still turned to Ivy, he said, “Miss Ivy, I don’t care what your intentions are, but if you plan to harm my family or this community, I suggest you abandon that thought.” As he spoke, he emotionlessly unfastened the top button of his uniform and accurately tossed his jacket onto Ivy’s shoulders before turning to look at her coldly. “The community center does not welcome those with ill intentions. As a young lady, I assume you still possess some dignity and self-respect. This time, I’ll let it go, but don’t let me catch you next time.” He finished, walking downstairs. At the door, he added icily, “Remember this: don’t let the fact that you’ve taken advantage of someone blind you to the consequences. Many who thought they had succeeded ended up regretting it.”

Ivy stood there, stunned, seemingly not expecting such harsh words from someone who appeared so gentle.

Meanwhile, while they were caught up in their own chaos, Zach and Sophie Williams were still lost in their own world. For a moment, Sophie thought that continuing like this wouldn’t be so bad. Who cared about the world or the threats? Finding a place where they couldn’t see any of this and living together would be fine… but…

Sophie let out a breath, lowering her arm that had shielded her eyes. Daylight had already arrived.

With the dawn, some things couldn’t be ignored, like the reality of the situation that wouldn’t simply cease to exist because one chose to look away. Stepping outside, she saw no one—no shops, no transportation—constantly worrying about whether she’d be in danger at night…

She looked beside her, where it was empty and somewhat chilly, indicating that Zach had left for a while. Where had he gone?

As she pondered this, the door swung open, revealing Zach in his white protective suit. As he shed the white coat, his tall, well-defined figure came into view. Sophie squinted, recalling the exhilarating sensations from the previous night… Wait, something felt off—wasn’t that a mindset more typical of a man?

“Get up when you wake up,” Zach said, glancing at his watch. “It’s almost noon; you need to eat lunch, your body requires a lot of nourishment right now.”

Sophie pouted, reluctant. “I don’t want to get up.”

“Why not?” Zach pressed, expecting a reasonable explanation.

Sophie mumbled nonsensically, “Because I caught a cold.” She feigned a stuffy nose, adding, “Ah, I think I have a slight fever.” She touched her forehead, pretending to be sick. “I feel so awful.”

Zach was far from naïve; he could see through her act. He spoke nonchalantly, “Sophie Williams, you know, when I was still in school, I knew someone who caught a cold and then…”

He paused deliberately, waiting for her to inquire.

“What happened then?” Sophie asked, intrigued.

Zach’s lips curled into a playful smile as he sat down beside her. “Then he died.”

“...Thanks, I feel much better now,” Sophie instantly sat up.
