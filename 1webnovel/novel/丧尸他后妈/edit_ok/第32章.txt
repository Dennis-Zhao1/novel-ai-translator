“What’s happening?” Sarah Smith frowned, squinting at the thick cloud of smoke rising from the crashed plane ahead. As she peered closer, her heart skipped a beat. “Oh no, it’s zombies!”

“Oh wow,” Zack commented, surprisingly upbeat. “This is just what we needed. A little chaos to shake things up.” He turned to Sarah with a teasing grin, suggesting, “Should we just toss her out there?”

Sarah blinked in disbelief, tearing her gaze away from the approaching horde to scrutinize his expression. “Are you serious?”

Without a glance at the corner where Lily was now screaming, Zack chuckled, “Just kidding.” His smile quickly faded as he shifted gears, ready to reverse the vehicle and steer clear of the danger.

There’s an old saying: you don't fear an opponent who’s a genius; you fear a teammate who’s a complete fool.

Seeing the mass of zombies ahead, Owen didn’t back down. Instead, he charged forward, weapon raised, as if trying to prove something. He rushed headlong into the chaos, instantly putting himself in a precarious position, surrounded.

Zack stared in disbelief, letting out a sigh. “Meeting someone like him in this lifetime really broadens my horizons.”

“Agreed.” Sarah nodded, her expression exasperated.

Cowering in the corner, Lily seemed like she wanted to voice her opinion, but under Zack's cold gaze, she fell silent, shrinking back further.

Taking a deep breath, Sarah tried to shake off some odd thoughts creeping into her mind, unable to resist asking Zack, “Should we go down and help?”

Zack leaned back casually, smirking. “Do you think I have a choice?” His eyes flicked to the other side, where Ian had already taken off, gun in hand, engaging the zombies. Matt stood by their green pickup, looking innocent, like a newbie just trying to gain some experience.

“The situation looks grim,” Zack said, analyzing quickly. “If we count Matt, the ratio is 6 to 20. But if we join in…” He paused, a confident smile creeping onto his lips. “That makes it 1 to 0.”

“Why?” Sarah asked, puzzled.

“Because if I'm that ‘1’, those zombies will soon turn into ‘0’.” Zack adjusted his glasses, his tone assured to the point of arrogance.

Suppressing an eye roll, Sarah whispered, “You decide.”

Deep down, she didn’t want to get involved. Part of her even hoped that Ian and Owen might run into some trouble, removing the threat entirely. Yet, she couldn't ignore her conscience—they hadn’t done anything unforgivable. The struggle between selfishness and morality raged within her, leading her to ultimately hand over the decision to Zack.

Zack noticed her internal conflict and, after a moment of silence, sighed. He took off his jacket, removed his glasses, and put on a single lens, preparing to join the fray. “You stay in the car, and don’t get near Lily,” his voice was low and steady.

“What are you going to do?” Sarah asked, surprised.

“Save people.” Zack ruffled his messy hair, his expression calm. “If I can’t save them, I’ll at least put them out of their misery and clean up the zombies. Isn’t that what you wanted me to do—be a good Samaritan?” He flashed a chilling smile. “I used to be reckless, leaving a trail of destruction wherever I went.”

Watching him step out of the car, a complex mix of emotions surged within Sarah. Once Zack joined the battle, the tide began to turn. His precise and swift attacks clearly made the zombie horde wary. Even though he was slender, his movements were sharp and agile, making him the undeniable center of the chaos.

However, Owen took this opportunity to stir trouble. Several times, he redirected danger towards Zack, even deliberately misfiring to put Zack in harm’s way. Sarah witnessed these malicious acts, and she could no longer hold back. Grabbing her handgun, she kicked the door open and jumped into the fray.

As she aimed at the zombies Owen had lured, she shot a cold glare at Ian, shoving her aside from Zack’s vicinity. “I’ll protect my own. No need for you to worry.”

Zack paused, seemingly touched by her words, and turned to say something to her. But Sarah quickly shot down a zombie looming behind him, frowning as she urged, “Let’s focus on the task at hand!”

At that moment, Owen’s reckless actions finally bore fruit. A zombie seized the opportunity and lunged at him, gripping him tightly. Its sharp teeth sank deep into his neck, blood gushing out, mingling with the foul stench of decay that filled the air.

Instinctively, Sarah raised her gun and shot, quickly ending the zombie's life. As Owen fell to the ground, he looked up at Ian with eyes filled with resentment and despair.
