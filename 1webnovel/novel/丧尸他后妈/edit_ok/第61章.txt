"Ever played a game?" Sophia Smith asked as she turned on the console, her eyes meeting Sam Johnson's. "It's called Plants vs. Zombies."

Sam blinked, clearly puzzled. "No, I haven't."

Sophia chuckled. "No worries," she said, her voice light. "I'll show you how to play. I'll be the zombie this time."

"…"

"Are those the quantum guys you mentioned?" she asked, pointing at the screen where bizarre figures fumbled about like awkward creatures.

"They're well-disguised, but they look kind of ridiculous—like something out of a weird urban legend," she added.

"Yeah," Sam's expression grew serious as he stared at the screen. "There are a lot of them, and things are getting pretty intense." He pressed his lips together. "Although I've worked with Mr. Charles before, I'm telling the truth. I hope you take this seriously, Miss Smith."

Sophia nodded, acknowledging his concern. Still, it seemed Sam felt it wasn't enough. "Do you know where Mr. James went? We should let him know about this. He might have a good solution."

"You're quite the fan, aren’t you?" Sophia teased, causing Sam to stammer, "No, Miss Smith, don’t get me wrong. I just—"

"Relax," she waved him off with a grin. "He's busy, probably doesn’t have time for us right now. We need to learn to fend for ourselves." With that, she shut down the computer and stood, pacing toward the window, gazing at the stormy sky. After a moment of contemplation, she sighed. "But you're right; we should at least give him a heads-up."

Hearing this, Sam let out a deep sigh of relief. "You're wise, Miss Smith."

Sophia mused inwardly, wondering why she felt like things would crash and burn if she were in charge. She wasn’t clueless; she just didn’t need to flaunt it often.

Despite the conversation ending on a polite note, Sophia decided to take action. She turned to the imposing figure of the mech and asked, "Who's in charge right now?"

It felt off, like talking to a penguin or something absurd.

The mech, known as Vortex, looked down at her with a rigid tone. "It's me."

"And you are?" Sophia asked innocently.

"…"

"Alright, enough joking around," she said, her expression turning serious. "You're aware, right? The quantum people are closing in on us, and I felt something was off while watching the footage." She speculated, "They brought a lot of strange tools, and I suspect they have ulterior motives."

Vortex, or rather Ethan, remained silent after hearing her analysis, staying quiet for a long time. Finally, he said, "You don’t need to worry about this. I’ll take you away from here. Let them handle it on their own…"

"I want to give it a try," Sophia interrupted him. "I can’t rely on you for everything. You can’t always think I can’t survive without you. You gave me these powers, didn’t you? Even if things get tough, I can still protect myself."

Ethan disagreed flatly. "You can’t even cure your own illness. No negotiations. We’re leaving now."

As he reached out to take her away, Sophia didn’t resist but asked, "Are you going to use Vortex to take me somewhere else or to find you?"

Without hesitation, he replied, "Somewhere else."

"Then I’m not going," Sophia countered, giving him two options. "Either take me to find you or let go."

"Sophia Smith, can you not be so stubborn?" Ethan sounded genuinely exasperated, as if she had pushed him too far. Recently, he had been too lenient with her, allowing her this audacity to openly defy him. "I said you can't go."

Sophia, unable to tolerate it any longer, dodged Ethan’s mechanical hand and stepped back, fists clenched defiantly. Though she didn’t openly argue back, her entire posture screamed her discontent.

He never seemed to consider his own stubbornness. He could come and go as he pleased, and sending her to his side was one thing, but moving her to another location—what was the point? Did he think her world was just a playground, something to be entered and exited at will?

There were other issues too, but she didn't want to dwell on that.

Sophia looked up at the sky helplessly and said, "Do whatever you want. Send me wherever you like; after all, you're the boss. This relationship of ours is more like a puppet show, with only you enjoying the thrill."

Ethan remained frozen in place for a moment, his towering figure unmoving. Just as Sophia was starting to get annoyed with the wait, he transformed into a jet and took off, leaving behind the words, "I won’t care about you anymore…"

Sophia stared blankly at the direction he disappeared, feeling utterly helpless.

She wasn’t sure if this was being melodramatic or not, but she felt uncomfortable. There were some things she had heard, but her silence wasn’t due to indifference; she just didn’t want to argue with him. Yet, it seemed like they still ended up fighting.

She thought Ethan was just speaking out of anger, but he truly didn’t come looking for her for the next three or four days until Sam found her with urgent news.

"Miss Smith, the quantum troops up ahead might be providing cover; the real main force should be another group!" Sam said anxiously. "Have you been able to contact Mr. James? What did he say?"

Sophia shot him a sideways glance. "I reached him; he doesn’t care about us anymore."

"…What?" Sam's expression turned bewildered in an instant.

Sophia stood up with a sense of resignation, grabbing the gun from the table and loading it. "To be precise, he doesn’t care about me anymore." She took a deep breath. "Take me to see where this so-called main force is."

Sam hesitated for a moment. "I suspect that troop is led by Deputy Charlie… Charlie Ash. He knows the ins and outs of atomic structures, so it’s easy for him to infiltrate." He thought for a moment. "From what we’ve gathered, this troop includes not only Charlie Ash but also Alice from the ions. The rest of the personnel are uncertain; it's hard to tell if they involve any molecules."

"Her again?" Sophia ground her teeth. "Fine, we should take care of her first. I can’t feel at ease knowing she’s still alive."

"Miss Smith…" Sam looked pained, wanting to say something, but Sophia interrupted his lengthy lecture. "It’s better to take me directly there than to talk about it." With that, she turned and walked out, prompting Sam to stare at her tall, slender figure in shock before hurriedly following behind.

Charlie moved quickly, presumably worried about his sister, and teamed up with others again.

Sophia watched the monitor screen. Although the details were hard to make out, she could confirm that it was Charlie and Alice. The other figures following them were unfamiliar, but judging by their movements, they were all elite-level fighters.

"There are a total of twenty of them," Sam reported.

"How many can we deploy on our side? Comparable in combat strength."

Sam frowned. "Because most of our people are on the front lines, we have a fixed number at the base, and they can’t be moved, so…"

"In other words, we have no one?" Sophia slapped him lightly, nearly knocking off his hat. "I asked how many; I didn’t want a lecture."

Regaining his hat, Sam awkwardly replied, "I estimate it shouldn’t be more than ten."

"…That’s half the number we need."

"That’s only if we’re moving all the personnel assigned to protect you."

"Forget it." Sophia gritted her teeth. "You stay here and choose five capable ones to come with me." She slipped a mini wireless receiver into her ear. "If there’s any new information, let me know immediately."

Sam seemed anxious. "This isn’t right. It’s too dangerous! If Mr. James finds out…"

"Mr. James, Mr. James, Mr. James! Can you stop mentioning him at every turn? Since I’m willing to do this, it means I can handle it. I won’t joke with my life. If you don’t believe me, feel free to send me out alone." Sophia said, storming off without a care for whether Sam would actually let her go without backup.

How could Sam disregard her safety? He not only brought in ten people but also followed her.

In truth, he had been overly pessimistic. With Sophia’s powers combined with the handgun, she was practically unstoppable. On their way, zombies and enemies were easily pushed back. Sam watched, finally feeling reassured.

Indeed, those who followed Mr. James were not weaklings. He couldn’t understand why Mr. James always thought Sophia couldn’t survive without him. What about the rest of the world?

Sam didn’t grasp that once a man falls in love with a woman, he often believes she cannot thrive without him.

Sophia wiped the blood splattered across her face, gazing at the approaching figures of Charlie and his team. They were down to less than ten now, their numbers dwindled, ensuring their loss was imminent.

Sophia breathed a sigh of relief, finally feeling she had accomplished something. Although there were still significant challenges ahead, she had at least proven she wasn’t totally useless. She had the ability to protect herself, even if the one who gave her that ability was Ethan.

"Sophia Smith?" Alice spotted her instantly, her frame slender and tall in the hooded cloak. Sophia couldn’t help but grimace; what kind of ridiculous outfit was that for battle? Was she really going for a Mary Sue vibe, believing she could win despite such impractical attire?

"Miss Alice," Sophia raised her gun, standing firm in front of her team, her expression cold. "It’s time to say goodbye." Without waiting for Alice to respond, she pulled the trigger, and those with Charlie instinctively dodged, moving away from Alice.

Not exactly a united front, were they? It seemed like nobody cared about An Jun; they were all too eager to distance themselves from Alice.

Sophia couldn’t find the words to express her current feelings. Her bullet didn’t utilize her powers, but it struck Alice, blood seeping from her shoulder as she stared at Sophia, pale and shocked.

"Consider this shot as repayment," Sophia gritted her teeth. "From now on, we owe each other nothing."

Sophia snorted. "You owe me too much. You poisoned the water supply back with the molecules, didn’t you? After all those 'good deeds,' do you think a single shot can settle the score?"

Alice's eyes widened in disbelief. "How did you know?"

"I know far more than you think." As Sophia approached, she glanced at Charlie. "Mr. Ash, you might want to stay put. I’ll take care of your sister’s issue shortly. I promise she’ll be safe."

Xiao Yaya must have been relocated by Ethan; otherwise, Charlie wouldn’t have made that promise if she were in danger. Sophia felt confident Alice wouldn’t pull any tricks since she trusted Ethan’s abilities.

As expected, upon hearing this, Charlie halted, his followers stopped in their tracks. Alice’s personal guards dwindled to four or five, each formidable in their own right.

"Alright then," Alice sighed. "Let’s settle our debts today." She gripped her gun, aiming it at Sophia.

Sophia had no intention of letting her point it at her, so the moment Alice moved, she fired again, this time using her powers.

A tremendous explosion erupted, throwing the scene into chaos. Alice barely dodged, almost losing her life due to her own subordinates.

"When did you get this kind of ability?!" Alice stared at Sophia in disbelief.

Sophia ignored her, continuing to fire. The ensuing melee was chaotic, making it hard to distinguish friend from foe, likely due to some kind of bullet infused with hallucinogens.

With narrowed eyes, Sophia targeted Alice amidst the confusion. Her hands were sore from firing so rapidly, yet she pushed through the tremors and aimed at Alice, who was currently engaged with Sam.

It was a fatal shot. It seemed destiny had decreed that Alice’s life could only be ended by her. Ethan had made several attempts on her life before, but this time, Sophia truly killed her.

Alice's face was a mask of shock as she clutched her gun, slowly collapsing to the ground. Her guards were all captured by Sam’s men.

Charlie stood to the side, watching the scene unfold with a complex expression in his eyes as he regarded Sophia.

Sophia approached Alice's body, reflecting on everything she had encountered since arriving in this world, feeling as if she were in a dream.

She felt a bit dazed, but it didn’t stop her from noticing a rush of air whizzing past her ear, the sharp sound of bullets colliding ringing painfully in her ears. She quickly sidestepped, realizing a tree behind her had been felled, two bullets embedded deep in its trunk.

Two bullets?

Sophia followed the trajectory of one bullet back to its source, spotting Ethan’s tall figure emerging from the shadows. He expressionlessly held his gun, firing accurately in her direction without so much as a blink, his focus unwavering.

Sam watched as bullets zipped through the grass, screams erupting around them, the scent of blood saturating the air. Clearly, many had been ambushed there.

"Mr. James!" Sam was overjoyed at the sight of Ethan, rushing forward to say something, but Ethan simply bypassed him and approached Sophia, casting her a sidelong glance. "Seems like everything’s under control. If that’s the case, why rush me back? You made me worry for nothing."

Was this a reconciliation? Sophia forced a smile that didn’t reach her eyes, then turned her head stoically toward Charlie. "The person you were looking for has arrived. Why don’t you ask about your sister’s whereabouts?"

As for Ethan… she felt their relationship had become far too harmonious, transcending all boundaries, and it definitely needed some adjustments.
