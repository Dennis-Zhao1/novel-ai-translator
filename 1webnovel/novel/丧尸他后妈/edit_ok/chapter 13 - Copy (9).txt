Chapter 13: The Parting Decision

Sophia Carter found herself once again in the clinical sterility of Ethan's lab, a place that had become all too familiar yet no less intimidating. He silently handed her a casual outfit—a black sleeveless tank top and denim shorts—and gestured towards the bathroom.

When she emerged, freshly washed and barefoot, a pair of flat sandals awaited her by the door.

Sophia hesitated, feeling a knot of unease tighten in her chest as she slipped them on. The clothes and shoes fit perfectly, as if custom-made, which only added to her anxiety.

Her eyes drifted to Ethan, who was busy organizing equipment at a large workbench. His tall frame was slightly hunched as he packed items into a compact suitcase: a custom silver handgun, vials of liquid, packets of compressed food, and various other supplies. He moved with his usual detached efficiency, but there was an underlying tension, as though he was trying to distract himself.

Sophia's gaze lingered on the suitcase. Were these supplies meant for her? Or someone else?

Her thoughts twisted into something sour as she watched him tuck a handheld gaming console into the bag, followed by yet another stash of food. A sharp pang of irritation bloomed in her chest.

Was this for another person? Someone she didn’t know about?

She caught herself frowning and quickly smoothed her expression. But Ethan's sharp eyes missed nothing. Turning back to her, he raised an eyebrow as he closed the case with a deliberate snap.

“Done brooding?” he asked with a touch of humor, though his tone was pointed.

Sophia flinched, a blush rising to her cheeks. “I, uh… Thanks for the clothes and shoes,” she mumbled, turning on her heel. “I should get going.”

But Ethan was already at her side. With a swift motion, he placed the suitcase handle in her hand.

“Take it,” he said simply. “It has everything you’ll need. Weapons, supplies, and enough food to get you where you’re going.”

Before she could protest, he looped a string with a key around her neck. She blinked up at him, stunned.

“The black car parked out front is yours. Don’t mix it up with anything else,” he added.

Sophia stared at the key and then at Ethan. Was this really for her?

He wasn’t done. He pulled out a tablet, its screen already displaying a detailed navigation program. His long fingers swiped across the screen as he explained the route.

“Follow this exactly,” he said, his voice steady and calm. “If you deviate, I can’t guarantee you’ll survive long, no matter how well-supplied you are.”

Sophia hesitantly accepted the tablet, her mind racing.

Ethan handed her a small bottle of water and a single pill. “Take this before you leave.”

Sophia eyed the pill suspiciously. “What’s this for?”

“Just something to keep you healthy,” he replied, leaning back against the counter and taking a sip of coffee.

Her face went crimson. For a moment, she couldn’t tell if she was more embarrassed or annoyed.

After a long pause, she muttered, “Right…” and swallowed the pill under his watchful gaze.

With everything in hand, she turned toward the door.

“Thanks,” she said softly, her tone unsure, before stepping out into the corridor.

Ethan didn’t reply. He stood motionless as the sound of her footsteps faded. The moment the door shut behind her, he exhaled deeply and slammed a nearby cabinet shut with a bang.

An Unexpected Return

Minutes passed. Then the door creaked open again.

Ethan turned, surprise etched on his face as he saw Sophia standing there, her expression a mix of guilt and determination.

“Forgot something?” he asked, masking his lingering frustration with sarcasm.

Sophia shook her head, clutching the tablet tightly. “No. I just… I didn’t catch where the navigation ends. The markers don’t make sense.”

Ethan’s surprise shifted into exasperation. He grabbed a large sheet of paper from the desk—an intricate map scrawled with lines, symbols, and notes—and laid it out on the table.

“It’s here,” he said, pointing to a large red circle on the map.

Sophia leaned in, squinting at the jumble of letters and notations that surrounded it. None of it made any sense to her.

Ethan noticed her confusion and sighed, rubbing his temples. “I overestimated how clear this would be,” he murmured.

Sophia’s jaw dropped. “Excuse me?!”

Ethan didn’t miss a beat. “I should have explained it better,” he said dryly, picking up a pen to write clearer labels over the map.

“Or maybe if you weren’t so cryptic all the time—”

“The point is,” Ethan interrupted, “this route leads to one of the safest areas currently available. Whether you make it there depends on how closely you follow the plan.”

Sophia peered at the now-legible map. “This is… ‘Fenris’?” she read aloud.

“Yes,” Ethan confirmed, his tone neutral.

Sophia studied his face, searching for any sign of deception. She didn’t trust him—not entirely. After all, this was the same man who had inadvertently caused the apocalyptic scenario they were now in. Why would he suddenly care about her survival?

“…Why are you helping me?” she asked cautiously.

Ethan’s dark eyes met hers, his expression unreadable. “You wouldn’t understand,” he said at last, turning away.

Sophia hesitated. The weight of his response felt heavier than the suitcase in her hand. Without another word, she turned and left, her mind a whirlwind of doubt and suspicion.

As she drove away in the black car, Ethan stood at the window of his lab, watching her taillights fade into the distance. For a fleeting moment, his stoic mask cracked, revealing something raw and unresolved beneath.

But when the car disappeared completely, Ethan turned away, retreating to his underground lab.

In the car, Sophia gripped the steering wheel tightly, glancing at the tablet’s glowing screen.

“Fenris…” she murmured. Was it really safe? Or was she driving straight into another one of Ethan’s plans?

She didn’t have an answer. But one thing was certain—this wasn’t the last she’d see of him. Not by a long shot.
