Chapter 5: The Unthinkable Bargain

"Did you know that physical intimacy can actually reduce stress?" Ethan said, his voice matter-of-fact, as though he were discussing the weather. "It's scientifically proven to help with tension."

Ivy Smith blinked at him, utterly speechless. It took her a moment to find her voice. "Uh... okay?"

Her reaction seemed to amuse him. Ethan's sharp, icy blue eyes lingered on her, a flicker of curiosity in his gaze. Then he looked down and added, "Apologies."

Ivy barely managed a sigh of relief before he continued, "I'll start now."

"What?! Wait a minute!" Ivy exclaimed, backing up and crossing her arms defensively. "What do you mean 'start'?!"

Ethan stood, towering over her with an air of calm detachment. His lips curled into a faint, unreadable smile. "Playing coy, are we?"

"..."

"Alright." Ethan reached into his pocket and pulled out a small vial, holding it up between his thumb and forefinger. "Let me clarify, Ivy. I only need you alive—how you remain that way is up to you." He leaned in, bringing the vial closer to her face. "You wanted this, remember?"

Ivy's heart raced as her eyes fixated on the small vial. Before she could grab it, Ethan reached into his other pocket and, like a magician revealing a trick, produced a larger vial—twice the size of the first.

Her gaze flickered between the two vials, her desire barely contained. She forced herself to maintain composure, her voice tight with barely controlled anticipation. "I... never said I wanted to live forever."

Ethan chuckled, the unexpected warmth of his laugh sending a shiver down her spine.

Then, without warning, he tossed both vials to the ground.

The sound of shattering glass was deafening in the silence, and the precious liquid spread across the floor like spilled jewels.

"No!" Ivy's breath caught as she watched the serum mix with shards of glass and dirt.

Ethan straightened, dusting his hands off casually. "If you're so eager to tempt fate, be my guest." He turned toward the door. "Try not to linger too long."

Ivy's frustration boiled over. Months of effort, gone in seconds? No way.

"Wait!" she barked, diving to the floor. Ignoring the mess, she scanned the ground, desperate to salvage even a drop.

Ethan's voice floated back to her, calm and teasing. "You'd better hurry. That serum evaporates quickly." His footsteps approached, deliberate and slow. "Go ahead. I have plenty more where that came from."

Ivy froze, glaring at the floor. His tall frame loomed over her, casting a shadow that swallowed her small form. Her hair, damp and messy, clung to her face as she clenched her fists.

Her pride battled with her survival instincts, but deep down, she knew there was no turning back. I messed up the moment I left Quantum Base, she thought bitterly.

The Bargain

Ivy slowly stood, arms crossed protectively over her chest. "Fine," she said quietly, her voice trembling with both anger and resignation. "I'll agree."

Ethan's gaze sharpened, his smile widening slightly. "Good," he said.

"But," Ivy added quickly, "I have conditions."

Ethan raised an eyebrow, his expression calm but tinged with faint amusement. "Oh? And what might those be?"

"You give me enough serum to guarantee my safety, and when this is over, you let me go," she said firmly, her words tumbling out in a rush.

Ethan tilted his head, his dark eyes narrowing slightly. Then, as if humoring her, he gave a small shrug. "Your demands are high. That's two conditions, but alright. I can agree—on one condition of my own."

He crouched, bringing his face level with hers. The intensity in his gaze made her want to flinch, but she held steady.

"My condition is simple," Ethan continued, his voice low and steady. "You won't be forced into anything. But if you agree, you'll follow my lead. Do we have a deal?"

Ivy hesitated, her heart pounding. Her instincts screamed at her to run, but there was nowhere to go. Refusing him would mean risking everything.

Finally, she nodded, her throat dry.

"Good," Ethan said, standing and heading for the door. "Follow me."

Ivy wrapped her arms around herself as she stood. She felt exposed, vulnerable, and utterly at his mercy. But Ethan didn't glance back, walking ahead as though he had already won.

They entered a room hidden behind rows of advanced machinery. The space was stark and cold, dominated by a single narrow bed and a desk cluttered with scientific equipment.

"Lie down," Ethan instructed, his tone as casual as ever.

Ivy's hands tightened into fists. She had agreed, but the reality of the situation made her stomach churn. Still, she couldn't back out now. Slowly, she stepped toward the bed, each step feeling heavier than the last.

"Wait," she said, her voice shaky.

Ethan paused, turning his head slightly.

"I... I want your word," Ivy said, her voice gaining strength despite the fear twisting her insides. "When this is over, you'll let me go. No tricks."

Ethan tilted his head, considering her demand. "I don't make promises," he said finally. "But I'll honor our agreement—for now."

It wasn't perfect, but it was enough. Ivy took a deep breath and forced herself to step closer to the bed.

Ivy hesitated, standing rigidly by the narrow bed. Her fists clenched and unclenched at her sides as if her body were wrestling with itself. Every instinct told her to run, but her rational mind knew it was pointless.

Ethan remained calm, unbuttoning his shirt without a hint of urgency. His movements were precise, methodical, and oddly mesmerizing, as if even the act of disrobing was part of a calculated plan.

"Take your time," he said smoothly, his gaze briefly flicking to her. "Rushing tends to ruin results."

Ivy exhaled shakily, forcing herself to climb onto the bed. The cold metal frame creaked slightly under her weight, and the clinical sterility of the room made her feel even more out of place.

"Comfortable?" he asked casually, his tone making it clear the question was rhetorical.

Ivy didn't answer, her gaze fixed on the ceiling. Her heart pounded in her chest, and her palms felt clammy.

Ethan stepped closer, his shadow falling over her like a dark veil. "Last chance to change your mind," he said, his voice quiet but firm.

"I won't," Ivy replied, her tone steadier than she expected.

He nodded, accepting her decision without further comment. Slowly, he reached toward her, his hands moving with the same clinical precision he displayed earlier.

A Shift in the Atmosphere

Ivy flinched slightly at the first contact, her body tense and rigid. But Ethan didn't rush. His movements were slow and deliberate, his hands surprisingly cool against her skin.

"This is a waste of time," she muttered under her breath, mostly to herself.

Ethan's lips curved into a faint smirk. "Time is the only resource I can afford to waste."

Despite his words, there was no malice in his touch. It was almost mechanical, as though he were cataloging her reactions for some unseen experiment.

The silence in the room was oppressive, broken only by the occasional sound of shifting fabric or faint creaks from the bed. For Ivy, every second felt like an eternity.

"You're trembling," Ethan remarked, his voice as calm as ever.

Ivy gritted her teeth, forcing herself to meet his gaze. "What did you expect?"

His head tilted slightly, as if genuinely curious. "Not fear. You're not the type to cower. So what is it?"

Ivy blinked, caught off guard by his observation. "I'm... human," she muttered. "And this is... a lot."

For the first time, Ethan paused. His sharp, calculating gaze softened ever so slightly, and he leaned back, studying her expression with an intensity that made her skin crawl.

"Fascinating," he murmured, almost to himself.

The Unexpected Outcome

But just as the tension seemed poised to snap, a sharp, mechanical beep shattered the quiet. Ethan turned his head toward a monitor on the far wall, his brows knitting together in irritation.

"What now?" he muttered, stepping away from the bed.

Ivy's body sagged in relief as the interruption gave her a reprieve. She sat up slightly, watching as Ethan strode to the monitor. His fingers flew across a keypad, and a series of holographic graphs and data streams lit up the screen.

His expression darkened. "Intruders."

Ivy froze. "Intruders? Where?"

"Near the perimeter of this facility," Ethan replied, his tone clipped. His attention was wholly on the screen, his earlier focus on her now completely gone. "Your father's men, most likely."

Ivy's pulse quickened. "Are they looking for me?"

"Perhaps," Ethan said, his voice distant. "Or perhaps they've grown tired of hiding behind their walls and decided to test their luck."

He turned back to her, his expression unreadable. "Your presence complicates things."

Ivy felt a spark of defiance rise within her. "You dragged me here!"

"And yet," Ethan said smoothly, "your survival depends entirely on my choices."

Before she could retort, he strode to the door. "Stay here," he commanded, his tone leaving no room for argument. "Unless you're eager to see just how effective your vial is against a bullet."

The door closed behind him with a soft click, leaving Ivy alone in the sterile room.

A New Resolve

Ivy's gaze drifted to the serum vial still clutched in her hand. Her thoughts raced. Ethan was distracted, and now might be her only chance to escape.

But where would I go?

Her mind flashed to Quantum Base, to her father, to the zombies she’d narrowly escaped earlier. Her situation was dire, but she couldn’t afford to give up now.

Taking a deep breath, she swung her legs off the bed and stood. Her knees wobbled, but determination steadied her.

"If I can’t outsmart him," she muttered, clutching the vial tighter, "I’ll have to outlast him."
