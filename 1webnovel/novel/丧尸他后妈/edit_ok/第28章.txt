**Chapter**

"Why worry about forever?" Ethan murmured, breaking the heavy silence that lay between them. "In this chaotic world, who can truly promise forever? The person you saw yesterday could vanish tomorrow, leaving only memories behind. We never know when a goodbye becomes the last farewell. But... if staying together were possible, who wouldn't wish for a lifetime without parting?"

Sophia Smith lowered her gaze to the ground, her fingers clutching the swing's chains tightly. A soft blush spread across her cheeks, and she remained silent, avoiding the atmosphere that surrounded them. Her legs gently pushed against the ground, leaving faint imprints in the dust as if she were hesitant to face reality.

Ethan crouched beside her, leaning in to catch a glimpse of her profile. His eyes traced her soft hair, attempting to read the emotions hidden beneath her lowered brow. Yet, he was drawn in by a tender but intense magnetism. His hands cautiously wrapped around her waist, gentle and restrained, as if fearing she might slip away or he might lose control.

"Why are you looking down?" His voice was low and soft, almost a whisper, testing the waters.

"Nothing," Sophia replied quietly, still not lifting her head. The tips of her ears had turned a faint pink.

Ethan’s gaze swept over her, a mix of emotions swirling within him as if he had more to say. Ultimately, he drew a little closer, arms tightening softly around her, pulling her just a bit nearer. His movements were slow, as if waiting for her response or holding himself back.

"Sophia," he said softly, his voice warm and sincere, "do you think I’m trying to take advantage of you by getting closer?"

"...Isn't that the case?" She finally raised her head, her eyes clear yet laced with a hint of defiance, locking onto his.

Ethan was taken aback for a moment, then let out a soft chuckle. "Maybe. But what if I told you I'm close to you because I'm afraid of losing you? Would you believe me?"

Sophia didn’t respond, simply gazing at him, as if waiting for a deeper explanation.

He lowered his gaze, a complex tone threading through his words. "This world is falling apart. People disappear every day. I'm not afraid of that, but I fear you might vanish like they do."

An invisible weight hung in the air, much like the cool night breeze that brushed past the swing, yet it felt stifling, as if breathing became a chore.

"Are you afraid of me leaving, or are you scared I might hate you?" Sophia's voice was barely above a whisper, yet it jolted Ethan, causing him to lift his head sharply. His eyes sparkled like a starry night, revealing an inner turmoil intertwined with deep affection.

"I don't know," Ethan admitted after a long pause. "Maybe it’s both."

Sophia was momentarily taken aback, her instinctive retort caught in her throat. Looking at the man who usually exuded confidence and decisiveness, she was surprised to see such vulnerability etched on his face. A whirlwind of complex emotions surged within her, leaving her unsure of how to respond.

"Please don’t do this," she said softly, lowering her eyes. "You make it... hard for me to know what to do."

Ethan hesitated for a moment, his hand lingering before he finally let go of her. He stepped back, his gaze a blend of emotions as he murmured, "I'm sorry. I didn’t mean to put you in a tough spot."

Sophia raised her head, watching as he turned to walk into the encroaching darkness. A sudden impulse to call out to him surged within her, but she held her tongue, her grip tightening on the swing's chains. The cool breeze swept across her cheeks, carrying away the warmth that lingered between them.
