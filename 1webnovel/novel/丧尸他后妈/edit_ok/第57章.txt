**Out of options?** Sophia Smith asked softly, her eyes lifting to meet Jake's. His expression was a bit off, but that playful smirk still lingered at the corner of his mouth.

“What do you think?” Jake squinted, his smile laced with a hint of playful sarcasm.

Sophia tilted her head slightly, pretending to ponder for a moment, then pouted as she nestled closer into his embrace, her tone teasingly coy. “That couch is too small; there’s only room for you.”

“The living room has a bigger couch,” Jake murmured in reply, his voice low and casually indifferent.

“No thanks.” She glanced up at him, her gaze drifting to the coffee table nearby. “Let’s just use this one.”

“You’re not up to something, are you?” Jake raised an eyebrow, a teasing lilt in his voice.

“Of course not!” Sophia feigned innocence, grabbing his hand and tilting her chin defiantly. “If you don’t believe me, you can check for yourself.”

Jake looked down at her, a glint of mischief flashing in his eyes. He spoke slowly, a smirk creeping onto his lips. “Sorry, it’s too quiet here; I can’t feel anything.”

Sophia was momentarily speechless, her cheeks flushing a bright red. She shot him a fierce glare. “You act like you’re above it, but your hands tell a different story.”

Jake's smile widened, clearly enjoying her fluster. “So, what’s your plan?”

“Hmph!” Not one to back down, Sophia raised her hand and snapped the handcuff around his wrist, arching her eyebrow playfully. “You did this to me before. Now, let’s see how it feels to be on the other side!”

Jake shot her a sidelong glance, his demeanor still composed, not showing a hint of struggle. His eyes gleamed with mockery as he scoffed, “Anyone can talk big. But every time it comes down to it, don’t you always end up admitting defeat?”

“Not this time!” She lifted her chin stubbornly, her voice brimming with defiance.

“Is that so?” Jake let out a soft laugh, his gaze sweeping over her movements. “I’ll be watching.”

She pushed him back onto the coffee table, bracing her hands on either side of him, an air of triumph in her demeanor. “This time, I want you to truly feel what it means to be out of control.”

Jake regarded her, his gaze tinged with something complex. He spoke softly, “You know, some things you only realize whether you regret them once you truly let go and act.”

Sophia paused, momentarily taken aback, not knowing how to respond. Instead, she leaned in closer. Their faces drew nearer, and she could feel his breath against her skin; his eyes roamed her face without flinching.

“Do you like me?” she asked suddenly, her voice as light as a whisper, yet striking deep into his heart.

Jake didn’t answer. He simply gazed at her, his eyes deep enough to send a ripple of unease through her.

In that moment, time seemed to freeze. The distance between them no longer mattered, and the surrounding noise faded into the background. They stared into each other’s eyes, as if waiting for an unspoken answer to a question that hung heavily in the air.
