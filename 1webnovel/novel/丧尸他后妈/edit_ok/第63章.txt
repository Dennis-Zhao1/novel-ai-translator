Ethan was driving way too fast, swerving wildly, making it incredibly hard for Jack and the others following him. They struggled to keep up all the way to the research facility, and many of them, who usually didn't get carsick, were feeling queasy from the ride. It made them wonder just how Ivy was holding up inside the car.

That worry seemed unnecessary, though. Although Ethan could be quite brash at times, he never neglected Ivy.

Jack saw Ethan carrying Ivy as he stepped out of the driver's seat. Without sparing a glance at them, Ethan headed straight into the facility, which was guarded by security personnel. His demeanor was so dismissive it made the self-proclaimed victorious team members want to throw up their hands in frustration, but they kept their thoughts to themselves.

“How many medical staff do you need?” Jack asked, trying to suppress his anger at being ignored and forcing himself to sound friendly.

Ethan carefully laid Ivy down on the examination table and glanced at Jack and the others behind him. After a moment of thought, he said, “Not a single one. You all need to leave.”

“... Just you?” Jack replied, surprised. “With such serious injuries, you definitely need help...” If he didn’t need assistance, what was Jack supposed to do?

“You can test it yourself and see if I can handle this,” Ethan said with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. In a place where no one could see, he clenched his fists tightly, revealing just how anxious and desperate he truly was.

If Ivy didn’t make it, then everyone standing here—no, the entire world—would lose all meaning for him. He didn’t want to see any of them for even a second.

Of course, even if Ivy recovered, they wouldn’t be able to live in this world anymore.

Jack had no idea what was going through Ethan’s mind at that moment; otherwise, he would surely regret being involved in this mess.

“... Fine,” Jack said, his anger morphing into a mocking smile. “I’ll just watch what you do.” He turned and led the rest of the group away, feeling like a complete joke.

Ethan shot him a cold glare, and once they were all gone, he pressed a button under the examination table, locking the entire lab down.

How foolish of them to let him get close to the instruments and tools. Were they overly confident in their plans or just underestimating him?

Those who don’t leave themselves an escape route are usually either overly confident or incredibly foolish. Ethan belonged to the former category, while Jack was clearly in the latter.

Ethan let out a slow breath, using a cloth to wipe the blood off Ivy's face. He frowned, staring intently at her wounds. For a moment, he seemed helpless against the equipment in the lab, which was quite rare for him.

After about three minutes, he tossed the cloth aside and moved to the workbench to prepare the necessary tools.

This lab was one he had used before, equipped with most of the items he needed. However, the medications stored here were ineffective against the newly developed threats. That was what made him feel stuck.

Annoyingly, he couldn’t leave now; there just wasn’t enough time.

Ethan gripped a test tube, deep in thought as he worked. Suddenly, his eyes widened, a flicker of light flashing in his dark irises.

When Ivy woke up, the pain had faded completely. She felt numb all over—not just her injured shoulder, but also her arms and legs, which were stiff and unresponsive.

Blinking in confusion, she struggled to remember everything that had happened before she lost consciousness. Was she not dead?

With great effort, she examined her surroundings. In her line of sight stood Ethan, straight-backed, and the various instruments confirming the environment she was in.

It was a lab. Ethan was right there next to her, and she was alive.

Realizing this made her heart race with excitement. She wanted to sit up and hug him, to say something, but when she opened her mouth, no sound came out. Her throat was sore, and there was a metallic taste of blood in her mouth. She thought it was from the blood loss from her shoulder, but her gaze landed on Ethan's bandaged wrist, and her eyes widened in shock.

“…” She tried, but it was futile. Ivy let her eyelids droop in defeat, unable to voice the words she wanted to say.

Ethan looked down at her, his gaze unwavering. His long hair obscured his eyes, and a light stubble adorned his sharp chin. His usually pristine white lab coat was stained with blood, but he had kept her well protected. Surrounding her was a glass shield of some kind, while everything else around him was clean and orderly, contrasting sharply with his disheveled appearance.

When Ethan saw Ivy open her eyes, he let out a sigh of relief. He noticed her trying to speak but failing miserably, and a tired smile crept across his face as he softly said, “Just lie still; you’ll be fine soon.”

“…” Okay. Ivy looked back at him, trying to convey her confusion through her eyes—what happened to your wrist?

Ethan seemed to understand her question but chose not to respond. He simply said, “I’ll go clean myself up,” before walking away.

Ivy watched his retreating figure disappear from her sight and, after a brief moment of daze, succumbed to fatigue and fell asleep again.

When she woke up for the second time, the scenery around her had changed once more.

This time, she wasn’t in the lab anymore. She felt her body again, and her clothes were clean, as was her injured shoulder. The wound was slightly itchy, likely healing, making it seem like all her problems had been resolved. But… where was Ethan?

Ivy quickly sat up, her mind racing. She shook her head vigorously, squinting at her surroundings until her blurry vision gradually cleared, revealing Jack’s impassive face.

“Is it you?” Ivy asked, her heart filled with an ominous premonition.

Jack chuckled lightly. “Disappointed to see me?”

Ignoring his mockery, Ivy went straight to the point. “Where is he?”

“Who are you asking about?” Jack pretended to be clueless before suddenly realizing. “You mean Mr. Ethan, right?”

Ivy couldn't help but regard him with a perplexed expression. “Are you really my father?”

The answer was clearly no.

But in a way, he was.

Jack’s face darkened at the question, and he stiffly replied, “Since you’ve asked, I’ll prove that I still consider you my daughter.” He turned and calmly instructed those around him, “Prepare a wheelchair. Take the young lady to see our genius.”

Numbly, Ivy lowered her head and sat in the wheelchair that was prepared for her, silently allowing him to push her along with Jack.

After leaving the room, they walked about five hundred feet down the corridor before turning into a room at the end. The door was clearly reinforced, looking exceptionally sturdy. Ivy had only seen such doors in sci-fi movies, as Ethan always used transparent glass doors, making it seem like his location was impenetrable.

“Ready?” Jack smirked sarcastically.

Ivy didn’t respond but nodded, choosing not to look at him; what she couldn’t see wouldn’t trouble her.

Jack frowned but was too excited to care. He swung the door open, revealing the scene inside.

The room was spacious, with a large glass enclosure in the center. Ethan sat inside, dressed in a shirt and slacks, staring down at the floor, his hands clasped over his knees, looking very frail.

He didn’t look up when the door opened, seemingly indifferent to who had entered, as if it didn’t matter who came there.

Jack looked triumphantly at Ivy. “So, do you see now that only your father is someone you should rely on?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ethan lifted his head, locking eyes with Ivy through the multiple barriers. She, sitting in the wheelchair, stared back at him, both of them struck by an unspoken understanding.

So, is the modern villain embarrassed to be trapped in a glass cage? Ethan certainly looked the part, fitting the Hollywood blockbuster vibe, even if Jack’s performance was lacking.

“Go ahead, here’s your chance. Don’t say I’m heartless,” Jack said as he noticed Ivy’s silence. He generously added, “As long as you admit your mistake and obediently stay by my side, I’ll pretend nothing ever happened. What do you say?”

Ivy glanced at him coolly and asked, “Does that include telling you everything about Ethan and his secrets?”

Jack hesitated, clearly caught off guard by her statement, but he quickly regained his composure, his expression chilling. “It’s better to have the conversation out in the open. Since you know, you’d better be smart about it. Otherwise, your wounds will serve as your lesson.”

Ivy looked down at her left shoulder. The wound had been treated very well, and she no longer felt pain, but all of that was thanks to the man locked away.

If it weren’t for her, he would likely be doing just fine, secretly watching these mortals bring about their own chaotic destruction. He should have been an unbeatable boss, but because of her, he had fallen into this predicament.

Though Ethan seemed to have willingly put himself in this situation for a reason, she still felt a pang of guilt.

“Let’s forget about it.” Ivy said softly. “I’ll just continue to fall; don’t have too high hopes for me. If I agree to you, I’d feel like I’m betraying my conscience.”

“Conscience?” Jack glared at her. “If you had a conscience, you wouldn’t be with him! Do you even know who he is? So many have died at his hands, and our home has been destroyed by him! Do you even understand?!”

“…” That accusation was truly hard to respond to. Ivy thought for a moment, tilting her head. “Forget it; just pretend I didn’t say anything. My choice remains the same.”

Jack’s eyes widened in disbelief as he looked at her. “... Are you still the Ivy I know? What about your principles? Your sense of shame?!”

“Do I look like someone with principles and a sense of shame?” Ivy laughed suddenly, and while he was off guard, she grabbed his wrist. A strong jolt of electricity surged through Jack, causing him to collapse in shock, losing consciousness.

Unbeknownst to Jack, he had no idea that Ivy possessed such abilities. Aside from Ethan, it seemed only a few select individuals were aware of it.

Ivy let out a sigh of relief, her gaze drifting from the unconscious Jack to Ethan in the cage. He was staring at her, his eyes full of a pitiful longing, as if silently pleading for her help.

Ivy couldn’t help but laugh, holding back the ache in her legs as she propped herself on her arms to stand up from the wheelchair. She intended to figure out how to open the cage, but Ethan, seeing her stand, strode over and opened the cage door himself, walking out confidently.

“…” The weight of this stark reality was almost crushing.
