Could it be a scalpel? She instinctively thought so, but upon closer inspection, she realized it wasn't a scalpel at all—it was a pair of handcuffs!

"What are you trying to do?" Sarah Smith exclaimed in alarm, backing away until she rounded a few desks and positioned herself in front of the whiteboard, using the podium as a makeshift barrier between them.

"What am I trying to do?" Zack chuckled lightly, echoing her question. In just a few strides, he crossed to the other side of the podium and leaned in, effortlessly locking her wrist in place. It seemed as if he had planned this moment all along.

A mix of frustration and anger surged within her. She had thought she was far enough away, but she had underestimated his height and speed. Gritting her teeth, she struggled against the handcuffs, only to watch helplessly as he secured the other end to her wrist and tossed the key into a beaker on the lab table. The mysterious liquid inside began to corrode the key almost instantly, a grim foreshadowing of what could happen next.

"Weren't you asking what I wanted?" Zack closed the distance between them slowly, his voice low yet filled with a sense of danger. "I want you to remember that from today on, we're connected, whether you like it or not."

Sarah pressed her back against the whiteboard, a fire of rage igniting within her, but she dared not show it. "This is a school, not your territory! Outside, there are people who are looking for you! If you keep this up, I’ll—"

"Reveal my identity?" he interrupted, his tone dismissive. "You've had plenty of chances to say something, but you didn’t. Now, if you do, you’ll only be putting yourself in danger too."

He took a step closer, and she panicked, trying to sidestep him, but the handcuffs restricted her movements. Leaning in near her ear, he whispered, "Do you know why I came here? It’s for you. If you had just listened to me and not gone with those people, we would have left this place ages ago."

Sarah couldn’t help but retort, "Don’t put all the blame on me! You never planned to let me go, did you?"

Zack remained silent, his gaze fixed on her, those eyes as deep and inscrutable as the night sky. Slowly, he raised his hand and gently grasped her chin, forcing her to meet his intense stare. "I won’t deny that. But have you ever considered that without me, you might not be safe right now?"

Sarah froze, feeling his breath linger close to her ear, a pressure she couldn’t ignore. She tried to maintain her composure, but her voice trembled slightly, "What do you want from me?"

Zack chuckled softly, his laughter deep and raspy. "I just want you to understand that no matter where you go, I can always find you."

He rested his hand on her shoulder, leaning in closer. Sarah held her breath, her heart pounding like a drum. As she struggled to push him away, she felt her strength waning. The cold lab equipment around them reflected faint light, and a wave of despair washed over her.

"Don’t be afraid," Zack murmured, a hint of unexpected softness in his tone. "I won’t hurt you."

His hand slid down her shoulder, pulling her away from the whiteboard and toward the lab table. She stared intently at his face, searching for any hint of emotion, but his expression remained inscrutable. His gaze was too complex, as if he were stifling some hidden feeling.

"I won’t let anyone harm you, not even yourself," he said quietly, his calmness unnerving her.

In that moment, Sarah felt as if she was beginning to understand something, yet she couldn’t fully grasp it. Within her, a tumult of emotions churned: on one hand, fear, and on the other, an unsettling sense of dependency that she was reluctant to acknowledge.
