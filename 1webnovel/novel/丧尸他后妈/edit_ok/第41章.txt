Sophia Smith hadn’t managed to take a shower yet; it seemed something serious had happened at the base. By the time Ethan finished tidying up and stepped out, Charlie had already sent out an emergency summons, calling everyone to gather in the meeting room. With no choice, Sophia retracted her steps toward the bathroom, quickly washed her face, and wiped her hair before heading out the door.

Ethan glanced down at her, subtly shielding her from the wind with his body, and placed her slightly cold hands inside his jacket pockets to warm them up. When Sophia looked up at him, he gave her a reassuring smile, leaving her momentarily stunned.

They hadn’t walked for long before they arrived at the base’s meeting room. The room wasn’t very crowded, mainly filled with a few key figures from the organization, including James and others. Emily and Nate were presumably too injured to attend, and oddly enough, there was no sign of Connor, the governor of the base, which seemed rather unprofessional given the apparent importance of the meeting.

“Hey, you two.” Charlie greeted Ethan and Sophia with a rather neutral expression, his gaze towards Ethan complicated. He pressed his lips tightly together and sank heavily into a chair after exchanging pleasantries.

Charlie was undoubtedly the one hosting this meeting. He leaned both hands on the table, staring down at its surface as he slowly began, “The reason I called everyone here is to address some urgent matters. Emily and Miss Nate are currently recovering from their injuries, and with my elder brother looking after them, there’s no need for concern. They are both severely injured, but they’re out of immediate danger.” He suddenly turned to Ethan, “I hope Dr. Johnson will refrain from being so obstinate next time.”

Ethan showed no signs of backing down. In front of everyone, he directly retorted, “I do what I want. Why should you care?” His long, narrow eyes cast a disdainful glance at Charlie, casually twirling a pen on the table, exuding a calm and indifferent aura.

Charlie was momentarily taken aback, hesitating for a moment before responding softly, “I apologize; perhaps my wording was off, but this is, after all, a matter concerning the base. I hope Dr. Johnson can tone it down a little.”

Naturally, Ethan wasn’t going to tone it down. He wanted to say something, but Sophia suddenly grasped his hand, which had been spinning the pen with fervor. Ethan’s words caught in his throat, and he resigned himself to say instead, “I guess I’ll play nice this time.”

“Dr. Johnson still has a sense of reason,” Charlie forced a smile, giving a slight nod to Sophia. “Thank you.”

Thank you? A sense of reason? Ethan thought to himself that someday he would have a proper talk with Charlie about reasoning. The logic went something like this: 1. Screw you, 2. Damn you, 3. Wipe out your entire belief system… Ethan cast a mild glance at Charlie and changed hands to continue playing with the pen, this time mimicking a shooting stance with it aimed at Charlie.

Charlie sensed Ethan’s palpable hostility but couldn’t confront him about it. He suspected Ethan might be the one who attacked him, but he couldn’t find any evidence. The military doctor had been unable to locate any bullets in Nate and Emily’s bodies. Although both had survived, it was evident that something inside them was changing and slipping out of their control.

Charlie didn’t dare provoke Ethan; if he did, Ethan would undoubtedly confront him directly. Yet, if Ethan wasn’t the attacker, he not only would lose the chance to save Emily but would also gain a formidable enemy. Moreover, the base still needed Ethan’s help.

After careful consideration, Charlie put on a sincere smile and spoke in a smooth voice, “Dr. Johnson, the reason I brought you and Miss Smith here amidst your busy schedules is that we’ve encountered a mutation in the zombies at the reconnaissance area we visited earlier.”

Sophia looked at him, surprised. “Mutation?”

“Yes,” Charlie said, his brow furrowing as he clenched his fist. “For some reason, all the zombies we shot in the head have revived, which has never happened before.”

Ethan listened calmly to Charlie’s account, showing no outward signs of distress, but inside he was mentally berating Charlie for being indecisive and lacking intelligence. Staying here to waste time was ridiculous, yet… he glanced at Sophia and felt a twinge of reluctance. He had already invested so much time in her, and it would be a loss not to make it worthwhile.

“What do you plan to do, Deputy Governor Charlie?” James asked anxiously, his concern seeming somewhat forced.

Charlie sighed and subtly glanced at Ethan. “I haven’t thought of a good plan yet. Besides forcibly dispersing them again, I don’t know if such an event will happen again.”

Without any self-awareness, James turned to Ethan with an expectant look. “Doctor, you must have a solution!”

Ethan paused his pen spinning, looking at him, and spoke slowly, “Call me Doctor.”

“…” James looked bewildered for a moment before replying, “Oh, Doctor…”

“Very well.” Ethan stood up and addressed Charlie, “Once you’re done here, I’ll be leaving. She hasn’t washed up since she came back, and if she catches a cold after being out in the rain, that would be unfortunate. Excuse us.” Without waiting for Charlie’s response, he took Sophia’s hand and left the meeting room. Sophia followed him back to their place, saying nothing the entire way.

But the more she remained silent, the more uncomfortable Ethan felt.

“Don’t you have anything you want to ask me?” he snapped, feeling a bit irritated.

Sophia was rummaging through her clothes for something to change into and looked at him in confusion. “Ask what?”

Of course, she could ask who hurt Charlie and… Ethan said in a low voice, “Ask me why I didn’t help Charlie.”

Sophia looked at him for a moment and said, “I never expected you to suddenly turn into a hero. Besides, when it comes to zombies, even though you’re an expert, it still seems very dangerous.” She carried her clothes into the bathroom. “If you don’t want to help, then don’t. It’s fine.”

Ethan watched her casually enter the bathroom, feeling increasingly unsettled compared to before.

The people you care about most are often the ones who poke at your sensitive spots. He had never thought of Sophia as someone who reasoned much, but now he was beginning to see it.

This situation was supposed to unfold as Charlie reaching out for help → Ethan offering assistance. However, Ethan had repeatedly found ways to refuse, leaving Charlie with no choice but to handle things according to emergency protocols while focusing on treating Emily’s injuries.

Emily and Nate had been lying in the hospital for four or five days without showing any signs of waking up, yet their physical conditions were entirely normal. Aside from being a bit weak, they had no other issues, which left the military doctor feeling quite helpless.

“Is there really nothing we can do?” Connor sat helplessly at the edge of the bed, looking at the military doctor. “What’s wrong with Emily? Why hasn’t she woken up? It’s already the fifth day!”

The military doctor appeared troubled. “Governor, I’m really sorry, but I’m at a loss. The young lady’s vital signs are all normal.”

“Normal? Normal! The fact that she hasn’t woken up is the biggest abnormality!” Connor suddenly stood up, his expression intense. “What about Nate? Has she woken up?”

The military doctor furrowed his brow slightly. “Her condition may be slightly better; she seems to show signs of waking up.”

Connor gritted his teeth in frustration. “So Nate wakes up, but Emily doesn’t?”

“There are signs of waking up, but she hasn’t fully awakened yet,” Charlie corrected quietly, having remained silent until now.

Connor shot him a cold glare filled with undisguised anger. Charlie knew he was being blamed for the situation, as if Emily wouldn’t have been injured if not for him. Thus, he kept quiet and silently bore his brother's resentment.

Just as Connor sighed and was about to say something, someone burst in to report that they had received a message from Governor Alex Carter of the Ion Base, who seemed to have heard about Emily's condition and appeared to have a solution to help her recover.

“What are you waiting for? Go and invite him over!” Connor hurriedly rushed out, but then turned back at the door. “No, you go instead. I’ll stay here with Emily. If she wakes up and doesn’t see me, she’ll be sad.” He returned to Emily’s side, looking down at her sleeping face with concern.

Charlie hesitated but didn’t protest, following the soldier who had delivered the message. He changed into a uniform, shaved his beard, and elegantly conducted a video conversation with Alex Carter, agreeing on a meeting time.

This unexpected development brought Charlie a slight sense of relief. After all, the top priority for the base right now was Emily’s recovery. If she could regain her health, then no matter how difficult the zombie issue became, it wouldn’t be as exhausting as it was now. After all, even if the base had to be sacrificed, they could still rebuild elsewhere, but losing his sister was a different matter entirely.

Charlie tried to think positively, but it seemed like fate was determined to put him through trials, throwing one problem after another his way.

The biggest of these problems was Alex Carter.

When Alex arrived at the base, things took a bizarre turn upon meeting Ethan and Sophia.

Alex was a young man of similar height to Ethan, and the two shared a strikingly similar aura, yet Alex was terribly thin, almost as if his chest was pressed against his back. His pale complexion and bloodless lips made him appear fragile; a slight breeze could induce a cough from him.

…Could someone like this really heal Emily? In the original story, Alex was merely a name mentioned in passing, and he made his only appearance at the end when he transferred the management of the base to Nate before disappearing with a girl.

That girl was now standing beside him—a girl roughly the same age as Nate. Although her looks didn’t rival Nate’s stunning beauty, she had a serene presence, dressed in a brown dress, exuding a calmness akin to the gentle rain of May.

“Hello, Governor Carter.” Charlie greeted Alex warmly, shaking his hand. Alex withdrew the hands he had kept behind him and shook Charlie’s hand, separated only by a thin layer of white gloves.

“I’m not in great health; please excuse me,” Alex explained softly, his delicate features and fair skin making him look as if he had stepped out of a painting. “This is my younger sister, Lily Carter.” He gently introduced the girl beside him, “Lily, say hello to Deputy Governor Charlie.”

Lily politely bowed to Charlie. “Hello, Deputy Governor Charlie.”

Charlie smiled warmly. “No need for such formalities, Miss Lily. I had no idea Governor Carter had a younger sister.”

Alex’s lips formed a slight, awkward smile. “No, Lily isn’t my biological sister. She’s one of the children I adopted when I was young. They are not much younger than me, so they all call me ‘big brother.’”

“Big brother?” A cold voice suddenly interjected, emphasizing the words heavily.

Alex’s attention was momentarily diverted to the person he had been trying to ignore. His eyes flickered, and he briefly closed his eyes, his body swaying slightly. Lily instinctively supported him.

“I’m fine,” Alex reassured her, patting her hand gently. He nodded at Ethan, the one who had interrupted him.

Ethan stood straight a short distance away, and any casual glance from him seemed to make Alex flinch, as if Ethan were an intimidating presence capable of taking his life at any moment.

Sophia observed this entire interaction silently, feeling a mix of confusion but choosing to hide it, standing discreetly beside Ethan.

“Not good!” A soldier from the base suddenly burst into the tense atmosphere of the reception room, breathless as he reported, “It’s bad! Deputy Governor! The zombies in the reconnaissance area have mutated again, and their numbers are increasing rapidly! The soldiers on guard are about to reach their limit!”
