Ivy paused, stunned by what she had just heard, and then looked up in surprise, her eyes searching Ethan’s for answers. "Really? You’re not just making this up to get rid of me, are you?"

Ethan didn’t respond right away. Instead, he gently lifted her and placed her on the edge of the bed, sitting down beside her. He gazed off into the distance, lost in thought. "Don't use your cleverness against me. I kind of miss when you didn’t know everything. How did you suddenly get so smart?" His voice was calm, but there was an undertone suggesting he wanted to change the subject.

"I’ve told you a million times, it’s not about intelligence; I just didn’t feel like putting in the effort," Ivy replied, raising an eyebrow with a playful retort.

Ethan smirked slightly, his tone casual. "I’ve never misjudged anyone. This is definitely about intelligence."

She was momentarily speechless, choosing instead to lean closer to him and softly ask, "You said you're dying. Is that true?"

Ethan frowned slightly, avoiding her gaze, his tone becoming a bit colder. "I’ve mentioned before, you still need to recover. Don’t overexert yourself."

Ivy stayed put, gently resting her head on his shoulder, her voice hoarse but stubborn. "Is it really that serious?"

Ethan glanced at her, a faint smile on his lips. "You don’t believe me? Everyone dies eventually, and I’m no exception."

"But you’re not just anyone," she argued passionately, her eyes filled with conflict and complexity. "If you're really in trouble, it must be because of me, right?"

Ethan didn’t answer. Instead, he looked at the scar on his wrist, speaking softly. "No matter the outcome, why keep asking?"

He stood up, seemingly ready to leave, but Ivy suddenly wrapped her arms around his waist, her voice trembling slightly. "You don’t have to do this for me. I’m not worth it. Why put yourself through this? If anyone should pay the price, it should be me!"

"Enough," Ethan interrupted softly, turning around to kneel down and gently wipe away her tears. He didn’t meet her eyes, speaking quietly, "What do you want me to do? Give me a choice, just one, okay?"

Ivy was taken aback, seeing a side of Ethan she never expected—the calm and enigmatic man now seemed vulnerable. A wave of emotion surged through her, and she reached out to help him up. "What are you doing? Get up!"

Ethan gently pushed her hand away, his voice low. "Nothing. I heard men propose to women like this too, so just think of it as me proposing to you."

Ivy was momentarily stunned, then burst into laughter. "Proposing? So when you told me to leave before, was it to get rid of me, your loyal partner?"

Ethan looked up, his gaze complex, lips moving as if to speak, but he remained silent. He lowered his head, resting it against her shoulder. Ivy hesitated for a moment, then looked down at his soft, dark hair and gently patted his back.

"If it were me, I’d also choose to leave someone I cared about, not wanting them to see me at my worst," she said softly, her tone calm yet resolute. "But Ethan, this time I’m the main character, and I’m not letting go."

She lifted his head, lightly touching his cheek, suddenly feeling a dampness there. She froze, shocked by the realization—was Ethan crying?

This understanding was almost beyond belief. She stood there, too afraid to confirm, too afraid to continue. Ethan, however, let out a soft chuckle, as if trying to mask his emotions, his expression regaining some of its usual ease.

"Don’t overthink it," Ethan said huskily, his voice tinged with a trace of helplessness. "There’s no problem that can’t be solved."

Ivy lowered her head, looking at him earnestly, her voice as soft as a breeze. "But what if it really can’t be solved?"

Ethan met her gaze, his eyes filled with complex emotions. He seemed about to say something but ultimately said nothing, pulling her into a tight embrace instead.
