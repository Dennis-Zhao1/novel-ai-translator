Z seemed to ignore her words entirely as he opened the door and looked out at the sky, casually remarking, "It's a cloudy day."

Sophie Smith jumped up from the couch and joined him, her eyes scanning the overcast sky. "Looks like we're in for some rain," she said just as fat drops began to fall. Z shot her a sidelong glance, a "you've got to be kidding me" expression on his face, making her feel sheepish. She rubbed her face and tried to change the subject with a grin. "Speaking of surprises, we've known each other for so long, and I still don't know what you really like. Don’t tell me it’s just your research."

Her curiosity sparked a warm feeling in Z. He replied smoothly, "I like cloudy days." He turned his gaze back to the sky. "The first time I met you, it was cloudy. I love the sound of raindrops hitting the leaves and the sensation of rain on my skin. I also enjoy the smell of freshly bound books and the rhythm of my fingers tapping on keyboards." He glanced down at Sophie, who was gazing up at him with an intent expression. Her eyes sparkled like a lake scattered with stars, and he thought to himself, *and I like you too.*

Sophie committed every word to memory, thinking it might be useful someday. Just then, Z unexpectedly asked, "Why don’t you let your dad come pick you up? Without the resources you had at Ouyang and Yining, this should be the best place for you right now."

Sophie hesitated, opening her mouth before finally replying, "It's fine. I’ll go back sooner or later anyway."

"You could go back right now. You know that even if you leave, I wouldn't really retaliate against you." Z's gaze drifted into the curtain of rain, spotting Charlie and Emma approaching under umbrellas, a frown creasing his forehead.

Sophie didn't notice the scene unfolding; she was deep in thought. All that came to her mind in response was a simple phrase: "It’s okay. You’re more important right now."

Z looked at her in surprise, his eyes revealing a complex emotion he rarely showed. Deep down, he felt a sense of validation for all the foolish things he had done for her in the past.

Sophie's heart raced, her feelings tumultuous as she silently prayed for forgiveness for indulging in her reckless feelings and for choosing familial bonds over reason...

When Charlie and Emma arrived, they caught sight of Z and Sophie gazing into each other’s eyes with deep affection.

Charlie, well aware that Z and Sophie were a couple—having arranged their rooms—watched them with curiosity. What exactly did this girl possess that made a man who seemed to dislike everything so fond of her?

"Hey, Miss Smith, Professor Z, how's it going?" Charlie greeted, holding the black umbrella over Emma, while his own shoulder got drenched. His uniform was soaked.

Sophie nodded at him, while Z ignored him completely. Charlie didn’t mind and continued, "So, this afternoon we need to conduct an investigation on the outskirts. I hope Professor Z..."

"Call me Doctor," Z interjected abruptly.

Though puzzled by the sudden demand, Charlie complied, "Alright, Doctor. But wouldn’t it be more polite to use your surname? Just my personal thought—please don’t take offense."

Charlie was subtly probing for information from Z, hoping to understand the almost mythical figure described by Gong Qiyu. He was cautious about getting too close, wanting to keep Z away from the secrets of atoms. He needed to conduct an investigation, and the time for that was fast approaching, but he had already failed in his attempts to uncover Z's past.

He found it strange yet reasonable that there was no information available about Z in this post-apocalyptic world.

"Me?" Charlie was caught off guard when Z saw through his intentions. Z replied warmly, "My surname is Johnson. Call me Doctor Johnson, Dr. Johnson."

Charlie raised an eyebrow and nodded, "Doctor Johnson."

Sophie's mind replayed Z's words over and over. She didn’t even think to argue with him, unsure of how far she could go for him—what her limits were.

"Doctor Johnson, can you join us?" Emma suddenly chimed in.

Z glanced at her but said nothing. Emma felt awkward, and Charlie quickly intervened, saying, "If Doctor Johnson joins us for the investigation, the team would be very grateful. Mr. Gong mentioned that Doctor Johnson has considerable experience dealing with zombies." He couldn't help but picture Z as the mastermind behind this apocalyptic world.

As he thought about it, Charlie stole a few more glances at Z, his feelings growing more complicated.

Z sensed the tension but hadn’t spoken yet when Sophie answered for him, "He’s not going." She stepped forward, "I will go."

Charlie was taken aback, staring at the slender girl with shoulder-length hair. She wasn’t short, but standing next to Z made her appear so. Her gaze was resolute and stubborn, as if she wouldn't accept anyone's refusal.

Z swiftly pulled Sophie back. “You need to rest right now.” He spoke in a low voice, just for her ears, and she understood he was referring to her powers needing to be stabilized.

Sophie felt reluctant, her frustration evident, causing both Emma and Charlie to feel a twinge of envy.

In this post-apocalyptic world, love was precious, especially genuine love.

"You know I won't do anything dangerous, right? I won’t go where it’s risky. Don’t worry," Z said, turning to Charlie. "Let’s go." With that, he stepped into the rain, seemingly unfazed by it.

Charlie hurriedly offered him the umbrella, but Z waved it away, not looking at him. "Hold it over your sister. If you take her, it means the place is safe."

Charlie was surprised by Z's perceptiveness and quickly moved the umbrella back over Emma’s head, brushing the rain off her hair as they made their way to the investigation site.

Sophie watched Z and the siblings walk away, her heart torn. She wanted to go with him but knew that insisting would only complicate things. While there might not be much danger, she preferred to heed his advice.

Deep down, she longed to be independent, to stand strong in this apocalyptic world without relying on anyone else.

Z gave her that possibility, and she didn’t want to miss it. She was eager to listen to him; it would prevent her from becoming a burden in the future. And if they ever parted ways, she wanted to be capable enough not to feel helpless.

Though sometimes she was a bit dense, she wasn't foolish. Pigs don’t think; they just eat and sleep, carefree, but they are ultimately destined for slaughter.

Sophie never aspired to become a queen overnight, but she certainly didn’t want to end up like a pig.

If Z knew of her noble aspirations at that moment, he would undoubtedly feel proud.

He might even consider sticking a note on her forehead that read, *This woman has aspirations! Anyone who tries to undermine her will face my wrath!*

As Charlie and Z continued on, they veered past the residential area and switched to a vehicle, which afforded them more time to talk.

Charlie decided to break the ice with simple, friendly topics. "Doctor Johnson and Miss Smith, you both look quite young and accomplished."

Z ignored him, as if he hadn’t heard.

Charlie didn’t feel awkward; he pressed on, undeterred by Emma’s disapproving glances. "It’s coming down pretty hard. I wonder if it will affect today’s investigation."

Still no response.

"I wonder if Doctor Johnson likes animals? I have a little dog who survived that nightmare. If you like pets, you should come over sometime."

Ignored again.

"Doctor Johnson, have you ever had a pet?" Charlie continued, his expression warm and friendly, unaffected by Z's silence.

Z, slightly interested in the topic, finally answered, though still not looking at him. "I’ve had one."

"Oh?" Both Charlie and Emma were surprised. He glanced at the driver and asked softly, "What kind of pet did you have?"

Z’s eyes curved slightly as his bangs obscured his gaze. Only he knew: "I had a little cat. She was quite the flirt; even when I held her close, she would often entice other cats. She was very small and easily bullied by the other neighborhood animals. I was terrified she would die, so I followed her around every day, always sensing that I had to be ready to collect her remains."

"But..." Z's tone shifted, "Some things you might find hard to accept at first, but once you get used to them, you find it impossible to live without that feeling." Like a certain someone.

Charlie chuckled, his eyes narrowing with a smile as he looked at Z, feeling a surge of affection for him.

A man who genuinely loves a girl can’t be all bad; deep down, he believes in love and possesses that quality.

Charlie said kindly, "Doctor Johnson, while this might be a bit forward, it’s best to compliment a girl in person. Otherwise, no one will pass the message along for you."
