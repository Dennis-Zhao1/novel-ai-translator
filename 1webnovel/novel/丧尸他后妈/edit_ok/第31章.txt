Ethan Miller stood with a furrowed brow, anxiously watching the two men who seemed on the verge of a fight. He couldn't help but think that if it came to blows, he would be in a difficult position. His father had sent him to protect Lily, who was aligned with Owen, yet Professor Z was a significant benefactor to him. What a dilemma! "So please, no fighting," he thought. "It might feel satisfying for a moment, but it leads to disaster... No, violence is fleeting, but kindness is lasting! This world should be about kindness, not conflict!"

“Hey, maybe we should just move on!” Ethan boldly tried to change the subject.

Suddenly, both Z and Owen turned their attention to him. Owen, clearly eager to seize the distraction, maintained his arrogant demeanor but was willing to cooperate, while Z’s gaze shifted, revealing a deadly intensity that made Ethan's heart race.

Feeling a bit lost, Ethan instinctively took a step back, forcing a chuckle, “I mean, no need to mind me, you can carry on…”

“That’s right,” Z replied with a look that suggested he was impressed, “not interfering is the fundamental principle of how people should interact.” With that, he immediately turned back to Owen, “Remember, this is the last time. If we have any more unpleasantness, I’ll make sure to end you.” He showed no fear of anyone questioning his identity as he emphasized, “This is not a threat.” Then he turned and got into the car.

Sophia Smith glanced at the dumbfounded Owen and, with an indifferent expression, helped Mia into the backseat before sitting down herself.

She closed the door and looked up to find Z, one hand on the steering wheel, turning to face her.

“What’s wrong?” she asked, puzzled.

Z was momentarily caught off guard; expressing gratitude felt almost as daunting as confessing love. He wanted to calmly tell her how much he appreciated her support, knowing she would be pleased to hear it, but no matter how much he tried to muster the words, he just couldn't. It wasn't about pride or anything like that; it was simply because he had always faced everything alone—no parents, no friends. He had never experienced this type of interaction, and it left him feeling confused.

All of his words ultimately got swallowed back, as if saying them would bring tears to his eyes. The feelings echoed in his heart, playing on repeat, yet they remained unvoiced.

“Nothing,” Z finally said, turning back to drive with a blank expression.

Sophia studied him thoughtfully, while Mia, sitting beside her, observed their interaction with wide, curious eyes, clearly intrigued by the tension.

After a moment, as they continued down the road, Z suddenly turned to Sophia and quickly said, “Thank you for defending me,” before turning back to focus on the road. The whole exchange lasted less than three seconds, and by the time Sophia processed what he had said, he had returned to his usual demeanor.

Mia, ever the gossip, stared at Sophia with an unabashed expression despite the tape covering her mouth. Z noticed this through the rearview mirror and narrowed his eyes, pressing a button that caused a metal cage to rise around Mia's seat.

Mia looked shocked as the cage enclosed her, her eyes welling with tears, as if she might cry. Z showed no mercy; after raising the cage, he stopped the car and turned to Sophia, saying, “Come sit next to me.”

Still lost in thought about Z’s sudden gratitude, Sophia obediently got out and moved to the passenger seat. Once she settled in, she gradually regained her composure and cast a more scrutinizing glance at Z.

Z deliberately ignored her probing gaze as he drove into a perilous area. “We’ve entered the atomic base’s territory. It’s very dangerous here—stay alert,” he said, using this as a way to divert her attention away from him.

As soon as Sophia heard this, she became serious, nodding earnestly. She checked the gun tucked in her holster and fastened all the buttons on her protective shirt, her nerves heightened as she scanned the surroundings outside the vehicle.

Z was telling the truth; they were definitely in a dangerous area. However, as long as they remained in the car, the chances of something going wrong were low. He had confidence in his abilities.

“Miss Mia,” Z said casually while driving, “please guide me.”

Mia stared at Z’s calm reflection in the rearview mirror, seemingly debating whether to tell the truth.

Z continued unhurriedly, “You can give me incorrect directions if you want; after all, if something happens to us, you won’t be safe either.”

Mia frowned, as if suddenly realizing something, and quickly pointed to the tape on her mouth.

Z rejected her idea. “Your voice is too loud. Just point.”

“…” A small frown appeared on Mia's forehead, and she awkwardly pointed left.

Z followed her direction, but since she had been out of the atomic base for a while, her understanding of the area was limited. When she made her escape, the base was busy changing the main gate, and she only remembered a general direction, unsure if it was truly safe or if any construction had even been completed.

As Z drove, leading the green pickup truck carrying Lily and others, the surroundings became increasingly sparse, trees thinning out. As darkness fell, they entered a vast open area that looked like an airfield, with two old planes parked not far away.

Upon seeing the planes, Mia suddenly erupted into noise, which irritated Z to no end, prompting him to ask Sophia to remove the tape from her mouth.

As soon as the tape was ripped off, Mia shouted, “Stop the car!”

“What’s wrong?” Sophia asked.

Breathlessly, Mia replied, “My second brother is here!”

“Second brother?” The leader of the atomic base was Charlie, who had two sisters and a brother. Aside from Mia, the others were half-siblings. His father had died from the H+ virus, and none of his mothers had survived either. The second brother, therefore, was Chase.

“Yeah!” Mia said rapidly, “You’ve brought me back; my brother will definitely thank you guys. Don’t be scared—just go down and find him! He’s right in that plane over there.” She pointed to a relatively newer white aircraft not far away.

Z tapped his fingers on the steering wheel, contemplating whether to believe her. Fearing he wouldn’t, Mia added, “Really, if you don’t trust me, just go check it out! You can keep me locked up here!”

Z scoffed, “Now that sounds ideal. You can stay safe here while we face disaster.”

“…” Mia fell silent, her face flushing as she turned away in embarrassment.

Z frowned slightly, realizing that she might have been telling the truth. Was he really being outsmarted here? He was torn between being annoyed and relieved.

While Z and Sophia remained cautious about Mia’s potential trick, those following behind had gotten out of their vehicle due to the stop, leisurely walking over to the luxury car and tapping on the window.

“Open the door! Why are we stopping? Are we there?” Owen knocked on Sophia's side of the window, while Lily stood by Z's side, with Ethan instinctively following her.

Sophia coldly regarded Owen’s unpleasant face outside the window, ignoring him completely, sitting rigidly in the passenger seat as if she hadn’t heard anything.

Z rolled down the window, addressing Ethan, “Get back in the car and keep driving. We’re not there yet.”

Lily, feeling a bit embarrassed by his cold dismissal, volunteered, “I can sit in the back and keep an eye on her.” She gestured toward Mia.

Mia, puzzled, exclaimed, “Who asked you to watch me? Hey, Mr. Miller, I’m not lying anymore! I’ll be good, okay? Just keep her away from me!”

“…” Mr. Miller? Sophia was taken aback by Mia's nickname for Z, fighting back a laugh as she glanced at him. Z’s face hardened, and he closed the window, gritting his teeth, “Please call me Professor.”

“Mr. Miller sounds more friendly. My brother said it’s definitely appropriate to call a man like that,” Mia remained undeterred.

Z pointed a gun at her head, his handsome face darkening, “Say that again.”

“I’m sorry…” Mia squeaked, stepping back in terror, “I-I won't do it again! I swear!”

Z expressionlessly retracted the gun, casting an awkward glance at Sophia, who was trying to suppress a smile. Her beautiful eyes sparkled, and he felt torn between embarrassment and joy.

He sighed and restarted the car, but suddenly, the previously still plane began to shake violently before tipping forward completely.
