This was a pleasant and peaceful time for Ivy and Ethan, as they silently avoided discussing the troubles that would eventually need resolution. From the start, the day felt a bit unusual.

Ivy Smith found herself in a bit of a predicament as she stood outside Ethan's room, waiting for him to finish changing. After nearly half an hour, she decided to enter. Although they were practically inseparable by now, she believed that respecting personal space was a basic courtesy.

"Ethan, I think we need to talk!" Ivy declared, waving a pregnancy test in front of him, her voice firm. "Something's definitely off!"

Ethan raised an eyebrow, brushing the test aside with a casual wave of his hand, his expression remaining calm. "You're probably just overthinking things. It could be stress or something else entirely."

"Are you suggesting it's something like menopause?" Ivy asked, a hint of disbelief in her voice. Then she dropped a bombshell, "Do you think I might be pregnant?"

"…"

Twenty minutes later, they sat across from each other at the kitchen table, their expressions serious and the atmosphere thick with tension. But as Ivy spoke, the heavy silence shattered.

"I thought your 'equipment' needed fixing, but it turns out I'm really pregnant!" she exclaimed joyfully. "Are you sure you didn't mess up? You really did it?"

Ethan, feeling a bit affronted, replied dryly, "I'd rather you doubt my test results than my skills."

Ivy, in a teasing manner, draped an arm around his shoulders and said, "Well, if anything happens to you, at least I'll have a little one to keep me company! Haha."

There was a playful glint in her eyes that made Ethan's lips twitch. "Unfortunately, I'm not planning on going anywhere."

Ivy wasn't surprised. "I never doubted you for a second."

"Should I thank you for having faith in me?"

"No need. We're too familiar with each other for that," Ivy said, springing up in delight and spinning around the room. "This is amazing! By the way, we should head back to the lab soon. Didn't you say the new project is ready? You haven't forgotten your promise, have you?"

Ethan leaned back, crossing his arms with a slight smirk as he watched her. "Alright."

He had been unusually agreeable lately, rarely opposing her ideas, which left Ivy feeling both flattered and a bit surreal. Who would have thought the man who seemed so determined before would become so accommodating? Feeling content, she returned to his side, resting her head on his shoulder.

Ethan tilted his head slightly, looking at her hand resting against him, the veins visible beneath her skin. He lowered his head and kissed her hand gently.

"In light of this," Ethan said, his tone casual, "I have a question for you."

"What is it?" she asked softly.

"Is Jason gone for good?"

"…" Ivy paused before answering. "I honestly don't know."

Ethan met her eyes, evaluating her response as she continued, "I haven't sensed his presence at all. Even after checking everything, I haven't seen him. The only ones left are the harmless folks waiting for us to help them out."

"I see," Ethan nodded thoughtfully. "I might have an idea where they went."

"You do? Then let's get on it! I want to enjoy our backyard without worrying about anything."

Ethan chuckled. "I could make it so they'd bow to you if they saw you."

"… For some reason, I just imagined them dressed as maids, tidying up the house."

"Not a bad idea," Ethan replied with a wink.

Ivy shrugged. "Still, I prefer more human aesthetics."

"In that case," Ethan said with a conspiratorial grin, "let's take care of those loose ends."

"Huh?" Ivy raised an eyebrow in confusion.

Ethan gestured behind her. She turned to see a large screen displaying a scene below. Charlie and Grace were there, seemingly trying to find a way down, with Charlie looking particularly troubled.

"What do they want?" Ivy asked, suddenly alert.

Ethan reassured her with a calm demeanor, "It's alright. I asked them to come."

"You?" She looked at him, surprised.

Ethan’s expression was enigmatic. "Some things are better resolved by others."

"What could you possibly need them for?" Ivy asked, curious.

"Taking care of Jason," he replied, opening the door as Charlie and Grace entered the elevator. "If you did it, you'd feel guilty. If I did it, you might have doubts. Better someone else handle it."

… So he had already coordinated with Charlie. Charlie had finally found his long-lost sister, even if she wasn't the same as before…

"Then why bring them here now?" Ivy asked.

Ethan leaned against the table, arms crossed. "To end it all."

… Should she thank him? Or compliment him?

Maybe it was better not to, considering he was the father of her child, and being a dad meant taking responsibility.

Ivy eagerly watched as Ethan resolved everything. Charlie and Grace left quickly after receiving a small vial and a box of medication from Ethan, leaving Ivy puzzled about what just happened.

"What's got you so deep in thought?" Ethan asked, approaching her without her noticing, exhaling softly. "Now we can go anywhere you want. Where to?"

"What just happened? Why is it over?" Ivy countered with a question instead of answering.

Ethan found her confusion amusing and laughed softly. "Did you think it was complicated? The ones left know better than to mess with us."

"What did you give them?" she asked again.

Ethan pondered before replying, "One is what you expect, and the other… maybe a little self-care kit."

Ivy's lips quirked with mixed emotions. "You mean you gave them the cure?"

Ethan didn't answer; he simply started tidying up. "We're leaving here for a while. Make sure you take everything you need."

Ivy leaned closer, pressing for more. "Is it true? Come on, tell me!"

Ignoring her questions, Ethan handed her a schedule. "You've got things to follow through before the baby comes." He placed the paper in her hand, her expression turning sour upon seeing it.

"Studying is one thing, but why piano lessons? I play the violin!" Ivy protested, pointing at the paper. "And why do I have to watch you for eight hours a day? What's that about?"

Ethan looked at her with a teasing smile. "Of course you have to watch me. Otherwise, what if the baby looks like you? That would be a disaster."

"…" Ivy suppressed her annoyance, eyes flashing with playful fire. "I'm really curious about what I am to you. Could you please have Dr. Brown explain how you see me?"

Ethan grinned, unable to hold back a laugh, and responded simply, "Mine."

"…"

"What are you standing there for? Let's go," Ethan called, picking up a small computer and tapping away.

All of Ivy's irritation dissipated instantly. It was already impressive he had come this far. What more could she ask for? It seemed they were meant to be together, as neither of them had anyone else to rely on…

As Ethan and Ivy left, they were greeted by the long-lost Optimus, who seemed to keep a safe distance from Ivy. At first, she didn't notice, but eventually, she had to ask.

"Why does it always avoid me?" Ivy asked Ethan, who was engrossed in a book on "Fruit Tree Cultivation Techniques." Ethan looked up, his eyes narrowing slightly behind his glasses as he replied in a very restrained tone, "I think I've mentioned more than once not to disturb me while I'm studying."

Ivy covered her mouth to stifle a laugh. "Oops, sorry, I forgot~"

"… So?"

"So? So hurry up and answer my question!" she said, as if it were obvious.

Ethan glanced at her slightly protruding belly and, taking a deep breath, said, "Maybe its database has some bad memories of you from before."

"… Haha." Ivy chuckled awkwardly. "Is that so? Can I erase those memories? Wouldn't that make the world a little better?"

Ethan looked up at the sun. Under the bright blue sky, the small garden was filled with blooming sunflowers. It was already the season of warmth and blossoming. Time flew by so quickly; they had known each other for so long and were about to have a healthy baby.

"The world has always been beautiful," Ethan said casually.

"Huh?"

"You can operate it however you like. No need to ask me." Ethan returned to his book, as if he hadn't just said something astonishing.

Ivy slowly smiled, getting up from the recliner, putting on her shoes, and approaching Optimus, who seemed lost in thought. As she passed Ethan, she quickly whispered, "Thank you."

Thank you? For him?

Ethan didn't look up, but the corners of his mouth lifted slightly. That word perhaps should have been one he said to her. After all, how could a test subject with an incomplete childhood and skewed views of the world possibly know what reality was like? There’s a saying, "You become what you see." Having witnessed those equally damaged individuals, how could he be normal?

In short, he would do his best to compensate for what was missing. As for Ivy and their future child, he would provide them with a strong support system and a bright future. That was his only goal for the latter half of his life.

These thoughts were never something he spoke to her about. He didn't even need her to know. He would silently carry out his plans, treating love the same way.

It seemed he had never once taken the initiative to express feelings like "I love you," but that didn’t matter anymore. If the next moment were the end of the world, he might seriously tell her he loved her. However, given his nature, as long as there was tomorrow, he would never open his mouth to say such things, nor would he allow the end of the world to happen.

At the very least, even if he couldn’t stop the world from changing and ultimately collapsing, he could take her away from here.

Ethan watched Ivy from a distance. She stood in the sunlight, wearing a loose short skirt. Beside her was Optimus, who felt trapped and lost. The gentle breeze ruffled her hair, now grown to her waist, and Ethan thought he could hear a beautiful melody.

It seemed that many things were like this.

You first need to believe before you can possess. As for whether you needed it at that moment, you must set it aside. Because once you believe and possess, you will realize just how much you need her.

A stable relationship allows both parties to have their own little world, with no interference or dependency, no extravagant praise or lies, and no complaints or concealments about reality. Yet, despite everything, they just wanted to be together.

In all the past where things have changed, I love you the most.

==THE END==

69. Epilogue...
If a child could choose, then as the child of Ethan and Ivy, he would be very unwilling to come into this world.

He was acutely aware that he was born to suffer, to prove how brilliant and mighty his father was and how stunningly beautiful his mother was. He knew, he just knew, that he must have been born from a five-dollar top-up.

Have you ever seen a father who watches cartoons while making his son study? That was exactly his father.

His dad said he was making up for his lost childhood and that his name came from this.

Is that so? Ha, indeed, the name Tom is just so hard to accept.

However, at least when he was first born, he was a happy little prince. But as he grew up, his status in this family sank to that of a pet-level house elf.

To live or to perish, that was a question—a question of whether to silently endure his father's brutal torment or to ignore his mother's willful ignorance, yielding to his father's tyranny. Which was more noble?

The seven-year-old boy, unsure if he should be called Tom Smith or Tom Brown, stood in the garden at the door, helplessly gazing up at the moon. His vacant expression and despondent demeanor vividly conveyed his melancholy.

Suddenly, a voice shouted "Cut!" from nearby, and the boy's face instantly fell. He turned and walked away expressionlessly, fists clenched.

"Hey?" Ivy, having turned off the camera, looked puzzled at her son's retreating figure. "Tom, where are you going? It’s bedtime after filming!"

"I'm going to the lab." The boy said this without looking back as he dashed toward the underground lab. Ivy hurried after him, worried about his safety, murmuring, "Going down now is like committing suicide. I’m your mom, and I can’t protect you."

What was in the lab at this moment? Someone? Who was it?

The little boy skillfully punched in the password to enter the lab. After patting his chest in relief, he looked back, thankful his mom hadn’t caught up. But just as he relaxed, he turned around to meet his father's piercing gaze.

Ethan stood straight beside the experiment table, the light reflecting off his frame-less glasses. The boy couldn't see his father's eyes, but he could tell he was in for a bad time.

"Do you know what time it is?" Ethan asked, his thin lips moving without a hint of emotion.

The boy instinctively took a step back, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "… Sorry, Dad, I…"

"I don’t want to hear your excuses. I only care about the outcome." Ethan raised his wrist to check his watch. "It’s a quarter past twelve. What time did I specify for you to go to sleep on your schedule?"

"… Nine o'clock."

"And how late are you?"

"…"

"Answer me."

"…"

"What’s wrong?" Ethan’s mouth twisted into a menacing smile, the dim light around him casting shadows like the approach of death.

No matter how calm a seven-year-old could be, Ethan's intimidating demeanor made him burst into tears. Ivy, who had been watching from the doorway, could take it no longer, rushing in to scoop her son into her arms, comforting him, "Don’t cry, sweetheart, don’t be afraid."

The moment Ethan saw Ivy, his expression shifted to a bright, harmless smile. "Oh, why are both of you here? It’s time for bed."

Ivy felt speechless, letting out a sigh. "He is your biological son, right?"

"Of course," Ethan replied earnestly. "If he weren’t, I’d kill him first, then you, and finally myself."

"… Enough! Don't you think it’s too gruesome to say such things in front of the child?"

"He probably likes it," Ethan said casually.

Ivy, holding her child, helplessly turned to leave, but Ethan, seeing this, set down what he was doing and followed them upstairs. Just as Ivy planned to hold her child to sleep, Ethan mercilessly grabbed Tom by the collar and tossed him outside.

"Hey, what are you doing?"

"Children with this name should have a painful childhood so they don’t grow up twisted."

"… Seriously? Why does that remind me of Voldemort? = = So you named him like that!"

"What about it?"

Before Ivy could respond, Tom shouted angrily from outside, "Who do you think you are? How could someone so annoying exist?"

Without a second thought, Ethan opened the door and looked outside. Tom, frightened, darted behind the sofa, peeking out with only his eyes visible.

Ethan said flatly, "I thought I was your father."
