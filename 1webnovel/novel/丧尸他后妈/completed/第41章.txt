Sophia Wang hadn’t had the chance to take a shower yet; it seemed something serious had happened at the base. By the time Z finished tidying up and stepped out, Xiao Cha had already sent out an emergency summons, calling everyone to gather in the meeting room. With no choice, Sophia retracted her steps toward the bathroom, quickly washed her face, and wiped her hair before heading out the door.

Z glanced down at her, subtly shielding her from the wind with his body, and placed her slightly cold hands inside his clothing to warm them up with his body heat. When Sophia looked up at him, he firmly grasped her chin and turned her face back, leaving her momentarily stunned.

They hadn’t walked for long before they arrived at the meeting room of the base. The room wasn’t very crowded, mainly filled with a few key figures from the organization, including Yusuke Miyazaki and others. Xiao Ya Ya and Yi Ning were presumably too injured to attend, and oddly enough, there was no sign of Xiao Cong, the governor of the base, which seemed rather unprofessional given the apparent importance of the meeting.

“Hello, you two.” Xiao Cha greeted Z and Sophia with a rather neutral expression, his gaze towards Z complicated. He pressed his pale lips tightly together and sank heavily into a chair after exchanging pleasantries.

Xiao Cha was undoubtedly the one hosting this meeting. He leaned both hands on the table, staring down at its surface as he slowly began, “The reason I called everyone here is to address some urgent matters. Ya Ya and Miss Yi are currently recovering from their injuries, and with my elder brother looking after them, there’s no need for concern. They are both severely injured, but they’re out of immediate danger.” He suddenly turned to Z, “I hope Dr. Zhang will refrain from being so obstinate next time.”

Z showed no signs of backing down. In front of everyone, he directly retorted, “I do what I want. Why should you care?” His long, narrow eyes cast a disdainful glance at Xiao Cha, casually twirling a pen on the table, exuding a calm and indifferent aura.

Xiao Cha was momentarily taken aback, hesitating for a moment before responding softly, “I apologize; perhaps my wording was off, but this is, after all, a matter concerning the base. I hope Dr. Zhang can tone it down a little.”

Naturally, Z wasn’t going to tone it down. He wanted to say something, but Sophia suddenly grasped his hand, which had been spinning the pen with fervor. Z’s words caught in his throat, and he resigned himself to say instead, “Heh, it seems my only option now is to play the good guy.”

“Dr. Zhang still has a sense of reason,” Xiao Cha forced a smile, giving a slight nod to Sophia. “Thank you.”

Thank you? A sense of reason? Z thought to himself that someday he would have a proper talk with Xiao Cha about reasoning. The logic went something like this: 1. Screw you, 2. Damn you, 3. Wipe out your entire lineage… Z cast a mild glance at Xiao Cha and changed hands to continue playing with the pen, this time mimicking a shooting stance with it aimed at Xiao Cha.

Xiao Cha sensed Z’s palpable hostility but couldn’t confront him about it. He suspected Z might be the one who attacked him, but he couldn’t find any evidence. The military doctor had been unable to locate any bullets in Yi Ning and Xiao Ya Ya’s bodies. Although both had survived, it was evident that something inside them was changing and slipping out of their control.

Xiao Cha didn’t dare provoke Z; if he did, Z would undoubtedly confront him directly. Yet, if Z wasn’t the attacker, he not only would lose the chance to save Xiao Ya Ya but would also gain a formidable enemy. Moreover, the base still needed Z’s help.

After careful consideration, Xiao Cha put on a sincere smile and spoke in a smooth voice, “Dr. Zhang, the reason I brought you and Miss Wang here amidst your busy schedules is that we’ve encountered a mutation in the zombies at the reconnaissance area we visited earlier.”

Sophia looked at him, surprised. “Mutation?”

“Yes,” Xiao Cha said, his brow furrowing as he clenched his fist. “For some reason, all the zombies we shot in the head have revived, which has never happened before.”

Z listened calmly to Xiao Cha’s account, showing no outward signs of distress, but inside he was mentally berating Xiao Cha for being indecisive and lacking intelligence. Staying here to waste time was ridiculous, yet… he glanced at Sophia and felt a twinge of reluctance. He had already invested so much time in her, and it would be a loss not to make it worthwhile.

“What do you plan to do, Deputy Governor Xiao?” Yusuke Miyazaki asked anxiously, his concern seeming somewhat forced.

Xiao Cha sighed and subtly glanced at Z. “I haven’t thought of a good plan yet. Besides forcibly dispersing them again, I don’t know if such an event will happen again.”

Without any self-awareness, Miyazaki turned to Z with an expectant look. “Professor, you must have a solution!”

Z paused his pen spinning, looking at him, and spoke slowly, “Call me Doctor.”

“…” Miyazaki looked bewildered for a moment before replying, “Oh, Doctor…”

“Very well.” Z stood up and addressed Xiao Cha, “Once you’re done here, I’ll be leaving. She hasn’t washed up since she came back, and if she catches a cold after being out in the rain, that would be unfortunate. Excuse us.” Without waiting for Xiao Cha’s response, he took Sophia’s hand and left the meeting room. Sophia followed him back to their place, saying nothing the entire way.

But the more she remained silent, the more uncomfortable Z felt.

“Don’t you have anything you want to ask me?” he snapped, feeling a bit irritated.

Sophia was rummaging through her clothes for something to change into and looked at him in confusion. “Ask what?”

Of course, she could ask who hurt Xiao Cha and… Z said in a low voice, “Ask me why I didn’t help Xiao Cha.”

Sophia looked at him for a moment and said, “I never expected you to suddenly turn into a hero. Besides, when it comes to zombies, even though you’re an expert, it still seems very dangerous.” She carried her clothes into the bathroom. “If you don’t want to help, then don’t. It’s fine.”

Z watched her casually enter the bathroom, feeling increasingly unsettled compared to before.

The people you care about most are often the ones who poke at your sensitive spots. He had never thought of Sophia as someone who reasoned much, but now he was beginning to see it.

This situation was supposed to unfold as Xiao Cha reaching out for help → Z offering assistance. However, Z had repeatedly found ways to refuse, leaving Xiao Cha with no choice but to handle things according to emergency protocols while focusing on treating Xiao Ya Ya’s injuries.

Xiao Ya Ya and Yi Ning had been lying in the hospital for four or five days without showing any signs of waking up, yet their physical conditions were entirely normal. Aside from being a bit weak, they had no other issues, which left the military doctor feeling quite helpless.

“Is there really nothing we can do?” Xiao Cong sat helplessly at the edge of the bed, looking at the military doctor. “What’s wrong with Ya Ya? Why hasn’t she woken up? It’s already the fifth day!”

The military doctor appeared troubled. “Governor, I’m really sorry, but I’m at a loss. The young lady’s vital signs are all normal.”

“Normal? Normal! The fact that she hasn’t woken up is the biggest abnormality!” Xiao Cong suddenly stood up, his expression intense. “What about Yi Ning? Has she woken up?”

The military doctor furrowed his brow slightly. “Her condition may be slightly better; she seems to show signs of waking up.”

Xiao Cong gritted his teeth in frustration. “So Yi Ning wakes up, but Ya Ya doesn’t?”

“There are signs of waking up, but she hasn’t fully awakened yet,” Xiao Cha corrected quietly, having remained silent until now.

Xiao Cong shot him a cold glare filled with undisguised anger. Xiao Cha knew he was being blamed for the situation, as if Xiao Ya Ya wouldn’t have been injured if not for him. Thus, he kept quiet and silently bore his brother's resentment.

Just as Xiao Cong sighed and was about to say something, someone burst in to report that they had received a message from Governor Jie Anjun of the Ion Base, who seemed to have heard about Xiao Ya Ya's condition and appeared to have a solution to help her recover.

“What are you waiting for? Go and invite him over!” Xiao Cong hurriedly rushed out, but then turned back at the door. “No, you go instead. I’ll stay here with Ya Ya. If she wakes up and doesn’t see me, she’ll be sad.” He returned to Xiao Ya Ya’s side, looking down at her sleeping face with concern.

Xiao Cha hesitated but didn’t protest, following the soldier who had delivered the message. He changed into a uniform, shaved his beard, and elegantly conducted a video conversation with Jie Anjun, agreeing on a meeting time.

This unexpected development brought Xiao Cha a slight sense of relief. After all, the top priority for the base right now was Xiao Ya Ya’s recovery. If she could regain her health, then no matter how difficult the zombie issue became, it wouldn’t be as exhausting as it was now. After all, even if the base had to be sacrificed, they could still rebuild elsewhere, but losing his sister was a different matter entirely.

Xiao Cha tried to think positively, but it seemed like fate was determined to put him through trials, throwing one problem after another his way.

The biggest of these problems was Jie Anjun.

When Jie Anjun arrived at the base, things took a bizarre turn upon meeting Z and Sophia.

Jie Anjun was a young man of similar height to Z, and the two shared a strikingly similar aura, yet Jie Anjun was terribly thin, almost as if his chest was pressed against his back. His pale complexion and bloodless lips made him appear fragile; a slight breeze could induce a cough from him.

…Could someone like this really heal Xiao Ya Ya? In the original story, Jie Anjun was merely a name mentioned in passing, and he made his only appearance at the end when he transferred the management of the base to Yi Ning before disappearing with a girl.

That girl was now standing beside him—a girl roughly the same age as Yi Ning. Although her looks didn’t rival Yi Ning’s stunning beauty, she had a serene presence, dressed in a brown dress, exuding a calmness akin to the gentle rain of Jiangnan in May.

“Hello, Governor Jie.” Xiao Cha greeted Jie Anjun warmly, shaking his hand. Jie Anjun withdrew the hands he had kept behind him and shook Xiao Cha’s hand, separated only by a thin layer of white gloves.

“I’m not in great health; please excuse me,” Jie Anjun explained softly, his delicate features and fair skin making him look as if he had stepped out of a painting. “This is my younger sister, Yue Taoliang.” He gently introduced the girl beside him, “Little Yue, say hello to Deputy Governor Xiao.”

Yue Taoliang politely bowed to Xiao Cha. “Hello, Deputy Governor Xiao.”

Xiao Cha smiled warmly. “No need for such formalities, Miss Yue. I had no idea Governor Jie had a younger sister.”

Jie Anjun’s lips formed a slight, awkward smile. “No, Little Yue isn’t my biological sister. She’s one of the children I adopted when I was young. They are not much younger than me, so they all call me ‘big brother.’”

“Big brother?” A cold voice suddenly interjected, emphasizing the words heavily.

Jie Anjun’s attention was momentarily diverted to the person he had been trying to ignore. His eyes flickered, and he briefly closed his eyes, his body swaying slightly. Yue Taoliang instinctively supported him.

“I’m fine,” Jie Anjun reassured her, patting her hand gently. He nodded at Z, the one who had interrupted him.

Z stood straight a short distance away, and any casual glance from him seemed to make Jie Anjun flinch, as if Z were an intimidating assassin capable of taking his life at any moment.

Sophia observed this entire interaction silently, feeling a mix of confusion but choosing to hide it, standing discreetly beside Z.

“Not good!” A soldier from the base suddenly burst into the tense atmosphere of the reception room, breathless as he reported, “It’s bad! Deputy Governor! The zombies in the reconnaissance area have mutated again, and their numbers are increasing rapidly! The soldiers on guard are about to reach their limit!”
