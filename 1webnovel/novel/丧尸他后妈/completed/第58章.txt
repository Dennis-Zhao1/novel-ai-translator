After a long night of exhausting activity, Sophia Wang woke up to find it was already the next evening. 

As she slowly sat up, she realized she was lying in the large bed of the cockpit. The cabin was dim, with no lights on, and the weather outside seemed to be gloomy. The large front window allowed her to see nothing but the dark, starless sky and thick clouds. A wave of unease washed over her, and as she tried to get out of bed, her vision suddenly blurred, and she nearly fell.

What’s happening?

Frowning in confusion, she waved her hand in front of her eyes, but all she could distinguish was a faint shadow of flesh-toned color; everything else was a blur. 

What… what is going on?

Feeling lost, Sophia tentatively reached out in front of her, moving cautiously forward. Inevitably, she bumped into something, and a loud crash echoed as it hit the ground. Her eyes stung, and she felt a strong urge to cry.

“Z!!” she called out loudly, and just as she finished, the lights in front of her flickered on. She blinked at the sudden brightness, and as her vision cleared, she saw Z striding towards her in a crisp shirt and slacks. He took her hand, furrowing his brow as he looked at her, asking, “What’s wrong?”

Sophia blinked in surprise, her eyes widening as she realized she was truly seeing him. She glanced around the cockpit; a chair lay awkwardly on the floor nearby, the one she must have knocked over.

“I…,” she began, her gaze drifting to the bright lights. “I suddenly couldn’t see anything, but then you came and… now I can see…”

“Couldn’t see?” Z’s eyebrows raised, his expression darkening slightly. There was a hint of fatigue in his eyes as he thought for a moment. “I’ll bring the mech down now. Don’t panic. I need you to tell me everything that happened, exactly as it is.”

Sophia nodded vigorously and followed him back to the bedside in the cockpit. While he operated the control panel, the light made everything around them visible. However, in the initial lightless gloom, it had been difficult for her to see. She had always had good vision, so this situation left her feeling anxious. Once Z finished setting the course and returned to her side, she recounted the entire incident.

“That’s how it happened,” she said, rubbing her forehead. “Am I… sick?”

Z sighed in relief after she finished speaking, the tension in his face dissipating. With a light smirk, he said, “It looks like you have night blindness.” He tilted his chin slightly, crossing his legs. “As long as you stay close to me, I’ll fix it soon.”

“...Really?” Sophia wanted to say that even without his assurance, she would naturally stay by his side. However, she furrowed her brow in confusion. “But why would I have this condition?”

“Probably due to dietary reasons. It’s not a major issue,” Z replied, lightly tapping her forehead with two fingers. “You should rest. I’ll turn on a small light for you.”

Sophia nodded, and Z stood to switch on a small lamp on the bedside table, turning off the bright overhead lights, which made the space dim again. A wave of unease washed over her once more.

She wanted him to stay with her, but before she could voice that thought, he said, “I need to head to the control room to continue working on the antidote. Get some more sleep; I’ll call you when we land.”

Sophia swallowed her words, nodding obediently. 

Z left, and Sophia squinted at the dim light, lying back on the bed with her hands behind her head, but sleep eluded her. The gloomy weather outside mirrored her growing unease. After about half an hour, she could no longer lie still. Using the small lamp's light, she turned on the overhead lights and walked toward the control room.

Her footsteps were light as she was cautious not to disturb him, each step deliberate, including when she pushed the door open.

Z seemed completely absorbed in researching the antidote, not noticing her approach. He sat with his head resting on his hands, staring vacantly at the microscope… Wait, was he zoning out?

Sophia observed him closely; his eyes lacked focus, and he was genuinely lost in thought. How odd; this was a person who was usually so passionate about his research. Why was he daydreaming now?

Quietly, she tiptoed closer, peering over at the microscope, only to find it empty—no slides at all.

What’s going on? Why does everything feel strange after waking up?

“Z?” she called softly, but despite her best effort to keep her voice low, he jumped in surprise.

Z recoiled slightly, turning to glare at her with narrowed eyes. “Who let you in here?”

He rarely spoke to her in such a harsh tone; usually, his remarks were laced with sarcasm. This irritation was a first for her, leaving her momentarily stunned, unsure of how to respond.

After he spoke, Z rubbed his forehead vigorously, quickly regaining his composure. Covering his face with a hand and without his glasses, he lost some of his usual distance. “Sorry, I was lost in thought for a moment…”

“It’s okay,” Sophia interjected, “I should have greeted you before coming in.”

Z opened his mouth, seemingly wanting to explain, but just then, his AI assistant, Optimus, chimed in, “Sir, we have arrived at the destination. You may prepare for landing at any time.”

“Let’s land,” Z said tersely. He stood up, taking Sophia’s hand as they exited the control room, not bothering to explain what he had been thinking. He pulled her back to the cockpit, fastening her seatbelt in the pilot’s chair. “Stay still.”

Sophia sat quietly, her hands gripping the specialized seatbelt, which felt much more secure than those in a car. Clearly, Optimus's equipment was top-notch… But when had Z made it? Where had he gotten so many materials?

Sophia had countless questions, but she kept them to herself, just as Z seemed to harbor many thoughts without sharing them with her. They both silently agreed to bury their worries deep inside, unwilling to burden one another. Yet, they failed to see that many misunderstandings arise from a lack of communication.

Optimus landed on a familiar stretch of open ground, and when Sophia stepped out, she realized they were at the Atomic Base.

The most dangerous places often feel the safest. Leaving and returning to this place felt strange, but the ones who truly needed to be cautious were not Sophia and Z; it was the remaining survivors.

Following the quiet Z, Sophia noticed he didn’t direct Optimus to take them into the heart of the base. She was curious about his reasoning, but it soon became clear.

Neatly uniformed soldiers donned newly assigned uniforms with the letter Z emblazoned on their armbands, all former soldiers of the Atomic Base. They stood in two long lines to greet her and Z, led by a prominent figure from the past, an elite under Xiao Cha.

“Mr. Zhang, we’ve been waiting here since we received your signal,” he said, unfurling an umbrella. “Though it hasn’t started to rain, the weather is unfavorable, so we’ve prepared this for you. The vehicle is parked out front.”

Z coldly pushed aside the umbrella offered to him. “It’s just a short walk,” he said, brushing past him toward the military vehicle.

Sophia watched his back, slowly following him into the backseat of the military jeep. Once the door closed, she instinctively grasped his hand hanging by his side and whispered, “I don’t know if it’s just my imagination, but you seem a bit off? Honestly, before you, I never liked anyone, and I’m not sure how to navigate this relationship, but I know I want to spend my life with you. If there’s something bothering you that you can’t tell me, I hope I haven’t done anything to upset you without realizing it.”

Z instinctively denied it. “It’s not about you; it’s just…” He suddenly trailed off, hesitating for a long moment before not saying anything further. Instead, he added, “It’s just small stuff. You just take care of yourself. No one in this world has ever given me trouble, past or future.”

He smirked, his usual confidence flashing across his face, his gaze deep and charming. Sophia noticed it and felt a bit relieved.

Half-jokingly, she said, “I doubt I can take care of myself very well. When you get old, your body’s more prone to illness. Who knows, I might die one day—don’t be too sad then.” She patted his head, adopting a tone reminiscent of an elder.

The driver glanced at the rearview mirror, his face incredulous. It seemed unbelievable that the Z he remembered, who was as fearsome as the Demon King or Illidan from Warcraft, could exhibit such a gentle side, much less that someone would dare to touch his head.

Sophia clearly felt the vehicle make a sharp turn, glancing helplessly at the driver, then back at Z. Z shot the driver a disinterested glance before returning his attention to her. “You’re still young; you won’t wither so easily. I’ll make you the most beautiful sunflower in the world.” It seemed he relaxed a bit, though his smile carried a hint of sarcasm—not directed at her, but rather at himself. “I’m going to start trying to like this world because of you.”

Sophia felt a bit overwhelmed. “I thought you’d rather destroy this world and create a new one according to your vision?”

Z scoffed lightly. “Not really destruction; those who deserve to die will still die. As for everyone else, they may be annoying, but you probably prefer a lively, bustling life.” He rubbed his forehead, which was still throbbing from the recent stress, dismissing any concern for his own unusual state of being. He added responsibly, “Since you don’t want a world with just the two of us, I’ll give you a world filled with people.”

As for her health, it was possible it had deteriorated because of him, and while he would ensure she was safe, they couldn’t afford to act recklessly like before. After all… Z cast a complex glance at Sophia, his lips tightening into a thin line.

After all, he wasn’t all-powerful. 

The world is vast, and there are some problems he cannot resolve. The regrets left behind by the original creator were not something he could fix quickly. Z still recalled the words of An Jun, feeling the severe deterioration of his own body, which had unfortunately affected her as well. He needed to find a quiet place at the right time to deal with this matter alone, prioritizing her issues over his own. After all, compensating for what was broken was only fair.

He had never considered himself a good person before, but now, that perception was beginning to change.
