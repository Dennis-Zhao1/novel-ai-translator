Could it be a scalpel? She instinctively thought so, but upon closer inspection, she realized it wasn't a scalpel at all—it was a pair of handcuffs!

"What do you want to do?" Sophia Wang exclaimed in terror, retreating until she rounded a few desks and positioned herself in front of the blackboard, using the podium as a barrier between them.

"What do I want to do?" Z chuckled lightly, mirroring her question. In just a few strides, he crossed to the other side of the podium and leaned in, effortlessly locking her wrist in place. It was as if he had planned this moment all along.

A mix of shame and anger surged within her. She had thought she was far enough away, but she had underestimated his height and speed. Gritting her teeth, she struggled against the handcuffs, only to watch helplessly as he secured the other end to her wrist and tossed the key into a beaker on the lab table. The mysterious liquid inside began to corrode the key almost instantly, a grim foreshadowing of the fate that awaited her.

"Weren't you asking what I wanted?" Z closed the distance between them slowly, his voice low yet laced with danger. "I want you to remember that from today on, you belong to me. No one else is allowed to touch you."

Sophia pressed her back against the blackboard, a fire of rage igniting within her, but she dared not show it. "This is a school, not your territory! Outside, there are people who want you gone! If you mess around, I’ll—"

"Expose my identity?" he interrupted, his tone dismissive. "You had plenty of chances to say something, but you didn’t. Now, if you do, you’ll only be digging your own grave."

He took a step closer, and she panicked, trying to sidestep him, but the handcuffs restricted her movements. Leaning in near her ear, he whispered, "Do you know why I came here? It’s for you. If you had just listened to me and not gone with those people, we would have left this place ages ago."

Sophia couldn't help but snap back, "Don’t put all the blame on me! You never intended to let me go, did you?"

Z remained silent, his gaze fixed on her, those eyes as deep and inscrutable as the night sky. Slowly, he raised his hand and gently grasped her chin, forcing her to meet his intense stare. "I won’t deny that. But have you ever considered that without me, you might not be alive right now?"

Sophia froze, feeling his breath linger close to her ear, a pressure she couldn’t ignore. She tried to maintain her composure, but her voice trembled slightly, "What do you want from me?"

Z chuckled softly, his laughter deep and raspy. "I just want you to understand that no matter where you go, I can always find you."

He rested his hand on her shoulder, leaning in closer. Sophia held her breath, her heart pounding like a drum. As she struggled to push him away, she felt her strength waning. The cold lab equipment around them reflected faint light, and a wave of despair washed over her.

"Don’t be afraid," Z murmured, a hint of unexpected softness in his tone. "I won’t hurt you."

His hand slid down her shoulder, pulling her away from the blackboard and toward the lab table. She stared intently at his face, searching for any hint of emotion, but his expression remained inscrutable. His gaze was too complex, as if he were stifling some hidden feeling.

"I won’t let anyone hurt you, not even yourself," he said quietly, his calmness unnerving her.

In that moment, Sophia felt as if she was beginning to understand something, yet she couldn’t fully grasp it. Within her, a tumult of emotions churned: on one hand, fear, and on the other, an unsettling sense of dependency that she was reluctant to acknowledge.
