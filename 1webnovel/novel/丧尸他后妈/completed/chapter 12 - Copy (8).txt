Chapter 12: A Night of Chaos

Z’s arrival was as silent as a shadow, but his presence carried an undeniable weight. Without preamble, he effortlessly invaded the fragile boundary of the moment, his pale face cold and unreadable under the dim moonlight.

“Good evening,” he greeted in his usual clipped tone, brushing aside the flap of the white coat he always wore. His dark eyes fixed on Sophia Wang, calm yet predatory.

Sophia stiffened. She had known that Z was unpredictable, but seeing him here, standing so casually amid the looming threat of danger, filled her with dread.

“You seem distressed. What a pity,” he added, his voice dripping with sarcasm. He leaned closer, his shadow nearly swallowing her.

Desperate to escape, she feigned a wobbly smile. “Distressed? No, no. Meeting you is the highlight of my night—an honor, really,” she lied, her voice trembling.

Z raised a brow, unimpressed. “Flattery will get you nowhere.”

Before she could make another excuse, Z took a step forward, his movements unnervingly smooth. His fingers brushed against her collarbone, and with a single motion, he pushed the flimsy white coat from her shoulders.

“Now, come with me,” he said, leaving no room for argument.

At the Temporary Camp
While Sophia dealt with Z’s chilling intentions, chaos erupted back at the camp.

The piercing sound of a scream shattered the night air, jerking Ouyang and his men into action. They dropped everything and sprinted toward the source of the noise.

When they arrived, they found their fellow team member on the ground, clutching a bleeding arm. Over him stood a wild-eyed Yin Ning, her chest heaving as though she had just woken from a nightmare. Her hand gripped a knife, its blade glinting with fresh blood under the faint light.

Ouyang’s face twisted in shock. “Yin Ning! What are you doing?!”

Yin Ning’s head snapped toward him, her gaze flickering between confusion and feral intensity. For a moment, her eyes glowed an eerie red, then shifted to a sickly green, before settling into their usual dark brown.

“I—I don’t know!” she cried out, her voice cracking. “What happened? What did I do?” She looked down at the knife in her hand and dropped it immediately, recoiling as though it burned her.

Ouyang bent to help the injured teammate, his mind racing. What in the world had just happened?

A Secret Departure
Far away from the camp, Z carried Sophia effortlessly through the dense underbrush.

“Let me go!” Sophia demanded, her voice muffled against his chest.

“Let you go?” Z repeated, his tone mocking. “You might as well ask me to relinquish oxygen. Neither is going to happen.”

He held her tighter, his tall frame cutting through the shadows as he deliberately led her down a hidden path. Despite her struggles, his grip never wavered.

“What do you want from me?” she asked, her voice trembling.

Z paused, his dark eyes flashing as they met hers. “I want you alive,” he said simply. “And away from the foolish mortals who don’t understand their place in this collapsing world.”

His words sent a chill down her spine.

“You’re insane,” she whispered.

He smirked. “Insanity is relative. Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it.”

Back at the camp, the group reeled from Yin Ning’s inexplicable behavior. With tensions high and no answers in sight, the only certainty was that the night’s chaos was far from over. And in the shadows, Z’s plans continued to unfold, meticulously weaving the threads of fate to tighten his grip on Sophia Wang—and the fragile remnants of humanity.
