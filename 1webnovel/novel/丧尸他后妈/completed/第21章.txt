Sophia Wang quietly glanced at Z, hesitating as she opened her mouth, unsure whether to voice her thoughts.

Z casually flicked his gaze towards her, his tone nonchalant. “If you have a different opinion, feel free to share. It’s the first time I’ve seen you so hesitant to speak up.”

Shifting a bit further into the bed, Sophia sat cross-legged in silence for a moment before finally saying, “I might make you angry with what I’m about to say, but I genuinely hope you’ll consider my suggestion. I’m being sincere this time.”

“Really?” Z raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “Go ahead, and I’ll decide if it’s worth considering.”

“…” Sophia fell silent for a moment before speaking in a low voice. “I believe that the kind of feeling you seek can be achieved without creating a new world. As long as you’re with the person you love, you can find that feeling anywhere.”

Z narrowed his eyes, observing her closely as she continued. “Look at what you’re doing. Your research is hurting innocent people all around the world. They have their own families, their own loved ones. If the feeling you desire is built on their suffering, you won’t truly be happy, will you?” Sophia suppressed her tone, her voice steady. “That’s not a perfect new world. Beneath it lies the pain of so many. Once the buried past resurfaces, that new world will revert to an old one. What will you do then?”

“Then I’ll just destroy it and rebuild,” Z replied flatly, without much emotion.

Sophia shook her head, her lips pressed tight, refusing to say anything more.

She was different from most people, exuding a fresh and elegant aura. When she wasn’t smiling, the corners of her mouth slightly sagged, but when she did smile, the curve was particularly beautiful. She had a perfect 32C bust, but sadly, she was slowly aging.

Z was surprised to find a single white hair among Sophia’s flowing black locks. He reached out, pinching it between his fingers and pulling it out, leaving Sophia momentarily stunned.

“You’re still so young; how do you have white hair already?” Z asked softly, though it seemed he didn’t expect an answer. His long fingers traced the roots of her hair before he plucked the white strand away.

Sophia looked at the white hair in his hand, unbothered. “Everyone ages, and you will too. Overthinking can kill brain cells, and your hair will gradually turn white. Soon enough, you won’t escape it either. What will happen to your new world then?” She spoke earnestly. “Though we’re not on the same path, I still hope to take this opportunity for a calm discussion. I believe that as long as you’re with the person you love and your family, wherever you go will be the best world.”

“Is that so?” Z mused, his gaze on the white hair he held, seemingly deep in thought.

Sophia continued, “It’s hard to say if it’s true, but I believe it’s better than the current situation. Look outside; everything feels lifeless. The living can’t escape, and the dead can’t find peace. The entire world feels like a dead city.” She looked deeply into his dark eyes. “Can you imagine? This is what you built brick by brick; this is your vision of a new world?”

“Alright,” Z interrupted her. “I understand what you’re saying.”

“…That’s great.”

“Though it’s not that I fully understand. I’m just less confused and perplexed now,” he said with a hint of pessimism. “You have too rosy a view of this world.”

“That’s not a fantasy,” Sophia sighed. “Let me put it this way: when you were younger, your view of the world must have been different from now. Everyone has a past; the younger you should be able to understand what I’m saying.”

“Past?” Z raised an eyebrow, seemingly puzzled. He looked at Sophia, speaking slowly, “You’re mistaken. Some people don’t have a past. That person is me. I have no past, nor a future, so I need to create a future for myself.” He lifted his chin, exuding a certain arrogance, his long bangs brushing against his glasses, his gaze cool. “Z, that’s my designation.”

“…Designation?” Sophia stared at him in disbelief. The original story didn’t mention Z’s past; he had a limited appearance, often appearing only to conclude an arc, and the ending was open-ended, leaving questions about his relationship with Yi Ning unanswered. Her knowledge on this front was quite lacking...

In that moment, she realized her previous thoughts were somewhat idealized. She had always viewed the people here as mere NPCs, never considering truly sharing her thoughts or integrating into this world.

But now, she deeply understood that they were all living, breathing individuals, and she had no chance of returning to her own world. This place would be where she spent the rest of her life, and what she faced was not a fictional character from a book, but a real person, full of flesh and blood, capable of laughter and tears.

“You know, that cutting-edge technology that selects the best sperm and egg from two outstanding individuals to create a ‘human’ with optimal genes? I’m the last of those experiments, the only one who succeeded,” he said, a hint of a smile gracing his lips. “There are 26 of us; you know the alphabet, right?”

Sophia’s lips twitched as she didn’t know how to respond, only nodding slightly.

Z looked at her, opening his mouth to say something but unable to find the words. He knew many things, yet he couldn’t apply them to emotions. Expressions like “I like you” or “I want to be by your side to experience the world you talked about” felt impossible to utter.

In the end, Z simply said softly, “Regarding your argument, how will you prove that you’re right? Don’t use those hormone-driven couples as examples; that will only expedite this world’s demise.”

Sophia looked at him in surprise, not expecting him to genuinely consider her words. His past made her more cautious around him, worried that she might inadvertently touch on a painful subject.

After thinking for a moment, she guessed that the couple he referred to was likely Yi Ning and Ouyang. Hesitating slightly, she suggested, “Why don’t you try places without them? There are still many good people in the world. Aren’t you good at persuading people? You could blend into other bases and do some good deeds. I guarantee you’ll meet someone who might change your mind.”

Z suppressed the urge to scoff, his tone oddly questioning, “Are you sure?”

“Of course!”

“Then it’s settled.” Z clapped his hands together. “To prevent you from fabricating stories to send me away, you’ll come with me.”

“Eh?” Sophia stared at him blankly. “What’s going on? Why are you suddenly involving me?”

“This was your suggestion; you need to take responsibility for it. If you’re right, we’ll all be happy. If not…” Z smirked coldly and lay back on the bed, a hint of pity in his voice. “Then you’ll join me in the effort to create a new world.”

Sophia’s lips twitched as she looked at him lying on the bed. “You’re not planning to leave, are you?”

Z rested his head on his hands, his slender eyes glancing at her. “You don’t need to worry. Your attitude towards me tells me what kind of relationship we have. It’s probably okay for now, but that’s fine. After all, it’s in human nature to be close or to feel like strangers. I won’t touch you. Just sleep easy.”

“But…”

“Sophia Wang, once my patience runs out, I will leave you. Don’t rush,” he said, turning to face her, propping his head on one hand. “Now sleep?”

“…I really don’t understand you,” Sophia muttered, pulling the blankets tightly around herself, leaving only her head exposed. She turned her back to him, falling into silence, appearing as though she had fallen asleep.

Z lay beside her, and this was their first time sleeping peacefully together. If luck was on their side, they might coexist until dawn. Yet, inside, he felt an uncontrollable itch, a desire to do something.

Z was a pragmatic person. He was used to putting his thoughts into action, so he stealthily reached into Sophia’s blanket, his fingers slipping beneath her clothes to tickle her. She initially resisted, but soon after, she burst into laughter, struggling as the tickling sensation brought tears to her eyes. Z couldn’t help but smile, leaning in to kiss her laughing lips.

He removed his glasses and gently kissed her soft lips, not delving deeper or engaging in anything else, just softly pressing against her as he wrapped his arms around her, trailing kisses up to her nose, her forehead, and finally to her hair, tenderly as if the sharp-tongued man he usually was had vanished.

With her eyes open, Sophia breathed slowly as he held her, listening to his steady heartbeat, inhaling the faint scent of soap from his clean shirt and lab coat. Suddenly, she called out to him.

“Z?”

“Hmm?” His voice came from above her, deep and slightly husky, more alluring than ever.

Sophia’s heart raced as she moved slightly, but he held her even tighter. She couldn’t help but tremble again, and he gently patted her back, easing his grip as he held her. In a hushed tone, she thought she heard him say, “What can I do to help you sleep soundly?”

That night, they truly did nothing, marking their first night together, simply holding each other as they slept. But when dawn broke, Sophia knew everything had changed.

Z wasn’t the type to say sweet nothings or confess his feelings, but he was the kind of person who put thoughts and promises into action. He rose early, bustling around, needing nothing from her. She simply waited in the room, and he returned after just an hour, naturally reaching out for her hand with a smile. “All done, let’s go?”

Sophia bit her lip, hesitating as she looked at him. She wasn’t sure if he was deceiving her or genuinely trying to be a good person. But after last night, she wanted to try to believe in him, slowly breaking the habit of instinctively denying him.

She placed her hand in his, following him out of the room. They walked smoothly to the base’s entrance, where the molecular base's gates stood wide open. The Miyazaki father and son didn’t restrict their movements due to the poisoning incident; instead, they warmly sent them off. Z remained calm, carrying his suitcase as he stepped outside, unfazed by the stares of the Miyazakis and others.

“Get in the car,” he said, ushering her into a sleek black Lexus before climbing in himself. As he adjusted the driver’s seat, his long legs were a bit cramped, but he remained silent as he bent over.

In the midst of this strange silence, Z suddenly turned to her, warning, “Don’t even think about running away from me. I’m trying your suggestion; if you take off, I’ll make you pay.”

“Then it’s good if you really think that way.” Sophia breathed a sigh of relief. “Just don’t deceive me. As long as you genuinely want to reform and are willing to atone for your past mistakes, I’ll accompany you in this endeavor.”

Reform? He didn’t believe he had done anything wrong. Aside from considering how he might retaliate if she left him, everything else felt like a lie. The truth was, he simply wanted to keep her around—ha ha ha.

Z solemnly replied, “Of course, I’m trying to trust those words.”

Sophia felt a surge of happiness, thinking how noble it would be to pull such a rogue back onto the right path. Perhaps over time, he might even figure out a way to develop some potion to bring back those who had become zombies. He had gathered the best genes of humanity; surely nothing was impossible, just a matter of time.

Thus, they both walked down this “you trick me, I trick you” path, unaware that their encounters along the way would genuinely challenge and change their respective beliefs. Stubborn people would no longer remain stubborn, and bad individuals would not be purely evil. Their convictions would transform entirely, forged by each other and these unforgettable experiences.

“By the way,” Sophia suddenly turned to him. “Earlier, you said if I left, you’d retaliate against me. How would you do that? Come find me again?”

Z scoffed lightly. “Come find you? That would be punishing myself, right?”

“…”
