Z walked away expressionlessly, and Sophia Wang immediately followed. Ouyang, however, seemed to deliberately oppose him, standing still in place. Yining glanced at him and gave a subtle nod, prompting him to unwillingly follow them out of the small courtyard.

Z pulled out the dizzy Xiaoya from Miyazaki Yusuke's arms and bent down, gripping her arm as he looked down at her. When she met his cold black eyes, she shivered involuntarily. The sight reminded Sophia of the first time she encountered Z.

"Take me to your brother. He won't blame you for sneaking out; in fact, he’ll reward you," Z coaxed her like a child.

Xiaoya looked skeptical. "What do you want with my brother? You can go into that small building; you can't be a good person!"

Sophia immediately grasped the implication behind her words. That small building had once been a site for human experimentation. If this came to light, it could expose Z's true identity, jeopardizing their plan of being the 'good guys' in this dystopian world.

Z was not about to let his "charm offensive" fail. He swiftly used medical tape to seal Xiaoya's mouth. Xiaoya widened her eyes in shock, her face a mix of accusation and grievance. She struggled furiously, clearly unused to being treated this way.

Xiaoya was indeed the beloved sister of Xiao Cong, the governor of Atom, the second-largest base after Quantum. Even during the apocalypse, she had been showered with affection and was likely sheltered from any real hardship or fear.

Ouyang, filled with a "I am the savior" mentality, was also dissatisfied with Z’s actions. He seemed determined to rescue Xiaoya from Z’s "clutches," but he failed miserably. Z instantly drew a gun from his side and pressed it to Ouyang's forehead.

Ouyang froze in place, and Xiaoya dared not move either. Yining wanted to step forward, but Sophia instinctively positioned herself in front of her, bracing for any potential conflict or unwanted advances from Z.

Yining narrowed her eyes, her gaze on Sophia carrying a hint of something complex. The scrutiny made Sophia uncomfortable, so she averted her eyes and focused on Z and Xiaoya instead.

Z, satisfied with Sophia's instinctive defense of him, softened his attitude toward Xiaoya. "You need to learn to listen," he said to her before shifting his attention to Ouyang. "As for you..." He clicked his tongue, his tall figure casting a shadow over Ouyang, who looked particularly small in this standoff.

Z almost looked down on Ouyang as he said, half-smirking, "You seem quite agitated. Are you interested in the governor of Atom's prized possession?"

The clear sarcasm in his challenge made Ouyang's pride flare up. His bright green eyes glared at Z, fists clenched but unable to move, knowing the dark barrel of the gun pressed against his forehead meant any twitch could be fatal.

"I’ve noticed something was off about you for a while. You’re putting such pressure on a defenseless girl; who exactly are you?" Ouyang was perceptive enough to observe the weapon closely, frowning. "I’ve never seen a gun like that before. Don't tell me you designed it yourself."

Z looked at him as if he were an idiot. "If I didn't design it, do you think it would be you?" He tapped the gun against Ouyang's forehead, making him flinch, scream, and crouch down to shield his head, all dignity lost.

Yining watched Ouyang trembling on the ground in disappointment, puzzled as to how the once-gallant man she had seen at Quantum could turn into such a coward.

She couldn't help but compare Z and Ouyang in her mind, solidifying her resolve to win Z over. Why should Sophia Wang be treated differently? I deserve that attention too! Her lips tightened as she fixed her dark gaze on Sophia.

Sophia glanced back at her, her expression indifferent, blinking slowly before she bent down to secure Xiaoya's flailing wrist. To be honest, she had no patience left for the girl who had probably seen her and Z's little encounter—who knew how much she had witnessed? The thought of that innocent girl possibly knowing Z’s secrets made her uneasy.

Xiaoya seemed to sense the resentment emanating from Sophia. Their eyes met, and in that fleeting moment, they exchanged a basic understanding of one another.

"I hope you can reflect on your actions," Ouyang managed to regain some composure, feigning calm as he gazed at Z. "She's just a little girl. No matter what, you shouldn't treat her so roughly!"

Z clearly looked down on Ouyang, seemingly too lazy to share the same airspace with him. He lightly tapped Xiaoya’s cheek with the gun, signaling her to keep quiet and follow along, then turned and walked away without a backward glance.

Xiaoya, genuinely frightened, did not resist anymore and let Sophia guide her away. Yining followed Z without a word, while Miyazaki Yusuke trailed after her, fulfilling his father's orders, though his expression showed reluctance and disdain.

Ouyang stood alone in the courtyard, realizing he had been abandoned. He stood dazed for a moment, his mind racing with thoughts but not settling on any conclusion, ultimately deciding to follow the group out of there.

Back at their temporary resting spot, Z retrieved a pair of handcuffs from the vehicle and secured Xiaoya's wrists. Her big eyes turned red, looking at Z with a mix of hurt and pleading, but he refused to acknowledge her, completely unfazed. She then shifted her gaze to Sophia.

Sophia was still preoccupied with what Xiaoya might have seen. As Xiaoya continued to stare at her, Sophia couldn't help but think about the implications of those big, red eyes potentially witnessing Z's private moments. What was this urge to dig deeper? It was almost enough to shatter her worldview!

Despair washed over Xiaoya as she shifted her gaze to the only person who had spoken up for her—Ouyang. 

Ouyang, caught by her soft gaze, felt a surge of righteousness again, suppressing his instinctive fear as he shouted at Z, "Enough! She's just a little girl. She can’t do anything. If she’s not struggling anymore, just let her go! You’re a man; can’t you reflect on your actions?!"

Z had initially intended to assign Xiaoya her role, to be their guide and connection to her brother, leading them to the core of Atom. But Ouyang's interference sparked a thought in Z’s mind: perhaps it would be better to eliminate these nuisances right here.

"Why should I reflect?" Z coldly retorted, glaring at Ouyang. "If she dares to sneak out, she should be prepared to be caught. I'm not her brother, nor her father. What should I reflect on? That time and money can be gained? If not, then shut your mouth."

"You!..." Ouyang fumed, wanting to argue back but found himself at a loss for words, his mouth agape, eyes reddening with frustration as veins throbbed on his forehead. "Don’t get too cocky! Don’t think I’m afraid of you!" He resorted to threatening to regain some dignity. "I don’t even need this little girl to find Atom! Just follow my lead, and don’t hold us back!" He turned away haughtily towards the green pickup, but no one followed him.

Confused, Ouyang turned back, finding everyone staring at him in silence. His already fraying patience snapped further. "What are you all standing around for?! Didn’t we want to go to Atom? If you’re not moving, we might as well turn back!"

Z disregarded Xiaoya entirely, leaving her in Sophia's care. He crossed his arms, watching Ouyang with a smirk, disdain evident on his face. "Let me ask you something. Do you know that the main gates of the Atom base are sealed due to the zombie siege? Where the real entry point is remains unknown, and they haven’t informed any of the bases."

"Why?" Miyazaki Yusuke interjected, puzzled.

Z replied nonchalantly, "Why? Probably because they think the sudden gathering of zombies around Atom is someone’s doing."

Yining turned her head away at this, avoiding Ouyang's gaze which sought her support. 

Feeling neglected, Ouyang instinctively looked at Sophia, who was completely focused on Z. They stood together, wearing matching uniforms, and in the sunlight, they looked like the perfect couple.

Ouyang snapped. He could no longer contain himself and lunged at Z, but his three subordinates blocked him. Frustrated, he glared at Z. "Why should I listen to you? I was a captain at Quantum! What are you?!"

Ouyang’s pathetic display only highlighted Z’s composed perfection. Ouyang appeared like a rabid dog, while Z maintained a calm smile, exuding a strong presence. The contrast between them was far more entertaining than any potential outcome.

Z looked at Ouyang with a tone of contempt, "Do you realize you’re asking for death? I always take shortcuts, and whatever I decide is undoubtedly the right choice. Do you think wasting my time will kill me? I suggest you give up those unrealistic fantasies because with your intellect, you’ll never achieve them—mortal."

Indeed, if Sophia weren’t standing right next to him, he would have already silenced this fool with a scalpel. He felt a twinge of guilt; he had thought Sophia was slow, yet he never anticipated there could be someone as foolish as Ouyang. The realization was surprising. 

Life is full of things that are beyond our control, but stupidity is something we bring upon ourselves.
