Z drove along the empty asphalt road with Sophia Wang beside him. The daylight allowed glimpses of the scenery around them, but as evening approached, the sky darkened, transforming into a canvas of shadows that felt as if countless threads were controlling the hidden specters lurking in the darkness.

Sophia's gaze was complex as she observed Z, who seemed tireless and utterly focused on driving. His eyes were fixed straight ahead, and he appeared to concentrate all his energy on the road. Sometimes, he didn't even blink. If it weren't for the steady rise and fall of his chest, she might have thought he had turned to stone.

"Um..." Sophia began softly, her tone slightly weak.

Z abruptly turned his head to look at her. "What's wrong?"

"… Aren't you hungry? You've been driving all day. Maybe we could find a place to stop and grab a bite to eat?" Sophia suggested, trying to sound discreet.

Z paused for a moment, not answering right away, but he eventually pulled the car over to the side of the road. After switching on some oddly glowing headlights, he began searching for food.

As he rummaged through supplies, he said, "Sorry, I forgot that your stamina isn't as high; you need to intake a larger amount of food."

"… I think my stamina is fine. I just don't have your level of endurance. I still need to eat normally," Sophia replied, accepting a pack of compressed biscuits. She grimaced before taking small bites.

Z adjusted his glasses, drumming his fingers absentmindedly on the steering wheel. Suddenly, he heard her ask, "What are your plans next?"

Z shot her a glance, the corners of his mouth turning down slightly. "Don't ask me. It sounds like you think you're at my mercy."

"Eh?" Sophia looked puzzled. "Isn't this mission primarily led by you?"

"Are you going to raise any objections no matter how I arrange things?"

"… Maybe, as long as what you decide is sensible."

Z smiled knowingly. "That’s great to hear. Rest easy; my plans will definitely have no issues. We don't need to go to Quantum or Molecular; it’s too far from here. Let's head straight to the Atomic Base instead. The governor, Xiao Cong, has a decent head on his shoulders."

Sophia frowned slightly at his words. It wasn't that she was dissatisfied with his plans, but Xiao Cong was also a character in the original story—a member of Yi Ning's harem. As Z described, he was composed, wise, a strong leader, and quite capable. However, a significant part of the reason behind Wang Baozi's demise in the original tale was indeed due to Xiao Cong's involvement.

If it hadn't been for him helping Yi Ning capture Wang Baozi, who was trying to expose her, Wang Baozi wouldn't have contracted the virus, leading to his gruesome death.

Thinking back to that bloody scene made Sophia lose her appetite. She set down the barely touched biscuits and fell into a heavy silence.

Noticing her sudden gloom, Z was about to ask what was wrong when his keen hearing picked up on something unusual around them.

He quickly turned off the car lights, his finger pressing several buttons on the modified dashboard. A three-dimensional recognition wall sprang up around the car, green frames swiftly scanning the surrounding solid objects and organic lifeforms. A bright white frame outlined a nearby creature, and the word "DANGER" flashed in red letters at the top right corner, accompanied by four exclamation marks.

"Are there zombies?!" Sophia immediately tensed up, scanning their surroundings with vigilance. Z sighed at her panicked expression, clearly exasperated. "It's just people."

"… What’s dangerous about people?" Sophia awkwardly relaxed her guard and cleared her throat.

Z pointedly remarked, "People can be dangerous. They fight tooth and nail for things they can't have and then disregard them once they do. You’re no different." He seemed to lament, "Life is cruel."

Sophia disagreed, "That's not true; I’m different."

"Really?" Z raised an eyebrow.

"Yeah," she looked him in the eye earnestly. "Because the things I like I can never have."

"…" Z stared at her for five seconds, expressionless, before looking away. He turned off the three-dimensional recognition wall, adjusted his glasses, and calmly said, "It’s someone I know. Look." He pointed ahead.

Sophia followed his gaze and saw Yi Ning and Ouyang jumping out of a green pickup truck. Yi Ning, full of energy, tossed her long hair and ran excitedly in their direction, while Ouyang gazed at her with a fond expression, slowly walking over with Miyazaki Youji, who had just stepped out.

"What a persistent bunch," Sophia groaned. "We need to go now; it’s not too late."

Z casually leaned against the seat, interest piqued. "What’s wrong? You really don’t want to see them? Do you still have feelings for Ouyang?"

Sophia looked at him in astonishment. "How do you know about that?" She quickly realized her slip and backtracked, "Ugh! Who likes him? I never liked him, okay? Let's just go." She impatiently shoved Z, eager to leave.

Z remained unfazed. "If you don’t like him, prove it to me. Why the rush to leave? Didn’t you just say people aren’t dangerous?"

"Anyone else is fine, just not them!" Sophia frowned at the approaching group, exasperated. "You’re not actually falling for them, are you? If you want to stay, you can. I’m leaving." With that, she reached for the steering wheel.

Z firmly held her down, returning her to the passenger seat. He calmly straightened his clothes that she had messed up. "I said we’re not leaving. Don’t try to change my mind, or it might backfire." He seemed to sense Sophia's impending frustration, so he gently ruffled her hair and softened his tone. "Just know that you’re the only person I truly want to keep with me. Don’t overthink it."

"I’m not overthinking anything." Sophia felt a headache coming on as she watched Z, who was acting like a "professional rebel," and she deeply realized his stubbornness. He couldn't accept anyone else's dissent; it felt like a challenge to his authority. Even if he didn’t declare it immediately, he would be mentally organizing a rebuttal. In his world, he was the queen!

Ah, she couldn’t help but wonder if he was genuinely turning over a new leaf… Sophia worriedly covered her face and turned away, unable to bear looking at Yi Ning, who was knocking on the driver's side window.

Z opened the window calmly, looking down at Yi Ning and Ouyang. He sensed the hostility emanating from Ouyang and coolly met his gaze, making Ouyang momentarily taken aback, as he had never encountered such rudeness before.

Yi Ning compared the two and felt even more convinced to abandon her backup plan for the glamorous high-roller. However, she realized that Ouyang might not even qualify as a backup at this point; he was barely a jack.

Yi Ning smiled sweetly at Z, saying happily, "I knew you’d head this way! I found you!" She tilted her head proudly. "Where's Sophia? Governor Wang is worried sick about her. Why won’t she just go home?"

Sophia turned to the side, completely ignoring them, not wanting to utter a single word.

Z answered on her behalf. "Sorry, you misunderstood. It was I who invited her to keep me company. She’s only here because I begged her to spend a little time with me."

Ouyang forcefully wrapped an arm around Yi Ning's shoulders and retorted stiffly, "You invited the young lady to keep you company? Do you even know who she is? And who are you?"

"I do," Z replied nonchalantly. "Her name is Sophia Wang, the only daughter of Quantum Governor Wang Jie. She’s twenty-three this year, born in the Year of the Rabbit, and her zodiac sign is Libra."

"…" Ouyang’s mouth twitched. "You seem to know quite a bit."

"Yes, I also know that you were once her fiancé, and because of this young lady's interference, your relationship has since crumbled," Z said, stating the painfully awkward truth that left everyone present feeling uncomfortable.

Yi Ning awkwardly tried to pull away from Ouyang’s grip, wanting to clarify, "No, you’re misunderstanding; Ouyang and I…"

"Are you here to find me, or are you here to find him?" Sophia interjected, unable to listen any longer, leaning onto Z's shoulder to look down at them.
