"Sophia?" Wang Jie noticed that Sophia Wang was standing there, utterly indifferent and unresponsive, and he couldn't help but frown. He repeated his request sternly, "Hurry up, come to your father!"

Isn't there supposed to be a 'Daddy loves you' in there too? Sophia shot him a glance, making a dismissive sound. "Am I supposed to walk over just to get killed by you?"

Wang Jie was taken aback, looking at her as if he couldn't believe his ears. His hands, which hung limply at his sides, began to tremble, as though he were struggling to contain his emotions, clutching his chest as if he couldn't bear the weight of her words. "What do you mean by that?!"

"If you can't hear me clearly, I'll repeat myself," Sophia said coolly.

Z still had that charming smirk plastered on his face, his confidence and arrogance shimmering in his eyes. He casually strolled to the side, leaning against a tree, exuding an incredibly gentle aura, yet somehow lacking any sense of goodwill.

"Wang Zhouzhang, now do you see I'm not lying to you?" At that moment, Yi Ning suddenly jumped in to add fuel to the fire. From where she stood, her words were somewhat justified; after all, in such dire circumstances, the first instinct for everyone was to think of themselves.

Wang Jie looked at Sophia with disappointment etched on his face. "You've really hurt your father's feelings."

Sophia shrugged, a faint smirk playing on her lips. "The man I admire once said something that has stuck with me: 'I don’t want to hurt your feelings, but I definitely don’t want you to hurt mine.'"

Z interjected, intrigued. "The man you admire? Who is he?"

Sophia instinctively replied, "Chen Daoming."

"Who? Is he dead or something?" 

"..." Why do I suddenly feel an urge to strangle him?

"Enough." Wang Jie gritted his teeth, forcing a smile. "Very well, since that's the case, we no longer need to hold back."

"Wang Zhouzhang." Jie Anjun put on a righteous facade. "Hold on, Miss Wang might just be confused for a moment."

"People can change," Yi Ning sneered, a smirk dancing on her lips. "Even a gourd on the same vine can grow crooked."

Wang Jie's deep-set eyes swept over her, and she furrowed her brow, looking away into silence.

Wang Jie straightened his lips, redirecting his gaze back to Sophia, as if he were looking through her to someone else. Moments later, he sighed. "Fine, no one is obligated to save someone who is lost in darkness."

People really do change. Sophia deeply resonated with that statement. She felt transformed herself, as she looked at these people, a strong urge to wipe them all out surged within her.

Jie Anjun's face turned pale, his lips pressed tightly together as he lingered in the shadows of the crowd, occasionally glancing at Z, looking utterly conflicted.

Z walked over to Sophia, politely asking, "Can I begin now?"

Sophia had been curious about the person Z mentioned earlier who needed "emotion." Given the current situation, that person should be making an appearance now, right? She looked at Z with a questioning gaze, seeking clarification.

Z smiled obediently, ready to enlighten her, but before that, he presented an enormous challenge to the group before him.

His long, slender fingers tapped rhythmically on the screen of his portable computer, clearly preparing for something significant. Yet, the group, armed with guns, didn’t dare make a move against Z, who had already discarded his weapon.

Once bitten, twice shy; they had developed a habitual fear of Z.

Their fear was justified. Z swiftly concluded his computer operation, pulling Sophia back a few steps. The flowing fabric of his white lab coat danced softly in the wind, gradually settling into calmness.

However, as it settled, a greater turbulence emerged.

A bridge was obliterated from below by an unknown object; earth and rubble mixed with dust blurred the scene. Sophia stood beside Z, within the pre-calculated safe zone, feeling for the first time just how brilliant the man next to her truly was.

For the first time, she realized that Z was indeed a super genius, crafted from the most perfect genes on Earth.

Turning her gaze toward him, she saw him gazing at the emerging silver mech through the dust with a smile, then he turned to her, proudly asking, "What do you think? It took a little time, but the effect looks pretty good."

"A little time?" 

Sophia was utterly impressed, and she certainly wouldn’t criticize it. Her reaction pleased Z, who watched as his designed mech warrior landed smoothly on the ground. It stood firm, its form and height impressively commanding.

"Is that... Megatron?" Sophia asked, her curiosity piqued.

Z’s lips twitched in denial. "What is that? I've never heard of it."

"Don't kid around! It looks exactly like him! You based it off Megatron, didn't you? I didn’t know you were a Transformers fan!" Sophia seemed to have missed the main point entirely, especially as the group across from them stood frozen, unable to flee or fight, staring at their uncertain future with regret for following Jie Anjun into madness.

Z had no desire to discuss that topic with Sophia. Why would he admit to something so trivial? Although... no, there were no 'although's.

He stepped forward a few paces, positioning himself before the mech. The silver warrior stood at attention, its electronic voice steady and deep: "Hello, sir."

"Good boy." Z affectionately patted the mech's leg, his eyes gleaming as he turned toward Jie Anjun and the others. "You haven’t seen my latest invention, have you? I brought it out for you to see. Any suggestions you might want to give me?" He paused for a moment, then suddenly added, "Vice Governor Xiao, if you want to stay alive to see your sister, you’d better come here quickly."

Xiao Cha had remained silent the entire time, his quiet demeanor somewhat strange. The others hadn’t noticed, as Z's presence was overwhelmingly strong, making it hard for anyone to focus on anyone else.

Z's words pushed Xiao Cha to the forefront, and while others expected it to be Z's divisive tactic, little did they know he had successfully instigated division.

Without a word, Xiao Cha quickly joined Sophia behind the mech, standing shoulder to shoulder with her, leaving Sophia feeling slightly overwhelmed.

"What is this...?" she asked, her lips twitching in confusion.

Z said gently, "Vice Governor Xiao is a man who knows the situation. Now that he’s lost his elder brother, he can’t afford to lose his beloved sister. Although he has another sister, that young lady should currently be..." He glanced at Jie Anjun, his gaze deep and captivating, "with the ions, am I right, X?"

"X?" Gong Qingsuke frowned in confusion, subtly distancing himself from Jie Anjun.

Jie Anjun's body was a significant disadvantage; he lacked the physicality to contend with Z and had to rely on his wits. In a typical scenario, he would keep a safe distance, but for the sake of Yue Taoliang’s life, he had no choice but to tread this perilous path.

Jie Anjun stared at Z, struggling to maintain his composure against the onslaught of emotions battling within him. With bloodshot eyes, he stepped forward with great difficulty. "You think this means I won't fight back?"

"Perhaps you care more about the safety of that Miss Yue?" Z cast an indifferent glance at Xiao Cha.

Receiving the message, Xiao Cha replied apathetically, "Yaya will handle what you requested. When the time comes, please keep your promise."

"I will," Z boasted without a hint of shame. "I always keep my word."

Sophia was tempted to scoff, but she realized she'd probably never get that chance again because the person she wanted to criticize was simply too formidable…

Jie Anjun was a clever man and naturally understood the implications of their conversation. His eyes widened in shock. "What have you done to Xiao Yue?!"

Yi Ning stepped forward to support the unsteady Jie Anjun, while Gong Qingsuke and Wang Jie exchanged glances, secretly distancing themselves and searching for an escape route.

"You'll soon reunite with Y underground," Z said with a malicious grin.

Jie Anjun froze, momentarily unable to process such devastating news. Meanwhile, Wang Jie and Gong Qingsuke dealt him another crushing blow—they… had fled.
