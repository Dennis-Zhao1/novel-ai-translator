Chapter 14: The Road to Chaos

Driving sounded glamorous in theory, but in reality, it was exhausting—especially for someone as directionally challenged as Sophia Wang.

She kept one eye on the high-tech navigation device and the other on the road, her nerves frayed as she scanned for potential threats. Every darkened shadow on the horizon felt like it could leap into her path at any moment. After only a short time behind the wheel, she was already drained.

Switching her headlights to low beam, she navigated through what appeared to be a small, deserted town. The mist that hung in the air caught the glow of the streetlights, giving the scene an eerie ambiance. She slowed the car, pulling over onto the roadside near a curve.

Sophia grabbed the navigation device from its mount, flipping it over in her hands. The sleek, advanced gadget seemed out of place in her shaky grip. Inevitably, her mind wandered to Z, the one who had given her the device, his ever-present smirk flashing vividly in her mind.

Startled, she flinched, and the navigation unit tumbled from her hands to the floor. Bending to retrieve it, she straightened to find something dart across the front of the car. Her breath caught, and she quickly switched off the headlights, locking the doors in one swift motion.

Sitting in tense silence, she reassured herself. This is a Mercedes. It’s sturdy. Nothing’s getting through. The steering wheel’s iconic logo gleamed faintly in the darkness.

Reaching into the suitcase Z had packed, Sophia pulled out the vial of anti-zombie solution. After a moment’s hesitation, she uncapped it and dabbed the liquid onto her neck and arms. The act was equal parts precaution and self-comfort.

Still, the idea of spending the night in such a setting made her skin crawl. She tossed the vial back into the suitcase, grabbed a packet of compressed biscuits, and began to eat as she kept an anxious watch outside the window.

Twenty minutes passed uneventfully, and Sophia’s nerves began to calm. Crumpling the empty biscuit wrapper in her hand, she debated whether to toss it outside but decided against it. No sense in drawing unnecessary attention.

It was almost 2 a.m., and the thought crossed her mind that this was prime zombie-horror-movie time. Alone in the car, she felt a shiver crawl up her spine. Being around Z earlier hadn’t been nearly as nerve-wracking.

Well, of course, she thought. Z is like their creator—a dad to all zombies. They probably don’t even bother him.

That strange thought was oddly comforting, and she began to relax. But sleep? That was a different matter.

Unable to settle, Sophia fiddled with the navigation device, swiping and tapping at the screen like she was playing a game. But just as she grew bored, the screen flickered, and the map display disappeared.

“What the—” she muttered, her stomach dropping.

The screen went black. Panic set in as she fiddled with the buttons, desperate to restart it. Suddenly, a loud thump jolted her. Sophia froze, staring out the windshield.

A bloodied, grotesque face loomed just outside the glass.

Sophia screamed, scrambling back into her seat. The zombie clawed at the window, its decayed fingers leaving streaks on the glass.

Breaking Through the Horde
Regaining her composure, Sophia realized the car was airtight, and the scent of the solution on her skin wouldn’t escape. That should mean the zombies wouldn’t come in swarms... right?

Wrong.

The noise outside grew louder as more undead gathered, drawn by the sound of her scream.

With no better option, Sophia started the engine. Slamming her foot on the gas, she plowed forward, sending a slow-moving zombie flying. Blood and gore splattered across the windshield, obscuring her view.

She gritted her teeth, gripping the wheel tightly. The car jolted as it rolled over a body, the sickening crunch reverberating through her seat.

Focus, she told herself. Don’t stop.

But as she drove on, it became painfully clear that she’d gone the wrong way. Both ahead and behind, more zombies were closing in.

“Damn it! Why couldn’t I keep my hands to myself?!” Sophia cursed herself for tinkering with the navigation device earlier.

A Distant Light
Panicking, Sophia reached for the navigation device again, pressing buttons at random. When the device flickered to life, her relief was short-lived. Instead of the map, an image appeared: Z, seated in his lab, staring straight at her through the screen.

“Z!” Sophia exclaimed, her voice breaking with relief.

His usual smirk softened into something almost kind. He adjusted his glasses, his calm demeanor a stark contrast to her frantic state. “So,” he drawled, “changed your mind? Regretting your choices already?”

“Cut the crap!” she interrupted. “I’m surrounded! The map’s gone, and there are zombies everywhere. You’re their ‘dad’—tell me how to fix this!”

Z’s eyebrow twitched, but he maintained his composure. “The car is reinforced. They can’t break through. Just sit tight and wait for them to lose interest.”

Sophia’s jaw dropped. “Lose interest? Are you kidding me?!”

Z sighed. “Fine. See the black button on the right side of the steering wheel? Press it.”

Fumbling in the dark, Sophia found the button and pressed it.

Instantly, a blinding light flooded the area. The zombies froze, then bolted in every direction, fleeing as if their undead lives depended on it.

Sophia gaped. “What the—? Did they just—?!”

“It’s an ultraviolet deterrent,” Z explained, smirking as he adjusted his seat. “Happy now?”

“Yeah, thanks,” Sophia muttered, her tone thick with sarcasm. “Now, how do I get the map back?”

“Easy,” Z said with a shrug. “Do exactly what you did to turn it off.”

Sophia glared at the screen. “If I knew how I did it, I wouldn’t need to ask you!”

Z’s smirk widened. “You’re lucky I’m patient,” he said, and with a few keystrokes on his end, the map display reappeared.

Sophia exhaled in relief. “Okay, great. Thanks. I’ll get going now.”

But before she could cut the connection, Z’s expression darkened. “Remember,” he said, his voice low, “don’t deviate from the route. I’ll be watching.”

On the Road Again
Following the map, Sophia navigated through a series of rural paths. Fields of wheat and corn stretched endlessly on either side, a stark contrast to the chaos she’d just escaped. Eventually, she reached an abandoned highway toll station.

As the first hints of dawn painted the sky, Sophia pulled over. Exhausted, she locked the car and crawled into the backseat. Wrapping herself in a blanket, she closed her eyes, though her sleep was light and restless.

She was jarred awake not long after by the sensation of the car rocking. Sitting up, she peeked out the window.

It wasn’t zombies this time.

A group of five people stood around the car, their faces human but their intentions unclear.

Sophia adjusted the seatbelt across her lap, her mind racing. Then, with a flicker of determination, she reopened the navigation screen.

And there he was again.

Z appeared, his disheveled hair falling into his face as he glared at her through the screen. His voice was low and dangerous.

“Sophia,” he said, his tone like a warning. “Do you know where the last person who woke me up is now?”

Sophia blinked, taken aback. “W-Where?”

Z smirked, his expression sending a shiver down her spine.

“You’ll find out soon enough.”

And just like that, Sophia knew—some mistakes were far worse than turning off a navigation system.
