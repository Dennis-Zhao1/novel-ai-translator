Chapter 5: The Unthinkable Bargain
“Studies show that sex is a physiological activity that helps men relieve stress,” Z stated without the faintest hint of emotion, his voice clinical as if he were discussing an experiment. “Through intercourse and ejaculation, one can ease tension and alleviate pressure.”

Sophia Wang stared at him, slack-jawed and stunned. After a moment of gaping like a fish out of water, she finally managed to croak, “…Oh.”

Her reaction must have amused him because Z’s sharp, cold eyes lingered on her longer than necessary. He seemed to be observing her with mild curiosity, as though she were a particularly interesting test subject. Then, he dropped his gaze slightly and murmured, “Apologies.”

Sophia barely had time to exhale in relief before he added flatly, “I’ll begin now.”

“Wait—what?!” Sophia yelped, backing away and clutching her arms over her chest. “What do you mean, ‘begin’?!”

Z stood up, towering over her with an air of calm indifference. His lips curled into a faint, unreadable smirk. “Feigning ignorance?”

“…”

“Fine.” Z reached into his pocket and pulled out a small vial, holding it up lazily between his thumb and forefinger. “Let me be clear, Wang. I only need you alive—how you stay alive is irrelevant to me.” He leaned down slightly, bringing the vial closer to her face. “You wanted this, didn’t you?”

As Sophia’s eyes locked on the small vial, her heart raced. But before she could grab it, Z reached into his other pocket and, like a magician performing a trick, revealed a larger vial—double the size of the first.

Her gaze flicked between the two vials, her greed barely concealed. She forced herself to resist lunging for them, her voice tight with barely contained desire. “I… I never said I wanted to live that long.”

Z chuckled, his long, narrow eyes curving into crescents. The unexpected warmth of his laugh sent a shiver down her spine.

But then, without warning, he tossed both vials to the ground.

The sound of shattering glass was deafening in the silence, and the precious liquid spilled across the floor like melted jewels.

“No!” Sophia’s breath hitched as she watched the serum spread, mixing with shards of glass and dirt.

Z straightened, brushing his hands together nonchalantly. “If you’re so eager to die, then by all means, don’t let me stop you.” He turned on his heel and walked toward the door. “Do try not to live too long.”

Sophia’s frustration boiled over. Months of effort for this—gone in seconds? No way.

“Wait!” she barked, leaping from the tub to crouch on the floor. Ignoring the filth, she scanned the ground, desperately looking for a way to salvage even a few drops.

Z’s voice drifted back to her, calm and mocking. “You’d better lick it up while you can. That serum evaporates quickly.” His footsteps approached, slow and deliberate. “Go ahead. I have plenty more where that came from.”

Sophia froze, glaring at the floor. His tall frame loomed over her, casting a shadow that swallowed her crouched form. Her hair, damp and disheveled, clung to her face as she clenched her fists.

Her pride warred with her survival instincts, but deep down, she knew there was no going back. I messed up the moment I left Quantum Base, she thought bitterly.

The Bargain
Sophia slowly stood, her arms crossed protectively in front of her chest. “Fine,” she said quietly, her voice trembling with both anger and resignation. “I’ll agree.”

Z’s gaze sharpened, his lips curling ever so slightly. “Good,” he said.

“But,” Sophia added quickly, “I have conditions.”

Z raised an eyebrow, his expression still calm but tinged with faint amusement. “Oh? And what might those be?”

“You give me enough serum to guarantee my safety, and when this is over, you let me go,” she said firmly, the words tumbling out in a rush.

Z tilted his head, his dark eyes narrowing slightly. Then, as if humoring her, he gave a small shrug. “Your demands are high. That’s two conditions, but fine. I can agree to them—on one condition of my own.”

He crouched, bringing his face level with hers. The intensity in his gaze made her want to flinch, but she held her ground.

“My condition is simple,” Z continued, his voice low and steady. “If you don’t want to go through with it, I won’t force you. But if you agree, you’ll do everything I say. Do you accept?”

Sophia hesitated, her heart pounding. Her instincts screamed at her to run, but there was nowhere to go. Refusing him would mean death—or worse.

Finally, she nodded, her throat dry.

“Good,” Z said, standing and turning toward the door. “Follow me.”

Sophia wrapped her arms around herself as she stood. She felt exposed, vulnerable, and utterly at his mercy. But Z didn’t glance back, walking ahead as though he had already won.

They entered a room hidden behind rows of advanced machinery. The space was stark and cold, dominated by a single narrow bed and a desk cluttered with scientific equipment.

“Lie down,” Z instructed, his tone as casual as ever.

Sophia’s hands tightened into fists. She had agreed, but the reality of the situation made her stomach churn. Still, she couldn’t back out now. Slowly, she stepped toward the bed, each step feeling heavier than the last.

“Wait,” she said, her voice shaky.

Z paused, turning his head slightly.

“I… I want your word,” Sophia said, her voice gaining strength despite the fear twisting her insides. “When this is over, you’ll let me go. No tricks.”

Z tilted his head, as though considering her demand. “I don’t make promises,” he said finally. “But I’ll honor our agreement—for now.”

It wasn’t perfect, but it was enough. Sophia took a deep breath and forced herself to step closer to the bed.

Sophia hesitated, standing rigidly by the narrow bed. Her fists clenched and unclenched at her sides as if her body were wrestling with itself. Every instinct told her to run, but her rational mind knew it was pointless.

Z remained calm, unbuttoning his shirt without a hint of urgency. His movements were precise, methodical, and oddly mesmerizing, as if even the act of disrobing was part of a calculated plan.

“Take your time,” he said smoothly, his gaze briefly flicking to her. “Rushing tends to ruin results.”

Sophia exhaled shakily, forcing herself to climb onto the bed. The cold metal frame creaked slightly under her weight, and the clinical sterility of the room made her feel even more out of place.

Z hung his shirt on a nearby rack, his lean, pale frame catching the faint light from overhead. Despite the situation, there was nothing overtly predatory about his demeanor. It was as though she were just another piece of equipment to be tested and analyzed.

“Comfortable?” he asked casually, his tone making it clear the question was rhetorical.

Sophia didn’t answer, her gaze fixed on the ceiling. Her heart pounded in her chest, and her palms felt clammy.

Z stepped closer, his shadow falling over her like a dark veil. “Last chance to change your mind,” he said, his voice quiet but firm.

“I won’t,” Sophia replied, her tone steadier than she expected.

He nodded, accepting her decision without further comment. Slowly, he reached toward her, his hands moving with the same clinical precision he displayed earlier.

A Shift in the Atmosphere
Sophia flinched slightly at the first contact, her body tense and rigid. But Z didn’t rush. His movements were slow and deliberate, his hands surprisingly cool against her skin.

“This is a waste of time,” she muttered under her breath, mostly to herself.

Z’s lips curved into a faint smirk. “Time is the only resource I can afford to waste.”

Despite his words, there was no malice in his touch. It was almost mechanical, as though he were cataloging her reactions for some unseen experiment.

The silence in the room was oppressive, broken only by the occasional sound of shifting fabric or faint creaks from the bed. For Sophia, every second felt like an eternity.

“You’re trembling,” Z remarked, his voice as calm as ever.

Sophia grit her teeth, forcing herself to meet his gaze. “What did you expect?”

His head tilted slightly, as if genuinely curious. “Not fear. You’re not the type to cower. So what is it?”

Sophia blinked, caught off guard by his observation. “I’m... human,” she muttered. “And this is... a lot.”

For the first time, Z paused. His sharp, calculating gaze softened ever so slightly, and he leaned back, studying her expression with an intensity that made her skin crawl.

“Fascinating,” he murmured, almost to himself.

The Unexpected Outcome
But just as the tension seemed poised to snap, a sharp, mechanical beep shattered the quiet. Z turned his head toward a monitor on the far wall, his brows knitting together in irritation.

“What now?” he muttered, stepping away from the bed.

Sophia’s body sagged in relief as the interruption gave her a reprieve. She sat up slightly, watching as Z strode to the monitor. His fingers flew across a keypad, and a series of holographic graphs and data streams lit up the screen.

His expression darkened. “Intruders.”

Sophia froze. “Intruders? Where?”

“Near the perimeter of this facility,” Z replied, his tone clipped. His attention was wholly on the screen, his earlier focus on her now completely gone. “Your father’s men, most likely.”

Sophia’s pulse quickened. “Are they looking for me?”

“Perhaps,” Z said, his voice distant. “Or perhaps they’ve grown tired of hiding behind their walls and decided to test their luck.”

He turned back to her, his expression unreadable. “Your presence complicates things.”

Sophia felt a spark of defiance rise within her. “You dragged me here!”

“And yet,” Z said smoothly, “your survival depends entirely on my choices.”

Before she could retort, he strode to the door. “Stay here,” he commanded, his tone leaving no room for argument. “Unless you’re eager to see just how effective your vial is against a bullet.”

The door closed behind him with a soft click, leaving Sophia alone in the sterile room.

A New Resolve
Sophia’s gaze drifted to the serum vial still clutched in her hand. Her thoughts raced. Z was distracted, and now might be her only chance to escape.

But where would I go?

Her mind flashed to Quantum Base, to her father, to the horde of zombies she’d narrowly escaped earlier. Her situation was dire, but she couldn’t afford to give up now.

Taking a deep breath, she swung her legs off the bed and stood. Her knees wobbled, but determination steadied her.

“If I can’t outsmart him,” she muttered, clutching the vial tighter, “I’ll have to outlast him.”
