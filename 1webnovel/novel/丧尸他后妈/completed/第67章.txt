Sophia Wang stared at the computer screen, her eyes glued to the flickering data streams. The images relayed from the trackers on the zombies were mesmerizing, pulling her into a trance-like state. The two sectors she had released were now complete, and the target numbers were steadily decreasing. Each step of the Z Plan was unfolding methodically before her.

She shifted her stiff neck and instinctively glanced over at Z, who was engrossed in calibrating the equipment in his hands. The collar of his white shirt was loosened, two buttons undone, and the slightly open fabric revealed his long, pale neck. In the dim light, his prominent Adam's apple was subtly highlighted, adding an unexpected allure to his otherwise focused demeanor.

For reasons she couldn't quite grasp, Sophia had recently felt an inexplicable dependency on him. Perhaps it was because she had begun to accept the significance of Z's presence in her life. A small smile crept onto her lips as she walked softly to his side, looking for a moment to speak without interrupting his concentration.

"What's up?" Z lifted his head before she could say anything, his slanted eyes locking onto hers, his voice low and calm.

"I'm a bit tired," she admitted, twisting her waist slightly with a hint of fatigue in the smile that accompanied her words. "I think I’ll take a nap."

Z glanced at the sectors on the screen, then replied coolly, "Go ahead. Rest well. If you feel like continuing afterward, you can come back to find me."

Sophia nodded, her tone light yet serious as she said, "I’ve done what you asked, so you’ll do what I ask in return, right?"

Z's lips quirked into a subtle smirk as he asked, "Are you doubting me?"

"…Don’t be so smug," she sighed, rolling her eyes before turning to leave.

Watching her slender figure retreat, Z fell silent for a moment, then ultimately stood up and followed her out.

Lying in bed, Sophia found the room enveloped in tranquility. The lights had been dimmed, and the small bedside lamp cast a gentle glow that wrapped around her like a warm embrace. She closed her eyes, imagining she could still hear Z's soft murmurs. A smile played at the corners of her mouth, and soon, she drifted off into a deep sleep.

Z stood at the door, watching her sleep peacefully. He let out a soft sigh, hesitantly pulling a light blanket over her. His gaze lingered on her serene features, the calmness of her sleeping face tugging at his heartstrings.

"How can someone be so hard to let go?" he murmured to himself before quietly exiting the room.

When Sophia awoke, the only light in the room came from the faint glow of the bedside lamp. She stretched her shoulders and lazily got up, making her way to the lab.

Pushing open the door, she found Z still hard at work. His posture was straight, his movements as precise and efficient as ever. The instruments on the lab table emitted a ghostly blue light, casting a stark contrast against his sharp silhouette.

"How long are you planning to stand at the door?" Z called without turning around, his voice laced with casual teasing.

"I thought you couldn't see me," she replied, a hint of embarrassment creeping into her tone as she walked over and sat down at the computer. "Go back to your work."

"If your laziness causes delays, I won’t hesitate to reduce your requirements," he said nonchalantly, his sharp tongue teasing as always.

"Like what?" she raised an eyebrow, curious.

"There are no details. Just imagine something truly terrifying," he replied, his gaze fixated on the tasks at hand, the lenses of his glasses glimmering faintly.

Sophia sighed as she looked at the screen, "Will these zombies eventually be able to receive the vaccine?"

Z continued working without looking up, "That depends on your performance."

"…Great," she thought, rolling her eyes internally. This man’s one guarantee in life was that you should never trust him.

Three days later, Sophia finally completed her tasks, while Z seemed to be at a standstill. He leaned against the lab table, propping his chin in thought, a pensive look on his face.

"Stuck on finding a solution?" she asked as she approached from behind.

Z glanced back at her, his tone flat, "I can think of something, but I don’t feel like sharing."

"How unreasonable," she shook her head, turning to leave.

"Stop," his voice called out behind her.

Sophia halted and turned back, "What now?"

"Don't walk away," Z slowly stood up, his voice low but carrying an undeniable weight that made it hard to refuse.

Her heart fluttered slightly, a smile creeping onto her face. "What if I don’t want to leave?"

"Then you’ll need to give me a reason to stay," he said, taking a step closer, a complex emotion flickering in his eyes.

"A reason?" she narrowed her eyes, a teasing lilt to her voice. "Just because... you need me."

Z paused, a barely perceptible smile twitching at the corner of his lips. "Fine, you win."
