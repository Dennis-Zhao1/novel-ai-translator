Chapter 8: A Tangled Escape
Sophia Wang ran as if her life depended on it, her breath coming in short bursts. The heels of her newly gifted shoes sank slightly into the uneven ground, but she didn’t dare stop. Her goal was simple—put as much distance as possible between her and Z.

Turning corners at random to confuse any potential pursuit, she finally found herself in a small grove dotted with wildflowers. The soft light from Quantum Base’s distant lighthouse flickered on the horizon.

Am I out? she wondered, her chest heaving. Did I really escape?

Her relief felt tenuous, as if the world might crumble around her at any moment. Shaking her head, she pulled out the vial Z had given her. Carefully, she uncapped it and dabbed a small amount of the liquid behind her ears and on her shoulders. The cool sensation of the serum brought a strange comfort.

Clutching the vial tightly in her hand, she took a moment to gather herself.

Then she heard it: footsteps.

A Sudden Reunion
The sound grew louder, and Sophia ducked instinctively behind a tree. Turning her head, she found herself face-to-face with someone unexpected—a stunningly beautiful woman with long, flowing black curls and a face so delicate it looked sculpted. Her hourglass figure and confident posture radiated an air of effortless sensuality.

“Sophia! I finally found you!” the woman exclaimed, her voice bright with relief. She clasped Sophia’s hands tightly, her touch as soft as her appearance. “She’s here!” she called out over her shoulder. “Everyone, over here!”

Before Sophia could react, a group of familiar faces came rushing toward her. At the forefront was none other than Ouyang.

He frowned the moment his eyes landed on Sophia, his sharp gaze narrowing with disapproval. “What the hell are you wearing?” he snapped, striding over and yanking her away from the other woman. “Where are your clothes? And what’s in your hand?”

Sophia tightened her grip on the vial, her heart pounding. Over my dead body, she thought.

“Get lost!” she snarled, her knee shooting up to shove him away with a well-aimed kick. Ouyang stumbled back, caught off guard.

The Intruder’s Plea
“Stop it, both of you!” the woman cried, rushing to Ouyang’s side. She knelt beside him, her face a perfect mask of concern. “Ouyang, are you okay?”

Turning to Sophia, the woman’s eyes brimmed with unshed tears. “Sophia, this is my fault. I shouldn’t have interfered. Please don’t take your anger out on him—it’s all my doing!” Her voice trembled, every word dripping with guilt.

She stood, her delicate frame quivering as she looked back at Ouyang with an air of tragic resolve. “I’ve already decided,” she announced, her voice filled with quiet determination. “I’ll leave Quantum Base. I’ll go far away, and I’ll never return. I’ll give Ouyang back to you.”

Sophia stared at her, blinking. The pieces clicked into place. This can only be Yining.

“Stop!” Sophia blurted, holding up her hands. “You can’t leave!” She forced a smile, her voice desperate with feigned sincerity. “This isn’t your fault, it’s mine. I’m stubborn, okay? Don’t let my stupidity ruin everything!”

Yining’s tear-filled eyes widened slightly as she studied Sophia’s face. Her expression flickered briefly, but she quickly recovered, nodding with saintly grace.

“I’ve already made up my mind,” Yining said. “I’ve told the governor I’ll leave once I find you. My decision won’t change.” With that, she turned and began walking away.

The Chase
Ouyang hesitated, his fists clenching and unclenching as he watched her retreating figure. He took a half-step forward but froze, visibly torn.

Sophia scowled and gave him a shove. “What are you waiting for? Go after her! She’s out here alone, and this area isn’t safe. What if zombies show up?”

Ouyang looked at her, confused. “Why are you—”

“Just go!” she snapped, throwing her arms up in frustration. I know this is all part of your plan, she thought grimly. But if you don’t go now, Yining might actually run into real danger.

When he still didn’t move, Sophia gritted her teeth and bolted after Yining herself.

“Where are you going?!” Ouyang’s voice rang out behind her, full of disbelief.

A Looming Threat
Yining had covered a surprising amount of ground. Sophia was panting as she tried to catch up, all the while muttering to herself. “This woman is supposed to be the heroine, not an Olympic sprinter…”

She was about to call out when she noticed something strange. Ahead of Yining stood a tall, shadowy figure, partially obscured by a doorway. Sophia’s blood ran cold as the figure shifted, the faint glint of a syringe catching the light.

Z.

The realization hit her like a thunderclap. Her stomach twisted as she watched the scene unfold.

Z stepped forward, his movements precise and unhurried. He raised the syringe and, without a word, plunged it into Yining’s neck.

Yining gasped, her eyes wide with shock as the liquid entered her veins. She stumbled, her legs giving out beneath her as Z turned and walked away, his back straight and unbothered.

Sophia skidded to a halt, her heart pounding in her ears. Yining lay motionless on the ground, her limbs splayed awkwardly.

“What…” Sophia’s voice faltered as she staggered backward, nearly colliding with Ouyang, who had just caught up.

A Stark Reminder
Ouyang’s horrified gaze flicked between Yining and the direction Z had disappeared. “What happened?” he demanded.

Sophia shook her head, still trying to process what she’d just witnessed. Her thoughts raced. Why? Why would Z target her?

The faint glint of the syringe in Z’s hand lingered in her mind. What was in that injection?

Ouyang dropped to his knees beside Yining, shaking her shoulders in a panic. “Yining! Yining, wake up!”

Sophia remained frozen, her chest tight with a mix of fear and frustration. Deep down, she couldn’t suppress a bitter thought: Whoever this “Good Samaritan” is, they just took the heroine off the board.

For once, she didn’t feel bad about being a bystander.
