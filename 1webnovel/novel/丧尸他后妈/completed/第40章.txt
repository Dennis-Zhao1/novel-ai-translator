“I’m not praising anyone,” Z quickly denied as the car came to a halt. They had arrived at the area for today’s inspection.

Xiao Cha got out first and walked around, seemingly intending to open the door for Z, but by the time he approached, Z had already vanished from sight.

“Hmm?” Xiao Cha froze for a moment, and beside him, Xiao Ya Ya tugged at his sleeve, pointing toward the wall. Xiao Cha glanced over, his eyes curving into a smile as he ruffled her hair. “You’ve got a keen eye, Ya Ya.”

Xiao Ya Ya spoke earnestly, “Second Brother, I’m not trying to criticize, but if you’re nearsighted, you should get glasses. Not wearing them won’t make your eyes any bigger.”

A hint of embarrassment flickered across Xiao Cha’s handsome face. He took her hand and led her toward Z, whispering, “But I just feel like I look silly in glasses.”

“You don’t look silly,” Xiao Ya Ya said, glancing at him before peering into the distance where Z stood. She composed herself and added, “Although you don’t look as good in glasses as he does, you still look fine.”

Xiao Cha followed her gaze and saw Z standing in front of a large gate, blocked by soldiers in protective gear and masks, all looking at him with questioning expressions.

Xiao Cha nodded slightly, giving the soldiers an affirmative answer. They quickly removed the obstruction and opened the gate.

Z didn’t even glance at them, skipping the small talk and walking straight out. His tall figure stood out even among the strongest soldiers, but he was unnaturally thin, which made him seem less reassuring and somewhat unreliable.

However, Xiao Cha quickly discarded this superficial judgment. Z’s demeanor and actions revealed a level of professionalism that was undeniable. Although this area wasn’t a disaster zone, it still posed significant dangers, albeit somewhat mitigated.

Once inside the inspection zone, Z moved independently, his long legs striding purposefully through the corridors. He seemed entirely unconcerned about the soldiers trailing behind him or the possibility of zombies suddenly attacking him. For a moment, it seemed he was intentionally trying to shake off the soldiers, which was beginning to irritate them.

“Deputy Governor, this Dr. Zhang is too arrogant. Doesn’t he worry we might actually leave him behind? Is he here to help us or to hinder us?” growled a tall man with a scruffy beard.

Xiao Cha raised an eyebrow, watching Z suddenly stop in front of an abandoned factory. Z tilted his head to gaze at it, and from a distance, the lens of his rimless glasses glinted with a flash of white light.

Just then, the old, rusted iron door of the factory swung open with a crash. A horde of zombies staggered out from the dimness, their faces bloodied and their skin hanging loose, emitting a nauseating stench that made Xiao Cha and the others feel queasy merely by getting closer. Yet, Z stood there, seemingly unbothered by the proximity to the gruesome sight.

“Good boy,” Z adjusted his glasses, stepping back to lean against the wall. Rain pattered down on his black umbrella, trickling down the ribs like a slow clock ticking away.

This was indeed a form of timing. In his mind, Z counted to twenty, and after that, a familiar figure emerged behind the horde—a woman… a beautiful woman.

“Miss Yi?!” Xiao Cha gasped, staring at Yi Ning, who stood behind the zombies. Her eyes glowed with an eerie green light, and she stood there in the rain, wielding a slender sword in one hand and a gun in the other, her expression devoid of emotion as she prepared to attack the oncoming zombies.

“What a persistent ghost,” Xiao Ya Ya, who had been scared and hiding behind Xiao Cha, peeked out upon hearing Yi Ning’s name. Seeing it was indeed her, she couldn’t help but express her astonishment.

Though Xiao Cha wasn't fond of Yi Ning, her sudden appearance here, attacking zombies, felt bizarre. He was aware of the zombies' existence, but his purpose today was merely to gauge Z’s capabilities and see if he could be of use to them.

Yi Ning’s unexpected appearance completely derailed his plans, and he was puzzled about how she had discovered this secret.

Indeed, when one needed to be tough, one had to be tough; it seemed he hadn’t fully internalized his father’s teachings.

Xiao Cha handed Xiao Ya Ya over to the soldiers behind them and drew the gun from his holster, tossing aside his umbrella as he rushed forward to Z’s side. “Dr. Zhang, you should return to the main group. I’ll handle this…”

Before he could finish, Z shot him a look that silenced him. It seemed no one liked to be bossed around while working. Z took three steps forward, increasing the distance between them, raising his gun and squinting at Yi Ning in the distance. “Her sudden appearance is suspicious, and her behavior is odd. She must have been infected with a special virus. It’s better to eliminate her first.”

Xiao Cha was momentarily taken aback by this statement but quickly regained his composure, rushing to stop him. “Is that really a good idea? After all, Miss Yi is a guest, and Mr. Gongji is responsible for her safety. If she dies…”

“Shut up,” Z turned coldly to glare at Xiao Cha. Since Wang Xiaoshu had left his side, his demeanor had shifted dramatically—less warmth and humanity, more coldness and disdain. His dark eyes glimmered with a hint of madness, as if daring Xiao Cha to challenge him.

Xiao Cha frowned slightly, tightening his grip on the gun, visibly hesitating.

Z didn’t regard him as a threat at all. With one hand, he pulled the trigger and fired, the bullet slicing through the rain towards Yi Ning, piercing through four zombies along the way before hitting her left atrium.

Yi Ning’s body froze suddenly, her expression blanking out for a few seconds, her weapon falling from her hand as she collapsed backward.

Xiao Cha watched in shock and immediately dashed forward. Although his speed couldn’t match Z’s, he was still impressively quick for an ordinary person. Even Z had to acknowledge his precise marksmanship and rapid firing. Clearing the zombies in front of him with a few well-placed shots, he agilely grabbed Yi Ning, whose features were becoming indistinct in the mud, and struggled back through the downpour.

The soldiers from the atomic base quickly drew their weapons and began to assist, but Z coldly observed the individuals who were ruining his plans, feeling a surge of irritation. He raised his gun slightly, aiming at Xiao Cha. From this angle, he could shoot through Xiao Cha’s heart and also finish Yi Ning off.

Though the bullets were specially designed, the rain and the fact he’d already taken down four zombies made Z uncertain whether Yi Ning would even survive. He hesitated for about three seconds with his finger on the trigger before decisively pulling it again.

“Bang—”

Another gunshot rang out, and the bluish bullet sped through the air. Xiao Ya Ya, watching from a secure distance, caught sight of it, and in a moment of panic, she rushed into the horde of zombies, shouting “Second Brother, watch out!” She lunged toward Xiao Cha, successfully diverting the bullet, but…

The bullet struck her instead.

Xiao Cha stood frozen, staring at Xiao Ya Ya, who collapsed onto him, warm blood streaming down between his brows. His usually gentle features twisted into a mask of horror. He glanced at Yi Ning, still breathing in his arms, then at his sister, who had thrown herself in harm’s way for him. For the first time, he truly felt the weight of regret.

“Ya Ya…” he croaked, grasping her tightly, his eyes growing red as he looked down at her. Rain washed the blood from his face, mingling with the warm scent of her blood. His eyes overflowed with warm liquid, indistinguishable between rain and tears.

The soldiers from the atomic base had cleared the zombies, surrounding Xiao Cha as they vigilantly scanned their surroundings for further threats. Xiao Cha remained rooted in place, clutching Xiao Ya Ya, while Yi Ning lay abandoned on the ground, the scene heavy with despair.

Z, the cause of it all, felt no remorse. He stood there, his mind racing as he mentally listed the series of issues he would need to address next, devising dozens of potential solutions. His narrow eyes were dark and inscrutable, revealing nothing of his thoughts.

At that moment, an unexpected figure broke the stillness, disrupting what felt like a frozen moment in time.

“What happened?” Wang Xiaoshu hurried over with her gun in hand. She took in the bloodied Xiao Ya Ya and Xiao Cha, then glanced at the seemingly dazed soldiers and urged, “What are you all standing around for? Hurry up and take her back to the base!”

Xiao Cha snapped back to reality, his gaze toward Wang Xiaoshu filled with complexity. His thoughts had just been tumultuous, leaving him feeling strange and vulnerable.

Wang Xiaoshu nodded at him, suppressing her discomfort, before turning to Z. Xiao Cha regained his composure and cast a glance at Z, his mind clouded with suspicion, though he decided not to voice it immediately. After all, one needed evidence before making accusations—he would wait until the bullet was extracted to gather proof.

Z appeared unfazed. In fact, he had already severed all potential ties that could link him to the incident, especially regarding the bullets.

Those were his specially crafted guns and bullets. Upon contact with human flesh, the bullets dissolved like medication, ensuring that by the time Xiao Cha returned to extract the bullet from Xiao Ya Ya, it would vanish without a trace, leaving behind only severe aftereffects.

Thus, even if Yi Ning survived, her wakefulness wouldn’t be much better than death.

It was a pity for Xiao Ya Ya, but there was nothing to be done; she had recklessly rushed into danger, after all.

“Are you alright?” Wang Xiaoshu asked, shielding her eyes from the rain, frowning as she looked at Z, who was drenched. “Why aren’t you using your umbrella?”

Z slowly raised the neglected umbrella above her head, coolly returning the question, “Aren’t you without one as well?” He grasped her wrist and, alongside the atomic personnel, headed back to the base. He quietly murmured, “Did you see that muddy figure being carried? That’s Miss Hormone. Even if she doesn’t die this time, she won’t pose any threat to you anymore.” He smirked, his white, neat teeth glinting coldly.

Wang Xiaoshu couldn’t help but shiver, casting a glance at the figure that was unrecognizable, she asked in a hushed tone, “Then how did Xiao Ya Ya get hurt?”

“Her own doing,” Z replied, his expression unyielding. “Someone ambushed Xiao Cha, and she jumped in front of the bullet. Truly foolish.”

Wang Xiaoshu paused, feeling a surge of admiration for the fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl. “She’s not foolish; she’s kind.”

“I don’t want that kind of kindness leading to a loss of life to be present in you,” Z replied coldly, devoid of any humor.

Wang Xiaoshu regarded his emotionless face, falling into silence for a moment before saying, “If it were you and me in that situation, I would have done the same for you.”

“…” Z abruptly stopped, looking down at her, his lips pressed together. He replied flatly, “Your hypothetical doesn’t hold because I would never let such a situation arise.”

Wang Xiaoshu stepped forward, smiling as she said, “No one can predict exactly what will happen tomorrow. You surely didn’t anticipate doing a good deed today, right? Don’t speak in absolutes; just do your best and don’t leave regrets behind.”

As they conversed, they had already returned to the atomic base. The news of Xiao Ya Ya’s injury reached Xiao Cong’s ears, and without hesitation, he dashed to the base, coincidentally encountering Xiao Cha and the others.

Without a word, Xiao Cong snatched Xiao Ya Ya from Xiao Cha’s arms and rushed toward the medical center, leaving Xiao Cha standing there, guilt-ridden, his head bowed. His damp bangs obscured his eyes, and he appeared utterly despondent.

Gongji Yusuke was captivated by the muddy figure brought in by the soldier. He looked up in confusion, as if asking, “What the hell… who is this?”

Z and Wang Xiaoshu witnessed the entire scene unfold. Wang Xiaoshu felt a tangle of emotions, a vague sense that something was amiss, but she couldn’t pinpoint what. Her instinct seemed to be conveying something, but she resisted it.

Once everyone had left, Z and Wang Xiaoshu made their way toward their quarters. Neither had sustained injuries, so they didn’t need to visit the medical center—just a bath and a change of clothes would suffice.

Walking side by side in silence, Z’s quietness came to an end as he entered the bathroom.

“I don’t believe in doing things halfway,” he remarked. “When I need to do my best, it means I’ve already made an irreparable mistake. Let’s hope I don’t reach that point.”

Many of Z’s words sounded like riddles to Wang Xiaoshu. If she wanted to understand, she’d have to guess and ponder. This moment was no different. Regardless of whether she comprehended his meaning, she recognized that her mindset had shifted.

Humans truly are selfish. When they dislike someone, their good deeds appear to be bad, and when they like them, even their misdeeds seem forgivable.

People are always quick to judge others while excusing themselves, trapped in this vicious cycle.

Z stepped into the bathroom first. Wang Xiaoshu wouldn’t initiate a shared bath with him, so she remained outside, patiently waiting.

Z peeked through the crack of the bathroom door, watching her delicate silhouette for a couple of seconds before shutting the door.

It’s alright, he thought; there’s plenty of time for him to waste on her.
