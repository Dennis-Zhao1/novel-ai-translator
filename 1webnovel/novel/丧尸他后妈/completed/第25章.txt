His lips brushed against hers, and both of their temperatures felt oddly elevated. His arm was draped over her slender waist, and their breaths grew heavier. He forced himself to pull away, creating some distance between them, and silently handed her the vial of medication. 

"Drink up. After you're done, let's see if there are any adverse reactions," he said, feigning calmness.

Sophia Wang glanced meaningfully toward his lower abdomen. In response, he pulled his white lab coat tighter, turning his back to her and sitting rigidly, staring straight ahead. "Hurry up; it's getting late."

"Okay," she nodded, trying to focus. Removing the stopper from the test tube, she held her breath and downed the liquid in one gulp. It felt like a refreshing minty fluid sliding down her throat, and she sensed that coolness spreading from the inside out. About twenty seconds passed when suddenly, her left atrium seized painfully. She gasped, cold sweat beading on her forehead as she leaned back in the car seat, breathing rapidly.

Z furrowed his brow, watching her reaction. He took out a pair of glasses from his briefcase and put them on, gently gripping her chin to make her open her mouth. He pulled her into his embrace to examine her condition. As he did, the pain seemed to ebb away, replaced by a numbing sensation and the chill spreading through her limbs.

Z held her hand tightly, wrapping her in his warmth as he exhaled softly. "This is normal; don’t worry. So far, there haven't been any adverse reactions."

“Okay…” Sophia murmured weakly, a pained frown on her face.

Z felt restless but maintained an air of calm, explaining how to control her newfound powers. "This high-voltage energy is something you can control, just like your body's instincts. You need to direct it as you would control your arms and legs, guiding it to serve you."

Sophia nodded drowsily, her rationality slipping away. But another sharp spasm in her heart brought her back to consciousness. She screamed, a sound that left Yusuke Miyazaki, who was on watch outside, and Yi Ning and Ouyang, who had been locked in a mental battle, dumbfounded.

…What’s going on? What are those two doing in the car? Surely they’re not…

Just as they entertained that thought, they heard Z let out a low groan, which led them to automatically fill in the blanks in their minds, confirming their exaggerated assumptions. 

So, what was the reality? 

The reality was that Sophia was being tormented by heart pain, shaking Z's lab coat desperately. He was getting annoyed by her actions, and reluctantly said, “Why don’t you just bite my arm instead.” He brought his arm to her mouth, but she hesitated, unable to bring herself to do it. Z, seeing her tearful yet restrained expression, felt a mix of regret and pain. With a determined resolve, he pried her mouth open and thrust his wrist inside.

Although Sophia felt pain, she remained aware. Unable to bear biting down, she merely held on gently, her grip light. Z sighed in exasperation. “What good is this? When did your strength get so weak? Use all your might!”

Sophia looked at him pitifully, her heart shattered into pieces. She pushed his wrist away and dove into his embrace, biting down on the protruding area of his chest through his shirt…

And so, that was the origin of Z's subsequent groan—a classic case of… self-inflicted suffering X2.

“You really are trying your hardest, aren’t you…” Z couldn’t help but chuckle as he held the exhausted Sophia in his arms. Her forehead was slick with sweat, and her dark, fluffy hair clung to her fair neck, giving her a soft and adorable appearance.

“Z…” she whispered, her voice almost inaudible, “Is it over now?” she asked slowly.

Z sighed in relief. “Yes, it’s over. Just get a good night’s sleep, and when you wake up, you’ll be completely different.”

Sophia nodded slightly, hesitating before saying, “But…”

“What is it?” Z leaned closer, his earlobe brushing against her lips, making it easier for her to be heard.

Inhaling his unique scent brought her a sense of security. She knew this man genuinely cared for her, and it made her happy. Deep inside, she understood this feeling, but his silence left her feeling awkward. Surely, she couldn’t just take the initiative? Ah, forget it, that’s for later. What mattered most right now was…

“I’m so hungry…” Sophia said, sulking.

Z froze for a moment, straightening up. “You can’t eat compressed food right now; that’s unhealthy. You need fresh hot food… just wait a moment.” He intended to place her back in the seat and go find something for her, but Sophia stopped him.

He looked at her in confusion. She glanced out the car window, let out a long sigh, and said, “Never mind, even though I’m starving, it’s dark and cold outside.”

Z stared at her in surprise. Was she… concerned for him? He looked at her with a complex expression, not opposing her decision to stay. First, he didn’t want to leave her alone, and second… he found it hard to part with this moment. The atmosphere between them had never been this good, and it was truly difficult to let go.

And so, Z spent the night sitting upright, holding the gradually fading Sophia in his arms. When morning came, he didn’t feel any soreness. Excited, he urged Sophia to experience her powers. As soon as they stepped out of the car, they encountered the strangely pale faces of Yi Ning and the others. He ignored them completely, oblivious to the odd looks they were giving him and Sophia.

Sophia, however, was a little concerned and walked a bit slower. Although she was curious, she didn’t suggest they sort things out first before experimenting, which delighted Z. Her behavior was simply too good, so he decided to reward her.

“Do you want to know?” he asked her, not waiting for a reply. “Just wait here; I’ll go ask.” He released her hand and crossed over to Yusuke Miyazaki, casually exchanging a few words and leading him to a secluded spot where they could speak privately.

“Everyone seems to have something on their minds today,” Z said, probing indirectly.

Yusuke understood his words perfectly. Though he felt a bit uneasy, he still replied kindly, “Miss Wang is a good girl; you’re lucky, Professor. You two make a great match.” He even gave a thumbs up.

Those words were music to Z's ears, and he felt elated. Yet, he maintained his usual aloof demeanor, "Sophia Wang and I are a great match? Not a chance. She’s so clumsy and isn’t even that pretty."

Yusuke blinked in surprise, disagreeing, “No way! Miss Wang has very pretty eyes.”

Right? Right? Those deep, shiny eyes are charming, right? Z kept a cool expression, but unexpectedly, Yusuke added another comment, likely worried that Z would take offense to the previous compliment and then look poorly upon the whole situation. “But she can be a bit clumsy,” he added seriously.

Z's fists clenched instantly as he glared at Yusuke. “What do you mean by ‘a bit clumsy’? Where is she clumsy? Tell me so I can explain!”

Yusuke looked at him bewildered, completely thrown off by Z's unpredictable behavior. After all these years, he had never encountered someone so elusive. Truly, Z was deserving of admiration for being able to neutralize that mad scientist's bomb poison! Yusuke’s respect for Z deepened. If someone like him was with Miss Wang, it could only be a good thing!
