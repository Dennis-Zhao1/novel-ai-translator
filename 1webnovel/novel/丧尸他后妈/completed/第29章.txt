This was destined to be a sleepless night. Perhaps it was because Sophia Wang had taken the initiative and cooperated for the first time, but Z seemed to be asking for too much.

By the time he finally let her go, the first light of dawn was beginning to creep across the horizon, and her throat had grown slightly hoarse from the night’s events. Exhausted, Sophia leaned against him, allowing him to help her clean up and put on her clothes. He whispered in her ear, “Let’s go downstairs; I’ll help you get organized.”

Sophia gazed at him in confusion. “Where to?” She looked utterly drained.

Z scooped her up and carried her into the dimly lit little building, his strides purposeful as he ascended the narrow wooden stairs to the second floor. Next to a very old wardrobe, he shifted a wooden sculpture resembling a table lamp, and suddenly, a row of buttons and a fingerprint scanner popped out from the center. After quickly pressing a few buttons, Z placed his right index finger on the fingerprint scanner. A beep echoed, and the seemingly solid wall before them began to change.

Sophia stared in awe as the wall gradually disappeared, revealing a sloped tunnel leading underground, almost identical to the one she had seen near Z's laboratory.

Unpleasant memories surged in her mind, causing her body to stiffen. Noticing her discomfort, Z glanced at her and soothingly said, “Everyone here has already left.”

He said just that, leaving things vague, not clarifying whether those who left were other test subjects of his class, researchers, or those injected with H+. 

Sophia released a sigh of relief, trying to clear her mind of the past events that were now set in stone, more resolute than ever to encourage Z to do more good to atone for his past wrongs. At the very least, it would provide her with a bit of solace for her conscience. Of course, if he could create a potion to restore those zombies to normal, she would be even happier.

Z carried Sophia into the underground laboratory. After passing through several secure glass doors, they stopped in a room filled with high-tech equipment and sealed containers. 

Sophia slipped from Z's embrace and took in the size of the room, her gaze finally landing on Z with a look of confusion.

Z adjusted his glasses and said, “This was my old room.” He pointed at the sealed glass containers. “Those were the places where the 26 test subjects lived.”

Sophia glanced at the cage-like structures, her understanding dawning on her about the design that had been used to imprison the mutated zombies. It seemed that villains and dangerous individuals were all treated the same way, confined in such containers. Moreover, these instruments and vessels appeared impervious to aging and damage; even after more than twenty years, the laboratory still seemed brand new.

“The sun is almost up,” Sophia said, attempting to change the subject.

Z complied, pointing toward a door. “The bathroom is that way. I’ll find you some clothes and prepare a few things. You should take a shower first.” He turned and left, his tall figure quickly disappearing down the corridor.

Sophia rubbed her arms, feeling a strange discomfort wash over her as soon as he was gone. A sense of foreboding lingered in the air, but she took a soothing hot shower. She was incredibly curious about how this place managed to remain in such pristine condition amidst the apocalypse, but the thought of the owner of this place extinguished her curiosity entirely.

Just as she finished showering, Z returned, looking freshly washed as well. His hair was still damp, and he wore a pristine white lab coat over a fitted white protective suit. The suit looked like a typical shirt and trousers, just a bit more tailored. A holster at his waist hinted at a silver, finely modified handgun, and black combat boots accentuated his tall, commanding presence.

“Change your clothes, and we’ll leave,” Z said, handing Sophia a set of clothes identical to his, though much smaller and designed to fit a woman’s figure.

Sophia nodded, gratefully receiving the clothing and walking into the bathroom to change. She emerged with her shoulder-length black hair partially dry and dressed.

Z raised an eyebrow at her appearance, a flicker of thought crossing his eyes before he led her to another room, opening a cabinet to reveal a selection of shoes for her to choose from.

Sophia gazed at the array of matching uniforms, her eyes widening slightly as she quickly found her size. Clad in her new outfit, she followed the silent Z back to the surface.

Once outside, she immediately felt the air around her grow noticeably stale. Sophia paused momentarily to breathe, taking about ten seconds before she could finally relax.

“The sun’s up,” Z said, his tone regretful as he looked out the window at the brightening sky. He mumbled something under his breath, but Sophia couldn’t quite catch it. It seemed he didn’t wish for her to know what he had said, nor did he elaborate as he guided her outside.

Sophia intended to catch up with him and ask what he had muttered, but just as they stepped out of the small building, they were met with an unexpected sight in the quiet courtyard that should have been empty.

A girl, dressed in a white linen dress with waist-length black hair, was swinging back and forth on the swing set.

Upon hearing their footsteps, she turned her head, revealing a cold and icy expression on her youthful face as she glared at Sophia and Z.

If it hadn’t been dawn, Sophia might have thought she was seeing a ghost. Yet, whether it was due to Z’s presence or her newfound abilities, she felt more grounded than before. She realized she wasn’t as timid as she used to be; rather than retreating in fear, she stood her ground against the eerily dressed girl.

“You two finally decided to come out,” the girl said, her tone laced with meaning. “I thought you’d just stay inside and repeat what you did here earlier.”

“…” Sophia stared incredulously at the girl. “Did you see that?”

The girl snorted dismissively. “I’ve been here the whole time. It’s hard not to see.”

Sophia immediately turned to Z, her gaze filled with blame and regret, making him quickly understand that she likely wouldn’t be as forward as she had been the previous night. “You didn’t notice such a big person around?” she asked doubtfully.

Z opened his mouth, his gaze drifting elsewhere as he lied through his teeth, “I didn’t notice.”

Sophia didn’t even need to roll her eyes at him; the little girl did it for her, expressing disdain. “Stop pretending. You’ve known I was here since you walked in. You just didn’t want your plans to be interrupted, so you kept quiet.” She seemed quite reflective, “You looked my way at least ten times while with her, clearly debating whether or not to drag me out.”

… A live broadcast, Sophia thought, rolling her eyes skyward. It seemed that negative energy truly turned people into oblivious fools.

Z was never one to put himself at a disadvantage, and this moment was no exception, especially not in front of Sophia. 

The reason he had remained silent was to avoid complications. Now that the girl had appeared, Sophia would undoubtedly want to know what was going on. Rather than explaining himself directly, he preferred to let the girl speak, thus sidestepping any suspicions or doubts she might have had.

Seeing that part of his plan had concluded, Z took out his glasses and wiped them before putting them on. He scanned the girl from head to toe, and a flash of light flickered on his lenses—her identity had been confirmed.

Z's glasses weren’t just for correcting his vision; they were specially modified to function like a mini-computer, scanning everyone and everything he saw, locking onto and extracting relevant information from a vast database. That was why he could recognize people like Sophia and Ouyang at a glance, despite never having met them before.

At this moment, the imperfect scan caused by the nighttime's poor lighting had successfully completed. Z smirked before turning his attention back to Sophia. “I mentioned the governor of Atomic State, Xiao Cong, before. Do you remember?”

Sophia was puzzled by his sudden mention of this, but she nodded in acknowledgment.

Upon hearing Xiao Cong's name, the little girl's face immediately stiffened. The smugness and pretentiousness vanished, replaced by a grim expression as she glared at Z, whispering, “Do you know him?”

“No,” Z replied curtly.

“Another one pretending,” the girl seemed to relax a bit but still maintained her bravado.

Z smiled, “You’re mistaken. I don’t just know Xiao Cong; I know everyone.”

The girl gazed at Z, his tall, elegant figure illuminated by the soft morning light, surrounded by a faint mist that almost made him appear ethereal. When he smiled, the upward curve of his eyes and the way his lips turned up made him look charming, stirring feelings within the young girl at the cusp of adolescence.

However, she wasn’t an ordinary girl; even in the face of such charisma, she clung to her last defense. “You’re lying,” she challenged, unsure if she was trying to convince herself or question Z.

Z appeared unbothered, yet there were very few times when he was genuinely flustered. “Xiao Yaya, fifteen years old, is the biological sister of Governor Xiao Cong,” he explained to Sophia. “Xiao Cong cares deeply for her; she has almost round-the-clock protection. It’s a miracle she managed to escape.” He said this with a tone of admiration.

Sophia’s understanding clicked into place. “That makes sense.”

If one were to ask who Xiao Cong cared about most, aside from his responsibilities, it would undoubtedly be his little sister. 

In modern terms, Xiao Cong was the epitome of a protective older brother. He had another sister, but their bond wasn’t as close, whereas with Xiao Yaya, they had grown up together, relying on each other, creating an unusually deep bond.

In the original plot, it was only after Yi Ning had taken a liking to Xiao Yaya that Xiao Cong became more fond of him. Meanwhile, Wang Baozi was a mere bystander, enduring Xiao Yaya’s bullying without retaliation, maintaining the decorum expected of a governor’s daughter. It was no surprise that Xiao Cong would favor her.

Realizing who had appeared, Sophia sighed. It seemed she couldn’t escape the web of narrative characters; she would have to let things unfold naturally.

“You!” Xiao Yaya was evidently agitated by Z’s remarks. She leaped off the swing, as if about to confront them directly, but halted a meter in front of them, fists clenched and hesitating, clearly torn about whether to advance.

Just then, the group that had been waiting for Sophia and Z to return found them. The first to enter was Gong Qiqi, who immediately spotted Xiao Yaya. Following her gaze, he saw Sophia, then Z, and finally appeared confused, bowing respectfully. “Sorry to intrude.” He turned to leave.

Ouyang blocked his path, frowning impatiently. “Where do you think you’re going?”

Gong Qiqi replied earnestly, “It’s wrong to interrupt others’ private matters. We should give them space.”

Ouyang merely scoffed, disregarding his words as he strutted into the courtyard, boldly surveying the small building and the tense standoff between the three.

Yining followed closely behind Ouyang, his gaze on Xiao Yaya, hands clasped behind his back, clearly plotting something that wasn’t good.

Sophia looked at Z, who took a bold step forward. Startled, Xiao Yaya darted toward the exit, colliding awkwardly with Gong Qiqi, who had been standing at the doorway.
