Chapter 3: A Dangerous Encounter

“Where do you think you’re going?”

Ouyang’s sharp voice sliced through the tense air as Sophia tried to slip away. He was glaring at her, brows furrowed deeper than ever. Before she could respond, he strode over, grabbed her collar, and yanked her back into place.

“Stay with the team!” he barked, his tone brimming with authority. “Do you think you can just run off because you’re the governor’s daughter? If something happens, who’s responsible?!”

Sophia blinked at him, startled not by his words but by the sheer melodrama of his delivery. His righteous indignation and piercing glare made it seem like she’d committed some grave crime.

Man, the original Sophia really put up with this? she thought, shaking her head inwardly. “I just needed to... take a quick break,” she replied calmly, brushing his hand off her collar. “If you’re in a hurry, go on ahead. I’ll catch up later. This was my choice to come, so if anything happens, I’ll take full responsibility.”

Ouyang froze, clearly caught off guard by her cool indifference. His usual expectation of subservience wasn’t working anymore. The nearby team members exchanged glances, unsure of how to react to this sudden shift in their dynamics.

“Fine,” Ouyang spat, irritated by the eyes on him. “Let’s go!” He stomped away, his frustration evident in every step.

The others hesitated before following, leaving Sophia alone by the abandoned car. Once the area was clear, she darted toward the decrepit factory she’d been aiming for all along.

The factory was even more ominous than she remembered from the book. The air grew colder and stank of decay the farther she ventured inside. Shadows pooled in every corner, and the silence was suffocating.

Sophia slowed her steps, her instincts screaming at her to turn back. This is bad, she thought. The book didn’t describe it like this.

But it was too late.

Through the factory entrance, she spotted a lumbering figure—its twisted posture and disjointed movements unmistakable. A zombie.

Her heart raced. She ducked behind a rusted oil drum, holding her breath. The creature’s slack jaw and vacant eyes reminded her of a video game zombie, but this was no game.

Think, Sophia, she told herself, gripping her pistol tightly. Front door’s a no-go. I’ll have to find another way out.

Taking shallow breaths to steady her nerves, she crept farther into the factory, using the shadows to stay hidden. She felt like a stealthy predator, slipping from one hiding spot to another, though she knew she was the prey.

After what felt like an eternity, she reached the back corner of the factory. There, just as the book described, stood an old metal cabinet. This was where the serum was hidden.

Sophia knelt down, her hands groping blindly along the base of the cabinet. Her fingers scraped against grime and debris, but she kept searching, heart pounding in her ears.

A sound behind her—a faint shuffle—made her freeze.

The zombie. It was getting closer.

Her search became frantic. Just as she was about to give up, her fingers brushed against something small and boxy. She yanked it out, dirt falling away to reveal a compact metal case. Her hands trembled as she pressed a switch, and the case clicked open to reveal a tiny glass vial.

Got it!

But her triumph was short-lived.

The metal cabinet door creaked open on its own.

Sophia froze, clutching the vial tightly. The eerie groan of the door echoed through the factory, amplifying the sense of dread crawling up her spine.

Then she saw it—a pale shape stirring in the darkness.

Something was inside the cabinet.

Her breath hitched as the shape moved, shifting slightly, and then fully stepped into the dim light. It wasn’t a zombie.

It was a man.
