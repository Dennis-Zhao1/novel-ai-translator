At that moment, the scene from the original novel depicting Z and Yi Ning's intimate encounter suddenly flashed in Sophia Wang's mind. It wasn’t long, probably just about two hundred words, but she vaguely remembered it went something like this—

"Yi Ning deeply realized that Z was the one person she would give everything to have in her life. She was willing to sacrifice the lives of four key bases to make him the subject of a living experiment, hoping for just a glance or a moment of his attention. After meeting him, she understood what true loneliness felt like. She didn’t know whether what she was doing was right or wrong; perhaps she would end up in hell for it, but she didn’t care what kind of person he was. She longed to be by his side, even if it meant burying bodies for him after he killed. She didn’t want anything else but his heart.

In a daze, Yi Ning felt Z’s fingers parting the last barrier beneath her. With her eyes closed, she was unaware of the exquisite sensations washing over her. She wanted to open her eyes, but no matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t muster the strength. She didn’t know why, but she didn’t care either. After all, this was the man she loved most; reaching this point felt like a blessing from fate. What more could she possibly ask for?

Yi Ning tilted her neck in impatience, convinced that Z couldn’t resist her. To ensure the success of this plan, she had smeared a drug she had read about in his laboratory on the letter she sent him—one that could intoxicate the mind and ensnare the soul…"

Sophia Wang shivered and abruptly pushed Z away, the lingering details of that scene tightening her chest with unexplainable frustration. She didn’t understand why she felt this way or why such thoughts made her unhappy. Unable to control her emotions, she decided to flee the moment.

Z watched her retreating figure, a mix of calmness and a barely perceptible weariness in his eyes. He had already seen through her; Sophia Wang was simply afraid of him. Otherwise, she wouldn’t avoid him so completely. There weren’t so many reasons behind her actions—too much confidence often bordered on arrogance, something he would never admit to.

He genuinely wanted to treat her better. He wasn’t cold-hearted; he just didn’t know how to be tender. He wasn’t sad—he just felt it was all a waste, though shamefully, he couldn’t stop himself.

Furrowing his brow, Z turned to leave, but then he spotted Yi Ning standing a short distance away. It dawned on him why Sophia Wang had run off so distressingly; he had initially thought it was his fault, but it seemed he had overthought it. Alright, then.

"I remember you." Yi Ning approached Z, playfully winking with a smile. "Even though your previous actions were quite baffling and rude, I’m not angry at you." She confidently extended her hand towards him. "Hello, let me reintroduce myself. I’m Yi Ning, nice to meet you."

Z cast a dispassionate glance at the woman, who could only be described as "pretty" in the narrowest sense. There was an added chill to his indifferent demeanor as his sharp eyes narrowed slightly. He brushed past her without even offering a word, not even a punctuation mark of acknowledgment.

Her overwhelming, catlike aura of hormones was truly off-putting to him… As Z walked away, he pondered whether he could give her a taste of that drug, the kind that could create an illusion of intimacy with the person one fantasized about. Perhaps that would help temper the bold proclamation emblazoned across her face: “Having sex with me is truly thrilling.” 

…But he would have to wait until the virus he injected into her body was fully processed. After all, it wouldn’t do to risk any mutations at this stage.

It had to be said that in terms of perspective, Z and Sophia Wang shared a subtle alignment in some ways. And our Professor Z, beneath his complex layers, was actually a deeply caring person at heart. He possessed a strong sense of responsibility and kindness that knew no bounds, regardless of time or place. How else could one explain his current behavior?

Why couldn’t he let anyone enjoy a good night’s sleep? First, it had been his “children,” and now, it was him. Sophia Wang felt a sense of despair.

Originally, she had been trying on a dress prepared by a kind aunt for her. But upon seeing the lingerie included with the outfit, tears streamed down her face. Since meeting Z, she had practically given up on wearing underwear; he either didn’t provide her with clothes or only gave her outer garments, leaving her wondering if he was intentionally clueless about women's needs for undergarments!

After putting on the lingerie, Sophia looked at the sexy sailor suit laid out on the bed with mixed feelings. According to the aunt who delivered the clothes, due to the current dire conditions, clean new clothes were limited to uniforms. Considering Miyazaki Natsuki's old suit, Sophia hesitated to complain and reluctantly slipped into the sailor suit.

Just as she pulled her hair from the collar, a knock sounded on the door. When she opened it, it was Miyazaki Yusuke.

Miyazaki Yusuke stood there, momentarily taken aback by Sophia wearing the traditional Japanese sailor suit. His ears flushed with heat as he stammered, “Ms. Wang, I’m sorry to interrupt you, but Professor Z has requested you as an assistant for his urgent project on developing a remedy to neutralize toxins in the air and soil. He specifically asked for you…”

“I’m not a molecular person…” Sophia mumbled, feeling awkward. Miyazaki Yusuke, hearing her, felt a wave of guilt wash over him. He lowered his head, sincerity evident in his tone. “Ms. Wang, I truly apologize, but if you can agree to this, I’m willing to pay any price!”

“…”

“For the sake of the molecular individuals who can live a peaceful life, I would sacrifice my life if necessary!”

“…”

“I’m willing to do anything for you, Ms. Wang—anything you can think of, as long as you agree to this small request.”

“…”

“Ms. Wang…”

“Alright, let’s just talk without the dramatics.” Sophia relented, rubbing her temples. “I’ll go.”

Miyazaki Yusuke released a deep sigh of relief, looking at her with admiration. “Ms. Wang, you truly are the kindest and most wonderful girl I’ve ever met.”

“That’s probably because you haven’t met enough girls.” Sophia dismissed him, turning to close the door as she prepared to find Z. The gentle breeze lifted the hem of her short skirt, making her feel almost as if she were wearing nothing at all. She thought about going back to put on her shorts, but Miyazaki Yusuke seemed afraid she might change her mind. He quickly grabbed her hand and pulled her along.

“Ms. Wang, although I might be a few years younger than you, I’m almost twenty. My experience with girls is indeed limited, but even if I met more, I don’t think I could ever find someone better than you.” Miyazaki Yusuke effortlessly dispensed sweet words, making Sophia’s ears tingle and her cheeks flush with embarrassment.

Just as Z opened the laboratory door, he caught sight of their flirtatious exchange. His expression turned cold as he furrowed his brow, pulling Sophia inside without waiting for Miyazaki Yusuke to say a word. With a loud “bang,” he shut the door and locked it, drawing the curtains closed for good measure.

Sophia stood there in shock, feeling like a lamb entering a tiger's den. 

“Uh, isn’t this about developing some kind of drug? Is it really necessary to lock the door? Can’t Miyazaki-san observe?” she asked cautiously, trying to create some distance between them.

At that moment, Z was back in his pristine white lab coat, his frameless glasses perched on his high nose. He raised his right hand, and in the blink of an eye, Sophia was dazzled by a flash of white light, as if she had glimpsed something extraordinary.
