"What's going on?" Xiao Cha was taken aback by the news, his expression instantly shifting to one of tension. He stood up, ready to leave. But after only a few steps, he abruptly halted, turning back to look at Z with a hint of embarrassment and helplessness on his face. "Dr. Zhang, if there’s nothing too urgent, could you…"

“No,” Z interrupted him without an ounce of mercy. “According to my calculations, the mutated zombies have an attack speed of about 6 meters per second. Based on momentum theory, their striking force is roughly 1.2 kilonewtons. With that kind of power, do you really think you can fend them off the old way? Not to mention their mutation speed—after you deal with one wave, the next will be right on your heels.”

He smirked slightly, his glasses reflecting a cold glint. Sitting back in his chair with his legs crossed, he exuded an air of calm confidence.

Xiao Cha was momentarily stunned, clearly struggling to grasp Z’s complex calculations. Wang Xiaoshu wore a similarly bewildered expression, her gaze fixed on Z, filled with confusion.

Z sighed impatiently, opting for a simpler explanation. “To put it simply, every second, a zombie weighing about the same as Vice Governor Xiao is going to lunge at your soldiers, knocking them down to feast. Do you understand now?”

This time, except for Jie Anjun and Yue Taoliang, everyone else finally grasped the situation, nodding in understanding. Z shot Jie Anjun a glance, his eyes carrying a hint of icy disdain.

Jie Anjun avoided his gaze, lowering his head, but memories of that fateful night, filled with fire and blood, surged uncontrollably in his mind.

It felt like just yesterday. He remembered dragging his nearly lifeless body from Z’s massacre, rescuing Yue Taoliang who was trapped beneath a pile of corpses. If it hadn’t been for that mass of remains blocking their path, and their narrow escape from the raging flames, they would have surely met their end that night.

The terror of that evening was etched in his memory like a scar. And now, he found himself once again face-to-face with this man who filled him with dread.

Xiao Cha gritted his teeth, forcing himself to regain composure. He returned to his seat, propping his chin on his hands, desperately pondering a countermeasure.

Z casually glanced at him before slowly pulling Wang Xiaoshu’s chair closer to his own. His cold gaze swept over Jie Anjun and Yue Taoliang, who had tried to inch closer to Wang Xiaoshu, and they quickly took seats across the table, attempting to avoid provoking Z’s displeasure.

The air seemed to freeze for a moment, thickening the tension in the conference room. Xiao Cha didn’t know what to say, and the others fell into a heavy silence.

“Does anyone have a better plan?” Xiao Cha finally broke the stalemate, pinching the bridge of his nose, fatigue evident in his voice.

Everyone in the room fell into deep thought, tossing out a few suggestions. However, the truly sharpest minds seemed disinterested in participating.

Wang Xiaoshu stared down at the table, her thoughts wandering, when she suddenly felt her chair shift slightly. Turning her head, she saw Z’s hand resting on the table, his gaze still fixed ahead, his expression calm as if nothing had happened.

“What are you thinking about?” she asked in a hushed tone.

“Nothing much,” he replied indifferently, turning his head to glance at her with his narrow eyes, a slight smile curving his lips. “I just find your recent performance quite intriguing.”

Wang Xiaoshu was taken aback, unsure of how to interpret his words. Just as she was about to respond, Xiao Cha’s voice rang out again, “Dr. Zhang, if you’re willing to participate in the operation yourself, our chances of success would increase significantly.”

At this, Z turned his head, his glasses glinting coldly. He reclined lazily in his chair, his voice low yet laced with mockery. “If there are no better options, I don’t mind accompanying you on this little adventure.”

As soon as those words left his mouth, the conference room erupted into a flurry of reactions.
