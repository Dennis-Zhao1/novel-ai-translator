
Chapter 13: The Parting Decision

Sophia Wang was back in the sterile confines of Z’s laboratory, now familiar and yet no less unnerving. He handed her a set of clothes—a black sleeveless tank top and a pair of denim shorts—and directed her toward the bathroom without another word.

When she emerged, freshly washed and barefoot, a pair of new flat sandals awaited her by the door.

Sophia hesitated, her lips pressing into a thin line as she slipped them on. Both the clothes and shoes fit perfectly, as if custom-made. This precision only heightened the knot of unease in her chest.

She looked up to find Z organizing equipment at the large workbench. His tall frame was hunched slightly as he packed various items into a compact suitcase: a custom silver handgun, vials of liquid, packets of compressed food, and an array of other supplies. He moved with his usual detached efficiency, but there was something almost too methodical about it, as though he were trying to distract himself.

Sophia’s gaze lingered on the suitcase. For whom was he packing all these supplies? Surely not for her… Or was it?

Her thoughts twisted into something sour as she observed him tuck a handheld gaming console into the bag, followed by yet another stash of food. A sharp pang of irritation bloomed in her chest.

Was this for someone else? Someone she didn’t know about?

She caught herself frowning and quickly smoothed her expression. But Z’s sharp eyes missed nothing. Turning back to her, he quirked an eyebrow as he closed the case with a deliberate snap.

“Done brooding?” he asked, his tone light but pointed.

Sophia flinched, heat rising to her cheeks. “I, uh… Thanks for the clothes and shoes,” she mumbled, turning on her heel. “I should get going.”

But Z was already at her side. With an unceremonious tug, he shoved the suitcase’s handle into her hand.

“Take it,” he said flatly. “It has everything you’ll need. Weapons, supplies, and enough food to get you where you’re going.”

Before she could argue, he looped a string with a key around her neck. She blinked up at him, stunned.

“The black car parked out front is yours. Don’t mix it up with anything else,” he added.

Sophia stared at the key and then at Z. Was this really for her?

He wasn’t done. He pulled out a tablet, its screen already lit with a detailed navigation program. His long fingers swiped across the screen as he explained the route.

“Follow this exactly,” he said, his voice devoid of emotion. “If you deviate, I can’t guarantee you’ll survive long, no matter how well-supplied you are.”

Sophia hesitantly accepted the tablet, her mind whirring.

Z handed her a small bottle of water and a single pill. “Take this before you leave.”

Sophia stared at the pill suspiciously. “What’s this for?”

“Birth control,” he replied without hesitation, lighting a cigarette and leaning back against the counter.

Her face went crimson. For a moment, she couldn’t tell if she was more mortified or infuriated.

After a long pause, she muttered, “Right…” and swallowed the pill under his watchful gaze.

With everything in hand, she turned toward the door.

“Thanks,” she said softly, her tone unsure, before stepping out into the corridor.

Z didn’t reply. He stood motionless as the sound of her footsteps faded. The moment the door shut behind her, he crushed his cigarette in the ashtray and slammed a nearby cabinet shut with a bang.

An Unexpected Return
Minutes passed. Then the door creaked open again.

Z turned, his expression a mix of confusion and surprise as he saw Sophia standing there, her face a mix of guilt and determination.

“Forgot something?” he asked, his tone laced with sarcasm to mask his lingering frustration.

Sophia shook her head, clasping the tablet tightly. “No. I just… I didn’t catch where the navigation ends. The markers don’t make sense.”

Z’s surprise shifted into exasperation. He grabbed a large sheet of paper from the desk—an intricate map scrawled with lines, symbols, and mathematical notations—and slapped it onto the table.

“It’s here,” he said, pointing to a large red circle on the map.

Sophia leaned in, squinting at the jumble of letters and formulas that surrounded it. None of it made any sense to her.

Z noticed her confusion and sighed, rubbing his temples. “I shouldn’t have overestimated your intelligence,” he muttered.

Sophia’s jaw dropped. “Excuse me?!”

Z didn’t skip a beat. “You know, like a pig,” he said dryly, picking up a pen to write clearer labels over the map.

“Pigs are perfectly intelligent!” Sophia shot back, crossing her arms. “Maybe if you weren’t so cryptic all the time—”

“The point is,” Z interrupted, “this route leads to one of the safest areas currently available. Whether or not you make it there alive depends on how closely you follow the plan.”

Sophia peered at the now-legible map. “This is… ‘Fenris’?” she read aloud.

“Yes,” Z confirmed, his tone neutral.

Sophia studied his face, searching for any sign of deception. She didn’t trust him—not entirely. After all, this was the same man who had caused the apocalypse in the first place. Why would he suddenly care about her survival?

“…Why are you helping me?” she asked cautiously.

Z’s dark eyes locked onto hers, his expression unreadable. “You wouldn’t understand,” he said at last, turning away.

Sophia hesitated. The weight of his response felt heavier than the suitcase in her hand. Without another word, she turned and left, her mind a whirlwind of doubt and suspicion.

As she drove away in the black car, Z stood at the window of his lab, watching her taillights fade into the distance. For a fleeting moment, his stoic mask cracked, revealing something raw and unresolved beneath.

But when the car disappeared completely, Z turned away, retreating to his underground lab.

In the car, Sophia gripped the steering wheel tightly, glancing at the tablet’s glowing screen.

“Fenris…” she murmured. Was it really safe? Or was she driving straight into another one of Z’s experiments?

She didn’t have an answer. But one thing was certain—this wasn’t the last she’d see of him. Not by a long shot.
