Z was driving way too fast, swerving wildly, making it incredibly hard for Wang Jie and the others following him. They struggled to keep up all the way to the atomic laboratory, and many of them, who usually didn't get carsick, were feeling queasy from the ride. It made them wonder just how Wang Xiaoshu was holding up inside the car.

That worry seemed unnecessary, though. Although Z could be quite rude at times, he never neglected his woman. 

Wang Jie saw Z carrying Wang Xiaoshu as he stepped out of the driver's seat. Without sparing a glance at them, Z headed straight into the laboratory, which was guarded by quantum soldiers. His demeanor was so dismissive it made the self-proclaimed victorious quantum beings want to flip tables, but they kept their thoughts to themselves.

“How many medical staff do you need?” Wang Jie asked, trying to suppress his anger at being ignored and forcing himself to sound friendly.

Z carefully laid Wang Xiaoshu down on the surgical table and glanced at Wang Jie and the others behind him. After a moment of thought, he said, “Not a single one. You all need to leave.”

“... Just you?” Wang Jie replied, surprised. “With such serious injuries, you definitely need help...” If he didn’t need assistance, what was Wang Jie supposed to do?

“You can shoot yourself and see if I can handle this,” Z said with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. In a place where no one could see, he clenched his fists tightly, revealing just how anxious and desperate he truly was.

If Wang Xiaoshu died, then everyone standing here—no, the entire world—would lose all meaning for him. He didn’t want to see any of them for even a second.

Of course, even if Wang Xiaoshu survived, they wouldn’t be able to live in this world anymore.

Wang Jie had no idea what was going through Z’s mind at that moment; otherwise, he would surely regret being involved in this mess.

“... Fine,” Wang Jie said, his anger morphing into a mocking smile. “I’ll just watch what you do.” He turned and led the rest of the group away, feeling like a complete joke.

Z shot him a cold glare, and once they were all gone, he pressed a button under the surgical table, locking the entire laboratory down.

How stupid of them to let him get close to the instruments and tools. Were they overly confident in their plans or just underestimating him?

Those who don’t leave themselves an escape route are usually either overly confident or incredibly foolish. Z belonged to the former category, while Wang Jie was clearly in the latter.

Z let out a slow breath, using a handkerchief to wipe the blood off Wang Xiaoshu’s face. He frowned, staring intently at her wounds. For a moment, he seemed helpless against the equipment in the lab, which was quite rare for him.

After about three minutes, he tossed the handkerchief aside and moved to the workbench to prepare the necessary tools.

This lab was one he had used before, equipped with most of the items he needed. However, the medications stored here were ineffective against the newly developed bullets. That was what made him feel stuck.

Annoyingly, he couldn’t leave now; there just wasn’t enough time.

Z gripped a test tube, deep in thought as he worked. Suddenly, his eyes widened, a flicker of light flashing in his dark irises.

---

When Wang Xiaoshu woke up, the pain had faded completely. She felt numb all over—not just her injured shoulder, but also her arms and legs, which were stiff and unresponsive.

Blinking in confusion, she struggled to remember everything that had happened before she lost consciousness. Was she not dead?

With great effort, she examined her surroundings. In her line of sight stood Z, straight-backed, and the various instruments confirming the environment she was in.

It was a laboratory. Z was right there next to her, and she was alive.

Realizing this made her heart race with excitement. She wanted to sit up and hug him, to say something, but when she opened her mouth, no sound came out. Her throat was sore, and there was a metallic taste of blood in her mouth. She thought it was from the blood loss from her shoulder, but her gaze landed on Z's bandaged wrist, and her eyes widened in shock.

“…” She tried, but it was futile. Wang Xiaoshu let her eyelids droop in defeat, unable to voice the words she wanted to say.

Z looked down at her, his gaze unwavering. His long bangs obscured his eyes, and a light stubble adorned his sharp chin. His usually pristine white lab coat was stained with blood, but he had kept her well protected. Surrounding her was a glass shield of some kind, while everything else around him was clean and orderly, contrasting sharply with his disheveled appearance.

When Z saw Wang Xiaoshu open her eyes, he let out a sigh of relief. He noticed her trying to speak but failing miserably, and a tired smile crept across his face as he softly said, “Just lie still; you’ll be fine soon.”

“…” Okay. Wang Xiaoshu looked back at him, trying to convey her confusion through her eyes—what happened to your wrist?

Z seemed to understand her question but chose not to respond. He simply said, “I’ll go clean myself up,” before walking away.

Wang Xiaoshu watched his retreating figure disappear from her sight and, after a brief moment of daze, succumbed to fatigue and fell asleep again.

When she woke up for the second time, the scenery around her had changed once more.

This time, she wasn’t in the laboratory anymore. She felt her body again, and her clothes were clean, as was her injured shoulder. The wound was slightly itchy, likely healing, making it seem like all her problems had been resolved. But… where was Z?

Wang Xiaoshu quickly sat up, her mind racing. She shook her head vigorously, squinting at her surroundings until her blurry vision gradually cleared, revealing Wang Jie’s impassive face.

“Is it you?” Wang Xiaoshu asked, her heart filled with an ominous premonition.

Wang Jie chuckled lightly. “Disappointed to see me?”

Ignoring his mockery, Wang Xiaoshu went straight to the point. “Where is he?”

“Who are you asking about?” Wang Jie pretended to be clueless before suddenly realizing. “You mean Mr. Z, right?”

Wang Xiaoshu couldn’t help but regard him with a perplexed expression. “Are you really my father?”

The answer was clearly no.

But in a way, he was.

Wang Jie’s face darkened at the question, and he stiffly replied, “Since you’ve asked, I’ll prove that I still consider you my daughter.” He turned and calmly instructed those around him, “Prepare a wheelchair. Take the young lady to see our genius.”

Numbly, Wang Xiaoshu lowered her head and sat in the wheelchair that was prepared for her, silently allowing him to push her along with Wang Jie.

After leaving the room, they walked about five hundred meters down the corridor before turning into a room at the end. The door was clearly reinforced, looking exceptionally sturdy. Wang Xiaoshu had only seen such doors in sci-fi movies, as Z always used transparent glass doors, making it seem like his location was impenetrable.

“Ready?” Wang Jie smirked sarcastically.

Wang Xiaoshu didn’t respond but nodded, choosing not to look at him; what she couldn’t see wouldn’t trouble her.

Wang Jie frowned but was too excited to care. He swung the door open, revealing the scene inside.

The room was spacious, with a large glass cage in the center. Z sat inside, dressed in a shirt and slacks, staring down at the floor, his hands clasped over his knees, looking very frail.

He didn’t look up when the door opened, seemingly indifferent to who had entered, as if it didn’t matter who came there.

Wang Jie looked triumphantly at Wang Xiaoshu. “So, do you see now that only your father is someone you should rely on?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Z lifted his head, locking eyes with Wang Xiaoshu through the multiple barriers. She, sitting in the wheelchair, stared back at him, both of them struck by an unspoken understanding.

So, is the modern villain embarrassed to be trapped in a glass cage? Z certainly looked the part, fitting the Hollywood blockbuster vibe, even if Wang Jie’s performance was lacking.

“Go ahead, here’s your chance. Don’t say I’m heartless,” Wang Jie said as he noticed Wang Xiaoshu’s silence. He generously added, “As long as you admit your mistake and obediently stay by my side, I’ll pretend nothing ever happened. What do you say?”

Wang Xiaoshu glanced at him coolly and asked, “Does that include telling you everything about Z and his secrets?”

Wang Jie hesitated, clearly caught off guard by her statement, but he quickly regained his composure, his expression chilling. “It’s better to have the conversation out in the open. Since you know, you’d better be smart about it. Otherwise, your wounds will serve as your lesson.”

Wang Xiaoshu looked down at her left shoulder. The wound had been treated very well, and she no longer felt pain, but all of that was thanks to the man locked away.

If it weren’t for her, he would likely be doing just fine, secretly watching these mortals bring about their own chaotic destruction. He should have been an unbeatable boss, but because of her, he had fallen into this predicament.

Though Z seemed to have willingly put himself in this situation for a reason, she still felt a pang of guilt.

“Let’s forget about it.” Wang Xiaoshu said softly. “I’ll just continue to fall; don’t have too high hopes for me. If I agree to you, I’d feel like I’m betraying my conscience.”

“Conscience?” Wang Jie glared at her. “If you had a conscience, you wouldn’t be with him! Do you even know who he is? So many have died at his hands, and our home has been destroyed by him! Do you even understand?!”

“…” That accusation was truly hard to respond to. Wang Xiaoshu thought for a moment, tilting her head. “Forget it; just pretend I didn’t say anything. My choice remains the same.”

Wang Jie’s eyes widened in disbelief as he looked at her. “... Are you still the Xiaoshu I know? What about your principles? Your sense of shame?!”

“Do I look like someone with principles and a sense of shame?” Wang Xiaoshu laughed suddenly, and while he was off guard, she grabbed his wrist. A strong jolt of electricity surged through Wang Jie, causing him to collapse in shock, losing consciousness.

Unbeknownst to Wang Jie, he had no idea that Wang Xiaoshu possessed such abilities. Aside from Z, it seemed only Yi Ning and Xiao Cha were aware of it.

With Yi Ning and her subordinates all dead and Xia Jing’en also gone, Xiao Cha wouldn’t endanger herself just to find Xiao Yaya, so silence was the only option. As a result, Wang Jie was completely in the dark.

Wang Xiaoshu let out a sigh of relief, her gaze drifting from the unconscious Wang Jie to Z in the cage. He was staring at her, his eyes full of a pitiful longing, as if silently pleading for her help.

Wang Xiaoshu couldn’t help but laugh, holding back the ache in her legs as she propped herself on her arms to stand up from the wheelchair. She intended to figure out how to open the cage, but Z, seeing her stand, strode over and opened the cage door himself, walking out confidently.

“…” The weight of this stark reality was almost crushing.
