Z had chosen not to address the issue with Jie Anyun at that moment, and the primary reason wasn’t due to his character flaws. He wasn’t so arrogant as to believe that no one in this world could defeat him, even though, in a sense, that was true.

He didn’t follow them for two reasons: first, he couldn’t do anything in front of Xiao Cha; second, the mutated virus infecting the zombies might very well be related to the new bullets he had developed. These bullets were specifically designed to interact with the new type of virus inside Yi Ning, causing her immense suffering. However, he had no idea how they would react if mixed with the old H+ strain. 

He didn’t dwell on these thoughts. Time was tight, and he couldn't care less about the lives of others. As long as he could eliminate Yi Ning, losing a few more people was inconsequential—he had always been indifferent about such matters. If he went again with the bullets from the last time, it could lead to complications and put him at risk. He certainly wouldn’t endanger himself for a group of people he deemed insignificant; Sophia Wang was already pushing his limits, and he had no intention of increasing that number.

Jie Anyun indeed didn’t let Z down. He helped Xiao Cha deal with the zombie issue using a bacterial weapon developed in their ion research lab, delivered through a sprayer. The weapon was notably lethal, but as for the side effects—well, when Xiao Cha asked, Jie Anyun remained tight-lipped. Although he didn’t explicitly state that there would be no side effects, Xiao Cha allowed him to use the weapon. After all, they were in a dire situation where hesitation could cost them dearly; using it at least bought them some time while not using it would lead to complete disaster.

As their team finished their mission and was on their way back from the Atom facility, Z and Sophia Wang arrived late. At that moment, Jie Anyun was just looking for an opportunity to say what he had been preparing all along, but Z showed up right on time, preventing him from engaging in the fight and stopping his words from escaping.

Standing beside Z, Sophia Wang caught Jie Anyun’s gaze, which lingered on her before he shifted the focus of his conversation onto her. Z remained silent, yet he exuded a powerful aura that pressed down on Jie Anyun and the others. He smiled as they walked back together, but that smile hid a dangerous edge.

Some people, no matter what they say, are always viewed as scheming, and that itself is quite a skill. Jie Anyun felt a surge of impatience. He had rushed over after receiving an emergency signal from Yi Ning’s tracking device, and overlooking the sensitive presence of Z was already his first major mistake. If he allowed this error to continue, the consequences would be unimaginable. He had to find a way to eliminate Z immediately, or it would be too late.

That evening, Z handed Sophia Wang a glass of water and casually gave her two pills. Before she could ask, he answered, “Take these, and your body will be able to conceive.” 

Sophia Wang trusted him completely and didn’t doubt his words. In a good mood, she drank it down. The more she trusted him unconditionally, the worse Z felt. Once she finished the medication, he stepped out ahead. He wasn’t wearing protective gear; instead, he had on simple black trousers and a white shirt, but he had meticulously tied a tie, looking unusually formal as if preparing for some sacred ceremony.

Sophia Wang thought he seemed a bit odd, but given that his very existence was peculiar, she didn’t think much of it and followed him to a large banquet hall at the Atom facility. This was a sudden message from Xiao Cha, saying something important was to be announced.

“What do you think they want at Atom?” Sophia Wang asked, somewhat disdainful. “Why don’t we just leave this place and not get involved anymore? Let’s go now.”

Z abruptly stopped and fixed his dark eyes on her, unblinking. “Are you sure?” If she was certain, then perhaps they could avoid the impending spectacle of carnage.

There was no way he would walk into a trap unless everyone there was already at his mercy. Jie Anyun had surely done something, but Z wasn’t one to be underestimated; he had single-handedly destroyed an entire laboratory before, burying many in flames. He could easily do that again.

Besides, even if he was alone now, it didn’t mean he would remain just a “man” at that moment.

Sophia Wang thought it over and nodded, “Let’s go. I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed, but let’s wait until tomorrow. It’s too late now, and the area around Atom isn’t safe.”

“If you want to leave, we should go now. Otherwise, don’t mention it again,” Z countered her suggestion.

Sophia Wang stared at him, speechless. Z took her silence as regret and continued towards the banquet hall, his head down as he fiddled with a handheld computer. Complex data displayed on the screen, which Sophia Wang couldn’t begin to understand.

Every road has an end, and some things must be faced. Before long, Z and Sophia Wang arrived at their destination. The banquet hall at Atom was impressively large, resembling a cinema from a peaceful era, with rows of tightly packed seats and a grand stage. A deep red curtain hung down, concealing who knew what, but it gave off an ominous feeling.

“I…” Sophia Wang’s sensitive instincts kicked in again. She grabbed Z’s sleeve, glancing at the few people from Atom and Jie Anyun by the edge of the stage, and stepped back. “Let’s leave.”

Z obediently followed her out, but the heavy doors of the banquet hall slammed shut right in front of her. Tall soldiers brandishing guns stood in a neat line, guarding the entrance without a chink in their armor.

This was clearly Jie Anyun’s arrangement. The soldiers carried notably special weapons, produced by the Ion facility, indicating he wouldn’t come empty-handed.

Z curled his lips in disdain, quickly counting the number of guards stationed at the entrance. Ten. How underestimated he was. One against ten? Ha.

“Dr. Zhang, Miss Wang,” came Xiao Cong’s voice from afar. “Since the two of you are here, why not stay a while and catch up?” He paused for effect, adding meaningfully, “Mr. Miyazaki, I believe you have much to say to Dr. Zhang, don’t you?”

Sophia Wang turned to look ahead. Miyazaki Yusuke’s figure stood among the crowd, unremarkable, but she easily spotted him because he was the only one unarmed.

Miyazaki Yusuke pressed his lips tightly in conflict, glaring at Z with a mix of anger and restraint, but ultimately he said nothing.

Xiao Cong cast a disdainful glance at him. Clad in military attire, he appeared even taller and more commanding as he stepped forward, the crisp sound of his boots echoing. “Dr. Zhang? Heh, shouldn’t I be calling you Mr. Z instead?”

Sophia Wang’s sense of foreboding was confirmed. While she was surprised, it felt as if she had anticipated this day would come. Was it relief or just numbness that made her sigh?

“Stop the pointless struggles,” Xiao Cong boasted. “Surrender quietly.”

Z surveyed the surrounding soldiers without making a move. Seeing him remain calm only fueled Xiao Cong’s arrogance. “As long as you cooperate and behave, I won’t kill you right away. Otherwise, your fate will be the same as Miss Wang’s.”

Xiao Cha interjected, “Miss Wang may not necessarily know his true identity.”

“Doesn’t know?” Xiao Cong raised an eyebrow. “Do you think she looks like someone who doesn’t know? A woman who’s with someone like Z can’t be anything good.” He sneered, “Bitch.”

The word “bitch” seemed to flip a switch in Z, and his aura shifted dramatically. The soldiers around him froze in confusion, retreating unconsciously, their guns falling to the ground.

Z’s lips curled into a minuscule smile as he slowly pulled out a small bottle from the pocket of his lab coat. The cap was open, and a peculiar scent wafted out. The soldiers surrounding him inhaled the aroma and collectively lost their strength, standing there dazed and motionless.

“What’s happening!?” Xiao Cong exclaimed, drawing his gun on Z. “Stay where you are!”

“Orders are products of status, their value depending on who issues them,” Z said, his tone dangerously raising an eyebrow. “If they come from your mouth, it will only hasten your death.”

“Even if you’re not afraid of dying, you should still consider Miss Wang,” Xiao Cha pointed out sharply, her voice dripping with sarcasm. “If I’m not mistaken, all your actions were done behind Miss Wang’s back. The mutations in the zombies are because of you, the injuries to Yaya were because of you, and Yi Ning’s injuries are also because of you.”

Sophia Wang froze, staring at Z in shock. He stood still, neither denying nor confirming anything.

Xiao Cha seemed to enjoy dismantling Z’s facade. “You must have made some promises to Miss Wang for her to follow you, but it seems you haven’t delivered, have you? Your actions only continue your cruel agenda. Although you helped create an antidote, the disaster there was caused by you, and your intentions were never benevolent.”

Jie Anyun took a step forward, looking at Z from a distance. “Miss Xiao has already woken up. Your plan has been exposed—there’s no need for further denial.”

Sophia Wang stood there, stunned, watching everything unfold. Z continued to walk forward, but this time he grasped her wrist firmly. He didn’t fear the guns pointed at them; instead, he turned to Sophia Wang and said, “Stop guessing. What they say is true. I never intended to change; I was deceiving you. This filthy world is time for it to be destroyed completely.”

He turned his gaze back ahead, his dark eyes shining beneath his bangs, a strange smile on his lips. His tone grew ominously heavy, evoking a deep-seated fear: “Tonight, let me take you all to meet God.” With a snap of his fingers, the heavy curtain that hung down suddenly fell, revealing iron barriers that slowly rose to unveil hundreds of bloodthirsty zombies.

Sophia Wang stood there, dumbfounded, watching the scene before her, her mind racing with four words—zombies unleashed.

They were the butcher, and the people below were the meat.

Z turned back, smiling at Sophia Wang, speaking softly, “I don’t want to be a hero of the world; I only want to protect you, to be your knight. Would you like to help me create our new world?”
