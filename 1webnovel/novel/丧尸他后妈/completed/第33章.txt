Yining was taken aback. She had no idea there was such a solution. Initially, she intended to use the shove from Ouyang to push Sophia Wang into the horde of zombies, but reality played a cruel joke on her.

“Ouyang!” she screamed from where she stood, paralyzed by fear, unable to take a step closer for one last look at him. After the zombie with its head blown off fell, the others continued to swarm Ouyang. They were mindless, devoid of any pain or thought; their hunger drove them into a frenzy, and they pounced on the only living person left lying on the ground.

Z watched Yining coldly as tears streamed down her beautiful face. She covered her mouth, seemingly unable to make a sound, as if she had suffered a terrible blow.

Sophia Wang fired shot after shot, exploding the heads of the zombies. Their numbers were overwhelming, and her ammunition was far from enough. As she fired her last bullet, she could only watch in horror as Ouyang was gradually consumed by the stench of decay. In his final moments, it seemed he looked at her, his eyes filled with regret and guilt. Perhaps if he had the chance, he would have apologized to her.

“Captain!” Ouyang's three subordinates were incredibly loyal, rushing forward to temporarily fend off the zombies that kept coming. Miyazaki Yusuke helped pull the barely breathing Ouyang out of the fray, but Ouyang's face was barely recognizable now.

After a flurry of activity, they managed to eliminate the remaining zombies. Once the area seemed to fall into an eerie silence, they all gathered around Ouyang.

Z crouched down to examine Ouyang’s injuries, then calmly uttered three words: “There’s no saving him.” He stood up and turned away, walking over to Sophia Wang and covering her eyes. “Don’t look.”

Sophia grasped his hand, moving it away from her eyes but not letting go. She held on tightly and forced herself to calm down, her face pale. “No, I want to see. I need to learn and grow, to face this world and understand that when it comes to life and death, nothing is truly let go.”

Sometimes, all you need to do is close your mouth, watch silently, and learn—acknowledging your past foolishness and idealism, admitting to your mistakes and the shame you’ve experienced. This isn’t giving up or lacking self-respect; it’s growth.

They stood in an expansive square that seemed to stretch on forever, the sky tinged with a faint blue hue. The sunlight was reminiscent of the peaceful era she once lived in. This place should have had the same glorious starry skies and beautiful sunrises, just like that world. But the changes in the world had forgotten this place.

“I hope you really have decided to change because we can’t escape the responsibility for everything happening right now.” Sophia lowered her gaze, speaking softly in a tone only she and Z could understand. This time, she didn’t use “you” or “I”; she used “we.”

Z suddenly felt as if there was something separating them, something he had caused. He hadn’t actively spread more, but the origin came from him, and to this day, he didn’t feel he had done anything wrong or genuinely wanted to repent.

Even now, he didn’t feel the slightest discomfort or unease over Ouyang’s death. Yet, he was affected by her emotions, starting to scrutinize how this sky differed from the past and whether the path he chose should be continued.

From a young age, he understood that no matter how severe the injury, it was something he had to bear alone. No matter how people or the world treated him, he wouldn’t cry because no one would feel sorry for him. Now, he finally had someone, and he sincerely didn’t want to lose her, especially not by his own hands.

Most rapists are often those whose sexual lives are unfulfilled, thieves act out of economic hardships, and murderers don’t kill without reason; they’re driven by desperation or immense emotional blows. No one commits crimes without a cause, but does that mean such evils should be forgiven?

It shouldn’t be.

In the past, he had never thought about these issues because those who criticized him were not her. He didn’t care what they said or how they viewed him, but Sophia was different. No matter how much he scolded her, it couldn’t compare to the moment he saw her.

“Let’s go.” Sophia Wang tucked her gun back into its holster, looking utterly exhausted. Her back seemed weary, a stark contrast to her usual spirited self. Z couldn’t help but wonder if her reaction was due to still thinking about Ouyang.

But in truth, Sophia Wang was not thinking about Ouyang at all. She was solely worried about Z.

Ouyang’s death brought into sharper focus her vague understanding of the H+ virus. As she pulled the trigger, exploding the heads of the zombies, her mind was constantly occupied with thoughts of Z.

How could she help him so they could be together without worry? If she spent her entire life striving for this purpose, only to fail, should she just give up and follow him into despair?

Suddenly, she remembered her father, and her eyes stung with tears. She longed for the simplicity of her past life, yet couldn’t let go of this heavy, oppressive world and the person she shouldn’t have feelings for. It felt as if someone was pulling at her, trying to tear her in two.

Z observed her contradictions, interpreting them as grief for Ouyang, blaming him for his death, and wanting to distance herself from him.

Sitting bewildered in the driver’s seat, Z watched as Miyazaki Yusuke forcefully blew off the head of the already-mutating Ouyang, stopped by Yining and the others. He glanced at the co-pilot seat where Sophia Wang rested with her eyes closed, perplexed. He had only been trying to please her, so why did it end up irritating her?

Indeed, that’s how relationships work. When you care too much for someone, every nerve becomes tightly wound, fearing to say or do the wrong thing. Every expression and action of theirs is dissected countless times, and even when doubts arise, the courage to seek clarity or question falls away, leading to misunderstandings.

Dating is likely this complex interplay of contradiction, misunderstanding, understanding, and comforting each other.

“It’s done,” Miyazaki Yusuke said as he passed Z, reporting, “Ouyang’s body has been dealt with, so there won’t be any mutations.” He sighed, his tone filled with sadness. “He was reckless but still a good man.”

Z’s lips twitched slightly, offering a noncommittal nod.

Miyazaki Yusuke perked up, smiling at him. “Professor Z, you’re accomplished at such a young age! Not only did you help with the molecular issue, but you also handled those zombies with ease. I’m glad to know you!”

“…” Z raised an eyebrow, surprised. “So it sounds like I’ve made a contribution to humanity?”

Miyazaki Yusuke replied with utmost sincerity, “Of course! One day, all of humanity will thank you! I believe you have the ability to earn everyone’s respect!”

Sophia Wang couldn’t help but cover her face, turning her head away. She genuinely wondered how Miyazaki Yusuke would react if he eventually discovered that the person he idolized as a god was Mr. Z. She could almost foresee his despair.

Z felt a little awkward, too. Had he really contributed to humanity? It was terrifying to think about. Those who bore too many expectations rarely ended well. Just look at his previous 25 subjects—every time ended in disappointment, leading to their destruction and abandonment. The higher you are held up, the harder you fall.

“Alright, this place isn’t safe; we shouldn’t linger. I need to go comfort Miss Yining,” Miyazaki Yusuke sighed, bidding farewell as he headed toward the green pickup truck behind him.

Xiao Yaya had been watching him like he was an idiot, her gaze even more pronounced now.

Sophia Wang glanced sideways at Z, who awkwardly ignored her, seemingly upset about something, looking hard to placate.

Seeing this, Sophia gradually pushed aside her own turmoil, thinking she would take things one step at a time. When the moment to choose arrived, she would face it then. For now, they could all get along, so why waste any precious time?

So, Sophia took the initiative to joke with Z to lighten the mood. “How did I do earlier? My aim was spot on, not a bit nervous—what a genius I am! I’m truly impressed with myself.” She sighed in relief, smiling as she awaited Z’s teasing in return, but he showed no reaction.

Confused, she looked at him. Although her behavior seemed to indicate a tendency towards masochism, she helplessly asked, “What are you thinking? Hurry up and praise me!”

Z felt a twinge of reluctance to ignore her. But recalling how she had seemed to blame him for Ouyang’s death moments ago, he felt uncomfortable, and his tone reflected that. “I’m impressed with myself too.” He raised his chin, his handsome face shadowed by a dark expression.

Sophia Wang was taken aback, confused. “How come?”

Z scoffed softly, turning his head away. “I admire my own patience.”
