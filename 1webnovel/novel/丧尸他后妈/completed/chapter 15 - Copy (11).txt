Chapter 15: The "Professor" Joins the Ride

Z stood there, calm and composed, as if he had just stepped out of a magazine spread rather than being in the middle of a post-apocalyptic nightmare. His soft smile and gentlemanly demeanor belied the chaos he often left in his wake.

Meanwhile, inside the car, Sophia Wang couldn’t help but question every life choice that had led her to this moment.

What is he doing here? she thought, panic swirling in her chest.

“Professor,” Z had just introduced himself with an air of refined detachment, but his eyes, sharp and calculating, locked onto Sophia like a hawk sizing up its prey.

“Professor?” Sophia muttered under her breath, leaning her head against the steering wheel. “What kind of serial killer alias is that? Next, he’ll start giving TED Talks on how to weaponize humanity’s doom.”

“Miss Wang,” said Palace Yusuke (or as Sophia had now privately dubbed him, ‘Pseudo-Putin’), interrupting her spiraling thoughts, “it seems we’ll be traveling with Professor for a while. Isn’t that great?” His tone was laced with oblivious sincerity.

Sophia gritted her teeth and forced a smile. “Oh, absolutely thrilling. Can’t wait.”

Z, still embodying his faux affability, casually approached the car’s window. His fingertips lightly tapped the glass as he bent down to meet her gaze through the window. “May I?”

Sophia hesitated. She knew that look—it was the one that preceded Z doing something extraordinarily unhinged.

“Sure, why not?” she said finally, popping the lock with a sense of impending doom.

Z slid into the passenger seat with the kind of poised elegance one might expect from royalty entering a gala. His every move was calm, deliberate, and utterly maddening.

“Comfortable?” Sophia asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

“Quite,” he replied smoothly, glancing at her with an amused glint in his eyes. He settled back into the seat and glanced over his shoulder at the group standing outside the car. “The rest of you may use the other vehicle. I’ll accompany Miss Wang.”

“What?!” Sophia’s voice pitched.

Before she could protest further, Yusuke nodded amicably. “Good idea. It’s better to have a clear distribution. Professor, we’ll follow your lead. If you notice anything off, let us know immediately.”

Sophia felt the blood drain from her face.

Z smiled, his teeth flashing in the dimming sunlight. “Of course. I’ll keep a close eye on everything.”

The Journey Begins

Sophia gripped the steering wheel like her life depended on it—which it very well might. Her mind raced as the group set off, her car leading while Yusuke and his team trailed closely in the other vehicle.

“You didn’t answer my question,” Sophia muttered under her breath, her eyes fixed on the road.

“Which question?” Z asked, his voice a low purr that seemed designed to get under her skin.

“What are you doing here?”

Z tilted his head, pretending to mull over her words. “You make it sound like I don’t belong. I assure you, Sophia, I have every right to be where I please.”

“That’s not an answer,” she shot back, frustration bubbling in her chest.

“Very well,” he said, leaning back in his seat, his tone turning more serious. “You’re heading to the molecular base, aren’t you?”

Sophia stiffened. “So what if I am?”

He smirked, clearly enjoying her unease. “I’m merely curious to see how they’ll react to you. After all, you’re carrying something quite... special.”

Her hands tightened around the wheel. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Z chuckled softly, his fingers tapping rhythmically against the car door. “Oh, but you do. The question is, do they?”

A Suspicious Stop

The convoy reached a dilapidated checkpoint just a few miles from the molecular base. The once pristine road was cracked and overgrown, with rusted signs warning of dangers ahead.

Yusuke signaled for them to stop, and both vehicles came to a halt. He approached Sophia’s car, leaning down to speak through the open window.

“This area used to be a military outpost,” he explained. “It’s best if we proceed on foot from here. The road ahead might be blocked, and we don’t want to risk the vehicles.”

Sophia looked over at Z, half-expecting him to veto the idea, but he simply smiled and gestured for her to exit the car.

“After you,” he said smoothly.

Sophia groaned inwardly but complied, grabbing her bag and stepping out into the dusty twilight.

Unwelcome Discoveries

As the group trudged forward, the oppressive silence of the wasteland settled over them. The checkpoint loomed ahead, its gates twisted and broken, like the maw of some great beast.

Sophia couldn’t shake the feeling that they were being watched. Her eyes darted to Z, who seemed completely at ease, as if he were on a leisurely stroll through a park.

“Professor,” Yusuke called out, “do you know anything about this area?”

Z stopped, turning to face him with a faint smile. “Only that it’s seen better days.”

“Helpful,” Sophia muttered under her breath.

As they passed through the gates, a low growl echoed from the shadows. The group froze, their weapons raised.

Sophia’s heart pounded in her chest. She glanced at Z, who appeared... intrigued.

“Fascinating,” he murmured, his dark eyes gleaming with anticipation.

Before anyone could react, a hulking figure emerged from the darkness—a mutated beast that looked like it had stepped straight out of a nightmare. Its flesh was mottled and decayed, its eyes glowing an unnatural green.

The group braced for a fight, but Z merely stepped forward, his posture calm and unyielding.

“Stand back,” he said, his voice carrying a quiet authority that made even Sophia hesitate.

The creature snarled, its claws scraping against the pavement. But as it charged, Z raised a single hand.

“Sit.”

To everyone’s astonishment, the beast froze mid-charge. It hesitated, then slumped to the ground, its head bowed as if awaiting orders.

Sophia’s jaw dropped. “What the hell?”

Z turned to her, his smile enigmatic. “I told you, Sophia. I have a way with... family.”

Her blood ran cold.
