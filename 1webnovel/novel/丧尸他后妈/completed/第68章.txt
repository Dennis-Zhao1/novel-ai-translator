This was a pleasant and tranquil time, where both of them tacitly avoided discussing bothersome matters. However, these issues would eventually need resolution. The day felt somewhat peculiar from its very start. 

Sophia Wang found herself in a dilemma as she stood outside Z's room, waiting for him to finish changing. After nearly half an hour of waiting, she decided to enter. Although they were practically “old married folks” by now, she believed that respecting personal space was a basic courtesy.

"Doctor, you need to take a look at this! My period is almost half a month late!" Sophia declared, brandishing a pack of sanitary pads in front of Z, her voice firm. "There must be something wrong!"

Z’s lips twitched as he swatted the pads away with the sleeve of his shirt, his expression remaining nonchalant. "You're just being irritable and overthinking things. By the looks of you, it's probably just hormonal imbalance."

"Isn't that more like menopause?" Sophia broke out in a slight sweat, then asked a question that caught him off guard, "Do you think I might be pregnant?"

"…"

Twenty minutes later, they sat across from each other at the table, their expressions serious and the atmosphere heavy with tension. But as soon as Sophia spoke, the weighty silence shattered.

"I thought your 'equipment' was malfunctioning, but it turns out I really am pregnant!" she exclaimed joyfully, "You didn’t make a mistake, did you? You really can do it?"

"…" No man enjoys hearing his partner question his abilities, especially in such a disbelieving tone.

Z replied stiffly, "I’d rather you doubt my test results."

Sophia, in a sisterly manner, wrapped her arm around his shoulder, saying, "Well, even if you die, at least I’ll have a son to keep me company! Haha." 

What was this tone of triumph, as if she had finally turned the tables? Z squinted at her and replied coldly, "Unfortunately, I can’t die."

Sophia wasn’t surprised at all. "I knew you wouldn’t die. I’ve never worried about that."

"Should I thank you for acknowledging my capabilities?"

"No need. We’re too familiar with each other for that," Sophia said, springing up in a fit of joy, spinning around happily in the lab. "This is amazing! By the way, we should head back to that quantum lab. Didn’t you say the blueberries were ready? You haven’t forgotten your promise, have you?"

Z crossed his legs and propped his head on one hand, watching her with a blank expression. When she thought he might backtrack, she felt a rush of anxiety. But after a brief pause, he simply said, "Okay."

He had been remarkably compliant lately, rarely opposing her decisions, which left Sophia feeling both flattered and a bit unreal. Who would have thought that the man who had once seemed so relentless would turn out this way? With a sense of contentment, she returned to his side, wrapping her arms around his neck, resting against him and exhaling happily. Z tilted his head, looking down at her pale hand, the veins visible beneath her skin. He lowered his head slightly and placed a kiss on her hand.

"Since it’s come to this," Z said, his tone indifferent, "I have a question for you in return."

"What question?" she asked softly.

"Is Wang Jie dead?"

"…" Sophia paused before answering, "I don’t want to lie to you. I don’t know."

Z looked at her with a questioning gaze as she straightened up to meet his eyes. "I haven’t detected his presence at all. Even after opening all the grids, I haven’t seen him. The only ones left nearby are harmless, and those poor souls waiting for you to inject them with the vaccine."

"I see." Z nodded lightly. "Then perhaps I know where they went."

"You know? Then hurry up and resolve it! Make the outside safe, okay? I don’t want to worry about zombies when I’m trying to plant sunflowers in the yard."

Z chuckled softly. "I can alter the virus so that they’ll kneel and greet you when they see you."

"… For some reason, I suddenly imagined zombies in maid outfits cleaning your house."

"Good idea," Z replied approvingly.

Sophia shrugged, "Still, I think human aesthetics suit my taste more."

"In that case," Z said, with a slight smirk, as if he were reluctant to concede, "let’s bring those few people down."

"Huh?" Sophia raised an eyebrow in confusion.

Z pointed behind her. She turned around to see a large screen on the wall displaying the situation below. Xiao Cha and Xiao Ya Ya were standing there, seemingly trying to find a way down, with Xiao Cha frowning deeply, looking troubled and helpless.

"What do they want?" Sophia instantly tensed up.

Z was pleased with her wariness and gently reassured her, "It’s alright. I asked them to come."

"You?" She looked at him in surprise.

Z’s long fingers brushed over his thin lips, his expression enigmatic. "Some things are better handled by him than by us."

"What else is there that you can’t handle?" Sophia asked, both curious and puzzled.

"Of course," Z stood up and pressed the button to open the door, watching as Xiao Cha pulled Xiao Ya Ya into the elevator, slowly making their way down. He glanced back at Sophia. "Like killing Wang Jie."

"…"

"If you did it, you would feel guilty. If I did it, I’d worry you’d have a mental block." He shrugged, appearing nonchalant. "So let someone else do it. Do you think that’s why the entrance was never discovered?"

… Oh, so he had already made contact with Xiao Cha. Xiao Cha had finally found his long-lost sister, even if she had been disfigured…

"Then why are you bringing them here now?" Sophia asked.

Z crossed his arms and leaned against the table. "To end everything."

… Should she say thank you? Or give him a compliment?

Maybe it was better not to, considering he was the father of her child, and being a dad meant taking responsibility.

Sophia waited eagerly to see how he would resolve everything, but when Xiao Cha and Xiao Ya Ya arrived, they hardly exchanged a word before leaving. Z merely handed them a bottle containing an unknown liquid and a box of some unspecified medication, and they left cheerfully. What was going on here?

Can someone please check on the girl next to Z? This is a call for love, a gentle breeze of life, a source of vitality!

"What are you looking at so intently?" Z had approached her without her noticing, exhaling with relief. "Now we can go wherever you want. Where do you want to go?"

"What just happened? Why is it over?" Sophia countered with a question instead of answering.

Z found her blank expression amusing and laughed softly. "Did you think it was complicated? The people still alive are relatively spirited and certainly not foolish enough to disturb our lives."

"What did you give them?" she asked again.

Z pondered for a moment before replying, "One is what you expect, and the other… probably a beauty serum."

Sophia’s lips quirked in a mix of joy and sorrow. "You mean you gave the vaccine to Xiao Cha?"

Z didn’t answer; he just turned to start tidying up. "We’ll be leaving here for a long time. Make sure to take everything you need."

Sophia leaned closer, pursuing the topic. "Is it true? Come on, tell me!"

Ignoring her questions, Z stated, "I’ve arranged a schedule for you. You need to follow it before you give birth." He slapped a piece of paper onto her face, and her expression turned sour upon seeing it.

"Studying is one thing, but why am I also learning to play the piano? I play the violin!" Sophia protested, holding up the paper. "And why do I have to watch you for at least eight hours a day? What kind of requirement is that?"

Z looked at her with a cold smile. "Of course you have to watch me. Otherwise, what if the child comes out looking like you? That would be a disaster."

"…" Sophia suppressed her anger, her eyes flickering with fire. "I’m really curious about what I am to you. Could you please have Dr. Zhang describe how you see me?"

Z smirked, unable to hold back a laugh, and nodded, saying two words: "Mine."

"…"

"What are you standing there for? Let’s go," Z called out as he picked up a small computer and started pressing buttons.

All of Sophia's anger deflated instantly. It was already remarkable that he had reached this point. What more could she ask for? It seemed destined that they would be together, as neither of them would find anyone else to rely on…

As Z and Sophia left, they were met by the long-lost Optimus Prime. Optimus was still the same, but it seemed to keep a wary distance from Sophia, often maintaining a significant gap. At first, she didn’t notice, but eventually, she couldn’t help but ask.

"Why does it always avoid me?" Sophia asked Z, who was deeply engrossed in studying "Fruit Tree Cultivation Techniques." Z looked up, his narrow eyes behind his glasses twitching slightly as he replied in a very restrained tone, "I think I’ve mentioned more than once not to disturb me while I’m studying."

Sophia covered her mouth to stifle a laugh. "Oops, sorry, I forgot~"

"… So?"

"So? So hurry up and answer my question!" she said as if it were obvious.

Z glanced at her slightly protruding belly and, holding his breath, said, "Maybe its database has some bad memories of you from the atomic era."

"… Haha." Sophia chuckled awkwardly. "Is that so? Can I erase those memories? Wouldn’t that make the world a little better?"

Z looked up at the sun. Under the bright blue sky, the small garden was filled with blooming sunflowers. It was already the season of warmth and blossoming. Time flew by so quickly; they had known each other for so long and were about to have a healthy baby.

"The world has always been beautiful," Z said casually.

"Huh?"

"You can operate it however you like. No need to ask me." Z returned to his book, as if he hadn’t just said something astonishing.

Sophia slowly smiled, getting up from the recliner, putting on her shoes, and approaching Optimus, who seemed lost in thought. As she passed Z, she quickly whispered, "Thank you."

Thank you? For him?

Z didn’t look up, but the corners of his mouth lifted slightly. That word perhaps should have been one he said to her. After all, how could a test subject with an incomplete childhood and distorted views of the world possibly know what reality was like? There’s a saying, "You become what you see." Having witnessed those equally damaged scientists and subjects, how could he be normal?

In short, he would do his best to compensate for what was missing. As for Sophia and their future child, he would provide them with a strong backing and a bright future. That was his only goal for the latter half of his life.

These thoughts were never something he spoke to her about. He didn't even need her to know. He would silently carry out his plans, treating love the same way.

It seemed he had never once taken the initiative to express feelings like "I love you," but that didn’t matter anymore. If the next moment were the end of the world, he might seriously tell her he loved her. However, given his nature, as long as there was tomorrow, he would never open his mouth to say such things, nor would he allow the end of the world to happen.

At the very least, even if he couldn’t stop the world from changing and ultimately collapsing, he could take her away from here.

Z watched Sophia from a distance. She stood in the sunlight, wearing a loose short skirt. Beside her was Optimus, who felt trapped and lost. The gentle breeze ruffled her hair, now grown to her waist, and Z thought he could hear a beautiful melody.

It seemed that many things were like this.

You first need to believe before you can possess. As for whether you needed it at that moment, you must set it aside. Because once you believe and possess, you will realize just how much you need her.

A stable relationship allows both parties to have their own little world, with no interference or dependency, no extravagant praise or lies, and no complaints or concealments about reality. Yet, despite everything, they just wanted to be together.

In all the past where things have changed, I love you the most.

==THE END==

69. Epilogue...
If a child could choose, then as the child of Z and Sophia, he would be very unwilling to come into this world.

He was acutely aware that he was born to suffer, to prove how brilliant and mighty his father was and how stunningly beautiful his mother was. He knew, he just knew, that he must have been born from a five-dollar top-up.

Have you ever seen a father who watches cartoons while making his son study? That was exactly his father.

His dad said he was making up for his lost childhood and that his name came from this.

Is that so? Ha, indeed, the name Tom is just so hard to accept.

However, at least when he was first born, he was a happy little prince. But as he grew up, his status in this family sank to that of a pet-level house elf.

To live or to perish, that was a question—a question of whether to silently endure his father's brutal torment or to ignore his mother's willful ignorance, yielding to his father's tyranny. Which was more noble?

The seven-year-old boy, unsure if he should be called Zhang Tom or Wang Tom, stood in the garden at the door, helplessly gazing up at the moon. His vacant expression and despondent demeanor vividly conveyed his melancholy.

Suddenly, a voice shouted "Cut!" from nearby, and the boy's face instantly fell. He turned and walked away expressionlessly, fists clenched.

"Hey?" Sophia, having turned off the camera, looked puzzled at her son's retreating figure. "Tom, where are you going? It’s bedtime after filming!"

"I'm going to the lab." The boy said this without looking back as he dashed toward the underground lab. Sophia hurried after him, worried about his safety, murmuring, "Going down now is like committing suicide. I’m your mom, and I can’t protect you."

What was in the lab at this moment? Someone? Who was it?

The little boy skillfully punched in the password to enter the lab. After patting his chest in relief, he looked back, thankful his mom hadn’t caught up. But just as he relaxed, he turned around to meet his father's piercing gaze.

Z stood straight beside the experiment table, the light reflecting off his frame-less glasses. The boy couldn't see his father's eyes, but he could tell he was in for a bad time.

"Do you know what time it is?" Z asked, his thin lips moving without a hint of emotion.

The boy instinctively took a step back, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "… Sorry, Father, I…"

"I don’t want to hear your excuses. I only care about the outcome." Z raised his wrist to check his watch. "It’s a quarter past twelve. What time did I specify for you to go to sleep on your schedule?"

"… Nine o'clock."

"And how late are you?"

"…"

"Answer me."

"…"

"What’s wrong?" Z’s mouth twisted into a menacing smile, the dim light around him casting shadows like the approach of death.

No matter how calm a seven-year-old could be, Z's intimidating demeanor made him burst into tears. Sophia, who had been watching from the doorway, could take it no longer, rushing in to scoop her son into her arms, comforting him, "Don’t cry, sweetheart, don’t be afraid."

The moment Z saw Sophia, his expression shifted to a bright, harmless smile. "Oh, why are both of you here? It’s time for bed."

Sophia felt speechless, letting out a sigh. "He is your biological son, right?"

"Of course," Z replied earnestly. "If he weren’t, I’d kill him first, then you, and finally myself."

"… Enough! Don't you think it’s too gruesome to say such things in front of the child?"

"He probably likes it," Z said casually.

Sophia, holding her child, helplessly turned to leave, but Z, seeing this, set down what he was doing and followed them upstairs. Just as Sophia planned to hold her child to sleep, Z mercilessly grabbed Tom by the collar and tossed him outside.

"Hey, what are you doing?"

"Children with this name should have a painful childhood so they don’t grow up twisted."

"… Seriously? Why does that remind me of Voldemort? = = So you named him like that!"

"What about it?"

Before Sophia could respond, Tom shouted angrily from outside, "Who do you think you are? How could someone so annoying exist?"

Without a second thought, Z opened the door and looked outside. Tom, frightened, darted behind the sofa, peeking out with only his eyes visible.

Z said flatly, "I thought I was your father."
