Sophia Wang's sole purpose was to warm Z's emotions. So, even though he had insulted her, she didn't get angry. Instead, she graciously forgave his rudeness, and with a slight smile, she felt quite pleased with herself.

Z was utterly baffled by her. His heart was tangled with confusion and irritation, yet he couldn't bring himself to blame her. He turned to Xiaoyaya with a grim expression and asked, "Miss Xiao, are you planning to tell me the correct route now?"

Xiaoyaya shivered slightly at his menacing demeanor and quickly replied, "It's, um, this road. Just back up a little and turn left when you see the bend..."

Z let out a cold snort, started the car, and casually asked Sophia, "That was Yi Ning who pushed you, right?"

Sophia looked taken aback, lowering her gaze to her fingers. "Did you see?"

"Of course," Z replied, glancing at the rearview mirror while reversing, a sarcastic smirk on his lips. "Only someone with their back turned, like Miyazaki Yusuke, wouldn't have noticed such a big commotion."

"Yeah," Sophia sighed as she gazed ahead. "What do you think I should do?"

Z obediently offered his suggestion, "I think if you could just shoot her, half of your problems would be solved."

Sophia studied his profile and paused before responding. Once they were on the correct road, she noticed Xiaoyaya eavesdropping and immediately covering her ears, her face displaying a clear "don't listen" expression.

She turned back to Z, whispering, "I did consider that at the time, but in that situation, if I really did shoot her, Ouyang's three subordinates and Miyazaki Yusuke wouldn't allow it."

"What are you afraid of with me around?" Z asked, his tone laced with a hint of arrogance. Men were all the same—hard-hearted when it came to soft matters and soft-hearted when it came to tough ones. Despite his disdainful attitude towards Sophia, he was acutely aware of how much he feared her leaving him.

"Two against four, and there are still zombies to deal with. The odds aren't in my favor, and I don't want to take any risks," Sophia replied, running a hand over her face. "If you get hurt because of this, it would be a loss for me."

Z felt all the harsh words on the tip of his tongue get swallowed by her reasoning. He opened his mouth but finally settled on, "I'll handle this. You don’t need to worry about it."

"You will?" Sophia leaned closer, lowering her voice to prevent Xiaoyaya from overhearing. "What’s your plan?"

Z felt a shiver run through him, his body reacting to her proximity. He focused intently on the road ahead, his voice steady as he said, "Just leave it to me. I'll make sure it’s taken care of." As he turned to look at her, his lips brushed against hers. Instantly, Sophia retreated, her fingers brushing her lips in disbelief, and Z lightly chuckled, "You should think about how to repay me."

Sophia felt a bead of sweat trickle down her back. "With Ouyang dead, my father probably won’t hear from me anymore. He might worry, and there are some important things I need to tell him. Do you have a way for me to contact him?"

Z looked at her in surprise. "This is the first time you’ve actively wanted to contact your father. I thought there was no affection between you two."

"..." There really wasn’t any affection. Just thinking about her father reminded her of Wang Dad, so unless absolutely necessary, Sophia chose to ignore the subject. "After all, Ouyang is dead," she sighed.

With her childhood sweetheart's fiancé gone, there would definitely be some explanation required on Wang Jie’s end. If Yi Ning got there first to complain, it would be a disaster.

Z's expression darkened at the constant mention of Ouyang. Suddenly, he slammed on the brakes, stopping the car and getting out.

Sophia stared at his swift movements in disbelief, and soon she saw him opening the rear door, pulling Xiaoyaya out of the car, and handing her over to Miyazaki Yusuke.

A moment later, he returned to the front seat, but instead of taking the driver’s seat, he walked over to the passenger side. "Get out," he ordered, looking at her. "You drive."

"Me?" Sophia pointed to herself in surprise.

"Yes, you. I'm tired and need to rest. Just follow Miyazaki Yusuke's car," he gestured towards the green pickup truck, making his intentions clear. Sophia glanced at his dark circles and obediently got out to take the driver's seat. She closed the door and hesitated, glancing at Z, who had crossed his arms and was feigning sleep. "I’m not very good at driving, so don’t fall too deep into sleep, or else..."

Z abruptly opened his eyes, coldly fixing her with a stare. "Sophia Wang, not sleeping well is the greatest harm to a man. Do you realize you’re jeopardizing my sperm's survival rate?"

...Well, that was a slap in the face! 

Sophia turned back to the wheel, her voice softening as she said, "Then you should sleep well and have sweet dreams."

Z was momentarily taken aback. He regretted saying that, but he couldn't bring himself to back down, ultimately just getting angrier at himself, while Sophia remained unfazed, fully focused on driving, afraid of making a mistake and getting scolded again.

Leaning back, Z stared at the sky, exhaling deeply, not even sure what he was frustrated about, so he decided to blame it on the whole world for now.

With Z relegated to the role of a passenger, and her being the driver, Sophia couldn’t afford to let her mind wander anymore. She concentrated all her efforts on driving, and the car fell into a hush.

After considering the specific steps for dealing with Yi Ning, Z finally closed his eyes and began to rest. This was rare for him; he rarely let his guard down in front of anyone, but when it came to Sophia, it was a different story.

Z's mind felt hazy, perhaps due to sheer exhaustion. Gradually, he fell into a deep sleep, his brain feeling cold and heavy.

It seemed he was dreaming. He couldn’t tell if it was because he’d mentioned "sperm" before sleeping, but he found himself with a son...

However, he wasn’t happy about it at all. Because... he and his son had been abandoned by the child's mother.

The child's mother was undoubtedly Sophia. She had left them, and he and the child stood there, dumbfounded, watching her retreating figure. The child cried out, "Daddy, why doesn’t mommy want us? Aren't I your own? Why did mommy abandon us?"

Z felt an overwhelming guilt at his son's tear-streaked face, and he was overcome with emotion, tears streaming down his cheeks. Even he found his own reflection in this dream to be surreal.

He could hear himself saying, "Son, Daddy... I'm so sorry!"

...

Z jolted awake, drenched in cold sweat, gasping for breath. A pristine handkerchief was handed to him, and he followed the gesture to see Sophia's worried gaze.

"Did you wake up? Xiaoyaya has brought us into the base. You’ve been asleep, and I didn’t have the heart to wake you. Do you want to meet Xiao Cong?" she asked softly.

Z looked at her, still shaken by the remnants of his dream. Serves him right for liking her! How pathetic! He needed to find an opportunity to clear his heart and mind.

"I won't meet him," Z replied blankly as he took the handkerchief, then added after a pause, "Where are Yi Ning and the others?"

Hearing Yi Ning’s name made Sophia inexplicably uneasy. She pursed her lips, "They should be having dinner with Xiao Cong right now."

"Why didn't you go?" Z asked, looking at her.

"Because you're here," Sophia answered matter-of-factly.

That was music to Z's ears, and his expression softened. Just when he felt his mood improving, someone interrupted him.

"Is Miss Wang here?"

A clear, melodious voice, as soothing as a cup of light tea, rang out from outside the car. Sophia opened the door to see a slender man in a dark blue single-breasted uniform standing a few steps away. The uniform resembled that of the German SS but was not entirely the same, featuring crimson piping at the cuffs and collar, accentuating the man's charm and striking contrast to Z's more delicate demeanor.

It was Xiao Cha, Xiaoyaya's older brother, Xiao Cong's younger brother, and the vice governor of the atomic base.

With his black hair neatly styled, Xiao Cha stepped forward and smiled at Sophia. "Miss Wang, we met earlier. I trust you remember me?"

"Of course, Vice Governor Xiao," Sophia nodded. "What can I do for you?"

Xiao Cha glanced inside the car, his approach polite and unobtrusive, allowing him to see without being intrusive. But upon locking eyes with Z's dark gaze peeking from under his bangs, he suddenly sensed a strong hostility coming from him.

Xiao Cha hesitated for a moment before saying, "I’m here on behalf of my brother to invite you and Professor to dinner."

Before Sophia could respond, Z spoke up, his tone calm as he declined, "No need. We appreciate Vice Governor Xiao's kindness, but we have some matters to attend to and won't disturb you."

Sophia leaned back in her seat to give Z space. Z crossed his legs, casting a cool glance at Xiao Cha. Xiao Cha stared at him, slightly taken aback as he replied softly, "Alright. You two are esteemed guests. If you finish your business and are hungry, feel free to ask the base staff to prepare a midnight snack. I wish you success." He politely bowed before turning to leave, his confident stride and upright posture making him even more handsome.

Watching the unmasked admiration in Sophia's eyes, Z rolled his eyes and got out of the car. He walked over and said gruffly, "I have things to do," before striding away.

Sophia looked at his aloof figure and couldn’t help but exclaim, "That’s beyond being a typical narcissist, isn’t it? That’s full-blown prince syndrome."

Z's keen hearing caught her words. He had intended to handle Yi Ning alone, but now, with his mood slightly lifted, he turned back with an impassive expression, pulling Sophia down and dragging her into a secluded corridor.

His tone was calm, but the questions he fired at her made her flustered. "Did you just call me a narcissist?"

Sophia wanted to deny it quickly, but Z didn’t give her a chance to respond. He pressed on, "Have you ever seen such a lowly prince?"

Sophia was left speechless, feeling utterly helpless. She finally said bluntly, "What’s wrong with you? If there’s something I’ve done wrong, just tell me, and I’ll change. Can we not be so cryptic with each other?"

"Get along well? Of course, that’s fine," Z was about to voice his opinion when Sophia added hastily, "But let’s be clear first: our values and sense of right and wrong might differ, so let’s not try to change each other."

Z looked down at her, his expression tightening before he said in a low voice, "Good, then it’s settled."

Realizing she had misspoken again, Sophia felt a wave of despair wash over her. She felt like crying in frustration. Dating was definitely a brain-racking endeavor!

Z struggled to calm his own emotions, a myriad of thoughts racing through his mind. But he appeared composed, walking over to embrace her gently, patting her back soothingly.

Sophia froze in his embrace, feeling his warmth replace the previous hostility. Then... everything else seemed to fade away.

Z was a walking contradiction. Sometimes, he seemed emotionally inept, while at other times, he exhibited a level of emotional intelligence that was surprisingly high.

But what was really going on inside him? What did Z really think?

In this moment, he held Sophia, a radiant smile on his face. At the corridor’s end, he caught a glimpse of Xiao Cha and Miyazaki Yusuke hastily leaving, looking quite apologetic for having interrupted them.

Z smiled as serenely as the gentle spring rain of Jiangnan, effortlessly wrapping Sophia around him. She clung to his waist, blissfully unaware that he had just eliminated two potential rivals in his eyes.

In his mind, Z kept a list of names—everyone who needed to be dealt with, whether they had provoked him or Sophia. One by one, he would eliminate those on the list, just as he had done with the researchers back then.

He was indeed a ruthless person, and that was his nature. If his depth could be likened to a place, then someone like Miyazaki Yusuke could be seen as a well, while Z's heart could contain at least two Forbidden Cities.
