Yusuke Miyazaki stood with a furrowed brow, anxiously watching the two men who seemed on the verge of a fight. He couldn't help but think that if it came to blows, he would be in a difficult position. His father had sent him to protect Yining, who was aligned with Ouyang, yet Professor Z was a significant benefactor to him. What a dilemma! "So please, no fighting," he thought. "Violence might feel good for a moment, but it leads to disaster... No, violence is temporary, but love is eternal! This world should be about love, not violence!"

“Um, actually, we can get going now!” Yusuke boldly tried to change the subject.

Suddenly, both Z and Ouyang turned their attention to him. Ouyang, clearly eager to seize the distraction, maintained his arrogant demeanor but was willing to cooperate, while Z’s gaze shifted, revealing a deadly intensity that made Yusuke's heart race.

Feeling a bit lost, Yusuke instinctively took a step back, forcing a chuckle, “I mean, no need to mind me, you can carry on…”

“That’s right,” Z replied with a look that suggested he was impressed, “not interfering is the fundamental principle of how people should interact.” With that, he immediately turned back to Ouyang, “Remember, this is the last time. If we have any more unpleasantness, I’ll make sure to end you.” He showed no fear of anyone questioning his identity as he emphasized, “This is not a threat.” Then he turned and got into the car.

Sophia Wang glanced at the dumbfounded Ouyang and, with an indifferent expression, helped Xiaoyaya into the backseat before sitting down herself.

She closed the door and looked up to find Z, one hand on the steering wheel, turning to face her.

“What’s wrong?” she asked, puzzled.

Z was momentarily caught off guard; expressing gratitude felt almost as daunting as confessing love. He wanted to calmly tell her how much he appreciated her support, knowing she would be pleased to hear it, but no matter how much he tried to muster the words, he just couldn't. It wasn't about pride or anything like that; it was simply because he had always faced everything alone—no parents, no friends. He had never experienced this type of interaction, and it left him feeling confused.

All of his words ultimately got swallowed back, as if saying them would bring tears to his eyes. The feelings echoed in his heart, playing on repeat, yet they remained unvoiced.

“Nothing,” Z finally said, turning back to drive with a blank expression.

Sophia studied him thoughtfully, while Xiaoyaya, sitting beside her, observed their interaction with wide, curious eyes, clearly intrigued by the tension.

After a moment, as they continued down the road, Z suddenly turned to Sophia and quickly said, “Thank you for defending me,” before turning back to focus on the road. The whole exchange lasted less than three seconds, and by the time Sophia processed what he had said, he had returned to his usual demeanor.

Xiaoyaya, ever the gossip, stared at Sophia with an unabashed expression despite the tape covering her mouth. Z noticed this through the rearview mirror and narrowed his eyes, pressing a button that caused a metal cage to rise around Xiaoyaya's seat.

Xiaoyaya looked shocked as the cage enclosed her, her eyes welling with tears, as if she might cry. Z showed no mercy; after raising the cage, he stopped the car and turned to Sophia, saying, “Come sit next to me.”

Still lost in thought about Z’s sudden gratitude, Sophia obediently got out and moved to the passenger seat. Once she settled in, she gradually regained her composure and cast a more scrutinizing glance at Z.

Z deliberately ignored her probing gaze as he drove into a perilous area. “We’ve entered the atomic base’s territory. It’s very dangerous here—stay alert,” he said, using this as a way to divert her attention away from him.

As soon as Sophia heard this, she became serious, nodding earnestly. She checked the gun tucked in her holster and fastened all the buttons on her protective shirt, her nerves heightened as she scanned the surroundings outside the vehicle.

Z was telling the truth; they were definitely in a dangerous area. However, as long as they remained in the car, the chances of something going wrong were low. He had confidence in his abilities.

“Miss Xiaoyaya,” Z said casually while driving, “please guide me.”

Xiaoyaya stared at Z’s calm reflection in the rearview mirror, seemingly debating whether to tell the truth.

Z continued unhurriedly, “You can give me incorrect directions if you want; after all, if something happens to us, you won’t be safe either.”

Xiaoyaya frowned, as if suddenly realizing something, and quickly pointed to the tape on her mouth.

Z rejected her idea. “Your voice is too loud. Just point.”

“…” A small frown appeared on Xiaoyaya's forehead, and she awkwardly pointed left.

Z followed her direction, but since she had been out of the atomic base for a while, her understanding of the area was limited. When she made her escape, the base was busy changing the main gate, and she only remembered a general direction, unsure if it was truly safe or if any construction had even been completed.

As Z drove, leading the green pickup truck carrying Yining and others, the surroundings became increasingly sparse, trees thinning out. As darkness fell, they entered a vast open area that looked like an airfield, with two old planes parked not far away.

Upon seeing the planes, Xiaoyaya suddenly erupted into noise, which irritated Z to no end, prompting him to ask Sophia to remove the tape from her mouth.

As soon as the tape was ripped off, Xiaoyaya shouted, “Stop the car!”

“What’s wrong?” Sophia asked.

Breathlessly, Xiaoyaya replied, “My second brother is here!”

“Second brother?” The leader of the atomic base was Xiao Cong, who had two sisters and a brother. Aside from Xiaoyaya, the others were half-siblings. His father had died from the H+ virus, and none of his mothers had survived either. The second brother, therefore, was Xiao Cha.

“Yeah!” Xiaoyaya said rapidly, “You’ve brought me back; my brother will definitely thank you guys. Don’t be scared—just go down and find him! He’s right in that plane over there.” She pointed to a relatively newer white aircraft not far away.

Z tapped his fingers on the steering wheel, contemplating whether to believe her. Fearing he wouldn’t, Xiaoyaya added, “Really, if you don’t trust me, just go check it out! You can keep me locked up here!”

Z scoffed, “Now that sounds ideal. You can stay safe here while we face disaster.”

“…” Xiaoyaya fell silent, her face flushing as she turned away in embarrassment.

Z frowned slightly, realizing that she might have been telling the truth. Was he really being outsmarted here? He was torn between being annoyed and relieved.

While Z and Sophia remained cautious about Xiaoyaya’s potential trick, those following behind had gotten out of their vehicle due to the stop, leisurely walking over to the luxury car and tapping on the window.

“Open the door! Why are we stopping? Are we there?” Ouyang knocked on Sophia's side of the window, while Yining stood by Z's side, with Yusuke instinctively following her.

Sophia coldly regarded Ouyang’s unpleasant face outside the window, ignoring him completely, sitting rigidly in the passenger seat as if she hadn’t heard anything.

Z rolled down the window, addressing Yusuke, “Get back in the car and keep driving. We’re not there yet.”

Yining, feeling a bit embarrassed by his cold dismissal, volunteered, “I can sit in the back and keep an eye on her.” She gestured toward Xiaoyaya.

Xiaoyaya, puzzled, exclaimed, “Who asked you to watch me? Hey, Brother Bai, I’m not lying anymore! I’ll be good, okay? Just keep her away from me!”

“…” Brother Bai? Sophia was taken aback by Xiaoyaya's nickname for Z, fighting back a laugh as she glanced at him. Z’s face hardened, and he closed the window, gritting his teeth, “Please call me Professor.”

“Brother Bai sounds more friendly. My brother said it’s definitely appropriate to call a man like that,” Xiaoyaya remained undeterred.

Z pointed a gun at her head, his handsome face darkening, “Say that again.”

“I’m sorry…” Xiaoyaya squeaked, stepping back in terror, “I-I won't do it again! I swear!”

Z expressionlessly retracted the gun, casting an awkward glance at Sophia, who was trying to suppress a smile. Her beautiful eyes sparkled, and he felt torn between embarrassment and joy.

He sighed and restarted the car, but suddenly, the previously still plane began to shake violently before tipping forward completely.
