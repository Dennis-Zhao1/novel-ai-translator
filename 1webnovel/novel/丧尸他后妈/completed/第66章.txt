Z leaned back in his chair, covering his face in silence. Sophia Wang lay on the bed with her legs crossed, looking at him with concern. “Do you need a cigarette?” 

Z lowered his hands and looked at her, his dark eyes piercing through her, making her feel a bit uneasy. Why was he looking at her like that, as if she had done something wrong? She hadn’t done anything! (╯‵□′)╯︵┻━┻

“If you don’t like smoking, just say so! Don’t give me that look; I can’t read your mind.” Sophia coughed lightly, slipped on her shoes, and got out of bed, shuffling closer to him. “You seemed to enjoy yourself, so why do you look like someone’s about to eat you alive?”

“Enough, just shut up.” Z stood up and turned to walk away. “I have things to do.”

Sophia watched his back and asked, “What are you going to do? Can I help?”

“Do you really want to help?” Z turned back, his expression unreadable.

“Of course,” Sophia nodded. “Just tell me what you need me to do.”

Z pointed at the bed. “I need you to stay quiet and sit there without moving.”

“…” Sophia stared at him, confused. He smirked slightly, a mysterious smile on his lips, and walked into a small room.

Glancing between the bed and the closed door, Sophia thought to herself, she was a woman; it wouldn’t be too much to change her mind. So, she tiptoed her way to the door, quietly grasped the doorknob, and gently twisted it…

Crap, it’s locked!!

“Hey, darling, can you open the door?” Sophia whispered, testing her luck, but there was no response. Was he trying to do something reckless again? No, she had to keep an eye on him. “Open the door.” She knocked lightly.

Still no response.

“Are you going to open it or not?”

“…”

“If you can get under the sheets, you should be able to open the door!”

“…”

“Don’t hide in there and stay silent; I know you’re home!”

“…”

“Z!”

“Enough, come in.”

The moment Sophia finished those last three words, Z finally opened the door. He wasn’t wearing his glasses or a lab coat, just a shirt and slacks, standing tall in the doorway, looking down at her. The height difference made her expression shift from one of confrontation to casual as she squeezed past him through the gap, sneaking in an affectionate pinch at his waist.

“…” Z looked down at her hand, then turned away, casually closing the door. He regarded her with an amused expression and said, “Since you’re so eager, it would be a bit cruel of me to refuse.”

Sophia shivered slightly as a cold breeze swept through the room. “Uh…”

“Come sit here.” Z took a few long strides to a computer, tapping the keyboard until the black screen transformed into a simulation image, dividing into several small sections with different virtual figures. Curiously, Sophia leaned closer and asked, “What is this?”

Z grinned deviously. “It’s a gaming console. You know how to play games, right? If not, I can teach you.”

“… You want my help to play games?” Sophia brushed his hand away incredulously.

Z pulled the chair back, gently pushing her down into it. “This isn’t just any game; you’ll understand once you finish.” He moved the mouse and pointed at a box. “Click on it, double-click, and the figure inside will come out.” He moved to the next row. “You can do this for each box, but be careful—these figures only go out, they don’t come back.”

Sophia froze for a moment, softly saying, “This isn’t just a game, is it?”

Z, who had been bent over the computer, glanced at her with a look of approval. “You’re getting smarter; I was worried that our future kids might inherit your less-than-brilliant genes.”

Sophia’s lips twitched in annoyance. “That’s where you’re wrong; the ones that make it are the super elites among millions of sperm.”

Z shot back immediately, “Then how did someone as foolish as you survive?”

“…”

“How did you manage to live this long?”

“…”

“Alright.” Just as Sophia was about to lose her composure, Z decided to change the subject. He made room for her and instructed, “You should know what these systems are; think of it as playing a game. Some people must be dealt with, and if you enjoy having people around, then I need to choose the ones who will appear before you.”

Sophia nodded. “And what about you? What are you planning to do?”

Z didn’t answer directly but continued, “When you open a box, the image will change along with the figures. You can choose more, but you can’t choose to stop. Are you really sure about this?”

“If I weren’t sure, I wouldn’t be sitting here.” Sophia leaned back in the chair, looking up at him. Her delicate chin pointed towards him, softly tinted lips glistening like ripe peaches, tempting and delicious. Z looked down at her, his throat moving slightly, then he turned his head away.

“Hmm?” Sophia voiced her confusion.

“If you don’t feel guilty about this, then you can start. Of course, it’s divided into regions, so you can choose who you want to deal with. Once you finish, I should…” he paused, leaving the sentence hanging, his thin lips pressed together as if deep in thought.

Sophia continued his thought, “Then you should have found a way to resolve your own physical issues.”

Z glanced up at her, an unreadable look in his eyes.

Sophia didn’t meet his gaze, focusing on the computer system. “Conscience and malice are human instincts; everyone can sense them, but that doesn’t mean they have to act on them.”

Everyone has the right to sympathize and save others, but it doesn’t mean they will, nor should they broadcast it everywhere. It’s not just harmful to oneself but also to others. It’s like knowing someone pitiful; you sympathize with them, but instead of keeping that to yourself, you go around spreading their shortcomings, saying, “Oh, that person is so poor, it’s pathetic!” That wouldn’t win you any friends; it would just alienate you. It’s better to be a little selfish, giving up something without violating your principles. There’s nothing wrong with that.

“Very good,” Z nodded, a neutral expression on his face. “If you meet my expectations, I’ll do what you want.”

Sophia’s interest piqued, and she turned to him, smiling. “Including finding a safe place to settle down and live happily ever after?”

She expected Z to scoff and ridicule her, but instead, he nodded straight away. “Including that.”

“…” Sophia’s mouth dropped open in surprise. “Does that also include creating a vaccine to neutralize the H+ virus?”

“That thing doesn’t even exist,” Z smirked. “You see it all the time, but you ignore it.”

“… No way?” Sophia jumped up in excitement, grabbing his hand. “Really?”

Z calmly pulled his hand away, leisurely walking to the other side to sit down, picking up a slide under the microscope with an unfazed expression. He spoke in a relaxed tone, “I’m not telling you.”

… This has to be revenge! It must be revenge for her earlier comment about not feeding him!

Sophia wasn’t angry; his words confirmed it did exist. Of course, Z, who loved challenges, wouldn’t create a virus without also making an antidote. That was a challenge too; for such a perfect person, there was no one comparable. Challenging himself must be a great source of enjoyment.

With a heart full of anticipation for the future, Sophia immersed herself in the work Z assigned her. Z quietly listened to the sounds of her clicking the mouse, occasionally glancing at her. She was slender, tall, yet somehow felt small beside him.

This small woman was now doing something she once despised and even resented. One “I’ve thought about it for a long time” had nailed her to the same pole of scorn and hatred as him, with no way to turn back. But she seemed unfazed by it all.

She listened intently when he had something to say, yet he found himself forgetting some of his own words, while she remembered them all. He thought he was her savior, but in the end, he realized she was his last supper, the condemned man’s final meal.
