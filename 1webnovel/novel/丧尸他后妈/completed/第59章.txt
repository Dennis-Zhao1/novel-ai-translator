What exactly is a freak? It certainly shouldn't be like this.

Sophia Wang noticed that Z was becoming more and more like a normal person. Could it be because he was spending more time with her? It seemed that if he interacted with more people, he might become even more normal. Of course, that assumed those "people" were actually human. As for those who couldn't be called human—sorry, but no.

Feeling deeply touched, Sophia said, "Even though it feels like an unbelievable compliment, it's really remarkable that you can say this. What do I need to do to make sure you follow through on it? This is just too embarrassing!"

Z remained silent, slowly turning his gaze to the scenery outside the car. His narrow eyes behind the rimless glasses were slightly squinted, revealing no hint of emotion.

Sophia found herself following him back to the atomic base in a daze, only to discover that the Xiao family was no longer there. Most of the residents seemed to be alive, as it appeared that the zombies had not harmed the ordinary residents after chasing Yi Ning and the others away that day. Most of the soldiers at the base were still there too, including the guards, whom she recognized even if she didn’t know their names.

Sophia’s gaze towards Z was somewhat complex. He seemed to be with her all the time, yet there were many things she had never seen him handle, though he had already finished them. It was all so strange, as if her day lasted 24 hours while his stretched to 48.

At first glance, it seemed scientifically impossible, but upon closer reflection, it almost made sense…

Sophia had never been one to dig too deep into things; if she could avoid thinking about it, she would. So, this “trivial” matter didn’t bother her. As long as he was okay, and they were okay, everything would be just fine.

In the middle of the night at the atomic base, after a long, tempestuous struggle, the sky finally burst into a heavy rain. Sophia, who was already restless, found it even harder to sleep now.

She glanced at the little lamp on her bedside and then at the bright light filtering through the gap in the door before she got up and walked outside.

This time, she had learned her lesson. Before opening the door, she knocked softly. Upon hearing the sound, Z turned his head, removed his glasses, rubbed his eyes, and asked flatly, “Can’t sleep?”

Sophia nodded as she walked toward him. “You can’t keep doing this. Your body hasn’t fully healed yet; you need to rest.”

“There’s not much time left.” Z began typing on the computer again, the black screen filled with lines and letters that Sophia couldn’t make sense of. His tone and words reminded her of Zhang Qiling, causing her mouth to twitch slightly.

“There’s plenty of time, as long as we’re both alive and well.” She reached out and closed the laptop, firmly pulling him up from the chair. Despite the height difference that made her feel a little uneasy as she led him forward, she trusted that he wouldn’t actually harm her, so she felt quite at ease.

For some reason, she just knew they wouldn’t part ways. Even if they did, it would be out of necessity. Just recalling the last time he had insisted she leave, followed by his words, “Don’t look for me, and don’t fall for anyone else,” made her smile. How could he not want her to find him if he was telling her not to like anyone else?

Thinking of this made Sophia chuckle. In a good mood, she pushed Z onto the soft bed and snuggled into his arms. “This place is so comfortable. Let’s just stay here, okay? We move around too much, and it doesn’t feel like home.”

“This isn’t our home.” Z loosened his tie and stared at the ceiling. “The only place I’d call home is probably Lab No. 2.”

“Lab No. 2?” she asked, intrigued.

“It’s the one with the quantum stuff.”

“What about Lab No. 1? What are Labs 3, 4, and 5?” Sophia looked up at him with curiosity.

Z quickly changed the topic. “Wait a minute; I’ll go get something.” He gently moved her head off his shoulder. Though she was reluctant, she didn’t stop him. Seeing her reaction, his expression grew complicated as he silently got up to fetch something.

He was gone for only a minute or two before returning with a bottle of something unknown.

Z lay back down beside her, having removed his shoes and shirt. His bare torso revealed a toned abdomen, making Sophia’s heart race as she swallowed hard.

“Drink this; it’ll help you get better,” he said, handing her the bottle. Sophia obediently took it and drank, smacking her lips afterward. “Not bad, it tastes fruity!”

“It’s blueberry,” Z replied in a deep voice. “The blueberry crop in Lab No. 2 just came in; it was delivered a moment ago.”

“A moment ago?” Sophia’s mouth formed an O shape. “Do you really have wings? You went that far and…”

“It’s a mech.” Z averted his gaze, rubbing his temples. “Without a passenger, it can travel several times faster than you can imagine.” Since she wouldn’t understand the specifics anyway, he opted for a more straightforward explanation.

Sophia had actually said that on purpose, but now it seemed he genuinely thought she was clueless. Feeling a bit embarrassed, she rubbed her nose.

Z lowered his gaze, helping her unbutton her shirt while listening to the sound of rain outside. He unexpectedly said, “You can’t just let yourself get dumber, you know. What if I abandon you?”

Sophia instinctively replied, “You wouldn’t do that.”

Z looked at her in surprise, a sarcastic smile tugging at his lips, though it was unclear toward whom it was directed. “That’s not guaranteed.” He paused and then quietly asked, “If I really did abandon you, what would you do?”

“I…” Sophia opened her mouth, unsure of how to respond as she looked at his face. Seeing her hesitation, Z continued, “Please don’t fall apart when I’m gone. You need to live brilliantly, safely, and happily, so that when I encounter you again, I’ll regret everything I did to let you go, instead of thinking, ‘Thank goodness I abandoned her.’ A proud woman must never slack off.”

Sophia looked at him with confusion. “Why do I feel like you’re giving me a last farewell?”

“…” Z’s eyes twitched as if he were guilty of something. He quickly averted his gaze and denied, “Just because I’m acting normal doesn’t mean I’m about to kick the bucket, okay?”

…Of course, she would say yes, but she realized she had made the wrong choice. She should have said no!!!

Z disappeared.

On the third day of Sophia living at the atomic base with him, he was gone, leaving only the pocket watch he always carried.

Frustrated, she opened it to find a folded piece of white paper inside. Pressing down her rising anxiety as she searched the entire base for him, she patiently unfolded the paper. On it was nothing but a mathematical formula.

r=a(1-sinθ)??? What does this mean??? 

Sophia was absolutely terrible at math. Forget advanced math; she had barely scraped an 80 in middle school math, and she still remembered how stunned she and her friends had been when they couldn’t understand how someone could fill out two full pages of problems and only get an 80.

Now, Sophia regretted not studying math properly back then.

Frustrated, she clutched the pocket watch and the paper as she stepped out into the yard, shouting, “Optimus Prime, get out here!”

Just as her words fell, Optimus Prime appeared in front of her like a gust of wind, his towering figure trampling over several facilities. Sophia didn’t care about that; she asked bluntly, “Where’s your dad?”

“…I don’t know.”

“I mean, your master. Your owner.” Sophia rephrased, thinking it might not understand.

Optimus Prime’s robotic face seemed to twist in confusion. It replied stiffly, “I’m sorry, ma’am, but my database has changed. Now, you are my master.”

“…” What the heck! “So that brat really ran away?” Sophia squinted, her grip tightening on the paper. Regaining her focus, she said, “Then get me some books on math, preferably starting from middle school math.”

“…Okay.”

“Is that difficult?” she asked, noticing it was still.

“It’s not difficult; I can help you solve the formula on the paper.”

“…Thanks, I suppose.”

“That’s what I should do.”

Soon enough, Sophia received the answer to the formula.

It was a graph on a Cartesian coordinate system, and the answer formed a heart curve, known as a cardioid.

Optimus Prime explained in a very caretaker-like manner, “This formula comes from the French mathematician Descartes, who was the first to create coordinates. Unfortunately…”

“I know this story,” Sophia said, covering her forehead. “I just felt overwhelmed by the numbers at first and didn’t think of that.” When it came to love stories, she was the best at them, but writing that kind of thing under those circumstances felt…

Speaking of the formula, it was indeed a tragic love story.

Descartes was a mathematician, as Optimus Prime mentioned, and he was the first to create coordinates. During the Black Death in France, he went to Sweden and became the math tutor of a beautiful Swedish princess while begging for food.

The two fell in love, yet the king separated them, forcing Descartes to return to France. Not long after, he died from the Black Death. All the letters he wrote to the princess were intercepted by the king except for the last one, which contained no declarations of love, only the mathematical formula r=a(1-sinθ).

The beautiful princess sought out every scientist in the city to solve the problem, ultimately producing the famous heart curve graph.

This was their secret mathematical formula, but by the time the princess inherited the throne and had the means to be with him, Descartes was already dead.

The hardest distance to bear in life is that between life and death, even love cannot withstand it.

Sophia folded the paper and placed it back in the pocket watch, hanging it around her neck. She appeared unnaturally calm.

Optimus Prime, sensing something was off, cautiously asked, “Ma’am, are you okay?”

Sophia looked at him with a meaningful gaze. She stared into his electronic eyes and spoke deliberately, “He’s gone, huh? Good. Then however he left, I’ll find a way to bring him back.”

Optimus Prime paused momentarily, as if he had lost power. Sophia let out a cold laugh and turned her gaze to the person approaching her from the side— the current head of the atomic base.

“But before that, let’s let you run wild for a bit. It seems like there’s trouble brewing here.” She clapped her hands and looked ahead with a calm expression, showing no sign of sadness from Z’s departure.

Yes, she wasn’t sad at all; she was just a bit angry. Her life felt like a rollercoaster. Z was like her wishing tree, from whom she could ask for many wishes. But after being with him for so long, it seemed that every time she sincerely hoped for something, it would go in the opposite direction!

For instance, when she initially wished he would stay away, he clung to her. Now that she wanted him to stay by her side forever, he had left on his own. It was truly infuriating.

“Do you think I’m pathetic?” Sophia asked Optimus Prime, who was standing by like a statue.

Optimus Prime glanced at the approaching person and slowly replied, “No, ma’am. You’re not pathetic at all.”

“Exactly.” Sophia gritted her teeth and smiled at the person in front of her, no longer speaking to Optimus Prime. But in her heart, she thought, Zhang Dazhi, you just keep acting up! If I find you and don’t make you impotent or prematurely age, I’d be doing a disservice to Marxism-Leninism!
