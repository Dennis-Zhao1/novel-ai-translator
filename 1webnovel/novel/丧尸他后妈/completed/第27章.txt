"What's wrong with her?" Sophia Wang asked hesitantly.

"Just a moment," Z said, crouching down beside Yi Ning. He pulled out a small bottle of medicine from his white lab coat pocket, twisted off the cap, and took out two capsules. With two fingers, he pried Yi Ning's mouth open and tossed the capsules inside, then pushed her jaw up, helping her swallow.

Three seconds later, Yi Ning jolted awake, her eyes blinking in confusion, still looking a bit dazed.

"Is she not back to normal yet?" Sophia crouched down next to Z, both of them studying Yi Ning like paleontologists inspecting dinosaur fossils.

Z elongated his tone, a sharp glint in his eye as he stated, "Trust me, every decision I make is the right one."

"...The first part I can agree with, but the second part? Hmm, I reserve my opinion," Sophia thought to herself with a hint of skepticism.

Under Sophia’s doubtful gaze, Z demonstrated his confidence once more. Just like he had done with Yi Ning before, he activated his wristwatch again. This time, the light was a vivid red, contrasting with the soft blue from earlier. As Yi Ning was illuminated by the red beam, her pupils quickly constricted. Z immediately pulled Sophia back several meters, adopting an air of detachment.

Yi Ning shifted slightly, seeming a bit disoriented. She sat up with a pained expression, clutching her shoulder, her brow furrowed as if she couldn't comprehend why her shoulder hurt so badly despite showing no wounds or blood.

Feeling guilty at the sight, Sophia averted her gaze.

"You two are here too?" Yi Ning noticed Z and Sophia standing by and instantly resumed her usual radiant demeanor. Even in this unfavorable situation, she didn’t appear flustered; her beautiful features sparkled under the decent sunlight.

Sophia couldn’t help but admire her. Truly, as the heroine of this story, she had an effortlessly stunning appearance. Those enchanting peach blossom eyes seemed to look right into you, brimming with unspoken affection. Whoever was caught in that gaze would easily find themselves earning at least four plus points—only someone of Z’s caliber could withstand such charm. 

But then again, if Z didn’t even like someone like Yi Ning, why did he pay her any special attention?

Sophia instinctively glanced at Z. He was casually brushing off Yi Ning's questions, giving her a few quick replies before leading her back to their temporary rest point. They hopped into their vehicle, ready to continue their journey.

They still had a day’s drive to the atomic base. If they started now, they could reach a town before nightfall, where they could gather some food supplies and rest, setting off again at dawn.

Sophia was preoccupied with her thoughts, and the ride fell into a quiet lull. Z, aware she might be hungry, had set aside some food for her, which was something the person following them in the green pickup truck desperately needed. They hadn’t packed enough food, having underestimated how long their trip would take and the dangers that lay ahead at the atomic base. The supplies meant for five people weighed them down considerably.

Sophia felt a headache coming on, feeling frustrated with her own inability to directly address her awkwardness. She had been wrestling with her thoughts throughout the ride, while Z remained focused on driving and navigating. He noticed her discomfort but didn’t worry too much, reassured by the fact that as long as it wasn’t his fault, he could solve any problem.

It seemed that Sophia had exerted herself mentally, as she gradually drifted off to sleep, her head tilting toward the window. Every now and then, her forehead bumped against the glass, causing Z, who was intently driving, to be momentarily distracted. With a sigh, he set down the navigation device, gently pulled her into his arms, and used one hand to steer while awkwardly connecting the navigation cables, activating the autopilot feature.

He had always avoided using this feature in front of her, fearing that if she ever attempted to escape, it would give her an unfair advantage. It was easy for someone who was directionally challenged to run away, but once she knew of this function, the difficulty level would increase significantly. Moreover, he suspected her already wavering heart would become even more restless. Therefore, he was determined not to reveal it.

Z guided her through the drive, arriving at a town less than a hundred kilometers from the molecular base as dusk fell. He parked the vehicle, deactivating the autopilot mode. The slight movement startled Sophia awake from her near-sleep.

"Did I wake you?" Z asked, glancing at her while holding onto the navigation device.

Sophia remained nestled against him, her eyes quietly studying his calm demeanor as he seemed unbothered by her presence, almost enjoying it.

"You have serious dark circles under your eyes; you should rest well tonight," she finally managed to say, reluctantly pulling away as she opened the car door.

Z watched her retreating figure, his brows knitting together in thought. Suddenly, his eyes lit up with a peculiar realization.

Stepping out of the car, Sophia spotted Yi Ning and the others walking towards her. Yuuki Miyazaki was in the lead, flashing a smile and nodding at her. "Miss Wang."

"Please just call me Sophia Wang," she replied, rubbing her eyes and stifling a yawn.

Noticing Sophia’s groggy demeanor, Yi Ning felt a wave of jealousy wash over her as she recalled her own irritation at being unable to rest due to Ouyang's constant nagging. She adjusted her hair, putting on her best face as she approached Z, clearly still unwilling to give up on him.

Z didn’t even spare her a glance, stating, "We’re 97.84 kilometers from the atomic base. At a hundred kilometers per hour, we can reach it in under an hour. Let’s take a short break; we’ll head out tomorrow morning. You all can do as you wish; Sophia and I will go ahead." He took Sophia's hand and led her away, showing no concern for any potential objections.

Sophia was pulled into an alley, winding through until they arrived at an old two-story building. The interior was dim and appeared somewhat eerie in the fading light. A withered peach tree stood in the yard, a swing set beside it swaying gently in the breeze, adding to the unsettling atmosphere.

"Please tell me we're not spending the night here..." Sophia pleaded, looking up at Z with wide eyes.

"We're resting here tonight," Z said bluntly.

"No way?" Sophia grimaced, "It looks really spooky."

"Places that appear dangerous are often the safest. It's like people; those who speak harshly often have softer hearts than they let on, while those who seem gentle may harbor true cruelty beneath their kind facade."

Sophia opened her mouth to respond but found herself speechless, trailing behind him into the dark building.

Inside, it wasn’t nearly as frightening as it appeared from the outside, but it was so dark that she could barely see. After just a few steps, she bumped into someone familiar. She instinctively wrapped her arms around his waist, feeling the narrowness of his waist and the broadness of his shoulders, which made him feel remarkably reliable. Her hands intertwined over his abdomen, and she could faintly sense the toned muscles beneath.

Z froze for a moment, his body stiffening before he relaxed, letting her hold him. After a brief hesitation, he asked, "Are you really that scared? We can go back to the car if you want. I spent some time here when I was younger; it’s changed a bit over the past twenty years."

"Twenty years is a long time; of course, it’s changed," Sophia said softly from behind him. "You were quite young then, right? Were you in...?" She hesitated to finish her thought, not wanting to mention the word "lab," knowing it might be a sensitive topic for him.

Z didn’t seem as fragile as she feared. He replied candidly, "Yes, but I was underground, just below us."

"Oh," Sophia said, glancing at the wooden floor beneath them. In the stillness of the dark room, she gathered her courage to voice a question that had been plaguing her throughout the journey. "Why are you so good to me?"

"...” Z was momentarily taken aback, caught off guard by her question. He quickly thought of various ways to respond, but each one felt inadequate.

Seeing him silent, Sophia continued, "You really shouldn’t be so nice to me. I’m particularly susceptible to being moved. If I end up liking you, it would be a disaster."

Z seized upon her words like a lifeline. Standing tall in the darkness, he wondered what expression she wore as she leaned against him. He slowly replied, "So, you really don’t want to like me?"

"That's not quite it," Sophia exhaled softly, "If I like you, I’ll like you. I won’t overthink the reasons I shouldn't. But... I can’t shake the feeling that liking you will lead to trouble." It seemed disconcerting to have feelings for someone like Z, but it appeared it was already too late—she might have already started to like him.

Z must have picked up on her unspoken words as he grasped her hands resting on his waist. Her fingers were mischievously toying with the buckle of his belt, causing his throat to tighten as he leaned closer, quickly saying, "Then just go ahead and like me."

Sophia froze, staring at him with wide eyes. "What did you say?"

“Everyone comes into this world alone and empty-handed. As long as the situation isn’t dire enough to cost you your life, it’s not as hard as you think," he replied to her earlier question.

Sophia pondered for a moment, then cautiously asked, "Do you believe in this kind of feeling? I mean, the kind between a man and a woman."

By all accounts, Z was precisely the type of person who seemed unlikely to like anyone. You could never imagine him developing feelings for someone; it seemed almost impossible.

Suddenly, Z turned to face her. She felt a surge of anxiety as she looked up at his face, but the darkness concealed his expression. She comforted herself, thinking he couldn’t see her either. Little did she know, Z's glasses weren’t ordinary, and even without them, his vision was far sharper than that of an average person.

Z clarified his stance, "I believe in love. I believe in it regardless of what others think. Otherwise, how would you explain it?" He gestured between them.

"Then..." Sophia started to say something but stumbled over her words. After a moment of hesitation, she boldly asked, "Do you like me?"

Z bit his lip slightly. Though his character made him reluctant to express such sentiments, he knew that denying it now would only worsen the situation. So, despite his awkwardness, he replied with a single word, "Yes."

Sophia was momentarily stunned. Although she had long suspected this, she had always chalked it up to her own vanity. Now, hearing it confirmed from his lips, she found herself momentarily speechless.

Indeed, those who seemed least likely to have feelings for anyone would often ignite a passionate fire once touched, vibrant and consuming to the point where nothing else mattered.

"But why me? There are so many girls prettier and better than I am; why do you like me instead?" Sophia murmured, torn between joy and sorrow, not truly expecting an answer to her dramatic question. Yet, to her surprise, Z responded.

It was only natural. Since the moment she met him, his every word and action had defied her expectations. Perhaps that was why she felt an increasing curiosity about him, a growing dependence, and a struggle to let go.

In a rather academic tone, he stated, "Because so many girls who are prettier than you simply can’t compare to you. So many girls who are better than you don’t hold a candle to your beauty."

Sophia gazed at him with wide eyes, her lovely irises sparkling in the dim light. Z raised his hand, brushing over her brow and cheek, before concluding with words that felt more like persuasion for himself than for her: "Look, your eyes are like springs filled with stars, reflecting only my image, still rippling with beautiful waves."

It was enough to bring her to the verge of tears. Sophia's lips twitched, and she swatted his hand away to wipe her eyes, feigning calmness as she said, "That’s terrible. Once we confirm this, freedom will be lost." Blushing, she stepped outside to catch some fresh air.

Z followed her out, smirking as he said, "Sophia Wang, you’re twenty-three this year, and you’re still dreaming of freedom? I can give you wings, but can you fly?" He warned her, "You might as well give up on that thought. I can give you everything, but freedom is off the table." His frustration with the very concept of "freedom" was palpable.

Sophia feigned shock, replying dramatically, "Then I take back what I just said! Let's revert to how things were before we stepped outside!"

Z pulled her over to the swing set, forcing her to sit before swiftly pushing her high up into the air. As he listened to her squeals of surprise, a wicked smile spread across his face, and he laughed heartily.

"You’re so terrible! This is pure revenge! You can’t stand even a hint of opposition!"

He caught Sophia as she swung towards him, stopping the swing from moving any further. Wrapping his arms around her neck, he leaned close to her ear and whispered ominously, "I won’t pretend to be understanding or accommodating. Right now, all I want to hear are those five words: 'Be with me.' If you think about it, that seems to be my only strong point. So, what will it be? Speak up."

He paused, as though he feared his tone wasn’t forceful enough, not shocking enough, so he lowered his voice further, almost to a whisper, adding, "Don’t think about tomorrow, and don’t consider forever."
