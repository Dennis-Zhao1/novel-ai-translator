Sophia Wang, looking surprisingly composed, stealthily followed Z into the residential area of the Atom, her mind fully focused on observing the layout. She pondered where Yining might be located when Z suddenly halted in his tracks.

“What’s wrong?” Sophia asked, her voice laced with curiosity. She glanced at a nearby square-shaped apartment building, speculating, “Could Yining be living there?”

Z scanned the apartment building up and down, casually nodding his head in response to her question. 

“Have they already arranged her room?” Sophia asked, a mix of curiosity and anxiety creeping into her tone. “You’ve been sleeping this whole time, so how do you know she’s staying here?”

“Because I placed a tracker in her luggage,” Z answered instinctively, only to realize the sourness in her voice after he spoke. He looked down at her to find her fuming, a stiff “Oh” escaping her lips.

Z couldn’t quite figure out why she was upset, so he pretended to be indifferent, pulling out his handheld computer to connect to the 3D recognition system and check the apartment for occupants. The answer was clear: nobody was inside, it was safe.

Sophia had seen this system before, and now that she knew the apartment was empty, her mind shifted away from that concern. Hesitantly, she asked, “When did you put the tracker in her suitcase?”

In that moment, Z realized the source of her annoyance—she was jealous. A brilliant idea sparked in his mind, and he felt a rush of excitement thinking about the outcome of this little game. Yet, his expression remained aloof, as he maintained the facade of a cool, detached prince. “Of course, it was done at the most opportune moment.”

He intentionally left his words vague, knowing that Sophia would misunderstand. And she did, as expected. Deep down, she was aware of Yining’s unspoken obsession with Z. Though the original plot never confirmed whether Z and Yining ended up together, it was evident that Yining had her sights set on him. Was it really possible for them to have this undeniable chemistry?

Sophia’s mind spiraled into a whirlwind of love, hate, and jealousy as she observed Z's conflicted expression—a mix of despair and sadness. With a resigned “Oh,” she turned and headed up the apartment steps. She opened the unlocked door, announcing, “I’m going in first,” before stepping inside.

Seeing that she seemed to genuinely believe him, Z felt a mix of satisfaction and urgency. He quickly followed her, restoring the door to its original state before hastening up the stairs after her.

Sophia was sharp; she only needed a glance at the recognition device to memorize the room where the tracker was located, which was now the place Yining was keeping her luggage.

Upon entering the room, she indeed found a dark gray suitcase quietly placed beside the bed. The room was tidy—while it lacked the meticulousness of a better time, it was clear that some effort had been put into it.

The Atom had taken good care of things, which made Sophia feel a bit irritated. Turning back to Z, who was still following her like a shadow, she frowned and asked, “What now?”

Z kindly explained the next steps, “We wait here until she returns, then we take action.”

“...Just like that?” She had expected him to have a more dramatic plan. This method of lingering at the crime scene was surprisingly... underwhelming.

Noticing her discomfort and disdain, Z stepped closer and gently ruffled her hair, his tone unexpectedly soft. “Jealous, are we?” He had a good sense of her feelings, but believed that taking direct action would be more effective, drawing her closer to him.

Yining had a new virus implanted within her, and while the experimental data had been automatically transmitted over the past few days, Z hadn’t had the time to review it. He couldn’t be sure which medication would avoid any adverse reactions. It was better to tread carefully.

Sophia felt her ears heat up at his question, and she bit her lip, retorting, “No way.” After saying that, she began searching for a hiding spot, finally pointing at the wardrobe directly facing the bed. “Let’s hide in there?”

Z frowned, clearly not pleased. Sophia continued, “Well, even if she comes back to sort through her clothes, that’ll be after she returns, right? We’re planning to strike as soon as she walks in!”

Z looked at her in surprise, seemingly taken aback. “I didn’t expect you to be so eager for her death.”

“...Well, um...” 

“When Ouyang died, you seemed quite saddened,” Z recalled the incident, discomfort flooding him as he spoke. “Of course, it makes sense, considering he was your childhood sweetheart. You’d naturally be upset for a while.”

Sophia’s eyebrows twitched in annoyance. “That’s not how it was at all! I never liked his used things. Have you ever seen anyone pick up someone else’s used condoms?”

After she said that, she caught Z laughing, and it dawned on her that he had been teasing her on purpose. Even though she knew he was just playing around, it hurt her heart a little, and she couldn’t help but feel a wave of sadness washing over her.

Z realized he had taken the joke too far, and he opened his arms, pulling her into a comforting embrace. “If you want to hide in the cabinet, then we’ll hide in the cabinet.” As if fearing she wouldn’t believe him, he swung open the wardrobe doors, moving the clothes aside, and stepped in with her, securely closing the door behind them.

In the confined space, alone together, the air seemed to thrum with tension.

Sophia leaned against Z, her head resting on his chest as he gazed down at the crown of her head, his dark eyes softened. “I won’t make jokes like this again.”

“It’s not your fault,” Sophia mumbled softly, burying her face in his embrace. “I was just being foolish, believing such an obvious lie. I’m not mad at you, just a bit annoyed with myself... Well, maybe I still dislike it.”

Z felt a profound sense of her concern for him, happiness swelling within him, yet he also felt the weight of her sadness. It was challenging to remain impassive while seeing her downcast.

He sighed, acknowledging that he shouldn’t use such tactics to scare her again. Just as he was about to say something or perhaps act in a way to mend things, there was a sudden knock on the door.

Both of them, almost forgetting their original purpose, snapped back to reality, going silent as they peered through the wardrobe's slats. They watched as Yining and the blurred figure of Gong Qizheng slowly entered the room, with Gong Qizheng leading the way and Yining close behind. As soon as Yining stepped inside, she leaned against the door, arms crossed, securing it tightly behind her.

“Hmm?” Gong Qizheng paused, surprised by the sight. “Miss Yi, what are you doing?” He quickly approached. “Now that you’ve safely arrived, I should take my leave.”

“Leaving?” Yining smiled, “Where are you going? Aren’t you here to protect me?”

Gong Qizheng’s expression stiffened. “I can stay next door, or downstairs. The Atom base is far more secure than the Molecular Guard. While it’s not entirely safe, it should be fine.”

“Is that so?” Yining appeared skeptical, her expression reflecting lingering fear. “But today... Ouyang’s death really upset me. I’m scared.” She threw herself into Gong Qizheng’s arms. “I’m worried that if I end up like that one day, would you... would you treat me the same way you did him today?”

Gong Qizheng pushed Yining away, his face flushed with embarrassment as he averted his gaze. “Miss Yi, please maintain your dignity. I, too, was saddened by Ouyang’s death, but it was unavoidable. His recklessness led to this outcome, and we all must accept that fact.” He paused, adding, “Moreover, Director Xiao has agreed to collaborate with the Molecules, and my father will soon bring support to the Atom. With him here, you can rest assured; he won’t mistreat his woman.” He spoke earnestly.

Yining’s expression turned a bit strange at his description of her, and after a moment of silence, she said, “Actually, you misunderstand, I don’t have...”

“It’s late. I’ll take my leave now. Miss Yi, you should remain discreet. I’ve overstayed my welcome,” Gong Qizheng interrupted her, stepping outside without giving her a second glance.

Yining stood rooted to the spot, her aura radiating anger as she watched him leave. She clenched her fists and slammed them on the bed, then threw herself under the covers, staring at the ceiling, lost in thought.

Sophia’s heart raced as she looked up at Z, who signaled for her to wait. Although confused, she sensed the tension and remained silent.

Before long, the room fell into silence, leaving Yining somewhat bored. Instead of tidying up her clothes, she stripped off her outerwear and T-shirt, lying on the bed in her underwear. She gently traced her beautiful figure, her eyes half-closed as if imagining something.

Sophia felt her face heat up. It seemed Yining had moved on from mourning Ouyang’s death; otherwise, why would she have such a conversation with Gong Qizheng? And what was she doing now? Surely, she wasn’t that desperate! There were still two people in the room! Just because she couldn’t see them didn’t mean they didn’t exist!

Sophia shot a distressed glance at Z, who was equally astonished, peering through the wardrobe’s gap at Yining’s provocative display. Enraged, Sophia pinched his waist hard, and Z winced, looking down at her.

Sophia shot him a warning glare, urging him to behave. Z opened his mouth, as if to say something, but ultimately thought better of it, falling silent.

Confused, Sophia gazed at him as he held up three fingers, signaling 3, 2, 1. Just as she pondered the meaning behind it, a knock sounded at the door again.

“Miss Yi, I’ve arrived,” a strange man’s voice called. Though unfamiliar, Sophia recognized it; she had seen him before... it was Xiao Cong!

Yining quickly sat up, wrapping herself in the blanket without bothering to put on her clothes. “Director Xiao, come in!”

Xiao Cong opened the door, and upon witnessing the scene, he was taken aback. His striking resemblance to Xiao Cha made him undeniably handsome, but his features carried a certain delicate yet unpredictable quality.

“Miss Yi, are you already in bed? It seems I’ve arrived late; I’ll be sure to come earlier next time.” He immediately turned to leave, but Yining dashed out, barefoot and without even bundling up the blanket.
