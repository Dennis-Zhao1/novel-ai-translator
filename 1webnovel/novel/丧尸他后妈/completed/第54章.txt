Yining stared in shock at Wang Jie and Gong Qizhi as they hurriedly left the path: “I never expected them to be like this!” she murmured, “Is this how comrades should treat each other?”

Sophia Wang looked coldly at her: “That’s because others have never regarded you as comrades, and neither have you.”

Yining shot a glare at Sophia, her eyes reddening: “Why? What gives you the right to have all this?” 

Indeed, all of this should have belonged to you. If it weren’t for Wang Baozi switching souls, and gaining the plot as an advantage, along with having such a significant edge like Z... But what’s done is done—what’s the point of saying this now?

Sophia ignored her; her mind was solely on the issue regarding Jie Anjun. After all, he had once been in the same laboratory as Z and had tampered with the controller inside Z’s body. She couldn’t ignore that.

At this moment, Jie Anjun had already figured everything out. His intelligence was well beyond question, so he didn’t need Z to state it explicitly—he knew he was doomed today.

However, some people would rather die than let you feel comfortable.

Jie Anjun’s expression suddenly twisted. He said something to Yining, whose face turned pale with fear, shaking her head in a desperate refusal.

He patted her hand, said nothing more, just conveyed his determination with his eyes. Yining hesitated for a moment before turning and running away in a direction different from where Wang Jie and Gong Qizhi had gone; her choice was distinctly unique.

To buy Yining some time, Jie Anjun stepped closer to Z, “I’ve already stolen enough time just by being alive today.” A wicked smile crept onto his face, “Since Xiao Yue has no hope left, living has no meaning for me.”

He moved closer to Z, who showed no signs of retreating, calmly awaiting him. In Z’s eyes, eliminating Jie Anjun was the top priority at the moment.

“I know you’ve always wanted to kill me. My existence is a blemish on you; you can’t accept that one of your subordinates has slipped through your fingers, and that this fish threatens your safety,” Jie Anjun mocked with a bitter smile. “Though you don’t say it, I know you’re afraid. You’re a freak, you know that, Z?”

He laughed—was it laughter or tears? “You want to see me in despair and pain, regretting why I fled; you want me to understand that only death can set me free.”

Z listened to him quietly, nodding, “You’re very smart; that’s the only thing about you I slightly care about. But your intelligence is quite limited.” He glanced at his watch. “It’s almost time; I still have to help Vice Governor Xiao with something, so goodbye.”

“No!” Jie Anjun shouted before Z could make a move, as if he had lost all his strength. He could barely stand, his throat constricted; something was moving inside—it was likely the controller.

His voice was distorted, “Do you really think I can’t hurt you? You’re too arrogant, Z.”

With a strange laugh, Jie Anjun collapsed to the ground, “The source of my suffering is you, and the source of your suffering will also be me. I’ve long guessed that with your skills, you’d be able to extract the controller, so…” He opened his mouth wide, blood trickling between his teeth. “Just wait; I will make you taste my pain today. One day, you will have to leave your loved ones behind, watching them die in front of you, or… you’ll have to kill your beloved with your own hands.”

He shifted his gaze to the utterly shocked Sophia Wang, implying, “Even if I die, as long as you’re alive for a second, I will make sure you won’t have it easy.”

These were likely Jie Anjun's last words. After uttering the final sound, he fell to the ground, lifeless.

His throat ruptured, something leaped out, bouncing a few times before settling at Z’s feet.

Z kicked the bloody controller aside with his shoe and turned to look in the direction of Sophia Wang and Xiao Cha: “How’s the show?”

Xiao Cha seemed indifferent to his question, turning away coldly, not uttering a word.

Sophia opened her mouth but couldn’t produce any sound; the previous scene had been too shocking. Only someone with Z’s psychological endurance could remain so calm...

Z said nothing further. He took a few steps forward, seemingly wanting to return to Sophia, but he stopped halfway, his brows furrowed tightly, a faint red glow blossoming in his dark eyes.

“Even if I die, as long as you’re alive for a second, I will make sure you won’t have it easy.”

Jie Anjun's dying words echoed in his ears. Z took a deep breath, striving to calm his wildly racing heart. But no matter what he did, it was futile; he felt as if his heart was about to explode, racing at an unbelievable speed, something dangerous was about to break free from within him.

Z stepped back, looking at Sophia with an expression of regret. He retreated at least ten meters before sighing.

At this moment, he felt extremely awkward, even more embarrassed than he had ever felt in his life. He realized that his physical condition had deteriorated to the point where he could no longer remain here. He couldn’t resolve this problem in a short time; staying here might lead him to do as Jie Anjun said and inadvertently kill Sophia. If that happened, everything would truly be irreparable, but...

Even so, he still wanted to stay, even if it meant hiding like a rat in a filthy gutter, peering through rusty pipes to watch her. He didn’t want to leave.

“Xiao Cha.” Z suddenly spoke, casting a quick glance at Sophia. “Take her away to a safe place. I will ensure your sister is returned to you unharmed, otherwise, you'll only be able to burn paper money for her every year at this time, if you’re still alive then.”

Xiao Cha was taken aback, frowning, “What do you mean by that?”

Z ignored him and swiftly told Sophia, who had sensed something was wrong, “Don’t come looking for me.” He turned away, the wind lifting the corner of his lab coat, and his figure rapidly disappeared into the dense foliage.

Sophia wanted to chase after him, but the silver mech that had been standing still suddenly moved, blocking her path and saying, “Please follow the gentleman’s orders, ma’am.”

“…” Sophia didn’t know how to describe her feelings at this moment. In short, she was incredibly… incredibly displeased!

“Get out of my way!” Sophia angrily sidestepped the mech’s obstruction and dashed into the woods. Not far ahead, there seemed to be sounds of fighting. She quickened her pace, finally arriving just in time to witness a scene that was utterly incomprehensible.

Z, Gong Qizhi, and Wang Jie stood in a circle together. Gong Qizhi was very close to Z, who looked in terrible shape—his eyes were bloodshot, and he held his gun tightly. Wang Jie had already been shot, half-collapsed on the ground, gasping heavily.

“Xiaoshu?!” Wang Jie exclaimed as if seeing a savior, “Quick, get this lunatic away!”

Xiao Cha had no choice but to follow Sophia after Z's earlier remark. Now, seeing that Sophia actually intended to approach Z, who was clearly not himself, he couldn't help but pull her back: “Take a good look at him; he’s not right. If you go up now, you’ll probably get shot dead.”

Gong Qizhi was struggling to confront Z. If he hadn’t seized the opportunity to grip Z’s wrist, they might have already been killed. Although he had only held Z for less than a minute, he was already reaching his limit.

Z’s hands were perfect for playing the piano, yet he could easily end all their lives.

Sophia felt like crying; seeing Z in such a state hurt her deeply. She bit her lip and pushed Xiao Cha away, “I know what I’m doing; don’t interfere.” Ignoring the obstruction, she stepped forward and said to Gong Qizhi, “Just hold him for one minute.”

Gong Qizhi looked at her in confusion, but she didn’t respond. She quickly approached to grab the gun from Z, then concentrated, striking the back of his neck with her hand, deliberately using her special ability. Z’s eyes flashed; he closed his eyes and ceased resisting.

Sophia quickly pulled him into her arms, stepping back to create distance from everyone, holding the gun coldly at them: “Leave alive, or die here. It’s your choice.”

Gong Qizhi stared at her in shock, seemingly struggling to accept such a rapid change. After pondering for a while, he glanced at her with a complicated expression before leaving on his own.

Xiao Cha frowned, “I won’t harm you, but I need to wait for him to wake up. I have to clarify Yayao’s situation before leaving.”

Sophia shot him a sidelong glance, dismissing him, then turned to Wang Jie: “And you?”

Wang Jie looked thoughtfully at Z before suddenly laughing, “Xiaoshu, do you think I’m your father for no reason?”

Sophia was somewhat puzzled, but the next second she understood his meaning. A large number of quantum soldiers ambushed from all sides, and she had no time to think; she quickly fired her gun, taking down the attackers one by one, her hands almost going numb from pulling the trigger.

“How many bullets do you have left?” Wang Jie clutched his shoulder wound, sneering, “Do you think you can resist so many of us?”

Sophia looked at him in confusion: “Are you really a father?”

Wang Jie paused, not yet reacting, when he saw Sophia directly discard her empty gun and single-handedly hold Z, taking down all the quantum soldiers trying to capture them in a way that was shockingly unfathomable. Thanks to Z, her powers were incredibly effective—swift, lethal, and invisible.

Wang Jie quickly made a judgment, shouting, “Leave no survivors, just kill them all!” After all, once they were dead, he could seal the laboratory and get what he wanted. As long as Z died, it would be enough... 

Unfortunately, Z was fated not to die. Although Wang Jie ordered to leave no survivors, it was already too late. His greed had cost him the best opportunity for victory. The silver mech developed by Z arrived effortlessly, wiping out the disorganized crowd and carrying Z and Sophia into the cockpit, transforming into an aircraft that swiftly took them into the sky, leaving the area behind.

Wang Jie hid in the grass, staring blankly at the flying machine, his expression heavy with both concern and desire.

If that thing obeyed him...
