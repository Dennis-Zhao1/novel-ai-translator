“Miss Yi is right…” Yusuke Miyazaki said, finally realizing something as he looked at Z with a face full of admiration. “Professor, with your vast knowledge, the poison in the water source might really be…”

“No.” Z cut him off sharply, his handsome face betraying no emotion. “I’m leaving here. I don’t have the time or energy for this, so it’s not going to happen.”

Leaving? There were four people present, and aside from Z, the other three fixed their gazes on him. Yet, he only looked at Sophia Wang, something complex flickering in his narrow eyes. It was a bit profound, and Sophia couldn’t quite grasp it.

“Can you all step aside for a moment? I need to speak to her alone.” Z didn’t expect Sophia to understand on her own, so he shooed away the reluctant Yi Ning and Yusuke Miyazaki, restoring their little world back to just the two of them.

As soon as they left, Sophia immediately asked, “You’re leaving? Does that mean you really did poison the water?” Her face was filled with unwillingness; once there was a problem with the water source, she would have to leave too. Even if Z wasn’t there, she might still run into him on the way, which was incredibly frustrating.

Z let out a dismissive laugh. “I wouldn’t need to see blood to kill them. Why would I poison anyone?”

“…” Sophia pressed her hand against her twitching mouth. “Sorry, I overthought it.”

“Doesn’t matter.” Z glanced at his watch, fastening the buttons of his lab coat. As he did, he kept his eyes lowered, speaking softly, “Just because I’m smiling and talking to you doesn’t mean I’m not angry. You might not realize it, but being around you feels like I’m being drained by a vampire. I’m just your mobile snack; you can bite whenever you’re hungry, until I’m completely drained dry, and then you look at me with disgust.” He paused for a moment, his long brows arching slightly, his expression darkening. “I guess you’re pretty sure you can find another one like me to take my place, so you don’t feel the need to be nervous about it.”

When he finished buttoning up, he finally met Sophia’s gaze. Seeing her furrowed brow and troubled expression made him hesitate, but he pressed on, determined to say what he needed to: “This time, I’m really leaving. If you’re not nervous, then fine. I won’t let you bite me again, and I don’t want you to worry anymore.” He sighed, putting on a cheerful facade. “I’m tired of you; I won’t be nice to you anymore. From now on, you’re just like everyone else in my eyes.” After saying that, he turned around decisively and walked away, leaving Sophia standing there, tears streaming down her face, unsure why his words made her feel so heartbroken.

Clearly… she should have been happy! This cold-blooded killer, this mad scientist who treated countless innocent lives as mere subjects in his experiments, was finally not haunting her anymore. She had escaped his grasp and could finally breathe and work towards her goal of living a safe life. So why did it hurt so much?

Sophia sniffled, forcing back her tears. After a moment of composure, she gathered Z’s suitcase and left the lab, heading towards the residence for the other subjects.

With her head down, she walked along listlessly until a pair of white high heels caught her attention. She looked up to find Yi Ning.

“He really left?” Yi Ning frowned and asked.

Sophia replied flatly, “I guess so. I’m not too sure about these things. If you want to know, it’s better to ask Mr. Miyazaki. He’ll definitely know if anyone’s left here.”

“The facility is on lockdown. Governor Miyazaki is trying to find out who poisoned the water. If he left through the front, there’s no way he could have gotten out.” Yi Ning stated confidently.

“Is that so?” Sophia pursed her lips, trying to walk past her, but Yi Ning grabbed her hand.

Yi Ning looked at her earnestly. “Are you still mad at me? Aren’t we good friends? I know I hurt you, but I promise I’ll never do it again. Will you forgive me just this once? Please?”

“…” To be honest, if Yi Ning wasn’t such a good actress, she might genuinely want to reconcile with Sophia. The sincerity in her eyes was evident, but unfortunately, Sophia had read the original text. Despite being unclear on some of the finer points, as “Wang Baozi,” she still found it hard to open up to Yi Ning. “I’m not angry with you,” Sophia maintained a sincere facade. “I’m just feeling a bit unwell and want to go rest for a while.”

“Oh?” Yi Ning raised an eyebrow, changing the subject, “Ouyang should be coming to pick you up soon.”

“He’s coming here?” Sophia frowned. “He didn’t come with you, so doesn’t that mean he doesn’t need to find me anymore?”

Yi Ning blinked innocently. “We got separated due to some danger on the way. You’re the daughter of the quantum family; he came out to find you. If he can’t find you, he can’t go back and report to Governor Wang. How could he not come looking for you?”

Sophia forced a smile. “Oh, I see. Thanks for the heads-up.”

“No problem, we’re good sisters, right?” Yi Ning took her hand and smiled. “I’ll keep my distance from Ouyang from now on, so don’t worry. I really won’t compete with you for him again. I promise I won’t make the same mistake twice.”

“Uh-huh.” Sophia smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. “You said we’re good sisters. I’ve come to terms with it. Since you two are truly in love, I should naturally support you. I’d much rather have two friends than hold onto a man who doesn’t love me.”

Yi Ning was momentarily taken aback, unsure of how to respond. Sophia immediately pulled her hand back and said her goodbyes, but Yi Ning chased after her once more. “Wait, Sophia.” She grasped Sophia’s wrist, hesitating before asking softly, “Do you know him well? That professor?”

“…”

“Do you know his name? Did he really leave? The front gate hasn’t let anyone out; where could he have gone?”

“…”

“Sophia?”

Sophia expressionlessly pulled her wrist back and stared into Yi Ning’s eyes, speaking each word deliberately. “I don’t know him at all. If you want to know anything, just ask Yusuke Miyazaki. My head hurts; I need to rest.” With that, she walked away, leaving no room for Yi Ning to continue her questioning.

Yi Ning watched her retreating figure thoughtfully, her long black hair cascading over her shoulders. Moments later, she turned and rushed back towards the lab.

Once back in her room, Sophia hid Z’s suitcase and began planning her escape from the facility. But every time she thought of leaving, Z’s image would swirl in her mind, making her dizzy and desperate to cry. Unable to hold back any longer, she let the tears flow. Sophia buried her face in the blankets on her bed, sobbing quietly, unaware of the soft sound of the door opening.

By the time she noticed someone had entered the room, that person was already sitting beside her.

“What are you doing here?” Sophia peered through her tear-stained eyes at the figure who was pulling the blanket away from her. Her voice was thick with emotion as she asked, “Aren’t you leaving?”

Z’s expression was icy, his indifference apparent. “I never said I was leaving today. I just said I was going to leave, not that I was leaving today.”

Sophia stared at him in confusion, as if he were speaking another language. After a moment of bewilderment, she finally understood, nodding slowly. Then, after a brief pause, she grabbed his arm and pinched it hard, her nails digging into his flesh. Yet, he didn’t flinch, his calm and sharp gaze fixed on her.

“You actually called me a vampire?” Sophia looked at him with an accusatory gaze. “And made me sound like a sanitary pad?” Her tone was complex. “You know, you’re way more pathetic than a vampire. At least vampires are cold-blooded. What about you? What do you have besides an empty shell?” She questioned, perplexed. “Why do you insist on doing this thankless research? Turning people into that, making the world so miserable, and living alone like this—what’s your goal?”

Z genuinely pondered her question for a moment. After a brief silence, he replied seriously, “I’m not bored enough to want to change a world that’s beyond saving. Instead, I’ve been creating my own world.”

“…What an impressive ideal.” You know that’s not cute in reality, right?

Z seemed to miss the underlying tone in Sophia’s words and smiled, his eyes softening. The cold mask he’d been maintaining fell away, revealing a genuine happiness as he allowed the suppressed joy—stemming from her tears over his departure—to surface. “Yeah, creating a new world where only the people I like can live. That’s probably what it feels like.”
