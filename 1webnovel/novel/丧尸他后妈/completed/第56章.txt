Though Z was reluctant, he had no choice but to follow Megatron's instructions and complete the final steps for the stasis agent in the control room. It was the most important task at hand, as failing to do so could lead to serious complications midway, especially since it had already taken quite some time.

When Sophia Wang saw Z walk into the control room with a dark expression, she noticed the bloodstains on his wrist, clearly visible beneath the metal watch he wore. The watch occasionally brushed against his skin, making her wince in sympathy, yet he seemed unfazed, his face expressionless as he sat down in the chair and began operating the equipment.

Feeling a bit apprehensive, Sophia timidly made her way over to him, gently tapping his shoulder. With sincerity in her voice, she asked, “Do you have a moment?”

“What’s up?” Z squinted at her, his tone laden with meaning. “Don’t rush. I won’t keep you waiting too long.”

Sophia was momentarily taken aback by his words, struggling to process what he meant. Seeing her dazed expression, Z assumed she was unhappy, and leaned down to kiss her softly on the lips. Instantly, Sophia straightened up, covering her mouth as she regained her composure...

He couldn’t possibly think she was eager to jump into bed with him, could he?! Wasn’t he capable of thinking about something serious?

Her lips twitched in annoyance as she directly took his hand and removed his watch. 

Z looked on, eyes wide, wanting to say something but faltering as he glanced at his wrist. In an instant, he understood her intention and swallowed the words he meant to say. 

Fine, even if it wasn’t just an ordinary watch, since she cared for him, he might as well let her wear it for a while. 

“Just remember to give it back when you’re done,” he said with a mock-seriousness.

Sophia had initially planned to tuck it into her pocket and return it to him once his wrist healed, but his comment prompted her to put the watch on her own wrist instead. “Oh, sure. Does it hold any sentimental value? You seem quite attached to it, always wearing it even in the shower or bed.”

Without turning around, Z replied to her question while focusing on the computer, “It’s on the internal network, my own network.”

Sophia stared at the steaming black coffee in his hand, her curiosity piqued. “Where did that come from? It wasn’t here just a moment ago!”

Z shot her a sidelong glance, his tone casual as he explained, “It’s programmed in. If I come in, it prepares it for me.”

“It? Oh, you mean Megatron?”

“... Don’t give it names. If I had known, I wouldn't have given you access to its voice functions.” Z lamented as he buried himself in the equipment again.

Sophia watched his movements intently. Although the operation seemed complex and difficult to understand, she made a mental note of the steps, so that if he were absent or unable to handle it himself, she could step in.

More importantly, she feared that if he slipped back into a bout of madness, she wouldn’t know how to help him.

Z felt her piercing gaze on him, and he suppressed a shiver running down his spine, refusing to look back. He had this nagging feeling that if he turned around, it would show that he was guilty... He hadn’t truly dared to believe that Sophia would stay by his side. His plans included protocols for her staying and also for her leaving.

Had she actually left with Xiao Cha back then, he doubted he would have awakened so quickly. Overcoming the chaos in his mind was no easy feat. After all, he was no god; otherwise, he wouldn't be resorting to such underhanded tactics.

As he adjusted the settings, he muttered, “It’s good for you to watch. You never know when it might come in handy.” He glanced back at her, a hint of unease in his eyes. “With your intelligence, you should be able to remember the basic steps, right?”

“... Just hurry up and finish.” Sophia replied dismissively.

Z said nothing more, a small smirk playing at the corners of his mouth, though it was unclear whether he was mocking her or himself. He quickened his pace, efficiently completing the preparation of the stasis agent. With a swift motion, he downed the concoction and tossed the test tube aside, turning to embrace her.

“Done,” he said, his voice gravelly.

Sophia stiffened slightly, murmuring, “Oh,” as she attempted to push him away, “It’s a bit hot. Can you not be so close...?”

“Tsk, saying things you don’t mean again.” Z deliberately slowed his tone, lowering his voice to a sultry whisper. “You know, back in the day, I only had you from midnight to eleven at night, which left me with about an hour each day when you weren’t around. But now...” He stepped back to assess her, his fingers brushing through her increasingly long hair. “Now I guess I’ll have to start resting like a normal person. That means I only have you from six in the morning to eight at night.”

“... You could wake up a bit later; I don’t mind,” Sophia said, blushing as she tried to change the subject. “Where are we headed? We can’t just keep flying in the sky, right? We should find a place to land; it wouldn’t be safe if it starts to rain.”

“Isn’t it nice to stay put here?” Z stood up, shedding his lab coat as he squinted at her, his movements teasingly seductive as he adjusted his tie. He was clearly doing it on purpose!

In truth, Z was being intentional. Leaning casually against the desk, he adopted a posture that no woman, whether eighty or eight, could resist, speaking languidly, “I don’t want you to go out anymore. I just want you to stay by my side. Whenever you insist on leaving, I feel this very special sensation.”

Sophia thought he was about to pour out romantic words, her heart racing with anticipation. She shyly lowered her head and followed his lead, asking, “What kind of sensation?”

“Probably...” He hesitated, struggling to find the words. After a long moment, he finally said softly, “It’s the tragic feeling of being forced to leave the lab right when success is within reach.”

“Is that so?” Sophia looked at him, disappointment clouding her features as she pouted. “So my leaving doesn’t impact you much.”

“Of course it does.” Z quickly denied her assertion. “You being out there in the spotlight affects me a lot, so you really shouldn’t go.”

“Why not?”

“Because family matters shouldn’t be aired in public,” Z replied with a straight face.

...

Sophia silently turned to leave the control room, asking Megatron as she walked, “Where are we flying to right now? Is it safe around us? What’s the weather like?”

Megatron remained silent, not answering her. Confused, she turned back to see Z following her outside, dressed casually in a loose white shirt, moving leisurely. “I disabled his voice function.”

“Why would you do that?” She felt like her questions today could fill a thousand-question book.

Z looked down, unbuttoning his shirt. “Because some things are too personal. Even if it’s a machine, I don’t want it to eavesdrop.”

“...”

“What are you hiding from?” Z asked, furrowing his brows as he watched Sophia dash to the operating table.

At that moment, Sophia had her back to him. She touched the table before turning back with a meaningful smile on her lips. “Who’s hiding? I’m just looking for something. What are you afraid of?”

Z narrowed his eyes at the bandages, handcuffs, and... a syringe? His forehead twitched, and he rubbed it, feeling a headache coming on as he asked, “What are you planning to do?”

Sophia didn’t answer. She shrugged off the lab coat, wearing only his oversized dress shirt, barefoot and standing there. The shirt barely covered her rear, revealing her slender, graceful legs, her fair skin blending almost seamlessly with the clean white of the shirt.

“Doing what you enjoy, of course.” She walked toward him holding the handcuffs, asking as she approached, “About the stasis agent’s ingredients and procedure, you should write it down on paper or save a copy on the computer later. I’m worried I might forget.”

Z stood still, watching Sophia as she stood on his shoes, stretching up to wrap her arms around his neck. He softly murmured, “Your brain is too slow. Doing this will lower the IQ of our future offspring; I need to think of a way to...”

“No.” Sophia pressed her finger against his lips, leaning in close, her body brushing against him. Breathing in his unique masculine scent, she sighed contentedly, “I didn’t forget; it’s just that... I might be doing something a bit too stimulating soon, and I’m worried I might forget those less important details in the heat of the moment.”

Hearing her suggestive words, Z felt no surprise at all. She was precisely the type of person he liked, but he realized he might have been too eager. Sophia didn’t seem like the kind who would easily give in to his advances.

“I’ve never heard you speak seriously to me before.” She tugged at his collar, leaning back slightly to meet his gaze. “So, tell me?”

Z squinted, puzzled. “Tell you what?”

“A confession.” Sophia stammered, hastily adding, “Like how you love me or something.”

“...”

“If you won’t say it, then fine.” She shrugged and turned to leave, but Z quickly pulled her back into his embrace. She giggled, “Are you scared? If you’re scared, just say it!”

Z's spirits were still somewhat low, but seeing her so lively eased his worries. Initially, he feared her blaming him and creating unnecessary troubles, but now it seemed that she saved him a lot of time and effort. Since she wanted to hear it, he would indulge her, considering it a reward for her ability to discern right from wrong.

In a deep, magnetic tone, he sincerely said, “You know, the reason I didn’t kill you the first time I saw you was twofold: one, your identity, and two...” He deliberately dragged out the last word, gauging her reaction, before casually adding, “Two, apart from your face and body, I couldn’t find any other redeeming qualities. And I don’t keep useless people around...”

“... Shut up.”

“What’s wrong?” He leaned in closer, “Not satisfied?”

Sophia, flustered, retorted, “You... You make me sound so terrible... Even if what you said is true, I still have plenty of people who like me...” Her protest lacked conviction, but she stubbornly held her ground, refusing to lose face in front of him.

However, she had inadvertently hit the nail on the head. In Z’s eyes, every man was his rival. Grinding his teeth, he scoffed, “Yes, you reminded me. I’m running low on bullets.”
