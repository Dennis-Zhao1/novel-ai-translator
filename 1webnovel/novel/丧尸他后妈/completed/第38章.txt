After Wang Xiaoshu got up, she found Z watching her eat. She was puzzled by the spread of food before her, wondering where he had managed to get it all. Was his belly like Doraemon's pocket? (￣_￣|||)

“This…” she hesitated, glancing at him. He adjusted his glasses, crossed his legs, and leaned back in his chair, his long bangs falling over his forehead in a messy yet charming way. “It’s from the Atomic people. What do you think? Not bad, right?”

Wang Xiaoshu nodded thoughtfully, feeling a warm sense of happiness as she began to eat. Z sat across from her, staring intently, neither eating nor leaving—an odd situation.

“Aren’t you going to eat?” she asked, feeling a bit uncomfortable.

Z, exasperated, said, “Do you know what time it is? It’s noon! You should have finished lunch by now.”

“…” Wang Xiaoshu squinted and let out a soft laugh, saying meaningfully, “Yeah, it’s all my fault. I got bitten by a dog last night and it really hurt, so I couldn’t get up. You’ll have to forgive me.”

Z looked momentarily taken aback but didn’t divert his gaze. His face was half-shadowed, with his eyes squinting in an artistic way, making it hard for Wang Xiaoshu to enjoy her meal. Eventually, she set down her chopsticks, signaling that she was full.

“You need to finish everything,” Z ordered with a mischievous smile. “Not a single grain of rice can be left.”

Looking at the enormous spread meant for two, Wang Xiaoshu felt troubled. “Shouldn’t this be for both of us? Aren’t you going to eat? This is too much…”

“Rice is especially precious in this apocalypse. No one would complain about having too much,” Z replied, turning his head away slightly, as if trying to appear indifferent. “I’m not hungry; you should eat.” Yet, after saying that, he awkwardly added a “lah” at the end, as if to soften his words.

Wang Xiaoshu stared at him for a moment before obediently lowering her head to eat. Z’s mouth twitched as he stood up and walked over to the bedside table, grabbing a suitcase and starting to fiddle with something inside. By the time Wang Xiaoshu had reluctantly finished all her rice, he was already prepared.

“You can now access the quantum electronic monitoring system,” Z said with a hint of nostalgia. “Quantum truly deserves to be called the largest survivor base. They even have equipment that’s barely acceptable. I already tested it; your father is currently in the monitoring room.”

Wang Xiaoshu responded with a nonchalant “Oh,” without much emotion. “At this time, he should indeed be doing the noon rounds in the monitoring room.”

Z scrutinized her with a probing gaze, remaining silent. He continued to watch as she connected with a middle-aged man on the computer screen, explaining the current situation somewhat clumsily.

Wang Xiaoshu stumbled through the suspicious points about Yi Ning, relaying the latest updates on the four major bases. This included that the atoms had obtained a detoxifier to alleviate soil and air toxicity, and that Yi Ning had begun to set her sights on the atomic particles.

Most importantly, Ouyang was dead, and the other three of his former subordinates seemed utterly loyal to Yi Ning, completely disregarding her as the nominal “young lady.” The only explanation for this was that they were actually Yi Ning’s people.

Z listened to all of this with a calm demeanor, showing no surprise—whether it was Yi Ning’s identity or the events she described, he either didn’t care or had already known.

Wang Jie had recovered from his initial shock upon seeing Wang Xiaoshu. He pondered for a moment and nodded gravely. “I understand. When are you coming back?” He sighed, “Dad is very worried about you. It’s been so long since you left without any news.”

“I…” Wang Xiaoshu instinctively glanced at Z, whose position was out of the camera’s view, meaning Wang Jie couldn’t see who was with her.

Z could clearly see Wang Xiaoshu’s hesitation. He averted his gaze, seemingly unwilling to interfere with her choice.

After a moment of hesitation, Wang Xiaoshu slowly said, “I don’t know yet. I need to finish things here first, probably…”

Wang Jie frowned, clenching his fist and thinking for a long time. “I’ll come to get you.”

“Ah?” Wang Xiaoshu exclaimed in surprise.

At that moment, Wang Jie’s face, which was quite different from Wang Papa’s, seemed to overlap with her father’s, and his words made Wang Xiaoshu’s eyes well up with tears. “You are Dad’s only daughter. I’ve already lost your mother; I can’t lose you too.”

…If the original Wang Xiaoshu hadn’t been injected with the H+ virus by Xiao Cong, perhaps Wang Jie wouldn’t have been so cruel as to abandon her.

After all, she was his daughter—no matter how fierce a tiger can be, it won’t eat its own cub. Although Wang Jie could sometimes be stubborn and hypocritical, he still had genuine feelings for his daughter. Their relationship was somewhat akin to that of Xiong Ba and You Ruo in the story of Fengyun.

“No need, Dad. I’ll contact you again. Staying here allows me to keep you updated on the latest developments,” Wang Xiaoshu said gently, exhaling slowly.

Wang Jie seemed to care about this and, covering his mouth, thought for a moment. “That’s fine, but you should have some idea of when you’ll be back.”

Wang Xiaoshu didn’t know how to answer, so she bluntly said, “Someone’s coming. Let’s leave it at that for now. I’ll contact you another day. Goodbye.”

“When are you coming back?” Wang Jie pressed anxiously.

Wang Xiaoshu, feeling guilty and sad, softly repeated “goodbye” before quickly shutting off the computer. She turned away, wiping away her tears, unsure whether that “goodbye” was meant for Wang Jie or for her father, who was far away in another time and space.

In truth, she felt insecure. It was only because Z was by her side that she could focus entirely on dealing with him, leaving no time to think about other things. Life in this apocalypse was hard; if one hadn’t experienced it firsthand, they wouldn’t understand the feeling of having no one to rely on and nothing to hope for.

If she were alone, trying to escape the doomed fate that bound her, she would probably have to fight for food after leaving Quantum. If she couldn’t outfight others, she would go hungry. Just thinking about it, if she hadn’t met Z… life would have been incredibly tough.

This man, whom others deemed unworthy of living, was precisely her only support in this harsh world.

“What are you thinking about?” Z’s sudden question broke Wang Xiaoshu’s train of thought. She snapped back to reality, realizing she had unknowingly leaned into his embrace. He gently patted her back, and as she rested against him, her eyes focused on the collar of his white shirt. She whispered, “I want to live for a long time, no matter what happens, even if it means living in humiliation without dignity until I have to die.”

“Seems like you’ve always had that thought; it shouldn’t be a result of your conversation with your dad,” Z commented.

Wang Xiaoshu didn’t respond, instead changing the subject. “Speaking of which, he might come for me at any time. You heard him; he said he’d come to get me. What will we do then?” She stared at him, deliberately saying, “Even if he doesn’t come to get me, I will have to go back someday. What will you do then?”

Without a moment’s hesitation, Z replied, “I’ll go with you.” He seemed surprised by his own words.

Wang Xiaoshu looked at him for a long time, then smiled broadly, joking, “How should I introduce you to Dad when the time comes? Should I have him call you professor?”

“Professor? Isn’t that bad?” Z asked, his awkwardness evident in his stiff response.

Wang Xiaoshu said meaningfully, “Don’t you know that ‘professor’ sounds the same as ‘beast’ in a way?” She wrote those two characters in his palm.

Z stared at his palm for a long moment before looking up at her seriously. “From now on, just call me Doctor.”

He seemed a bit embarrassed about his earlier admission of “going with you,” as if trying to reclaim some dignity by adding, “Don’t think I can’t live without you. It’s just that you were the one who proposed the ‘experience’ plan; you have to see it through to the end. One must have a beginning and an end in life.”

Wang Xiaoshu nodded repeatedly. “Okay, okay. You can live without me; you’re just afraid of being dumped.”

“Don’t be silly. I’ve never been dumped my whole life,” Z said, standing up and walking toward the door.

Wang Xiaoshu leaned on her hands on the bed, laughing heartily at his retreating figure. “Don’t be silly yourself; this is your first time dating.”
