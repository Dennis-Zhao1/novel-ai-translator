The newcomer wore a protective suit reminiscent of what Sophia Wang had seen back at Z's "hometown." The shoulder insignia bore the letter Z, and his appearance was solid and his expression serious, yet there was an oddly comforting familiarity about him.

As he approached, he introduced himself, bowing respectfully with a smile. "Hello, Miss Wang. I'm Xia Jing'en, the base commander appointed by Mr. Zhang."

He eagerly reached out to shake hands with Sophia, but just as she was about to respond, the ever-impulsive Weizhen Tian stomped his foot, sending a cloud of dust into the air, covering both of them.

Sophia and Xia Jing'en coughed up the dirt, exchanging awkward glances filled with embarrassment. However, Weizhen Tian seemed undeterred by the incident; he stepped back, inadvertently crushing part of the courtyard wall, and then raised his hand to knock over one of the base’s lamp posts, leaving Xia Jing'en gaping in shock, his mouth forming an "O."

"Uh, I..." Xia Jing'en seemed to lose his train of thought, scrambling backward. "Miss Wang, I'll come find you another day. I need to send someone to fix the lamp post; otherwise, the area might not be safe at night!"

Sophia's half-formed "okay" was left hanging in the air as Xia Jing'en hurriedly disappeared. She blinked in surprise and turned to look at Weizhen Tian, who had returned to his usual state. An audacious thought began to form in her mind.

"Weizhen Tian!" she suddenly called out. Hearing his name, he snapped to attention, instinctively responding, "Yes!"

Sophia smiled slightly, narrowing her eyes as she nodded approvingly. "Good job."

“……?” Despite his adorably clueless robotic face, Sophia could almost see the confusion etched across it.

Not wanting to linger on the awkwardness, she turned and walked into the house. "I’m going to take a shower. The weather looks bad; it seems like it's going to rain again. Can you bring me a set of clothes, just like their uniforms?"

She didn’t wait for a reply before shutting the door behind her. Once inside, she immediately crouched by the door, peeking through the crack to observe Weizhen Tian's reaction. He froze for a moment before transforming into an aircraft and swiftly shooting into the sky, quickly becoming a distant speck.

Sophia squinted at the gloomy sky, stroking her chin thoughtfully before decisively heading to the bathroom. 

The recent weather had indeed been miserable. The Atomic Region was particularly rainy; she'd been here for less than four days, and it felt like it was either cloudy or raining. Sure enough, thunder rumbled ominously, promising another downpour soon.

After locking the bathroom door, Sophia began to undress, her long black hair cascading over her shoulders, having grown well past them. She hesitated, contemplating whether to cut it, when Weizhen Tian's voice suddenly came through.

"Madam, your clothes have been prepared and are placed…"

"Just bring them over," Sophia called out, opening the bathroom window and leaning against the frame in her underwear, casually gazing out at Weizhen Tian. He stood there, holding a box that likely contained her clothes, completely frozen in place upon seeing her in such an unguarded moment.

Don't ask how she knew he was stunned; a robot that didn't respond to being called had either malfunctioned or was utterly dumbfounded.

"Hey!" Sophia jumped slightly, trying to catch his attention. "Say something! Is your hardware going to break if you do?"

Weizhen Tian seemed choked up, finally managing to stammer out, "It will consume oil."

Sophia smirked, lightly touching her neck with a playful grin. "Oh, really? Aren't you solar-powered? What oil are you consuming?"

"…"

"You’re doing great," Sophia said with a cold smile, "Now bring me the clothes, and you can go." She turned back into the bathroom, turning on the shower head, seemingly unconcerned about anyone peeking through the window as she began to wash up, shedding her underwear along the way.

Weizhen Tian, who had initially seemed oblivious, quickly moved to the window upon seeing her casualness, blocking the view entirely. He placed the box on the windowsill and spoke in his robotic tone, "The clothes are on the windowsill."

"Thanks," Sophia said, wiping water from her face. Her well-proportioned figure glistened under the water. "You can go now."

"…"

"Move aside; you’re blocking the light," Sophia said, glancing back at the window, only to find Weizhen Tian half-crouched, staring at her.

"What's going on?" Sophia feigned a frown, squinting in confusion.

"You…" Weizhen Tian seemed to struggle for words, hesitating before finally saying, "This isn’t appropriate."

"What’s wrong with me?" Sophia turned off the shower, placing her hands on her hips in a striking pose.

Upon receiving such a sight, Weizhen Tian's electronic eyes abruptly shut down, and he zoomed away, pulling the window closed behind him.

Sophia stood there, taken aback for a moment, before bursting into laughter. Some people really couldn’t change their nature, no matter where they were. 

She guessed that Z hadn’t gone far—he was likely still around the base or perhaps in Weizhen Tian's operating room, controlling him remotely. Regardless of his reasons for leaving, the mere fact that he had done so without a word was enough for her to tease him later. 

This was just the beginning; the real fun was yet to come.

Grinding her teeth, Sophia began to wash up seriously.

However, while she was in the shower, the toilet lid suddenly flipped open, revealing a small rectangular computer screen that seemed to emerge from nowhere. Water droplets fell on it without any effect, and the scene looked oddly familiar.

Oh right, those who had seen Stephen Chow's "Kung Fu Hustle" might remember the scene where the female lead contacted her superior after being shot by 007 while in the bathroom. That superior appeared on a toilet lid screen.

Curious, Sophia crouched by the toilet, resting her chin on her hand, wondering who had installed such a device. She was not surprised when she recognized Z's face appearing on the screen.

"Sorry," Z's deep voice echoed through the bathroom, making it a bit hard for her to process, but his embarrassed expression, lifting his downturned gaze to look at her, left her feeling quite satisfied.

Just as she'd suspected, he was either in Weizhen Tian or controlling him, which explained how he had gotten the news so quickly.

"Sorry?" Sophia raised her eyebrows in surprise, her expression bewildered. "Who are you apologizing to? Did you do something wrong?"

Z's lips twitched slightly, the awkwardness reminiscent of a certain apology video, making her feel like the female lead in the scandal. "Alright, you need to come back immediately, and I won’t hold it against you."

Z pulled out an A4 sheet of paper, which had some strange doodles on it—two stick figures, with something resembling… plants and zombies between them?

"What is this?" Sophia asked stiffly.

"This is you," he pointed to the figure on the left. "This is me," he pointed to the one on the right. Then he circled the strange things in the middle. "These are the obstacles between us. I'm currently eliminating them." He drew a big cross over the obstacles and smiled at the camera. "I'll be back once I'm done."

Sophia crouched there, gazing into the screen, their eyes locking. He couldn’t see below her chest, but the sensation of knowing what lay beneath yet being unable to do anything felt… complicated.

"Fine, how long?" she finally relented, speaking earnestly. "Even though in this world the necessity for marriage has faded, you are still technically my husband. As the head of the household, I support your decisions unconditionally. But you must know that sometimes you're genuinely in the wrong, like this time. You shouldn’t have left."

She sighed, "Your actions make me feel like I can never truly enter your world. I want to be by your side, no matter what you’re doing, especially when you’re in danger."

Z seemed taken aback, looking at her as if he wanted to say something, but he merely pressed his lips together, saying nothing.

Sophia didn’t push him. "Since you haven’t decided when to come back, let me know when you do. Remember, you can contact me anytime."

"Aren't you curious about what I'm doing?" Z raised an eyebrow.

"Weren’t you just saying? You're clearing obstacles."

His response left Z momentarily speechless. He stepped back, tugging at his tie. The dim view on the screen cleared a bit, but Sophia noticed that the backdrop was not Weizhen Tian's operating room.

The lighting was dim, and he hadn’t turned on the lights, but it was obvious he was in a lab she hadn’t seen before.

Clearly, he had many labs she knew nothing about. When he returned, she would have to thoroughly get to know him.

With a smile on her face, she plotted how to tease him, while sweetly saying, "I’ll be waiting for you." After saying that, she decisively closed the toilet lid, muttering under her breath, "Such a hassle!"

…

Thus, the two of them had temporarily reached a "ceasefire agreement." Z was busy resolving his issues while Sophia, after taking his medicine, no longer experienced the brief blindness at night. She took this time to inspect the area surrounding the Atomic Base, noting the tight security and organized layout—very much in line with Z's usual style, making her feel safe.

Later, Xia Jing'en came to see her again, apologizing for his previous outburst. "I’m sorry, Miss Wang. I lost my composure last time."

"It's fine; it wasn't your fault," Sophia replied, glancing at Weizhen Tian, who stood as a backdrop, her eyes filled with mild disdain.

"Miss Wang, it’s like this." Xia Jing'en professionally handed her a USB drive. "This contains recent data collected by our subordinates. We've detected a significant military force approaching, which we believe is from the Quantum side."

Upon hearing this, Sophia's expression remained unchanged, as if she had anticipated such news. Xia Jing'en noticed her demeanor and continued, "The Quantum forces are far better equipped than we are, and if a confrontation occurs…"

"Who said anything about engaging them in battle?" Sophia replied, inserting the USB into her computer and opening the folder casually. "If they encounter an accident on the road and end up being eaten by zombies, that wouldn’t be a problem now, would it?"

"…." Xia Jing'en stared at her, dumbfounded, unsure how to respond.
