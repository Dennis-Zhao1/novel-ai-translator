As soon as they stepped out of the molecular range, the surrounding environment and weather improved slightly. Even though the apocalypse had turned survival into a historical issue, the sight of the sky gradually turning blue still lifted her spirits a bit.

Sophia Wang stood idly with her arms crossed, waiting for Z. Every once in a while, she glanced around to see if he was back yet. On her seventh glance, she spotted Yi Ning walking towards her, her brow furrowing slightly in response.

"Sophia," Yi Ning said nonchalantly, flashing her a smile. Sophia returned a half-hearted smile that barely lifted the corners of her mouth before her expression went back to neutral, causing an awkward tension to linger between them.

The memory of how Yi Ning had pressured Ouyang into that situation last night made it impossible for Sophia to treat her nicely, let alone maintain even a pretense of harmony. If it hadn't been for Yi Ning's sudden departure from Quantum, the plot might have progressed further, and by now, Yi Ning could have had most of Quantum's real power in her grasp. Meanwhile, poor Baozi would have been driven to madness and dark transformation by both Yi Ning and Ouyang's antics.

As the original female protagonist, Yi Ning likely viewed her "true love" with Ouyang as something poignant and beautiful. Though she might have had a plethora of affections, each one was probably genuine, as is often the case with heroines in romance novels—an almost scientific impossibility of being so open-hearted.

Even though Yi Ning had come to occupy the role of the mistress, it was also true that, after Ouyang’s betrayal, Baozi had done some truly foolish things in the heat of the moment—this was simply a narrative necessity. For instance, there had been a time when Baozi contemplated killing Yi Ning by intentionally leading zombies to her, putting her life in danger.

However, it must be said that Baozi was still Baozi. In the original story, Sophia Wang never did anything truly earth-shattering or villainous. Sooner or later, she was worn down to exhaustion by Yi Ning and Ouyang, losing faith in herself. In a moment of desperation, she had wanted to expose Ouyang and Yi Ning's plans to Wang Jie, but when the opportunity arose, her heart wavered due to Ouyang—by the time she steeled herself, it was already too late.

Yi Ning caught wind of Baozi’s intentions, and while she was busy conquering the world, she handed the task of dealing with Baozi over to the competent Governor Xiao Cong of the harem. Xiao Cong fulfilled the queen's mission and injected Baozi with the H+ virus. After becoming a zombie, she was promptly expelled from Quantum by her righteous father. In the end… well, it was best not to dwell on that.

Yi Ning had no idea that in just a short time, Sophia Wang had thought through all of this. She also couldn’t know that while Sophia appeared the same on the outside, she had already undergone a significant internal transformation.

Noticing Sophia's cold demeanor, Yi Ning decided against pretending to be friendly and instead scrutinized her expression, asking indirectly, "Sophia, you and the professor were in the car all night last night. What exactly did you… do?"

Sophia looked at her, puzzled. "Why would I tell you?"

"… Aren't we friends?" Yi Ning feigned ignorance.

Sophia couldn’t help but chuckle, exasperated. "At this point, you still want to pretend? Do you really think I’m that naive?"

Yi Ning’s eyes sparkled mischievously. "Of course, I always outlast you, no matter what."

"And what exactly are those aspects where you outlast me? Because I honestly don’t remember. Is my poor memory making me seem too magnanimous? Sorry, but I’m not angry at all," Sophia replied earnestly.

Yi Ning shifted the topic. "I didn’t come here to argue. I won’t leave because of what happened last night. You still have to go back to Quantum. I promised I would separate from Ouyang, and I will. You don’t need to doubt the truth of that."

"I’ve never liked used goods," Sophia stated coolly. "Besides, the governor of Quantum is my father. Whether or not I go back, and how I go back, I can communicate directly with him. Ouyang may be capable, but if he weren’t my fiancé, he’d be nothing in Quantum."

"How fortunate that he is still your fiancé," Yi Ning replied flatly.

Sophia shook her head. "No, from the moment he fell for you, he ceased to be."

Yi Ning stared at her in disbelief. "I don’t believe it. You really don’t like him anymore? You grew up together and went through so much. How could you just stop liking him like that?"

Sophia was at a loss for how to explain, so she resorted to a catch-all excuse. "Did you forget the question you opened with?"

Yi Ning paused, confused. "… What?"

"Because of the professor," Sophia said seriously. "Isn’t that obvious? Didn’t you ask what we did in the car last night? We did what we were supposed to do. Are you satisfied with that answer?"

Yi Ning was utterly shocked. "You… Sophia, how did you become like this? You weren’t like this before! You’re not married yet; how can you… no, this isn’t right! I have to report this to the governor!"

As she turned to leave, she was suddenly blocked by someone. Her gaze traveled up from the white shirt to find Z, whose dark eyes, partially obscured by bangs, looked down at her with a mix of sarcasm and calm. His voice was deep and melodic, yet carried an ominous weight. "Miss Yi, where are you in such a hurry to go?"

Yi Ning's face stiffened for a moment before she quickly smiled. "Oh, it’s nothing. I just wanted to inform everyone to prepare for departure. It’s getting late; if we don’t leave now, we won’t make it to the next town before dark."

"Is that so?" Z's lips curved into a regretful smile. "That’s too bad; I was hoping you could join us for the show."

Sophia was taken aback, glancing at Z with surprise, unsure of what he was up to. Z reassured her with a look, and though she was skeptical, she didn’t argue.

Yi Ning hesitated, gazing at Z. "A show? In a place like this, in this era, where would there even be a show?"

Z slowly raised his wrist and casually adjusted his watch, pressing a hidden silver button embedded in the metallic strap. The device on the other side suddenly snapped a series of photos of Yi Ning’s upturned face, the faint blue flash illuminating her eyes in a strange green hue. For a moment, her eyes flickered, as if she had lost consciousness, standing stiffly in place.

"Come with us," Z said coolly, taking a step toward Sophia. Yi Ning followed him like a puppet, her limbs rigid and her expression blank.

"What’s going on?" Sophia asked in bewilderment.

Z took her hand and leaned in closer, his voice low and secretive. "You’ll find out soon enough. I had a hunch this would come in handy."

Sophia felt a shiver run down her spine as she followed Z into a secluded patch of woods. Once they were free from the toxic soil of the molecular range, the trees here were a bit lusher, providing at least some cover from prying eyes.

Z, filled with anticipation, pulled her closer, placing his hands on her shoulders and gazing into her eyes. "We can’t find good test subjects around here right now. Your abilities are unique and do not react strongly on solids, so you’ll be experimenting on her." He snapped his fingers, and the dazed Yi Ning took a step forward, as if compelled by an unseen force.

Sophia gaped at Yi Ning, who now resembled a robot. "What happened to her? When did you do this…?"

Remembering the last time he had unwittingly caused trouble, Z hesitated to answer, so he dodged the question. "She has the latest virus I developed inside her. Just conduct your experiments on her; she won't die." As if to reassure her, he pulled out a surgical knife from who knows where and plunged it into Yi Ning's abdomen without hesitation. Yi Ning didn’t even blink.

Sophia stared in disbelief at the unblemished skin of Yi Ning's stomach. "… She’s not bleeding?"

"She’s like a host of the H+ virus now, dependent on her nervous system. She only gains consciousness and agency under certain conditions, and to achieve that effect…" Z lifted his chin, "you’ll need my help."

Sophia bit her lip, looking uncertainly at him. "She’s staring right at me; I…"

"Just have her close her eyes," Z instructed, and Yi Ning immediately complied.

Sophia was left speechless. Z continued, "Still not working? Then cover her face." He pulled out a checkered handkerchief from his shirt pocket and covered Yi Ning's eyes. "There, now you can treat her like a zombie."

Sophia took a deep breath, trying to convince herself that Yi Ning was just a zombie. She asked hesitantly, "If I use my powers on her, she really won’t be harmed?"

Who knew? Although the new virus was an upgraded version of H+, he hadn’t yet had a chance to review the results of those experiments. He thought it would be a good opportunity to see; he really had no idea if Yi Ning would end up revealing his actions afterward.

"Of course," Z assured her with utmost seriousness.

Sophia sighed in relief. "Then that’s good." She smiled and placed her hand on Yi Ning's shoulder, trying to recall the method Z had taught her last night, channeling her electric energy into her palm. Sweat began to bead on her forehead as she concentrated, clearly struggling.

Z rested his chin on his hand, watching her without blinking. As the wind blew through his bangs, his slanted eyes narrowed slightly, and suddenly, he said, "Wait."

Sophia snapped out of her focus, panting slightly as she looked at him. "What’s wrong?"

Z used his lab coat sleeve to wipe the sweat from her forehead and pulled out a small silver handgun from his back pocket. "Try this. Direct contact with a zombie increases the risk; you’re still inexperienced, so it’s better to keep your distance."

… Play from a distance? Did he think this was a video game? What’s your role, then? Healer? DPS? No, wait, you’re the boss.

Sophia took the handgun and, under Z's guidance, loaded a bullet into it. She once again attempted to channel the energy she felt into her palm and into the gun. After having experienced it once, her nervous system seemed to have saved the memory, making this second attempt much easier. She felt a tingling sensation in her hand and inadvertently squeezed the trigger. The bullet shot straight through Yi Ning’s shoulder and struck the tree behind her. Yi Ning's body jolted, and she collapsed backward, while the tree that was hit fell with a crash, splitting from the ground up. Its dry leaves ignited, sending up plumes of black smoke.

Sophia’s heart raced as she realized she had unleashed such destructive power. Watching Yi Ning lying on the ground, completely unresponsive, she noted that while there was no blood from her shoulder, Yi Ning had closed her eyes and lay motionless.

"What happened to her?" Sophia gripped the gun tightly, looking at Z. "She’s not dead, is she?"

Z ran his long finger along his lips, adjusting his glasses. "She’s not dead." Probably.
