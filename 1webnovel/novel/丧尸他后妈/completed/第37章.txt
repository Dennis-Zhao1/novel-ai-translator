Yusuke Miyazaki was actually aware that Xiao Cong was trying to drive him away for a reason, but he didn’t mind at all. In fact, he only needed Yi Ning to be alive; he had no interest in what she was up to, as long as it didn’t threaten the safety of the base. She could do as she pleased.

When Xiao Cong asked Yusuke to help look for Xiao Yaya, he obediently set off. Despite being the son of the governor of the base, he felt that staying there was far more annoying than going out to search for her. His father had a vast array of women to choose from, so why did he have to settle for such a troublesome young lady? Yusuke hoped his father would reconsider soon.

With a sigh, Yusuke went in search of Xiao Yaya. At that moment, Xiao Yaya was receiving a lesson from Xiao Cha. Xiao Cha looked at his younger sister, who was gazing at him with a pitiful expression, and felt a mix of frustration and pity. Xiao Yaya’s face resembled that of a small kitten, making it hard for him to scold her despite knowing she had made a significant mistake. He was already soft-hearted, and under the weight of her pleading gaze, all of his reprimands faded away.

“Next time…” Xiao Cha sighed and rubbed his forehead. “You can’t do this again, do you understand?”

Xiao Yaya’s spirits soared, though she dared not show it on her face, maintaining a tone filled with feigned sadness. “I understand, big brother.”

“Alright.” Xiao Cha gently ruffled her hair and said softly, “Go rest now. Although your elder brother entrusted your education to me, he might still approach you privately, so be prepared.”

At the mention of Xiao Cong, Xiao Yaya’s expression stiffened slightly. She glanced at the ceiling, nodded, and asked, “Where did he go after dinner tonight?” She smiled, “I’m surprised he didn’t come immediately to scold me.”

Xiao Cha frowned in thought. “I believe he went to meet Miss Yi Ning.”

“He went to see her?!” Xiao Yaya looked at him, astonished.

“Yes, why?” Xiao Cha asked, puzzled.

“Where are they?” Xiao Yaya pressed eagerly.

Though Xiao Cha was confused, he told his sister Yi Ning's address. As soon as Xiao Yaya heard it, she spun around and dashed out, disappearing in an instant.

Xiao Cha couldn’t help but ponder this, propping his head on one hand, lost in thought.

When Yusuke arrived, Xiao Yaya had just left not long ago. He explained his purpose for coming to Xiao Cha, who then informed him of Xiao Yaya’s abrupt departure. After blinking in surprise, Yusuke hesitated for a moment before sharing what had happened on the way to the atomic base.

Meanwhile, Xiao Yaya had already sprinted to Yi Ning’s residence. By this time, Z and Sophia Wang had been gone for a while. Xiao Yaya pushed the door open and raced up the stairs, calming her breath to listen for any sounds on the second floor. She quickly located their room and kicked the door open with a forceful push, startling Yi Ning and Xiao Cong, who were in the middle of an intimate moment.

Yi Ning was disheveled, her upper body bare, with only her underwear covering her modesty. Xiao Cong, while still somewhat properly dressed, had his belt undone, and it was clear that things had escalated.

Xiao Yaya’s anger surged, her expression morphing from neutral to one of fury, her brows knitting together tightly as her delicate face turned icy, sending shivers down anyone who dared glance her way.

“Yaya? What are you doing here?” Xiao Cong rushed to her, but Xiao Yaya didn’t even spare him a glance as she pushed him aside and walked toward Yi Ning.

“You seduced him, didn’t you?” Xiao Yaya’s voice was laced with a mixture of accusation and mockery.

Yi Ning, with an indifferent expression, shielded her chest with one arm. Xiao Yaya noticed this and looked down at her own flat chest, her eyes suddenly welling with tears.

Seeing her like this, Xiao Cong felt a pang of pain in his heart and moved to comfort her, wanting to explain, but he didn’t know how, and she wouldn’t let him near.

Prior to this, Xiao Cong had never imagined things would escalate to this point.

Yi Ning had written on the invitation for their meeting that she wanted a relatively quiet environment to discuss matters, which was why he had sent Yusuke away. He had intended to talk to Xiao Yaya about her sneaking out afterward. Yet, he didn’t foresee the trap he had walked into. He had only considered his perspective, not taking into account the variables on Yi Ning’s side.

Yi Ning was undeniably beautiful, and her body was what every man dreamed of; any man who claimed to be uninterested in her naked form was either a rare breed or a saint. As a normal man, he found it hard to resist.

When Yi Ning followed him out and pushed him into the room, her body pressed against his, his thoughts were consumed by Xiao Yaya. But Xiao Yaya was his sister—his biological sister. That twisted feeling of shame could never be voiced; even a hint of it had frightened her enough to run away from the base. If she knew what he truly felt, she would be terrified.

He didn’t want the two most important people in his life—his sister and his lover—to feel hurt. So, in a distorted way of thinking, he convinced himself that maybe it didn’t matter who was involved; when a tempting opportunity presented itself, how could he refuse?

Moreover, Yi Ning had her reasons for seeking him out. She had her own motives, ones that were related to the safety of the base.

As she embraced him, she whispered seductively in his ear, “You’re wondering why so many zombies have suddenly gathered here, aren’t you?” Her body brushed against him, igniting sparks of excitement.

Xiao Cong forced himself to maintain his composure. “What insights do you have, Miss Yi?”

“Perhaps it’s the work of the base,” she replied with a playful smile. “Look at how attentive Yusuke Miyazaki is. Why is he so eager to offer help? He even suggested his father send people to assist the atomic base. Doesn’t that seem too generous?” Yi Ning continued meaningfully, “Don’t forget how dire the situation is at the base; they can barely hold on for long, and with the atomic base so close, it would be the perfect target if someone wanted to strike. In this apocalypse, genuine feelings between people are hard to come by.”

Xiao Cong frowned, contemplating her words. “So why are you telling me this?”

Yi Ning wouldn’t reveal her true identity. Although she had no blood ties to the governor of the base, Jie Anjun had saved her life. He had cared for a group of orphans, teaching them how to read, write, and defend themselves—a sliver of warmth in a world filled with despair. She would give her all to repay him.

Her biggest goal in life, apart from unifying the four major bases and taking Z into her fold, was simple.

“Because…” Yi Ning leaned softly against him, wrapping her legs around his waist. She closed her eyes, imagining that the man she was embracing was the aloof doctor she often saw in a white coat. A smile crept onto her lips, “As a fragile woman, what could my motivations be? If I had to find one, it’s likely because… the base governor is a lecher, and I need a stepping stone to escape them. It appears I’ve fallen for you at first sight.”

...

To harm someone means to make them fall in love with you, making them dependent and spoiled, giving in to their every whim. When they become reckless and out of control, you deliver a heavy blow, ensuring they crumble completely.

Yi Ning opened her eyes, her mind echoing with Jie Anjun’s gentle teachings. As a man began to invade her space, her brow furrowed. She stroked Xiao Cong’s soft dark hair, imagining him as Z, and any feelings of resistance or discomfort vanished.

Xiao Cong didn’t fully believe Yi Ning; he was too shrewd to take her words at face value. While he accepted Yusuke’s proposal for assistance from the base, he had his own reasons. Although Yi Ning’s warning was worth considering, the base was still smaller than the atomic base, and there were zombies outside. Surely, the base wouldn’t be the one to suffer; why wouldn’t he take advantage of this?

Both had ulterior motives, engaging in actions that only lovers would do, unaware of the chaos that Xiao Yaya would soon bring.

Seeing Yi Ning’s silence, Xiao Yaya understood that she had accepted the situation. Yet, despite that, her hatred was directed squarely at Xiao Cong, for she knew that if he were unwilling, Yi Ning’s efforts would be in vain.

With red-rimmed eyes, Xiao Yaya turned to face Xiao Cong, who stood there stiffly. He wanted to reach out and wipe her tears but was met with her questioning, disappointed gaze, forcing him to lower his head in silence.

“What a good brother I have,” Xiao Yaya said, her anger turning into a bitter smile as she nodded repeatedly. “I tried to convince myself many times to let it go while I was out, but it was pointless. That’s why I came back with them. But you…” She took a deep breath, casting a sidelong glance before turning to leave. “You two continue on, pretend I was never here.”

Xiao Cong felt as if lightning had struck him, stunned in place. Once he snapped back to reality, he rushed out after her. Yi Ning remained behind, a mocking smile on her face as she watched their retreating figures, confidently revealing her chest, as if sure that no one would interrupt them tonight.

Coincidentally, someone else did arrive.

Xiao Cha had arranged accommodations for Yusuke and was waiting for him at Xiao Cong’s place. However, after waiting for quite some time with no sign of Xiao Cong, he began to worry. He then checked in on Xiao Yaya but found her missing as well.

Out of options, Xiao Cha suppressed his anxiety and headed to Yi Ning’s place. He knocked on the door downstairs but received no response. Instantly, the worst possibilities crossed his mind—what if something bad had happened? Were there spies? Or had zombies gotten in?

Dashing inside, he found the first floor quiet and unharmed. He quickly rushed up to the second floor, lifting his eyes to see Yi Ning’s graceful figure.

Xiao Cha immediately turned away, his tall and lean figure outlined against the moonlight, as if surrounded by a faint mist.

Yi Ning was momentarily taken aback, then a helpless smile appeared on her face. “Deputy Governor Xiao?”

Xiao Cha stood stiffly with his back to her, his expression darkening.

Generally calm people find it hard to get angry, but when they do, their fury is profound. Xiao Cha had a good relationship with Xiao Cong. Although they were not blood siblings, he was much closer to him than to their other sister, Xiao Sheng. Knowing a bit about the complicated situation between Xiao Cong and Xiao Yaya, he had already pieced together what was happening when he saw the scene before him.

With his back still turned to Yi Ning, he said, “Miss Yi, I don’t care what your intentions are, but if you plan to harm my family or this base, I suggest you abandon that thought.” As he spoke, he emotionlessly unfastened the top button of his uniform and accurately tossed his jacket onto Yi Ning’s shoulders before turning to look at her coldly. “The atomic base does not welcome those with ill intentions. As a young lady, I assume you still possess some dignity and self-respect. This time, I’ll let it go, but don’t let me catch you next time.” He finished, walking downstairs. At the door, he added icily, “Remember this: don’t let the fact that you’ve taken advantage of someone blind you to the consequences. Many who thought they had succeeded ended up regretting it.”

Yi Ning stood there, stunned, seemingly not expecting such harsh words from someone who appeared so gentle.

Meanwhile, while they were caught up in their own chaos, Z and Sophia Wang were still lost in their own world. For a moment, Sophia thought that continuing like this wouldn’t be so bad. Who cared about the world or the zombies? Finding a place where they couldn’t see any of this and living together would be fine… but…

Sophia let out a breath, lowering her arm that had shielded her eyes. Daylight had already arrived.

With the dawn, some things couldn’t be ignored, like the reality of the apocalypse that wouldn’t simply cease to exist because one chose to look away. Stepping outside, she saw no one—no shops, no transportation—constantly worrying about whether she’d be eaten by zombies at night…

She looked beside her, where it was empty and somewhat chilly, indicating that Z had left for a while. Where had he gone?

As she pondered this, the door swung open, revealing Z in his white protective suit. As he shed the white coat, his tall, well-defined figure came into view. Sophia squinted, recalling the exhilarating sensations from the previous night… Wait, something felt off—wasn’t that a mindset more typical of a man?

“Get up when you wake up,” Z said, glancing at his watch. “It’s almost noon; you need to eat lunch, your body requires a lot of nourishment right now.”

Sophia pouted, reluctant. “I don’t want to get up.”

“Why not?” Z pressed, expecting a reasonable explanation.

Sophia mumbled nonsensically, “Because I caught a cold.” She feigned a stuffy nose, adding, “Ah, I think I have a slight fever.” She touched her forehead, pretending to be sick. “I feel so awful.”

Z was far from naïve; he could see through her act. He spoke nonchalantly, “Sophia Wang, you know, when I was still in school, I knew someone who caught a cold and then…”

He paused deliberately, waiting for her to inquire.

“What happened then?” Sophia asked, intrigued.

Z’s lips curled into a sinister smile as he sat down beside her. “Then he died.”

“...Thanks, I feel much better now,” Sophia instantly sat up.
