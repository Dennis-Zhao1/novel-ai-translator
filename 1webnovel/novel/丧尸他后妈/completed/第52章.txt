When Sophia Wang caught sight of an entire wall filled with surveillance screens, an involuntary shiver ran down her spine. Countless images flashed through her mind in an instant, and she felt an overwhelming dread that her own indiscretions might have been recorded somewhere among them.

The wall was embedded with roughly nine-by-nine grids of 17-inch square monitors, each displaying a different image. The clarity of the footage was striking, complete with timestamps and location tags, allowing for an almost comprehensive view of every inch of land within quantum range.

In the center of the monitors, magnified and easily visible, were the figures of Xiao Cha, Xie Anjun, and others, moving forward with confidence. Walking alongside them was Sophia's father in this world, Wang Jie. They appeared to be in high spirits, laughing and chatting as if they were certain their upcoming mission would be a success.

"Some people, if they happen to refrain from doing something bad for just one moment, immediately think of themselves as good people," Z remarked with a faint smile, lifting his chin slightly as he observed Sophia with keen interest. "What do you plan to do about them?"

He must be talking about Xie Anjun and the others… Sophia felt no particular emotion and replied flatly, "You decide."

"Does that include killing them?" Z's voice dropped, his tone smooth yet laced with an unnameable menace.

Sophia didn’t answer immediately but countered, "Have you thought of a plan?"

"Of course," Z said without hesitation. With swift keystrokes on the button-laden control panel, he maximized one of the screens. The large face of Xiao Cha filled the display, causing Sophia, who was standing relatively close, to take a subconscious step back due to her sudden lack of aesthetic appreciation.

Seeing her reaction, Z smirked, a hint of satisfaction in his expression. "Do you see that bridge?"

Following his gaze, Sophia squinted and managed to spot a faint outline of a bridge beneath Xiao Cha's ear. "I see it, so what?"

"They're heading toward that bridge," Z switched the display, and the bridge became clearer. The crowd appeared to be coming from the opposite direction, revealing that the bridge was an unavoidable path for Xiao Cha and the others.

Sophia nodded. "Hmm, what do you want to do about it?"

Z leaned against the table, propping his chin on his hand and mockingly chuckled, "The only ones who can safely cross that bridge are the rice noodles."

Sophia froze at his words, looking at him incredulously, her expression a mix of amusement and disbelief.

Z's expression shifted as he turned his back to her. "I was just joking. You don’t have to laugh, but don’t pull that look like you’re having an acute appendicitis either. Are you trying to share that experience with them?"

…She really wanted to shower this rising star of a comedian with affection, but the aura of bitterness around him suggested it wasn’t the right time for that.

"That’s hilarious, I’m dying of laughter," Sophia said half-heartedly before continuing, "But seriously, what do you plan to do? If you’re really committed, then do it cleanly without leaving any loose ends."

Z blinked in surprise, then suddenly turned to face her, his lips curling into a pleased grin, "Oh? You seem quite open-minded now. Normally, wouldn’t you wallow in self-pity and show mercy at the end of every relationship?"

"Are you trying to insult me?" Sophia felt her lips twitch involuntarily. "I’m quite selfish. Remember how I left home without a second thought? I never reached out to the Quantum unless absolutely necessary, right?"

"Do you want to hear what they’re saying about you?" Z asked suddenly.

Sophia paused, "Can we?"

"Nothing is impossible." Z casually tapped a few keys, and the small screen below began to rewind rapidly to a location previously traversed by Xiao Cha’s group. Z pulled up the footage from that area and activated the audio, allowing their conversations to come through clearly.

Sophia soon heard them discussing her, feeling a mix of gratitude that Wang Jie still cared enough to plead for her, and worry that he might turn against her. Sighing, she decided to thank Xie Anjun for his "broad-mindedness" instead.

"You really come off as quite selfish in their eyes," Z said, crossing his arms and leaning back in his chair, his expression neutral. "But every human is selfish. Anyone can be bribed; it just depends on what you’re offering." He waved his hand dismissively, "For instance, to make a minister betray a king, you need to tempt them with power. To persuade someone from their ranks to betray the team and collaborate with us, you need to use feelings."

At that moment, Sophia’s eyes widened in realization. "What you mean is…"

"The fish is already on the hook," Z said leisurely, tapping the table as he watched the expressions of the few on-screen with disdain, as if looking at a group of ants about to be crushed. "As a victor, it’s time to impart some life lessons to them today."

Sophia could only blink in stunned silence.

"This kind of thing is much more entertaining in person," Z suddenly declared, rising to his feet and dragging her along without waiting for her consent.

"Hey? Where are we going?" Sophia was taken aback, feeling like a reluctant dog being led along.

Z smiled mysteriously, narrowing his eyes. "To see how the last few rays of light in this world fade into darkness."

"…"

"What, are you having second thoughts?" Z slowed his pace, a hint of mockery creeping into his tone. "If you can’t make a firm decision, don’t start. Regretting it after you’ve begun will only lead to greater disappointment."

Sophia shook her head. "No, I’m just thinking that if we go there, it’ll be clearer and more comfortable to watch from here."

"Is that so?" Z didn’t seem to believe her, his tone laced with skepticism.

As they continued walking, Sophia explained, "Once you choose to live this way, you have to be prepared for the backlash and extreme responses. There are far worse things in this world, so let them do as they will."

Z calmly opened the door, leading her into an elevator that descended further underground, pressing the button with an unperturbed demeanor. "Don’t worry. As long as you make a decision, whatever path you choose ahead, I’ll pave the way for you."

"Thanks, I’ll let them know you helped me."

"Don’t."

"Why not?"

"Don’t you think it’s embarrassing?"

"…"

Sophia followed Z through the underground elevator until they reached the area beneath the bridge where Xiao Cha and the others would soon pass. They ascended the stairs back to ground level and emerged from a very discreet white room surrounded by an array of cover spots.

"You’re only thirty, how do you have time to create such… such…" She wanted to say something akin to a "guerrilla warfare" labyrinth but thought better of it, knowing it wouldn’t align with Z's aesthetics.

Z observed the activity ahead, commenting, "Did you forget? I received many soldiers at the atomic level."

"…But that was only recently, right?"

"Similar things have happened before," Z replied coolly, his emotions unreadable. Moments later, he glanced at her, his expression flat. "Are you ready?"

Sophia took a deep breath and nodded. "I’m ready."

Seeing her like this, a mischievous thought crossed Z's mind. He grabbed her wrist and said mischievously, "How about this? Let’s meet them and see how your abilities hold up."

"You… you’re joking, right?" Sophia stared at him in horror.

"Not at all. I never joke."

"You just made a joke in the surveillance room!"

He swiftly changed the subject. "Rest assured, these people are too naive. With such naivety, they can’t possibly win against me, so you can enjoy yourself." His tone softened, "Look, I have a kind heart too. I’ve allowed them to live this long."

…Indeed, your "kindness" is just too deeply hidden.

Wang Jie’s alliance with Xie Anjun was certainly not a good sign for her. Although Sophia was technically his daughter in this world, he would turn against his own flesh and blood without a second thought. What could she do? She had been selfish from the start, and now she was simply becoming more ruthless.

As for the others, she was sure that even if she begged Z to spare them, someday when she fell into their hands or they grew powerful enough to eliminate her and Z, they would certainly do so.

Their current "mercy" and "justice" stemmed solely from their lack of resources to eliminate threats.

Z excitedly dragged Sophia forward, boldly confronting Xiao Cha and his group. Upon seeing them, Xiao Cha froze momentarily, while Miyazaki Yusuke exclaimed in surprise, "Everyone, be careful! This could be a trap! Why would they show up here? They might be using this footage to lure us into shooting; don’t move! Shooting could lead to disaster!"

Z's lips twitched as he pulled out a gun and without hesitation pulled the trigger toward Xie Anjun. "Say goodbye to this world, X."

Xie Anjun, hiding behind the others, narrowly avoided the bullet, his heartbeat pounding painfully in his ears.

He couldn’t die here; Little Yue was still hanging on by a thread in Quantum. He had intended to subdue Z first, then find a way for Z to save her since that bullet was his invention. He was certain Z had a way out, and if not, he could always use Sophia to threaten him. But now… he had actually shown up in front of them! And to be so brazen about it! It was infuriating!

"Don’t be too—" Xie Anjun only managed four words before he gasped for air, feeling dizzy as if something was swimming within him. Panic surged in his heart as a troubling idea crept in.

"Tsk, is this all you’ve got? You eagerly threw down the gauntlet without preparing for the backlash," Z remarked with a layered meaning as he raised his smoking gun, pointing the ominous weapon at the crowd. No one dared to move, even though they all had their guns drawn. "How does it feel to have your thoughts and reason corroded by the controller?"

"Enough!" A woman dressed in a hooded cloak and veiled face suddenly stepped forward, arms outstretched in front of Xie Anjun, shouting, "If you want to take me down, go ahead! You want to kill the governor, and that’s because of me, right? Just kill me!"

Z squinted and lowered his gun, scrutinizing her closely. "Miss Hormone?"

The woman was momentarily stunned, unsure how to respond, while Sophia kindly explained to Z, "He’s asking if you’re Yining."

The woman seemed to stiffen momentarily, then nodded and pulled down her veil. Her once-flawless face had aged significantly, her beauty faded like autumn leaves falling from their branches, trampled underfoot.

"I’m already like this—shouldn’t you be satisfied? Why do you still have to make things difficult for Governor Xie? Aren’t we all human? Why must we kill each other? Can’t we coexist peacefully?" She spoke of love and peace, tears brimming in her eyes.

Sophia looked at Z, clearly signaling for him to respond to this pointed question. Z, of course, wouldn’t offer a disappointing answer.

With a cold smile, he held his gun, occasionally revealing two sharp fangs as he spoke. "All humans? Ha! Those who don’t dare to strive forward yet refuse to accept failure—if that’s what you call humanity, then what a terrible humanity it is." He gazed regretfully at Yining. "Please don’t glorify me; I’m not killing Xie Anjun because of you. I’m here to kill all of you."

Yining’s aging face was filled with shock. "Why would you hurt my feelings like this?!"

…Hurt… her… feelings?

Sophia looked up at the sky and murmured, "Come on, don’t confuse lowbrow humor with a sense of humor, Yining. That’s really not cool."

Yining shot her a cold glare. "I wasn’t talking to you; please be quiet."

Before Sophia could respond, Z stepped in front of her, staring at Yining and speaking slowly, "The one who should be quiet is you. You have no right to order her to do anything because she is mine." He spoke calmly and without hesitation. "And by the way, who has hurt your feelings? From the beginning to the end, I’ve only harmed your body."

"…" Yining seemed to lose face in front of everyone, her anger boiling over as she staggered back a few steps. Miyazaki Yusuke supported her, pushing her toward Wang Jie. Now, Wang Jie, who had been trying to remain an outsider watching the situation unfold, was forced to intervene.

Wang Jie, appearing steady and wise, took a few steps forward with his hands clasped behind his back, speaking in a deep voice. "Sophia, come here, to your father." He extended his hand, expecting her to obediently walk into his trap. After all, both her mother and she had always been seen as innocent and weak in his eyes. They were merely burdens if they lacked the ability; it would be better to cut ties early to avoid future heartache.

Sophia met his gaze without hesitation for five seconds before diverting her eyes, a sarcastic smile gracing her lips.

Having read the entire original text, Sophia knew exactly how hypocritical Wang Jie was deep down. After hearing Yining and the others' conversation with Z, he must have already understood her stance. If he truly intended to save her, he wouldn’t be presenting himself in such a nonchalant manner, showing no signs of anger, struggle, or disappointment.

She saw none of those emotions on his face. Suddenly, she felt a deep pang of regret for ever sharing her heartfelt thoughts with someone who wouldn’t truly listen. It was truly foolish.
