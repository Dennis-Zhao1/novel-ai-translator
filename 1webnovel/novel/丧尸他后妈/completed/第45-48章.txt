**Chapter 46**

Eager anticipation and fear can be two sides of the same coin; the one extending the invitation usually harbors more worries and doubts than the one receiving it.

Z's expression remained calm, but his pitch-black eyes narrowed with a cold glint, resembling a deep pool carved with pain and conflict. His face seemed to blur in the dim light, and his voice, deep and husky with masculine allure, cut through the silence, “Tsk, are you hesitating?”

Without thinking, he grasped Sophia's wrist and pulled her forward. “You think I’m really asking for your opinion? I’m just saying it. Don’t take it too seriously. I don’t want to hear anything from you. I like you. That’s all. You have to be with me.”

Three black lines appeared on Sophia's forehead as she was dragged along, struggling to suppress her anger upon realizing he had no intention of changing his ways and had been deceiving her all along. It was as if she were talking to herself, or perhaps intentionally letting him hear her, “Damn it, you’re fooling even me. What a waste of my kindness towards you!”

Z acted as if he hadn’t heard her, instead mocking the figures of Xiao Cong and the others as they scrambled to avoid the encroaching zombies, like a group of clowns. Unable to hold back, Sophia retorted, “Did you not hear what I just said? Can you at least react a little?”

“You can say whatever you want; what I choose to listen to is my business.” Z nonchalantly pulled out the gun holstered at his waist, moving swiftly a few steps ahead, lifting the gun with one hand and aiming without hesitation, pulling the trigger.

Bang—The dark muzzle smoked as the blue-glowing bullet flew far, aimed directly at Jie Anjun. Yet, it seemed that every time he aimed to kill someone, an unexpected variable arose. Last time it was this time too—Yue Taoli deflected the bullet that was about to hit Jie Anjun.

“Xiao Yue!” Jie Anjun paled as she caught the collapsing Yue Taoli, who lost consciousness immediately. The bullet had created a large wound in her chest, blood oozing out continuously, making it look as if she was already dead.

“Humph, troublemaker.” Z sneered, turning to glance at the dazed Sophia, his tone laden with meaning, “Did you see that? If you don’t behave, you’ll end up like this.”

Sophia was stunned into silence for a long moment before finally responding, “Enough already. Do you really find it amusing to threaten me like that?”

Z raised an eyebrow, his gaze heavy on her, pulling her along as he continued forward. The unleashed zombies had already descended from the stage, and Xiao Cong’s group was cornered in a small area of the banquet hall, fighting back with limited weapons.

Z led Sophia onto the stage, stepping onto the lift at one side. The blood-red curtain concealed them, and from high above, Xiao Cong and the others looked like meat on a chopping board.

“Winners flaunt their power, losers end up in a pool of blood. Do you feel it?” Z leaned close to Sophia’s ear, a cruel energy emanating from him, almost uncontrollable, making him feel exceedingly uncomfortable.

Sophia rolled her eyes at him. Truthfully, watching those people being surrounded didn’t bother her at all. Maybe it was because she had been with Z for too long, but ever since Xiao Cong called her a “cheap woman,” she had felt completely indifferent.

Z chuckled softly, not offended. He pulled out a microphone from who knows where and tested the sound switch. “Hello everyone.”

Seemingly satisfied with the sound effects, he elongated his tone, grinning sinisterly into the microphone, which only heightened the already crumbling morale of Xiao Cong’s group. They had gathered a considerable number of state governors, and Xiao Cha barely managed to regain her composure, shouting within the protective circle, “Z! Where have you taken our soldiers?”

“Oh? You still have the energy to care about others at a time like this?” Z feigned a thoughtful smile, casually speaking into the microphone, “I’m a merciful person. Those who should have died are still alive.” He casually pressed a silver button beside the lift, and the cages that had held the zombies started to descend again. Several large iron cages slowly emerged from behind the stage, revealing many people clad in atomic uniforms inside.

Seeing this, Sophia’s heart sank. So, this was originally an ambush for the Atom people, but Z had replaced them with zombies. What a twist...

“They are now my soldiers.” Z declared possessively, a cruel smirk playing on his lips.

Xiao Cong’s team had run out of bullets, while Jie Anjun leaned against the wall, exhausted, clutching the body of Yue Taoli (or was it the corpse?) tightly, her face tense as she hesitated over a bottle she held.

“If you have a last weapon, you’d better use it soon.” Z casually tapped the railing of the lift, stealing glances at Sophia, who seemed lost in thought. Suddenly, he turned off the microphone, “What do you think? They’re almost at my mercy.”

Sophia shot him a sardonic look. “You didn’t ask for my opinion before doing all this, so why should I share my thoughts now?”

“I already know your answer without asking, so I don’t need your input.”

“You think you know me well, huh?”

Leaning casually against the wall, he responded calmly, “Well, sort of.”

Sophia’s expression turned cold. “You say you know me, but you’re not me.” A smile tugged at her lips. “I can accept a lot of things, but the precondition is you damn well need to tell me about them!”

Her words took Z by surprise, but seeing her fierce demeanor only irritated him more. Something violent inside him screamed for killing, torturing, and imprisoning—impulses filled with malice.

At that moment, a loud explosion echoed from below the stage. Someone outside had blown open a hole, and wearing a white dress, Xiao Yayao and Yi Ning rushed in, clad in strange hooded cloaks, hurriedly pulling the trapped people from the banquet hall.

“Looking for death.” Z said, raising his gun toward Yi Ning, pulling the trigger in a split second. The bullet sped through the smoke, and Yi Ning barely dodged the shot thanks to a warning, but it still grazed her shoulder, causing her to scream in pain as she desperately looked towards Z.

“You really need to work on your aim.” Sophia snatched the gun from him, shooting an eye-squinting glare at Z before narrowing her own eyes as she fired. She targeted Xiao Cong since all the other women had already evacuated the banquet hall, leaving him to wrap things up.

The bullet struck Xiao Cong squarely in the chest. Sophia expressionlessly returned the gun to Z, her voice icy, “You can go down now.”

“Go down?” Z seemed in a good mood, a smirk on his lips as he casually twirled the gun. “For what?”

“To collect the body.” Sophia pointed at the fallen Xiao Cong. The zombies had already drawn close to him, and no one else could pull him out. Even if the bullet hadn’t killed him, he would die from the zombies’ bites soon.

“No need for us.” Z glanced at the soldiers trapped in the cages. “I already told you, they are my soldiers now.” He seemed to muse, “I realize I don’t need to do everything myself. It’s okay to let some useless trash handle trivial matters.”

Sophia felt little emotion as she declared, “Then you stay here. I’m going down.”

“You want to leave?”

“Yes. Keep your distance from me.” Sophia deliberately tried to scare him, “I never want to see you again. You deceived me!” This man was truly detestable. She couldn’t forgive him so easily; otherwise, he’d only become more relentless, and there was no doubt about that.

“Tsk, you want to escape too?” Z stepped closer, his expression oddly intense as he stared at her.

Sophia retreated slightly in the narrow lift. “I told you to keep your distance. Didn’t you hear me?”

“I did.” Z closed the gap, skillfully loosening his tie.

An ominous premonition washed over Sophia. “Why are you getting so close...?”

“Not sure what you’re thinking.” Z yanked off his tie and unbuttoned three shirt buttons, tossing the black tie aside. Suddenly, he gripped her wrists, tying them behind her back with the tie in a peculiar manner, leaving a long tail that bound her waist, chest, and under her bust.

“I always feel like when I’m standing next to you, it’s the farthest away I can be.” He chuckled coldly.

“What are you planning?” Sophia was startled by his sudden aggression, her chest pressed against the tied tie, making her more aware of her own curves. Her ears turned red with embarrassment. “I was just joking earlier. You wouldn’t take it seriously, would you?”

“Funny how now it feels like you’re the one joking with me.” Z didn’t believe her, but surprisingly, this time she was speaking the truth.

Sophia regretted her words immensely. Had she known, she would have just compromised rather than complicate things. Women, your name is being pretentious!

“Let me go first. I really...” Before Sophia could finish her sentence, Z effortlessly lifted her and hung her from the beams at the top of the stage. The height of the lift was just right, and she found herself suspended, struggling to breathe.

“Don’t panic. I’ll make you comfortable.” Z smirked, loosening his belt and bending down to lift her legs. She dangled in midair, one leg higher than the other, as he suspended her from the beams.

…… 

Sophia was well aware of the flirtations between men and women, and at that moment, she immediately understood what he intended.

A hanging punishment!? What the hell! Was he planning to **?!!

“I was just joking, Z. Please don’t do this. I’ll apologize, okay? Just let me down...” Sophia weakly tried to appease him, wishing to avoid facing him in such a humiliating position. She thought it would be better to have an Italian chandelier instead!

Z turned her face towards his, gripping her chin with a manic smile, “No.” His voice dropped to a soft tone, “Does apologizing even work? Even if you kneeled before me and begged for forgiveness, I would still feel hurt. I’ve been so good to you, and you just said you wanted to leave me.” He patted her cheek, “But I’ve decided to forgive you. It’s just that no matter what, my heart can never be as it was before you came into my life. I’m giving you a chance to repent.”

Sophia felt frustrated. It was clearly him who had deceived her first yet made her feel like she was the one at fault. How was it that all the blame seemed to lie with her? This world had become a twisted place, and she wasn’t naive enough to cling to any notions of justice. Whether it was due to love or desperation, he was the only one she could trust in this apocalypse, her salvation, her lighthouse. For her survival and hopes, she couldn’t betray her own heart and leave him.

But……

“Enough! I can endure you cursing me or even hitting me, but this is too much! Even a bun has its temper! A rabbit will bite when cornered! Keep this up, and do you think I won’t cry in front of you?” Sophia finally snapped, her eyes welling up.

Z pulled his shirt from his pants and removed his lab coat, revealing a cruel smile. “You really can’t take a scare.” He spoke softly, “I’m the type who takes advantage of every inch. You’ve thought too highly of me, and that has led to your disgust after seeing the real me. But I won’t bear the nauseating feelings that arise from your negligence.” He lowered the rope slightly, causing Sophia’s face to align with his abdomen. He gently stroked her head, whispering, “How about this? Let’s not separate anymore. Besides that gun protecting you, I don’t want anything else.”

Sophia looked up in astonishment. “Really?”

“Hahahaha.” He burst into laughter suddenly, then quickly returned to a blank expression. “How could that be? Of course, I’m just kidding.”

**Chapter 47**

Z unzipped his pants, the black suit trousers hanging loosely between his legs. Sophia stared at the male emblem so close, her throat dry as she swallowed hard.

Then, he forced her to open her mouth and swallow his desires.

“Indulge in this.” Z gasped between words, “If you want to cry, then cry. I want to torment you, make you feel what I feel. This way, you won’t think or say reckless things in the future.” His voice dropped lower, a husky and comfortable whisper, “I’ll only give you one hour. The last hour. If you can’t hold on, don’t blame me.”

Sophia whimpered as he thrust in and out of her mouth, strands of silver liquid escaping the corners of her lips. The scene escalated from suggestive to explicit, and her eyes began to heat with tears—not from sadness, but because…

“Mmm! Too deep!!! I can’t breathe!!!”

Z breathed lightly, smiling as he slowed down his pace and strength, suppressing his voice. “Look at yourself. Without me, what would you do? Foolish, lazy, and dumb—you’re born to be a sidekick, unable to cook a meal, always needing to be carried…” He self-mockingly lowered his face, “Who knows? A woman like you is worth nothing to anyone but me.”

Sophia was thoroughly tormented by him. She was constantly on the verge of suffocation, surrounded by dampness and darkness, while the soldiers below were silent, the zombies had run amok, wreaking havoc throughout the atomic base, and many innocent lives were lost. Yet, she found it impossible to leave his side.

It seemed like people were inherently selfish. When they didn’t like someone, anything they did felt like garbage, but when they fell in love… Ha.

When Z finally released Sophia, she was barely conscious. Her shirt buttons had long since come undone, her chest, neck, and abdomen were smeared with a milky liquid. Z calmly squatted down to help wipe it away, looking at her swollen eyes and the marks on her body, and a feeling of conscience gradually crept up on him. His mind began to clear, and reason flowed back.

…… 

It seemed he had gone a bit too far.

In that moment, he realized he truly had a problem—he liked her so much yet chose to treat her violently. He could tell she wouldn’t really leave him, but he still so cruelly betrayed her feelings.

“Do you hate me?” he suddenly asked.

Sophia had grown weak and didn’t notice his unusual expression. Gritting her teeth, she weakly spat out three words, “What do you think?!”

Z stared at her, silent for a moment before saying, “You should run away.” He pressed the lift button, which began descending. “Run while I’m still sane.”

Sophia was stunned, looking at him in shock as if she didn’t recognize him.

Z’s face darkened, his black eyes hidden beneath his bangs, and the lenses obscured his gaze. His eyes seemed frozen, unable to turn without pain.

“Run. To a place where I can never find you. Do it before I regret it.” He helped her up, guiding her out of the lift, not even glancing at the desperate soldiers in the cages. He moved directly off the stage toward the exit blasted open by Yi Ning and others. “You better hurry and escape while I still remember I love you.”

“Z…” Sophia called out helplessly, but he shook her off, handing her the gun and turning his back to her.

“Go. If you don’t leave this time, I might really kill you next.” Z stared blankly ahead, his sickly possessiveness startling even him. Just a moment ago, he had almost acted to keep her “forever” by his side, and that thought terrified him.

“I won’t leave.” Sophia stubbornly stepped forward to embrace his waist, feeling his rigid body slowly relax. She spoke softly, “I have no way out. You’re my only escape. I can’t figure out where else I can go after you’ve turned me into this. Are you planning to toss me aside after doing this?”

Z looked down at her hands interlocked around his waist, his voice heavy, “You’ll die if you stay.” He forcibly pulled her hands away, “The more I want to keep you, the more I want to kill you, and then keep your body with me so we can truly never be apart.”

Sophia was startled by his words, taking a step back. But as she processed it, she sensed his demeanor had grown colder. His tall and slender figure still faced away from her, slightly tilting his head as if looking at the sky. He slowly said, “I’ll open a safe path for you. No zombies, no dangerous humans. You should leave, go away, and never come back.”

His voice barely audible at the end, he was never good at comforting people, nor did he understand how to heal the heart of the woman he cared for. His love was dirty and heavy, filled with unpleasant emotions and negative impulses. Before, he hadn’t felt it, but now that feeling grew increasingly apparent.

Z sensed something was wrong with his body, his area of expertise being research, he could naturally figure out what was off. Perhaps all 26 of those experimental subjects had failed, but he had only discovered his own abnormality late.

Furrowing his brows, Z took a few steps forward but soon stopped again. He still didn’t turn back, only standing there with clenched fists, “Although I’m letting you go, you will always be my woman. Live well. Don’t look for me, don’t betray me. If you dare to love someone else, even if I kill you and then commit suicide, I will do it.”

Sophia looked at his back in confusion. “Must we consume our feelings through a game of anger?”

Z felt as if he was sinking deeper into a quagmire. He hoped she could save him, but he also wanted to pull her down with him. His dark eyes ached, and taking out his pocket computer, he glanced at it, noticing his eye color had become strange. Something slid silently down, and as he reached out to touch it, it had already slipped to his lips.

He gasped, ultimately revealing a plain smile.

He chose to leave without explanation, disappearing from her sight. Sophia bit her lip, torn for a moment, then stomped her foot and chased after the direction he had vanished.

Damn it! If I’m going to die, then just die! Life has ruined me, and now he has ruined my life. Does he think he can just walk away like this!?

In your dreams!!

**Chapter 48**

Sophia stumbled through the eerily quiet atomic base, searching for Z but finding no trace of him. The banquet hall was in ruins; apart from the soldiers trapped in cages, no one else remained. The soldiers, upon seeing her, lacked the courage to plead for their freedom, as if they had lost all hope in life.

She wandered the stage but found no mechanisms, so she decided to heed their wishes and leave them be.

Sophia exited the banquet hall, considering taking a shortcut back to the room she had at the atomic base. If she couldn’t find Z anywhere, he was bound to be here.

She had a strong feeling that, although she couldn’t find him now, he was everywhere.

When she cautiously opened the door to her room, she indeed found a tall white figure sitting sideways, back to the door, injecting something into his arm with a syringe. His expression was serious, his complexion pale, and dark circles under his eyes grew increasingly pronounced. If it weren’t for his normal body proportions, Sophia would almost suspect he was using drugs.

“What are you doing?” Sophia pushed the door open and rushed to his side, trying to stop him from injecting the unknown liquid. But he had already finished, the syringe left empty.

Z tossed the syringe to the ground, slowly rolling down his shirt sleeves. His fair, slender wrists adorned with an exquisitely crafted metal watch stood out. The cufflinks were missing, likely torn off in haste.

“Earlier you wanted to leave, and now you’re trying to stay? Hmph, women are truly fickle.” Z coldly smiled as he looked at Sophia, his indifference evident. “I’m tired of you already. Get out of my sight, or I’ll kill you.”

Sophia sat beside him, silent for a moment before speaking up, “There are so many excuses for lying, and you give me such a poor one?”

Z let out a mocking laugh, standing up and brushing his hands against his lab coat as if troubled. “I wanted you to see through my lies. Don’t you get it? I find you irritating. Hurry and hate me back. Just get the hell away from me.”

“Is that so?” Sophia nodded, indicating she heard him, and pretended to leave. As she passed him, she felt an increasingly cold aura. She pretended not to notice, counting silently to three in her mind. Suddenly, he grabbed her wrist.

However, the grasp lasted only three seconds before he released her hand, leaning casually against the wall, stiffly saying, “Sorry, it’s a habit.”

Sophia felt frustrated. His demeanor worried her and made her feel suffocated. A surge of inexplicable anger welled up inside her, and she tried to suppress it, telling herself to remain calm, but it was impossible...

Finally unable to hold back, Sophia turned around, standing on her toes to pull him toward her, her expression frozen as she demanded, “What do you want? I don’t believe a single punctuation mark of what you say.”

Z’s eyes were bloodshot, not wearing glasses, and Sophia could clearly see the exhausted look in his eyes, hidden beneath his bangs.

As she loosened her grip, he broke free from her hold.

“When you believed my lies, you swallowed them whole. Now that I’m being honest, you don’t believe me. When I’m normal, you think I’m crazy; when I’m crazy, you think I’m normal. Wang Xiaoshu, you’re truly changeable! I can’t keep up with your rhythm.” Z walked out with his head down, “You can stay here if you want; I’m leaving.”

According to Z’s usual personality, he would never act this way. Sophia combined his previous words and odd behavior in her mind, suddenly recalling he had been injecting something before she entered.

She instinctively turned her gaze to the syringe on the ground, quickly walked over to pick it up, removing the needle and storing it away before rushing out to catch up with Z.

As she passed him, she didn’t say a word, directly grabbing his arm and leading him forward. Under the cover of night, they moved quickly, soon arriving at the entrance of the atomic base. At that moment, there were no guards, the area completely open, indicating that Xiao Cha and the others had already fled, taking some personnel with them.

“Where’s the car?” Sophia looked up at Z.

Z stared down at her, suppressing his feelings. “What do you want to do?”

“Wherever you go, I’ll take you there. It’s unsafe for you to drive in this state.” Seeing he didn’t answer, Sophia strode toward where she remembered the car was parked, “If you don’t say anything, we’ll check the place where we parked initially. You probably haven’t switched locations.”

Sophia pulled Z along as if he were a child, firm and resolute, ignoring his protests or resistance, clearly showing her intentions and determination.

Someone once said that when a woman loves a man, she treats him like her son, while when a man loves a woman, he treats her like his daughter.

The two of them inexplicably got into the Lexus they had driven over. The car was filled with numerous opened machines, indicating Z had completed the massive turnaround in the banquet hall here. Sophia looked at these devices as if reading ancient scripts, not bothering to understand them. She pushed Z into the passenger seat before taking the driver’s seat and driving out of the atomic base.

“We can’t go to the Molecule, Ion, or Quantum. If Xiao Cha and the others aren’t following Miyazaki Yusuke to the Molecule, they must be returning to Jie Anjun’s Ion. The worst-case scenario—the most frightening scenario—is that they’re heading to Quantum.” Sophia analyzed. “My father probably has received the news too. Since your identity has been exposed, after revealing my previous messages to him, I don’t know if he will still believe you. Don’t have too high expectations of him; it’s better to find another way out. We can’t go to Quantum either.”

Z didn’t speak, leaning against the seat, eyes half-closed, his chin raised. His fair neck had a beautiful curve from his chin to collarbone, and his Adam’s apple appeared extraordinarily seductive under the dim light, making Sophia wish she could bite it.

Fair-skinned, beautiful, with a good demeanor—it was clear he was the villain, how annoying.

Sophia drove in silence, casually turning on the navigation system. After a moment of thought, she set the destination to the lab near Quantum, which was currently relatively safe. She had to figure out what was going on with Z.

Oh right, going crazy—he said he was going crazy. Could it really be that literal?

Sophia glanced at Z, who was breathing heavier, her intuition telling her that a storm was brewing.

Suddenly, Z opened his eyes wide, bending down to retrieve a container from the back seat. The container opened, releasing cold mist, and he quickly pulled out a set of syringes and medication, preparing to inject again.

Seeing this happen in just two or three minutes, Sophia instinctively wanted to stop him, but after watching Z inject it, his complexion seemed to improve slightly, so she held back.

After a long while, Z opened his eyes and tossed the container aside. He glanced at Sophia, who was driving silently, and suddenly reached out to touch her face.

Sophia was taken aback, remaining silent; perhaps it was better not to speak at this moment.

“You’re too foolish.” Z seemed to sigh, a captivating smile gracing his lips. His features were exquisite, and his forehead was broad, exuding wisdom and calmness. “You’re such an annoying little thing.”

“Little thing?” Sophia wanted to retort but found herself unable to speak as his drugged state made it impossible for her to respond. He stayed silent for a moment before saying, “Let’s return to your lab in the Quantum area and figure out what’s going on. There are some things you don’t say, and I won’t ask, but we need to find a way to solve them. What are you pretending to be? Are you a robot? Hurry up and calm down to solve the problem.”

Z seemed surprised by Sophia’s perceptiveness this time, looking at her with unexpected admiration. Sophia pretended not to notice, numbly saying, “It’s human nature to vent when under too much pressure. Although your methods are a bit hard for me to accept, if it helps you recover faster, then I can tolerate it.”

Z’s expression turned meaningful. “Don’t you think your current behavior will completely ruin your image in the eyes of those so-called ‘good people’?”

With a chuckle, Sophia recalled the pile of hypocrites and sneered. “Nope. Right now, my entire world is sitting in the passenger seat. There’s nowhere else for me to ruin my future.”

Z squinted at her, his previously dark and despairing expression gradually fading. He had assumed that after the separation, Sophia, with her strong personality, would truly end things. He hadn’t expected her to be so resilient in the face of adversity.

Sophia felt the atmosphere in the car grow oppressive. Z’s presence made her feel like she was walking on thin ice, as if the air conditioning was set to its coldest setting, and she was already cold enough.

After pondering for a while, Sophia half-jokingly said, “Let’s plant some sunflowers in our yard. It’ll feel safer that way. If possible, let’s plant some peas, and we need mushrooms too. If we can find chili peppers, even better. I feel like having a front yard like that is the safest in this world.”

Upon hearing this, Z’s expression twisted, his eyebrows twitching as he turned away to look out the window, seemingly speechless.

Sophia sighed, feeling slightly more relaxed. She slowly said, “I’ve been acting more foolish since I’ve been with you. It’s all your fault.”

Z rubbed his throbbing temple, sounding exhausted. “I’m glad to hear that.”

Observing his small actions, Sophia grew more certain that something was wrong with his health. After hesitating for a moment, she said, “Since I met you, you’ve always been the one helping and protecting me. Now it’s my turn to treat you well.” She softened her tone, “Although there are disparities and mismatches between us, in this world, once you miss someone, you probably won’t find another. I don’t want to dwell on the past anymore. Whatever happens, being cursed or resented is fine because I want to stand by your side.”

With all her courage, she declared, “So from now on, don’t say things that make yourself and others sad. This is my answer to your invitation. Since you’ve spoken it out loud and let others be concerned, you have to take responsibility to the end.”

Z’s heart sank suddenly, his smile freezing. He abruptly said, “Watch out! You’re about to hit a tree!”

**Chapter 49**

Some fates can only be described as karmic ties. You’d think that someone you could never connect with would suddenly appear in your life—not just a passing encounter but a constant presence, always seeking acknowledgment. It would be bearable if they were a good person, but instead, they’re…

Sophia stared at Z in the passenger seat, who seemed to be asleep, silently hoping that this karmic tie would lead to a good outcome.

Carefully, Sophia drove the car. The night was dark, and she focused on the navigation as she made her way through the shadows, driving for over three hours. Around 1 a.m., Z’s steady breathing gradually became erratic. He moved slightly, blearily opening his eyes, rubbing his forehead, his head tilted down, looking incredibly fatigued, as if he hadn’t slept well.

“You’re awake?” Sophia quickly pressed the brakes, pulling the car to the side. She turned off the headlights and opened the interior light, pulling out some food and water she had scavenged from the car. “You must be hungry; eat something.”

Z pursed his lips, frowning as he looked at her. His clearly defined fingers brushed over her palm, gliding over the food but only accepting the cup of water for a small sip, remaining silent.

Sophia thought he didn’t want to eat the compressed food, feeling awkward. “This is all I found in the car. I don’t know where you got hot meals for me before. I thought you cooked them from zombies…”

Z raised an eyebrow at her comment, slightly opening his lips to hoarsely say, “I’m a scientist, not a cannibal.”

“...I was just joking.” Sophia awkwardly touched her face.

Z seemed unamused, his mood clearly low. “Not funny at all.” He turned away, avoiding her gaze. A moment later, he turned back, seemingly restraining himself, “I’m sorry; my attitude hasn’t been good, but I can’t control myself.”

Sophia recalled his previous remarks, realizing things were far more complicated than she had assumed.

“I feel suffocated.” Z sighed, leaning back against the seat, staring ahead with drooping shoulders, looking utterly drained. He spoke in a lackluster tone, “It feels like the calm before a storm, but I have no idea what’s about to happen.”

Sophia frowned, pondering, “Have you been overthinking? Perhaps the reality isn’t as severe as you think?”

Z immediately dismissed her theory, “The reality is worse than this.” His normally dark eyes seemed to have reddened, the blood vessels more visible than usual. “There’s no storm at all. Nothing can challenge me in this world. The issue lies in the absence of anything—nothing will occur; it’s just oppressive.”

Observing Z’s expression and gaze, Sophia set down the food and pressed her hand on his shoulder, attempting to comfort him, but he ignored her entirely, mired in his own thoughts, refusing to meet her eyes.

Feeling anxious, Sophia, in a moment of desperation, suddenly pulled his face down and kissed his pale, dry lips. She traced his beautiful lip line with her tongue, moistening them before withdrawing to catch her breath, gazing at him. “You’re in bad shape.” She stated firmly.

Z squinted at her, lifting his arm to roll up his shirt sleeve, revealing his arm. The skin beneath his fair exterior bore clearly visible veins, especially one that stood out—pulsing as if a tiny creature was crawling underneath, rising and falling in a cycle.

“What… what is that?” Sophia asked, stunned.

Z smirked and pulled his arm back, “Did I scare you?”

“What’s going on?” Sophia’s face paled. “Can you stop pretending to be so capable? Did you inject something into yourself for experimentation? Or have you caught some virus? Just tell me!”

Z leaned closer, his intense presence overwhelming her. “You have the most authority to judge whether I’m capable or not. Do you want me to let your body feel it firsthand? To reminisce about that delightful sensation?”

“T^T Is this really the right time to change the topic?” Sophia felt like crying.

Z stroked her head, calming himself and getting straight to the point. “I can’t tell what’s causing this; I need to do tests at the lab to find out. What you mentioned has happened before, but it was resolved. Of course, residual issues can’t be ruled out.”

“…” Sophia was utterly speechless. “You’re a lunatic.”

“Thanks for the compliment.” Z smiled, but his face told a story of a scientist’s stain.

Sophia, with a headache, picked up the food again. She needed to change the subject; otherwise, the new world’s door would open once again. “Eat something; even if you don’t like it, at least have a little.”

Z glanced at her sideways, his sharp gaze making her feel guilty. She stammered in explanation, “I’m not indifferent to you; I just can’t do what you can, can’t turn this into a roast whole lamb for you, and I can’t find anything better…”

Z raised a hand, signaling her to stop, speaking softly, “Let’s rest here tonight, and we’ll go further later.” After saying this, he exited the car and moved to the back seat. Sophia was still shaken from what she had seen in the banquet hall, hesitating to get out, so she simply passed through the front.

When Z got back in, he caught her in the act, lightly smirking.

“If you’re afraid, just call my name.” He said.

Sophia sat there, momentarily stunned, uncertain how to respond. Z believed she didn’t trust him, recalling everything that had happened that day. He felt pained to have hurt her, so he forced himself to make her laugh, removing his glasses and lowering his voice. “I can fly, I can research, I can shoot down anyone who threatens you.” He adjusted his glasses, “Taking them off lets me see the whole world.”

“And what about when you wear them?” Sophia asked, wrapping her arms around his waist, leaning against him. Though he wasn’t particularly sturdy, he was warm, allowing her to find a comfortable position in the back seat.

Z checked the car locks, turned off the lights, and the surrounding area fell into darkness. He brushed aside her loose hair, his Adam’s apple moving as he spoke, his voice deep and magnetic, “With glasses, it’s four eyes. It’s that simple.”

“Oh, with glasses, you can see the entire universe.” Sophia touched his flat abdomen, reflecting, “Even if you can’t see anything, when I call your name, I feel like nothing can scare me.”

“You didn’t used to think that.” Z’s tone was layered with meaning. “You used to want to eliminate me, avoiding me at all costs. I was a monster, and you were the beacon and the rabbit.” It seemed he was suppressing something, his voice dropping to an eerie level, sending shivers down her spine. “What made you change?”

…… Did she really have to say something cheesy and cliché like “because I love you”? 

Sophia buried her head into his shoulder, realistically giving both herself and him an explanation, “Maybe it’s like you said—life is like this. Having too strong of a moral compass is pointless. Accepting that I’m a bad person is okay, but even after being bad, I still have to live.”

Z listened to her words pensively, lost in thought. Moments later, he felt something wet on his shoulder and frowned, looking down. “Are you crying?”

“No.”

“Then it must be drool.”

“...Just pretend I’m crying.”

That night, Sophia didn’t sleep soundly, but Z’s embrace made her reluctant to leave. In truth, she woke up shortly after and shamelessly nestled against him for a while longer before finally getting up. The clock showed it was still not 6 a.m. She looked up and found Z hadn’t been disturbed by her movements, appearing serene and peaceful, his lips subtly upturned.

Sophia was surprised, fearing to wake him and disrupt this beautiful image. She carefully took the navigation device from the front seat, switched it to photo mode, and quietly captured his sleeping face.

After putting the device back, she gently adjusted his position so he lay on the back seat, pulling out a makeshift pillow wedged between the back seat and windshield, tidying his bangs before returning to the driver’s seat.

He hadn’t woken up even after all that. He must be more exhausted than she thought.

Sophia scrolled through the photos on the navigation device, Z’s clear features displayed prominently. He didn’t look as spirited as usual.

She guessed that he must be experiencing some physical problems, which explained his words and actions. He was behaving so uncharacteristically, even claiming to be unable to control himself. Was he really on the brink of losing his sanity?

As she navigated through the early morning mist, filled with concern, she continued driving, making several small mistakes along the way, but Z remained asleep. She corrected her course quickly each time.

Eventually, she successfully parked outside the laboratory, yet Z still hadn’t awakened. 

It was already past 2 p.m.; he hadn’t woken up. Was something wrong?

Panic surged through her as she jumped from the car to the back seat, brushing aside his fine hair to check his pale face. He was still asleep.

Tentatively, she extended her finger to check his breath, relieved to find a faint but steady rhythm indicating he was merely asleep—not dead… or perhaps he was in a coma?

Sophia contemplated for a long moment, steeling her resolve as she opened the other side of the car door, intending to carry him inside the lab.

She had expected to fail but was surprised to find she succeeded… 

Looking down at Z, laid on the familiar yet unfamiliar single bed, everything felt like it had come full circle to the moment they first met.

She realized her ability to carry him was likely thanks to the powers he had given her. Speaking of which, after he forced that incident on her, she had completely forgotten about her powers. It seemed she needed to practice more; otherwise, it was like having powers without knowing how to use them—wasting his kindness.

Wiping the sweat from her forehead, she squatted by the bed and thought for a long time, deciding to try and see if she could wake him. Although he might just be tired, seeing him like this made her heart uneasy.

“Z?” She gently touched his face, her voice barely a whisper.

At the sound of his name, Z stirred, his brows furrowing slightly as he opened his eyes to look at her, clarity returning to his gaze.

Sophia was surprised. “Were you awake all along?”

“Mm.” Z replied flatly. In fact, he hadn’t been asleep at all.

Sophia was perplexed. “So you were pretending to sleep?”

“Yep.” Z turned on his side, standing tall beside the bed and looking down at her. She had to tilt her head up to meet his gaze, his face backlit, with only the reflection of his glasses visible. “I rarely feel this cared for, so I couldn’t bear to wake up.”

“This…” Sophia didn’t know how to respond, her expression somewhat awkward.

Z’s tone turned serious. “When you’re too strong, people stop seeing you as human, thinking you’re invulnerable to harm, that you live either to destroy or to save the world, and that you don’t know what it means to feel.”

Sophia felt she must have lost her mind; otherwise, she wouldn’t have blurted out something as corny as “Isn’t it that you don’t know what love is?” She realized the internet had warped her perceptions. “I’m sorry!” Sophia quickly lowered her head to apologize. “I messed up again.” Fearing Z might tease her with a line about teaching her what love was, she added, “You’ve said so much, but do you know all this?”

“I do.” Z’s lips pressed together, his expression incredibly tempting and seductive. Sophia’s face flushed as she lowered her head, and he sat down beside her.

“What else can you do?” Sophia asked, feeling oddly shy, wondering why her heart raced like a teenager’s.

Now that she had her head down, she couldn’t see Z’s expression, and confusion filled her when he didn’t answer.

She instinctively raised her head to look at him, repeating her question, “What else can you do?”

I can die. Z’s lips moved, but he didn’t voice this thought.

Sophia thought she had hurt his pride and quickly changed her approach to remedy it. “I asked the wrong question. You probably have enough skills to talk for three days and three nights. What I really want to know is, what can’t you do?”

That question was easy to answer. Z removed his lab coat and, in the process, shed his somewhat disheveled shirt, walking out of the lounge shirtless. His low, calm voice echoed as he left her sight, “I can’t leave you.”
