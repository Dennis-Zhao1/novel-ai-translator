Yusuke Miyazaki had been engrossed in the performance when he caught sight of Sophia Wang and instantly brightened up, interjecting, "Miss Wang! What a pleasure!"

Sophia froze for a moment, "Mr. Miyazaki?"

"Yes, it's me." Yusuke waved his hand casually. "I'm here on behalf of my father to look after Miss Yi. She has a... very close relationship with my father." He hesitated slightly at the word "close," clearly feeling it wasn't quite the right fit, but given Yi Ning's sour expression, he kept that thought to himself and cast a sympathetic glance at Ouyang, almost as if he were wearing an enormous green hat.

Sophia nodded in understanding and turned to Yi Ning with a smile, "So, what about you? Here to find me?"

"Well..." Yi Ning stammered, "When Ouyang and I noticed you were missing, we came looking for you. You can't go back to Quantum, and neither can he."

"Right, so you can't go back either," Sophia nodded thoughtfully. She then looked at Z, "What should we do? It seems like I can't just leave; should I go back instead?" She admitted to herself that she was being a bit spiteful, retaliating for his earlier failure to leave on time.

Z, recognizing the underlying message in her words, blinked his delicate phoenix-like eyes and replied calmly, "I don't think going back is an option right now. Perhaps once this matter is settled, we can consider it. If you don't mind, you can accompany us."

Yi Ning's expression shifted from worry to joy. "Really? What are you guys planning to do? Of course, we want to go!"

"..." Sophia discreetly pinched Z's arm. Faced with his calm demeanor, she found it hard to keep her own composure.

Z, seemingly unbothered, continued, "I've heard that there are four times as many zombies at the Atomic Base compared to other bases. The people there are struggling with a shortage of food and resources. We're thinking of heading over to see if we can help."

Four times? Sophia looked at him in disbelief. His expression remained unchanged, as if he hadn’t just shared such shocking information. When had the Atomic Base become so dangerous? She didn’t recall reading about that.

"What’s going on?" Ouyang frowned immediately, "How do you know this? I didn’t receive any news like that before leaving Quantum."

Z slowly rolled up the car window, "I won’t share my sources with you. If you’re interested, you can join us, but the car is small, so I won't invite you to ride along. Goodbye." As he finished speaking, the window completely closed, and he stepped on the gas, driving off into the distance. Sophia looked back, and soon, Yi Ning and the others were nearly out of sight.

"What just happened?" Sophia asked, voicing her confusion. "Why is there suddenly such a huge problem at Atomic?"

Z merely smiled and said nothing, which made Sophia's teeth grind in irritation. She muttered under her breath as she sat in the passenger seat, "You're really annoying."

Z feigned innocence, "I haven't done anything."

"Exactly! That’s what makes you so irritating." If you had just driven off earlier, would those people still be tailing us? Sophia glanced through the rearview mirror at the rapidly approaching group behind them, feeling increasingly frustrated.

Up until now, Z remained unfazed, seeming to revel in Sophia's irritation. His plan was to teach her a lesson and simultaneously eliminate the competition represented by those who had no right to challenge him. The zombies surrounding the Atomic Base weren’t a new batch; they were just the old ones clustered together. If he could dispatch them while also dealing with Ouyang and the others, he'd earn favor and eliminate potential future threats. It was a win-win situation since those zombies were of no use to him anyway.

However, Z didn’t stay pleased for long. He soon realized he had underestimated Yi Ning’s Mary Sue aura...

That night, as they stopped to rest and regroup, Ouyang aggressively pulled Sophia away, while Yi Ning positioned herself in front of Z, refusing to let him pass. Z seethed silently as he watched Ouyang drag the struggling Sophia away, his expression clearly screaming "I’m done with this!"

...This was so embarrassing! So humiliating! How could he let himself be dragged away like that? Where was his gun? Where were the screams? Where was the chaos? Usually, she was so competent!

"Professor." Yi Ning wore a gentle, beautiful smile. "They have some personal matters to discuss, so we shouldn't disturb them." She abruptly shifted her tone, "By the way... I have something to discuss with you as well."

Z smiled at Yi Ning, but internally he was sharpening his metaphorical knife to stab her. He realized he was reaping what he sowed.

"Move aside; good dogs don't block the way," he said, suppressing his anger and keeping his complexion pale. If it weren't for the complications that would arise from tearing the mask off, he would have long since dealt with her.

Yi Ning frowned at his response, annoyed. "Do you really hate me that much?"

Z exhaled, finally losing his patience. He dropped the facade of indifference and looked at her with a chilling smirk, raising an eyebrow. "Not only do I dislike you, but I also find you quite bothersome."

"You..." Yi Ning stared at him in shock, tears suddenly welling up in her eyes. "Is it because Sophia is the governor's daughter and I'm nothing, that you look down on me?"

"No, not at all. I’ve never even looked at you," Z said, pushing her away with enough force that she nearly stumbled. He walked a few steps, then turned back to her, wearing a mocking smile as he scrutinized her. "Honestly, it's not even a secret. I have a cleanliness obsession; I want to get rid of anything dirty. Especially when I see you." His brow arched, "And don’t even think about making trouble for Sophia. Although I’ve always thought she was incompetent, I won’t allow anyone but me to bully her." With that, he dashed off toward the direction where Ouyang was taking Sophia, not looking back.

Yi Ning watched his retreating figure, his tall and slender frame in a pristine white lab coat fluttering in the wind. That simple silhouette left her smitten, but he showed no interest in her, which was a crushing blow.

After a long moment of staring into space, she slowly clenched her fists, inhaled deeply, closed her eyes, and when she opened them again, her expression was back to normal, though it now carried a hint of barely concealed coldness and determination.

Meanwhile, when Z, with his keen hearing and quick thinking, finally found Sophia and Ouyang, he saw Ouyang pinning down Sophia, seemingly intent on something unspeakable. In a moment of heated impulse, Z rushed over and threw a punch, knocking the seemingly sturdier Ouyang to the ground. Before Ouyang could even register what happened, Z kicked him again, sending him crashing against a large tree, which shook violently from the impact.

Sophia coldly straightened her clothes and brushed off Z's outstretched arm, walking towards Ouyang with a stony expression. She delivered a sharp kick to his abdomen, and Ouyang had no strength left to retaliate, cold sweat pouring down his face as he saw stars.

"Ouyang, I suggest you straighten out your thinking. It's easy to tell the difference between those who like you and those who don't. Those who like you will touch you, while those who don't will only hit or kick you," she said icily before turning on her heel to leave. As she passed by Z, she grabbed his hand and pulled him along.

Z, being dragged back by her, kindly remarked, "Are you really okay just leaving him there? What if something happens? It's not safe here, and he's injured badly."

Sophia paused, staring at the ground in silence for a moment. Suddenly, she turned and threw herself into his arms. "I owe you a thank you, and I'm sorry."

Z stood there in shock, momentarily taken aback, as if his heart skipped a beat. Time seemed to freeze; his existence paused for her.

"I think we can develop a great friendship," Sophia said playfully, looking up at him after a long moment.

In an instant, Z's previous moment of joy and satisfaction vanished. His conflicted and gloomy expression did not go unnoticed by Sophia, who was completely certain of her observation. 

She wasn't foolish; she had been aware of his feelings all along. She just wanted confirmation, and he didn't disappoint her.

After a lengthy silence, Z sighed, "Sophia Wang, don't say things like that. All relationships eventually flatten out into friendship or familial bonds, so this isn't a problem."

"Is that so? Alright then," she accepted his words without further argument, quickly changing the subject. "Will leaving Ouyang there really cause a problem? His behavior was terrible, but I only wanted to incapacitate him, not kill him."

Z countered, "What did he do to you?"

What did he do? Wasn't it just talking bad about you and trying to get physical with her? Ouyang seemed to have been instructed by someone, and he appeared determined to overpower her, likely under Yi Ning's orders. How ridiculous...

"Nothing, let's head back," Sophia said. Since Yi Ning sent him, she wouldn't just leave him there to fend for himself. Perhaps she had already taken him back. And even though she had always thought Z was terrible, she didn't want to hear anyone else say it besides herself.
