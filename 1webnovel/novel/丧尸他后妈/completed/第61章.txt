"Have you ever played a game?" Sophia Wang asked as she powered up the player, looking over at Summer Jiang. "It's called Plants vs. Zombies."

Summer Jiang stared at her, confusion written all over his face as he shook his head. "No, I haven't."

Sophia smiled nonchalantly. "No worries," she replied calmly. "I'll show you how to play. Just this time, I'll be the zombie."

"…"

"Are those the quantum guys you mentioned?" she asked, pointing at the screen where bizarre figures lurched forward like clumsy creatures.

They were well disguised, but frankly, they looked ridiculous—like something out of a folklore tale about wild men in the Shennongjia region.

"Yes," Summer Jiang’s expression turned serious at the sight of them. "There are a lot of them, and the situation is quite dire." He pressed his lips together. "Although I've served Mr. Xiao Cong before, I assure you, I'm speaking the truth. I hope you won’t take this lightly, Miss Wang."

Sophia nodded, acknowledging his concern. Yet, it seemed Summer felt it wasn't enough. "Do you know where Mr. Zhang went? We should inform him about such a significant issue. He might have a good solution."

"You're quite the admirer, aren’t you?" Sophia shot him a sidelong glance, causing Summer to quickly hide his admiration and clumsily explain, "No, Miss Wang, don’t misunderstand. I just—"

"Save the explanations," she waved him off. "He's busy, probably doesn’t have time for us right now. We need to learn to save ourselves." With that, she shut down the computer screen and stood up, stroking her chin as she walked towards the window, gazing at the stormy sky. After a moment of contemplation, she sighed. "But you’re right; we should at least give him a heads-up."

Hearing this, Summer Jiang let out a deep breath of relief. "You’re wise, Miss Wang."

"…” Sophia thought to herself, how was it that if she were the one in charge, it would definitely end in disaster? She wasn’t brainless; she simply didn’t have to show it often.

Despite the conversation ending on a note of politeness, Sophia decided to take action. She turned to the imposing figure of the mech and asked, "Who’s in charge right now?"

It felt off, like talking to a penguin or something.

The mech, known as Vortex, looked down at her, his tone stiff. "It’s me."

"Who are you?" Sophia asked innocently.

"…"

"Alright, enough joking around," she said, straightening her expression. "You’re aware, right? The quantum people are closing in on us, and I felt something was off while watching the footage." She speculated, "They brought a lot of strange tools, and I suspect they have ulterior motives."

Vortex, or rather Z, fell silent again after hearing her analysis, staying quiet for a long time. Finally, he said, "You don’t need to worry about this. I’ll take you away from here. Let them handle it on their own…"

"I want to give it a try," Sophia interrupted him. "I can’t rely on you for everything. You can’t always think I can’t survive without you. You gave me these powers, didn’t you? Even if things get tough, I can still protect myself."

Z flatly disagreed. "You can’t even cure your own illness. No negotiations. We’re leaving now."

As he reached out to take her away, Sophia didn’t resist but asked, "Are you going to use Vortex to take me somewhere else or to find you?"

Without hesitation, he replied, "Somewhere else."

"Then I’m not going," Sophia countered, giving him two options. "Either take me to find you, or let go."

"Sophia Wang, can you not be so willful?" Z seemed genuinely provoked, as if she had pushed him too far. Recently, he had been too lenient with her, allowing her this audacity to openly defy him. "I said you can't go."

Sophia, unable to tolerate it any longer, dodged Z’s mechanical hand and stepped back, fists clenched defiantly. Though she didn’t openly argue back, her entire posture screamed her discontent.

He never seemed to consider his own stubbornness. He could come and go as he pleased, and sending her to his side was one thing, but moving her to another location—what was the point? Did he think her world was just a garden, something to be entered and exited at will?

There were other issues too, but she didn't want to dwell on that.

Sophia looked up at the sky helplessly and said, "Do whatever you want. Send me wherever you like; after all, you're the boss. This relationship of ours is more like a puppet show, with only you enjoying the thrill."

Z remained frozen in place for a moment, his towering figure unmoving. Just as Sophia was starting to get annoyed with the wait, he transformed into a jet and took off, leaving behind the words, "I won’t care about you anymore…"

Sophia stared blankly at the direction he disappeared, feeling utterly helpless.

She wasn’t sure if this was being melodramatic or not, but she felt uncomfortable. There were some things she had heard, but her silence wasn’t due to indifference; she just didn’t want to argue with him. Yet, it seemed like they still ended up fighting.

She thought Z was just speaking out of anger, but he truly didn’t come looking for her for the next three or four days until Summer Jiang found her with urgent news.

"Miss Wang, the quantum troops up ahead might be providing cover; the real main force should be another group!" Summer Jiang said anxiously. "Have you been able to contact Mr. Zhang? What did he say?"

Sophia shot him a sideways glance. "I reached him; he doesn’t care about us anymore."

"…What?" Summer Jiang's expression turned bewildered in an instant.

Sophia stood up with a sense of resignation, grabbing the gun from the table and loading it. "To be precise, he doesn’t care about me anymore." She took a deep breath. "Take me to see where this so-called main force is."

Summer Jiang hesitated for a moment. "I suspect that troop is led by Deputy Xiao… Xiao Cha. He knows the ins and outs of atomic structures, so it’s easy for him to infiltrate." He thought for a moment. "From what we’ve gathered, this troop includes not only Xiao Cha but also Yining from the ions. The rest of the personnel are uncertain; it's hard to tell if they involve any molecules."

"Her again?" Sophia ground her teeth. "Fine, we should take care of her first. I can’t feel at ease knowing she’s still alive."

"Miss Wang…" Summer Jiang looked pained, wanting to say something, but Sophia interrupted his lengthy lecture. "It’s better to take me directly there than to talk about it." With that, she turned and walked out, prompting Summer Jiang to stare at her tall, slender figure in shock before hurriedly following behind.

Xiao Cha moved quickly, presumably worried about his sister, and teamed up with others again.

Sophia watched the monitor screen. Although the details were hard to make out, she could confirm that it was Xiao Cha and Yining. The other figures following them were unfamiliar, but judging by their movements, they were all elite-level fighters.

"There are a total of twenty of them," Summer Jiang reported.

"How many can we deploy on our side? Comparable in combat strength."

Summer Jiang frowned. "Because most of our people are in the front lines, we have a fixed number at the base, and they can’t be moved, so…"

"In other words, we have no one?" Sophia slapped him lightly, nearly knocking off his hat. "I asked how many; I didn’t want a lecture."

Regaining his hat, Summer Jiang awkwardly replied, "I estimate it shouldn’t be more than ten."

"…That’s half the number we need."

"That’s only if we’re moving all the personnel assigned to protect you."

"Forget it." Sophia gritted her teeth. "You stay here and choose five capable ones to come with me." She slipped a mini wireless receiver into her ear. "If there’s any new information, let me know immediately."

Summer Jiang seemed anxious. "This isn’t right. It’s too dangerous! If Mr. Zhang finds out…"

"Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang! Can you stop mentioning him at every turn? Since I’m willing to do this, it means I can handle it. I won’t joke with my life. If you don’t believe me, feel free to send me out alone." Sophia said, storming off without a care for whether Summer would actually let her go without backup.

How could Summer Jiang disregard her safety? He not only brought in ten people but also followed her.

In truth, he had been overly pessimistic. With Sophia’s powers combined with the handgun, she was practically unstoppable. On their way, zombies and enemies were easily pushed back. Summer Jiang watched, finally feeling reassured.

Indeed, those who followed Mr. Zhang were not weaklings. He couldn’t understand why Mr. Zhang always thought Sophia couldn’t survive without him. What about the rest of the world?

Summer Jiang didn’t grasp that once a man falls in love with a woman, he often believes she cannot thrive without him.

Sophia wiped the blood splattered across her face, gazing at the approaching figures of Xiao Cha and his team. They were down to less than ten now, their numbers dwindled, ensuring their loss was imminent.

Sophia breathed a sigh of relief, finally feeling she had accomplished something. Although there were still significant challenges ahead, she had at least proven she wasn’t totally useless. She had the ability to protect herself, even if the one who gave her that ability was Z.

"Sophia Wang?" Yining spotted her instantly, her frame slender and tall in the hooded cloak. Sophia couldn’t help but grimace; what kind of ridiculous outfit was that for battle? Was she really going for a Mary Sue vibe, believing she could win despite such impractical attire?

"Miss Yining," Sophia raised her gun, standing firm in front of her team, her expression cold. "It’s time to say goodbye." Without waiting for Yining to respond, she pulled the trigger, and those with Xiao Cha instinctively dodged, moving away from Yining.

Not exactly a united front, were they? It seemed like nobody cared about An Jun; they were all too eager to distance themselves from Yining.

Sophia couldn’t find the words to express her current feelings. Her bullet didn’t utilize her powers, but it struck Yining, blood seeping from her shoulder as she stared at Sophia, pale and shocked.

"Consider this shot as repayment," Sophia gritted her teeth. "From now on, we owe each other nothing."

Sophia snorted. "You owe me too much. You poisoned the water supply back with the molecules, didn’t you? After all those 'good deeds,' do you think a single shot can settle the score?"

Yining's eyes widened in disbelief. "How did you know?"

"I know far more than you think." As Sophia approached, she glanced at Xiao Cha. "Mr. Xiao, you might want to stay put. I’ll take care of your sister’s issue shortly. I promise she’ll be safe."

Xiao Yaya must have been relocated by Z; otherwise, Xiao Cha wouldn’t have made that promise if she were in danger. Sophia felt confident Yining wouldn’t pull any tricks since she trusted Z’s abilities.

As expected, upon hearing this, Xiao Cha halted, his followers stopped in their tracks. Yining’s personal guards dwindled to four or five, each formidable in their own right.

"Alright then," Yining sighed. "Let’s settle our debts today." She gripped her gun, aiming it at Sophia.

Sophia had no intention of letting her point it at her, so the moment Yining moved, she fired again, this time using her powers.

A tremendous explosion erupted, throwing the scene into chaos. Yining barely dodged, almost losing her life due to her own subordinates.

"When did you get this kind of ability?!" Yining stared at Sophia in disbelief.

Sophia ignored her, continuing to fire. The ensuing melee was chaotic, making it hard to distinguish friend from foe, likely due to some kind of bullet infused with hallucinogens.

With narrowed eyes, Sophia targeted Yining amidst the confusion. Her hands were sore from firing so rapidly, yet she pushed through the tremors and aimed at Yining, who was currently engaged with Summer Jiang.

It was a fatal shot. It seemed destiny had decreed that Yining’s life could only be ended by her. Z had made several attempts on her life before, but this time, Sophia truly killed her.

Yining's face was a mask of shock as she clutched her gun, slowly collapsing to the ground. Her guards were all captured by Summer Jiang’s men.

Xiao Cha stood to the side, watching the scene unfold with a complex expression in his eyes as he regarded Sophia.

Sophia approached Yining's body, reflecting on everything she had encountered since arriving in this world, feeling as if she were in a dream.

She felt a bit dazed, but it didn’t stop her from noticing a rush of air whizzing past her ear, the sharp sound of bullets colliding ringing painfully in her ears. She quickly sidestepped, realizing a tree behind her had been felled, two bullets embedded deep in its trunk.

Two bullets?

Sophia followed the trajectory of one bullet back to its source, spotting Z’s tall figure emerging from the shadows. He expressionlessly held his gun, firing accurately in her direction without so much as a blink, his focus unwavering.

Summer Jiang watched as bullets zipped through the grass, screams erupting around them, the scent of blood saturating the air. Clearly, many had been ambushed there.

"Mr. Zhang!" Summer Jiang was overjoyed at the sight of Z, rushing forward to say something, but Z simply bypassed him and approached Sophia, casting her a sidelong glance. "Seems like everything’s under control. If that’s the case, why rush me back? You made me worry for nothing."

Was this a reconciliation? Sophia forced a smile that didn’t reach her eyes, then turned her head stoically toward Xiao Cha. "The person you were looking for has arrived. Why don’t you ask about your sister’s whereabouts?"

As for Z… she felt their relationship had become far too harmonious, transcending all boundaries, and it definitely needed some adjustments.
