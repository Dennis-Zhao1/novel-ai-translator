**Chapter**

"Why think about forever?" Z murmured, breaking the heavy silence that hung between them. "In this apocalyptic world, who can truly be with someone forever? The person you saw just yesterday could be gone tomorrow, leaving behind nothing but memories. No one knows when a goodbye will turn into a final farewell. But… even so, if it were possible to stay together, who wouldn't wish for an eternity without parting?"

Sophia Wang lowered her gaze to the ground, her delicate fingers gripping the chains of the swing tightly. A soft flush crept over her fair cheeks, and she remained silent, keeping her head down as she sat there. Her long legs gently kicked against the ground, leaving faint imprints in the dust, as if she were reluctant to face the atmosphere that surrounded them.

Z slowly crouched down beside her, leaning in to catch a glimpse of her profile. His eyes wandered through her soft locks, trying to read the emotions hidden beneath her lowered brows. Yet, he found himself ensnared by a tender but intense magnetism. His hands wrapped cautiously around her waist, restrained yet gentle, as if he feared she might slip away or that he might lose control.

"Why are you looking down?" His voice was low and soft, almost a whisper, as if he were testing the waters.

"Nothing," Sophia replied quietly, still not lifting her head. The tips of her ears had already turned a faint pink.

Z’s gaze swept over her, a mix of emotions swirling within as if he had more to say. Ultimately, he drew a little closer, arms tightening softly around her, pulling her just a bit nearer. His movements were slow, as if he were waiting for her response, or perhaps holding himself back.

"Sophia Wang," he said softly, his voice raspy yet warm, "do you think I’m trying to take advantage of you by getting closer?"

"…Isn't that the case?" She finally raised her head, her eyes clear yet laced with a hint of defiance, locking onto his.

Z was taken aback for a moment, then let out a helpless chuckle. "Maybe. But what if I told you that I'm close to you because I'm afraid of losing you? Would you believe me?"

Sophia didn’t respond, merely gazing at him, as if waiting for a deeper explanation.

He lowered his gaze, a complex tone threading through his words. "This world is crumbling. Every day, people die; every day, people disappear. I'm not afraid of that, but I fear that one day, you might vanish like they do."

An invisible weight hung in the air, much like the cool night breeze that brushed past the swing, yet it felt stifling, as if breathing became a chore.

"Are you afraid of me leaving, or are you afraid that I might hate you?" Sophia's voice was barely above a whisper, yet it jolted Z, causing him to lift his head sharply. His eyes sparkled like a starry night, revealing an inner turmoil interwoven with deep affection.

"I don't know," Z admitted after a long pause. "Maybe it’s both."

Sophia was momentarily taken aback, her instinctive retort caught in her throat. Looking at the man who usually exuded confidence and decisiveness, she was surprised to see such vulnerability etched on his face. A whirlwind of complex emotions surged within her, leaving her unsure of how to respond.

"Please don’t do this," she said softly, lowering her eyes. "You make it… hard for me to know what to do."

Z hesitated for a moment, his hand lingering before he finally let go of her. He stepped back, his gaze a blend of emotions as he murmured, "I'm sorry. I didn’t mean to put you in a difficult position."

Sophia raised her head, watching as he turned to walk into the encroaching darkness. A sudden impulse to call out to him surged within her, but she held her tongue, tightening her grip on the swing's chains. The cool breeze swept across her cheeks, carrying away the warmth that lingered between them.
