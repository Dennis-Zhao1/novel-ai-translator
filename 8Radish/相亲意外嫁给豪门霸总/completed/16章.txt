**Moving In Together**

After wrapping up his last meeting, Ethan Clark hurried out of the office, feeling a rare sense of freedom since he didn’t have to stay late today. Just a few minutes ago, he received a text from Ivy Gonzalez.

*“I’m at your front door.”*

Without taking the time to respond, Ethan rummaged through his desk drawer, grabbed a random car key, and zoomed off to his new place with Ivy. It was a house he had just bought, and he hadn’t even seen it in person yet. Luckily, it was only a fifteen-minute drive from work.

Ding—

The shiny elevator doors slid open to reveal Ivy sitting cross-legged on the floor, tying her hair into a high ponytail. Next to her were two oversized suitcases. She was munching on some fast food when she looked up and flashed him a smile. 

“Wow, you got here fast!”

Ethan frowned slightly. “You’re eating that?”

Ivy glanced at her meal, puzzled. What was wrong with fast food? But being in his territory, she didn’t want to argue, so she quietly closed her takeout box, stuffed it into a bag, and held it behind her.

Ethan made his way to the front door, rapidly inputting the code while muttering, “The code is 110413.”

Ivy nodded, mentally jotting that down. He pushed the door open, gesturing for her to step inside first.

As Ivy entered the living room, she looked around, noticing it had about as much personality as a blank canvas. The sofa was still wrapped in plastic, and aside from the essential large furniture pieces, the place felt eerily empty—bright and spacious, but devoid of any lived-in warmth.

She thought, *Ethan probably doesn’t actually live here. Thank goodness; I’m not ready to share a space with him yet.*

When Ivy saw Ethan lifting her bags, she rushed over. “No, no! I can handle it! You should go back to whatever you were doing!”

Ethan set her suitcases down and raised an eyebrow at her. “Go back where? This is my house.”

Ivy, still not convinced, pressed further, “You actually live here?”

Ethan smirked. “Yep.” He strolled into the unfamiliar space, and as it dawned on him how empty it felt, he turned to Ivy and said, “You should know, I’m a bit of a neat freak.”

Ivy shot back from behind him, “No kidding.”

This house was easily much bigger than Ivy’s place, located in a neighborhood known for its wealthy residents and top-notch privacy. She wasn’t surprised that Ethan had a place here.

The house had two floors, and Ivy decided to claim one of the upstairs bedrooms. 

Sitting on the bed, she ran her fingers over the fluffy comforter, her gaze sweeping the room, feeling like she had stepped into a dream. She closed her eyes and flopped down, letting out a long sigh of relief. After a long day of moving, she was so tired that even smiling felt like a chore. After a quick rest, she jumped up, opened her suitcase, and grabbed some clothes to hang in the closet, catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror.

Suddenly, it hit her—this wasn’t her home. Why was she even unpacking? She was just a fleeting fancy for Ethan, a beautiful toy he bought on a whim.

Ivy stuffed her clothes back into the suitcase, put on some glam makeup, and slipped into a stylish emerald green dress, then trotted down the stairs.

Ethan lounged on the couch, long legs stretched out, twirling a car key in his fingers. When he heard her footsteps, he glanced up, his eyes widening as he took in Ivy’s new look.

He’d never seen her like this before; her red lips and dark hair made her skin look even paler, and the slight flick of her eyes exuded an air of cool detachment.

He deliberately averted his gaze from her face, feeling a bit awkward. “Let’s head to the supermarket and pick up some essentials.”

“Supermarket?” Ivy blinked, confused. Did he really think she dressed up just to go grocery shopping? That was a stretch.

As the clock crept closer to her work time, Ivy quickly slipped on her shoes and turned to him. “Sorry, I have to run some errands. You’ll have to go to the supermarket on your own.”

Ethan felt like she had splashed cold water on his face. He had been looking forward to going to the supermarket together, picking out items to fill their new home—like a cute little domestic scene he had imagined for their future.

Standing in the doorway, he blocked her path, his voice low but firm. “Where do you think you’re going at this hour?”

Ivy rolled her eyes; she had to tilt her head back just to meet his gaze. “I’m off to make some money,” she forced a bright smile and darted under his arm, making her escape.

As he turned to ask another question, Ivy was already in the elevator, leaving him alone.

With a scowl, Ethan pulled out his phone and checked the intel Jason Brooks had sent him, convinced he must have missed something about Ivy. After reading through it a couple of times and finding no mention of where she worked, he tossed his phone onto the couch in frustration. 

He growled under his breath, “Jason, you better keep an eye on Ivy. How hard can it be to follow her?!”
