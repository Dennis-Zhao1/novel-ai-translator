**Title: The Hangover Hustle**

Ivy Gonzalez was wide awake, and let me tell you, it was a chaotic scene unfolding before her. Clothes, shoes, and belts were strewn everywhere, like a tornado had hit a closet. 

In the middle of this mess were two people scrambling to get dressed, their clothes almost forgotten as panic set in. Ivy, however, was unfazed. She stood to the side, phone in hand, documenting the scene like a crime reporter. Her eyes were full of disdain as she focused on the guy, snapping picture after picture for evidence.

That’s when she noticed Olivia Price's daughter peeking through the door. Thankfully, Ethan Clark had taken the girl outside, shielding her innocent eyes from the wreckage. But that didn’t stop the kid from crying out for her mom, twisting and squirming like a little fish desperate to swim back home. It tugged at Ivy’s heartstrings, and she felt a pang of sympathy for Olivia, who was about to go through a tough patch as a single mom.

After they managed to calm Olivia down, Ivy stood at the hotel exit, watching the mother and daughter walk away. She felt oddly composed, but her mind was racing. 

“Marriage is just a complete lie, isn’t it? All those vows mean nothing against a moment of fun,” she murmured under her breath. Thinking of Olivia’s struggles in this world, where raising a child alone felt like climbing Everest, Ivy couldn’t help but feel a wave of nostalgia for her own childhood with her mom. 

Beside her, Ethan Clark was as stoic as a statue, seemingly unfazed by Ivy's commentary. When their eyes met, his gaze was deep and unreadable, like staring into a bottomless lake. He was studying her, trying to see through her facade. Then, with a sly smile, he teased, “What’s going on in that little head of yours?”

Ivy snapped back to reality, realizing she hadn’t even asked for a couple of extra days off work. She had planned to rush back home tonight, but now that plan was out the window. She pulled out her phone and dialed Sophia Bennett, saying to Ethan, “Hold on, I need to make a call.”

The phone clicked and Sophia picked up immediately, as if she were glued to her phone 24/7. Ethan pretended to be nonchalant, kicking at a pebble on the floor, but he was all ears.

After a quick chat where Ivy politely declined her boss’s offer to help, she hung up. Ethan raised an eyebrow, “You two are pretty close, huh?”

Ivy frowned, thinking it was a silly question. “Well, she is my boss!”

Before he could pry further, Ivy interrupted him excitedly, “Oh! Olivia said her dad is coming tomorrow to help me change the locks!” She did a little dance of joy because she had been worried no one would want to take on the task.

Suddenly, Ethan’s demeanor changed. His face turned serious. “Changing locks in secret? Doesn’t sound right.”

“Why not? It’s my house!” Ivy shot back, annoyed. “If you think it’s such a bad idea, then don’t show up! I’m going with Olivia’s family tomorrow. You clearly don’t understand what it’s like for people like us.”

With that, Ivy tossed Ethan’s hand off her arm and stormed back to her room. He stood there, stunned. To him, money and houses had always been easy to come by. He had never had to fight for anything, and this situation was something he couldn’t quite grasp.

Meanwhile, at the end of the hotel corridor, a flickering light caught Ivy’s attention. She grumbled about the place being the “best hotel” with such shabby maintenance. Once inside her room, she flopped onto her fluffy bed and buried her face in the pillows, letting out a muffled groan.

Usually, Ivy wasn’t one to ignore advice, but Ethan’s condescending attitude about her life choices rubbed her the wrong way. He always seemed to have a problem with everything she did, and it was driving her nuts. But deep down, she knew that if it weren’t for him, she wouldn’t even be in this crazy situation.

As she scrolled through TikTok, her mom, Grace Peterson, leaned over from her own bed, sensing that something was off. “What’s wrong? Can’t figure out the house situation?”

Ivy sighed, “Nope, nothing like that!”

Grace relaxed at that and leaned in closer, her curiosity piqued. “So, why are you and Ethan sleeping in separate rooms? I mean, that bed is tiny! I can’t even sleep in peace!”

“Mom!” Ivy exclaimed, half-amused and half-frustrated. “I’m just going to grab us some food. You hungry?”

Before Grace could answer, Ivy was already up and out the door, not wanting to dive into that conversation.

She made her way to a popular restaurant nearby, ordering a bunch of food—something her mom would love and a little something for Ethan. She made sure to customize Ethan’s meal to his picky specifications: just a hint of spice, no onions, and definitely no pork. She had never met someone so particular about food before.

Once she returned, Ivy stood outside Ethan's door, hesitating for a moment before mustering up the courage to knock. The door creaked open, and Ethan looked taken aback to see her.

Before he could say a word, she walked right in and placed the food on the table. The room was filled with that signature woodsy, smoky scent he carried with him, creating an oddly soothing atmosphere.

Ivy’s gaze fell on his tablet, which was lit up, and she noticed a half-empty bottle of wine on the side. “Working?” she asked, curious.

Ethan’s eyes were slightly glazed over, and he just stood there, looking at her. Ivy felt her cheeks heat up under his gaze. She fidgeted with her hands, trying to break the tension. “I’ll let you get back to it. Just remember to eat!”

Just as she turned to leave, Ethan grabbed her hand and pulled her closer, pinning her against the wall. Their faces were inches apart, and Ivy could smell the wine on his breath.

“Are you awake now?” she murmured, her heart racing.

He didn’t answer her question. With a smirk, he leaned in and captured her lips in a kiss, leaving her breathless.

And just like that, everything changed.
