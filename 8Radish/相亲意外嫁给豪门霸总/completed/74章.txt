**Come Live with Me**

“It's because of work!” 

Ivy Gonzalez rolled her eyes in her head. Great, now her divorce was going to be even more complicated. What was supposed to be a quiet resolution had turned into a public spectacle of a lovey-dovey couple. Seriously, who were they kidding? 

“Guess that's why people say to think twice before getting married,” Ivy sighed, perched on a stool at her favorite dive bar. It felt like ages since she’d last been here. The bar hadn’t changed much, except for a few clusters of winter blossoms at the entrance that added a touch of charm.

“Marriage really is pointless; it always ends the same way,” chimed in Emma Ward, leaning against the bar and swirling her drink. After a pause, she added, “But Ethan Clark? Can’t say much good about him.”

Ivy raised an eyebrow. “Let’s not talk about him.”

She turned to survey the room, which was oddly quiet compared to the bustling nights of the past. “There are way fewer people here now.”

“Yeah!” Emma took a sip, her tone tinged with frustration. “There are so many new bars popping up around here. We charge too much; we can’t compete.”

Ivy nodded, acknowledging her friend’s struggle. Business wasn’t her forte, so she kept quiet and shifted her gaze to the stage, noticing that the performer wasn’t someone she recognized.

“Is Michael Wood still playing here?” Ivy asked.

“Michael?” Emma’s voice turned icy, dripping with sarcasm. “Who knows which rich girl he’s buttering up now after ditching Little Moon.”

“What?!” Ivy’s eyes widened in disbelief. “I thought he and Little Moon were serious!”

Emma clenched her teeth. “Little Moon cried for three days straight. She did everything for him—saved money to buy him instruments! And that heartless guy said he felt embarrassed being with her. Off he went, chasing after some rich beauty.”

Ivy slammed her palm on the bar. “He’s shameless! Little Moon should demand he sell his instruments to pay her back!”

Emma sighed heavily. “Little Moon quit her job and went back home. No chance she’ll keep in touch with Michael now.”

Fuming, Ivy downed her drink in one go, letting the alcohol ease her frustration. She was so tipsy by the time she stood up, swaying a bit, that Emma called after her, “Are you sure you can get home alone? I’ll call someone to drive you!”

“No… I can walk,” Ivy waved dismissively, but her words slurred together, and she stumbled out the door.

Emma had no choice but to dial for a ride.

Ivy’s neighborhood was old, and the streetlights barely illuminated her path. She switched on her phone's flashlight, using the weak beam to navigate. As she walked, a sense of dread crept in. 

Was someone following her? Her heart raced as she recalled a previous incident where she had been stalked. She cast cautious glances over her shoulder, noticing that whenever she paused, so did the footsteps behind her.

Panic surged, and the effects of the alcohol began to wear off. She looked around, realizing there wasn’t a single open shop in sight. “What kind of neighborhood is this? Not even a 24-hour convenience store?” she muttered angrily.

With no other choice, she decided to sprint toward the entrance where there was a security guard.

But the footsteps behind her quickened, and before she knew it, someone was right in front of her, grabbing her arm.

“Ah!” 

Ivy swung her bag at the figure, yelling for them to let go.

“Why are you running?” 

Wait—was that Ethan Clark’s voice? Ivy dropped her bag, blinking in confusion.

“What are you chasing me for?” she shot back, sounding more indignant than she felt.

Ethan chuckled. “You were running, so I ran after you.”

Ivy shot him a glare. “So childish!” With that, she turned on her heel and continued her trek home.

After a few steps, she glanced back, surprised to see he was still there. “Why aren’t you leaving?”

“It's dangerous for you to walk home alone,” he replied, his tone serious.

Ivy raised an eyebrow at him. “Have you thought about the fact that you might be the most dangerous person to me right now?”

Ethan paused, a smile creeping across his face. He took a few steps back, and Ivy nodded in satisfaction.

Once she got inside her apartment and the lights flickered on, she felt a wave of relief wash over her. She peeked out the window and spotted Ethan walking away, his brisk pace quickly swallowing him up in the night. Her heart fluttered unexpectedly, and she shut the curtains, flopping onto her bed and drifting off into a deep sleep.

That night, Ivy dreamt of the old villa Ethan had taken her to once. The flowers in the garden had turned a stark white—she had never liked white flowers. In her dream, Ethan was leading her through, and suddenly, she spotted Liam Harris dressed oddly in a cheap blue shirt, standing out like a sore thumb. He looked at her and simply said, “Goodbye.”

The next morning, Ivy woke up with a pounding headache. 

Stumbling to the bathroom, she barely heard the knocking at her door until the third knock jolted her back to reality.

When she opened the door, it was Jason Brooks, looking as formal as ever.

“Miss Lin, Mrs. Xu requests your presence for a meal.”

“Mrs. Xu?” Ivy leaned against the doorframe, puzzled. Why would Mrs. Xu suddenly want to see her at the Xu family mansion?

Jason, sensing her confusion, clarified, “Mrs. Xu is Ethan’s mother.”

As Ivy sat in the car, her mind raced with possibilities. Could they be announcing her marriage online? The thought made her stomach turn. Although Mrs. Xu hadn’t been openly hostile the last time they met, Ivy had only been to the Xu estate once before, and that visit hadn’t gone well at all.

“Jason Brooks, does your boss know about this?” Ivy asked cautiously.

“Don’t worry, he’s been informed,” Jason replied, eyes focused on the road.

Ivy tugged nervously at her collar. What was there to worry about? It was just a meal—how bad could it be?

Upon arriving at the Xu family mansion, Ivy was led into the grand hall where Mrs. Xu sat at the center. She slowly lifted her gaze as Ivy entered, her expression unreadable. “You’re here.”

Mrs. Xu walked into the dining room, and Ivy followed, watching as the servants efficiently set the table with delicate dishes of plain porridge and small side dishes, all artfully arranged.

Ivy couldn’t help but think, “People are all about presentation—just like food on a fancy plate.”

Mrs. Xu gestured for Ivy to sit. 

“Our family is indeed wealthy now, but we’ve known poverty before. One mustn’t just enjoy the lavishness of life but also appreciate the simpler things. It’s important to be content and not just take from others.”

Ivy blinked, caught off guard. She hadn’t asked for anything—why was she getting a lecture?

Mrs. Xu continued, “Since Ethan chose you, I accept that. But I have one request: please avoid any unsavory activities. That streaming business of yours? You can stop that. The Xu family doesn’t need your money. Find a time to move in with me instead.” 

And just like that, Ivy felt her world tilt on its axis.
