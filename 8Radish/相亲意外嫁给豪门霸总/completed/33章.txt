### Not What You Think

Lucas Smith watched Ethan Clark storm out, feeling a knot tighten in his chest. Did he really just hear that? They were getting married? Seriously? He couldn’t believe it. Ivy Gonzalez had practically thrown her life away for him, rushing back home to get divorced, and now this? It felt like he was one step too slow, and he was not happy about it. What did Ethan have that was so special? 

As Ethan burst through the door, Ivy had already taken off. The parking lot outside was deserted except for Jason Brooks, who was holding an umbrella like it was a shield. When Ethan reached him, Jason stuttered, “Miss Ivy took off in a car… she just drove away!” 

“Seriously?” Ethan snapped, his frustration bubbling over. “You couldn’t stop her?” 

Jason threw up his hands. “I tried! But she wouldn’t listen!” 

Ethan's heart raced as he dashed to the garage, grabbing the first Maserati he could find. He slammed the gas pedal to the floor, the engine roaring to life as he tore out of the garage. The streetlights blurred past him, and the world outside turned into a hazy blur, snowflakes dancing in the air. 

Suddenly, he was hit with a memory—a dark image of Noah Scott lying in a pool of blood. It felt like a punch to the gut, and the pain shot through his head like a lightning bolt. He hadn’t thought about that in ages. He couldn’t let Ivy end up like that. No way. 

He pressed down harder on the accelerator, his mind racing. 

Meanwhile, Ivy was behind the wheel of Ethan's car, racing down the road. She wanted to escape the luxurious mansion that felt more like a prison every day. The snowstorm outside matched her mood, and her thoughts drifted to what Ethan’s mother had said. The reality of her situation hit her hard; the gap between them felt insurmountable. 

Driving a fancy car didn’t change that. For Ethan, losing it wouldn’t even be a blip on his radar, while her old clunker made her cringe every time someone even brushed against it. 

“I just want to disappear from his world,” she muttered to herself, feeling the adrenaline as she pushed the car to its limits. 

But then, a car pulled up alongside hers, honking furiously. She glanced over, and there was Ethan, his face a storm of anger. His jaw was clenched, and if he could've jumped out of his car to grab the wheel from her, he probably would have. 

“Pull over!” he shouted, waving his hands like a traffic cop gone rogue. 

Ivy rolled her eyes and pressed the gas even harder. No way was she going to give him the satisfaction of stopping. Ethan, however, wasn’t going to let that happen. He swerved in front of her, blocking her path. 

Her heart raced as she slammed on the brakes, nearly colliding with him. “What the hell?” she yelled, throwing open her car door. “Are you trying to kill us both?” 

Ethan shot her a look that could melt steel. “You’re the one driving like a maniac!” 

“Excuse me? You’re the one playing traffic cop!” she shot back, pointing a finger at him. 

He looked at her, eyes wide as if she was the one being ridiculous. “You don’t care about your life, so why should I?” 

Ivy felt her irritation bubble over. “My life is all I’ve got! You think I’m just some pawn in your game?” 

Ethan’s expression shifted, and for a second, he almost looked vulnerable. “But you said you liked me!” 

The audacity! She was tempted to roll her eyes so hard they’d get stuck. “I’m only doing this for the money, remember? You can’t say that I’m just some lovesick fool!” 

He stepped closer, his voice dropping. “Ivy, if you liked me so much, why are you trying so hard to run away?” 

“Because I can't keep pretending!” she yelled back. “You want me to declare my undying love, but I’m not some character in a cheesy romance novel!” 

Ethan crossed his arms, looking both amused and frustrated. “Fine! Say you like me a hundred times a day, and we’ll see if it’s true!” 

Ivy blinked, unsure if he was serious or if this was some strange prank. “Are you insane?” 

“Just humor me,” he said, smirking. “You might find it’s easier than you think.” 

“Ugh! This is ridiculous,” Ivy groaned, shaking her head. “You’re the worst!” 

Ethan just grinned, leaning against his car, looking like he was enjoying this way too much. “I’ll take that as a yes. Now get in the car.” 

Ivy hesitated, but the warmth of the car was tempting, and she was freezing. As she climbed in, she couldn’t help but wonder if maybe—just maybe—this wasn’t all a total disaster. 

After all, how many times could she roll her eyes at a guy who was just trying to get her to admit she liked him? 

“Okay, fine,” she sighed, crossing her arms. “I’ll say it… once." 

Ethan raised an eyebrow, clearly not satisfied. “A hundred would be better.” 

“Fine! I like you! Happy?” 

“Not yet,” he said, smirking as he started the engine. “Let’s see if we can get you to say it a hundred times before the day is over.” 

As they drove off into the snow, Ivy couldn’t help but smile. This might turn out to be more entertaining than she thought. Who knew love could be so… complicated?
