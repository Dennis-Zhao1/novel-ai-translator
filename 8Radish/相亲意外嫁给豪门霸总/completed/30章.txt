**You Want Me to Go?**

As soon as Lucas Smith left, Ethan Clark's phone buzzed with his mom's call. 

"Hey, Ethan! Don’t forget to bring Ivy Gonzalez home this weekend! What kind of married couple never visits their family?" 

Her voice was like a car alarm—high-pitched and impossible to ignore. It hit him like a ton of bricks; he had never once mentioned bringing Ivy home to his mom. To him, marriage felt like a personal affair, not a family project. 

“Did you hear me?” His mom pressed, picking up on his silence.

“Yeah, got it,” Ethan mumbled, trying to sound more enthusiastic than he felt. Inside, he was kind of relieved about Ivy not meeting his mom just yet. He knew his mother had a vision of the perfect daughter-in-law, and he feared Ivy would crumble under the pressure of his mom’s relentless questioning.

As he rode the elevator down, he couldn’t shake the thought. James Miller, his coworker, jabbed him in the shoulder, snapping him back to reality. 

“Never pegged you as a smoker, Clark. Since when do you carry a lighter?” James glanced at the small flame device in Ethan's hand, curiosity dancing in his eyes.

Ethan usually left work with just his phone and briefcase, so this was a head-scratcher. He once ribbed James about smoking, which had led James to quit. Now, here he was, holding a lighter like he was auditioning for a role in a detective movie.

“Just trying it out occasionally,” Ethan shrugged, trying to play it cool.

He used to despise the smell of cigarettes, but ever since Ivy came into his life, he found himself tolerating it—heck, even liking it a bit. Go figure. 

As he got home, he glanced up at Ivy’s second-floor apartment. The lights were on, and through the partially closed curtains, he saw her, a little shadow with a messy bun pacing back and forth. His heart warmed, and he felt oddly comforted.

He walked to her door just as it swung open. 

Ivy had just hopped out of the shower, her cheeks flushed with the steam. “What’s up?” she asked, looking adorably disheveled.

Ethan felt a little awkward as he stared at the giant crystal chandelier in her living room, trying to gather his thoughts. “Do you have any plans this weekend?”

“Work,” she replied, shaking her head. “Is there something you need?” She stood there in the doorway, half-hidden, with her damp hair framing her face, waiting for him to continue.

Ethan scratched the back of his head. “It’s my mom’s birthday. I thought maybe you’d come with me to meet her and grab some dinner.”

Seeing him so bashful was kind of amusing to Ivy. But then she paused, realizing she had never met Ethan’s parents. For her, the whole marriage thing felt more like a formality, just a piece of paper that turned their living situation into a legal affair. 

Meeting the parents? That felt way too serious. She wasn't even sure if they were really a couple in the traditional sense. Sure, they were legally married, but Ethan had never even declared his feelings to her. And on top of that, a gnawing insecurity told her they were from completely different worlds. The thought of meeting his parents felt like a daunting task.

“Do you want me to go?” Ivy asked, narrowing her eyes, trying to gauge his reaction.

Ethan’s gaze darted around before landing on the necklace around her neck. “If you want to, then sure,” he replied, his tone leaving much to be desired.

That response sucked the excitement right out of her. 

Ivy’s lips twitched into a forced smile. “Nah, I’m busy. Not going.”

She turned and tried to sneak away, but her footsteps felt louder than ever, like she was stomping through the entire building. What kind of answer was that? If she didn’t want to go, she could’ve just said so.

Ethan watched her retreating figure, feeling a mix of confusion and frustration.

A moment later, she came back holding a plate of sliced fruit, her chin up and not even glancing at him as she walked past. 

With a playful grin, Ethan stretched out his arm to block the door, refusing to let her slip inside. “You cut this fruit for me. Now you have to feed me one!”

“Here! Take the whole plate!” Ivy shoved it into his hands with exaggerated force.

Ethan barely caught it, his heart racing as he fumbled to stabilize the plate before it crashed to the ground. In the chaos, Ivy slipped past him into her room.

As she was about to shut the door, Ethan propped his elbow against it. “Please, just come with me?”

Ivy forced a smile. “I’ve got to work. But tell your mom happy birthday for me, okay?”

She closed the door on him, locking it with an audible click, her frustration spilling out as she let out a huff.

Leaning against the door, she listened intently for any sound from him. All she heard was a deep sigh followed by hasty footsteps heading down the stairs. 

What a mess this was turning out to be!
