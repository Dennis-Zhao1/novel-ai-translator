### She's a Married Woman

“Hey, you two! What’s taking so long with those boxes?” Ivy Gonzalez yelled from the doorway, gnawing on a kebab. “Hurry up, or the food's gonna get cold!”

She managed to wriggle her hand free from Ethan Clark’s grasp and darted inside. Once she was in, Dai Yinyin tilted her head to look behind Ivy. “Where's your husband? Still moving stuff?”

Ivy’s inner monologue screamed, *Please don’t keep calling him my husband!*

With a calm facade, she replied, “He probably had to run an errand.”

Growing up pampered, Ethan was not the kind of guy who could take a hit, so Ivy figured he might have just bailed. 

“I’m late!” Olivia Price suddenly appeared at the doorway. She glanced outside and added, “Buggy's been throwing a fit about getting candied fruit.”

Ivy leaned out, puzzled. “Where’s Buggy?”

The next moment, Ethan walked in, cradling a kid, his eyes landing squarely on Ivy. After setting the child down, he rushed off to grab stuff from the trunk.

Once inside, he wasted no time. He opened a box filled with barbecue ingredients and squatted down to quietly ask Buggy, “Can you eat this?”

Buggy looked up at Olivia for approval, and after getting the nod, exclaimed, “Yes! I love it!”

Ethan finally found a valid excuse to stick around and quipped, “Uncle will grill it just for you!”

With that, he expertly started oiling skewers on the grill. Ivy slumped into a rocking chair, munching on grilled oranges, trying to mask the taste of smoke and annoyance. She shot daggers at him with her eyes, thinking, *Who even cares?*

Since their arrival, Liam Harris had been switching his gaze between Ivy and Ethan, and his keen eyes caught the faint mark on Ethan's cheek. Raising an eyebrow, he smirked and sauntered over to Ivy, plopping down beside her.

“Here, I’ll grill some oranges for you,” Liam chimed in.

Before Ivy knew it, she turned to the grill and found a whole bunch of oranges were ready. “You like oranges? I thought you only liked meat.”

“Those are for you!” Liam raised his voice playfully, casting a glance at Ethan, who was still grilling.

“Oh please, she’s married! What do you need to help her for?” Dai Yinyin squeezed herself between them, giving Liam a disapproving look.

Typically, Liam had a harem of girlfriends, and Dai Yinyin didn’t care much. But Ivy was a married woman, and Ethan was definitely not some random dude; she genuinely worried for Liam’s obliviousness.

Liam raised an eyebrow, shoving an orange slice into Dai Yinyin's mouth. “Guess you can’t talk if you’re eating!”

Ethan kept his focus on the grill, clearly unfazed.

After grilling a whole batch, Ethan plated the skewers, most of which were Ivy’s favorites. He walked over, bending slightly. “Want some?”

Ivy pursed her lips, aware of everyone’s eyes on her. She didn’t want to embarrass him, so she reluctantly picked up a skewer of lamb.

Perfectly cooked, with the right spices, she devoured one skewer after another. Ethan, meanwhile, was playfully engaging with Buggy, stealing glances at Ivy as she snuck in more skewers. His mood lifted, he started goofing around with the kid.

“He seems to really like kids,” Olivia remarked, observing the playful scene.

Ivy was momentarily taken aback. Olivia nudged her, pressing, “Right?”

Ivy had no clue if Ethan liked kids. She didn’t know him well enough; he never let her in. She stared at her shoes, mumbling, “I guess?”

Just then, Buggy sprinted over and dove into Olivia’s arms, laughter ringing out.

Ethan followed, and Olivia teased, “You like kids so much, why don’t you and Ivy have one? Your kid would be a total cutie!”

A fit of coughs erupted from Ivy, nearly choking on some chili flakes, her face turning beet red. She didn’t know how to respond—utterly mortifying.

“Looks like Ivy’s on board,” Ethan said coolly, pulling a chair to sit across from her, his eyes sparkling with an amused grin.

Ivy thought, *Seriously?!*

She felt exasperated. How long were they going to keep up this charade of being a happy couple? She was fed up with him looking at her like that. She couldn’t decipher that smile—was it for her or someone else?

With a surge of determination, Ivy decided to lay it all out there while they were surrounded by friends. She cleared her throat, gearing up to spill the truth about their crumbling relationship. “Actually, we’ve been planning to—”

Ethan immediately clasped Ivy’s hand, cutting her off. He knew exactly what she was about to say and wasn’t about to let it fly.

Ivy gaped at him, frozen in place.

Liam, always the troublemaker, chimed in with curiosity, “Planning what?”

Ethan tightened his grip on Ivy’s hand. “We’re thinking of going on a honeymoon trip after spring.”

Ivy’s heart raced, her back prickling. She flipped her hand to pinch his fingers, squeezing hard enough to make them turn red.

He gritted his teeth, holding back his pain. But when Ivy’s icy fingers crept up his sleeve, preparing to pinch his wrist, he finally snapped.

The next thing Ivy knew, Ethan yanked her into his lap, causing her to squeal in surprise.

Dai Yinyin, munching on an orange, stared wide-eyed. “You two really are the picture of newlyweds!”

With that, both Dai Yinyin and Olivia burst into laughter, while Liam continued to munch on his own oranges, looking like a grumpy cat.

As the group dispersed, Ivy curled up on the couch to watch the Spring Festival Gala replay. Suddenly, her phone buzzed with an alert.

A snowstorm had hit, cautioning everyone to stay indoors for safety.

Panic surged through Ivy as she dialed Ethan’s number, but after several rings and no answer, she called Dai Yinyin instead. It rang three times before connecting.

“Where are you guys?” Ivy asked, her voice laced with worry.

Dai Yinyin glanced out the window. “We’ll be home in about an hour!”

Ivy felt a wave of relief wash over her. “Ethan should be close, too.”

Dai Yinyin replied, “He didn’t leave with us; he might be a bit late.”

That sent Ivy into a frenzy. She jumped up from the couch, urgency spilling from her words. “What’s he doing?! Why isn’t he answering his phone?”

Dai Yinyin asked if something was wrong, but Ivy didn’t want to alarm them. “No, just focus on driving!”

After hanging up, Ivy paced the living room, repeatedly calling Ethan’s number, but still no answer.

She bolted upstairs, grabbed her coat, and snatched the car keys before heading out.

Driving through the storm, she peeked around, but her heart sank as she didn’t spot Ethan’s familiar car. A kind stranger warned her the road ahead was closed and advised her to turn back.

But Ivy was determined; she pressed on, the roads becoming emptier as most drivers retreated.

Suddenly, she spotted a figure by the roadside. It was Ethan, his face buried in a black turtleneck, shivering with hands jammed in his pockets.

Ivy flung open the car door and stormed over. “Is your phone just a decoration?!”
