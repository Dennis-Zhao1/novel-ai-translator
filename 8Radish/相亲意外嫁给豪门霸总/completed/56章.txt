**Why Did He Marry You?**

It was 1:30 AM when Ivy Gonzalez finally dragged herself home. The place was as dark as a cave, not a single sound to be heard. She quietly slipped off her shoes and tiptoed past Ethan Clark's closed bedroom door, glancing at it with a smirk. "Looks like someone had a wild night," she thought, shaking her head at his absence.

Just as she was about to head upstairs, the door swung open, revealing a scowling Ethan. 

“I called you! Texted you! And you ignored me!” he huffed, arms crossed like a kid denied dessert.

Ivy couldn’t help but chuckle. “What’s the drama? Did you want me to play the dutiful wife waiting for you to come home?”

Tightening her grip around her purse, she felt her phone weighing it down—unused all night, just like her patience for this nonsense. 

Ethan’s frustration was palpable. “It’s New Year’s Eve! We were supposed to celebrate together!”

Ivy raised an eyebrow. “And? It’s late, and I’m not really into holidays.” She felt a pang of disappointment she couldn’t shake off but was too tired to argue.

“Let’s go!” he insisted, grabbing her wrist and pulling her toward the door. “If I didn’t celebrate, it doesn’t count!”

Seriously? Ivy was half-tempted to shake him off, but the cold night air hit her like a slap as he led her to an open space. From afar, she could hear the faint pops of fireworks, and her annoyance flared. “What do you want from me?” she snapped, yanking her arm free.

Ignoring her, Ethan bent down behind a rock and pulled out a box of fireworks, lighting one with a flick of his lighter. Ivy watched as he stumbled back, a wild grin on his face, and she couldn’t help but laugh at how goofy he looked.

In an instant, dozens of sparkling golden lights shot up into the sky, blooming into massive heart shapes. For a moment, all her irritation faded away, replaced by the wonder of the fireworks. Was she really this easy to please?

When Ethan took her hand, she didn’t pull away. His gaze was intense, like he was trying to set her on fire with just a look. 

“Ivy Gonzalez,” he said, softly, “Happy New Year.”

She squeezed his hand back, and just like that, it felt like all was forgiven.

The next morning, sunlight streamed through the curtains, waking Ivy from her dreams. Still half-asleep, she reached out, finding Ethan’s waist and snuggling closer.

“Up and at ‘em?” he murmured, his fingers tracing her arm. But then his tone shifted. “We need to talk about this video.”

Ivy blinked awake, confused. “What video?”

Ethan shoved his phone in her face, smirking. “The one where you’re on stage with Sophia Bennett. Care to explain why you ignored my texts all night?”

Ivy watched the video, her heart racing. They were radiant, laughing and dancing under the lights. For a moment, she admired how great she looked on camera—her skin glowing, hair shining. Who knew the performance would go viral?

“Seriously? You’re mad at me? You were all over some random girl last night!” she shot back, jumping out of bed to get dressed.

Ethan’s face reddened, and he stepped closer, grabbing her arms. “Do you even know who he is? You were flirting with him!”

“Who are you to judge?” Ivy shot back, her anger flaring. “I was just performing! Unlike you, I wasn't all over someone.”

Ethan’s eyes widened. “It was him who leaked your marriage news! If it weren’t for him, you wouldn’t be getting all this hate!”

“Is that right?” Ivy laughed bitterly. “Well, at least he made it known. Unlike you, who’s ashamed to admit we’re married.”

“Next time, tell him to include your name and picture!” she yelled, feeling her anger boiling over.

Ethan clenched his jaw, frustration written all over his face. He stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

Ivy stood there, her heart sinking. If he cared, he’d proudly announce their marriage instead of pretending it didn’t exist.

Just then, her phone buzzed, jolting her back to reality. 

“Miss Lin, this is Lawyer Lee. Your case goes to court tomorrow. Are you coming?” 

Ivy sighed, her voice softening. “No, I’ll let you handle it.”

After hanging up, another unknown number flashed on her screen. Curiosity piqued, she slipped on some sandals and headed to the front of her apartment complex just as a black car pulled up. 

Before she could react, the door swung open, and two guys dragged her inside. 

“Hey, what’s going on?” Ivy shouted, panic rising. The security guard stood frozen, unsure of what to do.

Inside the car, she spotted Lucas Smith, a so-called fan of hers. 

“Chill out,” he said, fiddling with his keys. “We’re not going to hurt you. Just taking you to see something interesting.”

Ivy struggled against the grip of the guys holding her. “This is your idea of fun?” 

Lucas smirked. “You should be thanking me, not panicking.”

She rolled her eyes. “You’re a nutcase. Just let me go!”

As they drove into an underground parking lot, Ivy’s mind raced. This was a mall she’d visited with Ethan before. What was going on?

“Let’s go to the ninth floor,” Lucas instructed.

“Ninth floor? You planning to toss me off?” Ivy’s heart raced.

Desperately, she clung to the door. “Look, buddy, it’s just a man! You’re making a big deal out of nothing!”

Lucas paused, turning to her with a sly grin. “You know why he married you, right?” 

And with that, Ivy’s heart skipped a beat. What did he mean by that?
