**A Family Affair**

The winter chill in the southern part of the country was bone-deep, no matter how many layers you wore, it just cut through you like a knife. Ivy Gonzalez was curled up in her bed, initially planning to head back today, but the cold had her reconsidering. "What’s one more day? I’m just wasting time anyway!" With that decision made, she rolled over and snuggled deeper under her blankets, ready for some more sleep.

Half-asleep, she heard Grace Peterson, her mom, chatting loudly with someone downstairs. Grace was always a bundle of energy, but today she seemed to be on overdrive. After a few minutes of excited chatter, she hurried upstairs and knocked on Ivy’s door. Ivy was too cold to even think about getting out of bed to open the door and was about to ask what was up when Grace burst in and whipped the curtains open.

“Hey! Ethan’s here! Are you still sleeping?” Grace exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

Ivy blinked, confused. She thought she must have misheard. She poked her head out from under the covers, completely bewildered. Grace gave her a gentle nudge, urging her to wash up, reminding her her hair looked like a bird's nest and would surely be a laughing stock if anyone saw.

Ivy chuckled to herself. They lived together; he’d seen her in worse states. Reluctantly, she crawled out of her warm cocoon, brushing her teeth while wondering why Ethan was visiting. Thoughts raced through her mind, but nothing made sense. After taming her hair with a quick brush and throwing on a coat, she dashed downstairs.

Ethan Clark was standing by the coffee table, a gift box sitting atop it, looking as thoughtful as ever. 

“Oh, it’s family! You didn’t need to bring a gift!” Grace laughed, waving her hand dismissively.

“Just doing what’s right,” Ethan replied with a polite smile before checking in on Grace, reminding her to rest and go to the hospital if things got rough.

Grace beamed at him, clearly charmed. When she heard Ivy coming down the stairs, she looked at her daughter and thought, “Why on earth doesn’t she dress like a girl?” Ivy was bundled up in a bright red puffer jacket, and her hair was still a chaotic mess.

Ethan’s gaze followed Ivy as she descended, looking relaxed and cheerful. Ivy, however, was feeling the opposite—awkward. It felt strange having her boyfriend over at her place, but they’d lived together long enough for it to feel normal yet odd at the same time.

Grace glanced between Ethan and Ivy, then said with a wink, “I just spoke with our neighbor, so you two chat for a bit!” With that, she skipped out the door to visit next door.

Suddenly, the living room felt vast and empty, filled only with the sound of their breathing. Ignoring Ethan, Ivy plopped down on the couch and turned on the TV, a random reality show blaring in the background, filling the silence with laughter and chaos.

Finally, Ivy broke the ice. “What’s with the surprise visit?” She felt like he was intruding on her space. She liked him, but she also wanted to keep some distance—a little private space of her own.

“Not welcome?” Ethan shot back, standing beside her and leaning in, pinching her cheek lightly in mock anger. “You could’ve told me you were coming back. I had to drive for hours to get you!”

Ivy had turned off her phone, not wanting to see any gossip or comments about her online. It had been silent for days, and Ethan's messages went unseen.

“Ow! I wouldn’t dare! My mom would love it if you lived here every day!” Ivy protested, swatting his hand away.

Ethan didn’t reply, understanding what she meant. He had developed a thick skin around her, squeezing onto the couch beside her, their arms brushing against each other. She could smell that familiar woodsy scent he always had. 

Ivy felt a little like a puppy—why was she so drawn to him? She leaned in closer, feeling safe and warm. Ethan, noticing the coldness of her surroundings, had only worn a thin black sweater, and his nose was starting to turn red.

Quickly, she grabbed a blanket from the corner of the couch and wrapped it around him snugly, then got up to pour him a cup of hot water.

Ethan took a sip, his mind still elsewhere. “So, when are you heading back?”

Ivy stood before him, adjusting the blanket. “Tomorrow,” she replied.

At that, Ethan smiled, holding her hand and gently squeezing it, feeling lighter than when he arrived.

Ivy didn’t understand his concerns, but seeing him smile made her forget her questions. She loved his smile; his teeth were white, his eyes sparkled, and that little mole under his left eye had a strange magnetic pull on her.

In a moment of vulnerability, she suddenly threw her arms around him, collapsing into his embrace. Ethan caught her, surprised.

“What's wrong?” he asked softly, realizing something was off.

“I’m just tired,” Ivy murmured, burying her face in his neck and inhaling his comforting scent, feeling safe without saying a word.

Later that evening, they were enjoying a hot pot dinner. Grace was busily piling meat onto Ethan's plate, filling it up as if it were a bottomless pit.

Ethan shot Ivy a look for help, but she just smirked and continued eating, ignoring his plight.

Grace dropped a piece of lamb onto his plate, then muttered, “I’ll grab you both an extra thick blanket later; it’s freezing!”

Ivy raised an eyebrow. “We?” She glanced at Ethan, but he was intentionally avoiding her gaze, too busy shoveling food into his mouth.

Grace looked puzzled. “Of course! Aren’t you two staying together tonight?” She turned to Ethan, “Wait, you two aren’t sleeping in separate rooms, right?”

Ethan nearly choked on his food, the lamb almost stuck in his throat. He hadn’t expected Ivy’s mom to be so straightforward, and he was at a loss for words.

Ivy didn’t want to explain their relationship to Grace. Knowing her mom, she'd dig until she hit the bottom of it all, and their arrangement was merely a piece of paper compared to what real couples had. 

So, she quickly interjected, “I’ll go grab the blanket. You should rest early, Mom.”
