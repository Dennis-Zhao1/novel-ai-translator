**Forced Marriage Blues**

Ivy Gonzalez just graduated from college, and it feels like her mother, Grace Peterson, is on a personal mission to get her married. "Ivy, you're at that age where people start to talk if you aren't married!" Grace loves to remind her. And while Ivy’s never really cared about gossip, she can’t escape her mom’s relentless nagging that seems to intensify every couple of days.

Ivy barely sits down to eat after a long day of work when Grace sighs dramatically, “You know, Mrs. Wang next door has a three-year-old grandson! I saw her taking him for a walk today and I just couldn’t help but feel envious. Look at you!” 

By now, Ivy has heard this speech at least a hundred times. She knows her mom’s worries—she's scared that Ivy will get older and find it harder to snag a good partner. Ivy usually just shrugs it off with a “Yeah, I know” or “I get it, Mom.”

Finally, after a long day, she’s ready to dig into her dinner, but Grace seems determined to ruin that moment. “You need to go on a date this holiday!” she says, her tone brooking no argument.

The mere thought of a blind date makes Ivy’s head hurt. She tightens her lips and finally manages to say, “Can we just eat first? I’m starving and really tired.” She picks up some meat and chews slowly, adding, “Besides, I’m not against marriage, but come on, it’s all about fate!”

Grace’s face morphs into a wounded puppy look, “I can’t even show my face outside thinking about how you’re not married. I can’t sleep at night! I’m restless until you find someone!” 

Here we go again! Ivy rolls her eyes internally, feeling the familiar frustration wash over her. 

Ivy’s father passed away when she was little, and while her parents had made some decent money running a small business, her mom’s gambling habit drained most of it. Now, they were barely scraping by.

With a smirk, Ivy quips, “What unlucky guy did you set your sights on this time?” 

Grace stands to serve Ivy some soup, and suddenly, her expression brightens. “I posted your photos online for matchmaking, and believe it or not, it actually worked!”

Ivy feels a wave of dread crash over her. “Seriously? You posted my photos online? You think that’s a good idea?” 

But under her mom’s relentless insistence, Ivy begrudgingly agrees to go on the date.

The next day, Ivy heads out at the agreed time, but she ends up waiting forever for her ride. Traffic is a nightmare, and the streets are packed with holiday-goers. But Ivy is surprisingly calm, just lounging on a bench, sipping her iced coffee while everyone else frets.

After what feels like an eternity, she finally hops into a car. She arrives at the restaurant half an hour late, and honestly, she hopes her date has lost patience and left.

Upon entering, Ivy’s heart sinks. This place is way out of her budget—she usually wouldn’t even dream of eating here. The waiter leads her to a reserved table where a guy is already sitting. He’s got a sharp haircut, a well-fitted suit, and a posture that screams confidence.

Ivy sizes him up as she approaches, and with a bright smile, she says, “Sorry I’m late! Traffic is terrible this time of year!” 

Ethan Clark is busy scrolling through his phone, checking out Ivy’s profile and picture. When he looks up and sees her smiling face, he’s momentarily stunned. She looks even better in person than in her photo.

After a moment, he stands up and introduces himself, “Hi, I’m Ethan Clark.”

Ivy settles into her seat, trying not to feel underdressed in her casual outfit of a t-shirt and sweatpants, while Ethan looks like he stepped out of a GQ magazine. 

As they chat, Ivy notices Ethan has a dish of appetizers in front of her. “This is our starter. You should try some,” he encourages.

Ivy takes a couple of bites, but then sets her chopsticks down. “The food looks great, but I’m allergic to seafood.” She glances at the table filled with shrimp and fish. 

Ethan looks a bit embarrassed. “I’m so sorry! I didn’t think about that.” 

“No big deal,” Ivy smiles, trying to keep the atmosphere light. She’s determined to get through this awkward date without too much discomfort. 

As they talk, Ivy can’t shake the feeling that Ethan’s name sounds familiar. A quick Google search in her head confirms it—Ethan Clark is the heir to a massive fortune, the face of the affluent Clark family known for their conglomerate, the Clark Group! 

She can’t help but feel out of her league. “Why would someone like you even need to go on a blind date?” she asks, half-joking.

Ethan chuckles, “Because dating takes time, and time is very precious for us.” 

Ivy rolls her eyes internally—who isn’t busy? She had to ditch her binge-watching to be here! 

As the meal winds down, Ivy is already plotting her escape strategy, ready to politely decline any further connection. But Ethan surprises her by asking, “Is the food not to your taste? You barely touched it.”

Ivy shrugs. “I’m really not hungry. I’m more of a burger-and-fries kind of girl.”

Ethan stands up suddenly, blocking the light. “Let’s go grab a burger instead!”

Ivy stares at him in disbelief. “Wait, what? We’re leaving?” 

But Ethan is already striding out the door, turning back to wait for her. With a defeated sigh, Ivy follows him. What’s next? A spontaneous burger date with a millionaire? She can’t help but wonder how this will turn out...
