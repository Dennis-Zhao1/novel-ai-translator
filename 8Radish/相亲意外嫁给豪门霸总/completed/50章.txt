### Awkward Connections

“Dinner is served!”

Ethan Clark proudly carried out the last plate of his freshly cooked dish, the tantalizing aroma wafting through the air and making their stomachs grumble. Ivy Gonzalez stepped closer, and to her surprise, recognized the dishes from their blind date at that fancy private restaurant. Who knew he’d actually take the time to learn how to cook? Sometimes, she admired his energy. He was always busy with work and still managed to whip up a meal.

It was the same time Ivy had indulged just a bit too much.

Thinking back, it had been ages since they dined out. Ever since the news broke online about Ivy’s marriage, she rarely ventured outside. She’d claim she wasn’t bothered by the gossip, but deep down, she dreaded running into strangers. Just the other day, someone recognized her, and thankfully it was just a fan, or she would have had no idea how to handle it.

Ivy made a point to eat heartily, worried Ethan might notice her flagging appetite.

“I think you should open a restaurant,” she said with a grin, shoveling a piece of fish onto his plate. “Your cooking has really improved!”

Ethan glanced at her, piling more food onto her plate, but his mind was clearly elsewhere. He absentmindedly stirred his rice with chopsticks, even as the meal was winding down, he still hadn’t brought up the subject of her job contract getting cut.

Their relationship sometimes felt incredibly awkward, like they were both afraid to let the other in on their struggles. Ivy was terrified of Ethan discovering her financial woes, while Ethan dreaded Ivy learning about his not-so-glamorous side.

They were both masters of keeping secrets.

After dinner, Ethan stood up to clear the dishes. As he turned towards the kitchen, he couldn’t help but ask, his voice low and serious, “What are you planning to do about work?”

Ivy froze, unsure of how to respond. 

After all, most of life’s issues can be traced back to money. Should she really confess, “Hey, can I borrow a million bucks?”

Not a chance. Instead, she forced a smile. “I’m handling it. Nothing to worry about.”

Ivy watched Ethan’s straight back as he faced away from her, his posture rigid and his gaze focused ahead, lost in thought.

Time dragged on—was it minutes or seconds?—but it felt like an eternity. Ethan remained silent, completely still, and the atmosphere was suffocating.

Ivy’s skills in reading the room had sharpened over time. Tossing aside her napkin, she quickly walked up to him, unsure of what was bothering him but knowing that initiating conversation was her survival tactic.

“What’s up?” she asked, blinking innocently. “Are you tired? I can wash the dishes.”

“Wash them?” Ethan scoffed, holding up the greasy plates. “You didn’t even know we had a dishwasher!”

Ivy felt her cheeks flush with embarrassment. She didn’t know; she rarely stepped into the kitchen. The only time she had was to raid the fridge, and everything in there was stocked by Ethan.

When they first went shopping for kitchen supplies, Ivy had been floored to discover that a decent fish knife could cost upwards of $500! Ethan insisted that quality tools were essential for good cooking, so they splurged.

Thinking back on their lifestyle habits, Ivy realized they had nothing in common—like they were living on different planets.

“Do you think I make a good match with him?” Ivy asked suddenly, her voice breaking through the silence.

Later that night, Ivy found herself in a cozy pub, wearing a mask of confidence as she chatted with her friend Emma Ward. Emma looked even better than before, positively glowing. When Ivy had received Emma's call, she was still in bed, torn over which lawyer to choose for her impending legal battles—none of them came cheap.

Emma had invited her out for drinks, and while Ivy had initially hesitated, Emma dropped a bombshell: “Xiaoyue and Michael Wood are together now.”

Ivy was taken aback yet somehow not surprised. Curiosity got the better of her, and she knew she had to hear the full scoop in person.

As they waited at the bar for Xiaoyue and Michael to arrive, Ivy turned to Emma with an obvious question. “Do you think they’re a good match?”

“Absolutely!” Emma replied, looking Ivy over with admiration. “They’re a stunning couple!”

“True enough,” Ivy said, lifting her glass in a toast before downing it, laughing at herself. “At least they’ve got that going for them.”

Emma wrapped an arm around Ivy’s shoulder, offering comfort. “Hey, at least it’s a beautiful person with a beautiful person! You should be grateful—it could be worse!”

They both shared a laugh, glancing around the pub at other couples, and it was hard not to snicker a little.

“Speaking of good news,” Emma said, her smile practically beaming, “I got custody of my kid back! I’m finally free from that loser’s grip…” Her voice trailed off, but the tears streaming down her cheeks told Ivy everything she needed to know. 

She wrapped her arms around Emma, patting her back. “It’s all behind you now.”

Emma smiled through her tears. “Can I borrow your mirror? My makeup’s a mess, and I look ridiculous!”

Ivy teased her, “You care so much about how you look. I swear you’re like a kid.” 

As Emma corrected her makeup, she leaned out to recommend her lawyer. “She’s really great and not too pricey either,” she said, handing Ivy a business card.

“Let me take a look at that later.”

“Here they come!” Emma exclaimed, spotting Xiaoyue and Michael walking in, both a tad late but looking as if they were on cloud nine.

Today, Emma was in such a good mood that she didn’t even comment on their tardiness. 

“You two sure know how to keep things hush-hush!” Ivy called out as they approached the bar, her eyes dancing with mischief. Xiaoyue’s cheeks flushed as she replied, “Ivy, you always know everything!”

Michael seemed unfazed, casually greeting them and heading off to the lounge as if Xiaoyue weren’t even his girlfriend.

Xiaoyue glanced at him, eyes sparkling. “I’m buying drinks tonight!” 

Emma chimed in, “Well, then we won’t hold back!”

The three of them burst into laughter.

Ivy had never drunk this much in one sitting before, and as they stumbled out of the pub, the brisk night air hit her like a splash of cold water, making her shiver.

Emma, taking off her scarf, wrapped it around Ivy’s neck. “Seriously, you’re dressed like a kid! It’s winter—wear something warmer!”

Ivy snuggled into the scarf, chuckling to herself, thinking how nice it would be to have an older sister like Emma.

“I noticed Michael’s been pretty cold to Xiaoyue,” Ivy said, casually as they walked.

Emma sighed, a smile playing on her lips. “Xiaoyue is a great girl, and after loving him for so long, I guess she’s finally got her wish.”

Everyone could see Xiaoyue’s feelings for Michael, and he was definitely aware of them too.

But can someone really fall in love just because of a sudden moment of emotion?
