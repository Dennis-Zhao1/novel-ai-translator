**Getting Ready for the Interview**

Ivy Gonzalez was lost in thought, mentally preparing for her big interview, when Ethan Clark suddenly called out to Jason Brooks, his tone as cold as a winter's day. “Take Miss Lin back to the hospital.”

Ivy rolled her eyes. What kind of mood swing is this? One minute Ethan is warm and friendly, and the next, he’s a total ice cube! Wasn’t he supposed to take her home?

Jason, ever the polite assistant, gestured for her to follow him. “Miss Lin, this way, please.”

Ivy was utterly baffled. She didn’t want to stick around and find out what Ethan's deal was, so she strode out with purpose. “Is your boss always like this?” she asked, trying to make conversation.

Jason’s focus remained glued to the road as he replied, “We never pry into the boss’s personal affairs.”

Ugh, Ivy thought. He's definitely been sneaking glances at me, but now he’s playing the mysterious stranger card. Whatever!

After they arrived, Ivy realized she was still wearing her veil from the previous event. She yanked it off and stuffed it into her bag before heading to Grace Peterson's hospital room. Seeing her sleeping mother eased Ivy’s worries. Grace had lost so much weight during her illness, and as Ivy tucked her mother’s blanket in, she felt a pang of concern.

With a laptop in hand, Ivy made her way to the garden downstairs. Setting it on a bench, she squatted on the grass, ready to submit her application to Ethan’s company. But the job requirements were intense—this gaming company was booming, and Ethan was touted as the industry's youngest elite entrepreneur.

Ivy was just a game artist right now, mostly handling the indoor scene details. She sighed, realizing there was still a mountain of skills to learn.

Suddenly, a tall figure blocked her view. Ivy looked up to see Sophia Bennett peering at her screen. “You could make some noise; you’re creeping me out over here,” she teased.

Sophia glanced down at her, his brows furrowing in concern. “It’s pretty dark; that’s not good for your eyes.”

Ivy shoved him playfully. “If you didn’t lurk around like a shadow, I wouldn’t be bothered.”

He obediently sat on a nearby bench, secretly thrilled to have spotted Ivy. He had been pacing the garden all day, afraid he might miss her, and now that she was here, he couldn’t help but feel giddy. 

As Ivy focused on her laptop, Sophia couldn’t help but admire her concentration. “Didn’t you smoke today?” Ivy asked casually.

“Being sick means no smoking,” Sophia replied with a hint of a smile.

Ivy didn’t really care about his smoking habits; she just wanted to fill the silence. She stood up, looking somewhat weighed down with thoughts. “I’m heading out. You should get some rest too!”

Sophia stood up as well, towering over her. “Good luck with your interview.”

“Thanks!” Ivy said, stepping past him quickly. 

Once she was gone, Sophia fished out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, chuckling to himself in the quiet night. “What a confusing girl,” he mused.

The next day, Ivy woke up early, putting on just enough makeup to look presentable. The dark circles under her eyes were worse than ever, so she added some concealer, hoping no one would notice. She picked a sharp-looking blazer and swapped her usual shoes for some snazzy heels. After a quick mirror check, she felt ready to conquer the world.

But as soon as she stepped outside, the sky opened up, and a light drizzle turned into a downpour. Determined not to let it ruin her mood, Ivy hopped into her car, relieved she had left early. 

Traffic was a nightmare, and she silently thanked her lucky stars for her early start. But soon, the rain intensified, turning the roads into rivers. 

Once she hit the overpass, a fellow driver shouted, “Don’t go forward! There’s flooding up ahead!”

Doubtful, Ivy rolled down her window and looked outside, only to see cars submerged, with just their roofs peeking out above the rising water level. Panic set in—she couldn’t just sit there, but if she detoured now, she’d definitely miss her interview.

After a moment of hesitation, she decided to take a longer route. Her heart raced as she sped through the rain-soaked streets. But when she finally reached Ethan’s office, her heart sank—she was late.

Ivy took a breath, fixed her frizzy hair, and approached the front desk. “Hi, I’m Ivy Gonzalez. I have an interview scheduled.”

The receptionist looked her over, noting her disheveled appearance. “Just a moment,” she said, her tone icy.

After a few moments, she added, “You’ve missed your interview time.”

Ivy’s stomach twisted. “Could you please let the interviewer know? It’s pouring out there, and I’m really sorry about the delay.”

With a reluctant nod, the receptionist agreed. Ivy sank into a chair in the waiting area, her nerves spiking. Around her, other candidates looked equally tense, and she couldn’t help but feel the pressure building.

“Ivy Gonzalez?” a voice called out.

“That’s me!” she replied, forcing a smile.

The interviewer glanced over her resume, pausing at the marital status section. “You’re married? At such a young age?”

Caught off guard, Ivy remembered she had just gotten her marriage certificate. “Uh, yeah, I just got married!”

The interviewer raised an eyebrow, clearly surprised. “Okay, we’ll be in touch,” he said, dismissing her.

As Ivy exited, her heart sank. The chances didn’t look good. She leaned against the wall, waiting for the elevator, her spirits low.

When the doors opened, she stepped inside without looking up, only to be startled by Ethan, who had been watching her with amusement.

He stood there, smirking, clearly enjoying her downcast expression. 

Ivy shot him a glare, still annoyed from the previous night. Meanwhile, his secretary, James, looked puzzled, thinking he had offended Ivy somehow. 

Crossing her arms, Ivy shot daggers at Ethan, who was enjoying the moment far too much.

When the elevator reached the ground floor, Ivy turned on her heel and headed for the exit, Ethan watching her until she disappeared around a corner.
