**Followed Home**

Ivy Gonzalez had definitely improved since her first night at the bar. Even Michael Wood, the guy who had been a bit of a jerk to her at first, had to admit she was getting better. 

After finishing her set, she wrapped herself in a cream-colored shawl and plopped down at the bar, aimlessly watching the crowd. It was just past three in the morning, and the place was still buzzing with people. A table of young guys in hoodies was so far gone they were sprawled out, completely passed out, while their friends had long since abandoned ship.

As she sipped her drink, Ivy noticed one of the bartenders trying to wake up one of those guys, who just wouldn’t budge. 

Sophia Bennett, who was sitting across from her, slid over to join her. “Hey, have you seen Ethan Clark lately?” she asked, pouring Ivy another drink.

Ivy glanced over at Ethan's usual spot and felt an unexpected pang of emptiness. “He’s on a work trip in Germany,” she replied, taking a small sip.

Sophia leaned back against the bar, her gaze drifting over the crowd, a smile playing on her lips as if she had a secret thought. Ivy couldn’t help but notice how different Sophia looked tonight. Normally, she was the calm and collected type, but now, there was a spark in her words. “You know, Ethan seems really into you,” she said casually.

Ivy knew exactly what Sophia was hinting at. She was aware of Ethan’s feelings and the efforts he’d made for her—too aware, in fact. She just smiled at Sophia and changed the subject. “You guys have known each other for a long time, right? But you never really talk about how you met.”

Sophia took a deep breath and downed her drink, then said, “Isn’t it weird though? He’s young, successful, drives a luxury car, and lives in a mansion. What does he see in you?”

Ivy shrugged, trying to keep it light. “You’d have to ask him about that. You know him better than I do.”

Sophia gave her a half-hearted smile, clearly not satisfied with the answer.

Just then, Michael Wood walked by, and Ivy seized the opportunity to escape the awkward conversation. “Hey, Michael! Let’s go!” she called out, making a beeline for the door, eager to avoid any more of Sophia's probing questions.

As they stepped outside, they spotted Xiaoyue waiting by the curb. Xiaoyue was not thrilled to see Ivy tagging along since she and Michael lived in the same apartment complex and usually commuted home together.

Xiaoyue shot Ivy a glare. “You aren’t seriously planning to walk with us, are you?”

Ivy raised an eyebrow, feigning nonchalance. “Who wants to be a third wheel?”

Xiaoyue stifled a laugh, while Michael jumped in to defend Ivy. “What third wheel? Don’t say things like that!”

Ivy watched Michael fluster and couldn’t help but chuckle. He was usually so composed, but here he was, blushing like a schoolboy. She waved goodbye and headed in the opposite direction.

The streets were eerily quiet, the bare trees casting long shadows in the dim light. Just ahead, a couple of tipsy guys stumbled out of a nearby bar, their eyes landing on Ivy. “Hey there, gorgeous! Where are you off to? Want to join us for some fun?” one slurred, reaching out to touch her face.

Ivy felt a chill run down her spine. She quickly dodged their drunken advances, her heart racing. She picked up her pace, wishing she could just fly away and stay out of reach. She clutched a small bottle of pepper spray from her bag, her fingers wrapped tightly around it.

After what felt like an eternity of walking, she spotted a 24-hour convenience store up ahead—her beacon of hope. She dashed inside, feigning calm as she browsed the shelves, keeping a close eye on the entrance.

Just as she suspected, the two men followed her, their silhouettes lingering outside the glass doors. One peered in, his gaze cold and calculating. Ivy’s stomach churned at the sight of them, the smell of alcohol and sweat wafting in her direction.

She hesitated, unsure if it was safe to leave, so she decided to buy some instant noodles and snacks. “I’ll just wait this out,” she thought. After all, it was better to stay here until morning.

As the steam from the noodles warmed her face, she felt a bit of tension ease. Suddenly, a shadow loomed over the window, and she nearly dropped her food in shock.

It was Ethan Clark, looking rugged in a black jacket and jeans, hands shoved in his pockets. His tired eyes showed a hint of concern as he leaned against the glass with a slight smile.

Ivy’s heart leaped. She had never wanted to see someone so much. She wiped her eyes quickly, trying to compose herself.

Ethan stepped inside, taking a seat across from her. “I just checked the bar, and they said you left. I didn’t think you’d be here sneaking snacks,” he teased, tilting his head to get a better look at her.

Ivy focused on her noodles, avoiding eye contact. “I’m fine,” she muttered, not wanting to talk about what had just happened.

Ethan noticed something was off. He gently turned her face to meet his gaze. “What’s wrong?” he asked, worry lacing his voice as he brushed away a stray tear.

Ivy took a shaky breath, “Nothing, really.”

She didn’t want to worry him about the guys outside; she knew he'd go looking for trouble. Ethan placed her hand on his knee, gently squeezing it as if hoping to coax the truth out of her.

Ivy, feeling the warmth of his hand, finally cracked a smile. “I was just thinking about when I’ll get to a point in my life where I don’t have to live off instant noodles. It’s tough out here!” she joked, and even she couldn’t help but laugh.

Ethan let out a relieved chuckle. “You’re just making life harder for yourself!” He grinned back, and for a moment, everything felt right again.
