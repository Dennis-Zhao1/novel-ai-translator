**Title: The Price of Beauty**

Ivy Gonzalez had learned the hard way how to hold onto her money. Growing up with a tight budget will do that to you. Even though she was offered a hefty sum for a marriage of convenience, the idea of accepting it made her feel like she was swallowing a thorn. It was a constant reminder that the relationship wasn’t exactly equal.

“Seriously, it’s thirty grand!” she muttered to herself, recalling how her friend, Daisy, had casually brushed off her concerns. Daisy, who had grown up with a silver spoon in her mouth, couldn’t grasp Ivy’s struggle. “Thirty grand is nothing! I spend that much on my monthly shopping!” Ivy rolled her eyes at the thought—like, really? 

But tonight, she needed to let loose a little. After all, she had a dinner with the TE executives to attend. She quickly texted Daisy, “You coming to the dinner tonight?”

Daisy’s response was instantaneous. “What dinner? I’m off to shoot a scene!” 

Ivy sighed and was about to toss her phone into her purse when a headline caught her eye: “Supermoon Tonight!” But honestly, who cared about celestial events when she was stuck in traffic, racing toward an obligatory dinner?

“Come on, driver! We can’t keep those big shots waiting!” Emily Jones, her friend and fellow entertainer, was practically bouncing in her seat. The driver sighed, “Traffic’s thick. Can’t go any faster!”

They finally arrived at the restaurant, a fancy place where Ivy had first met Ethan Clark, the TE CEO. Back then, they had sat outside; tonight, they were in a private room. The room was soundproof, so when they entered, the chatter stopped, and everyone turned to stare at Ivy. 

She felt like a deer caught in headlights, her heart racing. The room was filled with sharply dressed men, and their hungry eyes made her feel like a piece of meat. Just great. If she turned around now, she’d probably ruin her chances of landing future gigs. 

“Hey, Ivy! Come sit with us!” called Mr. Wu, the boss, with an overly friendly grin. Emily, ever the instigator, nudged Ivy toward the seat next to Ethan, who was already smirking like he owned the place. 

Ivy clenched her jaw, trying to contain her frustration. This dinner was supposed to be a networking opportunity, not a bait-and-switch where she was the main course. 

“Wow, Ivy, you look even better in person!” a guy across the table slurred after too many drinks. “You’re way hotter than those stars on TV!” 

“Of course! Not just a pretty face, but a killer body too!” Mr. Wu chimed in, and the others laughed, their eyes practically undressing her. 

Ethan, the CEO, was snapping photos of her like she was some sort of trophy. He didn’t even ask, just pointed his phone at her as if they were best buds. “Hey, Ethan, you should check this out! Look at the stunning lady sitting next to me!” he typed and sent it off.

Meanwhile, Ethan was stuck in a meeting with his business partner, James. His phone buzzed with the message, and he almost ignored it—until he saw the thumbnail of Ivy. His stomach twisted in knots. That close? With that creep? He bolted out of the office, leaving James sputtering behind him.

“Where are you going?” James shouted after him as Ethan rushed toward the elevator, dialing Ivy’s number in a frenzy. No answer. “Damn it!”

By the time Ivy had downed a couple of drinks—thanks to the insistence of the guys who wanted to toast to her “talents”—she felt a mix of nausea and annoyance. The seafood dishes were lush, but she could hardly eat. 

“How come you’re not eating?” Ethan’s sleazy neighbor leaned closer, his hand brushing against her thigh. Ivy fought the urge to hurl. Instead, she gripped the edge of the table, wishing she could hurl the glass at his head. But what good would that do? She’d just end up in deeper trouble.

Instead, she downed another shot, hoping it would numb her anger. With each sip, she felt the rage simmer inside her, battling with the urge to just leave this ridiculous dinner behind. But she couldn’t afford to lose everything she had worked for. 

Tonight was about survival, and Ivy was determined to play the game, even if it meant gritting her teeth and swallowing her pride.
