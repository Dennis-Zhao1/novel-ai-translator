**Preserving a Bouquet of Flowers**

Ivy Gonzalez's marriage scandal exploded online within hours, and let me tell you, it was all anyone could talk about. Those who didn’t know her were munching popcorn, while those who did were practically ecstatic, with their phones buzzing non-stop. Initially, she tried to respond to a few messages, but soon she was too tired to even pretend to care.

Lying on her bed with her limbs sprawled out like a starfish, Ivy stared at the ceiling light, knowing full well what the messages were about. Everyone was just gossiping, wondering if the rumors were true and who she had tied the knot with. Even though she was relatively new to the industry, she’d seen enough backstabbing and fake sympathy to recognize that most of this "concern" was just an excuse to relish her downfall. With her out of the way, more advertising dollars would flow to her competitors—great for them, not so great for her.

Her phone buzzed again, and Ivy groaned, assuming it was just another nosy acquaintance. But this time, it was Sarah Martin, her old friend. It had been months since they last caught up. Every time Ivy reached out, Sarah would say she was too busy with her newborn and just couldn’t get away. Despite living in the same city, they hadn’t seen each other in ages.

With Ivy’s marriage drama splattered all over the internet, Sarah’s protective instincts kicked in. Ivy could practically hear the frustration in Sarah’s text: “They don’t know anything! They’re just bored! Why do they care about who’s marrying who?”

Reading Sarah's words made Ivy smile despite herself. She could picture Sarah’s eyes bulging and her teeth grinding in annoyance. Sarah was always the one who stood up for Ivy, refusing to let anyone push her around.

As they chatted, Ivy could hear Sarah’s baby wailing in the background, a reminder of how much things had changed. The fierce, career-driven woman Ivy once knew seemed like a distant memory.

Feeling a pang of sympathy, Ivy typed out a message: “Are you doing this all alone? What about your husband?”

Sarah replied with, “He’s busy. He doesn’t get home until late at night. Gotta run, I need to soothe the baby!”

Not wanting to pry or place blame, Ivy simply reminded her to take care of herself and to reach out if she ever needed anything.

More annoyed than ever, Ivy swung herself off the bed and pulled back the curtains, letting the winter sun flood into the room, making everything feel a bit warmer and cozier.

That’s when she remembered Ethan Clark. They hadn’t spoken since they got home last night, and she had expected him to reach out after seeing the news. Clearly, she had overestimated her importance.

Meanwhile, at the office of Pinnacle Gaming, Ethan was buried under work. He was in the middle of finalizing a new game aimed at female players, despite pushback from the higher-ups. They were convinced that their core male audience was enough to keep them afloat, so why risk it on something new?

As the clock struck eight, James Miller, his trusty right-hand man, waltzed in with takeout. He noticed Ethan was busy preserving a bunch of flowers that had been left to dry since morning.

“Hey, Ethan, dinner’s here,” James said, not wanting to disturb him but knowing he’d be oblivious if he didn’t mention it.

“Mmhmm,” Ethan replied absentmindedly, still focused on the flowers.

After a moment, he looked up at James, “If you don’t have anything else, you can head home. You’ve been here long enough.”

“Not a chance,” James said, already sidling up next to Ethan. He couldn’t help but stare at the flowers. They looked ordinary enough, yet Ethan was painstakingly preserving them. “You actually know how to do this?”

Ethan smiled slightly, absorbed in his task. “Just learned. I didn’t want to see them wilt away.”

He wanted to capture the beauty of the flowers, the memory of last night, and turn them into a piece of art to cherish when he was older. 

James shrugged, unable to fully grasp Ethan’s obsession.

“Oh, by the way,” James said, changing the subject to the latest gossip. “Did you hear that Ivy Gonzalez, the big-time streamer, interviewed at our company? I thought she was single, but apparently she’s married now.”

Ethan’s expression shifted instantly, his mood darkening. “How do you know that?”

Startled by Ethan's intensity, James quickly pulled out his phone to show him. Ethan snatched it away, and his face fell as he scrolled through the trending articles about Ivy’s marriage.

James could sense he’d stepped into dangerous territory and decided to keep quiet. Ethan’s displeasure was palpable as he stood by the massive window, deep in thought.

Normally, he’d have ordered the gossip to be taken down without a second thought, but this time he hesitated. He didn’t want to make decisions for Ivy, especially not if she would resent him for it.

After a moment of internal debate, Ethan felt a tug of concern for Ivy. Would she be able to handle the onslaught of negative comments? He glanced at the takeout James had brought, suddenly losing his appetite. He needed to check on Ivy, so he hurriedly packed up and headed home.
