**Birthday Surprises**

Ivy Gonzalez stormed back to her room, her mind racing with the events of the night before. Seriously, didn’t they say girls were supposed to play it cool? She flopped onto her bed, kicking her legs in frustration, her cheeks burning like they were caught in a summer heatwave. The worst part? Ethan Clark’s reaction when she blurted out that she liked him. He just laughed and told her to go to sleep! How was she supposed to sleep after that?

The next morning, Ivy woke up with two massive dark circles under her eyes. She tiptoed downstairs, trying to avoid running into Ethan. She had no clue how to face him now. Were they officially a thing? But did it even matter? They had already signed the marriage certificate, so why was she stressing over labels?

Determined to ignore her embarrassing confession from last night, she decided to act like it never happened. As she passed Ethan’s room, the door was ajar. Ivy cautiously pushed it open, catching a whiff of his signature scent. But to her surprise, he had already left. The bed was perfectly made, and if she didn’t know better, she might’ve thought he hadn’t spent the night there at all!

Still in a daze, she downed a full glass of water, trying to shake off the awkwardness. Ivy had just signed a contract with a company that required her to stream live and shoot short videos daily. Honestly, she had hesitated before signing. The deal was a 60/40 split, and after all their fees and platform cuts, her take-home pay wasn’t anything to write home about. But she was desperate to make some quick cash and didn’t think too long about it.

After changing into her outfit for the day—a chic white coat paired with a stylish dress—she headed to the company’s streaming setup. It was a small, cozy room with a little bar lit up in purple lights. Originally, they were supposed to stream from a local pub, but the sound quality was terrible, so they quickly shifted locations.

Inside the room, five other people were busy prepping for the broadcast. Emily Jones, the lead on this project, waved a sparkly outfit at Ivy. “You’re wearing this tonight!” she said, grinning.

Ivy glanced at the outfit. It was definitely not her style. It was shiny, low-cut, and had cutouts that would leave little to the imagination. “No way, I can’t wear this,” she shook her head.

Emily maintained her cheerful demeanor, trying to convince her. “Come on, Ivy! Most of your followers are guys. Trust me, if you wear this, your numbers will skyrocket!” 

Ivy rolled her eyes. Emily had been in the industry long enough to know how to play the game, and she was clearly envious of Ivy’s rise to fame. “I’m not wearing that!” Ivy insisted, her eyes wide and her tone firm.

Seeing Ivy's determination, Emily backed off, but not without offering another option. “Okay, how about this outfit instead? It’ll match the skincare video we’re filming later and is less revealing.”

Ivy examined the new outfit and finally agreed. It was decent enough, without any unnecessary holes or sparkles.

At 8 PM sharp, they went live. Ivy started singing as usual, but without her usual partner, Michael Wood, it felt a bit off. The accompaniment from the speaker just wasn’t the same as having someone play live.

As Ivy scanned the comments flashing on the screen, she noticed a familiar username among the crowd. It was Michael, showering her with virtual gifts and commenting, “Sounds great!”

Ivy chuckled to herself, thinking, “At least someone appreciates my singing!” Just then, the screen lit up with an influx of flashy gift animations. A new account was spamming gifts like crazy, making it impossible for Ivy to ignore. The username looked suspiciously new, likely created just for the occasion.

She raised an eyebrow but shrugged it off. After all, her recent viral video had attracted a bunch of curious viewers. Some were just there to see if she was as pretty as they’d heard.

Meanwhile, in the brightly lit office of the Feng Yi Group, Ethan Clark was finishing up some work while munching on dinner. He had never been one to multitask during meals, but tonight, he was glued to his phone, watching Ivy’s stream.

Just then, James Miller knocked and entered. “Mr. Xu, Chloe is outside…”

But before he could finish, Chloe Lopez barged in. “Ethan! Why are you just now eating?” she said, strutting in on her high heels. “I called Mom today, and she wants us over for dinner this weekend to celebrate her birthday.”

Ethan, ever so composed, flipped his phone over to hide the live stream and removed his earbuds. He figured it was about time to reveal to Chloe that he was married.

“Sounds good,” he replied, keeping his expression neutral. 

As the night unfolded, both Ivy and Ethan were about to face the truth that their lives were about to intertwine in ways neither of them expected.
