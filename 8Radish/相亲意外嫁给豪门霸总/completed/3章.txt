### The Marriage Certificate

A loud clap of thunder shattered the silence of the hospital night, and the rain began to patter softly against the windows.

Ivy Gonzalez stood frozen, unsure of how to respond to Ethan Clark. But when she saw the seriousness painted across his face, she knew he wasn’t kidding.

Just then, a doctor emerged, calling out for Grace Peterson's family. Ivy snapped back to reality and hurried over.

“The patient is in critical condition and needs heart surgery,” the doctor said.

Ivy’s mind went blank as she nodded mechanically. 

"The cost for the surgery will be around $30,000; be prepared," he continued.

The moment those numbers hit her, Ivy’s heart dropped. Where on earth was she going to get that kind of money?

Standing against the wall, she frantically scoured her contacts, hoping to find someone who could lend her some cash. She went through her list, reaching out to anyone who might help, but to no avail. 

Her mother’s gambling problems were well-known, and those who once might have lent a hand now seemed to want to run the other way.

Despair washed over her as she leaned against the wall, her eyes darting around the room until they landed on Ethan again. Suddenly, a thought struck her like a lifebuoy thrown into turbulent waters. She rushed over to him.

"Miss Lin, I know what you’re about to say, but—" Ethan started, cutting her off.

Ivy nodded, brimming with hope for what he would say next.

“You need to marry me,” he finished.

The words hit her like a bucket of cold water, chilling her heart. But at this point, who else could she turn to for immediate cash?

Ivy stood just a foot away from him, staring silently, her gaze sharp and scrutinizing. 

After a moment, Ethan clearly heard her say, “Okay.”

He wanted to say more, but she turned and plopped down in the chair across from him, arms hanging limply at her sides, eyes shut tight, as if she was trying to shut the world out.

Ethan leaned back, propping his chin on his hand, watching her with a subtle smile creeping onto his lips.

As dawn broke, Ivy looked out the window, squinting against the soft sunlight. 

The surgery room door swung open, and Grace was wheeled out. Hearing the doctor say the surgery was successful finally eased the weight on Ivy’s heart.

Seeing her mother lying in the hospital bed, Ivy grasped her hand tightly, unwilling to let go.

Ethan stayed by her side all night, and now he had gone out to grab breakfast.

He opened the food containers and turned to Ivy, saying, “Eat something before it gets cold.”

Ivy gently tucked her mother’s hand under the blanket and turned to Ethan. 

“We’re going to get our marriage certificate soon,” she declared.

Ethan didn’t look at her, just nodded in acknowledgment.

At the civil registry office, it was eerily quiet, with no other couples in sight.

The staff looked at them curiously, unable to help but ask, “It’s unusual for couples to choose this day for marriage. Are you sure you want to get married today?”

Ivy and Ethan exchanged bewildered glances. “What day is it?” Ivy asked, perplexed.

“It’s Ghost Festival!” the staff replied.

“Oh,” Ivy said, realizing.

Ethan tilted his head and asked, “Should we come back on a different day?”

Ivy didn’t respond to him. Instead, she smiled brightly at the staff, “We don’t mind; it’s just a formality, thank you!”

Seeing their determination, the staff quickly stamped their paperwork.

As they stepped out of the building, both were lost in their thoughts.

Ethan weighed the marriage certificate in his hand, a grin on his face, though his eyes were devoid of joy. 

The thought of marrying someone who looked so much like his late girlfriend, Noah Scott, excited him. Three months ago, she had died in a car accident, and they had been ready to tie the knot. 

But life had other plans, and since then, sleepless nights had become his routine. Work became his refuge, and he avoided seeing anyone until he stumbled upon Ivy’s photo—she looked just like Noah, and he couldn't let that opportunity slip away.

Ivy shoved the certificate into her bag, still grappling with her new reality. 

She adjusted the hem of her shirt; she had worn this outfit for over a day now.

With a shrug, she awkwardly glanced at Ethan, who was practically glowing with triumph.

When she caught his gaze, he quickly wiped the smile off his face, adopting a more serious demeanor. “I’ll take you back to the hospital.”

During Grace's hospital stay, Ivy had been running around like a headless chicken.

Thankfully, her mother was more alert and could speak a bit, though her voice was still faint.

Ivy sat by the bedside, peeling an apple, a gift Ethan had brought on his last visit.

“Why do you like apples so much? They’re such a hassle to eat,” Ivy grumbled as she sliced.

Grace chuckled softly, her eyes twinkling with amusement.

A nurse wheeled in a cart filled with medicine, glancing around the room until she asked, “Is that handsome guy not here today?”

Ivy looked confused, thinking the nurse must be in the wrong room.

Just then, Ethan walked in, and the nurse’s eyes lit up at the sight of him.

He came in with more gifts and apples, placing them on the table.

Ivy watched him intently, biting into her apple with frustration. She still resented Ethan for forcing her into this marriage for money.

Grace, lacking the energy to speak much, waved him over with a smile.

Ethan asked Grace how she was feeling, “Are you feeling any better today?”

Grace nodded with a smile, and upon learning that Ethan hadn’t eaten yet, she urged Ivy to take him out for food.

Now, Ivy couldn’t dare defy her mother, fearing another health scare.

She brushed past Ethan, filling a glass with warm water and setting it within Grace’s reach, then handing her the peeled apple before finally heading downstairs with Ethan.

Grace’s room was on the seventh floor, and the elevator was packed. They stood closely together, the cramped space forcing them into each other.

Ethan’s tall frame made him stand out in the crowded elevator.

He caught a glimpse of Ivy in the mirrored doors, her hair messy, dark circles under her eyes, and fatigue etched all over her face.

“What do you want to eat?” Ivy asked in a hushed tone, trying not to disturb the others.

But her voice was too soft, and Ethan leaned closer, determined to hear her.

The sudden nearness made Ivy’s heart race, and she instinctively tried to create space but found no escape, the scent of his fresh cologne engulfing her senses.

Ivy blinked at him, her neck flushing with warmth. Embarrassed, she stuttered, “Let’s talk about it outside.”

Inside, she screamed at herself, *Stay calm!*
