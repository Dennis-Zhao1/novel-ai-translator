**The Grand Finale**

Ethan Clark pulled down the rolled-up sleeve of his shirt just enough to cover the fresh wound. He glanced at Ivy Gonzalez, who was silently organizing the scattered bandages in the medical kit. It was hard to believe that just a few days ago, they were enjoying their vacation together, and now everything had turned upside down.

It felt like Ivy was drifting further away from him, their relationship so fragile it could pop like a bubble with the lightest touch. 

Ivy finally stood up, carrying the medical kit as she walked out of the room. When she returned, she leaned against the doorframe with her arms crossed, raising an eyebrow at him. “Aren’t you leaving? Waiting for me to take you in?”

Ethan didn’t know where this idea came from, but he felt like if he walked out now, it’d be the end of whatever they had. He suddenly pleaded, “Can I stay just one night? I’ll take the couch.”

Ivy paused, clearly taken aback. 

He looked out the window, a lightbulb going off in his head. “It’s raining, and it wouldn’t be safe for me to leave right now.”

Ivy stepped over to the window, confirming his words as she saw the steady drizzle outside. Spring was definitely a rainy season. She pulled the curtains shut and turned back to Ethan, finally conceding, “Fine.”

After pushing him out of her personal space, Ivy quickly closed the door behind her.

Later that night, Ivy got up to use the bathroom and noticed Ethan sitting on the couch, staring blankly at the wall, clearly unable to sleep. Curious, she walked over and poked him a few times.

No response. She nudged him a little harder.

Finally, Ethan slowly lifted his head, his eyes filled with anxiety. In a sudden rush, he wrapped his arms around Ivy, holding her tightly as if afraid she might slip away. “You can hate me, yell at me, but please don’t push me away. Let me stay by your side.”

Ivy was taken aback, unsure where to put her hands. Hearing his desperate plea sent a jolt through her heart, and her hands instinctively moved to his back. “Okay,” she whispered softly.

Ethan looked up in surprise, cupping her face with his hands, searching her eyes for reassurance. But Ivy’s gaze dropped, making it hard to tell if she was comforting him or truly willing to let him stay.

He gently insisted, “Look at me. Are you sure?”

“Yes,” Ivy confirmed, her voice steady. It felt like they had never had this chance to openly express their feelings before.

Ethan reached into his pocket and pulled out the necklace he had given her ages ago. She had returned it when she left, and now he held it out in front of her, the pendant glimmering under the light. 

He then took out a ring he had kept hidden away. “This was part of a set.”

Ivy froze, thinking it was his wedding ring from Noah Scott. Tears welled in her eyes as she examined the ring closely. She took Ethan’s hand, gently slipping the ring back onto his finger.

“We always seem to misunderstand each other,” Ivy said with a bittersweet smile, tears streaming down her cheeks.

Ethan tenderly wiped away her tears, whispering, “I deserve this.”

He placed the necklace back around her neck, the cool touch reminding Ivy that everything happening between them felt very real.

No more games, no more misunderstandings.

When Ivy tried to visit Liam Harris again, she learned from her friend Dai Yin that he had been transferred to a prison in another city and was refusing all visitors, even Dai Yin. “I don’t want you to see me like this,” he had said.

Ivy sought a lawyer to help him appeal, but he rejected every offer, seemingly content with how things had turned out.

Dai Yin simply shrugged, “Let him be.”

Since the incident with Liam, Dai Yin had changed, becoming quiet and withdrawn, rarely reaching out to Ivy.

On another night, Ivy found herself at a small bar, and to her surprise, Michael Wood was there again. This time, he wasn’t playing guitar but singing on stage.

“Didn’t he used to avoid singing here?” Ivy asked Emma Ward.

Emma leaned against the bar, “He said it gets the girls’ attention.” She leaned closer to Ivy and whispered, “I heard he got dumped by a girl who loved his singing.”

Ivy squinted at Michael, who was grinning at a girl in the audience, acting like a total show-off. He even squatted down to let someone touch his face. 

Ivy felt a pang of disappointment. Was this really the dreamer who once loved music?

After finishing her drink, she stepped out of the bar, knowing she probably wouldn’t return. It was no longer the place she remembered.

As she walked out, she spotted Ethan's car parked outside. She flashed him a smile and hurried over to get in. 

Ethan took her hand, grinning. “Leaving so soon?”

Ivy glanced back at the bar, noticing the last letter of the sign was out, and chuckled. “I need to cut back on drinking. My voice is hoarse from all the live streams lately.”

Ethan playfully squeezed her hand. “Finally getting the message, huh?”

They shared a laugh as they drove away from the bar, leaving all the past behind them.
