### A Snowy Surprise: A College Romance

Ethan Clark was in a great mood as he set off for work. After all, what could go wrong when you’ve just had a whirlwind marriage with a mysterious beauty? 

As he strolled into the office, he spotted Lucas Smith lounging on the couch outside, sipping coffee like he was waiting for a train that would never come. The moment Lucas saw him, he shot up like a jack-in-the-box, eyes wide and expectant.

“Who is she?” Lucas demanded, slamming the office door behind her with a determined look.

Ethan shuffled some papers on his desk, giving her just a sidelong glance as he booted up his computer. “Chloe Nelson. Don’t waste your time on me,” he replied, his tone dismissive.

That single sentence left Lucas speechless. But she was not one to back down so easily. After all, she had known Ethan since they were kids. She had spent her entire life shadowing him, mirroring his interests, and even following him to the same schools. When she heard the news about Noah Scott’s death, she thought maybe it was finally her turn. And now? Now some random girl swoops in and steals her thunder!

Fury bubbling inside her, Lucas flipped Ethan’s neatly organized documents onto the floor, tears welling up in her big brown eyes. “Do you even know I divorced for you?” she cried, her voice breaking.

She looked so heartbreakingly cute with her flushed cheeks and tear-streaked face that Ethan couldn’t help but feel a twinge of regret. But he had seen all too many of her tearful tantrums. 

Sighing, he picked up a toppled coffee cup and said, “I can’t give you what you want.” 

This was a line he had repeated to her countless times, but it didn’t seem to stick.

Lucas huffed, crossing her arms defiantly. “If I can’t have it, neither will you,” she shot back, storming out of the office, tears streaming down her face like a sad movie scene.

Just then, James Miller, Ethan’s right-hand man, walked in and noticed the mess. “Uh, is everything okay here?” he asked, glancing at the scattered papers on the floor.

“Yeah, just another day in paradise,” Ethan replied dryly, clearly annoyed as he continued to pick up the mess. “What do you care if she shows up tomorrow or not?”

James shrugged, “Just thought I’d check since she seems a little... emotional.”

Meanwhile, outside, the snow kept falling, blanketing everything like a giant fluffy comforter. 

Ivy Gonzalez was bundled in her deep brown wool coat, stepping through the thick layer of snow on her way to the local pub. She stopped short at the sight of Sophia Bennett, perched precariously on a ladder, adjusting an outdoor sign. 

“Hey! You shouldn’t be up there alone!” Ivy called, tucking her hands into her pockets against the chill.

Sophia glanced down, his face lighting up in a grin. “I’ll be fine! Just trying to get this sign up before it gets any worse out here.”

Ivy couldn’t help but roll her eyes and moved closer, steadying the ladder for him. “You’re going to freeze your tail off, you know that?”

Once Sophia was safely back on solid ground, Ivy couldn’t help but laugh at the snow piling atop his hat. “You’ve got a bit of snow there,” she pointed out, giggling.

“Oh, great,” Sophia chuckled, brushing the snow off while trying to look nonchalant. 

As they stepped inside the warm pub, the heat wrapped around them like a cozy blanket. “Ah, so warm!” Ivy sighed, shedding her coat.

Sophia watched her, his gaze lingering on her rosy cheeks and bright smile. “About yesterday... I might have overreacted,” he said softly, his fingers tracing the rim of his warm cup.

Ivy waved her hand dismissively. “It’s all good! Let’s just forget it. But seriously, why are you trying to do everything alone? We could have waited for others.”

“I just wanted to handle it myself,” he replied, a flicker of determination in his eyes.

Ivy nodded, understanding his drive. She took a sip of her tea, her mind racing as she thought about going live on TikTok soon. 

Just as she was about to suggest it, Sophia leaned in closer, his voice low and hesitant. “So, um, do you want to try something with me?”

Ivy blinked, her heart racing as she considered what he meant. Was he asking her out? Or was it something else entirely? Either way, the snowy day just got a lot more interesting.
