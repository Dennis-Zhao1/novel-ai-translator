**Love Yourself First**

The kitchen was a chaotic mess, smoke curling in the air like a scene from a horror movie. Ivy Gonzalez was wrapped in an apron, wielding a spatula in one hand while the other held a frying pan lid. Fish was sizzling in the pan, and the oil was popping like it was auditioning for a fireworks show. Every crackle made her shuffle back, trying to escape the culinary battlefield.

“Wow, looks like you're fighting a war in there!” Ethan Clark leaned against the doorframe, chuckling at the spectacle.

Ivy furrowed her brow and shot him a defiant look. “It’s just cooking! If you’d pay attention, you could learn a thing or two.”

Just then, a rogue droplet of hot oil leaped out and splattered on her wrist. “Ow!” Ivy yelped, pulling her hand back instinctively.

Ethan rushed over, turning off the heat and covering the pan. He ushered her to the sink, running cold water over her wrist. “Seriously, it’s freezing! Why are you doing this to yourself?”

“I’m fine!” Ivy protested, but the cold water was making her want to curl up into a ball. Ethan held her hand firmly, a gentle reminder that she couldn’t escape.

After a moment of cooling, he led her away from the kitchen. “So, what suddenly inspired this cooking endeavor?” he asked, applying ointment to her wrist with a curious expression.

Ivy couldn’t help but gaze at him. The way the kitchen light cast a halo around him made her heart flutter. “I mean, it’s good to learn new skills, right? I can’t rely on you to cook for me forever.” She blew gently on her wrist, hoping it would ease the sting. “Who knows? Maybe I’ll become a food vlogger someday!”

Ethan raised an eyebrow, clearly skeptical. “Uh-huh. Good luck with that.”

Ivy pouted. “You don’t believe in me? Fine, whatever.”

“Ivy,” he said, taking her small hand in his big one, “there’s no need to force yourself to do things you don’t enjoy. You don’t even like cooking.”

The oil in the pan had finally quieted down, creating an awkward silence between them.

Ivy looked down at Ethan’s round face, and suddenly, she was serious. “I might not love cooking, but you have to eat—no matter how bad it is, you have to eat it.”

Ethan dramatically groaned, following her back into the kitchen to be her sous-chef. He watched the pan like a hawk, muttering things like “too much salt,” “you’re going to burn it,” and “are you trying to poison me?”

“You’re driving me crazy!” Ivy snapped, her patience wearing thin.

“Without me, you’d be in even bigger trouble,” Ethan replied, his tone deadpan. “If I get food poisoning and can’t make it to the gala on Saturday, I’m blaming you.”

“Saturday?” Ivy’s heart sank. She had hoped to spend New Year’s Eve with him.

Ethan flipped the fish, muttering, “Yep, definitely burnt.”

Dinner was a blur for Ivy, her mind swirling with thoughts. Ethan had never publicly acknowledged her, almost as if he was hiding her away, and that left her feeling uneasy. Back in the day, she wouldn’t have cared about such things, but now? Now, she wanted more.

“Do you think he has other women on the side?” Ivy mused, spearing a piece of crispy meat with a toothpick at the bar.

Emma Ward smirked, pouring drinks for nearby customers. “Maybe, but I can tell Ethan’s different with you.”

Ivy took a sip of her drink and laughed. “You’re defending him like you two are best buds. Aren’t I your friend?”

“Please, I’ve seen more men come through this place than you’ve had hot dinners!” Emma teased, patting Ivy’s shoulder before heading back to serve.

Ivy rolled her eyes, but her gaze drifted toward the entrance. A group of guests had arrived, and they looked important. The men were tall, clad in black leather jackets and jeans, while the women wore chic outfits that screamed high-fashion, even beneath their masks. The couple at the center stood out, their charisma palpable.

Soon, Emma escorted them upstairs to the VIP area. Ivy watched for a moment before turning her attention back to the stage.

The new singer was incredible, making Ivy feel a bit envious as she noticed Michael Wood sulking with his new guitar. “That guitar must’ve cost a fortune,” Ivy commented to her friend, Moon.

Without missing a beat, Moon replied, “I bought it for him!”

Ivy’s jaw dropped. She knew Moon’s paycheck and how frugal she usually was. “Wait, what? You’re kidding, right?”

Moon shrugged, a grin on her face. “He deserves it!”

Ivy thought about telling her to love herself first, but who was she to give advice?

Just then, Emma returned, leaning close to Ivy. “Those people upstairs look like celebrities. Too bad I don’t recognize most of them.”

“Really?” Moon perked up, glancing upward. “They do look interesting.”

Ivy was distracted by her phone buzzing with a message from Daisy. “Is this the bar you used to perform at? Looks awesome!” She attached a photo of the VIP guests.

Ivy zoomed in and realized the group included the very people they had just seen. Quick as a flash, she typed back, “You seem to know a lot. Is the view better from the second floor?” She glanced up, spotting Daisy chatting with an unknown guy. Daisy’s eyes darted around, searching for Ivy.

Their eyes met, and Daisy waved her over, mouthing “Come up!”

Ivy shook her head, feeling shy. She preferred the solitude of the bar, far from the spotlight and the awkwardness of mingling.

Daisy approached, sitting down beside her. “Aren’t you bored sitting here alone?” she asked, looking around.

Ivy smiled weakly. “I’m used to it. I used to perform on that very stage.”

As Daisy settled in, Ivy felt the eyes of the crowd gravitate towards them, making her squirm in her seat. 

“Let’s go,” Daisy urged, grabbing Ivy's hand. “Meet some new people; it’ll be fun!”
