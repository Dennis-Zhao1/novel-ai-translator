**The Drama of Ivy and Ethan: A Snowy Farewell**

The snow fell thick and heavy, turning the city into a winter wonderland where directions seemed meaningless. Ivy Gonzalez stood at the curb, her mind as blank as the white landscape before her. She didn’t even know where she wanted to go.

Just then, a taxi pulled up, and she jumped in, escaping the cold. As the car rolled past towering skyscrapers, Ivy felt an emptiness inside her. This city had lost its charm; it held nothing for her anymore. She was alone.

The driver took a glance at her through the rearview mirror, sensing her despair. “Bad breakup? Or maybe you lost your job?” he asked in an attempt to lighten the mood. “Don’t sweat it, though; life’s a long road.”

That was the last straw. Ivy burst into tears, her face buried in her hands. She had always tried to be strong, especially around Ethan Clark, afraid of being a burden in their uneven relationship. But deep down, she knew she was just a placeholder for someone else’s affection.

In her heart, she felt like any woman with her looks could have easily taken her place.

After a long, aimless ride around the city, Ivy finally had the driver take her home. Once inside, she stood in the middle of her living room, looking around and shivering at the thought of Noah Scott, who had once shared this space with her.

As she passed the kitchen, her eyes landed on a photo of happier times displayed on the fridge. With a surge of anger, she tore it off and shredded it into pieces, throwing the remnants into the trash before heading upstairs.

Ivy pulled out her suitcase and began packing away everything that belonged to her. On her vanity, she spotted a delicate box containing the diamond ring Ethan had given her. Holding it up to the light, she suddenly felt it was more like a shackle than a gift, binding her to a life she didn’t want.

With a heavy heart, she removed her necklace and placed both it and the ring into the box, sealing it shut. She never wanted to see anything related to Ethan again.

Meanwhile, Ethan was in his car, trying Ivy's number over and over, but all he got was the dreaded “The number you dialed is busy; please try again later.” After hanging up in frustration, he called his friend Lucas Smith.

“Wow, Ethan, look who’s calling me! I didn’t think you’d ever reach out,” Lucas said lazily from a spa, where he was getting a massage.

“Where’s Ivy?” Ethan’s voice was cold and sharp.

Lucas chuckled. “How would I know? You’re the one marrying her, not me.”

“Lucas!” Ethan shouted, finally losing his cool.

Seeing Ethan on the edge made Lucas smirk; he thrived on Ethan’s frustration. “Things can’t always go perfectly, right? I just wanted to watch you lose it, like I have.”

When Ethan reached the cinema, he found the staff changing the movie screening. Their worried expressions only fueled his anxiety as he searched for Ivy but came up empty.

As night fell, he sped home, taking three steps at a time up the stairs. He flicked on the lights and surveyed the disarray of Ivy’s unmade bed—signs of her presence still lingering but nothing else.

Sinking to the floor beside the bed, Ethan chuckled bitterly. This scene felt like a twisted déjà vu.

Just then, he noticed something under his foot. It was a mint-green cigarette pack. He picked it up, staring at it aimlessly, then took one and shoved it into his pocket.

When Emma Ward saw Ethan walk in with a cigarette, her eyes widened in surprise. He looked like a man utterly defeated.

“Is Ivy not coming with you?” she asked, trying to read his expression.

Ignoring her, he stomped over to his spot on the couch, only to find someone else sitting there.

“Get up,” he barked, shoving his hands in his pockets and glaring at the person, who looked utterly bewildered.

When the person refused to budge, Ethan snapped. He grabbed a drink from a nearby table and smashed it on the floor, shouting, “Get out of my seat!”

That finally got a reaction, and the other patron swung at him. Ethan didn’t flinch; he just closed his eyes and tilted his head back, almost wishing for a good beating. It was a pathetic display, but he felt like he deserved it.

Sophia Bennett rushed over, pulling Ethan back. “Sorry about that! He’s just had too much to drink; can we move you to VIP instead? Tonight’s on us.”

Once the other patrons had vacated the seat, Ethan pushed past Sophia, collapsing into the booth like a puddle of despair.

“Looks like you need this,” Sophia said, dropping two bottles of whiskey in front of him.

Without a word, he grabbed one and chugged it down, desperate to drown out his thoughts. His eyes were fixed on the stage where someone else was singing, and he couldn’t help but scoff. “Why doesn’t this girl look more like Noah Scott?”

Sophia rolled her eyes. “I’m not you,” she replied, unfazed. 

“True,” he murmured, taking another swig. “You can’t get what you want.”

“Yeah, well, I’m not the one making a fool of myself,” she shot back.

“Ivy’s gone. Where did she even go?” Sophia finally asked, voicing what they were all thinking.

Ethan clenched the bottle, his voice icy. “How would I know?”

After finishing one bottle, he cracked open another.

“Then go find her,” Sophia insisted, her tone sharp.

Ethan squinted his eyes at her. “Why bother? There are plenty of girls who look like her.”

Sophia raised an eyebrow, seeing the darkness clouding his expression. “You’d better hope you’re not that careless.”

As she leaned against the bar, deep in thought, she warned, “It’s best we don’t meddle in their affairs. Let’s just keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn’t do anything stupid.” 

And that was the start of a long night, filled with misunderstandings, heartbreak, and the hope that maybe, just maybe, things would work out in the end—or at least get more interesting.
