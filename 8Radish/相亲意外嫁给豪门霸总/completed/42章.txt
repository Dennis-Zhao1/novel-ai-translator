**Turning Heartache into Comfort Food**

They say you can turn heartache into hunger. 

Ivy Gonzalez was living proof of that as she plopped down in front of the TV, having devoured ten crispy chicken wings, two cups of soda, and a smorgasbord of fried snacks neatly laid out on the coffee table. As she licked her fingers, she realized she could probably keep going. 

Right now, food was her only escape. Ivy’s mind raced with thoughts about her job and what it would mean to break her contract. Leaving her company could mean a major hit to her income, and she had to consider Grace Peterson back home—their living expenses and daily medical bills were no joke. Just thinking about it made her want to scream.

Just then, she heard the front door swing open. It was Ethan Clark, finally back from whatever work had kept him away. 

But wait—didn’t they have a little cold war situation going on? Ivy couldn’t quite figure out what had gone wrong. Last night, he had strolled in with a bouquet of flowers, not even bothering to say hello. When she asked if he was hungry, he just ignored her, breezing past like she didn’t exist. 

Ivy was still fuming. Cold wars? Please, who didn’t know how to handle one of those?

Even though she knew he had come back, she refused to turn around. Instead, she pretended to be totally engrossed in her snack situation, even as her ears perked up for his footsteps. She silently promised herself she wouldn’t be the one to break the silence. That would just be embarrassing.

Ethan, however, was eyeing her from the couch. Seriously, how could she focus on a movie while munching away like that? He had rushed back from work, and here she was, chowing down like it was Thanksgiving!

He plopped down on the couch beside her, close enough that their knees were practically touching, but still refusing to say a word. Classic Ethan. 

Ivy scooted away, determined not to give in this time. Why should it always be her who made the first move? Not today!

Ethan smirked, noticing her attempt to create distance. The more she pulled away, the closer he inched toward her, clearly enjoying this little game of avoidance.

As he settled in, Ivy found it impossible to focus on the movie. She was chewing on her food like it was gum, completely distracted by the intensity of his gaze boring into her back. 

The tension in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife. 

She sighed internally, realizing he had won this round. How could someone who hated awkwardness be so good at creating it?

“Wanna eat something?” she blurted out, trying to sound casual but failing miserably.

Inside, she was certain Ethan would turn her down; he wouldn’t touch this junk food with a ten-foot pole. But, to her surprise, he leaned forward and said he would!

He grabbed a sausage skewer and took a big bite. The moment he did, he winced, letting out a small hiss that made Ivy burst into laughter. 

Ethan’s brow furrowed as he coughed, clearly overwhelmed by the spice. Ivy had a knack for ordering things extra spicy, and for her, it was all about that kick. 

“C’mon, if you can’t handle it, don’t force it!” Ivy teased, a grin plastered across her face.

With his stubbornness kicking in, Ethan chugged some water and took another massive bite, determined to prove he could handle it. His face turned red, but he soldiered on until he finished the entire thing.

When he was done, he looked over at Ivy with a smug expression, raising an eyebrow as if to say, “Did you see that?”

“Yeah, great job, superstar,” Ivy said, feigning a yawn. 

Ethan, undeterred, replied with a grin, “Thanks, I know.”

And just like that, silence fell again between them. 

Ivy went back to her chicken wings, her fingers getting all greasy as she reached for a napkin. Just as she was about to grab one, Ethan’s hand shot out, snatching it up before she could.

“Hold on,” he said coolly, his voice smooth and deep, which oddly made her heart race a little. 

He took his time, carefully wiping her hands as if they were made of porcelain. Ivy couldn’t help but think about how his obsession with cleanliness was a little over the top.

“So, what are you gonna do about the mess online?” Ethan finally asked, breaking the long silence. 

“Honestly? I can’t control what people say. If they want to talk, let them talk!” Ivy chuckled, though it was a bit forced. “The good news is, no one knows you’re the one I’m married to.”

Honestly, it was a relief for Ivy. She didn’t want to drag Ethan into her drama. That would have been way too much!

Ethan leaned back on the couch, smirking as he balled up the now-damp napkin. “You really think I care about that?”

Ivy raised an eyebrow, surprised. He couldn’t be serious! 

Ethan couldn’t help but chuckle at how clueless she was sometimes. He had never met anyone quite like Ivy—so innocent, so unassuming. Unlike Noah Scott, who would have demanded attention and made it all about her. 

Noah was a force of nature, and he had joined her band back in college just to keep the peace. They had played countless gigs together, and it was always a whirlwind of drama. 

But Ivy? She was different. She was like a breath of fresh air, and he could just be himself around her. Even when things got messy, she made it all feel like a ridiculous adventure.

In the midst of all this, as Ivy munched away at her chicken wings, Ethan couldn’t help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over him. Those college days might be gone, but chilling with Ivy felt just as good.
