**Title: The Price of Secrets**

Ivy Gonzalez stared blankly at her half-finished bowl of wontons. Normally, she could polish off two bowls without breaking a sweat, but today, she felt like she could barely manage one. 

“Are you going to give me another chance?” Ethan Clark asked softly, glancing up at her.

Ivy tightened her grip on the spoon, her voice cold. “You don’t need to waste your time on me, and you certainly don’t need to feel sorry for me. You can find countless replacements for Noah Scott, so don’t bother coming to me.”

Ethan opened his mouth to explain the ring situation, but Ivy cut him off, “No need for explanations. It’s not my problem.”

Frustration bubbled inside Ethan as he watched her icy demeanor. Without thinking, he stood up, grabbed her arm, and practically shoved her into his car.

“Can’t we just talk like normal people? Let go of me!” Ivy protested, trying to push him away and escape.

But Ethan was relentless, forcing her down into the seat and buckling her in, completely ignoring her protests. Ivy hated this treatment—she shoved and kicked, her arms flailing like a windmill.

In a heated moment, she slapped him right where she had last night. 

Silence enveloped the car, thick and suffocating. Ivy froze, surprised by her own action. She hadn’t meant to hit him, but somehow, it felt justified. 

Ethan’s expression darkened as he pulled away from her and slammed the door shut. 

The atmosphere in the car was eerily quiet. Ivy couldn't bear to look at him; his presence was like a cold shadow that made her shiver. Wasn’t she just a stand-in? Always wearing a frown for someone else’s benefit?

As they drove deeper into an unfamiliar area, Ivy finally broke the silence. “Where are you taking me?”

He didn’t respond, only maintaining a brooding silence. 

“Say something, or I’m calling the cops,” Ivy threatened, holding up her phone. She didn’t think Ethan would actually do anything reckless, but then he slammed on the gas, and she nearly dropped her phone in shock.

“Are you crazy?!” she yelled. 

Ethan’s lips were pressed into a thin line as he continued to speed, merging into lanes without a care in the world. 

Feeling like she was in a car with a lunatic, Ivy shut her eyes, wishing for the ride to end. If they crashed, at least she’d be taking him down with her. After all, he’d be the one losing out more.

When she finally opened her eyes again, Ethan was leaning over her, unbuckling her seatbelt. Ivy smacked his hand away. “I don’t need your help!”

Surprisingly, he complied and withdrew his hand. 

As they stepped out of the car, Ivy realized they had arrived at a cemetery. A chill ran down her spine as she instinctively wanted to retreat back into the car.

Ethan took her hand, his expression serious. “Come on. Noah Scott is here.”

Ivy’s mind was still catching up to his words as he led her inside. The place was filled with stairs, and for every two steps they took, there seemed to be three more. She followed, glancing around nervously.

In the distance, she could see a barren mountain, half hidden in the clouds and half basking in sunlight.

“There it is,” Ethan said, stopping in front of a gravestone that bore Noah Scott’s smiling face, just like the one she had seen in the proposal video.

“Why did you bring me here?” Ivy demanded.

Ethan knelt before the gravestone, brushing away the dead leaves and wilted flowers. He gently touched the engraved name. “I just wanted to tell you that I’ve moved on from her.”

The wind tousled his hair, and for a moment, Ivy believed him. 

She placed her hand on his shoulder, resolving not to dwell on whether he still had feelings for Noah. What mattered was that he seemed to have let go of the past.

But when Ethan placed his hand over hers, she instinctively pulled back. He might have moved on, but for Ivy, the real issue was that she’d been a substitute for far too long.

It was a thorn in her side—a constant reminder that their relationship had started on shaky ground.

Ethan looked up, confusion etched on his face. He didn’t understand why Ivy still couldn’t accept him.

Feeling awkward, she shoved her hands into her pockets. “It’s cold. Let’s go back! Next time, just bring some flowers.”

Ethan nodded, standing up. 

On their way back, Ivy kept her hands tucked away, walking briskly to the car and jumping inside. The ride back felt like an eternity, with every second stretching out painfully. After Ethan had bared his heart to her, Ivy felt a surge of anxiety. She couldn’t go on treating Noah like a sword when it had become too complicated.

She couldn't face the truth about how she'd been deceived for so long.

At a traffic light, Ethan clasped her hand on her lap, intertwining their fingers slowly. Ivy knew he was looking at her, but she couldn’t bear to meet his gaze, afraid to pull away yet equally terrified to hold on. 

He was waiting for her answer—the one about this morning. He wanted her to choose him.

“Ivy,” he said softly, coaxing her.

She quickly retracted her hand, pointing at the traffic light. “Green! We can go now.” She practically shoved her hand back into her pocket, feeling like she was escaping.

When Ethan dropped Ivy off at home, he drove away without a word. 

Ivy stumbled into her house, gulping down water like it was a life raft. What was wrong with that guy? He was like a pro in the game of love, and here she was, drowning in confusion.

She flopped onto the couch, releasing a long sigh. Being an adult was exhausting!

Just then, her phone buzzed, waking her from her thoughts. A number she hadn’t seen in ages flashed on the screen. After a moment of hesitation, she answered.

“Hello?”

Sophia Bennett stood by Noah Scott’s gravestone, flowers in hand. “I saw you with Ethan earlier. Sorry for not interrupting.”

Ivy remained silent, knowing Sophia was one of the culprits in this mess.

After a brief pause, Sophia continued, “I’m sorry for hiding things. I genuinely hope you find happiness in the new year.”

Before Ivy could respond, the call ended. 

Staring at her black-screened phone, Ivy felt a wave of disbelief. Everyone seemed to brush off the pain they had caused her with a casual apology. But she was the one left hurting.

What did forgiveness even mean if it didn’t change anything? 

Feeling overwhelmed, she tossed her phone aside, not wanting to think about it anymore.

Meanwhile, back at Ethan's family home, his father was there, bursting with fury. Gone was the calm demeanor he usually wore; now, he was all about threats and intimidation.

“I want $6 million and that villa in the south, or the family secrets are going online tomorrow!” 

Ethan’s father knew the family’s reputation was everything, and he was banking on that.

Ethan tossed his car keys onto the table, leaning back in his chair. “So, what scandal is worth $6 million and a house?”
