**New Job**

Ivy Gonzalez was totally baffled by Ethan Clark's sudden demand for her to quit smoking. Seriously, who does that? It was almost as if he thought he could wave a magic wand and change her life overnight. Sure, she’d heard the rumors about how intense he was at work—like, the dude was practically a workaholic. He had this reputation for being super strict with his employees, and the thought of leveraging his connections to snag a job seemed utterly impossible.

Tossing and turning in bed, Ivy couldn't shake off the nagging thought about his ridiculous request. Was this some twisted crush of his, or just a power trip? Who knew. When morning rolled around, her brain was still in a fog. She wrestled with the idea of playing nice and just accepting his so-called "advice" as a way to keep her job. But come on, how lame would that be?

After a good think, Ivy finally slammed her fingers down on her phone, typing out a bold response: "I don’t accept."

Meanwhile, Ethan Clark was chillin’ in his office, waiting for HR to show up when his phone buzzed. Glancing at the screen, he saw Ivy's message and couldn’t help but smirk. Well, look at her being all feisty.

On the other hand, Ivy tossed her phone aside, not daring to look at it again. She peered out the window at the towering evergreens swaying in the breeze and let out a sigh. Was it really worth it to cling to her pride? Did she really want to keep her life so complicated when Ethan was clearly willing to help her out? But no, she couldn’t just roll over and let him dictate her lifestyle. 

As she searched her pockets, hoping to find a cigarette to calm her nerves, she instead stumbled upon a business card. The memory of that gorgeous girl from the bar popped into her mind. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to reach out. After all, what was worse than living paycheck to paycheck?

When Ivy arrived at the bar, the place was buzzing with activity. The roar of luxury cars outside reminded her of her beat-up old clunker. She couldn’t help but chuckle, thinking she’d probably only get enough money from selling it to buy a tire for those fancy wheels.

Emma Ward, the dazzling bartender from that night, welcomed her with open arms, throwing an arm around her shoulder. Ivy felt a little overwhelmed by her enthusiasm but went with it, trying to keep her awkward smile in check as they headed inside.

They walked into a dimly lit room furnished with a cozy sofa and a desk. On the sofa, a guy with shaggy hair was strumming a guitar. Emma knocked on the door a few times, and the guy looked up.

“Michael Wood, this is our new singer—Ivy Gonzalez,” Emma introduced, and Ivy nodded, feeling her nerves flare as Michael simply gave a curt nod before diving back into his guitar.

They both settled into opposite corners of the sofa in a silence that felt thicker than the air. Ivy’s heart raced with anxiety. She’d only ever sung karaoke for fun; the thought of performing in front of a crowd felt like jumping off a cliff.

“First time on stage?” Michael asked, catching her off guard.

Is it that obvious? Ivy blinked, caught off guard. She managed a sheepish laugh. “Nah, I've sung before… just not in this kind of setting. It’s my first day, you know?”

Michael took a sip of his drink and offered some words of encouragement, “No pressure; no one’s here to actually listen anyway.”

Just as Ivy was about to respond, Emma stood up, guitar in hand. “Alright, let’s hit the stage!”

Ivy followed behind Michael, each step feeling heavier than the last. She kept muttering to herself, "Don’t chicken out!" 

When they stepped onto the stage, she was met with a sea of faces. Her heart dropped as she realized how many people were there—all dressed to the nines. It was like stepping into a fashion magazine.

But just as Michael said, most people were too busy socializing, sipping their drinks, and scrolling through their phones to pay her much attention. A few even lifted their phones up to snap a pic, and Ivy couldn’t help but feel like a deer caught in headlights.

As the ethereal sound of the guitar filled the air, Ivy took a deep breath and began to sing. Her voice trembled a bit, but she tried to ride the rhythm of the music. 

People gradually turned their heads toward her, noticing the girl with the sleeveless dress and porcelain skin under the spotlight. There were definitely some snaps being taken, and she felt a mix of embarrassment and thrill. 

From the bar, a girl named Lila crossed her arms and watched Ivy with keen interest, noting her shaky performance. 

“Did she just go off-key?” a waitress whispered to Emma.

Emma, however, only chuckled, “Who cares? She’s got the looks!”

Once Ivy stepped off stage, her face was flushed with embarrassment, knowing she hadn’t nailed it. She approached Emma, ready to apologize, but Emma beat her to it, showering her with compliments about her performance.

“You were great! Solid stage presence, too!”

Ivy felt a pang of guilt accepting the praise, but hey, it was a start, right? 

Michael, who had been eavesdropping, couldn’t believe Emma’s words. This was not the Emma he knew! After Ivy left the room, he waltzed over to Emma, drink in hand, and sat down.

“Seriously? Partnering with her feels like a waste of my talent,” he said, shaking his head. 

Michael was a perfectionist when it came to music. He played multiple instruments and practiced tirelessly. He didn’t expect Ivy to be a superstar, but he at least hoped she could stay on pitch!

Emma smirked at him, “Oh, come on! If she’s not great, she’ll just learn. Give her a chance!”

Michael sighed, knowing he was in for a lot of work with Ivy around.

By the time Ivy got home, it was way past midnight. Exhausted from the night, she dropped onto her couch, ready to crash. 

Suddenly, a loud banging at the door jolted her awake. 

Knock! Knock! Knock!

Ivy’s heart raced. Who could that be? 

Peeking through the peephole, she saw a shadow standing outside, and to her horror, the figure was looking back at her!

Panic set in, and she stumbled back. Who were they? What did they want?
