**The Deal**

The rain had stopped, and the sun was shining brightly.

Ivy Gonzalez was driving her little car, a gift from her dad, toward the hospital. After parking on the side of the road, she remembered that her mom loved the pastries from the bakery on the next street, so she decided to stroll over and pick some up.

As she passed by a shop, she noticed the door was shut tight. It was a glass door, but she couldn’t see anything inside. Curious, she peered in and glanced down at a job listing posted by the entrance that mentioned they were hiring part-time help. 

Just as she was about to leave, the door swung open. A stunning woman with a sharp jawline and dark red hair stepped out quickly, blocking Ivy's path.

"Are you looking for a job?" the woman asked.

Ivy raised an eyebrow, feeling a bit wary of this stranger. The woman was definitely a looker. 

"No, just bored and checking things out," Ivy replied, trying to sidestep her.

The woman flashed a sweet smile. "Come in! We have a great atmosphere here, and our clientele is made up of high-income folks."

Ivy started to realize this was not just any ordinary job offer. "I don’t have money to spend; I’m not your target customer."

The woman waved off her concerns and half-pulled Ivy inside. 

Once inside, Ivy was struck by the luxurious decor. The plush sofas looked like they would be incredibly comfortable to sink into. It was still early in the day, and only a few staff members were setting things up at the counter. They glanced at Ivy as she walked in but quickly returned to their work.

The woman led her on a brief tour, explaining, “This is an upscale lounge. Our boss loves to collect interesting drinks.” She turned to Ivy with a glint in her eye. “Working here, you could earn about $1,000 a month.”

Ivy's ears perked up at the mention of money, especially since she was in dire need of cash. However, her thoughts were racing with worries about whether she could handle this kind of job.

Noticing Ivy’s hesitation, the woman casually handed her a business card. “If you decide to give it a shot, just give me a call.”

On her way home, Ivy mulled over the conversation. Deep down, she didn’t want to take a job like that; it wouldn't help her career in the long run. But with her mom’s medical bills piling up, she felt the pressure. Every day in the hospital brought a new stack of bills that made her head spin.

When Ivy finally arrived at the hospital, her mom, Grace Peterson, greeted her cheerfully. “Evan Garcia just stopped by!”

Ivy couldn’t help but feel a bit annoyed. Evan was her new husband, and while he had been helping out, she didn’t want to owe him anything more. “Oh, did he leave already?” she asked, trying to sound casual.

Grace chuckled, “Nope, he went to pay the bills.”

Ivy sighed. “Mom, please don’t let him cover any more of the costs! It makes it awkward between us. We’re not equals in this relationship!”

Grace blinked in surprise. “Is it really that serious? You just got married! Why draw a line?”

Ivy’s frustration bubbled up, and she smiled tightly. “Do you think this is a normal marriage? If it were...”

She trailed off, not wanting to say too much and upset her mom. Just then, she heard footsteps approaching and turned to find Evan walking in. The mood in the room shifted instantly, and Ivy felt a wave of awkwardness wash over her.

Evan glanced between the two of them, sensing the tension. He awkwardly placed the receipt on the table and stood by, unsure of what to do next. 

Ivy took that moment to stand up and said, “We need to talk.” 

The two of them moved to a stairwell, where Ivy opened a window and fished out a cigarette from her pocket. She took a light puff, feeling the weight of her thoughts pressing down on her. Turning to Evan, she said, “Don’t go paying for my mom’s treatment anymore. This marriage might be something you’re doing on a whim, but I’m getting money out of it too. You don’t owe me anything.”

Evan’s expression shifted from confusion to surprise as he looked at her. He stepped closer, took the cigarette from her fingers, and raised an eyebrow. “Is this really that appealing to you?”

Ivy lunged to snatch it back, but he held it just out of her reach. “Come on, give it back!” she huffed.

With a smirk, Evan tossed the cigarette straight into the trash can, leaving Ivy fuming. 

“Quit smoking,” he said, amusement dancing in his eyes.

Ivy couldn’t help but crack a smile. “And who made you the boss of me?”

Evan’s gaze softened for a moment, and Ivy felt a chill run down her spine. “Quit smoking, and I’ll get you a job in my company.”

Ivy’s eyes widened in shock. That wasn’t the offer she expected. She stared at him, and he held her gaze steadily, stepping even closer. 

After a moment, Ivy broke eye contact and looked down at her shoes, her heart racing. Why was he so intimidating? 

Finally, she murmured, “You must feel pretty proud of yourself, controlling everyone’s lives like this.”
