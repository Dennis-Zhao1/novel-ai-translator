**Early Marriage at a Young Age**

The party upstairs was in full swing, laughter and clinking glasses echoing down the staircase. When Ivy Gonzalez walked in, holding hands with someone, all eyes turned to them. Ivy, sporting a dark grey beret that framed her delicate face, had long hair cascading down her back.

She had heard from Emma Ward that the VIP lounge upstairs was reserved for special customers, and seeing it for herself, she realized just how spacious this little pub was. In this bustling city where every inch is a premium, such a place felt surprisingly luxurious.

“Hey there!” a guy in a leather jacket called out, leaning casually against the railing.

Ivy's friend, Dai Yinyin, glanced at him with a hint of laziness and introduced him, “This is Liam Harris.” Ivy nodded politely, “Hi there!” 

Liam just nodded back, his attention glued to his phone.

Dai Yinyin led Ivy deeper into the lounge, introducing her to friends in a soft voice. Ivy wasn’t one for socializing, so she merely nodded and smiled at each introduction, feeling slightly out of place. After sitting and listening to their chatter for a while, watching them roll dice, Ivy started to feel drowsy. 

From their conversations, she pieced together who was who. Liam Harris, leaning against the railing, was the son of a big-time entertainment company owner, and it seemed like most of the popular stars today were from his family. He had the entertainment world in a chokehold, with stock prices soaring—he was definitely riding high. Across from her was Zhou Shuangwen, who she guessed was also a big deal, possibly the son of a famous director, currently plotting his next film.

“What’s up?” Zhou tossed his arm around Liam’s shoulder. “Got another gig lined up?”

Liam grinned, raising an eyebrow. “What can I say? Being this handsome comes with its perks—everyone wants a piece of me.”

Dai Yinyin took a sip of her drink and leaned closer to Ivy, whispering, “Old He has a ton of friends.” Ivy chuckled, noticing how well Dai Yinyin got along with him.

After a while, Liam finally sat down, pushing aside the hand that had been resting on his shoulder. “Yinyin, your friend is super quiet. Why so reserved?” He took a sip of his drink, his eyes fixated on Ivy.

Ivy, aware he was talking about her, turned to him and forced a smile, feeling a bit awkward.

Dai Yinyin shot Liam a look. “What’s wrong with being quiet? Not everyone can chat non-stop like you.”

Liam just laughed, not caring, and went back to scrolling through his phone, picking through messages from various girls.

Not long after, he stretched and was about to look for something fun to do when he noticed Ivy yawning. He teased her, “Looks like your friend is ready to call it a night.”

Ivy rolled her eyes, feeling annoyed—he was like a little sparrow chirping in her ear that she just couldn’t swat away. 

Dai Yinyin shot Liam a glare and patted Ivy's shoulder, “Let’s go get some fresh air.”

As they stepped downstairs, they ran into Michael Wood, who had just finished performing. 

“Heading home?” Michael asked, pausing to look at them, his gaze lingering on Dai Yinyin.

“Yeah, pretty much,” Ivy replied, tilting her chin up.

They walked a few steps before realizing Dai Yinyin was still standing there, lost in thought.

Ivy led Dai Yinyin through a maze of corridors until they found a rehearsal room. To her surprise, a “For Rent” sign was plastered on the door. Frowning, Ivy grabbed two low stools, and they sat outside the door.

“How’d you find this place? It’s way quieter here,” Dai Yinyin commented, tapping her fingers on the stool, enjoying the refreshing air.

“Michael Wood,” Ivy replied, shoving her hands into her pockets. “I bumped into him earlier. This is his rehearsal spot, and I used to come here a lot.”

Dai Yinyin stared at the ground, repeating Michael Wood's name in her mind before taking a drag from her cigarette.

“What’s on your mind?” Ivy asked, noticing Dai Yinyin seemed lost in thought.

Dai Yinyin looked up and suddenly burst out, “Old He is such a fool! Don’t take anything he says to heart.” Ivy didn’t find her words harsh at all.

Dai Yinyin extinguished her cigarette, her frustration palpable. “His dad doesn’t even treat him like a son! He gave up everything abroad just to come back here and lounge around—what a waste!”

Ivy was puzzled. If what Dai Yinyin said was true, that did sound pretty foolish.

“Have you tried talking to him?” Ivy asked.

Dai Yinyin sighed, brushing her bangs back. “I’ve tried, but he’s as thick-headed as they come. He just wastes his days partying since he got back.”

Ivy chuckled, “Aren’t you doing the same thing right now?”

Dai Yinyin scoffed, “Those so-called friends only want to hang out because of his status. I’d rather just drink with him.”

Ivy couldn’t help but admire how much Dai Yinyin cared for her foolish friend.

Just then, a soft voice called out, “Ivy Gonzalez—”

In the narrow, quiet corridor, a tall figure approached, walking steadily with an air of confidence. Ivy’s heart leaped when she recognized Ethan Clark. 

“What are you doing here?” Ivy exclaimed, jumping up to wrap her arms around him.

“Do you plan to stay out all night? It’s already past two,” Ethan said, playfully squeezing her waist.

“Wow, time flies,” Ivy said, glancing at her phone.

“I should introduce you,” Ivy said, pulling Ethan over to Dai Yinyin. “This is Dai Yinyin.”

“Wait, so he’s the secret star behind the scenes?” Dai Yinyin exclaimed, her excitement palpable. 

“Nice to meet you, Ivy Gonzalez’s husband,” Dai Yinyin chimed cheerfully.

Ivy felt like she’d been struck by lightning. What kind of introduction was that? “His name is Ethan Clark, not just ‘husband’!”

Ethan chuckled and adjusted Ivy’s slightly askew beret, looking down at her with a teasing smile. “She’s not wrong, though.”

Ivy felt a rush of happiness at his words, her lips curling into a sweet smile, as if all her worries had vanished.

At that moment, Liam Harris sauntered out, leaning against the wall, observing the trio with an amused expression. “What’s going on here, a party without me?”

“Just catching up!” Dai Yinyin exclaimed. “Did you know Ivy is married? This is her husband!”

Liam’s eyes widened in surprise for a moment before his usual smirk returned. “Looks like all the beautiful people are getting hitched young these days!”
