**Going Home**

Ivy Gonzalez only knew Noah Scott by name. 

As she stared at the sparse cars ahead, her gaze flicked to Ethan Clark, who was sulking in the passenger seat. Seriously, he looked like someone had stolen his lunch money the moment he got into the car.

She had half a mind to ask him about Noah Scott, but his gloomy mood made her think twice. What kind of guy was Noah Scott anyway? 

Ivy was starting to piece together that Marcus Cook must mean something significant to them, especially if it could drive Ethan to fight in public for her sake. But for some reason, it made her feel a little off, realizing that Ethan could be so passionately reckless.

As the car slowly rolled through the entrance of the neighborhood, Ethan finally broke the silence. “Where are we heading?”

He caught sight of the luggage in the back, and an inexplicable anger surged within him, his eyes practically blazing as he glared at Ivy. 

With a casual tap of her fingers on the steering wheel, Ivy replied coolly, “Home.”

If it weren’t for all the drama, she would have probably been home by now. Glancing at the clock, she realized it was already 10 PM—way too late to head back.

Ethan’s anger flared further at her words. Home? Wasn’t this place her home? Ivy had never seen it that way; she could leave at any moment and never felt the need to share anything with him.

In a burst of frustration, Ethan jumped out of the car, blocking Ivy’s path. “Why didn’t you tell me about Sophia Bennett? Are we even still married?!”

He was trying to keep his temper in check, but it was clear he was losing it, each word laced with tension.

Ivy swung the car door open. “What do you mean, ‘her and Sophia Bennett’? Why do I need to tell you everything?” She was fuming—she had gone through the trouble of picking him up, and here he was, grilling her about things that felt so trivial.

She could count on one hand how many times she’d met with Sophia Bennett. Seriously, Ethan had one heck of an imagination! Ivy didn’t want to drag this ridiculous issue out any longer, so she brushed past him. 

“Why didn’t you tell me he confessed to you?” Ethan insisted, following her and grabbing her wrist to force her to look him in the eye.

Ivy frowned. Was this even worth discussing? There were tons of guys online proclaiming their love for her every day—did she need to report every little thing to him? But then, her anger fizzled out when she caught sight of a faint burn scar on his arm.

She took his scarred arm in her hand, her voice softer now. “Can we just drop this? I turned him down already. It wasn’t worth mentioning, Ethan.”

Instantly, Ethan’s frustration melted away. His temper always seemed to dissolve in the warmth of her words. He looked into her bright eyes and couldn’t help but smile, pulling her into a gentle embrace.

Ivy rested her chin on his shoulder, gazing blankly ahead. The night felt dark and empty, with only the lifeless trees lining the road. She couldn’t tell if her feelings for Ethan were born from gratitude or a longing for his affection, but she often felt small in comparison.

The next morning, Ivy returned to her childhood home. 

As soon as she walked in, her mom, Grace Peterson, started hinting about Ethan not being there. Ivy repeated for what felt like the hundredth time that he was busy with work, promising they’d come by next time. But honestly, she knew he had no reason to be there.

“Is next time going to be for the holidays?” Grace asked, sitting in a wicker chair and munching on sunflower seeds. She was worried that Ethan and Ivy’s relationship might be on shaky ground, especially since Ivy looked thinner than ever.

“I will be back for the holidays, but he might not,” Ivy replied, warming her hands by the stove and glancing up at the clear sky. Suddenly, she remembered that she hadn’t seen the caregiver around and asked, “Where did that caregiver lady go? I haven’t seen her.”

Grace shrugged, casually tossing the seeds. “I let her go. I’d rather save that money. I’m doing alright; I don’t really need her.”

Ivy chuckled, teasing, “Oh, so you can save money now?”

Grace straightened up, defensively insisting, “Who says I can’t? I used to be a scatterbrain, but now I know that saving money is the way to go! I enjoy chatting with the neighbors; it’s nice. Besides, your aunt doesn’t come around much, so it’s peaceful.”

Ivy smiled at her mother, realizing that people do change after facing tough times. Grace had become wiser during their time apart, even learning to save money.

Grace stood up and brought Ivy a plate of persimmon cakes—her childhood favorite. She had rushed to the market to get some, knowing Ivy would be home.

As Ivy bit into a piece, the sweet, sticky taste brought back memories, and she couldn’t help but indulge in seconds.

Grace, back in her chair, continued munching on seeds before suddenly becoming serious. “I’m telling you, with a big family like Ethan’s, they’ll want you to spend the holidays with them. Don’t be stubborn and insist on being here with me; it’ll be fine.”

Ivy, with her mouth still full of sweet persimmons, felt a pang in her heart. Who wouldn’t want to spend the holidays happily with their family? She understood her mother’s concerns about her relationship with Ethan, wanting her daughter to have a smooth life.

Trying to ease Grace’s worries, Ivy smiled and said, “We should split the holidays between both families—fair is fair!”

Grace shook her head disapprovingly, calling Ivy childish.

What Grace didn’t realize was that Ivy had only been to Ethan’s family’s house once, and it had ended in a disaster. Why should she force herself to fit in with a family that didn’t accept her? She didn’t want to put herself through that again.
