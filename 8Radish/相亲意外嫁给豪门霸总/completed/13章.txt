**Bought That House**

Ivy Gonzalez stopped in her tracks, glancing back over her shoulder at Ethan Clark. He looked great in his white short-sleeved shirt, his tousled hair falling just above his eyebrows. Those bright, clear eyes sparkled with a hint of mischief as he stared at her, making her heart skip a beat.

After a few seconds, she chuckled softly, “Do you still need me to handle this?”

Ethan was momentarily speechless. Truth be told, he didn’t really need her help. He found himself wanting to visit her every day, even though they were technically a married couple on paper. But Ivy was a puzzle—someone who felt both familiar and entirely new to him.

Once back in the car, Ethan leaned back, closed his eyes, and let his mind wander to Ivy and her brother, Noah Scott. They looked so much alike, yet their personalities couldn’t have been more different.

He let out a deep sigh and turned to Jason Brooks, who was driving. “Head back to the office.”

Meanwhile, James Miller stood at the base of the office building, looking sharp and serious as he waited for his boss to return. Just moments ago, Ethan’s mother, Mrs. Xu, had strutted in carrying her designer handbag, her high heels clicking on the floor as she made her way to Ethan's office.

The moment she spotted Ethan’s car pulling up, she hurried over, casually remarking, “I’m in the office now, and I’m guessing it's about your blind date again.”

Ethan strode toward the elevator, his long legs taking him swiftly forward. He shot back, "She just loves to meddle."

Ever since his ex-girlfriend had passed away, Mrs. Xu had watched her son drown himself in work, neglecting his health and well-being. He hardly ever came home, never answered his phone, and when he wasn’t working late, he was drowning in alcohol just to sleep. To get him to move on, she thought pushing him into dating again would help.

Ethan, however, was stubborn. No matter how much Mrs. Xu insisted, he refused to go on any blind dates. And now she was here at his office, again.

As they reached his office door, James reminded him, “You've got a meeting at eleven.”

He pushed open the door, revealing a spacious office with a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows that offered a stunning view of the city.

Mrs. Xu was seated on the couch, savoring a steaming cup of coffee. She looked up as the door swung open and beamed at Ethan, noting how he seemed a bit thinner but also more alive than before.

“Hey, you’re looking good!” she said, her smile warm. She then caught sight of James standing nearby and ordered, “Oh, and can you grab me some sugar? This coffee is way too bitter.”

James, bending slightly, was about to say he would, but Ethan cut him off, “You can go back to work now.”

James nodded and slipped out, closing the door softly behind him.

Ethan walked over to his desk, pulled out a small packet of sugar, and handed it to his mother. Once James was out of earshot, he added, “Stop making him do these little things. He’s not your assistant; he has enough on his plate.”

Mrs. Xu pouted slightly, “It was just a bit of sugar!”

She knew Ethan cared for his employees, especially since James had stuck by him during those grueling nights at work. As a mother, she didn’t want to criticize, but she had bigger plans for her son today. Pulling out her phone, she swiped to a photo and exclaimed, “Look at this girl! She’s the daughter of the Yang Group’s president—so beautiful! You’ve got to see her!”

Ethan barely lifted his gaze from his computer screen, his tone slow as he replied, “Mom, I’m already married.”

“What?!” Mrs. Xu gasped, dropping her phone in shock as she rushed over to his desk. “When did this happen? Whose daughter is she? What does her family do?”

Noticing Ethan’s silence, her mind raced. She was both angry and worried, clutching her chest as she scolded, “You should’ve talked to me first! This is too hasty!”

Ethan knew he had always been a headstrong kid. If he set his mind on something, he’d do it. She frowned, wondering where he got that stubbornness from, as no one had ever been able to keep him in check.

“I thought you wanted me to get married,” Ethan said gently, wanting to soothe her. “Now that I am, you should be happy. I’ll bring her by to meet you soon.”

He returned to his keyboard, casting a glance at his mother, who still looked troubled.

Finally, he sighed, stepping away from his desk to stand beside her. “Mom, trust me on this!”

Mrs. Xu had always doted on her son, wanting his happiness above all. She believed in his ability to choose well, so she reluctantly nodded, hoping for the best.

After seeing off his mother, Ethan finally had a chance to escape to his meeting.

Inside the conference room, the long oval table was packed with people in formal suits, the atmosphere tense as they prepared for the inevitable critique from their boss. After the last meeting, when Ethan had ripped into them, everyone was on edge.

As he walked in, every eye turned toward him, their expressions a mix of fear and respect.

“Let’s start with the marketing department,” Ethan said, drumming his fingers on the table as he looked at the manager, Mr. Chen.

Mr. Chen stood up, visibly nervous, and approached the projector screen, his voice shaky as he began his presentation, all the while stealing glances at Ethan, hoping to make it through unscathed.

Just then, Ethan’s phone buzzed. He noticed it was a message from Jason Brooks, but he ignored it until he caught sight of the name “Miss Lin.” Curiosity piqued, he opened the message.

“Miss Lin is planning to sell her house; her mother owes $120,000.”

Furrowing his brow, Ethan stared at the screen for a few moments before typing back with quick fingers, **“Contact Lawyer Li about buying that house.”**
