### Not Worthy of Pity

The sky was a gloomy gray as Ivy Gonzalez pulled up to the hospital, the distant glow of lights flickering like a beacon of hope in the dreary atmosphere. She stepped into the elevator, feeling the weight of her decision as she ascended to the seventh floor. Her heart raced a bit as she strolled down the long corridor toward Ethan Clark’s room.

Didn’t she say she didn’t want to see him again? Yet here she was, ambushed by her own thoughts. Ivy sighed, hesitating at the door. But before she could talk herself out of it, her hand was already on the doorknob, pushing it open. Inside, she found the room dimly lit by a lone orange lamp, thick curtains blocking out any hint of cheerfulness. The vibe was heavy and cold—just how she felt about her situation.

As Ivy tiptoed inside, her gaze fell on Ethan, who lay on the bed looking frailer than ever. Next to him, a bouquet of vibrant flowers stood out in stark contrast to the dreary room. The sight tugged at her heartstrings. He really was sick.

She plopped down on the edge of the bed, her heart swelling with an emotion she couldn’t quite name. She shouldn’t feel sorry for him! After all, he was the one who had wronged her. Lucas Smith had the audacity to say that Ethan’s condition was somehow her fault. Ridiculous!

Ivy’s mind wandered back to the countless times she’d counted Ethan’s lashes while he slept, teasing him about how many he had. But now, seeing him like this made her want to look away, afraid that she might soften. Ethan had always had a thing for her face, and feeling sorry for him was just self-sabotage.

With a determined shake of her head, she rose to pour herself a glass of ice-cold water, needing the chill to snap her back to reality. Ivy flung open half the curtains, letting in a flood of light, and settled down to tackle the mountain of messages from business partners on her phone. It was exhausting; there was no time to respond to each one individually, so she had to pick and choose.

Suddenly, a hand snaked around her waist. Ivy glanced down to see long, clean fingers resting on her, sending a shiver up her spine. She shut off her phone and shot back, “You know who you're hugging, right? Get a grip; I’m not Noah Scott from your dreams.”

Ethan, looking like he was fighting a battle just to stay upright, pulled her closer. “Guess you’re back,” he murmured, his voice a rough whisper.

Ivy tried to pull away, but in her struggle, she accidentally poked the needle in his hand. Blood seeped out, and Ethan winced, shooting her a look that was equal parts pain and pity. Just then, she felt a flicker of concern, but it quickly vanished. Why should she care? There were plenty of people who were worried about him.

Ivy crossed her arms, watching him struggle to sit up, propped by pillows as he heaved himself upward. It was a slow and painful process, and the silence between them felt suffocating.

Ethan’s eyes bored into her, drawing her in with a mix of vulnerability and defiance. Gone was the confident guy she used to know; now he looked like someone who could be easily hurt—like she could stab him with a metaphorical knife and he wouldn’t even flinch.

“I can’t believe you came,” he rasped, his voice barely above a whisper.

Ivy took a deep breath, regaining her composure. “Lucas said you were sick,” she replied, making it clear that someone had sent her here, not her own volition.

Ethan pursed his lips, the stubbornness radiating off him. “I’m not sick.”

Yeah, right. Ivy’s patience snapped. “Not sleeping or eating well is still being sick! You’re an adult; take care of yourself! Do you really want the people who care about you to worry?”

At that, a small smile cracked Ethan’s face. It was a weak one, but it reminded her of the guy who used to joke around and tease her. “Does that include you?”

Ivy rolled her eyes. “You know I’m not here to coddle you. Think about your parents and Lucas. They care about you.”

Just then, the door swung open, and Ethan’s mother entered, carrying a pot of homemade soup. She paused, overhearing them, and Ivy felt a twinge of awkwardness as she greeted her politely, just like she would with any elder.

“Oh, you’re here!” his mother said, her tone surprisingly warm. She had always appreciated Ivy’s concern for her son.

Ivy awkwardly shifted in her seat, unsure of how to address Ethan’s mom. “I have to run; take care of yourself!” she said quickly, grabbing her bag and making a beeline for the exit.

Ethan’s mother observed the two of them, sensing the tension. “Did you two have a fight?” she asked, concerned as she handed Ethan the soup.

He muttered a soft “yeah,” but a flicker of hope danced in his eyes. Just knowing Ivy was here meant he might still have a chance.

“Don’t overthink it; just focus on getting better,” his mother said, serving him another bowl of soup. She sighed, continuing, “Your dad said he’d only be away for a few days, but now he’s extending his trip. Honestly, he might as well stay abroad for the holidays.”

Ivy, feeling a surge of discomfort, made her way down to the hospital lobby, where she bumped into Liam Harris, who was limping along with a cane.

“Didn’t expect to see you here!” he grinned, flashing a bright smile despite his condition.

Ivy frowned at the sight of his leg encased in a heavy cast. “What happened?”

“Just a little motorcycle accident. Nothing serious!” he shrugged, seemingly unfazed.

Seriously? Ivy couldn't tell if he was crazy or just incredibly optimistic.

“I’ll wait here,” she said, motioning for him to sit.

After a while, she pushed a wheelchair over. “Get in.”

“No way! I’m not riding that thing! I’ll look like an old man!” Liam protested.

Ivy rolled her eyes and snatched the cane from his hand, forcing him into the chair. “You think motorcycles are cool? You’re just asking for trouble.”

“Ah, but it’s all about speed and thrills!” Liam beamed, totally missing the point.

“Yeah, well, enjoy your thrill while you can!” Ivy remarked dryly.

When they reached the examination room, the doctor called them in, and Ivy helped Liam settle into the chair. He was skinny, but he still felt heavy to her. “Next time, hire someone else to drag you here,” she teased.

“Why not hire you?” Liam shot back, grinning.

“I'm pretty expensive,” she quipped, not wanting to take on that kind of responsibility.

“Doesn’t matter; I can afford it,” he replied, still not grasping the reality of her sarcasm.

After calling a cab for him and helping him get in, Liam continued to chatter excitedly. “I’ll take you out to eat as a thank-you!”

Ivy waved him off, grimacing at the thought. “Eating out with you is too embarrassing. Just focus on healing that leg.”

Liam laughed, shaking his head. “You can’t run away from me that easily!”

With that chaotic encounter behind her, Ivy finally headed home, her heart heavy with thoughts of Ethan, Liam, and the tangled web of relationships surrounding her. Life had a funny way of throwing unexpected challenges her way, but somehow, she had to find a way to navigate through it all.
