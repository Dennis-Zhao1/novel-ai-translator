**Roommates in a Cozy Chaos**

Upstairs, there were two rooms. One was a cluttered mess, filled with boxes and random stuff that had been shoved in after a hasty move. The other was Ivy Gonzalez's bedroom, her sanctuary. 

Grace Peterson, the practical one, decided to keep things simple and just lived downstairs. Ivy's room faced east, where a towering tree stood five meters tall. The wind rustled the leaves, creating an eerie sound that sometimes sent shivers down Grace's spine. "We should chop that thing down," she'd suggested, half-joking, but Ivy just shook her head. "That tree is a rare gem!" 

Meanwhile, Ethan Clark, fresh out of the shower and dripping wet, found himself in Ivy's room for the first time. He stood there awkwardly, not daring to sit on the bed, unsure of what to do with himself. The curtains billowed in the wind, and he shuffled over to pull them shut, peering out at the dark nothingness. It was a stark contrast to the city, where the lights never really dimmed.

Then, he heard footsteps coming up the stairs. His heart raced as Ivy appeared, slowly lugging a comforter up with her. She sniffed it, relieved it still smelled like sunshine from the day before when she had aired it out with her mom. Standing at her bedroom door, she hesitated, gnawing on her lip, then turned and rushed back downstairs. 

"Where's the wine?" she muttered to herself, finding nothing but water in the fridge. She chugged a big glass of hot water instead, a poor substitute for liquid courage, before heading back upstairs. This time, she moved faster, but with both hands full, she kicked the door lightly.

Ethan, hearing the commotion, dashed to open the door. He took the comforter from her, but Ivy kept her gaze down, nervous. She quietly locked the door, glancing over her shoulder as if Grace might burst in at any moment to catch them sleeping apart.

Leaning against the door, Ivy hesitated before saying, “You take the bed; I'll sleep on the floor.” 

Ethan raised an eyebrow, smirking. “Aren’t you cold?” 

“Not at all!” Ivy insisted, already rummaging through her closet to pull out an electric blanket that had seen better days. She spread it out on the floor like she was setting up camp, layering it with a sheet. Ethan could only watch, unsure of what to say.

The night in their little town was quiet—too quiet. The kind of quiet that made you feel like the world had shut down. Ivy lay on the floor, tossing and turning, too cold to sleep, the blanket offering little warmth. 

Ethan could hear her shivering and decided to tease her a bit. “You sure you’re not cold? I can hear your teeth chattering from here.” 

“Pshh, I’m just... uh... grinding my teeth!” she stammered, trying to sound cool about it. 

Before she could react, Ethan reached down, scooped her up, and plopped her right on the bed next to him. Ivy blinked up at him, wide-eyed and frozen in surprise.

“See? Much warmer up here, right?” he teased, propping himself on one elbow.

She pouted and pushed his hand away, but then she had an idea. In a flash, she reached out and grabbed his neck, her icy fingers making him jump. 

“Yikes!” he exclaimed, quickly pulling away. “You’re like a walking ice cube!” 

Ivy couldn’t help but laugh quietly, delighted by her little victory. “That’s what you get for mocking me!”

Now nestled comfortably against the mattress, she reveled in the warmth, thankful to be off the cold floor. 

Ethan, meanwhile, couldn’t help but stare at her. He leaned closer, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear, his gaze intense. “You really don’t know how beautiful you are, do you?” 

Ivy’s heart raced, and she felt heat creeping up her cheeks. She was utterly lost in his dark, deep eyes, feeling like they were pulling her in. 

“Uh, what’s happening?” she thought, completely unprepared for this moment. Her hands instinctively found their way to his neck, unsure whether she wanted to pull away or lean in closer.

Ethan noticed her hesitation, a small smile playing at his lips. He tilted her chin up, sealing the moment with a soft kiss, then another—on her cheek, her nose, her forehead. 

“Why do you always look at me like that?” Ivy whispered, her heart pounding.

He didn't answer right away, their foreheads touching, the air between them electric. He wanted to say so much, but words failed him in the moment. 

Ethan had been through enough in his twenty-seven years to know that happiness often came at the price of selfishness. He didn’t want to let her go. Not now, not ever.

And in that dark room, with their breaths mingling, they both knew they were on the edge of something beautiful and terrifying.
