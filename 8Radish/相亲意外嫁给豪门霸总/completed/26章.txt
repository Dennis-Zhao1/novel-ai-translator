**Supermarket Run or Nah?**

Ethan Clark had finally clocked out at the crack of dawn after a marathon of international video calls that left his face wearing the fatigue like a badge of honor. He shrugged off his suit jacket, draping it over one arm, while his other hand rubbed his temples, waiting for the elevator like it was the slowest thing on the planet.

It was rush hour, and the elevator was dragging its feet. His colleague, James Miller, stood beside him and asked, “You want to grab breakfast before heading back?”

Ethan, eyes still closed in refusal, shook his head. He was eager to get home, hoping he could still catch Ivy Gonzalez for lunch.

Ding! The elevator doors opened, and the people inside scrambled out, giving Ethan the respect he didn’t know he needed. Two girls in the corner were too engrossed in their phones, giggling about the latest trending TikTok.

As Ethan stepped inside, he caught a glimpse of Ivy’s face on their screens. She was the one who usually sang for him—her beautiful voice echoing in his mind. His brow furrowed and his mood soured as he entered the elevator.

When he got home, he didn’t even bother to change out of his work clothes. He dashed up the stairs, his footsteps echoing as he rushed to Ivy's room. He knocked three times, waited a beat, and knocked again.

Then he tried calling her. Busy signal. A second call, then a third, and the last one got cut off. He tugged at his tie in frustration, leaning over the glass railing to survey the living room below. Ivy never proactively shared updates; he always had to hear it through someone else.

Half an hour later, he saw a slender figure appear in the hallway. He rushed downstairs, eyes glued to Ivy. She strolled in, her hair casually pulled back, wearing a relaxed blazer that highlighted her delicate features, her lips painted a soft coral that made her look even more enchanting.

“Where’d you run off to this morning?” he asked, striding toward her, eyebrows knitted together as if he were interrogating her.

Ivy blinked, lifting her tired gaze to meet his. “I signed with a company.”

She had an appointment with Sophia Bennett at nine to go over a contract, and with Sophia's meticulous nature, she had laid everything out for Ivy. When Ivy saw Ethan's call, she was too busy signing to pick up. Now, looking at Ethan’s expression, she felt lucky she hadn’t mentioned it earlier; otherwise, he would’ve tried to talk her out of it.

“Why didn’t you tell me? What if you got scammed?” Ethan grasped her shoulders, urgency in his voice.

Ivy chuckled lightly. “What good would it have done? You never really trust me anyway, and I was with Sophia—she wouldn’t let me get scammed.”

Ethan dropped his hands, his lips pressed into a thin line as he tried to contain his simmering anger. He turned his gaze away from her, his tone cold. “I’m such a fool, following you around like a lost puppy every day.”

Hearing Sophia’s name come from Ivy’s lips made his stomach churn. That was the woman who had stolen Noah Scott from him and was now worming her way into Ivy’s life. Just thinking about it made him sick.

Ivy was taken aback, unsure how to respond. She watched as Ethan turned away, retreating to his room and slamming the door shut. 

Great. Now she had messed things up. She regretted saying anything, realizing how unpredictable Ethan’s moods could be. It seemed anything could set him off.

Having not cooked in ages, Ivy decided to whip up some noodles. She left a bowl on the table and knocked on Ethan’s door, letting him know dinner was ready, but received no response.

Sighing, she gave up, knowing she had to go to work soon. That night, she was scheduled to sing at a local pub and stream live. Sophia had mentioned that with a popular stream, one could rake in several thousand dollars in just one night. The thought made Ivy giddy. Maybe she could finally pay Ethan back.

Ivy sang her heart out, the chat filled with fans showering her with compliments. “Wife! You’re stunning!” “So pretty and she sings beautifully!” “She’s gorgeous!” 

By the time her stream ended, her throat was dry, but she felt accomplished. It was much easier than her usual grind, and the money was definitely sweeter.

Once the stream ended, she moved on to filming short TikToks. Her company had a full professional crew set up, handling everything from hair and makeup to wardrobe and content creation. They had to keep up with her rising fame, or she’d just get lost in the digital shuffle.

After a long night of filming, it was well past midnight. Ivy quietly opened the door, expecting Ethan’s anger to have simmered down. After all, she hadn’t said anything wrong. He could be a bit controlling, always trying to make her decisions for her.

Stepping into the dark living room, she found the lights off and her bowl of noodles untouched. He hadn’t even taken a bite! 

She approached his door and knocked lightly. Still no response. She pressed against the door, attempting to push it open, only to find it locked. 

“Can you be less childish? Just come out and eat something,” she sighed, speaking softly to the closed door. It was funny to her that a grown man needed to be coaxed this way.

She pressed her ear against the door, listening for any sign of life. Nothing. Feeling defeated, Ivy plopped down on the floor outside his door. “I messed up, okay? I shouldn’t have said that. Can we just talk?”

“Otherwise, I’ll have to call someone!” she declared, raising her voice a bit. Time to switch tactics.

Inside, Ethan lay on his bed, propped up on his arm, listening to every word she said. He knew the moment she entered, when she flicked the light on—he was tuned in to every little thing.

He remained silent, a smirk creeping onto his face. Let her stew a little longer.

Suddenly, a loud scream pierced the silence, and Ethan leaped up, panic surging through him as he rushed out of his room.

“What’s wrong?!” he asked, brow furrowed with concern.

Ivy looked up at him, a satisfied grin plastered on her face. “Finally out, huh?”

Ethan let out a breath he didn't know he was holding but quickly shifted to irritation. “Seriously? You had to pull that stunt?”

He tried to turn away, but as he did, Ivy tugged at his pant leg, nearly yanking them down. “Let go! Who does that?” He gripped the doorframe, pretending to retreat back to his room. Ivy’s grip was no match for him.

Trying not to laugh, he fought to maintain his stern demeanor.

“I’m starving! Are you going to the supermarket with me or what?” Ivy’s eyes sparkled playfully, and in that moment, Ethan felt his resolve melting. How could he keep up his cold front when she looked that cute?
