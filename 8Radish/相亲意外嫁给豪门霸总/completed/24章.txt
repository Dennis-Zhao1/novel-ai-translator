**Unexpected Fame Online**

On her way back home, Ivy Gonzalez felt like a deflated balloon. The past couple of days had been a whirlwind of running around, picking out new furniture, and scrubbing her apartment from top to bottom. She plopped down in the passenger seat, utterly spent; if only she had enough money to support herself and her mom in this city, maybe she wouldn’t have to go through all this hassle.

She stared blankly out the window, watching the streetlights zip by like a blur of yellow stars. After a moment of hesitation, she glanced at the driver beside her and decided to ask, “Did you call the cops?”

It had struck her as odd when the police suddenly showed up. She remembered Ethan Clark’s disapproving look from earlier and figured he must have been the one to call them.

Ethan, looking calm as ever, replied softly, “I thought it would be better this way.”

Ivy simply hummed in response, not feeling up to a conversation. She leaned back against the seat, half-closing her eyes to catch a moment of rest. He’d never really trusted her anyway, had he?

In her drowsy state, she became vaguely aware of Ethan answering a phone call. The voice on the other end was distinctly feminine and sweet, causing a pang of envy in Ivy's chest. Little did she know that this person would soon become a thorn in her side.

She caught snippets of Ethan’s replies—“Yeah,” “Okay”—before he hung up. 

When she finally collapsed onto her bed, sleep didn’t come easy; she was haunted by nightmares. First, she dreamed of Ethan happily holding hands with a girl she’d never seen before, and then she found herself desperately begging him to let her go.

It wasn’t until dawn that she fell into a deep sleep, only to be jolted awake a few hours later by her work group blowing up her phone with notifications.

Still groggy, Ivy squinted at her phone, which had over 999 unread messages. “Do these people even sleep?” she grumbled to herself. “Why are they up chatting so early?”

Scrolling through the messages, she stumbled upon a video that made her sit up straight in shock. It was her, on stage in a dark green dress, singing her heart out. Apparently, someone had posted it online, and it had gone viral overnight, racking up millions of likes. The comments were overwhelmingly positive.

“Next life, I want to look like that!”

“How can someone be both icy and stunning?”

“Her figure is to die for! And her face—wow!”

“Come on, it’s just makeup and filters. Anyone can do that.”

Ivy couldn’t believe it. She must still be dreaming, right? She decided to splash some water on her face to wake up fully.

Just as she was about to head to the bathroom, Ethan emerged, his hair still damp from a shower. Reflexively, she shielded her eyes until she confirmed he was dressed. 

“Is the downstairs bathroom broken?” she asked.

He nodded, then quickly changed the subject. “You’re up early.”

Ivy sighed; she didn’t want to be up this early. As she walked past him to wash up, she tried to shake off the thought that her sudden internet fame was just a passing trend, something that would fade away in a few days.

Ethan followed her, gently placing a hand on her shoulder. He pulled out a necklace he’d brought back from Germany and carefully draped it around her neck, tucking a few loose strands of her hair behind her ear.

“You never wear the ring I got you, but this necklace is non-negotiable. You can’t take it off.”

Ivy opened her mouth to explain that the ring was too fancy for her, but before she could, he was already heading out the door to work.

She stood there, staring at her reflection, the shimmering necklace catching the light. It was probably worth several months of her salary, and that thought made her feel a bit uneasy.

Outside, a light drizzle fell, making the autumn air feel even chillier. Ethan stepped out, greeted by Jason Brooks holding an umbrella, who quickly opened the back door for him.

Once seated, Ethan pulled a ring from his pocket. It was the matching piece to Ivy's necklace, and he had kept it as a "secret commitment" between them, convinced it would bind them together forever.

At work, he was met with a mountain of tasks, even after putting in extra hours to get some of it done. As he buried himself in paperwork, a familiar coffee aroma wafted through the air.

“Thanks, James Miller,” he mumbled, not looking up.

Then came a peppy giggle. “It’s me, Ethan!”

He looked up to see Lucas Smith, decked out in a chic Chanel outfit and holding a coffee cup, beaming at him. 

“Lucas? What are you doing here?” he asked, eyeing her name tag. “And why are you wearing that?”

Lucas playfully waved her ID badge in front of him, grinning. “Look, I’m part of the team now!”

Ethan’s expression hardened. “Just do your job,” he said, waving her off before calling for James again.

“Is HR even doing their job? Did they really hire a walking distraction?” he grumbled, his voice echoing through the office. Thankfully, the soundproofing worked wonders, or Lucas would’ve heard every word.

James, shaken by the sudden outburst, stammered, “Should I—do we need to let her go?”

Ethan shot him a sharp look. “No. We don’t need to make things worse. Just keep her out of my office.”

Lucas had a knack for causing trouble, and Ethan knew from experience that firing her would only escalate her antics. After all, he’d seen her throw a fit when he was about to marry Noah Scott and she’d run off to tie the knot with a foreigner just to spite him. Now that Noah was out of the picture, she was back, eager not to miss her chance.

Ethan pulled out his phone, sending a few texts to Ivy, but received no response. Frustrated, he turned to James, “Make sure she doesn’t just waltz in here whenever she feels like it.”
