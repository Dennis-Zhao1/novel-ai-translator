### A Twist of Fate

Ivy Gonzalez had just hung up the phone with her lawyer, Mr. Lee. The news was a mixed bag; she had been ordered to pay $50,000 in damages. But honestly? That was manageable. She couldn't help but feel a little grateful for her habit of saving money. At least now, she could finally reclaim what was hers.

With a sense of urgency, Ivy fired off a message to her friend Olivia Price. “Hey! I’m going live tomorrow to help sell some local produce. Can you count up what we have?” It was time to roll up her sleeves and get to work.

After sending the message, Ivy glanced at her phone. The unread notifications were through the roof—999+ messages! She skimmed through the junk until she landed on Ethan Clark’s chat. His messages were an endless stream of apologies, peppered with requests to meet up. 

Ugh, really? Just as she was debating whether or not to entertain the idea, a picture from Emma Ward popped up. Ivy couldn’t help but chuckle. Ethan, the guy who rushed to marry her, was now busy seeking out other women? Classic.

She tossed her phone onto the bed, irritation bubbling inside her. Meet up? No way.

Just then, her phone buzzed again. Standing a safe distance from the bed, she craned her neck to check the caller ID. Of course, it was Mr. Lee, not Ethan. 

Curious, she answered. Mr. Lee wanted to know when they could meet to discuss the court documents. 

The next thing she knew, Ivy was sitting in a café where the lively music of "Croatian Rhapsody" filled the air. Even non-coffee lovers could be tempted to take a sip. She glanced at her phone and out the window, wondering where Mr. Lee was.

Suddenly, the door swung open, and in walked Ethan, shaking off his umbrella. He scanned the room and spotted Ivy, who was wearing a bright red beanie. She looked different—her hair a bit longer, her face more drawn, perhaps from all the stress.

Without a word, Ethan slid into the seat across from her. Ivy’s brow furrowed. She instinctively pulled her chair back, like he was a bear she needed to defend herself against.

“What are you doing here?” Ivy shot back, her expression as icy as a winter morning.

Ethan glanced at the coffee on the table before ordering the same for himself. As he did, Ivy couldn’t help but notice how he looked even better than before—his features sharper, his hair styled. He lounged back in his chair, legs stretched out, as if to say, “I’m thriving; how about you?”

Ivy turned her gaze away, unwilling to let him see her reaction. “What do you want?”

“I'm sorry,” he murmured, his voice barely above a whisper.

“Does that even matter?” Ivy shot up from her seat, ready to bolt.

Ethan grabbed her arm, desperation etched on his face. “Please, just let me explain.”

Ivy sighed and sat back down, defeated. Ethan, with that charming smile of his, thought he could win her back. He knew her well enough to know she was soft-hearted. 

“Let’s talk?” he ventured, his tone hopeful.

Ivy couldn’t help but scoff. “Oh, is this about your love story with Noah Scott?” she shot back, her body trembling with suppressed anger.

Ethan’s smile faded, and he quietly observed her. Noah Scott was a sore subject, one that he couldn't escape.

“Ivy, you should be grateful you look a bit like her,” he said without thinking, immediately regretting it. He hadn’t meant to start a fight; he just couldn’t help himself.

Ivy let out a bitter laugh. She had spent so much time thinking of reasons why he had married her, even falling for the cliché of love at first sight. But now, knowing she was just a substitute for his ‘ideal,’ she felt oddly liberated. 

Pulling out a cigarette, she took a drag and said, “You know, I should thank her for saving my mom’s life. Is that what you wanted to hear?” 

Ethan’s heart sank, the weight of her words pressing down on him. He didn’t recognize this version of Ivy. She was cool, calm, and collected—nothing like the emotional wreck he had last seen.

“Ivy, don’t you think you’re being ridiculous?” he tried, but she wasn’t having it.

“Seriously, Ethan? You’re in bed with a girl who looks like Noah Scott, pretending to be all lovey-dovey. Who are you fooling?” Ivy met his gaze head-on, the fury in her eyes unmistakable. “Save that love for her. I’m done being your emotional crutch.”

Ethan felt the world tilt beneath him as her words hit hard. “Divorce?” he barely managed to say, stunned. He had never considered that option.

Ivy stood tall, casting a shadow over him. “Mr. Lee knows how to handle divorce cases. Let’s leave it to him.”

Ethan looked up at her, the word “divorce” ringing painfully in his ears. He had never wanted this, never thought they'd end up here. 

As she walked out, he remained in the café from dawn until dusk, lost in thought. 

“Sir,” a waitress interrupted gently, “we’re closing soon. Hope to see you tomorrow.”

With a dazed expression, Ethan stumbled out into the night, the world around him spinning. He squinted at the streetlights, feeling unsteady on his feet. 

And then, with a loud thud, he collapsed onto the pavement, darkness swallowing him whole.
