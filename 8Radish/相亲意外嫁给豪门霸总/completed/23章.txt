### Getting Back the House

Ethan Clark leaned in, one hand cradling Ivy Gonzalez's chin while the other supported the back of her head. With a passionate urgency, he pulled her closer and kissed her deeply, as if he had been waiting for this moment forever. No matter how much she squirmed or tried to push him away, he held on tight, utterly captivated by her soft lips.

Ivy, forced to tip her head back to meet his gaze, felt her frown slowly melt away as she tasted the sweet remnants of red wine on his breath. Time seemed to stand still until Ethan finally pulled back, burying his face into the fragrant curve of her shoulder, breathing heavily.

Ivy blinked, slightly bewildered. His soft hair tickled her neck, and she pondered whether she should hug him back or just let the moment linger. Eventually, she opted for a gentle pat on his back, wanting to say “You did great,” but the words got stuck in her throat.

“I'm sorry,” Ethan murmured in a husky voice that sent shivers down her spine. He was more sober than he’d ever been; a little wine wasn’t going to make him lose his cool. He knew Ivy wasn’t just another name on his list—he was determined to keep her close.

The next morning, Ivy woke up early, her mind racing. She hadn’t slept a wink, Ethan’s face replaying in her thoughts. She tossed and turned, waking her friend Grace Peterson multiple times, who grumbled about Ivy’s midnight madness.

After changing into something more comfortable, Ivy headed out to meet Olivia Price at the corner store nearby. But as she opened the door, she almost bumped right into Ethan again.

Dressed in a black sweater and pants, he leaned against the wall, sporting dark circles under his eyes. When he spotted Ivy, he straightened up, his gaze intently fixed on her.

Ivy’s eyes sparkled, a grin spreading across her face. “Wow, those are some serious raccoon eyes! What happened to your face?”

Ethan chuckled, shaking his head in mock defeat, then took her hand and led her down the street, trying to avoid drawing any attention with his flashy car.

When they arrived at their destination, Olivia rushed over, excitement written all over her face. “Your aunt just left! You have to hurry!”

Ivy felt a rush of adrenaline. She needed to change the locks on her own house and fast. They hurried to her home, where Olivia’s dad was already waiting with tools in hand. He jumped right in, changing the lock like a pro.

Ivy stood nearby, her heart racing. Why was she so nervous about reclaiming her own house? 

Ethan noticed her tension and attempted to lighten the mood, but she jumped at his touch, spinning around to face him.

“You scared me!” Ivy exclaimed, half-mockingly.

Ethan chuckled at her guilty look and squeezed her hand reassuringly. 

Moments later, Olivia’s dad triumphantly announced, “All done! I’ve never switched out a lock so fast. Pretty impressive, right?”

Ivy beamed, giving him a thumbs-up, but the celebration was cut short by a loud voice from a distance.

“Hey! What do you think you’re doing?!”

Ivy recognized the shrill voice immediately; it belonged to her aunt, Luna Gonzalez. She turned to see her aunt, along with her uncle Oliver Wright, approaching with a bunch of their family members.

“Isn't it your family that’s the one with no shame?” Ivy shot back, her spirit rising.

Olivia nodded in solidarity and pulled out a megaphone from her bag. With the push of a button, a loud voice boomed, “Luna Gonzalez and her family are greedy! They’re squatting in their niece’s house!”

Ethan raised an eyebrow, caught off guard by the turn of events. The crowd began to gather, eyes wide and curious, while Ivy’s aunt turned beet red, her pride hurt in front of everyone.

“Shut that off right now!” Luna spluttered, her voice shaky.

Just then, two police officers pushed through the crowd, their presence commanding immediate silence. 

“What’s going on here?” one officer asked, eyeing the group.

Olivia quickly turned off the megaphone, but it was too late—Luna was already trying to play the victim.

“They’re trying to steal my house! They’re breaking in!” she exclaimed, pointing at Ivy and her friends.

The officer raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. “Everyone in the village knows this house was left to her by her father. You can’t just take what isn’t yours.”

Deflated, Luna mumbled, “Fine,” as the weight of the situation sank in. 

Ivy couldn’t believe how easily things had turned around. Within moments, her aunt and uncle were hastily packing up their belongings, leaving behind a dent in the wall out of spite. But Ivy was too exhausted to care; she just wanted her space back.

With her heart finally at ease, she turned to Ethan, who gave her a proud smile. “Guess you got your house back, huh?”

“Yeah, and I have a feeling it’s going to be a lot more fun with you around,” Ivy replied, returning his grin as they walked into their new adventure together.
