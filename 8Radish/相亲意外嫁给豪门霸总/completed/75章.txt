**People Do Change**

Mrs. Xu was on a roll, lecturing Ivy Gonzalez at the dining table like it was a TED Talk on life choices. Ivy, however, was more interested in the tea in front of her, watching the leaves swirl around like they were doing a little dance.

"What's so funny?" Mrs. Xu finally paused her philosophical rambling, clearly annoyed that Ivy was not taking her seriously.

Ivy picked up a peanut with her chopsticks, casually munching away. “Well, I know you don’t think much of me, and let’s be honest, Ethan Clark is only marrying me because I look like Noah Scott, which I’m sure you’ve already figured out.”

Mrs. Xu was taken aback, eyes wide in disbelief. She wasn't expecting Ivy to be so blunt, so unapologetically honest.

Ivy set down her chopsticks and locked eyes with Mrs. Xu. “The choice to marry was never mine to make. So don’t act all high and mighty, criticizing me for trying to climb the Xu family tree. Look, I pay my bills by live streaming, not by leeching off your family. Sure, it’s not much, but I’m content with it. If you’re unhappy with me, maybe you should convince your son to file for divorce sooner rather than later.”

With that, Ivy wiped her mouth and turned to leave, just as Ethan rushed in from outside.

“Wow, you made it back fast!” Ivy grinned at him.

Ethan placed a hand on her shoulder, “Next time, let me know you’re coming over. I’ll join you.”

Ivy brushed his hand off, nodding toward the dining room. “Perfect timing! Let’s go keep your mom company.”

Without waiting for a response, she slipped past him and walked out.

Ethan glanced at Ivy’s departing figure before walking into the dining room where Mrs. Xu was now eating in silence.

“Are you two getting a divorce?” Mrs. Xu asked out of the blue, her tone sharp.

Ethan sat down, his expression unreadable. “That’s between Ivy and me.”

“Come on, I’m your mother! Of course, I’m going to worry about your marriage,” she exclaimed, visibly agitated as she pushed her food away.

Ethan lowered his gaze, his tone icy. “I just want you to keep out of our business. I’m not getting a divorce.”

Seeing her son’s firm stance, Mrs. Xu decided to take a step back. “Fine, but you two should move back in with me. This big house feels empty with just me in it.”

Ethan looked at the small bowl of congee in front of him, contemplating. “It’s not convenient to work around here. I’ll come back often, and you can relax.”

Mrs. Xu was left without a counterargument. She sighed, realizing she had to accept Ethan’s decision.

After leaving the Xu household, Ivy was about to hop into a cab when her friend Jason Brooks offered her a ride. “I can drive you home,” he said, but Ivy shook her head.

“No need! You can stick around for your boss, Mr. Xu. I’ve got legs; I can figure out how to get home myself.”

In a neighborhood where hailing a cab felt like winning the lottery, Ivy pulled up her map app to find the nearest bus stop. Thank goodness she had worn comfy flats today; otherwise, her feet would be screaming after such a long trek.

Suddenly, a car honked loudly behind her, and Ivy rolled her eyes. What was this guy's problem? There was no traffic in front of her!

The honking persisted, each blast grating on her nerves. Just as she turned around to unleash her frustration, she saw Ethan leaning out of his car window, looking at her with a smirk.

Ivy decided to ignore him and plopped down at the bus stop. Ethan parked in front of her, waiting for her to get in.

"I’m just going to call a cab," she muttered to herself as she focused on her phone, trying to summon a ride. After several minutes of waiting with no luck, she felt her irritation boil over and repeatedly tapped her screen to try again.

A bus rolled up, and Ethan's car blocked its path. The bus driver honked impatiently, and people inside started yelling, “Hey! Are you going to move or what? Is this your private road?”

Mortified, Ivy quickly stood up and scrambled into Ethan's car. “Go! Just drive!”

Ethan chuckled, finally satisfied as he turned the ignition.

As they drove, Ivy furiously typed a message to her best friend, Daisy Lin.

**[Ethan is such a crazy driver!]**

Meanwhile, Daisy was at a party, surrounded by friends and drinks. She thrived on gatherings, and if she wasn’t busy filming a show, she was definitely at a party.

“Is this your new boyfriend?” one of her friends, Zach, asked, eyeing Michael Wood, who was trying to impress everyone with his guitar skills.

Daisy tilted her head, smirking. “Does it matter? As long as he makes me laugh!”

Michael, lost in his performance, thought about how much Daisy loved to see him play. He had his eyes set on her for more than just her charm; she knew influential music producers, and he was itching for any opportunity to get noticed.

After finishing a song, he glanced over at Daisy, only to see her completely engrossed in her phone, not giving him a second glance. His heart sank.

As the party wrapped up, Daisy playfully pinched Michael’s cheeks. “Why the long face?”

Michael sighed, “I sang my heart out, and nobody cared.”

“I cared,” Daisy replied with a wink.

Michael felt a flicker of hope. “But I want more people to hear me sing.”

Daisy’s interest waned; she was used to people wanting something from her. But Ivy was different. She genuinely liked Ivy, and that made her want to help.

Leaning back on the couch, Daisy raised an eyebrow. “So how do you plan to get more listeners?”

Michael, oblivious to her fading enthusiasm, excitedly replied, “I know you know producers! Can you introduce me? Maybe they’ll like my music and I’ll finally get noticed!”

Daisy looked at him with a mix of pity and annoyance. She wasn’t interested in playing the matchmaking game for his music dreams. 

“Your voice deserves to be heard,” she said, trying to sound supportive, but her tone was laced with sarcasm.

Michael couldn’t help but beam at her encouragement, leaning into her touch as she absentmindedly played with his hair. The old him would’ve hated this, but somehow, with Daisy, he felt comfortable.

Who said people don’t change? Just look at him now, opening up to someone he actually liked.
