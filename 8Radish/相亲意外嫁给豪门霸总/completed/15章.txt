**Title: A Room for Two**

Ivy Gonzalez blinked a few times, trying to process what just happened. Maybe it was a few seconds or a few minutes—who could tell? All she knew was that her head felt foggy, her back was stiff as a board, and tears were brimming in her eyes, refusing to spill. She clutched her cup tightly, her knuckles white, as her friend Xiaoyue's words pierced through her fragile pride like a sharp knife.

She knew she was pretty enough; otherwise, why would Ethan Clark be so keen on marrying her? If she were just plain Jane, he probably wouldn’t have looked her way. After their marriage certificate was signed, Ivy felt like she was living in a secret. She didn’t think there was anything glamorous about their union, and aside from her mom, she kept it under wraps. With Ethan’s reputation, people would surely connect the dots, and she dreaded the thought of being labeled as just another girl who snagged a rich guy by flaunting her looks.

At the little karaoke bar where she worked, even Michael Wood recognized her singing was subpar. Did she think Emma Ward hadn’t noticed? Sure, Emma overlooked her shortcomings, probably because she was easy on the eyes. Ivy got a few perks because of her looks, but she always played it off as luck—until Xiaoyue had to go and burst that bubble.

Ivy lowered her gaze and let out a soft chuckle. “You know, you’re not wrong. I guess I do rely on my looks a bit…”

With a sigh, she bid Xiaoyue goodbye and turned only to bump into Michael Wood, who was standing behind her like a ghost. She gave him a slight nod and a quick “thank you” before making her escape.

The next morning, Ivy woke up next to her mom, Grace Peterson, who was resting in the hospital bed. She had dozed off with her head resting on her arms, and as she shifted, her limbs protested in soreness.

Grace gently squeezed Ivy’s arm, her eyes filled with concern. “I’m so sorry for dragging you into this mess.”

Ivy had heard her mom say similar things before, and while she used to brush them off, this time felt different. There was a hint of genuine remorse in Grace's voice that Ivy couldn’t ignore. 

She tied her hair into a high ponytail and after washing her hands, picked up an apple to peel. “Don’t worry about me, Mom. Just focus on getting better.”

Her apple-peeling skills had improved significantly over the years. Ethan used to tease her for turning apples into odd shapes, but today she was nailing it—too bad he wasn’t there to see.

As she rummaged through a drawer for a bill to pay, her phone buzzed with a call from the new homeowner who purchased her and Ethan’s place.

“Miss Lin, I’m moving in next week. Please make sure you’ve moved out by then,” the voice on the other end was icy and to the point.

Ivy opened her mouth to negotiate a few extra days, but the caller hung up before she could even start. Where in the world was she supposed to find a place to live on such short notice?

Feeling nostalgic, she glanced at the open chat with Ethan’s name, having stared at it for what felt like forever. It was as if she didn’t recognize those three little words anymore. She struggled to hit “send” on a message inviting him to move in with her.

The line for payment was long, and someone behind her shouted, “Hey, can we move it along? What are you doing just standing there?!”

Startled, Ivy realized they were talking to her. She hurriedly stepped forward, only to look back at her phone and see that she had indeed sent the message. Panicking, she tried to retract it, but Ethan replied almost instantly, leaving her no chance to backtrack.

His response was simple: “Sure.”

Ethan leaned back in his chair at the office, maintaining a cool facade while listening to James Miller report on the day's agenda. Inside, though, he was doing a little victory dance. 

Then, his phone buzzed again. He reached for it, unlocking the screen only to find it wasn’t Ivy; it was his lawyer, Lee.

“Boss, I’ve reminded Miss Lin to move out by the end of this week.”

Ethan barely glanced at the message before tossing his phone aside. James, who had been quietly observing, noted that Ethan seemed unusually anxious today. Typically, he’d be glued to his phone, focused solely on work. 

“Here’s the schedule for today,” James said.

“Got it,” Ethan nodded, then suddenly asked, “Do you know if there’s a big supermarket nearby?”

James hesitated, caught off guard. “Uh, I can go get whatever you need.”

Ethan waved him off, “No, I’ll take care of it. You focus on your tasks.” 

And with that, Ivy's world was about to collide with Ethan's in ways she never saw coming.
