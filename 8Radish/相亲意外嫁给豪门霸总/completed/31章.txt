**The Broken Sign**

The streets were filled with people, all bundled up in their scarves, as the news blared that this winter was colder than any in recent memory. Ivy Gonzalez wrapped her red scarf tightly around her neck and donned her white coat, layering up before stepping outside.

“It’s freezing,” she muttered to herself.

As she left, her eyes caught the tightly shut door of Ethan Clark’s apartment. He probably wouldn’t be back tonight—after all, it was his mom’s birthday. Celebrating with family on a chilly winter night must have warmed his heart.

Ivy glanced up at the heavy, low-hanging clouds, taking a deep breath while memories of her old home and Grace Peterson surfaced. Ever since her father passed away, Ivy had stopped celebrating her own birthday. The thought of asking for a birthday celebration felt too extravagant; even a small cake would eat into the meager budget she shared with Grace.

Birthdays became a luxury they both learned to forgo, treating them like any other day.

After wandering for a bit, she finally arrived at the venue for her livestream. She had specifically asked Emily Jones to schedule it early. Emily grumbled about Ivy's tendency to make unilateral decisions, but with Ivy’s rising popularity, she swallowed her complaints. The team relied heavily on Ivy’s success; without her, they might have been let go.

During the livestream, Ivy found herself occasionally distracted by the screen, noticing that her most loyal fan hadn’t shown up at all. Maybe they were off enjoying another stream somewhere else. The online world could be as fickle as a bubble—one moment you’re loved, the next, you’re not.

After finishing the stream, Ivy made her way to a small tavern. Emma Ward had hastily left the hospital after only a few days, desperate to get back to work. She feared that if she stayed away too long, her job would slip away from her.

Nobody knew Emma had been hospitalized due to an altercation; they simply thought she had family matters to attend to. When Ivy saw her, Emma’s cheerful demeanor was intact, even if her makeup was layered thick to cover the bruises beneath.

“Are you going to sing tonight?” Emma asked, her smile as bright as ever.

“Sure!” Ivy replied, excitement bubbling up.

Once inside the tavern, the warmth greeted her like an old friend. She peeled off her coat and took a seat. Lately, her schedule had been packed with livestreams, leaving her with little time to perform. If she had to film a video, that would eat up even more of her time.

Sophia Bennett, wearing her signature glasses, approached with a grin. “You have to sing at least two songs! And don’t worry; you’ll still get paid.”

Ivy quipped back, “You’re so good at business, you wouldn’t take a loss if your life depended on it!”

As she stepped onto the small stage, a loud shout rang out from the audience. “Isn’t that the popular girl from online?” A middle-aged man, reeking of alcohol and sporting a receding hairline, stumbled toward her. “What are you singing? I’ve been waiting for you! Come drink with me!”

Ivy’s brows furrowed as she regarded the drunken man. Even at a distance, the smell of alcohol was overpowering. She chalked it up to the usual rowdy crowd—no big deal. Shifting her gaze to Michael Wood, who was seated further back, she murmured, “Let’s get started.”

Just as she began to sing the first line, the drunken man threw his glass, shattering it across the floor. “Aren’t you the one who sells smiles online? Why are you being shy now?” He continued to hurl his drink, even smashing a few others in the process. “Is my tab not big enough?!” 

The crowd started to disperse, surprised by his antics. Emma quickly called for security, but the man was stronger than he appeared, swinging his arms wildly. The two bouncers hesitated, clearly intimidated.

It was Sophia and Michael who finally managed to drag the man outside. But he wasn’t done yet; he found a hefty stick and began swinging it around like he was in a wild west showdown, keeping everyone at bay.

Ivy couldn’t help but watch as the man stood by the door, glaring at the tavern’s sign. With a wild swing, he began attacking the sign, determined to break it.

BANG!!!

The tavern’s sign fell, shattering with a loud crash. People rushed outside to see what happened. Ivy followed, looking up to see the remains of what used to be a three-letter sign. Now, only two letters remained, creating a rather comical sight.

The tavern’s name, “If There’s Love,” had lost its middle letter, which now lay in pieces on the ground, reflecting colorful lights like a shattered rainbow—strangely beautiful, yet bizarre.

“Stop standing around! Get him out of here!” Sophia yelled, her face flushed with anger.

Finally snapping back to reality, the bouncers tackled the man to the ground. Meanwhile, Sophia hurried inside, returning with a bag to collect the broken pieces of the sign, as if it were a treasured possession.

“Really? It’s just a sign,” Ivy thought, bemused.

“Okay, it’s over! Everyone go back inside,” Emma announced, quickly dispersing the crowd. She shot a glance at Sophia, who was still on the ground, carefully picking up the shards.

Ivy picked up a piece near her feet and walked over to Sophia, about to hand it to her when Sophia snapped, “Don’t touch that!”

Ivy had never seen Sophia so furious before; it startled her. She carefully placed the shard down in front of Sophia. Just as she was about to pull away, Sophia’s hand shot out, grabbing Ivy’s wrist with surprising force.

“Hey, that hurts,” Ivy winced.

“Sorry,” Sophia replied slowly, releasing her grip. “I just feel so stupid for letting this happen!”

“It’s not your fault…” Ivy began, but was interrupted as someone called her name.

“Ms. Ivy!”

Turning around, Ivy spotted Jason Brooks standing behind her. Instinctively, she glanced back and saw Ethan’s car parked a short distance away, its windows tinted so dark she couldn’t see inside.

“Mr. Ethan is waiting for you in the car,” Jason said, maintaining his usual polite demeanor.

Ivy sighed, feeling the weight of the evening’s chaos. But through it all, she found a strange sense of camaraderie in the madness—maybe even a little love in the air.
