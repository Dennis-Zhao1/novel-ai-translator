**He’s Young and Handsome**

“Why are you still here on New Year’s Eve?” Ivy Gonzalez raised an eyebrow at Liam Harris, who was sprawled in a rocking chair next to the fireplace, looking so cozy he might just drift off to sleep. She couldn't believe he had been hanging around her place for a week, and even now, on the most festive night of the year, he hadn’t gone home.

Liam stretched lazily and replied, “The hotel was freezing! I couldn’t sleep a wink. This is way comfier!” 

Ivy walked over, peering down at him. “You’re not planning on mooching off my family’s New Year’s dinner, are you?”

Liam had been orbiting around her like a lost puppy these past few days, and anyone could see he was into her. But Ivy was not in a position to get tangled up with him—especially since she was still technically married to Ethan Clark.

With a playful grin, Liam hoisted himself up with his cane. “What can I say? Your mom’s cooking is irresistible!”

Ivy couldn’t help but laugh. Liam had a knack for spinning tales that could charm the socks off anyone.

“Ivy!” Grace Peterson, her mom, emerged from the kitchen still wearing her apron. “What’s so funny? He’s not wrong; my cooking is pretty great!”

With that, Grace brought out a steaming pot, and predictably, it was another round of hot pot. 

“Mom, is this what we’re having tonight?” Ivy asked, eyeing the bubbling broth.

Grace blinked innocently. “Unless you want to cook?”

Ivy promptly shut her mouth. She was not about to complain about a free meal, especially from someone who actually knew how to cook. Meanwhile, Liam was practically salivating. “I love hot pot! Your mom’s is the best!”

Ivy stared at him, surprised. When was he planning on leaving? At this rate, her mom might end up serving hot pot until next winter!

At the dinner table, Liam was completely at ease, treating Ivy’s home like it was his own. After polishing off a bowl of rice, he confidently reached for a second helping. Ivy offered to help, worried about his injured foot, but he waved her off and filled his bowl to the brim again.

As Liam dug in, Grace suddenly looked curious. “Hey, Liam, don’t your parents want you home for the New Year?”

Liam paused, the light in his eyes dimming slightly before he replied, “My parents divorced ages ago. They’ve both moved on and have new families. I don’t really fit in anywhere.” He shrugged, trying to sound casual, but Ivy could sense the sadness beneath his bravado.

Then, he perked up again. “But honestly, I usually spend New Year’s alone. This hot pot is a serious upgrade!”

Ivy felt a pang of guilt for wanting him to leave so quickly, but Liam’s next move was mischievous. He glanced at her, smirking, “Feeling sorry for me? Well, in that case, you should share some of those meatballs!”

Ivy was about to snap back when her phone rang. “Hold on.” She glanced at the caller ID and realized it was Ethan.

“Hello?” she answered, not hiding her annoyance.

“Hey, didn’t expect to hear you sound so cheerful,” Ethan teased, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

Ivy cleared her throat, trying to sound casual. “Did you eat yet?”

“Yep,” Ethan replied coolly. “Just me and my mom at home. She’s already in bed after dinner.”

Meanwhile, at the table, Grace had asked Ethan’s mom if Ivy was spending the New Year with her family. Ethan quickly jumped in to cover for Ivy, explaining that she had come home to spend time with her mom since she hadn’t been around much lately.

“Good, she should spend time with family,” Ethan’s mom replied, but the mood was still tense.

As Ivy was about to hang up, Liam shouted from across the room, “Who’s on the phone? You’ve been chatting for ages!”

Ethan’s voice darkened on the other end. “Who’s that guy? Why is there a man’s voice?” 

Ivy shushed Liam, then explained, “Oh, it’s just Liam. He’s spending New Year’s here.” 

“Liam Harris?” Ethan’s tone shifted, full of jealousy now. 

Ivy thought he didn’t remember Liam, so she added, “We met at that little bar.”

Ethan’s grip tightened on his glass. “Oh? Is he your next target?”

Ivy couldn’t help but laugh at his annoyance. “Yep! I’m just waiting to get this divorce finalized. He’s young and handsome!”

Ethan’s voice turned into a low growl. “Ivy!”

Seeing him riled up made Ivy even more mischievous. “What’s wrong? You think it’s okay for you to have a crush on Noah Scott while I can’t have a handsome guy around?”

Ethan tried to explain, but Ivy hung up on him, fuming about how she was getting mad over a phone call during the holiday season.

She had thought that once she and Ethan were married, they’d fight over whose family to visit during the holidays. But after everything that had happened, it was clear they both knew the truth: a big family reunion was a fantasy, and the reality was everyone would go their separate ways, happy.

“Are you coming to eat or what? The meat’s going to run out!” Liam poked his head into the living room, finding Ivy frozen in place.

Ivy dropped her phone and headed back to the dining room, but her mood had soured significantly. Meanwhile, Liam was practically in his element, especially after hearing Ivy talk about wanting a divorce. He loaded her bowl with a generous helping of beef. “I might’ve stolen a meatball, but I’m giving you beef back. Fair trade, right?”

Ivy stirred her bowl absentmindedly, her mind elsewhere. She silently promised herself to always check the caller ID before picking up the phone next time.

Grace, sensing her daughter’s mood, climbed upstairs to Ivy’s room. She found Ivy bundled up in her comforter, hiding her face. Grace pulled back the blanket. “Aren’t you just a little too cozy in there?”

Ivy rolled over, facing away from her mom. She didn’t want to show how blah she felt.

Grace sat next to her. “So, are you really thinking about divorcing Ethan?”

Ivy turned to her mom, surprised. “Why the sudden interest?”

“Just curious,” Grace said, nodding toward Liam downstairs. “What’s going on with him?”

Ivy sat up, facing her mom. “He’s just a friend! Look at him, he’s practically a bottomless pit when it comes to food. Friends do that, right? Don’t read too much into it.”

Grace chuckled. “Yeah, it’s like we suddenly have an extra son in the house. He’s eating us out of house and home!” 

And just like that, both of them burst into laughter, the tension easing for a moment.
