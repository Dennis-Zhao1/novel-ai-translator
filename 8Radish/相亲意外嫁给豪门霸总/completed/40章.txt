**The Secret's Out**

Maybe it was the Supermoon shining down, but that night, the moon felt especially cold and distant, like a silent witness to Ethan Clark's turmoil. As he strolled down the street, a bouquet of flowers in his arms, his tall shadow stretched longer under the moonlight. Ivy Gonzalez followed closely behind, stepping carefully on his shadow, each step a reminder of the distance between them.

Ethan cradled the flowers tightly, his gaze fixed on the champagne-colored petals. The scent was lovely—a reminder of what he liked. But then Ivy’s earlier words echoed in his mind, stirring up feelings of irritation and confusion. Why was Ivy so determined to draw a line between them? He couldn’t wrap his head around it.

Ivy watched his resolute back with frustration bubbling inside her. Did he really think she wasn’t willing to support him? Tonight was supposed to be a celebration of his birthday, and she thought she had planned everything perfectly. Yet Ethan’s reaction made her feel like she didn’t understand him at all, that she was somehow letting him down.

After a moment of silence, Ethan abruptly halted, turning to face her, standing a few feet away. Ivy felt her eyebrows shoot up in annoyance, her patience wearing thin. 

“What exactly are we?” he asked, his tone sharp and deliberate. “Do we really need to define this so clearly?”

Caught off guard, Ivy could only stare, struggling to formulate a response.

The next morning, Ivy sank into the couch in her living room, her mind replaying Ethan’s words like a broken record. What were they? Even she couldn’t figure it out. 

Married? Really? If that was the case, it didn’t feel like it. She had never once thought of Ethan as her husband.

Sometimes, she'd wake up confused in his home, unsure of where she was. It felt surreal. A guy like Ethan—good-looking, wealthy, and seemingly unattainable—had chosen to be with her. Why? 

Since moving in, he had been incredibly thoughtful. Every morning, she’d find a homemade breakfast waiting for her on the table. For someone as picky about food as Ethan, preparing meals was no easy task, yet he did it daily without complaint. 

One day, unable to contain her curiosity, Ivy asked, “Do you really enjoy cooking?”

Ethan looked up from the stove and smiled. “I do.”

Once upon a time, he had despised cooking, loathing the smell of grease lingering on his clothes. Back then, his friend Noah had begged him for a home-cooked meal, and Ethan had only teased Ivy, saying they’d have plenty of chances in the future—though he really just wanted to avoid the kitchen. 

Now, he was in there every day. Was it a way to make up for lost time, or had he genuinely developed a passion for it?

Lost in thought, Ivy was jolted back to reality when her phone buzzed. 

“Are you married?” Emily Jones texted her.

Ivy's inner monologue shouted, “It’s none of your business!”

She was still fuming about last night’s events, feeling trapped by the scam that had led her to being used as a drinking buddy. Just seeing Emily’s name made her stomach churn.

But how did she even find out Ivy was married? This was supposed to be a secret! She had been careful to keep that part of her life under wraps. 

As she scrolled through her feed, confusion turned to horror. A viral post featuring her interview photo from a job application at a company popped up, glaringly stamped with “Married” in bold letters. 

Oh no. There went her secret!

If it were a case of someone having the same name, she might have denied it—but that photo was undeniably her. 

The comments were brutal. People accused her of selling a false persona, and rumors swirled that she had two children. 

Really? Two kids? Where did they even come up with this stuff? Ivy’s face turned crimson as she read the insults.

Her follower count plummeted, each cancellation of support feeling like a dagger to her heart. Building her online presence had taken so much effort, and now it was crumbling before her eyes.

Emily texted again. “The livestream is cancelled for now.”

Ivy glanced at her phone, knowing this was coming. Truth be told, she’d grown tired of performing every day. What had started as a quick way to make money had led her down a path she never intended to take. Singing in that little bar had turned into an online sensation, and now her passion felt drained.

Faced with the pressure of performing and the ruthless business side of it all, Ivy considered walking away. But leaving was easier said than done. 

What would she do now?
