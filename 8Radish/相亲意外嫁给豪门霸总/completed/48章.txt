**Chapter One: The Substitute**

As soon as Ethan Clark stepped into the office, he spotted Lucas Smith staring intently at a cluster of preserved flowers. Against the stark, white backdrop of winter, the blooms looked almost annoyingly vibrant.

“Chloe Nelson, what brings you here so early?” he asked, holding a steaming cup of coffee, his mood surprisingly upbeat despite her unexpected intrusion.

Lucas, watching him take a seat, was filled with a wave of irritation. Why did that girl have to make him so happy? The jealousy brewed inside her like a boiling pot, and she couldn’t keep it bottled up any longer. Marching up to him, fists clenched, she blurted, “So just because she looks like Noah Scott, you’re going to marry her?”

After the news about Ivy Gonzalez’s wedding broke, Lucas had stumbled upon the gossip in a friend's post. The girl looked strikingly similar to Noah, and it sparked a wild thought in her mind. She had someone check who Ethan was marrying, and there it was in black and white—“Ivy Gonzalez.” It felt ridiculous and unfair that she was losing to someone who merely resembled Noah.

Ethan’s expression shifted instantly, and with a sharp clap, he slammed his laptop shut. “My life isn’t your business!” he snapped, an edge of anger in his voice.

It was the first time Lucas had ever seen him raise his voice like that. He had always been calm and collected, no matter how spoiled or bratty she got. Her heart sank, and yet, that fiery spirit of hers flared up in defiance. 

“Shameless! If you just like girls who look like Noah Scott, you could’ve told me sooner! I could’ve changed my look! But what does this make you? It’s a waste of my time and disrespectful to her! Does she know she’s just a substitute?!”

The word “substitute” detonated in the air like a bomb, and Ethan shot up from his chair, advancing on her like a predator. His piercing gaze felt like a spear, pushing her back until she stumbled. 

Fear gripped Lucas, but she stood her ground, defiance brimming in her chest. “What? Does she still not know?” she scoffed, a cold smile on her lips.

“Lucas Smith!” he said, each word dripped with warning. “I advise you not to mention her or Noah Scott again.”

His eyes bore into hers, and the tension in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife. She felt the weight of his presence, threatening to crush her if she didn’t back down. Stunned, she opened her mouth but no words came out. Anger welled in her chest, and with red eyes, she stormed out, colliding with James Miller, who was carrying a stack of documents. Without a second thought, she snatched them from him and tossed them into the nearest trash can, kicking it for good measure and muttering, “What a load of crap!”

James was left bewildered, calling after her with no response. “What did I even do?” he wondered, shaking his head. Lucas had to be the most temperamental girl he’d ever met.

Stepping into Ethan’s office, James found him meticulously arranging the preserved flowers. 

“Hey, Ethan! Here’s the data from the marketing and operations teams for our new game. Looks like it’s going to be a major hit!” he announced cheerfully, trying to lift the mood.

“I know,” Ethan replied without glancing up, still focused on the flowers. 

He had always been confident in his grasp of the gaming industry. For him, success was just another day at the office.

While flipping through the reports, Ethan’s phone buzzed. It was a message from the president of TE Corp, who always seemed to know what would catch his interest. The moment he saw the name “Ivy Gonzalez,” he knew he’d have to take a look.

**TE Corp President:** “The social media star Ivy Gonzalez wants to terminate her contract. Should we consider investing in her company to bring her on board?”

Ethan’s expression darkened as he slammed his phone on the desk. 

Ivy stormed into the company, straight to her boss, Mr. Wu, who greeted her with a knowing smile, as if he had anticipated her arrival. After her drunken escapade with Ethan, she believed she no longer needed this place. With someone like him backing her, she thought she could find a much better opportunity.

“Of course, I’ll let you go,” Mr. Wu said, pouring her a cup of tea, a smirk playing on his lips. “But it’s going to cost you a million dollars in termination fees.” 

Ivy nearly flipped the table. “What the hell! Where do you get off asking for a million dollars?” 

Mr. Wu had prepared for this, pulling out a thick stack of invoices and throwing them on the table. Ivy glanced over them, her heart sinking as she saw every expense listed—clothing, makeup, PR fees, even the daily car services. 

Realization hit her like a ton of bricks. She couldn’t sort this out on her own; she needed a lawyer. A million dollars? She had never even seen that kind of money, let alone been asked to pay it back.

After leaving the office, Ivy checked her bank balance, knowing full well it wouldn’t come close to a million. Frustrated, she started searching online for lawyers, grimacing at the thought of these companies being so experienced in cornering people.

Just when she thought it couldn’t get any worse, her friend, Dai Yinyin, texted her, asking about the wedding rumors.

“Seriously? You’re just asking now?” Ivy replied, feeling the weight of it all.

Dai Yinyin sent a laughing-crying emoji, explaining she’d been in training and hadn’t looked at her phone. 

After some chit-chat, Ivy mentioned the contract termination. Dai Yinyin offered to recommend a lawyer and even said she’d lend her money if needed. Ivy smiled but declined the offer. 

“Let’s not mix friendship with money,” she said. 

As they wrapped up their conversation, Dai Yinyin insisted on inviting Ivy to a New Year’s Eve party. Ivy hesitated, but Dai Yinyin urged her to come, promising to wait.

Staring at the words “New Year,” Ivy felt the weight of time hit her. How had the year flown by so fast? How many days had she spent with Ethan? 

She looked up at the gray sky, pulled her hat lower, and lit a cigarette, taking a slow, contemplative walk forward. 

The game was on, and she was just getting started.
