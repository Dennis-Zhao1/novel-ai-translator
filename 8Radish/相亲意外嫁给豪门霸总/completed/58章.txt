**Marry Him**

“What is going on here?”

Ivy Gonzalez's knee slammed into the floor, sending a shock of cold pain shooting through her body. She stood up, rubbing her knee, utterly bewildered. What was the point of this place? Weren't they supposed to tell her why Ethan Clark was getting married? 

Now, the theater was empty.

Ivy Gonzalez looked around aimlessly, confusion swirling in her mind. Suddenly, a beam of light from a projector cut through the darkness, illuminating the screen in front of her. She instinctively leaned forward.

The theater brightened just a tad, and Ivy scrunched her lips in annoyance. Following the light, she focused on the screen, where the sounds of laughter and chatter began to fill her ears. The image became clearer as she moved closer, her fingers brushing against the rows of empty seats.

On the screen, a group of people appeared, all smiles, each one holding a bouquet of roses.

“Say yes! Say yes!” 

Amid the chaos, Ivy finally grasped what they were saying. 

She moved closer to the screen, her heart racing, only to see the camera switch to focus on someone else. 

Ethan Clark.

This was the face she had known like the back of her hand, yet it felt entirely unfamiliar. His cheeks were slightly flushed, a charming smile lighting up his features as he walked down a flower-strewn aisle, dressed in a crisp white suit with a black bow tie, exuding confidence and bashfulness at the same time.

Ivy's heart sank. That path led directly from the grand hall to the backyard of a villa she would never forget—the same villa where Ethan had once taken her. 

She sat down slowly, nails digging into the armrest, a question spiraling in her mind: Had he married someone else here before?

Just then, the camera zoomed in on a girl’s face.

No way!

Ivy's heart dropped as panic surged through her. She jumped to her feet, instinctively rushing toward the door, hair falling across her face. She couldn’t bear to look at the screen and the girl who looked so much like her. Her hands pounded against the door, pushing and pulling, but it wouldn’t budge. She began to bang on it in desperation.

“Let me out!”

She screamed, palms stinging red, but the silence outside felt suffocating as if the entire theater had become her prison.

“Noah Scott.” 

Ivy froze at the sound of Ethan’s voice. It snapped her back to reality. Gathering her courage, she slowly lifted her gaze to the screen again.

Ethan was down on one knee in front of Noah Scott, holding out a stunning bouquet of roses, saying the cliché words every girl dreams of hearing, “Noah Scott, will you marry me?”

Once upon a time, Ivy thought proposals were cringe-worthy and awkward, giving her goosebumps at just the mention of the word. She believed it put the person being proposed to in a no-win situation. 

Yet now, she found herself enviously longing for the girl who stood before Ethan, receiving all his affection.

When the girl finally said yes, Ethan swept her into his arms, looking as though he had just won the lottery. Cheers and applause erupted around them, and familiar faces like Sophia Bennett and Lucas Smith flashed across the screen.

And then, just like that, it all came crashing down.

The screen went black, revealing stark white text against the darkness: 

**Noah Scott passed away on November 4, 2018.**

Ivy felt as if the floor had dropped out from under her, a cold wave washing over her like she was standing in Noah's grave, buried alongside him. Her hands and feet began to tremble uncontrollably as she sank to the floor, clutching her chest, nausea rising in her throat. The sweet nothings Ethan had whispered to her felt like poison now, making her skin crawl.

She berated Ethan in her mind. How could he be so cruel? 

Everyone knew she was just a stand-in, a pathetic joke.

The video looped again, that name echoing in her ears, Noah Scott’s face repeatedly flashing before her. 

“Stop it!” Ivy screamed, her voice raw as she shouted into the void, but the video kept playing, relentless in its torment.

Stumbling to the front of the screen, she yanked off her earrings and used the sharp metal to cut through the fabric of the projection, desperate to silence it until the images finally faded away. 

At last, the world fell silent.

Ivy slumped to the ground, feeling as if she had lost her soul. When she finally opened her eyes, everything around her appeared hazy, as if she were looking through fog. She closed her eyes and reopened them, regaining some semblance of composure.

She steadied herself against the wall, wiping the tears from her face. 

A sliver of light peeked through the door, which had opened slightly, and Ivy pushed it open, finally escaping the nightmare.

Meanwhile, Lucas Smith, who had been monitoring the whole scene from the projection room, regarded her with a mix of concern and surprise.

“Miss Lee, about the screen...” he began cautiously. The projection screen was worth a fortune, and he had a feeling he’d be in trouble for not stepping in sooner. 

Lucas had thought he was just clearing out the theater for Ethan, not witnessing a dramatic showdown that would likely cost a pretty penny. 

“Don’t worry, I’ll handle it,” Lucas replied coolly, looking down at the disheveled Ivy with a smirk. He quickly sent the video he had just recorded to Ethan—it was too good of a moment to miss.

Meanwhile, Ethan was deep in a meeting, trying to wrap things up quickly to make it to dinner on time. He was tapping his notebook, brow furrowed, urging the team to get to the point. “Let’s skip the fluff; we don’t need to keep repeating what’s already been said.”

Just then, James Miller walked in with his favorite snacks, chuckling, “Hey, boss, I heard your stomach growl all the way from the meeting room!”

“Meetings make me hungry,” Ethan replied, cleaning his hands with a wet wipe before grabbing a snack.

James noticed something on his phone that made him raise an eyebrow. “Odd—Jason Brooks just messaged you.”

“About what?” Ethan asked, taking a bite of his treat.

James read the message aloud, “He’s asking if the hawthorn cake is sold out and if you want to switch to a different brand?”

“If it’s not available, then don’t bother,” Ethan said, grabbing his phone. “Why didn’t he just text me directly?”

He opened the message from Jason and saw one from Lucas. His face drained of color.
