**A Trip to Ethan’s Place**  

Ivy Gonzalez stared out the window, feeling worse than the dreary weather outside. The orange streetlights flickered past her face like a strobe light, and she absentmindedly brushed her fingers over her cheek. Suddenly, a lightbulb went off in her head. Why not take advantage of the situation? 

A mischievous grin spread across her face, revealing a dazzling smile that could light up a room. Her eyes sparkled as she turned to Ethan Clark, who was driving. 

“What’s with that look? It’s kinda creepy,” Ethan said, shifting uncomfortably in his seat, trying to create some space between him and the intense gaze of Ivy.

Ivy’s smile faltered for just a moment, and she chuckled awkwardly, “Can I ask you a favor?” Her voice was soft and sweet, and her long lashes fluttered like butterfly wings. 

Ethan found himself captivated; she looked like a little fairy. He gulped, his eyes darting left and right, before nodding mechanically.

With a swift motion, Ivy pulled out a freshly printed resume from her bag—it was still warm! Beaming, she handed it to him. 

“Mr. Xu, this is my resume. Is there any chance I could get an interview? I’ve been a huge fan of your company for ages and would really love to be part of it…”

Ethan was momentarily speechless, his mind racing. He couldn’t help but chuckle quietly as he flipped through her resume. The first page had a photo of her looking fresh-faced and just out of college.

Ivy watched him carefully, her excitement wavering as she noticed his serious expression. “I’m not trying to pull strings here,” she hurried to explain, “It’s just that our… relationship might make things complicated. But if you’re okay with it, I’d really love a shot at an interview…”

Her confidence was slipping, and she couldn’t help but feel nervous about whether she’d even get the chance. 

Ethan was well aware of her qualifications; he had been keeping tabs on her since he first saw her. He was surprised she would approach him about working at his company, considering she usually avoided getting too close.

Their driver, Jason Brooks, was utterly bewildered. Were they really married? Was this how couples acted? It was all very bizarre!

Ethan chuckled, crumpling her resume slightly in his hands. “Well, I guess it all comes down to your skills.”

As they were talking, their car pulled up to Ethan’s house. Ivy peered out the window, taking in the surroundings. The house was isolated, with no other buildings in sight, which felt eerie to her. The bushes were trimmed neatly, looking like they were straight out of a gardening magazine. She hesitated to step outside.

To be honest, Ethan was just a familiar face to her—definitely more than a stranger, but still potentially her boss. 

Ethan swung his long legs out of the car and strolled over to Ivy’s window, where she was still peering out, her lashes fluttering like she was caught in some fairy tale.

Then, without warning, he leaned in closer, their faces so close she could feel the warmth of his breath. Ivy jumped back in shock, accidentally banging her chin against the window. “Ouch! You scared me!” she exclaimed, massaging her chin.

Ethan laughed, teasing her about her jumpiness. 

Ivy followed him out, still on high alert. “Why do rich people always live in such empty places?” she muttered to herself, glancing around at the quiet surroundings. There wasn't even a hint of life around, just silence.

Then, out of nowhere, a cat leaped from the bushes with a startled “meow.” Ivy’s face went pale; she had a lifelong fear of cats and dogs.

“Can we maybe check out your place another time? I mean, we have plenty of time, right?” she suggested, trying to back out of the situation.

But Ethan wasn’t having any of that! He had plans, and he wasn’t about to let her escape. 

With a swift motion, he grabbed her hand and led her to the entrance. She felt like she had no choice but to follow.

The grand door loomed ahead, closed tight, and Ivy couldn’t help but comment, “You’d think you’d at least leave the lights on, right?”

They reached the door, and Ethan paused, gesturing for Ivy to open it. She hesitated, her heart racing at the thought of what might be lurking inside. Taking a deep breath, she slowly pushed the door open.

Light flooded the room, and Ivy squinted against the brightness. It was like stepping into a magical fairy world, filled with flowers everywhere. The bright, shiny tiles looked like mirrors, and the spacious living room connected to an enchanting backyard. Ivy was awestruck; she’d never been treated so specially before.

Ethan took her hand gently and led her further inside. The floor was covered in petals, creating a beautiful path that danced beneath her feet with every step. 

Out of nowhere, Ethan produced a flowing veil, waving it like it was a scene straight out of a movie. He placed it atop Ivy’s head, transforming her into a bride right before her eyes.

They locked gazes, and for a moment, the world around them faded away. Ethan’s fingers caressed her face, his eyes soft and full of unspoken affection.

Everything felt surreal, as if it were a dream he’d long imagined. Ivy, feeling a flutter in her heart, squeezed his hand back, a smile blooming on her lips. 

Maybe, just maybe, she had stumbled upon love at first sight. Little did she know, this intimate moment was also Ethan’s way of healing old wounds. It was a bittersweet memory wrapped in joy, and in that moment, both of them felt the stirrings of something magical—like the calm before a storm, pulling them deeper into this unfolding tale.
