**First Time Shooting an Ad**

The movie was still playing, and the main character was screaming and running for their life. 

Meanwhile, the two of them were so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

Ethan Clark glanced back, and their eyes locked. His intense gaze was like fire, making Ivy Gonzalez’s heart race.

Time seemed to freeze.

Ivy’s smile faltered as she realized what was happening. “Uh...sorry,” she blurted out. 

She instinctively pulled her hands away from his face. Her little joke had clearly crossed a line—since when were they this close? 

Ethan huffed, grabbing her retreating hand with a firm grip, and suddenly Ivy felt herself losing her balance, nearly tumbling forward.

In a panic, Ivy wrapped her arms around his back, her lips brushing against Ethan’s ear. The warmth of his skin mixed with the sweet, citrusy scent enveloping her.

Her heart raced even faster, and she tried to pull away, struggling to get back on her feet. Ethan wasn’t having it, though. 

He held her hands down, immobilizing her, and gently tilted her chin up to meet his gaze. “Next time, will you dare to do that again?”

Behind them, the person who had been standing awkwardly was now facepalming, regretting their very existence. They stood no chance against Ethan!

Ethan’s thumb gently rubbed Ivy’s chin, his voice low and teasing. “Why so quiet?”

Ivy blinked, her long lashes fluttering. Better not to mess with the guy, she thought, and decided to play along. “I won’t do it again. Promise.”

With their faces just inches apart, their warm breaths mingled in the air, causing Ethan to feel an unexpected heat rise within him. Swallowing hard, he suddenly released her hand. “I’m going to bed.”

He stood up, hands shoved deep in his pockets, rushing back to his room, hoping Ivy wouldn’t catch on to what had just happened.

Ivy plopped back onto the couch, lowering the volume of the movie, her mind swirling with confusion as she watched him disappear into his room.

Just then, her phone buzzed. Who could be texting her at this hour?

She checked it, and it was a message from Sophia Bennett. 

“Can we still be friends?”

Ivy stared at the screen, realizing Sophia must’ve guessed what she was thinking. Why even bring it up? It just added to her stress.

“Sure,” Ivy replied, relieved. If she hadn’t said that, she might never set foot in the bar again.

People always say love is fragile, but honestly, every emotion is just as sensitive—too much pressure can break anything, so why bother testing the waters?

Ivy didn’t want to risk it anymore. Whenever someone showed her kindness, she questioned if she deserved it or how she could repay them.

But right now, she didn’t have the energy for those thoughts.

Today marked Ivy’s first official ad shoot, and she could hardly contain her excitement. 

Unlike her usual solo livestreams, the studio was buzzing with people, and Ivy wasn’t familiar with all the different roles. All she knew was that everyone seemed to be in a hurry.

Some were setting up cameras, others were handling wardrobe, and some were just standing around looking busy...

She was sitting in the makeup room, getting her face done up in a lovely peach tone she’d never dared to try before. 

Emily Jones had mentioned that another person would be shooting with her, someone named Diana Lin. 

Rumor had it, Diana had connections like no other—scripts others could only dream of were practically handed to her on a silver platter. 

That also meant that she had her fair share of crazed fans who loved to hate on her.

Getting the TE brand commercial was a big deal for Diana, but she’d still received some backlash—though Ivy had taken the brunt of it, shielding her from most of the negativity.

Just a quick scroll through the brand’s mentions showed that seven out of ten comments were criticizing Ivy, while three were aimed at Diana.

“TE really chose a low-tier streamer like Ivy Gonzalez! I’m not buying their products anymore!”

“Stick to streaming, Ivy! No need to step on anyone’s toes!”

“Diana Lin is truly the queen of resources!”

Sure, the online hate was annoying, but it didn’t affect their bank accounts. 

Ivy had seen it all during her livestreams and learned not to let it bother her too much. Besides, working with TE was a rare opportunity.

About half an hour later, Diana and her entourage rolled in.

With about ten people trailing behind her, Diana stepped into the room. Her features were stunning, as if sculpted by the gods—everything about her was delicate and charming.

Ivy couldn’t help but stare, completely forgetting about her phone. A beauty like that was hard to come by!

Diana greeted everyone in the room with a smile, and when she turned to Ivy, her smile widened, revealing a cute dimple. Up close, her large, bright eyes were adorable and innocent, like a perfect little schoolgirl.

Standing together, they were a sight for sore eyes—who doesn’t love looking at beautiful people?

Ivy had practically zero experience shooting ads, and she had no clue how to pose. Thankfully, Diana was there to help her out.

“Look at that camera over there,” Diana whispered softly in her ear.

Ivy mentally thanked her. How could anyone be so cute and still deal with all that online hate?

During a break, Ivy took the chance to step outside for some fresh air. 

The space inside was decent-sized, but it felt cramped with so many people around.

She wandered to a quiet corner, where the trees were bare, and sat down to catch her breath.

To her surprise, she spotted Diana sitting there, crouched down and smoking a cigarette.

Diana was staring at the ground, lost in thought, and Ivy couldn’t help but ask, “Aren’t you cold?”

Diana looked up, and for a moment, Ivy could see the embarrassment flash across her face—getting caught smoking was never fun, even if she was an adult.

“Not at all! It’s much nicer out here,” Diana replied sheepishly.

Ivy crouched down next to her and pulled out her own cigarette. “Got a light?”

Diana quickly fished out a lighter from her pocket, shielding the flame as she lit Ivy’s cigarette.

They exchanged glances and suddenly broke into laughter, the kind that feels good and light.

“Ah, this is nice!” Ivy said, squinting her eyes and taking a deep drag, letting the smoke roll out slowly, her mood instantly lifting.

Diana took the cigarette from her mouth, grinning. “So nice!” 

They both laughed, leaning against each other, enjoying the moment. 

And just like that, they found a little slice of joy amidst the chaos of the day.
