**Title: The Unexpected Encounter**

It was just another day in the upscale neighborhood of Crestwood Heights when Lucas Smith found herself amidst a commotion at the entrance. With her hands shoved deep into her coat pockets, she observed the scene with a mix of disdain and curiosity. She couldn’t believe that Ethan Clark—one of her old college acquaintances—was living in such a modest place with his new bride, Ivy Gonzalez, when he had a whole collection of lavish mansions at his disposal. Was this love, or was there something else going on here?

Just as Lucas was about to push her way through the crowd to investigate, a security guard stepped in her path.

“Excuse me, miss. Are you a resident here? You look a bit out of place,” he said politely.

Lucas shot him a sharp look. “Mind your own business! I’m going in!”

The guard moved to block her entrance, his expression shifting to serious. “This is a private community. We can’t let just anyone in.”

“Are you kidding me? You think you can stop me?” Lucas huffed, shoving past him. But the guard wasn’t budging, and in the ensuing struggle, she lost her balance and fell, landing hard on her backside.

“Miss Lin, please come this way,” the guard said as Ivy Gonzalez approached, deftly sidestepping Lucas.

Lucas looked up, momentarily stunned. Ivy looked just like Noah Scott, a pop star she had a major crush on back in college. “Ivy Gonzalez?” she blurted, momentarily forgetting the embarrassment of sitting on the wet ground.

Ivy, looking confused, extended her hand to help Lucas up. “Do I know you?”

“Uh, I’m a big fan of yours!” Lucas blurted out, thinking fast.

Ivy’s eyes widened in surprise. “Really? I didn’t think I had any fans left after all the online drama.”

“Did you hurt yourself?” Ivy asked, noticing Lucas’s damp pants. “You’ll catch a cold like that. Want to come in and clean up?”

Before Lucas could protest, Ivy was already pulling her toward their new home. As they walked, Lucas couldn’t help but admire Ivy’s stylish black coat and knee-high boots. She looked effortlessly chic, a stark contrast to Noah’s more flamboyant style.

As Ivy punched in a code on the door, Lucas caught a glimpse of the numbers—“110413”—and felt a shiver run down her spine. “Ethan’s lost it,” she thought, suppressing a snicker.

Once inside, Lucas spotted Ethan’s pricey shoes on the shoe rack. She rolled her eyes, remembering how picky he was about his stuff. “He even flies to Italy for custom orders—so extra,” she muttered under her breath.

Ivy gestured for Lucas to sit on the couch, which was adorned with cartoon pig throw pillows that made Lucas cringe. While Ivy disappeared upstairs for a hairdryer, Lucas wandered around the apartment, her eyes landing on a fridge plastered with selfies of Ivy and Ethan. Each one captured Ethan gazing lovingly at Ivy, though all Lucas could feel was a twinge of bitterness. How much of that love was real?

When Ivy returned with a hairdryer and a fresh pair of pants, Lucas felt a rush of gratitude mixed with embarrassment. “Thanks, but I should really be going,” she stammered, not wanting to overstay her welcome.

“Wait! Here’s the spare pants,” Ivy insisted. “You need to change. You don’t want to catch a cold.”

Lucas took the pants reluctantly and shuffled into the bathroom. Staring at her reflection, she couldn’t help but notice how different she looked compared to Ivy. “If only I had a bit of her charm,” she sighed, feeling a surge of frustration.

Meanwhile, Ivy was chatting with Ethan over the phone. “I ran into a fan at the gate. She’s in the bathroom changing,” she said, her voice cheerful.

Lucas, overhearing, felt a pang of guilt. She didn’t want to be a burden. When she emerged, she quickly made her way toward the door, pants in hand.

“Did you see her?” Ivy asked, her eyes lighting up.

“Nope! Just me!” Lucas replied too quickly, making a beeline for the exit. She peeked around the corner, praying she wouldn’t bump into Ethan as she dashed out.

Once outside, she spotted Ethan and his friend Bella Collins carrying groceries, and ducked behind a railing, waiting for them to pass. The guard still eyed her suspiciously as she slipped away.

“Hey, where’s your fan?” Ethan asked Ivy as he kicked off his shoes.

“Just left! You should have seen her; she was adorable,” Ivy gushed.

Ethan shrugged, more interested in Ivy’s smile than the mysterious fan. “I cooked a new dish! Can’t wait for you to try it,” he said, holding up the grocery bag excitedly.

As Ivy followed him into the kitchen, Lucas couldn’t help but feel a mix of envy and longing. “Maybe someday,” she whispered to herself as she walked away, a hint of a smile playing on her lips. 

Who knew a chance encounter could stir up so many feelings?
