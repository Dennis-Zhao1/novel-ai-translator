**Misunderstood Connections**

“Wow, people sure love to hate on you online. We really are in the same boat!” 

Dai Yinyin had never met Ivy Gonzalez before today, but after doing a quick search, she found out Ivy was a pretty well-known streamer. 

“Anyone in this line of work gets their share of criticism,” Ivy said, smashing her cigarette out in an ashtray with a laugh. “These days, even regular folks get dragged for just saying a few words online. Imagine what it’s like for us!” 

Since Ivy first rose to internet fame, she’s had her fair share of fans and haters alike, but let’s be real—those haters just meant more cash in her pocket. 

Dai Yinyin couldn’t help but envy her nonchalance. Every time she saw a nasty comment about herself, she felt a wave of anger, and she didn’t dare share her feelings with her family. Her dad was a famous actor, and her mom was a superstar singer. Dai Yinyin got into acting purely for the love of it, but the backlash was starting to weigh on her. 

“People say I only got roles because of who my parents are.” It was true; some people did choose her because of her family name, but she didn’t choose her parents, did she? If a great script came her way, would she really let it slip through her fingers just to avoid some online bullies? 

Ivy noticed the downcast expression on Dai Yinyin’s face. “Hey, don’t let it get to you. You’ve got to brush it off.” 

Dai Yinyin lifted her head and managed a smile.

After wrapping up their shoot, they headed back to the studio. On the way, Ivy pondered skipping her evening stream. She had already spent all day in front of the camera, and her face felt frozen in a smile. But then again, how could she save up money without hustling? 

“Opportunity doesn’t knock twice, you know?” she thought. 

As expected, when she went live, the trolls came out in droves. 

“Without filters, she must look awful.” 

“Bet she’s sleeping with the bigwigs over at TE.” 

“I’m never buying TE products again.” 

“How did she even get famous? Seriously?” 

Ivy had a knack for filtering out the noise, focusing on the compliments instead, but she couldn’t help but notice the lack of positivity today. 

“Whose fans are this ruthless?” she chuckled to herself, finding it amusing that she had finally reached the point where she was getting dragged by so many people online. 

Meanwhile, her friend Emily Jones, who was also in the streaming business, was in a great mood. “Tonight’s numbers are looking good!” 

Ivy thought to herself, “Well, they’re not the ones getting trashed!” 

But then, suddenly, the chat exploded with colorful gifts and cheerful messages, catching Ivy’s eye. 

“Oh! It’s that mysterious account that always tops the gifting leaderboard!” Ivy had noticed that account hadn’t popped up in days. 

She didn’t care to dig too deep into who it was, but she had heard rumors that some fans would shower streamers with gifts to get their attention for a chance to hang out. 

Then, another familiar username popped up, showering her with praise and gifts. Wait a minute—was that Dai Yinyin? 

Ivy felt a warm glow in her chest, her lips curling into a smile. It was nice to know her friend was supporting her, and it lifted her spirits after a long day. 

After the stream, as she packed up, Emily reminded her, “The folks over at TE want to have dinner with you tomorrow night.” 

Ivy hesitated. She wasn’t fond of those kinds of networking events. 

Emily, sensing her reluctance, added, “Building connections now might lead to future collaborations!” 

Well, in the industry, a girl had to do what a girl had to do! 

Dragging her exhausted body home after a long day, Ivy just wanted to collapse into bed. But to her surprise, the lights were on in her apartment. Someone else was home early. 

Ethan Clark usually worked late, often coming in around two or three in the morning. 

Ivy sometimes wondered why someone loaded like him worked so hard. If she had his money, she’d be jet-setting around the world, savoring ramen in Japan, dining in France, or feeding pigeons in London! 

But no use daydreaming; she sighed and walked in. 

Ethan glanced up from his phone when she entered and quickly pocketed it. He stepped in front of her, blocking her path. 

“Got plans tomorrow night?” 

What was up with everyone wanting to meet tomorrow? Was it some special occasion? 

“Yeah, I do,” Ivy replied while slipping on her house slippers. 

Ethan’s frown deepened, and Ivy felt a twinge of nervousness. 

“Why?” she asked, hoping to ease the tension. 

He just stared at her, his gaze intense. 

Ivy felt a chill. Sometimes, Ethan was an enigma. Why couldn’t he just say what he meant? 

“Look, I need to have dinner with my work colleagues. It’s business. Can we reschedule?” she said, forcing a bright smile. 

Seeing him sulk made her nervous. 

Ethan pouted playfully, wrapping an arm around her neck. “How do you forget something so important?” 

Ivy felt herself lean into him, surprised by his strength. “I didn’t forget! I owe you thirty thousand bucks, and I’m slowly saving up to pay you back!” 

She wasn’t about to let that slip her mind.
