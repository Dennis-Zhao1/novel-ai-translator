**Nothing Without the Xu Family**

“Have a seat, grab some tea,” Grace Peterson said, trying to keep her cool while surrounded by a bustling crowd in her small home. It felt like she had inadvertently hosted the village's annual fair, and despite the tight space and limited seating, she was doing her best to welcome the guests.

Most of them were from her village, some she recognized, but many more were just faces in the crowd. They had gathered early in the morning upon hearing that Ivy Gonzalez, her daughter, had managed to sell all her farm products overnight. Now, they were hoping Ivy could work her magic for them too.

But Ivy was nowhere to be found.

“Hey, little sister!” a woman in a dark red coat grabbed Grace’s hand, her smile bright. “I’m your aunt! Don’t you remember me?”

Grace chuckled awkwardly. Whether she recognized her or not, she nodded vigorously, “Of course, Auntie! How could I forget?”

Meanwhile, Ivy finally returned home, overwhelmed by the noise. It sounded more like a farmer's market than her living room. 

“Look who’s back!” someone shouted, and suddenly Ivy was swarmed by villagers eager to show her their homegrown produce. 

After listening for a bit, Ivy finally understood why they were all there. Word had spread quickly about her recent success with selling products online, and now everyone wanted her help. She immediately dialed up her friend, Olivia Price, who had been her partner in selling these goods online and was well-versed in what everyone was growing.

“Alright, let’s see what we can do here,” Ivy said, looking at the assortment of fruits and veggies being thrust in her direction. It was a shame to think about all the hard work that could go to waste if they rotted in the fields.

“I’ll help you get everything lined up,” Olivia said, snapping pictures and taking notes as Ivy promised she would help sell what she could.

After a long day of organizing, the crowd finally began to disperse. 

“Wow, what a morning!” Grace said, serving them hot tea. “I thought I was going to faint when I saw all those people. I was convinced it was someone coming to collect old debts or something!” 

Ivy rolled her eyes, “Mom, come on! You know better than that.” 

“Hey, it’s not like I expect a parade every day!” Grace shot back, and they both chuckled. 

“Are you charging them for this?” Grace suddenly asked, her curiosity piqued.

Both Ivy and Olivia shook their heads. “Not really,” Olivia explained. “We just want to help them out during this tough season. They’ll have to manage on their own after this.”

“Good plan,” Ivy agreed, “but man, it’s exhausting!” She stretched, feeling every muscle ache from the day’s work.

“Seriously, you’re not even old enough to be complaining about your back yet!” Grace teased, looking at the pile of orders piling up. 

Meanwhile, across town, Ethan Clark was recovering from a three-day stint in the hospital. No matter how much his mother urged him to take it easy, he was back at work before anyone could stop him.

“Ethan, you really shouldn’t jump right into meetings,” James Miller said as he handed Ethan a bland health meal that tasted like cardboard. 

Ethan shrugged, more focused on his phone than the food. His mind wandered to Ivy. Her number was still blocked on his phone, and he could only hear about her through their mutual friend, Emma Ward. 

Suddenly, a news alert caught his eye: **"Online Sensation Ivy Gonzalez Helps Farmers Sell Surplus Produce.”** 

He clicked on the article, surprised to see a picture of her live-streaming. A smirk crept across his face as he saved the image to his phone. 

“Let’s give all the employees a box of radishes and cabbage before the New Year,” he suggested casually to James. 

“Radishes?” James echoed, unsure if he heard correctly. 

“Yeah, just send someone to pick them up,” Ethan replied, brushing off the confusion. 

James could only shake his head, thinking about how lucky Ethan was to have so many women fawning over him, while he was just the secretary who got leftover scraps, like the sad excuse for lunch he had to deliver earlier. 

As Ethan drove toward the family home, he received a call from his mother, her voice shaky and tearful. “Ethan, you need to come home. It’s about your father.”

“What’s going on?” he asked, a knot forming in his stomach.

“Your father wants a divorce,” the words hit him like a freight train. 

Ethan stood in disbelief as he reached the door. How could this happen? His parents had been together for over twenty years! 

His mother was waiting, tears streaming down her face. “If it weren’t for the Xu family, you wouldn’t be where you are today!" she cried.

Ethan felt the weight of her words. It was true; the Xu family's influence had been substantial in his life. Now, everything felt like it was crashing down around him. 

What on earth was happening to his family?
