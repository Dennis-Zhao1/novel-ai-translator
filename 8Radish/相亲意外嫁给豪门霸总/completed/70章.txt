**Unexpected Guests: A Cozy Night In**

Ethan Clark pulled out his phone from his pocket, eyeing Ivy Gonzalez's irritated face. "Did you call me?" He tried to power up his phone, but it was still dead. With a sigh, he mumbled, "It froze on me."

Ivy's annoyance faded a bit. "Stupid phone!" 

Ethan tilted his head, a smirk creeping onto his face. "Worried about me?"

Ivy refused to admit it, feigning indifference as she crossed her arms. "Why are you still here?"

Ethan pointed at the back tire of his car. "Oh, just a little flat tire situation."

Ivy squinted at the tire, realization hitting her. "Great, your fancy car's busted too?"

"Yep, pretty much," he said, glancing at his luxury ride. "I’ll be getting a new one soon. For now, I'll just hop into your car."

Before Ivy could protest, Ethan slid into the passenger seat, buckling up like he owned the place.

Raising an eyebrow, he asked, "So, where to?"

Rolling her eyes, Ivy muttered, "Where do you think? Back to my place." 

She hadn’t planned on picking him up just two hours after dropping him off. Seriously, what kind of cosmic joke was this? On New Year's Day, no less! She slammed the car door as she got out, making sure Ethan heard it.

Ethan stifled a laugh, following her inside. He knew better than to push his luck. "Don’t worry, I’ll just take the couch tonight."

"Yeah, you better," Ivy shot back, shedding her coat and crossing her arms like a protective barrier. "Even though my mom’s not home, don’t get any ideas. You won’t be welcomed back if you do."

As she headed up the stairs, Ivy glanced back and caught Ethan standing in the living room, hands in his pockets, wearing that annoying smirk. It sent a shiver down her spine, so she hurried up and locked her door.

Silence enveloped the house, with only the sound of the wind outside breaking it. Ethan lay back on the couch, staring at the ceiling, replaying memories of Ivy and her ex, Noah Scott, in his mind. He drifted into a light sleep, thoughts swirling around until he finally succumbed to exhaustion.

Meanwhile, Ivy lay in bed, kicking herself for the mess her life had become. "What a disaster!" she thought, wishing she'd kept her mouth shut earlier. 

In the middle of the night, Ivy woke up parched. Tiptoeing downstairs for a glass of water, she heard a thud. "What was that?" she wondered, peering into the living room.

To her surprise, the couch was empty. "Where did he go?" 

Curious, she crept over and found Ethan sprawled out on the floor, still wrapped in his blanket from the couch, completely oblivious. 

"Hey! Ethan! Wake up!" she nudged him with her foot, but he didn’t budge. She kicked him a bit harder. "C’mon, it’s freezing down here!"

No response. So, she crouched down and gently shook his arm. "Seriously, we don’t need to be sleeping on the floor!"

Suddenly, she felt how hot he was—like, burning. Panic set in. "Oh no, you’re sick!" she exclaimed.

Ivy ran upstairs, grabbed two comforters, and returned to him. She placed one under him and draped the other over him, sitting beside him, exhausted. "You’re such a wuss. Can’t even handle a little cold," she mumbled, rolling her eyes.

After a moment, she reached for a cooling patch and placed it on his forehead. Just then, he grabbed her wrist with a surprisingly strong grip. 

"Just so you know," Ivy said, looking down at him, "don’t get any ideas. Treat this as a favor for bringing you the BBQ. You can pretend I'm Noah Scott tonight, and I won’t be mad about it."

Ethan's eyes flickered open, looking up at her with those big, puppy-dog eyes. "You should be mad," he murmured, his voice thick with congestion.

Ivy couldn’t help but feel a twinge of sympathy. "Yeah, well, you’re lucky I’m not heartless. Just don’t expect me to cuddle with you," she replied, trying to sound tough even as she felt a warmth creeping in.

But in a swift motion, he pulled her closer, wrapping her in an unexpected hug. Heart racing, she warned him, "Don’t push your luck!"

Ethan just hummed in response, still holding on. Time ticked by, and eventually, she managed to free herself and headed back upstairs, refusing to look back at him.

The next morning, Liam Harris was in his car, trying to get in touch with Ivy, but it was going straight to voicemail. "Is she seriously sleeping through this?" he wondered, frowning at his phone.

His friend, Daisy, who was driving, shot him a look. "You really think Ivy would stay up waiting for you? Come on, man, don’t be that guy."

As they arrived at Liam’s place, he shrugged off her comments. "They’re practically divorced. I’m just pursuing a normal relationship."

Daisy jumped out of the car and confronted him. "You really think they’re getting divorced? They just had a spat! This is not a reality TV show, Liam."

Liam sighed, rolling his eyes. "Daisy, just chill. I know what I’m doing."

Daisy shot him one last warning. "Ethan’s not someone you want to mess with. Just be careful."

Liam watched her drive away, shaking his head before trudging into his empty apartment.

Ethan woke up groggy, realizing he was still on the floor. "What the heck?" he muttered, dragging himself to the couch. His head felt heavy, and he could barely taste the water he gulped down.

Eventually, Ivy stumbled down the stairs, still half-asleep, and spotted him on the couch with his eyes squinted against the light. Ignoring him, she squatted by the door, her mind elsewhere.

Ethan stood up quietly behind her, unable to resist the urge to run his fingers through her hair. She flinched away, keeping her distance.

Clearing his throat, he asked, "So, what’s for breakfast?"

Suddenly, there was a shout from outside, “Wonton soup!” 

Ivy perked up. "No way, they’re selling today?!" She dashed outside, excitement bubbling over, returning moments later with two steaming bowls of wonton soup. 

And just like that, their unexpected night turned into an unexpectedly cozy morning, filled with laughter, warmth, and the delicious aroma of wonton soup.
