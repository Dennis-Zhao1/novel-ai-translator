### She’s Got Some Moves

The front door of Ivy Gonzalez’s house swung wide open, revealing a few strangers wandering about, inspecting the property. One middle-aged woman took a lap through the living room, then checked out the bedrooms and bathroom, before finally eyeing the walls and ceiling with a hint of disdain. “This place is ancient, and you’re asking for a fortune!” she scoffed.

Ivy couldn’t help but feel a stab of disappointment. Sure, the house was in the heart of town, close to the best schools and hospitals, but she had to sell it quickly. She was practically giving it away—about $10,000 less than the market price. “I could’ve held out for more,” she thought, rolling her eyes internally at the woman’s audacity.

The young real estate agent, eager to seal the deal, jumped in. “Ma’am, this house was renovated just two years ago! Sure, it’s an older building, but the location is unbeatable! Look at the layout and the natural light. You won’t find another deal like this!”

But the lady was having none of it. “So what if it’s renovated? It’s still old! You better drop the price if you want me to buy it.”

The agent glanced at Ivy, who shook her head, signaling a firm no. He plastered on a smile and kept trying to convince her when suddenly his phone buzzed. A call from an unknown number. After a brief conversation, his eyes lit up. New buyer incoming!

Once the lady left, a young man in his thirties arrived. He had a suit jacket draped over his arm, gold-rimmed glasses, and hair slicked back, looking sharp. He barely stepped inside before declaring, “I’ll take it.”

Ivy blinked in surprise. That was it? Just like that? She felt a strange mix of elation and emptiness—this was the home she had lived in for years, and now it was gone. But the silver lining was that she could finally pay off her mother’s debt.

After sorting out the paperwork, she rushed to a nearby tavern. She hadn’t eaten all day! Michael Wood, the bartender, had texted her to come in two hours early, and she couldn’t say no, especially with the new staff starting.

Michael was lounging at the tavern’s entrance, dressed in black pants and a short-sleeve shirt, looking relaxed. When he spotted Ivy running toward him, he straightened up, grabbed his guitar, and waved her over. “Come on, let’s go.”

Ivy’s stomach twisted with nerves. Was he going to confront her about last night’s performance? They walked down a narrow alley beside the tavern, stopping next to a little white shed with a sunflower basking in the sun.

Michael fished out a key and opened the door, stepping inside and plopping his guitar on a nearby chair. He sat on a tall stool, resting his chin on his hand and staring at Ivy, who was still trying to process everything.

After a moment, he smirked. “You were terrible last night.”

Ivy’s jaw dropped. “Excuse me?” That was a blow she hadn’t expected. Sure, she knew she wasn’t the best singer, but how rude! “Well, your guitar skills leave a lot to be desired too!” she shot back.

Michael chuckled but his expression quickly turned serious. “Yeah, well, if I were any good, I wouldn’t be here, would I?” He turned away, adjusting his guitar. “Come on in, don’t just stand there. We need to practice tonight’s set. I can’t have you screwing up and embarrassing us.”

This was Michael’s little practice space, stocked with instruments galore—drums, a piano, and a couple more guitars. Ivy realized that the only way to get better was to put in the work, so she stepped in and began to warm up.

Later that night, Emma Ward sat at the bar, legs crossed, watching Ivy perform. “She’s definitely improved since last night. Michael Wood knows how to teach,” she remarked to the bartender, Xiao Yue.

Xiao Yue poured a green bean-flavored cocktail, eyeing the stage with jealousy. “He’s just a nice guy.”

Emma noticed the tension and raised an eyebrow. “What’s brewing between you two?”

Meanwhile, Ivy was rocking the stage with her curly black hair bouncing with every move. The spotlight made her look radiant. Her confidence soared as the crowd responded with enthusiasm.

After the performance, Ivy dashed to the bar. “Xiao Yue! I’m parched! Can I get a glass of water?”

Xiao Yue shot her a frosty look, slamming the cocktail shaker down. “Can’t you get it yourself?”

Ivy’s smile faltered, and she felt a wave of confusion wash over her. They had been joking before she went on stage, so what had changed? She poured herself a glass of water and took a seat across from Xiao Yue, curiously studying her expression.

After a moment’s hesitation, Ivy finally asked, “Is something wrong?”

Xiao Yue scoffed, looking Ivy up and down. “I just don’t like talking to people who think they can get by on looks alone.” 

Ivy frowned, realizing that not everyone was as friendly as she had hoped. But then again, maybe they just needed more time to get to know one another.
