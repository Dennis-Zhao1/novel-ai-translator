**A Night to Remember**

The little tavern was packed, a bustling crowd wrapping around the block like it was a hot new club or a concert by a top celebrity. You’d think a famous star was in town! 

And even though the place wasn’t open yet, people had already started showing up early to snag a spot and catch a glimpse of the suddenly popular girl, Ivy Gonzalez. Emma Ward, the owner and savvy businesswoman, wasn’t going to let this chance to rake in some cash slip away. She was grinning from ear to ear, practically pulling everyone in for an early shift, including Ivy.

Ivy stood about ten feet away from the tavern, staring at the sea of people in disbelief. This was real! She had gone viral online, and folks were actually coming out to see her. On the way here, she had received a photo from Emma that left her skeptical—could it really be that crazy? But now, seeing it all firsthand, she felt a mix of excitement and nerves.

Suddenly, her shoulder got a playful shove, and she turned to find Michael Wood standing there with a cheeky grin. 

“Hey, superstar! Let’s maneuver through this crowd. I’ll be your bodyguard,” he joked, flashing her a wink.

“Right now? You’re kidding!” Ivy rolled her eyes, playfully pushing his hand away. But she couldn’t help but smile at his antics. She swung her bag and teased him, “You’re so annoying!”

They made their way through the throng, Ivy’s heart racing. Once they reached the rehearsal room, she collapsed into a chair, trying to figure out how to handle this sudden fame. Meanwhile, Michael was too busy polishing his guitar, seemingly unfazed.

“Snow Sister said you should check out how things are going and see if you want to sing tonight,” he said casually.

Ivy sat up, resting her chin on her hand, looking bewildered. “I have no idea how this all happened. It’s so surreal!”

Just then, her phone buzzed. It was her mom, Grace Peterson, calling. Ivy held the phone in front of Michael and groaned, “My mom is addicted to scrolling through short videos. She probably saw me and now she’s freaking out!”

Michael chuckled quietly, knowing she was joking, but also aware that her mom was probably right. Grace had done the best thing when she gave birth to Ivy—now they might just be able to ride this wave of popularity together!

“Hello? Is that you in those videos? Don’t mess this up! This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance!” Grace’s voice boomed through the phone, making Ivy smile despite the chaos.

“Yeah, Mom, I know! I’ll figure something out,” Ivy promised, realizing her mom had a point. This was a golden opportunity, and who knew how long it would last? 

With a burst of determination, she grabbed her phone and set up a short video account, asking Michael to film something quick. As soon as she posted it, the likes and followers started pouring in. They both stared at the screen, jaws dropped, as the numbers climbed into the thousands within minutes.

Welcome to the wild world of social media!

When Ivy finally took the stage to perform, the crowd was electric, phones out and ready to capture the moment. She had transformed from the shy girl who used to get nervous singing in front of a small audience to a confident performer, nailing each song flawlessly. The tavern staff was running around, barely able to keep up with the crowd. It felt like they had hit the jackpot!

After her set, Ivy tried to slip away to help, but the crowd had other plans. People were clamoring for photos, their phones raised high. She stood there, a little overwhelmed, until Sophia Bennett, the owner’s right-hand woman, stepped up with a microphone.

“Alright, everyone! Let’s keep this organized—one at a time for photos!” she said, her voice calm and soothing.

Ivy couldn’t help but admire Sophia’s ability to manage the chaos. Once the crowd began to disperse, everyone was exhausted but exhilarated. Ivy’s cheeks hurt from smiling so much.

“Boss just sent a big bonus!” one staff member squealed, and suddenly everyone was buzzing with energy again, racing to grab their share of the reward.

Sophia plopped down next to Ivy, taking a sip of her drink. “You won’t believe how many influencer companies have been calling me tonight about you,” she teased.

Ivy’s eyes widened in disbelief. “Wow! I can’t believe it! I owe you dinner for this,” she said, feeling a mix of excitement and gratitude.

Sophia chuckled, “Hey, you’ve got the looks and the talent. Just make sure to consider their offers.”

The night wrapped up with Ivy feeling on top of the world, even as she stepped outside and spotted Jason Brooks waiting under a tree, shivering from the cold. Ethan had sent him to pick her up since he was caught up at work.

Ivy rolled her eyes at Ethan’s incessant messaging. “How many times can one guy send ‘where are you?’ texts?” she muttered, shaking her head as she replied with a quick ‘Okay.’

As she hopped into Jason’s car, she felt a rush of relief. No more crowds, no more phone alerts—just the thrill of the night still bubbling within her. Little did she know, this was just the beginning of her wild ride in the world of fame!
