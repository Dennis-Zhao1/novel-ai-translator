**Fireworks Fade Quickly**

Once all the guests had filed in, the security guards at the entrance closed the heavy doors, effectively shutting out anyone who hadn’t received an invite. This also conveniently blocked Ivy Gonzalez, who was peeking around the corner of the staircase.

Ding! Ivy’s phone buzzed with a message. She glanced down to see a text from Ethan Clark, but instead of replying, she quickly set his notifications to “Do Not Disturb,” silenced her phone, and tucked it deep into her purse. She didn’t want to deal with him at that moment; he was just too much.

As Ivy debated whether to sneak home while her best friend, Daisy, was looking for her, Daisy appeared beside her, wrapped snugly in a cashmere scarf. “Aren’t you cold? What are you doing out here?” she asked softly. “Come on, the band is about to start!”

Not wanting to ruin Daisy’s energy, Ivy hurried inside after her.

The small hall was dimly lit, the mood electric with a rock vibe that had everyone buzzing. People who had been glued to their mobile games dropped their devices and surged towards the makeshift stage, forming a circle around it.

That music! Ivy recognized it instantly.

She stood on her tiptoes, eyes scanning the crowd for the performers. “I brought Michael Wood from your favorite tavern to perform,” Daisy said, wrapping her arms tighter around herself. “I mean, what’s a New Year’s party without a band? I saw him playing the other day and thought, why not? Surprise!”

Ivy grinned, focusing on the stage. “Definitely a surprise.”

Michael was an incredible musician, but what totally blew Ivy away was that the drummer sharing the stage with him was none other than Sophia Bennett. She was shocked to see him in this light. 

Sophia had ditched his usual glasses and was clad in an oversized hoodie and ripped jeans, looking like any other college kid jamming out. Ivy almost didn’t recognize him at first.

Since they last saw each other at the office, Ivy had gone to the tavern several times but had missed him. Emma had mentioned he was out of the country for a while, so Ivy didn’t want to bother him with unnecessary questions.

But here he was, on New Year’s Eve.

As Sophia spotted Ivy in the crowd, he quickly turned back to his drums, feeling a mix of nervousness and excitement. He hadn’t played in a while, mostly sticking to guitar, and had practiced a lot to prepare for this night.

His presence at the show was a little more intentional than most people thought. Just that day, when he returned to the tavern with his suitcase, he’d overheard Michael lamenting to Emma. “I finally got a high-paying gig, but I can’t find a suitable drummer!”

“What’s the big deal about needing a drummer?” Sophia had asked, leaning against the bar.

Michael’s face lit up when he saw him. “A singer named Daisy invited me to her New Year’s party, but I’m short a drummer.”

Sophia shrugged nonchalantly. “Oh, okay…”

But when Michael sighed, “I heard Ivy Gonzalez is going to be there. If only she could play drums—she knows all the songs,” Sophia’s interest piqued.

“I can give it a shot,” he volunteered, secretly hoping to show off a bit and relive those old days of performing with Noah Scott, something Ethan Clark had never shared with Ivy. 

Michael and Emma exchanged doubtful looks, clearly questioning why Sophia, who seemed so unassuming, could possibly have the chops for it.

As the performance wound down, Michael caught sight of Sophia, who seemed to be more than capable behind the kit. He couldn’t help but think, “Wow, my boss is multi-talented!”

As the last song ended, Michael suddenly spotted Sophia move toward the mic. “Ivy Gonzalez!” he called out, locking eyes with her. After a brief pause, he asked, “Can we get you up here to sing a song?”

Ivy hesitated. It’d been ages since she last sang publicly, and she thought about saying no. But Daisy was having none of it.

“She’s in!” Daisy chimed, already dragging Ivy through the crowd towards the stage.

Now, Ivy was truly trapped.

Standing before the mic, she glanced around nervously. The band was ready, waiting for her cue. With a sigh, she decided to just go for it.

The room quieted as Ivy took the stage. After a few moments, the drums kicked in, followed by the guitar, and Ivy found herself lost in the familiar melody. All the lights focused on her, and she felt as if she were glowing.

Sophia’s heart raced as he watched her. In that moment, it was as if he were performing with Noah again. Memories flooded back, and he felt a lump in his throat, as if a weight was pressing down on him.

As the song reached its climax, Ivy turned to Sophia, her eyes sparkling as she smiled at him. She then looked over at Michael—something she had never done while performing with Noah.

Sophia froze.

Ivy was not Noah Scott, and he shouldn’t project his past onto someone so different.

As the countdown to midnight approached, Ivy called Daisy back onstage. Daisy bounced up, grabbing the mic and shouting, “3! 2! 1! Happy New Year!”

“Happy New Year!” everyone cheered in unison.

Outside, fireworks erupted with “bangs” and “pops.” Liam Harris yanked open the curtains, and the dark sky exploded into a kaleidoscope of colors. It was a moment full of hope for the new year.

Ivy turned to gaze out at the fireworks, her heart heavy with mixed emotions. She wondered if Ethan Clark was watching the same display from his window with someone else.

Meanwhile, in a dimly lit living room, Ethan sat alone on his couch, chain-smoking. He had rushed home before midnight, missing all the festivities. Lucas Smith was furious with him, having just been talking to industry bigwigs while Ethan slipped away before the celebration began. 

“Where the heck did Ethan go?” everyone was asking Lucas, who could only shrug.

Ethan had come back just to spend the first New Year’s Eve with Ivy. But after countless calls and texts went unanswered, he finally threw his phone against the floor in frustration, hearing only the cold, robotic voice of voicemail on the other end.
