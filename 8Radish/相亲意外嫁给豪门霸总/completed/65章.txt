**Chasing Love**

People usually start pursuing love after they've had their fill of food and drink. Take Ethan Clark's dad, for instance.

Ethan’s dad, whose real name is Leonard Baker, used to be a struggling college student. Back in the day, he fell head over heels for a girl named Melissa, but her family was dead set against their relationship. The Bakers were a well-respected family, and they didn't want their daughter marrying below her status. They made it clear: if Leonard wanted to marry Melissa, he’d have to change his last name to Baker and ensure their future kids carried the Baker name. 

Talk about a major hit to his pride! But with the Bakers’ wealth and influence within reach, Leonard decided to swallow his pride and make the leap. Melissa was over the moon; after all, what girl wouldn't be touched by a man willing to change his name for her?

With the Baker name behind him, Leonard’s career skyrocketed. Suddenly, everyone was fawning over him, and he transformed from a broke college grad to a socialite, living the high life. But now, after years of living the dream, he found himself yearning for something more—love and respect.

“You think I wanted to marry you?” he exploded one evening, slamming his fist on the table. “If it weren't for your family, I wouldn’t have looked your way. Marrying into your family is my life’s biggest humiliation! I can’t even name my own child!”

Ethan, sitting quietly at the side, couldn’t believe his ears. His parents rarely fought; usually, when his mother would snap at him, Leonard would just chuckle and nod along. To the outside world, Leonard was the epitome of a kind, humble man. But Ethan could see the truth: the Bakers weren’t fans of his dad at all. During holiday gatherings, they’d throw snarky comments his way, and Ethan thought that after all these years, Leonard had learned to ignore them. But here he was, ready to explode.

“Unbelievable!” Melissa shot back, pointing her finger at Leonard. “Was anyone forcing you to marry me? You thought you were going to climb up the social ladder, and look where you are now! You think you can just waltz in and claim our son as yours? Not a chance!”

“He's not a bastard! He’s my son! He’s a Baker!” Leonard shouted, throwing his cigarette holder against the wall. “I want a divorce!”

Melissa froze, shock written all over her face. She dropped to her knees, crying hysterically. All for the sake of a woman fifteen years younger than him? What a disgrace that would be for the Baker family!

Ethan rushed to his mother’s side, his heart heavy. “If you’re getting a divorce, I’m with you,” he said slowly, each word carefully chosen.

Melissa’s eyes widened in disbelief. The perfect image of a happy family she had worked so hard to maintain was crumbling before her eyes.

She shakily climbed to her feet and ambled upstairs like a ghost.

Ethan watched her retreating figure, realizing that holding onto a man who didn’t love her was pointless. 

Just then, the gust of wind blew the curtains, causing a rustling sound. Ivy Gonzalez, just out of the shower and shivering, rushed to the window. She intended to pull the curtains shut but caught sight of someone standing outside.

Recognizing Ethan, she quickly shut the window, drawing the curtains tight, blocking any light from escaping.

What was he doing here so late?

Ivy hugged her pillow, tossing and turning in her bed, her mind racing. 

A soft knock at her door interrupted her thoughts. “What on earth are you doing in there, making all that noise?” her roommate Grace Peterson called out.

Ivy immediately silenced herself.

An hour later, unable to resist, she opened the curtains again—only to find Ethan had vanished.

“Ugh!” she muttered, rolling her eyes. “Is he trying to pull some dramatic 'K-drama' moment, or what?”

She wasn’t about to get all mushy over him. She turned off the lights, but sleep eluded her. 

Inside her head, two little voices were arguing: “Go see him or stay put?”

After a brief internal struggle, Ivy decided to step outside. She needed to know if he was still there. After all, he was just getting over being sick, and she convinced herself it was only to check on him.

She tiptoed down the stairs, carefully pushed open the front door, and scanned the area. No sign of Ethan anywhere.

Then, she looked down and spotted him slumped against the wall, dressed in a black suit, his head buried in his knees, shivering.

When he noticed the light from the door, Ethan slowly looked up at her, his expression heart-wrenchingly vulnerable, like a little lost puppy.

Ivy froze, gripping the door handle tightly, ready to shut it. 

He didn’t look at her but murmured, “My parents are getting a divorce. I thought I grew up in a happy family, but my dad hates us.”

As he spoke, he forced out a weak laugh that broke Ivy’s heart. 

Without thinking, Ivy crouched down and gently patted his shoulder, unsure of how to comfort him. After all, her own marriage was crumbling too, so offering words of encouragement felt ridiculous. She couldn’t save him.

Suddenly, Ethan leaned in, burying his face in her neck, wrapping his arms around her waist. Ivy gasped, almost choking from the suddenness of it all. 

Stiffening at first, she hesitated before finally letting go of the door handle and gently patting his back, like she would comfort any sad little dog.

Maybe Ivy had never realized how easily her soft heart could be manipulated.

She let him in, poured him a cup of hot water, and said, “You can crash on the couch tonight.”

Ivy went upstairs to fetch a blanket, returning to spread it over the couch. She even found him a pillow the right height, recalling that he often complained about neck pain.

Ethan held the warm cup, murmuring a soft “thanks,” his eyes glued to Ivy, as though he couldn’t believe he was here with her in this moment.

Feeling awkward, Ivy rummaged through her pockets, only to find that her jacket didn’t have any. She hightailed it back upstairs, leaving Ethan staring after her.

He wrapped himself in the blanket, feeling surprisingly comfortable for the first time in ages.

Knock! Knock! Knock!

Grace’s voice boomed from outside, “What on earth are you doing with the blanket on the couch?”

Ivy jolted awake, suddenly remembering Ethan was there. She scrambled out of bed and rushed downstairs.

The blanket was neatly folded on the couch, sitting innocently in one corner.

“I, um, was cold while watching TV,” Ivy stammered, trying to sound casual.

Grace raised an eyebrow, smirking. “Since when did you start making your bed?”

Ivy leaned against the couch, lazily replying, “People change, you know~”

The blanket still held a faint scent of Ethan’s unique woodsy cologne, and to her surprise, she found herself missing him a little.

Just then, Olivia Price stormed over, red-faced. Ivy glanced at her, puzzled as to what could’ve riled up normally easy-going Olivia.

“Remember that shipment of cabbage we ordered two days ago? Everyone's complaining that half of it was rotting!” 

Ivy dropped her fork, confusion washing over her. “But we checked it all before we bought it, right?”

Olivia slammed her hand on the table, fuming. “They just pulled the good ones out to show us and sent the rotten ones!”
