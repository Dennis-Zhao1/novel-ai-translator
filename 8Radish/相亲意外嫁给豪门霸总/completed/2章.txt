**Blind Date**

The car drove away from the bustling downtown area and onto a quiet little road lined with towering evergreen trees. Ivy Gonzalez sat in the passenger seat, feeling a sense of déjà vu as they pulled up to a charming, old-fashioned restaurant. The intricate, carved windows of the building reminded her of a place she had stumbled upon before.

Last time, the door had been firmly shut, and when she had knocked, a rather frosty individual had opened it just long enough to inform her, "We’re a private dining establishment, not open to the public," before slamming the door shut. Seeing Ethan Clark’s casual familiarity with the staff made it clear that he must be a regular here.

Ethan walked up to the host and exchanged a few words. Turning to Ivy, he asked, "Aside from your seafood allergy, is there anything else you can’t eat?" 

Ivy shook her head. 

As the dishes began to arrive, Ethan introduced them one by one, as if presenting his prized collectibles. To Ivy, they were just meals—she wasn’t particularly picky about food. But the earnestness on Ethan’s face was hard to resist, and she couldn’t help but let out a small laugh.

Ethan raised an eyebrow, puzzled by her lack of enthusiastic compliments. He was used to having people shower him with praise for his impeccable taste. But Ivy, ever the straightforward type, simply replied with a casual "Oh~."

He sighed, stifling his disappointment. "Alright, let’s dig in!" he said, clearly eager to see her reaction.

Every time Ivy took a bite, Ethan scrutinized her expression, searching for signs of approval. Unfortunately for him, Ivy was simply enjoying her meal without the theatrics he was hoping for. She had to admit, though, it was way better than what she normally ate—she just wasn’t going to make a big deal out of it.

"Delicious!" Ivy finally said to appease him, and his face lit up like a kid on Christmas morning. 

But just as Ivy started to really enjoy her meal, her phone rang with an unfamiliar number. A sense of dread washed over her as she picked it up. 

"Ivy, it’s about your mother, Grace Peterson... she’s been in an accident and is being rushed to the hospital..."

Panic surged through Ivy. She dropped her bag and bolted out of the restaurant, Ethan right on her heels, sensing that something serious had happened. 

Standing at the entrance, Ivy realized in horror that she hadn’t driven herself there. The restaurant was in a secluded area, and there were hardly any taxis around.

Tears streamed down her face as she frantically looked around. Just then, Ethan pulled up in front of her, rolling down the window, urging her to get in.

Ivy felt like she was on a rollercoaster, her heart racing. She clutched her seatbelt as she remembered her mother’s smile—she couldn’t lose Grace. She had told her mom earlier not to drive today, but her mother loved to go out during holidays, and now this... 

The traffic was a nightmare. Cars were barely moving, and Ivy’s anxiety skyrocketed. She glanced at Ethan, who was gripping the steering wheel tightly, but his eyes kept darting to her, worry etched on his face.

"I need to get out! Let me out!" Ivy shouted, her voice breaking.

"Ivy, just hold on. We’ll be there soon!" Ethan tried to reassure her, but she was beyond listening. 

Finally, he relented and pulled over to the side of the road. Ivy flung the door open and sprinted toward the hospital, her heart pounding with every step. Thankfully, she had worn comfortable sneakers instead of those impractical heels.

As she rushed through the hospital doors, Ivy’s breath came in ragged gasps. She stumbled to the reception desk, her voice trembling as she asked for her mother. The nurse, seeing her distress, quickly took charge and led Ivy down the sterile corridors, the sounds of hurried footsteps and cries echoing around her.

When they approached the emergency room, Ivy froze. As she took deep breaths, bracing herself, memories of her father flooded her mind. He had passed away when she was just ten years old. The thought of losing her mother too felt unbearable.

Tears spilled from her eyes again, and she barely noticed Ethan had followed her inside, standing a few feet away, his expression a mix of concern and helplessness. 

He set down a few water bottles next to her, maintaining a respectful distance as he sat quietly, offering his presence as comfort. 

After what felt like an eternity, Ethan finally broke the silence. "If you keep crying like this, you’re going to wear yourself out. Who will take care of your mom then?"

His calm voice cut through the haze of anxiety, and Ivy stopped crying, though her heart was still racing. 

She pulled out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter from her bag, fumbling with them in a daze. Lighting one, she took a long drag, the smoke curling up into the air before dissipating. For a moment, it felt like a small release.

Ethan watched her, a frown creasing his forehead. He reached for one of the water bottles, holding it beneath her cigarette to catch the ash falling from it.

Finally, Ivy murmured, "You should go home, Mr. Clark. I’ll be fine on my own."

As she snuffed out the cigarette in the water, she met his gaze, her eyes filled with defiance. “We just met today. You don’t have to do this.”

Ethan tilted his head slightly, his voice steady, "I believe we're going to get married someday."

Ivy blinked, the absurdity of the statement cutting through her distress. "What?!" she exclaimed, half-laughing, half-crying. 

But in that moment of chaos, she realized something. Maybe, just maybe, having someone like Ethan around wouldn’t be so terrible after all. Even if their first date had been interrupted in the worst way possible.
