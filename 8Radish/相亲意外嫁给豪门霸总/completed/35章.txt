### Scaredy Cat

Ivy Gonzalez couldn't shake off Sophia Bennett’s words from her mind. Did Ethan Clark really not know who he was dealing with? Her heart raced as she recalled Sophia's serious tone, leaving Ivy in a daze throughout her live stream. Even after signing off, she felt like she was floating through the rest of her day, lost in thought.

It wasn’t until her boss, Mr. Wu, breezed into the office that Ivy snapped back to reality. She had only met him once before, and boy, did he know how to make an entrance. With a smile so wide it could probably swallow a fly, he scanned the room and landed his gaze on Ivy. She plastered on a polite smile, pretending to be engrossed in the work of her fellow employees.

Then, in a move that made Ivy cringe, he sidled up next to her and threw an arm around her shoulder—his hand lingering just a moment too long. Ivy recoiled, a shiver running down her spine like she had just touched ice. She was about to make a break for it when Mr. Wu called out her name.

“Ivy Gonzalez, you're a gem for this company!” he exclaimed, plopping down into a chair and bouncing his leg like he was on a sugar high. 

Ivy rolled her eyes internally, but kept her face neutral. “Oh, I’m just doing my job,” she replied, forcing a smile.

“Guess what? The TE brand specifically requested you for their ad!” he announced, his excitement palpable.

Ivy’s jaw dropped. TE was a huge international brand that usually snagged A-list celebs. For them to come knocking on her door felt unreal. The staff, who had been wrapping up their tasks, paused in disbelief, exchanging glances as if they had misheard.

“Next week, you’ll start shooting—make sure you coordinate well with them!” Mr. Wu continued, clearly relishing the moment.

Ivy blinked, trying to comprehend. She wasn’t just a small-time streamer; this was a big deal! But she had always been the kind of person to stay grounded, and the sudden turn of events felt like a dream, too good to be true.

Once home, Ivy decided to snap out of it by binge-watching a horror movie. She flipped through the options until she found something that claimed to be the scariest film of the year. Perfect.

She dimmed the lights, closed the curtains, and settled into her couch, ready for an immersive experience that would distract her from all the craziness of her day.

At 2 AM, the eerie sounds of the movie filled her dimly lit living room when Ethan Clark finally returned home from his late shift. He had been working extra hours lately, and as usual, he glanced up at Ivy’s window, noticing it was dark. Was she already asleep?

Cautiously, he opened the door, and a blood-curdling scream pierced the air, causing him to jump. On screen, a monstrous face leered at him. He froze, heart racing, not daring to move an inch closer. What was going on here?

He quickly fumbled around for the light switch, relief flooding over him when the entire room illuminated. He blinked at the sudden brightness, finally taking in the sight of Ivy, who was equally startled and recovering from her own fright.

“Hey! What’s going on?” she exclaimed, her heart racing.

“Uh, I wasn’t scared!” Ethan blurted out, trying to regain his dignity. 

“Sure, buddy. Is that why you screamed?” Ivy teased, raising an eyebrow.

“I didn’t scream!” he insisted, crossing his arms defensively.

Ivy couldn’t help but laugh. “So, should I turn off the lights again?”

“Go for it,” he replied, sounding completely unbothered. 

With a mischievous grin, Ivy flipped off all the lights, leaving them in darkness save for the flickering glow of the TV. Ethan’s palms instinctively clenched at his sides; he hated the dark. The movie resumed, and Ivy could sense his unease.

She moved back to the couch, her heart racing not just from fear but from being so close to him. As she sat down, she felt his presence beside her, and the air was thick with something she couldn’t quite place.

Ethan, trying to act cool, sat beside her, his eyes glued to the screen. But Ivy could smell the fresh orange-scented soap he had used, and it was both comforting and disarming.

“Why are you staring at me?” Ivy asked, trying to sound casual.

“I’m not staring,” he shot back, his cheeks tinged with color.

“Then what’s with the intense gaze?” she pressed, grinning.

“Because you look good,” he admitted, the words tumbling out before he could stop them.

“Smooth talker!” Ivy laughed, batting his hand away when he tried to pat her back in faux sympathy.

Ethan snatched some chips from her bowl, munching quietly as the horror unfolded on screen. Ivy noticed he was definitely more scared than he was letting on.

Seizing the opportunity, Ivy decided to have a bit of fun. As the movie reached a tense climax, she stretched and crept behind him. With a swift move, she wrapped her arms around his neck and forced him to look at the screen just as a terrifying scene unfolded.

Ethan yelped, jumping a mile high as he realized he had been caught off guard. “You little sneak!” he exclaimed, trying to regain his composure.

Ivy burst out laughing, “But you said you weren’t scared!” 

Ethan shot her a glare that was half-hearted, a reluctant smile breaking through. “Okay, you got me,” he admitted, trying to hide his embarrassment.

Ivy relished the moment, enjoying every second of teasing him. This was going to be one memorable night.
