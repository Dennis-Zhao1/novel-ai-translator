**The Ring**

Ivy Gonzalez stood there, patiently waiting for Ethan Clark to finish admiring the ring. It was a little too snug for her taste, but Ethan was insistent that she wear it. 

Ivy felt a mix of confusion and warmth as she tightened her grip on her right hand. This ring was a surprise Ethan bought while on a trip with his buddy Noah Scott, originally intended to be a proposal token. But, well, life had other plans, and he didn’t quite get the chance to pop the question.

The ring was adorned with a dazzling sapphire, catching the sunlight and sparkling like it was auditioning for a role in a jewelry commercial. Ivy could feel her heart flutter a bit as she watched Ethan's tousled hair fall into his brows, looking all kinds of charming. 

When he suddenly glanced up and their eyes met, Ivy’s heart skipped a beat, and she quickly looked away, feeling flustered. Ethan, completely oblivious to her reaction, mused, “You can’t get married without a ring.”

It felt like ages before he finally let go of her hand. Ivy was in a mild panic; now she had an unexpected ring on her finger, and it felt awkward. She shoved her hand into her pocket, absentmindedly rubbing the ring, trying to get used to its presence.

“What’s up with you? You look all flustered!” Ivy’s friend Sophia chimed in, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

Ivy had always been a bit blunt, quick to shoot off a comment, but inside, she was like a flower blooming, excited and giddy. 

As they headed back to Grace Peterson’s hospital room, Ivy suddenly stopped at the door, scrutinizing the ring again, contemplating whether to take it off. But it was stuck. She pulled and twisted, but it wouldn’t budge, and her fingers were starting to turn red. Defeated, she sighed and thought, “Guess it’s here to stay for now.”

When Grace saw Ivy return alone, she frowned. “Where’s Ethan?”

Lately, Grace had been warming up to Ethan—he was charming, polite, and had a way with words. She hoped Ivy would hit it off with him. But seeing Ivy’s cool demeanor only worried her more.

“Just saving my breath!” Ivy teased, feeling drained after a long day and a quick dash to check on Ethan.

Grace’s eyes narrowed, noticing that Ivy’s slender fingers now sported a ring that looked pretty pricey. “What’s with the ring?” 

Ivy figured she might as well spill the beans. She held her hand up for her mom to see and said, “Ethan and I got married. This is the ring.”

Grace’s calm demeanor vanished in an instant. Sure, she wanted Ivy to find a good guy, but this felt rushed. She hadn’t even met Ethan’s family! “Are you serious?”

Ivy couldn’t help but smile at her mom’s shocked expression. “Yep! I’m married now, so you can stop worrying about me.”

Just then, her phone buzzed with a message. She stepped outside, glancing at the screen. It was Ethan. 

“There’s a nurse coming tomorrow,” his deep voice came through the line.

“Wait, what?” Ivy replied, caught off guard.

“I have to do something. After all, she’s my mother-in-law now,” he chuckled.

That reasoning was a bit shaky yet oddly sweet. Ivy had looked into hiring a nurse before, but it was pricey, and her mom was going to be in the hospital for a while, which meant a hefty bill.

After some back-and-forth, she accepted his offer. “Thanks for everything. I really appreciate it.”

Ethan stared at his phone after she hung up, a storm of thoughts swirling in his mind. He tossed the phone on the couch and reached for a pack of cigarettes he had bought earlier.

He had noticed Ivy smoked that brand, so he figured he’d give it a try. He lit one, took a puff, and immediately started coughing, tears streaming down his face. “How does she do this?” he thought, disgusted, before tossing the cigarette down the toilet. He was determined to get Ivy to quit; that wasn’t the image he had of her.

Ivy returned to the room and pulled out a small notebook from her bag, where she kept track of everything she owed Ethan. Now, she had to add the cost of the nurse to the list.

“Just so you know, there’s a nurse coming tomorrow to help you. I’ve got to get back to work,” Ivy told Grace, who was resting with her eyes closed.

Grace nodded, and Ivy turned off the lights, slipping into the hospital garden. The night air was cooler, with the earthy scent of grass and soil filling her lungs.

She settled on a bench, taking a moment to enjoy a cigarette, the ember glowing like a firefly in the dark. Feeling a bit more relaxed, she stretched her legs out and leaned back, taking in the night sky.

“Mind if I borrow a light?” a voice floated down from above her.

Ivy looked up to see a guy with gold-rimmed glasses. She fished out her lighter and handed it to him. He flicked it on, and the flame danced in the reflection of his glasses, creating a whimsical glow.

After lighting his smoke, the guy, Sophia Bennett, didn’t leave; instead, he plopped down beside her. Ivy noticed he was still in his hospital gown and had an IV drip in his arm.

“Hey, you shouldn’t be smoking if you’re sick,” she warned.

Sophia chuckled, revealing a charming dimple. “You’re the first person to care about me after my surgery.”

Ivy rolled her eyes, flicking the ash from her cigarette. “Nurses and doctors are people too, you know. They care more than I do.”

Sophia laughed again, a genuine sound that warmed the air between them. “Touché.”

They fell into a comfortable silence, gazing at the inky sky, sharing a moment as they let their cigarettes burn down to the very end.
