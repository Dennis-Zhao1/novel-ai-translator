**Not Worth My Trouble**

Ivy Gonzalez was having the best day ever—well, at least it was about to be the best day ever, as long as she could get out of this hospital bed. After lying around for what felt like forever, she was itching to breathe in some fresh air, especially with that salty sea breeze wafting through the window.

“I want to leave,” Ivy pleaded, tugging at Ethan Clark’s arm like a toddler who wanted ice cream.

Ethan shook his head, “No way, you don’t look too great.”

Ivy wasn’t having any of that; today was their last day here, and she was not going to spend it cooped up in a hospital gown. With a determined flick, she yanked the IV needle out of her hand and scrambled onto Ethan’s back. “You’re carrying me out, let’s go!”

“Whoa, I didn’t know you had this feisty side!” Ethan chuckled, adjusting her weight as he hoisted her up.

They strolled outside, Ivy giggling at the absurdity of the situation. The sun was blazing down, and the sky was so blue it looked like someone had spilled paint all over it. She shielded her eyes and leaned her cheek against Ethan’s neck, feeling the warmth radiate from him. “I really don’t want to leave.”

Ethan glanced at her, his face lit up by the sun, and said softly, “We’ll come back every year.”

Ivy wasn’t sure if they’d really make it back, but in that moment, his promise made her feel warm and fuzzy inside. She wrapped her arms around his shoulders and playfully ruffled his hair. 

“Stop it! You’re making me look like a puppy!” Ethan feigned exasperation, but he was grinning.

As they walked past a nearby church, they heard laughter and music. Curious, Ivy nudged Ethan and pointed; they peeked inside just in time to see a couple exchanging vows. Her heart swelled with envy.

Now, that was the kind of wedding she had always dreamed of—surrounded by family and friends, sharing heartfelt promises. It was supposed to be serious yet joyous, and when the couple exchanged rings, Ivy felt a pang of longing.

She shook her head, reminding herself that expecting such things was futile. As they slipped away from the wedding, an unspoken agreement hung in the air between them, like an old wound that always seemed to throb just beneath the surface.

Back at their rental, Ivy’s phone buzzed with a call from her friend, Daisy.

“Where are you?” Daisy asked, sounding frantic. “And where’s Ethan?”

Ivy raised an eyebrow, surprised. Daisy never cared about Ethan. “What’s going on?”

There was a pause on the other end, and Ivy could almost hear Daisy gathering her thoughts. “Uh, Liam Harris got arrested.”

“Wait, what?” Ivy’s heart raced. “Liam? No way, he’s not the type to get caught up in something like that!”

“His dad’s company got reported for some shady stuff, and Liam’s the first one in line,” Daisy explained.

Ivy’s mind whirled back to a conversation Daisy had once had about Liam being a total idiot. “Daisy,” Ivy said slowly, “are you saying Ethan had something to do with this?”

Daisy hesitated, and Ivy could hear her take a deep breath. “I... I’m not sure. I thought maybe Ethan was behind it.”

“Wait, what?” Ivy was fuming now. “You think Ethan would do something like that? He wouldn’t!”

As she paced the room, pulling her hair in frustration, she knocked on Ethan’s door several times, but there was no answer. Just when she was about to give up, the door swung open.

Ethan stood there, half-drenched and looking like a model who just stepped out of a shower. Water trickled down his neck, and Ivy suddenly felt embarrassed.

“Oh, um, I didn’t mean to interrupt. I’ll just—” She turned to leave, but Ethan leaned against the doorframe, his expression playful yet serious.

“Wait, come in. You’re here now,” he said, motioning her inside.

She stepped in, her heart racing. “So, uh, how was the shower? Was the water... hot?” She wanted to slap herself for such a lame question.

Ethan chuckled, his tone light. “Yeah, it’s the temperature you like. You always crank it up a little higher.”

Ivy felt her cheeks heat up. Watching him get dressed was awkward enough, and now she was fumbling over words. After a moment, he asked, “Want a midnight snack? I can run down and grab something.”

“No, that’s okay,” she said, steeling herself, then boldly grabbed his arm. His skin was warm and smooth, and she took a deep breath. “Did you hear about Liam getting arrested?”

Ethan raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”

“Do you know?” Ivy pressed. “Are you aware of what’s going on?”

He shrugged, pulling a shirt over his head. “How would I know?”

“Don’t play dumb with me!” Ivy snapped, feeling the tension rise. “This is serious!”

Ethan’s playful demeanor shifted, and for the first time, he looked annoyed. “You care about him a lot, don’t you?”

Ivy was taken aback. “Of course I care! He’s my friend!”

“Friend?” Ethan scoffed, tossing the towel off his shoulder. “What kind of ‘friend’ spends a week at your place, celebrates holidays with you, and bakes you treats?”

Ivy crossed her arms, her heart pounding. “You’re really going to act like this? So what, you think it’s okay to just throw him under the bus?”

Ethan’s expression turned incredulous, his patience wearing thin. “For Liam Harris? You’re seriously going to argue with me over him?”

Ivy couldn’t believe it. “You think I’m overreacting? He’s in trouble, and you’re acting like it doesn’t matter!”

Ethan’s laughter rang out, but it was cold. “He doesn’t deserve my help.”

And in that moment, Ivy realized just how deep the divide between them had grown—over a guy she thought was a friend, and a guy who felt all too much like a rival.
