**Two Faces**

The ceiling light flickered on and off, finally lighting up the room. Ethan Clark stepped down from the stool, holding a replaced light bulb in one hand. He wore a black shirt with the sleeves rolled up, his gaze soft as he looked at Ivy Gonzalez. 

Was Ivy just too easy to captivate, or did Ethan just have a knack for reading people's hearts? Ivy couldn't quite figure it out.

She stared at him, her mind racing. It was just a light bulb change, after all. Maybe the light was too harsh, causing her eyes to sting. Ivy set down her luggage and walked step by step toward him.

She reached up and switched off the light behind Ethan.

The room plunged back into darkness.

"Ivy?" Ethan's voice came out a bit deeper, likely due to a lingering cold. "What's wrong?"

Just then, someone darted into his arms.

Ivy clung tightly to his narrow waist, her fingers digging into his back, her face pressed against his chest. She didn’t want to respond to anything he said; all she could feel was how ridiculous and vulnerable she was being in that moment.

Ethan stiffened, a wave of joy and surprise washing over him. He wanted to embrace her back tightly—after all, it had been way too long since Ivy had initiated a hug. But his hands were dirty holding the broken light bulb, so he could only open his arms wide.

"Alright." Ivy suddenly let go of him, creating some distance. The emotional moment made her feel a bit irrational. She sniffled lightly, “You can go now.”

Ethan looked confused. Wasn’t that unexpected hug an acceptance of his feelings? This ambiguous situation left him feeling uneasy.

He set the broken bulb down, wanting to stay. “Are you hungry? I can cook some noodles for you. It’s too lonely here, so I brought some food.”

If this kept up, Ivy would really lose control. She didn’t want to do something she’d regret the next day.

She rushed forward, snatching the pot from Ethan’s hands. “Let’s go for a walk,” she said, pushing him toward the door, her impatience showing. “You just cause me trouble by being here.”

*Bam!*

The door finally slammed shut, leaving Ethan on the other side.

Ivy leaned against the door, staring down at the floor. It was clean. As she glanced around the room, she noticed everything had been tidied up in advance—he even replaced the kitchenware and stocked the fridge. She stood in front of the fridge, feeling utterly foolish.

Ivy mentally reassured herself, This is all his doing. He asked for it!

After tidying up, Ivy sat in the living room, bored out of her mind. She decided to go live on her phone.

The sudden livestream took her fans by surprise; they thought Ivy would be in a slump due to some gossip, like before.

[So lucky! Glad I didn’t sleep!]
[Are you selling anything today?]
[So pretty! This is without makeup!]

This time, Ivy hadn’t prepared anything and just wanted to chat casually. But suddenly, she accidentally hit a button, and the livestream split into two screens, showing a PK battle with someone else.

The internet connection wasn’t stable, so Ivy only saw a frozen image on the other side—no sign of life.

After a moment, a figure appeared on the screen.

Ivy nearly threw her phone out the window. What the heck?! How could it be him?!

When did Ethan start doing livestreams? The profile picture looked familiar, like someone who frequently topped the fan rankings. Her expression turned complex.

Meanwhile, the viewers were going wild.

Where could you find such a handsome real-life couple, broadcasting their love late at night to fans?

The chat exploded with [Ahhhh!]

Ivy was losing her cool. The man who had never acknowledged their marriage was now here, and she could only pretend not to know him.

She couldn’t show a sour face, either; she had tons of fans to maintain, and they were her bread and butter.

Ivy flashed a sweet smile. “Hubby… what a surprise! How come it’s you?”

Ethan struggled to suppress a laugh. So that was her weakness? Why hadn’t he figured it out sooner?

With a teasing smile, he asked, “Do you like it?”

Ivy pinched her thigh, keeping her smile in place. “Yeah! You’re still working, right? I won’t disturb you and the fans.”

Ethan propped his chin in his hand, gazing at her through the screen. “Not a disturbance; the fans love it.”

The fans were now on cloud nine!!

Who needed fake couples when real ones were giving out sweet moments like candy? 

Ivy's viewer count skyrocketed to the top, and the chat was a flurry of comments, making her head spin.

One fan kept spamming [Show some love!]

Ivy rolled her eyes. How cheesy! Why were people so obsessed with love signs now? She just didn’t get it.

With a smile, she did a heart gesture. “Love you guys!”

Then more fans yelled [Do it together!]

Ivy’s inner monologue: Oh my god.

Sweetly, she replied, “He doesn’t know how to do that; he can’t manage it.”

At that moment, Ethan had already formed half a heart gesture and held it at the edge of the screen, waiting for Ivy to join in.

Ivy furrowed her brow, confused about what he was doing. She reluctantly mirrored his gesture.

She thought it should end there, but the fans’ enthusiasm skyrocketed. Someone kept insisting, [Let’s sing together.]

At first, it was just a few voices, but soon more and more fans were demanding Ivy and Ethan to sing.

Ivy wanted to refuse; she had never heard Ethan sing before, and if he was tone-deaf, it would be a disaster. Who would want to ruin their reputation like that? 

After all, Ivy had gained some popularity from singing, “He doesn’t really—”

Ethan had already chosen a song. “How about this one?”

Ivy was caught off guard and replied, “Sure, sure,” only to regret it afterward.

It was a song she had sung with Sophia Bennett at a New Year’s party, and now Ethan had picked it on purpose.

The intro started, and there was no turning back.

Ivy began singing, but when it was Ethan’s turn, her heart raced. She was terrified he would mess up and face the wrath of fans. She was used to criticism, but Ethan wasn’t—she didn’t want him to experience that.

But Ethan’s voice was unexpectedly good—steady and in tune, every note perfectly delivered.

Ivy stared at him in shock, her heart racing like a fish flopping out of water, its tail slapping against her chest.

When the last note faded, the comments flooded in, praising his voice.

Ivy felt relieved; she couldn’t continue the livestream anymore. She was on the brink of losing her cool.

She quickly signed off.

As soon as the livestream ended, Ethan called her.

Ivy answered coldly, “What’s up?”

Ethan chuckled, “What happened to the two-faced act? You were calling me ‘hubby’ just a moment ago.”
