**Title: Love and Consequences in the City**

Sophia Bennett couldn’t believe her eyes when she spotted Ethan Clark at the local bar. It had been ages since Ivy Gonzalez had graced them with her singing, and seeing Ethan alone was a surprise. “Hey, look who it is! Mr. Clark himself!” she chimed, leaning casually against the bar, glass in hand.

Next to her, Lily Young, the HR rep from Ethan’s company, was quick to poke her head out and greet him. Ethan shot them both a glance that could freeze fire, his expression colder than a snowstorm. “Charming,” he muttered, making poor Lily shrink back in her seat.

Sophia knew there was trouble brewing. She had heard through the grapevine that Ethan was onto Lily for leaking interview information about Ivy to the tabloids. The last thing Ethan wanted was an unprofessional employee, and tonight, he seemed ready to bring the hammer down.

“Why’d you do it?” he asked Sophia, his tone sharp enough to cut glass. He had pieced together that Sophia had passed Ivy’s interview details to some gossip channels, and he wasn’t having it. Ivy’s reputation was now on the line, and Ethan was furious. 

Sophia blinked, taken aback. “I didn’t think you’d find out so quickly!” she stammered, realizing she had underestimated his ability to connect the dots. 

Ethan’s lips curled into a cruel smile. “She’s got a lot of nerve turning me down,” he spat, clearly not ready to let this go.

And just like that, the tension snapped. Sophia, feeling bold, shot back, “Who says Ivy is yours to claim?” 

Before anyone could react, Sophia felt a fist connect with her cheek, sending her crashing against the bar. The noise drew the attention of patrons nearby, and the usually composed Emma Ward nearly spilled her drink in shock. 

As Sophia struggled to rise, wiping blood from her mouth, she stood defiantly. “What right do you have to think you own Ivy and Noah Scott?” she roared. The crowd fell silent, jaws dropping at the sight of their usually friendly boss transformed into a fierce warrior.

Ethan was seething, fury radiating off him as he stared down at her, ready to throw another punch. But before he could, security swooped in and pulled him away. 

Sophia straightened her clothes, trying to contain a chuckle. “Wow, Mr. Clark, look at you, being all restrained and stuff. Don’t hurt yourself!” 

As if on cue, the police arrived, flashing lights cutting through the bar’s dim ambiance. Ethan and his crew were escorted out, while Emma, still in a daze, hurried to call Ivy with the latest updates.

Sophia watched Ethan being led away, a mix of satisfaction and disbelief washing over her. Maybe she had crossed a line, but in a city where love and jealousy intertwined like a tangled web, sometimes you had to stir the pot to find the truth.

And in that moment, amidst the chaos, Sophia realized that the battle for Ivy's heart was just beginning—and she was ready to fight.
