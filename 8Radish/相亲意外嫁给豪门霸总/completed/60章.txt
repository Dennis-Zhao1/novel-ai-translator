**Love and Indifference: A Winter Story**

Ivy Gonzalez drove all night to her hometown, feeling more than a little frostbitten. Just as the clock struck midnight, a loud knock at the door jolted her mother, Grace Peterson, awake. 

“Who’s there?” Grace shouted from inside, still half-asleep.

“It’s me,” came Ivy’s muffled voice.

Recognizing her daughter, Grace swung the door open. Ivy stood there, cheeks flushed from the cold, dragging her suitcase behind her. 

“What’s wrong?” Grace’s eyes narrowed, noticing Ivy's sadness.

“It’s over,” Ivy said coldly, her voice thick with emotion. “He never treated me like a wife…”

As the words spilled out, the tears followed. Grace, usually strong and composed, felt her heart ache for her daughter. She wiped Ivy's tears away and pulled her into a comforting hug. “It's okay, sweetie. You’ve got your mom here. If it’s not meant to be, then it’s not meant to be.”

With that, Ivy cried until she was out of tears, convinced that once the tears dried, so would her heartache.

The next morning, Ivy woke up with puffy eyes that looked like walnuts. Dressed in her big puffy coat, she stood at the door staring blankly at the snow-covered yard. It was rare for their Southern town to see snow this heavy.

“Wow, look at this snow,” Grace mused, rubbing her hands together. “I haven’t seen this much since I was a kid.” She shivered, pulling her coat tighter.

Bored out of her mind, Ivy decided to visit her friend, Olivia Price. Grace mentioned that Olivia had moved back home after her divorce, bringing her child with her and living in the house her parents left behind.

When Ivy arrived, she found Olivia’s little one sitting on a tiny stool, babbling away while playing with toys. Olivia herself was focused on her computer, seemingly working on something important.

“Hey, sit down! I’ll get you some hot tea,” Olivia said, jumping up to greet Ivy warmly.

Ivy wrapped her hands around the steaming mug, feeling its warmth seep into her cold fingers. 

“I heard from your mom that you’re married now?” Olivia asked, peering at her with a curious smile.

Ivy shrugged, replying with a noncommittal “yeah.” She didn’t want to delve into that story. Instead, she knelt down to play with Olivia’s child, who giggled as Ivy tickled their cheek.

Olivia beamed as she watched her child, but soon her expression turned serious. “I’m just trying to help the folks in the village sell their crops online,” she sighed, gesturing to her computer. “This snow is ruining everything; most of their produce is rotting in the fields. I thought maybe I could help them out.”

Ivy glanced at the screen and noticed that they’d only sold two or three items all day. “That’s tough,” she said, feeling the weight of the situation.

Just then, Olivia’s phone buzzed. It was a call from Grace. 

“Did you forget your phone?” Olivia asked Ivy, then answered the call. “What’s going on?” she asked, suddenly serious.

“Ethan Clark just showed up,” Grace whispered, sounding anxious. “I sent him packing with a broom! He’s gone now.”

Ivy nodded, processing the information. “Got it.”

“Hey, do you have a telescope?” Ivy asked Olivia suddenly.

“Actually, I do! The little one used to play with it all the time,” Olivia replied.

“Kiddo, go grab your telescope!” she called to the child, who jumped up excitedly and rummaged through a corner until they found it.

With telescope in hand, Ivy rushed to the rooftop, aiming it toward her house. After scanning the area, she finally spotted a familiar figure—Ethan Clark, standing just a few meters from her front door, dressed head-to-toe in black against the white snow.

“What’s he doing here?” Ivy thought, annoyed. “Is he coming to apologize? As if that would change anything.”

When she looked again through the telescope, he was already driving away, seemingly embarrassed to show his face.

Ethan couldn’t even fathom why he thought coming back would help. Driving all that way just to get scolded? He sped off, heading back to the lavish villa he hadn’t visited in ages—the place where he once proposed to Noah Scott.

Inside, the villa was as pristine as ever, thanks to the cleaning staff. He poured himself a drink at the mini bar, drowning his sorrows one glass at a time, hoping to forget his troubles.

Meanwhile, Jason Brooks, his assistant, wondered why Ethan wasn’t staying at his new apartment and instead returned to the villa. He picked Ethan up for work, noticing the unmistakable smell of alcohol clinging to his boss.

Once at the office, Ethan chugged a strong cup of coffee, bloodshot eyes barely staying open during the meeting. 

“Dude, you’re going to kill yourself at this rate,” James Miller cautioned him during a break.

Ethan just shrugged, opening his notebook with a tired grin. “One day at a time, right?”

His coworkers avoided him like the plague, fearing his temper. Seeing him approach was like seeing a storm cloud rolling in—everyone braced for the worst.

After one particularly tense meeting, someone whispered to James, “What’s up with the boss?”

James just tapped his head knowingly. “He pays you, not for gossip.”

Meanwhile, Emma Ward, a waitress at the local bar, watched Ethan stumble in one night. “What’s with him? He’s here more often than ever,” she remarked to herself, noticing he wasn’t alone this time—there was a woman with him.

She casually strolled over, pretending to serve other customers while casting glances at the pair. The woman slightly resembled Ivy, but wasn’t nearly as charming. Emma snapped a photo and sent it to Ivy, but there was no response. It was as if Ivy had vanished.

Frustrated, Emma banged the table, mentally screaming, “This is not good!”

Seeing Ethan getting increasingly drunk, she rushed outside to find Jason. “You need to take him home!”

As they left, Ethan muttered, “There are plenty of women out there who look just like her…”

Back at Olivia’s house, Ivy let out a big sneeze. 

“Are you cold?” Olivia asked, half-joking.

“Maybe it’s just the weather,” Ivy laughed. 

She found herself returning to Olivia’s place again and again, often climbing up to the rooftop with the telescope. Olivia couldn’t help but ask what she was looking for.

“Oh, just the mountains,” Ivy replied, her smile a little too bright. “They look beautiful covered in snow.”

Ethan never came back after that. In the end, Ivy realized that love and indifference were just two sides of the same coin. She shrugged it off, content to spend time playing with Olivia’s child, letting the world go on without her.
