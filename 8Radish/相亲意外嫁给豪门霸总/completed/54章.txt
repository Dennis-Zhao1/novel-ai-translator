**Title: New Year’s Revelations**

Ivy Gonzalez sat in the passenger seat, glancing over at Ethan Clark as he drove. The phrase “young and early marriage” echoed in her mind, courtesy of Liam Harris. It was a strange thought, especially when you looked at someone like Ethan—always surrounded by admirers but deciding to tie the knot young with someone who didn’t quite match his status. 

As the car came to a stop at a red light, Ivy turned to him with a playful smile. “So, Ethan, what made you choose to marry me?” 

“What?!” Ethan’s eyes widened in surprise, clearly not expecting that question.

Ivy chuckled lightly, brushing off the moment with a casual, “Oh, never mind,” and letting the awkwardness fade. She had been too scared to ask him before, but now she found herself relieved to be keeping things light—after all, they were both into each other, right? 

But as New Year’s Eve rolled around, Ethan still hadn’t suggested spending it together. This was their first New Year as a married couple, and it seemed a little odd. So, Ivy decided to hang out with her friend, Daisy, instead.

As they drove into the city center, the streets were alive with decorations and festive cheer. Ivy’s old clunker of a car stood out among the shiny luxury vehicles parked outside the swanky hotel where Daisy was throwing her New Year’s bash. She stepped out, smoothing down her white dress and gazing up at the grand hotel, which looked like it had popped right out of a fairy tale.

The party was on the third floor, and as Ivy approached, a cheerful hostess guided her up the staircase, which sparkled with tiny lights. The decor inside was even more extravagant than she imagined, with a glow of candlelight and opulent red drapes framing the giant windows. A small stage in the middle was set for performances, and long tables lined the sides, beautifully arranged with plates and cutlery, all shimmering in the candlelight.

Ivy was taken aback by the sheer number of Daisy's friends—there were so many good-looking people, including a handful of young singers and actors. It was no wonder that the curtains were tightly drawn. 

Daisy spotted Ivy and rushed over to exchange pleasantries before dashing off to greet other guests. Left to her own devices, Ivy grabbed a plate and filled it with fancy hors d'oeuvres, settling down at a table while sneaking glances at Daisy, who was dazzling in her crimson gown and ruby necklace.

Just then, a voice interrupted her thoughts. “Daisy invited you to make friends, not just eat,” Liam Harris said as he plopped down beside her, propping his chin on his hand and watching her nibble on her food.

Ivy shot him a glance, ignoring his comment and continuing to munch on her snack. 

“Hey!” Liam huffed, swiping her plate away. “I’m talking to you, show some manners!”

With nothing left to snack on, Ivy reluctantly set down her utensils, dabbed her mouth with a napkin, and pulled out her compact mirror to touch up her makeup, effectively dismissing him. The last thing she wanted was for a self-absorbed guy like Liam to think she had any interest in him.

“Seriously? You’re not even going to respond?” Liam raised an eyebrow, clearly unimpressed. “You’re not secretly into me, are you?”

Ivy nearly choked on her lipstick. How had Daisy’s friend turned into such an idiot? “I’m married, Liam. I’m not interested in other guys,” she replied, moving her chair even further away from him.

Liam took a sip of his wine and smirked. “No biggie! In this industry, people do what they want. It’s all about having fun.” He leaned closer, his tone teasing.

Ivy grimaced, standing up and making a beeline for the exit. The last thing she needed was to be caught in another scandal, especially with someone like Liam, who thrived on drama. 

Outside, the noise faded, and Ivy took a deep breath by the spiral staircase. She peered down at the bustling crowd on the second floor, where men in sharp suits and women in elegant gowns glided gracefully into the main hall. The place was lit up like a Christmas tree, featuring a massive crystal chandelier that sparkled like a million stars.

Suddenly, a commotion at the entrance caught her attention. People parted like the Red Sea, creating a path for someone of significance. Cameras flashed, and Ivy squinted to see who it was. 

There was Ethan, arm-in-arm with a stunning woman, laughing and chatting like they were the best of friends. Ivy’s stomach dropped. That woman was the same fan who had approached her the other day, and now here she was, right next to Ethan. 

“Is your new wife really that unremarkable?” Lucas Smith, the woman beside Ethan, teased him with a smile. 

It was an important event, and Ethan was with Lucas, flaunting their connection while Ivy stood silently, hidden away. 

Ethan kept his composure, leaning closer to Lucas and whispering, “We both know this is just for show. No need to take it seriously.” 

The rumor mill was already buzzing, claiming that the daughter of a prominent family was set on marrying Ethan, and if they joined forces, their combined business empire would be unstoppable. Just the whispers alone had driven stock prices up, making it clear that people were eager to cozy up to the two families. 

Lucas felt a sting at the mention of “show.” She attempted to pull her hand away, but Ethan tightened his grip, holding her hand firmly. 

“Don’t make a scene here,” he warned her, his smile bright but his eyes serious.

As Lucas waited for Ethan’s wife, Ivy, to make an appearance, she felt a pang of jealousy. All it took was a glance from Ethan for her to feel under his spell, and now, Ivy was nowhere to be seen. 

It was a night full of surprises, and Ivy had a feeling that the New Year was about to bring a whirlwind of changes.
