**Back to the Farm**

One chilly morning, Ivy Gonzalez stirred awake, shivering under her blankets. She had only snagged three hours of sleep, and her eyelids felt like lead weights. Rubbing the sleep from her eyes, she gathered her things and prepared to head out early to pick up her mom.

Grace Peterson was finally being discharged from the hospital. Ivy had decided to take her back to their rural hometown to recuperate. With her mom not able to do much around the house, Ivy planned to hire a caregiver to help take care of her daily needs. This meant Ivy’s paycheck would have to stretch a bit further than usual—covering the caregiver’s salary and her mom’s living expenses. Life was getting tighter by the month, and without Ethan Clark’s generous offer of a place to stay, things would be even tougher.

She tiptoed downstairs, careful not to wake Ethan, who was still snoozing on the couch. But when she reached the first floor, she was surprised to find the living room and kitchen brightly lit.

Ethan emerged from the kitchen, balancing two bowls of oatmeal, and set them down on the dining table. “I’m coming with you,” he said, arranging the chopsticks with precision before beckoning her over for breakfast.

Ivy raised an eyebrow, puzzled about how he knew she was heading back home. She sat down at the table but didn’t touch her chopsticks, waiting for him to elaborate.

“I visited your mom the other day, and she mentioned it,” Ethan replied with a knowing look, as if he could see straight through her.

Ivy couldn’t believe her mom had spilled the beans after she specifically told Grace not to mention anything. She considered refusing Ethan’s kindness, but he was having none of it.

“I just want to experience country living,” he said, and Ivy couldn’t help but roll her eyes. Country living? What was so great about it? If only she could experience the lavish lifestyle of the rich instead—now that would be something.

The drive from the city to Ivy’s hometown would take about two hours, and Ethan hadn’t driven that far in ages. Usually, it was Jason who handled the long trips. The transition from smooth asphalt to bumpy country roads was a challenge.

Ivy glanced back at her mom, who was peacefully snoozing in the backseat, then turned to Ethan, eyes wide. “Want to pull over and let me drive?”

The road was narrow, filled with potholes and sharp turns—definitely not easy for someone unfamiliar with it. She was trying to give him an out.

Ethan shook his head, his expression serious as he focused on the road. “I’m good,” he replied.

Ivy shrugged, exasperated by his stubbornness.

After what felt like an eternity, they finally arrived at her childhood home. It was a two-story house, built by her father when he got married. The place had seen better days; the paint was peeling, and the charm of yesteryears had faded.

Ivy stepped out of the car and stared at the house, memories flooding her mind. She barely remembered living there; her parents had moved when she was just two years old. It had been years since she last visited, and the house had remained empty since her father passed away.

Pulling an old key from her backpack, she attempted to unlock the door but struggled to get it to turn. After several frustrating attempts, she jogged back to the car. “Mom, is this the right key? It won’t open.”

Grace nodded, looking just as confused.

Ivy returned to the door and tried again, but before she could give it another go, a booming voice called from behind her. “Who are you guys?!”

Ivy turned in shock to see her cousin Oliver Wright, who she hadn’t seen in years. He was a couple of years younger and looked a lot chunkier than she remembered. 

“Oliver?” she exclaimed, trying to recognize him through the years. 

He squinted at her, then his expression softened a bit. “Ivy Gonzalez! Long time no see, huh?”

He ambled over, wearing flip-flops and acting as if he owned the place. Pulling a key from his pocket, he unlocked the door like it was his own home. 

“Wait, how do you have a key?” Ivy asked, astonished.

“Oh, we changed the locks ages ago. Mom said it was a waste to leave it empty. I’m living here now, and when I get married, I’ll fix it up and use it as a wedding house,” he said casually, plopping down on a chair as if he belonged there.

Ivy’s fists clenched so tightly her nails dug into her palms. “This was my dad’s house. You can’t just take it for your wedding!”

Ethan, who had been waiting in the car for a while, grew concerned when Ivy didn’t come out. He leaned back to Grace. “I’m going in to check on her, just stay put.”

Grace had seen Oliver approach and immediately sensed trouble. She insisted on following Ethan inside, but he urged her to stay in the car. “It’s going to be cramped in there. You two haven’t been back in a while—better to wait here until Ivy and I sort this out.”

Once Ethan stepped inside, the tension was palpable. Ivy stood tall, glaring at Oliver, who had the audacity to claim her childhood home as his own.

Ethan walked over to Ivy and gently took her hand, offering silent support. Ivy looked up into his eyes, her fierce demeanor softening as she squeezed his hand tightly.

Oliver smirked, sizing Ethan up. “So, you’re her boyfriend? Nice catch. But don’t get too comfortable; this old house is mine now,” he said, leaning back with a cocky grin.

That was the last straw for Ethan. He couldn’t hold back. “You really think you can just take what’s not yours?” he interjected, stepping closer to confront Oliver.

Ivy, sensing the tension, grabbed Ethan’s arm and pulled him behind her, her grip firm. “You think you can just claim this place? Not a chance! You need to move out, today!”
