**Title: The Family Business**

Ivy Gonzalez leaned back in her chair, pondering a dilemma that felt all too familiar. "How about we let the customers buy the bad produce, and if they’re not happy, they can return it for a refund?" she suggested, keeping her tone professional. 

Olivia Price, her colleague, frowned as she scrolled through customer complaints on her phone. "We can’t sell this batch," she stated firmly.

Just as Olivia left, Uncle Chen rushed in, his face flushed with anger. "Didn’t we agree you’d help sell our goods? Why are you suddenly pulling out?"

Ivy took a sip of her water, bracing herself. She knew this would happen. People get all upset when they don’t get what they expect, and somehow, it’s always someone else’s fault. 

"Look, we agreed not to sell spoiled vegetables. You can’t pass off rotten as fresh. That’s breaking the rules," Ivy explained with a cold edge in her voice.

Uncle Chen’s gaze shifted, his bravado faltering. "But come on, with this weather, what produce isn’t spoiled? You’ve never farmed, so what would you know?"

Ivy’s expression hardened as she inhaled deeply, suppressing her rising anger. "I may not know how to farm, but I know how to tell good from bad. If customers are complaining, that’s the reality."

She continued, "If you want to keep selling, sure! But the market price for a spot is $10,000. Think you're up for that?"

With a huff, Uncle Chen stormed out, mumbling curses under his breath. Ivy rested her forehead in her palm, exhausted. It felt like a thankless job—everyone just looks out for their own interests and expects her to fix everything.

“A good night’s sleep will fix it all,” she muttered, hoping to drown out the chaos.

Meanwhile, Ethan Clark had just come back to the office, and James Miller smirked, "Look who finally decided to show some professionalism!"

Ethan tapped his notebook thoughtfully, then suddenly declared, "Freeze all my dad’s bank accounts. No more of the family money for him."

His chilling statement sent a shiver through James. It was clear something serious had gone down.

An hour later, Ethan’s dad called, furious. He was out shopping with his new girlfriend, and after trying to swipe several cards without success, he found himself in a tight spot. 

"This card isn’t working?" He attempted another card, then another. All declined. Finally, he had to use the few bucks in his pocket to buy gifts for his lady friend.

He stepped aside to call Ethan. "Why did you freeze my accounts? Restore them now!"

Previously, Ethan's dad had been all smiles with his son, but now, there was only resentment. 

"You’re about to get a divorce. The family money should only be for family," Ethan shot back, his tone dripping with disdain.

"I'm your father!" Ethan's dad shouted, causing passersby to glance over in surprise.

Ethan replied coolly, "I’m a Clark, not a Liang."

The line went dead. 

Back at the office, the atmosphere was thick with tension, and James finally witnessed Ethan’s ruthless side, unyielding even with family. 

"Why are you standing around? Get to work," Ethan ordered, reaching for some documents.

James snapped out of his daze and quickly handed over the papers.

As he exited the office, a young assistant approached, whispering, "I heard his parents are splitting up?"

Another colleague chimed in, "With a family like that, it’s no surprise. They probably have side relationships all over the place. It’s just for show!"

James swatted at them playfully. "Less gossip, more work!"

Meanwhile, the old family house felt eerily empty. Ethan's mother was in tears, and when Lucas Smith came to visit, he found her sitting by the window, lost in thought.

“Chloe, what brings you here?” she forced a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.

“Aunt, I brought you some beauty supplements,” Lucas said, genuinely concerned for her well-being.

Upon hearing about the family troubles, Lucas rushed over to support her, someone he had looked up to all his life. 

She sighed, “If only you were the one marrying Ethan. At least I’d have some good news to hold onto.”

Lucas took her hand gently. “You can’t force matters of the heart. A bad relationship won’t bear good fruit.”

He meant it as much for her as for himself. It was time to let go of his own feelings. 

Ethan’s mother studied Lucas, taken aback. Wasn’t this the same girl who used to chase after him, not caring whether it was sweet or bitter, just wanting to take a bite? 

Even after everything she had done, Ethan still only had eyes for Ivy. 

Lucas decided to leave, thinking she might not see much of him around the family home anymore.

As New Year’s Eve approached, Ivy was busy packing shipments, more vigilant than ever after the recent incident.

“Ivy!” someone called from a distance.

She looked up to see Liam Harris limping towards her, his plaster cast finally off. 

“What are you doing here?” she asked, raising an eyebrow.

“Just here to help!” he grinned, leaning on his cane.

“Right, because you look super useful right now,” Ivy replied, unable to hide her sarcasm.

Ignoring her quip, Liam shuffled around the piles of boxes. “Whoa, that’s a lot!”

Ivy grabbed a chair for him. “Here you go, your royal highness. Please, take a seat.”

He plopped down, watching her scurry about. "You guys should really hire some extra help."

Ivy brushed off his suggestion. "Yeah, sure, I’ll just pull some money from thin air."

Just then, Grace Peterson walked in and eyed Liam curiously. “Who’s this?”

Ivy stood up to introduce him. “This is my friend, Liam Harris.”

Liam straightened his posture and said, “Hello, ma’am.”

Grace scrutinized him, noting, *He’s not bad looking, but he gives off a careless vibe.* 

And thus, the chaos of family, business, and unexpected alliances continued, all leading to a New Year’s Eve that was bound to be anything but ordinary.
