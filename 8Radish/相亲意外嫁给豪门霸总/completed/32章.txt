**Seeing Dollar Signs**

Ethan Clark sat in his car, his gaze locked on two hands intertwined from a distance, and he couldn’t help but grind his teeth. He called over Jason Brooks, his buddy, but his focus was entirely on Ivy Gonzalez. Not only were they holding hands, but she was also leaning in to chat with Sophia Bennett, while just last night, she had looked at him like he was the enemy.

He pressed his fingers against his throbbing temples. This was seriously annoying.

From the moment Ivy hopped into the car, Ethan's eyes were glued to her. She squirmed under his intense stare, not saying a word. 

"Spit it out!" Ivy shot back, casting him an exasperated glance. "What’s with the silent treatment? It’s already been a crazy night; what are you mad about now?"

"What’s with the hand-holding?" he challenged, a hint of accusation in his tone.

Ivy rolled her eyes, clearly unimpressed. "It’s just a handshake, Ethan. Are you from the Stone Age? Chill out."

"Ha!" Ethan retorted sarcastically. "You say you like me, then you’re off holding hands with someone else?"

Ivy couldn’t help but laugh. Was he really that clueless? "It’s just a handshake!" she said, extending her hand to grab Ethan’s arm for emphasis. "See? Like this!" Then she called Jason over, "Come here, stretch out your hand, and I’ll show the boss how it's done. All this nonsense about ‘no touching’ is so old-fashioned!"

Jason, caught off guard, almost reached out until Ethan smacked his hand away, making him retract it quickly.

Ethan was getting fed up. He suddenly grabbed both of her hands, leaning in close. "You’re seriously testing me right now?"

Ivy shot him a look, uninterested in his theatrics. Didn’t he have family obligations back at the old mansion?

Ethan kept his eyes on Ivy, turning to Jason. "Drive us to the old mansion."

Now that they were actually going, Ivy hesitated. She wasn’t ready to face his family—wasn’t this just a fake marriage? Why did she need to meet his parents?

As she wrestled with her thoughts, she looked out the window and found herself in an unfamiliar place. If it weren’t for Ethan, she probably would never have known this serene spot existed in the bustling city that never sleeps. 

Everything was quiet except for the soft glow of the orange streetlights guiding them. Outside, she couldn’t get a good look at the old mansion itself as towering walls stretched endlessly into the night sky.

Ivy hardly dared to breathe; she imagined the air here must be pretty pricey too.

As the grand entrance swung open, an elderly man with a warm smile approached them, bowing slightly. "Young Master!" he greeted Ethan.

Ethan nodded, pulling Ivy’s arm to walk beside him. She felt like she would’ve gotten lost if she had tried to navigate this place alone. 

He clasped her hand tighter, and she could feel his pulse racing—he hadn’t been this nervous in a while.

Ivy turned to him with a teasing smile. "Why are you so nervous? Shouldn’t it be me freaking out here?"

"Just stand next to me, okay?" he replied, rubbing her cold hand with his, his voice softening.

Inside the bright hall, the guests celebrating Ethan’s birthday had already dispersed, and a few staff members were busy cleaning up. At the head of the table sat Ethan's mother, looking regal but visibly annoyed that her son had left the festivities. "I told you not to let him stay out late! Now look what happened," she complained to Ethan's father.

Ethan’s dad took a sip of tea, clearly unfazed. "He’s an adult; you can’t keep him on a leash."

Suddenly, someone rushed in with news, catching Ethan’s mother’s attention. Her eyes lit up as she spotted Ethan entering, hand-in-hand with Ivy. 

"So, this is the girl he rushed to marry, huh?" she whispered to Ethan's father, nudging him. 

As they approached, her smile faded when she finally saw Ivy's face. She blinked, her smile freezing as she took Ivy in with a scrutinizing gaze. 

Ivy couldn’t help but notice how Ethan's mom seemed shocked to find someone who looked so much like Noah Scott, who had been her ideal daughter-in-law. 

The Smiths were a well-known family, and many girls would’ve loved the chance to be part of this family. Ethan's mom had always trusted her son’s judgment, but the sight of Ivy made her concern flare. 

She had thought Ethan would remain single forever, but seeing Ivy now made her anxious. Would he repeat the past with another girl who looked like Noah? 

With her pleasant demeanor gone, she straightened in her chair, placing her hands on her lap, her expression transforming into one of cold indifference. 

The tension in the air was palpable.

Ethan had anticipated this reaction, but he kept smiling, introducing Ivy to his parents. He had hesitated to bring her, but Ivy’s words of “liking” him gave him just enough courage to hope they could stand together.

In the chilly atmosphere inside, Ivy felt even colder than outside. Ethan's grip on her hand tightened, and she noticed a hint of red creeping into his cheeks—he was just as nervous.

Ivy took a good look at Ethan's mother. She looked elegant, but her current demeanor seemed intimidating, making Ivy wonder why Ethan had never mentioned wanting to introduce her to his family.

Before she could greet his parents, she heard Ethan’s mom sneer. "Nice timing to drop by. It’s past his birthday, you know." She looked Ivy up and down, her expression mocking. "Don’t think just because you two got a marriage certificate that you can waltz into our family. I've seen plenty of gold diggers like you; it won’t be that easy."

Ivy couldn’t help but think, *I’m not the one who begged Ethan to marry me!* If anything, she was more than happy to shove money in her pockets! Who doesn’t love cash?

"I have a job that keeps me busy," Ivy said, raising her voice just enough to be heard. "So I probably won’t have another chance to visit the Smith family. Wishing you health and happiness for many more birthdays to come."

Ethan's mom's eyes widened in shock. Where did they find this wild child? She was sharp-tongued and bold!

Ivy yanked her hand away from Ethan and declared, "I’ve got things to do. I’m outta here."

Just then, Lucas Smith emerged from the kitchen, carrying a bowl of freshly made delicacy. He spotted Ethan and exclaimed, "Hey! Finally, you’re here! Mom’s been waiting for you!"

Ethan's mom barked, "You stay right there! Chloe Nelson is still here; where do you think you’re going?!"

Ethan stared at his shadow cast on the shiny floor, feeling a twinge of pity for himself. He had pressured Ivy into this; without his wealth, she wouldn’t even be here, let alone marrying him.

He wished Ivy were just a simple girl chasing after money.

Ethan spoke firmly, "Ivy Gonzalez and I are married. That’s a fact that won’t change no matter what." 

And with that proclamation, the night was set ablaze with tension.
