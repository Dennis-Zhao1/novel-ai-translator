**Do You Like Me?**

Ivy Gonzalez rummaged through her bag, pulled out a cigarette, lit it, and leaned against the wall, savoring her moment of solitude. The smoke curled into the hallway, and her eyes caught sight of an elderly man with a cane, hobbling toward her, clearly in a hurry to see his daughter.

It was Ethan Clark who casually took the cigarette from Ivy's hand and dropped it into a nearby water bottle. Ivy recognized the man immediately—Emma Ward's father. The striking resemblance between him and Emma was uncanny. Without wasting another moment, Ivy rushed over to help him as they made their way to Emma's hospital room.

As they entered, the sight of Emma, bruised and battered, broke the old man's heart. He didn't speak at first; instead, he raised his cane as if to scold her, his face twisted with anger and despair. "I told you not to date him! Look at you—look what he did! You must want to drive me to an early grave!" His frustration echoed in the room.

Ethan quickly stepped in to calm the situation, while Ivy gently shielded Emma's head, fearing any further harm. Despite the rage, the old man couldn’t bring himself to hit his daughter. Instead, he pounded the floor with his cane, letting his frustration spill over.

Emma didn’t argue; she knew there was no point. She turned her face away, accepting the verbal onslaught as a consequence of her choices.

Ethan helped the old man find a chair, offering comfort. “It’s just some surface wounds; don’t worry too much,” he reassured him. The old man bowed his head, tears welling in his eyes, grateful for the kindness.

Ivy glanced at Emma lying in the hospital bed, realizing how long Emma had been putting on a brave face, pretending everything was fine. She’d always wanted to appear strong and glamorous, hiding her struggles from the world. It suddenly clicked for Ivy why Emma was working herself to the bone; she was trapped in a relationship with a leech of a boyfriend who drained her spirit.

Ivy felt a wave of sympathy for Emma, a talented woman who deserved so much more than this. Emma had every right to pursue a life of her own, free from such toxicity.

After a lengthy stay at the hospital, they finally headed home. Ethan was laden with bags from the supermarket, bustling around the kitchen. A clattering of pots and pans soon echoed from the back, and Ivy couldn’t help but peek in. She stood at the doorway, momentarily mesmerized by the sight of Ethan cooking. It was a side of him she had never seen before.

She felt a warm flutter in her chest. Despite his picky eating habits, he had never cooked anything in his life—food was usually delivered right to him. Ivy had even coaxed him into learning how to make porridge, mainly because she needed something nutritious for her stomach issues. 

Ivy often overlooked his efforts, getting frustrated with him instead. Now, it struck her how unfair that was. Slowly, she walked over, wrapped her arms around his waist from behind, feeling the firm muscles he had developed from working out.

Resting her cheek against his back, she listened to his steady breathing and closed her eyes, letting the moment wash over her.

Startled, Ethan thought Ivy might be shaken up from earlier and turned to offer her comfort. But she tightened her grip, not wanting him to see the hint of tears in her eyes, feeling a bit foolish.

Leaning against him, she mumbled, “Why are you so good to me?”

That question had been swirling in her mind, and she wanted to hear his answer. But it didn’t come.

Ethan stiffened, a smile barely breaking through the concern in his eyes. Guilt and anxiety knotted in his stomach; he was reluctant to let Ivy into his past, a world so intertwined with his ex, Noah Scott. He feared that if she discovered the truth behind their marriage, she might leave.

When Ivy didn’t get a response, a large hand enveloped hers, holding it tightly. The warmth sent shivers through her. He gently patted her hand and said softly, “Dinner’s ready.”

Though Ivy typically didn’t have a strong appetite, tonight felt different—perhaps because Ethan had put in the effort just for her. She savored every bite of the soup, practically slurping it down.

Across the table, Ethan watched her with an unreadable expression in his eyes. Then, he asked casually, “Ivy, do you like me?”

His heart raced, unsure of where this conversation would lead. He knew their marriage was built on shaky ground, void of any real feelings. Ivy had been so hot and cold with him lately; he couldn’t figure out if she liked him or not. 

Ivy moved closer, cupping his face in her hands, her sincerity shining through as she replied, “I do.”

Her lack of experience in love made her unsure, but she felt something genuine in that moment—perhaps it was that sudden rush of emotions or his charming dimpled smile that made her heart flutter. 

Ethan’s face lit up; he had received countless confessions in the past, but none had ever made him this happy. Just hearing her say those words made everything worth it.

As Ivy realized what she had just admitted, her cheeks flushed a deep crimson.
