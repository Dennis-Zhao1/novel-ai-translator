**Late to the Party**

“Sorry, I’m late!”

Ethan Clark strolled into the room, sporting a sleek black suit that hugged his tall frame and slim waist just right. He had a coat slung casually over one arm, radiating an air of cool detachment. His sharp black eyes scanned the gathering until they landed on Ivy Gonzalez, who stood frozen in disbelief.

“What on earth is he doing here?” Ivy thought, panic bubbling in her chest. She didn’t dare approach him—after all, only a handful of people knew the truth about their relationship. They had a silent agreement to keep it under wraps, and Ivy wasn’t about to break that now.

The rest of the attendees were a mix of awe and confusion, unsure how to react to Ethan's presence. Most had never seen him before and were too intimidated to speak. It was TE Corporation's CEO, however, who was all smiles, practically glowing with excitement. “Mr. Xu! We’ve been waiting for you!” he exclaimed, rushing forward to greet him.

The moment the CEO fawned over Ethan, the others quickly stood up, nodding and bowing in respect, understanding that this latecomer was someone important. Ethan said little, his expression as icy as ever, as he strolled over and took the CEO's seat right next to Ivy.

Sitting shoulder to shoulder with Ethan sent Ivy’s heart racing. She had never seen this side of him—his eyes were sharp, and he radiated a cool aloofness that made her feel exposed.

“Calm down, Ivy,” she thought as she took a tiny sip of her drink, trying to act nonchalant and avoid his gaze. But just then, she felt a gentle squeeze on her left hand.

Ouch! Ivy frowned, turning her head to glare at him. It was definitely Ethan, and she was too annoyed to say anything. He was clearly trying to teach her a lesson for being awkward. Ethan didn’t even flinch at her glare, keeping his grip firm as if daring her to complain. 

“Everyone, no need to be so stiff. Let’s drink!” Ethan announced, breaking the tension in the room. The others started to loosen up, pretending to enjoy their drinks, though they avoided teasing Ivy or trying to engage Ethan in any lighthearted banter. 

As the night wore on and drinks flowed, people began to trickle out, leaving just Ethan and Ivy in the room, each pretending the other didn’t exist. Ivy risked a quick glance at him, feeling an impending storm brewing; he hadn’t touched a single drop of alcohol and had barely spoken the entire night.

“Do you have any idea what you’re doing?!” Ethan’s voice was low and laced with frustration as he finally broke the silence.

The faint scent of alcohol wafted through the air, and Ivy suddenly had an idea. She leaned forward dramatically, resting her head on the table and slurred, “I feel so dizzy, I can’t take it anymore!”

Ethan instinctively reached out, cupping her head in his hands. “The table is dirty!” he sighed, exasperated. “Why force yourself to drink if you can’t handle it? You’re so reckless!” He scooped Ivy up in his arms and marched out of the restaurant.

Pretending to be drunk was harder than it looked. Ivy felt herself shifting as he placed her in the car. She kept her eyes shut tight, trying to keep up the act. 

“Still pretending, huh?” Ethan’s voice was cool, but there was a hint of amusement in it. Ivy stayed limp, draping her arm around his neck and nuzzling closer. For the first time, she noticed how nice he smelled, and she instinctively rubbed her nose against him as if trying to shake off her own alcohol smell.

In the dim light of the car, Ethan’s forehead brushed against hers, and his breath quickened as he took in her flushed cheeks and fluttering lashes. He held her tighter, wishing she could stay close forever.

“Happy birthday, Mr. Xu!” Jason Brooks, their driver, chimed in at just the right moment.

Ethan glanced at his watch—midnight. “Thanks,” he replied, a soft smile creeping onto his face. He had hoped to celebrate his birthday with Ivy, just the two of them, but it seemed she had completely forgotten.

Ivy, now alert, straightened up and stared wide-eyed at him. “It’s your birthday?!” she exclaimed.

“Wouldn’t you remember?” Ethan raised an eyebrow, pretending to be annoyed.

Ivy felt a pang of guilt. She knew how much he valued birthdays and celebrations, and she had totally flubbed it. As she racked her brain for a way to make it up to him, she caught sight of vibrant flower stalls whizzing by outside the window. 

“Stop the car!” she shouted, turning to Jason. Without waiting for a reply, she leaped out and ran to the nearest flower stall, determined to buy him something special.

Ethan followed her, a soft smile playing on his lips as he let Jason head back. Ivy returned with a bouquet, grinning from ear to ear. “Happy birthday, Mr. Xu!” she beamed, pulling out a lighter as makeshift candles flickered in the night.

He chuckled, warmth flooding his features. “So this is how you plan to make it up to me?” He pretended to be annoyed, but his smile told a different story as he made a wish, blowing out the tiny flames.

Under the moonlight, Ivy realized just how charming Ethan could be when he smiled, sending a shiver of delight through her.

“Oh, I have something else for you!” she said, digging into her bag. She pulled out a card and handed it to him with a proud smile. 

Ethan raised an eyebrow, curious. “A card?”

“Not just any card! There’s thirty thousand bucks on it! I figured it was time I paid you back for all those times you’ve helped me out,” Ivy said cheerfully.

Ethan’s expression turned serious, and he tossed the card back at her, his voice firm. “You don’t owe me anything! I don’t want your money. If anything, I feel ashamed for even suggesting we have a marriage of convenience.”

She watched him, realizing they were cut from the same cloth, sharing a similar upbringing and values. To them, money was just a tool, not something to be clung to.

In Ivy’s eyes, thirty thousand dollars could mean the difference between life and death for someone. But to Ethan, it was just a reminder of the emotions he was struggling with.

“Take it, or I’ll fight you!” Ivy teased, a playful glint in her eyes.

Ethan couldn’t help but chuckle, shaking his head. Maybe birthdays were worth celebrating after all, especially when Ivy was by his side.
