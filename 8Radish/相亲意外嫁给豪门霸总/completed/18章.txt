**Title: Smoke and Mirrors**

As the temperature dropped sharply that night, Ivy Gonzalez could feel the chill creeping in, even from the cozy confines of the car. She had dressed too lightly for the approaching autumn, her thin sweater not quite cutting it. Glancing over at Ethan Clark, who was gripping the steering wheel with white knuckles, she couldn't help but notice the tension radiating off him. His jaw was clenched tight, and his brows were furrowed deep, signaling that he was still fuming about something. But what?

Ethan must have caught a glimpse of her shivering because he quickly cranked the heat up. His voice was frosty, “Don’t ever go back there again.”

Ivy leaned against the window, her mind drifting as she absentmindedly pinched her palm. Silence stretched between them, thick enough to slice through. Once they arrived at Ethan's place, the unfamiliarity of it all hit Ivy like a ton of bricks. It was like stepping into someone else's home, and she felt like an unwelcome guest. Her mood darkened, her head drooping, reminiscent of the days spent at her aunt’s house during childhood. Those years had been a blur of chores and tiptoeing around, trying not to upset anyone.

She recalled how her aunt would belittle her for being too studious when her cousin threw tantrums over candy. "Why don’t you comfort your little cousin instead of burying your face in your homework?" her aunt would sneer. After a year of that, Ivy vowed never to return.

If she were home, she could slam doors and sulk in her room, but here, in this place that didn’t belong to her, she felt the need to tread carefully.

Turning to Ethan, who had finally calmed down, she proposed, “Let’s draft a contract. You can list everything you don’t want me to do, and until I pay off my debt to you, I promise I’ll stick to it.”

Ethan paused, staring at her like she had just spoken in a foreign language. “What are you talking about?” he asked, bemused.

Ivy couldn’t help but laugh, pulling out a cigarette from her pocket, the cool minty smell wafting through the air as she took a long drag. “Let’s get it straight. If I don’t know what’s pissing you off, how can I avoid it? You don’t like when I smoke, or when I sing at that bar. Is there anything else? Or do you just want me around like a pet?”

With a sarcastic smirk, she glanced at her own body, rolling her eyes. “This is all I’ve got to offer.”

She bit down on her cigarette as she started unbuttoning her shirt, revealing her long, pale neck and soft curls that cascaded down. Ethan, however, didn’t seem amused. He dropped the car keys he was clutching and took two steps toward her, looming over Ivy like a storm cloud. She instinctively stepped back, her heart racing.

Before she knew it, he snatched the cigarette from her mouth and held her wrists firmly, pulling her close. Ivy could feel the heat radiating from his body and the weight of his gaze as he studied her, making her heart race faster. She felt frozen, practically unable to breathe, with his solid chest right in front of her.

Tears began to well in her eyes as she fought the urge to cry. As they spilled over, they landed on his hand, sending a chill through her. After a moment, when she finally composed herself, he murmured softly, “I thought you were tougher than this…”

She shot him a glare, her pride stung. In retaliation, she bit down on the back of his hand, the skin firm beneath her teeth. He raised an eyebrow, appearing amused rather than offended, and she could feel her resolve wavering.

As he watched her, an unexpected lightness crept into his expression, amusement dancing in his eyes. Ethan was the type of guy who could find humor in the most awkward situations, and that was a quality Ivy both admired and found frustrating.

He took her cigarette, inhaling deeply and exhaling the smoke, his gaze piercing through the haze. “You smoke, I smoke with you,” he said, a teasing glint in his eyes.

Ivy stepped back, crossing her arms, trying to feign indifference. “That’s childish. If you don’t like it, don’t force yourself.”

But Ethan was a master of persuasion. He thrived on pushing buttons, and that’s exactly why they found themselves in this tangled mess. From that day on, he made sure he was always around instead of Jason Brooks, who had been keeping an eye on Ivy.

After work, he would head to the local tavern where he was a familiar face. The regulars would greet him warmly as he settled into his usual booth, ordering nothing but water while others around him indulged in drinks and laughter. 

“Look at him,” said a girl named Xia, eyeing Ethan from across the room. “He’s such a cheapskate, sitting here all night just drinking water when he could be enjoying the good stuff.”

Her friend Emma, more in the know, leaned in and whispered, “The boss lets him hang around because Ivy can perform here as long as he’s around.”

It was a peculiar arrangement, one Ivy never saw coming, but somehow, it all felt like part of a larger game they were both playing—whether they liked it or not.
