Title: Sophie Cook's Unfortunate Night

It was a quiet evening as Sophie Cook, dressed in a delicate pink gown that fluttered in the breeze, approached the quaint estate of Whispering Pines, carrying an old bottle of red wine. Her hair, cascading over her shoulders, was adorned with a pink crystal hairpin, echoing the signature style of a woman named Olivia Stewart from years past. The warm glow of the streetlights highlighted her ethereal presence, making her seem like a fairy descended from the heavens.

Upon reaching the front of the house, Sophie gracefully curtsied to Lucas Wright, whose eyes twinkled with curiosity. "Good evening, Mr. Wright," she chimed sweetly. "I'm the new maid, Li Bai Yi Ke. The young master heard of the second master's fondness for wine and sent me with a treasured bottle for him."

"Wine, you say?" Lucas's eyes sparkled with interest. "My master has been quite the connoisseur lately. Hurry and take it up to him!"

Sophie offered a soft smile and nodded, "Thank you, Mr. Wright!" Together, they ascended the stairs, and Lucas watched Sophie through narrowed eyes, struck by her uncanny resemblance to Olivia Stewart. Her looks, her voice, everything was eerily similar. If not for the lack of a certain innocence in her eyes, even Olivia's closest friends might have been fooled.

Sophie entered Isabella Peterson's room with a gentle knock, bowing politely. "Good evening, Mr. Peterson. I've brought you some wine." She was an actress by trade, familiar with Olivia, and her mimicry was impeccable.

Isabella glanced up, momentarily entranced, his inebriated gaze fixed on her face. "What's your name?"

"I'm Li Bai Yi Ke, a new maid. We met in the garden once," Sophie replied, her voice like a mellifluous songbird.

Isabella's mind took a moment to catch up. "Oh, my memory! Lucas, tell my brother I want this maid to stay."

"Yes, sir!" Lucas replied respectfully, closing the door as he left.

Sophie could barely contain her excitement. Isabella was as charming as ever, and she couldn't help but be drawn to him, despite his past cruelty.

"Bring the wine here," Isabella gestured, eyes never leaving her face.

Sophie, feigning bashfulness, approached and deftly uncorked the bottle. "Here, let me pour you a drink," she offered, her slender fingers expertly handling the glass, her body naturally leaning into his.

Isabella's lips curled into a wicked smile, though his gaze remained clear and sharp. His eyes flicked to the crystal hairpin atop Sophie's head, and he casually accepted the glass. "Good wine is meant to be shared, don't you think?"

Sophie playfully teased, "You mean, one sip for you, one for me?"

"Great idea!" Isabella wobbled to his feet, a mischievous grin on his face. "Come here, I'll... feed you."

Sophie suppressed her glee, feigning shyness as she leaned closer.

In an instant, Isabella tipped the glass, dousing Sophie in wine. "Oops!" he mocked, "Let me help you clean up!" He clumsily reached for her hair, now matted and sticky, pulling at it until the crystal hairpin clattered to the floor.

Stepping on the hairpin with a crunch, Isabella ground it to pieces, revealing a hidden camera within. "Did you really think this would fool me?" Isabella's eyes turned cold as he yanked at Sophie's hair again, eliciting a cry of pain.

"Please, Mr. Peterson, have mercy!" Sophie pleaded, her eyes wide with fear.

Isabella, disgusted, tossed a towel at her and sat down, watching as she wiped her face. Despite the humiliation, Sophie misinterpreted his actions as a sign of affection.

Seeing the crushed hairpin sent a chill through her. Without the footage she intended to capture, she feared Alexander Peterson's wrath.

Desperate, she knelt before Isabella, her eyes pleading. "Mr. Peterson, can't you be a little gentler?"

Isabella's fingers traced her face, icy and dangerous. "Is this gentle enough?" he asked softly.

Sophie forced a smile, "Oh, Mr. Peterson, you're so naughty!"

Isabella smirked, "You haven't seen anything yet. Want to?"

Sophie's cheeks flushed, nodding slightly.

With unexpected ferocity, Isabella's hand tightened around her neck, cutting off her breath.

"Uhâ€”" Sophie gasped, eyes wide in shock.

"Who sent you?" Isabella demanded, his gaze piercing.

"Please, Mr. Peterson, don't..." Sophie choked out.

"Sophie Cook!" Isabella spat, finally recognizing her.

Sophie's eyes darted nervously. She was caught.

Isabella released her with a look of disdain. "Alexander saved you, didn't he?"

Sophie nodded, tears in her eyes. Once nearly destroyed by Isabella, she owed her life to Alexander's intervention.

"What was your mission tonight? Seduce me and collect evidence for Olivia?" Isabella scoffed.

"I had no choice, Mr. Peterson! Alexander is... he's dangerous!" Sophie shivered, recalling his sinister ways.

Isabella's thoughts turned to those who had mysteriously disappeared. He understood.

Sophie misread his contemplation as sympathy, clinging to his leg in desperation. "Please, let me stay with you! I can be her substitute!"

"You're not worthy," Isabella sneered, kicking her away. "Get out!"

Two silent figures emerged from the shadows, dragging Sophie away. They were David Wright's bodyguards, loyal only to Isabella.

As dawn broke, a battered Sophie trudged back, her body aching from the night's ordeal. Isabella spared her life but left her at the mercy of the guards, her plan in ruins.

Now, she had to face Alexander and his wrath. But first, she needed an excuse for her failure.

Before she could gather her thoughts, Alexander appeared, his expression unreadable.

"D-did you hear... I got lost and ended up in the guards' quarters," Sophie stammered.

Alexander's eyes glinted coldly, "Come with me."

Inside, Alexander revealed a small, gleaming knife. His smile was chilling. "I find living subjects much more interesting."

Sophie collapsed to the floor, terror-stricken. "No..."

Alexander's smile widened, his intent clear.

The night had only begun for Sophie Cook.
