Suddenly, the alarm blared through the house, echoing off the walls with a piercing shrillness.

"Where's the doctor? And where on earth is old man Jones? Has he disappeared off the face of the earth?" Isabella Peterson's voice boomed through the room, her frustration palpable. Barefoot, she paced back and forth on the plush carpet by Olivia Stewart's bed, occasionally stopping to glare daggers at Olivia. "You've been gone for just a few days and already managed to get yourself into such a mess! Pathetic!"

"Bang!" Isabella's foot connected with the bedside table.

Olivia, lying face down, didn't dare to turn her head. Her heart was racing, fearing that Isabella's next move might be to kick her right out the window.

A soft knock interrupted the tension.

Isabella marched to the door, but halfway there, she turned back to cover Olivia’s back with a thin silk sheet, leaving only the wounded area exposed. Satisfied, she called out in a cold voice, "Come in!"

The door creaked open, and through the narrow gap appeared the silver-haired head of Lucas Wright and the edge of the doctor’s medical kit.

"Ma'am," Lucas and the doctor greeted in unison, bowing slightly, hesitant to step inside.

In a swift motion, Isabella seized the medical kit from the doctor’s grasp and slammed the door shut with a resounding thud.

The noise startled Olivia into turning her head. She caught sight of Isabella, looking like a stern schoolmaster with the medical kit in hand, returning to her side.

"Isabella, what are you planning to do?" Olivia asked, her voice laced with apprehension. Was Isabella really going to tend to her wounds herself? Or was this just a pretext to lecture her?

"Turn your face away!" Isabella's voice left no room for argument.

Olivia knew Isabella hated to be contradicted, but this was about her own well-being. Plucking up her courage, she protested, "Isabella, maybe you should let the doctor handle it."

"Was it him who bandaged you last time? Are you that eager to let him see?" Isabella's voice dripped with jealousy.

Frustrated, Olivia pounded her fists on the carpet. "Isabella, I'm injured!"

"He's a man!" Isabella retorted, as if that settled the matter.

"So, you’re saying I shouldn’t see a doctor when I’m hurt? I should just suffer through it?"

"Who told you to get hurt in the first place? You deserve it!" Isabella snapped, though her actions belied her harsh words. She began cleaning the wound with an alcohol-soaked cotton ball.

Olivia winced at the sting. "Ouch!"

"Stay still! Bear with it!" Isabella commanded.

As Isabella worked, the cooling sensation of her breath on the wound brought unexpected relief. Olivia glanced up, catching Isabella’s reflection in the dresser mirror. She was concentrated, blowing gently on the wound, an almost comical sight given his usual stoic demeanor. Yet, his focused expression tugged at something in Olivia's heart.

The pain seemed to fade.

Isabella caught Olivia’s gaze in the mirror, his face briefly betraying a hint of embarrassment before he resumed his usual stern expression, discarding the cotton ball with evident disdain.

Olivia's heart sank. She’d forgotten how much Isabella loathed mess and disorder. The only reason he was doing this was to keep the doctor away, not out of any real concern for her.

Feeling dejected, Olivia buried her face in her arms.

Moments later, she felt a fine powder sprinkled on her wound, followed by a slight sting. Peeking up, she saw Isabella deftly applying medication with practiced precision.

His attention to detail was like a soothing balm to her heart.

With her emotions swinging like a rollercoaster, Olivia wondered if all girls in love felt this way. She blushed at the thought, hiding her smile with a playful face in the mirror.

When Isabella finished, he expertly applied layers of gauze and secured them with tape. His skillful care made Olivia wonder if he’d had his fair share of scrapes growing up.

As Isabella wound a long strip of gauze around her, Olivia felt his warm hands brush against her skin, sending a heat through her cheeks. She shifted uncomfortably.

Isabella pressed her shoulder, keeping her still as he continued wrapping the gauze. His serious demeanor made it hard to reconcile with the mischievous side she knew so well.

Feeling a bit foolish, Olivia hid her face in embarrassment.

After what felt like an eternity, Isabella finished, tying a neat knot at the side. He stepped back, admiring his handiwork. "There, looks much better than that doctor’s job!"

Olivia couldn’t help but agree. His method had indeed provided more comfort and stability.

When she accidentally voiced this thought, Isabella bristled. "You’d prefer him to wrap you up?"

"Uh..." Olivia stammered, backtracking quickly. "I just mean, your way works better. I feel much more comfortable now!"

"Spare me the flattery! Stay put and wait for me!" Isabella ordered sharply, then strode out, leaving Olivia to wonder what would happen next.

Olivia, like a curious rabbit, followed stealthily, watching as Isabella and Lucas entered the study. She tiptoed after them, only to find the door firmly closed.

Frustrated, Olivia searched for another vantage point, settling by the window. She tried to peek inside, but her head bumped against the glass.

"Ouch! Seriously, this guy installed bulletproof windows?" she muttered, rubbing her forehead.

Before she could retreat, the alarm blared again, and suddenly the hallway was swarming with security guards.

Caught, Olivia turned to find Isabella standing in the doorway, his face a mask of fury.

She laughed nervously, backing away. "I was just trying to surprise you!"

Isabella stared incredulously. "You thought you could break through bulletproof glass with your head? What were you thinking?"

Busted, Olivia had nothing left to do but shrug sheepishly.
