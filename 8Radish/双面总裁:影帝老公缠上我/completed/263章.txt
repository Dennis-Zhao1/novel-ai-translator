Alexander Peterson stepped out of his private room, a twisted sense of satisfaction playing on his delicate features. The air was thick with tension when Sam entered, careful not to meet Alexander's eyes, which were still charged with a palpable intensity. "Boss, we've got a problem at the company," Sam announced, his voice barely above a whisper.

Alexander's expression darkened. "What kind of problem?"

"It's the head of the finance department, Mr. Wong. He's been reported for embezzlement, and the amount is substantial. But that's not all..."

Before Sam could finish, Alexander was already striding out, his mind racing. Mr. Wong was a key player in his intricate web of influence within the company. If the finance department was compromised, it could spell disaster for his plans.

Arriving at the company's headquarters, Alexander was met with chaos that exceeded his worst fears. It wasn't just Mr. Wong who was in trouble. The legal team, marketing department, and public relations—all the pillars of his covert empire within the company—had been uprooted overnight. Even the two informants posing as tea servers had been let go.

Every one of Alexander's allies had been meticulously removed, leaving him exposed and vulnerable. It was clear that someone had been watching his every move all along, making him feel like a fool, a puppet dancing on strings he hadn't seen.

In a fit of rage, Alexander stormed into his office, hurling objects and letting out a furious shout. "Who did this? Who fired all these people?" he demanded, his voice echoing off the walls.

His assistant, witnessing his usually composed boss erupt with such fury for the first time, nervously replied, "It was the Vice President, sir. But he had an order signed by the old chairman himself."

"Damn that old man!" Alexander seethed, smashing a teacup against the floor. He had thought that sending Nathan Peterson to the hospital would remove him from the equation. Yet, here was this old fox, still managing to exert his influence from a hospital bed.

Alexander felt the sting of betrayal. Nathan had always been warm and encouraging, but the moment things went awry, he had cut off all of Alexander's escape routes. Was this all to clear the path for Isabella, his actual blood relative, who had seemingly faded into obscurity?

No, Nathan Peterson couldn't be allowed to remain in the picture any longer.

With a dangerous glint in his eyes, Alexander adjusted his glasses and instructed his assistant, "Prepare a substantial gift. I'm visiting the old man in the hospital."

Nathan Peterson sat in his hospital room, staring at a stack of documents. They had been delivered anonymously, detailing Alexander's years of corruption and schemes to drain the company's resources.

After reviewing the evidence, Nathan tossed the papers aside with a heavy sigh. "That foolish boy," he muttered, his chest heaving with disappointment.

"Sir, please, your heart can't take this stress," urged Luke, his loyal attendant, trying to calm him.

Nathan shook his head. "Look at what Alexander has done! He's undermining his own foundation! I let Isabella dabble outside to give him a chance to establish himself here, and this is how he repays me? By trying to bring down the company?"

Luke hesitated, then tentatively suggested, "Why not just hand the company over to him, then?"

"You don't understand," Nathan replied. "With Isabella as a buffer, Alexander's current reputation wouldn't justify taking over. I had hoped he'd prove himself capable while Isabella was away. But now... what a mess!"

Luke looked at Nathan's despondent face with concern. "What will you do now, sir?"

"What can I do? With this evidence, he could spend the rest of his life behind bars!" Nathan's voice was full of resignation.

"Clink—"

A noise at the door interrupted their conversation. Luke quickly opened it to find Alexander standing there. "Sir, Alexander's here to see you."

Luke ushered Alexander inside, wary of how much he might have overheard.

Alexander approached Nathan with a respectful demeanor, a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Uncle," he greeted.

Nathan turned away with a gruff huff, refusing to meet his gaze.

Alexander subtly glanced at the documents by Nathan's side, recognizing his own incriminating records. So it was Nathan who was pulling the strings, threatening to lock him away to clear the path for his son.

A flicker of resentment crossed Alexander's eyes, but his voice remained humble. "Uncle, it's been a while. How are you feeling?"

"You still remember I'm your uncle? Do you even recall your own last name? Look at what you've done!" Nathan threw the documents at Alexander, his voice thick with disappointment. "Alexander, you've let me down so much!"

Alexander fell to his knees, head bowed. "Uncle, I was wrong! Please forgive me for my father's sake!"

"You..." Nathan was nearly choked with anger at the mention of Alexander's father. He wanted to reprimand Alexander harshly but found himself at a loss for words, eventually letting out a heavy sigh instead.

Silence hung heavily in the room. Alexander knelt, maintaining a posture of submission, aware that any further provocation could lead Nathan to turn over the damning evidence, sealing his fate.

Nathan's gaze lingered on Alexander's bowed head, tears welling up in his eyes. After a long pause, he sighed again. "Alexander, go to the chapel and stay with your mother. I'll have Isabella manage the company for now. Luke, see Alexander out."

Alexander's hands clenched into fists at his sides. Years of careful maneuvering had unraveled in an instant, but he swallowed his pride. "Thank you, Uncle. I'll stay at the chapel and reflect on my actions."

Nathan's expression softened slightly. "If you can truly repent, that's for the best. I'm doing this for your own good. Spend time with your mother. Your business acumen isn't as sharp as Isabella's. Once he's stabilized the company, I'll hand it over to you."

Nathan's candidness was meant as reassurance, but Alexander took it as mere placation. The seeds of resentment and jealousy took root, setting the stage for future missteps.

Settling into the chapel's serene environment, Alexander initially tried to coax his mother, Lily, into interceding on his behalf. But when she firmly declared her intention to remain in the chapel for penance, Alexander's hope dwindled.

With no outlet for his frustration, Alexander resorted to self-harm, his body becoming a canvas for his despair, further darkening his already brooding nature.

Meanwhile, Isabella took decisive action, restructuring the company with an efficiency that left everyone in awe. The internal staff and security were also overhauled, revealing Isabella's superior capabilities compared to Alexander. The once chaotic environment began to stabilize under Isabella's leadership.

A month later, Isabella returned to the country for the premiere of "Send an Angel to Love You," hoping to see Olivia Stewart. The premiere was held at the prestigious Golden Theatre, attracting a massive crowd. However, Olivia, the film's lead actress, was conspicuously absent.

Having shed his alter ego, Isabella appeared in his natural persona, his stern face drawing screams from fans. Despite their enthusiasm, Isabella remained aloof, his attention solely focused on searching the crowd.

He had a gut feeling Olivia was there, hidden among the spectators.

Director Wong noticed Isabella's distraction and quickly wrapped up the ceremony. With the premiere officially underway, Isabella found himself on the theater's high platform, leaning against the railing, a cigarette between his fingers.

Without Olivia's presence, even the most lively events felt hollow, leaving him with a sense of isolation that verged on panic.

He had crafted the film to rekindle Olivia's memories, yet she hadn't even shown up for the premiere. Was she avoiding him?

It seemed Olivia was truly upset this time.

But whose fault was it? Although he now understood that his past doubts had been fueled by Professor Zhang's manipulations and Alexander's deceit, the damage from those suspicions couldn't be undone.

Isabella lowered his head, pressing a fist to his forehead, his eyes filled with regret and sorrow. "Olivia, won't you even give me a chance to say 'I'm sorry'?"

"Send an Angel to Love You" broke box office records on its first day, receiving rave reviews online. Many hailed it as the most beautiful love story of the year, catapulting Olivia Stewart to fame.

Yet, Olivia remained absent throughout it all, her presence a ghostly absence.

Indifferent to the skyrocketing success, Isabella retreated to his study upon returning home, isolating himself for the rest of the night.

The next morning, a gentle knock interrupted his solitude.

"Sir, you've received a letter," Lucas Wright announced, handing over an envelope. "It's been thoroughly checked for safety."

Isabella opened the envelope, and a delicate piece of paper fell out. Olivia's elegant handwriting met his eyes...
