Title: Date with the Dream Guy

Tyler's brow furrowed even more tightly. He had originally agreed to meet Sophie Cook, hoping to coax some information out of her. But seeing her put on this over-the-top act, he was overwhelmed with intense disgust. Especially since he was already in a foul mood!

Just as he was about to dismiss her, Sophie Cook pretended to twist her ankle, pitching forward with her dress's plunging neckline aimed right at him, leaving little to the imagination.

"Oh my goodness!"

Amy Green felt a sudden rush of heat to her face, quickly turning away in embarrassment.

Without hesitation, Tyler leaned toward Sophie Cook.

Sophie was inwardly delighted; this trick never failed. No man could resist! Even the coldest of guys couldn't possibly be an exception!

However, Tyler stopped just a few inches from her, his warm breath brushing the edge of her neckline, but he made no further move.

Just a little closer! Just a bit more!

Sophie was internally screaming for him to move, yet she had to maintain a coy, reluctant demeanor.

He wasn’t making a move, and it wasn't like she could just grab him!

Amy Green sneaked a peek from the side, as anxious as an ant on a hot pan.

Boss, you have to hold it together! That's your sister-in-law! If you give in, Olivia Stewart will make sure you're apologizing forever!

Suddenly, Tyler reached out a hand toward Sophie Cook.

Oh no, it's over!

Amy Green facepalmed silently, turning away to shield him.

As an assistant, you had to be prepared for moments like this!

Sophie had already shut her eyes, her delicately painted face blushing beneath layers of makeup.

Who would have thought this seemingly aloof, untouchable guy could be so bold? Was he about to transform into a wolf right here? Probably not; his luxury car was parked nearby. It was as big and grand as Isabella Peterson's!

Sophie's mind raced with anticipation, her closed eyelashes fluttering with silent invitation.

Yet, after what felt like ages, the anticipated touch never came—not even a supportive gesture.

"What is this?" Tyler's voice was low and clear, carrying a slightly husky undertone, but distinctly different from an intimate murmur.

Having met many people, Sophie could easily tell. It was like a cold shower jolting her awake. Opening her eyes, she saw Tyler holding a piece of paper.

Turns out, Tyler's gaze had never been on what Sophie was flaunting. He had bent down only to retrieve a sheet that had fallen from her bag, examining it for a few seconds before picking it up.

His hand brushed close by Sophie without touching her at all!

Straightening up, Sophie forced a smile, her emotions a mixed bag of disappointment, embarrassment, and a burning jealousy towards Olivia Stewart.

Why could Olivia Stewart effortlessly win men's affection with a mere smile, while she, despite using all her best tricks, remained ignored?

In terms of looks and skills, she was sure she surpassed Olivia Stewart in every way!

Sophie's face twisted unattractively.

What she didn't realize was that when it came to such matters, men often preferred innocence. The less experience a girl had, the better. They liked to be the ones to teach.

If you don’t believe it, just look at the roads—who with a private car chooses to squeeze onto the bus?

After a long silence, Tyler glanced from the paper to Sophie's face, a hint of inquiry in his eyes.

Sophie quickly masked her resentment, putting on a troubled expression. "This isn't my drawing; it's something my sister made a long time ago. Actually, she used to... this isn't something I should talk about as her sister, sigh!"

Sophie left the story hanging, sparking curiosity.

She had planned to show Tyler this later, but it had fallen out unexpectedly. Had she known how captivating this paper would be, she would've presented it immediately!

Tyler's brows furrowed slightly, his gaze returning to the paper. It was old and yellowed, a few years old, with a slightly blurred image due to moisture. Yet it was still discernible—a handsome, slightly melancholic young man.

At first glance, Tyler recognized his 20-year-old self.

To be fair, Olivia Stewart's portrait skills were impressive, capturing his essence remarkably well.

Seeing this paper, Tyler realized it was from the small wooden box Olivia Stewart had lost. Now Sophie confirmed it, making it undeniable.

So, Sophie had secretly followed Olivia to that quaint town and taken these things! But why?

A chill crossed Tyler's eyes, replaced by a calm blue gaze.

Tyler held the drawing nonchalantly, commenting, "Your sister's art is quite good."

"Do you like it?"

Sophie, overjoyed, seized the opportunity to invite him again, "I have a lot more. Why don't we go to a café and take a look?"

"Sure." Tyler nodded, glancing at Amy Green.

Amy got the hint, leading them to the Pearl Café, strategically seating them diagonally from Olivia Stewart and Ethan King.

After settling them in, Amy Green quietly excused herself.

Sophie was thrilled, thinking the assistant was smart. She'd send him a big thank-you later!

In reality, Amy was following her boss's orders to keep an eye on Ethan King and Olivia Stewart next door.

The elegant room was filled with soothing music, and the air was rich with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee.

Sophie eyed her coffee cup, her expression demure yet her heart racing.

Through her filming experiences, she'd become quite adept at understanding men's thoughts, but with Tyler, she needed to maintain a certain reserve, or it could backfire.

But if she didn't find a way to break through, would this aloof man ever fall for her charms?

Sophie lifted her face with a sweet smile, "Tyler, would you like me to add some sugar to your coffee?"

"No need."

Tyler gracefully stirred his coffee, his voice as rich and pleasant as the drink itself. "Didn't you say your sister had more drawings? Why don't you show them to me?"

Again with Olivia Stewart!

Sophie's expression shifted but quickly returned to gentle sweetness. Carefully, she pulled out a stack of old drawings from her bag, looking hesitant. "These are my sister's. I probably shouldn't show them to you, but seeing how concerned you are about her, I thought you'd want to know more. Here, they're all her sketches."

Sophie spoke as she slid closer to Tyler, her soft body subtly leaning in, trying to use the moment to close the gap between them.

As soon as Tyler got the drawings, he shifted his elbow away.

Sophie leaned forward, aiming to press her assets against his arm, but he moved just in time, causing her to hit the table with a thud.

Tyler took the chance to move his chair, raising an amused eyebrow. "Something wrong?"

"Oh, no, nothing! Just bumped myself. It hurts a bit!"

Sophie looked at Tyler with teary eyes, hinting for him to help soothe the pain.

But Tyler's attention was already on the sketches.

Most were unclear, the later ones more so, some barely depicting features, just half-figures, or mere dark smudges.

Still, Tyler studied each one, not missing any detail. Especially when he saw an image of himself in a wheelchair, gazing somberly out a window, his eyes flickered with a complex emotion.

Being born with limitations, his father had abandoned him early on. In his bleak childhood, his mother was his only support until he was twenty, when Olivia Stewart entered his life as his first glimpse of hope.

If Olivia's departure and memory loss were connected to his mother, what would he do?

Lost in thought, Tyler didn't notice Sophie's growing frustration beside him.

Why was he so captivated by a bunch of blurry drawings?

Sophie seethed inwardly. She intended these drawings to show Tyler that Olivia had been involved with a man years ago—that her life was a mess!

Apparently, this cold guy needed a little more motivation!

Sophie casually remarked, "You know, these are from years ago. My sister has a new sponsor now, but she's still hung up on these past affairs. If her current patron found out... Oh, my loose lips!"

She abruptly stopped, covering her mouth as if regretting her words.

What a performance!

Voice and expression perfectly executed. No wonder she's a trained actress!

But Sophie forgot that sitting beside her was an acting master, one who wouldn't be easily fooled.
