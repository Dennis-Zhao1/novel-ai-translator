In the bustling world of scandal and social media, Daniel Johnson found himself at the center of attention, but for all the wrong reasons. He squinted at the retreating crowd, a victorious grin spreading across his face. "You think you can beat me? Please, I've been in this game longer than any of you!"

Once the coast was clear, Daniel hurriedly wheeled himself back to his hospital room, eager to check his Twitter feed. Sure enough, his account was blowing up with comments—most of them far from kind. "Why am I getting blamed for Emily Young's shameless antics?" he grumbled to himself.

The internet was ablaze with a scandalous video of Emily, now heavily pixelated to spare the public from its indecency. The netizens had already made up their minds about Emily Young, and she was public enemy number one. Naturally, Daniel, her husband, wasn't far behind on the hate list. They even had a catchy nickname for the duo: "The Shameless Pair."

Daniel's past sins were dragged into the spotlight—how he had once betrayed an ex-girlfriend for a few moments of tabloid fame, only to hook up with her best friend. The ex's name was mercifully left out, leaving Daniel to bear the brunt of the outrage alone. Despite the chaos, his Twitter following skyrocketed, turning him into an unlikely influencer.

"That woman's a nightmare," he muttered, scrolling through the vitriol aimed at him. "She screws up, and I get the heat?"

Just as Daniel was about to draft a post shifting all the blame onto Emily, a peculiar comment caught his eye: "Hey there, Mr. Shameless! I'm not here to insult you. I'm here to make you rich. Interested in a business deal? Add me on WhatsApp!"

Skeptical but intrigued, Daniel couldn't shake the lure of easy money. Against his better judgment, he added the user and struck up a conversation. Turns out, Mr. Wang, the potential business partner, wanted to advertise on Daniel's infamous Twitter page. Even if the followers were haters, the engagement was through the roof.

Daniel chuckled at the absurdity of it all. An ad deal born from infamy—who would've thought? He agreed without hesitation. "Who cares about dignity when there's cash on the table?" he mused.

With a deal inked and a hefty advance in his pocket, Daniel leaned into his notoriety. He shared more scandalous stories, even spilling the beans on Emily's indiscretions. Meanwhile, Emily was left isolated in the hospital, her reputation shattered, and her parents disowning her.

When Emily finally got out of the hospital, she was furious to learn that Daniel had only visited their newborn once and declared he wanted nothing to do with the baby. Ignoring her postpartum fatigue, she stormed into Daniel's room, ready to confront him.

"Daniel Johnson, get out here now!" she bellowed, her voice echoing through the halls. Daniel barely glanced up from his phone, too engrossed in his Twitter feed to care.

Emily snatched the phone from his hands and flung it across the room. "Explain yourself! You don't want the child?"

Daniel scoffed, "You dare shout at me? Explain your dirty laundry first!" He retaliated with a slap, the sound echoing in the room, leaving Emily stunned.

Her face reddened with anger and pain, Emily could hardly believe it. "You hit me?"

"Yeah, I did," Daniel replied, unfazed. "We're divorced, remember? You kicked me out with nothing. You think I'll just keep taking your crap?"

Emily was momentarily speechless. She had always been the one in control, but now Daniel was fighting back, and it threw her off balance.

"You..." Emily pointed at him, her confidence wavering.

Daniel seized the moment. "Pick up my phone! You break it, you buy me a new one!"

Emily simply sneered, stomped over to the phone, and crushed it under her heel. "Oops."

"You've lost it, Emily!" Daniel yelled, scrambling to his feet, his wheelchair spinning wildly before crashing into the wall.

Emily stood over him, her foot pressing painfully on his injured leg. "That child is yours, Daniel. You can’t just walk away. I'm not spending my youth raising a kid alone. The baby’s in the nursery. Do what you want with it."

With that, Emily stormed out, leaving Daniel struggling on the floor.

Once a nurse helped him back into his wheelchair, Daniel borrowed a phone and shared Emily's words on Twitter, sparking another wave of internet buzz. Despite the chaos, Daniel reveled in the attention. Money was money, after all.

Meanwhile, their newborn lay alone in the hospital, abandoned by both parents, destined to navigate a world where neither love nor care awaited. As Emily left the hospital, she was met with a barrage of rotten vegetables and insults, a fitting farewell from a world that had turned its back on her.
