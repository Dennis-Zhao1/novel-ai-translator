In the dimly lit hallway of a swanky apartment complex, Olivia Stewart clung to the doorframe like her life depended on it. "Ethan King, stop it already! I don't want to go with you! Let go!"

Ethan King, his eyes wild and bloodshot, looked like a man possessed. "You'd rather be a secret affair than come with me? You'd rather love him than me? Do you think I'm not man enough for you? I'll show you!"

With a sudden movement, Ethan spun Olivia around, pressing her against the doorframe. He grabbed her chin, forcing her to look up at him, and kissed her with an intensity that left no room for protest.

The kiss was surprisingly soft and sweet, a fleeting moment of tenderness in the tempest of chaos. But for Ethan, it was like an electric shock, sending a jolt through his body that awakened something primal within him.

He kissed her harder, like a desperate wolf who hadn't eaten in days. Olivia turned her head away, but Ethan's grip on her jaw was unyielding, leaving her with no choice but to clench her teeth and endure.

Just then, Isabella Peterson stormed up the stairs, catching sight of the fiery scene. Her eyes flashed with rage as she charged forward, yanking Ethan off Olivia and delivering a punch that sent him crashing into the wall with a thud.

"Crazy!" Olivia gasped, rushing to Ethan's side as he lay motionless on the floor, blood trickling from his nose.

"Stop right there!" Isabella's voice was icy and commanding, freezing Olivia in her tracks. "If you go to him now, don't ever come back to me."

Olivia turned to face Isabella, whose eyes burned with cold fury. Must it come to this? Why did everyone keep pushing her to choose?

She glanced back at Ethan, who lay there, his face a mask of blood and bruises. She couldn't just leave him like this. With a final, sorrowful look at Isabella, Olivia turned her back and moved towards Ethan.

Isabella's fists clenched, her knuckles white with tension. "You dare?"

Olivia's mind was made up. She cared more about a life than the drama unfolding. She ran to Ethan, kneeling beside him and cradling his head in her lap. "Ethan, are you okay?" she whispered.

With a groan, Ethan coughed up some blood and slowly opened his eyes. He had heard her choice, and it filled his gaze with a newfound light. Olivia, frantic and guilt-ridden, helped him sit up. "I'm so sorry, Ethan. This is all my fault. I'll get you to a hospital right away."

Ethan caught Olivia's wrist, his eyes filled with a tenderness he no longer needed to hide. "Don't worry, I'm okay. I don't regret anything."

Olivia looked away, her heart aching. She couldn't bear to imagine what Isabella's face looked like right now, but she couldn't abandon Ethan either. He had once stayed by her side through her darkest hours, so how could she turn her back on him now?

Isabella approached them, each step a heavy toll, like the ominous chime of a clock. Olivia looked up, meeting Isabella's gaze, which was now devoid of anger, replaced by an unsettling calm.

"Step aside," Isabella's voice was as cold as ice. 

"No," Olivia replied firmly, though her body trembled with fear. She had never seen Isabella so furious, but she stood her ground, protecting Ethan. She knew he wouldn't stand a chance against Isabella.

Isabella stopped just a step away, towering over them with an unreadable expression. Olivia remained resolute, refusing to budge.

Ethan struggled to his feet, clutching his chest in pain. "Olivia, move. I love you, and even if he kills me, I won't regret a thing. I can be the man you want."

He coughed violently, blood staining his lips. Olivia quickly supported him. "Please, don't speak."

Isabella, you brute, she thought, glaring at him. 

Isabella's gaze chilled further, her voice cutting through the air. "Olivia, you have an ex-boyfriend, a first love, and now you're tangled up with your so-called best friend. Besides me, how many other men do you have?"

Olivia reeled, stunned by the accusation. "What are you saying?" she stammered.

"How many?" he repeated, each word like a hailstone.

Olivia felt pierced by his words, struggling to comprehend their meaning. It took her a moment to regain her voice. "If that's what you think of me, I have nothing to say."

Supporting Ethan, she turned to leave. "Let's go."

Ethan cast a sympathetic glance at Olivia, then his eyes fell on a credit card on the table. "Olivia, now you know where you stand with him. Give him back the card, end this ridiculous lease agreement, and be free."

Both Olivia and Isabella looked at the card. So that's what their meeting was about.

With a bitter laugh, Isabella spoke before Olivia could. "Olivia, I've given you a chance. Since you choose that wimp, don't bother coming back. Our lease is void! Remember, I'm the one who doesn't want you!"

Tears welled in Olivia's eyes, but she fought them back. When she first moved into this place, all she wanted was to escape. Now, hearing the lease was over, why did it hurt so much?

She never expected to feel this way, to fall so quickly. And now, to be dismissed so coldly by Isabella.

Taking a deep breath to hold back the tears, Olivia felt a sharp pain in her chest, like shards of glass cutting into every breath.

Even breathing hurt. So it was true.

Isabella watched her pain, instinctively wanting to comfort her, but Ethan was already there, holding Olivia close.

Isabella's hand clenched into a fist as he turned to leave.

Olivia wiped her tears, calling after him, "Isabella, what about the bracelet? The one you borrowed?"

Her voice was shaky, betraying her attempt at strength.

Isabella's lips thinned, his eyes dark with an icy resolve. He turned slightly, offering a mocking smile. "Do you think I'd carry such a trinket with me?"

Olivia flinched at his scorn, speechless, as if her throat was filled with thorns.
