Olivia Stewart's hand paused for a moment before she gently patted little Tommy's back, soothing him with a soft rhythm. The poor kid had been through a lot, and even though Isabella Peterson was standing right there, Olivia figured she'd deal with his mood later.

Isabella stood silently at the doorway, his eyes filled with a whirlpool of emotions as he watched the dirty little boy clinging to Olivia. It was as if Tommy's presence had opened a door to a part of his heart he rarely visited.

Once Tommy was calm, Olivia whispered a few comforting words to him before preparing to leave. "See you, Olivia!" Tommy called out, a rare smile lighting up his face.

"Goodbye, Tommy! I'll come back to visit you soon," Olivia promised, planting a quick, affectionate peck on his cheek. As she looked up, she caught Isabella watching her intently from the doorway. Quickly, she released Tommy and walked over to him.

"Isabella, I—" she started, but Isabella just turned and walked away. Clearly, he was upset. Being jealous of a child hugging her was one thing, but she had kissed Tommy too, which must have sent his jealousy into overdrive.

Olivia hurried after him, barely having time to nod goodbye to Mrs. Brooks, the caretaker, as she rushed out of the Angel House orphanage.

In the car, Olivia tried to explain, "Isabella, I didn't mean anything by it. Tommy just seems so lonely. He needs someone to care for him!"

"Is that what you thought back then too?" Isabella asked, his question hanging in the air like a riddle.

Olivia was taken aback. What was he talking about? Judging by Isabella's expression, she realized he might be referring to his own troubled past. He'd had heart issues as a child, and White Echo—someone from his past—had taken care of him during that time. Seeing Tommy must have reminded him of those days.

But Olivia wasn't sure if she was White Echo. Even if she was, she’d forgotten all about it, and there was no telling what White Echo had felt back then.

Isabella seemed to think he'd hit the mark with his question. His eyes filled with a look of pain, and he clenched his fists tightly, turning his face to the window.

Seeing that hurt in his eyes was like a dagger to Olivia's heart. She instinctively leaned into him, placing her small hand over his heart. His surgery had left no visible scars, and anyone who didn't know him would never guess he’d once been so sick.

"I'm sorry, Isabella. I've forgotten, so I can't answer your question," Olivia said softly, resting her head against his chest, comforted by the strong, steady beat of his heart. "But seeing Tommy, I couldn't help but think of your childhood. It makes me feel... not pity, but a deep sadness."

Isabella's rigid posture softened slightly as he wrapped an arm around her. Olivia noticed a glint in his eyes, like tears that vanished before they could fall.

Her heart ached even more, and she hugged him tightly, like a child clinging to a beloved teddy bear. They didn't speak, but the air in the car warmed, filled with a gentle tenderness and a hint of sweet serenity.

Olivia's grip around Isabella's waist tightened unconsciously. No matter if she was the White Echo of his past or not, from that day forward, she vowed to love him with all her heart.

Feeling her warmth and the soft rhythm of her breathing, Isabella looked down at her with a teasing glint in his eyes. "Oh, so eager? Or do you just like the feel of the car?"

Michael Wright, their driver, smirked as he raised the privacy screen between the front and back seats.

Whatever tenderness Olivia felt was quickly replaced by embarrassment. She sat up and playfully punched Isabella's shoulder. "Cut it out! Who's eager? You think everyone's like you?"

Isabella leaned back, amused, and let her punches rain down like a gentle patter of rain. "Okay, okay, it's me who's eager. Should we pull over? Or is this just fine?"

"Fine, my foot!" Olivia exclaimed, jumping back to put some distance between them.

Isabella chuckled, pulling her back into his arms effortlessly. "You think you can escape?"

Olivia panicked. "Isabella, are you serious?"

She might have become a bit bold under his teasing, but this was crossing a line!

Isabella kissed her forehead with a playful grin. "Just a hug."

Olivia sighed in relief, but then his hands started wandering, and she squirmed. "Hey, weren't you just going to hug?"

"That's all I'm doing!" Isabella replied shamelessly, continuing his playful exploration.

Olivia tried to wriggle free, but it was no use. Suddenly, Isabella held her tighter, his voice a deep whisper in her ear. "Little fox, move again, and I won't be so gentle."

She froze, obediently leaning against him, enduring his teasing.

"What do you want to do next weekend?" Isabella suddenly asked.

Next weekend? Was he planning something?

Olivia turned to look at him, surprised to see him avoiding her gaze. "Well, I don't have any special plans. I like shopping, eating, and visiting the orphanage. I didn't spend enough time with the kids this weekend. I want to see Tommy again."

Realizing she might have overstepped, Olivia glanced at Isabella nervously, but he seemed unaffected. Relieved, she relaxed back into her seat.

"I'll come with you," Isabella said, playing with her fingers absentmindedly.

"You'll come with me?" Olivia was taken aback. Isabella had never shown much interest in these things. Why now?

"Isabella, why are you suddenly so nice to me?"

Isabella's brows knitted as he retorted, "What do you mean suddenly? Haven't I always been good to you?"

"That's different. Before, you were kind in your way, like caring for a pet. But now, you're willing to do things you don't like for my sake. Why?"

Isabella turned away, his voice a mix of irritation and affection. "Didn't someone once say I've never truly entered her heart, never cared about her likes or wants? Now I'm trying to give you the life you want, and you're still complaining?"

Despite his gruff words, his eyes were soft with fondness.

Olivia was at a loss for words. Isabella, the proud and aloof heir, was lowering himself to share her world, just to reach her heart. What more could she ask for?

"Isabella!" Olivia threw herself into his arms, her voice choked with emotion.

Isabella resumed his usual nonchalant demeanor. "Don't get too mushy. I'm just aiming to win your heart, so you can't leave me."

Olivia smiled shyly, feeling her heart swell with warmth. "Don't worry, even if it means flying into the fire, I'd still choose you."

She wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him, her eyes fluttering shut.

Two small flames flickered in Isabella's eyes as he murmured, "Olivia, you're offering yourself up, don't blame me for taking advantage."

With that, he claimed her lips, leading the dance with a commanding passion.

Michael discreetly steered the car into a secluded lane, stopping beneath the shade of tall trees, giving the couple their privacy.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow over the horizon, Olivia rested against Isabella, exhausted but content. Her hair clung to her damp forehead, framing a face flushed with both exertion and shyness.

Isabella, unable to resist, started to move again.

Olivia pressed a weak hand against his chest, her voice barely a whisper, "No more."

He looked down at her, trying to quell the fire within. Gently, he draped his jacket over her, murmuring, "Rest, love."

Olivia's cheeks burned with embarrassment as she closed her eyes, trying to forget her impulsive actions. She had just thrown herself at Isabella—in a car, no less!

Oh, the mortification!
