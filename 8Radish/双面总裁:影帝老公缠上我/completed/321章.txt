Title: A Truth Unintentionally Revealed

"Jason White!"

Olivia Stewart called out his name for the first time, instead of the usual detached 'Mr. White.'

"All you did was contribute one little cell. Big deal! Frankly, it was just the result of your momentary pleasure. Over the years, have you supported me in any way? Fulfilled any fatherly duty? So, please, stop pretending to be my father. I'm Olivia Stewart, and I have nothing to do with the White family!"

"Nothing to do with the White family? Ha! Keep dreaming!"

Jason White, agitated by Olivia’s defiance, dropped his previous pretense, showing his true, sinister colors. He pointed angrily at Olivia’s face and sneered:

"Olivia, don’t think too highly of yourself! No matter how you came to be, or whether I was around or not, blood is blood. You have White blood in your veins, and nothing you say can change that!"

Jason, with a smug look, pulled a button-shaped device from his collar, waving it in front of Olivia. "I’ve recorded everything. You, ignoring your own father's pleas on video! You and Isabella Peterson, both being public figures—aren’t you afraid I’ll ruin you?"

Olivia narrowed her eyes. "Are you threatening me?"

Jason straightened his neck, "I just want you to save Chloe Wright. Or have Isabella Peterson give me money to rebuild White Corp! His Peterson Group is wealthy. Besides, it was his doing that brought White Corp down!"

Olivia chuckled softly, "Do you believe that if you rebuild, I won’t have him bring you down again?"

"You...!" Jason’s face turned a shade of livid as he fumed, "You ungrateful daughter! I swear, I’ll..."

Before Jason could raise his hand, Olivia’s bodyguards, who had been patiently observing, intervened and restrained him. Realizing he was on Isabella’s turf, Jason's expression shifted, and he tried to compose himself.

"Olivia, I lost my temper. I apologize. But we share a bloodline, and family doesn’t hold grudges overnight. By the way, that video is already sent. You wouldn't want the whole city to know about this, would you?"

His words were cleverly crafted to make Olivia back down gracefully.

Olivia, however, saw through him. She looked at him with cold disdain.

One of the bodyguards glanced at Jason’s recording device and assured Olivia, "Don’t worry, Olivia. We can trace the signal and destroy the original file."

A hint of panic flashed across Jason’s face as he clutched the device tightly.

Olivia smirked, "Let him go. Let everyone see just how low my so-called father would stoop for money."

Jason’s face turned various shades of blue and red. Intimidated by the bodyguards, he said nothing more.

Olivia turned to leave and found young Tommy, who had quietly gotten out of the car, watching her intently.

Olivia smiled warmly and patted Tommy’s head, "Come on, let’s get back in the car!"

Suddenly, Tommy dashed towards Jason and bit him fiercely on the leg.

"Ow!" Jason shrieked, shaking Tommy off and cursing, "You little brat! Where did you come from?"

Tommy, small and light, was easily thrown back, landing on the ground.

"Tommy!" Olivia rushed over to help him up.

The bodyguards promptly restrained Jason, awaiting Olivia’s instructions.

Seething with anger, Olivia approached Jason and demanded, "What right do you have to call him a brat? How dare you say he’s a stray? Tommy is my son! You owe him an apology! Now!"

"What did you say? This kid..." Jason was visibly shocked, his eyes darting. "Does Isabella Peterson know?"

Olivia sneered, "Think you can threaten me with that? Not a chance. Isabella’s known for a long time..."

Her voice trailed off, and she paled as the realization hit her.

Oh no, she hadn’t told Tommy yet!

Olivia worriedly glanced at Tommy, who remained stoic, seemingly unfazed by the revelation.

Jason, misinterpreting Olivia’s reaction, laughed triumphantly, "My dear Olivia, are you suggesting this boy isn’t Isabella’s? If that’s the case..."

"Jason White!" Olivia roared, covering Tommy’s ears. "Shut up! If you don’t want the White family to meet a miserable end, keep your mouth shut!"

Her eyes blazed with fury, like a volcano on the brink of eruption.

Jason, cowed by Olivia’s fierce demeanor, fell silent.

He glanced nervously at the bodyguards, who had resumed their positions, seemingly indifferent to the exchange. Surely, they must have heard.

Realizing the gravity of the situation, Jason broke into a cold sweat. What he thought was leverage could turn into the White family's downfall!

Without another word, Jason fled.

Olivia was too drained to stop him. She regretted her outburst, fearing it had ruined her bond with Tommy.

She was terrified Tommy wouldn’t understand or accept the truth, and all the trust they had built would vanish.

But now... it was all a mess!

Blaming herself, Olivia felt a mix of anger and despair, her body trembling uncontrollably.

Tommy, noticing Olivia’s distress, gently tugged her towards the car.

Once inside, buckled up, Olivia struggled to calm down. She knew she wasn’t in the right state to drive.

Taking deep breaths, she turned to Tommy.

The little boy remained calm. Olivia, encouraged by his demeanor, tentatively reached out to touch his head.

Tommy didn’t pull away, giving Olivia a glimmer of hope.

She hesitated, then softly asked, "Tommy, did you understand what we were talking about?"

Tommy nodded.

Olivia’s heart skipped a beat.

"Do you... blame me?"

The word "mom" felt foreign as it left her lips.

Tommy was silent for a long time, and Olivia’s heart sank further with each passing second.

Just as Olivia was about to lose hope, Tommy shook his head gently.

Olivia’s heart soared, overwhelmed with relief. She hugged Tommy tightly, her voice choked with emotion:

"Tommy, you don’t know how much I’ve worried about telling you this. I never found the right time. But, Tommy, you’re still young, and the past is complicated. Until we officially announce the truth, can you call me Auntie Olivia and Isabella Uncle Isabella? Is that okay?"

Tommy nodded again, though his eyes dimmed for a moment, hidden beneath his long lashes.

Feeling the weight of guilt lift slightly, Olivia smiled as she buckled him in.

"Alright, let's go buy some medicine, then stock up on all the toys and snacks you love. Sound good?"

Tommy pursed his lips and pointed ahead, signaling her to drive.

With that, Olivia and Tommy went on their shopping spree, while Jason, having failed to get Olivia to donate a kidney, trudged dejectedly back to the hospital...
