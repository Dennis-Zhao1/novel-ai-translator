Sophie nearly dropped her glass of water when she heard the word "child."

"Child?" she exclaimed, eyes wide with shock.

Olivia, looking a bit embarrassed, replied, "Yeah, it's a bit fuzzy, but I think I might have been pregnant once. I can't remember what happened to the baby, though."

"Let me think," Sophie said, putting on a thoughtful expression while her mind raced. She recalled a weekend from her youth when she returned home to find her father angrily scolding Olivia. It was something about being shameless. Olivia had left school soon after, supposedly sick, and their father had sent her away to the countryside to recover for a year. Sophie realized now that Olivia had been pregnant, not sick.

Sophie felt a surge of triumph at discovering Olivia's secret, but she kept her face neutral. "Do you remember anything else?" Olivia pressed, looking hopeful.

"Are you sure you were pregnant?" Sophie asked cautiously.

"I think so. But after that, everything is a blur. I got kicked out of med school, and my mind was all over the place," Olivia said, shaking her head.

Sophie smirked inwardly. Olivia hadn't left school to save on tuition; she was kicked out. "I really don't know about any child," Sophie fibbed, playing innocent.

Olivia looked disappointed.

"But I'm curious," Sophie added mischievously. "Who was the father?"

Olivia's eyebrows knitted together. "What are you implying, Sophie?"

"Well, back then, rumors were flying that you had a sugar daddy. Maybe the kid was his?" Sophie suggested.

Olivia's face turned pale. "I never dared to tell Isabella about the child. If he knew I lost his baby…"

"What? Isabella was the sugar daddy?" Sophie asked incredulously.

Olivia shot her a look. "Isabella had a heart condition. I took care of him for a few months."

Sophie was burning with jealousy. So Olivia and Isabella had been involved even back then!

"Well, it might not be!" Sophie insisted. "You were dating Christopher at the time. The child could be his!"

"No, I remember clearly. Before Isabella's surgery, we… It was my first time," Olivia whispered, her cheeks flushed.

"Once? It doesn't happen that easily. You might have forgotten. Maybe after Isabella left, you and Christopher rekindled things?" Sophie suggested.

Olivia bit her lip, looking troubled. If the child had been Christopher's, she couldn't face Isabella.

Sophie watched Olivia's distress with satisfaction, already plotting how to use this information.

Meanwhile, Isabella was driving when he overheard Olivia mention a child. He nearly swerved off the road. The sisters' conversation had been broadcasted to him word for word. Isabella felt suffocated.

He pulled over, gripping the steering wheel tightly. Normally, he'd be done with it all, but Olivia was different. He'd learned to trust and love her.

After calming himself, Isabella decided to drive to Sophie's apartment, determined to bring Olivia home.

When he arrived, Olivia was gone. He went up to see Sophie.

"Do you know anything about Olivia's pregnancy?" Isabella asked directly, his gaze intense.

Sophie hesitated. Isabella's sudden inquiry caught her off guard. "Well, yes, but the child wasn't yours. It was her boyfriend's," she blurted out, her heart pounding.

"Where's the child?" Isabella's voice was low and dangerous.

"I don't know. Maybe it was aborted or given away. I only knew Olivia was sent away for a while," Sophie said, trembling.

Isabella left without another word.

Back home, he found Olivia gazing out the window, looking pensive. His anger faded. No matter her past, her happiness was what mattered.

"Olivia!" he called softly.

Olivia brightened and rushed to him. "Isabella, you're back!"

He stroked her hair, pondering whether her clinginess was due to sadness or guilt.

"You should go back to the film set tomorrow," he suggested. "Even if you've remembered some things, our love story continues."

"Okay," Olivia agreed, hoping to glean more memories as the story unfolded.

Later, in the study, Isabella set aside the envelope containing information about Olivia's past. The situation was complicated, and he needed to tread carefully.

He decided to involve David in finding out what happened to Olivia's child. Michael, his mother's chosen bodyguard, had failed to turn up any leads. It was time to see what David, his own trusted ally, could discover.

Three days later, David returned with his findings. Documents confirmed Olivia had been pregnant, and a faded abortion consent form bore her signature.

Isabella's heart sank. Olivia had really been pregnant with another man's child.

But then he noticed the dates. The pregnancy coincided with his time with Olivia. Could the child have been his?

His heart raced with a mix of hope and fear. He needed answers.

"Get Michael for me," he instructed David, ready to unravel the truth.
