The gym was echoing with the rhythmic sound of weights clanking as Olivia Stewart twisted a towel in her hands, her mind elsewhere. Isabella Peterson, with her deep, captivating eyes, watched her with amusement.

"Are you planning to strangle that towel or me?" Isabella's voice broke through Olivia's thoughts, bringing her back to the present.

"Oh, no, no! I meant, I'll help you wipe off the sweat!" Olivia stammered, flustered.

"Make sure you get every sweaty spot," Isabella instructed, her tone playful yet demanding.

"Okay," Olivia replied absentmindedly, not realizing the mischievous glint in Isabella's eyes. It wasn't until much later that Olivia understood just how cunning Isabella could be.

Standing on her tiptoes, Olivia began to dab away the sweat glistening on Isabella's forehead. The faint scent of Isabella's cologne wafted through the air, intoxicating Olivia for a moment. She was so close that she could see the fine details of Isabella's features, appreciating the choice of outfit for Isabella—one that Olivia had once thought was merely functional.

Isabella took a deep breath, savoring the closeness and the gentle touch. As Olivia's hand moved down, Isabella's eyes caught the curve of her lips, and he couldn't help but think, "Yep, this outfit looks fantastic."

Olivia tried to maintain her composure as she finished wiping Isabella's forehead, moving on to the rest of her face. Her fingers brushed against Isabella's strong nose, tracing down to her lips, which were just a shade of pink that seemed almost inviting.

In that moment, Olivia realized just how entrancing Isabella was. It wasn't just the outward appearance but something deeper that pulled her in. Her heart fluttered as she took in Isabella's features up close, blushing when her gaze lingered a bit too long on those lips.

"All done!" Olivia declared, retreating quickly to swap the towel, hoping her clumsy attempts at masking her embarrassment weren't too obvious.

Isabella watched her with a knowing smile, thoroughly enjoying the effect he had on her. He leaned back, exuding confidence. "You know you can't resist this."

Olivia returned with a fresh towel, trying to ignore the teasing spark in Isabella's eyes. She focused intently on her task, avoiding direct eye contact, hoping to maintain her composure.

"Careful, you're playing with fire," Isabella's voice was a low, teasing rumble as Olivia's fingers accidentally brushed against his adam’s apple, sending a shiver down her spine.

"Uh... maybe I should stop," she mumbled, cheeks flushed with a mix of embarrassment and something more.

Before she could escape, Isabella caught her hand, pulling her back. "Leaving things half-finished isn't a good habit, Olivia."

"Well, I..." Olivia hesitated, her resolve wavering under Isabella's intense gaze.

With a swift motion, Isabella peeled off her tank top, revealing a sculpted torso that seemed to be chiseled by the gods themselves. Olivia's eyes widened, mesmerized by the sight.

"Wow, those abs..." she thought, unable to tear her gaze away.

"Curious about the rest?" Isabella teased, noticing where her eyes lingered.

Caught off guard, Olivia's face turned beet red. "I was just... a little curious, that's all," she stammered, trying to play it off.

With a deliberate slowness, Isabella guided her hand along the defined lines of his waist, letting her feel the strength beneath the skin. Olivia's heart raced, and she quickly pulled her hand back, the heat in her cheeks intensifying.

Isabella chuckled softly, clearly enjoying the playful banter. "Just wiping sweat, right?" he teased, as Olivia fumbled with the towel, wiping indiscriminately across his chest like she was painting a masterpiece.

"Done!" she announced, stepping back, realizing she'd been caught up in the moment.

Isabella glanced down at himself. "Halfway there, Olivia. You missed a spot."

Seeing no end to Isabella's teasing, Olivia huffed, "I think you've had enough of my services for today!" and darted away, leaving Isabella chuckling at her retreating form.

"Come back here, protector!" Isabella called, settling onto the bench press. Olivia hesitated but eventually returned, wondering how this workout session had turned into such an unexpected ordeal.

As Isabella lay back, preparing to lift, Olivia stood by, ready to assist. She couldn't help but recall the story of Isabella and E, a woman who had once been in her position, and felt a pang of jealousy.

"Closer, Olivia," Isabella instructed, his gaze locking onto hers, a teasing glint in his eyes.

Olivia leaned in, trying to ignore the way her heart skipped at the proximity. As she focused on her task, Isabella's eyes held a mischievous sparkle, clearly enjoying the little game they were playing.

"Don't worry," Isabella said, his voice carrying a hint of unspoken promises. "As long as you don't say 'stop,' I'll keep going."

"Stop!" Olivia blurted out, relieved to put an end to the tension. But as she relaxed, she stumbled forward, landing unceremoniously on top of Isabella.

Their eyes met, and in that moment, everything seemed to freeze. There was a spark, a connection that neither could deny.

Before Olivia could react, Isabella's hand was at the back of her head, holding her in place. Her heart pounded, caught between surprise and a thrill she couldn't quite name.

For a second, Olivia was too stunned to move, feeling Isabella's heartbeat beneath her fingertips. There was something exhilarating about being this close, something that made her question everything she thought she knew.

Isabella's eyes held hers, and she realized that maybe, just maybe, she'd already fallen for him long ago.
