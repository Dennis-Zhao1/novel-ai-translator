Chapter 1: Secrets in Shadows

Olivia Stewart felt her heart hammering as she finally spoke, her voice just above a whisper. “Ethan, I’m sorry. I know you're worried about me, but I…”

“Are you really okay with living in Isabella Peterson's shadow forever? Being a secret, a stand-in?” Ethan King cut her off, his voice filled with anger and desperation, fearing her answer would break him.

Olivia flinched, stepping back, her eyes wide and glistening with tears as she looked up at Ethan. Was this really the same Ethan, her friend who always had her back, who was now hurling these sharp words at her?

Ethan’s face softened, realizing his outburst. “I’m sorry, Olivia, I didn’t mean to…”

Olivia gave a small, tearful smile. “Ethan, I know you’re just scared I’ll get hurt. Don’t worry, I’m not mad at you. We’re still best friends. As for Isabella…”

She paused, and the silence stretched between them like eternity.

“I’ll leave him once the lease is up, once I get my mom’s bracelet back, once I finish this project,” Olivia promised, more to herself than to Ethan.

Ethan’s shoulders slumped. “You should head back.”

It was late, and he worried about what Isabella might do if Olivia didn’t return.

Olivia turned away silently, leaving Ethan standing by the dining table, watching her go.

At the door, Michael Wright stepped aside, greeting her with a formal nod. “Olivia, please.”

She glared at him sharply. Michael quickly caught on, bowing his head, “I didn’t see anything, Olivia, if you come with me right now.”

Olivia ignored him, rolling her eyes as she walked out, with Michael trailing nervously behind her, afraid to lose sight of her.

Ethan remained, staring at the door long after she left. Suddenly, he grabbed a bottle of wine and started drinking straight from it, something he never did. He drank with a desperation he didn’t know he had, trying to drown out the thoughts of Olivia and the man she seemed to be tied to.

The wine bottle fell, crimson liquid spreading across the floor. Ethan slumped into a chair, whispering her name over and over, “Olivia… Olivia…”

Meanwhile, Olivia slipped back into her lavish residence, moving quickly through the grand hall. Lucas Wright met her, bowing slightly, “You’re back, Olivia?”

“Shh!” Olivia put a finger to her lips, shooting him a look. “Are you trying to get me killed?”

Lucas immediately fell silent.

“Is he back?” she whispered, nodding toward the stairs.

Lucas nodded, a hint of sympathy in his eyes. “You better hurry. He was upset earlier.”

Olivia shivered involuntarily.

Lucas tried to reassure her, “Don’t worry too much. He’s already broken everything that could be broken. Just talk to him calmly. Besides, he wouldn’t throw you out.”

Maybe not throw her out, but he’d surely make her life difficult.

Thinking of the confrontation ahead made her legs weak, but she steadied herself as Lucas offered support, “The noise stopped a while ago. Maybe he’s in his study. You should take a shower, wear something nice…”

“Enough with the advice! I’ll handle it. If things get bad, you’ll come help, right?”

“Of course!”

Lucas nodded vigorously, grinning like a mischievous Buddha, though he knew better than to intervene in their spats.

Once Olivia was upstairs, Lucas quietly slipped away. She tiptoed down the hall, approaching her room with caution. The door was slightly ajar, and she peered through the crack. Isabella wasn’t there—fortunate for her.

Relieved, Olivia tiptoed inside and headed straight for the bathroom.

She wasn’t preparing for Isabella’s return, but checking the mirror.

“Oh my gosh!” Olivia groaned, seeing her swollen lips. “Ethan said it wasn’t too bad? What was he looking at? What did that guy do? It’s still swollen!”

In her frustration, she bit her lip, reopening a small wound. “Ouch!”

“Darn you, Isabella!” she muttered.

Isabella entered the room just as she swore loudly. He frowned, spotting her silhouette through the frosted glass door. He sat quietly, waiting.

Unaware of his presence, Olivia finished venting, finally relaxing when she heard no response.

What was she going to do? She stomped her foot in frustration, noticing a faint lemon scent lingering.

Seriously? Even after eating a whole meal?

She tried brushing her teeth furiously, hoping to get rid of the smell. After what felt like forever, she finally noticed it fading.

Satisfied, Olivia left the bathroom, not realizing Isabella was already in the room, watching her every move like a predator waiting for its prey.

Chapter 2: Confrontation in the Shadows

The room was dim, shadows blurring the edges of everything. Olivia didn’t dare turn on the light, inching forward cautiously.

Isabella sat in the middle of the room, legs crossed, arms folded, his eyes cold and fixed on her as she emerged like a cautious mouse.

He waited silently, ready to pounce.
