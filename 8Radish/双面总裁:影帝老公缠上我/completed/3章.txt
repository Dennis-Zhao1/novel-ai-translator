The Kiss Loan

It was an awkward, unpracticed kiss, but somehow it carried a sweet, innocent charm that instantly captivated Isabella Peterson. Something inside him burst open in a dazzling display, like fireworks lighting up the night sky. Despite his usual aloofness, this unexpected encounter with Olivia Stewart effortlessly breached his defenses.

Footsteps echoed rapidly behind them, but Olivia Stewart, catching a glimpse of the retreating security team, breathed a sigh of relief. She'd managed to slip away undetected, or so she thought. 

In a sudden twist, the man she'd been using as a shield—none other than Isabella—turned the tables. In a swift motion, he pinned her against the wall, one hand securely at her side, the other tilting her head back. He claimed her lips with a commanding fervor that left her breathless and dazed.

Olivia's mind blanked as his overwhelming presence enveloped her senses. Minutes passed before she realized she had unwittingly invited this intimate invasion.

"Is this all part of the act? Or did you actually enjoy it?" she thought, struggling to regain control. But the more she resisted, the more determined Isabella became.

"Dang it, did I run into a perv?" Olivia fumed, flailing her arms in a futile attempt to escape. Her efforts only earned her a stronger hold and a soft thud against the wall.

Desperate, Olivia bit down. But Isabella was like a nimble fish, dancing out of reach and leaving her increasingly frustrated and sore.

I fell for it again! she realized, feeling utterly played by this man's superior skill. Exhausted, she slumped against the wall, surrendering to his relentless assault.

Isabella, sensing her submission, softened his approach, transforming from a forceful wave into a gentle caress, playing out a cinematic romance against the wall.

When he finally relented, Olivia gasped for air. Her senses returned in the now-empty hallway, and she made a move to flee, only to be pulled back into his embrace.

"You could at least thank me for helping you avoid them," Isabella's voice rumbled above her.

"Thank you," she blurted, caught off guard by the suggestion.

His deep laughter resonated through her, leaving her cheeks burning. She scolded herself internally, Why am I thanking him when he's the one who took advantage of me? It's like being bitten by a stray dog!

Determined to escape, Olivia ducked her head and made for the exit, only to be yanked back again. 

"I already said thanks! What more do you want?" she demanded.

"More," Isabella replied, his eyes lingering hungrily on her lips. This little sweetheart was far too intriguing. As the saying goes, a loan of a kiss from the uncle! Ha!

"You..." Olivia stammered, her eyes widening in shock. "Isabella Peterson!"

The infamous uncle! Realizing her slip, Olivia quickly covered her mouth with her hands.

Isabella's gaze fell on the slender wrist adorned with a bracelet she always wore, a sly grin playing on his lips. This girl was full of surprises, changing her appearance so quickly and convincingly. If not for the bracelet, even he might have been fooled.

Why has she returned after five years? Is she jealous? Regretful? Seeking reconciliation? A myriad of thoughts raced through Isabella's mind, each more tantalizing than the last. 

Little one, I'm not forgiving you so easily! But I'll give you a chance to make amends—by keeping me company, warming my bed, and more!

With a haughty posture, Isabella fixed his gaze on Olivia's flushed lips, waiting.

Olivia, backing away until her spine met the wall, thought, My god, this guy is like six feet tall! I'm gonna get a crick in my neck!

Feigning nonchalance, she said, "Uh, handsome guy, could you... let me pass?"

"I only loan kisses, not passage!"

"…"

"And borrowed kisses must be returned!"

"…"

With her face practically glowing red, Olivia muttered under her breath, "Didn't you already take it back with interest?"

"Just now? Ha!" Isabella grinned wickedly, his eyes gleaming with a predatory glint. "That was merely a loan you gave me!"

Shameless! Absolutely shameless!

Olivia cursed him silently, knowing full well she had no chance against him. He had the upper hand in both height and strength, and if he decided to press his advantage...

Her fingers twisted nervously, eyes darting around as if searching for help.

Isabella’s eyes darkened with anger. With a flick of his finger, he cupped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze.

"Who are you waiting for?"

She froze, shocked that he could read her thoughts so easily. Her expression gave her away completely, further provoking Isabella's ire.

His grip tightened, and he bellowed, "How dare you think of another man in my presence? Olivia Stewart!"

Startled, Olivia shook her head, "Isabella Peterson, you've got the wrong person! I'm not Olivia Stewart, and until today, I didn't even know you."

"Keep acting! You vanished for five years and now appear out of nowhere, disrupting my engagement, yet you claim not to know me? Olivia Stewart, I allowed you into my life, and I allow you to leave it, but I will not have you running in and out as you please!"

"I..."

Confronted by this other side of Isabella, Olivia felt utterly speechless. She shrank back, licking her dry lips, struggling to explain, "Isabella Peterson, you've really got it wrong. My name is Olivia Stewart, and I don't have any friends like that."

Isabella's eyes narrowed. "Edible? I certainly want a taste!"

Olivia slapped her forehead, wishing she could dig a hole and hide in it. "Uh, I meant..."

Before she could finish, the world spun, and she found herself hoisted over Isabella’s shoulder, dangling upside down.

"Ah! Let me down! Put me down!"

Ignoring her cries, Isabella strode forward, carrying her effortlessly. 

This guy used to be such a germaphobe! Once, when I nudged him, he made his guards clean his suit with a white cloth. And now, he's doing this?

Olivia bit her lip, clawing at his back in frustration, wrinkling his shirt like a wild beast. Yet he didn't falter, not even shifting his grip as he continued walking.

A line of guards approached, and Olivia cried out for help. But upon recognizing their boss, they quickly averted their eyes and scurried away like mice.

Hanging over Isabella’s back, Olivia felt both uncomfortable and embarrassed, with no escape in sight. She resorted to cursing under her breath, "Isabella Peterson, you big jerk!"

"Smack!"

A sharp slap landed on Olivia's backside, both painful and humiliating.

Isabella Peterson, I curse you to—

"Smack!"

Another slap, louder and more painful. Olivia fell silent, but as Isabella walked, she leaned down and bit him viciously.

"Mm."

Isabella grunted, halting with tension as hard as stone.

Ha! Gotcha!

Olivia flashed a triumphant grin, releasing her bite and feeling quite pleased with herself.

Isabella’s dark eyes glinted with an intense, predatory light, like a wolf spotting its prey. This girl had learned a few things in five years!

Scowling, he carried Olivia through the hotel, into the elevator, and with a swift kick, opened a room door, tossing her onto a massive, luxurious bed.
