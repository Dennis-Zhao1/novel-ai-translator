In the cozy art studio, Olivia Stewart and Isabella Peterson found themselves engaged in a friendly yet competitive clay modeling session. Olivia, deciding to take a break, settled into a nearby chair with an exasperated sigh. "Fine, do whatever you want!"

Isabella, however, was absorbed in crafting her clay sculpture. After getting the hang of it with her first attempt, her hands moved more deftly, producing a figure much more pleasing to the eye. Yet, when it came to sculpting the facial features, she found herself struggling. Following Olivia's earlier instructions, she carefully shaped the eyebrows, eyes, and nose, refining them with a small carving tool.

Despite her lack of experience, Isabella had a knack for carving. She managed to etch Olivia's features with remarkable precision. However, capturing the liveliness and spirit in Olivia’s eyes proved elusive. Frustrated, Isabella kept adjusting, never quite satisfied with the result.

Observing from the sidelines, Olivia couldn't help but chuckle. Capturing such subtle expressions was a challenge even for her, let alone for Isabella, a novice in this craft. She approached Isabella with an encouraging smile, "It's great as it is, you’ve done a fantastic job!"

"Not enough!" Isabella replied, her focus unwavering as she continued to refine her creation.

Olivia remembered joking earlier that if Isabella made an ugly clay model, she wouldn't be allowed in her room. Was Isabella taking this challenge to heart?

Trying a different tactic, Olivia teased, "Alright, Isabella, it's pretty enough! But no matter how good it looks, you're not sleeping in my bed tonight!"

"Who said I wanted to sleep in your bed?" Isabella retorted, her eyes not leaving the clay, "I want to sleep with you!"

Olivia’s triumphant grin froze halfway, as she realized Isabella had outplayed her with words. A playful curse escaped her lips.

Unfazed, Isabella continued sculpting, finally nodding in satisfaction after a while. She placed her clay figure next to Olivia's. Olivia examined both sculptures closely; they weren't as perfect as she imagined, but they certainly weren't as bad as she feared.

"Let's have Lucas Wright prepare the paints tomorrow so we can add some color," Isabella suggested coolly, pulling Olivia to her feet. "Come on, let's get you cleaned up! You're covered in clay!"

Olivia was taken aback. Isabella had been so focused on the clay, and now she was suddenly concerned about cleanliness?

As they walked away, Isabella paused, glancing back at the clay figures, "Something feels missing."

"Color?" Olivia guessed, tilting her head. "Aren’t we painting them tomorrow?"

"Wait! Let's make another one!" Isabella exclaimed, dragging Olivia back to the marble workbench.

Olivia was puzzled. One for her, one for him; what else could they make? A child?

The thought struck Olivia like a bolt, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment. What was she thinking?

Isabella, oblivious to Olivia’s flustered state, handed her another lump of clay. "Here, you shape the head, I'll do the body. Let's create a little one!"

A wave of warmth flooded Olivia’s heart. What if she and Isabella really had a child together? If it were a girl, she hoped she'd be as pretty and clever as herself. If a boy, he’d surely be as handsome and cool as Isabella, with a touch of that aloof charm.

Lost in thought, Olivia accidentally dropped her clay. Isabella swiftly caught it before it hit the ground.

"What's up? You seem distracted," Isabella noted.

"Nothing, nothing!" Olivia stammered, her cheeks burning anew.

Isabella scrutinized Olivia's flushed face, "You're not imagining what our future child would look like, are you?"

Boom—Olivia’s face turned even redder, as if she were trying to blend into the clay.

Isabella smirked, "What's there to be embarrassed about? If you don't imagine it, how can we create it?"

"Right," Olivia mumbled, her voice barely a whisper.

Isabella kneaded the clay in his hands, merging it into a single piece before handing a portion back to Olivia. "Hold it steady. Make sure our kid doesn’t turn out ugly!"

Olivia took the clay, too shy to meet Isabella’s gaze, but a sweet warmth spread through her chest.

Isabella’s deep voice resonated near her ear, "You ever heard that poem?"

"Hmm?"

"Take a piece of clay, mold a you, sculpt a me, then break us, blend with water, mold a you again, sculpt a me. I in you, you in me..."

Isabella's voice was like a soothing cello, each word a gentle note that stirred Olivia's heart.

"Beautiful," Olivia sighed, her voice as soft as a feather.

Isabella turned to her, "Is it the poem that's beautiful, or my recitation?"

"Both!" Olivia replied, mentally noting how lucky she was that Isabella wasn’t a sweet-talker, or no woman could resist him.

Her mind drifted to a scene from a play where the male lead, Tianyi, had whispered sweet nothings to her. Would Isabella’s words rival those? Oh, she was daydreaming again!

Olivia shook her head, refocusing on her clay modeling. She was determined to create the cutest little figure, one that represented their possible future child.

Isabella, too, was engrossed in shaping the body, his brow furrowed in concentration. His intense focus made him look like a diligent student, and his chiseled features were captivating.

The studio fell silent, with both deeply absorbed in their tasks. The quiet wasn’t awkward, but rather, filled with a warm, milky sweetness.

Soon, they finished their respective parts. Isabella’s body was slightly flawed but charmingly clumsy. Olivia combined the head and body, and a cool, adorable little figure emerged.

Cradling the figure in her hands, Olivia couldn't help but admire it, "So cute!"

"Do you like it?" Isabella whispered near her ear.

"Yes." Olivia beamed, her affection for the little figure evident.

"Shall I help you make a real one?" Isabella teased.

"No, this is..." Olivia began to protest, but Isabella’s lips brushed her ear, sending a jolt down her spine.

Startled, Olivia placed the little clay figure far away, fearing that in Isabella’s eagerness, it might get squashed.

Isabella chuckled, pulling Olivia closer, wrapping his arms around her waist. They stood like conjoined twins, Olivia’s back pressed against Isabella’s warm chest.

Feeling the heat from Isabella’s body, Olivia stood rigid, hardly daring to move.

Isabella placed his hand over hers, guiding it to move the little figure next to their clay parents. "See, a perfect family of three," Olivia murmured, then blushed at her own words.

Isabella’s laughter rumbled above her, leaning down to brush his cheek against hers. "I think so too! But you know, the real one I make would be even better."

Olivia, cheeks burning, pretended not to catch the double meaning, nudging him away with a playful elbow. "We’re all dirty! Let’s go clean up."

Isabella raised an eyebrow mischievously, "In a hurry?"

Olivia’s step faltered, flustered, "Who, who’s in a hurry? I just..."

Her eyes fell on a lump of clay she’d squished earlier, and she quickly changed the subject, "Should we make another?"

Isabella’s grin widened, his tone indulgent, "We can make as many as you want! I won’t complain."
