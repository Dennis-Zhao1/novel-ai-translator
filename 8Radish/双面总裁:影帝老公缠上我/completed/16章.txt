Olivia Stewart dashed out of the restaurant, her heart racing as she sprinted through a sea of flowers, twisting and turning until she found herself utterly lost in the castle's labyrinthine gardens.

Breathless, she leaned against a swing set, gazing up at the pink-domed castle she was staying in. It looked like something out of a fairy tale, with glass houses dotted around, filled with exotic flowers and colorful fish that seemed to float in mid-air thanks to their transparent tanks. The sunlight scattered through the glass, casting rainbows all around, creating a scene almost too perfect to be real.

With a sigh, Olivia muttered to herself, "White Yike, you've got it made! Show yourself already, or I might just steal your guy!"

Of course, she was mostly joking. Deep down, Olivia wanted a guy who wasn't necessarily rich or perfect, but one who'd love her for who she was—quirks and all—not as a stand-in for someone else.

Once she'd caught her breath, Olivia resumed her exploration, wandering through the floral maze until she finally encountered a servant.

"Excuse me, how do I get out of this castle?" she asked.

The servant, after a quick glance, bowed respectfully. "Hello, Miss Miao. If you'd like to visit other castles, I can have the butler arrange a carriage for you. Walking won't get you far before nightfall."

Olivia slumped onto a nearby wicker chair, feeling slightly defeated. "Alright, why don't you keep me company for a bit?"

"Of course," the servant replied, standing by with a slightly nervous expression.

Curious, Olivia asked, "Have we met before? How do you know my name?"

"All the staff here know that Miss Miao is the lady of this castle. You're the first woman to set foot here in five years, so you must be her. When the young master brought you back last night, everyone knew. The butler instructed us to treat Miss Miao with the same respect as we do the young master."

Olivia rubbed her temples, realizing bribing a servant to escape was out of the question. The castle was much larger than she imagined, and walking out on her own was a fantasy.

Looking out at the various styles of castles dotting the horizon, surrounded by lush greenery and shimmering lakes, she marveled at the extravagance. "So, there's a lake outside the castle?"

"Yes, the entire estate is on an island in the middle of a lake, with over a hundred castles representing styles from all over the world."

How did I not know places like this existed back in the city?

In a place where every square foot was worth a fortune, owning a private island castle kingdom was the ultimate display of wealth.

With a heavy heart, Olivia admitted to herself that escaping was hopeless. Her only option was to convince Isabella Peterson to let her go, which seemed unlikely at the moment.

"Thank you. Could you take me back?"

The servant bowed again. "Miss Miao, you're too kind. This way, please."

Back at the castle, Olivia spotted Lucas Wright and rushed over. "Lucas, where's Isabella Peterson?"

Lucas squinted at her. "The young master's busy in the study. I was just about to bring him some coffee. Why not take it to him, Miss Miao?"

Thinking it wise not to anger Isabella if she wanted to leave, Olivia nodded. "Alright."

Carrying the coffee, she followed Lucas to Isabella's study. Peeking inside, she was taken aback by the sheer size. Walls lined with bookshelves intermingled with state-of-the-art digital workstations, where screens flickered with endless streams of data.

Isabella sat at a desk, fingers flying over three keyboards, eyes darting between screens with a focus that was captivating to watch.

Olivia took a deep breath and quietly entered the room.

"You're back?" Isabella greeted without looking up, his voice calm and familiar, as if they were an old married couple exchanging greetings after a day apart.

Olivia blushed slightly, placing the coffee carefully on the desk. "Yeah," she replied softly.

Isabella continued working without further acknowledgment, occasionally sipping his coffee as Olivia stood awkwardly by.

Glancing outside, Olivia's eyes widened at the sight of a girl in a pink dress running through the flower fields, her hair and dress billowing in the breeze like a living painting. 

Wait a minute...

She covered her mouth in shock. It was her, running in the garden, captured on camera. And Isabella knew she had tried to run!

"Impressed by your own beauty?" Isabella teased, pausing his work to look at her with a smug grin. "Don't get too full of yourself. It's the flowers that make you look good!"

Olivia rolled her eyes. "Which eye of yours saw me being full of myself, Mr. Peterson?"

At her words, Isabella's hand froze, a hint of displeasure crossing his face.

The title "Mr. Peterson" seemed to rub him the wrong way, even though he'd been called that for years. Coming from Olivia, it felt oddly unsettling.

He placed the coffee cup down. "Keep being so formal, and I'll double your punishment!"

Olivia instinctively stepped back, covering her mouth.

Isabella gave her a sidelong glance. "I do have an older brother, but he's my uncle's illegitimate son, brought home five years ago."

Was this his way of explaining?

Seeing Isabella's reluctance to discuss family matters, Olivia decided not to press further. No one liked airing their dirty laundry, and it wasn't her business anyway.

Fidgeting with her dress hem, Olivia carefully chose her words. "Sorry, Isabella. If you can't let me go home right away, could you at least return my phone?"

So that's why she brought him coffee!

A flicker of disappointment crossed Isabella's eyes. He pondered her request for a moment, then retrieved her phone from a drawer, casually tossing it in his hand. "Want it?"

Olivia nodded eagerly.

"How are you going to thank me?"
