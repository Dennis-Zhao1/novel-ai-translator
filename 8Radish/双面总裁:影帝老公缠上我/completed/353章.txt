Olivia Stewart raised her voice in concern, "What exactly happened to Chloe Wright?"

Jenson White hesitated, knowing he couldn't hide it any longer, and blurted out, "Chloe, she—she slipped today!"

Olivia's heart skipped a beat, and she widened her eyes at Jenson. "Stop beating around the bush and just tell me everything!"

Jenson was terrified of upsetting Olivia and seeing her stern gaze made his knees weak. He quickly spilled the details:

"This morning, when Chloe was bringing you soup, the rain was so heavy that the roads flooded. She didn't see clearly and stepped into a storm drain, spraining her ankle and breaking the thermos. She went back and made more soup, which took five or six hours, so I'm delivering it to you now."

Olivia suddenly found the thermos in her hand unbearably heavy. If it took that long to make soup every day, Chloe must have been waking up at three or four in the morning to prepare it.

And slipping into a storm drain in that kind of weather was more than just a sprain.

But since they were trying to keep it from her, she decided to play along.

Olivia took a deep breath, composed herself, and offered Jenson a warm smile. "I'll have someone drive you back. And tell her to get well soon. There's only two weeks until my wedding!"

Wedding...?

Jenson was thunderstruck. Was Olivia inviting him to her wedding?

Isabella Peterson, Olivia's fiancé, couldn't help but chuckle at Jenson's dumbfounded expression. He signaled a bodyguard to escort Jenson home. They'd been talking at the gate for too long, and he didn't want Olivia to get too tired. Besides, it seemed Olivia had softened and forgiven Jenson and his wife. If Jenson caught a cold standing here, Olivia would feel guilty.

Once Jenson was in the car, Isabella gently guided Olivia inside. "Come on, sweetheart, let's go enjoy some soup."

The next day, just around noon, Jenson showed up again with another thermos, carefully wrapped in towels.

Having learned from the previous day, he didn't leave the thermos at the gate but instead approached the guard booth. Polite as ever, he asked the guard, "Could you please give this to Olivia Stewart?"

A familiar voice chimed in behind the guard, "Why are you here again?"

Jenson looked up, surprised to see Olivia standing there, visibly annoyed. He instinctively shrank back, stammering, "Olivia, I..."

"Don't call me Olivia Stewart!" she snapped, cutting him off with a frown.

What should he call her?

Remembering her upcoming marriage to Isabella, Jenson quickly corrected himself, "Mrs. Peterson!"

This old fool!

Olivia huffed, a bit exasperated. "Just call me Olivia."

Jenson finally caught on, and his wrinkled face broke into a wide grin. He nervously handed the thermos to her. "Here, Chloe made this soup for you. Drink it while it's hot, Olivia."

He said her name so quietly, sneaking a glance at her with a mix of hope and fear.

Olivia was touched by his cautious demeanor. She didn't take the thermos right away but instead questioned him sternly, "Didn't I tell you not to bring any more soup? Shouldn't you be at home taking care of her?"

"Olivia, are you worried about Chloe? She'd be thrilled to know that!" Jenson's eyes shone with joyful tears as he pushed the thermos forward. "Please, Olivia, drink it. You don't know how happy she was when she found out you drank her soup yesterday. She was up all night making more for you!"

"Don't worry! I'll head back to take care of her right after this. She wants to make sure she's well enough to attend your wedding!"

Olivia watched Jenson's eager expression, feeling a mix of frustration and warmth. She sighed and took the soup, "Alright, you should get going."

"Yes! And make sure you drink it while it's hot! Chloe said it's great for you, and it won't affect the baby! If you keep drinking it, you'll soon give us another grandbaby!"

Jenson's excitement got the better of him, and he only realized his slip after it was too late. He watched Olivia nervously, sweat forming on his brow.

Olivia had never acknowledged him and Grace Martin as her parents. Now, having finally accepted their kindness, he worried if he'd accidentally reignited old wounds.

Surrounded by young bodyguards, Olivia blushed at Jenson's comment, glaring at him with a mix of embarrassment and annoyance. "Two or three already, what more are you talking about?"

Seeing she didn't refute the idea of more grandchildren, Jenson secretly rejoiced, quickly tapping his cheek in self-reproach. "Yes, yes, my old age is showing. You young folks should decide for yourselves!"

He chuckled, catching a glimpse of Olivia's still-blushing face. "The wind's picking up. You should head back inside. I'm off!"

After taking a few steps, he turned back, "I'll bring more tomorrow. Have your staff pick it up next time. You've got plenty on your plate with the wedding preparations!"

Seeing Olivia stay silent, Jenson hesitated, "If you... if you need any help, just let me know. I can—"

He couldn't finish, waiting hopefully for her response.

His earnestness was hard to refuse.

Olivia sighed inwardly, her gaze softening as she looked at him. "Isabella's got most of it planned. Everything's nearly ready."

Jenson's face fell slightly, thinking how wonderful it would have been to prepare his daughter's wedding gifts. But at least she was letting them be part of the ceremony.

He consoled himself, smiling with satisfaction. "Olivia, we're so happy you're marrying someone who loves and cherishes you."

Olivia noticed the hidden sadness in his smile, offering a gentle smile of her own. "Really, you don't need to do much. Just take care of yourselves and bless us as family when the time comes."

"Yes, yes!"

Jenson nodded eagerly, tears of joy brimming in his eyes.

He didn't dare hope to walk Olivia down the aisle as her father, but her acknowledgment of them as family was enough.

Watching Jenson's tearful, joyful expression, Olivia felt a pang of emotion. This man, once calculative, now seemed like a loving father. It was as if the past manipulations were just illusions.

If it weren't for their past actions, Olivia might have seemed ungrateful or heartless. But over the past three years, Jenson and Grace Martin truly changed.

Without any gain to be had, their consistent kindness could only stem from genuine love.

Even if it started as an act, three years had turned it into their nature.

Olivia, who'd never experienced much familial love, was moved by their sincerity.

Watching Jenson's gray hair, she sighed almost inaudibly.

Having chosen forgiveness and given a chance to reclaim family bonds, why dwell in past grievances?

With this realization, her inner conflict began to dissolve.

Olivia smiled, feeling a newfound peace, and offered, "Let me have someone drive you home."

Jenson didn't refuse, nodding with gratitude. "Yes, yes!"

Receiving his daughter's care would surely make Chloe ecstatic.

A bodyguard pulled up, ready to take Jenson back home.

As soon as he got in, Jenson discreetly activated his phone, whispering, "Did you hear all that? Happy now?"

On the other end, Grace's voice was full of laughter. "I heard it all! I told you, our daughter is the kindest girl in the world. She was bound to forgive us! We must cherish her kindness and never upset her again."

Jenson reflected, "Yes, I've finally learned that no amount of money or status is worth more than a loved one's concern. Chloe, get well soon—our daughter's getting married!"

The elderly couple laughed heartily over the phone.

In the front seat, the driver, one of Isabella's trusted guards, glanced at Jenson's tear-streaked face in the rear-view mirror, a rare smile crossing his own normally stoic features.

Having witnessed Olivia's journey since her arrival, he was glad to see her parents finally realizing what truly mattered, sincerely wishing happiness for both Olivia and Isabella.
