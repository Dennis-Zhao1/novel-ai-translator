好像是个……死人

Deep in a hidden cave, somewhere in the secluded part of a sprawling cavern system, there were paths leading everywhere, even one that went to an underground river. It was here that Alexander Peterson found his sanctuary, a fascination that began when he visited the area as a child. After years of exploration, he had mapped out the entire labyrinth and claimed this spot as his own.

The cave entrance dripped with moisture, and the ground inside was littered with a few stale breadcrumbs. Alexander bent down to enter, his chilly gaze sweeping the shadowy corners, searching for the little figure he expected to find. But the kid wasn’t there.

Not there?

He scanned the interior again, frustration boiling over. That little brat had escaped! He hadn’t even learned how to drive a wedge between Olivia Stewart and Isabella Peterson or how to discreetly deal with those twins. And yet, the kid dared to run away!

Alexander furiously drew a small golden knife, scraping it across the damp cave wall, sending a shower of sparks in all directions. With a grunt, he put the knife away and sat down, gnawing on some bread. The kid was timid; there were snakes outside the cave. Surely, he wouldn’t dare go far. Once hunger and fear set in, he’d come crawling back.

But this time, Alexander got it wrong.

After enduring relentless torment, the kid, Tommy, was nearly at his breaking point. Alexander Peterson was a thousand times more terrifying than any snake could ever be. So, given a chance to escape, Tommy would never look back, no matter what dangers lay outside.

The important thing was, Tommy got lost after running for a while. The cave system was a maze of paths and openings, and he stumbled around like a headless chicken, taking any path that appeared until he collapsed from exhaustion.

…

“Whoa!”

The guide, who was leading the way, suddenly yelped in surprise.

“Why are you shouting?” David Wright hissed, annoyed. They’d turned off their flashlights to avoid alerting anyone and were moving forward carefully in the dim light. The guide’s outburst was the last thing they needed.

“I-I think I stepped on something!” the guide stammered, his voice shaking. He was just a local farmer, not trained to stay calm under pressure like the bodyguards.

David quickly shone his special small flashlight on the ground, revealing a crumpled figure.

“It looks like a…dead person!”

The guide’s legs trembled uncontrollably, and he struggled to move his foot away.

David brought the light closer, revealing a thin child lying face down on the ground. “Tommy?”

He quickly turned the child over, revealing the pale, lifeless face of Tommy. It was him!

David scooped up the boy immediately as the guide stumbled backward, terrified. “Is he…is he dead?”

“Shut up! Turn on the big lights now!” David barked, dashing out with Tommy in his arms. Even if the sudden flood of light might alert Alexander Peterson, Tommy’s life was at risk. They couldn’t afford to waste time feeling their way through the dark.

As he ran, David barked orders into his headset, “All teams, listen up! We’ve found Tommy. Move to my last location and start a full search for Alexander Peterson!”

Soon, Tommy was rushed out of the cave and taken to the hospital for emergency care.

Olivia Stewart heard the news and was at the hospital in no time.

“Tommy! Tommy!”

She rushed toward the ward, but Isabella Peterson caught her arm, pulling her back. “Olivia, calm down. Tommy’s okay. He’s sleeping now. Let him rest, and we’ll see him when he wakes up, okay?”

“You’re not lying to me, Isabella? Tell me you’re not lying!” Olivia’s anxious eyes searched Isabella’s face for any sign of deceit.

Isabella sighed and raised two fingers, “I swear, okay?”

Finally, Olivia calmed down, nestling into Isabella’s comforting embrace, still trembling slightly. Isabella gently patted her back, realizing he now had to treat her with the care one would give a fragile child.

The woman he once knew was becoming more fragile by the day. Life had thrown so much at her lately. If not for him, she might still be that carefree, joyful girl. Would her life have been different?

Isabella felt a pang of guilt but remained resolute. Now that he had her in his life, he wouldn’t let go. His mission was to make her life better, no matter what.

After soothing Olivia, Isabella brushed aside a stray lock of her hair, his fingers warm against her weary face. “Olivia, I’m sorry. I should have taken better care of you.”

Her body trembled slightly, and she slowly wrapped her arms around his waist.

After a moment of shared silence, Olivia looked up, “Let me see Tommy. I promise I won’t wake him.”

“You’re impossible,” Isabella said fondly, tapping her nose. He gently opened the ward door for her.

Olivia tiptoed in, relief washing over her as she saw the small, tousled head on the pillow. Her heart, which had been lodged in her throat, finally settled down. She sat on the edge of the bed, reaching out to stroke Tommy’s much thinner face, but withdrew her hand, afraid to disturb him.

She noticed his hand sticking out from under the blanket, carefully tucking it back in. “Is he really okay?” she whispered to Isabella.

In a hushed voice, Isabella replied, “Just some scrapes and exhaustion. He’s weak, but the doctors are giving him nutrients. Once he’s rested and recovered, he’ll be fine.”

“Thank you, Isabella,” Olivia murmured, leaning into his embrace, her eyes misty.

He gently patted her back, “No need for thanks between us. But if you really want to show your gratitude, maybe you could improve my benefits.”

“Jerk!” Olivia playfully punched him, laughing through her tears. He always had a way of lightening the mood.

But their playful banter was cut short when the little figure on the bed stirred. Olivia immediately fell silent, pressing a finger to Isabella’s lips, holding her breath.

Fortunately, Tommy only turned over in his sleep, still deeply asleep. The poor kid had been through hell in Alexander Peterson’s hands, scared, cold, and hungry for days. He desperately needed this rest.

Olivia tucked the blanket around Tommy again, then hesitated, lifting his sleeve to reveal a vicious scabbed wound.

This was just a scrape?

She gritted her teeth, rolling the sleeve further up to uncover more marks. A third, a fourth…

Overwhelmed, Olivia shut her eyes, tears streaming down her face. She clenched her fists, pressing them to her mouth to stifle her cries.

Isabella pulled her into a tight embrace. In that moment, words were unnecessary. Nothing could ease Olivia’s pain but quiet support and a shoulder to lean on.

After a long silence, Olivia finally spoke through her tears, “How could Alexander do this? Even a tiger wouldn’t harm its cub. Tommy is his child!”

“Isabella, am I really that useless? I couldn’t even protect my own child! I let Tommy suffer so much!”

“It’s not your fault, Olivia. Don’t blame yourself for this. I’ve got people searching for Alexander now. Don’t dwell on it. Let’s not disturb Tommy anymore. You need to rest too.”

Gently, Isabella coaxed her out of the room.

Neither of them noticed that when Olivia had sobbed earlier, Tommy’s eyelashes had fluttered slightly. Once the door closed, Tommy opened his eyes.

In their depths, which should have been bright and innocent, was a cold indifference and calmness beyond his years, a shadow of life that seemed eerily reminiscent of Alexander Peterson’s demeanor.

Tommy had heard everything.

Alexander Peterson was his father?

The man who tormented him daily was his father!

And the kind Aunt Olivia, calling her child—did she mean him? Was she his mother? Then why had she always insisted he call her aunt?

Was it because he was a child from another man, and she didn’t want to claim him?

Tommy stared at the ceiling, his youthful face already showing a hint of the same cruel indifference as Alexander Peterson’s.

In the hospital, Tommy received the best care and attention. Olivia was by his side almost constantly, tending to him with tender care and trying to erase the trauma he’d endured. She cooked nourishing meals, brought him treats and toys, and told him stories.

She poured all her energy into caring for him, desperate to heal the wounds in his heart.

This time, Isabella showed no jealousy. He made sure the twins were well taken care of, easing Olivia’s worries, and was there to comfort and support her daily. He gave her massages, soothed her nerves, and provided the love and understanding only a devoted partner could offer.

Olivia saw no reluctance in Isabella’s eyes, and it eased the heavy burden on her heart. She still secretly took medication, planning to consult a doctor once Tommy was discharged.

The adults tried their best, but Tommy, who now knew the truth, saw their efforts as hollow theater. His heart seethed with resentment toward Olivia and an intense jealousy of the twins.
