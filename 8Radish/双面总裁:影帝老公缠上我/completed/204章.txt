The night was tense, and in the dimly lit living room, Ethan King was trying to keep Olivia Stewart from completely unraveling. Isabella Peterson had stormed out after a heated exchange, and as her silhouette disappeared into the night, Olivia finally let herself collapse, all the strength drained from her body.

"Olivia!" Ethan called out, catching her just in time. He held her close, trying to offer some comfort. Olivia, tears streaming down her face, managed a bitter smile. "It's over," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.

She couldn't understand how things had gone so wrong so quickly. She hadn't wanted Ethan to kiss her; she hadn't even seen it coming. But Isabella hadnâ€™t given her a chance to explain.

With a heavy heart, Olivia pushed Ethan away, leaning back into the chair. "Are you satisfied now?" she asked, her voice tinged with sarcasm.

Ethan's face fell, guilt washing over him. "You knew? Olivia, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for it to go this far. I was injured, yes, but not as badly as it looked. Seeing you worry about me... it felt good. I'm sorry."

Olivia's eyes were filled with tears again. "When Isabella lashed out, you just lay there. I thought you were going to die, Ethan."

She had rushed to him in that moment, even knowing the consequences with Isabella. But realizing now that Ethan had deceived her, she felt betrayed.

"I'm sorry," Ethan said again, his voice small and contrite. "I just wanted to see if you would choose me."

Olivia shook her head, her voice hoarse. "It's too late for that now."

Ethan tried to reach for her hand, desperation in his eyes. "Please, Olivia. Let's go back to how things were. We can be happy again."

But Olivia gently pulled her hand away. "Do you really think we can go back to being happy after all this? We can't, Ethan. It's over."

Ethan was frantic. "I'll explain everything to Isabella. I'll step back, be just a friend. If I'd known this would happen, I would have kept my feelings to myself forever."

"But you did say it," Olivia replied, looking into his eyes. "And now that I know how you feel, I can't just ignore it."

With a sad smile, Olivia stood up. "I'm sorry, Ethan. I can't return your feelings. We need to keep our distance."

With that, she walked out, leaving Ethan standing there, his heart aching.

As Olivia checked into a nondescript hotel using her last few dollars, Isabella Peterson was back at the estate, drinking his frustrations away. His loyal attendant, Lucas Wright, watched with concern.

"Sir, please be careful," Lucas urged, worried about Isabella's state.

"Get out!" Isabella snapped, though Lucas knew it was the alcohol talking more than anything.

The night wore on with Isabella drowning his sorrows, while Lucas stayed nearby, ready to assist if needed. Eventually, Isabella demanded that Olivia be sent to the guest room, only to be reminded by Lucas that she hadn't returned.

"That woman," Isabella grumbled, clutching a bottle of wine. "If she comes back, I'll..."

But Lucas knew better. Isabella's anger was just a mask for his hurt. And when Isabella instructed Lucas to return a precious gift to Olivia, Lucas understood the depth of his employer's turmoil.

Lucas made the trek to Olivia's old apartment, hoping to find her there. When the door opened, it was Emma Thomas, a sleepy roommate, who greeted him with surprise.

"I'm here to see Olivia," Lucas said politely, feeling the weight of the night on his shoulders. "I have something important to deliver from my employer."

And so the night continued, with misunderstandings and untold feelings hanging in the air, waiting for the light of a new day to bring clarity.
