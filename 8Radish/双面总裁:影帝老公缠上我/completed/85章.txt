Sophie Cook Catches Attention

Sophie Cook had just dropped a bombshell in the dorm room, and everyone was stunned into silence. But Amy, sitting off to the side, let out a sarcastic laugh, "If my sister were playing the lead, there's no way I'd be stuck as a tea-serving maid. I might not get the second lead, but I'd at least get a third lead role, not some forgettable extra!"

Sophie Cook's face turned beet red with embarrassment.

The others exchanged looks, smirking at her discomfort. Sophie, clutching her casting notice tightly, felt her nails dig into her palm. "So what if it's a small role?" she thought. "You idiots! That maid role is close to the male lead. Once I cozy up to superstar Ty Yi, I'll have my pick of roles, maybe even lead roles!"

Imagining her future success, Sophie Cook felt a smug smile creeping onto her face. She scanned her roommates with an air of superiority, finally settling her gaze on Amy. "Honestly, I'm not even bothered about this small role. Like you said, with Olivia Stewart as the lead, I could easily ask her to switch my role. I was thinking of giving it to you, but if you don't want it..."

Amy's face fell, and she stammered, "I-I..."

The rest of the group quickly changed their tune, rushing to win favor with Sophie. "Sophie, if you really don't want the role, I'll take it!" one said eagerly. "Me too!" another chimed in.

Their fawning demeanor was both nauseating and gratifying to Sophie. She crossed her arms, watching their performance with cool detachment.

"Sophie, I apologize for what I said earlier. Please don't take it to heart!" one pleaded.

"Yeah, it was all Amy's doing. I've always admired you!" another added.

Sophie chuckled inwardly at their two-faced antics. Just moments ago, they'd sneered at the small role, and now they were groveling for it. "What would they do if I became a big star?" she mused.

Her lips curled into a satisfied smirk as she directed a haughty look at Amy. Amy's face was a mix of frustration and disbelief, pointing at her so-called friends who had betrayed her. "You hypocrites!" she yelled. "Didn't you just badmouth Sophie?"

"I was talking about you!" one retorted.

"I'll shut that big mouth of yours!" Amy shouted and lunged at the girl, starting a scuffle. The others quickly intervened.

Sophie watched the chaos with amusement. She tossed her hair back, picked up her purse, and with a condescending smile said, "You guys have fun. I'm out!" and strutted out, leaving everyone dumbfounded.

It took them a moment to realize they'd been played. There was no role to give away. Amy, hands on her hips, scolded them, "You idiots! Did you really think she'd give up a role she worked hard to get?"

Sophie Cook's news of landing a role as a maid in the upcoming series "Send an Angel to Love You" spread like wildfire through the Gold City Film Academy. Despite being a minor role, it was significant because the show was produced by the prestigious Billion Films, with Ty Yi as the male lead. Even a small part in such a project could be a stepping stone to fame.

Rumors swirled even more when it was revealed that Sophie Cook was the younger sister of the lead actress, Olivia Stewart—something of an open secret at the academy. Suddenly, Sophie was the center of attention, basking in the envious stares wherever she went.

Sophie, known for her high standards, loathed relying on her sister's fame for recognition. Her heart was full of resentment towards Olivia Stewart, yet she couldn't deny the thrill of being a sought-after figure.

Then, an explosive piece of news hit the academy: Olivia Stewart, the novice lead actress, was set to join the academy for a crash course in acting. Sophie snapped her selfie stick in frustration upon hearing the news, but quickly composed herself, plotting her next move.

Meanwhile, in a pink princess-like castle, Olivia Stewart sat by the window, staring blankly at the picturesque view outside. The script for "Send an Angel to Love You" lay before her. Ever since the casting call, Olivia felt like she was dreaming. She couldn't fathom why she was chosen as the lead, especially opposite a star like Ty Yi.

After much contemplation, Olivia decided to give the opportunity to Sophie Cook. Despite Sophie's disappointing behavior, Olivia understood her sister's passion for acting and wanted to support her. It had always been Olivia's habit to let Sophie have her way.

When Olivia approached Isabella Peterson for help in transferring the role to Sophie, she was shocked when the usually jealous and possessive Isabella refused.

Confused, Olivia pondered the situation until, two days later, the script arrived. It was only then she had an inkling of what was happening.

"Send an Angel to Love You" was a classic tale of a humble girl hired to care for a wealthy young man with a heart condition. As they navigated their feelings, societal differences, and familial objections, love ultimately prevailed—a typical Cinderella story.

But what caught Olivia's attention was the character's name: Bai Yike.

Why would Billion Films invest so heavily in such a cliché story? And why was she, an unknown, selected as the lead?

The name Bai Yike sent a chill down her spine, a bad omen. Could there be so many coincidences?

Upon finishing the script and recalling Isabella's behavior, Olivia pieced together the truth. Isabella must have secretly funded the project, wanting her to relive their romance through the character Bai Yike, to rekindle their shared memories.

Realizing this left Olivia feeling anything but joyful. Her heart felt heavy, like it was stuffed with cotton and needles, stifling and occasionally painful.

Isabella had gone on a business trip, supposedly overseeing a major project—a rarity for someone usually detached from such matters. Olivia couldn't be bothered to question his whereabouts. After receiving the notice for intensive training at Gold City Film Academy, she packed her bags and left.

Playing Bai Yike was now inevitable. The training was a good excuse to distance herself from Isabella and sort through her thoughts.

Olivia arrived at the academy in a discreet black car, hoping to slip in unnoticed. But the entrance was packed with people. The board of directors, the dean, everyone was there to greet her, calling her a rising star. The attention was overwhelming.

After some pleasantries, Olivia was about to head inside when someone from the crowd suddenly knelt before her with a loud thud...
