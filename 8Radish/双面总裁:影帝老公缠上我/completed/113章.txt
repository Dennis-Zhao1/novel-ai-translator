被男神牵手

The outside noise was getting louder as Olivia Stewart glanced up, realizing they had reached the grand entrance of the Golden City Theater. The gilded posters waved in the breeze, while giant electronic screens flashed images of the new play's main characters.

"Look, the leading lady is here!"

Someone shouted upon spotting Olivia Stewart's car, and suddenly, a swarm of reporters, armed with cameras and microphones, rushed forward like a tidal wave. They nearly knocked over the security guards trying to maintain order. The reporters strained against the human barricade, snapping photos incessantly while shouting various questions: "Olivia Stewart! Is it true you were injured recently?"

"Olivia Stewart, do you know the famous actor, Daniel Harper, from before?"

Seeing the chaotic scene, Olivia Stewart instantly felt a wave of nervousness.

Michael Wright, watching from the rearview mirror, skillfully maneuvered the steering wheel while reassuring her, "Don't worry, Olivia. Our team is around; they won't let anything happen to you. Once inside, just take the private entrance."

As if on cue, a group of bodyguards emerged around the car, forming a tall, solid wall to keep the crowd at bay. Michael Wright quickly drove through the theater gates, leaving the noisy reporters behind.

Olivia Stewart finally exhaled, patting her chest. "Wow, it's like they're trying to kidnap me!"

Michael chuckled, "Being famous has its downsides."

"I don't want to live like this forever; it's too exhausting!"

But being with the young master meant her life would never be ordinary.

Michael just smiled, keeping his thoughts to himself, and stepped out to open the car door for Olivia, bowing slightly, "Olivia, after you!"

As Olivia stepped out, her entourage—assistants, stylists, makeup artists, and bodyguards—instantly surrounded her, making her feel like a true star.

Olivia smirked at the thought until she saw someone approaching from the other side, making her stop in her tracks.

Sophie Cook!

How long had it been since she'd seen her sister? Ten days? Two weeks? Maybe longer?

Sophie stopped as well, her face a mask of cold arrogance.

Olivia hesitated, then softly asked, "Sophie, are you doing okay?"

Sophie lifted her chin defiantly, looking at Olivia with disdain. "Do I look like I'm not okay?"

Olivia took a closer look at Sophie and was immediately taken aback. "Where did you get the money for such extravagant things?"

Sophie sneered, "You think you're the only one who can find a sponsor?"

Olivia's face went pale.

Sophie strutted away triumphantly, her head held high, leaving Olivia biting her lip in frustration.

She'd kicked Sophie out in hopes of making her realize her mistakes and become independent. But now, it seemed Sophie only hated her more, with no signs of remorse.

I just hope she doesn't take the wrong path, Olivia prayed silently. Despite everything, she didn't want her sister hurt.

"Olivia, we should head inside. If the reporters catch a whiff of anything, it won't be good," her assistant reminded.

Snapping out of her thoughts, Olivia plastered on a smile and hurried inside.

The Golden City Theater was massive, its grand hall lavishly decorated for the new play's launch event. Upstairs, countless rooms served as dressing rooms, makeup stations, and prop rooms.

As the leading lady, Olivia had a suite reserved for her. The stylist kept her look simple for the event, letting her long, dark hair flow freely, with just a few curls framing her face and a sparkling pink diamond clip on the side. The accessories were simple but luxurious.

"Time to change into your gown, Olivia!"

Her assistant unfolded a silver, off-shoulder gown. Olivia slipped into it, the dress hugging her figure perfectly, with sparkling gems accentuating her waist.

"Wow, Olivia, you look stunning!"

Her assistant's eyes practically twinkled with admiration.

Once she put on the matching crystal necklace, Olivia looked even more radiant. Her already fair skin seemed to glow against the soft silver gown, the pink diamond in her hair complementing the sparkling gems at her waist—it was a look fit for a moonlit goddess.

Everyone buzzed around Olivia, even the stylist couldn't help but praise, "Olivia, you look ethereal. It's rare to pull off a dress like this with such natural beauty!"

"Keep the compliments coming, and I might just get a big head!"

Olivia blushed, secretly wondering how Isabella Peterson would react if she saw her now.

The makeup artist urged her, "Olivia, sit down. I can't wait to see the final look!"

With a smile, Olivia settled in, "Thank you for your hard work!"

Soon, the makeup artist finished a delicate, natural look. Olivia's complexion was already flawless, and her features, now enhanced, seemed more defined—her eyes larger and more radiant, her lips full and glossy.

"My little fairy!"

Her assistant was awestruck, circling Olivia with admiration.

A knock on the door interrupted them. "Olivia, ready? The launch starts in ten minutes," Michael Wright called from outside.

"Almost done!"

After a final touch-up, the stylist inspected every detail, nodding in satisfaction.

Olivia, with her assistant in tow, stepped out, feeling a mix of excitement and nerves. What if she forgot her lines on stage? What if a reporter tried to trip her up?

Oh, Isabella Peterson, why aren't you here with me?

As she rounded a corner, Olivia noticed a young man in a floral shirt standing by the door. He seemed familiar, but didn't acknowledge her, just stared intently.

Olivia frowned.

This guy looks sketchy!

As she got closer, Olivia's memory clicked, and she stopped, pointing at him. "Flower Shirt Guy!"

The guy snapped out of his daze, chuckling awkwardly, "Hey, Olivia! Nice to meet you. I'm Amy Green!"

"Amy Green? You're Isabella Peterson's assistant, right? What are you doing here? Where's Isabella?"

Olivia scanned the area, hoping to spot Isabella.

Isabella better not be planning a surprise!

Seeing Olivia's puzzled look, Amy Green scratched his head, worried. If this act fell apart, his boss might have his head!

Adjusting his gold-rimmed glasses, Amy quickly changed the subject, "Olivia, you look amazing today! Like, like... oh, right!" He snapped his fingers, eyes gleaming. "A moonlit fairy!"

Then he grinned at Olivia's assistants, "Am I right, ladies?"

"Cut the nonsense!"

Olivia interrupted impatiently. "Where's Isabella? Tell me!"

The launch was about to start. If Isabella was planning a surprise, now was the time!

Amy, flustered, scratched his head again, "I, uh, I don't know!"

"Don't know?"

"Actually, I'm not Isabella's assistant. I was just filling in temporarily!"

Just then, the door behind Amy creaked open, and out stepped the dashing Daniel Harper in a sharp suit. His eyes lit up upon seeing Olivia, the word "stunning" written all over his bright blue eyes.

Seeing Daniel, Amy quickly stepped aside, gesturing, "This is my real boss!"

"Oh, so you've switched bosses. No wonder!"

Olivia's tone carried a hint of sarcasm. It was only natural for people to move on to bigger opportunities, but the thought of Amy leaving Isabella for Daniel irked her.

Meanwhile, Isabella, now disguised as Daniel, had sprayed on cologne and used a voice changer. He stayed a safe distance from Olivia, fearing his cover might be blown. Hearing Olivia's sarcastic remark, he couldn't help but smirk.

This girl, she's quite protective of her man out here, not bad!

"Looks like Olivia doesn't quite like me?" Daniel spoke, his voice deep and slightly raspy, a pleasant sound like sand slipping through fingers.

"Uh, that's not what I meant!"

Olivia glanced at "Daniel," and as their eyes met, she quickly looked down, like a startled rabbit.

Isabella chuckled internally. So shy, yet she wants to snag a big shot!

Seeing that Olivia hadn't recognized him, Isabella decided to tease her. He stepped forward, reaching out to gently take Olivia's hand.
