Title: Love on Set

After the Emily Young incident, Olivia Stewart returned to her peaceful life, but she was a changed woman. The media storm had taught her a thing or two about managing public perception. Now, when she wasn't on set filming, she kept a low profile, leading a simple life.

Every day, Olivia worked on the set, playing the role of a loving partner to the charming Tianyi. Once she wrapped up, she headed home, only to be showered with affection by her real-life boyfriend, the domineering CEO, Isabella Peterson. Love seemed to follow her everywhere!

The filming of "An Angel to Love You" was already halfway through, and Olivia and Tianyi had developed a great on-screen chemistry. The more they acted together, especially during intimate scenes, the more Olivia noticed how eerily similar Tianyi was to Isabella Peterson. Besides the looks and the voice, it was as if Tianyi was Isabella's shadow.

Olivia felt a bit confused. At times, she struggled to distinguish between reality and the world of the film.

Isabella, seeing Olivia's internal conflict, chose not to address it. He was curious to see if Olivia could stay true to herself when faced with another attractive and charming man.

In real life, Isabella was a bold and possessive CEO, expressing his affection for Olivia in direct and intense ways. On-screen, he was a gentle, caring, and attentive sunny-hearted guy. It was as if he was testing which side of him Olivia preferred.

If Olivia knew the truth, she would probably chase Isabella around, calling him a weirdo!

Friday morning, the director announced exciting news on set: they were getting a two-day weekend break!

At first, there was disbelief. A brave crew member even joked, "Director, did you mix up April Fool's Day? Playing tricks on us so early in the morning?"

The director tossed his megaphone in response, "It's a decision from above. Believe it or not!"

From above? Everyone exchanged puzzled looks. In showbiz, working late into the night to meet deadlines or reduce location rental costs was common. Weekend breaks? Unheard of!

After a moment of stunned silence, cheers erupted throughout the set.

Even Olivia, usually composed, was visibly thrilled, jumping around with joy. "Oh my gosh! Our boss is the best!" she shouted, spinning around with her arms wide open. "Boss, I love you to bits!"

The crew joined in, echoing her sentiments. The set was filled with laughter and celebration.

Tianyi, watching from a white deck chair with a cup of coffee, smiled indulgently at the joyful Olivia. It seemed he had kept her confined for too long. It was time to let her relax over the weekend. Amy Green's suggestion had been a good one.

Tianyi handed his coffee cup to Amy, "Double your pay. Tell the finance department."

Amy was stunned but overjoyed, nearly dropping the cup. "Thank you, boss!"

Tianyi rose gracefully, "Prepare the urgent matters for me. I’ll handle them soon."

He planned to finish the day's filming in the morning and deal with company affairs in the afternoon, squeezing in some overtime if needed, to keep the weekend free for Olivia.

"But…" Amy hesitated, "There's a big meeting with a global company on Saturday."

This project was significant, involving major software development and maintenance. A successful deal could have long-term benefits.

"Find someone else," Tianyi replied coolly, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Amy sighed internally. It was risky to leave such a big project to someone else, but once the boss decided, it was final. He'd better figure out a way to postpone the meeting!

As Amy watched Tianyi's tall, retreating figure, he couldn't help but admire him: skipping a billion-dollar project just to spend a weekend with his beloved. Now that's dedication!

Meanwhile, Olivia was still bubbling with laughter.

"Let's get to work!" the director called, and everyone returned to their stations, prepping for the next scenes.

Olivia and Tianyi's scenes were prioritized for the day, a common occurrence due to their lead roles.

"Attention, everyone!"

The cameramen focused their lenses on Olivia and Tianyi, ready to capture a poignant and emotional scene.

Walking down a path strewn with autumn leaves, Olivia's character, Bai Yike, pushed a wheelchair-bound Gu Qianyi. Her expression was one of deep sorrow.

Suddenly, Gu Qianyi stopped the wheelchair, placing his hand over Bai Yike's. "Bai Yike, is something bothering you?"

Bai Yike knelt beside him, turning her face away. "No, nothing."

Gu Qianyi gently lifted her chin, looking into her eyes with concern. "Did my mom say something hurtful again?"

Bai Yike bit her lip, silent, tears welling in her eyes.

Gu Qianyi hit the wheelchair armrest in frustration, "It's this useless body of mine! I've decided, no matter the risk, I'll have the surgery!"

"No!" Bai Yike cried, hugging his legs, tears flowing. "The success rate is only ten percent. Don't be reckless!"

Gu Qianyi's hand trembled as he wiped her tears, determination in his eyes. "Even if there's a one percent chance, I have to try! Bai Yike, believe in me! For you, I'll survive!"

Bai Yike looked at him with matching resolve, "If you choose to fight, I'll stand by you! Live, and I'll live with you! Die, and I'll die with you!"

The poignant background music swelled as they gazed deeply into each other's eyes, a silent vow shared between them.

"Cut!" the director called, pleased with the scene. He gave them a thumbs-up, a rare gesture from such a picky director.

The performance had been perfect—heartbreaking yet filled with hope and love. Olivia's portrayal of impending loss and determination was something even seasoned actors struggled with, yet she had nailed it.

Around them, actors and crew discreetly wiped away tears. Many who had once underestimated Olivia were now moved by her talent.

Even Lisa, who usually held herself above others, couldn't help but secretly admire Olivia's performance.

As the crew prepared for the next scene, Olivia stood still, tears still streaming down her face.

A white handkerchief appeared in front of her. Olivia snapped back to reality, seeing Tianyi offering it with a gentle smile. She took it, whispering, "Thanks."

"Take a break over there," Tianyi suggested softly, his voice soothing like a warm cup of tea.

Olivia followed him to a spot under a tree, sitting in his chair. Despite the scene being over, her emotions lingered.

Tianyi sat beside her, like a caring big brother. "Did you get too into the role? Even you were moved."

"Yeah," Olivia nodded, a bit embarrassed. "The story is so touching."

She gazed at a nearby flower, a hint of sadness and confusion in her eyes.

She hadn't shared the strange feeling with Tianyi. How could she explain it?

Olivia was moved by the characters, for sure. She admired Bai Yike's strength and resilience. But during that scene, she felt an uncanny familiarity, like she'd lived those moments before.

How could that be?
