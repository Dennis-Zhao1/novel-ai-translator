Chapter5: The Wedding Crashers

Olivia Stewart yanked Ethan King into a nearby corner, whispering urgently, "We need to hide!"

Once the bodyguards were out of sight, Ethan turned to her, puzzled. "What happened?"

Olivia grinned sheepishly. "I caused a bit of a scene. They're looking for me."

"Then let's make a run for it!" Ethan exclaimed. "I know this place like the back of my hand. Follow me!"

Ethan, ever the loyal friend, pulled Olivia along. He was the kind of guy who never asked questions or second-guessed her decisions. No matter the situation, he had her back.

While they ran, Olivia recounted her accidental crash into Isabella Peterson's wedding, leaving out the part where Isabella almost tackled her. Ethan's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Wait, Isabella Peterson is really that hot?"

Olivia rolled her eyes. "That's not the point!"

Ethan sighed dreamily, "If I'd known, I'd have volunteered to be the pregnant bride instead!"

"You seriously have no shame!" Olivia shot him a glare. "This was all your idea!"

Today was the wedding of Olivia’s cheating ex-boyfriend, Daniel Johnson, to her former best friend, Lily Young. Ethan had insisted Olivia shake things up a bit, convincing her to disguise herself as a pregnant woman to "liven up" the wedding. Who knew it would lead to this?

"So, what's going on?" Ethan asked as they paused to catch their breath. Olivia twisted his ear playfully. "You told me they were in Hall One! What happened?"

Ethan winced. "Easy there! I swear they were set for Hall One, but last minute changes had them moved to Hall Two. I texted you as soon as I found out and waited outside Hall Two to catch you. But the ceremony was almost over and you never showed, so I went looking for you."

Olivia checked her phone and saw Ethan’s messages. She felt a bit sheepish. "I had my phone on silent. Oops."

Ethan chuckled, rubbing his ear. "No worries. We’re in this together, right?"

They shared a laugh as they continued down the hallway.

"Are you here for the wedding? Please, come in!" a cheerful usher invited them just as they realized they’d wandered back to Hall Two. The massive poster outside showed Daniel and Emily grinning, looking obnoxiously happy.

Olivia felt an urge to tear the poster to shreds.

Ethan gasped dramatically. "Oh no, Olivia, this is my fault. I was so focused on finding a shortcut out of here that I led us right back!"

Olivia was ready to leave, not wanting to see their faces, but Lily and Matthew Johnson, hearing the commotion, approached them.

Olivia lifted her chin defiantly. "Why should I leave?"

She hadn’t managed to disrupt the wedding as planned, so why should she back down now?

"Exactly! We should confront them right here and now. I’m great at making a scene!" Ethan said, raising his hand dramatically until Olivia swatted it down.

"Cut it out with the theatrics! When we confront them, speak clearly and confidently. Don’t embarrass me!"

"Got it!" Ethan said, rolling up his sleeves.

"What are you doing?" Olivia asked, raising an eyebrow.

"Getting ready for a showdown!"

"No need for that. We need to be classy. Act aloof and unbothered. That’ll get under their skin."

As they spoke, Daniel and Lily approached.

"Olivia Stewart!" Daniel’s eyes held a mix of awkwardness and guilt, as well as a touch of nostalgia and courtesy.

Lily, looking even rounder in her tight wedding dress, forced a smile. "Olivia, you came! It means so much that you’re here to bless us!"

Olivia shook off Lily's hand and linked arms with Ethan. "Oh, I forgot to introduce you. This is my new boyfriend."

She pinched Ethan subtly, and though surprised by the sudden role, he quickly played along, wrapping an arm around her waist with an air of cool detachment. "Pleasure to meet you both," he said politely.

Daniel’s eyes flickered with jealousy at the sight of Ethan, who was undeniably handsome and charismatic.

Lily, trying to recall where she’d seen someone like Ethan, noticed Daniel’s gaze lingering on Olivia. Fueled by jealousy, she snapped, "When did you get a new boyfriend, Olivia?"

Olivia smiled casually. "Right around the time you decided to climb into my ex’s bed."

Lily’s face fell, speechless.

Daniel quickly interjected, "Since you're here, why not come in and have a drink with us?"

Olivia smirked. "Too bad I left in a hurry and forgot a gift. Ethan, how much cash do you have?"

Ethan pulled out his wallet, showing two bills. "Twenty bucks."

Olivia added a five from her pocket. "Here, that makes twenty-five."

Ethan handed the money to Daniel with a grin. "Congrats, man! Best wishes on your big day!"

Daniel was left speechless by the cheeky gesture.

Olivia, without another glance at the stunned couple, dragged Ethan away. As they walked off, Ethan flipped Daniel the bird. "Daniel Johnson, you’re even worse than your name suggests! Enjoy your life with Garfield over there, and keep your distance from my friend Olivia!"

"You… you…" Lily stammered, pointing at Ethan, her face flushed with anger.

Daniel, trying to keep the peace, wrapped an arm around Lily's waist, whispering, "Let it go, love. We have guests to entertain."

As they left, Olivia leaned on Ethan’s arm, head held high like a queen. Once they were far enough, she released him, sniffing as she regained her composure.

Ethan tried to cheer her up. "Come on, Olivia. He’s just a cheating jerk! He’s not worth it. He only went for Lily because of her connections. Let him regret it later!"

Olivia sniffed again. "I’m not sad, just frustrated. Did you see Lily’s belly? It’s real, not a pillow. Everything happened so fast. How could he choose her over me, just for some paperwork? And Lily! We used to be best friends!"

Ethan spat, "Best friends? More like the perfect pair of losers. They deserve each other! What’s that saying? Two peas in a pod?"

Olivia burst into laughter at Ethan’s dramatic antics, especially with his exaggerated gestures.

Ethan seized the moment to change the subject. "So, tell me about our handsome hero!"

"Our hero?"

"Yeah, the one you crashed into! What do you think of him?"

The mention of Isabella brought back vivid memories, making Olivia blush. She quickly turned away, mumbling, "It was such a mishap. Thankfully, Isabella was forced into it. Otherwise, I’d be public enemy number one. But now I’m safe. I just hope he can deal with his overbearing mom."

Ethan teased, "Oh, worried, are we? And your lips—are they swollen from his kisses?"

"Shut up! It’s not…"

Olivia’s voice trailed off, her face turning crimson.

"Really? Then what? Don’t tell me a mosquito got you!"

"Ethan, I know I’ve said the best way to get over someone is to start something new, but this is different. You’ve been there for me through everything, and now…"

Ethan cut her off with a laugh. "Hey, I’m just looking out for you. But seriously, did you really… with Isabella?"

Olivia didn’t answer, but the blush on her cheeks said it all.
