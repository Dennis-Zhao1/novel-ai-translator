Isabella Peterson's intense gaze had Olivia Stewart squirming in her seat. She shifted her eyes away, her voice barely above a whisper. "Maybe, uh, maybe not."

"Come on, you don't want to be my girl? Plenty of women would do anything for this offer."

"I'm not that dumb! You rich types have such messy circles. Who knows how many women you've been with? I need to think about my health, you know? What if you have some weird tastes or... hobbies?"

"Okay, stop right there!" Isabella Peterson quickly interrupted, worried Olivia might say something even more shocking. What was she thinking? No wonder Olivia seemed a bit infatuated but not totally captivatedâ€”she had some wild ideas about him!

Isabella felt a wave of helplessness. Maybe he needed to present a different image tonight. But one thing was certain: "The women I set my eyes on never escape me!"

"So, Mr. Heartthrob, how many have you had your eyes on so far?"

"Only one."

Olivia's heart skipped a beat, like a stone tossed into a still pond. But it was just for a moment; her rational side kicked back in. She flicked a peanut into an empty can, musing, "The ultimate teenage heartthrob move. How many innocent girls have fallen for that line?"

"Did you fall for it?"

"Not really."

"So, still zero."

Olivia chuckled, a bit skeptical. She'd been fooled once and wasn't eager to repeat the mistake. Isabella watched her with a mix of frustration and amusement. Maybe Olivia wasn't like anyone he'd met before; she was sharp and a bit prickly compared to the sweet and gentle types he was used to.

"You're working at a gym, right? How much do you make a month?"

Her eyes widened. "How do you know? Did you... investigate me?"

Isabella sipped his coffee, looking every bit the aloof aristocrat. "Just tell me, how much?"

Embarrassed, Olivia looked down and held up a hand, folding down one finger.

"Forty thousand? That's low."

She sighed, "Uh, it's four thousand."

"Is that a joke? You kidding me?"

Olivia found discussing money with the wealthy to be a blow to her self-esteem. After a pause, she looked up to find Isabella staring at her like she was clueless.

"I make millions every minute, and you make that in a month? That's... something."

Olivia felt like crying. "In this city, even street sweepers need a degree and a couple of languages. I didn't even finish college..."

Isabella smirked. "Short on cash, huh?"

"Duh!" She tossed another peanut. "Who wouldn't want more money?"

"Stick with me, and your income will skyrocket a hundred times."

"..."

"Not enough? How about a blank check every month? Fill in whatever amount you want."

Olivia's eyes widened. She stared at Isabella, her face turning serious and her voice steady, "Isabella Peterson, I do like money, but I have my limits."

In that moment, Isabella couldn't decide if he was pleased or disappointed. He glanced at his watch, and in a rare moment of gentlemanly grace, offered, "It's getting late. Let me take you home."

Olivia wobbled as she stood, still a bit dazed but clear-headed. "Isabella, we're not that close. Let Ethan come back and I'll manage on my own."

Does she have to make it so clear? And think about another guy too!

Isabella shot her a chilly look. "Want me to carry you, or should my bodyguards do it? Your choice."

She stumbled, grabbing the table for support. "Isabella Peterson, you're pushing it! I could scream and have all those gold diggers and fangirls swarm you!"

"Go ahead. Want a megaphone? Michael, bring her a mic. Oh, and my mom's still looking for that woman carrying her precious grandchild, right?"

"Yes, sir. Everyone's out searching. She said she'll turn the city upside down if needed."

Olivia deflated, reaching for Isabella's hand. "You're ruthless!"

Isabella slipped on his sunglasses and effortlessly scooped her up, marching out with her in his arms. Olivia clung to him, her face flushed with embarrassment, as she buried it in his chest, feeling as meek as a kitten.

Isabella tightened his grip, whispering into her ear teasingly, "Forgot to mention, my mom might seem gentle, but she's the fiercest in the family. Hates being lied to. I'd suggest you get pregnant with my kid soon, like tonight..."

Olivia shivered. "In your dreams!"

"Don't say I didn't warn you."

Furious, she bit his shoulder.

"Ugh..."

Isabella winced but quickened his pace. Did she even realize what she was doing?

As they left the bustling restaurant, Olivia peeked out, scanning for Ethan, but he was nowhere in sight. She tried wriggling free but failed, so she took a deep breath and yelled, "Help! I'm being kidnapped!"

Already drawing attention with his entourage, Isabella's striking looks and commanding presence had all eyes on them. Olivia ducked back into his arms, smirking behind her cover.

Isabella, still carrying her, tightened his hold, ignoring the crowd's whistles and cheers. Some onlookers even shouted for a kiss.

Olivia buried her face deeper, cheeks burning.

Ethan, restrained by guards at the street corner, saw Olivia and shouted, "Olivia! Olivia!"

She tried to lift her head, but Isabella pushed it back down. "Stay still if you don't want me to lose it right here."

Reluctantly, she nestled into him, fuming silently. She wiggled, trying to make herself comfortable, inadvertently rubbing against him.

"Stop moving!"

This girl was driving him crazy.

Isabella picked up the pace. He had to get out of there before he lost control.

Trailing behind, Ethan walked with a heavy heart, watching the duo ahead.

When they reached the convoy, Isabella's driver opened the door with a bow. "Sir, please."

Isabella settled Olivia inside with care. The closing door echoed in Olivia's ears, her heart pounding as she feared Isabella might get carried away right in the car. She pretended to sleep, though her tension was clear from her clenched fists.

Isabella noticed, amused by her antics. He adjusted his position, making her more comfortable.

The driver turned and asked, "To the hotel or...?"

"My place."

Olivia bolted upright. "Wait, what?"

Isabella chuckled. "Awake already? And so eager?"

Eager? It took her a moment to process, then she panicked, "Uh, I meant to say, take me home."

"And then?"

"Then... uh, I'm tired, I'll sleep."

She slumped back, eyes closed.

Isabella relaxed in his seat, nudging her gently. "Really asleep? You know, pretending won't help. If I wanted to, you'd be out of time."

And with that, the car headed into the night, leaving the bustling streets behind.
