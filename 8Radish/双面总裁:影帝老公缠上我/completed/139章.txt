...Isabella Peterson's frown deepened, but the anger in her eyes softened a bit. She took a step forward and quickly scooped Olivia Stewart into her arms, settling her down on a nearby couch. Olivia, still sniffling, couldn't help but feel a wave of relief mixed with the residual embarrassment of the whole ordeal.

"You're such a handful," Isabella sighed, brushing a stray tear from Olivia's cheek. "You know I can't stand seeing you hurt."

"I know," Olivia mumbled, feeling a mix of guilt and gratitude. She glanced up at Isabella, trying to muster a sheepish smile. "I just... I wanted to help, you know? I thought I could fix things."

Isabella shook her head, her expression softening further. "You can't always fix everything, Olivia. Sometimes, you just need to let others handle it."

Olivia nodded, her resolve mingling with a bit of stubbornness. "I'll try," she promised, her voice a little stronger now.

With a gentle squeeze of her shoulder, Isabella relented. "Good. Now, let's get you patched up properly. No more cowboy antics, alright?"

Olivia grinned, despite everything. "Alright, no more cowboy antics."

As the tension in the room dissolved, Isabella's stern demeanor gave way to a more tender concern, and she set about taking care of Olivia's scrapes and bruises. It wasn't just about physical wounds, but also about mending the trust and understanding between them.

And as Olivia sat there, surrounded by the comforting chaos of papers and books, she felt a sense of belonging she hadn't realized she’d been missing. Sure, there would be more hurdles to jump and more misunderstandings to clear, but for now, she was content to be right where she was—under the watchful, albeit sometimes overbearing, eye of Isabella Peterson.
