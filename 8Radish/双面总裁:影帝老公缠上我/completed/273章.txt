"Hey Ethan, can I get your autograph?" Olivia Stewart's morning was off to a dramatic start, as usual. White Mia, her rival in everything from fashion to family feuds, had burst into her room earlier, demanding a share of the jewelry their father had sent over. Olivia, with her usual devilish smile, had simply claimed she liked all the pieces, leaving White Mia and her mother, Grace Martin, fuming.

Grace, with a forced smile, tried to maintain the peace, "Let your sister have them, Mia. You're the older one, after all." But Olivia could see the frustration simmering beneath her calm exterior. She knew how to push their buttons, and today she was hitting all the right notes.

Just as the mother-daughter duo was about to leave, Ethan King emerged from the kitchen, carrying a plate of steaming pancakes. Mia, not missing a beat, brightened up and called out, "Ethan!" But Ethan was unfazed. He simply set the pancakes on the table and turned to Olivia with a warm smile, "Breakfast is ready. Come on over."

Mia couldn't hide her envy. "Your luck is something else, Olivia," she commented, trying to mask her jealousy with sweetness. Olivia, however, wasn't having it. "Cut it out, Mia. It's nauseating," she snapped, clearly irritated by Mia's pretense.

Mia, undeterred, sidled up to Ethan, "I've watched your fashion shows, you know. I'm a huge fan!" But Ethan was too busy tending to Olivia, cooling down the pancakes before placing them on her plate.

Mia, desperate for attention, tried again, "Ethan, I've got a remedy for that...uh, issue you have." Olivia, who was mid-bite, nearly choked on her pancake, causing Ethan to give her a frosty look. "Are you trying to gross Olivia out?" he asked Mia, his voice like ice.

Mia, flustered, quickly backpedaled, "Oh no, I just heard from Olivia and thought I'd help!" Ethan turned his gaze to Olivia, who sheepishly admitted, "I might have made that up when you were in the kitchen..."

Ethan, shaking his head, tapped Olivia lightly on the forehead, "You're something else. Why would you do that to yourself?" His tone was teasing, and Olivia couldn't help but smile, despite the chaos.

Mia, still trying to salvage her pride, asked again for Ethan's autograph, pointing to a spot on her shirt that left little to the imagination. Olivia couldn't help but chuckle, "Well, that's bold."

Ethan, however, had enough. He grabbed a broom from the kitchen and pointed it at Mia, "Are you going to leave on your own, or do I have to show you the door?" Mia, finally defeated, ran out with tears in her eyes.

As Olivia watched her go, she burst into laughter, "Oh man, I haven't had this much fun in ages."

But the light-hearted moment was brief. The day of the welcome back party was fast approaching, and Olivia, despite her nonchalance, knew she had to make an appearance. She was back in the family fold, after all, and the world was watching.

Ethan helped her get ready, handling the swarm of designers who had descended upon the hotel to prepare her for the event. Olivia, though, was in no rush. Her pregnancy had made her appreciate the slower pace of life, and she was in no mood to be fussed over.

"Olivia, you can't wear that!" the head designer exclaimed, eyeing her loose-fitting home attire. Olivia shot him a cool glance, "Listen, I'm pregnant. I can't use half the stuff you want me to. If it's not comfortable, I'm not wearing it. Got it?"

The designer nodded hastily, "Of course, Miss Stewart. We'll make sure everything's perfectly natural and safe. And the dress, have you tried it? We can make adjustments if needed."

Olivia knew the dress was tailored to her exact measurements, but she appreciated the concern. "Just keep it simple," she instructed, waving them off.

When it was time for the party, Olivia emerged in her dress, all eyes turned to her. Despite her simple request, she looked effortlessly stunning, and for a moment, all the drama and scheming faded away. Tonight, she was the star, and she intended to shine.
