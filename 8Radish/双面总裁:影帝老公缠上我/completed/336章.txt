可爱的Olivia Stewart

“Chloe, why don't you take a break here? I'll go see what's up!” Grace Martin suggested with a nod, fixing her wind-tossed hair. Just then, she noticed Olivia Stewart walking gracefully towards them, with two angelic children in tow.

Grace tugged at Benjamin Murphy's sleeve, so taken aback that she stammered, “H-honey...”

“What’s the matter?” Benjamin asked, following Grace's gaze. His jaw dropped in surprise as he spotted Olivia.

When Olivia finally reached them, Benjamin managed to stutter, “Olivia Stewart!”

Olivia glanced at Benjamin without any hint of recognition.

Grace's eyes welled up with tears. “Olivia, we've been looking everywhere for you! Don't you remember, we are your—”

“Cough, cough!” Benjamin interrupted with a heavy cough, giving Grace a stern sideways glance to stop her from continuing.

Olivia was known to be battling depression, and in her current state, any shock could be detrimental.

Grace looked at Benjamin's serious expression and then back at Olivia, who seemed distant and calm. Realizing her mistake, she wiped away her tears and continued to gaze at Olivia.

Olivia was truly a striking young woman, reminiscent of Grace's own youth. Grace couldn't help but feel a pang of regret. If only she had embraced Olivia when Benjamin had first suggested reconnecting, instead of letting their other daughter, Lily, and her husband, Oliver, interfere.

Oliver had disappeared with a chunk of their savings when their business fell apart. None of their children seemed to have turned out well, except for Olivia. Now, Grace saw her in a new light, recognizing her as a remarkable daughter.

The regret was palpable. Grace thought about how she had pushed away such a wonderful daughter. If she had been more accepting from the start, maybe things would have been different.

As Grace was lost in thought, she noticed the two children with Olivia were watching her curiously.

Coco, the older child, stepped forward protectively, despite being barely two. He had a strong sense of duty to protect his mom and sister.

Meanwhile, Gigi, with her big, curious eyes, was a bundle of mischief and imagination. She was the kind of kid who was impossible to fool.

Gigi blinked up at Grace and asked, “Why are you staring at my mommy? It's not polite, even if she is pretty!”

Grace blushed, quickly shifting her gaze to Gigi's adorable face. She beamed and bent down, wanting to pinch Gigi’s cheeks.

Gigi stepped back swiftly, while Coco moved to block Grace with his little arms.

Grace retracted her hand awkwardly and asked with a smile, “What are your names, sweeties?”

“We’re not telling you!” Gigi responded promptly, turning to Coco. “Let's go, brother! She smiles like the big bad wolf!”

Grace couldn’t help but chuckle at Gigi’s honesty, watching as the children led Olivia away.

“They're Olivia's twins? They're just adorable!” Grace murmured, her eyes glued to their retreating figures.

Benjamin, though also reluctant to part, was more composed. He patted Grace's back gently, comforting her. “We've found them. We’ll have plenty of chances to see them, but let's not rush things. Olivia is still recovering. We don’t want to upset her or the kids. We need to build a relationship first, or we’ll scare them away.”

Grace nodded, wiping away another tear.

Benjamin scanned the bustling crowd and spotted Olivia and the children watching the commotion from the side. He nudged Grace, “Let's go check it out. It’d be great if we could stay here at the ranch!”

“Really? We can stay?” Grace’s eyes lit up, and she quickly dried her tears, following Benjamin.

At the ranch, they were hiring workers. Business was booming, and they were short-staffed. The workers were demanding higher wages, causing a delay in hiring.

Benjamin squeezed into the crowd and shouted, “Hire me! I’ll work for meals, no wages needed!”

The crowd fell silent, turning to Benjamin with incredulous looks. Was this guy for real?

The ranch manager, adjusting his glasses, eyed Benjamin skeptically. Despite his simple attire, Benjamin looked more like a gentleman than a laborer.

“Are you here to cause trouble?” the manager asked coldly. “I’m busy.”

“No, I really want to work here. I just saw how competitive it was and thought I’d try this approach. Please, understand!” Benjamin pleaded earnestly.

His years in business had honed his ability to read people, and he saw the manager’s hesitation. After all, where could you find a worker who didn’t ask for pay?

Seeing Benjamin’s desperation, the manager reconsidered. “Alright, you can stay for now.”

Benjamin smiled sheepishly, “Could my wife stay too? She’s not strong, but she can learn to help in the kitchen. We won’t be as skilled, but we won’t be a burden either.”

The manager squinted at Grace. A woman accustomed to luxury helping in the kitchen? But free labor was hard to pass up.

“Wait over there,” the manager said. “After I’m done, we’ll see if you can keep up. If not, you’ll have to leave.”

Benjamin nodded eagerly, “Thank you, we’ll do our best!”

His eagerness drew disdainful stares from the other workers. They feared losing their jobs because of his willingness to work for meals.

After seeing Benjamin’s example, other workers reluctantly signed their contracts, worried about losing their jobs.

The manager, pleased with the unexpected ease of hiring, ordered the workers to start mowing the fields.

As the workers got to it, the manager approached Benjamin, curious about his eagerness. But there Benjamin stood, cluelessly holding the machine.

“You’re not working?” the manager asked, unimpressed. “If you’re just here to freeload, I can’t have you.”

Benjamin’s face turned red as he admitted, “I don’t know how to use it.”

He had never done physical labor, having climbed the corporate ladder to become a pampered CEO. He’d never even seen a lawnmower before.

The manager sighed in frustration. “If you can’t use the machine, why are you here? Leave!”

“Please,” Benjamin pleaded, “give me a chance to learn!”

“By the time you learn, the grass will be gone. Go!” the manager insisted, not in the mood for more talk.

The surrounding workers snickered, having no sympathy for Benjamin, whose tactics had forced them to lower their wage demands.

Benjamin felt humiliated. He was used to schmoozing with high society, not being laughed at by workers.

“Why are you all laughing?” A small voice chimed in. It was Gigi, defending Benjamin against the crowd.

Gigi, with her tiny steps, approached the manager. “Please, Mr. Manager, help him out!”

“Gigi, what are you doing here?” The manager bent down, smiling warmly at her. She was not only adorable but also highly regarded by the ranch owner, making her someone to tread carefully with.
