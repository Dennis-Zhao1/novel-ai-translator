Ethan King was rambling on the phone, his words slurred with the edge of intoxication. "Hey Olivia, I'm all alone at home. Want to come over and take care of me?" he laughed, half-jokingly. It was like he and Isabella Peterson were on the same wavelength, both thinking the same thing at the same time.

Olivia Stewart rolled her eyes, speechless. Meanwhile, Isabella, who was listening in, just got more mischievous. She wrapped an arm around Olivia, pulling her close while her other hand wandered, stirring up trouble. Her lips were busy too, teasing Olivia mercilessly.

"I was just thinking..." Olivia started to say, her voice trembling, losing its usual soft tone. It was like a cat's paw scratching at your heart, so captivating it was.

Isabella was delighted with the effect and kept up the mischief. "If you're alone, I'll call Emma Thomas right now to come take care of you," Olivia managed to say through gritted teeth, nearly dropping the phone. Her voice was so off-key it sounded like a trendy online personality.

Even a fool could guess what was happening!

Silence fell on the other end of the line.

After a long pause, Ethan spoke again, sounding ancient and weary. "No need. I'm fine. I just wanted to make sure Isabella wasn't giving you a hard time."

Olivia struggled to speak, trying to fend off Isabella while holding the phone. "No, no! He's... he's good to me!"

More than good, in fact.

"Well, that's good then. I'll hang up now." For the first time, Ethan was the one to end the call, leaving behind a note of restrained pain in his voice.

"Crazy..." Olivia whispered, feeling guilty as the dial tone echoed in her ears. "Sorry."

With the call over, Isabella finally stopped her playful attacks. Olivia turned to glare at her, annoyed. "This is all your fault!"

Isabella raised an eyebrow, grinning. "What, can't a guy pamper his own girl?"

"You're incorrigible," Olivia huffed. "You did that on purpose!"

"Yep, I did," Isabella admitted shamelessly. "Who calls at this hour anyway?"

Olivia was speechless again. "Fine, fine, let's just sleep," Isabella said, tossing Olivia's phone somewhere across the room.

"Isabella!" Olivia shouted, watching helplessly as her phone vanished.

"I'm here," Isabella replied, wrapping Olivia in a tight embrace, her lips finding her cheek again.

"Ugh," Olivia groaned, trying to wriggle away as Isabella's hand went wandering again.

"Isabella, you jerk!"

Olivia pushed him away with all her strength. "Can you give me some respect?"

"Respect? Can't you see I'm trying to make you happy?" Isabella said, feigning innocence.

"Happy?" Olivia rolled her eyes. "You're just amusing yourself!"

"True, but if I'm happy, aren't you too?"

"Not if I'm not in the mood!"

Isabella's expression darkened. "Because of that guy's call, you're not in the mood with me?"

"He's my friend! My only real friend in this city! He just got back, and I only had dinner with him. You threw a fit and had your guards fetch me here, and then you made it awkward when he called. Do you think I'm in any mood now?"

Olivia's personality was like a cat'sâ€”seemingly docile and timid until provoked. Then she'd lash out just like now.

Isabella's voice turned icy. "So you'd hurt me over him?"

Olivia sighed, frustrated. "You don't get it. I value his friendship. You just don't understand."

"Fine, I won't argue. I'll sleep in the guest room," Olivia said, turning to leave, but Isabella pulled her back, tossing her onto the plush bed.

"Just a call, and you refuse me? Who gave you the nerve? You're mine!" Isabella shouted angrily.

Olivia laughed bitterly. She was just a rented girlfriend, after all. Isabella could pamper or discard her at will. What right did she have to say no?

Isabella was stung by Olivia's bitter smile. He bent down, punishing her with a sharp bite, leaving a mark on her neck.

The sting brought tears to Olivia's eyes, and they silently fell down her cheeks. Isabella paused, releasing her, seeing the mark he'd left.

"Say you'll ignore him, and I'll forgive you," he demanded.

Olivia's smile was even more bitter. "I can't. You don't understand what Ethan means to me. He was there when I had no one else."

Isabella's eyes grew colder. "And me? I'm nothing?"

Olivia sighed. "You haven't been through what we have. I can't explain it."

Isabella punched the bed in frustration. "That guy just wants you! Foolish!"

Olivia continued, "You've been good to me, but I can't forget myself. You want me to be someone I'm not. I can't just be an imitation."

Her words hit Isabella hard. He stood there, staring down at her, questioning his place in her life.

Eventually, he asked, "What am I to you? Everything I've done... does it mean nothing?"
