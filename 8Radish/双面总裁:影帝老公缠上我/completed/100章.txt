Sophie Cook's Schemes

“Sir, you mustn't!”

With an urgent shout, the door behind Isabella Peterson burst open. She turned to see the elderly butler, Lucas Wright, stumbling in, his face etched with desperation. Her brows knitted together with a hint of annoyance. “Lucas, are you rebelling?”

Lucas dropped to his knees with a thud, bowing his head deeply. “I’m sorry, sir, but Olivia Stewart is still unconscious. Please, have mercy on her at a time like this!”

“Damn it!” Isabella cursed under her breath. “Can’t a guy even steal a kiss from his own girl?”

Lucas looked up, bewildered, before realizing his mistake and quickly lowering his gaze again. “I apologize, sir.”

Isabella shot him a cold glare. “Get out!”

Lucas stood up, casting a worried glance at the peacefully sleeping Olivia Stewart before retreating from the room. Ever since Olivia’s accident, the always-cheerful old man hadn’t smiled once. His hair seemed whiter, his face more lined, as if he had aged a decade overnight.

Isabella didn’t blame Lucas, but the butler was burdened with guilt. If only he’d noticed something was wrong when Olivia’s phone was off, if only he’d sent someone to check on her sooner, if only he’d dispatched more people to search every exit, perhaps Olivia wouldn’t have suffered so much fear and distress. But it was too late now.

Even though the situation hadn’t reached the point of no return, Olivia was still unconscious, and Isabella hadn’t slept in days. Lucas felt he had failed them both.

For two whole days and nights, Isabella kept vigil by Olivia’s bedside, just as Lucas stood silently outside the door. It was a miracle the elderly man hadn’t collapsed yet.

A servant rushed up, bowing slightly to Lucas. “Mr. Wright, Miss Sophie Cook is insisting on seeing Olivia Stewart again!”

Lucas waved his hand slowly. “Have her wait. I’ll inform the master first.”

He knocked lightly on the door. “Knock, knock!”

After a moment, Isabella’s deep voice responded from inside. “Enter!”

Lucas opened the door, stood at the threshold, and bowed slightly to Isabella. “Sir, Olivia Stewart’s sister wants to visit her.”

“Tell her to get lost!” Isabella shouted, but quickly remembered the doctor’s advice and reluctantly amended his order. “Fine, have someone bring her in.”

“Yes, sir!” Lucas nodded and left swiftly. He knew there was no use lamenting the past. For now, all he could do was manage the affairs of the estate, hoping to make amends before he was inevitably dismissed.

Isabella turned back to Olivia, gently taking her bandaged hand into her own, caressing the uninjured skin. She suddenly leaned down, pressing her face into Olivia’s hand, whispering fiercely, “You fool, Olivia! How could you face all that danger alone? You could have escaped, but you chose to save Sophie Cook instead. Don’t you see that your sister’s no good? If she truly cared for you, she wouldn’t have run away.”

Isabella had no fondness for Olivia’s sister, Sophie Cook. The mere thought of her falling into his arms that day was repulsive. It angered him that when Olivia was humiliated and in danger, Sophie fled and later returned with a crowd, supposedly to save Olivia, but really just to witness her disgrace.

If she weren’t Olivia’s sister, Isabella would’ve had her tossed into the lake long ago. But to Olivia, Sophie was family, and that’s what mattered.

Isabella raised his head with a fierce glint in his eyes, his tone commanding, “Enough, Olivia. You’ve slept long enough. Wake up already! Do you know where Sophie Cook is? She’s at the castle by the lake, her leg broken, unable to walk. If you don’t wake up, I’ll let the guards have their way with her!”

“No, please, no…” Olivia murmured, stirring restlessly, her eyes shut tight, her hands flailing in the air.

Isabella’s heart ached, but he didn’t rush to comfort her as he usually would. Since falling into a coma, Olivia had been like this—peaceful one moment, then trapped in a nightmare the next, crying out and thrashing about.

At first, Isabella thought she was waking up, but nothing he did seemed to rouse her. The doctor had explained, “Sir, she’s not dreaming. She’s still unconscious, but the trauma was so severe that even in this state, she’s haunted by terrifying visions.”

“What am I supposed to do?” Isabella had asked desperately.

“Comfort her, give her a sense of safety.”

So Isabella had stayed by her side, day and night, comforting her through every episode, holding her tightly, offering warmth and reassurance. As he soothed her, Olivia would gradually calm down, returning to peaceful slumber.

Over the past two days, Olivia’s expression had become more relaxed, her episodes less frequent. Yet, despite Isabella’s constant care, there was still no sign of her waking up.

What was it that kept Olivia from returning to the world?

“No, stay away! Don’t touch her! Get lost, you bastards!” Olivia cried out again, her face twisted in agony, her body drenched in cold sweat.

Isabella watched her struggle, his lips pressed into a thin line, his body rigid, fists clenched at his sides. No, he couldn’t hold her. He had to spark her will to live.

Fighting the urge to embrace her, Isabella spoke with a fierce determination, “If you want to save your sister, wake up! As soon as you open your eyes, I’ll bring Sophie Cook to you!”

Olivia’s lips moved, but Isabella’s commanding voice drowned out her whispered words. “Isabella, they didn’t touch me. I’m not dirty, really…”

“Knock, knock!”

A soft knock echoed from the door.

“Enter!”

The door swung open, and Sophie Cook hobbled in, crying out, “Sis!”

She lunged forward, almost colliding with Isabella. He stepped aside just in time, but she still brushed against his arm, leaving a warm, soft sensation in her wake.

The contact infuriated Isabella. He was about to reprimand her when Sophie, seemingly oblivious, flung herself onto Olivia, sobbing, “Sis! Sis!”

Isabella held back, moving aside and wiping his arm with a towel, disgusted. He turned to Sophie and said, “If you can wake your sister, I’ll give you whatever you want.”

“Wake up, sis, please!” Sophie wailed, shaking Olivia’s arm, tears streaming down her face. “It’s my fault, I was late, and you got hurt…”

“Who got hurt?” Isabella’s voice boomed like thunder, silencing Sophie instantly. She turned to see his face dark with anger, his eyes sharp and menacing.

“If you can’t speak properly, get out!” he barked.

“I’m sorry, Isabella. I just spoke without thinking,” Sophie replied, her voice trembling.

“If you truly cared for your sister, would you speak like that? I can’t believe Olivia has a sister like you.”

Sophie had learned during her stay that Isabella had an intense aversion to dirt and disorder. She’d hoped to insinuate that Olivia was somehow tainted, but her plan backfired spectacularly. Now, she dared not provoke him further, instead clutching Olivia’s hand, whispering softly, “Sis, sis…”

Though her voice was mournful, her lowered eyes gleamed with a smug satisfaction. She’d timed her arrival perfectly that day, leading a crowd under the guise of rescuing Olivia, ensuring everyone saw her at her worst.

While Olivia hadn’t been harmed, her disheveled state was enough for the onlookers. With Isabella’s disdain for imperfection, even if he didn’t cast her aside now, he would eventually. And then, Sophie’s chance would come.

Sophie had been visiting Olivia under the pretense of sisterly concern, but her real motive was to get closer to Isabella. She was confident that her subtle advances had been successful, unaware that Isabella found her presence repulsive, wiping his arm repeatedly with the towel.
