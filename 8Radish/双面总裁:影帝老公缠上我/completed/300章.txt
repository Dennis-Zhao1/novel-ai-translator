Olivia Stewart couldn't believe she was feeling jealous of Mia White. Clutching a string of beads tightly, her face was pale as she processed the revelation. Memories flooded back—her mother had never shown her kindness, yet Olivia had always strived to be a good daughter, yearning for her approval. Now, she finally understood why her mother never liked her.

In the White family, Olivia was merely a stepping stone for her mother to climb the social ladder. After marrying her stepfather, she became her mother's lifelong disgrace.

Grace Martin, standing across from Olivia, let out a mocking laugh. "You wanted to hear it, didn't you? Must be tough to swallow."

"Look at your mother, then look at yourself! Your mom was always after other people's men, and now you're doing the same. Like mother, like daughter!"

"Shut up!" Olivia shouted, her eyes blazing red. She raised her hand to slap Grace but stopped just short of her bandaged face.

Her mother's manipulative past was undeniable, and Olivia was living proof. Now, her own fiancé, Isabella Peterson, was originally engaged to Mia White. Whether it was a business arrangement or not, if Olivia hadn't disrupted their wedding, Mia would be the one standing beside Isabella now.

Olivia's hand fell limply to her side, her resolve crumbling. A wave of confusion and despair washed over her, impossible to suppress. 

She took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. After a long pause, she looked at Grace with a cold gaze. "You claim these beads are yours? Do you have any proof?"

Grace smirked. "I've worn them for years; I recognize them instantly. I don't need proof. Sophia Allen and Daniel Johnson were fools not to sell them off."

Grace's words were laced with contempt and a touch of pride. 

"No proof means you're just a mad dog barking at random," Olivia shot back, clinging to the last vestiges of her dignity.

"If you really want proof..." Grace tilted her head thoughtfully. "My grandmother's family name was Lane. One of the beads has a 'Lane' inscribed inside."

With a sharp snap, Olivia's string of beads broke in her hand, scattering across the floor. Her face went even paler, and she bit her lip hard.

After a moment, she forced herself to speak in an even tone. "I'll make sure your face is treated, but that's all I'll do."

With that, Olivia turned and fled, as if escaping a looming disaster.

"Wait!" Grace called out.

Olivia paused but didn't turn. "What is it?"

Grace struggled to sit up, bowing her head on the bed in a gesture of submission. "I know I've done terrible things, but Mia isn't at fault. Please, let her go."

"Every time I hurt you, it was my idea. She just got dragged along."

"If I could, I'd let my face rot if it meant giving Mia a chance to heal. Olivia, whether you acknowledge it or not, Mia is your sister."

Olivia didn't look back, but the sound of Grace's head hitting the bed echoed painfully in her ears, each thud a loud reminder of her own family's twisted love.

Grace Martin might be malicious, with a heart full of schemes, but one thing was clear—she loved her daughter. Despite her misdeeds, everything was for Mia.

And what about Olivia? She had wealth, a doting partner, and a lovely child, but she lacked a family she could lean on, trust, and cry freely with.

Her stepfather was greedy, her biological father calculated, and her sister plotted against her. Even her mother, who left her the beads, did so not because they were valuable, but because she thought they were worthless.

Her mother wanted Olivia to feel grateful and take care of her sister, Sophie Cook, after her death.

This was Olivia Stewart's family. Her mother.

Olivia hadn't shed a tear through all she'd heard, but as Grace pleaded, she found herself crying.

In that moment, Olivia realized she envied Mia White. Envy so deep it bordered on jealousy.

"Don't worry, I'll make sure she's treated," Olivia said before leaving quickly.

Outside, David Wright was startled by Olivia's tears. "Ma'am!"

Olivia wiped her face, embarrassed. "I'm fine. Just heard some unpleasant things and felt a bit upset."

David nodded, "I'll take you home to rest right away."

"Okay." As they walked, Olivia instructed, "Get them treated. Just the external injuries; no need for cosmetic treatment. Once they're healed, you don't need to concern yourself with them."

"Yes, ma'am!" David replied, glancing at Olivia's retreating back. She seemed so fragile yet strong.

On the way home, Olivia's face was somber. She stared out the window, lost in thought.

The sound of those beads hitting the floor echoed in her mind, but she didn't bother collecting them.

If she hadn't returned for the beads, she might never have met Isabella Peterson. Perhaps that was a small blessing amid the chaos.

A bitter smile appeared on Olivia's lips. At least she had a man who loved her and a precious child. That was enough.

She comforted herself, gradually calming down.

By the time they reached her home, Olivia wore a serene expression. Seeing the housekeeper holding Cocoa and Berry, she greeted them with a warm smile.

David Wright noted Olivia's soft smile and felt reassured. He debated whether to report the incident to his employer but decided against it. Since Olivia wanted to handle it herself, he figured it best to respect her wishes.

Unbeknownst to him, Olivia's calm exterior masked deeper turmoil.

Meanwhile, Isabella Peterson learned of the incident at the shelter. Since Olivia wanted to handle it, he pretended ignorance, ensuring only that Grace and her daughter couldn't cause more harm.

Reflecting on Olivia's punishment for Grace, Isabella chuckled softly, "A little devil, isn't she?"

If he had known about Olivia's tears at the hospital, he might not have found it so amusing.

Unfortunately, no one informed him.

Thus, he missed Olivia's subtle signs of distress until her depression resurfaced.

That evening, Isabella returned home from work. Noticing Olivia's low spirits during dinner, he gently pulled her close. "Why do you look so upset?"

Olivia managed a small smile. "Just a bit tired."

"Taking care of two kids is exhausting! You insist on doing everything yourself. Let the staff handle some things," Isabella chided gently, examining her hands. "Where's your bracelet?"

Olivia's expression faltered. "I accidentally broke it today."

"No wonder you looked so down!" Isabella teased, tapping her nose. "I'll have it fixed. Smile for me?"

Olivia forced a smile, more like a grimace.

Isabella raised an eyebrow, unsatisfied. "I said I'd fix it. Why the long face?"

Olivia lowered her gaze. "The beads shattered; they can't be fixed." Besides, there's no point in repairing it.

"Then... how about a new one?"

Isabella wasn't sure how to console her, knowing the bracelet's significance.

Olivia blinked back tears. "No more rosewood beads. I want something else."

Her tone suggested a farewell to the past.

Isabella, who never held much affection for Olivia's opportunistic family, was pleased. He quickly offered her some nourishing soup.

"Eat up, darling. Afterward, your husband will take you shopping!"

Olivia playfully punched his chest, shooting him a mock glare. They hadn't even had their official wedding, yet he was already calling himself her husband so casually.

The staff was used to their displays of affection, keeping their heads down to avoid intruding.

After finishing her soup, Olivia tried to slip off Isabella's lap, but his arms tightened around her waist.

"Isabella, you..."

"Let me hold you," he whispered, resting his chin on her shoulder, his warm breath tickling her ear. "Just a hug, I promise."

That was anything but "just a hug."

Olivia's ears turned red as she sat stiffly in his lap, too nervous to move, fearing he'd playfully embarrass her in front of the staff.
