Title: The Drama Queen Returns

Olivia Stewart was pacing around the film set, her nerves on edge. "No worries, Olivia," the assistant reassured her with a smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. "Sophie Cook's just taking a break at home. No scenes for her today."

"Thanks!" she replied, though doubt still pricked at her mind. It had been days since Olivia had seen Sophie Cook, and the absence weighed heavy on her heart. Her phone became a fidget toy, taken out and put back into her pocket repeatedly as she battled the urge to call her.

Maybe she'd spoiled Sophie too much, letting her get away with too much, and it was time for Sophie to grow up.

By Friday, Sophie finally showed up. Olivia's heart sighed in relief, though she maintained a cool exterior. Despite her worry, she kept her expression neutral.

On set, Sophie was the picture of obedience, serving tea with her eyes downcast and speaking only when necessary. Olivia dismissed it as Sophie getting into character, until during breaks, she noticed Sophie huddled in a corner, looking like a lost kitten, glancing around anxiously.

The sight dragged Olivia back to when their mom passed away, and their dad was lost to the bottle, leaving Olivia to find Sophie curled up just like she was now.

Her heart ached, and she rushed over. "Sophie!"

"Olivia?" Sophie looked up, startled, like a frightened bird.

"I didn't mean to, Olivia! I didn't want to hurt you! Please, don't let them hit me again. I'll stay away, I promise!"

The panic in Sophie's voice was tangible, and Olivia's worry deepened. She reached out to comfort her sister. "Sophie, what happened?"

But Sophie flinched away like Olivia's hand was fire, fleeing to the restroom and slamming the door.

"Sophie!" Olivia called, trailing after her. Through the slightly ajar door, she saw Sophie huddled in a stall, shaking.

"Sophie, it's okay," Olivia soothed, entering the stall and kneeling beside her. She placed a gentle hand on Sophie's shoulder. "It's just us here. No one's going to hurt you. Tell me what happened."

With that, Sophie burst into tears, collapsing into Olivia's arms. Olivia held her close, memories of their shared grief flooding back. When their mom died, Sophie had been just thirteen, and Olivia, barely eighteen, had shielded her sister from the world as best she could.

Olivia had worked hard to send Sophie to the prestigious film academy, only to watch her innocence get swallowed by the industry's harshness.

Sophie's sobs subsided into sniffles, and Olivia wiped her tears. "What happened, Sophie?"

"I was wrong, Olivia. I was jealous of you... I got what I deserved. Please forgive me."

Olivia's heart twisted. She had been ready to let Sophie learn her lesson, but seeing her so vulnerable brought back their early struggles. She hugged Sophie tighter. "You're my sister, always."

"Olivia," Sophie said, her voice small and remorseful. "I shouldn't have been jealous. I was wrong."

Olivia's hand froze, but she patted Sophie's back, resolving to forgive. "It's okay. It's in the past."

Sophie smiled faintly through her tears, and Olivia noticed her sister's swollen fingers. "What happened to your hand?"

Sophie hesitated, then confessed, "I spilled hot tea on myself. I was trying to hurt you, but I got burned too."

"Oh, Sophie..." Olivia sighed, unsure what to say. She could only shake her head.

"And Olivia... I got jealous because you have Isabella, and I thought I could never compare."

Olivia chuckled despite herself. "Sophie, I don't have Isabella. We're just acting, and you know, sometimes things aren't what they seem."

"I know," Sophie mumbled, blushing slightly. "I just secretly like him."

Olivia shook her head, amused. Sophie was still so young, still figuring out what love really meant.

"Well, if you want to impress him, stick to acting. No more schemes, okay?"

"Okay, Olivia. I'll be good."

Sophie nodded, her voice still thick with emotion. "I punished myself by not treating these injuries. I wanted you to know I'm serious."

"Sophie, you silly girl," Olivia said, exasperated but with a fond smile. "Just promise me you'll come to me next time."

"I will, Olivia."

They hugged again, Sophie's tear-streaked face resting on Olivia's shoulder. For a moment, it felt like they'd turned back time.

"Sophie, you're my sister, and I love you," Olivia whispered, her heart full.

"Olivia, Olivia, Olivia," Sophie repeated, her voice softening, her eyes briefly flashing a knowing gleam.

Olivia, oblivious to Sophie's hidden triumph, simply held her sister close, unaware of the drama yet to unfold.
