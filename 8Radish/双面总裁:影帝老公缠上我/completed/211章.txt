Sophie Cook tried to muster a smile, though it looked more like a grimace. “My sister, Olivia Stewart, would never let anything happen to me. If you put the knife down, I can tell you a way to make a fortune. The money you'll get will be a hundred times what I owe you!”

Blue, the guy threatening her, squinted at Sophie Cook, weighing his options. Eventually, the lure of money won him over, and he lowered the knife. “Spill it!”

Sophie turned her gaze to the phone on the table. There was a high-resolution photo on the screen, taken when she borrowed money. It was standard practice; if she didn’t repay, they’d threaten her with it. But when Blue found out she had even done some adult films, he was furious, demanding immediate repayment.

In panic, Sophie had called Olivia Stewart for help, only managing to say, “I took out a loan, save me,” before Blue smashed her phone. Impatient, Blue had already nicked her neck.

Every slight movement of her neck sent waves of pain through her, sparking an idea in her mind.

Sophie looked at her own photo and sighed, “I was so pretty then, what a great figure!”

Blue waved his knife impatiently, “Cut the crap!”

Sophie turned slowly to him, “Did you know? I look a lot like my sister.”

“What’s that supposed to mean?” Blue was confused.

Sophie continued, “Sure, I’m a nobody now, but my sister is a famous actress. No one’s seen her like this. If you send this photo to her, do you think she'd let you be short on cash?”

Blue’s eyes lit up with greed. “Not a bad idea!”

“My sister’s got a big-money backer. Even if she doesn’t care about me, she won’t risk her own reputation. When I took those photos, I mimicked her on purpose. If you send them out, no one will believe her denial.”

“You're one crafty woman!” Blue twisted Sophie's arm with an evil grin. “Too bad you’re not my type, but your sister, well, I wouldn’t mind a taste of a celebrity.”

As Blue imagined his new scheme, Sophie smiled inwardly, relishing the thought of Olivia Stewart sharing her disgrace.

Blue grabbed the phone and accidentally sent the photo to the internet instead of directly to Olivia Stewart. “Damn! It went online!”

Sophie seemed unfazed by the mishap. “Why not claim it’s an exclusive photo shoot of Olivia Stewart? Set up an account, go viral. You could make thousands a day!”

“How do I do that?” Blue was clueless.

“I’ll do it!” Sophie grabbed the phone, ignoring the pain in her neck. She quickly uploaded the photo, labeling it as Olivia Stewart’s, and posted it online.

Handing the phone back, she lamented, “I had more photos, but you broke my phone!”

“I’ve got more!” Blue was thrilled by the rapid online response. “I’ll upload all of them and those films, labeling them as Olivia Stewart’s, and set it as premium content!”

Sophie cooed sweetly, “Whatever you want, Blue.”

The tension between them evaporated, and they formed an unlikely alliance.

Sophie had outsmarted Blue, turning the tables and dragging Olivia Stewart into the mess. She couldn’t have been more pleased.

A knock interrupted the scene. “Olivia Stewart is here!”

Blue quickly resumed his threatening stance, knife at the ready, and ordered his men to open the door.

As soon as the door cracked open, Olivia Stewart was pulled inside. She struggled, demanding release.

Sophie cried, “Sis…”

Seeing the knife and blood on Sophie’s neck, Olivia Stewart panicked, producing a card. “Let her go! I brought the money!”

Blue eyed her skeptically. “What’s this?”

“It’s a no-limit card. There’s as much money as you need!”

Blue’s interest piqued, but he was cautious. He glanced at Sophie, who tearfully assured him, “It’s more than enough to pay back ten times the loans! Her boyfriend is a big shot. She’s not lying!”

Satisfied, Blue demanded the card.

Olivia Stewart held it out, “I’ll give you the card once Sophie’s safe!”

“Do you think I’m stupid?” Blue pressed the knife harder, “What if you run after I let her go?”

Olivia Stewart, seeing her sister’s wound, stayed calm, “You’re surrounded by your men. If anything happens to her, this card is worthless!”

She threatened to break the card, forcing Blue to relent. He pushed Sophie toward Olivia Stewart, “Take her!”

Olivia threw the card, and Blue snatched it, examining it gleefully. “Is there really that much money in here?”

Sophie softly called, “Blue…”

Impatiently, Blue waved her off, “Yeah, yeah, we’re square!”

Sophie shot him a glare. The real plan was to ruin Olivia Stewart, not just settle debts!

But Blue was lost in his dreams of wealth, oblivious to Sophie’s scheme.

Olivia Stewart warned him, “You better cash out fast before the account gets frozen. Once that happens, you’ll get nothing!”

Panicking, Blue ordered his men to leave quickly.

What a fool!

Sophie seethed inwardly but played her part, collapsing into Olivia Stewart’s arms, sobbing, “Sis…”

Olivia Stewart held her close, soothing her, “It’s okay, it’s over now.”

Truth be told, Olivia was shaken. The tension had drained her strength, and she collapsed to the floor with Sophie.

Olivia had never faced such danger and had only managed by sheer willpower. Sophie, on the other hand, was acting, savoring her sister’s fear.

“We need to bandage your neck,” Olivia said, missing the fleeting triumph in Sophie’s eyes.

Luckily, Olivia had some first-aid skills. Though Sophie’s injury looked bad, it was just a surface cut.

Holding Sophie’s hand, Olivia became serious, “Sophie, you can’t do something like this again. If you’re in trouble, talk to me.”

“Yeah, it was a mistake. I’m sorry for dragging you into this. You can hit me if you want.”

Olivia hugged her, “It’s okay. Just promise to stay out of trouble. We’re all each other has now.”

“Sure.” Sophie lowered her gaze, masking her true feelings.

Yeah, right!

Why should you get the leading roles, the good guys, beauty, fame, money… everything? Olivia Stewart, I’m going to drag you down with me until you have nothing left!

“Stay with me, sis. I’m scared,” Sophie whispered.

“Of course, I’ll be here with you.”

Yeah, stick around, Olivia. I can’t wait to see your face when those photos hit the news!

Sophie smiled through her tears, “You’re the best, sis!”

Outside, Isabella Peterson noticed the bodyguard’s car, confirming Olivia Stewart was indeed at Sophie’s place.

To avoid alerting anyone, Isabella instructed her team to stay discreet. As she approached Sophie’s apartment, she noticed a group of rough-looking men leaving, one of them holding a familiar card in triumph.

Isabella’s brows furrowed. The unlimited card she had given to Olivia Stewart, now in this thug’s hands?
