Ethan King Strikes Back

Picture this: a tall, stylish guy, Ethan King, struts in like he's on a runway. He's the new boyfriend of Olivia Stewart, and he's got everyone's attention, especially Emily Young's. She can't take her eyes off him.

Daniel Johnson, standing next to Emily, tugs her sleeve. "Is this guy a famous model? He walks the walk, but he looks kinda... delicate. Does he model women's clothing?"

Emily gives him a sharp pinch. "It's called style, Daniel. Get with it!"

Daniel shuts up, his eyes darting toward Olivia. She's looking better than ever, and he's kicking himself for not winning her over back in the day.

As Ethan walks over, Emily puts on her best charm offensive, her voice going up a notch. "Ethan King!"

Ethan looks at her coolly. "And you are...?"

Emily tries to remind him she's Olivia's friend, but Ethan interrupts, "Oh, right! Garfield!"

Emily's smile falters, twisting into something awkward. "Ethan, you jokester."

"Who's joking?" Ethan smirks. "Doesn't it fit?"

Emily's face twitches, straining to keep her smile. "Sure, sure."

Ethan brushes past her to Olivia. "Let's get you out of here, Olivia."

He came just in time. If he hadn't, Olivia would have been stuck dealing with Daniel and Emily's nonsense again.

"Wait, Ethan!" Emily grabs his sleeve in desperation.

Ethan yanks it away. "What do you want?"

Blushing, Emily stammers. "I own a clothing store and would love for you to be our spokesperson."

Ethan laughs, a mix of disbelief and contempt. "Do you even know who I am? You can't afford me."

Emily, misinterpreting his gaze, blushes harder. "I can try..."

Ethan's eyes land on her pregnant belly. "You don't think I'm interested in you, do you? Sorry, but I'm not into pregnant Garfields."

Turning to Daniel, Ethan adds, "Good luck with the kid. A paternity test might be a good idea."

Olivia chuckles. Who knew Ethan could be so sharp-tongued?

"Olivia!" Daniel and Emily turn to her, desperate.

Olivia smiles sweetly, "Come on, Emily and I were once friends. Letâ€™s not be harsh."

Relieved, they nod, hopeful.

"And Emily," Olivia continues, "you did me a favor by taking Daniel off my hands. Shouldn't I be grateful?"

Their faces freeze.

"Ethan," Olivia teases, "you've got options. If Emily's not your type, there's always our neighbor's oversized dog..."

Ethan gives Olivia a thumbs-up. "Olivia, you're the queen of comebacks!"

"Olivia, I'll tear you apart!" Emily shrieks, lunging at her.

Ethan steps in protectively. "Emily, you wouldn't want us to think the baby isn't Daniel's now, would you?"

Emily stops, torn between anger and fear of confirming Ethan's implication.

Daniel, furious, growls, "Olivia, must you ruin everything?"

"Daniel," Olivia replies, "you of all people should stay out of this."

Daniel pulls out a photo, shoving it at Ethan. "See, Olivia isn't as innocent as she looks!"

Ethan snatches it, glancing at the picture. "This is me."

Daniel's eyes widen. The guy in the photo is different, but Ethan plays it cool.

Ethan tears the photo to shreds. "Spying on us? I've got rights, you know!"

Daniel's stunned. He didn't expect this level of loyalty from Ethan.

Frustrated, Daniel turns to Olivia. But she gazes at him like he's trash. Not worth her time, she turns away.

"Olivia!" Daniel yells after her. "You're not so pure yourself!"

"Smack!" Olivia spins back, slapping him hard.

"Smack!" Another slap follows.

Dazed, Daniel stumbles, his face stinging.

Olivia's hand throbs, but she doesn't care. Her anger blazes as she glares at Daniel.

Daniel, humiliated, lunges at her, but Ethan blocks him. The two scuffle.

Emily charges at Olivia, but Olivia warns, "You're pregnant. Back off."

Emily hesitates.

Olivia escapes to the elevator, tears slipping down her cheek. Daniel's words echo painfully in her mind.

As the elevator reaches the sixth floor, Olivia composes herself, ready for work.

Meanwhile, Ethan and Daniel have been separated by security and escorted out.

Downstairs, Ethan calls up. "Olivia, are you okay? Want me to come up?"

"No need, I'm fine. Heading to work now."

Olivia hangs up, forcing a smile. Why waste tears on someone like Daniel?

At the gym, Olivia's boss is in full rant mode. "Late again, Olivia? Do you even want this job? And what are you wearing?"

Head down, Olivia stays silent. It's all because of Isabella, she thinks.

The boss is relentless, but just then, a coworker interrupts. "There's a VIP, Olivia. They need you."

The boss huffs, glaring at Olivia. "Change and get to work!"

Once the boss leaves, her coworker nudges Olivia. "You okay?"

Olivia smiles. "Thanks for the save."

"Half the truth," her coworker laughs. "We really do have a VIP. And your outfit..."

Olivia looks down. "It's not ideal."

"Just deliver the tea. The boss won't scold you in front of guests!"

Olivia prepares the tray and heads to the gym's main area. As she steps in, she sees...
