The Grand Gala

The entrance to the grand ballroom was a burst of colors with flowers everywhere. A group of girls in bright red dresses surrounded a teenager in a white suit. He looked about seventeen or eighteen, and had a decent face, grinning with a flair that screamed confidence and mischief.

Even though he was dressed in a white suit, he managed to pull off a hip-hop vibe with his moves. His name was Oliver Phillips, and music was his passion. Olivia Stewart, a fellow music enthusiast, couldn't help but nod along to the beat, smiling softly, "This guy's quite the charming idiot!"

"Absolutely! Oliver's famous for his music skills. You two would hit it off for sure. Let's go meet him," said Mia White, eagerly pulling Olivia's arm.

Olivia deftly sidestepped, deciding to make her own way forward.

"Hey, young master, your new sister's here!" whispered one of the girls in red to Oliver Phillips.

A mischievous glint crossed Oliver's face. He struck a cool pose, upside-down, and instructed, "Jojo, get ready to welcome her!"

Jojo gave a signal, and all the girls in red flocked around Olivia, surrounding her with a chorus of, "Welcome home, sis!"

With a loud pop, colorful streamers shot into the air, showering Olivia in a cascade of confetti, like a blooming firework.

"Ahhh—"

A sudden scream sliced through the festive atmosphere. The guests all turned to see what the commotion was about. Amidst the falling streamers and confetti, something else was descending—an avalanche of creepy crawlies.

The crowd collectively gasped, their faces a mix of horror and disdain. Oliver's antics were legendary, and his reputation was spot on!

Mr. White, Oliver's father, stormed over, his face pale with fury. He slapped Oliver hard across the face, "You little rascal!"

Oliver clutched his cheek, tears welling up, but he refused to back down. "I can't stand that woman! Her mother was just a lowly maid who stole your affection from my mother! And now she wants to take away our inheritance. Why should she?"

Mr. White slapped him again, his lips quivering, "Who taught you to say such things?!"

Oliver glanced nervously at Grace Martin, remaining silent.

Grace Martin's heart sank, but with all the guests watching, she had to keep her composure. "Mr. White, he's still your son. Please, don't humiliate him in front of everyone."

"Hmph!" Mr. White huffed, glaring at Grace, "We'll settle this later!"

Just then, he remembered Olivia and quickly turned around, ordering the staff to clear away the mess. To everyone's surprise, the person under the tangled streamers and bugs was Mia White, not Olivia.

"Whoa—"

A scream erupted from the crowd as they took a step back in shock.

Mr. White was taken aback, relieved it wasn't Olivia, but at the same time, worried about facing Isabella Peterson if something had happened to Olivia.

Grace Martin rushed over to help her daughter, brushing off the caterpillars. Unfortunately, the more she brushed, the more Mia's face swelled with blistering welts.

"Get off!" Mia rasped out, her voice hoarse, glaring daggers at Oliver. She looked like she wanted to skin him alive.

Oliver was equally stunned by Mia's grotesque appearance, mumbling, "Didn't you ask me to prepare a special gift for her? This...this is what you wanted, right?"

"She's enjoying it, isn't she?" A clear, melodious voice rang out from behind Oliver.

He turned to see Olivia Stewart, looking as ethereal as moonlight, and his eyes widened.

Wow, she's stunning!

Oliver quickly put on a charming smile, "You're my new sister?"

Olivia's expression turned icy, "If you can do this to your own sister, there's no way I'm acknowledging you as my brother!"

"Smack!" Oliver slapped himself, muttering, "My bad, my bad! Let me make it up to you. Everyone knows I love beauties. If I knew you were this pretty, I'd never have pulled such a stunt."

"Idiot!" Mia shouted hoarsely, rushing towards Oliver.

Oliver dodged, and the ballroom descended into chaos.

"Enough! Get them out of here! They've embarrassed us enough!" Mr. White's roar echoed, and the security quickly escorted Oliver out, while Grace took Mia to see a doctor.

Despite his worry for both kids, Mr. White knew the welcome party was still a top priority.

He swallowed his frustration and turned to Olivia, "Are you okay?"

Olivia smiled graciously, "Luckily, I dodged just in time!"

She had sensed something was off when the girls surrounded her and swiftly stepped aside, leaving Mia to take the brunt of it—truly a case of poetic justice.

Mr. White thought to himself, why did you have to dodge in a way that left Mia to suffer?

But he couldn't voice this aloud. He put on a contrite expression, "Olivia, it's my fault for not being more thoughtful. Oliver's always been a mischievous kid. When he said he wanted to prepare a welcome ceremony, I thought it was something young folks like you would enjoy. I didn't expect him to be so naughty! I'll make sure to discipline him."

"Yes, he needs a good lesson. Just look at what he did to Mia," Olivia nodded seriously, though inwardly she chuckled.

Mr. White was indeed protective of his own!

If Oliver were a toddler, he might be forgiven for being playful. But at seventeen or eighteen, his actions were just plain malicious!

Since it was Mia who got hurt, let the siblings sort it out themselves!

Olivia kept her smile bright, leaving Mr. White at a loss for words.

He had hoped Olivia would graciously forgive Oliver, giving him an easy way out of this awkward situation.

But as he reached out for the olive branch, Olivia showed no intention of taking it.

Mr. White awkwardly smiled, "Let's not let that rascal ruin your evening. Today is your welcome party, after all."

Olivia nodded, her smile serene.

Oliver's antics hadn't soured her mood at all. In fact, seeing Mia's face all puffed up had actually lifted her spirits!

The staff swiftly cleaned up Oliver's mess, and the girls in red had vanished the moment Oliver was slapped. The ballroom quieted down once more.

The guests hadn't left despite the earlier drama. They stayed, eager to see how things would unfold.

"Olivia, shall we? I want to introduce you to everyone properly," Mr. White said, his tone gentle.

He offered his arm to Olivia, inviting her to take it.

Olivia hesitated, then asked with a worried frown, "Today's gift was caterpillars. What's next, snakes? I can't always count on being lucky enough to dodge them!"

Mr. White's face turned pale, then flushed red with embarrassment, "No, I promise you that won't happen!"

He decided to make his declaration right there instead of on the stage. Taking the microphone, he addressed the guests, "Thank you all for joining us for my daughter Olivia's welcome party! I'm sure you're all familiar with her latest movie! I'm grateful to have such an outstanding daughter!"

"And here, I make a solemn promise to Olivia, witnessed by all of you! Now that Olivia has returned to the White family, I will treat her equally with my other two children. And furthermore!"

Mr. White paused, then continued, "To make up for the hardships she's endured, I will transfer fifty percent of the White family's shares to Olivia!"

The room erupted in applause!

Regardless of how flowery Mr. White's words might be, this was a concrete gesture!

"She's just an illegitimate child, and he gives her fifty percent? Has Mr. White lost his mind?"

"I bet there's more to this. You know Mr. White, the sly old fox. He'd never make a losing deal."

The guests buzzed with chatter, their gazes on Mr. White and Olivia filled with various emotions.

Especially the women in the crowd—they looked at Olivia with envy and resentment, as if they wanted to carve out a piece of her.

This was yet another case of "the other woman" winning, and her daughter taking half the family wealth!

Olivia stood there gracefully, unfazed by the whispers around her. Since Mr. White was so sincere, she saw no reason to refuse.

Honestly, she had no idea how much the White family was worth, nor did she care. But if it made Grace Martin and Mia seethe, she was more than happy to accept.

As the hall buzzed with excitement, the butler announced in a loud voice, "Isabella Peterson has arrived—"

Isabella Peterson!

The guests immediately fell silent, turning to the entrance and exchanging knowing glances.

Everyone was reminded of the rumors about Olivia and Isabella, sharing secretive smiles.

Olivia's heart raced at the mention of "Isabella Peterson," her eyes instinctively drawn to the entrance—
