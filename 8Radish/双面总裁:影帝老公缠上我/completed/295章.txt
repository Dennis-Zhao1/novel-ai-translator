chapter: The Proposal at the Launch Event

---

"Olivia Stewart, will you marry me?"

Olivia rolled her eyes, amused but a bit exasperated. "Sure, you're the boss. Did you kick all the media out?"

"They're all over at the Golden Theater," Isabella Peterson replied nonchalantly. "The crew here are mostly team members who can test the game first. The rest are here to serve you!"

"Oh!" Olivia realized, "Shouldn't you be over there hosting the launch? What are you doing here?"

Isabella popped a straw into Olivia's mouth. "We'll start when you're done eating. There's a holographic feed over there; no need to go in person."

So... all those moments of her chomping down food were broadcasted already?

Olivia's eyes widened in shock, a gulp of juice getting stuck in her throat, causing her to cough violently.

"Cough, cough, cough..."

Isabella quickly patted her back, gently scolding, "What's the rush? No one's going to steal it from you!"

Once Olivia caught her breath, she waved him off, annoyed. "Stop talking to me!"

Isabella obediently zipped it.

The crowd was secretly amazed. Who would've thought the cool and collected CEO was actually totally whipped?

Instead of lowering Isabella's image, this only made the women present swoon even more. It was pure, unadulterated PDA—feeding everyone a big bowl of love soup!

Under such scrutiny, Olivia couldn't eat another bite. She smiled at the nearby staff member, "Can you take these away?"

The staff member glanced at Isabella, who nodded, and quickly cleared the table.

Soon, another staff member placed a laptop in front of Olivia.

Looking at the computer, Olivia asked, "What's this for?"

"To play the game!"

Before Olivia could process, Isabella guided her hand to click on the screen, revealing a beautiful image—an animated scene of a memorable kiss shared between them.

Not the fictional hero, but Isabella himself!

Olivia felt her cheeks heat up, but she had to admit the scene was beautifully crafted.

"Isabella..."

She turned to find Isabella leaning over, their foreheads briefly touching as he smiled down at her. In the distance, the large screen captured this moment, mirroring the game’s romantic aesthetic.

Her face flushed, Olivia rubbed her forehead where Isabella had kissed it. "Did you do that on purpose?"

Isabella wrapped his arms around her waist from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder. "Not on purpose, we just have great chemistry."

Olivia was about to retort but was drawn back to the screen.

In the center of this enchanting scene, words blossomed like flowers: "Falling for You."

Olivia's eyes sparkled. "Is this game called 'Falling for You'?"

Isabella casually lifted an eyebrow, "Yep! Named after your song. You won't sue me for copyright, will you?"

Olivia burst into laughter. "I never pegged you as the humorous type, Isabella!"

Isabella's lips curled into a silent smile as he guided her hand to start the game. Inside, you could follow the storyline, choose different scenes, or even create your own...

Olivia was dazzled and couldn't help but exclaim, "Wow! I love this beautiful art style! Did your team design this? It's amazing!"

Isabella playfully tapped her forehead. "You should say our team, silly!"

Olivia pouted, covering her forehead, but her heart was sweet as honey.

Isabella swung the mouse around with her hand. "Which one do you want to play?"

Olivia's eyes scanned the options twice, murmuring, "They all look great. It's hard to choose! Why don't you pick one?"

Isabella quickly slid the mouse to the wedding scene.

Olivia thought it was perfect—she had kids but hadn't had a wedding yet. It would be fun to experience it in the game. But Isabella swiftly clicked on the sub-menu: Honeymoon Suite!

Startled, Olivia quickly shut it down, whispering furiously, "Isabella, what are you doing? In front of everyone, you..."

Seriously, could it get any more inappropriate?

Isabella glanced at her. "You think I'd show something R-rated here?"

"…"

"If I did, it’d be for private viewing only!"

Olivia was flustered and speechless. "What's in there?"

She didn't want everyone to see something private, not even in her wildest thoughts!

"To be developed!" Isabella casually uttered.

Olivia let out a sigh of relief. Of course, Isabella wasn't that tactless!

But then Isabella added slowly, "The public version doesn't have it, but I made a special one just for us."

A bead of sweat dripped from Olivia's forehead. She couldn't imagine playing such a game with Isabella later... Isabella, are you sure this won't corrupt Coco and Gogo?

To hide her embarrassment, Olivia quickly clicked on a honeymoon trip. A map with famous global tourist spots unfurled before her, and she eagerly started choosing. Isabella, meanwhile, took note of every place she picked.

After playing for a while, Olivia had to admit the design was stunning. Though tempted to keep playing, she reminded herself this was the game's launch event, and her playing was just the beginning.

After visiting a couple of locations, she put down the mouse. "That's enough for now. Let's move on to the next part!"

"Okay!" Isabella replied earnestly. "We can continue the honeymoon suite when we get home!"

Olivia shot him a hard look. This guy was always up to no good.

Isabella pulled Olivia up, facing the large holographic screen, announcing the official launch of the "Send an Angel to Love You" game.

The room erupted in applause.

Olivia clapped enthusiastically as well.

She was genuinely proud of the man beside her, sharing in his joy of success.

However, Olivia soon realized Isabella's joy wasn't just from a successful launch but also from...

"I have one more important announcement. The rights to this game belong to my woman—Olivia Stewart!"

"What? Belongs to me?" Olivia was shocked.

Creating and operating a game was no small feat, and the incoming profits, given the game's anticipated success, would be massive!

Isabella was incredibly generous.

Isabella watched Olivia's stunned expression with satisfaction, continuing, "Because this game was developed as a proposal gift to my woman!"

Whoa—

The crowd was buzzing.

Such an extravagant proposal gift was a dream come true!

Olivia was speechless, her mouth agape.

This game, made personally by Isabella? That's incredible!

And did he just say... proposal gift?

Before Olivia could fully react, Isabella took her hand, knelt on one knee, and like magic, produced a ring from his pocket, holding it out to Olivia. "Olivia Stewart, will you marry me?"

"I, I..."

Olivia was flustered, her hand automatically reaching out to Isabella.

Isabella carefully placed the ring on her finger.

The applause was deafening!

Isabella stood up, holding Olivia's ring-clad hand in his, mischievously raising an eyebrow. "Whether you agree or not, you can't escape now!"

Olivia blurted out, "Who says I don't agree?"

Her words amplified through the microphone, causing everyone to burst into laughter.

Embarrassed, Olivia buried herself in Isabella's chest, playfully punching him. "You're terrible! So bad!"

After letting her vent, Isabella gently wrapped her in his arms, resting his chin on her head. "From now on, you just need to prepare to be a beautiful bride!"

"No, I need to lose weight!" Olivia declared with dramatic fervor.

"If I can't lose weight, I won't marry you!"

Isabella was instantly speechless.

After finally getting her to gain a couple of pounds, now she wanted to lose them again?

But then again, what woman doesn't want to look stunning in her wedding dress? He'd let her have her way!

The rest of the event involved game trials, the launch, and a press Q&A. Having accomplished his major life goal, Isabella happily whisked Olivia away.

He hadn't forgotten that Olivia had just recently recovered and needed plenty of rest!

Back at their place, everyone congratulated Olivia. Whether it was the head butler's orders or their own initiative, they all addressed her as the young mistress.

Olivia was so embarrassed she wanted to disappear, while Isabella joyfully announced, "Everyone's getting a double paycheck!"

The staff was thrilled, showering them with thanks, their words as sweet as honey.

Seeing Isabella's delighted expression, Olivia quickly stopped him, "Are you planning to give them another raise?"

Isn't that a bit too generous?
