Title: The Return of Uncle Goldfinger

At the most prestigious school in the bustling city of Goldton, three children stood out, though not in the way one might expect. The twins were in kindergarten, while their older sibling, Tong, was already a second grader. Despite their impressive family background—Isabella Peterson being a mover and shaker in Goldton and Olivia Stewart a legendary actress—their kids kept a low profile.

Every day, a simple black car picked them up, with just two bodyguards and a housekeeper. Olivia insisted, "They're here to learn, not to be little lords and ladies!" So, unlike other kids who had grand entourages, the twins and Tong enjoyed the freedom and joy of being just like any other kids.

The twins had spent their early years on a ranch with Olivia, growing up wild and free under the open skies, much like their mother. Tong, on the other hand, had known loneliness in an orphanage before finding himself in this new life of privilege. Yet, Olivia’s advice to "study hard, stay humble, and keep your background to yourself" often left him feeling conflicted.

Tong was especially aware of his not-so-glamorous past. He couldn't just casually mention Isabella Peterson wasn't his real dad or that he was Olivia's stepson. He'd seen other kids mocked for less. The flashy arrivals of his classmates in luxury cars only added salt to the wound, especially the disdainful looks at his simple attire.

After school one day, Tong walked alone, kicking a stone as he made his way to where the twins waited. His school and theirs were separated by a large garden and a long tree-lined path—a daily trek he had gotten used to.

At eight years old, a bit of walking wasn't much of a task, but it reminded him of Olivia's supposed favoritism for the twins, who were much younger. Tong often convinced himself it was because Olivia loved them more since he wasn't Isabella's biological child. The thought of Olivia marrying Isabella made him inexplicably sad and angry.

As if to vent these feelings, he kicked the stone hard. It flew away with a whistle but bounced back, hitting his knee. "Ouch!" he winced, looking up to see a tall man standing a few steps away.

The man, with a wide-brimmed hat and large sunglasses, obscured most of his face—only a pale cheek and a chilling smile showed. Tong's instincts screamed danger, a remnant of his childhood experiences. The stranger's smile was cold, like a winter breeze, or a lurking snake ready to strike.

Tong took a couple of steps back, his heart pounding. The man approached, his voice surprisingly gentle, "Is your Aunt Olivia getting married?" Tong nodded, lips pressed into a thin line.

"Do you want to ruin the wedding? So your Aunt Olivia stays just your aunt, not Isabella's wife?" the stranger continued, his voice tempting.

Tong hesitated, then shook his head vigorously. He didn't like Isabella, sure, but he was just a kid. What could he do?

Sensing Tong’s turmoil, the man leaned in closer, whispering, "I can stop the wedding. Want to hear how?"

The coldness of his breath made Tong recoil, recognizing the voice from his nightmares. His eyes darted to the man's right hand, confirming his fear—there it was, the golden glint from his sleeve.

Uncle Goldfinger! The man who had tormented him in the past!

Frozen with fear, Tong's face turned pale, sweat beading on his forehead. He wanted to run but found himself rooted to the spot.

Seeing Tong's terror, the man took off his sunglasses, revealing himself as Alexander Peterson, missing for years. "Hey, kiddo, remember me?" he asked with a chilling smile.

Tong could only stare, speechless and terrified.

"Olivia's getting married. You must be upset," Alexander cooed, gently ruffling Tong’s hair. His touch felt like a snake slithering over him.

When Tong stayed silent, Alexander pressed harder, "You’re upset, right?" The pressure on Tong’s head increased, pain shooting through his temples.

Finally, Tong nodded, voice trembling, "Yes."

Satisfied, Alexander released him, "Good. Let me help you."

Tong nodded quickly. He had no choice; refusing could mean facing Alexander’s wrath.

"Good boy," Alexander said, patting Tong's head again. "Let’s make sure Olivia stays just yours, okay?"

Tong nodded, clutching the toy plane Alexander handed him. "I’ll do it."

Alexander’s smile broadened, "Off you go, then. Don’t keep them waiting!"

Tong hurried away, heart pounding, reaching the kindergarten where the housekeeper was just collecting the twins.

"Why are you so sweaty, Tong?" the housekeeper asked, surprised.

Tong wiped his forehead, avoiding eye contact, "I was doing homework and lost track of time, so I ran over."

"Don’t worry, we’d have waited!" one of the twins, Gogo, chided, taking Tong’s hand.

Tong looked at Gogo's innocent face and turned away, uneasy with the secret he now had to keep.
