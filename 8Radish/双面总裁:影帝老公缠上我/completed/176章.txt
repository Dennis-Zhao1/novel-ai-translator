On a bustling city street, Lisa watched Ethan King walk away, her sharp nails digging into her palms. Her carefully lined eyes, adorned with layers of false lashes, screamed three big words: "I can't believe this!"

Once upon a time, Ethan was the one who admired Lisa with a feverish intensity. She had always thought he would be her fallback guy, the one waiting whenever she decided to turn back. But now, with surprising swiftness, he had cut ties with her. She stood there, stunned, watching his figure grow smaller in the distance. The man she'd once dismissed as too effeminate now exuded a kind of commanding presence reminiscent of Andrew Young.

A new kind of pain spread through her chest. Lisa had a gut feeling that if she lost Ethan King this time, it would be forever. She shut her eyes, took a deep breath, and darted after him.

The bar was in the heart of the city, and even though it was late, the streets were still alive with traffic. Lisa spotted Ethan across the street and instinctively ran after him, calling out, "Ethan, wait up! I need to talk to you!"

Just then, a red car screeched to a halt right in front of her, stopping mere inches from her knees. The driver, Emily Young, poked her head out and barked, "Hey! You trying to get yourself killed? Get out of my way!"

Emily was already fuming and Lisa was just the unlucky soul caught in her crosshairs. "I...I..." Lisa stammered, looking around and realizing Ethan was nowhere to be seen. Frustrated, she turned her anger towards Emily. "You nearly ruined my chance to catch him! You're going to pay for my loss!"

Emily, who hated being called out for her weight, struggled out of the car, ready for a showdown. Lisa, seeing Emily's size, was taken aback—Emily was not just big, but pregnant!

The scene caused a traffic jam, with drivers impatiently honking their horns. Realizing someone was filming the whole thing, Lisa quickly adjusted her sunglasses and slipped away. Emily, unable to chase her due to her size and her car still in the street, shouted after her, "You think you can just run away? Come back and face me!"

"Let it go, the driver's voice from the car urged, sounding exhausted. The honking from behind grew more insistent.

Emily, with great effort, got back into her car and started the engine, still grumbling, "Marrying you was the worst decision of my life! If it weren't for the baby, I'd leave you stranded in the middle of nowhere!"

In the back seat, Daniel Johnson sat, his two broken legs causing him immense pain, but Emily's outburst silenced his complaints. He was counting on her to get him to the hospital.

Emily, worried about Daniel straying, kept a tight leash on him, even going so far as to track his phone. It was the only reason Daniel was still alive. That night, when he didn't come home, Emily checked his location and found him far out of town. What was he doing in the middle of nowhere at such an hour?

Emily's mind went straight to the worst-case scenario: Daniel must have taken his secret lover to the countryside for some illicit fun! Furious, she drove out, ignoring the bumpy roads and the fact that she was nearing her due date.

When she arrived, she found Daniel barely conscious. Despite her anger, she couldn't leave him there. After splashing him awake with a bottle of water, she managed to haul him into the car with great difficulty.

Daniel was rushed to the hospital, where he underwent hours of surgery. Though his life was saved, his legs were severely damaged, with a long and painful recovery ahead. If things went wrong, he might spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair.

Hearing this, Emily's first thought was, "I want a divorce!"

The doctor, sympathetic but firm, advised, "Ma'am, he's still your husband and the father of your child. You might want to reconsider until he's stable. He has multiple injuries and needs careful attention to heal properly."

"No way!" Emily retorted, more furious than ever. "I have no one to take care of me, and now I’m supposed to look after him? What good is a cripple? I want a divorce right now! Is he awake? Let me in!"

The doctor stopped her, sighing, "He needs to be in intensive care for 48 hours. You can discuss it when he's transferred to a regular room."

"Fine, I'll prepare the paperwork! Our clothing company and the house were bought with my family's money. He won't get a dime!" Emily stormed out without a backward glance at Daniel.

Daniel never imagined that his betrayal for a chance at a better life in this city would lead to such a downfall. Karma, as they say, catches up with everyone.

Meanwhile, Olivia Stewart's life was on an upswing. After resolving past tensions with Isabella Peterson, their relationship blossomed like a couple on their honeymoon. Isabella's mischievousness was matched by her affection.

In the film set, Olivia’s mood had transformed her performance. She was effortlessly slipping into her character, White Yi Ke, and her scenes with Tian Yi were becoming more seamless. Especially the intimate ones, which were enhanced by the lack of gum-chewing and the presence of Isabella's familiar scent.

During one break, Olivia playfully asked Tian Yi, "You used to chew gum all the time. Why'd you stop?"

Tian Yi gave her a meaningful smile, "I was worried you'd think I had bad breath."

"You never did! Actually, I liked how your breath smelled," Olivia blurted out, before realizing what she’d just admitted. Her face flushed with embarrassment, turning bright red.

"I mean, I like it just as it is now," she quickly added, hiding her face in her knees.

Tian Yi chuckled, watching her hide like a shy little mouse. His charming grin was enough to make anyone's heart skip a beat. The crew couldn't help but notice the chemistry between the two, debating whether it was just great acting or something more.

Back on set, Ethan King watched from a distance. He had come to terms with his feelings but didn't want to disrupt Olivia’s happiness.

When rumors about Olivia spread online, his initial instinct was to rush to her side, like he always had. But upon arriving at her place, he found he couldn’t even get through the door. When he called her, Olivia was blissfully unaware of the gossip. Realizing she was well-protected, Ethan knew she had found someone who could care for her even better than he could.

At the film set, while Ethan struggled with the reporters, Tian Yi easily dispersed them with a few commanding words. Once again, Olivia was surrounded by people who truly cared for her.

As her best friend, Ethan was happy for Olivia, but he couldn’t help feeling a bit left out. This city wasn’t his domain, and he felt powerless to do anything for her.
