Olivia Stewart: Don’t Make a Sound

"Whoa, man! Take it easy!" Lucas Wright shouted, his voice trembling as he watched Isabella Peterson with fear in his eyes. He was about ready to grab the steering wheel himself.

The car was getting closer, dangerously closer...

Isabella suddenly eased off the gas, flicking the steering wheel to the side with a practiced hand. At the same time, Ethan King skillfully maneuvered his bike, dodging the car with a swift arc.

On the bike, Olivia Stewart clung to Ethan's waist, her head pressed against his back, eyes squeezed shut, and mouth open in a scream.

"Bang!" Isabella punched the steering wheel in frustration.

Seeing Olivia and Ethan so close together made him want to run them over. But in the end, he couldn't bring himself to do it.

Isabella had confidence in his driving skills. He just wanted to give them a little scare, disrupt their romantic moment. But Ethan turned out to be quite the driver too, dodging Isabella's move and showing off his skills.

Olivia, on the other hand, was scared out of her wits and ended up clutching Ethan even tighter. Isabella's plan to break them apart backfired, making them even closer. How infuriating!

Lucas, ever the commentator, added fuel to the fire. "Sir, you're practically pushing Olivia into another man's arms!"

"Shut up!" Isabella snapped. This old man was getting on his nerves today. He'd deal with Lucas later.

With a dark expression, Isabella sped his car past Ethan's bike, the wind carrying Olivia's freaked-out voice, "Geez! That was a road maniac! Next time, I'm sticking to four wheels; two are just too risky!"

Isabella's black sedan whooshed by, engine roaring as it sped off for miles, still not satisfied. This car was too weak for his liking!

He glared at Lucas in the rearview mirror. "Get out! Find your own way back," he ordered, stopping at a random intersection.

Lucas glanced outside. It was the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere. Was it really okay to leave an old man like him stranded?

"Sir..."

"I don't want to repeat myself."

"Yes, sir." Resigned, Lucas reached for the door. At least Isabella hadn't punished him more severely for today's mess-up.

Just then, Lucas's phone rang. Seeing the caller's name, he brightened up and handed it to Isabella. "Sir, it's from Michael Wright!"

Isabella took the phone coolly. "So, they found out about the guy's background? He's in the capital? Good, let them know right away."

After hanging up, Isabella tossed the phone back to Lucas and sped off again.

Relieved he wasn't kicked out, Lucas took a deep breath. He stole a glance at Isabella, whose mood seemed to be lifting. Solving a rival issue must have felt good.

Instead of speeding around the outskirts, Isabella drove back home, even turning on the car's music system with a spring in his step. The songs playing were ones Olivia had sung at the subway entrance.

When did he secretly record them? The music, now clearer and purer thanks to Isabella's tech-savvy audio system, filled the car with Olivia's ethereal voice.

Lucas couldn't help but praise, "Olivia's voice is amazing! Sir, should we send a talent scout to sign her up?"

Isabella tapped his fingers to the beat and replied, "No need for now." He had a bigger surprise planned for her.

Seeing Isabella in a better mood, Lucas hesitated but knew he had to speak up. "Sir," he began reluctantly, "those people after Mr. Gu—are they enemies? If Olivia ever finds out you tipped them off, won't she hate you?"

"Relax, they're not enemies, they're family."

"Family?" Lucas was confused but knew better than to press further when Isabella clearly didn't want to discuss it.

Back at the mansion, two maids stood at the entrance, waiting nervously. Seeing Isabella, they quickly bowed their heads. "Good evening, sir!"

Isabella frowned. "Why are you two up so late?"

They exchanged puzzled looks. One spoke up, "Sir, we're here to say goodbye."

"Goodbye?" Isabella suddenly remembered overhearing their gossip on the stairs earlier and had told them to get lost.

"Go back to your duties," he ordered.

The maids were baffled but quickly thanked him profusely. Working here was a rare opportunity, after all—a cushy, well-paid job that even office workers in the city envied.

As Isabella walked up the steps, he casually praised, "You, the garden looks great. And you, the floors are spotless."

With that, he left, leaving the two maids in shock. Was he really complimenting them?

They exchanged incredulous looks, almost moved to tears. What had happened to make the young master so cheerful?

They glanced at Lucas, who waved them off. "Go on, get back to work!"

The maids guessed it had something to do with Olivia Stewart.

At Olivia's apartment, she and Ethan arrived around 11 p.m. Emma Thomas greeted them with a yawn, "You're late. I made some snacks in the kitchen."

Olivia grinned and hugged Emma, "You're the best, Emma!"

"What about me, coming to get you so late?" Ethan's voice was plaintive from behind them.

Olivia turned and rolled her eyes, "You want a hug too?"

"Yes!"

Olivia playfully pushed Emma towards Ethan, "There, hug her!"

Ethan's face fell. She wouldn't hug him but pushed him towards another woman instead. What was that about?

Olivia winked mischievously, "Emma made us snacks. You should thank her with a hug too."

Ethan glanced at Emma, whose small eyes were filled with hope, and quickly sidestepped into the kitchen. "You've hugged her enough. I'll get the utensils."

Emma's face fell as Olivia patted her shoulder, "Hang in there, Emma. I'm rooting for you!"

Emma's late-night snacks were simple but tasty, and Olivia and Ethan chatted happily over them. Emma, feeling like a third wheel, quietly retreated to her room.

Watching her go, Olivia nudged Ethan's bowl, "You know she likes you. Being so cold isn't nice."

"What should I do? Give her false hope?"

"Can't you just be friends, like we are?"

Friends... Ethan pondered Olivia's words, not looking too happy, and buried his face in his bowl of porridge.

In the middle of the night, Olivia was deep in sleep when she heard her door creak open. She bolted upright, spotting a tall figure rushing towards her.

"Ah!" she screamed, throwing a pillow. "Isabella Peterson, go to hell!"

"Shh—Olivia, it's me!" The shadow deflected the pillow, revealing Ethan's mischievous face.

"Ethan! What are you doing here? You scared me half to death!"

For a moment, she thought it was Isabella breaking in. How ridiculous!

Olivia clutched her chest, reaching for the lamp.

"Don't turn on the light!" Ethan grabbed her hand.

They were so close, his hurried breath warm on her face. In the dark, something seemed to be heating up.

Olivia panicked, "E-Ethan, what are you doing?"

"Shh—stay still! Don't make a sound!" Ethan whispered, lifting the covers and sliding into bed, pulling them both under.
