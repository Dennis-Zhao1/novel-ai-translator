Olivia Stewart had no idea how she ended up on that secluded path, almost like she was under a spell. It wasn't until she was sitting by the edge of the field that she realized what she had done. Looking down at the familiar yellow dirt, Olivia's playful side kicked in, and she crafted a lumpy little figure resembling Ethan King right there.

But of course, nothing ever goes smoothly when you're trying to sneak in some mischief. Before she knew it, Ethan King had caught her red-handed, literally tumbling into the mud because of her.

Talk about a sticky situation! Olivia knew when it was time to bail—like, right now. She had plans to catch up with her old friend, and this was the perfect excuse to bolt.

As she glanced back down the path, she saw Amy Green sprinting up, looking like he was on a mission. Olivia quickly ducked into a nearby restroom, giving herself a moment to breathe. Inside, she washed the remaining dirt off her hands and stared at her reflection, regretting how swollen her lip looked. How on earth would she explain this to Isabella Peterson later?

Putting that worry aside for now, Olivia decided it was time to confront her friend who had gone AWOL for months. As she stepped out, she almost immediately ran into a roadblock—a wheelchair, to be precise.

Lisa was there, looking up at Olivia with an expression that could curdle milk. They were alone, so Lisa had no need for her usual polite façade.

"So, what's your deal with Andrew Young?" Lisa asked, cutting straight to the chase.

Olivia was momentarily taken aback, but then she remembered the scene where Lisa had rushed to Ethan's aid after he got punched. A lightbulb went off in her head. Who would've guessed that Ethan, with his chaotic appeal, had history with the top-ranking starlet Lisa?

This was going to be fun.

Leaning against the sink, Olivia crossed her arms and smiled, teasing, "Why don't you take a guess?"

Lisa's face turned all kinds of colors, none of them flattering. After a moment of silence, she tightened her grip on the wheelchair's arms and spoke in a low, threatening tone, "I don't care what your relationship is with him, but you'd better stay away."

Olivia couldn't help but let out a small, arrogant laugh. "You can't tell me what to do. Maybe you should be more careful on set, Lisa. Next time you might not just end up in a wheelchair."

"You...!" Lisa was livid, her face red with anger. She wanted to get up and slap Olivia but found herself helplessly sitting there, resorting to banging the armrest in frustration.

Olivia had no intention of sticking around for more drama. She walked around Lisa's wheelchair, ready to leave.

"Andrew loves me! He'll always love me!" Lisa shouted desperately at Olivia's retreating back.

Olivia paused, turned back with a fierce glare that could cut through steel, and said, "Where do you get that confidence from?"

Lisa, caught off guard by Olivia's fierce gaze, instinctively rolled back in her chair, clearly unnerved. "W-what do you want?" she stammered.

"Hmph!" Olivia scoffed, shaking her head. "I finally get it. You're the one who broke his heart all those years ago. You turned him away from love, and now you expect him to come crawling back to you?"

Lisa shook her head, eyes wide in denial. "I-I don't know what you're talking about!"

"Don't play dumb with me!" Olivia took a bold step forward, leaning over Lisa. "You might be pretty, but you're a piece of work. I couldn't care less about your past schemes, but from now on, Olivia Stewart is officially your problem!"

With that, Olivia gave a swift kick to Lisa's wheelchair, sending it spinning toward the grassy lawn. The sight of Lisa clinging for dear life as she let out a series of shrill screams was almost comical.

If you mess with my friends, you're messing with me. And I'm not the type to let that slide!

Feeling pretty proud of herself, Olivia sauntered away, leaving Lisa to deal with her predicament.

Meanwhile, Amy Green was dashing down the path with Isabella's change of clothes and gear. He arrived at the field where Ethan stood, looking like a disgruntled superhero who'd been ambushed by a mud monster. His face was smeared with makeup and dirt, and his hair was in such a state that it was hard to keep a straight face.

At least no one else was around to witness this fashion disaster. Otherwise, fans might have had a collective meltdown.

Ethan stood there, fists clenched, his jaw set in a line as sharp as a knife. He'd never been this embarrassed in his life.

"Olivia Stewart, you're going to pay for this," he muttered under his breath.

"Boss, boss! I'm here!" Amy Green called out, struggling under the weight of all the gear as he hurriedly set up a makeshift dressing room.

"Get a move on!" Ethan snapped, clearly not in the mood for delays.

Amy Green nodded vigorously, setting up the temporary wardrobe and handing over a clean set of clothes. Ethan stormed inside, and after a few minutes, emerged looking like the dashing gentleman he usually was—minus the dirt smudges, of course.

"Quickly," Ethan ordered in a low voice, tossing his wig into Amy Green's hands.

"Right away!" Amy Green replied, giving Ethan a quick makeover to erase all traces of the earlier chaos. Within no time, Ethan was back to his usual, brooding self.

Ethan plucked the voice modulator from his throat, tossing it to Amy Green. He was done with the charade for the day—his only goal now was to find Olivia and give her a piece of his mind.

"Hey, boss, you forgot your shoes!" Amy Green called, offering a pair of polished dress shoes.

Ethan slipped them on, his gaze falling on the lumpy mud figure Olivia had left behind. He picked it up, examining it with a curious look.

Amy Green was taken aback. Ethan King, the notorious clean freak, willingly picking up mud?

When he realized it was a little mud sculpture of Ethan, it all made sense. No wonder Ethan had been fixated on it earlier.

But man, Olivia's sculpting skills were... well, let's just say they left a lot to be desired. Yet Ethan seemed to treasure it.

"Inform Lucas Wright to prepare a sunroom in the castle garden. Ship in the world's finest mud for sculpting," Ethan commanded.

Wow, talk about going big!

Amy Green packed up their things and followed Ethan, curiosity getting the better of him. "Boss, are you ever going to tell Olivia Stewart who you really are?"

Ethan paused, casting a cool glance at Amy Green.

Amy Green felt a chill run down his spine, but pressed on. "But, um, it seems Olivia just... left with that other guy."

Ethan stopped dead in his tracks, his voice sharp. "What did you say?"

Amy Green nearly bumped into him, losing his balance and landing face-first in the dirt.

"Ouch!"

By the time Amy Green managed to pick himself up, Ethan was already gone.

Picking up the scattered clothes, Amy Green sighed dramatically. "Boss, you've really done it this time."

You went through all that trouble to get rid of the competition, only to go and create one yourself. You spend every day acting with Olivia, teasing her on and off set.

Now the real competition's back. Let's see how you handle this one!
