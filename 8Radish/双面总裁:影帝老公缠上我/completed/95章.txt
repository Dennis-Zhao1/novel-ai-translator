Director Adams Returns to the Scene

The microphone crackled with Henry Adams' raspy, audacious laughter. "Sweetheart, is there any deal Henry Adams wouldn't dare to make? You must be underestimating your big bro Henry!"

Sophie Cook, ever vigilant, scanned her surroundings while holding the mic, a wicked grin playing on her lips. "Alright then, let's go big this time! How about the lead actress in the new movie? If you can get your hands on her scandalous video, money's no object. Surely, that's better than running around with a bunch of wannabe stars, right?"

"The lead actress? Olivia Stewart?" Henry pondered for a moment, immediately on high alert. "Isn't she your sister? You want me to take her down? Ha! That's quite the bait, Sophie Cook. Growing wings and getting ideas, are we? Let me tell you, I, Henry Adams, didn't get into this game yesterday. Your little tricks won't fool me! Trying to use your sister as bait to gather evidence against me? No way!"

"Please, Henry, don't hang up!" Sophie Cook's voice carried a tinge of urgency. "I'm serious. Please, trust me!"

"You know what happens to those who cross me, Henry Adams. Would you really drag your own sister into this?"

"It was because of her that I ended up on this path, so why not?" Sophie's voice dripped with venom.

Henry cackled, "That's my kind of woman! I like your ruthless nature!"

"Alright, but my sister isn't easily fooled. You'll need to follow my lead on this."

"Sure thing, as long as there's big money involved, I'd even carry your shoes!"

After reaching an agreement, the two met secretly to hammer out the details.

Olivia Stewart, busy catching up on her studies, had little free time. Sophie Cook timed her approach perfectly, linking arms with Olivia. "Sis, finished your schoolwork for the day? How about a shopping trip?"

Olivia hesitated, "But today's lesson on expressing inner monologues with facial expressions—I haven't quite mastered it yet. I wanted to practice more."

"Come on, characters have diverse personalities, and their inner monologues differ too. You can't figure it out locked in a room. You need to hit the streets, observe people's expressions, and then mimic them. Didn't the teacher tell you that?"

Olivia looked at Sophie, unsure. In acting, Olivia lacked confidence, and Sophie seemed to know much more.

Seeing Olivia wavering, Sophie playfully shook her arm, "Please, sis? It's been ages since we went shopping together. Remember the candy trips from when we were kids?"

Memories of childhood flashed before Olivia's eyes. Back then, Sophie was like a joyful butterfly, skipping in the middle while their parents held her hands, one on each side, a picture of a happy family. Olivia, feeling like an outsider, walked silently on the side, envying Sophie.

Sometimes, Olivia wondered if she was even born into this family, often feeling like the odd one out. Once, unable to hold back, she asked, "Can I hold your hand too?"

Her mom turned back, scolding, "Aren't you too old to compete with your sister for attention?"

Olivia hung her head, unable to respond. But Sophie let go of her mom's hand, grabbed Olivia's, and cheerfully said, "I'll hold you, sis!"

Recalling this, Olivia's gaze softened, filled with affection as she patted Sophie's head. "Alright, alright, I'll do whatever you want today. Wait here while I tell Mr. Butler not to send the car."

As Olivia stepped aside to make the call, Sophie watched her with a cold, calculating smile. Olivia Stewart, you're about to fall from grace! Let's see if that charming rich guy still wants you after that!

When Olivia returned, she was startled by the look on Sophie's face. Sophie quickly recovered, flashing a sweet smile. "Sis, you're back! Let's go!"

The warm smile seemed a world apart from the cold, harsh expression moments ago. Olivia blinked, wondering if it was just her imagination. Before she could ponder further, Sophie had already linked arms with her, pulling her along.

Sophie chattered endlessly, and soon Olivia forgot about the earlier oddity. "Sis, you're quite the celebrity now. Getting mobbed for autographs is such a hassle. How about we sneak out the back? There's a little shop selling sunglasses down that alley. Let's buy a pair before we hit the stores."

Olivia tapped Sophie's nose, "You're always thinking ahead. Definitely star material!"

Sophie blushed, hiding her resentment and envy deep inside. "You're the star, sis, acting opposite a renowned actor. I'll need your help in the future!"

"Of course, if there's a chance, I'll figure something out for you!" Olivia comforted Sophie, feeling a surge of emotions. Back then, she worked in a small shop, saving every penny to support Sophie's education and living expenses. Yet, Sophie never acknowledged their relationship publicly, considering it embarrassing. Now, with Olivia playing the lead role, their bond seemed to strengthen. Whatever the reason for Sophie's newfound warmth, it was a good thing.

As they exited through the side door, a middle-aged man with a briefcase hurried towards them, head down, seemingly oblivious. Olivia quickly pulled Sophie aside, but it was too late.

"Bang!" Sophie collided with the man.

"Sophie, are you okay?"

"I'm so sorry! Is the young lady alright?" The man apologized profusely. When he looked up and saw Olivia, his eyes behind the glasses lit up. "Olivia Stewart! What a pleasant surprise to meet you here!"

Olivia frowned at the outstretched hand. "You are…?"

The man withdrew his hand awkwardly, adjusting his glasses. "Oh, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Director Adams from New Horizon Films."

"You're Director Adams from New Horizon Films?" Sophie shrieked like she had discovered a new planet, barely containing her excitement.

"Sis, you don't know, Director Adams is the most famous director domestically and internationally. Every actor he launches becomes a star!"

"Really? I thought the directors from Billion Films were the most renowned?"

"Oh, please, don't listen to their boasting! Sis, you're not familiar with the entertainment industry, so it's easy to be misled. They're just self-promoting; actually, New Horizon Films is bigger and more famous than Billion Films!"

Sophie turned to Henry Adams, practically worshipping him. "Director Adams, it's a pleasure to meet you!"

"Likewise, likewise!"

They exchanged a quick handshake, eyes communicating swiftly.

"Are you Olivia's agent?"

"Oh no, I'm her sister."

"Oh, then we're practically family, no need for formalities. I've got some insider news about the new movie 'Send an Angel to Love You' from Billion Films…"

Director Adams glanced around conspiratorially. "Let's find a place to sit and talk!"

"Sure, sure, lead the way, Director Adams!"

Sophie dragged Olivia along, not forgetting to give her a meaningful look. The implication being, a personal invitation from Director Adams was a golden opportunity not to be missed!

Olivia didn't intend to mingle with entertainment industry figures, but seeing Sophie's eagerness, she couldn't refuse her. Plus, if she could secure an opportunity for Sophie, it would make up for not being able to give her the lead role. Burdened with a sense of guilt, Olivia followed.

After a few steps, Director Adams pointed to a black sedan parked by the roadside, bowing gallantly. "Let's go, ladies, please get in!"

Olivia glanced at the car, offering a polite but distant smile. "No need for such trouble. There's a café up ahead. Why don't we sit there?"

Henry Adams masked his disappointment with a cheerful expression. "Sure, sure, it's an honor to be invited by Olivia Stewart. Wherever you say, we'll go. Besides, what I have to say is quite urgent!"

"What is it?"

"This isn't the place to discuss it. Let's talk when we get there!"

Soon, they arrived at a quiet booth in the café. The server, graceful in her movements, left after serving the coffee, while Henry Adams' gaze lingered on her retreating figure.

"Ahem…" Sophie cleared her throat loudly, pushing a cup of coffee towards Henry with a smile. "Director Adams, have some coffee!"

"Oh, right!" Henry took a large gulp, grimacing. "It's so bitter!"

Sophie discreetly nudged him under the table.

Henry swallowed the coffee with difficulty, his greasy face twisting like a bitter gourd.

Olivia lightly furrowed her brow. Are all artists this eccentric? Why does Director Adams seem so untrustworthy?

Sophie shot Henry a covert look and added, "Director Adams' coffee is usually prepared by his assistant, right? Probably with lots of sugar, no wonder you can't handle the bitter coffee."

"Right, right, I totally forgot!"

After all, he was used to conning people, so his nerves held steady under pressure.
