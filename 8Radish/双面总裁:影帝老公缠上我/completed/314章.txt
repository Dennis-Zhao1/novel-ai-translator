In the outskirts of the fictional city of Goldview, there was a notorious cave system that sprawled across the land like a hidden maze. No one really knew how many tunnels it had or how far they stretched. The ones near the highway had been turned into tourist attractions, while the deeper, more secluded parts remained largely undiscovered.

Alexander Peterson had managed to stay hidden from Isabella Peterson's relentless search by taking refuge in one of these hidden caves. It was the perfect hideout, a secret only he knew.

When little Tommy finally woke up, the dim light of the cave left him disoriented. He turned his head and saw Alexander Peterson, and in a timid voice, he called out, "Uncle Goldfinger, where am I?"

"You're in paradise," Alexander replied with a soft, chilling smile that sent shivers down Tommy's spine.

Tommy couldn't help but shrink back, only to feel the cold, slick surface of the cave wall behind him. Alarmed, he jumped up to get away, but his forehead smacked right into another rocky surface.

Looking around, Tommy realized he was in a cave—a dripping, damp cavern that felt more like an underground labyrinth. Panic set in, and he bolted.

The cave was like a giant, underground maze, with numerous twisting tunnels and paths covered in slippery moss. In his rush, Tommy slipped and fell hard on the ground.

"Ouch!" he cried out, instinctively grabbing for a nearby root to steady himself. But the root broke off in his hand—and started moving! It was a snake!

Tommy let out a blood-curdling scream, tossed the snake away, and fainted.

When he came to again, the cave was as dim and wet as before. He wasn't sure if he was in the same spot, but the familiar, unsettling face of Alexander Peterson was unmistakable.

"Uncle Goldfinger!" Tommy cried, throwing himself into Alexander's arms. "There were so many snakes! I'm scared! Uncle Goldfinger, please help me!"

Alexander had not expected Tommy to leap into his embrace. He was about to push the boy away, but the child's trembling form softened his resolve. He awkwardly patted Tommy's back.

"Just don't wander around, and you won't have to worry about snakes," Alexander said, his voice surprisingly gentle.

"I won't run anymore! I promise!" Tommy sobbed, eventually calming down in Alexander's arms. Feeling a bit embarrassed, he pulled away, wiped his tears, and whispered, "I'm sorry, Uncle Goldfinger."

Alexander's smile was as enigmatic as ever. "Having a child around isn't so bad. It's just a pity I'll never have my own. Imagine if Olivia Stewart and I had a kid—what a looker that kid would be!"

Tommy's eyes widened in shock. He wasn't sure if this Olivia Stewart was his beloved Aunt Olivia, but given Alexander's unpredictable nature, he didn't dare ask.

"Uncle Goldfinger, can you really help me find my mom and dad?" Tommy asked cautiously.

"Of course! As long as you behave and listen to me." Alexander reached out and patted Tommy's head with his golden hand.

Tommy had first noticed Alexander's golden hand when he had wandered out of the amusement park and followed him. He thought that Alexander, with his golden hand, could grant wishes. And Tommy had one wish: to find his parents.

His parents would surely love him, just like Aunt Olivia and Uncle Isabella loved their twins.

"When can I see my mom and dad?" Tommy asked, his innocent face full of hope.

"Once you answer my questions," Alexander said softly, his cold, metallic hand brushing Tommy's cheek.

Tommy nodded eagerly. "Okay, ask me anything! I'll answer honestly!"

Alexander began his questioning, "Do you call Olivia Stewart your mom?"

"No," Tommy shook his head, puzzled. "I grew up in an orphanage until Aunt Olivia adopted me. I used to call her Sister Olivia, but then she said to call her Aunt Olivia."

"Fool!" Alexander's expression turned dark. "She's your mom! Why do you call her aunt?"

Tommy stared at Alexander's raised hand in fear. "What do you mean?"

Alexander calmed down a bit, giving Tommy a sideways glance. "I mean, she cares for you so much, she might as well be your mom."

The light in Tommy's eyes dimmed. "I wish she could be, but she already has two kids. And Uncle Isabella... I don't think he likes me much."

Of course, he doesn't like you—you're not his son.

Alexander's smile was inscrutable. "Did Isabella ever do a DNA test on you?"

Tommy shook his head. "I don't understand."

"Idiot!" Alexander snapped, shoving Tommy away.

Tommy hit his head against the cave wall but didn't dare cry out in pain. This Uncle Goldfinger was terrifying, like a snake—cold and unpredictable.

"Stop shaking! Stand up and talk to me properly!" Alexander barked, pulling Tommy up and fixing him with a chilling gaze.

"Tell me everything you saw between Isabella and Olivia Stewart."

"I...I..." Tommy was on the verge of tears, too scared to speak.

Under Alexander's intimidating glare, Tommy stammered out, "I just saw them fighting!"

"Fighting?" Alexander's face lit up with a grin. "How? What did they say? Did Olivia Stewart say she wanted to leave Isabella?"

Tommy didn't dare look at Alexander, murmuring, "I don't think so."

"Useless!" Alexander's face darkened, and he slapped Tommy on the back of the head. "Keep talking! How many times did they fight? Why? Was it because of you?"

Alexander's rapid-fire questions overwhelmed Tommy. He was too scared to think straight, but he knew staying silent would only result in more punishment. He cried out, "I don't know how many times! I just know they stopped talking to each other for a long time!"

"So, a cold war," Alexander mused, his mood shifting to a more relaxed tone. "Speak slowly, don't be afraid."

Tommy took a deep breath and started recounting his story from when he was brought back to their home.

Alexander listened intently, all the while playing with a small golden knife, flipping it with practiced ease. The glint of the knife made Tommy nervous, and he kept his gaze down, concentrating on telling his story.

With each mention of a disagreement between Isabella and Olivia, Alexander's face brightened with a sinister smile. But when Tommy spoke of moments of reconciliation, a storm clouded Alexander's expression.

From Tommy's story, it was clear that Olivia wanted to acknowledge Tommy as her son. She had even considered leaving Isabella for him. Isabella must have known the truth about Tommy but had chosen to endure.

"Just a little more, and it would have worked! Why couldn't you make Olivia love you more? Why didn't you beg her to take you away?" Alexander seethed, glaring at Tommy as if he could devour him.

"I didn't know!" Tommy huddled in a corner, trembling with fear. Aunt Olivia had never said anything like that.

He was just a child, only able to sense who liked him or not, completely unaware of the complexities of adult relationships.

"Useless!" Alexander grabbed Tommy, yanked up his sleeve, and with a swift motion, the golden knife made a cut on Tommy's arm.

Tommy saw the flash of gold and felt a sharp pain. Looking down, he saw blood welling from the cut on his arm.

"Ahh!" Tommy screamed and fainted.

Alexander glanced dispassionately at Tommy's crumpled form. "Useless fool," he muttered, applying some powder to stop the bleeding before walking away.

When Tommy came to again, his arm throbbed with pain. He looked at his arm and saw a scar where the cut had been. It hurt—a lot.

Being just a child, Tommy couldn't handle the pain and cried out.

He heard footsteps approaching from behind.

Turning, he saw the metallic hand reaching for him, and he scrambled away, trying to hide in the crevices of the cave.

Alexander crouched in front of Tommy, pulling him out. "What are you afraid of? You'll get used to it."

Tommy shook with fear, pleading, "Please, let me go! I beg you, let me go!"

By now, Tommy knew that his so-called Uncle Goldfinger was a liar, a monster—far scarier than any snake in the cave.
