"Olivia, you polished off that entire bottle already?" Dr. Sullivan exclaimed, clearly rattled. "At this rate, you're heading for trouble! You should really see a therapist for some proper guidance."

"Shh," Olivia whispered, placing a finger to her lips. "Why are you shouting? We can't let Isabella find out! I can still manage, so it can't be that bad, right? Just give me another bottle. Once Tommy's feeling a bit better, I'll go, promise!"

Dr. Sullivan bowed slightly, his face pale with worry. "Olivia, I can't give you any more. If something happens, I could lose everything!"

Olivia pouted. "Fine, no more. But you have to keep this between us! If you tell Isabella, you're fired!"

Terrified, Dr. Sullivan quickly nodded. "I wouldn't dare! But please, Olivia, consider therapy."

"Yeah, yeah, I got it!"

As Olivia left the office, a hint of concern darkened her expression. Without the pills, she feared losing control of her emotions. But Tommy was showing signs of improvement, and abandoning him now could destroy the trust they'd built. And if Isabella found out, she'd be too worried to focus on Tommy.

After some thought, Olivia decided to discreetly buy the meds at a pharmacy. She knew overusing them was risky but promised herself she’d manage her emotions and dosage.

Walking through the castle, Olivia nodded absentmindedly at the staff greeting her. Reaching a fountain, she spotted the twins playing happily with their nanny and felt a pang of guilt mixed with relief. She turned away, signaling a guard to bring her a car.

"I need some time alone," she instructed, sliding into the driver's seat.

"Of course, Olivia," the guard replied, stepping back respectfully. Despite preferring the name Olivia over "Madam," everyone knew she was essentially the lady of the manor.

Just as Olivia was about to drive off, a small hand tugged at her sleeve. She turned to see Tommy, his big eyes staring up at her.

"Want to come with me?" Olivia asked gently.

Tommy nodded silently.

Considering his young age and the unlikely chance he'd understand or care about her errand, Olivia smiled and helped him into the car.

As they drove out, Olivia took care to drive slowly, mindful of Tommy in the backseat. Suddenly, a figure darted in front of the car, forcing her to slam on the brakes.

"Tommy, are you okay?" she asked, heart pounding, as she saw him rubbing his forehead where he'd bumped it.

Outside, a middle-aged man sat on the ground, looking a bit dazed.

"I'm so sorry, sir! Are you alright?" she asked, helping him up. "Do you need a hospital? Wait, Mr. White?"

The man grimaced as he recognized her, "Olivia!"

Seeing his discomfort, Olivia asked, "What happened? Why jump in front of my car?"

Mr. White's reputation for being crafty made Olivia wary, suspecting this might be a ploy.

"Olivia, I had no choice! They wouldn't let me in, and I needed to see you. I’m desperate for your help!"

Olivia's expression hardened. "Mr. White, I need to remind you that I've never had a father like you. At best, you were a business associate of the Peterson Group. So, let's keep it professional."

"Today, this was your doing. If you got hurt, that's on you!"

It's rare for Olivia to speak so sharply, but Mr. White's antics had pushed her limits.

Realizing her anger, Mr. White dropped to his knees, tears streaming. "Olivia, please! I'm out of options! Your tissue matched with Grace's. Can you...?"

"What?" Olivia nearly jumped in shock. "Matched? How?"

He handed her a lab report, and though she couldn't decipher the details, the results were clear: a match with Grace.

"How is this possible?" Olivia murmured, puzzled by the improbable odds.

"What do you want?" she asked, regaining her composure.

"Could you donate a kidney to Chloe? The doctors assure me it’s safe with proper care."

Olivia laughed bitterly, "Why not ask Oliver or Mia?"

"Oliver's health is too compromised, and Mia wasn't a match," Mr. White pleaded, presenting their test results.

Reading them, Olivia's skepticism only grew. Clearly, they were desperate enough to seek her out.

Years ago, Grace and Mia had tried everything to drive her away from Isabella. If not for David's loyalty, she'd have been scarred for life. And the orphanage incident—if their scheme hadn't backfired, she'd have been their victim.

"Even if I matched, so what?" Olivia asked coldly.

"Save your mother! It's no big deal, right?" Mr. White's tone turned presumptuous.

"My mother is long gone, and Grace deserves her fate," Olivia replied sharply, heading back to her car.

"Olivia!" Mr. White's voice rose in desperation, "You're part of the White family! Can’t you help?"

Olivia clenched her fists, resisting the urge to strike this shameless man.
