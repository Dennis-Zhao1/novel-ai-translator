The Last Person I Want to Face Is You

Mrs. Wang carefully placed the fish soup on the tray and handed it to Tongtong. "Young Master Tong, it's ready!"

Tongtong took the tray, a bit uncertain, and asked, "Do you think Aunt Olivia Stewart will like my soup?"

Mrs. Wang wanted to say, "Delivering soup so casually isn't proper," but seeing the eager look in Tongtong's eyes, she couldn't bring herself to discourage him.

Maybe, just maybe, Young Master Tongtong's creation would be an exception.

With that thought, Mrs. Wang nodded encouragingly. "I'm sure Olivia Stewart will love it!"

Tongtong's eyes shimmered like stars.

He carefully carried the tray step by step, but after a few steps, he hesitated, turned back to Mrs. Wang, and said, "Could you take it for me and say you made it?"

Mrs. Wang was puzzled. "Young Master Tong?"

Was this child up to some mischief again? But it didn't seem like it.

Tongtong placed the tray back in Mrs. Wang's hands, fidgeting a bit, and whispered, "I messed up recently, and Aunt Olivia isn't talking to me."

Mrs. Wang, busy in the kitchen all day, was unaware of the incident where Tongtong nearly got his sister into troubleâ€”a scandal within the Peterson household that the few witnesses were too afraid to speak of.

If she knew, she wouldn't dare let Tongtong make soup for Olivia Stewart!

Seeing Tongtong's pitiful expression, Mrs. Wang's heart softened. She sighed and said, "You're a thoughtful young man, Tongtong. I'll try taking it to her for you. But remember to care more for Olivia Stewart; being a mom is tough."

Tongtong bowed his head even more.

Mrs. Wang took the tray to the prep room behind the dining area.

She didn't dare hide anything and reported it all to the head chef: the soup was made by young master Tongtong for Olivia Stewart. The taste was probably not great, and it was up to the chef to decide whether to serve it to her.

The head chef nearly spilled the soup in frustration. "Mrs. Wang, are you out of your mind? You dare serve Olivia Stewart a soup made by Young Master Tongtong? Do you know what that child..."

Halfway through his scolding, the chef fell silent.

He had heard the rumors about the incident more than Mrs. Wang.

Seeing Mrs. Wang still standing there, clueless, he didn't explain further, just waved his hand in annoyance. "Dump it! And don't let Young Master Tongtong near the kitchen again!"

Mrs. Wang hurried away with the tray, glancing at the fish soup and sighing, "Young Master Tongtong put a lot of heart into this. It's a shame."

As she walked, she nearly bumped into Lucas Wright. "Mr. Wright!"

Lucas Wright furrowed his white eyebrows, looking at the tray in Mrs. Wang's hands. "What's in there?"

Mrs. Wang, not daring to lie, answered honestly, "Fish soup with white radish."

"Give it to me. Olivia Stewart hasn't had an appetite and hasn't been eating. She used to like this soup; maybe she'll have some."

Lucas Wright muttered as he took the soup.

"But..."

Mrs. Wang wanted to say it was made by Young Master Tongtong but feared punishment for letting him in the kitchen, hesitating.

In her moment of indecision, Lucas Wright had already taken the soup into the dining room.

"Mr. Wright, you shouldn't..."

Mrs. Wang called after him softly but couldn't stop him. All she could do was anxiously wait outside.

I watched Young Master Tongtong make the soup; it should be fine, right?

A little head peeked around the corner, and a small figure emerged.

"Young Master Tongtong! What are you doing here?"

Seeing Tongtong, Mrs. Wang broke into a cold sweat, her voice trembling.

Tongtong tiptoed to peek inside. "Did my fish soup get delivered?"

"It did," Mrs. Wang replied, glancing at Tongtong uneasily. "Why are you so determined to make fish soup for Olivia Stewart? Don't get me in trouble!"

Tongtong's hopeful eyes dimmed. "I just... want her to be a little happier."

As they whispered by the wall, Lucas Wright suddenly emerged with the empty tray.

Mrs. Wang hurried over. "Mr. Wright!"

Lucas Wright looked at her kindly. "The soup was great! Olivia Stewart finished it all. You can go now."

Mrs. Wang was taken aback, stammering, "It wasn't me, it was..."

"Mrs. Wang? Is there more fish soup? I'd like some too!"

Tongtong suddenly interrupted, pulling Mrs. Wang away.

Lucas Wright watched Tongtong's hastily retreating back, a thoughtful look in his eyes.

Wasn't this the same kid who used to never speak, seemed so withdrawn? Now he seemed just like any other child. Could he have been pretending all along?

Lucas Wright shivered at the thought.

A child so young, if true, would mean he had a very deep mind indeed.

But seeing him just now...

If he truly understood Olivia Stewart's struggles, it wouldn't be for nothing that she cared for him.

Lucas Wright stood at the door, shaking his head, then nodding, pondering before heading back to the dining room.

...

The next day, Olivia Stewart's micro-expression analysis came in.

Isabella Peterson strode into the psychologist's office, and upon sitting down, realized his palms were sweaty.

He had to admit he was nervous.

"How is it?" he asked.

The psychologist pushed his glasses up, glanced at Isabella, but didn't answer immediately.

Isabella's heart sank. "Who is it?"

The psychologist looked troubled, hesitating before responding, "Someone called the Madman."

The Madman? That flamboyant person?

In the end, I lost to him!

A bitter taste filled Isabella's heart. Her cold eyes glanced at the psychologist. "Are you sure?"

Sweat beaded on the psychologist's forehead. Avoiding Isabella's gaze, he replied, "I'm sure."

"Thank you. I'll have someone send your payment."

Isabella stood to leave, feeling an urge to hit something.

Olivia Stewart chose Ethan King!

The person she trusted the most was Ethan King!

At least it wasn't Alexander Peterson!

Isabella smirked bitterly, feeling like he'd swallowed a bitter pill.

Just as he was about to leave the office, the psychologist called out, "Isabella Peterson, wait!"

Isabella stopped at the door, not turning around. "What is it?"

"Actually... you're the person Olivia Stewart trusts the most."

At those words, Isabella felt a flash of darkness, and the next thing the psychologist knew, Isabella was gripping his collar.

"What did you say? Say it again!"

The psychologist, trembling, stammered, "Based on Olivia Stewart's micro-expressions, you are the one she trusts the most!"

Isabella's eyes widened in anger, releasing the psychologist's collar, her arms dropping limply.

The psychologist sighed in relief, taking deep breaths.

Isabella's calm face showed no emotion, only his deep black eyes were icy and intimidating.

He moved to a sofa and pointed to a chair, "Explain it to me."

The psychologist handed over the analysis report. "Isabella, this is my analysis of Olivia Stewart. From her expressions, she has two deep-seated issues: one about the child and one about her parents."

Isabella frowned at the report.

The child's situation was stressful enough, and on top of that, she had such terrible birth parents. Of course, she'd have issues.

"The child named Tongtong is her deepest pain."

Isabella's eyes widened in surprise.

"Tongtong?"

He thought her parents' betrayal was the biggest blow. After all, Olivia Stewart longed for family, but she never truly found it with either her adoptive or birth parents.

Yet, it turned out her biggest concern was Tongtong.

Was Alexander Peterson's child really that important?

A complex mix of bitterness and jealousy stirred within him.

The psychologist, seeing Isabella's expression, cautiously asked, "Isabella, you're not Tongtong's father, right?"

Isabella slammed the table, rising in anger. "What do you mean by that?"

The psychologist almost fell over, quickly bowing and apologizing. "I'm sorry, Isabella! I didn't mean anything by it! Just that, according to my analysis, Olivia Stewart feels guilty towards you because of this, which is why the person she can't face... is you!"

That's the reason?

Isabella stood there, stunned.

The psychologist continued, "Olivia Stewart feels guilt towards you because of this, but she also has deep compassion for the child. Yet the child did something that broke her heart. Coupled with her parents' pressure, all this overwhelmed her and she broke down."

The revelation left Isabella speechless.
