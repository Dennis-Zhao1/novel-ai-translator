Olivia Stewart cradled a carton of milk as she made her way back to Whispering Pines, her mind occupied with deep thoughts. Over the past few days, she had secretly analyzed the medication Alexander Peterson gave her, relying on her sense of smell and knowledge of pharmacology, given her lack of professional equipment. On the surface, everything seemed right—the ingredients, the dosage. But if that was the case, was Alexander Peterson genuinely trying to help Isabella Peterson recover?

What was amiss? Could the medication have an adverse reaction with something else?

As she stared at the milk in her hand, a conversation with Alexander from earlier flashed in her mind, and suddenly, everything clicked into place. She quickened her pace, eager to share her breakthrough with Isabella.

Inside the study at Whispering Pines, Isabella was listening to a report from Lucas Wright, her fingers tapping rhythmically on the table.

"Over the years, the eldest master hasn't just been buying influence within the company, creating deficits on purpose. Even within the estate, he's been managing things quite well."

"He's a master of disguise—always polite, never harsh with the staff, generous with his gifts. He's earned the master's trust and the staff's admiration. He's managed most of the estate's affairs and taken the opportunity to plant spies everywhere, even close to the master."

Isabella's expression grew more serious. She'd been away, managing her software and film companies while searching for Olivia, never suspecting that the seemingly harmless Alexander had such grand ambitions.

Had it not been for Lucas accidentally discovering a servant sneaking around Alexander's area, Isabella might never have realized that her every move was under surveillance!

If Alexander had been aware of their plan to investigate the infertility drug, Olivia was essentially walking into a trap.

"Has Olivia returned?" Isabella asked, her voice tinged with urgency.

Lucas glanced outside. "Not yet."

"Go get her immediately!" Isabella commanded, already moving toward the door.

Lucas hurried after her. "Please, stay calm, sir. We don't know the extent of what Alexander knows. If you rush in, it could make things worse!"

Isabella knew the risks but couldn't watch Olivia walk into danger.

"Be prepared for anything," she ordered as she descended the stairs.

Just then, a shadowy figure slipped into the room. Despite Alexander's long reach, Isabella had loyal confidants.

Seeing the look on the figure's face, Isabella's heart sank.

"Speak!"

"I followed the servant to Alexander's place. She hasn't come out since, and there's news that she was punished for trespassing."

Seems like she was disposed of after outliving her usefulness.

"Did you see Olivia?" Isabella asked, her voice sharp.

"Yes, she left before the servant sneaked in."

Relieved, Isabella nodded, signaling the shadow to leave.

Lucas, wiping sweat from his brow, cautiously suggested, "Olivia should be back any moment now."

"Yes." Isabella replied softly, watching the path outside. Under the dim glow of the lights, a small figure approached.

Finally, Isabella felt a weight lift from her heart.

She broke into a smile and eagerly walked out to meet Olivia.

"Isabella!" Olivia called out, only to be swept into a tight embrace.

"Hey! What's this all about?" Olivia protested, playfully hitting Isabella's chest.

"Careful with the milk!" Isabella grinned, holding her tighter.

Their playful exchange was interrupted by the rough scrape of Isabella's stubbled chin against Olivia's cheek, making her shiver.

"Come on, Isabella, stop…" Olivia giggled.

"From now on, you're staying by my side. No more going to Alexander's," Isabella murmured, regret lacing his words.

"But we agreed to play along, remember?" Olivia said, puzzled.

"I've been away, and Alexander's spies are everywhere. Our plan's been compromised," Isabella explained, keeping the grisly details to himself.

Olivia paused, then broke into a confident smile.

"Doesn't matter. I've figured out a solution!"

She turned to Lucas. "Could you get some infertility treatments, all kinds?"

Lucas nodded, "Yes, Olivia."

"Hold on!" Isabella exclaimed, glaring at Olivia. "What are you up to?"

Olivia shrugged. "Since you won't get checked at a hospital, I'll test these with milk to see if there's a reaction."

Isabella's eyes widened in understanding and waved Lucas off. "Go! You're too old to be lingering around."

Lucas quickly retreated.

Isabella took Olivia's hand, pulling her upstairs. "Until Lucas returns, you're my remedy."

"No way!" Olivia laughed, shaking him off. "I need to concentrate the milk to check its reaction with the drugs. If Alexander's aware, chances to gather evidence are slim!"

Isabella snatched the milk bottle dismissively. "Researching those boring bottles won't solve anything. Why not help me figure out how to make a kid faster? Isn't that the best proof?"

Olivia punched Isabella playfully on the chest. "You incorrigible flirt!"

Isabella scooped her up, heading upstairs with purpose.

"Hey! Isabella, are you serious?" Olivia protested. "I have work to do!"

Isabella silenced her protests with a passionate kiss, the sweet taste enveloping them both.

The room filled with a heady atmosphere, sparking an intense energy between them.

But then, an annoying ringtone pierced the moment, halting everything.

Isabella ignored it, focusing on trailing kisses along Olivia's neck.

Olivia, however, was distracted and pushed him away. "Come on, answer it! It might be important."

"Forget it!" Isabella muttered, biting lightly at her skin.

"Ahh…" Olivia gasped, feeling electrified and losing her focus again.

Isabella's team usually had a rule of calling back in two hours if there was no answer after three rings. But this call was relentless.

Isabella sighed, annoyed.

"Answer it," Olivia urged. "It might be urgent. Just be quick, okay?"

Isabella gave her a meaningful look, his smile teasing.

"I'm serious!" Olivia insisted. "It's not like we don't have all night."

"True, we've got six hours until morning," Isabella smirked, giving her a quick peck before reaching for the phone.

He answered tersely, "Speak!"

"Sir, bad news. While investigating the child—"

Isabella's expression hardened. He glanced at Olivia, then interrupted, "Hold on."

Muting the call, he gently covered Olivia with a blanket. "Rest first, I need to handle something in the study."

Olivia watched him leave, puzzled.

What was that call about? A child? Whose child?

Curiosity gnawed at her, so she quickly dressed and quietly followed Isabella.
