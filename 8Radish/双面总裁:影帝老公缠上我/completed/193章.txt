Isabella Peterson's Shopping Adventure

Isabella Peterson's face turned a shade darker as she silently took all the shopping bags from Olivia Stewart's hands. Hmph, carrying bags was no big deal to him!

Olivia, instantly beaming with a smile as bright as a sunflower, wrapped her arms around Isabella's, "Isabella, I just love you to bits!"

Huh?

The air around Isabella seemed to shimmer with a dazzling light, but his face remained cool and a bit haughty. "Say it again!"

"Uh… Isabella, don't get me wrong, it's just a phrase from a game, you know, sometimes it becomes a habit to just blurt it out."

Isabella stopped in his tracks, looking slightly displeased. "Who else have you said that to?"

Olivia shrank back a little, waving her hands, "Oh no, no one! Just shouted it twice while gaming."

Isabella’s expression softened a bit, "Even in games, you can’t say it. Remember, from now on, only say it to me!"

"Okay, okay." Olivia nodded obediently.

"And, it's a confession."

"Okay." Olivia nodded, then paused. Wait, what?

Isabella's eyes glinted with a mischievous triumph as he tilted his head with a proud air, "Let's go!"

With long strides, Isabella quickly left Olivia a few steps behind.

Olivia jogged to catch up, grabbing Isabella's hand, "Hey, what’s with the rush?"

Stopping, Isabella looked at Olivia’s puffed-up cheeks and felt a bit apologetic. Right, he wasn’t used to waiting for people! Usually, he walked briskly, and those behind him just had to keep up. Who dared to make him wait?

Glancing down at their interlocked fingers, Isabella’s lips curved slightly. As they started walking again, his pace subconsciously slowed.

“That’s better!” Olivia said, swinging Isabella’s hand contentedly, “Couples always hold hands while shopping, you know that, Mr. CEO? Hey, Isabella, have you never gone shopping with a girl before?”

Isabella turned his face away, a faint blush quickly crossing his handsome features. Back with Emily, he wanted to, but his health was poor. By the time he got better, Emily had already run far away. Who was he supposed to shop with?

Luckily, he found this little one again! Whether she was Emily or Olivia didn’t matter, as long as she stayed happily by his side.

Olivia tilted her head, watching Isabella’s expressions change, her eyes wide with curiosity, “Don’t tell me, you’ve never gone shopping with a girl?”

“No, you’re the first.” Isabella admitted awkwardly.

"Hahaha!" Olivia laughed heartily, her laughter bright and unrestrained.

Isabella kept his face straight, go ahead, laugh all you want!

Finally, when Olivia stopped laughing, she looked at him with a bright smile, “Isabella, I’m happy to be your first!”

“You’re the first, and the last.”

The usually aloof Isabella uttered this touching sentiment.

Olivia was so delighted, she felt like she was floating, her face glowing pink as if she'd just eaten the sweetest honey.

Olivia and Isabella strolled hand in hand, like any ordinary couple, leisurely walking down the street. Though both wore large sunglasses, Isabella’s tall and handsome figure, his strong presence, and the hint of a high-cheekboned face beneath the shades were like a magnet, drawing the eyes of many.

Especially the young women, who seemed ready to swoon and snatch his sunglasses away!

Olivia was annoyed by their gazes, so she clung tightly to Isabella’s arm, defiantly proclaiming ownership: This man is mine! Don't even think about it!

Isabella glanced at Olivia’s protective stance, feeling her warmth close to him, and his lips curved in a charming smile. Bringing her out shopping without clearing the crowd seemed like the right choice; they should do this more often!

Olivia stared down those hovering women until her eyes grew tired, eventually ignoring them. Too many people, it was just too much to handle!

Hmph, I’m not bothered with you, just let them envy!

Focusing on shopping, they browsed around for hours, with Isabella quietly accompanying Olivia. Her mantra was simple: shop, shop, shop!

Eventually, both their hands were laden with bags, and Olivia was tired, reluctantly suggesting, “Isabella, let’s head back.”

Seeing the fatigue on her face, Isabella gently pecked her forehead, “If you still want to shop, I’ll have the bodyguards take these bags and we can rest for a bit. I’ll keep you company.”

Olivia’s eyes widened, “You’d still keep me company? Aren’t you supposed to be reviewing some market strategy?”

She stuck her tongue out playfully, a bit embarrassed. Alright, she got so caught up she forgot about Isabella’s work. Forgive me for just remembering now!

“I’ve finished my work. The rest of the day is all yours! If you're tired, I can even nap with you.”

Isabella leaned in, whispering the last bit with a teasing tone.

“Get out of here! Who needs you to nap with them?” You’d only tire me out more!

Olivia blushed, pushing Isabella away.

This man was getting naughtier by the day!

No, he’d always been this naughty!

After a quick nap in the afternoon, Olivia was recharged, her morning shopping fatigue gone.

Isabella stroked Olivia’s silky hair, “Want to go somewhere else? How about a movie?”

A movie? Was Isabella asking her out on a date?

Seeing Olivia’s puzzled expression, Isabella frowned, something wrong? Amy Green’s advice wasn’t that bad, was it?

“If you don’t want to see a movie, we can do something else.”

I want to, of course I do! But…

Olivia frowned, looking conflicted.

"Isabella, do you really have nothing to do today? Maybe we should save the movie for another day."

Isabella’s brows knitted together, a cloud of displeasure crossing his face.
