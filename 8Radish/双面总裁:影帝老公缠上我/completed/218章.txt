Isabella sat in her study, scrolling through the suggestive messages she'd saved, trying to pick a few that would suit her charming yet mischievous style. Just as she was about to record them for Olivia, Lucas, her trusty sidekick, waved his phone with a smug grin.

"Boss, I already sent them for you," he announced, clearly expecting a pat on the back.

Isabella's dark eyes widened in shock. "What?"

"While you were reading them out loud, I recorded everything and sent it to Olivia!"

Isabella's heart skipped a beat. All of them? She had no idea how Olivia would react to such a barrage of bold flattery. She grabbed Lucas's phone, her mind racing.

"Any response?" she demanded.

Lucas could only shrug helplessly. "Maybe she hasn't seen them yet?"

Isabella fumed. "It's not even nine! What is she, a sleeping beauty?"

Lucas could only sweat nervously, hoping Olivia didn't hear that.

"Maybe she thinks you're not being genuine. Why don't you try saying it to her face?" Lucas suggested timidly.

"Say it? I'd rather show it!" Isabella retorted, striding towards the door with fire in her eyes. But once she reached the hallway, her resolve faltered. What if Olivia thought the messages were too much? Should she try something more romantic instead?

Meanwhile, Olivia had just finished composing a new song and was feeling quite proud of herself. She wondered why Isabella was being so unusually quiet tonight. Curiosity piqued, she considered checking on him but hesitated, fearing she might walk into a trap.

Deciding to play it safe, she pulled out her phone to call Lucas for some intel. But as she unlocked her screen, she was met with a slew of messages from him.

"Every time I see you, I want to wag my tail and swim towards you," one message said, making Olivia's eyes widen in disbelief. She quickly switched to text mode, fearing the awkwardness of hearing Lucas's voice deliver such bizarre lines.

After a moment of stunned silence, she burst into a fit of giggles. Was Lucas having a midlife crisis or what? She couldn't help but be curious about this new side of the usually straight-laced man.

Olivia tiptoed to her door, peeked out, and seeing the coast was clear, she slipped into the hallway like a ninja. But just as she thought she was home free, she bumped into Isabella.

"Isabella? You—how?" Olivia stammered, fumbling for words.

"Next time, don't just look three inches in front of you," Isabella teased, his voice smooth and commanding as always.

Olivia rolled her eyes, realizing she'd been caught red-handed trying to sneak around. She stood there, resigned to her fate, as Isabella eyed her phone intently.

"Olivia," he prompted, a dangerous glint in his eye.

"Uh, I was just trying to reach Lucas for something," she admitted, cursing herself for folding so easily under pressure.

"And what's so secretive that you can't tell me?" Isabella pressed, his voice dripping with suspicion.

"Well, Lucas might have sent something by mistake," Olivia mumbled.

Isabella snatched the phone from her hand, eager to see what Lucas had bungled this time.

"Don't blame Lucas! He probably just hit the wrong button," Olivia pleaded, trying to shield Lucas from Isabella's wrath.

Isabella's eyes scanned the messages, his frown deepening. "Lucas!" he bellowed, throwing the phone at him. "What the hell did you send to my girlfriend?"

Lucas paled, fumbling for words. "I, uh, used my account to send your messages, boss. I swear, I don't know how it got so mixed up!"

Olivia's eyes lit up with realization and she quickly switched the text back to audio. Isabella's own voice filled the room, deep and smooth: "There are four things I want to do with you every day, starting with breakfast..."

Olivia's cheeks flamed red as she glared at Isabella, who was now smirking with that infuriatingly charming grin.

Olivia dashed back into her room, slamming the door shut, but not before Isabella slipped inside just in time. Maybe he'd have to spend another night on the study couch, but he didn't mind one bit.

Lucas watched from the shadows of the hall, his face a map of wrinkles breaking into a satisfied grin. Olivia's little scrape with Isabella's messages had blown over, and everyone could breathe easy for now.

The next day brought good news: Ethan had woken up in the hospital, out of danger. But Olivia's relief was short-lived. The director called, urging her back to the set. Work couldn't wait, even with the media storm finally settling down.

Isabella watched Olivia leave, a soft smile playing on his lips. Yet he knew the peace wouldn't last. There was still the matter of Sophie and her schemes to deal with.

On set, Olivia felt the shift immediately. Her co-stars treated her with a mix of awe and distance. Even the seasoned actors were overly polite, almost reverent. It was strange, and she didn't like it.

She couldn't understand why everyone was acting so weird just because Isabella's mega-rich status had been leaked. Sure, he was a big shot, but she was still just Olivia.

Only one person treated her the same as always—Ty, her supportive co-star, who wasn't fazed by the gossip. He joked with her and made her feel normal, not like some kind of celebrity appendage.

Jealousy seethed in the air as Lisa tried to warn Ty off Olivia. "Stay away from her," she hissed. "She's with Isabella, and you know what that means."

Ty just laughed. "I'm not worried about that. But maybe you should worry about your own love life."

"What do you mean?"

"Your guy's not doing so well in the hospital," Ty shot back, leaving Lisa speechless.

Meanwhile, Isabella's team had gathered enough evidence against Sophie, ready to expose her malicious plans. But before he could confront Olivia with the truth, something unexpected happened...
