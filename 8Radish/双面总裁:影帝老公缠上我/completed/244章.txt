After all was said and done, Alexander Peterson's grayish eyes clouded over with a hint of gloom. Isabella Peterson felt a tug deep within her heart as well. Alexander's hand slowly reached for the memory card, his expression unreadable.

Not too far away, near a cluster of flowers, Olivia Stewart watched the scene unfolding. The idea of needing another man to prove her innocence struck her as utterly ridiculous. Her eyes brimmed with tears, but she tilted her head back, biting her lip hard to keep them from falling. No matter what it took, she was determined to return to Isabella Peterson's side! She needed to uncover the truth behind Isabella's infertility.

Only after watching the video did Isabella realize how wrong she had been. Olivia, for the sake of her own beliefs and to preserve her integrity, had endured unimaginable pain and hardship. In an instant, any jealousy Isabella felt vanished, leaving only a deep sense of regret and anger.

Without hesitation, Isabella stormed into the main house, barging into her father's study, causing a scene. Alexander, receiving a report from his informant, merely smirked. This was exactly what he had aimed for.

Alexander toyed with a small golden knife in his hand. His fingers were pale, clean, and elegantly long. Before joining the family business, he had been an outstanding surgeon. With a smile, he approached a rabbit cage, where a chubby bunny stared back at him with wide eyes. Suddenly, a flash of cruelty crossed his face. With a swift motion, the knife gleamed, leaving a crimson line on the rabbit's neck. The plump little bunny, eyes still wide in surprise, toppled over. Alexander deftly skinned and dissected the rabbit with a practiced hand, treating the task with the focus of performing surgery. 

The household staff watched in horror, beads of cold sweat on their foreheads as they quietly retreated. Who would have guessed that the seemingly gentle and peaceful heir to the Peterson Group had such a bloodthirsty hobby?

Upon learning that Isabella had caused a ruckus and was punished as per family tradition, Olivia rushed back to her side. "Olivia," Isabella rasped. "Lie down," Olivia instructed, tending to Isabella's wounds with unwavering focus. She never once looked Isabella in the eye, but seeing the raw, bleeding welts on Isabella's back filled her with anguish. Isabella's face was etched with pain, yet she didn't utter a sound. Her dark eyes remained fixed on Olivia’s serene face, knowing that enduring the punishment would bring Olivia back to him.

Isabella's lips curved into a smile. As long as Olivia's heart was still with him, what was a little pain? As long as Olivia was willing to return, he could find a way to win her back. 

Olivia felt the intense gaze from above and shifted uncomfortably. In her awkwardness, the cotton swab slipped, jabbing Isabella's wound. Isabella drew in a sharp breath, and Olivia immediately leaned in to blow gently on the injury. Isabella, propped on an elbow, watched Olivia's worried expression, his heart softening.

Once finished with the bandaging, Olivia gathered her supplies and turned to leave. Isabella quickly stood, ignoring the sharp pain from his wounds, and grabbed her wrist. "Don't go!"

Olivia looked at Isabella, her gaze cold and detached. "What else?" Isabella's eyes bore into Olivia's delicate face. "You've lost weight," he said. Olivia was taken aback. She had expected Isabella's usual sharp tongue, ready for criticism. She braced herself like a hedgehog, prepared for the worst. But instead, he surprised her with such a gentle comment.

"My Olivia," Isabella murmured, his warm hand cupping her cheek as if she were a rare treasure. Olivia nearly melted at his tenderness, but thoughts of that day returned, and she turned away sharply. If Alexander hadn't provided the video proving her innocence, would Isabella have cast her aside? How could she still be drawn to a man like this?

Isabella's hand fell away, and he frowned. "Are you still mad?" He asked, frustrated. "Who's really at fault here?" Olivia shrugged off his grip, but Isabella pulled her into his arms with a firm hold. Olivia struggled, inadvertently bumping his wound, and froze at his muffled groan. "Let go!" she demanded.

"No," Isabella said, holding her tighter, his stubbled chin brushing her head. "Olivia, forgive me. I promise, from now on, I'll never jump to conclusions without asking first."

Olivia stiffened at his unexpected apology. She had never imagined Isabella, who saw jealousy as beneath him, would admit such a thing. Her resolve wavered but quickly rebuilt her defenses. "It's not about jealousy," she said, her voice firm. "It's about trust. Do you understand?"

"I didn't trust you enough. I was wrong!" Isabella admitted. "But seeing my woman with another man would make any guy jealous, especially if that man is her ex!"

Olivia's calm demeanor cracked. Her brows knitted, and her voice rose. "Isabella, you're twisting things! When was I ever with Alexander like that? If you don't trust me, why are you holding me?"

She pulled away, ignoring Isabella's pain, and stormed off. Isabella, frustrated, called after her. "Olivia, do you think I'm blind? That day, under Alexander's balcony, next to the rose bushes, was that not you in his arms?"

Olivia paused, recalling the incident with a sigh. She turned back to Isabella, searching his face. "You were upset because you saw us together?"

"Why else? Did you want me to cover you with a fig leaf?" he retorted. Olivia rolled her eyes. "Isabella, you're blind!"

"…"

"That day, I twisted my ankle, and Alexander helped me. You just happened to see it!" she explained.

"That's it?" Not rekindling old flames or anything?

"Of course," Olivia mimicked his raised brow.

Isabella's laughter rumbled deep in his chest, vibrating in Olivia's ears. Despite his pain, he swept her up, spinning her around, his face lit with boyish joy. Caught up in his happiness, Olivia couldn't help but smile.

"Put me down, I'm dizzy!" she laughed. Isabella set her down, leaning in for a kiss, but Olivia quickly blocked him with her hand. 

"Without Alexander's video, would you have left me there forever? You still don't trust me!"

"I didn't need the video," Isabella said seriously. "Once Alexander got involved, I knew you weren't hurt. I didn't come to you right away because... I was insecure."

"What?" Olivia's eyes widened. Isabella, the proud, stubborn man, admitted to feeling insecure?

"I can outdo Alexander in everything, except one thing," Isabella confessed. "If you want a child, I can't..."

"Give you one," he admitted, his voice laced with vulnerability. Olivia fell silent, and Isabella, misreading her reaction, turned away, punching the wall in frustration.

"Isabella, stop!" Olivia cried, catching his hand. "You don't have to hurt yourself!"

Isabella's face was stormy. "What else should I do? I can't even give you a child. Should I castrate myself?"

Olivia was stunned, her mind reeling from his words. "Who said you can't?" she retorted.

"You mean... you don't mind?" Isabella's voice wavered, a hint of hope and humility in his tone. Olivia's heart ached, her anger forgotten.

"Actually, I came back for this," she confessed. Isabella sensed something unusual. He pulled her into his embrace, sitting them both down.

"What's going on?" he asked, his expression serious. Olivia shifted uneasily in his lap. "Don't move," Isabella murmured, his voice husky.

Olivia froze, telling him everything...
