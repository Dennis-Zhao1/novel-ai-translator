Not Enough

Isabella Peterson propped her head on one hand, watching with amusement as Olivia Stewart's face went through a spectrum of emotions.

Olivia looked up at Isabella, then quickly glanced down, flustered. "I-Isabella, aren't you going to work?" she stammered.

"I'm spending the morning with you!"

"But you said you'd go at noon! What kind of morning routine is this?"

Catching Isabella's teasing gaze, Olivia suddenly realized what she meant. She clutched the blanket tightly to her chest and eyed him warily. "Isabella, behave yourself!"

"Of course, I'll behave."

"Phew—good!"

"I'll behave openly and honestly!"

"Ah—Isabella, you scoundrel! Get your hands off!"

Lucas Wright had just reached the staircase when he heard Olivia's dramatic shout. He quickly stopped, leaned against the wall, and tried to make himself invisible.

Oh boy, the young master sure is something!

But it's already noon, and those two are probably starving. The young master might be in good shape, but can Olivia keep up? Should I discreetly remind him later?

Just the thought made Lucas shiver a bit.

Ah, never mind. Young folks are full of energy. Let them have their fun!

Besides, the young master knows how to take care of his woman!

Sure enough, an hour later, a low command came from the room: "Bring breakfast in!"

"Yes, young master!"

Lucas chuckled, though it was more like lunch now, and they'd missed meal time hours ago!

As Lucas turned, he felt a twinge in his leg and nearly stumbled. He steadied himself against the wall, inwardly lamenting: Ah, I'm getting too old for this! Luckily, the young master didn't make me wait too long this time. If it had been like last night, with hours of waiting, I might have tumbled down the stairs!

Seems like eavesdropping isn't something I should be doing too often!

As Lucas headed downstairs to order the meal, he reminded the staff: "When the young master and Olivia are upstairs, no one is to disturb them!"

Everyone shared a knowing smile, and one cheeky staff member teased Lucas, "Come on, Mr. Wright, we're all professionals here. You don't need to stand guard."

Lucas blushed a deep red.

Olivia spent the entire day holed up in the room, being playfully tormented by Isabella.

She had planned to question him about the incident in the wine cellar, whether he had mistaken Sophie for her while drunk, or if he had done it on purpose. But Isabella gave her no chance to ask, turning the tables on her instead, accusing her of hiding the fact that her facial injury had healed, and claiming he needed to make up for lost time. Poor Olivia was left at his mercy.

By evening, Olivia finally managed to drag her weary self out of the room. She was so exhausted that even lifting her legs felt like a chore. Staying in that room any longer, and she feared there wouldn't be anything left of her but bones!

After a few steps, Isabella caught up with her from behind, scooped her up effortlessly, and carried her in a princess-style carry.

The sudden lift startled Olivia, and she instinctively wrapped her arms around Isabella's neck, glaring at him playfully. "Isabella!"

She didn't realize it herself, but there was a hint of natural playfulness in her voice, despite the apparent displeasure.

Isabella's grin stretched wide, and he raised an eyebrow. "What? You want more?"

"Uh, no, no!"

Olivia shook her hands, curling up quickly.

"Hahahahaha..."

Isabella laughed, his tone mischievous. "Refreshing! Satisfying!"

Yeah, right! You might be enjoying yourself, but I'm aching all over. Do you even know how that feels?

Olivia pouted but could only grumble inwardly, not daring to challenge Isabella's authority further.

As they made their way downstairs, the staff lined up on either side of the hall, bowing respectfully at their arrival. "Good evening, young master! Good evening, Olivia!"

The chorus of greetings made Olivia blush. She peeked out from Isabella's embrace and mumbled shyly, "Good evening, everyone. You don't have to be so formal!"

This lineup and collective greeting were a bit much for her to handle!

The staff remained in place, unmoving.

Olivia felt awkward.

Uh... Did I say something wrong?

Isabella's eyes turned icy as he cast a glance over the staff. "What? Are you all deaf? Don't just stand there, get back to work!"

"Yes, young master!"

The staff complied in unison, dispersing in an orderly manner.

Olivia realized, pouting slightly, "Oh, they were waiting for your command!"

"Of course! Who do you think runs this place?"

Isabella's voice was full of pride, and he continued to give orders with authority: "Little thing, you should listen to me in the future too. Do whatever I tell you, no arguments!"

Wow, they say men lose interest once they've got what they wanted. That fast?

"But you only need to listen to me!"

Oh?

Olivia was still processing this when Isabella's deep voice resonated above her. "Everyone listen up! From now on, treat my woman like you're treating me. Whatever she says, you must do unconditionally. If there's any disrespect, you're out!"

"Isabella, don't be so harsh! They're all working for you, be a bit nicer!" Olivia tugged at Isabella's sleeve, quietly reminding him.

"Oh."

Isabella looked up, his tone still cold. "If anyone offends my woman, I'll make sure you won't forget how I deal with you!"

"Little thing, is that polite enough for you?"

Olivia inwardly floated six dots of ellipsis.

They say a man's intelligence and emotional intelligence are inversely proportional. She used to think Isabella was the exception, but maybe she misjudged.

"Hehe! Everyone, don't be too tense. Isabella's just trying to scare you. He's all talk, really. Just keep working as usual, no pressure!" Olivia awkwardly tried to salvage Isabella's image.

Isabella raised an eyebrow, clearly amused. "You woman, don't know what's good for you?"

He was trying to establish her authority, yet she kept undermining him!

"Calm down! Calm down!"

Olivia lightly patted Isabella's chest with her fair hand, leaning in to whisper in his ear, "My dear master, haven't you heard the saying, 'Winning hearts is better than winning cities'?"

Her soft, warm voice, with a girl's unique gentle fragrance, lingered in Isabella's ears, like the refreshing scent of a spring garden.

And that little hand, like a kitten's paw, playfully scratched at his heart.

Isabella stared at that little hand, his deep eyes swirling with emotion, and gulped.

"Yikes!"

Olivia's ears perked up, and she looked at Isabella in surprise. "You're hungry?" Otherwise, why would he swallow?

Isabella froze, a blush quickly flashing across his handsome face before he returned to his proud demeanor, glancing at Olivia with a meaningful smile. "Yeah, I'm hungry again, never enough!"

Oh my gosh!

This guy is hopeless!

If Olivia hadn't figured it out by now, then she'd have been tormented for no reason all day.

But she pretended not to understand, tugging on Isabella's shirt to urge him, "Then let's head to the dining room! Dinner must be ready, I'm hungry too!"

As if to prove her point, her stomach let out a long growl.

Now it was Olivia's turn to blush.

Isabella was about to turn back upstairs, but hearing the growl, he paused, then picked up the pace towards the dining room.

The spacious, open glass dining room was surrounded by flowers and had fish swimming below. The fragrant air was fresh without being overpowering. Such an inviting dining environment made the food look even more appetizing.

Lucas Wright had already directed the staff to lay out a sumptuous dinner on the table. Seeing Isabella carrying Olivia in, the old man beamed like a happy Buddha, eagerly pulling out two white high-backed chairs for them. "Young master, please! Olivia, please!"

Olivia felt a bit embarrassed, whispering, "Mr. Wright, you don't have to do that. We can handle these little things ourselves!"

"If you don't appreciate it, this old man will lose his job!"

Isabella coldly tossed out a comment, sitting down with Olivia on his lap.

Olivia felt awkward, cautiously trying to negotiate with Isabella. "Isabella, um... maybe I should sit in the chair?"

"Is my leather chair not good enough?"

Isabella glanced to the side, displeased, and muttered, "Honestly, people get worse at their job with age!"

Lucas quickly put the empty chair back, apologizing to Olivia. "Sorry, Olivia, that chair is broken!"

Olivia sighed, wanting to ask: Mr. Wright, you're not serious about telling such a blatant lie at your age, are you? But considering he was just under Isabella's pressure, she decided not to push it.

Still, how could they eat with her sitting on his lap, all awkward like this?

Who knew the young master had such a clingy side?

Olivia nestled in Isabella's arms, feeling completely out of place. She shifted a little to the left and then to the right.

"Move again, and I'll deal with you right here!"

His deep, restrained voice sounded above, and Olivia froze, not daring to move.

Isabella relaxed after a moment, then said, "Let's eat."

If not for the fact that she was hungry, he'd have done something right away—
