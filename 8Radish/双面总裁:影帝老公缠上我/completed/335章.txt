In the tranquil expanse of Meadowbrook, Isabella Peterson stood firm, undaunted by Ethan King's biting sarcasm. Her gaze was intense, unwavering.

"If you're truly Olivia Stewart's happiness," Isabella declared, "I'll step aside, no matter how much it hurts. But if there's even the slightest place for me in her heart, I'll fight for her with everything I've got."

Ethan raised an eyebrow, his expression as impassive as ever, a hint of a challenge in his eyes.

"Isabella, do you think acting all noble will make me play the gentleman and swear not to take advantage of the situation? Hate to break it to you, but I'm all about seizing the opportunity. If she's only ever found pain with you, I'll do everything I can to win her over."

Isabella smirked, confidence radiating from her. "You tried to play the caring friend role back then and still couldn't win her over. This time won't be any different. From the start, she's always seen you as just a friend."

Ethan's face paled slightly. He recalled how he had misjudged his feelings for Olivia, how he vacillated and missed his chance. His naturally soft voice and overly attractive appearance had led Olivia to see him as more of a confidant than a romantic interest. The memory made him want to kick himself.

Isabella relished Ethan's discomfort, though she kept her satisfaction hidden. The flamboyant Ethan was clearly making his move on Olivia, and honestly, Isabella was worried about whether Olivia, in her current state, might fall for him.

Isabella didn't linger at the ranch for long. By the next day, she was ready to head back home. As she prepared to leave, her twin children clung to her legs, refusing to let go. Especially little Guo Guo, who was a teary mess.

"Why are you leaving, Dad? Don't you want us anymore?" Guo Guo asked, her voice small and full of sadness.

Isabella knelt down, smoothing her daughter's hair with a gentle smile. "Silly girl, when did I ever say that? Dad just has some things to take care of. I'm sending you to be with your mom until she's better. Once she's well enough to talk and take care of you, I'll come to get you."

Guo Guo wiped her tears, slowly releasing her grip despite her reluctance. "I'll miss you, Dad."

Isabella hugged his daughter tightly, planting a gentle kiss on her forehead before turning to his son, Coco, doing the same. "Take care of your mom and yourselves, alright?"

Not far away, Olivia Stewart watched silently, her eyes red-rimmed with emotion. A pang of inexplicable sadness filled her chest, though she couldn't quite understand why.

Olivia stepped forward, taking the twins' hands, her clear eyes meeting Isabella's. Such purity in her gaze!

Isabella almost reached out to embrace her but held back, clenching his hands tightly at his sides. His deep eyes were filled with an unfathomable tenderness.

"Olivia, I hope the twins are the remedy you need. In this serene paradise, I wish for nothing but happiness for you and the twins. Even though I know being away from all the chaos is best for you, I selfishly hope you'll come back to me."

"Olivia, I'll be waiting for you."

With those words, Isabella turned and walked away, unsure if Olivia understood, but he had to say it.

"Dad's gone..." Guo Guo muttered, her tears falling despite her promise not to cry.

Olivia bent down, comforting her daughter with a hug. Guo Guo noticed Olivia's tears and quickly wiped one away with her finger, holding it up to Olivia with innocent curiosity. "Mom, do you miss Dad too? Why didn't you call out to him?"

Olivia looked at the tear on her daughter's finger, confusion washing over her. Had she been crying? Why was she sad?

From a distance, Ethan King watched the family's farewells from beside a haystack, his posture relaxed but his expression clouded with a subtle sadness.

Even though Olivia had forgotten so much, Isabella and the twins still touched her deeply. Perhaps as Isabella said, he would always just be the friend in her heart.

But at least, in her most vulnerable moments, it was him, the friend, who stayed by her side.

Ethan chuckled wryly to himself, heading over to Olivia and the twins. "Hey, kiddos, how about we go mushroom picking with Uncle Ethan?"

The peaceful days flew by, except for someone back home who was yearning and counting the days. Half a year passed in a blink.

Spring brought new life to the ranch, with lush green fields spreading like a natural carpet, dotted with vibrant wildflowers.

Olivia sat on this vast, beautiful expanse with the twins, painting. Her daily joy came from teaching them to mold clay and draw.

Though she still chose not to speak, Olivia listened when others talked to her, sometimes showing expressions on her faceâ€”an incredible improvement.

When Isabella sent the twins to Olivia, there was no tutor in tow, ensuring Olivia wasn't disturbed. Under Olivia's guidance and nature's influence, the twins grew smarter, more lively, and full of spirit.

Ethan played a crucial role too. Despite his carefree demeanor, he had a solid education and became the twins' impromptu teacher, sharing bedtime stories and little science experiments.

Ethan wasn't as heartless as he claimed, keeping Isabella in the loop with occasional video updates. Of course, there was a hint of bragging in his actions.

Watching the videos, Isabella longed to be with them, feeling a mix of envy and admiration. But he restrained himself, knowing Olivia's recovery was delicate.

Springtime was bustling on the ranch, with new workers being hired. Ethan ensured no newcomers disturbed Olivia's peace, keeping her area managed by a few trusted hands.

Olivia loved the blue skies and white clouds of this place, but the twins were full of energy. Especially Guo Guo, who couldn't sit still, always eager to see what was happening.

When Guo Guo heard workers talking about the hiring, she dashed over, dragging Olivia and Coco along, insisting they join the fun.

Olivia was gentle, always indulging the children's requests, while Coco, though often cool, was a protective brother who never said no to Guo Guo.

So, despite their disrupted painting session, they followed the little whirlwind outside the fence.

This was a sprawling ranch, divided by fences into sections. Olivia's peaceful corner was the most tranquil.

Beyond the fence, the hiring was in full swing.

Guo Guo spotted the crowd from afar, excitement lighting up her face as she tugged Olivia faster, her small legs moving quickly. "Hurry up! Hurry up!"

Meanwhile, not far from the hiring area, a middle-aged couple was making their way slowly, supporting each other as they walked.

They were none other than John and Grace Martin, dressed simply but with a strong spirit.

After Grace's recovery, they had tracked Olivia to the ranch, spending months visiting various places in search of her.

They paused at the fence, catching their breath, John supporting Grace as she leaned against it. He said...
