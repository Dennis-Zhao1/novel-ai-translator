Olivia Stewart felt utterly embarrassed as she sat in Isabella Peterson's car, wearing nothing but his shirt. She couldn't help but reflect on how she got into this awkward situation. It all started when Isabella, with his signature cocky smirk, had decided to pick her up after work without warning. She didn’t want to refuse his offer, so she hopped in the car, but things took a wild turn.

Isabella, ever the drama king, had been slightly miffed upon hearing Olivia mention a dinner with Ethan King, her close friend. He wasn’t having any of it. With a mischievous glint in his eyes, he insisted, "You should call him now! Let's go together!"

Rolling her eyes, Olivia snapped back, "Isabella, don’t think I don’t know what you’re up to! Ethan and I are just friends, like, 'talk-under-the-blanket' kind of friends."

Isabella chuckled at her retort but secretly thought, *Yeah, right. You might be able to do that, but can he?*

Eventually, Olivia decided not to meet Ethan, partly due to her disheveled state and partly because Isabella was being his usual possessive self. She knew showing up in front of Ethan like this would be mortifying.

When they arrived at Watercloud Manor, Isabella’s driver, Michael Wright, opened the car door with an overly polite demeanor. Olivia was mortified, wondering if he could sense the awkward vibe from the car ride. She hid her face in her hands, refusing to get out.

Isabella, amused by her antics, got out first and wrapped her tightly in his suit jacket before scooping her up effortlessly. "Let's go," he murmured, ignoring the subtle looks from the staff as they passed.

Olivia, feeling her face flush hotter than the sun, buried herself in his chest, wishing she could disappear. As they reached the privacy of the upstairs, Isabella whispered in her ear, "You're getting bold, aren't you?" This just made her heart race more.

Meanwhile, Ethan King had his own drama going on. Lisa, a fellow actress, had started pursuing him aggressively after discovering his true identity as a wealthy heir and former supermodel. Ethan was more interested in escaping her clutches than anything else, often finding himself cornered in bizarre situations, like hiding in restrooms to avoid her.

All the while, Sophie Cook, a rival actress, was seething in the background. Her previous attempts to smear Olivia’s reputation had backfired, thanks to an unexpected turn of events involving Daniel Johnson and Emily Young. Sophie was determined to take Olivia down, even if it meant waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

Olivia, blissfully unaware of all these machinations, found herself at the center of a complicated web of emotions and rivalries, all while trying to navigate her own tangled feelings for Isabella. As she settled into the embrace of his arms, she couldn't help but think that life was a lot simpler when it was just about friendship and fun. Little did she know, things were only getting started.
