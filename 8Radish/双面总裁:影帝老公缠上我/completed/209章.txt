Olivia Stewart looked up at Isabella Peterson with her big, teary eyes filled with desperation and pleading. Her hands clung tightly to Isabella's clothes, and she knelt slightly, appearing as humble as one could be.

"Help me, please!" she begged, her voice cracking with emotion.

Isabella remembered the call from Michael Wright earlier—Ethan King had been in an accident and needed money urgently. A wave of anger surged through her, and her eyes burned with fury.

"Get out!" Isabella's voice was cold and unyielding.

"Please, Isabella, I beg you!" Olivia's voice was full of sorrow as she clung to Isabella like she was her last hope. Her knees were about to touch the ground when Isabella suddenly grabbed her by the collar and pulled her up.

Kneeling for another man? How could she allow Olivia, whom she loved, to demean herself like this?

Olivia looked into Isabella's furious eyes, and the light in her own eyes dimmed, leaving only hopelessness. Isabella felt a sharp pain in her heart, like a needle prick. But thinking about how Olivia was doing this for another man reignited her jealousy.

Isabella wanted to yell, to break things, to destroy everything in sight. But she held back, controlling her anger with all her might.

"Give it to her," she finally muttered to Lucas Wright, who was standing by.

"Yes, ma'am!" Lucas replied promptly and went to Olivia. "Olivia, come on in. Isabella has agreed to give you the money."

"Thank you!" Olivia's voice was full of gratitude, and as relief washed over her, she slumped to the side.

Isabella's hand twitched, but seeing the servants help Olivia, she withdrew coldly and walked away.

Olivia watched Isabella's decisive retreat, tears streaming down her face. She felt lost, like a child who couldn't find her way, despite all her efforts.

Isabella walked quickly, but when she noticed that Olivia wasn't following, she slowed down a bit. He glanced back and saw Olivia standing there, full of sadness. He couldn't bear it and quietly instructed Lucas, "Give it to her."

Lucas, understanding the gesture, nodded and quickly followed Isabella's orders.

As Olivia was led into the living room, a servant rushed in with a package. "This is the package Olivia sent yesterday. You and Isabella weren't here..."

Lucas signaled for the servant to leave, but Isabella had already heard. "Bring it here," she demanded.

Lucas reluctantly handed the envelope to Isabella. It was light, containing something flat—like a card. When Isabella opened it, she found the card she had given Olivia long ago, untouched and unused.

"You never used this card," Isabella said, a hint of sarcasm in her voice. "Planning to cut ties with me from the start, huh? So why come back asking for help now?"

Olivia's face turned pale, embarrassed as if stripped bare in public.

"If I had another choice, I wouldn't have come to you. Relying on you as my last hope was a mistake!" Olivia said with a bitter smile, turning to leave.

Isabella, provoked by her indifferent attitude, slammed her hand down on the couch. "Where do you think you're going?"

Olivia's voice was cold as she replied, "Since you're not renewing the lease, I have to find another way to get the money."

"You dare!" Isabella stood up, her chest heaving with anger.

This reckless woman, still unwilling to give up! If he didn’t give her the money, she'd go to another man?

"Nobody else will want you if I don't," Isabella threatened, his voice low and dangerous.

Olivia clenched her fists, her fingernails digging into her palms. Wasn't getting caught with Ethan King bad enough? Now Isabella wanted to push her to the brink?

"I can always sell a kidney if I can't sell myself," Olivia said defiantly, looking Isabella in the eye.

The word "kidney" echoed in Isabella's mind like a thunderclap. Was she really willing to go that far for Ethan King?

Isabella felt pierced by her determination, each word like a needle pricking his heart. He couldn't let her do this.

"Remember what you said," Isabella said, tossing the card at her feet.

Ignoring the sting on her cheek, Olivia quickly bent down, picked up the card, and clutched it tightly.

"Thank you, Isabella," she said, turning to leave with a resolved expression.

Isabella sat back down heavily, pressing a hand to his chest. Olivia, this heartless woman! She thanked him and called him "ma'am" like a stranger.

Lucas watched helplessly as Isabella grappled with his emotions. "Send her away," Isabella ordered, "and make sure she gets home safely."

"Yes, ma'am," Lucas replied, concerned for Isabella’s state.

The family doctor arrived, checking Isabella's vitals, and reassured Lucas that it was just stress and nothing serious.

As the doctor left, Isabella asked Lucas, "Who did you send with her?"

Caught off guard, Lucas stammered, "I'm sorry, ma'am, I was distracted and forgot to arrange it."

Isabella grabbed a vase and smashed it at Lucas's feet. "Go now!"

Lucas hurried to make the call, but Olivia had already borrowed a car and left. Isabella stormed out, determined to find her.

"Ma'am, please rest," Lucas urged, "I'll send someone else."

But Isabella wouldn't rest until Olivia was safe, driven by an emotion he couldn't fully understand but couldn't ignore either.
