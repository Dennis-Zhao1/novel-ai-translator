Once upon a complicated time in a lavish mansion that felt more like a gilded cage, Isabella Peterson found herself embroiled in a family drama straight out of a soap opera. It started with a tense conversation with her mother, Mrs. Peterson, who had a talent for making mountains out of molehills. Isabella had just dropped a bombshell about a past relationship with Olivia Stewart, and the revelation that Olivia might have once been pregnant was enough to send Mrs. Peterson into a frenzy.

“Hold up!” Mrs. Peterson barked, clutching Isabella's sleeve as if she were about to run off with all the family secrets. “Did you say that woman was pregnant with your child? Where’s the kid?”

“Mom, the pregnancy ended,” Isabella replied, her voice cool and detached. This was not the kind of conversation she wanted to have over a cup of tea.

Mrs. Peterson’s face twisted with fury. “That woman, losing a child like that. She should be—”

“Mom, enough!” Isabella interrupted, trying to regain control of the situation. She wasn’t interested in rehashing the past, especially not when it had already been excruciatingly complicated.

Their argument spiraled into a heated debate over what had really happened all those years ago. Mrs. Peterson was convinced Olivia had been playing games, while Isabella stubbornly defended her, believing Olivia had been sincere in her choices.

Eventually, Isabella stormed out of the mansion, leaving her mother to stew in her own anger. As she made her way back to her home, a quaint little place known as the Blue Wave Cottage, she was greeted by Olivia Stewart herself, looking as cheerful as a sunflower in spring.

“Isabella, you’re back!” Olivia exclaimed, her voice sweet enough to melt the tension away.

Isabella’s demeanor softened a bit, though a shadow of doubt still lingered. He had been through the wringer, but seeing Olivia’s smile made things a little more bearable. Despite everything, as long as Olivia was by his side, he figured he could overlook the rest. 

But their respite was short-lived. Mrs. Peterson had followed Isabella back, determined to confront Olivia. She barged in, full of accusations and disdain, calling Olivia all sorts of names and dredging up old grudges.

“Mom!” Isabella shouted, trying to shield Olivia from his mother’s wrath.

Olivia looked at Isabella with a mix of hurt and disbelief. “You told her about the past?” she asked, her voice trembling.

“Olivia, it’s not like that,” Isabella tried to explain, but Olivia wasn’t having it.

The day ended in a whirlwind of misunderstandings and hurt feelings. Isabella and Olivia fled the mansion, hoping the familiar comfort of their home would help mend their fractured spirits. The flight was silent, each lost in their own thoughts, the weight of their past hanging between them.

Back at Blue Wave Cottage, Olivia retreated to her room, leaving Isabella standing outside, feeling both frustrated and helpless. It wasn’t supposed to be like this, he thought. He knocked, hoping to bridge the gap, but Olivia was in no mood for reconciliation.

“Are you planning to break the door down?” Olivia asked, opening the door just as Isabella was about to kick it in frustration.

Isabella put on his usual bravado, trying to hide his own vulnerability. “If I were to make a scene, I’d pick a better spot,” he quipped.

Olivia rolled her eyes, brushing past him. “I forgot this is your house. It’s me who should leave.”

But Isabella wasn’t about to let her go. “Where do you think you’re going?” he asked, grabbing her arm.

“None of your business!” Olivia shot back, defiant.

Isabella felt a pang of fear at the thought of losing her, the kind of fear that made him want to cling tighter, even if he wasn’t entirely sure he had the right to. “You’re my girl, Olivia. You belong here, with me.”

Olivia paused, searching his eyes for sincerity. “You really don’t care about the past?”

Isabella hesitated for a moment. “I don’t,” he said finally, though there was a flicker in his eyes that betrayed his uncertainty.

“Liar,” Olivia whispered, wrenching her arm free. “Let go!”

“I won’t,” Isabella said, as stubborn as ever. He might not have all the answers, but he knew one thing for sure: losing Olivia was not an option he was willing to entertain.
