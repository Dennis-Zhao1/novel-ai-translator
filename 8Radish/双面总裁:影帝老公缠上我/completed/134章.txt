Olivia Stewart, Lucas Wright, and the family doctor returned to the living room, the silence between them heavy enough to cut with a knife. Olivia sat quietly, staring into space, while Lucas and the doctor stood respectfully, not daring to make a sound. After a servant quietly served tea and left, the room felt oppressively still.

Finally, the doctor cleared his throat, breaking the silence with a touch of hesitation. "Olivia, I thoroughly examined Sophie Cook's facial scars. Over time, they may fade, but completely removing them will be quite difficult."

Olivia shot up from her chair, disbelief etched across her face. "How can that be?"

The doctor adjusted his glasses, struggling to find the right words. "Sophie has a skin type prone to scarring, making it very difficult for her skin to return to its original state after an injury, especially with pigmentation involved..."

Pigmentation? Olivia's eyes darted to Lucas.

Lucas, ever astute, caught Olivia's questioning look and immediately bowed his head, speaking with solemn sincerity. "Olivia, I swear on my honor and integrity, I have never tampered with Sophie Cook's food!"

"Even though I wasn't thrilled about Sophie staying at the castle, I know what's important. Sophie’s meals were prepared with the same care as yours were, with no negligence whatsoever."

Lucas went down on one knee, his voice firm. "I swear, if I have hidden anything or spoken falsely, may I live out my days in loneliness and despair."

"Lucas!" Olivia hurried to help him up. "Please, you don't have to do this."

Lucas's eyes glistened with unshed tears. "I've lived my entire life at the Peterson Group. Outside of it, I know nothing. Olivia, perhaps you don't understand the Peterson Group's rules—if a butler's loyalty is questioned, there's only one path: to end it all!"

Olivia staggered backward, shaking her head. "No, Lucas, that's not what I meant! I'm just... Sophie's condition has left me so confused. Please, don't take it personally! And I'm not your master; don't treat me like one!"

Lucas bowed deeply again. "Since the day I was brought to this castle by the young master, I've known you as my master. In my heart, you and the young master are equally important."

"I deeply regret what happened to Sophie Cook. I will investigate immediately and find out if there was an error somewhere. I promise you an explanation, Olivia."

With that, Lucas bowed deeply once more.

Olivia was pained by his humbleness. "Lucas, I'm sorry."

Lucas's eyes shone with a hint of moisture, and he lowered his head. "Olivia, I'll take my leave."

"Wait!" Olivia called after him. "Can we keep this from Isabella Peterson for now?"

Lucas hesitated, his face showing his dilemma.

Olivia gave a bitter smile. "I know this can't be kept from him forever. I just hope he doesn't find out for a few days, until my back heals a bit. At least then, he won't be as angry. I'm already overwhelmed and can't handle comforting him too."

Lucas paused and then nodded. "Alright. The young master is still at the old house, and telling him now would only worry him. I'll keep this to myself for now, but please, Olivia, take care of yourself while you're worrying about your sister."

"Thank you."

After Lucas left, the room was left with only Olivia and the doctor.

The doctor, sensing the tension, nodded at Olivia. "Is there anything else you'd like to ask me, Olivia?"

Olivia gestured to a nearby chair. "Yes, please, have a seat."

The doctor looked surprised, waving his hands. "Oh no, I couldn't possibly."

"Sit."

"Of course, of course!"

The doctor gingerly perched on the edge of the chair, ready to leap up at a moment's notice. "What would you like to know, Olivia?"

"You mentioned Sophie has a scarring skin type. Why was I able to heal completely back then? Did we use different medication?"

The doctor froze, his eyes wide. Was Olivia questioning his treatment?

He quickly stood, eager to clarify. "Olivia, I assure you, I haven't changed a thing. The medication and dosage are exactly the same as before. However..."

Olivia frowned. "Can you please just get to the point?"

"Olivia, you don't have a scarring skin type, and your cellular repair ability is exceptional, which is why you healed without a trace."

"Sophie's face, with the best treatment, should have healed at least 90%. But if she's used cosmetics or consumed pigmented foods during this time, it could have caused this persistent scarring."

"Why do I heal so well, while my sister has a scarring issue?"

"Well... perhaps you inherited different traits from your parents."

"Poor Sophie."

Olivia sighed, sinking back into her chair. Her heart felt like it was being squeezed and twisted in icy water, leaving her cold and aching.

Holding her forehead, she dismissed the doctor. "Please go. Find any possible way to help her recover. Even the smallest chance shouldn't be ignored."

"Yes, Olivia."

After the doctor left, Olivia sat there, consumed by guilt and worry, until the sound of crying and crashing from Sophie's room jolted her to action.

She rushed in, wrapping her arms around Sophie. "Sophie, calm down! I'm here!"

"Leave me alone!"

Sophie struggled wildly, and Olivia, fearing she'd harm herself, held on tightly. In the tussle, Olivia's back wound reopened, blood seeping through the bandages.

"Ah—" Olivia winced, her grip slackening.

"Sister!"

Sophie exclaimed, noticing the blood on Olivia's back. "Oh my god, you're bleeding so much!"

Olivia bit back the pain, holding Sophie's hands. "Sophie, please, stay calm and don't hurt yourself, and I'll be fine."

"Okay, I won't move anymore. Please, sit down!"

Sophie suddenly calmed, behaving like a perfect angel as she helped Olivia to a chair. But, as she turned away, a fleeting smile of satisfaction crossed her face.

Olivia Stewart, if I can't be happy, neither can you.

As Olivia sat, she gently probed, "Sophie, have you been using any makeup or eating anything with dyes?"

Sophie hesitated, then quickly shook her head. "No, not at all!"

Olivia sighed deeply, patting her hand. "I've asked the doctor to find the best treatment for you. Your face will heal, but it'll take time. Please, remember the doctor's advice—avoid makeup and watch what you eat."

No makeup? Go out looking like this?

Olivia, you really are cruel.

Sophie bit her lip in frustration, but outwardly, she nodded obediently. "I understand, Sister. You should see the doctor about your bleeding. I promise I won't do anything stupid."

Feeling dizzy and overwhelmed, Olivia nodded, instructing the servants to take care of Sophie before leaving quickly.

As Olivia left, Sophie watched her go, her jealousy and resentment twisting her face into a mask of rage that was only heightened by the scars.

The day Sophie had stood up to Lisa for Olivia was all an act, a ploy to earn Olivia's trust and erase any doubts she had. But the unexpected cut had ruined everything.

Sophie was furious, but she directed all her anger at Olivia, a hatred that words couldn't express.

Olivia, I won't let you have peace!

Burdened by guilt and worry, Olivia stumbled out of Sophie's little castle, nearly falling several times. The memory of Sophie's self-destructive episode gnawed at her heart like a swarm of ants.

Little did she know, Sophie's outburst was a calculated performance meant to manipulate her, and the glass that had cut Olivia's back was no accident.

Poor, kind Olivia, blind to her sister's true nature, bore her pain quietly, unaware that the sister she thought she knew had become as cold and calculating as a snake.

Back at her own castle, Olivia was met by Lucas, who immediately summoned the doctor to re-bandage her torn wound.

The doctor, serious as ever, warned her, "Olivia, I must be honest. There’s no quick fix for Sophie’s scars, and even if there were, it wouldn't be instantaneous. But if your wound keeps reopening, you risk infection and permanent scarring."

Olivia's eyes brightened with a reckless idea: What if...
