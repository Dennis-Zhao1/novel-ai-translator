Isabella Peterson refused to turn around, her nose wrinkled in distaste at the group of scruffy kids. "I'm not going back! I don't dislike them, but I didn't say they could touch you!" she huffed, her voice carrying a hint of childish petulance.

Watching Isabella's pouty demeanor, Olivia Stewart couldn't help but chuckle. "Isabella, they're just kids! You're getting jealous over nothing."

"Who's jealous? I'm just worried they'll mess up your clothes, and then you'll get my car all dirty!" Isabella shot back defensively.

Sensing that Isabella might say something even more embarrassing, Olivia quickly agreed, "Alright, alright, I'll be careful. Let's go hand out the candy and toys, shall we?"

She had wanted to hug the kids, but for the sake of Isabella's mood, she decided against it. Content with the compromise, Isabella took Olivia's hand and led her inside.

The kids, who had been flocking around Olivia, scattered like a startled flock of birds, keeping a cautious distance as they stole nervous glances at Isabella. Was this the handsome, tall boyfriend of their beloved Olivia? He looked just like a movie star, but so stern!

Olivia noticed the kids' apprehensive expressions and gently pinched Isabella's waist. "Don't look so serious! Smile a bit, be friendly."

Isabella shrugged nonchalantly. "Why should I smile at a bunch of little kids? That's silly."

Realizing their perspectives were miles apart, Olivia wisely fell silent. Isabella, like a walking ice sculpture, moved through the yard, and the children kept their distance.

Mrs. Wen, the head of the orphanage, came out to greet them warmly. "Olivia, you're here! Is this your boyfriend? My, he's handsome, like a celebrity!"

Olivia laughed, a bit embarrassed. "You're too kind, Mrs. Wen. It's not that exaggerated."

Isabella stood to the side, maintaining his aloof demeanor, seemingly unaffected by Mrs. Wen's compliments. Mrs. Wen awkwardly rubbed her hands, her smile faltering slightly.

Olivia quickly nudged Isabella again, whispering, "Say hello!"

Isabella's eyes darkened slightly. This little brat, she knew just where to poke! But he obliged Olivia, nodding curtly at Mrs. Wen as a form of greeting.

Mrs. Wen beamed, "Come to my office for some tea!"

"No, thanks. I want to see the kids first," Olivia said with a gentle smile. "I've been busy lately and haven't visited. How's everyone doing?"

"Everyone's doing well!" Mrs. Wen replied as they chatted and walked inside. Isabella, trailing behind, idly played with Olivia's fingers.

Inside the courtyard, the children stood eagerly, eyes fixed on Olivia. Isabella glanced around, noticing there were about twenty or thirty kids of various ages.

Olivia let go of Isabella's hand, stepping forward with a warm smile. "Hey, kiddos! I brought lots of treats and toys. How about we line up, and I'll give each of you some goodies?"

"Okay!" The children's response was loud and enthusiastic, though they couldn't help casting wary looks at the frosty-looking man beside her.

Seeing their hesitance, Olivia decided to boost Isabella's approachability. She handed him a large bag of toys. "Here, you hand out the toys while I give out the candy."

Isabella frowned at the bag in his hands but didn't toss it aside. Olivia smiled, raising her candy bag and announcing, "Everyone line up! Grab some candy from me, then get a toy from over there, okay? There's enough for everyone, so no rushing!"

"Okay!" The kids replied in unison, lining up obediently. Isabella watched Olivia's busy figure, slightly envious. How come she's so patient and sweet with them, yet always yelling at me?

Olivia cheerfully handed out candy, each child thanking her joyfully before moving on. Isabella, holding a bag of toys, found himself with no takers, standing there as the kids avoided him.

When Olivia finished with the candy, she noticed Isabella still standing there with the toys untouched. "Hey, why aren't you giving those out?"

Isabella remained stoic. "Nobody asked for them."

Standing there, holding a big bag and doing nothing—how foolish!

Olivia sighed, walking over to whisper, "Don't be so stiff! They find you intimidating. Try to be gentle, show those pearly whites—like that!"

She playfully nudged his lips upward with her fingers. Isabella forced a smile that looked more like a grimace. If it weren't for Olivia's happiness, he'd rather toss the lot into the ocean!

"Then, you should take the toys out and offer them to the kids. Bend down a bit; they're kids, and they need respect!" Olivia instructed, demonstrating.

Reluctantly, Isabella took out a toy gun and held it. Though he said nothing, he felt utterly exasperated inside. In his world, few had the privilege to make him bend, let alone for a group of kids!

Olivia, seeing his begrudging cooperation, was thrilled. Encouraging the children, she called out, "Come on, don't be shy!"

Finally, a brave little boy, tempted by the toy gun, tiptoed over to Isabella and accepted the toy with a timid "Thank you, sir!"

Isabella's face fell. Sir? Do I look that old?

The kids called Olivia "sister" and him "sir"—wasn't that calling him an old man?

Noticing his sour expression, Olivia leaned closer, whispering, "What's wrong now?"

Isabella grumbled, "Do I look old?"

Olivia giggled. "Want me to have them call you brother?"

But that'd make him the same age as these kids. Worse!

Isabella's handsome face turned sour, like he'd tasted something awful. "Forget it, sir is fine."

Olivia burst into laughter, playfully pinching his cheek. "Relax, Mr. Sir!"

Isabella's eyes flashed with mock annoyance, but the gentle touch on his cheek wasn't unpleasant.

His expression softened as he warned, "Keep teasing, and you'll pay the price!"

Olivia quickly stepped back, maintaining a safe distance. Seeing her playful interaction with the stern-faced "sir," the kids gained courage, each approaching to pick a toy and chirp "Thank you, sir!" before scampering off.

Isabella listened to the chorus of "sirs," feeling a mix of frustration and helplessness, while Olivia laughed beside him. Oh, how he longed to put her over his knee!

Soon, Isabella's bag was empty. Tossing it into a nearby trash can, he grabbed Olivia's hand. "We're done. Let's go home!"

He had no desire to linger a moment longer in this place.

"Wait!" Olivia wriggled free, grabbing a small bag of treats. "There's one more child I want to see."

Isabella frowned impatiently. "More errands?"

"It's just the boy I told you about, the one with the heart condition. He's usually alone in his room. I'll just drop this off quickly, and then we can go. You can wait in the car if you want," Olivia explained, heading toward a row of small rooms in the corner.

Without a word, Isabella followed her.

They reached the modest building, and Olivia opened one of the doors. The room was dim and small. She flicked on the light, revealing a young boy curled up in the corner. When he saw Olivia, his eyes briefly brightened before reverting to their usual guarded look.

This expression reminded Olivia of Isabella's aloofness. She approached the boy, kneeling down to gently ruffle his hair. "How have you been, kiddo? Why didn't you come outside to play?"

"Didn't want to," the boy replied softly, his voice cool and detached, unlike the other kids. For him, this was significant, as he rarely spoke to anyone.

Olivia handed him a small bag of snacks and toys, speaking kindly, "These are just for you. Do you like them?"

The boy took the bag without much reaction, his face unreadable.

Olivia gently tousled his hair again. "Are you mad at me for not visiting? I'm sorry, things got a bit hectic for me. But I promise, I'll come more often. Can you forgive me?"

The boy's small frame trembled slightly before he dropped the bag, launching himself into Olivia's arms, sobbing quietly.
