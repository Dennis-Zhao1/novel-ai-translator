The Audition Frenzy

Isabella Peterson was off on another business trip. Lately, it seemed like she was always on the move. Meanwhile, Sophie Cook was asking for money again. It felt like every other day, she had a new request.

Olivia Stewart had long since emptied her savings to support Sophie. Desperate, she resorted to using the money Isabella had given her, even scooping up the cash Isabella had dramatically thrown at her once in anger. Oh, the irony of it all—Olivia had scolded Isabella for her arrogance, yet here she was, picking up the scraps.

The last time Olivia handed over cash to Sophie, she pleaded, "Sophie, can you try to spend less? I'm really out of money. This is borrowed from a friend!"

"Come on, sis! You don't need to hide things from your own sister. I heard you've snagged a wealthy benefactor, so what's a little cash?"

"Sophie Cook!" Olivia's face changed, and Sophie quickly swapped her teasing grin for a teary-eyed look of remorse.

"I'm sorry, sis. I didn't mean it. You promised Mom you'd take care of me. Remember, you swore at her bedside!"

Olivia rubbed her temples in frustration. Yes, it was her mother's dying wish, one she never dared to forget. Even if it meant going without herself, she always took care of Sophie. But over the years, it seemed Sophie had become spoiled. Whenever Olivia couldn't meet her demands, Sophie would remind her of that promise.

Seeing Olivia's stern face, Sophie quickly reached out to hold her hand, tears welling up in her eyes. "Sis, our parents left us too soon. You're the only family I have. If you don't help me, who's going to?"

"Alright, alright. I never said I wouldn't help you," Olivia sighed. "You're my only sister. Who else would I help?"

"Thanks, sis!" Sophie beamed, her face transforming from tears to a radiant smile. Truly, she had a knack for drama—her ability to switch emotions was impressive.

Olivia held Sophie's hand tightly, looking at her with a serious expression. "Sophie, you love acting and want to be a star. I did everything I could to get you into the best acting school in the city. But I hope you'll stay focused and not get lost in the glitz and glamor of showbiz."

"Oh, sis, I know! You've told me this a hundred times!" Sophie stomped impatiently, then sweetened her tone, asking, "Can you scrape together a bit more money for me?"

Olivia was shocked. "More?!" Sophie used to ask for a few hundred, but now she was asking for thousands. At this rate, even if Olivia owned a bank, she couldn't keep up!

"Sis—" Sophie drawled, tugging on Olivia's arm and pouting. "You know, my favorite actor's new show is holding auditions soon. I need to look the part—clothes, jewelry, makeup. These things cost money! But don't worry, once I make it big, you'll be the sister of a superstar!"

Olivia wanted to roll her eyes. Sophie already forbade her from mentioning their sisterhood, worried Olivia's humble job might embarrass her. Would she even acknowledge Olivia once she hit the big time?

But seeing the hope in Sophie's eyes, Olivia swallowed her retort. She couldn't bring herself to crush her sister's dreams.

Soon, the auditions for "An Angel to Love You" were in full swing. The venue was the grand city theater, buzzing with excitement. Even before the doors opened, the plaza outside was packed with people.

Girls dressed to impress, their outfits more vibrant than a spring garden in full bloom. Among them were sweet girl-next-door types, sophisticated ladies, youthful beauties, and sultry sirens—it was like a beauty pageant.

Accompanying these hopefuls were parents, siblings, boyfriends, and even professional actors bypassing the usual casting routes, hoping for a shot with their agents in tow.

Olivia maneuvered her ice cream cart through the crowd, selling cool treats while keeping an eye out for Sophie. No longer working at the club, she spent her days shadowing Isabella. When Isabella traveled, Olivia was free to join the audition scene, sell drinks, and scrape together some extra cash for Sophie.

After nearly half an hour of searching, Olivia finally spotted Sophie. She looked stunning in a pastel pink dress, her hair tied in a high ponytail, her makeup delicate and fresh—a picture of youthful elegance.

Olivia loved dressing similarly, and with both sisters being about the same height, they often looked like twins. She pushed the cart over, handing Sophie a bottle of cold water with a smile, "Sophie!"

Startled, Sophie quickly grabbed the water and glanced around nervously. "What are you doing here?" she whispered, a hint of annoyance in her voice.

"You mentioned the audition. Everyone else has their family with them. I didn't want you to feel alone," Olivia explained.

Sophie frowned. "Fine, but did you have to come as a vendor?"

"How else do you think I get the money you keep asking for?"

"Alright, alright, I know you work hard. You don't have to keep reminding me. I've got things to do now. We'll talk later."

Olivia's smile faltered, but seeing Sophie's anxious glances at the audition line, she decided to let it go. "Okay, Sophie, I'll leave you to it. Good luck!"

"Yeah, yeah, just go already!" Sophie snapped, her mood souring as she noticed Olivia's dress was similar to her own. Embarrassed at the thought of matching a street vendor, she tossed the water back onto Olivia's cart. "I don't want your water. Move it!"

Olivia watched in shock, her heart aching. Her sister's pride and vanity were getting out of hand. Yet, around them, curious eyes turned their way, and Sophie quickly hurried off, leaving Olivia standing amidst whispers.

"Young people these days, no manners at all," an older man commented. "Are you alright, miss?"

"I’m fine," Olivia replied, wiping away her tears and forcing a smile.

"Don't mind her. With that attitude, she won't make it far," he continued.

"No, no, she didn't mean it. She's just nervous," Olivia defended.

"You're too kind. I'll take two bottles of water, please."

"Thank you!"

"You know, you've got a nice look. Why not try auditioning yourself? Even if it's just for a minor role."

"Uh, I don't have any acting experience. I think I'll stick to selling drinks."

As more people lined up for drinks, Olivia busied herself, pushing the incident to the back of her mind. Yet, a heavy weight lingered in her heart.

By noon, the plaza was still swarming with eager hopefuls. Tired from running around, Olivia parked her cart in a corner and opened a packed lunch just as her phone rang.

Balancing the phone on her shoulder, she mumbled around a mouthful of rice, "Hello?"

"Join me for lunch," Isabella's voice purred from the other end. She was parked nearby, watching Olivia.

"Isabella, you're back—" Olivia choked, caught off guard by her excitement.

Isabella's brow furrowed in concern, but her heart warmed at Olivia's reaction. "You little thing," she murmured, half-annoyed, half-amused by Olivia's scolding.

"I'm fine," Olivia managed, finally clearing her throat.

"Come on, I'm right here. Let's go eat."

Olivia glanced at her meal. After spending so much time with Isabella, simple lunches felt lacking.

As if reading her thoughts, Isabella ordered, "Toss it. We're having a feast."

With a resigned sigh, Olivia looked at her lunch. It wasn't great, but it cost twenty bucks—a lot of ice cream sales!

She walked toward Isabella's car, leaving her cart in the care of a security guard. As soon as she got in, Isabella pulled her close, breathing in her scent with a contented sigh.

Olivia giggled, trying to pull away. "Stop, I'm all sweaty."

"Doesn't bother me," Isabella grinned, nipping her neck playfully.
