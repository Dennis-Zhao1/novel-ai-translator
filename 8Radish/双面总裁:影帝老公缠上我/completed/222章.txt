Isabella Peterson was not impressed. The nerve of this woman! Yet, he couldn’t deny it—Olivia Stewart’s voice was mesmerizing, like a songbird on a sunny morning. It was infuriating how she seemed to glide through life, especially when she was on his payroll.

“Get me a glass of water!” Isabella demanded, his tone a mix of cold authority and a hint of irritation, like a king issuing orders.

Olivia, lounging casually with half an apple in hand, pretended not to hear him.

Isabella’s patience snapped. “Olivia Stewart!”

“What?” Olivia finally turned, her big eyes blinking innocently at him.

“Water!” Isabella repeated, exasperated.

“Oh!” Olivia took another bite of her apple, chewing leisurely. “After I finish my snack.”

Isabella was livid. “You’re paid to work, not lounge around! If you can’t manage, you can leave!”

Olivia tossed the apple aside, flashing a bright smile. “So, you’re letting me stay?”

“Yeah,” Isabella grumbled. He had plans to make her life a bit more challenging.

“Great!” Olivia chirped, her smile wide as she quickly poured him a glass of water. And just like that, Olivia stayed by Isabella’s side. He kept her busy with all sorts of tasks, trying to make her life difficult, but Olivia always managed to handle everything with a smile, occasionally even pulling a prank or two on him.

Over time, Isabella found Olivia’s cheerful nature lighting up his world. Her absence made him uneasy, her presence surprisingly comforting. This girl, seemingly innocent yet full of mischief, had somehow found her way into his heart.

Despite her outward cheer, Olivia was under immense pressure. Her mother was seriously ill, but Isabella’s mother insisted she devote all her time to him. Every night, Olivia rushed to the hospital after Isabella fell asleep, only to return before he woke up. The hospital care was covered by the Peterson Group, but Olivia also enlisted her friend Sophie to help out, earning some family grumbling in the process.

Her father had vanished after skimming part of the surgery money for gambling, leaving Olivia devastated. Rumors swirled around town that Olivia had abandoned her ailing mother to court a wealthy man, which weighed heavily on her.

Christopher Davis eventually caught up with Olivia, confronting her with the town gossip. “Olivia, is it true? Are you really neglecting your mom for money?”

“Christopher! You believe them over me?” Olivia’s voice broke, tears brimming in her eyes. She felt crushed under the weight of her responsibilities and the judgment of others, and Christopher’s doubt stung most of all.

Christopher quickly pulled her into a hug. “I’m sorry, Olivia. I was just worried.”

Olivia blinked away her tears and pulled back. “Let’s talk inside.”

She hadn’t broken up with Christopher, despite the insistence of Isabella’s mother, fearing he might misunderstand her situation. Meeting him outside was risky, but Christopher thought Olivia was growing distant, not realizing the toll her life was taking on her.

“Olivia, whatever you’re doing, quit it. I’ll take care of your mom’s surgery costs,” Christopher insisted.

Olivia snapped, “I’m just working as a caregiver! They pay well. Where else will I find the money we need?”

Christopher, feeling defeated, offered her what little he had saved from working multiple jobs. “I didn’t realize you’d put money over everything, but this is all I’ve got.”

Olivia’s heart ached. “I didn’t expect this from you either.”

Their argument left a rift between them, and Olivia continued her routine, trying to balance her duties with her personal life.

Two months later, Isabella was due for surgery. The medical team’s evaluation was promising, and preparations began. His mother, nervous about the upcoming surgery, summoned Olivia for another chat.

“Olivia, Isabella’s surgery is soon, but there’s something else…”

“Once he’s back in the city, I’ll be gone, right?” Olivia interrupted, trying to keep her voice steady.

“Yes. But I’ll pay you for the full year, upfront. On one condition.”

Another condition? Olivia was tired of deals and negotiations.

“What is it?” she asked, trying to mask her irritation.

“Have a child with Isabella.”

“What?!” Olivia stood abruptly, knocking over her coffee. The suggestion was preposterous.

“You won’t have to… physically. It’s a surrogate arrangement,” Isabella’s mother explained. “Think about it: a million dollars. It could save your mother.”

Olivia, horrified and angry, refused outright. She couldn’t fathom the idea, no matter the financial relief it promised.

“Please reconsider,” Isabella’s mother pleaded. “Isabella’s health is fragile, and this could be his only chance.”

But Olivia had already made up her mind. She would not be part of such a plan, leaving Isabella’s mother to rethink her strategy.
