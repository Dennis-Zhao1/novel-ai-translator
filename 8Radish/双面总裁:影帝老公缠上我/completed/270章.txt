In the dimly lit room, Alexander Peterson sat across from his brother, Isabella Peterson, exuding an aura that was as chilling as a ghost who had just crawled out of a coffin. Isabella pushed a cup of coffee towards Alexander, who took a leisurely sip and grinned.

"Well, isn't this a surprise? My brother serving me coffee. Usually, you walk around with your nose in the air, barely acknowledging my existence. Is the moon rising in the west today?" Alexander quipped, glancing out at the mist-shrouded garden.

Ignoring his brother's sarcasm, Isabella got straight to the point. "Where's the child? What do you want in exchange?"

Alexander adjusted his glasses, a wicked smile playing on his lips. "What do you think?"

"I'll give you my shares in the Peterson Group. You give me back the child," Isabella replied, keeping his voice steady despite the turmoil inside.

With Olivia Stewart's welcome party fast approaching and her true identity now public, Isabella knew he had to act quickly to rescue the child and return to Olivia's side.

Alexander's expression was filled with a smug arrogance. "Isabella Peterson," he sneered, "I never thought you'd come crawling to me."

He savored his coffee, taking his time. "Why should everything in the Peterson Group be in your hands, anyway? We're both Petersons."

"You had control for a long time, but you couldn't hold onto it," Isabella shot back sharply.

Alexander's face darkened. Raised outside the family fold, he could never match Isabella's business acumen, fueling his jealousy even more.

"I want everything in the Peterson Group," Alexander demanded, his voice dripping with envy and resentment.

"Fine," Isabella agreed without hesitation. "I'll sign over the shares. But you must return the child unharmed."

"And Olivia Stewart," Alexander added, as if it were an afterthought.

Isabella held his ground. "Don't ever try to use anyone to threaten me over Olivia Stewart. It won't work."

With a swift motion, Isabella threw the coffee in Alexander's face, his voice icy. The brown liquid dripped down Alexander's cheeks, his expression as dark as the coffee stains.

But Alexander merely licked the coffee from his lips, a sinister grin spreading across his face. "Oh, brother, did I forget to mention? That drug you took, the one that made it nearly impossible for you to have children? It might be permanent."

Isabella froze for a moment, recalling the diagnosis that had once made him insist Olivia get an abortion. But after everything, he knew better than to let Alexander manipulate him.

Alexander, unaware of Olivia's pregnancy and her discovery that the effects of the drug could be reversed, believed he had Isabella cornered. "There's only one child for you in this world, and he's not exactly healthy. Who knows what could happen to him?"

Isabella turned to leave, undeterred. "If it comes to that, I'll let you, dear uncle, take care of the remains."

Alexander was taken aback, not expecting Isabella to be so ruthless, even willing to abandon his only son.

As Isabella reached the door, seemingly without a second thought, Alexander finally snapped, hurling his coffee cup to the floor with a crash. "You win!"

Without looking back, Isabella replied, "I'll have the share transfer documents ready by tomorrow morning, but I must see the child safe first."

"Deal," Alexander conceded, his voice low and begrudging.

As Isabella left the room, his hands were sweaty, a testament to the immense willpower it had taken to maintain his composure. If Alexander hadn't caved first, Isabella wasn't sure what he would have done next.

Two days later, Isabella personally delivered the signed share transfer documents to Alexander. Alexander scrutinized the papers, reading every word with greedy anticipation.

After securing the documents, he smirked at Isabella. "Aren't you afraid I'll renege once I have the shares?"

Isabella gave him a disdainful look. "I wouldn't have given them to you if I was worried. The transfer won't be official for a week, and I can withdraw at any time."

"Fine, you win this round," Alexander admitted.

He clapped his hands, and two of his men brought out a small child. It was Isabella's son, looking dazed and frightened. Isabella's heart clenched at the sight.

While Isabella's men had turned the city upside down searching for the boy, Alexander had hidden him in plain sightâ€”in his own room, likely in a secret chamber where the child had witnessed something terrifying.

Isabella's eyes narrowed with icy anger as he took in the scene, but he forced himself to remain calm for his son's sake.

"Take the child home," Isabella ordered David Wright, who quickly complied.

Once his son was safely out of sight, Isabella turned back to Alexander, his patience finally snapping. He landed a solid punch on Alexander's face, sending him flying into the wall with a crash.

Alexander's men rushed to his aid, but Isabella easily dispatched them with a swift kick.

"If anything happens to my son, you'll pay," Isabella warned, his voice like steel.

Alexander's face went pale. His well-hidden secrets, even the most depraved, were not as secure as he had believed.

Not wanting to waste any more time, Isabella hurried back to his home. The family doctor was already examining his son, who had been through so much.

The doctor reported the boy's physical health was stable, but there were concerns about his mental state. Isabella listened, his brow furrowed with worry.

"Is there a chance he inherited a heart condition?" Isabella asked, thinking of his own troubled past.

"Usually, congenital heart conditions can be hereditary," the doctor replied. "But his condition seems manageable."

As Isabella pondered the future, he couldn't shake the fear that his children might suffer as he had. He dismissed the doctor and paced the room, wrestling with the decision of whether to protect his unborn child from a similar fate.

But the thought of asking Olivia to terminate the pregnancy was too painful to bear. Isabella knew he had to find another way to protect his family.
