Daniel Johnson Gets Hounded by the Paparazzi

Emily Young was having the time of her life, feeling like she was on top of the world. She was so caught up in her joy that she forgot who she was—or that her triumphant escapade was being broadcasted live to billions!

When Emily finally snapped back to reality, she found herself next to two muscular strangers instead of Ethan King. But she didn’t mind. As long as she was having fun, who cared about the details?

Emily, usually known for being frugal, wore a satisfied smile as she tipped the two gentlemen generously and even left her number for future encounters. The two men took the money and vanished without a trace.

Left alone amidst the chaos of her room, Emily relaxed and let her mind wander for a while before remembering she had another important reason for meeting Ethan King.

With urgency, Emily dragged her weary body to the neighboring room, only to find her monitoring software somehow connected to the internet. Panic set in, and she nearly fainted.

Struggling to keep her eyes open, Emily disconnected the link and was about to call the installation guy when a sharp pain hit her abdomen.

“Ah—” Emily clutched her stomach, collapsing onto the carpet.

Wave after wave of pain left her immobile. Seeing the crimson trail down her leg, she realized something was terribly wrong—the baby was coming early!

Braving the intense pain, Emily dialed for emergency help: “Hello, 911? Help, I’m about to... give birth!”

Emily was rushed to the hospital for emergency care.

Meanwhile, the scandalous video that had taken the internet by storm was deleted due to its explicit content. However, it seemed to have been infected with a virus that caused it to multiply even faster each time it was deleted. The internet monitors gave up, and soon, all gossip online revolved around Emily Young.

Emily’s notorious reputation spread like wildfire!

A quick online search revealed her identity, and updates flooded in: Emily’s excesses led to her baby being born prematurely, and both were fighting for survival in the hospital.

In the hospital, Emily was in surgery while Daniel Johnson, listed as her next of kin, was called to sign some papers. His hands trembled as he clutched the pen, his face a mask of fury. Had he not been confined to a wheelchair, he might have stormed into the operating room to confront Emily.

This woman had crossed all boundaries!

By dawn, the surgery was a success. Emily gave birth to a five-pound baby, who was immediately placed in an incubator.

People sighed in relief at the news. Despite the parents’ actions, the child was innocent and deserved a chance at life.

When Daniel heard that the baby was safe, he almost toppled from his wheelchair. As he wheeled himself to the nursery, gazing at his child through the glass, a swirl of emotions overtook him.

He was a father now, but why wasn’t he overjoyed?

Daniel calculated in his mind; he and Emily were divorced, his dreams of living in luxury dashed, and he was broke. What if Emily left the child with him? How could he provide?

In an instant, Daniel decided to abandon the baby, quashing any fleeting paternal instinct.

Without another glance at the infant, Daniel turned his wheelchair and left.

“Look over there! Quick!”

Suddenly, a commotion erupted as a swarm of paparazzi, armed with cameras, rushed toward him.

As a former paparazzo himself, Daniel knew the drill. He lowered his head, trying to hide his face as he wheeled away.

But a wheelchair doesn’t move as fast as legs.

Soon, Daniel was surrounded by his former peers.

“Daniel, you’re the infamous Emily Young’s husband, right? Care to comment on her behavior?”

“Congratulations on the baby! But given your wife’s reputation, do you plan on a paternity test?”

“Is it true your wife’s behavior is due to your disability?”

The questions were relentless, eyes all on Daniel’s paralyzed legs, the implication clear.

“Enough!” Daniel shouted, slapping the arm of his wheelchair, his face a shade of anger. “This is my personal business. Please, leave it.”

The paparazzi didn’t budge, microphones thrust toward him. “Come on, spill the beans!”

“Your wife’s the most scandalous woman ever. Aren’t you going to defend yourself?”

“Are you really going to raise another man’s child?”

The questions kept coming, pushing Daniel to his limits.

Seeing himself trapped, he finally understood why people despised paparazzi. They always struck when someone was down, tearing open wounds for public spectacle.

Ironically, he used to be the same way.

Daniel sighed, clasped his hands together in a pleading gesture, and said, “We’ve shared the same beat. Please, give me a break.”

One paparazzo replied, “Since we’re in the same business, you know we need a story. Help us out?”

Daniel glanced around, seeing no sign of retreat. They wouldn’t let him go without a story.

Daniel chuckled bitterly.

On his first day, his mentor taught him that to succeed, he must be relentless, even if it meant losing face or heart.

Today, karma had come full circle.

He had hoped to leave a path open for Emily for the child’s sake, but now...

“We’re divorced!” Daniel blurted out. “Whatever Emily does, it’s her business, not mine!”

“What? Divorced? When? Why? Who filed?”

As soon as Daniel spoke, the paparazzi jumped, bombarding him with questions, leaving him overwhelmed.

“Uh...” Daniel thought quickly. “Details about Emily and me will be on my Twitter. Check there for updates!”

The paparazzi, sensing a diversion, pressed on, “Why not share now?”

They knew this tactic well—once he left, the story was gone.

A keen-eyed paparazzo checked his phone and exclaimed, “Wow, you’ve got a huge following now!”

Daniel was surprised. With his meager followers, how?

“Look!” The paparazzo showed Daniel his phone. “You’re famous! People are bashing you and your wife, but those same critics made you a star. You got lucky!”

Daniel glanced at the phone, watching his follower count skyrocket. A bright idea flashed in his mind. Maybe this was his ticket to a new life.

“Ahem!” Daniel cleared his throat, taking on a spokesperson’s air. “From now on, any news about Emily or our past will be on my Twitter. I won’t say more here. Want the scoop? Follow me!”

With that, Daniel clammed up.

Seeing his determination, the paparazzi paused, eyeing one another.

Daniel, in no rush, settled into his wheelchair, feigning sleep.

“Let’s just check his Twitter later,” someone finally suggested, and the group dispersed, leaving Daniel in peace.
