Title: The Truth About Olivia Stewart

---

It turned out that Sophia Allen was never buried in the White family cemetery. Because of her past indiscretions, she wasn't deemed worthy. Instead, her grave lay at the far end of the village, nearly flattened by time and neglect.

Grace Martin stormed over, her heels kicking up the dirt in front of the lonely grave. "Dig it up!" she barked.

The two bodyguards exchanged uneasy glances. "Ma'am, this doesn't feel right," one of them hesitated. Digging up a grave did seem like bad karma, even if they weren’t superstitious.

"Fine, if you won't do it, I will!" Grace snapped, snatching a shovel from one of the guards. She jabbed it into the ground over Sophia's grave with all the force she could muster. "Sophia Allen, you wretched woman! Not only did you have an affair with my husband, but you dared to switch my child! Even in death, I'll make sure your body is fed to the dogs!"

Grace flailed the shovel wildly, but years of luxury had left her lacking in strength. Her efforts barely disturbed the dirt, but then there was a clink.

Breathless, she paused, peering down to see a corner of something dark and solid. "What on earth? Is that her coffin?" she gasped, recoiling in fear. For all her bravado, the reality left her shaken.

Her husband, James White, wrapped a reassuring arm around her, signaling the guards to investigate. "Don't worry, coffins aren't buried this shallow. It's probably just something someone left," he soothed.

The guards soon unearthed a blackened wooden box. "Open it," James ordered, his voice steady.

The box, despite being tightly sealed, had decayed through the years. A gentle tug and it splintered apart, spilling its contents. A plastic bag slid out, transparent and sealed tight, revealing a tiny set of faded pink baby clothes.

Grace gasped, "These are the clothes I dressed my child in!" Memories rushed back. Disappointed though she was to have had a daughter, Grace had still provided her firstborn with the best. These outfits were unforgettable.

James tore open the bag, retrieving the clothes. As he did, a yellowed piece of paper fluttered out. He picked it up, squinting at the shaky, aged handwriting:

"Olivia Stewart, my child, I don't know if you'll ever see this letter..."

It was Sophia Allen’s last message to Olivia, a confession from the grave.

Grace, forgetting the clothes, crowded next to James, reading the letter over his shoulder.

"I don't know if you'll see this letter, but if you are, then I'm already gone. I just pray you find it after Sophie Cook is grown..."

Sophia had left these items with a trusted villager, with strict instructions not to reveal the secret for ten years. Sophie was now thirteen. In ten years, she'd be twenty-three, old enough to fend for herself if Olivia abandoned her.

The letter continued, dropping bombshells with every line.

"Olivia Stewart, you're not my biological daughter. In fact, we're not even related. Your real parents are James and Grace White. I once worked for them...and had an affair with your father. Your mother, in a fit of anger, married me off to James Cook, the old gatekeeper, who you know as your father."

Sophia recounted the abuse she suffered and the day Grace visited, proposing a child swap. Both had daughters, so Grace's plan fell apart, much to James Cook’s fury.

In her desperation, Sophia switched the babies, sending her own daughter to live in luxury with the Whites, while Grace’s daughter endured hardship, hoping she would suffer like Sophia had.

"I know this is hard," Sophia wrote, "but blame your mother, Grace, who forced me into this. I wanted to tell you, but with Sophie Cook still young and James Cook a useless husband, I couldn't risk you leaving. So I left this for you as a reminder, hoping you’d raise Sophie first."

The letter ended with a plea not to hate Sophie Cook, who knew nothing of the truth.

As James finished reading, the letter felt as heavy as a ton of bricks. His one-time lapse with Sophia had set off a chain of misery across generations.

Grace was shaking with rage, cursing Sophia’s name. "You vile woman! You think I'm ruthless? Compared to you, I'm nothing! Even death was too kind!"

She lunged for the letter, but James dodged. "What are you doing?"

"I want to tear it up!" she screamed, seething.

"Have you lost it?" James snapped, holding her back. "We need this letter to prove Olivia’s identity. Tear it up, and we have nothing!"

Realization dawned on Grace. "You're right," she muttered, pulling back. "We need to bring this to Olivia Stewart immediately."

James carefully folded Sophia's letter, tucking it safely into his pocket. He turned to Grace, his voice softening. "Come on, let's get going. It's chilly out here."

For a moment, Grace saw the tenderness in James that she hadn't seen in years. Their marriage had been nothing but schemes and betrayals for so long.

Tears welled up in her eyes as she turned away, her voice icy. "James, don't think you can win me over. I’m leaving everything to Olivia Stewart. Your flattery won't change that."

James tightened his grip on her arm, a sad smile on his face. "I admit I once wanted the inheritance. But now..." He paused, swallowing hard. "Chasing wealth and status all my life, what did it get me? In the end, we all end up like Sophia, just dust in the wind."

"Chloe, I promise, I’ll support you in leaving everything to Olivia. She deserves it, after all she's been through."

He continued, "With her ties to the Peterson family, it’s good for her to have something of her own. It’ll give her leverage, so she won't be discarded if things go south."

Grace wiped her tears. "Young women dream of marrying rich, but they don't see the struggles behind the glamour. I thought I was escaping that by marrying you, James, but look where that got us."

James's face flushed with regret. "Chloe, I was a fool. If you'll forgive me, I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you and Olivia."

Grace leaned into him, and after twenty long years, their hearts finally beat as one again.

With the evidence from Sophia’s grave, the couple hurried back to the city, eager to find Olivia Stewart and share the truth…
