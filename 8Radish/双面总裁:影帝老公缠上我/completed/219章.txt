Olivia Stewart once experienced hypnosis.

Today's scene was the emotional climax of the movie "Send an Angel to Love You": Quinton Gale, knowing there was only a ten percent chance of success, chose to undergo surgery to live a healthy and happy life with Emily White. Emily was torn and distraught, watching as her beloved was wheeled into the operating room.

Reliving the most painful memories felt like reopening an old wound, pulling out the deeply buried agony.

Tyson stood with a calm expression, everyone assuming he was just deep in character, not realizing this was his genuine reaction.

Every scene, every line, was exactly as it had been all those years ago.

As Olivia Stewart pushed Tyson into the set, she felt an overwhelming sense of oppression, dragging her heart down with it.

The familiar setting and dialogues blurred into a dreamlike state for Olivia. Slowly, she merged with her character, Emily White, embodying all her sorrow, reluctance, and feigned strength.

The crew watching from the sidelines couldn't help but praise Olivia Stewart. A rookie actor, yet she delivered such a powerful emotional performance, rivalling even the veterans. Her portrayal in this scene alone seemed worthy of an award!

On set, "Emily" pushed "Quinton," holding back her immense sorrow, slowly into the operating room. Just as the doors closed, Emily clung to the doorframe, crying out, "You have to save him! I don't want him to die! No—"

This unscripted addition by Olivia enhanced the scene's emotional depth, earning a nod of approval from Director Wang.

Finally, "Emily" released her grip, collapsing to the floor, watching helplessly as the doors closed...

"Cut!" Director Wang's voice rang out with approval, declaring the scene a success.

Olivia, still seated on the floor, murmured to herself, "Isabella Peterson, I don't want you to die, don't..."

It's common for actors to become deeply engrossed in their roles, especially in intense emotional scenes. Just as the crew moved to help Olivia up, she suddenly lunged at the operating room doors, pounding on them frantically, shouting, "Open the door! Let me in! Please, let me stay with him, okay?"

Tyson emerged from the other side of the "operating room," witnessing Olivia's desperate pounding, her fists reddened and slightly bleeding. He rushed to hold her, "Olivia! It's just acting, calm down, it's over!"

"No! He's dead, dead..." Olivia collapsed in Tyson's arms, overwhelmed with sorrow, "I promised to stay with him. If he lives, I live; if he dies, I die. But I wasn't there for him, I failed him!"

Suddenly, in her anguish, Olivia pulled at her hair, tearing out a handful.

Tyson quickly restrained her hands, shouting, "Emily, I'm alive! Look at me! Look at me!"

"No, you're not Isabella Peterson, Isabella Peterson's surgery failed, he's dead! He's dead!"

Olivia screamed, struggling madly, as if possessed.

Everyone exchanged worried glances, never having seen someone so lost in a role before. It was chilling!

Tyson held Olivia's trembling body tightly, noticing her confused gaze. Realizing something was wrong, his expression turned serious.

Without hesitation, Tyson delivered a sharp chop to the back of Olivia's neck, causing her to pass out, finally calming down in his arms.

Tyson carried her away.

The doctor later confirmed Olivia was physically healthy, with no signs of illness. But when she awoke, she remained in a dazed state, mumbling incoherently, as if in a mental breakdown.

Isabella Peterson punched the wall, his knuckles immediately bleeding.

He had written the script hoping to help Olivia recover her lost memories. If it drove her insane instead, he could never forgive himself.

Soon, the best psychiatric doctors in the city gathered in Olivia's hospital room.

Isabella stood outside, face full of pain and anxiety.

After half an hour, the doctors emerged, with Dr. Goldstein approaching Isabella, looking grave. "Isabella, we suspect Olivia was previously hypnotized."

Hypnotized?

Isabella's hands clenched, eyes narrowing dangerously, a cold glint flashing.

Dr. Goldstein flinched, continuing, "Isabella, has Olivia ever mentioned having gaps in her memory or forgetting certain people?"

"Yes."

"Has she recently experienced strong emotions related to those memories?"

"Yes."

Dr. Goldstein nodded, "That explains it. Olivia was likely hypnotized in the past, and recent events triggered fragmented memories, leading to her current state. It's dangerous. If we don't help her sort out her memories soon, she could truly become unstable."

"Then what are you waiting for?" Isabella grabbed Dr. Goldstein's collar, eyes wide with urgency, "Go! You must heal her immediately!"

"I'm sorry, Isabella!" Dr. Goldstein gasped, struggling for breath, "I'm not skilled in hypnosis. Using a regular hypnotist on Olivia could have disastrous results. We need to find the original hypnotist or someone even more skilled!"

Isabella released Dr. Goldstein coldly, instructing Lucas Wright, "Contact the Peterson Group's medical team. Find the world's best hypnotist, no matter the cost, and get them here quickly!"

Lucas frowned but dialed the Peterson family estate without hesitation. Involving the Peterson medical team would alert the family, showing how desperate the situation had become.

But Olivia's health was worth any risk.

Olivia would eventually face the Petersons, and Isabella surely had a plan!

Lucas prayed silently, soon securing the world's top hypnotist through the Peterson medical team.

Meanwhile, Dr. Goldstein used sedatives to stabilize Olivia's condition.

The next day, the hypnotist arrived at the Golden City Hospital by private jet. After thorough preparation, the hypnosis session began. Isabella, a crucial figure in Olivia's fragmented memories, stayed by her side, holding her hand throughout.

For Olivia, whose mind was on the brink of collapse, Isabella's presence and the comfort of his touch were vital to navigating her chaotic memories.

Though semi-conscious, Olivia sensed the world around her, yet couldn't open her eyes. Then, a warm hand grasped hers, the familiar warmth bringing her unexpected peace.

Her lashes fluttered, and she sighed softly, slipping into a hypnotic state, her body slowly relaxing.

Olivia found herself in a long dream. In it, she was back five years ago—

"Let me die! Then you won't have to worry!" Sophia Allen, gravely ill, screamed, banging her head against the bed rail.

"Mom, please don't!" Olivia rushed to cradle Sophia's head, begging through tears.

Unable to hurt herself, Sophia pounded the bed with her fists, "What did I do to deserve this? Struck with this expensive illness, married to a man who only gambles and drinks, never even visiting me, I might as well be dead!"

Olivia hugged her tightly, "Mom, don't say that! You have me. I'm grown now; I'll earn money to pay for your treatment!"

Sophia suddenly stopped, looking intently at Olivia, "We can't afford tens of thousands for surgery. I don't have much time left, and your father is unreliable. I have one request for you."

Olivia wiped her tears, "Please, Mom, tell me."

"Kneel."

Olivia obediently knelt before Sophia.

"Promise me, Olivia, you'll do whatever it takes to care for your sister, to raise her well, not letting her suffer any hardship. Otherwise, I won't rest in peace!"

"Mom..."

"Say it! Promise me!" Sophia pounded the bed, her eyes wide.

Tears streaming, Olivia raised two fingers, "I promise..."

Satisfied, Sophia finally calmed, exhausted, drifting to sleep.

Olivia tucked her in, watching her mother sleep, before wiping her tears and leaving the room.

Sophia Allen had been diagnosed with kidney failure. James Cook, Olivia's father, was either drunk or gambling, never home even with Sophia gravely ill. Thirteen-year-old Sophie Cook, just starting middle school, attended summer classes. Sophia insisted on keeping her illness a secret from her.

The weight of the world fell on Olivia's shoulders. Though only eighteen, just finished her freshman year, she had to bear it all.

Olivia had always dreamed of music, but the family had saved money for Sophie's tuition, enrolling Olivia in a nursing program instead. Now, caring for Sophia was naturally Olivia's responsibility.

Caring was easy, but the dialysis and surgery costs were daunting.
