No Wild Thoughts

Olivia Stewart's eyes darted back and forth between Isabella Peterson and Alexander Peterson, her mind racing with curiosity.

Hey, you can't deny it—they really do look alike!

The more she stared, the more the resemblance became uncanny.

Though Olivia didn't voice her thoughts, her expression gave her away completely.

Both men exchanged a glance, their faces darkening simultaneously.

"Stop imagining things!" Isabella Peterson scolded, flicking Olivia on the forehead.

Olivia rubbed her forehead, pouting. "Well, maybe it's because you're not exactly the most likable person, even your own dad doesn't seem to like you!"

Isabella's eyes darkened slightly.

Olivia hadn't meant to offend, and seeing Isabella's mood shift, she quickly backtracked with a playful smile, "Hey, I like you, and that's all that matters!"

Isabella's stern profile softened, and he leaned down to plant a soft kiss on Olivia's cheek. "Say it again, I love hearing it!"

Their lovey-dovey moment was cut short by Alexander Peterson, who couldn't stand it any longer. "If you don't believe me, I can show you something," he interjected.

He pulled out his phone and played a recording. An older man's gruff voice crackled through the speaker: "Isabella, why don't you stay at the estate a bit longer? Bring your little sweetheart, stay in the guesthouse, and wait until your aunt returns so we can all be together."

Aunt? Olivia's head spun. What aunt? Alexander's father had passed away, so where did this aunt come from?

Seeing Isabella's lips curl into a sardonic smile, the realization hit Olivia—Alexander's "aunt" was his mother!

She glanced at Alexander, whose face was tinged with humiliation. Clearly, he yearned for the wealth and glory of the Peterson legacy but was tormented by his status as an illegitimate child.

But why did Alexander's mother need Isabella to be there when she returned to the Petersons?

Olivia couldn't figure it out, but since it involved the Peterson family's private matters, she decided not to pry in front of everyone.

"Let's go," Isabella said, wrapping an arm around her and turning them both around.

Olivia frowned, "We're not leaving?"

Isabella chuckled wryly, "Since the old man wants us to stay, do you think we can just leave? At least while we're here, he won't give you a hard time."

"That's the best outcome," Olivia said, feeling relieved, her tone noticeably lighter.

The two walked back together, chatting and laughing, completely ignoring Alexander.

Standing behind them, Alexander glared daggers at Isabella's back, his eyes filled with venomous hatred.

Isabella Peterson, just you wait! One day, everything that belongs to the Peterson family will be mine! Olivia Stewart will be mine too!

...

Back at their cozy retreat, Olivia's brows were still furrowed. Isabella, noticing her troubled look, playfully pinched her nose. "What's on your mind, little one? Got any questions?"

Olivia hesitated before glancing up at Isabella. "Has your father always treated you this way?"

Isabella's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Yeah, I've always been the disappointment. He never expects much from me, not even bothering to deliver a message himself, using that illegitimate son instead. Makes me feel like a failure."

Olivia's heart ached for him, and she couldn't help but speak up for him. "That's ridiculous! Your dad must have a screw loose! Even if you weren't the best as a kid, you've grown up now! Why ignore his own son in favor of his brother's illegitimate child?"

"You don't get it," Isabella said, a serious look crossing his face. "The Petersons hold tradition in high regard. Technically, the inheritance should have gone to my uncle, but his whole family died in a car accident. My father has always felt guilty for not saving them. So when he found out there was an illegitimate son, he brought him home and doted on him even more than his own son."

Olivia looked at Isabella with sympathy, wrapping her arms around his waist and burying her face in his chest. "Hug!"

Isabella stroked her hair gently. "I'm used to it; you don't need to comfort me. Besides..." He paused, a flash of pain crossing his deep eyes. "My father never loved my mother, so naturally, he doesn't care for me."

Olivia looked up in surprise.

Isabella sighed, leading her to a cozy nook. He played with her fingers, staring at the shimmering pond in front of them. "I've told you before about my family's royal lineage, right?"

Olivia nodded, snuggling closer to him. "Yeah."

"The Peterson ancestors were saved by a royal merchant, whom they then married into. That merchant is from my mother's side."

"In gratitude, the Peterson ancestors decreed that their descendants must marry into the merchant family and could neither divorce nor take concubines."

Olivia's eyes darted to Isabella. "Is White Miao Miao a descendant of that merchant family?"

Isabella laughed, amused by her seriousness, his eyes sparkling like fireworks. "Don't worry, the White family is just a regular construction supplier. According to tradition and my father's wishes, that responsibility falls on Alexander."

Olivia sighed in relief. "Then I'm not worried anymore!"

Isabella playfully pinched her nose. "Afraid someone's going to steal me away? Better keep a close eye on me then!"

"Please," Olivia scoffed, turning away, but inside, she felt a sweetness spreading through her.

Soon, her brow furrowed again. "If the White family is so ordinary, why is your father pushing you to marry White Miao Miao?"

Isabella played with Olivia's hand, his demeanor calm but his tone heavy. "Father is a man who values reputation and measures benefits carefully. I don't understand it either."

Olivia smiled, poking his chest playfully. "No need to think too hard! Just remember you can't marry her!"

Isabella chuckled, burying his head in the crook of her neck. "Don't worry, I won't marry anyone but you."

Was that... a promise?

Olivia stiffened for a moment, before melting into the warmth of happiness.

...

A few days later, Alexander's mother returned to the Peterson estate.

The old man sent a servant to inform them of a family dinner at the main house that evening.

Olivia dressed up a bit and accompanied Isabella to the dinner.

"Isabella, you're here! Take a seat," the old man called out, wearing a traditional outfit decorated with clouds and fortune symbols. He looked energetic and cheerful.

Unusually, he smiled warmly at Isabella, inviting him to sit.

Is the sun rising in the west today? Olivia thought, glancing at the old man. His smile didn't reach his eyes, and she knew he was putting on a show. She lowered her head and hung back a step, trying to make herself invisible.

Isabella, however, wouldn't leave her to face the pressure alone. He stopped, pulling Olivia to stand beside him, facing the old man. "Father," he acknowledged, his tone even.

The old man wasn't offended. Instead, he gestured to the seat beside him, "Come, meet your aunt."

"Hello, Aunt," Isabella greeted smoothly, his voice neutral.

Olivia followed suit, unable to resist sneaking a curious glance at Alexander's mother.

Her name was Magnolia.

In Olivia's memory, Magnolia was a mysterious beauty, someone she had seen a few times due to Alexander's connection.

Olivia had known Magnolia was beautiful but couldn't pinpoint why. Now she understood.

Magnolia's features were delicate and classic, a quintessential beauty with a serene grace like a calming watercolor painting, unforgettable at first sight.

In the years since Olivia last saw her, Magnolia hadn't aged a day; if anything, her beauty had deepened.

Noticing Olivia's gaze, Magnolia smiled warmly at her.

Her smile was soothing, calming any worries Olivia had.

Olivia couldn't help but smile back, walking over to sit beside Magnolia.

Isabella was unaware of Olivia's intentions. Seeing her eagerly sit next to Magnolia, his expression darkened slightly.

His girlfriend being so friendly with her ex's mother—what a situation!

Isabella took his seat, glancing at his own mother, whose smile was strained and faltering.

Alexander sat by the old man, adjusting his glasses with a gentle smile. But behind those lenses, his eyes glinted with calculation.

The old man noticed Isabella and his mother's sour expressions and gave them a stern look, a silent warning, before speaking. "Now that everyone's here, let's eat!"

Throughout the meal, everyone was lost in their own thoughts, eating in silence except for the old man, who was in high spirits. He frequently offered dishes to Magnolia, even serving her himself, his tone gentle. "Magnolia, it's good to have you back. Eat up!"

And so, the complex dance of family, power, and hidden agendas continued, each person playing their part in the grand drama of the Petersons.
