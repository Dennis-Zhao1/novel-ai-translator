Title: The Night at the Blossom Lounge

"Cut the crap, Daniel!" Olivia Stewart snapped, her voice filled with unrestrained anger. "If you've got dirt on me, spill it. Otherwise, get out of my face!"

"Straight to the point, I like it!" Daniel Johnson clapped his hands together, a smirk plastered across his face. "Let's get down to business, shall we?"

He slid a photo across the table toward Olivia. She picked it up, her eyes narrowing as she tried to make out the blurry image. It seemed to be taken in some dimly lit room. The silhouette looked vaguely familiar...

Before she could take a closer look, Daniel snatched the photo back.

"Damn it, Daniel," Olivia growled.

Daniel waved the photo tauntingly. "This little piece of evidence enough for you? Heard the rumors about you sleeping with directors for roles? Your benefactor must've worked overtime to squash those, huh? Wonder what happens if this photo gets out?"

"You're disgusting!" Olivia's face flushed with rage.

Even though she wasn't sure what the picture depicted, Daniel's brazen confidence suggested it was linked to her somehow. Daniel was a sleazy paparazzo, known for twisting stories for his gain. Who knew what kind of narrative he'd spin with this?

Olivia slammed her hand on the table. "Give me that photo!"

"Easy there!" Daniel quickly pocketed the photo, his yellowed teeth on full display as he laughed. "Olivia, you've gotten more beautiful since we last met. Remember when we were together? Maybe now, after all those men, you're even more... seasoned."

"Shut up, Daniel!" Olivia shouted, restraining herself from causing a scene in the café.

"Alright, alright, back to business," Daniel said, sitting back arrogantly. "You want the photo? Fine. Give me insider photos from your circles. I want to own the entertainment headlines. And... I want you, at my beck and call."

"In your dreams!" Olivia picked up her coffee and flung it at Daniel's face. "You're a pig!"

Daniel flinched as the hot coffee hit him, wiping his eyes as he slammed a hand on the table. "You're gonna regret this, Olivia! You think you're so clean? A year ago, you slept around to get roles!"

"What are you talking about?" Olivia was trembling with anger, grabbing Daniel's collar in a fit of rage. As she did, a tiny black device fell out—it was a hidden camera!

This scumbag was recording her!

"You really live up to your name, Daniel," Olivia sneered, crushing the device under her heel.

Daniel's face twisted with rage as he slapped the photo back on the table. "Olivia, aren't you afraid of your dirty secrets getting out and your agency dropping you?"

Olivia clenched her fists, taking deep breaths to calm herself. "You're the sleaze here! Who knows where you dug up that trash? I have nothing to hide."

"Playing tough, huh?" Daniel leaned in, his eyes glinting with malice. "Remember the night a year ago at the Blossom Lounge after we broke up?"

"Daniel!" Olivia pointed a shaking finger at him, her voice faltering. That night was her greatest shame, a memory she wished she could erase. And now Daniel was using it against her.

With her whole body trembling, Olivia snatched the photo and stared at the silhouette.

No, no! The man in the suit couldn't possibly be Daniel!

She shot up, her eyes blazing. "The man in this photo isn't you!"

Daniel's lips curled into a sinister smile, neither confirming nor denying.

Olivia's mind raced as she recalled his comments about her being with directors. Her eyes widened as the truth hit her. "That night, it wasn't you?"

"Oh, please. As if I'd waste my time on you. I traded you off and scored two exclusive stories. Big win for me!"

So, that night when she was drunk, Daniel had sold her out!

"Smack!" Olivia's hand flew, landing a slap on Daniel's face, leaving him with a swollen cheek.

"Daniel Johnson," Olivia said, a hint of relief in her voice, "after catching you with Emily Young, I was disgusted. But knowing this, I'm relieved. As long as it wasn't you, I'm grateful."

Clutching the photo, Olivia turned to leave, her tears barely held back.

"Hey, you little—"

Daniel was about to follow her when a firm hand clamped down on his shoulder, forcing him back into his seat. He turned to see a stern man who radiated authority. Daniel's stomach dropped; he knew he was in deep trouble.

"Let's take this elsewhere," the man said, his voice brooking no argument.

Daniel had no choice but to comply, nervously trailing behind.

Once outside, two burly men grabbed Daniel and shoved him into a black car.

"Hey, what are you doing? This is illegal!" he protested.

"Thud!" A punch to his gut silenced him, and a foul-smelling rag was stuffed into his mouth.

The car sped away, Daniel crumpled on the floor, fearing the worst as they drove further from the city.

Are they going to dump me somewhere?

Daniel trembled, a stain spreading down his pants. He'd wet himself in fear.

After what felt like an eternity, the car stopped. Daniel was dragged out and dumped onto the ground. The two men laid into him with their fists, and he could only curl up, whimpering.

A sharp crack echoed as something in his body broke.

"Mercy! Please, I beg you!" Daniel pleaded, his voice hoarse.

The headlights illuminated a tall figure stepping forward. It was the man from the café, his presence ominous and commanding.

"Now," the man said coolly, "tell me everything about that night."

"Y-yes, anything you want!" Daniel stammered, desperate to avoid more pain.

"Thud!" Another kick silenced him.

"You don't get to bargain," the man snapped.

Daniel, realizing he had no way out, confessed everything about how he sold Olivia out...

And thus, the truth unraveled under the cold, starless sky.
