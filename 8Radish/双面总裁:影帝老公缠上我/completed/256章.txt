Title: Alexander Peterson's Scheme

---

"Alex!"

Flora was getting anxious. She reached out to grab Alexander Peterson's arm, but he jerked back, causing his sleeve to roll up. Suddenly, Flora's eyes widened at the sight of countless scars etched along his forearm.

She gasped, covering her mouth with her hand. "Alex, you... you..."

Alexander quickly pulled his sleeve back down. "It's nothing!"

"Tell me, what's going on here?" Flora's face, usually serene, was now etched with concern.

His gaze darkened. "Ever since Olivia left, I got addicted to self-harm. When I miss her too much, I just cut myself."

Tears brimmed in Flora's eyes. She had only known that her son was growing more withdrawn, but she hadn't realized it had gotten to this extent.

With a trembling voice, she asked, "What is it that you want?"

Without hesitation, Alexander replied, "I want Olivia back!" And the Peterson family fortune too!

Flora immediately countered, "But she's with your brother!"

"Mom!" Alexander's eyes narrowed in frustration. "Olivia was my girlfriend first. Isabella used his power to steal her away! You ignored it back then, so please, don't interfere now."

Flora's face turned ashen, struck by the painful truth of his words. The guilt from past decisions weighed heavily on her.

She sighed, conceding once more, "Fine, I won't interfere with your plans, but promise me you won't harm anyone in the Peterson family. They're still your family."

Alexander's expression softened into a seemingly gentle smile. "Of course, Mom. Let me see you to your room."

"Alex, take care of yourself," Flora said, giving him a long, searching look before leaving. Her figure seemed to age as she walked away.

Alexander watched her go, a flicker of regret crossing his face. But he had bared his scars for a purpose—to ensure his mother wouldn't interfere.

The Peterson family and Olivia Stewart were his to reclaim.

Just then, his phone rang. Glancing at the screen, he saw it was his butler, Sam.

"What is it? Olivia insists on staying at Windy Villa? Let her be. By the way, have Dr. Zhang, the psychologist, come over."

---

Olivia Stewart had just returned to the Peterson estate with Isabella Peterson. While Isabella was whisked away to a private wing for medical care, Olivia was shown to a guest room. However, she declined and decided to stay at Windy Villa instead.

Without the medical team's permission to accompany Isabella, Olivia had no choice but to stay put and avoid adding to his worries. With the estate swarming with the patriarch’s and Alexander’s people, Windy Villa was the only place where Olivia felt somewhat safe.

Meanwhile, Isabella was undergoing treatment in the estate’s serene garden. Once a vibrant person, he was now grappling with the reality of being blind, a situation made worse by Olivia's absence.

To help him cope, the team had brought in Dr. Zhang, the same psychologist Alexander had called upon.

Weeks went by.

Every day, Olivia inquired about Isabella’s recovery from outside the garden. Hearing of his improvement always lifted her spirits, unaware that Dr. Zhang's subtle manipulations were taking a toll on Isabella's mental state.

One sunny day, Isabella was strolling in the garden with a nurse when whispers caught his attention from behind a bush.

"Alex, stop it! If someone sees us, it'll be embarrassing!"

Isabella halted. He clearly heard Olivia's voice!

He tensed, hands clenching into fists. Unable to see, he strained to listen.

Behind the bushes, Alexander’s sly voice carried over, "What's there to be embarrassed about? We were lovers once. If Isabella hadn’t interfered, we’d have a kid by now."

"Shh!" Olivia's voice was a whisper. "He doesn’t know. Isabella is such a neat freak. If he finds out, I'm done for!"

"So what?" Alexander scoffed. "Do you really want to spend your life with a blind man? This is your chance to ditch him! I'm the heir to the Peterson family now, you won't lose out."

"Alex, let's wait a bit. Even if I don't want to be with a blind man forever, we can't rush this. I'll just keep my distance for now."

"But I can't wait!"

The conversation grew more heated, filled with innuendos...

The blood in Isabella’s veins ran cold. He swung his foot towards the source of the voices—

"Thud!"

His foot hit nothing, and he stumbled to the ground, the whispers abruptly silenced.

"Sir!"

The nurse hurried to help him.

"Leave me alone!"

He pushed her away, struggling to his feet, his face stormy.

Olivia Stewart, he thought bitterly. So you and Alexander have never really ended!

All those claims about the child being mine, about researching fertility treatments, were just lies! You despise me for being blind!

Engulfed in rage and jealousy, Isabella failed to realize how manipulated his emotions had become under the psychologist's influence, amplifying his insecurities and past wounds.

He brushed off the nurse’s assistance, staggering back to his quarters.

Behind the bushes, two figures emerged: Alexander and... Olivia?!

Alexander watched Isabella's retreating figure, adjusting his glasses with a sinister smile.

Once Isabella was out of sight, the "Olivia" beside Alexander cozied up to him, grinning. "Mr. Peterson, how was my performance?"

Alexander distastefully pushed her away. "You'll get paid as agreed. Don't get any ideas. Next time you see Isabella, lay on the charm. Remember, your name now is—Sophie Cook!"

A flash of resentment crossed "Olivia's" eyes. "Don’t worry, I got it."

Alexander gripped her throat, his touch cold. "I don't care how you seduce Isabella, but if you harm Olivia, I'll skin you alive!"

Alexander, already possessing a sinister appearance, was terrifying when threatening—like a ghost from the underworld.

"Olivia" shivered in fear, nodding frantically.

The excruciating pain, a nightmare she’d never dare relive, kept her compliant.

This woman was Sophie Cook, who had once been rescued by a stranger. Alexander had secretly sent her away for extensive surgery. Now, she looked, sounded, and moved like Olivia Stewart.

Only the occasional glint of malice in her eyes betrayed her.

Today, Alexander had brought her in to test Isabella, and the results were promising.

Similar scenes played out several times, with Dr. Zhang’s manipulations deepening Isabella’s misunderstandings about Olivia.

Meanwhile, Olivia, isolated at Windy Villa, remained oblivious to it all.

A week later, the day came to remove Isabella’s bandages.

The ophthalmologist carefully unwrapped the gauze from Isabella's eyes, examining his pupils for signs of recovery.

Isabella blinked, then frowned, turning away. "What’s this? It’s too bright! Take it away!"

"Congratulations! Your vision will soon be restored!" the doctor announced.

Though Isabella said nothing, his excitement was evident.

Seeing the world again was thrilling, but more than anything, he yearned to witness Olivia and Alexander’s supposed betrayal firsthand.

Seeing is believing, after all. Despite hearing Olivia and Alexander’s voices repeatedly through a voice disguiser, he still harbored a flicker of doubt, whispering, "Olivia isn’t like that."

Once the bandages were fully removed, Isabella's handsome features were unmarred. Without the need for assistance, his deep, dark eyes gave no hint of past injuries.

That day, the nurse suggested a walk in the garden.

"No."

He refused immediately.

Every garden visit had filled his ears with things he wished he hadn’t heard, and he instinctively resisted.

The nurse, a bit flustered, quietly signaled to a nearby servant.

Isabella suddenly frowned.

He realized he could see the nurse’s gesture!

Though unclear and blurred, like peering through thick fog.

He blinked hard, glimpsing a fuzzy, enlarged face.

"Sir, are you okay?" The nurse leaned in, waving a hand before his eyes.

Isabella's frown deepened, but he hid his partial vision recovery, turning away coldly. "Weren’t we going to the garden? Let's go."

The nurse quickly assisted him, and together they headed outdoors.

Now able to perceive vague images, Isabella walked faster than usual.

The nurse didn’t notice, but Alexander, who had planned a spectacle for Isabella, immediately sensed something amiss. He gestured for Sophie to quietly leave and confidently approached Isabella himself...
