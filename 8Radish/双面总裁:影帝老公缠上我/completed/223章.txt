Olivia Stewart felt her heart race as she processed the unexpected proposal from Mrs. Chu. The idea of becoming a single mom through IVF was overwhelming, even if it didn’t involve physical intimacy. The thought of her life changing so drastically made her want to run the other way.

Mrs. Chu, sensing Olivia's hesitation, quickly interjected, "Olivia, please, I'm begging you. You know Isabella Peterson's surgery has only a ten percent chance of success. If something happens to him, having his child would be a comfort to me. You have a mother, you understand, right?"

Olivia’s resolve wavered. Despite her own mother’s lack of affection and favoritism towards her sibling, Sophie, she couldn’t ignore the bond of motherhood. And then there was Isabella, the proud yet melancholic young man who had unknowingly captured a piece of her heart.

"I'm sorry, Mrs. Chu. I can't give you an answer right now. I need more time to think," Olivia finally replied, pulling away and avoiding the pleading gaze of Mrs. Chu.

For two days, Olivia wrestled with her conscience, torn between the idea of giving up her future child and the desperate need to save her ailing mother. Then, unexpectedly, James Cook returned home.

Olivia cornered him at the hospital room door, eyes blazing with anger. "Did you gamble away all the money again, James? That's mom's life-saving money! What are we going to do when the hospital stops her treatment tomorrow?"

James, bleary-eyed from drinking, smirked. "Isn't that what you're here for? We raised you for eighteen years. I heard you hooked up with a big shot. Having his kid could get you a million dollars. Where else would you find such a deal? If you stick with that broke Christopher Davis, you'll get nothing. Are you trying to drive your mother to her grave?"

As if on cue, from inside the room, Sophia Allen's wailing voice reached them, lamenting Olivia's lack of filial piety.

Olivia couldn’t take it anymore. She fled, tears streaming down her face.

That night, Sophia attempted to take her own life again. Olivia, driven by desperation, sought out Mrs. Chu and signed the agreement, sealing her future.

"Can I at least stay with my mom until she's stable?" Olivia pleaded with Mrs. Chu as they prepared to leave.

"You'll only be in the way. I'll send my butler, Alfred, to handle everything. You need to focus on your health for the sake of my future grandchild," Mrs. Chu insisted, her tone leaving no room for argument.

To reassure Olivia, Mrs. Chu instructed Alfred to deliver the promised money directly to the hospital, bypassing her father entirely.

That night, Olivia was restless, consumed by worries about her mother. She wandered to the rooftop, seeking solace under the moonlit sky, only to find Isabella there as well.

"Can't sleep either?" she asked softly, crouching down next to him.

He nodded, the sharpness in his features softening as he looked at her. "I thought you needed the rest. Are you tired of taking care of me?"

Olivia blinked back tears, touched by his genuine concern. "No, not at all. I'm happy to be here."

For the first time, Isabella smiled, a sight so captivating that it left Olivia momentarily speechless. Embarrassed by her reaction, she quickly averted her gaze.

"Olivia," Isabella's voice was gentle yet earnest, "I shouldn't have dragged you into my mess."

Olivia felt a pang of fear at the despair lurking in his eyes. She pressed her hand over his mouth, "No, don’t say that. There’s always hope. I—I agreed to have a child for you. For the child's sake, you have to hold on."

Her voice faltered as she buried her face in his chest, overwhelmed by her own boldness.

"Really?" Isabella lifted her face, his eyes shining with a newfound determination.

"Yes," she whispered, leaning into his embrace, clinging to the fragile hope she had given him.

"Don't worry, Olivia. I promise I'll come back to you," Isabella vowed, holding her close with renewed strength.

"I'll be waiting," she replied softly, though the knot of anxiety in her chest remained. Her mother was still in critical condition, and she couldn't be by her side. The weight of it all was suffocating.

After ensuring Isabella was settled, Olivia left the room, exhausted. Mrs. Chu was waiting in the shadows, her voice unexpectedly kind as she praised Olivia's actions.

"You did well," Mrs. Chu acknowledged, having witnessed the rooftop exchange.

The next morning, Olivia, Mrs. Chu, and Isabella left for A City, a place with top-notch medical facilities. Despite Olivia's requests to call her mother, Mrs. Chu insisted on secrecy, fearing Isabella would learn of the arrangement. Olivia reluctantly agreed, comforted by the knowledge that her mother's condition had stabilized.

In A City, Olivia stayed by Isabella's side in the hospital's VIP suite, assisting him through numerous tests while discreetly preparing for the IVF procedure herself. She was acutely aware of the daunting road ahead—becoming a single mother, enduring societal judgment, and possibly losing Christopher forever.

The night before Isabella's surgery, as the moonlight cast a serene glow, he confessed his longing to experience love. Olivia, caught off guard, stopped his hand from unbuttoning her shirt, whispering a gentle, "Don't."

Their hearts were intertwined in an uncertain dance, each step forward a leap of faith amidst the shadows of doubt.
