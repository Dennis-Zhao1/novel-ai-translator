"I'm Just Jealous!"

Isabella Peterson yanked Olivia Stewart back as she tried to escape. "No need to worry, babe will have them dealt with ASAP."

"And how exactly? Buy one, get one free?"

Isabella shrugged casually, "We'll just torch them."

Olivia sprang up so fast she nearly hit the roof of the car. "Isabella, you can't just burn them! Sure, it'd be satisfying, but consider the cost—there goes our whole afternoon's work! Forget making money, we might even lose some! What's the point then? No way, give me what's left, and I'll sell them off, maybe with a discount!"

Isabella sighed, "There are two truckloads left. You sure you can sell them all?"

"Two truckloads? You're kidding!"

Olivia gaped so wide it looked like her jaw might unhinge. "Isabella, have you lost it? You bought two truckloads of sleeping bags? What are we, a charity for refugees? Even if you handed one out to everyone you met, you'd never use them all! Some real estate tycoon’s son you are—what were you thinking?"

Isabella stood up, towering over Olivia with a commanding presence. "You’ve got some nerve, huh? Daring to scold your man?"

Olivia's bravado crumbled. "I-I was just worried, that's all. Why'd you buy so many sleeping bags, Isabella? As the saying goes, 'Take only what you can eat.' Small businesses don't hoard stock, you know?"

"I don't know that!" Isabella huffed, arms crossed, pacing back and forth, occasionally pointing at Olivia accusingly, clearly frustrated.

"Olivia, have you no conscience? If I hadn't bought those two truckloads, do you think you could’ve sold your junk so quickly? Do you think others are dumb enough not to think of wholesaling sleeping bags?"

"So, what’s your point?" Olivia suddenly clapped a hand over her mouth, her eyes wide and innocent. "Isabella, don't tell me you bought out the entire wholesale market to stop others from stealing my business?"

A slight blush crept onto Isabella's striking features.

Olivia facepalmed, then looked pained. "You're wasting so much money! What’s the point of me selling sleeping bags now?"

"Because I’ve got money! Because I can! Didn't you say earning money yourself felt great? Didn't you say you liked the idea of us making money together? I’m giving you the chance to earn, just for fun!"

For fun... Seriously, who plays around like this? That's money!

In a flash, Olivia's joy from earning evaporated into thin air.

"Such a waste!"

"Waste? Michael, have them brought back. Each employee gets one!"

A fringe benefit like that...

Olivia sneaked a glance at Isabella, but didn't dare call the boss stingy.

Isabella pinched Olivia's cheek. "Alright, problem solved. No waste, and you don’t have to lift a finger. What’s there to be unhappy about? Smile for me!"

"Pfft—"

Olivia couldn't help but laugh at Isabella's unexpected humor.

Who would’ve thought the usually icy Isabella could crack a joke?

"Let’s go, dinner time!"

Olivia checked the time. "Isabella, isn't it a bit early? It's only 4:30!"

Isabella glanced sideways at Olivia, eyes trailing down. "Or we could do something else first?"

"No, no, no!" Olivia waved her hands, quickly putting up a defensive stance. "After a busy afternoon, I’m really hungry. Let’s go pick a place!"

"Stay put!" Isabella shot Olivia a threatening look. "Drive faster, Isabella! I want to eat at Gold City’s top seafood spot! I heard it's hard to get a table there!"

Isabella started the car with a smug expression. "Little thing, did you forget what your man does? Wherever we go, with me, you’ve got three choices: any restaurant, any hotel."

Olivia tilted her head. "And?"

"Spend any amount!"

Olivia's eyes sparkled, and she clasped her hands to her chest. "Isabella, I’m clinging to your golden leg!"

Isabella smirked mischievously, "You’re welcome to hold on, even cling on tight!"

Olivia's face turned as red as a tomato.

Michael Wright's bodyguard car led the way, with Isabella's luxury car in the middle, followed by several more bodyguard cars, all streaming toward Gold City’s top seafood spot.

As soon as Olivia saw the restaurant's sign, she could barely contain her excitement. "Isabella, when I first came to Gold City, a month's salary couldn’t cover one dish here."

Isabella bluntly pointed out, "Even if you were still a tea server, it wouldn't."

"Isabella, can we have a normal conversation?"

"I'm just stating facts! Olivia, if you’re smart, you'll cling to my golden leg and never let go. Stick with me, and you'll have your fill!"

Olivia was speechless. Can we drop the golden leg talk already?

"Once, I passed by here with a friend, drooling over the sign. We went in and blew all our money on one drunken shrimp dish. My friend claimed he was allergic to shrimp, didn’t eat a single one, just peeled them for me. Ah—Isabella, what are you doing?"

Olivia was caught off guard as the car swerved sharply right, making her scream and grab Isabella's arm, breaking out in a cold sweat.

Isabella executed a flawless turn, parking right in front of the entrance. She unbuckled her seatbelt with elegance and stepped out without a word.

Still shaken, Olivia hurriedly unbuckled herself and rushed after Isabella. "Hey, Isabella, what's the big idea? You can't just scare people like that! Even if you wanted to show off, I couldn’t see it from inside the car; I just got scared!"

Isabella remained silent, walking inside with a cold demeanor.

Olivia stomped her foot in frustration. "Isabella, what do you mean? If you don't explain, I'm not going!"

"Not going?"

Isabella turned back, eyes narrowed, a dangerous glint in her gaze. "Not going means you won’t taste the drunken shrimp. Or is it that you're longing for the guy who peeled them for you?"

"Pfft—Isabella, why do you sound so jealous?"

Olivia fanned her nose dramatically, lips curled in a playful smile. "Hmm, smells like vinegar!"

Isabella, feeling a bit self-conscious, glared down at her. "Yes, I’m jealous. Got a problem?"

"Nope!" Olivia laughed, hooking her arm with Isabella's. "I'm delighted, thrilled, overjoyed!"

Her triple declaration finally softened Isabella's expression, and he wrapped an arm around Olivia's waist as they walked in together.

Isabella's flashy car was parked arrogantly at the entrance, and the valet didn't dare move it.

Michael Wright stood guard with his team of bodyguards, all towering and stern.

Daniel Johnson and Emily Young hid in a corner, peeking out only when Isabella and Olivia were out of sight. They quickly ducked back behind a column, alarmed by the line-up of black-suited guards.

Emily clutched her back, pulling Daniel's ear. "I'm hauling this big belly around, following you everywhere, and for what? To starve?"

Daniel winced, "Honey, not so hard! It's not for lack of trying. It's like I've been cursed—every time I get a scoop, someone else beats me to it. Whenever a celebrity shows up, a bunch of hefty guys block me. I can't push through or outmaneuver them. How am I supposed to get my shots?"

"Ugh! Why did I marry you? You used to be a pretty boy, now look at you, all bumps and bruises!" Emily slapped the back of Daniel's head.

"Every day I get shoved and knocked around, my face is battered. Can't you see I'm suffering too?" Daniel grumbled, rubbing his head. "Just wait until I catch up with Olivia Stewart..."

"What? You dare go after Olivia Stewart?"

Emily tightened her grip on Daniel's ear, pulling him up. "You-you-you... You idiot! Don't you get it? Olivia's got herself a sugar daddy! But I have dirt on her with other guys. If I can meet her alone, her money will be ours!"

"Really? Honey, you've finally grown a backbone!" Emily let go, patting his face fondly.

"So stop following me around, go home and rest. We’ve got money coming our way!" Daniel reassured her.

"Alright, go find Olivia Stewart. Go on, find her!" Emily laughed, dreaming of money.

Daniel sent Emily off, then continued his stakeout, hoping for a chance to meet Olivia alone.

Unaware of all this, Olivia was upstairs in a luxurious private room, battling a table full of shrimp.

In front of Olivia was a feast of drunken shrimp, and Isabella, in disposable gloves, peeled them one by one.

"Isabella, do I have to eat it all?" Olivia asked, already feeling full.

"You must!" Isabella insisted.

"I can't eat anymore!" Olivia protested.

"But you could when he peeled them?" Isabella challenged.

Olivia fell silent.

Back then, after finishing the shrimp and spending all their money, her friend had to endure a swimsuit show in the dead of winter to earn their living expenses, ending up sick for weeks!
