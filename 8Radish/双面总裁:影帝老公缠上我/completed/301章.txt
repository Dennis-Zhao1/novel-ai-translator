The Taste is Just Right

"Hehehe..."

Isabella Peterson couldn't help but chuckle as she watched Olivia Stewart act like she was preparing for battle. Leaning in, Isabella planted a soft kiss on Olivia's rosy cheek, then reached past her to grab some utensils from the table. She picked up a piece of cod, Olivia's favorite, and offered it to her lips. "Here, have a bite!"

So, it was just feeding her after all!

Olivia blushed, slightly embarrassed, and took a bite of the fish. "I can feed myself, you know!"

Isabella gave her another peck on the cheek. "You take care of our little ones, so I'll take care of my big baby!"

Olivia's cheeks turned scarlet as she glanced around and saw the servants trying to stifle their laughter. Oh boy, this guy! He used to be all high and mighty, but ever since the kids came along, he's turned into a super dad. And now, whenever the kids are asleep, he treats her like a kid too!

She quickly ate the food Isabella offered, knowing full well that if she didn't, Isabella would stay hungry out of concern for her.

"Slow down! No one's going to steal your food!"

Isabella gently scolded her, taking a warm towel from a servant and wiping the soup from Olivia's lips. "Honestly, what did you eat while I was out for lunch? You act like you just got out of a food drought!"

Puffing her cheeks, Olivia gave Isabella a fierce glare. Well, excuse me for worrying about you being hungry!

Seeing Olivia's displeasure, Isabella softened her tone and offered her a spoonful of soup. "Olivia, don't starve yourself just to lose weight. You're not overweight at all; you were just too skinny before!"

"I really don't mind if you gain a little weight. Besides, that wedding dress designer can make you look taller, so even if you gain a little, it won't show!"

"No way!" Olivia shot back without thinking. Realizing she'd already eaten a lot thanks to Isabella's feeding, she quickly declared, "I'm full!"

"Olivia!" Isabella raised her voice, slamming her chopsticks on the table. "Even if you want to slim down for the wedding dress, there's no rush. Why starve yourself?"

Olivia opened her mouth, stunned at Isabella's implication. What did he mean by 'no rush'? As if she were desperate to get married!

"Who's starving themselves? I just ate a little bit!" Olivia grumbled, hopping off Isabella's lap and heading upstairs.

Uh-oh, she's mad now?

Isabella's expression soured. Ever since Olivia had the kids, her mood swings were unpredictable and harder to handle. Spoiled rotten, that's what she was!

Picking up his chopsticks, Isabella tried to eat, but after a couple of bites, he found the food tasteless and hard to swallow.

"Who cooked tonight's meal? It's awful—fire them!" he barked, slamming his chopsticks down again.

Lucas Wright, the butler, stood nearby, feeling a tad sorry for the ill-fated chef. He stepped forward, bowing cautiously. "It was Chef White. Mrs. Stewart praised their cod as the best, so..."

Isabella waved his hand dismissively, quickly changing his mind. "Never mind, keep them."

Lucas breathed a sigh of relief. Indeed, Mrs. Stewart had a calming effect on Mr. Peterson!

"Actually," Lucas ventured, gathering his courage, "Mrs. Stewart's current appetite is normal. During her pregnancy with the twins, her body's consumption was double, so her appetite naturally increased. Now that she's given birth, everything will gradually return to normal."

Isabella's eyes lit up. He hadn't considered that—maybe he'd misjudged Olivia.

Seeing that Isabella wasn't angry, Lucas pressed on. "And if Mrs. Stewart is dieting to look her best in a wedding dress, you should be happy! She's eager to marry you..."

But before Lucas could finish, Isabella had already kicked back his chair and was heading upstairs in long strides. 

Upstairs, Olivia stood by the window, lost in thought. Isabella approached and wrapped his arms around her from behind. "Olivia!"

He lowered his head, inhaling the scent of her hair with a contented sigh. Olivia, startled by the warmth, turned her head. "Isabella? Done eating so soon?"

"Nope!" Isabella's voice was muffled, as he nuzzled against her neck like a spoiled child. "Without you by my side, I can't eat!"

Olivia rolled her eyes and pulled Isabella back downstairs. "A grown man acting like a child—is that really necessary?"

Isabella, trying to win points, leaned closer. "I want to lose weight too! Because I'm even more eager to see you in that wedding dress!"

Olivia couldn't help but laugh. Was this his way of apologizing?

The dining table was still set, covered with clear warming lids. Seeing them return, Lucas quickly ordered the lids to be removed. Olivia pushed Isabella into a chair, her expression serious. "Sit and eat properly!"

Isabella grinned, pulling Olivia onto his lap. "Isabella!" she protested, frowning at him.

He arched an eyebrow, glancing at the food. Clearly, he was asking to be fed.

Olivia pouted. "Feed yourself!"

He just sat there, looking at her without picking up his chopsticks. With a sigh, Olivia picked up the chopsticks, her eyes scanning the table. She deliberately picked a piece of sweet and sour fish and brought it to Isabella's lips.

Olivia loved sweet and sour fish, but Isabella detested the tangy flavor. Sure enough, as soon as the vinegar hit his nose, Isabella wrinkled his brow.

Olivia smirked, teasingly pushing the fish closer. Isabella gave her a calm look, then, in a swift move, took the fish—and the chopsticks—into his mouth.

Olivia quickly pulled the chopsticks out, watching Isabella's expression as he chewed. His eyebrows furrowed, but he nodded as if savoring the taste. "Hmm, not bad."

Olivia, both embarrassed and annoyed, gave Isabella a hard look before picking up more food from the table, feeding him one bite after another without giving him a chance to speak.

Didn't he say it tasted good? Well, eat up, eat plenty!

Isabella, cheeks puffed with food, watched Olivia's irritated little face with amusement. This little devil!

After dinner, Isabella suggested they go shopping for a bracelet, and Olivia eagerly agreed. She never told Isabella about her mother's heirloom. Some things were better left unsaid, preserving her mother's dignity.

Getting rid of the old bracelet felt right, burying away a past best forgotten. With the kids still napping, Olivia and Isabella snuck out quietly, accompanied by two bodyguards. Isabella led Olivia to the city's largest luxury mall.

On the second floor, the jewelry section dazzled with all kinds of glittering gold, silver, and jade. Olivia wasn't a fan of gold and silver—too flashy. And jade pieces, like bracelets, felt heavy. She glanced at her slender wrists, feeling they couldn't bear such weight.

Knowing Olivia's tastes well, Isabella bypassed the gold counters and headed straight for the sparkling crystal displays. Olivia's face lit up at the sight of the clear, shining crystals. "This one's nice!"

"And this one, the flower design is lovely!"

As Olivia examined each piece, Isabella signaled the clerk to let her try anything she lingered on for more than a couple of seconds. After much deliberation, Olivia finally chose a simple yet stylish bracelet. The thin, silver chain was adorned with a few four-leaf clovers.

Four-leaf clovers, symbols of luck, were not only pretty but carried a wonderful meaning. Olivia's eyes sparkled when she saw the bracelet. Trying it on, it fit perfectly, as if custom-made for her.

"This one!" Olivia declared excitedly to Isabella. She took it off to admire it more closely, and suddenly noticed...
