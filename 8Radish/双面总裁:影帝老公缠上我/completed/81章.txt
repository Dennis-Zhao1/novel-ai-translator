"Stop right there, you jerk!"

Sophie Cook's face was as pale as a sheet, and she couldn't help but step forward, grabbing the staff member's collar and shouting, "Say that again!"

The staff member frowned, looking at Sophie Cook's outburst with confusion.

"Ma'am, please calm down. I think you made a mistake. Not only is there no director with the last name Adams in our crew, but there's no one with that name in the entire production team!"

Sophie Cook let go of the staff member's collar, stepping back weakly, shaking her head in disbelief. "No, no! That's impossible! You're lying to me, right? Just like Olivia Stewart! You’re all liars! Director Adams told me himself that he was the assistant director in charge of reviewing behind the scenes!"

The staff member, seeing Sophie Cook's devastated expression, began to understand and looked at her with sympathy. "Ma'am, I think you've been scammed! Our head director is the only one responsible for reviews, apart from our boss. The guy you mentioned, Director Adams, sounds fake. Did you... fall for it?"

"No, no, no, I didn't! I didn't!"

Sophie Cook waved her hands frantically, stepping back before turning around and running away quickly.

The staff member watched her retreating figure, shaking his head helplessly and sighing. "Every time there's a new show casting, scammers come out with all sorts of tricks, and yet some girls always fall for it. What a pity!"

Sophie Cook dashed out of the final selection venue, almost as if she were escaping.

The midday sun shone brightly on the open square, its glare painful to her eyes.

Yet Sophie Cook felt no warmth, as if cold had seeped into her bones and her heart was frozen solid.

She hugged herself, wandering forward aimlessly.

Suddenly, a familiar voice emerged from a small shop at the corner of the square: "Here's your lunch box, that'll be ten dollars."

Sophie Cook turned her head and immediately widened her eyes.

Director Adams!

No, it was the scammer Adams!

"Stop right there, you jerk!"

Sophie Cook shrieked in anger, charging towards him.

Director Adams saw it was Sophie Cook, pocketed the shop's money, gave her a cheeky grin, and hurriedly fled.

Sophie Cook tried to chase after him. But wearing high heels, she couldn't keep up.

After just a few meters, Sophie Cook twisted her ankle and fell with a cry.

Director Adams glanced back, making a mocking face at Sophie Cook, his grin sleazy. "Hey, pretty lady, did you hurt yourself? Since you miss me so much, I'll wait for you."

Sophie Cook hurled her high heel at him. "Get lost!"

"Busy day for me, darling. I'll catch you later!"

With that, Director Adams hummed a tune, one hand in his pocket and the other swinging a plastic bag, strolling away smugly.

Sophie Cook watched helplessly as he got further away, then collapsed on the ground in frustration.

It was a long time before she managed to stand up, leaning against the wall, limping back to the small shop where she had encountered Director Adams.

The shop owner was devouring a lunch box, and upon seeing a beautiful woman standing at his door, quickly straightened up and greeted her warmly. "Good afternoon, miss! Looking to buy something? We've got plenty in store, why not come in and take a look?"

"I'm not here to buy. I just..."

The owner's expression changed immediately. "Messing with me, huh? If you're not buying, what are you doing standing there? Drumming up business? I don't have the cash for that, get lost!"

Sophie Cook's face flushed red.

"I'm sorry, I just wanted to ask, who is that guy, really?"

"Oh, you mean that old chap? He delivers lunches, that's all!"

"Delivers lunches?"

Sophie Cook stared blankly at the lunch box in the shop owner's hand. If she had held onto a sliver of hope before, it was now completely dashed.

She finally had to admit she had fallen for a scam, and the scammer was just a lunch delivery guy!

Seeing Sophie Cook staring at the lunch box, the owner tossed it in front of her. "What, you want to order from him too? I'm telling you, don't bother. It's overpriced and tastes awful, with tiny portions! Heartless, I say!"

"Do you have his name, address, and phone number?"

"Where he lives, I don't know. He's just a delivery guy. But I do have a name and number! If you don't believe me, you'll find out the hard way!"

With a look of "you're so naive," the owner scribbled something on a piece of paper and handed it to her.

Sophie Cook took it and saw "Henry Adams," followed by a phone number.

She forced a smile, trying to sound grateful. "Thanks."

The shop owner, momentarily softened, leaned closer to Sophie Cook, speaking in a conspiratorial whisper. "Hey, let me tell you a secret!"

"Hmm?"

"I overheard him on the phone the other day, saying he was delivering lunches to a film crew and posing as a crew member to trick several young actresses, especially those new to casting. They're the easiest to fool, so be careful!"

Posing as a crew member, tricking several newcomers...

Sophie Cook clenched her purse tightly, her face pale as she fled once more under the shop owner's puzzled gaze.

She ran across the square, kept running and running, not caring when her high heels slipped off. Her twisted ankle was swollen, but she felt no pain!

She didn't know how long she ran or how many streets she had crossed until she couldn't muster another ounce of strength, finally collapsing against a weathered old wall, panting heavily.

The surroundings were eerily quiet, not a soul in sight.

Sophie Cook covered her face with her hands, slowly crouching down, a long, thin wail escaping her lips, like the mournful cry of a trapped animal.

Tricked by a lunch delivery guy, really, fate? Is this my punishment?

All I wanted was a chance to make something of myself. What's wrong with that? How is that a crime?

If Olivia Stewart, a mere coffee runner, can snag a rich boyfriend, why can't I? Why am I stuck with such awful luck?

Why is life so unfair?

Sophie Cook sat on the ground, crying until the world seemed to turn upside down.

She had always been the apple of her parents' eye, never faced much adversity, and whatever she wanted, her parents would make Olivia Stewart give it up, even if she wanted it for herself.

After their parents passed away, even though she was still young, her sister did everything to take care of her, allowing her to act spoiled and throw tantrums, to seek comfort in Olivia Stewart's warm embrace.

But now, she had broken Olivia Stewart's heart, and her sister wouldn't care for her anymore.

Betrayed and hurt, she could only hide in the shadows, crying alone.

After a long time, Sophie Cook finally stopped crying, wiped her tears, and stood up. Her eyes were swollen, but she felt calmer.

She took out the crumpled piece of paper from her purse, unfolded it, and with trembling fingers, dialed the number on her phone, entering each digit slowly.

"Beep... beep..."

As she waited, Sophie Cook's heart raced.

"Hello, where are you calling from? Ordering food?"

The gruff voice came through the phone, loud enough to make Sophie Cook's eardrums throb.

It was that devil's voice!

Sophie Cook gritted her teeth. "Henry Adams, you jerk!"

There was a pause, followed by a chuckle. "Who’s this pretty lady? Sorry, I’m so busy, I can’t remember."

"My name is Sophie Cook!"

"Oh—"

Henry Adams drew out his response, making Sophie Cook's blood boil. She shouted into the phone, "Henry Adams, you scoundrel! I'm reporting you! I'm taking you to court! I'm sending you to jail!"

"Really? Hahaha..."

Henry Adams didn't sound the least bit scared, laughing openly instead.

"Sweet Sophie Cook, aren’t you a bit naive? Want to sue me? Go ahead! Need me to spot you ten bucks for a cab fare? But think carefully, the moment you step into the police station, maybe the next second, your high-definition photoshoot will go viral online."

"What do you mean?"

Sophie Cook's forehead, back, and palms were all clammy with cold sweat, her body weak as if she couldn’t hold the phone.

"I was planning to check in with you later this week, but since you called, I might as well tell you. Remember the fun you had with those guys in the bar's private room? I was there watching the whole time. It was boring, so I shot some videos to entertain myself later!"

"Henry Adams! You sleazy, filthy creep! I'll fight you!"

"Sure, come on over! Right now! Or else, while watching the video, I might accidentally hit send, and once it’s online, it'll blow up with clicks!" Henry Adams chuckled.

"No! Don’t do it! Give me the videos!" Sophie Cook panicked.

"Depends on how you perform tonight." Henry Adams threatened.

"Fine, I'll go!" Sophie Cook agreed without hesitation.

"Good girl. I'll text you the address. Come over early and behave, or you know the consequences!" Henry Adams warned ominously.

"I understand, just don’t upload the videos!" Sophie Cook pleaded.

After hanging up, Sophie Cook’s phone slipped from her hand, hitting the ground with a thud.

"Buzz..."

The phone vibrated softly, the screen lighting up with a text notification.

Sophie Cook picked it up and saw the address from Henry Adams. She knew the place, a notorious slum known as No Man's Land.

What good could come of going there?

But if she didn't go, would she just let those videos be uploaded online and ruin her reputation?

Weighing her options, Sophie Cook resigned herself to the inevitable and prepared to head to the slum that night.
