Olivia Stewart's First On-Screen Kiss

"No way, I'm too busy!"

Ugh, you jerk.

Olivia Stewart pouted, got out of the car, and slammed the door shut without looking back.

Isabella Peterson watched her storm off and chuckled to herself. That little firecracker might be tiny, but her temper sure was growing!

Once Olivia disappeared around the corner, Amy Green pulled up in Isabella's luxury RV. She was wearing a flashy, eye-catching red blouse and waved with a mischievous grin. "Hey, boss!"

Isabella parked her sports car in the shade and hopped into the RV.

Half an hour later, the superstar heartthrob Tianyi showed up on set, with his usual mix of pride and aloofness.

Olivia was the first to greet him with a sweet smile. "Hey, Tianyi! Long time no see!"

Tianyi's usually distant face softened into a smile when he saw Olivia. "Yeah, it's been ages." Thirty whole minutes, to be exact!

"Hello, superstar!"

"Tianyi!"

The rest of the crew flocked around him, quickly leaving Olivia on the sidelines. But they all knew better than to get too close, respecting Tianyi's personal space.

Lisa, who had broken her leg during a stunt, was back on set in her high-tech wheelchair. Hearing Tianyi was back, she couldn't wait to return to work. Fortunately, most of her scenes involved sitting, so it wasn't too much of an issue.

Olivia and Lisa exchanged knowing smiles when they met.

Olivia slipped away from the crowd to find a quiet spot, only to spot Sophie Cook waltzing in from the entrance, looking stunning in an elegant dress with a perfectly made-up face.

Olivia was taken aback and rushed over. "Sophie, didn't I get you some time off? Why are you here?"

"Well, sis, I just wanted to act! Staying home is so boring!" Sophie clung to Olivia's arm, acting as affectionate as ever.

"But your face..." Olivia frowned at the heavy makeup Sophie wore. "Weren't you told to avoid cosmetics? It takes time for your skin to heal, and this might make it worse!"

Oh, please. You just want to hog all the spotlight yourself, don't you? You'd love it if I went barefaced and got laughed at!

Sophie quickly hid a flash of resentment behind a charming smile.

Holding Olivia's arm, she whined, "Oh, sis, I just want to look pretty! I know you said it might get better, but the chances are slim, and good makeup covers it well, right?"

Olivia took a closer look at Sophie. Despite the heavy makeup, it wasn't too noticeable. Honestly, Olivia wasn't sure if Sophie's scars would ever fully heal, so maybe this was for the best.

She sighed, patting Sophie's hand. "I'm sorry for what happened. If you're okay with it, that's fine. Isabella brought back loads of makeup from abroad, and I'll give you some to try."

Sophie beamed, delighted. "That's awesome!"

Knowing Isabella's gifts were top-notch, Sophie couldn't be happier.

Seeing her so joyful, Olivia felt a pang of guilt. Her voice wavered slightly, "Sophie, I'm really sorry I couldn't take better care of you."

"No, no! Don't worry about it, sis," Sophie replied cheerfully. "Just keep this a secret, okay? And maybe help me get closer to Tianyi!"

"Sure!" Olivia promised earnestly. "I'll figure something out for you."

Just as they finished talking, Director Wang announced it was time to start filming. After such a long break, everyone was a bit rusty, and several scenes had to be re-shot multiple times.

Director Wang, like a firecracker ready to explode, yelled at everyone in sight.

Olivia sat on the sidelines, clutching her script and reading intently. Her big, bright eyes were glued to the pages, her long lashes fluttering like feathers, revealing her inner tension.

The next scene was straightforward, but it involved a kiss with Tianyi. Olivia's heart raced. It was her first intimate scene on-screen, and she couldn't help but feel nervous.

Though fake kisses were no big deal, Tianyi had declared in front of reporters and fans that he'd do all his scenes personally, no body doubles or camera tricks. So, what if he really kissed her?

Tianyi lounged nearby, chewing lemon-flavored gum, his dark eyes never leaving Olivia's face. He knew what she was worried about, but he enjoyed watching her squirm.

Her expressions as she frowned and nibbled her lip were simply adorable! He couldn't wait to see how she'd act during the scene.

Finally, Director Wang's voice boomed through the loudspeaker, "Scene 156, Quian and Bai's intimate moment, get ready!"

Olivia's heart skipped a beat. She jumped up, dropping her script.

Tianyi stood and casually picked up the script, handing it back to her with a smirk. "Am I that scary?"

Olivia's face flushed with embarrassment as she avoided his gaze. "No, I'm just a bit nervous!"

"Don't worry! Relax!" Tianyi patted her back and leaned in, whispering, "I won't bite, promise!"

His breath so close, that husky voice, those teasing words made Olivia's face even hotter, her heart pounding.

Who knew the usually gentlemanly Tianyi could be so cheeky?

This side of him reminded her of Isabella, making her even more flustered.

With a deep breath, Olivia finally calmed her racing heart and stepped onto the set.

Her first on-screen kiss began.

Soft, romantic music played, the lights dimmed, and candlelight flickered in the quiet room. Sparks seemed to dance in the air.

In the scene, Quian and Bai gazed into each other's eyes, their looks filled with a sweet emotion that rivaled any love song.

Tianyi's deep blue eyes seemed to hold a mesmerizing magic, drawing Olivia into the moment.

He saw her get lost in his gaze, and as he leaned in, his lips inching towards hers, the whole room held its breath.

This was unbelievable!

The notoriously germophobic superstar was really going to kiss Olivia!

Even though everyone was a bit envious, they had to admit it was a beautifully romantic scene.

Sophie watched from the shadows, her eyes filled with malice, like a witch casting a curse.

On set, Quian's lips lightly touched Bai's, like a butterfly landing on a flower.

The warm sensation made Olivia's lashes flutter.

Just as Tianyi was about to deepen the kiss, Olivia turned her head slightly, and his lips brushed her cheek instead.

Time seemed to stop.

Everyone stared at Olivia, stunned.

A few seconds later, the room erupted in disbelief and anger!

Olivia Stewart had just turned down Tianyi's "first kiss!"

How could she refuse him?

Even if she didn't want it, she could have given someone else the chance!

What a clueless, naive fool!

Director Wang, furious, marched over to Olivia, pointing his finger at her. "What was that all about?"

"I..." Olivia lowered her head, embarrassed. "I'm sorry!"

Tianyi folded his arms, thoughtfully watching Olivia, his blue eyes filled with an amused smile. "How about we try again?"

Olivia blushed even more, biting her lip, and after a moment's hesitation, asked quietly, "Tianyi, can we... fake it?"

Tianyi's eyes twinkled with laughter as he teased, "What? You don't want to act out the scene with me? Am I that bad?"

"No, no!" Olivia waved her hands. "I'm just..."

Tianyi cut her off, "If it's not that, then you're just nervous? Don't worry, we'll get it right after a few tries. I don't mind!"

But I do, darn it!

Olivia almost wanted to kneel and beg for mercy.

Seeing her tangled expression, Tianyi felt a sense of satisfaction. His eyes sparkled with mischief as he leaned in and playfully tugged on Olivia's hair, teasing her, "If you're having trouble, maybe you should try taking the lead this time?"
