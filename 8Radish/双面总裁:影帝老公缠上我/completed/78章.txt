Olivia Stewart was having one of those days where everything seemed to go wrong. She was supposed to be there to support her little sister, Sophie Cook, who was auditioning for a role in a new TV series. But somehow, the production crew thought Olivia was the one auditioning.

A serious-looking crew member approached Olivia with a costume in hand. "I'm just following orders," he said, "and I was told to give this to Olivia Stewart. You're her, right?"

Olivia nodded, confused. "Yeah, that's me. But it's my sister Sophie who's auditioning for the nurse role. Shouldn't this be for her?"

The crew member smiled slightly. "I'm not sure about the specifics. I'm just following instructions to get you into the outfit for an audition."

Both sisters exclaimed in unison, "Audition?" Their eyes widened as they looked at each other, dumbfounded.

"There's been a mistake!" Sophie shouted. "Please, sir, could you double-check?" Olivia asked, trying to keep her cool.

"Of course," the crew member replied, handing the nurse outfit to Olivia and heading back into the studio.

Sophie watched the outfit with a mix of longing and frustration, twisting her fingers anxiously. Olivia tried to hand it to her, reassuringly saying, "Don't worry! They must have mixed something up. I'm sure they meant you, Sophie."

"Take it away! I don't want it!" Sophie snapped, turning away but then stealing a glance at the outfit again.

"Is this why you've been so eager to teach me how to take care of patients? You were just waiting for a chance like this, weren't you?" Sophie accused, thinking she had seen through Olivia's supposed facade.

"Sophie, that's not fair! You asked for my help, remember?" Olivia felt a pang of injustice.

"Whatever! If you planned this to steal the spotlight, then you're no sister of mine!" Sophie retorted, dismissing Olivia's feelings.

Olivia's expression hardened. "Sophie, believe it or not, I never intended to take your place. You're upset now, and I won't hold it against you. But you're not a child anymore. You should know where to draw the line. I can be patient, but I'm not a doormat. My feelings aren't made of stone. When you keep cutting into them, it hurts!"

Sophie remained silent, biting her lip, tears brimming in her eyes. Olivia sighed, feeling like she might have been too harsh, but Sophie had been acting so strange lately. 

The tension in the room was palpable until the crew member returned. "We've confirmed it, Miss Olivia Stewart. Please follow me."

Olivia glanced at Sophie, whose face had gone pale, tears silently streaming down her cheeks. Olivia felt a pang of sympathy and asked, "What about my sister?"

"She can wait in the lounge with the other finalists," the crew member replied.

Olivia hesitated, "Can I ask why? I didn't sign up for this. I have no acting background. If it's because you saw me working earlier, I was just helping out. If there's an opportunity, I'd rather give it to my sister. She's trained in acting."

"No need for your fake kindness!" Sophie yelled, but her eyes betrayed a yearning she couldn't hide.

"I'm serious, Sophie. I think you'd be perfect for this. Whether you believe me or not, I want you to have this chance," Olivia said sincerely, her gaze so honest that Sophie couldn't maintain eye contact.

Olivia had always been willing to give Sophie whatever she wanted, even things Olivia herself cherished. It was a habit Sophie couldn't kickâ€”wanting what Olivia had.

Olivia turned to the crew member with determination. "Let my sister go in my place."

The crew member adjusted his glasses, a bit flustered. "I'm afraid that's not possible."

Olivia tossed the outfit back at him. "Then I'm not doing it either. I quit."

The crew member was momentarily stunned, then chuckled. "Miss Olivia Stewart, there's been a misunderstanding. We want you to demonstrate for the other candidates, not to compete."

"Demonstrate?" Olivia asked, puzzled.

"Yes, the lead role is a nurse, and none of the candidates have any experience. The director saw your skills and thought you'd be perfect to show them how it's done."

"Why didn't you say so earlier?" Olivia exclaimed, relief washing over her. She turned to Sophie, "Take a break and relax. You'll do great when it's your turn. I'll handle this."

Inside the studio, Isabella Peterson, the executive producer, watched through the monitors. Her presence exuded an aura of elegance and mystery, her fingers tapping the armrest rhythmically, betraying a hint of impatience.

As Olivia appeared on screen in her pink nurse outfit, Isabella's eyes lit up. Her Olivia looked stunning, even more so than anyone else.

Olivia felt a bit awkward under the scrutiny, knowing she had to perform in front of the crew. The assistant director quickly briefed her on the scene, and with Olivia's natural grace, she began her demonstration.

But Isabella interrupted with a commanding, "Stop!" The director promptly halted the scene.

"Is something wrong with her performance?" the director asked cautiously.

"Get the guy playing the patient out of there!" Isabella demanded, her voice icy.

"Right away, Isabella," the director replied, not understanding the reasoning but eager to comply. Little did he know, Isabella's jealousy was the driving force. No one else should receive care from Olivia, even in a fictional setting.

Isabella adjusted her tie, issuing another command, "Move on to the next scene with the check exchange."

"Yes, Isabella!" the director responded, rallying the crew.

Olivia, confused by the abrupt stop, was about to leave when the assistant director stopped her. "We're moving to the next scene."

"Why? I thought I was just here to demonstrate basic care techniques. What's the next scene for? I'm not an actress!"

The assistant director chuckled. "You're an unusual one. Most people would jump at this chance. What's one more scene? Think of it as a fun experience."

"Well, when you put it that way," Olivia said, relaxing. "I guess I can give it a shot!"
