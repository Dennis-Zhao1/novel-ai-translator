Sophie Cook's Ordeal

Standing at the door of the VIP lounge, Sophie Cook took a deep breath. She put on what she believed was a flawless smile and knocked confidently. "Knock, knock..."

Director Adams opened the door and his eyes lit up upon seeing Sophie. His plump hand gestured for her to come in. "Come on in, Sophie!"

As she stepped inside, Sophie noticed a few men lounging on the sofas, their expressions obscured by the dim lighting. But their gazes were unmistakable—hungry wolves eyeing prey.

Sophie took another deep breath and offered a polite bow. "Hello, everyone! I'm Sophie Cook!"

Her voice was sweet, and as she bent forward slightly, she unintentionally presented a view that made the men stare, some even wiping their noses to hide their excitement.

"Ahem..." Director Adams cleared his throat loudly.

The men snapped back to their senses, sitting up straight and feigning politeness. "Hello, hello!"

"Olivia Stewart truly lives up to her reputation, such a stunning beauty," one of them remarked.

"Indeed, a rare gem like Olivia Stewart is hard to come by these days. Surely, she's perfect for the lead role this time!"

Flattered by the compliments, Sophie beamed, letting go of her lingering nervousness and caution.

Director Adams guided Sophie to the sofa. "Miss Cook, have a seat. Let me introduce you to the producers of our new show. They're the ones who make everything happen. As a newcomer, you usually don't get the chance to meet such important figures. Make sure to give them a good impression!"

As he spoke, Adams took Sophie's delicate hand in his, patting it lightly. The implication was clear.

Slightly shy, Sophie nodded and poured herself a drink. With a charming smile, she said, "Thank you, Director Adams, for the introduction. I'm new here, and I hope to learn from all of you. Cheers!"

Watching Sophie down her drink, Director Adams and the men exchanged knowing glances, their smiles laced with calculation.

This young lady was turning out to be easier to handle than they expected!

After a few drinks, Sophie started to feel lightheaded. Director Adams quickly introduced her to everyone: "This is Prince Lou, from a family in the jewelry business. This is Mr. Chu, a financial magnate. And this is Mr. Zhang, who owns dozens of fashion brands..."

Each one was a big name, and Sophie smiled, toasting each in turn, hoping to win their favor.

After making the rounds, Sophie's head was spinning, and her vision blurred. She couldn't help but comment, "This drink packs quite a punch!"

"That's what makes it fun!" Mr. Zhang chimed in, offering her another drink while his hand slid towards her collar.

The other men followed suit, offering drinks and making moves.

"You're all such bad guys!" Sophie playfully scolded, her face flushed with a tipsy grin, more inviting than rejecting.

The men, sensing an opportunity, surged forward eagerly.

"Ahem, ahem..." Director Adams coughed loudly again.

The "gentlemen" paused, exchanging looks, and resumed their flattery and drink-pouring.

Soon, Sophie was slumped in the corner, passed out.

The men sidled up to her, barely containing their anticipation.

Director Adams checked on Sophie, ensuring she was out cold, then turned to the men, displeased. "What are you all rushing for? Almost broke protocol!"

The men scratched their heads sheepishly. "Sorry, Adams, it's been a while since we've seen such a fresh face. Couldn't help it..."

"Usual rules, highest bidder first, the rest wait!"

"I'll bid a thousand!"

"Two thousand!"

"Two thousand five hundred!"

And so, the men began bidding next to the unconscious Sophie.

Director Adams watched, eyes narrowing with satisfaction.

The night was still young, and the closed door hid the madness within.

Hours later...

"Miss, please wake up!"

A waiter fanned his hand in front of his nose, trying to rouse Sophie. His expression was one of disdain.

This girl, so young, yet playing so recklessly!

Sophie slowly came to, her body aching as if she'd been hit by a truck. She groaned softly, "Ugh..."

The waiter frowned at her. "Miss, your time in the lounge is up. Would you like to settle the bill or extend your stay?"

Still groggy, Sophie glanced around, piecing together what happened. "Where did everyone go?"

The waiter stood aside, his tone icy. "When I came in, you were the only one here. Are you settling the bill or extending your time?"

Struggling to sit up, Sophie noticed the mess on the sofa. Realizing her disheveled state, she hastily covered herself. "Get out!"

The waiter sneered, leaving, but not before poking his head back in. "If you're not extending, please hurry up!"

What happened? Where did they all go?

Sophie rubbed her forehead, searching for her purse. Opening it, she found it emptied, save for a note.

She unfolded the note, the handwriting jagged and messy: "The gentlemen had other engagements, so we left first. In our haste, we forgot our wallets. Borrowed some of yours. We'll give you top marks in the finals."

At this point, anyone with half a brain would realize: she'd been duped!

Yet, in her desperation to land the role, Sophie hesitated only briefly when she saw her empty wallet. The note's promise, "top marks in the finals," dangled like a tempting carrot, blinding her to reality.

With no money, Sophie sat, troubled.

Ugh, these people! Not even covering the lounge fees? So shameless!

But then again, they're producers, people everyone tries to impress. Why would they pay?

Director Adams said they had other matters—could the other candidates be trying to win them over too?

The thought made Sophie anxious rather than angry. She stood, her legs buckling beneath her, collapsing back onto the sofa.

Despite knowing what she'd endured, her concern was: Did those gentlemen find her satisfactory? Would they abandon her for someone more appealing?

"Knock, knock..."

The waiter's impatient knock echoed from outside.

"Extend another hour!" Sophie shouted back.

The knocking stopped.

Penniless, with her dress torn, she couldn't leave like this. What to do?

Call Olivia Stewart for money!

The thought popped into Sophie's mind automatically.

No, no, letting her see this mess would be humiliating! And why give her the satisfaction?

Sophie considered her options, calling her usual group of friends.

"Hey, it's 4 AM! Why are you even awake? Need money? You're kidding, right? I'm wiped out. Later!"

"Sophie? What? Bring cash? You know I'm short right now. Sorry, bye!"

Call after call, no one was willing to help, some not even picking up.

Those jerks!

Furious, Sophie hurled her phone.

They partied on her dime, calling her "sis," but disappeared when she needed them!

Left with no choice, Sophie hesitantly texted Olivia Stewart: "Sis, can you send me $2000 urgently?"

Seconds later, "ding!"

Sophie checked her phone, eyes widening in surprise. Olivia had sent $10,000 via WhatsApp!

Wow, snagged a rich one, huh?

A text from Olivia followed: "Is that enough? Are you in trouble?"

Seeing the message, a wave of emotion washed over Sophie, her eyes tearing up.

She sniffed, hastily replying, "I'm fine, just need some last-minute stuff for the audition."

"Good to hear. Why are you up so late? It's great to prepare, but don't overdo it! I've asked him to help with your audition. No pressure, get some rest!"

Sophie couldn't hold back her tears, letting them fall onto her phone.

Sprawling across the couch, she sobbed, "Sis..."

Half an hour later, Sophie composed herself, paid the lounge fee via WhatsApp, and left.

She shot the waiter a cold glance, striding out with her head held high.

That's her motto: Even when life knocks you down, carry yourself like a proud swan.
