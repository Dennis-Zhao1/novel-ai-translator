Chapter 1: A Castle Full of Drama

It was one of those sunny days, and Isabella Peterson, with a smirk plastered on her face, decided it was time to whisk Olivia Stewart back to the castle. Ignoring any discussion about Daniel Johnson, Isabella simply scooped Olivia up and started walking.

“Isabella, I can walk by myself!” Olivia protested, her cheeks flushing with a bit of embarrassment as the townspeople watched.

“Oh, sure,” Isabella replied, rolling her eyes. “And if you scrape your knee and it leaves a scar, who’s going to pay for that, huh?”

“Isabella, how obsessed are you with my looks? If I turn into some monster, are you planning to ignore me for the rest of your life?”

“Not at all,” Isabella grinned.

“Then why do you care so much about every little scar?”

Isabella paused, meeting Olivia’s gaze with a serious expression. “If you got a scar, I could handle it. But could you?”

“What do you mean?”

“Isn’t it said that women love beauty?”

Olivia was taken aback, realizing that Isabella was being so careful for her sake. It was like a sweet piece of cotton candy melting into her heart.

As they reached the sun-dappled path leading to the castle, Olivia wrapped her arms around Isabella’s neck, resting her head on Isabella’s chest. The light filtering through the leaves painted patterns around them, filling Olivia’s world with happiness.

As for Alyssa, despite everything, Olivia couldn't bring herself to be too harsh. After ensuring Alyssa faced enough repercussions, she had a doctor treat her injuries. Isabella had initially wanted to deal with Alyssa more severely, but Olivia’s insistence prevailed, leading to Alyssa’s banishment from the estate.

After the Alyssa incident, the entire staff at the estate treated Olivia with newfound respect, some even going out of their way to avoid her. But Olivia sat on the couch, running her fingers over a coffee cup, her mood a bit downcast.

“Lucas, do you think I was too hard on Alyssa?” she asked the butler, Lucas Wright.

Lucas shook his head. “Olivia, you did the right thing. As the lady of the house, you have to establish your authority. Someday, when you return to manage the vast Peterson Group, you’ll need to be even more decisive.”

Olivia sighed. “Lucas, I’m not sure how long I’ll be by Isabella’s side. Maybe until the real lady of the house shows up?”

“Are you still having trouble accepting your role as Olivia Stewart?” Lucas asked seriously.

“It’s not that I can’t accept it. It’s just… imagine another person’s identity that you have no connection to. Would you accept it?”

“So there’s a conflict in your heart about staying with Isabella?”

“Yes, there is,” Olivia admitted honestly.

Isabella, who was descending the spiral staircase, overheard the conversation and paused, a thoughtful look crossing her face before he turned back upstairs.

Olivia’s allergies soon cleared up, but the red spots took a few more days to fade. Lucas personally monitored her diet, banning anything with color to prevent scarring. By the second day, Olivia was fed up.

“I want a duck leg!” she whined. “And cola chicken wings!”

The sight of yet another meal of steamed chicken, duck, and fish made her want to flip the table.

“Isabella, I’m fine now! Look!” Olivia rolled up her sleeve to show Isabella her arm, now mostly clear of the rash.

Isabella’s eyes darkened, having spent nights by her side, watching but not touching.

He placed a piece of fish on her plate. “A few more days of this won’t hurt. Today’s steamed fish is especially good!”

Olivia tossed her chopsticks down. “Steamed this, steamed that. Why don’t you just steam me?”

Isabella’s eyes twinkled with mischief. “I just might.”

Olivia, exasperated, chewed on the fish, feeling there was something off about Isabella’s words.

Later that night, Isabella finished his work and headed to Olivia’s room, only to find it locked. He knocked.

“Olivia!”

From inside, Olivia’s voice came, “Isabella, since I’m all better, you don’t need to supervise me. Go get some rest! Thanks for everything!”

This little brat! Isabella leaned against the door frame, arms crossed, his gaze on the fluttering curtains.

“Olivia, how do you plan to thank me?”

“However you want!” she replied cheekily.

Safe behind her locked door, Olivia hugged a panda plushie and rolled around her bed, laughing.

Suddenly, there was a thud.

Oh no!

She turned to see Isabella, effortlessly climbing through the window.

Darn it! She’d forgotten about the window!

Watching Isabella approach, Olivia clutched her panda, shrinking back.

“Isabella, I’m a patient! Let’s talk this through!”

“Patient?” Isabella drawled, an eyebrow raised. “Aren’t you better?”

“Yes, but… I, uh… have a visitor. Oh, my stomach!”

Isabella sat on the bed, leaning closer to Olivia, his voice a low murmur. “Darling, can you be any more convincing?”

Olivia’s face crumpled. “Isabella, I’m not faking it! I really need the bathroom!”

“Trying to escape?”

Isabella grabbed her arm, tossing her panda aside.

“But I really need to go!”

“Hold it.”

“I can’t hold it!”

Isabella tilted her chin up, his face inches from hers, his voice a seductive whisper. “How do you plan to thank me?”

Olivia’s face burned with embarrassment, her voice a shaky whisper. “Uh, another day…”

“Another day?” Isabella pressed closer, his lips brushing hers. “I can’t wait another moment!”

“Isabella, listen—”

Her words were swallowed up as she melted into his embrace, her mind a blissful blank.

Isabella’s touch was electric, and as his hand moved, Olivia’s last shred of resistance kicked in.

“Isabella, don’t…”

Isabella caught her hand, his voice firm. “Enough stalling!”

Olivia closed her eyes, mortified.

“Damn it!”

Isabella’s curse was a roar of frustration.

“Olivia Stewart!”

He spun away, kicking a chair and smashing a vase in his path, his rage like a whirlwind.

Olivia watched, frozen in her corner.

After demolishing half the room, Isabella turned, glaring at Olivia.

“Olivia Stewart!”

“I’m here.”

Her voice was small, as if afraid to provoke him further.

“Did you do this on purpose?”

“I didn’t!”

“Didn’t you? Really?”

Isabella loomed over her, his voice a challenge.

“I told you, really!”

Isabella kicked the bed frame in frustration.

“Did you really say it? Did you?”

Would he have been caught off guard if she had?

Another kick.

Olivia winced, looking from his foot to his angry face, her own flushed with embarrassment.

“I told you, my visitor came. I said another day.”

Isabella wanted to throttle her!

Visitor… what kind of nonsense was that?

Olivia meekly added, “I hinted a lot. I said my visitor came, my stomach hurt, I needed the bathroom… but you wouldn’t let me.”

Isabella thought about kicking again, but seeing Olivia’s anxious face, he stopped.

“No more hints! Be direct!”

“Weren’t you going to the bathroom? Hurry up!”

“Oh.”

Olivia slipped off the bed, darting to the bathroom.

Phew, dodged a bullet!

Emerging from the bathroom, Olivia found the room empty, Isabella gone.

She clutched her aching belly, a sigh escaping her lips.

So, when there’s no reward, he just leaves without a second thought?
