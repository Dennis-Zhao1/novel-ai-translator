The argument started over their son, and things escalated quickly. Isabella Peterson had barely finished her sentence when Olivia Stewart snapped back with a fierce shout, "You dare!"

Isabella chuckled, her lips curving into a sly grin, "You refuse to wear it and won't even let me see it? That's just unreasonable, Olivia. Either you wear it yourself, or I'll help you put it on, or maybe I'll just have someone else..."

"Fine, I'll show you!" Olivia gritted her teeth. "But don't regret it later!"

Isabella looked smug, "Regret? I don't even know how to spell that word!"

Later that night, Isabella realized Olivia's words were like a cruel joke. It was like a starving wolf facing the most delicious meal but didn't dare take a bite. Isabella was tormented well into the morning, his eyes still red from exhaustion.

The housekeeper, noticing his state, fussed over him, assuming he was sick. Isabella, with a stoic face, offered no explanation, while Olivia giggled quietly to herself.

Their two little kids were up early, being carried by the nanny, joyfully kicking their little legs and greeting everyone in their own way. Isabella quickly picked one up, playing with the child to cover up his embarrassment.

Olivia picked up the other, and the two of them entertained the kids, filling the room with warmth and laughter. "If only Tommy were here with us," Olivia sighed suddenly.

Isabella and their assistant, Lucas Wright, exchanged a silent glance. Lucas reported, "Ma'am, young master Tommy is currently receiving care. Rest assured, he's being well looked after and won't be lacking anything."

"Don't call me ma'am!" Olivia flared up. "No matter how well others care for him, can it compare to the love and warmth of family?"

Isabella's face darkened, "You're already struggling to take care of two kids. Adding a sick child..."

"How dare you call him a sick child?" Olivia exploded. "Isabella, he's your child too! You were once a sick child yourself!"

"Olivia!" Isabella's fists clenched, his voice low and harsh. Olivia's words hit a nerve. As a child, he had been sickly, suffering under his father's coldness, only to find out later that his illness was inflicted by his father himself, intending to replace him with Alexander Peterson.

Now, Olivia was fiercely protective of Alexander's child! Recalling how Olivia was kidnapped by Alexander, endured hardships, and escaped to give birth, only to immediately plead for Alexander's release, left Isabella with a bitter taste in his mouth.

Isabella's lips were pressed into a firm line, his handsome face a mask of anger. Olivia, meanwhile, hadn't realized the depth of Isabella's childhood struggles and was shocked by his disdain for Tommy. Her eyes reddened with unshed tears.

This was their first argument over the kids! The servants didn't dare intervene, keeping their heads down and their mouths shut, afraid of becoming collateral damage. Lucas knew the root of the issue but didn't dare to speak up.

He glanced at Isabella, then at Olivia, worry etched on his face. The master couldn't move past his childhood trauma, and Olivia was in the dark about it. If this continued, something would surely give!

The room fell into a tense silence, the air thick with unspoken words. Even the twins seemed to sense the oppressive atmosphere, looking at each other without a sound.

After a while, Olivia handed her child to the nanny and silently headed upstairs. As she turned, Isabella noticed a single tear glistening on her cheek.

Isabella wanted to reach out and stop her, his hand twitching at his side, but he didn't move. Watching Olivia ascend the stairs, Isabella handed his child to the nanny and walked out.

Soon, the sound of a sports car engine revving up echoed outside the castle. Olivia paused at the room's entrance, turning to look out the window. She watched as Isabella's Ferrari sped away like a black arrow.

Her heart clenched. Driving in such a state of anger was dangerous! But why did Isabella dislike Tommy so much? Was it just because he was sick? The surgery was over, and with some rest, Tommy would be just like any other child.

Was it because Tommy didn't grow up with them, leading to a lack of connection? Given all the hardships Isabella endured as a child, he should be more inclined to cherish and compensate for Tommy, just like she wanted to.

That suffocating feeling returned, and Olivia rushed back to her room, stepping onto the balcony. She took deep breaths, trying to calm her racing heart. Lately, this feeling had been occurring more often, but she hadn't told anyone.

Whenever something upset her, that oppressive feeling would settle in her chest, and she'd struggle to breathe. Deep breathing helped, though, and after a few moments, the sensation would fade.

Sure enough, after several deep breaths, Olivia's emotions settled somewhat. She figured Isabella had just made her furious.

All day, Isabella didn't return home. Olivia spent the entire day on the balcony, staring blankly outside. The suffocating feeling didn't leave, no matter how many deep breaths she took.

Suddenly, the room door was flung open from the outside. Olivia jumped, turning to see Isabella standing at the entrance, his face dark and stormy. Finally, he was back safe!

After spending the whole day on the balcony, worrying and feeling aggrieved, Olivia finally relaxed a little. But new grievances quickly rose, and her eyes turned red as she looked away.

"I heard you didn't eat all day?" Isabella's voice was cold, anger simmering beneath the surface.

"I wasn't hungry," Olivia tried to hide her tears.

"You're mad at me over that child, risking your health to spite me? Aren't you concerned about the twins?"

Isabella's fists clenched tightly, his voice as cold as ice. Olivia was taken aback, something inside her feeling like it had been torn away.

Is this how he saw her? That child... he wouldn't even say Tommy's name. Was his dislike because Tommy had been sick as a baby?

A chilling thought crept into her mind. Isabella had no reason to dislike his own child unless he believed Tommy wasn't his.

Remembering Isabella's doubts about Tommy being Alexander's, Olivia felt a shiver run down her spine. So, he never truly believed her!

Anger, disappointment, humiliationâ€”all these emotions crashed over her. Olivia bit her lip hard, refusing to let her tears fall.

Isabella watched her, her stubbornness and hurt a painful sight. His fists clenched and unclenched at his side.

Did she care so much for Alexander's child? Was it the child she cared about or the child's father? Jealousy flared within Isabella, leaving his heart scorched and barren.

"If you want him, I'll bring him back!" Isabella snapped, storming out without another word.

For several days, Olivia and Isabella kept up their cold war. The tense atmosphere in the house made the servants tread carefully, rushing through their tasks without a word.

Olivia felt trapped by her emotions, fearing their negativity would affect the twins, so she distanced herself from them.

One afternoon, Lucas approached Olivia, "Miss Olivia, young master Tommy is on his way back and should arrive this afternoon."

"Really?" Olivia's face lit up with the first genuine smile in days.

"Yes, Miss Olivia. The master arranged for his return," Lucas replied respectfully.

Since the argument, Olivia had insisted no one call her 'ma'am.' Isabella hadn't commented, but it was clear the issue had stabbed him deeply.

"What time does his flight land? I'll go to the airport to meet him!" Olivia's eyes sparkled with excitement.

Lucas, caught up in her joy, smiled too, "Three o'clock. So please, enjoy your lunch first."

"Okay. What's Isabella doing in the study? Tell him to come down for lunch!" Olivia quickly finished eating, her mind already at the airport.

Lucas was delighted, nodding eagerly, "Yes, I'll inform the master right away!"

These two stubborn souls! With Olivia reaching out, all Isabella needed to do was go with her to the airport, say something nice, and this mess could be sorted.

Lucas walked away, grinning, almost bumping into Isabella. He quickly stepped back, bowing, "Master, Miss Olivia invites you to lunch."

Lucas was skilled in navigating these situations. While he adhered to Olivia's wishes in her presence, he maintained respect by calling her 'ma'am' in front of Isabella.

Isabella, however, showed little happiness, instead scoffing coldly, "After all these days, she finally cares whether I've eaten. Who knew a man like me needed a child to get a bit of attention from a woman!"
