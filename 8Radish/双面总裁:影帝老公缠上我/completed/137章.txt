One chilly morning, Olivia Stewart found herself in a whirlwind of emotions and chaos. After a long night of tossing and turning, she was abruptly awoken by a rather unexpected and breath-stealing encounter with Isabella Peterson, who seemed to have a knack for making grand entrances.

Isabella had a way of showing up unannounced and taking control of the situation—this time, quite literally. Olivia's first instinct was to fight back, but she was quickly overwhelmed by Isabella's charm and persistence. Her heart raced, her face flushed, and all thoughts evaporated like morning mist.

As Isabella teased Olivia about missing him, the tension between them crackled like a live wire. Olivia was determined not to give in too easily, but Isabella's relentless teasing and playful banter left her feeling vulnerable and exposed.

Just when Olivia thought she could catch her breath, Isabella's attention shifted to something far more serious. Her playful demeanor vanished as she noticed a telltale sign of distress—Olivia's injury. She had been trying to hide it, but there was no concealing it from Isabella's sharp eyes.

Isabella's mood shifted from playful to protective in an instant. His touch was gentle as he inspected the wound on Olivia's back, but his eyes were fierce, filled with a storm of emotions. Olivia could see the concern etched on his face, and it made her heart ache with an unfamiliar warmth.

Isabella's anger was palpable, directed not at Olivia, but at whoever had dared to harm her. His voice, usually smooth and teasing, was now a thunderous roar. Olivia could only look on, caught between fear and gratitude for his fierce protectiveness.

In the midst of this chaos, Olivia realized something important. Despite their constant bickering and Isabella's maddening arrogance, she deeply cared for him. And as frustrated as she was, she knew Isabella felt the same way.

As Isabella's anger slowly subsided, he leaned in close, his voice softer, filled with an intensity that made Olivia's heart flutter. "Olivia, you're mine. No one gets to hurt you and get away with it."

Olivia bit her lip, unsure of how to respond. She was grateful for his concern, yet overwhelmed by the depth of his emotions. In that moment, she knew that no matter what happened next, she wouldn't be facing it alone. Isabella Peterson would make sure of that.
