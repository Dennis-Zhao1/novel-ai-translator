In the hospital's lab office, Isabella Peterson walked in with an air of authority. The department head immediately stood up, offering a respectful nod. "Isabella Peterson!" he greeted.

Isabella wasted no time. "Is the result ready?"

"Just finished. I was about to call you!" he replied, gesturing for her to sit while handing over a sealed envelope with utmost care.

Isabella's gaze barely lingered on the department head, who seemed to shrink under her indifferent stare. "Rest assured, Isabella Peterson," he stammered. "The director personally oversaw everything, and I conducted the tests myself. The results are flawless. No one else knows about this, and we promise absolute confidentiality."

With a heavy heart, Isabella focused on the envelope. She tore it open and scanned the pages quickly, landing on the section with the results. "No biological relation," it read.

This simple statement hit her like a ton of bricks. It meant that Tong Tong wasn't Olivia Stewart and Alexander Peterson's child after all. A wave of relief washed over her. The barrier between her and Olivia Stewart's love had been built on a mistake.

Her hands trembled slightly as she processed the information. But soon, her joy was overshadowed by a new concern. If Tong Tong wasn't Olivia's child, then who was his real mother? And what happened to Olivia's actual child?

This revelation could shatter the peace they had worked so hard to rebuild. Should they tell Olivia the truth and risk hurting her all over again? Isabella's initial euphoria vanished, replaced by a desire to protect Olivia from further pain.

She flipped through the rest of the results. One confirmed her lack of relation to Tong Tong, while the other verified Alexander Peterson as Tong Tong's biological father, just like it had years ago.

Tong Tong had Alexander's rare blood type, and the woman who donated blood to save him had risked everything. A sudden idea flashed in Isabella's mind. She carefully returned the documents to the envelope and left the office.

The department head saw her to the door, eager to please. "If you need anything else, just let me know!"

Isabella paused briefly at the threshold. "Thank you," she said, surprising the department head with her rare display of gratitude.

Meanwhile, in the resting room, Olivia Stewart stirred from a restless nap, troubled by nightmares about Tong Tong's condition. She glimpsed Isabella's silhouette through the door and felt a pang of anxiety.

Could something have happened to Tong Tong? She quickly followed Isabella, finding her holding the envelope as she entered another room. Olivia hesitated, then followed, only to encounter a nurse being ushered out.

The nurse, startled to see Olivia, opened her mouth to speak, but Olivia signaled for silence and slipped inside. The door was ajar, and she could hear Isabella speaking to a woman inside.

"You're awake?" Isabella's voice was gentle yet distant, the way she spoke to strangers.

"Yes," the woman replied, her voice barely audible, either from weakness or the intimidation of Isabella's presence.

"What is your relationship with Tong Tong?" Isabella asked directly, though his tone left no room for lies.

Olivia, hiding outside, listened intently. The woman had been desperate to save Tong Tong, and Olivia was burning with curiosity.

"No relation," the woman said softly, her voice steady and unemotional. "I just saw his story and felt sorry for him."

Isabella shifted the conversation. "I promised you could have anything you want for saving him. What do you want? It must be something material."

The woman let out a small laugh. "I don't need anything. If you don't mind, I'd like to work as a servant in your home."

Isabella caught her off guard with a sudden question. "What's your connection to Alexander Peterson?"

The woman's face went pale. Isabella lifted the envelope, voice cold and commanding. "I've done a DNA test for Tong Tong. I appreciate what you've done for him, but I need the truth. I don't have the patience for games."

The woman bit her lip. "I'm... his mother."

A loud crash came from outside. Isabella rushed out to find Olivia stumbling over a chair, pale as a ghost.

"Olivia!" Isabella helped her up, his eyes searching her face for signs of distress. "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine," Olivia said, brushing him off and limping into the room. There was no point in hiding now; she wanted answers. "I want to know what you mean by 'I'm his mother'!"

The woman lowered her eyes, murmuring an apology. "I'm sorry."

"I don't want apologies. I want the truth!" Olivia demanded.

The woman took a breath and spoke clearly. "I am Tong Tong's biological mother."

Olivia's world spun as she tried to process the revelation. "Then who am I?"

"Olivia, calm down," Isabella urged, holding her steady.

"No!" Olivia struggled. "She's trying to take my child. How can I be calm?"

Isabella's voice was firm. "Olivia, Tong Tong isn't your child. She's telling the truth."

Olivia stared at Isabella, her mind reeling. "What are you saying? This has to be a joke!"

With a pained expression, Isabella handed her the documents. "I wanted to sort this out before telling you, but now you know. Tong Tong isn't oursâ€”he's neither yours nor mine."

Olivia flipped through the papers, reading "No biological relation" over and over. "How can this be? Whose child is Tong Tong?"

Isabella glanced at the weak woman receiving IV fluids. "He's likely Alexander's and hers. Alexander's test confirmed it, and hers is being processed."

Olivia looked from the papers to the woman, her voice full of disbelief. "Is this true? Are you really his mother?"

The woman nodded, shamefaced. "I'm sorry."

Olivia sank back, overwhelmed. Isabella pulled her close, reassuring her with quiet strength. "Olivia, if you love him, Tong Tong will always be ours. No one can change that."

After a moment, Olivia found her voice. "What happened? I need to understand."

"My name is Ah Xia," the woman began, her voice tinged with nostalgia. "I used to work at a club as a hostess. That's where I met Alexander."

She paused, a sad smile tugging at her lips. "He often came to drink alone, always choosing me as his companion. The other girls teased me about landing a rich guy, and seeing his gentle eyes, I thought he might care for me a little."

Ah Xia's eyes glazed over, lost in the memory. "Even though I knew we were worlds apart, I fell for him. When I got pregnant, I thought it would be a happy surprise. But he laughed at me, said a club hostess trying to trap him with a baby was foolish because no man would believe it."
