Title: The Charmer's Dilemma

---

"With a face like mine, if you don't find yourself thinking twice, there's definitely something wrong with you!" Isabella Peterson declared with a self-satisfied grin.

"..."

Olivia Stewart could practically picture a flock of crows flying over her head in disbelief.

Geez!

The one with the problem here is you, you narcissist!

"Lift your head!" Isabella commanded, her tone imperious as ever. "Admit you find me irresistible. There's no shame in it. Why are you acting like a groundhog with your head buried?"

"..." No shame? More like mortifying!

With no other choice, Olivia Stewart lifted her head slightly.

"More!" Isabella was still unsatisfied, directing her with authority. "You aren't lowering your head because you're imagining more than just my face, are you?"

Oh my gosh!

Absolutely not!

Desperate to clear her name, Olivia Stewart immediately raised her head, her cheeks puffed with indignation, her eyes glaring at Isabella.

Isabella's eyes twinkled with amusement. It was rare to see Olivia so flustered, and it was thoroughly entertaining!

Especially seeing her so embarrassed and awkward—it was enough to make anyone want to tease her more.

Isabella leaned in closer to Olivia, whispering softly in her ear, "If you want something, say it. Understand?"

His voice was deep and magnetic, each word like a gentle tap on Olivia's already racing heart.

Olivia's heartbeat went haywire again, her gaze shyly darting away.

What was happening to her?

How could she still feel this way after being around Isabella for so long?

This was ridiculous!

Why did she have to be such a sucker for a pretty face? He was definitely using his charm to dazzle her, for sure!

Watching Olivia's changing expressions, Isabella lightly stroked her delicate chin with his thumb, sending another shiver through her. Olivia pressed her back against the wall, weakly protesting, "Isabella, you... you scoundrel!"

"Am I really that bad, huh?" Isabella's brows arched high, his dark eyes gleaming mischievously.

He reached out, his hand cupping Olivia's pointed chin, and his elegant fingers traced her jawline, moving slowly from her chin to her cheeks. Gently, repeatedly.

Isabella, despite his immense wealth, wasn't one to pamper himself excessively. His hands were well-shaped, but unlike those of idle rich kids, his fingers were slightly rougher.

This slight roughness was sheer torment for Olivia when brushed against her tender cheeks.

Not to mention, Isabella was so close, his familiar, pure masculine scent enveloping her, invading her senses, and slowly eroding her thoughts.

Olivia's breath grew more erratic, her body slumping against the wall, "Isabella, stop it!"

"Then what should I do? Like this? Or like this, hmm?"

"Isabella!"

Olivia scolded, both shy and annoyed, trying to swat away his teasing hands, flustered and nearly defeated.

This kind of questioning was worse than any cold interrogation!

She couldn't understand how a simple explanation about getting her lip bitten by Ethan King had escalated to this point.

Was this Isabella's way of punishing her?

The thought made Olivia panic. She quickly grabbed Isabella's hand, pleading, "Isabella, stop, I'm sorry!"

Isabella, seeing Olivia breathless and exhausted, stopped. He placed one hand on the wall beside her, trapping her between himself and the wall, looking down at her.

His gaze lingered on Olivia's clean, delicate face, then on her slightly swollen lips, his dark eyes deepening with a hidden current.

He leaned in, his face nearing Olivia's soft lips.

Earlier on set, his fierce kiss had been too intense, accidentally biting her lip. Tonight, he planned to cherish this little thing properly!

Just as Isabella's lips were about to meet Olivia's, she suddenly turned her head, covering his mouth with her hand, "Don't bite me!"

This little buzzkill!

Isabella was left speechless and frustrated.

He just wanted to cherish her, not bite her!

Olivia peeked at Isabella, trembling, "My lip is already hurt, please, don't make it worse! If you really want to punish me, can we save it for later, maybe tomorrow?"

"Fool!" Isabella couldn't help but chuckle, gently tapping Olivia's nose, his voice softening, "I just want to make you feel better, that's all."

Isabella, usually so domineering and assertive, suddenly being gentle threw Olivia off balance even more.

Though he could be tender in private, when it came to her interactions with other men, he was incredibly possessive, never forgiving!

He'd given her a hard time just for having dinner with Ethan King. Now, hearing she'd been kissed by Ethan, he wasn't mad at all?

Impossible!

Even if Isabella's brain was fried, kicked by a mule, that wouldn't be possible!

Olivia was convinced Isabella's gentleness was just the calm before the storm, making her even more anxious.

"Isabella, wait, listen to me!"

Olivia once again covered Isabella's mouth, not daring to let go.

"This whole thing was just an accident! I don't know what got into Ethan today, he just, just..."

Olivia wanted to say she was kissed unexpectedly, but fearing Isabella would confront Ethan, causing a scandal, she quickly changed her tune, "It was just because my acting was off, and we had to do many takes. Ethan got a bit annoyed and so, during the shoot, he got a bit forceful, aiming for realism, and ended up hurting my lip."

Isabella's eyes flickered with annoyance and concern. He gently touched Olivia's lip, "Does it still hurt?"

"No... it still hurts." Olivia changed her mind midway. If she said it didn't hurt, would he make it worse?

He hadn't blown up yet, but something was off with him tonight!

Olivia's small frame shivered. If she wasn't leaning against the wall, she might have collapsed.

This little thing!

Isabella smiled indulgently, removing Olivia's hand from his mouth, leaning in again like a tender-hearted prince.

Olivia, however, reacted like she was under siege, turning her head, shouting, "Isabella, I'm sorry! Please, spare me!"

Isabella's smile froze, his face turning a bit grim.

Being stopped like this was not a pleasant experience!

Unable to apologize for the day's incident due to his pride, he just wanted to show her some affection, but she didn't get it?

Was he not gentle enough? Or not sincere enough?

Isabella's brows drew together, a hint of impatience crossing his face as he raised his voice, "Olivia! Don't be ungrateful! Weren't you just swooning over me? If you keep dodging, I might just take you right here!"

Olivia immediately leaned against the wall, too scared to move.

So, she liked a bit of tough love, huh?

Isabella's lips descended again, finally tasting the sweetness he'd longed for.

Olivia shivered slightly, wanting to push him away but not daring, so she nervously endured, not resisting but not reciprocating either.

Isabella held the back of Olivia's head, making her tilt her head closer to him.

His lips were warm, hers cool—a fusion of ice and fire, sparking an incredible sensation, like waves of electricity coursing through them, awakening every cell craving intimacy.

"Mmm..."

Olivia couldn't resist, soon dropping all defenses, her body melting.

Isabella's lips were hot and fervent, yet he wasn't as forceful as usual, instead, gently caressing the spot on Olivia's lip where she'd been bitten, like a soft feather, offering the most tender and affectionate comfort.

This kiss wasn't as long or passionate as before.

When they finally separated, Olivia saw Isabella's restrained expression, and guilt washed over her. She couldn't help but wrap her arms around Isabella's lean waist, burying her face in his chest, her voice muffled, "Isabella, I'm sorry!"

Isabella frowned, his hand resting on Olivia's head, gently stroking her hair, "What? Wasn't I passionate enough?"

"No, no!" Olivia shook her head quickly, looking up with tear-filled eyes, "I just feel really, really, really sorry!"

The three consecutive "reallys" made Isabella frown tighter, like a little knot had formed between his brows.

"What's going on?" Had this little girl really done something behind his back?

"Isabella, you're usually so petty, but you can forgive me, and I, I..." Olivia sniffled.

Isabella's face went blank.

What did she mean by petty? Did this girl even know how to talk properly?
