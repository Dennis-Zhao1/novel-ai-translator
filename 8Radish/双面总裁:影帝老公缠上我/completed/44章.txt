"Get out! Just let her go!" Isabella Peterson's voice echoed through the halls, a mix of anger and despair.

Olivia Stewart stood silently, feeling the weight of his words settle heavily on her shoulders. Her eyes, normally bright and lively, were now clouded with confusion and hurt. She turned away, not wanting anyone to notice the vulnerability in her expression, and tried to compose herself.

Lucas Wright, the ever-diligent housekeeper, watched her with a sympathetic gaze. "Olivia, I’m sorry about all this. It’s just... Isabella’s been through a lot."

Olivia managed a small, wistful smile. "I know, Lucas. And I know you're just trying to look out for him. But sometimes, I think it’s best if I just step back."

Lucas nodded, understanding the complexity of the situation. "He’s been trying to protect himself ever since his surgery. You know how hard he fought to get healthy again after everything that happened."

"Yeah, I get it," Olivia whispered, more to herself than to Lucas. She glanced back at the grand, glowing castle behind them, its opulence almost mocking in the face of such emotional turmoil. "I just wish things could be different."

"As do I, Olivia," Lucas agreed, his voice tinged with sadness. "But maybe with some time, things will change."

As Olivia turned to leave, Lucas promised to arrange a car for her. "Don't worry, I'll make sure you get home safely."

The drive back was quiet, with only the hum of the engine and the occasional soft rustle of trees in the night breeze to keep Olivia company. Her mind replayed Isabella's words over and over, each repetition twisting the metaphorical knife a little deeper.

Upon reaching her apartment, she stepped out of the car and gave Lucas one last grateful nod. "Take care of him, Lucas. He needs someone who truly understands him."

Lucas watched her go, feeling a deep sense of worry and helplessness. As he drove back, he couldn't help but wonder how these two had managed to get themselves into such a tangled mess.

Back at the castle, Isabella Peterson finally woke from his restless sleep, the events of the previous night lingering in his mind like a stubborn shadow. "What happened?" he mumbled, rubbing his temples.

Lucas entered the room with a steaming cup of tea. "You had a bit too much to drink last night, sir. Would you like something to eat? The kitchen has prepared some soup for you."

Isabella shook his head, trying to piece together the fragments of his memory. "Where’s Olivia?"

"She went home last night, sir. You told her to go," Lucas explained cautiously.

"I did?" Isabella's face fell, his confusion evident. "I don’t remember."

"Would you like me to bring her back?" Lucas offered gently.

Isabella hesitated, then shook his head. "No, it’s fine. Just... leave me be for a while."

Lucas bowed slightly and left the room, casting one last worried glance at Isabella before closing the door. As he walked away, he couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of concern for the young man he had watched grow up, hoping that somehow, things would eventually come together for both him and Olivia.
