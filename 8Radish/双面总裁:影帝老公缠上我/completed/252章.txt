As the evening breeze rustled through the palm trees, Olivia Stewart stood facing the enigmatic and poised Isabella Peterson. Their eyes met, and for a moment, the tension of the day seemed to melt away. Olivia couldn't help but chuckle at Isabella's serious demeanor, "You got here fast!" she remarked, waving her hand playfully.

Isabella, however, wasn't in the mood for pleasantries. His voice carried a chill as he simply said, "Let's go."

Olivia shrugged and turned to the gentle and wise Mrs. Fu Rong, "Sorry about that, Mrs. Fu. He's always been a bit of a diva."

Mrs. Fu smiled warmly, "It's alright, Olivia. You two go on ahead. I'm just a short walk from home."

Olivia nodded, though she hesitated, glancing back at Isabella's stern expression. "Okay then, Mrs. Fu, see you later!"

As she floated over to Isabella's side like a butterfly, she tilted her head and asked, "Didn't your mom want to talk with you? Why are you back so soon?"

Isabella's face darkened slightly. "Nothing worth discussing," he muttered. The conversation had been full of jealousy and trivial complaints, with a sprinkle of criticism about Olivia that he could do without.

Olivia glanced back at Mrs. Fu's solitary figure in the garden and suggested, "Maybe we should walk Mrs. Fu home first?"

"Mrs. Fu?" Isabella's voice turned icy. He leaned in and playfully nipped at Olivia's cheek. "Remember, she's our aunt."

"Alright, alright!" Olivia laughed, pushing Isabella's face away playfully. "I know you're sensitive about this stuff! I'm close to her because of her kindness and because I think she might be our lucky charm with how Grandpa treats her."

Isabella's eyebrows shot up. "Are you saying Grandpa can't protect you?"

"Oh, stop it!" Olivia stomped her foot, giving Isabella a pointed look. "You don't have to be so sensitive!"

As they bantered playfully, they walked further away from the garden, leaving Mrs. Fu standing in the shadows, a serene and beautiful figure. She sighed softly, contemplating the youthful vigor of the pair.

"Fu Rong!" A voice, low and aged, but tinged with emotion, called out.

Fu Rong stiffened, standing under a blooming camellia tree without turning around.

"Fu Rong, how have you been all these years?" Nathan Peterson's tall figure emerged behind her, enveloping her in his shadow and presence.

Fu Rong took a step back, out of his reach. "It doesn't matter, Nathan. I'm just the mother of your brother's son, someone you should keep your distance from."

"Fu Rong, are you still blaming me? After all these years, you still can't forgive me?" Nathan's voice was filled with regret, his usual commanding presence reduced to a mere whisper of vulnerability.

Fu Rong gently pulled her hand away from his grasp and sighed, "Just let Isabella and Olivia be. Consider it a debt repaid."

Nathan agreed without hesitation, "Alright, whatever you say. Everything I have will be for Qianfan."

Fu Rong chuckled bitterly, "You've spoiled him, Nathan. I'm here to set him straight, not for you to give him everything."

"Fu Rong, I plan to give him everything," Nathan insisted stubbornly.

"Don't do that," Fu Rong's voice was firm but gentle, "You've already taken too much from Isabella. Promise me you won't interfere with Qianfan's future, and I'll be grateful."

With those words, Fu Rong turned and walked back to her small home, never once looking back at Nathan. Watching her retreating figure, Nathan's face was etched with guilt and sorrow, seeming to age him by years in an instant.

In the shadows, Alexander Peterson adjusted his glasses, a calculating glint in his eyes. Although he hadn't caught the full conversation, he could tell Nathan had a special interest in his mother, Fu Rong. A sly smile played on his lips. His mother's charm was undeniable, but Nathan, getting anything from her wouldn't be easy.

Fu Rong's return to the Peterson family had stirred things up, bringing a strange tension to the household. The family's matriarch, Mrs. Peterson, was filled with jealousy and suspicion but dared not challenge Fu Rong openly, knowing Nathan's authority. Meanwhile, Fu Rong kept to herself, spending most of her time in meditation and prayer, leaving little room for confrontation.

Mrs. Peterson frequently vented her frustrations to Isabella, who found it increasingly tiresome. Meanwhile, Alexander took advantage of the chaos, accelerating his plans to seize control of the family business, making strategic moves to destabilize the company for his gain.

The Peterson Group, a real estate giant, was thriving in the booming market, but Isabella foresaw the bubble's burst and advised investing in emerging industries. However, Nathan's stubbornness and expansionist mindset left the company vulnerable. As the market turned, and with Alexander's machinations, the company's stock plummeted, leaving the Peterson Group on the brink of collapse.

When Nathan received the dreadful news, he clutched his chest and collapsed, unconscious.

"Nathan! Nathan!" Mrs. Peterson shouted, summoning the family's medical team. Nathan's heart had stopped due to the shock, and his life hung by a thread.

After three days of intensive care, Nathan was pulled back from the brink, but the ordeal had left him frail and aged.

During this time, Fu Rong secluded herself, praying and fasting for three days. Upon hearing Nathan had stabilized, relief washed over her, and she fainted from exhaustion.

Fu Rong was soon taken to the hospital, where she quickly recovered with some care. Her room was just next to Nathan's, and though she hesitated, the urge to see him was too strong.

She entered the room where Nathan lay sleeping. Seeing his hair turned white overnight, her heart ached. Gently, she placed her hand on his and whispered, "Alin."

Nathan's eyes fluttered open, a spark of recognition lighting them up. "Is it you, Fu Rong?"

Fu Rong, tears glistening in her eyes, nodded, "Yes, it's me."

Nathan reached up, cradling her face tenderly, his weary eyes brightened with joy. "Fu Rong, you finally called me Alin. It's been thirty years, hasn't it?"

"To hear you call me that again, I could die happy."

"Don't say that," Fu Rong chided softly, unable to hold back her emotions as she leaned into his embrace, finding solace in his presence once more.

The story of Fu Rong and Nathan was a tapestry woven with years of regret, love, and hope. As the family faced its trials, the past and present intertwined, shaping the future of the Petersons.
