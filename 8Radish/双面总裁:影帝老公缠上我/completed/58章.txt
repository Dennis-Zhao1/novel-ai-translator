Evening had settled in, and Olivia Stewart was still fuming. Isabella Peterson, her ever-supportive partner, had been listening to her rant about Alisha, the woman who had tried to sabotage Olivia's life. 

"Olivia, how do you want to deal with this wicked woman? I'm here to help," Isabella said with a playful grin, rubbing her chin against Olivia's head.

Olivia shot him a sidelong glance, feigning seriousness. "What if I want to skin her alive and throw her into a boiling pot? Would you still help me?"

"Of course! Anyone who dares to hurt my girl deserves the worst. Whatever makes you feel better," Isabella replied, his voice filled with exaggerated bravado.

Alisha, listening nearby, was on the verge of passing out from fear. Olivia, however, just chuckled, her eyes crinkling with amusement. "I thought men preferred those gentle, sweet types? Aren't you scared of my 'evil' side?"

"Olivia, let me tell you, the only way to deal with being bullied is to hit back tenfold. That's the spirit of my girl!" Isabella declared, earning a peck on the cheek from Olivia.

Isabella wasn't satisfied with just that and leaned in for a kiss, but Olivia pushed him away with a laugh. "Stop it! We still have unfinished business to attend to."

"Really? You still want to deal with that disgusting stuff? Just leave it to the bodyguards. Let's go upstairs!"

"No! Handling a homewrecker is something I need to do personally for it to be satisfying," Olivia insisted, asserting her dominance once again.

Isabella's eyes gleamed with admiration, like stars in the night sky. Olivia turned, showing a mischievous grin filled with intent.

"Mr. Wright," Olivia called, "could you bring me some itching powder? The more, the better!"

Isabella couldn't help but chuckle at her plan. He had expected something more fierce from Olivia but was relieved that she still had a kind heart. 

"Don't look down on me!" Olivia protested. "This is called fighting fire with fire. You'll see—itching powder can be quite effective."

Her mischievous smile widened. "And, Mr. Wright, please prepare a special outfit—a thick, airtight jumpsuit, leaving only the head, hands, and feet exposed!"

Isabella tapped her nose playfully. "You little devil!"

"Please, Olivia, Isabella, I won't do it again! Spare me!" Alisha cried, tears streaming down her face as she slapped herself repeatedly.

Olivia remained unmoved. She had already given Alisha a chance, but after the scheme against her, forgiveness was not on the table.

Isabella, meanwhile, was bored and started playing with Olivia's fingers, bending them into different shapes, his attention fixated on her delicate hands.

Fed up with Alisha's whining, Isabella shot her an icy glare and snapped, "You're an eyesore!"

Alisha immediately stopped crying. Isabella's words hurt her more than any physical slap could.

Mr. Wright was efficient, and within ten minutes, he had everything Olivia had requested.

During those ten minutes, Alisha lay trembling on the floor, her fear growing with every passing second until it nearly drove her insane.

Olivia, noticing the items delivered by the staff, jumped up from Isabella's embrace, stifling a yawn. "Ah—it's too late tonight. We'll deal with this tomorrow. Take her outside; I don't want my floors dirty!"

Isabella's eyes lit up at the possessive "my house."

With a wave, the bodyguards carried Alisha out like she was just a piece of luggage.

Isabella accompanied Olivia upstairs, and even at the door, he was reluctant to leave. Olivia stopped and gave him a sidelong look. "It's late, and I need to sleep."

"I need to sleep too."

Olivia nudged his foot, which had already crossed the threshold. "Take a left, and have a good night."

Isabella smirked, blowing air into Olivia's neck. "How about...together?"

Olivia rolled her eyes. "Seriously, Isabella? I've got these ugly red bumps all over. You really want to stay?"

Isabella sighed, realizing she was still holding a grudge. "I'm just worried you'll be lonely and want to chat."

"Chat, huh? Just talking under the covers all night?"

"Uh-huh."

Isabella's eyes were earnest as he gazed at Olivia, his sincerity shining through.

Olivia pouted. "Even if I believe you, I don't trust myself! Go on, early to bed, early to rise!"

As Isabella was reluctantly exiting, a thought struck him, and he stepped back inside with a serious expression. "Olivia, tonight, you must sleep with me."

Olivia paused, rubbing her eyes before glaring at him with one eye open. "What?"

"Because you might scratch those red bumps in your sleep, and if they scar, well, I'm here to supervise."

Seriously?

"That might be contagious!"

"I'm not afraid!"

Olivia was both speechless and resigned, eventually ignoring Isabella and turning over to sleep.

Isabella, ever the opportunist, swiftly kicked off his shoes, lifted the covers, and snuggled next to Olivia, squeezing her to the edge of the bed.

Olivia tensed, every muscle in her body rigid with anxiety.

Isabella wrapped an arm around her, holding her close. "Isabella, what are you doing?"

"Keeping your hands still so you don't scratch," he murmured.

Olivia was frozen, barely daring to breathe.

Isabella, however, did nothing more, and within two minutes, his breathing was slow and steady, completely asleep.

So much for keeping her company. Sheesh, he was out like a light!

Olivia carefully tried to move Isabella's arm from her waist, but as soon as she did, he instinctively tightened his hold, pinning her in place.

Not wanting to wake him, Olivia gave up the struggle.

Once she realized Isabella was truly asleep, Olivia relaxed too, and soon, she drifted off.

In the quiet of the night, Isabella opened his eyes, his gaze shining like obsidian in the darkness.

The next morning, Olivia woke up to find Isabella lying on his side, staring at her with those striking eyes, sporting a pair of dark circles.

"Morning," Olivia greeted, blinking in surprise.

And then, out of nowhere, Isabella leaned in and captured Olivia's lips in a sudden kiss.

"What the—?"

After a night of peace, why was he suddenly acting like this?

Isabella pinned her arms, ensuring she couldn't squirm away.

By the time he let go, Olivia was breathless and dazed.

Then, without a word, Isabella dashed into the bathroom.

Leaning back against her pillow, Olivia watched him go, her mind racing. Clearly, something was bothering him.

If only Olivia knew that those dark circles weren't from her red bumps but from Isabella's restless night.

And what he was actually doing in the bathroom—well, that had nothing to do with disgust and everything to do with a cold shower.

Olivia got up and went to wash up in the other bathroom.

When she returned, Isabella was ready with her medicine, helping her change clothes before dashing back into the bathroom for yet another round of cold water.

Olivia couldn't comprehend Isabella's behavior and assumed he was disturbed by her red bumps, hence the frequent cleaning.

After all, for someone as picky as him to go out of his way for her was a big deal.

The two of them went downstairs together, where Lucas Wright greeted them with a wide grin.

The staff all nodded and smiled, wearing expressions that suggested they knew something special had happened.

Apparently, the news of their shared night had spread throughout the manor.

But, heaven knows, nothing had actually happened!

How could they possibly explain? And even if they tried, who'd believe them?

Olivia shot a disgruntled look at Isabella, who was grinning more suggestively than Mr. Wright himself, making the situation even more awkward.

Blushing furiously, Olivia lowered her head and didn’t lift it again.

After lunch, Olivia was finally ready to deal with Alisha.

As the old saying goes, it's best to face judgment when the sun is at its peak—that's when the spectacle is most entertaining!

Outside, on the lawn, staff had already placed two white chairs under the shade of a tree.

Isabella wrapped an arm around Olivia as they approached, sitting down with her nestled in his lap.

"Isabella..."

"The sun's harsh. If you get tanned, it might scar. I'm just shielding you," Isabella explained.

Olivia looked up at the thick tree canopy and then turned to him with a smirk. "Yeah, with you here, it's definitely cooler."

Lucas Wright stood by, stifling a laugh. "Would you like to start now, sir, Olivia?"

"Definitely! I want Alisha to experience that itch you can't quite scratch."

Alisha was brought over by the bodyguards. No one had harmed her, yet after just one night, she looked utterly defeated, disheveled, and drained.

Seeing the couple sitting cozily under the tree, Alisha's heart sank in despair.

Not just any woman could dream of being with the young master.

Perhaps she should never have let herself entertain such thoughts.

Had she not committed those foolish acts, maybe she could have stayed in the manor, occasionally catching a glimpse of the young master. But now...

Regret was futile; there was no going back.

Lucas Wright gave a signal, and the bodyguards swiftly put Alisha in the custom jumpsuit, then poured the itching powder down her neck...
