Olivia Stewart glanced around the castle hallway, trying to piece together her next move while simultaneously nursing a lingering pain in her back. As she ascended the grand staircase, she couldn't help but wonder how Isabella Peterson always seemed to know exactly what was going on in her life. It was both impressive and unnerving.

Lucas Wright, ever the dutiful attendant, appeared at her side with the speed of a sprinter. "Olivia, Isabella wants you to take a call," he announced, slightly out of breath.

"How did my phone end up ringing in the downstairs hall?" Olivia mused as she accepted the phone, bracing herself for what was sure to be a loud conversation.

Sure enough, Isabella's voice boomed through the receiver almost immediately. "Olivia Stewart, you dare not answer my calls?"

Olivia held the phone away from her ear, her lips twitching into a smile despite the scolding. "I answered, didn't I?"

"Still got the nerve to talk back, huh? Just because I'm not there to keep you in line, you think you can get away with anything?"

"It's not like that, Isabella," Olivia replied, trying to sound contrite while suppressing laughter. "I'm on the line now, aren't I?"

A pause followed, filled with Isabella's characteristic huff of indignation. "I nearly blew up your phone trying to reach you. If it weren't for Lucas finding you, I doubt you'd have picked up. So, where were you?"

Olivia hesitated, scrambling for an excuse. "I was just in my room, left my phone on the windowsill and didn't hear it."

"You expect me to believe that? Your phone was on the nightstand. I hacked your camera!" Isabella declared with a smugness that was both infuriating and endearing.

Olivia's eyes widened in disbelief. "You...you what?"

"Your phone camera, your laptop, and your tablet," Isabella continued, seemingly pleased with herself.

Olivia vowed silently to cover all her devices' cameras with tape the moment she was back in her room. "This is ridiculous," she muttered under her breath.

Isabella's tone shifted, dropping to a low murmur. "Get in front of your computer. I want to see you."

Olivia blinked, a strange warmth spreading through her chest. Was that...a hint of affection? But then Isabella added, "And don't wear anything."

Olivia's face flushed crimson, caught between indignation and amusement. The nerve of that guy! "Isabella, I might not be wearing anything...but it's in a place the camera can't see."

"Dammit!" came Isabella's frustrated exclamation, accompanied by the sound of something crashing.

Olivia chuckled, feeling a small victory. "Too bad our cameras aren't wide-angle, huh?"

"I'm getting wide-angle cameras installed the minute I return! Now get in front of the camera!"

"Nope!" Olivia's defiance was playful, her voice a mix of stubbornness and mischief.

The conversation ended with Isabella angrily vowing to return and "deal with her." Olivia couldn't help but feel a mix of dread and excitement. She knew she might have pushed Isabella too far this time.

"Lucas, do you think I should just tell Isabella about my injury?" Olivia asked cautiously, considering her options.

Lucas shook his head, suggesting, "Maybe it's better to address it once they're back. Less chance for misunderstanding."

Olivia nodded, though her mind was already racing with plans and contingencies. As she drifted off to sleep later, her dreams were filled with images of Isabella, a mix of annoyance and affection painting the scenes.

Morning arrived all too soon, and with it, the realization that Isabella would be back any moment. Olivia found herself anxiously preparing to face the whirlwind that was Isabella Peterson, all the while hoping to resolve the situation with Sophie Cook before things got even more complicated.

The castle was alive with activity, servants bustling about with purpose. But Olivia had eyes only for the path ahead, determined to survive the storm she knew was coming.
