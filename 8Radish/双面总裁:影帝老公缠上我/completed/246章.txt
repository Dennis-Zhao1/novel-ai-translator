Alexander Peterson's Peculiar Tastes

Olivia Stewart left with a radiant smile on her face, clutching a glass of milk like it was a prized possession.

Alexander Peterson watched her retreating figure with a mix of emotions—anger, disappointment, longing, and a stubborn refusal to let go. He thought bitterly about how things might have been different if he had been the rightful heir of the Peterson Group. Would Olivia have chosen him over Isabella Peterson back then? Would she be running around happily for his sake now?

Everything that was beautiful about her, everything that should have been his, had been given to another man—to his most begrudged sibling, Isabella Peterson!

Alexander's usually pleasant smile had long vanished, replaced by a sinister grin that twisted his delicate features into something that might have leapt from a gothic horror story. As soon as Olivia's silhouette disappeared from sight, he made his way to his secret room, where his beloved surgical tools and a group of cute rabbits awaited.

"Master Alexander!" His butler, Arthur, appeared from the shadows, quickly approaching with a hushed urgency. "Sir, someone from the guest house has arrived."

The darkness in Alexander's eyes flickered briefly as he took a seat and said, "Let her in."

Arthur left and soon returned with a young maid. "Greetings, Master Alexander," she said, bowing gracefully. Her voice was sweet, and her eyes carried a natural allure.

This was the type of maid who seemed born to crawl into someone's bed. Alexander had noticed her potential early on and had sent her to Isabella Peterson's side, but she remained just a cleaning maid. Disappointed, he had almost forgotten about her until she volunteered to report today.

"Do you have something to say?" Alexander maintained his gentle demeanor, though his voice was cool and detached.

"Yes, Master Alexander," the maid, Layla, replied, casting a bashful glance his way, a blush spreading across her young face. It was clear she had failed to seduce Isabella and was now trying her luck with Alexander. Poor thing, she had no idea who she was dealing with.

Arthur silently lit a metaphorical candle for her in his mind. He glanced at Alexander, whose smile was warm but whose eyes betrayed deep disdain.

"Go on," Alexander prompted softly, his eyes gleaming with an unsettling light. Arthur shivered involuntarily, reminded of the dissected rabbits Alexander so fondly worked on. He feared that if Layla failed to deliver valuable information, she might become the next unfortunate "experiment."

Layla, captivated by Alexander's gaze, leaned in nervously and whispered, "Master Alexander, if I tell you this secret, will you bring me back to your side?"

"Hmm?" Alexander's fingers tightened around Layla's throat, pulling her close. He enjoyed watching small creatures struggle; it was a particular delight of his.

"And what makes you think you can bargain with me, a mere maid?" he hissed, his fingers constricting further as his eyes gleamed like a predator's.

"M-Master Alexander!" Layla's face turned crimson, her eyes wide with terror.

Sensing danger, Arthur stepped forward urgently. "Master Alexander, perhaps we should hear what she has to say first."

Alexander's expression hardened briefly before he released his grip slightly, fixing Layla with a chilling stare. "Speak."

Terrified out of her wits, Layla stammered, "I-I saw the other day, the young master was feeding milk to a potted plant. I don't know if it's a significant secret..."

What an idiot! Feeding a plant? It was clear Isabella had become suspicious and was discarding the concoctions Alexander had prepared. The secret was indeed crucial, but Alexander would never let Layla realize its importance.

His fingers tightened abruptly, and Layla's eyes bulged with pain, her limbs flailing uselessly. Arthur hesitated, his lips twitching, but he remained silent, bowing his head.

Moments later, Layla's struggles ceased, her head lolling to the side. Alexander discarded her lifeless body disdainfully and wiped his hands meticulously with a white towel.

"Take her inside," he commanded coldly, his voice like a whisper from the underworld. Arthur's body trembled violently.

"Master Alexander, this is..." Arthur hesitated, thinking that using her as a test subject was excessively cruel.

"You think I'm too cruel?" Alexander's gaze pierced Arthur's balding head.

"N-No, not at all," Arthur stammered, shaking with fear.

"She saw my cruel side; it would be unfair not to show it." In truth, he feared exposure, and Layla's revelation had unwittingly made her a scapegoat for his wrath. Isabella's suspicions meant his long-planned schemes needed to accelerate.

Alexander's face, once again calm and refined, belied the chaos of moments before. He admired his long, slender fingers, treating them with the same care he did his surgical tools.

Arthur lingered nervously, drenched in cold sweat, trying to make himself as inconspicuous as possible. Despite Alexander's elegant appearance, his heart was ruthlessly cold. Those graceful hands could take a life without hesitation.

"Can you handle the situation with the maid?" Alexander's cold eyes flicked up.

"Yes, Master Alexander, leave it to me!" Arthur nodded vigorously, relieved to be temporarily free from his master's ominous presence.

Alexander turned away, contemplating his next move. If Isabella was aware, his plans to sabotage her would need revising. Fortunately, he had a trump card.

"Bring my mother back," he ordered with a sly smile.

"Yes, Master Alexander!" Arthur bowed, grateful to escape the oppressive atmosphere.

As Arthur departed, Alexander's thoughts swirled with possibilities. If Olivia and Isabella were conspiring to deceive him, he had just the solution to keep his beloved Olivia close, forever preserved in his twisted collection. His mother’s return would set a new game in motion, one that would ensure the Peterson legacy remained within his grasp.
