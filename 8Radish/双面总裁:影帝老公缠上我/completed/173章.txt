Isabella Peterson stood there, utterly bewildered. It was like someone had just hit him over the head with a frying pan. His face shifted from confusion to anger in a split second, and he shouted, "Olivia Stewart, do you even know what you're saying?"

"We're breaking up! I said we're breaking up!" Olivia was crying her heart out. "Isabella, I know you're a clean freak, and today I realized I'm the dirtiest woman alive. I'm not even fit to be your rented girlfriend! So, we're done!"

Isabella pulled Olivia close, trying to calm her down. "Look, I know everything that happened today. It was just a misunderstanding. That night at the club? It was me. And those who plotted against you got what they deserved. So, stop crying. And remember, no more talk of breaking up, or else!"

"No, Isabella, you don't have to take the blame just to comfort me. It's not worth it!" Olivia was still struggling in his arms, clearly not believing a word he said.

This girl, why was she so stubborn?

Isabella sighed, both fond and frustrated. "Olivia!"

"Isabella, let go! Every second with you right now is agony!" Olivia begged, suddenly turning to grab a photo from the drawer, waving it in his face. "Look, I'm a terrible woman who slept with a director and a producer!"

"Nonsense!" Isabella lightly flicked her forehead. "I've already told you, that was me! Keep talking nonsense, and you'll regret it!"

"No, Isabella, I'm just your rented girlfriend. You don't need to sacrifice so much for me! Let's end this arrangement. I can't afford to pay any penalties, but if I stay with you, scandals will follow, and your reputation will be ruined."

"Fool!"

Half adoration, half exasperation, Isabella suddenly pulled Olivia's little face towards him, and before she could resist, his lips were on hers, hot and unyielding. He kissed her with such intensity that she couldn't help but melt against him.

When they finally broke apart, Olivia was breathless, her cheeks flushed, her eyes wide and clear, looking up at him with a kind of dazed wonder.

Isabella felt a tug at his heart, like a little cat had just scratched it. But he knew now wasn't the time for any grand gestures, so he led Olivia to the sofa and sat her down. Picking up the photo, he asked, "This is the guy you spent the night with, right?"

Olivia nodded, still a bit dazed.

Isabella tapped her nose. "Silly girl! Didn't you take a good look? Do you not recognize who that man is?"

"I didn't have the presence of mind," Olivia admitted. "I don't know him, but the woman is definitely me!"

She'd thought the man's silhouette looked familiar, but she'd been too upset to dwell on it. Besides, in a suit, all tall men looked the same to her.

"Clueless little thing!" Isabella shook his head, bringing the photo closer to Olivia's face. "Look again! You've spent so much time with me and can't even recognize my silhouette?"

Olivia examined the photo more closely, then glanced at Isabella. "It does look like you, but something seems off."

Isabella was at a loss for words. Back then, he'd shown up as a big-shot mogul, all suited up and wearing sunglasses, naturally exuding a more commanding presence than his usual laid-back self.

While Isabella pondered whether to explain his mogul persona to her, Olivia tossed the photo at him, rolling her eyes. "Isabella, I'm not in the mood for games. Don't try to fool me!"

This stubborn girl! Why couldn't she see the truth?

Isabella felt a mix of frustration and amusement, guilt and helplessness. He sighed, pulled out his phone, and played a recording of Daniel Johnson's sobbing confession: "Please, have mercy! I'll tell you everything, not a single lie!"

Daniel Johnson?

Olivia looked at Isabella in shock.

Isabella's gaze was firm. "What are you looking at? After you left the café with Daniel, I confronted him and got the whole story. I know you can't stand him, but you wouldn't believe me otherwise, so I had to let you hear the recording."

Olivia listened in silence, hugging her knees, as Daniel's voice recounted the night's events. Her grip on her pant leg tightened with each word.

Isabella placed his hand over hers, knowing this wasn't easy for her. But he also knew she had to face it head-on to truly move on.

The warmth of his hand brought Olivia some comfort, her tense expression gradually softening.

When the recording ended, Olivia remained silent.

Isabella squeezed her hand tighter, a bit anxious. "Olivia, do you believe me now? That night, it was me. Fate has it, you're meant to be mine!"

Olivia looked up, seeing the sparkle in Isabella's eyes, like stars embedded in a midnight sky.

This proud, awkward, yet endearing man!

She sighed deeply, choosing not to point out his slip of calling her by someone else's name, though it stung like a needle prick.

Suddenly, Olivia realized something important and grabbed Isabella's hand in worry. "What did you do to Daniel Johnson?"

Isabella was caught off guard by her sudden question.

He let go of her hand with a scoff, his brows knitting together, exuding a chilly aura. "Olivia, he sold you out, and you're worried about him? Where do you get the nerve to care about another man in front of me? I should have finished him off today!"

Relieved to hear Daniel wasn't dead, Olivia relaxed visibly.

But her relief was glaring to Isabella.

His fists clenched, the veins on his forehead pulsing.

"Olivia!" His voice was cold, each word like an icicle dropping from his lips.

"What? Are you going to scold me again?" Olivia rolled her eyes at him.

Isabella's eyes flickered with confusion, holding back his temper.

Usually, when he got mad, Olivia would cower like a little mole. Was today an exception? Not only did she not retreat, but she also dared to roll her eyes!

Was it all for that loser ex-boyfriend? 

Sure, people said first loves were special, but wasn't he her true first love?

Thinking about this, Isabella's expression darkened, and he pinched Olivia's chin. "Feeling brave, are we?"

"Yes!" Olivia slapped his hand away, meeting his gaze fearlessly. "Isabella, can't you stop being so petty?"

"I..." Petty? Him?

"Every time you see me with another guy, you freak out. Every time I say something about another guy, you lose it. Do you even trust me, Isabella? Do you?"

"I..." Isabella was speechless, completely taken aback.

The always proud, commanding, and above-it-all Isabella Peterson, at a loss for words? Priceless!

Seeing him like this, Olivia felt triumphant, her attitude becoming even more smug as she mimicked his usual haughty demeanor. "Isabella, I'm not as naive as you think!"

"Do whatever you want to Daniel, break him, ruin him—he deserves it. But one thing, you can't kill him!"

Interesting little thing! I like her!

Isabella raised an eyebrow, his eyes gleaming with mischief, like a relaxed leopard eyeing its domain.

"Why?" His voice, usually cold or commanding, was now warm, with a hint of teasing allure.

"Because," Olivia met his gaze with seriousness, "I don't want you to dirty your hands with someone like him."

Ah, so that's it!

Isabella's expression softened, his icy demeanor melting away into a quiet smile.

Seeing him silent, Olivia grew anxious. "Isabella, did you hear what I said? Killing is a crime. He's not worth it! I won't let you get into trouble!"
