When people hit rock bottom, they become unstoppable.

"Get lost, you maniacs! What gives you the right to do this?" Emily Young shouted, dodging projectiles while the mob hurled insults and accusations at her. Their words were harsh and unforgiving.

Emily was completely bewildered, forced to flee. She'd spent the last week in the hospital, recovering from a traumatic delivery and severe blood loss. With the indifferent and judgmental hospital staff not even giving her a TV to watch, she was clueless about the chaos that had unfolded outside.

As she navigated through the quieter streets to avoid further harassment, Emily resembled a disheveled mess. By the time she reached home, she'd gone from a respected figure to looking like she'd just crawled out of a dumpster.

First things first, Emily dashed into the bathroom to clean up. Wrapped in a bathrobe, she emerged just as the phone started to ring. Her cell was lost in the chaos of a wild night at a hotel, but thankfully, her landline was still operational.

"Hello, who is this?" she answered, trying to sound sweet and seductiveâ€”after all, she was now a single woman, free to flirt as she pleased.

"Miss Young, finally! I've been trying to reach you!" It was Mr. Wang, the general manager of Emily's once-thriving fashion company, FeiFei Fashions.

Thinking of the balding manager with a dismissive wave, Emily replied coolly, "What do you want?"

"Miss Young, we've hit a crisis. Due to your recent bad press, we haven't secured a single contract. Employees are resigning en masse; we can't keep the business afloat!"

"What are you talking about? How did this happen?" Emily exclaimed.

"Haven't you checked the internet lately?" Mr. Wang asked hesitantly, as if the words were too heavy to utter.

Emily quickly opened her laptop. The web was flooded with hateful comments about her and Daniel Johnson. What on earth had happened? Just a week ago, everyone was targeting Olivia Stewart. How could things have turned so quickly?

Her social media account was suspended, but Daniel's was booming, serving as a vent for public outrage. Emily couldn't help but sneer. "Daniel Johnson, you idiot. Let them roast you online! How dumb can you be to expose your own scandals like that?"

But then a headline caught her eye: "Daniel Johnson's Unbelievable Success: From Scandal to Riches, Entering the Millionaire Club!"

What? Daniel Johnson raking in money? About to make the millionaire list? How could a guy stuck in a hospital bed with broken legs be making a fortune?

Despite her skepticism, curiosity got the best of Emily. She clicked on the article and finally understood. Daniel Johnson was cashing in on their scandal, and half the comments were about her!

Seething with rage, Emily forgot she had instigated the scandal in the first place. "Daniel Johnson! You dare expose my secrets? I deserve a cut of that money! Why should you get it all?"

Emily was about to storm off to confront Daniel when the phone rang again. It was Mr. Wang, and she answered impatiently, "What now?"

"Miss Young, I'm sorry, but I can't manage the factory anymore. I apologize to your parents..."

"Stop whining!" Emily snapped. "If you have something to say, say it!"

"I... I want to resign," Mr. Wang said awkwardly.

Emily's temper flared. "Fine, retire already! I'll promote someone new tomorrow!"

"Miss Young, they all resigned," Mr. Wang said, sounding defeated.

"What?" Emily's voice was so shrill it could pierce eardrums. She'd been so caught up with Daniel's drama that she'd forgotten the factory's state.

"I'm sorry, Miss Young. I couldn't keep them. Everyone's gone now. I'm the last one."

These traitorous opportunists! Emily gripped the phone tightly, her heart pounding as she shouted, "Get lost! All of you!"

"I've left their resignation letters on your desk. Please check the factory soon," Mr. Wang said quietly before hanging up.

The receiver slipped from Emily's hand, crashing onto her foot, but she didn't feel a thing. After a while, she sprang up, racing to the factory.

The factory was her lifeline. But when she arrived, she truly understood the meaning of desolation. The buildings stood silent in the night, as lifeless as a ghost town, not even a mouse in sight.

Everyone had left, and the factory was doomed.

Emily sat helplessly on the cold ground, unable to comprehend how her life had spiraled so quickly. Tradition dictated she should still be in postpartum confinement, yet here she was, exposed to the cold like a distorted statue.

A cricket's chirp snapped her back to reality. She wiped her face, feeling the cool, salty tears.

It was all Daniel Johnson's fault! If she hadn't met him, she'd still be the cherished daughter of the Young family, managing her modest factory, living a comfortable life.

But now? Disappointed parents had fled the country, the factory shut down, Daniel disabled, leaving her with nothing but a frail child and an empty life.

Thinking of Daniel and his lucrative social media account reignited her resolve. She rushed home, determined to confront him.

The next day, Emily's FeiFei Fashions declared bankruptcy. Everything was sold at rock-bottom prices, yet no one wanted them. Such was her reputation.

On the third day, Emily hired a lawyer and sued Daniel, demanding a re-evaluation of their marital assets.

The scandalous lawsuit became the talk of the town, making Daniel and Emily infamous beyond celebrity status.

Days later, their trial began.

In court, Emily argued passionately, "Your Honor, half of Daniel's followers are haters because of me. I deserve half of his income!"

Daniel shot back, "Emily, we're divorced! This is my income alone. You get nothing!"

Emily countered, "How can you claim it's yours? You exposed scandals involving both of us! Even if you earned money after the divorce, those events happened before. So this income is joint property. I demand a split!"

Daniel slammed his wheelchair, furious. "Emily, have you no shame?"

Emily retorted, "Daniel, do you have any face left? You already sold it!"

Their heated exchange continued, ignoring the judge's calls for order.

The courtroom was packed with entertainment reporters, who eagerly broadcasted the spectacle live.

"Ha!" Olivia Stewart chuckled, watching the trial on her tablet. "Karma's caught up with them!"

Isabella Peterson, sitting nearby, watched with amused affection. "Silly girl," she thought. "There's so much in the world; does karma really have time for everyone?"

Emily's predicament was partly Isabella's doing. She'd secretly fueled the scandal with an untraceable viral video. But Daniel and Emily's antics were beyond expectation.

Truly, when people hit rock bottom, they become unstoppable.
