At the bustling makeshift market, Olivia Stewart was in the midst of orchestrating her side hustle when a girl eagerly waved her hand the highest, shouting to get her attention. Olivia collected the money, puzzled, while Isabella Peterson, with a cool, detached demeanor, handed over a bench to the excited girl, who couldn't help but blush as she stole a glance at Isabella.

Ah, so that's how it is! Even with sunglasses on, Isabella was turning heads and causing quite the stir. Olivia shot a playful glare at Isabella. "Why don't you just wear a mask when you go out?"

Isabella smirked. "Then how would you sell your benches?"

"Forget it! I'm not selling anymore!" Olivia declared, feigning frustration.

"Great!" Isabella dropped the bench, ready to make an escape. She'd had enough of this makeshift labor gig.

"Hold it right there!" Olivia stood, hands on hips, pointing at Isabella.

"Hmm?" Isabella turned back, curious.

"Since people are already ogling, why not make the most of it? You, Isabella, pick up that bench and keep selling with me. When Michael Wright brings that carload over, we're not leaving until it's all sold out!"

And with that, Isabella became Olivia's reluctant sidekick again, helping to sell benches. The crowd, mainly young people, especially the girls, eagerly bought their $40 benches, whispering amongst themselves about Isabella’s resemblance to some heartthrob actor.

"Hey, doesn't that sunglasses dude look a bit like our idol, Tennyson?" one girl whispered.

"Yeah, he's got a bit of that vibe."

"It's not just a bit! His build is just like Tennyson's. But, you know, Tennyson's an import, while this guy's homegrown!"

"Well, you never know, with those shades on, he might have blue eyes just like Tennyson. Ooh, let's buy another bench and get him over here for a closer look!"

"Hey, handsome! We want more benches!"

Olivia’s face fell. They’d already bought six benches—were they planning to stack them into a bed for the night?

Two hours later, Olivia stretched her weary limbs, as Isabella practically dragged her back to the car for a break.

"One, two, three..." Sitting in the plush comfort of their high-end car, Olivia meticulously counted the day's earnings without a hint of discord.

"Three thousand five hundred sixty, just short of one thousand four hundred forty. Sigh—" Olivia sighed, pocketing the cash, only to catch Isabella’s inquisitive gaze.

Olivia felt a bit uneasy. "What? Why are you looking at me like that?"

"You need money, so why didn't you just ask me?" Isabella queried, locking eyes with Olivia.

"Uh, you were on a trip, and besides, I can handle it myself. No need to trouble you," Olivia replied, her gaze darting away.

"And have you handled it now?"

"Almost... just a little short," Olivia gestured with her fingers.

"What do you want to buy, and how much more do you need? I'll cover it," Isabella offered grandly.

"No, no!" Olivia waved her hands, grinning sheepishly. "If you really want to help, then just come with me to sell some more stuff this afternoon."

Sell more? Isabella’s face took on a slight green tinge. Him, a young master, stooping to be a street vendor—how mortifying!

Olivia tugged on Isabella’s arm, pleading, "Come on, please?"

Isabella glanced at the entwined arms. "You just want to exploit your man’s looks, huh?"

"Well, they can look all they want, but they can't touch, right?" Olivia gestured toward the groupies.

"Then why don't you take advantage of what you can touch?" Isabella teased, peering down at Olivia.

Olivia quickly averted her gaze, staying silent.

"Olivia, have lunch with me, take a proper rest this afternoon, and whatever you're short, I'll give it to you as payment for your time," Isabella declared.

Olivia perked up. "Isabella, it's not the same. I know you could give me five thousand, fifty thousand, even more if I asked. But you don’t understand—money earned through my own efforts feels more satisfying, more fulfilling. Plus, I really don't want to ask you for money right now. Honestly, having you with me to make money is even more fun!"

Isabella’s expression softened. "What are you trying to buy? I'll get it for you."

"I... want a ticket to the actor's live show," Olivia admitted, cautiously watching Isabella’s reaction.

"You like him a lot?" Isabella raised an eyebrow.

Olivia peeked again and held up a finger. "Just... a little."

"Do you like me more, or him?" Isabella pressed.

"That's... hard to say, really. It's like comparing apples and oranges," Olivia fumbled, glancing at her fingers.

"Do you think I'm more handsome, or is he?" Isabella persisted.

Olivia pouted. "To me, all handsome guys look about the same—just good-looking!"

"Have lunch with me, take the afternoon off, and I'll get you a ticket!" Isabella sighed, finding the negotiation too easy.

"Wow—Isabella, I love you!" Olivia lunged, hugging Isabella and planting a smooch on his handsome face.

Isabella was about to retaliate when Olivia nimbly jumped away, counting on her fingers. "Actually, I planned to sell drinks this afternoon, then some portable sleeping bags later. How about this: we grab a quick bite for lunch, then you help me sell stuff for a bit, and in the evening, I'll have dinner with you. Then, you get me a ticket. Deal?"

"Why sell when I’ve promised you a ticket?" Isabella asked, puzzled.

"This way, I get both money and a ticket!" Olivia’s eyes twinkled with savvy. "This afternoon, everyone will be selling drinks, so we'll just sell sleeping bags. Nobody's thought of that yet! Look at those long lines—at least two-thirds will stay overnight. With you, the handsome guy, helping out, we'll make a killing, then have a romantic dinner. Right?"

Isabella affectionately tousled her hair. "Alright, alright, whatever you say, you little schemer!"

Olivia beamed, thinking to herself that by the afternoon, she'd have enough saved up, plus Isabella's ticket, to satisfy Sophie Cook and indulge in a little star-chasing adventure.

That afternoon, with Isabella’s connections, a carload of portable sleeping bags arrived, saving Olivia a trip to the wholesale market. She even got to nap in Isabella's arms. Of course, she couldn't escape a bout of passionate kisses, nearly getting swept away right in the car.

The sleeping bags retailed at $120 each, but Olivia doubled it to $240. When someone complained about the price, Olivia rolled her eyes, "Buy it or not, see that guy with the sleeping bags? People say he looks just like Tennyson. You’ve been ogling him for free; paying a little extra is worth it, right? If the number didn't sound bad, I'd sell them for $250, just for easy change!"

"Ha!"

Even Isabella, with his usual cool demeanor, couldn't help but laugh.

The women in line gasped at the rare sight of the icy handsome guy smiling and rushed to buy more. "I'll take one!" "Two for me!" "Hey handsome, can you pass me that pink one?"

Watching from the sidelines, the water vendors clicked their tongues in envy, seeing the real profit. They rushed to the wholesale market, but all the sleeping bags were sold out, leaving them to stare in disbelief.

Olivia cornered the sleeping bag market, with Isabella’s good looks drawing in the crowds. Business boomed, filling their cash reserves.

By four o'clock, Olivia had sold out the entire load, retreating to Isabella’s car, counting the money with glee.

Isabella gave her a sidelong glance, his voice teasingly disdainful. "Look at you, getting excited over so little!"

"Olivia, if you really love money, I'll have a truckload of cash dumped at our place for you to count to your heart's content!"

"You don’t get it. When something’s rare, it’s precious. If cash were as common as leaves, you'd just kick it around without a thought. It's like handsome guys—the fewer there are, the more people fawn over them. If everyone looked like Tennyson, people might be sick of it!"

Isabella's expression darkened a bit. "Are you sick of me?"

"No, no, I'm just making a point, not about you. You look... perfect, just right!" Olivia assured.

Isabella's mood lightened somewhat. "That's more like it."

Olivia propped her chin on her hand. "There's an old saying—'add one more, it's too much; take one away, it's too little.'"

"Olivia!" Isabella bristled. "Are you mocking my lack of education? That's about women!"

Olivia quickly raised her hands in surrender. "Okay, okay, I was wrong!"

"Olivia, I'm telling you, I’m very upset now, and my heart feels terribly wounded. You need to make it up to me!"

Olivia pouted, "How do you want me to make it up to you?"

Isabella leaned in, a mischievous glint in his eye. "Warm... my bed."

"Ah!" Olivia covered her face, groaning, "Isabella, I was wrong, really wrong! Please, spare me!"

"Now begging for mercy? Isn’t it a bit late?"

Isabella pinched her chin gently, closing the space between them until their noses were nearly touching. "Hmm?"

"Sir, what about the leftover sleeping bags..."

A bodyguard rushed over but immediately quieted down upon witnessing the intimate scene.

The pesky interrupter! Isabella didn’t even look up, swinging a punch backward at the bodyguard for ruining the mood.

The bodyguard clutched his chest, retreating silently.

Olivia had already pushed Isabella away, straightening up to face the bodyguard. "Weren't the sleeping bags sold out? What's going on? Are there more?"

The bodyguard glanced nervously at Isabella, unsure whether to answer.

Olivia turned to Isabella, pouting. "Did you hide some sleeping bags just to finish up early? No way, I need to sell those off—otherwise, this golden opportunity will be lost, and tomorrow they’ll be worthless scraps!"
