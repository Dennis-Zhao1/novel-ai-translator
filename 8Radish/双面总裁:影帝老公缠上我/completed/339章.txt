Olivia Stewart and the Twins

Ethan King leaned back in his chair, recounting the latest events to Isabella Peterson over a late-night phone call. "No harm's come to Olivia Stewart yet. That couple's been working for me now—one in the ranch, the other in the kitchen. Turns out, she makes a soup Olivia Stewart really likes."

Isabella paused, contemplating the couple's intentions. Previously, when the couple had come begging for forgiveness, Isabella thought it was just another one of their lies. But after their business collapsed, they sold everything to Isabella at a loss and disappeared for months. Now it seemed they were genuinely looking to make amends.

However, the memories of what they had done to Olivia Stewart were hard to shake. Isabella’s cold voice cut through the silence, "Whether they're sincere or not, I don't know. But it's better to keep them close and watch them than to kick them out and risk backstabbing. Don't let them near Olivia Stewart."

"Got it," Ethan replied before hanging up and swiftly moving to the main house. He’d learned that the couple had already met Olivia Stewart and, thanks to some intervention by the twins, were allowed to stay. The thought sent a chill down his spine, prompting him to hurry to Olivia Stewart's little cottage.

Inside, the warm glow from the overhead lamp illuminated Olivia Stewart and the twins as they painted together. Seeing the calmness on Olivia's face, Ethan felt a wave of relief wash over him. He stood outside the cabin, quietly watching her, feeling a sense of happiness just being near her. He remained there until the lights went out and Olivia Stewart and the twins went to sleep.

The next day at lunch, Olivia Stewart reached for the soup ladle out of habit. She had come a long way, now eating with everyone and choosing her food independently—a significant improvement.

"Mommy, let me help you!" exclaimed Fruit, one of the twins, reaching for the ladle.

Ethan was about to intervene but reconsidered. The twins had been instrumental in Olivia's recovery. He signaled the staff to let them be and watched as Fruit tried to serve Olivia soup.

Just as Fruit reached for the soup, Coco, the other twin, snatched the ladle away. "Hot!" Coco said simply, with a serious look on his face.

Fruit frowned, her hands on her hips, "I know! I'll be careful!"

Ignoring her, Coco carefully ladled the soup into a bowl and pushed it toward Olivia Stewart. Fruit, sulking, sat back down and crossed her arms, glancing away in a huff.

Coco handed Fruit a pair of chopsticks, saying, "You can serve the veggies."

Realizing the logic, Fruit grabbed the chopsticks and retorted, "I'll serve Mom, and you serve me!”

Coco obliged, serving Fruit her favorite dish—golden, glistening shrimp. Despite his quiet demeanor, he remembered what everyone liked to eat.

With her mood lifted, Fruit happily climbed back onto her seat, picking out Olivia's favorite dishes.

Ethan watched from the other end of the long dining table. The scene filled him with both joy and a little envy. Seeing Isabella so loved and surrounded by these adorable kids made him yearn for a similar connection.

He glanced at Olivia Stewart, knowing that was an unattainable dream. She was absorbed in stirring her soup, her expression serene and painting-like.

When she finally tasted the soup, she made a face. "Not good?" Ethan asked, concerned.

Olivia looked at him, her face expressionless, but placed the ladle back in the bowl silently.

Ethan smiled apologetically, "Maybe the chef was off today. I'll have them make a new batch. How about trying something else in the meantime?"

Fruit eagerly offered Olivia a piece of sweet and sour ribs. "Mommy, try this! It's good!"

Olivia hesitated briefly before taking a bite, encouraged by Fruit's expectant gaze.

"Yay! Mommy ate my food!" Fruit cheered, nearly toppling off her chair in excitement.

Ethan couldn't help but smile. Olivia's willingness to accept food from her children was another positive sign. Even if it was only around them, it showed her heart was slowly opening up.

He signaled the staff to take the soup away and whispered instructions for Grace Martin, the head chef, to supervise the preparation of a new batch closely.

Later, Ethan brought some delicate pastries to the garden, where Olivia and the twins were painting. The twins, however, were more interested in experimenting with colors than creating a masterpiece.

"Ugh, so boring!" Fruit sighed, tugging on Coco's sleeve. "Aren't you bored?"

Coco was focused, meticulously sketching a flower with guidance from Olivia, ignoring his sister's antics.

Fruit, seeking attention, jumped up, "How about I dance for you guys?"

She struck a dramatic pose and began singing and dancing, lost in her world.

Ethan arrived with the snacks, finding Olivia and Coco engrossed in their art while Fruit performed energetically.

These kids were something else—Coco, so serious and cool like Isabella, and Fruit, lively and spirited, reminiscent of Olivia when they first met.

After her performance, Fruit noticed Ethan. "Hey, pretty uncle! Did you like it?"

Ethan set down the tray, picked up Fruit, and twirled her around. "Our little princess is the cutest and prettiest! Much more than your uncle. Maybe you shouldn’t call me ‘pretty uncle’ anymore, okay?"

"Okay!" Fruit nodded solemnly.

Ethan sighed in relief. Her nickname for him had always made him uneasy, and he was glad she agreed to change it.

"What should I call you then?" Fruit pondered.

Ethan braced himself.

"Crazy uncle?"

His smile faltered slightly.

"Or mischievous uncle?"

This little imp!

Ethan almost chuckled at her antics. "Alright, you can call me crazy uncle."

"Yay!" Fruit wriggled out of his arms and called to the others, "Mommy, brother, come eat!"

Watching Olivia Stewart and her twins, Ethan smiled.
