Lucas Wright leaned down to Isabella Peterson, whispering, “Olivia Stewart is in the room.”

“Great!” Isabella huffed, her mood as fiery as a lit firecracker. She stormed up the stairs, determined to confront Olivia.

“Bang, bang, bang!”

“Who is it?”

“Open up!”

Only Isabella could knock like that.

Olivia was lounging in her room, engrossed in a video, when she heard Isabella’s voice. She quickly clutched her tablet and rushed to open the door.

“Isabella, weren’t you on a business trip? Back so soon?” Olivia asked, puzzled. But seeing Isabella’s stormy expression, she took a step back.

Isabella tried to stay calm, sizing up Olivia. “What are you doing at home?”

“Uh… watching a movie.” Olivia replied, trying to sound casual.

Isabella had planned a grand event for them, a declaration of love in front of everyone. And here was Olivia, watching a movie instead of being there.

Furious, Isabella snatched the tablet from Olivia’s arms and tossed it aside. It hit the ground with a crack, the screen shattering.

“My tablet!” Olivia cried out, heartbroken.

If Isabella had looked back, she might have seen the event paused on the screen before it went dark. But she was too consumed by anger, stomping on the broken tablet for good measure.

“Isabella, how could you?”

Isabella raised her chin defiantly. “I did it, what of it?”

Olivia rolled her eyes. “Fine, I won’t argue. It’s your tablet anyway, break it if you want!”

“I’ll buy another! I’ve got money to burn!” Isabella retorted.

“Break whatever you want, just give me a heads up if you plan to throw me out. I can walk myself.”

Olivia tried to shut the door, but Isabella blocked it with her foot. “I want to throw you onto the bed!” she declared.

Olivia rolled her eyes. “Isabella, you come back and start yelling at me. What’s your deal?”

“Did you skip the event today?”

“Nope!”

Olivia was confused. If she had gone to see another guy, Isabella’s anger would make sense. But since she hadn’t, why was Isabella so upset?

Isabella clenched her fists. “Why didn’t you go?”

“I didn’t want you to get jealous,” Olivia fibbed with a nervous laugh.

“Olivia! Tell the truth!”

“I… I lost the ticket.” Olivia admitted, biting her lip and avoiding Isabella’s gaze.

Isabella knew Olivia too well. She couldn’t lie without fidgeting.

“Really lost it?” Isabella leaned closer.

“Really,” Olivia nodded, stepping back.

Trying to appear calm, Olivia released her grip on her clothes and looked up at Isabella with feigned indifference. “Honestly, losing the ticket made me sad!”

Isabella could see through Olivia’s act but decided not to push it. “I told the bodyguard to take you. Who was supposed to escort you? Couldn’t even keep track of a ticket?”

“It’s not the bodyguard’s fault! It was my mistake!” Olivia insisted.

“You’re defending him? I’ll find out who it was. If they failed, they’ll face the consequences according to my company’s rules.” Isabella turned to leave.

Panicked, Olivia grabbed Isabella’s sleeve. “No, please don’t!”

She didn’t know what the company’s rules were, but she assumed they’d be harsh.

Isabella paused, looking back at Olivia. “Ready to tell the truth?”

“I, I…”

A breeze wafted in, carrying a hint of cologne. Olivia sniffed and frowned. It was coming from Isabella.

“You never wear cologne. What’s up with that?”

Isabella looked uneasy. “Now it’s my turn to question you!”

“You tell me first, then I’ll tell you!” Olivia countered.

Isabella wanted to walk away but was too curious about why Olivia missed the event. Plus, the cologne needed explaining before it caused more trouble.

“It’s not another woman’s!” Isabella said awkwardly.

“I know,” Olivia replied, blinking innocently.

“Then why ask?” Isabella snapped.

“I can tell the difference between cologne and perfume. It’s cologne. Maybe you—”

“No, it’s not like that! You know I’m not into guys. Want me to prove it?” Isabella took a step closer.

“No, no!” Olivia waved her hands, backing up with a mix of humor and exasperation. “Isabella, your imagination’s gone wild since you got back!”

“You didn’t think that?” Isabella asked, confused.

“No!” Olivia shook her head.

Isabella felt a wave of relief, though his face showed annoyance. "I explained, now your turn! Why didn’t you go to the event? Where’s the ticket?"

“Why do you care if I went?” Olivia shot back.

“It was my ticket! Of course, I care!” Isabella barked.

Probably upset because his carefully planned event was missed, Olivia thought, feeling a pang of jealousy. With a nonchalant smile, she said, “I sold it.”

“You sold it?” Isabella’s fist tightened, veins popping on his hand.

“Yes, for six hundred bucks! A hundred over the original price, a great deal!”

“Do you love money that much?” Isabella’s voice was suddenly low.

“Yes!” Olivia’s heart skipped a beat, but she stuck to her story.

“Whoosh—”

Isabella suddenly threw a wad of cash at Olivia, the bills raining down on her.

“You love money? Take it! I’ve got plenty! But why sell the ticket?”

Olivia watched the cascade of bills with a bitter smile. She knew the gap between them, trying to stay independent by not using his money. She believed they were equals, not her relying on his wealth.

But now, he was throwing money at her, humiliating her.

The money scattered like a red rain, covering the floor.

Olivia’s face turned cold, a distant look in her eyes. She met Isabella’s gaze with silent defiance.

“Isabella, I do love money, and there’s nothing wrong with that! You were born with a silver spoon, never knowing poverty. Don’t judge me from your high horse!

I want money, but I’ve never compromised myself for it! I’m not as smart as you, selling software for millions, but every penny I have, I earned with hard work!

It’s little, but it’s clean. Who are you to look down on me? To insult me?” Olivia’s words came out like rapid fire.

Isabella realized he had gone too far. “I…”

But Olivia spun on her heel, running to her room and slamming the door behind her.

“Bam!”
