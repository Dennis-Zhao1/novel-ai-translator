"Hey, you can't touch her!" Isabella Peterson's voice cut through the air, startling Olivia Stewart so much that she forgot her initial indignation. Was he... actually concerned about her?

Isabella pulled out a pristine cotton handkerchief, carefully dabbing the tears from Olivia's lashes. His face still bore a look of disdain, but his hands were gentle, treating her like a delicate piece of porcelain. The more he wiped, the more Olivia's tears flowed, seemingly endless.

When the entire handkerchief was soaked, Isabella stopped, glaring at Olivia with annoyance. "Are your tears that cheap? Don't dirty my handkerchief!" Olivia bit her lip, stubbornly forcing back her tears.

Isabella scrutinized Olivia's face, ensuring no tears had wet her wounds. Satisfied, he tossed the handkerchief aside and pulled her onto the couch, firmly seating her on his lap. Olivia struggled, but Isabella leaned in, his deep voice tickling her ear, "Do you want me to take care of you right now?"

Heaven knows how much he wanted to! Olivia immediately froze, too scared to move.

Silence enveloped them, with only their breaths filling the room. After a while, Isabella broke the quiet, his voice resigned, "Olivia Stewart, are you an idiot? How can my woman be so dumb?"

Olivia shot back, "Who's dumb? Who's the idiot?"

Seriously, would it kill him not to insult her?

"Getting bullied like this! Doesn't that count as dumb or idiotic?"

Isabella turned her to face him, his handsome features marred by anger. Olivia lowered her eyes, her voice soft, "She didn't gain anything either! She ended up with a broken bone!"

Isabella scoffed, "That's it?"

Olivia looked up, her eyebrows arching like tiny question marks. What else should she do?

With a flick of his finger, Isabella knocked on Olivia's forehead, "You should've scratched that woman's face to pieces!"

Olivia winced, covering her forehead, speechless.

Another knock followed, though much lighter this time. "You still won't admit you're dumb! A broken bone can heal, but what if your face gets scarred? Why act tough? If you can't win, run! Don't you know how to call for backup? Is your man dead? Why didn't you call me for help?"

Though Isabella's words were filled with disdain, warmth spread through Olivia's heart. Was he upset she didn't come to him first? This stubborn, awkward man!

After Isabella finished his lecture, Olivia gently placed her hand on his, looking up with a sudden smile.

"You dare to smile? Mess up your face again, and I'll throw you out!"

"Isabella Peterson, I know you care about me. Don't worry, it's just a small issue. The doctor said there won't be any scars. As for Sarah Moore, I'll handle it myself. I hope you won't interfere!"

"Olivia Stewart! You've got some nerve, huh?"

His voice was full of irritation. Seriously, was she so foolish that she wouldn't rely on her own support?

Seeing Isabella's anger, Olivia quickly clung to his arm, acting coquettishly, "Let me handle it this once, please? Pretty please?"

Isabella looked down, his gaze intense as he stared at Olivia.

"You think looking at your ugly face, I can resist?"

Despite his words, his lips quickly found hers, capturing them with precision.

"Mmm..."

Olivia's fists pressed against Isabella's chest, her long lashes fluttering as she widened her eyes in surprise. Didn't he say he couldn't?

Isabella covered her eyes, deepening the kiss while mumbling, "This mouth barely meets my taste."

This man was just...

Olivia struggled briefly, but Isabella's grip tightened, pulling her closer. He kissed her with an urgency like a parched man in a desert finding water.

Her fists gradually relaxed, wrapping around his back as she responded passionately.

Isabella Peterson, did you know? I've missed you so much during these days apart.

The expansive room was silent, save for the soft glow of the chandelier highlighting their entwined silhouettes, as the temperature continued to rise.

"Sir!"

A voice interrupted them at the worst possible moment.

Isabella ignored it, but Olivia, with her thin skin, began to pull away. Isabella's domineering nature left her little room to refuse. He pushed her into the couch and followed her down.

An intruding servant should've taken the hint, right?

Yet, the voice persisted, a hint of urgency in its tone, "Sir!"

Isabella was furious, not bothering to turn, "Get lost!"

"Sir, you can't..."

Olivia, regaining clarity, blushed furiously and pushed against Isabella. "Get up! If Lucas Wright is looking for you, it must be urgent!"

Unless it was a matter of life and death, why would the old man disturb them now?

"Olivia Stewart! Do you want him to have something urgent now?"

Olivia turned her face away, embarrassed. Could she admit she was ready to surrender?

Isabella's mood was completely ruined, his handsome face darkening with anger. Reluctantly, he released Olivia and sat up, grabbing a nearby pillow and hurling it at Lucas, then kicking over the coffee table, roaring, "Speak!"

If this wasn't crucial, I'd tear you to pieces, old man!

Lucas shrank back under Isabella's murderous gaze, daring not to meet his eyes. He sneaked a glance at Olivia, as if gathering the courage to speak, "Sir, the doctor instructed that Olivia's face needs proper care to avoid scarring. She can't consume anything with dye, use harsh skincare products, or..."

"Get to the point! Did they say you can't sleep together?"

"Uh, no, they didn't."

Isabella kicked out at Lucas, "Get lost! Go die!"

Even a mock kick made Lucas stumble back, falling to the ground.

Seeing Isabella turn back to Olivia, Lucas scrambled to his feet, shouting, "Sir, no! The doctor said Olivia mustn't sweat! Sweat is the worst for her wounds!"

Isabella froze, caught in an awkward position, unable to move.

After a long pause, he muttered, "Shit!"

Olivia, curled up on the couch in embarrassment, couldn't help a quiet laugh at Isabella's frustrated outburst.

"You dare laugh?"

Isabella grabbed Olivia's neck, "Do you believe I'll take care of you now?"

Olivia froze, not daring to move. Though his grip was gentle, his fierce gaze was far more terrifying!

One wrong move, and she'd be in big trouble!

Isabella's grip softened, his hand lingering, caressing repeatedly.

Olivia squirmed uncomfortably under his touch.

Isabella leaned in, his voice a low, seductive whisper, "What if I promise not to make you sweat?"

Boomâ€”

Olivia's face turned beet red, a lovely blush spreading down her neck. Her mind went blank, with only his words echoing: not to make you sweat...

Her mouth opened slightly, but no words came out.

"Damn it!"

Isabella suddenly cursed, jumping up and rushing upstairs.

Watching him flee, Olivia felt a pang of emotion.

He resisted for her sake, didn't he? But was it for her, or for her face that resembled someone else?

Olivia gently touched her cheek, lowering her eyes, her gaze dimming.

"Olivia Stewart, I'm sorry. I know you two are like newlyweds, but for the best recovery, I had to play the bad guy!"

Lucas Wright apologized, bowing to Olivia.

Embarrassed, she leaped up to support him, "Lucas, please don't say that, I know you're looking out for me!"

Lucas deftly avoided her help, standing straight, his face lined with worry.

"The young master surely hates me now. Please, Olivia, speak on my behalf!"

Olivia nodded, "Don't worry, Lucas, I won't let Isabella punish you!"

Lucas finally breathed a sigh of relief, slipping away before Isabella returned.

Alone on the couch, Olivia sighed softly.

The household knew she lived with Isabella, but no one knew they hadn't taken that final step. Though they'd come close several times, something always interrupted. Maybe they just weren't ready yet.

After all, he had his issues, and she had her concerns.

Half an hour later, Isabella emerged from a cold shower, spotting Olivia. He flashed a mischievous grin, "I thought of a solution!"
