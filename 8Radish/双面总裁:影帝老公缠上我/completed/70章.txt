**The Punishment from Lucas Cooper**

Isabella Peterson's fiery anger deflated faster than a popped balloon as she stood there, staring blankly at Olivia Stewart's closed bedroom door. "That little spitfire's got a temper bigger than mine!" she mumbled.

Lucas Wright stood nearby, watching the battlefield left by the two household divas. He quietly shuffled his feet backward, desperately trying to disappear into the background. No matter how angry Lucas Cooper got, he couldn't bring himself to truly punish Olivia Stewart. But for the rest of them? That was a whole different story.

Sure enough, Isabella Peterson's sharp gaze caught Lucas Wright's movement. "Lucas Wright!" she snapped.

Lucas had no choice but to step forward. "Yes, ma'am?"

"Who took Olivia Stewart to the event today?" Isabella demanded.

As Lucas was about to name the bodyguard, Olivia Stewart's door swung open. She stood there, hands on her hips, glaring daggers at Isabella.

"I told you it's not the bodyguard's fault. Are you done yet?"

Isabella squinted, dangerous sparks flashing in her eyes. This girl had the audacity to challenge her? Unbelievable!

"Olivia Stewart, are you really going to defend that bodyguard with your life?" Isabella's temper was reaching a boiling point.

"Yes!" Olivia confirmed boldly.

"Are you interested in him or something?" Isabella's anger was serious business!

"No!" Olivia was exasperated. This person was impossible!

"Then why?" Isabella pressed on.

"If you punish him, everyone will know being around me means trouble. Then no one will want to be with me!" Olivia explained, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.

Isabella was at a loss for words, feeling like she was punching air. Completely ineffective.

Lucas was trying hard not to laugh, hiding his amusement behind a poker face. Olivia Stewart was fearless! Even someone as domineering as Isabella was being tamed by her.

But Lucas Cooper wasn't finished. He stepped forward, his tall frame looming over Olivia. His face was unreadable, devoid of any emotion.

"If you don't want me to punish him, then maybe I should punish you?"

"Do it then!" Olivia stood her ground with a brave face. But inside, she was terrified, cold sweat trickling down her back.

Isabella saw the fear in her eyes and found it both infuriating and amusing. This girl, pretending to be brave when she was scared out of her wits.

But if she didn't teach her a lesson, wouldn't Olivia walk all over her in the future?

Isabella reached out, and Olivia instinctively closed her eyes, her small frame trembling.

What was he going to do? Slap her? Twist her ear?

"Ah!"

Suddenly, Olivia was pulled forward and ended up draped across Isabella's long legs, almost kissing the carpet.

"Get me up, Isabella! This is uncomfortable!" Olivia protested, trying to twist her face away.

"Smack!"

A sharp slap landed on her behind, both embarrassing and painful.

"Isabella, what are you doing?" Olivia's face burned with embarrassment as she yelled.

"Didn't you want me to punish you? Or do you not want to sell tickets anymore?" Isabella remarked with a straight face.

"Smack!"

Another slap, harder and louder this time.

"Ouch... Isabella, stop it! I was wrong!" Olivia squirmed and pleaded.

Getting spanked like a kid at her age? How humiliating!

"Smack!"

"Still protecting that foolish bodyguard?"

"Smack!"

"Still challenging me?"

"Wah... Isabella, please have mercy! I'm wrong, really wrong! I won't dare to upset you again!"

Olivia lay across Isabella's legs, crying her heart out. Why did she try to act tough?

Lucas looked on, his eyebrows furrowed in sympathy. Isabella adored Olivia, but when it came to discipline, she didn't hold back. Those smacks looked painful!

In truth, Isabella wasn't hitting hard, just enough to make Olivia feel it. Otherwise, one real slap and she'd be out of commission.

Seeing Olivia had learned her lesson, Isabella lifted her. But Olivia shrieked, "Isabella, no! I'd rather you throw money at me!"

"Pfft—" Lucas burst out laughing.

Isabella's knee buckled, and Olivia slipped off, landing on the carpet with a thud.

"Oof..."

Isabella picked her up again, and Olivia trembled like a leaf. "Isabella, you're not going to flip me and spank me again, are you?"

Isabella's hand paused, his eyes flickering with an unreadable emotion. Imagining the scene, he nodded seriously, "No, I'll use something else."

"Ahhh!" Olivia covered her face, wailing loudly. "If you hit me, I'll cry!"

Isabella frowned, and Lucas almost wished for earplugs.

"Fine, I won't hit you!"

"Really?"

Olivia's tears stopped abruptly as she shifted gears, her expression changing in an instant.

Isabella signaled Lucas, who quickly brought over a chair. Isabella sat, placing Olivia on his knee, like a stern parent scolding a child.

"Will you sell my gifts again?"

Olivia shook her head vigorously. "Never, never!"

"Will you speak up for other men?"

"Never, never!"

"Will you challenge me?"

"Never, never!"

"Will you lock me out again?"

"Never, never!"

"Will you let me kiss you?"

"Never, never—uh, I mean, sometimes!"

"Sometimes?"

Olivia quickly corrected herself, "Anytime!"

"That's more like it."

Isabella reached out, and Olivia flinched, hissing softly.

"Does it hurt?"

"It hurts! A lot!" Try it yourself!

Olivia pouted, looking at Isabella with big, teary eyes.

"Let me rub it for you."

"Uh... better not!"

That area wasn't exactly rub-friendly. What if something happened?

Olivia blushed, pushing away Isabella's hand, then hesitated and pulled back, sneaking a glance at his expression.

Isabella's mouth twitched slightly. This girl was truly scared today!

Maybe it was for the best. She wouldn't lock him out every night as if he were a thief.

Isabella sighed, a hint of tenderness in his eyes. He gently ruffled Olivia's hair. "Today... I was wrong. I shouldn't have thrown money at you."

Olivia's eyes filled with tears, spilling over her cheeks.

She hadn't cried when she was scolded, but now she couldn't stop.

"But do you know why I was angry?"

Olivia looked up, puffing her cheeks stubbornly.

Why? Because another woman stood him up, and he needed a scapegoat!

"Olivia, loving money isn't a crime. Who doesn't love money? Even I do. But you know what? Men are born to earn it, women to spend it. You don't need to work so hard."

"You say you feel better spending your own money. Fine, I'll respect that. But do you think my money is dirty?"

Olivia hesitated, "I... I don't think that."

"That's exactly what you think! Otherwise, you wouldn't be so adamant about keeping our finances separate. Olivia, rejecting my money means rejecting my feelings!"

What a crazy theory! Doesn't money talk ruin relationships?

"Olivia, if you saw us as one, you wouldn't mind spending my money. You'd think of it as yours. But you don't. You're always distancing yourself, preparing to leave cleanly one day."

Olivia stared at Isabella, stunned.

Weren't men with high IQs supposed to have low EQs? This guy was too perceptive!

"Am I right?"

Olivia lowered her head.

She admitted it. Isabella was right.

She had always thought that way.

Knowing she was just a stand-in, she ignored her boundaries to be with Isabella, wanting to follow her heart.

But she was also prepared to leave him one day.

Because she didn't know when the real one would appear.

Or when Isabella might find a better stand-in.

Olivia felt uncertain, very uncertain.

Isabella set Olivia on her feet. "Go rest."

His voice was soft, tinged with an indescribable sadness.

Olivia's heart ached.

It was a pain she couldn't describe, worse than the spanking or having money thrown at her.

"Isabella, I..."

She opened her mouth but didn't know what to say.

Isabella turned away, leaving her with only his lonely silhouette.

Olivia felt terrible.

She feared his anger, but seeing him so disappointed and distant was worse.

How could she fix this mess?
