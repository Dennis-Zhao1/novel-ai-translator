Chapter One

"Someone tried to commit suicide?"

Olivia Stewart jolted at the thought, her head snapping up as a crowd rushed down the hallway to the left. Her mom's hospital room was that way!

Without a moment to spare, Olivia dashed upstairs, tears forgotten. It turned out the commotion was caused by Sophia Allen, and Olivia's father, James Cook, was there too.

Seeing her father in the hospital room was a rare sight. Olivia hurried over and asked, "Dad, what's going on?"

"Smack!" James Cook's reaction was immediate—a slap across her face. "I told you to take care of your mom! Where were you? She just drank poison! If she dies, it's your fault!"

Olivia was stunned by the slap, her mind focused on Sophia Allen's safety. It didn't even occur to her to wonder where the poison came from in the first place.

A doctor approached them. "The patient ingested a large amount of poison and needs immediate gastric lavage and dialysis. You need to pay now! You're already a week behind on medical bills. If you delay any longer, the hospital will stop treatment."

James Cook's drunken eyes glared at Olivia. "Well, what are you waiting for?"

Olivia, clutching her swollen cheek, felt tears of frustration welling up. "We have no money left."

"Then find a way! Your mom's in this mess because of you. If you can't get the money to save her, you'll be the one who killed her."

Olivia stumbled out of the hospital, her legs heavy as lead. Where was she supposed to get the money? Ask her boyfriend, Christopher Davis? But he was just a college student interning out of town, barely making ends meet himself.

With no other options, Olivia stood outside the hospital's payment window, clutching Mrs. Peterson's phone number tightly. "Christopher, I'm sorry!" she whispered.

Mrs. Peterson arrived quickly after Olivia called, paying the $3,000 needed for the emergency and dialysis, clearing the previous outstanding medical bills, too.

Olivia looked at Mrs. Peterson with gratitude. "Thank you so much!"

Mrs. Peterson gently patted Olivia's shoulder. "Don't worry too much. I'm not here to force you into anything. Consider this money as a sponsorship."

Olivia bit her lip. "Mrs. Peterson, when my mom gets better, I'll find a way to repay you!"

Rushing back upstairs, Olivia received news from the emergency room: Sophia Allen had been stabilized, but the poison had left her life hanging by a thread. She needed surgery immediately, which would cost $30,000.

Thirty thousand dollars!

Panicked, Olivia raced downstairs and caught Mrs. Peterson just as she was about to leave. "Please wait, Mrs. Peterson! I'll be your son's girlfriend! But could you please pay me three months' salary in advance?"

A subtle smile crossed Mrs. Peterson's face as she elegantly pulled a card from her purse, giving instructions to the butler next to her. "Alfred, help Olivia pay the medical bills."

"Yes, ma'am!" Alfred obeyed and went on his way.

"Thank you, Mrs. Peterson, thank you!" Olivia, overwhelmed with gratitude, held onto Mrs. Peterson's sleeve.

Mrs. Peterson gently freed her sleeve, her face remaining kind. "Rest assured, my butler will handle everything for you. Your mom will have the best care. Now, come with me."

Olivia glanced anxiously toward the emergency room. "Can I at least..."

Mrs. Peterson's finely sculpted face turned displeased. "Alfred will inform you of any updates."

Reluctantly, Olivia followed Mrs. Peterson. The Petersons owned a beautiful three-story house in the town's serene southern part, complete with a spacious garden full of exotic flowers—a true retreat!

Mrs. Peterson led Olivia to a guest room, her demeanor shifting back to her usual cold elegance. She pulled out some papers from her bag and tossed them to Olivia. "Since you've agreed to be my son's girlfriend, let's sign the contract first."

Olivia's hand trembled slightly as she looked at the "Rental Girlfriend Agreement," pushing down the shame bubbling inside her.

"Let me be clear," Mrs. Peterson began. "My son is proud and aloof. If he finds out you're a hired girlfriend, he won't accept it. So you'll enter as a caregiver, gradually showing interest in him, pursuing him, and dating him. You can't let him suspect anything, and you must break up with your current boyfriend immediately. Otherwise, I'll withdraw my sponsorship of your mom's medical bills at any time."

"Okay!" Olivia picked up the pen with shaky hands.

At this point, she had no other choice. She hadn't expected Mrs. Peterson's change in demeanor; perhaps her earlier kindness was just an act.

"Oh, and your name is too plain. When my son recovers from surgery, I don't want him to find you, so pick something artsy and fresh, something unique in this town!"

After some thought, Olivia wrote "Bianca White" on the agreement.

Mrs. Peterson proudly took the contract. "My son is upstairs. If you can't win his approval, this agreement can end at any time."

Olivia clenched her fist. "I'll do my best!"

Upstairs, Olivia met Mrs. Peterson's son—Isabella Peterson.

He sat by the window, the sunlight casting a golden glow on his perfectly chiseled profile. Until now, Olivia thought her boyfriend Christopher Davis was the most handsome guy she knew. But meeting Isabella Peterson changed that. He was stunningly beautiful, like a work of art crafted by the finest artisan.

Olivia was a sucker for good looks, and Isabella's appearance left her breathless.

Sensing a new presence, Isabella turned, his indifferent gaze landing on Olivia's mesmerized face. He immediately frowned in disgust. "Get out!"

"Uh..." Olivia blushed, stammering, "I-I'm the new caregiver. My name is Bianca White. You and I... we're quite fated, aren't we?"

Her nerves made her forget the lines she had rehearsed.

Olivia bit her lip and twisted the hem of her shirt anxiously.

"I don't need you! Leave!" Isabella's voice was cold, and he turned his wheelchair away.

Definitely not easy to approach!

Olivia had wondered why Isabella, with his intact limbs, used a wheelchair. The doctor explained that his heart was too weak to handle much physical activity, and the wheelchair helped reduce the strain, extending his life by two years.

Olivia's gaze softened with sympathy as she looked at his slender back. Just twenty years old, with a future so uncertain.

Perhaps her gaze was too intense, or maybe Isabella was just too sensitive. He suddenly turned back, throwing a glass at her feet. "I don't need your pity, leave!"

Olivia shrieked and backed away, tempted to leave right then. But thoughts of her mom's surgery and Isabella's grim life made her pause.

"Isabella..."

"Leave!"

Olivia turned and ran out.

Isabella clenched his fists on his lap, hearing her footsteps fade away. Another girl scared off by him!

He was just a burden to everyone.

In his world, only his mother mattered; everyone else was irrelevant.

Soon, the sound of footsteps returned. Isabella glanced sideways to see Bianca running back with a broom and dustpan. Her hurried breathing brought a rosy glow to her fair cheeks, making her look like an appetizing apple, tempting enough to bite into!

This girl radiated youth and vitality, highlighting Isabella's bleak existence, like a fading old man.

Isabella pounded his fist on the wheelchair. "Didn't you hear me? I said leave!"

Olivia quickly cleaned up the broken glass, put the broom and dustpan away, and then stood before Isabella. Her face no longer showed the earlier embarrassment; instead, she stood defiantly, hands on her hips, her cheeks flushed with determination. "No way!"

Isabella frowned. Usually, one scolding was enough to make the caregivers run away crying. But this girl was different—stubborn!

Isabella glared at Olivia, but she remained unfazed. Her bright eyes sparkled with mischief as she grinned at him, "You want me gone? Your mom's paying me a hefty salary, why would I leave? Do I look stupid to you? You don't need my care? Fine! Just treat me like I'm not here. I'll clock out when my shift ends."

With that, Olivia ignored Isabella, grabbing the fruit platter and settling into a rocking chair by the window. She took a big bite of an apple, chewing loudly.

Her eating was anything but graceful, like she hadn't eaten in days!

Isabella looked at her with disdain but couldn't help watching her expressive face.

If he were a healthy man, would he be tempted to flirt with her like the other rich guys?

Flirt with her!

Realizing what he was thinking, Isabella quickly averted his gaze, a faint blush creeping onto his cheeks.

Olivia caught his expression from the corner of her eye and chuckled silently.

Oh, this little prince is quite the innocent one, blushing like that!

Olivia felt a sense of triumph in teasing the handsome guy, her spirits lifting as she lounged in the rocking chair, munching her apple and humming a tune.
