The helicopter's blades whirred above the windswept grass, mirroring Olivia Stewart's tumultuous emotions. She took a deep breath, adjusted her windswept hair, and stepped into the cabin.

"Finally, Mom! You took forever!" her daughter, Ava, playfully whined, though her voice carried a hint of sweetness.

Olivia glanced up, startled to see Isabella Peterson seated inside. Wait, wasn't he supposed to be tied up with work today? Had he witnessed the whole scene with Ethan King? The kiss, the embrace?

Her cheeks flushed as her eyes darted around, hesitant to meet Isabella's gaze. But when she finally did, she found herself unable to look away, as if drawn by an invisible force. He seemed even more handsome than she remembered, the years adding a layer of maturity and strength to his already magnetic presence.

It had been three long years since she'd last seen him. She'd spent those years wrapped in a self-imposed isolation, her world dark and silent until Isabella had sent the twins, Ava and Leo, to light her way back to life. Yet, this man, the one she most longed to see and yet feared encountering, was now right in front of her.

Isabella's eyes never left Olivia, filled with an emotion that had only intensified over a thousand days and nights. He'd come to understand the pain of longing down to his very bones, an ache that was both mental and physical.

If it weren't for the twins, Isabella would have likely swept Olivia into his arms the moment she stepped in. But he held back, struggling to maintain control over the impulse to embrace her tightly.

Ava's curious eyes flicked between her parents. "What are you looking at? Is Dad too handsome, or does Mom have something on her face?"

Her innocent commentary broke the spell, drawing Olivia's attention back to reality. She blushed deeply, while Isabella shot a playful glare at Ava for interrupting.

Ava stuck out her tongue and retreated to her brother Leo's side, leaving Olivia standing awkwardly in the center of the cabin. Isabella crossed the space in two strides, gently pulling her into a long-awaited embrace.

It had been three years since they had held each other. Isabella's arms encircled Olivia with a cautious tenderness, ready to release her should she feel the slightest discomfort. But Olivia melted into him, wrapping her arms around his waist and resting her head against his firm chest, savoring the sound of his heartbeat.

Isabella's heart soared with joy, indescribable and overwhelming. He tightened his hold and lifted her chin, capturing her lips with a kiss that conveyed all the passion and yearning that had built up over the years.

At first, Olivia hesitated, mindful of the children's presence, but soon she was swept away, responding with equal fervor.

Leo, engrossed in his book, seemed oblivious, while Ava watched with a mix of curiosity and surprise. "Are they eating each other's faces? I can't see them anymore!"

Her innocent observation made Olivia break away, her face a deep shade of red. Isabella chuckled at Ava's candidness.

"Not eating, just kissing," Isabella explained with a grin. "See, Mom's mouth is still there."

Ava peered closer to confirm, and Olivia wished she could disappear, while Isabella laughed heartily.

He leaned in and whispered to Olivia, "I'll let you off for now, but tonight, we'll continue this."

Olivia blushed even more, while Ava, ever the inquisitive child, asked, "Dad, are you going to eat Mom's ear too?"

Olivia's embarrassment knew no bounds, and Isabella laughed again, his joy infectious. "No, sweetheart, just more kisses. See, Mom's ears are safe!"

Ava tilted her head, satisfied with his answer, and Olivia couldn't help but smile. Despite the chaos and confusion, she felt a warmth spreading through her heart. She was finally home.
