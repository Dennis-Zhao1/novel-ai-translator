The Uncompromising Heart

Two kids continued playing with clay as Olivia Stewart pondered deeply, leaving the pottery studio in silence. As she walked, a warm, comforting hand suddenly clasped her cold one, sending a wave of warmth from her fingertips straight to her heart.

Looking up, Olivia saw Isabella Peterson gazing at her with a gentle expression. "Not happy?" Isabella asked softly.

Olivia shook her head. "No, it's just that I thought giving them time to adjust on their own would work. But I didn't expect the kids to struggle getting along!"

Isabella's eyes darkened with a hint of guilt. "I bear some responsibility for this," he admitted in his gravelly voice, tinged with apology.

Olivia looked at him, confusion written all over her face. Isabella averted his gaze, unable to meet her eyes. "Actually, I never told you, but while you were away at the ranch, I sent Tommy to a boarding school instead of leaving him at home."

"But I did my research. It's one of the best in the country," he added quickly. "I hired someone to take care of him and even arranged for a renowned counselor to help him with any emotional issues."

"It's not that I dislike Tommy. I admit I was upset when he almost pushed Gavin into the pond, causing you to faint. But I hold no grudge against him."

"Back then, you were in a fragile state, and I was worried. With the twins also sent to the ranch, I didn't think I could provide for him as well as the school could."

"So, Tommy's been at that boarding school all these years, and I only brought him back when you returned. I understand why he might be upset with me, but I didn't expect him to dislike the twins too."

"Maybe he never liked them because, in his eyes, they took away the love that should have been his," Isabella finished, realizing too late that Olivia’s face had fallen.

"I'm sorry, Olivia. I didn't mean to speak ill of Tommy," Isabella quickly apologized, the once proud and aloof man now humble and apologetic for the sake of a child.

Olivia’s heart ached at the sight. She gently caressed his sharp, lean cheek and smiled faintly. "Isabella, you don’t need to be so cautious around me."

"Don’t worry. Since I've come to terms with everything, I won't shut myself away again. I understand Tommy’s issues but I couldn’t resolve them. So, it's not your fault. It's mine."

"In trying to make amends, I may have fueled his darker thoughts. I was so focused on protecting him that I ignored your feelings. Your patience and sacrifices for me mean the world."

"As for Tommy..." Olivia frowned, feeling a wave of helplessness wash over her. "I’ll do my best to care for him and melt away his coldness. Hopefully, he’ll understand when he’s older."

Isabella placed a supportive hand on Olivia's shoulder. "We’ll work on this together."

"Yes," she nodded, leaning into Isabella's shoulder, finding solace in his presence.

After a stroll through the garden, Olivia and Isabella found Tommy. The young boy, with a hint of softness in his features, sat on a row of white chairs, holding a book but staring blankly into the distance.

Olivia motioned for Isabella to stop, whispering that she’d go alone. Isabella nodded, offering a reassuring smile.

She approached Tommy, preferring to speak to him one-on-one. His resemblance to Alexander Peterson had grown, and she feared Isabella might feel uncomfortable despite his assurances otherwise.

Hearing the soft footsteps, Tommy looked up and stood, politely greeting Olivia, "Auntie."

Her heart twisted at the formal title. As his mother figure, she felt ashamed. Though they both understood their relationship, she didn’t dare insist on being called "mom," especially knowing Isabella would hear.

Yet, it felt unfair for Tommy to address her so distantly, unlike the twins.

Olivia rubbed her temples, realizing that as long as Tommy’s identity lingered, so would this dilemma. She needed to change her mindset and give more love to those who needed it.

It was absurd how she failed to see this sooner, wasting three precious years.

Olivia looked at Tommy with warmth and compassion. He blushed slightly, glancing away awkwardly.

"Auntie, did you need something?" Tommy asked.

Olivia took his hand, sitting him down. "Tommy, you’ve grown so much. I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you these past years."

Her words, heartfelt and sincere, seemed to soften Tommy’s icy demeanor.

"Auntie, I don’t blame you. I couldn’t be with you when you were sick," he said, his voice tinged with regret.

Olivia understood his unspoken resentment. If she’d been more present, she would have ensured all three kids grew up together at the ranch. But it was too late now.

All she could do was melt away his bitterness with warmth before it hardened into something worse.

She gently ruffled his hair. "How was your time at the boarding school?"

"I’m fine," Tommy replied truthfully. The school was top-notch, and Isabella’s connections ensured he was well-cared for, at least materially.

But on weekends or holidays, seeing other kids picked up by their parents, he couldn’t help feeling lonely.

Olivia noticed the unwelcome maturity in his expression and smoothed out the creases on his forehead. "Now that I’m back, I’ll take care of you. We can find a school closer to home."

Without hesitation, Tommy replied, "No, I want to go back to the boarding school."

Olivia frowned in surprise. If he stayed at the boarding school, he’d drift further from the family.

"Why, Tommy? Is there something you don’t like at home?" she asked softly.

Tommy shook his head. "No, it’s just..."

I feel like I don’t belong here, he thought but didn’t say. Instead, he gave a more acceptable reason. "I think you’re already tired taking care of the twins."

"Tommy, you’re so considerate," Olivia said, tearing up as she hugged him gently.

"I’m not tired. As long as you and the twins are happy, I’ll never be tired."

Tommy stiffly leaned against her, unfamiliar with such warmth after so much isolation.

Olivia spent the day in the garden talking with Tommy. Afterward, he seemed to get along better with the twins, who happily called him big brother. While they didn’t always play together, it was a start.

Watching Tommy’s calm, distant face, Olivia knew she had a long road ahead to truly reach his heart. His actions reflected her expectations, not his genuine feelings.

Fortunately, Isabella was always by her side, offering encouragement and treating all three kids fairly, even when Tommy remained indifferent.

During those times, Olivia felt an overwhelming tenderness for Isabella.

Sensing her mood, Isabella would mischievously whisper in her ear, "How about you make it up to me tonight?"
