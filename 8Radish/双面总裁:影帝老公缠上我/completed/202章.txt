In the bustling café, Olivia Stewart sat across from Ethan King, watching him chug down cup after cup of bitter coffee with a furrowed brow. Her heart raced with worry.

"Ethan, seriously, what's going on with you? Say something, will ya?" she urged him, her voice tinged with concern. "Is it that annoying Lisa again? I can help you deal with her!"

Ethan remained silent, his eyes fixed intensely on his cup, and Olivia felt a wave of panic. "Are you mad at me, or... did you have a breakup?"

Her last question seemed to hit a nerve. Ethan looked up, his gaze suddenly piercing.

Olivia’s heart skipped a beat. Oh no, did she just accidentally hit the nail on the head?

"Ethan, you really..." she hesitated, her voice trailing off into a soft whisper.

"In your eyes, have you ever seen me as a normal guy?" Ethan asked, his voice quiet but firm, as he took another swig of his coffee.

Olivia propped her chin up with her hand, considering. "I think you're pretty normal! You're a stand-up guy with a good head on your shoulders."

Ethan's eyes bore into hers. "You know that's not what I mean."

"Okay, fine, maybe you come across as a bit soft-spoken," Olivia admitted, recalling that Ethan had always been gentler than most guys. "But I don't mind. I mean, I never thought of it as a bad thing."

Suddenly, Ethan grabbed her arm, his eyes glinting with a fierce intensity. "I asked you here to tell you that I'm not like that. I never was."

Olivia blinked, her mouth half-open in shock.

Ethan leaned forward, lifting her chin with a gentle but firm hand. Before she knew it, his lips were on hers.

Startled, Olivia pushed him away. "Ethan! What the heck are you doing? Get a grip, have you lost your mind?"

Ethan stumbled back, hitting the chair behind him, his eyes clouding with a mix of frustration and hurt. "I'm going crazy! Watching you with other guys, my heart feels like it's being torn apart and grilled over open flames! Olivia Stewart, I've liked you for so long! Can't you tell?"

His voice rose, the words tumbling out in a rush of pent-up emotion.

Olivia was stunned. Ethan had always been there for her, like a best friend, even more so than Isabella Peterson. She had always thought Ethan was just being a good friend, someone she could rely on.

But now, he was laying it all out there, and it shook her to the core.

"Ethan, are you serious?" she finally managed to ask, her voice barely above a whisper.

Ethan nodded, desperation in his eyes. "Come with me, leave Isabella Peterson. Let's just get away from all this. We can go live on a ranch or something. I promise you'll never want for anything."

Olivia's heart ached at the sincerity in Ethan's plea. But she shook her head, eyes glistening with unshed tears. "Ethan, I can't. I'm sorry. I've realized that I..."

Ethan interrupted, panic in his voice. "No, don't say it! Just end things with Isabella Peterson. I've got everything ready for you to break it off!"

He thrust a card into her hand, his eyes pleading.

Olivia looked at the card, feeling its weight like a thousand pounds in her palm. "Ethan, I can't take this."

He recoiled, almost like he'd been burned. "You have to! It's not for you, it's to pay off Isabella Peterson!"

His voice, edged with a sharpness that cut through the air, made Olivia's heart ache even more.

She gently placed the card back on the table, pushing it towards Ethan. "Thank you, Ethan. But I can't leave him."

"Why not?" Ethan was almost shouting now, his desperation turning to anger. "Isabella Peterson has a fiancée! He'll just toss you aside when he's bored!"

Tears welled up in Olivia's eyes as she finally spoke the truth. "Because I love him."

Ethan froze, disbelief etched on his face. "No, no, you can't. It hasn't been that long. You're just caught up in the moment. Come on, let's go."

He grabbed her hand, pulling her towards the door, determined to whisk her away from the tangled web they found themselves in.
