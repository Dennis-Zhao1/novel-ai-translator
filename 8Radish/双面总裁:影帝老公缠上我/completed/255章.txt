One thing about Olivia Stewart? She was always up for a challenge. Sitting by Isabella Peterson's hospital bed, she watched tearfully as her emotions spilled over, drop by drop, onto Isabella's peaceful face. His eyes were bandaged, and a hint of red seeped through the edges—a stark reminder of the accident.

The room was silent except for Olivia's soft sighs. She glanced at the bedside table where two broken blue contact lenses lay on a pristine saucer, casting a faint glow. Picking up a piece, she couldn't help but think how she should've connected the dots sooner. The familiarity she felt with him—it all made sense now.

Olivia tucked the broken lenses into a scarf and slipped them into her pocket. She turned her gaze back to Isabella, her heart swelling with affection. His hand was warm and reassuring in hers, and before she knew it, she drifted into a comforting sleep.

A slight movement woke her. "Isabella," she called softly, hopeful. "Are you awake?"

He stirred, reaching for his eyes but Olivia quickly stopped him. "Don't touch! Your eyes are injured. We don't want an infection."

Isabella paused, recalling the hazy details of the accident. "Olivia, I'm sorry," he muttered.

Olivia squeezed his hand tighter, brushing it against her cheek. "What are you apologizing for?"

"I messed up my first proposal," he said, regret lacing his voice.

She chuckled, wiping away her tears. "You can always try again when you’ve recovered."

"And if I do, will you say yes?"

"Well, that's for you to find out!" she teased.

"If my eyes heal, I'll propose again," he promised, his seriousness making her heart skip.

Olivia's mind raced. She knew Isabella was proud; if he couldn't see, he'd push her away to avoid pity. But love wasn't about pity—it was about genuine care.

"I'll propose to you if you don't," she declared boldly, trying to lighten the mood.

Isabella laughed, pulling her closer. "You really have no shame, do you?"

"Of course, I do! But I know you'll ask me eventually."

His mood lifted, Isabella wrapped an arm around her, resting his chin on her head. "Were you scared?"

"A little," she admitted. "But I'm okay now."

"Who do you prefer, the CEO or the movie star?"

She rolled her eyes at his jealousy. "Can I say both?"

"Nope."

"Isabella," she said, amused, "I only ever liked him because he reminded me of you."

That did it. Isabella felt content, showering her with playful kisses. But she dodged him, suddenly serious. "Why did you create this movie star persona and make everyone crazy over you?"

His face fell, realizing he had dug his own grave. "Uh, I'm tired. Need to sleep now," he said, pulling the covers over his head.

But Olivia wasn't letting him off that easily. She yanked the blanket back and playfully tugged his ear. "You made me explain everything during my acting days. What was your plan?"

Isabella grumbled, his face flushed. "I don't talk much. I just act."

And with that, he pulled her into his embrace, ignoring her playful protests. "My eyes are injured, but everything else works just fine," he teased.

Their private jet soared through the clouds, carrying them to safety. Meanwhile, the Peterson Group medical team was racing to their location to perform eye surgery on Isabella.

After a successful procedure, the expert advised, "The surgery went well, but the recovery is crucial. I suggest you head back to the Peterson estate."

Olivia nodded, urgency in her voice. "Lucas, contact the estate and prepare everything."

Lucas Wright hesitated, "But Olivia, the master has conditions."

She sighed, "If he wants me gone, I'll leave."

Lucas frowned, "He demands the marriage alliance with the White family continues for Isabella to recover there."

Olivia's eyes flashed with defiance. "Then we'll find another place with better facilities!"

Lucas shook his head, "No other team is as skilled, and the master can recall them at any time."

"Darn it!" Olivia cursed, frustration boiling over. "He'd let his son go blind for this?"

Lucas murmured, "The master is ruthless, except towards Isabella and his mother."

With determination, Olivia declared, "Fine, we'll go back. But once Isabella recovers, he decides his future."

Lucas sighed in relief, "I'll make the arrangements."

Soon, Isabella was back at the estate, under strict care. The master had hoped for a union with the Whites, but they vanished upon hearing Isabella might be blind.

In his office, Alexander Peterson smirked, knowing the master was in the hospital and he had control. But his mother, Faye, surprised him.

"Mother, you've arrived," he greeted, masking his surprise.

"I heard everything," she said, her gentle tone firm.

Alexander flinched but regained composure, helping her to a seat. "I'm managing things for uncle," he explained.

Faye's gaze was penetrating. "Alex, let it go. What isn't yours, don't covet."

His expression hardened, "Mother, focus on your peace. Leave these matters to me."
