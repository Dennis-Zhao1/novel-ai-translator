In the bustling dining room, Olivia Stewart sat quietly, her spoon moving almost mechanically as she picked at her meal. But her eyes, those bright, inquisitive eyes, were full of mischief and curiosity. She couldn't help but notice the odd dynamics at play around the table.

Isabella Peterson's father was there, and so was a woman named Fleur, who was supposedly her uncle's lady friend. The old man calling her by such an endearing name seemed a bit too familiar. It was like watching a soap opera unfold right in front of her. Clearly, there was some juicy backstory here.

Just as Olivia was lost in her own thoughts, a piece of steamed cod found its way into her bowl. She looked up, only to meet Isabella's deep, dark eyes.

"Dummy! You should eat more fish," Isabella chided, but there was a softness in her voice that spoke of a fondness that couldn't be hidden.

Olivia blushed, quickly shoveling the fish into her mouth to avoid the amused looks of the others at the table. Isabella's family meals were always an adventure, but this one was particularly tense.

The old man cleared his throat, his voice gentle yet carrying the authority of someone not to be trifled with. "It's just a family meal, Olivia. Don't be so nervous."

Olivia dared a glance at him, catching a glimpse of something cold and warning behind his seemingly kind eyes. She shivered slightly, quickly looking away.

Fleur, on the other hand, spoke with a gentle warmth that seemed to envelop the room. "Don't scare her like that. She's as adorable as she was years ago."

Olivia smiled sweetly at Fleur, which didn't go unnoticed by Isabella and his mother, Mrs. Peterson. Their faces darkened simultaneously, a scene that would be comical if it weren't so tense.

Mrs. Peterson's chest heaved with barely restrained anger. If not for the old man's intimidating presence, she might have caused a scene right there. Where did they find this woman? She seemed tailor-made to be the perfect romantic rival.

Nathan Peterson, sitting across the table, seemed oblivious to the tension, his mind working on its own schemes. Bringing his mother back had certainly stirred things up, and he was quite pleased with the chaos it would cause.

After dinner, the old man waved his hand dismissively. "Let's all take a break."

Olivia felt relief wash over her. This dinner had been stifling, and she couldn't wait to escape. Mrs. Peterson's glare had been fiercer than the old man's cold warnings. A family dinner? More like a showdown.

As soon as the old man left, Isabella stood, grabbing Olivia's hand without a backward glance. Just as they were about to leave, Mrs. Peterson's voice cut through the air. "Isabella! Come talk with me for a bit."

Isabella hesitated, then nodded. "Alright, let's go."

Olivia stayed rooted to the spot. Mrs. Peterson's dislike for her was no secret, and she wasn't about to walk into the lion's den willingly.

"Should I just head home?" Olivia asked Isabella, testing the waters.

Isabella shot her a look that brooked no argument. "Where I go, you go."

Mrs. Peterson sighed, clearly displeased but resigned. "Fine, come along then."

Olivia rolled her eyes internally. As if she wanted to be there! If it weren't for Isabella being his mom, she wouldn't bother.

As they walked out, they heard the old man inviting Fleur for a stroll. Mrs. Peterson muttered something about a "vixen," her irritation palpable.

Ahead, Fleur maintained a polite distance from the old man, her tone cool and detached. "No need, Uncle. I'll just have Chi accompany me."

Olivia wondered if she was imagining things, but there seemed to be a subtle emphasis on "Uncle" that made the old man flinch slightly. Was there more to this story?

Just then, Nathan chimed in cheerfully, "Mom, I have to head to the office later. Why don't you let Uncle show you around?"

Fleur demurred, "No need, I'm used to being alone. I'll just read some scriptures back home."

As they turned, Fleur caught sight of Olivia and the others. With a gentle smile, she suggested, "How about Olivia keeps me company?"

Olivia suddenly found herself in the spotlight. On one side was her ex's mom, extending a friendly hand, and on the other was her current boyfriend's mom, who couldn't stand her. And all the while, three men watched her intently. No matter what she chose, someone was bound to be unhappy.

Olivia fidgeted slightly, looking to Isabella for guidance. But before he could say anything, the old man interjected, "Didn't you hear your aunt calling you? Don't be rude."

His voice held a thinly veiled irritation. Olivia made up her mind quickly, waving at Isabella. "You go ahead with your mom. I'll catch up later."

With the old man's command settling the matter, everyone dispersed. Isabella's face was stormy, but seeing that Nathan wasn't tagging along, he calmed down a bit and followed his mother.

Olivia walked with Fleur, the night air crisp and fragrant. The garden lights cast a soft glow, and the scent of flowers drifted around them. Fleur moved at a leisurely pace, gently patting Olivia's hand.

"Isn't it boring for you to walk with an old lady like me?" Fleur asked softly.

Olivia shook her head, smiling. "Not at all. Besides, you don't look old at all. I've never seen such a beautiful lady!"

Fleur laughed, clearly charmed. "You sure know how to flatter, young lady!"

Olivia laughed along, genuinely meaning her words. Fleur, despite being in her forties, was graceful and youthful, with barely a wrinkle in sight.

"How do you stay so young, Aunt?" Olivia asked, tilting her head.

"Oh, there's no secret. Just a simple life and a bit of meditation," Fleur replied with a sigh. "By the way, Olivia, you can call me Aunt, as you did before."

"Sure, Aunt," Olivia replied, slightly surprised. "Did you say meditation?"

"Yes. After Chi returned to the family business, I spent my days in a temple, meditating. If it weren't for Chi insisting, I wouldn't have come back. I've neglected him these years, and now he's grown distant."

The information was a lot to process. Olivia had thought such stories existed only in TV dramas.

She smiled warmly, "No wonder you have such a calming aura!"

"Don't be so polite. Truth is, we let you down back then."

Olivia was taken aback. "Aunt, what do you mean?"

"When your mother was ill, if I had reached out to the family, maybe we could have helped with the medical bills. But I wanted Chi to have a peaceful life, so I stayed out of it. I didn't realize you had to..."

Sell her heart and soul for her mother's medical bills? Olivia pressed her lips together, her smile turning a bit wry.

Fleur looked at her with concern. "Olivia, I don't mean to judge. If anything, I'm sorry. If I'd known how much you meant to Chi, I wouldn't have been so selfish."

"When your family had troubles, Chi ran back here without telling me. To find peace, I turned to a temple, seeking solace."

So that's why Christopher Davis had left back then!

"These past five years, I've stayed away from the family. But now Chi is ill. If I'd known it would come to this, I would have returned sooner. Maybe then, you two could have been happy together."

Fleur seemed lost in her memories, her beautiful face showing a hint of weariness.

Olivia patted her back gently, her voice soothing. "Aunt, don't blame yourself. It's all in the past, and Isabella and I are doing well now."

Fleur observed Olivia's shy smile and the unmistakable happiness in her eyes, her own expression growing serious.

"Olivia, are you in love with him?"

"Yes!" Olivia replied confidently, then added, "I love him, and he loves me."

Fleur's face grew somber, a hint of worry in her gaze. "Do you know about his engagement?"

"I do."

They'd already clashed, and Olivia had nearly been harmed by that mother-daughter duo.

Seeing Olivia's expression, Fleur seemed to understand.

"Olivia, I have to warn you, marriages in powerful families are no small matter. Especially in a family like this, standing against it won't be easy."

"I know, but I'm not afraid!"

Olivia's small face was determined. "Isabella has already broken off the engagement. During tough times, I should stand by him without hesitation."

Fleur looked at Olivia's animated face, her eyes filled with a mix of emotions.
