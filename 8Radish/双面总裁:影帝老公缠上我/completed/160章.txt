"I freaking love you," Isabella Peterson's words echoed relentlessly in Olivia Stewart's ears, as she gazed up at him, her eyes blurred with tears. Olivia was at a loss for words, confronted by Isabella's raw vulnerability, something she had never seen in the haughty young master before. 

Standing there, Isabella's face was composed, his emotions veiled. His voice, deep and resonant, reached her, each word striking her like a drumbeat. "This is the last time I'll say it, Olivia. You're not a stand-in. I freaking love you because you are you! If I just wanted a replacement, I could find anyone to fit the bill. Why would I choose you?"

Those words reverberated in Olivia's mind, drowning out everything else. Love you, love you... the words played on a loop, overwhelming her senses. Her heart jolted, and she sat up, shock etched on her face. But before she could respond, Isabella had turned, leaving her with nothing but the sound of the door slamming and the sight of his retreating figure.

Isabella, despite his façade, could be hurt too. He often acted self-assured and domineering, yet there were moments when he was just a proud, love-starved boy. Olivia recalled what Lucas Wright had told her about Isabella's life before his successful surgery—the lonely childhood, the struggles he endured to become the man he was. A deep, searing pain spread through Olivia, like a thorny vine twisting around her heart.

As she clutched her chest, she realized that Isabella's pain was her pain too. How was she supposed to handle a man like Isabella Peterson? Should she sacrifice her entire life to fulfill his feelings for her, even if it meant losing herself in the process?

That night, as Isabella stayed in the study, Olivia lay awake, her mind a whirl of confusion. Morning came, finding her with panda eyes from a sleepless night. She descended the stairs to the dining room, her appearance barely acknowledged by the impeccably dressed staff who greeted her with polite bows.

"Good morning, Miss Stewart!" they chorused, but Olivia just forced a smile and waved them off, preferring solitude over ceremony. She moved into the dining room, where an array of dishes awaited her—American and continental fare prepared with precision. Yet, the sight of the empty chair across from her stole her appetite.

The chair, Isabella's usual place, stood vacant, a reminder of his absence. Olivia's heart sank a little, and she lowered her gaze, her long lashes casting shadows over her eyes, concealing her disappointment. 

She barely touched the food, asking for only a small bowl of porridge, which the staff promptly served. Even this simple dish was made with the finest organic ingredients, cooked to perfection. "The luxury of wealth," Olivia thought wryly as she dismissed the staff, preferring to be alone with her thoughts.

As she sipped the porridge, her eyes kept drifting to the empty chair opposite her. She knew he wouldn't come, yet she couldn't help but hope, dragging out her breakfast as if waiting for him to magically appear. When the bowl was empty, she stood up, mimicking Isabella's graceful habits, wiping her mouth and hands with meticulous care. 

With one last glance at the vacant chair, she left the room. Unbeknownst to her, Isabella had been watching from the staircase, hidden from view. He hadn't seen the longing in her eyes, only the empty bowl she left behind.

"She eats so little," he thought with a frown, as Lucas emerged from the shadows to check on the situation. "Should we prepare another meal, sir?" Lucas asked cautiously.

"No," Isabella replied curtly and walked away, leaving Lucas to sigh at the stubbornness of the pair. They were so clearly entwined in each other's lives, yet they continued their charade of indifference.

Later that day, Olivia left for the film set, driven by a security car, while Isabella followed in his flashy Ferrari, keeping a distance. But as they hit the main road, a black SUV suddenly blocked their path. 

Isabella didn't slow down, instead accelerating towards the SUV, which seemed intent on confrontation. Just as a collision seemed inevitable, Isabella swerved at the last second, his car grazing the SUV with a screech.

"Isabella Peterson, you've got guts!" came a voice as Ethan King emerged from the SUV, his expression stormy. He approached, knocking on Isabella's window. "We need to talk."

The window lowered, revealing Isabella's cool demeanor. "I'm not interested in talking to someone like you," he retorted, his voice icy. "Next time, try this stunt, and I won't hesitate to send you packing."

But Ethan persisted, "It's about Olivia Stewart."

Isabella paused, then lowered his shades, his eyes piercing. "What about her? Didn't you get enough over the phone last night?"

Ethan's face paled, his fists clenching in frustration. He knew the aftermath of last night's call, regretting his impulsiveness. "Isabella, bullying a woman isn't something to be proud of!" Ethan's voice trembled with anger.

Isabella chuckled, removing his sunglasses, his expression one of smug triumph. "And how do you know she doesn't enjoy it? Maybe she finds it... exhilarating."

"You bastard," Ethan spat, his fists trembling. "Why don't you take it out on me instead? What will it take for you to leave Olivia alone?"

Isabella's gaze hardened, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "Do you love her?"
