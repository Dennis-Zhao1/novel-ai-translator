Alexander Peterson Proposes

As soon as Alexander Peterson stepped into the room, Jonathan White couldn't help but pause for a moment when he saw his refined, almost delicate features.

"Mr. Peterson, please come in!" Jonathan greeted with a bright smile, though underneath, a hint of disappointment flickered. Tradition dictated he send an invitation to the Peterson Group. To curry favor with Isabella Peterson, he even sent one personally. But to his surprise, the person who showed up was Alexander Peterson, the once influential but now seemingly powerless heir.

After his daughter's engagement had been called off, Jonathan had refused to give up hope. He kept a close watch on the Peterson Group, aware of Alexander's recent house arrest. He was not entirely sure of the details, but Isabella's bold personnel changes at the company were clear to see.

Alexander acted as though he didn't notice Jonathan's somewhat forced smile and politely offered, "My father has been under the weather and bedridden. He wanted to congratulate you on your daughter's return but couldn't make it, so he sent me in his stead."

So Isabella wouldn't be attending? Jonathan's disappointment deepened, but he maintained his polite facade. "No worries at all! It's very thoughtful of Mr. Peterson. How is he doing these days?"

...

Olivia Stewart watched their exchange from the sidelines, unamused by their hollow pleasantries. Her heart sank the moment she saw Alexander, like a dam breaking, flooding her with emotions. Isabella had disappeared without a word after confessing her love amid a sea of flowers, and her absence still stung Olivia.

Just as Olivia was about to slip away to find a quiet corner, Alexander's voice cut through the crowd once more:

"Mr. White might not know, but before returning to the Peterson Group, I lived in the same small town as Olivia Stewart. We were childhood friends and even dated, but due to some misunderstandings..."

"Alexander Peterson!" Olivia interrupted angrily. Was he really bringing up old affairs in front of everyone just to cause trouble?

"Olivia, don't be upset!" Alexander pushed his glasses up, his face breaking into a warm, elegant smile.

"I just wanted to say, since you've reconnected with your family, I would like to take this opportunity to ask Mr. White..." Alexander hesitated, a rare flush coloring his cheeks, "to let me correct my past mistakes and rekindle our relationship!"

Rekindle? Olivia couldn't help but laugh. She couldn't see any reason for Alexander's proposal other than to use her against Isabella.

"I'm not interested!" Olivia retorted without hesitation.

Alexander seemed unfazed by her response, as if he expected it, and turned to Jonathan. "Mr. White, didn't you always want a marriage alliance with the Peterson Group? Despite my brother's past mistakes, as the eldest son, my sincere proposal should restore the dignity you lost."

"Well..." Jonathan was in a bind. Although Alexander was also a Peterson, Jonathan didn't have much faith in him. But it wasn't wise to offend the Peterson Group too much either.

Seeing Jonathan wavering, Alexander leaned in close and whispered, "Don't count on Isabella. She transferred all her shares to me. She's just a freeloader at the company now."

"What did you say?" Jonathan was visibly shocked, barely containing his reaction for the sake of appearances.

Olivia watched the two men whispering and felt a growing sense of dread. Sure enough, Jonathan's expression softened as he turned to her with a smile. "Olivia, why don't you show Alexander our wine collection?"

Alexander chuckled inwardly at Jonathan's cunning. By not outright rejecting him and having Olivia accompany him, Jonathan was clearly hedging his bets.

Pushing his glasses again, Alexander put on a scholarly air and smiled at Olivia. "Thank you, Olivia."

"My name is Olivia Stewart!" she corrected him sharply and led the way into the hall.

With a good-natured smile, Alexander followed, his long strides keeping pace with her. His eyes glinted behind his glasses as he watched Olivia's graceful figure, thinking about how Isabella's son was seriously ill and how she was frantically seeking treatment. If he secured a marriage alliance quickly, Isabella would be powerless to stop it when she returned.

They had only walked a few steps when a server passed by with a tray. Olivia immediately grabbed a glass of wine and handed it to Alexander. "Here."

Alexander took it, his gaze falling on Olivia's juice glass. "Aren't you having any to celebrate?"

"Celebrate what?" Olivia replied sarcastically. "What's there to celebrate?"

"You've gained a better family," Alexander said quietly.

Olivia scoffed. "I don't think there was anything wrong with my birth, nor do I think my current status is all that superior—just an illegitimate child, after all."

Her words struck a nerve with Alexander. He tightened his grip on the wine glass, his knuckles turning white.

"Sorry," Olivia apologized softly.

Alexander took a sip of wine, calming himself. "A person's birth can determine many things. If I had returned to the Peterson Group sooner, even as an illegitimate child, you wouldn't have been taken from me by Isabella."

"It's all in the past," Olivia murmured.

"It's not over," Alexander said, his voice carrying a cold edge as he looked at Olivia with softened eyes. "Olivia, before, you could only be Isabella's secret lover, hidden away. But now, as the daughter of the White family, I can openly marry you as the lady of the Peterson Group."

Olivia playfully blinked, "So with my new status, I could also marry Isabella openly. That's an interesting thought!"

Alexander's face turned cold. "He has nothing now. Marrying him would be like marrying a commoner."

"What did you do to him?" Olivia glared at Alexander, her tone accusatory.

Her hostile demeanor irked Alexander, and he scoffed. "Isabella's sterile. Her illegitimate child was discovered, and to save that child, she gave me her shares and you."

"You're lying!"

Alexander gave a small smile. "Don't believe me? Has she come looking for you these past few days? Has she shown up today?"

Olivia was at a loss for words, unable to deny the truth of his questions.

Alexander watched her expression with satisfaction. He was confident that once Olivia's emotions were in turmoil and he applied pressure on Jonathan, the marriage would go through. Even if Olivia regretted it later, it would be too late. The White and Peterson families couldn't afford another broken engagement.

"Olivia, I've always liked you and never forgotten you," Alexander said earnestly, reaching for her hand.

"Sorry, but I must excuse myself! Mr. Peterson, make yourself comfortable," Olivia said, quickly evading his touch, her tone polite but distant, almost cold.

If there weren't so many guests, Olivia would've loved nothing more than to throw her juice in Alexander's face.

The guests appeared to be engaged in quiet conversations, but in truth, they were all eavesdropping, curious about the love triangle between the Peterson brothers and Olivia. They speculated how things would unfold if Olivia accepted Alexander's proposal and what would happen when Isabella returned.

Some were disappointed when Olivia refused Alexander. Isabella was known for being ruthless in business, and many had suffered losses at her hand. They were eager to see her embarrassed, but...

As the guests began to disperse for their own amusement, the hall's entrance suddenly erupted with a loud announcement: "Isabella Peterson is here!"

Another Isabella? Instinctively, everyone thought of the Peterson Group's second son—Isabella!

The news about Alexander acquiring the shares hadn't been made public yet, so everyone believed the company was still under Isabella's control. They quickly turned to see the commotion.

Alexander stood still, emanating a cold aura. Why did it seem like no matter what he did, others always preferred Isabella? What was so special about her?

Even Olivia...

Alexander glanced at Olivia, hoping, but she stood frozen, her attention elsewhere. From the moment Isabella stepped into the hall, Olivia's focus had narrowed, her senses attuned only to her.

Isabella, rarely seen in formal attire, wore an exquisitely tailored suit that accentuated her tall, lean frame. The finely crafted suit highlighted the strength in her physique, making hearts race with just a glance.

Isabella's gaze swept over Olivia and headed straight toward her...
