Title: The Ex-Boyfriend

---

"If I weren't Olivia Stewart, just some random girl, would you still want to do something about it?"

Isabella Peterson froze for a second, her brows slightly furrowed as she hovered over Olivia Stewart, a hint of displeasure in her dark eyes. 

"See? I always manage to ruin the mood."

Olivia quickly pushed Isabella away, her voice laced with bitterness she couldn't quite conceal. She hadn't wanted to ask that question, but it slipped out before she could stop herself.

She'd even prepared herself mentally; if Isabella could confirm her feelings, Olivia would stop holding on to her principles so stubbornly. Unfortunately...

Olivia pressed her lips together and let out a self-deprecating laugh. Isabella stared at her intently.

"Are you jealous?"

"No."

"Wow, you're jealous of yourself?"

Suddenly, Olivia jumped up, her voice tinged with annoyance, "No! When I say no, I mean no!"

"Yes, I say yes, you are!"

Isabella cupped Olivia's chin, her eyebrows raised, a smug look in her eyes. "Is it that hard to admit that you've fallen for me?"

Olivia blinked and lowered her gaze. It wasn't love; it was just a small flutter of attraction. Who could blame her when he was so good-looking? Didn't he know she had a thing for handsome faces? Yes, she was just appreciating his looks!

"Olivia, I'm giving you permission to fall for me. You have to!"

Isabella declared arrogantly. Olivia chuckled softly to herself. Ha, Olivia, she almost heard it as Isabella calling her by her real name! In Isabella's eyes, she was always just Olivia. But she knew she wasn't, and never had been!

Isabella's sudden intrusion into her life was like a thorn, unexpectedly lodged in her palm. She had to pull it out before the pain seeped into her very bones.

Olivia turned away from Isabella's hand, her face cold as a glacier. "I will never fall in love with you!" she said, as much to him as to herself.

"Don't you dare!"

Isabella raised an eyebrow, his expression arrogant beyond measure. 

"Even if you forget me entirely, I'll force myself back into your mind!"

"Here!" Isabella jabbed a finger at Olivia's chest. "No one else is allowed in there but me!"

Talk about domineering! Olivia decided not to argue further with Isabella. Experience had taught her that arguing with the infamous Isabella Peterson only led to defeat.

"Can you please stop messing with Ethan King?" she asked. As soon as the words left her mouth, the air seemed to freeze, the atmosphere growing tense. She had only wanted to change the subject, but it seemed she had shot herself in the foot.

Surprisingly, Isabella didn't explode in anger. Instead, she lazily sat back down, crossed her legs, and idly tapped a finger on the coffee table, each tap echoing in Olivia's heart. 

"Spill it!"

"What?"

"Tell me about your story with that guy."

"There's really not much to tell."

"Hmm?"

Catching Isabella's threatening gaze, Olivia quickly changed her tune. "Alright, I'll tell you!"

She stood before Isabella like a student in front of a principal, ready to confess.

"When we first met, he was very kind to me. Later, when I was cheated on, he helped me deal with the other woman."

Cheated on, dealing with another woman—those words carried a lot of weight. Isabella's dark eyebrows knitted into a knot.

"There were other men before him?"

That seemed to bother him more than anything.

Olivia's face turned beet red. "Isabella, can you not make it sound so terrible? Like my private life is a mess! Just so you know, Ethan King and I are just good friends—best friends, even. We have the same preference, so I never saw him as a romantic interest!"

Isabella's eyes lit up. "Really?"

Olivia huffed, "I've always said that, but you just wouldn't let it go!"

Isabella scrutinized her, "You wouldn't be making this up to protect him from me, would you?"

"Don't want to talk to you!"

Isabella waved a hand dismissively. "Fine, continue."

Olivia shot him a resentful glance. This guy, with his self-important demeanor, acted like he was listening to an employee's report at the office. What did her personal life have to do with him anyway? Why did she have to lay it all out?

"Secondly," Olivia bit her lip, twisting her hands in her clothes, gathering courage, "can you not look at me like that? I'm an adult, having an ex is perfectly normal."

"An ex... and perfectly normal!"

Isabella's gaze was sharp as a knife. "Explain yourself!"

Explain herself, like she was some kind of criminal! But even if she had ten times the courage, she wouldn't dare go against the irritable Isabella.

Olivia lowered her head. "Actually, calling him my ex is a stretch. Our relationship didn’t even last two weeks."

Isabella raised an eyebrow, giving her a cold look. "Are you trying to fool a child, or are you just making up stories?"

"Believe it or not, if you hadn't pressed me, I wouldn't have brought it up. Every woman might accidentally run into a bad apple or two in her life!"

Isabella's dark eyes stayed on Olivia, silently urging her to continue.

"My ex was a journalist. When I first moved here, I was alone, struggling to find my footing, without a proper job. I was delivering sandwiches for a small store when he helped me with a dine-and-dash customer."

"And that's all it took for you to sell yourself? Look at your lack of ambition!"

Olivia rolled her eyes. In moments of vulnerability and loneliness, people are easily moved. She and Daniel Johnson hadn't really been in love; she just needed warmth, and he happened to pursue her at the right time. In truth, Daniel wasn't even worth calling an ex.

"And then?"

"And then..." Why did he want every detail?

Olivia bit her lip, leaving a pale mark against her pink skin.

"Two weeks in, I brought him back to my apartment..."

"Shut up!"

Isabella's sudden shout startled Olivia. He stood up, paced around, then turned and pointed at her like an angry parent, "Who gave you the nerve? With a guy you've known for two weeks, you bring him home? Tell me everything!"

"When I first met you, didn't you drag me to a hotel?" Olivia retorted.

"Is that the same?" Isabella jabbed a finger at her forehead.

"I..."

"No, no, stop right there!" Isabella waved his hand in frustration. "I might just throw you off the roof if you continue!"

Olivia twisted her clothes. First, he insisted she explain everything. Now, he wouldn't let her speak. What a domineering, arrogant, and awkward man!

Isabella circled her again and again, not less than twenty or thirty times. He flicked his sleeves or tugged at his collar, his eyebrows furrowed in deep thought, clearly agitated.

Olivia didn't interrupt, just watched him circle her, witnessing his inner turmoil.

Finally, Isabella stopped, his dark eyes piercing into Olivia. "Tell the truth, and if there's a single lie, I'll throttle you!"

"My apartment was a shared rental. It wasn't in the fancy neighborhood back then, but somewhere more remote."

"Focus. What happened after you brought him to your apartment? Did you sleep together? How many times?"

Olivia wanted to slap that overly handsome face of his. Such blunt questions made her feel exposed, like she was naked on an operating table.

This guy, what right did he have?

Isabella's eyes were locked onto Olivia, not missing a single expression on her face.

Olivia sneered, "He ended up with my roommate instead."

At that, Isabella's eyebrows shot up. His previously furious face broke into a wide grin, showing a row of bright white teeth as he laughed heartily. "Ha, that's just great!"

Olivia felt six imaginary dots float over her head. Was he really laughing at her painful memory?

Once he'd had his fill of laughter, Isabella's gaze sharpened again. "That guy ditched you for your roommate? What a poor judge of character! Must've been kicked in the head by a donkey!"

That almost sounded like a compliment. But before Olivia could fully smile, Isabella dealt another blow, "You think I'm an idiot, believing such nonsense?"

Olivia sighed, rubbing her temples. "Emily Young is a local. Her family owns a small clothing factory. Marrying her gave Daniel a local residency, and one day, that factory would be theirs."

"All for that?"

Isabella scoffed in disdain. "Olivia, do you have mush for brains? How could you date such a loser?"

"Bad luck. Lately, I've been running into a lot of losers."

That sounded like a backhanded insult. But Isabella didn't catch on, instead arrogantly proclaiming, "That's because you hadn't met me yet!"

Six more imaginary dots floated over Olivia's head.

"Sure, sure, since meeting you, my life has been all sunshine and rainbows. Mr. Peterson, your dessert's getting cold. If you’re not eating it, I'll just clear it away."

Olivia casually changed the subject, thinking: Phew—finally turning the page on this mess!

Isabella didn't respond, his sharp eyes fixed on her, each word from his lips deliberate, "So, did you or didn't you?"
