**This Crazy Scene! She Didn't Even Show Up!**

The auditorium was a frenzy of excitement, as the whole place erupted in applause. Young, enthusiastic fans leaped from their seats, waving glow sticks with Isabella Peterson's name or huge posters of her picture, shouting with all their might, "Isabella! Isabella! Isabella!"

"Folks, I get it, you're excited, but let's calm down, please!" The event host pleaded over the microphone, but it was clear nobody was listening. Even the security guards struggled to maintain order, completely overwhelmed by the fans' ecstatic energy.

The host couldn't even get the event properly started—it was chaos before the actual show even began. She glanced backstage for guidance, hoping for a miracle to restore some order.

Amy Green peeked out from behind the curtain, motioning for the host to bring the mic over. The host, mic in hand, hurried toward the backstage area.

The sight of the host leaving her spot briefly stunned the fans into a rare moment of silence. Then, a slightly raspy, magnetic voice resonated through the sound system, "I like a quiet venue. You have one minute to calm down, or leave!"

Isabella Peterson! It was really her speaking!

The fans gasped, eyes sparkling with admiration. But nobody dared to scream or shout anymore. Instead, they bit their lips and tried various ways to contain their excitement, trembling with anticipation.

In less than half a minute, the room was silent. Everyone sat upright like disciplined school kids, necks craned forward, eagerly waiting.

Then, out walked a tall figure from backstage, with striking blue eyes and chestnut hair, exuding a laid-back yet commanding presence. Isabella Peterson! Though she was an actress playing CEOs, her demeanor screamed real-life executive.

Many girls clasped their hands over their mouths, tears streaming silently down their faces.

Isabella scanned the crowd, her gaze landing on seat number 99—a spot she'd personally reserved for Olivia Stewart, hoping to catch her eye from the stage.

But, surprise! A stranger sat there instead.

Olivia Stewart wasn't there?

No way! She'd been so desperate for a ticket. Was she lost, or just...not there?

Isabella's sharp eyes swept over the audience. Her gaze made fans excited yet restrained, some biting their hands to keep quiet.

The host returned, trying to follow the event schedule and introduce Isabella.

Honestly, there was no need for an intro—everyone knew Isabella's story by heart. Plus, her life was always shrouded in mystery.

"Isabella, your fans are dying to know how you got started. Was there a mentor or a talent scout? Could you share your journey?"

Isabella took the mic, still scanning the crowd. "I got into acting for a girl."

The audience buzzed with curiosity. Isabella's love life was as enigmatic as she was—a constant source of fascination.

She paused, then continued, "There was a time I wasn’t doing well. I lost hope, and then this girl walked into my life. She was pure and beautiful, like a light in the dark. She once said to me, 'There are so many CEO novels, but no actors can truly embody the role.' So, I stepped into the film world and became the CEO she wanted to see on screen. Whatever she wants, I strive to give."

"Wow! That's some serious devotion!" whispered the audience, awestruck. Typically, stars keep their love lives under wraps, but Isabella's revelation only fueled their admiration.

The host voiced the question everyone was thinking, "What happened to the girl?"

Isabella's expression turned cold. "No comment."

The host tried to smooth things over, "We understand, Isabella wants to protect her privacy. But we hear there's another big announcement today?"

"Yes. On behalf of Billion Films Media, I announce a new movie starting production soon, with casting auditions in the city."

"Wow! A new movie! Auditions!"

The fans couldn't contain their excitement, hugging and high-fiving each other, the room buzzing like a kettle ready to boil over.

Isabella slightly frowned, and the fans instantly hushed, captivated by even her smallest gesture.

The host pressed on, "As we know, Billion Films is a giant in entertainment, with ventures in dining, fashion, and more. Have you always been signed with them?"

"Yes."

"Ever thought of representing other brands?"

"No."

Isabella's curt reply sent a chill through the room as she glanced at the host, "Are you here to host or to recruit?"

"No, no!" The host paled, beads of sweat forming as she quickly shifted back to the movie news.

"Can you share more about the new film?"

"It's titled *Send an Angel to Love You*, a heartfelt urban romance, crafted with the best directors and cast. The female lead will be selected through auditions."

"Ahhh—"

Fans erupted in cheers, eager to compete for the role.

"Will you be the male lead?"

"Yes."

"I'm in heaven!"

"If I get the part, I could die happy!"

"Dummy! If you die, how will you act with Isabella?"

Fans were losing it, crying, laughing, the energy off the charts.

Isabella turned coolly, exiting with her security entourage. Throughout, she'd seen no trace of Olivia Stewart. The theater was too crowded.

Back in the car, Isabella had Amy remove her stage makeup, instructing Michael Wright, "Call Mr. Stewart. Find out what Olivia's doing."

Michael quickly reported, "Olivia left home early but returned around the event start time. She's been in her room since."

Isabella's mood darkened. She hadn't shown up!

Did she know the event was for her?

Did she know this film was for her?

Days ago, she was desperate for tickets, and now she ditched him!

Was everything he said on stage wasted?

The more Isabella thought, the angrier she got.

Amy Green, nearby, nervously fiddled with a makeup sponge, nearly dropping it in her anxiety.

"Boss, stay calm!"

Isabella slammed the car seat, "How can I be calm when she didn't show?"

"Maybe something came up? The film hasn't even started shooting. There's still time!"

Isabella simmered down slightly, though still visibly upset.

"Two minutes to clean up. We're heading home!"

"Got it!"

Amy quickly restored Isabella's natural look.

"Boss, don't say I didn't warn you. You've changed clothes, but the cologne's still there. Better shower before heading home, or else..."

"I'll shower at home! It's men's cologne, not like she'd mistake it!"

"But what if she thinks you're—"

Isabella's glare silenced Amy mid-sentence.

In retrospect, Amy's warning was spot on. Olivia didn't question Isabella's orientation but did give him a hard time.

Seething, Isabella drove home, storming into the castle, demanding, "Where's Olivia Stewart?"
