Under the dim light of the wine cellar, Isabella Peterson was pouring wine all over herself—her neck, her clothes, her chest—with a calm precision that seemed at odds with the chaos of her actions. Lucas Wright, the ever-loyal butler, watched with a mix of shock and suspicion. "Ms. Peterson! What on earth are you doing?"

Without missing a beat, Isabella continued her work, her tone as cool as a winter breeze. "Lucas, we need to figure out who in the estate is spying for Alexander. Bring David and the others over from the Watercloud Manor."

Lucas's heart swelled with admiration. There was a method to her madness; Isabella was anything but a fool. Tears of relief pricked his eyes as he nodded, his voice trembling with emotion. "Understood, Ms. Peterson. Leave it to me!"

Despite his lack of experience with the inner workings of the Peterson Group, Lucas was no stranger to the nuances of household politics. Years of managing the estate had given him plenty of tricks up his sleeve.

Isabella kept up the act, switching to a new bottle and drenching herself further. The air was thick with the smell of alcohol, but her expression remained sharp and clear. "Find a way to meet with Zinan and let him know it's time to close the net."

Zinan, the vice president of the Peterson Group and Isabella's staunch ally, was the one keeping a close watch on Alexander's every move within the company.

Lucas nodded solemnly, ready to follow through with her orders, but suddenly his gaze caught a shadow lurking by the wine cellar door.

Someone was eavesdropping!

He glanced at Isabella, who returned a look that spoke volumes—a silent agreement passed between them.

Quickly, Lucas moved to Isabella’s side, pretending to support her drunken stupor as he exclaimed loudly, "Ms. Peterson, look at the state you're in! You’ve had enough to drink; you’ll hurt yourself!"

Isabella shot him a cold glare, wiping the remaining wine across her face, and smashed the bottle on the floor with a loud crash. Her voice slurred with feigned drunkenness, she barked, "You old fool! You dare tell me what to do when I’m having a drink?"

Lucas half-dragged, half-pulled Isabella towards the door, all the while pleading, "Please, Ms. Peterson, if you drink yourself to death here, Olivia won’t even know!"

Staggering along, Isabella waved him off with exaggerated motions, shouting, "Get lost! Leave me be!"

Together, they stumbled out noisily, and the shadow at the door vanished.

The next morning, Isabella was, predictably, completely "wasted." Alexander Peterson, having heard the news, sipped at his vintage wine, his face a mask of disdain. "So much for being a threat," he sneered. "Just a useless drunk after all."

By the third day, a frantic Lucas Wright approached Professor Zhang at the medical wing. "Ms. Peterson is getting worse. She's paranoid, even suspects me now. You must come and see her!"

Professor Zhang hesitated, "My equipment isn’t portable. Couldn’t you bring her here instead?"

Lucas's patience snapped. "She's too drunk to walk! You all rely on the Peterson Group, yet you refuse to help with something this important!"

Behind his kindly exterior, Lucas could still wield authority, and his words were enough to make Professor Zhang relent. "Fine, fine, I’ll come with you. Just let me use the restroom first."

Taking the opportunity, Professor Zhang discreetly called Alexander for guidance. Stepping outside the watchful eyes of the medical wing could invite Isabella's suspicion—something he dreaded.

Alexander chuckled over the line, "If they’ve come begging, go ahead. Have a nice chat with my dear sibling. I have a special gift planned for them soon."

With instructions in hand, Professor Zhang followed Lucas to the Wind Whisper Cottage, his nerves somewhat steady.

Lucas, observant as ever, noted the professor's newfound confidence. He suspected Alexander had given him some orders but chose to stay silent, leading him to Isabella’s quarters.

As they neared the cottage, they heard the sounds of destruction from upstairs.

Lucas quickened his pace, urging the professor, "Hurry! She’s on a rampage again! We’ve replaced the furniture three times already. There’s barely any antique left intact!"

Unsuspecting, Professor Zhang followed Lucas upstairs. At a bend in the staircase, one of the staff—a cleaner—gave him a knowing look.

Professor Zhang nodded back slightly, and the cleaner retreated quietly.

Inside Isabella’s room, Lucas closed the door with a decisive click.

The sound of the lock sent a chill through Professor Zhang. "Lucas, what’s going on?"

Before he could react, a vase shattered at his feet, sending shards flying. One cut across his face, leaving a bloody gash from forehead to jaw.

"Ms. Peterson!"

He gasped, looking up into Isabella’s cold, calculating eyes—eyes that held no trace of drunkenness.

Realization dawned, and he fell to his knees with a thud, right onto the jagged shards, pain shooting through him.

"Please, Ms. Peterson, have mercy!" he begged, blood mingling with tears of desperation.

Another vase crashed against the window, Isabella’s warning clear.

Lucas listened at the window, ensuring Alexander’s spies were gone before setting a chair in the center of the room.

Isabella sat with an air of authority, her gaze cutting through Professor Zhang like a blade.

"Please, Ms. Peterson, I was forced! Alexander has my family!"

"And so, you used your psychological tricks to pit me against my own family?"

Professor Zhang, knowing the jig was up, confessed everything, hoping for mercy. "I’ll tell you everything! Just save my family!"

Isabella’s voice was ice. "You’re in no position to bargain."

Reluctantly, Professor Zhang spilled Alexander's plan to manipulate Isabella through psychological warfare, laying bare every deceit.

Isabella recalled the whispers she’d heard during her blindness, the sight of Alexander with Olivia in the garden. Her lips curled into a cold smile. "The woman, she was a decoy, wasn’t she?"

Professor Zhang nodded, unable to lie.

Isabella laughed silently. Alexander had outsmarted himself. If that woman had stayed hidden, the plan might have worked. But her appearance unraveled the mystery Alexander had so carefully constructed.

"Who is she?" Isabella demanded.

"I don’t know!"

Seeing Isabella’s silence, he panicked, "I swear, I don’t know!"

Isabella gestured for Lucas to stop him from further self-harm. "Enough, you’re a mess as it is."

Professor Zhang, realizing her mercy, was quick to promise silence. "Thank you, Ms. Peterson. I’ll say it was an accident. No one will know!"

"No, no, no," Isabella corrected, a mischievous smile tugging at her lips. "Tell them the truth. Group Peterson’s second heir had a drunken tantrum—broke a few things, hurt a few people. Perfectly normal, right?"

Professor Zhang bowed low, "Understood, Ms. Peterson."

Isabella’s eyes were cold as she instructed Lucas, "Escort the professor back. Have Spring clean up here."

"Yes, Ms. Peterson," Lucas nodded, taking the cue.

Professor Zhang left, haunted by the realization that Isabella had long since uncovered Alexander’s schemes, while he’d been blissfully ignorant.

Lucas accompanied him back to the medical wing, offering a few pointed reminders along the way. By the time they arrived, Professor Zhang was a bundle of nerves, any hope of defiance thoroughly quashed.

Spring, the cleaner from the stairs, also received a taste of Isabella’s "drunken" wrath.

The staff at Wind Whisper Cottage were terrified, keeping their distance from Isabella, lest they become collateral in her ongoing battle of wits with Alexander.

After Professor Zhang reported back, Alexander, smug with confidence, planned his next move. "Ah Su, bring out my best wine. Since Isabella loves to drink, let’s send it over. I’m sure she’ll appreciate it."

"Yes, sir," the butler complied.

Alexander swirled his wine, eyes gleaming with malice. "Isabella, my dear sibling, tonight I have a special gift for you."
