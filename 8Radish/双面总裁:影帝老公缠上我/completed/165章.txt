Chapter 1: Secrets and Kisses

Isabella Peterson leaned in close, her eyes half-closed, as her gaze settled on Olivia Stewart's soft lips. With a gentle touch, she kissed her, slowly savoring the moment. Olivia found herself lost in this kiss, noticing there was no familiar lemon gum flavor, just the scent she knew so well.

Could it be that because she was imagining Isabella Peterson, even the kiss felt like it came from her?

As Olivia slowly softened and responded to the kiss, Isabella's eyes sparkled, like a meteor streaking across the night sky. She held Olivia's head gently, the tenderness gradually transforming into a more passionate embrace, like a predator enjoying its feast.

The scene had long ended, but the two were still lost in each other. Director Wang stood by, his hand raised, unable to call it off. This scene was perfect—tender, passionate, nuanced.

Under Isabella's guidance, Olivia almost forgot they were acting. Not until the last bit of air was squeezed from her lungs, leaving her dizzy and breathless, did her lips finally part.

Olivia gasped for air, her cheeks flushed. "You silly girl," Isabella teased, touching her hair, their noses almost touching as she smiled.

Suddenly, Olivia snapped out of her daze and pushed Isabella away, her face reddening even more. Oh no! She had just confused Isabella for someone else and lost herself in the moment. How embarrassing!

Mortified, Olivia ran off, covering her face. Isabella touched her chin, watching Olivia flee, chuckling like a sly fox. "Interesting," she mused.

Amy Green, standing nearby, couldn't help but shiver at Isabella's expression. "Boss, is it really okay to tease your girl like that?"

In the following scenes, Isabella behaved, and Olivia's performance improved. Her actions and expressions were spot-on. At first, Isabella found it amusing to tease Olivia, but soon she couldn't laugh anymore. Olivia was getting more in sync with her!

Olivia wasn't a professional actress; her roles were mostly natural. Especially in intimate scenes, she was conservative. If she wasn't genuinely moved, she couldn't fake it.

During another intimate scene, as Olivia's face showed that familiar dreamy expression, Isabella's mood soured. Was Olivia actually developing feelings for her?

Amy Green watched Isabella's conflicted expression and shook her head. "Boss, this is your doing. You have only yourself to blame!"

By the end of the day, Isabella was in a foul mood. Amy followed her cautiously, not daring to say a word.

Once in the RV, Isabella yanked off her voice-modulating necklace and tossed it aside, sulking. "This thing is expensive!" Amy exclaimed, scrambling to pick it up. "Breaking it won't be easy to replace!"

"I don't care!" Isabella huffed, kicking the seat in frustration. Despite her deep voice returning, her appearance was still that of a charming young man, pouting and sulking.

Amy stifled a laugh as she rolled up the windows and pulled out her kit to remove Isabella's makeup. As Amy worked, Isabella glared out the window at the crew leaving. The RV windows were special—clear from the inside but opaque from the outside.

Suddenly, Olivia's petite figure appeared in Isabella's line of sight. She seemed in high spirits, bouncing like a happy little rabbit. Was she this happy because of the intimate scene with Isabella?

Isabella's expression was as unpleasant as if she'd eaten something disgusting. She knew it was foolish to be upset with herself, but to Olivia, she was someone else. Any hint of affection was a betrayal!

Watching Olivia's cheerful smile was like staring into a blinding light. Unable to stand it, Isabella dialed Olivia's number.

Olivia's face lit up when she saw Isabella's call. "Hello, Isabella!" she chirped, her voice full of joy, contrasting sharply with Isabella's stormy mood.

"You seem happy today," Isabella's tone was icy.

"Yes!" Olivia, still riding her high, spun around on her toes. She hadn't been this happy since their reunion!

Isabella's frown deepened. "What made you so happy?" she asked, trying to keep her anger in check.

"Well, the shoot went smoothly today, and I really got into character!" Olivia beamed, silently adding a hopeful thought: And maybe, just maybe, it meant Isabella wasn't mad at her anymore.

In reality, Isabella was seething. That little rascal! Was she really that pleased about connecting with another man?

Isabella gripped her phone tightly, resisting the urge to storm out of the RV and confront Olivia right there.

Amy finished cleaning up Isabella's disguise and quietly slipped away, avoiding the fallout.

Isabella's handsome face was twisted in frustration, her voice tense. "Did you enjoy being kissed by him?"

Olivia's smile faltered, a chill running down her spine. It felt like Isabella was watching her, hidden somewhere on set. Creepy!

She glanced around. Most of the crew had left. Only Isabella's RV and her security detail's car remained nearby. No sign of Isabella.

Relieved, she remembered Isabella's spies were always around. Of course, he knew everything!

Thinking of Isabella, Olivia blushed, a soft pink coloring her cheeks.

Isabella's eyes narrowed. Was she... reminiscing?

His grip on the phone tightened, wishing he could crush it.

"Is it his skill, or do you enjoy it more with me?" Isabella's jealousy spilled over into his words.

"Oh, come on! You promised not to be jealous. Why ask such a silly question?" Olivia's heart raced, her voice teasing and shy. Little did she know, her bashful expression was perfectly visible to Isabella.

His anger flared, eyes darkening like molten lava.

"Tell me!" Isabella demanded, teeth clenched, his hand resting on the RV door, veins pulsing in his hand.

"How can I say something like that?" Olivia stomped her foot, looking around to make sure no one was watching, then lowered her voice, soft and sweet. "Isabella, I have a secret. Promise you won't laugh?"

Isabella paused, staring at Olivia's shy expression, waiting.

Olivia plucked a leaf, twirling it between her fingers, her voice a soft whisper, "Actually, the reason I could do the scene today is because..."

Her voice grew quieter, filled with sweetness and a hint of embarrassment, "I imagined it was you."

Isabella froze, eyes brightening like diamonds. It was a moment before he found his voice, filled with a mix of delight and disbelief. "What did you say?"

The always-proud Isabella doubted his ears!

Olivia sighed, repeating earnestly, "I said, I imagined him as you to get through the scene."

It was as if a refreshing breeze blew away all his anger, filling him with a rush of joy.

Isabella's expression softened, his voice rising with pride. "Say it louder!"

This girl was something else, taking him from despair to ecstasy in seconds!
