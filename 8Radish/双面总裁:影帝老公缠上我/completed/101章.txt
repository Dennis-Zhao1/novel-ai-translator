Olivia Stewart felt like she was trudging down an endless path, each step heavy with exhaustion. Every time she thought she'd reached a glimmer of light, the road would twist and extend further, as if it had no end. Her legs ached, and she wanted to rest, but a voice in her head kept urging her on, "Wake up, little one! Don't give up now!"

She knew she had unfinished dreams and goals. Life was far from complete, and stopping now meant she might never reach her destination.

So, she pushed on, dragging her weary body forward. As she walked, scenes flickered past like an old movie reel, each frame filled with faces sneering at her, hands reaching out like something out of a horror movie.

"No, stop!" she cried, trying to protect herself, but no one came to her rescue.

Suddenly, a gunshot rang out, and she saw Isabella Peterson, descending like a savior from the heavens.

"Isabella Peterson, help me!" she screamed, desperate for salvation.

But when Isabella turned, his smirk was cold, his eyes filled with disdain, and her heart sank.

"Why would I save someone so filthy?" he sneered.

And then Sophie Cook, who had somehow appeared from his embrace, drove a knife into Olivia's heart. She watched her own blood drip from the blade as Isabella and Sophie soared higher, leaving her behind.

At that moment, Olivia thought maybe it was better not to find the end of this road. She clutched her heart and collapsed, hearing a voice thunder above her, "If you don't wake up, I'll throw Sophie Cook to the bodyguards!"

The name Sophie Cook echoed in her mind, fueling her anger and despair.

"Olivia Stewart, if you dare to sleep again, I'll tear you apart!" The voice roared, followed by a hand lifting her off the ground.

Pain shot through Olivia, making her gasp, "Ugh..."

"Idiot! She's injured. Do you want to kill her?" Isabella scolded, glaring at Sophie Cook, who had grabbed Olivia's arm. In his fury, he swatted her hand away.

The noise around her was overwhelming. Olivia slowly opened her eyes, her mind foggy, catching sight of two hands—one delicate and pale, the other clean and strong.

Looking up, she saw Isabella Peterson and Sophie Cook. Isabella quickly withdrew his hand, wiping it with a towel as if it had been contaminated.

"Big sis, you're awake!" Sophie Cook exclaimed with delight.

Isabella said nothing, but his deep eyes were filled with concern as they watched Olivia.

Olivia closed her eyes again, recalling the dream where Isabella had left her for Sophie. Awake, she was confronted with the same reality: the man she cared for and her beloved sister, hand in hand. Better to shut her eyes and see nothing.

"Big sis! Stay with us!" Sophie urged, moving to shake her awake, secretly hoping Isabella would take her hand again.

"There's nothing for you here. Leave!" Isabella unceremoniously grabbed Sophie by the collar and tossed her out.

"Olivia Stewart!" he called softly, leaning close to her ear, his voice a mix of husky tension and cautious tenderness.

Her eyelashes fluttered, but the memory of Isabella's disdainful face in her dream held her back. She didn't dare open her eyes.

"Doctor!" Isabella's booming voice shattered the room, and in the chaos, Olivia's weak protest was lost.

Moments later, Dr. Hu rushed in, out of breath, bowing to Isabella, "Young master!"

"Enough with the formalities!" Isabella snapped, dragging the doctor to Olivia's bedside.

"She just opened her eyes but seems to have fainted again!" he demanded.

Dr. Hu checked Olivia's pulse and eyes, then straightened up, "Young master, Olivia Stewart is fine."

"How can she be fine if she fainted again?" Isabella growled, his eyes blazing.

Dr. Hu trembled, "Rest assured, young master. Since she's woken up, she won't faint again. She's just too weak to speak."

"Too weak?" Isabella questioned, his gaze skeptical as he looked at Olivia, "She can't even open her eyes?"

He leaned in, his face inches from hers, "Little one, are you awake? Just open your eyes and look at me, please?"

The infamous Isabella, speaking so gently to a woman—it was almost unbelievable!

Olivia's lashes fluttered, and slowly, she opened her eyes, meeting his concerned gaze with her own.

"Good, good! You're awake. Rest now," Isabella soothed, covering her eyes with his warm hand, then turning to Lucas Wright, "Prepare some food!"

Lucas, ever attentive, handed over a tray, "We've already made some broth. After two days of sleep, her stomach needs something gentle."

"Bring it here!" Isabella turned back to Olivia, his voice suddenly soft, "Hungry? Let's eat a little first, okay?"

Olivia had never heard him speak so kindly. She looked at him, bewildered.

Isabella's lips curled into a small, charming smile, "Good girl!"

His tone was almost babying, and Olivia couldn't help but inwardly roll her eyes.

Gently, he supported her, propping her up with a soft pillow. But as she settled, memories of Sophie in his arms flitted through her mind, and she instinctively shied away.

Isabella noticed her discomfort and frowned, but he kept his temper in check. He took the bowl of broth from Lucas, sending him off with a nod.

"You're dismissed, Lucas."

"Yes, young master," Lucas replied, quietly closing the door behind him.

Isabella carefully stirred the broth, testing it before bringing a spoonful to Olivia's lips.

She turned her head slightly, refusing.

"Olivia Stewart! I'm personally taking care of you, and you're being picky?" Isabella snapped, his patience wearing thin, "Slept for two days, and now you're fussy?"

Too tired to argue, Olivia leaned back, silent. She knew she was being difficult, but the thought of his hands having touched Sophie made her lose her appetite.

"Fine, you're the patient. I won't argue," Isabella relented, trying again with the spoon, concerned it might be too hot.

"Is it too hot?" he murmured, bringing the spoon closer.

Olivia replied hoarsely, her throat burning, "Get the staff to do it."

Her voice was rough, like nails on a chalkboard, and she braced for Isabella's disdain.

Instead, his brow furrowed, "If you can't talk, don't."

She wisely closed her mouth, and he offered her a cup of water.

"Drink a little to soothe your throat."

She hesitated, watching his hand, and as their eyes met, she saw something unexpected in his gaze—was it… tenderness?

Not disdain, but tenderness! Her heart skipped a beat.

She leaned forward, accepting the cup, and Isabella helped her drink.

Suddenly, she choked, spraying water all over Isabella's face and suit.

"Olivia Stewart!" Isabella's expression darkened as if she'd just cost him a fortune.
