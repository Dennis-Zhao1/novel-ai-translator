Title: Delivered to Destiny

One Year Ago, at the Lux Club.

Daniel Johnson had been lurking outside the entrance for what felt like forever, waiting for the illustrious figure to show up. Word on the street was that a big-shot in the film industry, Mr. Billionaire, was in town. A few well-known producers had somehow managed to coax him to this high-end venue for a little R&R.

Where there were big shots, there'd definitely be actresses and models aplenty, creating a treasure trove of gossip.

Tomorrow's headline is mine!

Daniel was buzzing with excitement, like a reporter hopped up on caffeine. He had his paparazzi gear stashed away and was ready to sneak inside. However, the doorman blocked his way.

"Sir, may I see your membership card?"

Daniel was taken aback. As a small-time paparazzo, he didn't have a membership at such a swanky club.

"I, uh, forgot it. Can you make an exception?"

The doorman, seeing Daniel's obsequious demeanor, knew right away he was a nobody. With a dismissive look, he said coldly, "If you can't afford it, don't embarrass yourself by hanging around here. Step aside and stop tarnishing our club's image!"

Daniel was fuming. "Hmph! Just because you're a doorman doesn't mean you're better than me!"

The doorman ignored him, and Daniel tried every trick in the book but couldn't get through the door. Reluctantly, he resorted to hanging around the area, hoping to catch a glimpse of the big shot and perhaps snag a photo of him with a starlet.

About ten minutes later, a middle-aged man stepped out and ducked into a shadowy corner to make a call. "Hey, those starlets you sent over—Mr. Billionaire isn't interested. Got anyone who looks more pure and innocent?"

Daniel, eavesdropping from behind the man, had an idea. He tapped the man's shoulder.

"Who is it?" The man turned, eyebrows raised.

Daniel grinned. "Ah, it's Producer Lee! Pleasure to meet you!"

Producer Lee looked him up and down, unamused. "I don't know you."

"Uh," Daniel scratched his head sheepishly. "I'm Matthew Johnson, the entertainment reporter who frequents your sets."

"Ugh! A paparazzo trying to cozy up to me?" Producer Lee brushed off imaginary dust from his shoulder and turned to leave.

Daniel quickly stopped him, flashing a sycophantic smile. "Producer Lee, don't be mad. I overheard your call. You're looking for a pure and lovely girl, right? I happen to know someone who's not in showbiz—she's definitely pure and gorgeous. You'll be satisfied!"

Producer Lee raised an eyebrow, skeptical. "Really?"

"If you don't believe me, I'll show you a picture!" Daniel fumbled for his phone and showed Producer Lee a photo of Olivia Stewart. "Look at this. What do you think?"

In the soft light, Olivia's innocent beauty was undeniable. Her large, expressive eyes were captivating, like they could speak volumes. A girl like her would surely please the big shot.

Producer Lee slapped his thigh. "Great, she's the one! Bring her over!"

Daniel, smiling ingratiatingly, held up a finger. "I have a small request. As an entertainment reporter, I'd love to snap some photos of the big shot, but I can't get into the club. Could you...?"

Producer Lee shot him a warning glance. "You want to take photos of the big shot? Are you nuts?"

"Then I'll leave you be!"

Daniel pretended to walk away, and Producer Lee quickly called him back. "Wait!"

Seeing a glimmer of hope, Daniel turned, bowing. "Producer Lee, what do you need?"

Producer Lee smoothed his thinning hair. "Okay, bring the girl over, and I'll get you inside the club. You can snap photos of the other stars, but no pictures of the big shot. He's not someone you can mess with!"

"Deal!" Daniel agreed eagerly, already plotting his strategy once inside.

After their arrangement, Daniel called Olivia Stewart, telling her he had saved up for weeks to treat her to a candlelit dinner at the Lux Club. Unaware of the true agenda, Olivia was deeply moved and quickly made her way to the club.

Escorting Olivia into an adjoining private room, Daniel set the scene with romantic lighting. He admired her beauty but suppressed his feelings, focusing instead on the juicy headlines he was about to score.

He sweet-talked Olivia, plying her with wine until she was tipsy, despite her usual abstinence. 

Signaling to Producer Lee from the door, Daniel gave him the go-ahead.

Producer Lee, impatiently waiting, had Olivia escorted to Mr. Billionaire's suite. Daniel seized the chance to snap a photo of Mr. Billionaire embracing Olivia.

Minutes later, seeing Olivia hadn't been tossed out, Producer Lee and Daniel exchanged a knowing smile—it was a done deal.

Later, Daniel snuck around the club, snapping shots of A-list celebrities mingling with wealthy patrons, mentally tallying his future earnings.

Returning to the empty room, Daniel felt a pang of regret. How many times had he wanted to get close to Olivia only to be rejected? Yet now, she was with another man.

His heart ached as he stared at the flickering candlelight, her smiling face haunting him.

In his turmoil, Olivia's friend Lily Young called. Driven by impulse, Daniel invited Lily over. She, having a crush on Daniel's boyish charm, quickly fell for him, and they ended up entangled in the private room.

After recounting the whole story, Daniel groveled for mercy. "That's the truth. I didn't hide anything. Olivia took the photo, and I swear I have no copies. I won't say a word about it. I'm sorry! Please don't soil your hands on a nobody like me!"

"Bang!" A nearby bodyguard kicked him.

Yes, the big shot didn't need to dirty his hands; a mere glance was enough for others to do the job.

Realizing he might not escape his fate, Daniel lay silent, his face ashen.

Producer Lee had warned him—this big shot was untouchable.

Regret was too late now.

"Call Lee Dayong!" commanded the imposing man. His deep voice was emotionless.

The car's headlights cast a sharp light on his chiseled features, revealing a handsome and determined man—Isabella Peterson!

"Yes, sir!" The bodyguard stepped back to make the call.

Lee Dayong, or Producer Lee as Daniel called him, was a veteran under the Billionaire's empire.

The bodyguard returned quickly. "Sir, Lee Dayong's account matches Daniel Johnson's. A year ago, at the Lux Club, he arranged for a girl to be sent to your suite."

"That girl was Olivia Stewart?"

"He didn't specify, only that Daniel Johnson provided her."

"Send him back where he came from!" Isabella Peterson ordered, his eyes like daggers as they turned to Daniel.

Daniel shivered, raising his hand in a desperate vow. "It's Olivia Stewart! And I assure you, she's pure! Back then, though she was my girlfriend for two weeks, we never even held hands, truly!"

Not for lack of trying—she just wouldn't let him!

Isabella Peterson looked at another bodyguard. "What's Olivia Stewart's status now?"

The bodyguard bowed respectfully. "The housekeeper reports Olivia Stewart is back at the estate, but she's locked herself in her room, refusing to see anyone."

Murderous intent flashed in Isabella's eyes as he approached Daniel.

Daniel writhed in the dirt, howling in despair. "Don't kill me! I gave her to you. Why do you still want to kill me?"

"I'm not killing you. I'm thanking you for bringing her back to me!" Isabella said coolly, pressing his foot onto Daniel's injured leg.

"Ah—" Daniel's scream echoed like a banshee's wail.

Isabella smirked, grinding his shoe into Daniel's leg, then switched to the other.

"Ah! Ah! Ah—" Daniel's voice shattered the night, piercing and eerie like a ghostly wail.

Indeed, Daniel now resembled a ghost himself.

Isabella stepped back, the bodyguard immediately kneeling to wipe the blood from his shoe with a clean towel, once, twice, three times.

Finished, the bodyguard stood and tossed the used towel onto Daniel's pale face.
