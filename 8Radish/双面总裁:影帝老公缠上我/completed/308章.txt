"Should we do another paternity test?"

Boom—

Olivia Stewart felt like she'd just been whacked over the head with a sledgehammer.

"Isabella Peterson, what on earth are you talking about?"

That man! Which one?

Has he been doubting all along? Does he wonder whose child Tommy really is?

But Isabella Peterson wouldn't say another word. She turned on her heel and stormed upstairs, her face a mask of determination.

Thud, thud, thud…

The heavy footsteps echoed like a drumbeat, pounding relentlessly on everyone's hearts.

No wonder Master Eric and Missy have been in a cold war recently. So, it turns out Tommy isn't...

The doctor and the surrounding maids shrank back, trying to make themselves invisible, terrified that overhearing this bombshell would cost them their jobs—or worse, have the Peterson Group make them disappear!

Olivia Stewart forced down the tidal wave of emotions crashing inside her and urged the doctor to check on Tommy.

After a thorough examination, the doctor gave Tommy a shot to reduce his fever, left some medication, and quickly made his exit.

Olivia carefully mixed the medicine and fed it to Tommy bit by bit.

Tommy's little face was flushed with fever, and in his drowsy state, his tiny hands clung tightly to Olivia's shirt, occasionally mumbling, "Auntie…"

One maid, summoning all her courage, stepped forward. "Olivia, why don't you let me take care of Tommy? You should check on the twins, Coco and Fruity."

Olivia looked down at Tommy, her eyes brimming with tears.

Both the palm and back of her hands were precious. How could she not worry with both the twins sick?

But the twins had plenty of people to care for them, while Tommy relied solely on her!

How could she leave him in this state?

So, Olivia shook her head, struggling to carry Tommy upstairs.

The maid followed closely, supporting Tommy's legs to make it just a bit easier. After all, Tommy was already several years old and quite heavy to hold.

Olivia settled Tommy back in his room, and he clung to her clothing until the fever medication kicked in. Once his temperature returned to normal and he fell into a deep sleep, he finally let go.

Gently, Olivia tucked Tommy's hands back under the blanket, gestured for the maid to keep watch over him, and then quietly left the room.

As soon as she stepped out, a wave of dizziness hit her.

Leaning against the wall, she paused to rest, then headed toward the twins' room.

The twins were already asleep, with two nannies keeping vigil beside them. The soft glow of the nightlight bathed their rosy little faces.

Olivia whispered to inquire about the twins' condition. Learning that Coco's fever had subsided, she watched the two sleeping children for a long time before finally turning to leave.

The dizziness was getting worse.

Supporting herself against the wall, Olivia returned to her room.

It was dark and empty—Isabella wasn't there!

In the shadows, Olivia closed her eyes, the darkness hiding her tear-streaked face.

Who could have imagined that all her efforts with Isabella would lead to this because of Tommy…

Isabella's jealous outburst still echoed in her ears.

Despite her exhaustion, Olivia dragged her weary feet toward the study.

She had to confront Isabella and get to the bottom of this!

The study light was on, and the door was ajar. Muffled voices drifted out:

"Sir, should we schedule a comprehensive health check for the twins, Coco and Fruity, right away?"

"Yes! First thing tomorrow! I planned to wait until they were older, maybe six months, for a full check-up. But now, the sooner, the better—especially screening for congenital heart defects!"

"Understood, sir! And what about the paternity test?"

Silence filled the air, heavy with discomfort.

Finally, Isabella waved dismissively, "No need."

"Why not? Of course, you should!" 

The study door flew open with a bang, and Olivia strode in, sarcasm etched across her face.

Lucas Wright hurriedly bowed, "Olivia!"

Isabella frowned, "What are you doing here?"

A mocking smile curled Olivia's lips. "Shouldn't I know if you're doing a paternity test on my child?"

Isabella averted her gaze, "It's just part of the routine checkup. Besides, I told them not to do it."

"Routine checkup?" Olivia laughed, "Who in their right mind includes a paternity test as routine? Isabella, you've never trusted me, have you? You're not testing the children—you're slapping me in the face! Did you test Tommy too when you brought him back?"

Seeing Olivia's determined stance, Isabella decided there was no point in hiding, so she coldly replied, "Yes."

"And what did you find? Are you saying Tommy isn't your son?" Olivia pressed.

Recalling Isabella's treatment of Tommy over the past months, Olivia felt a sudden, inexplicable panic and fixed her gaze on Isabella, her heart in her throat.

"Do you really want to know?" Isabella looked into Olivia's eyes and slowly said, "He's Alexander Peterson's son."

"No, no… How could that be?"

Olivia shook her head, staggered back a few steps, and suddenly collapsed.

"Olivia!"

Isabella rushed forward and caught Olivia in her arms, her face pale and unconscious.

"Doctor! Get the doctor!"

Isabella shouted, carrying Olivia out the door.

The doctor arrived quickly.

After an examination, it was concluded that Olivia was simply exhausted and overwhelmed by emotional stress, causing her to faint.

Isabella's gaze fell on Olivia's pale face, noticing for the first time the dark circles under her eyes and the fatigue etched into her features.

She turned her icy gaze to Lucas Wright. "What on earth is going on?"

Lucas dared not hide anything and briefly reported Olivia's relentless care for both Tommy and the twins day and night.

For the overly dependent Tommy, who clung to Olivia almost pathologically, Isabella was so furious she could have thrown him out immediately!

But Olivia insisted on taking on all the burdens!

"Fool!"

Isabella cursed under her breath, wanting to flip Olivia over and give her a good spanking.

But in the end, his large hand gently caressed Olivia's cheek, brushing it tenderly.

"Since she's so tired, let her sleep well."

"Yes, sir!"

The doctor administered a sedative to Olivia and quietly left.

Isabella stayed by Olivia's bedside, watching her face grow thinner and giving himself a self-reproaching punch.

If he hadn't been so hung up on this issue, Olivia wouldn't be so exhausted, to the point of collapse.

But Olivia, isn't having me and the twins with you enough?

Why does your heart only have room for Alexander Peterson's child?

Isabella was torn between anguish, confusion, tenderness, and regret.

All these emotions tangled up inside him, a knot of unsolvable woes.

His severe psychological aversion made it hard to accept such a child. Yet Olivia's excessive affection for the child sparked his jealousy and resentment, leading him to reveal the truth in a moment of utter irrationality, causing Olivia to faint from the shock!

When Olivia wakes up, what will she do? Will she leave with Alexander Peterson's child?

The thought terrified Isabella.

Reflecting on all that had happened recently, he realized how many foolish things he'd done, driven by jealousy!

"Olivia, I'm sorry. When you wake up, everything will be okay," Isabella whispered, holding Olivia's hand gently.

In the middle of the night, Tommy woke up and, not finding Olivia by his side, began to wail.

The maid couldn't calm him down, so she carried Tommy to Olivia's door and knocked.

"Olivia, Tommy is crying for you!"

The door opened, revealing Isabella's furious face. The maid quickly bowed, "Sir!"

Isabella's voice was frigid, "Making a racket in the middle of the night—do you remember I'm your employer?"

The maid quickly apologized, "I'm sorry, sir! It's just that Tommy usually sleeps with Olivia, and I couldn't soothe him, so…"

Isabella's steely gaze fixed on Tommy.

Tommy shrank back in the maid's arms.

"Get down here!" Isabella's voice was cold and commanding.

Tommy slid down from the maid's arms and stood before Isabella, feet together, standing straight as an arrow.

Isabella pointed to the bed where Olivia lay sleeping. "Do you see her? She's exhausted because of you and fell sick! She just managed to fall asleep, and here you are, disturbing her! Do you want her to be so tired she never wakes up?"

Olivia, sedated, slept deeply, oblivious to the commotion.

Tommy glanced fearfully at Olivia, shaking his head vigorously.

Isabella continued, "You can usually take care of yourself and sleep on your own. Are you tormenting her on purpose?"

Tommy's eyes flickered, and he quickly shook his head, "No, I just wanted Auntie Fruity with me!"

"Idiot!" Isabella muttered in disgust. "She's a person, not a machine! She can't handle your demands! If you can't behave, then it's best you leave!"

Tears welled up in Tommy's eyes. "I'm sorry! Please don't send me away! I'll be good from now on and won't trouble Auntie Fruity anymore!"
