Once Upon A Twist

"Olivia Stewart, you swore on Mom's deathbed! Karma's going to catch up with you!"

"Karma, Sophie Cook? If there's any justice in this world, it should probably start with you. Five years ago, when Mom passed, you were barely thirteen. Dad was out drinking and gambling, never even coming home. It was me who dropped out of college to work and support you. But you? You got into Golden City Film Academy and acted like I didn't exist because you were embarrassed of me! What have you done in these past five years besides asking me for money?"

"…"

"Oh, right. You've learned something new now—how to steal my man!"

"Your man?" Sophie Cook laughed, a sharp, mocking sound that could shatter glass. "Olivia, he's just a sugar daddy. If he's rich, everyone can have him. Why do you think he's yours?"

Olivia's face turned pale, her hands trembling at her sides before she clenched them into fists and then let them go.

Isabella Peterson couldn't take it anymore. She stormed over, grabbed Sophie by the arm, slapped her twice without a hint of mercy, and then tossed her aside like a rag doll. "Shut up! Say another word, and I'll have you thrown out!"

Sophie held her face, blood trickling from her lip, looking defiant and amused. "Oh? Tell me, Isabella, would you marry her?"

Isabella was caught off guard, speechless.

Olivia closed her eyes in pain, then opened them again, looking at Isabella with a mix of regret and determination. "I'll handle this myself. You should leave."

"No way! What if you sell me while I'm gone? I'm staying right here!"

Isabella pouted, stubborn as ever.

Olivia rolled her eyes. "Fine, stand there. But no matter what happens, don't interfere!"

If this went on, Sophie would be in serious trouble.

Even now, Olivia couldn't help but feel a pang of pity for her sister.

"You're getting bold, aren't you? Daring to boss me around?" Isabella huffed, but seeing Olivia's icy glare, she reluctantly stepped back, grumbling, "Whatever you want to do, do it. I'll take care of the fallout."

Ignoring Isabella, Olivia stepped toward Sophie. Sophie shrank back, trying to scoot away, intimidated by Olivia's cold demeanor.

"Olivia," Sophie mumbled, her voice almost a whisper.

Olivia stood over her, her voice surprisingly gentle. "Sophie Cook, we grew up together. I may be only five years older, but sometimes it felt like you were my daughter. Isn't that funny?"

"My biggest mistake was sending you to film school. Just a year, and you've changed completely."

"I've noticed how hard you've been trying with Isabella. Whether you believe it or not, I considered letting you have him if he reciprocated your feelings. I'd have stepped aside, even if it broke my heart. But…"

Olivia paused, her eyes filled with a sad but firm resolve.

"I never imagined you'd disregard our bond. Your actions show no moral boundaries. You knew Isabella wasn't interested, yet you still tried to steal him!"

"No, it wasn't like that! Let me explain!" Sophie pleaded, looking desperate. "Isabella was drunk, and…"

Olivia chuckled softly. "Sophie, do you know how fake you look? As a child, you used that act to get me in trouble with our parents. As an adult, you used it to scam money from me. Do you think I'm that easy to fool? That I'm stupid? I've known all along—I just didn't want to face it. You're my only family left."

"Before today, I'd have believed you without question. But I saw everything."

Sophie opened her mouth, but no words came.

Silence hung in the air.

Finally, Olivia sighed. "Go back to your dorm, Sophie. I'll have someone take care of you until your foot heals. As for your tuition and living expenses, I'll make sure they're covered. But from now on, you're on your own."

Olivia turned away, her eyes glistening with unshed tears.

Seeing Olivia's resolve, Sophie panicked, crawling forward to grasp Olivia's pant leg, begging, "Sis, I'm sorry! Please don't abandon me! Mom's watching from above; don't leave me! How can you turn your back on me?"

Olivia fought the urge to shake her off, taking deep breaths to compose herself.

"Because Mom's watching, I'll see you through college. That's my final offer. Goodbye."

"No—I won't go!"

Sophie clung tighter, sobbing, "I won't do it again. Please forgive me! I'll never compete with you over anything you want. Give me another chance, please!"

Seeing Olivia hesitate, Sophie thought she'd softened, as she had so many times before. She clung to Olivia, pleading, "Don't leave me, sis! You're all I have!"

Olivia closed her eyes, fists clenching, and suddenly shouted, "Get out!"

Sophie let go, collapsing to the floor.

Olivia spun around, tears streaming down her face. She hurried away, as if afraid she'd change her mind, stumbling at the wine cellar stairs.

Isabella rushed to steady her, but she shook him off coldly.

"Olivia, Olivia!"

"Leave me alone!"

They awkwardly ascended the stairs, Isabella reeking of alcohol, stumbling after Olivia, trying to appease her. "Olivia, seeing you handle that was incredible. You're amazing!"

Standing at the cellar door, Olivia turned to glare at him, seeing his proud grin. "One more word and I'll push you back down there!"

"Uh, okay!"

Isabella wisely shut his mouth, but couldn't help muttering, "I'll wait till we're upstairs."

Olivia rolled her eyes.

Couldn't he see she was in no mood for this?

Lucas Wright waited quietly at the basement exit, watching Isabella trail Olivia like a scolded child. He tried to suppress his laughter.

Olivia emerged, avoiding Lucas's gaze. "Lucas, please have someone take my sister back to campus. Assign someone to care for her until she's better."

"Yes, Olivia."

Lucas nodded and left.

Isabella flopped onto a nearby lounger, lounging arrogantly. "Olivia, you must love me, right? A lot, a lot?"

Olivia glared. "Where do you get that confidence?"

"Why else would you be so tough on your sister? Why kick her out without hesitation?"

"Isabella!"

Already irritated, Olivia snapped.

"What does disciplining my sister have to do with you? Can you shut up? I don't want to deal with a drunk right now. I'm angry—really angry!"

"But I'm so happy, so happy!" Isabella pulled Olivia into his arms, the two of them tumbling onto the sofa.

Their faces were inches apart, their breaths mingling.

Isabella gazed into her eyes, his own sparkling with affection, drawing Olivia into a whirlwind of happiness.

Time seemed to freeze.

Olivia stared at Isabella, not wanting to blink.

Despite being pinned down, she felt like she was floating.

Isabella leaned in, nuzzling her neck like a child. "Olivia, I'm glad you didn't give me up!"
