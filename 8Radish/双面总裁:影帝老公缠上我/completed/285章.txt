Title: "Drama in the Hospital"

---

"Get lost!" Isabella Peterson shouted at Mia with utter disdain before turning back to Olivia Stewart, his voice suddenly gentle and sweet. "Sweetheart, there's nothing going on with her. I mean, I'm with you all the time. Where would I even find the time to..."

Olivia raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "So if you had the time, it would be okay?"

"No, no, no!" Isabella waved his hands defensively. "I would never even think about it!"

The bodyguards around them couldn't help but avert their eyes, unable to watch their boss grovel like this.

Olivia stared at Isabella skeptically. With a baby on the way, she felt entitled to throw a fit whenever she wanted, and who could blame her?

Isabella, not wanting to upset Olivia, turned to glare at Mia. His gaze was like icy daggers. Sending her away might only make things worse, though.

After a moment of contemplation, Isabella made a grand gesture. "Get this woman to take an amniocentesis test immediately!"

Having accompanied Olivia through numerous check-ups, his medical knowledge had improved quite a bit, even picking up some professional jargon along the way.

He was regaining his assertiveness!

Seeing Isabella regain his composure, Olivia's face lit up with a dazzling smile, her eyes narrowing in amusement.

Isabella watched her smug expression, knowing full well he'd been played, but he let her have her fun.

Mia was clueless about what an amniocentesis was and looked confused.

Olivia finished laughing and turned to Mia, eyebrows raised mischievously. "Do you know what amniocentesis is? It's when they take a long, thick needle and..."

She mimicked the motion of a needle piercing into Mia's stomach.

"Ah!" Mia shrieked, instinctively covering her belly. She looked at Olivia in panic. "Olivia, you're expecting too. How can you say such things?"

"No choice!" Olivia shrugged innocently. "It's for a paternity test. You know Isabella is so worried about me. He might even open you up just to be sure!"

As she said this, Olivia made an exaggerated motion of slicing open a belly, her sweet voice contrasting sharply with the gruesome imagery, turning it into a bizarrely comedic performance.

Mia was so frightened she could barely stand, her face ashen. Just as she was about to speak, another pregnant woman suddenly burst in, rushing to Mia's side. "No! Don't do this! Mia isn't carrying Isabella's child. It's all a misunderstanding!"

Olivia squinted at the newcomer, Grace Martin, who was also disguised in a rural getup. "Grace, you're pregnant too? Who's the father this time?"

Grace blushed furiously, quickly pulling a cushion from under her dress. "Actually, this belly is fake! And so is Mia's!"

As she spoke, Grace hurriedly removed the cushion from Mia's stomach as well, fearing Isabella might actually take action.

The fake pregnancy bellies were just cushions!

The men around them were dumbfounded.

Olivia's lips curled into a smile, clearly not surprised.

"You knew all along?" Isabella asked, touching her head.

"Hmph!" Olivia snorted. "Back when you were engaged to her, I played that role myself. Couldn't tell a fake belly back then? If she were really pregnant, do you think I'd scare her like that? Am I that heartless in your eyes?"

"But!" Olivia shot Isabella a sidelong glance. "If some woman did have your child, I might just cut it out of her in a fit of rage!"

Isabella burst into laughter, both loving and hating Olivia's cheeky mouth.

Mia's eyes flashed with resentment at the reminder of her past humiliation. But she swallowed her anger, knowing she had a mission to accomplish today.

Once the antics settled, Grace awkwardly called out, "Olivia..."

"Who said you could call her Olivia?" Isabella interrupted harshly. "She doesn't like you. Leave before I lose my temper!"

Grace, who was used to a life of luxury, was already humiliated by having to show up with a fake belly. Being scolded by Isabella only added insult to injury.

"Wait!" Olivia interjected. "I'm curious why you two went to such lengths to approach me!"

Grace looked gratefully at Olivia and quickly explained, "It's because of the welcome party incident. Oliver and Mia were out of line, and we've been wanting to apologize but..."

She glanced nervously at Isabella.

"Isabella wouldn't let us get close to you. We found out you had a check-up today, so we had no choice but to disguise ourselves like this!"

No wonder things had been peaceful since the welcome party. She thought Grace's husband had given up on the idea of reuniting their families, but it was Isabella keeping them at bay!

Making Grace and her daughter resort to such tactics—this man!

Olivia glanced at Isabella, a warm smile playing on her lips.

Isabella raised an eyebrow, leaning down to give Olivia a quick peck on the cheek.

Mia watched Isabella's affectionate smile, feeling as though salt was being rubbed into her wounds. This incredible man was once her fiancé. That spot by his side should have been hers!

If it weren't for Olivia, his affection would have been for her!

As she thought this, Mia glared at Olivia with eyes as sharp as poisoned needles, quickly looking away when Olivia caught her.

Want my man, do you? Not a chance!

Olivia turned and planted a soft kiss on Isabella's lips.

Isabella's breath hitched, and just as he was about to deepen the kiss, Olivia playfully pulled away.

This girl!

Isabella's gaze lingered on Olivia's lips, glossed with a tempting shine.

Grace, seeing Mia's increasingly pale face and the resentment in her eyes, squeezed Mia's hand, urging her to stay calm.

Not wanting her daughter to suffer further, Grace mustered up the courage to speak again, "Olivia..."

Already a little frustrated from being interrupted, Isabella shot icy glares at Grace.

Olivia, however, chuckled and nudged Isabella aside, facing Grace with a look of realization. "Oh, right! You came to apologize. How could we keep you waiting? If you're going to apologize, go ahead!"

With that, Olivia stepped forward, standing confidently.

Grace was taken aback. An apology was just a polite gesture. Usually, the other party would let it slide after seeing them back down. Who would have thought Olivia would take it seriously?

With no other choice, Grace nudged Mia, and the two of them bowed deeply to Olivia, saying, "Olivia, we're sorry!"

Olivia accepted the apology without a word, standing there like a proud little princess.

Grace and Mia waited for a response, but when none came, they repeated, louder, "Olivia, we were wrong. Please forgive us!"

"I hear your apology, but not every 'sorry' gets a 'no problem' in return," Olivia finally spoke, her tone chilly.

These two were as venomous as snakes, almost getting her run over and planning to have the bodyguards humiliate her. If it weren't for David Wright's protection, her own resilience, and Isabella's timely return...

Olivia shuddered at the thought, her usually gentle face hardening with a hint of menace.

Though she chose not to pursue the matter to annul the engagement, Olivia still held a grudge.

Anything that could irk Grace and her daughter was fair game!

Besides, they clearly hadn't changed at all!

If they were truly remorseful, why hadn't Mia revealed her fake belly when Olivia questioned Isabella? She clearly intended to cause trouble!

Olivia's gaze fell on Mia's sullen profile, her eyes growing colder.

Grace looked up in shock at Olivia and the man standing behind her, Isabella.

They'd lost face and apologized, yet Olivia wasn't forgiving them. What could they do now? How would they report this to Grace's husband?

Thinking quickly, Grace gave Mia a sharp tug.

Reluctantly, Mia spoke up, "Olivia, if you're willing to return to our family, I'll step aside and let you have the opportunity to marry Isabella."

"Ha! What a joke!" Olivia laughed coldly. "Mia, get this straight. You're not 'letting' me have anything. My man simply doesn't want you!"

All the color drained from Mia's face, her hands clenching tightly as she forced out, "I overestimated myself. Olivia, please come home!"

And so, the drama continued, with Olivia standing her ground, Isabella by her side, and Grace and Mia left with no choice but to back down, all in the bustling backdrop of a hospital hallway.
