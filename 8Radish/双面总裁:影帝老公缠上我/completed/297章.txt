The opportunity finally arrived.

Mia White stormed down the stairs, her voice echoing through the house as she shielded Grace Martin. "What gives you the right to hit my mom?" she demanded of her father, Jin White.

"You're no better!" Jin White retorted. Caught in a wave of anger, he swung his hand and slapped Mia.

Mia cried out in pain, stumbling backward and colliding with Grace. The scene quickly descended into chaos.

"Wow, what's all the commotion here?" Oliver Phillips sauntered in, grinning at the pandemonium. But when his eyes fell on the tear-streaked faces of Grace and Mia, his smile faltered. He hurried over to help Grace up from the floor.

"Son…" Grace wailed, her tears flowing freely.

"Please, Mom, don't do this. It's not a good look for you," Oliver said, wincing as he covered his ears.

Grace quieted down, her sobs turning into soft whimpers. Her dignity had been shattered; what image was left to maintain?

"That's better!" Oliver chuckled, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. "Mom, I just wanted to ask if you have any money left?"

Grace stared at Oliver's fingers rubbing together in the universal sign for cash, her shock turning to anger. "Oliver, have you no conscience? Didn't you see your dad hit me? And all you can think about is asking for money? Are you really that clueless?"

"So, the money's with Dad?" Oliver asked, unfazed. He turned his gaze toward Jin, eyes landing on the bottle of whiskey beside him. "Wow, you've got the good stuff. Dad, why don't we share a drink?"

"You useless brat!" Jin exploded, shaking with fury at his son's nonchalance. "If you had any ambition at all, would I have to go begging others? Our family's collapsing like a house of cards, and you're doing nothing!"

Oliver caught his father's wrist mid-air before another slap could land. "You want to hit me? Think carefully, Dad. Just give me some money, and I'll be out of here. I promise I won't get involved in this mess."

"Money, money, money! That's all you care about!" Jin's eyes bulged in frustration. "Our family's broke, bankrupt! Don't you get it?"

"Fine, fine, I won't argue with you." Oliver waved a hand dismissively, turning to spot the platinum necklace with a ruby pendant around Mia's neck. With a swift motion, he yanked it off and dashed away before anyone could stop him.

"You jerk! Give it back!" Mia shouted, chasing after him, but Oliver was already gone, leaving nothing but a trail of dust.

...

The news of the White family's downfall reached Olivia Stewart through the media a few days later. The day the White mansion went up for auction, she saw Jin's weary, gray visage on the screen and sighed softly.

Isabella Peterson placed a comforting hand on Olivia's, her warmth soothing. "Are you upset with me?"

Olivia shook her head. "You've given them enough to buy a small house. If they work hard, they can still support themselves. If they refuse to change and keep scheming, that's on them."

Olivia's eyes darkened as she spoke. To her, Jin White was just a biological contributor. She'd rather believe she was a child of the sea or the forest than acknowledge a father who was so heartless and self-serving.

Isabella pulled Olivia into a tight embrace, whispering, "Don't worry, Olivia. You've got me. We'll be a happy family."

"Yeah." Olivia nestled closer, "When will you bring Tommy home? I miss him so much!"

"Soon," Isabella promised, a flicker of hesitation in her eyes before they softened. If Olivia wanted the child, she wouldn't deny her.

After the bankruptcy, Jin White didn't dare approach Isabella. He wanted to rebuild his fortunes but found no one willing to help. In the end, he forced Grace and Mia to find work.

Grace, pampered all her life, and Mia, always sheltered, had no idea how to work. Their resentment toward Olivia festered, plotting revenge. If they couldn’t win her over, they’d find another way to bring her down.

They followed Olivia for weeks, waiting for the right moment. Olivia rarely went out, and when she did, Isabella was usually by her side, surrounded by security. But every so often, Olivia would visit the Angel Orphanage, leaving her bodyguards outside so as not to scare the kids.

On one such day, with Isabella away on a business trip, Olivia headed to the orphanage alone.

Grace and Mia, hiding in the shadows, seized their chance and snuck in through the back door. They had befriended the kitchen staff over the past few days, and with a few small favors, had no trouble getting inside.

As they entered, the kitchen lady warned, "Remember, you just want to catch a glimpse of the lady. Don’t get me in trouble! She's kind, but if you upset her, the boss will be furious."

"We know, we know!" Grace and Mia nodded eagerly, playing the part of humble villagers. Their shabby appearance fooled the kitchen lady as they slipped through, pretending to be helpers.

In the yard, Olivia played with the children. Grace and Mia edged closer, each clutching a small glass bottle filled with acid.

Their plan was simple: splash the acid on Olivia's face and escape in the ensuing chaos. With Olivia disfigured, who would care about revenge? Surely Isabella wouldn’t go to extremes for someone no longer beautiful?

Their scheme seemed foolproof until a little boy noticed the bottle in Mia’s hand and innocently asked, "Auntie, is that a drink?"

Mia jerked her hand back, about to snap at the child when Olivia, sensing danger, pulled the kids back and retreated several steps. "Mia White, how did you get in here? What are you planning?"

Mia raised her hand, but the kitchen lady rushed over, grabbing her arm. "I told you not to cause trouble! Look at what you’ve done! I knew I should have checked on you!"

Grace saw the opportunity slip away and quickly signaled Mia to hide the bottle. She turned to Olivia and bowed deeply, "I'm sorry, Mrs. Stewart! We didn’t mean to disturb you. We came because our family went bankrupt, and my husband's a drunk who hits us. We need work. Mia just wanted to ask for your sympathy. It’s her fault for being foolish. Sorry for bothering you. Mia, let’s go!"

Olivia had never seen Grace so humble. In the past, Grace had asked for favors, but there was always an underlying arrogance. Now, she looked worn, her pride stripped away.

Olivia knew their appearance wasn't just for show, but seeing their defeated demeanor, she decided against confrontation. With a dismissive wave, she said, "If you're here for work, go ahead. Don't keep the kitchen waiting."

"Yes," Grace replied, pulling Mia along, but her eyes caught on the bracelet on Olivia’s wrist, a look of shock crossing her face. "That bracelet..."

Olivia touched the wooden beads. "It's a keepsake from my mother. Why?"

Grace's eyes widened in disbelief. "But it’s mine! It’s been in my family for generations. I lost it on a trip to the countryside, and now I know that woman must have stolen it!"

"Grace Martin!" Olivia slammed her hand on the table, standing firm. "How dare you accuse my late mother? What's your agenda?"

The commotion drew the security team, who quickly surrounded Grace and Mia.

Mia, startled, dropped her bottle, which shattered on her foot, causing her to scream in agony.

Everyone gasped as they saw her foot begin to smoke and sizzle, the acrid scent of burning flesh filling the air.

Mia writhed on the ground, her cries piercing through the chaos as the children, terrified, began to wail.

Olivia instructed the orphanage director to take the children inside before turning her icy gaze on Grace. "You came to the orphanage to cause trouble?"

Grace fell to her knees, pleading, "Please, Mrs. Stewart, have mercy! My daughter is in pain. Get her some help!"

Olivia’s expression hardened. "If this had been thrown on me, would you have helped?"

Grace was left speechless, guilt and fear warring within her.
