Sophie Cook tried to get out of bed, but as soon as she moved, the room spun like a merry-go-round. She gave up and sat back down, waiting for the dizziness to pass.

Time dragged on, and Isabella Peterson still hadn't returned. Olivia Stewart, peering out the window into the fading daylight, felt a storm of suspicion brewing. Could it really be like one of those over-the-top soap operas where her boyfriend and sister...

Olivia couldn't sit still any longer. She forced herself out of bed, clutching onto the furniture for balance, staggering step by step until she reached the window.

Exhausted, she plopped onto the wide window seat, leaned her head back against the window frame, and gazed outside. What she saw made her freeze.

In the garden, two familiar figures sat across from each other, engrossed in conversation. Around them, golden tulips bloomed, and the garden lights cast a warm, romantic glow over the scene. Olivia's lips twisted into a bitter smile.

It was her idea to send Isabella, so why was she feeling jealous now? Silly girl!

Yet, no matter how much she tried to convince herself otherwise, the pang of jealousy bubbled up relentlessly. Even if she couldn't see Sophie Cook and Isabella's expressions from this distance, she could easily imagine the charming, picture-perfect moment they were sharing: the dashing guy and the beautiful girl—what a sight!

The evening breeze carried the scent of flowers and faint laughter. Olivia couldn't help but recall the moment Sophie Cook fainted into Isabella's arms. Her lips curled into an even more bitter smile.

What happened then? Did Isabella catch Sophie in a princess carry? And who carried me? Isabella's bodyguard, or a Good Samaritan Sophie called for help?

The image of Sophie in Isabella's arms, and Isabella standing motionless in front of her, replayed in Olivia's mind, making her head throb.

He's a neat freak! He must care, Olivia thought, tracing her fingers over her face. Then she remembered Isabella's earlier threat to settle scores and realized with a jolt that Isabella had discovered the secret of her scars.

At least she still had this face! Olivia laughed bitterly. She used to resent the name "White," but perhaps she should be grateful for her resemblance to that girl. Otherwise, Isabella might have tossed her out long ago.

Laughing, Olivia felt tears well up and spill over, one after another.

Meanwhile, in the garden, the scene between Isabella and Sophie was pretty, but the atmosphere was far from the cozy picture Olivia imagined. Isabella's sharp gaze was fixed on Sophie with a kind of cold scrutiny.

Sophie tried making small talk but quickly resorted to sipping her coffee, intimidated by Isabella's perceptive eyes, which seemed to see right through her. Her usual tricks of feigned innocence and charm were useless here.

After a while, Isabella spoke, his voice cutting through the air, "Tell me about that night."

Sophie started, "That night, my sister and I were rehearsing late into the evening, and then we went to grab some food..."

Tears welled up and spilled over her lashes as she spoke, painting a pitiful picture.

Isabella frowned, tapping the table impatiently. "Find a private place to cry it out, then come back to talk!"

"I'm sorry, Isabella!" Sophie quickly wiped her tears, realizing her usual theatrics were futile against this cold, sharp-tongued man.

"I expect you to dry those tears and answer my questions properly," Isabella commanded, his tone brooking no argument.

Sophie nodded obediently. "Yes, Isabella."

Isabella sipped his coffee with a casual grace, exuding an air of effortless elegance. Sophie couldn't help but stare, her eyes wide and admiring.

Isabella glanced at her dismissively, then suddenly slammed the cup down with a thud. "Who suggested going to that alley for dinner?"

Sophie hesitated, her voice barely a whisper. "It was... me."

"Bang!" Isabella hit the table, shattering the cup, coffee splattering everywhere.

"Of all the streets, why choose that alley? Did you know Olivia would be in danger, or was this all your plan?"

"No, no, Isabella, absolutely not!"

Sophie's face turned pale as she shook, her voice trembling.

"The little shop there makes great spicy fish, and my sister used to love our mom's spicy fish. I thought that place tasted similar, so..."

"So, that night was just a coincidence?"

"Yes, it was just an accident. I regret it deeply. If I could, I would have preferred to be the one hurt instead of my sister!"

At this point, Sophie was nearly shouting, her voice filled with crafted emotion, slipping back into her usual role of the tragic heroine.

Isabella's eyes flickered with thought as he quietly typed something into his phone. "Tell me exactly what happened."

"We went through the back gate. It was my fault—I didn't know the street had been demolished. I just wanted to take a shortcut because my sister was hungry, and then..."

Sophie sniffled, looking pitiful.

"Get to the point!" Isabella snapped, clearly annoyed, his brow furrowing.

Seeing his genuine distaste for her tears, Sophie composed herself and recounted the night without embellishing too much. After all, Olivia was also involved, and she couldn't risk inconsistencies. Besides, she was a victim too, so suspicion was unlikely.

Sophie cleverly emphasized the thugs' leering at women and the long, drawn-out time before Isabella appeared.

Though the sight of Olivia at the end wasn't the worst, anyone smart would question how a single woman resisted five or six opportunistic thugs for so long. What might have happened during that time?

Isabella's handsome face was stony, his hand clenched into a fist, veins bulging.

Sophie glanced at him, secretly pleased. She knew these were the things that men found hardest to accept, and her words had surely struck a chord.

What Isabella felt, beyond anger, was a deep sense of concern. He thought of Olivia's bloodied hands and the rusty, blood-stained pipe left at the scene. How much strength had she summoned from her small frame to hold off those men for so long?

His phone buzzed with a message from Michael Wright, confirming the existence of a small restaurant in the area, famous for its spicy fish. This meant Sophie's suspicion could be largely dismissed.

Isabella discreetly deleted the message, pocketed his phone, then asked, "What did they look like?"

"Uh?" Sophie blinked, surprised by the question. She hadn't expected him to focus on the thugs' appearance rather than what his girlfriend had endured.

"What did those men look like? Can you describe them or draw them?"

Sophie shook her head vigorously, feigning terror. "No, no, I don't know! It was too dark, and I was too scared—I didn't see anything clearly!"

"Useless! Keep thinking until you remember!"

Isabella tossed Michael's number to Sophie, his voice commanding. "If you remember anything, tell him. And don't breathe a word of this to Olivia!"

Only then did Sophie fully grasp that Isabella had agreed to this meeting solely to gather information about the attack and identify the thugs.

But why didn't he ask Olivia directly?

Sophie lowered her eyes, murmuring, "Maybe my sister remembers better."

"Dare to mention this to Olivia, and I'll make sure you regret it," Isabella's voice was icy with determination.

Under the table, Sophie clenched her fists. Isabella, are you so afraid of Olivia being hurt? Even after she's been humiliated by a gang of thugs, you're still protecting her feelings, too scared to even ask. What's so special about her?

What do I, Sophie Cook, lack compared to her?

What is it?

Sophie ground her teeth, her gaze falling on the phone number before her. Her eyes glinted with a plan.

Oh, Isabella, if Olivia means that much to you, let's see how you handle this!
