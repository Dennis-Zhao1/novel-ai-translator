It Was Actually a Lie Detector Chair

"Really...?"

Alyssa was a bit taken aback, hesitant even. Helping out the future lady of the house was an honor, but she wasn’t sure if she should make such a decision without Ethan King's explicit instructions.

Olivia Stewart noticed Alyssa's hesitation and carefully chose her words. "Ethan must trust you a lot to have you take care of me. In the future, when he works late, I might need to trouble you to bring him coffee or something."

Alyssa's eyes lit up suddenly, a quick blush sweeping across her cheeks. Olivia knew she had hit the mark.

Alyssa handed her phone to Olivia, standing quietly by. Not wanting to directly ask Alyssa to leave, Olivia called the gym, walking away as she spoke to create some distance between them.

Predictably, Olivia got an earful from her manager. After some pleading, she managed to secure a few days off, though her bonus was now a lost cause. Hanging up, Olivia gritted her teeth and muttered a few choice words about Ethan King's ancestors.

Leaning on the railing, she glanced sideways at Alyssa to make sure she hadn't followed before quickly dialing Ethan's number. Lowering her voice, she whispered, "Ethan, I'm alright! I don't know the exact location, just that it's an island with a bunch of castles..."

Just as she was speaking, her phone was snatched away. Turning around in shock, she saw Isabella Peterson glaring down at her, his handsome face dark with anger, as if ready to swallow her whole.

"Olivia, are you pretending to have amnesia for that sissy? You ungrateful traitor!"

Instinctively, Olivia took a step back. Isabella, in his current state, was terrifying.

Isabella advanced, pinning her against the railing, gripping her chin tightly. "Olivia, I should never have spoiled you!"

Olivia tilted her head back, seeing the world around her warp and twist. Indeed, even the most beautiful scenery becomes distorted when viewed from the wrong angle. She trusted in the belief that sometimes, standing up for oneself was necessary.

Suddenly finding her courage, Olivia met Isabella's gaze. Calmly, she spoke, "I am not Olivia. The one deluding themselves here is you, Isabella. If you're sick, take medication, but I won't sacrifice my life for your games!"

"Life? Olivia, do you think you can talk to me about life? You walked into my life and then tried to run. Now you want out? I’ll make your life a mess and play with you forever!"

Olivia shivered, "Isabella, you lunatic! I've told you countless times, I am not Olivia! What will it take for you to believe me? How can I prove it?"

"You want to prove yourself? Fine!" Isabella suddenly released her, turning away coldly.

Olivia slumped against the railing, feeling weak and depleted of all courage.

After a while, Lucas Wright approached, unusually somber. "Olivia, please come with me."

She followed Lucas through a maze of corridors, finally stopping at a room. Lucas sighed deeply as he looked at her, "Olivia, why put yourself through this?"

Olivia offered a bitter smile, "Everyone has their principles. Would you be willing to be someone’s stand-in?"

Lucas shook his head and opened the door, "Please, go inside."

Stepping into the empty room, Olivia frowned at the large black chair in the center. "What’s Isabella planning to do to me?"

She knew she had tested Isabella's patience one too many times. Someone like him, prideful and privileged, wouldn’t let go easily.

Lucas gestured to the chair, "Please, have a seat."

Olivia complied, watching as Lucas wrapped wires around her, connecting them to various instruments. Her mind raced with images of interrogation scenes from TV, electric chairs and whatnot.

"Isabella is holding me against my will, using illegal methods. This is a crime, Lucas, and you're helping him!"

Lucas couldn't help but chuckle, carefully adjusting the wires. "Olivia, save your breath. The young master is the law here. You can’t do anything about it."

Olivia's voice quivered slightly, "Then just make it quick!"

Lucas's face crinkled into a smile, his tone gentle, "No need to worry, Olivia. It won't hurt at all."

This sounded eerily like something said before an execution.

Olivia closed her eyes in despair, regretting ever provoking Isabella. Being a substitute was better than ending up a victim. Her life was just beginning; she wasn't ready to give it up.

Yet, the expected pain didn't come. Instead, Lucas sat beside her, chatting calmly.

"What’s your name?"

"Olivia Stewart."

"Age?"

"Twenty-three."

"Occupation?"

"Tea server at the Golden Body Gym."

...

"Were you ever called Olivia?"

"No."

"Did anything significant happen five years ago?"

Suddenly agitated, Olivia's eyes flew open, and Lucas watched her expectantly.

"Five years ago, I was studying nursing. Then... my mother passed away, my father turned to drinking and gambling, and I dropped out to work and care for my sister..."

Olivia struggled, cold sweat on her brow.

"Enough!"

A cold command rang out, and Lucas quickly stopped the machine, freeing Olivia from the wires.

Isabella stood at the door, his face grim.

After a moment, Olivia slowly opened her eyes, disoriented and confused, like a lost fawn.

Lucas handed a stack of papers to Isabella. "Master, everything Olivia said was true."

In other words, she was Olivia Stewart, not Olivia.

Isabella stared at the documents, his expression icy, body stiff as a stone.

Olivia felt as if she had awoken from a dream, realizing that the black chair was merely a high-tech lie detector. Just a false alarm!

Shaking her still-dizzy head, Olivia stood. "Can I leave now?"

Isabella looked down at her with intense eyes, "Did I say you could go?"

"Isabella, you're being unreasonable!" She had passed the lie detector; she wasn't Olivia. Why couldn't she leave?

Isabella abruptly turned and walked away, his retreating figure seeming unexpectedly hasty.

Olivia turned to Lucas, "Lucas, can I leave now?"

Lucas bowed slightly, "Sorry, Olivia, without the young master's permission, you can't leave the castle."

"When can I leave then?"

Lucas looked troubled, "That depends on when the young master..."

Olivia felt incredibly dejected. Even with the misunderstanding cleared up, what more did Isabella want? Was he going to make her pay for crashing his wedding?

The thought sent shivers down her spine.

"Olivia, why don't I take you back to your room to rest?"

"No need. Lucas, since everything's cleared up, please stop calling me Olivia."

"Sorry, Olivia. Until the young master gives new instructions, your name won't change."

"Fine, call me whatever you want. I'm going for a walk, don’t have anyone follow me."

Lucas watched her leave, not bothering to send anyone after her. The castle was vast, and Olivia couldn’t escape on her own. Getting lost was more likely, but with surveillance and staff everywhere, she wouldn’t run into trouble.

Once Olivia's figure disappeared, Lucas turned and headed to the other side of the spiral staircase, his usual cheerful face now touched with concern.

The young master had never shown interest in women, except for Olivia. Yet, when she left, he threw himself into building his empire, so much so that it pained Lucas to watch.

The young master, proud and particular, had personally overseen every detail of the castle. Now that he had finally brought Olivia back, only for it to be a misunderstanding, could he handle the disappointment?

Lucas found Isabella on a terrace, staring out at the surrounding castles, his silhouette lonely and forlorn.

Daring to approach, Lucas respectfully bowed. "Master!"

"If you're here to ask me to release her, save your breath."

"The master's decisions are always well-founded. Lucas only worries that if the real Olivia returns..."

"She is Olivia. There’s no real or fake!"

"The master's judgment is usually spot-on, but Olivia seems too naive to have the cunning to fool the lie detector, nor does she have a reason."

"She might be innocent, but something about this isn't right! I will find another way to make her admit it!"

Lucas's concern deepened. Even if he proved his point, what then? Olivia clearly didn’t remember Isabella and was intent on leaving, while Isabella’s obsession was growing stronger.

What would the future hold?
