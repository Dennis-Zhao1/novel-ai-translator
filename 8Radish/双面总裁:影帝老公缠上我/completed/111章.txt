Title: Seeking Justice for Lost Benefits

Isabella Peterson lounged casually, her legs crossed, and snapped her fingers with a flourish. "I'm letting you all go, but not without making a statement—you're fired! But before you leave, I have some good news. Yours truly managed to cure my girlfriend's psychological barrier!"

"Really?" The experts exchanged glances, casting furtive looks at Olivia Stewart, who was nestled comfortably in Isabella's arms. She seemed like a picture of contentment, without a trace of her previous aversion to being touched by men.

Feeling a bit uneasy, Olivia tried to squirm away, but Isabella's strong embrace kept her firmly in place.

"Isabella!" Olivia whispered urgently, giving his leg a discreet pinch, a signal to let her go.

"You want more?" Isabella teased, a mischievous grin playing on his lips.

Wait, what? Olivia blinked in confusion and then realized she had pinched his muscular leg by mistake. Her face flushed crimson as she quickly withdrew her hand.

Isabella chuckled, his voice a mix of playful arrogance. "I like that! Keep going!"

Yeah, right! Olivia folded her hands primly on her lap, trying her best to look demure.

The experts, a group of serious-looking individuals, peered at Olivia through their thick glasses, examining her as if she were an intriguing specimen. They were puzzled. They had spent a week trying various treatments for Olivia's psychological issues, with little to no success. Yet, in just two short days without any consultation, she seemed miraculously cured.

Professor Hughes couldn't hold back his curiosity. "Isabella, could you share how you managed to cure Olivia so quickly? Typically, psychological barriers require a prolonged and gradual treatment process. Could we study this as a successful case?"

"Study?" Isabella raised an eyebrow, his expression haughty. "None of you old-timers could even begin to understand my methods!"

Undeterred, Professor Hughes pressed on, "Please, Isabella, enlighten us!"

Isabella surveyed the room with a superior air, raising his voice for all to hear. "Listen up! My method for curing psychological barriers is simple—pounce, pounce, and pounce some more!"

The room erupted in shocked whispers. Olivia, mortified, buried her face in Isabella's chest. Seriously! This embarrassing topic made her want to disappear!

Those eager experts, however, seemed unfazed by the playful jab, instead earnestly discussing the possibility. "Could it really be that simple? Have we been approaching this all wrong?"

"Traditionally, we've always advocated a gradual approach, avoiding excessive stimulation to prevent adverse effects. But it seems this method could be applicable in psychological therapy as well. I can't believe we never considered it. What a waste of our experience!"

"It's not like that..." Olivia started to explain, but Isabella gently but firmly pushed her back into her seat.

He whispered in her ear, "If you don't want to spend the rest of the day somewhere else, be a good girl."

The thought of that scenario made Olivia shudder, and she clamped her mouth shut.

After a moment, she couldn't help but whisper, "But is it okay to deceive them like this? I never really had a psychological barrier. I just didn't feel like dealing with you."

"You little devil, pretending to be sick to avoid me? I'll deal with you later!" Isabella gritted his teeth, causing Olivia to fall silent.

Uh-oh, looks like she said the wrong thing again.

"Would you really let them study me like a lab rat?"

"Of course not! My methods of pampering a woman are top secret. No way I'd let them learn!"

Olivia sighed, exasperated. Was a normal conversation even possible?

"Then why did you call them here? Just to brag about curing me?"

"Exactly! These old fogies couldn't stand to see me happy, diagnosing you with a psychological barrier and making me suffer for days. I had to get justice for my lost benefits!"

Olivia rolled her eyes. Justice, huh? You'd already more than made up for it these past few days!

Seeing her frustrated expression, Isabella chuckled and, in a good mood, planted a light kiss on her cheek. "Alright, you're all dismissed! Go back to selling cabbages or whatever it is you do!"

The experts, usually so authoritative, were now humbled, and they quietly filed out, offering Isabella respectful nods as they left.

Olivia tugged at his sleeve, whispering, "Don't be so harsh. It was just a misdiagnosis. No need to make them feel bad."

"They had it coming! Do you realize their misdiagnosis cost me days of happiness?" Isabella grumbled, his annoyance evident, like a starving man whose sandwich had been snatched away.

Olivia groaned internally. She could already picture herself being teased mercilessly by Isabella in the days to come. It was almost unbearable!

She needed a plan to escape, or she'd be stuck with him all day, every day.

To her surprise, when Olivia expressed her desire to continue her acting classes, Isabella agreed, with the condition that the instructors from the Silverstone Acting Academy come to teach her at home.

Olivia didn't object. The academy held too many unpleasant memories, especially after the incident with Sophie Cook. She still wasn't sure how to face her sister.

Despite everything, Olivia couldn't completely sever her familial bond with Sophie.

She approached Lucas Wright with a question that had been on her mind. "Lucas, has Sophie's foot healed?"

"Yes, Miss Sophie is fully recovered. Everything is fine now, Miss Olivia. Rest assured!"

"Thank you, Lucas," Olivia replied with a strained smile. After all this time, she could finally talk about Sophie without overwhelming pain. Isabella's relentless attention had left her exhausted, with little room for distress. Now, she felt better. Time really does heal all wounds!

But what about Isabella's own scars, the ones named "White Yiko"? When would they heal?

Perhaps they'd become a part of him, like a hidden scar etched into his soul.

Olivia's eyes clouded with a touch of melancholy.

People are inherently greedy. Surviving that ordeal, she had thought she'd be content just being near Isabella, even as a stand-in. But now, she couldn't help but want more.

Isabella watched from the second-floor railing, catching a glimpse of the wistfulness in Olivia's eyes as she turned away.

What was she regretting?

A month flew by, and soon it was time for the new series, "Send an Angel to Love You," to begin filming. Olivia received the schedule from the Silverstone Film Company. As the leading lady, she was assigned her own image consultant, makeup artist, and assistant.

Rumors that Olivia had lost her lead role due to bad publicity were quickly dispelled. As for the so-called "New Hong Productions" and "Director Adams," it turned out to be a hoax. Olivia wasn't interested in pursuing what role Sophie Cook played in the deception. She simply told Isabella's investigators, "Let it go. It's over."

Sophie Cook, cast in a minor role, also received an invitation to the filming ceremony on September 20th.

Holding the invitation, Sophie trembled with excitement. Her chance to shine had finally arrived!

"Olivia Stewart, I'll outshine you! I'll show the world who truly deserves the spotlight!"

Consumed by jealousy, Sophie immersed herself in self-improvement. But those luxury cosmetics and limited edition dresses and bags were far beyond her budget. She had already exhausted her tuition and living expenses repaying loans.

What now?

Sophie decided to withdraw her remaining tuition and living expenses to splurge on the ceremony. But a quick check revealed no extra funds.

Frustrated, she called Lucas, "Uncle Lucas, can you give me all the remaining money at once? That way, I won't have to bother you every month!"

"It's no bother, Miss Sophie. But according to your sister's instructions, I can only send it monthly. I advise you to spend wisely."

Sophie slammed down the phone, seething with anger.

"Olivia, did you foresee this and plan it all along?"

Ha! Afraid of me stealing your thunder? I won't let you win!

Still, Sophie refused to beg Olivia for help. But without her sister's support, she had no financial resources.

After much deliberation, Sophie decided to venture into risky, high-stakes lending. It was a dangerous path, one that could ruin her if she couldn't repay. But it was the fastest way to get money. Desperate, she saw no other choice.
