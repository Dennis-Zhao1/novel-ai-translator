Olivia Stewart was practically glowing with excitement as she and Isabella Peterson strolled through the expansive mall. She gestured towards the endless rows of designer displays. "But seriously, all this stuff?" she exclaimed, a bit overwhelmed.

Isabella chuckled, tapping her friend playfully on the head. "Relax! You don't have to take everything home today. We can keep track of what you like, and you can pick them out gradually."

Olivia's eyes widened. "There's so much here, I could wear a different outfit every day for the rest of my life and never run out!"

Sensing her thoughts, Isabella gently ruffled Olivia's hair. "Don't overthink it! I've already noted down your preferences. Anything you don't want, we'll just rebrand and sell. No waste!"

Olivia breathed a sigh of relief. Holding Isabella's hand, they headed towards the crystal jewelry section. "I know you have money to spare, but I hope you're not just throwing it all away on meaningless things!"

"Meaningless?" Isabella protested, her voice rising. "Come on, Olivia! Aren't these the things women adore? Can't you see I'm trying to impress you here?"

Olivia quickly softened Isabella's flare-up. "I'm really happy today! I just meant maybe next time, don't go overboard. Your money could do more meaningful things, like building a children's home or starting a fund for kids with heart conditions..."

"Enough!" Isabella gently interrupted, clasping Olivia's fingers one by one. "If you want to do those things, I'll have someone handle it. You just focus on taking care of yourself and the baby, and looking fabulous."

Olivia giggled, "So you want me to live like a pampered princess, huh?"

"Why not?" Isabella raised an eyebrow. "I can afford to spoil you! And if there's something you really want to do, go for it."

"Olivia, I just want you to be happy," Isabella said sincerely, holding Olivia's hand.

Olivia was touched, her eyes misting a bit. "I feel the same way, Isabella."

They made their way back to the crystal jewelry counter, where the clerk presented Olivia with a clover bracelet. Her cheeks flushed as the clerk addressed her as "Mrs. Peterson," but seeing Isabella's pleased expression, she decided to let it slide.

Olivia admired the bracelet, unable to hide her delight. Isabella smirked, taking it from her hand. "Let me put it on for you."

Olivia playfully snatched it back. "Hold on, I haven't finished looking at it yet!"

She examined the intricately designed clovers, murmuring as she went. "K for Kiddo, G for Gem, M for their lovely mom, Olivia..."

Isabella watched her, a hint of nervousness flickering in his eyes.

Finally, Olivia reached the last clover. "C!" she exclaimed, noting the tiny letter.

Isabella explained quietly, "The little one doesn't have a full name yet, so I just used the initial."

Though the explanation was shaky, Olivia simply smiled and asked the clerk, "Can I add another clover to this bracelet?"

The clerk glanced at Isabella, who nodded slightly.

"This bracelet is a unique design by Miss Helen from Y Country," the clerk explained apologetically. "We'll need to send it back for redesign, which might take a while. Is that okay?"

Olivia nodded with a warm smile. "That's fine, I can wait."

The clerk carefully returned the bracelet to its box as Olivia turned to Isabella, linking her arm with his. "Let's go!"

Noticing Isabella's slightly off expression, Olivia nudged him playfully. "I know you want to protect us all, but you're part of this family too. I want you to have your own special clover! We'll add another one for the little one, and that C can be yours!"

Olivia assumed Isabella had simply forgotten, so she made it easy for him to save face. Little did she know, Isabella had intentionally overlooked it.

Isabella felt a tinge of guilt for his earlier pettiness, nodding softly. After all, if the little one was Olivia's child, he was his child too.

He tried to reassure himself, but the memory of a certain letter kept pricking at him, like a persistent thorn.

"Oops!" Olivia suddenly gasped. "I forgot to tell them what letter to engrave!"

She spun around, ready to head back, but Isabella gently stopped her. "I'll let Helen know. I invited her personally."

Olivia fidgeted, embarrassed. "I couldn't even handle this small thing, Isabella. Do you think I'm useless?"

Isabella smirked, "You don't have to be useful. Just keep me warm at night."

What?! Was that really all she had to aspire to?

Flustered, Olivia playfully punched Isabella's chest, eliciting a warm, rumbling laugh from him.

As they exited the luxury mall, Isabella pressed the button for the third floor instead of the first. Olivia looked at him, puzzled. "Where are we going now?"

Isabella wrapped her small hand in his, his voice cool and composed. "You'll see."

This mysterious guy was full of surprises today!

Olivia waited patiently as the elevator ascended.

"Ding!"

As the doors slid open, Olivia was greeted by a dazzling array of fashion items, like stepping into a massive wardrobe.

Recalling her earlier experience, Olivia didn't rush to the clothes. Instead, she peered up at Isabella with wide eyes. "Tell me you didn't stock this entire floor with clothes for me?"

Isabella nodded. "These are the latest designs from Milan and Paris Fashion Weeks, all custom-tailored for you."

Olivia's jaw dropped. Wow, this guy was over-the-top!

Most people got a couple of outfits, but Isabella? He went all out, gifting her an entire mall!

Pouting, Olivia protested, "I'm not even that into clothes, Isabella. Why spend so much?"

Isabella's expression was unyielding. "Don't worry about the money. I have plenty, and I want to."

Alright, big spender, you win!

Olivia picked out a few dresses she liked, handing them to a clerk to be wrapped up. Isabella, ever the gentleman, took on the role of carrying the bags, despite the bodyguards trailing them.

They continued upwards, browsing through bags, shoes, and accessories. By the time Olivia realized the entire building was a personal shopping haven designed for her, she was genuinely moved.

Sipping coffee on the rooftop terrace, Olivia asked, "Isabella, when did you start planning all this?"

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "Planning? This was no secret operation."

Olivia grinned, resting her chin in her hand. "Alright, Mr. Big Shot, when did you openly start preparing this one-of-a-kind shopping paradise?"

"A while back," Isabella admitted, glancing down, his lashes casting shadows over his eyes.

Olivia leaned over, planting a quick kiss on his forehead. "Isabella, even though you spent so much it makes me cringe a little, I'm really happy."

Isabella frowned playfully. "That's all I get for my efforts?"

Olivia was bewildered. "What do you want, then?"

This guy was clearly thinking about more intimate rewards, but she was still recovering from having the baby. Not a chance!

Sensing her thoughts, Isabella's gaze lingered on her, a hint of mischief in his eyes. "I wouldn't mind seeing you in some of those outfits from the fifth floor."

"Pervert!" Olivia's face flushed crimson as she playfully scolded him.

He had thought of everything, alright. The fifth floor was packed with high-end bars and all sorts of exotic costumes. She'd barely glanced at them before dragging Isabella away, adamant about skipping that section. Yet, he still had it in mind!

"Dream on! I'm not catering to your quirky tastes!" Olivia declared firmly.

Isabella drummed his fingers on the table, a sly smile playing on his lips. "You sure you won't?"

Olivia was resolute. "Absolutely not!"

Isabella's gaze was steady. "Alright then, I'll have the clerk pick out a few spicy ones for you to try later..."
