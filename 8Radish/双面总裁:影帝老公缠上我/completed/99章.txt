He Finally Arrived

Olivia Stewart gripped the metal rod once more and swung it with all her might.

"Thud!" "Bang!"

Some thugs grunted as they fell, blood splattering like fireworks. All Olivia could see was red, her hands clenching tightly around the rod as she swung it with everything she had. But gradually, her vision blurred, her arms grew heavy, and her swings slowed down until sheer willpower was all that kept her going.

Suddenly, one of the thugs grabbed the other end of the rod and yanked it hard. Pain shot through Olivia's palms like a thousand needles, and the rod slipped from her grasp. The momentum sent her sprawling forward.

"Smack!"

Olivia hit the cold, hard alley pavement, surrounded instantly by the thugs. The one who had snatched the rod tapped it against his hand, gritting his teeth in frustration.

"This woman packs a punch. I’ve taken quite a few hits already. Alright, boys, let’s finish this!"

"Hold on!" a scar-faced leader barked, halting them. "Let's get down to business first."

With a knowing grin, the thugs slowly closed in on Olivia, who weakly tried to push herself away, leaving bloody palm prints on the ground with each agonizing move.

The thugs taunted her, "What's wrong? Weren't you tough a moment ago? Get up and fight!"

Using her last bit of strength, Olivia retreated step by step. She knew escape was impossible, but she aimed to reach the wall, ready to bash her head if it meant denying them the satisfaction.

It wasn't that she valued her purity over life; she just couldn't bear the thought of Isabella Peterson's disappointed, disgusted gaze. She'd rather die clean than face that.

The thought of Isabella spurred Olivia on, opening her eyes a bit more as she forced herself to retreat another step.

Suddenly, her hand grabbed a foot. She had been surrounded—no way out, not even in death.

"Get away!" Olivia rasped, her voice a raw cry, the last note of a desperate life song.

"Fiery, I like it!" one thug jeered. "This one's got some spice!"

"Back off!" Olivia tried to shout again, but her voice failed her, reduced to a dying animal's whimper. Her head sagged, her vision blurred with countless hands reaching for her.

"Bang!"

A sudden, loud noise echoed from the alley entrance, startling the thugs into looking back.

Olivia lay still on the ground, her half-open eyes catching sight of a tall, stern figure at the alley's mouth. The man held a gun skyward, the flash illuminating his chiseled features like a god descended.

"It's a gun! Run!"

The thugs scattered, leaving Olivia behind.

Isabella Peterson, you finally came!

Olivia struggled to lift her head, wanting to see the man she was inexplicably drawn to one last time. But her eyelids felt impossibly heavy, opening just a sliver before drooping shut.

In her last glimpse of light, she saw Isabella leap forward with the grace of a panther.

"Isabella…" Olivia tried to call, but no sound came out, only a faint lip tremble.

She lay there, broken and defenseless on the cold stone, a shattered doll. Her eyes, no longer moving, fixed on where Isabella had come from.

Isabella stopped a few feet away, staring at her, unable to move. His usually sharp eyes filled with fear.

His hands hung by his sides, fists clenched and trembling. He dared not touch her, afraid he was too late, that she'd leave him with only a cold body.

Holding onto her last thread of consciousness, Olivia watched as Isabella stood frozen before her. The faint light in her eyes dimmed rapidly.

Isabella, are you disgusted with me? With your severe cleanliness habit, I must look terrible to you now!

A bitter smile touched Olivia's lips as her consciousness slipped away, plunging her into an endless darkness.

"Sis! Sister!"

A sharp voice pierced the air, startling everyone.

Sophie Cook!

It was as if someone had pulled Olivia from the abyss. Her fading awareness clawed back. Her heavy eyelids fluttered open a bit more, desperate to see Sophie—her only family left in the world.

"Sister, what did they do to you?" Sophie screamed, rushing over, only to faint dramatically into Isabella's arms.

The light in Olivia's eyes extinguished completely.

Seeing Sophie collapse into Isabella's embrace felt like a giant hand pushing her into darkness, falling until she knew nothing.

The moment stretched on, from when Isabella stopped to when Sophie fell into his arms, a fleeting instant that felt like a century.

Sophie’s fall snapped Isabella back to reality. He kicked her aside and rushed to Olivia, gently covering her with his jacket, shielding her torn clothes from sight.

"Sis! Isabella, how is my sister? Let me see her!" Sophie cried from the ground, genuinely pained by her fall.

Isabella tightened his hold on Olivia, casting a glare at the crowd behind Sophie, his voice icy, "If anyone breathes a word of this, you and your families will disappear without a trace!"

"Isabella…" Sophie called pitifully, but Isabella ignored her, striding away with Olivia in his arms.

Once they reached the car, Isabella checked for Olivia's breathing, but there was none.

No breath?

Isabella's hand trembled violently.

Michael Wright, who had come to help, spoke softly, "Sir, Olivia might just be unconscious."

Isabella punched Michael fiercely, "You useless fools! How did you let this happen?"

Michael, nursing a black eye, bowed his head, "I'm sorry, sir. Olivia didn't want us following her."

"Get lost! Handle the situation here. You, drive to the best hospital now!"

Two days later...

"Didn't you say she's physically fine? Then why isn't she waking up? You're all incompetent!"

"Sir, we've thoroughly examined Olivia, and there's no physical issue. She's likely in a deep state of shock, subconsciously protecting and avoiding reality."

"She doesn't want to wake up?" Isabella's fierce gaze made the doctor flinch, collapsing to the floor with fright. The others huddled silently, not daring to breathe.

Isabella glared, "So, how do we make her want to wake up?"

"In such cases, the unconscious person might still have some awareness. You could try talking to her about things or people she cares about, to awaken her survival instinct."

"Fine. You stay here on call. The rest, take your severance and leave!"

"Thank you, sir!"

The doctor, relieved, wiped his brow, knowing failure meant facing Isabella's wrath again.

"Get out!" Isabella ordered, clearing the room of doctors and staff.

Once alone, Isabella fetched warm water, gently wiping Olivia's face with a clean cloth, meticulously caring for her.

From the hospital to home, he hadn’t left her side for two days, personally tending to her every need.

I won't lose you again, Olivia, never again.

In her peaceful state, Olivia looked like a sleeping beauty, serene and calm.

Talk about things she cared about…

Recalling the doctor's advice, Isabella suddenly tossed the cloth aside, shouting at Olivia, "If you don't wake up soon, I might just take matters into my own hands!"
