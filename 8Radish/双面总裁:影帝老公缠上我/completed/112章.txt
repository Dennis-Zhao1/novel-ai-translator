In the bustling city of Newford, Sophie Cook found herself in a tight spot, needing to gather a large sum of money quickly. Entering the shady world of underground lending, she stumbled upon a peculiar kind of loan that required no collateralâ€”just a compromising photo. With a bit of makeup magic, she transformed herself to resemble the glamorous Olivia Stewart, upping her resemblance from a mere five to a striking eight out of ten.

Days later, Sophie had pockets full of cash and a closet brimming with designer clothes, makeup, and accessories. Her plan was to outshine Olivia at the upcoming filming ceremony, unaware that Olivia had actually vouched for her to stay in the cast. Without Olivia's intervention, Isabella Peterson, the director with a no-nonsense reputation, would have likely booted her out.

Meanwhile, Olivia was a bundle of nerves. She was set to lead in "An Angel to Love You," a project boasting an all-star cast. Despite her humble roots, she was the leading lady, while even the esteemed actress, Lisa, settled for a supporting role.

That evening, Olivia paced outside Isabella Peterson's study, summoning the courage to knock.

"Come in!" Isabella called.

As Olivia entered, Isabella's stern features softened, beckoning her over with a smile. Olivia obliged, only to be swept into Isabella's arms for a flurry of kisses. Olivia playfully pushed Isabella's head away, "Hey, can't you be serious for once?"

"Serious? Loving my woman is serious business!" Isabella retorted with a grin.

Olivia sighed, "I have something to discuss with you."

Isabella paused, twirling a lock of Olivia's hair around her finger, "Go on."

"I'm really nervous about tomorrow. It's a big event, and as the lead, I'll be interviewed. What if I mess up?"

Isabella chuckled, "Interviews at these things are pretty tame. Your assistant prepped you, remember? Just stick to the script and smile at the reporters."

Olivia shot her a skeptical glance, "As if you're an expert on these things."

With a cheeky smile, she added, "But then again, you've probably seen it all."

Olivia shook Isabella's head playfully, "I'm still nervous!"

Isabella was amused, "Why are you shaking my head?"

"Shaking mine makes me dizzy!"

Isabella couldn't help but kiss Olivia's pouting lips, "Relax, I've got a secret for you."

Olivia perked up, "What is it?"

Isabella whispered, "I funded this production. So even if you mess up, no one can change your lead role without my say-so."

Olivia stared, wide-eyed. "That's... a surprise!"

"Not seeing the joy on your face," Isabella teased, lifting Olivia's chin.

Olivia looked away, mumbling, "I'm just speechless with surprise."

"Take a minute to process," Isabella said, clearly pleased with herself.

Olivia blinked, trying to hide her mixed feelings. The script, crafted just for her, echoed Isabella's past with a mysterious "White" character. Gratitude battled with an unsettling pang in her heart.

Isabella noticed, "You're still not happy? Tell me what's wrong, and I'll fix it."

Olivia hesitated, then brightened, "Mr. Big Shot, will you be my date tomorrow?"

"Date?" Isabella spluttered, caught off guard.

Olivia blinked innocently, "Did I say something wrong?"

Isabella rolled her eyes, "Traditionally, you're my date."

"Then, oh mighty Mr. Big Shot, can I be your date?"

"Nope!"

"Why not? You know I'm nervous. Can't you come and cheer me on?"

Isabella, watching Olivia's pleading eyes, promised, "I'll be there for you tonight."

"You jerk!" Olivia huffed, turning away.

Isabella chuckled, "Don't worry. I'll be with you, just in a different way."

"I have to go now!" Olivia declared, jumping up, but not before throwing a mischievous glance back, "If you don't show up, I'll cozy up to the leading man, Skylar."

"You'll regret it, mark my words!"

Olivia strutted out, leaving Isabella laughing in disbelief.

The next morning, Olivia woke up, feeling a pang of disappointment at Isabella's absence. She was greeted by Lucas Wright, their trusted butler, who handed her a stunning gown.

"This is from Mr. Big Shot. He'll be watching," Lucas reassured, with a grandfatherly smile.

With renewed determination, Olivia prepared for the day. On the way, she texted Isabella, "I'm off to charm some handsome guys!"

A reply came instantly, "I'm watching."

Olivia giggled at his promptness, feeling a warmth spread through her. She shot back, "What can you do about it from afar?"

"Tonight," came his simple reply.

"Come back now, if you dare!" she teased. "I'll be sure to give him a smooch!"

"Break that promise, and you're a puppy!" he retorted.

Olivia stared at her phone, amused by Isabella's playful side. She responded with a defiant emoji, "Watch me! We're playing a couple, after all."

Meanwhile, Isabella chuckled, almost dropping his phone. This girl was something else.

As Olivia approached the venue, her nerves had transformed into excitement, all thanks to her playful exchange with Isabella. She was ready to shine.
