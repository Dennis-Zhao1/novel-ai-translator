Olivia Stewart in Trouble

"Back up! Seriously, back up!" Olivia Stewart yelled at the top of her lungs.

Given the choice between falling off a cliff or backing into a lake, the latter seemed way better. I mean, being soaked is preferable to becoming a pancake at the bottom of a ravine!

Her bodyguard, David Wright, snapped into action at her shout, quickly spinning the steering wheel to reverse.

Screech!

Sparks flew as the bodyguard's car scraped past two massive trucks. They managed to narrowly escape the trap, only to plunge into the lake due to the huge force behind the maneuver.

But Olivia and David were prepared. As soon as the car hit the water, they flung open the doors and dove into the lake.

The two heavy trucks collided with a deafening crash, sparks shooting everywhere. It was a chaotic scene!

Minutes later, Olivia surfaced, her head drenched and her heart still racing. Who on earth decided to mess with her so early in the morning?

"Olivia, are you okay?" David swam over, completely ignoring any notion of propriety as he slipped an arm around her like she was a soggy kitten, quickly towing her to the shore.

"You can let go now, I can swim!" she said, though her swimming skills were admittedly not great.

"It's late fall, the water's freezing. In a minute, you'll barely be able to move," David replied, paddling swiftly with one arm.

Truthfully, he was worried about something far worse. This accident wasn’t just a coincidence, and if someone planned to take a shot at Olivia while she was in the water, the consequences would be dire.

Thankfully, they were only a short distance from the shore and made it there quickly.

The cold wind cut right through Olivia's soaking clothes, making her shiver uncontrollably. Worse, her wet clothes left little to the imagination.

David promptly took off his own soaked jacket and draped it over Olivia. It wasn’t warm, but at least it was something.

As Olivia adjusted the jacket around her, she heard a sharp noise behind her.

David let out a pained grunt, his face contorting in agony. Smoke rose from his back, accompanied by the stench of burning flesh.

Olivia winced, nearly retching at the sight and smell.

David was sweating bullets, but he managed to push himself in front of Olivia. "Get out of here, Olivia!"

"You think it's that easy? Your bodyguard's loyal, but doesn't he realize his paycheck comes from me?" sneered a voice, cold and arrogant.

Olivia turned to see a middle-aged woman with a malicious grin standing a few steps away, alongside the gloating figure of Mia White.

So this was Mia's doing!

Olivia quickly examined David's back, which was a gruesome mess. He'd been drenched in acid, and his skin was horribly burned.

Olivia's eyes welled up with anger and pain. "Why don't you come after me instead?" she shouted at Mia.

"I'm here for you in the first place!" Mia retorted, her chin jutting out like a proud peacock. "If it weren't for that worthless bodyguard, your face would match his back right now!"

Olivia shivered at the thought. This woman was beyond cruel.

Seeing David's large frame trembling, Olivia urgently called out to the nearby bodyguards, "What are you waiting for? Get him some help!"

But they just stood there, heads bowed.

Mia laughed maniacally. "You really think you can order them around? They're loyal to the Peterson Group. Even if I kill you right here, they wouldn't lift a finger to help. Believe it or not!"

Olivia noticed the bodyguards' uniforms matched those of the Peterson Group, though the faces were unfamiliar. It was clear they'd been brought over from the Peterson estate, and wouldn't defy orders from that despicable woman.

Olivia pleaded with the bodyguards, desperation in her voice. "I don't expect you to protect me, but please, for the sake of your brother David, get him treated!"

She felt David growing heavier against her, clearly struggling to stay conscious.

The bodyguards averted their eyes further.

Mia’s laugh was filled with contempt. "David! Just step aside, and I'll get you treated immediately. Otherwise, your muscles will start dying, and you'll be useless for life!"

David remained still, and Olivia nudged him. "Go! Get help!"

"No," David shook his head, his large frame trembling. "The master saved my life. You're important to him; I can't let anything happen to you."

"The guards inside the castle are loyal to the master. Hold on a little longer, and they'll realize something's wrong and come to help."

"You've already saved me once. That's enough," Olivia said, tears in her eyes, as she pushed David toward the nearest bodyguard.

The bodyguards, finally moved by the scene, rushed to help David.

"No... I must protect Olivia!" David protested, but another guard quickly knocked him out with a sharp blow.

Seeing David safely taken away, Olivia felt a small sense of relief.

She turned back to Mia, her eyes blazing with fury. "Mia, I can see why Isabella Peterson wants nothing to do with you!"

"You...!" Mia shrieked, enraged.

"Who told you to steal my man?"

If Olivia felt any guilt towards Mia before, it vanished the moment David took that acid for her. She was ready to fight this venomous woman to the end.

Olivia straightened, regal as a princess, her voice dripping with arrogance. "I did take your man, and what of it?"

"You shameless hussy! I'll tear you apart!" Mia lunged forward, only to be held back by her mother.

"Mia, you don't need to dirty your hands with this," her mother, Grace Martin, chided. "Have you forgotten what I taught you? Be ruthless with homewreckers."

Olivia sized up Grace Martin, understanding where Mia got her malevolence.

Grace Martin's husband had a history of infidelity, instilling in her a deep hatred for mistresses. She had a notorious reputation for her harsh tactics.

Olivia felt a pang of fear but hid it behind a calm facade, even managing a slight smile.

"Mia, you're really something. Can't beat me, so you call for backup? Why not face me one-on-one?" Olivia taunted.

Mia, easily provoked, bristled with anger. "You think I won't?"

"Come on, try me. I'll scratch your face off," Olivia taunted, beckoning with a finger.

"Olivia!" Mia screamed, charging at her.

Grace yanked Mia back, shooting her a scathing look. "Use your brain! She's baiting you. She'll just use you as a shield."

Mia finally caught on, spitting at Olivia's feet in frustration. "You vile woman!"

Olivia’s gaze was sharp and mocking. "If anyone's vile, it's you two."

Grace eyed Olivia disdainfully. "You're Olivia Stewart, right? You've got some skill, bullying Mia like this. But after today..."

Grace signaled her bodyguards, who stepped forward, menacingly advancing on Olivia.

Olivia instinctively backed up, glancing around for help. The castle guards remained motionless.

The bodyguards closed in, and Olivia turned to flee, only to be blocked. One grabbed her collar, throwing her to the ground.

She hissed as her hand scraped the rough surface, pain flaring up.

Before she could rise, the guards surrounded her. They weren’t hitting her or tying her up, but their hands reached for her clothes.

Olivia's heart pounded in terror. Mia and Grace were more malicious than she ever imagined.

She struggled desperately, but against four men, her efforts were pitiful.

In seconds, David’s jacket lay in tatters, and the guards reached for her dress.

This wasn’t a threat; they meant to assault her.

Olivia opened her mouth and bit down on an arm, but a powerful hand clamped around her jaw.

With all her might, Olivia screamed, "Mia, aren't you afraid Isabella Peterson will hate you for this?"
