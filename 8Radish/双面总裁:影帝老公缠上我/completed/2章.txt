Chapter 2: Caught in the Chaos
Olivia Stewart’s day had officially spiraled out of control. She stood frozen in the middle of the Peterson family’s luxurious private lounge, her nerves fraying by the second. The walls were adorned with priceless artwork, the scent of freshly brewed tea wafted through the air, and the grand piano in the corner gleamed under the chandelier’s soft glow. Yet Olivia could focus on none of it—not with Mrs. Chu hovering over her like a hawk, brimming with unwarranted enthusiasm.

“My dear, you must be so tired standing there!” Mrs. Chu cooed, reaching out as if to guide Olivia to a chair. “A pregnant woman needs rest. And don’t worry, from now on, you’ll stay at the Peterson estate. I’ll make sure you and my grandchild are taken care of.”

Olivia’s forced smile felt like it was going to crack. “Oh, no need for all that, Mrs. Chu. I’m perfectly fine, really.”

“Fine? Of course not!” Mrs. Chu insisted, her eyes sparkling with maternal determination. “You need to be under my care. I’ll have a room prepared for you immediately. We’ll hire the best nutritionists, doctors, and—”

“Mrs. Chu,” Olivia interrupted, her voice teetering on the edge of panic. “This is… really just a misunderstanding!”

“Misunderstanding?” Mrs. Chu’s warm expression faltered for a moment, replaced by a flicker of suspicion.

“Yes, I—uh—” Olivia stumbled over her words, desperate to come up with an excuse. Her eyes darted toward Isabella Peterson, who stood a few feet away, leaning casually against the grand piano. His arms were crossed, and his lips curved into a faint, infuriating smirk. He clearly found the entire situation entertaining.

Seriously? You’re just going to stand there and enjoy this? Olivia’s glare practically screamed the thought, but Isabella simply shrugged, his dark eyes sparkling with mischief.

“Excuse me,” Olivia blurted suddenly, clutching her fake baby bump. “I need to use the restroom!”

Mrs. Chu’s eyes widened with concern. “Oh, of course! Let me help you—those tiles can be so slippery.” She took a step forward as if to escort her personally.

Olivia nearly choked. The restroom? Really?

“No! I mean… no need,” Olivia said hastily, holding up her hands. “I can manage on my own. It’s just a quick trip.”

Mrs. Chu hesitated, clearly torn between her protective instincts and Olivia’s insistence. Before she could protest further, Olivia turned to Isabella, pinning him with a pleading look. “Would you mind coming with me? Just to… explain things to Mrs. Chu while I’m gone.”

Isabella raised an eyebrow, his smirk deepening. “Explain things? Oh, I’d love to hear your explanation.”

“Isabella!” Olivia snapped, her voice rising.

His smirk only widened. “You know, I’m a guy. It’s not exactly appropriate for me to follow you into the ladies’ room.”

Olivia’s patience shattered. “Fine!” she exclaimed, spinning back to Mrs. Chu. “I have a confession to make.”

The room seemed to freeze. Mrs. Chu tilted her head, her curious expression slowly hardening into one of suspicion. Isabella’s smirk vanished, replaced by an intrigued frown.

“I’m not pregnant,” Olivia admitted, her voice low but firm. “This whole thing… it’s an act. I’m an actress, hired to crash the party.”

The room fell deathly silent. For a brief moment, Olivia allowed herself to hope that honesty might save her.

But Mrs. Chu’s face turned red with fury. “What?” she shrieked, rising to her feet so abruptly that her chair nearly toppled over. “You mean… my grandchild doesn’t exist?”

Olivia raised her hands in surrender. “I’m so sorry! I never meant to deceive you, Mrs. Chu. This was all Isabella’s idea. He didn’t want to get engaged, so he paid me to… you know, ruin things.” She glanced at Isabella, who was now glaring at her with a dangerous glint in his eyes.

Mrs. Chu gasped, her hand flying to her chest. “You!” she cried, pointing a trembling finger at Olivia. “How dare you play with my family like this? Guards! Seize this woman!”

At her command, two security guards stepped forward, their expressions grim. Olivia’s pulse skyrocketed. She braced herself for the inevitable, but before the guards could reach her, Isabella’s voice rang out.

“Stop.”

The guards froze mid-step. Isabella straightened, his casual demeanor replaced by a quiet authority. He walked toward Olivia, his polished shoes clicking softly against the marble floor.

“Well, Olivia,” he said, his voice deceptively calm. “You’ve certainly made a mess of things.”

She glared at him, her frustration boiling over. “I made a mess? This is your fault!”

“Perhaps,” Isabella admitted, tilting his head thoughtfully. “But I have to say, you’ve surprised me. You’re braver than you look.”

Olivia blinked, caught off guard. Was that… a compliment?

Isabella leaned in slightly, his voice dropping to a low murmur. “Don’t worry. I’ll clean up this little disaster of yours. But you owe me, Olivia.”

“Who said I needed your help?” she snapped, pushing him away.

Isabella chuckled, clearly unbothered by her defiance. “Trust me, you do.”

Before she could respond, Mrs. Chu’s voice cut through the tension. “Wait,” she said suddenly, her eyes narrowing at Isabella. “If this was all a scheme, then does that mean you’re still refusing to marry Mia?”

“Mother,” Isabella said smoothly, his tone oozing charm. “We can discuss that later.”

Mrs. Chu huffed but didn’t press further. Instead, she turned back to Olivia, her expression icy. “You may not be pregnant, but I suggest you leave before I change my mind about letting the guards handle you.”

Olivia didn’t need to be told twice. She darted out of the room, her fake baby bump awkwardly shifting as she ran. She didn’t stop until she found the restroom, where she ripped off the pillow stuffed under her dress and tossed it into the trash.

As she emerged, her heart still pounding, the sound of approaching footsteps made her freeze. She spun around—only to crash directly into someone’s chest.

“Hey!” she exclaimed, clutching her nose in pain.

The man steadied her, his hands firm yet gentle. She looked up, ready to snap at him, but her words died in her throat.

It was Isabella.

“Olivia,” he said, his voice filled with quiet amusement. “You’re not very good at staying out of trouble, are you?”
