Henry Adams leaned against the outside wall of the restroom, taking a slow drag from his cigarette, waiting. Sure enough, not even a minute passed before Sophie Cook came striding over, her heels clicking sharply against the floor, her face a mix of irritation and determination.

"You seem pretty relaxed!" Sophie snapped, glancing sideways at Henry.

Henry blew a smoke ring leisurely, grinning. "What else am I supposed to do? Your sister, Olivia, isn't as gullible as you are!"

Sophie fumed, her face flushing with frustration, "You..."

"Olivia's as tough as a rubber band that won't snap. I've run out of tricks. So, what now?"

Sophie snatched the cigarette from Henry's hand, taking a fierce drag. Her eyes glinted with a cold resolve. "Since the subtle approach didn't work, we'll have to be more direct. How about we..."

Sophie leaned in, whispering her plan into Henry's ear. He nodded along, a wicked grin spreading across his face. "Back to what I do best—straightforward and satisfying!"

Sophie cast him a stern look. "We didn't expect Olivia to be so skeptical about our little act with the fake production company. The lie about her being replaced will be exposed soon, and your facade as a director won't hold up. We need to act tonight."

With a decisive flick, Sophie stubbed out the cigarette. "Tonight it is!"

"Alright! You go back and keep her company. I'll follow soon, so she doesn't get suspicious."

With their plan set, they split up quickly.

Back at the café, Sophie rejoined Olivia at their table, keeping up the facade of sisterly concern. A few minutes later, Henry returned as well, masking his disappointment over Olivia's refusal to sign the dubious contract. He soon excused himself, leaving the two sisters alone.

"Let's head out too," Olivia suggested, standing up.

Sophie studied her sister's face, cautiously probing, "Sis, don't you feel like it's a missed opportunity, turning this down?"

"Missed what exactly?" Olivia said fondly, giving Sophie a gentle smile. "That Director Adams didn't seem trustworthy. Plus, I'd never even heard of this 'New Horizon Films.' Even if I'm not familiar with the industry, I should've at least heard of them, right? How did you know about it?"

Sophie avoided eye contact, mumbling, "I just met Director Adams once before and he told me about it."

Olivia playfully flicked her sister on the forehead, "You believe everything you're told? You're not a kid anymore. You've got to be more cautious! There's a lot of tricksters out there."

Sophie nodded, her mood subdued, "Yeah."

Olivia wrapped an arm around her, comforting her, "It's alright, we didn't fall for it!"

Biting her lip, Sophie felt a mix of frustration and guilt.

As they left the café, Olivia checked her watch, a bit disappointed. "It's late now. We missed our shopping trip. Let's reschedule. Sophie, this place isn't far from your college, you head back. I'll call for a ride."

Sophie blocked Olivia's phone with a playful pout, "No, I want to spend more time with you!"

Olivia sighed, affectionately ruffling Sophie's hair, "You little rascal!"

Dragging Olivia along, Sophie led her towards the college campus.

"Sis, I've figured it out. That New Horizon Films must be a small-time operation. Adams was just fishing for talent. His stories about you being let go were lies. It's my fault; I almost led you astray."

"Don't worry about it," Olivia assured her. "We didn't fall for it, right?"

"But I still feel bad. You've been in that intense training for almost a month now, and I haven't really spent time with you. Now you're giving private lessons, and it's even harder to see you."

Sophie pouted, looking like a dejected child.

Olivia's heart ached at her sister's expression. "Yeah, I don't like being alone. Teaching solo, it's hard to get the right feel without a partner. Even though the instructors help out, they're so good at it. With a newbie, I'd be lost."

Sophie perked up, "How about we go to the practice room and do some scenes together? We've never acted opposite each other!"

Seeing this new, clingy side of Sophie, Olivia was moved and agreed. She called the family chauffeur, explaining she'd be home later and not to worry.

Sophie felt a wave of relief, a cunning glint in her eyes.

They headed to the college's training building, a place filled with small, private rooms equipped with props for practice.

Sophie picked a secluded corner room, leading Olivia inside.

"Sis, let's turn off our phones, okay? A ringing phone would ruin the mood."

Seeing no harm, Olivia complied with a smile.

As her phone screen went dark, Sophie allowed herself a cold, calculating smile. Olivia, your time's running out.

They started with easy roles, gradually increasing the difficulty. Sophie, with her sharp instincts, knew how to engage Olivia, choosing roles that challenged her. Olivia, determined not to be outdone, insisted on rehearsing repeatedly.

Hours slipped by unnoticed.

Suddenly aware of the time, Olivia exclaimed, "It's so late!"

She reached for her phone, but Sophie stopped her with a mischievous grin, "No calls, tonight you're all mine!"

Olivia chuckled, "Oh, you silly thing, what are you on about?"

"I'm hungry, let's go eat something," Sophie insisted, her stomach growling audibly, her cheeks turning rosy with embarrassment.

Olivia chuckled, "You didn't remind me earlier? Let's go!"

They exited the practice building, strolling down the quiet campus path, their shadows long and intertwined under the warm glow of the street lamps—a picture of sisterly bliss.

How long had it been since they shared such a moment?

Maybe never.

Olivia felt a bittersweet pang, but quickly replaced it with a smile.

As they walked, the path grew quieter, the lights dimmer.

"Where are we going?" Olivia asked, a hint of doubt creeping in.

"To eat! There's a great little place outside the back gate."

"But you're hungry; can't we just eat at the campus dining hall?"

"Nope, I want to go there! They make the best sweet and sour chicken. Once you try it, you'll be hooked!"

Olivia looked into Sophie's earnest eyes and couldn't refuse, despite the uneasy feeling in the pit of her stomach.

"Okay, okay, you win, you little foodie!"

Sophie led the way through the back gate, but instead of a bustling street, they found themselves in a narrow, dimly lit alley.

Olivia hesitated, "Sophie, this doesn't feel safe. Let's go back."

"It's just a short cut, a few minutes tops. If we take the main road, it'll take at least half an hour, and I'm starving!"

Before Olivia could protest, Sophie had already skipped ahead.

Reluctantly, Olivia followed.

The alley grew darker, the streetlights casting only faint glimmers. At a bend, it was hard to even see their feet.

Supporting each other, they stumbled through the uneven alley, occasionally tripping.

"Sophie, how much longer is this?" Olivia asked, her voice edged with unease.

"I forgot they were renovating here. Let's turn back."

But as they turned, they saw shadowy figures at the alley's entrance, slowly advancing, their eyes gleaming with predatory intent.

Panic surged through Olivia. "Run, Sophie! This way!"

They sprinted a few steps when Sophie suddenly fell, crying out in pain, "Ah!"

Olivia stopped, rushing back to her side, "Sophie, are you okay?"

"My ankle, I twisted it. It hurts, don't touch it!"

Olivia glanced back at the approaching figures, fear gripping her. She knelt, "Get on my back, hurry!"

"No, you go! Leave me!" Sophie urged, pushing Olivia away.

"You're my sister! I'm not leaving you. Now, come on!"

Ignoring Sophie's protests, Olivia hoisted her onto her back, staggering forward.

Sophie struggled, "No, don't!"

"Sophie, hold still!" Olivia commanded, struggling to maintain her balance as she carried her sister through the dark alley.

With each step, Olivia's pace slowed, the weight of Sophie and the uneven ground dragging her down. Suddenly, her foot slipped on a loose stone, and they both tumbled to the ground.
