Title: The Lavish Surprise

"Wow, this bracelet has four clover leaves - one for each of us... wait, we're missing one!" Olivia Stewart exclaimed, her brows furrowing in confusion.

Isabella Peterson gave a subtle smile, speaking softly, "It's not missing. It's just perfect."

"Only four? How can it be perfect? Have you forgotten about Tommy again?" Olivia's mood soured as she tossed the bracelet onto the counter, feeling deflated.

Isabella Peterson's voice rang out with confidence, "I don't need a lucky clover. I'm the guardian for you and the kids!"

Olivia was taken aback. The next moment, she threw herself into Isabella's arms without hesitation. She used to disdain women who acted all delicate in front of men until she realized how blissful it was to have someone to lean on.

Playfully, she punched Isabella's chest with her tiny fists. This guy always knew the right things to say, tugging at her heartstrings and making it race.

"Alright, so can you wear it now?" Isabella lifted the bracelet. "These four leaves are you and the three kids..."

Her voice caught slightly at the mention of the three kids. Olivia noticed but didn't think much of it, assuming he was just awkward about having so many kids at a young age. Truth be told, having a kid as old as Tommy was something she was still getting used to. What would it feel like to be called "Mom"?

Isabella's slender finger played with the dangling clovers on the bracelet as he continued, "I'm the chain that holds you all together. As long as you're bound to me, you'll never fall apartâ€”always a lucky clover."

Olivia gleefully snatched the bracelet, her eyes twinkling like crescent moons. "Isabella, you really know how to talk!"

Isabella smugly accepted her compliment, though he'd never admit to Olivia that he'd done his homework before joining her shopping trip.

As Olivia toyed with the delicate clover charms, she felt something slightly uneven inside the smooth crystal. Curious, she flipped a leaf over, spotting a small ornate "K" engraved near the base.

"What's this 'K' mean?" she asked, intrigued.

Isabella's smile was almost imperceptible as he kept his silence.

Olivia checked the second leaf, finding a "G" in the same spot.

"K, G..." she mused, her eyebrows knitting together thoughtfully. Suddenly, her eyes sparkled with realization, her face lighting up enchantingly. "I get it! It's for Coco and Gigi!"

She cheered, but noticed Isabella's lack of response. Waving a hand in front of his face, she teased, "Hey!"

"Hmm?" Isabella snapped back, a touch of embarrassment flashing across his handsome features.

Was he really just staring, mesmerized by that radiant face of hers?

Olivia, thrilled like she'd discovered a new world, exclaimed, "Did you plan this, pretending it was just a store item for me to pick?"

"Did you? Did you?" she pressed, eyes shining with admiration.

Isabella leaned closer with a mischievous grin, whispering in her ear, "How are you gonna thank me?"

A blush spread across Olivia's cheeks. She bit her lip, stood on tiptoe, and looped her arms around Isabella's neck, pulling him down for a quick peck on the lips.

But Isabella wasn't about to let her get away so easily. As Olivia tried to retreat, he clasped the back of her head, encircling her waist with his arm to hold her close, savoring her sweet taste.

"Mmm, mmm..." Olivia's eyes widened as she struggled.

Isabella, you rascal! This is a public mall!

Seeing her silent protests, Isabella gently covered her eyes with his hand, commanding softly yet firmly, "Close them."

As Olivia tried to resist, Isabella stole her breath away with another kiss, leaving her melting in his arms.

The store's staff and security guards discreetly turned away.

After a good thirty minutes of a passionate embrace, Olivia's lips were red and swollen.

"Isabella..." she whimpered softly, embarrassed by the sound of her own voice.

Covering her mouth, Olivia vowed not to make another sound.

Isabella scooped her up, striding out with her in his arms.

"Hey!" Olivia protested, tapping his shoulder. "I haven't finished shopping!"

It seemed she still had shopping on her mind!

Clearly, Isabella thought to himself, he hadn't tried hard enough yet.

He gently pecked Olivia's flushed ear, grumbling, "I'll have them pack everything up for you to choose from."

"No, don't do that! It's too much trouble. Since we're here, let's enjoy the shopping experience!" Olivia insisted.

"Alright, alright," Isabella relented, sounding like a child denied candy.

He nuzzled into the crook of her neck, breathing in her sweet scent before reluctantly setting her down.

But in the next moment, he pulled her back, tightly holding her close.

Olivia chuckled, slipping her small hand into Isabella's large one for comfort.

They returned to the counter, and Olivia picked up the discarded clover bracelet, grumbling, "All your fault for distracting me from looking at the bracelet!"

Isabella wrapped his arms around her, resting his chin on her shoulder, chuckling with a hint of pride.

Olivia glared at him playfully. Suddenly, an idea struck her.

"Tell me, Mr. CEO, how did you know I'd pick this one? What if I chose a different one? Wouldn't your surprise be ruined?"

"You were bound to choose it!" Isabella declared confidently.

"Hmph! I don't like this bracelet anymore. It's too tacky!" Olivia tossed it back onto the counter, sneaking a last glance at it.

Isabella noticed but kept quiet, his lips curling into a charming smile.

Olivia browsed the jewelry section, deliberately picking the gaudiest, most ostentatious gold chain. Turning it over, she spotted a discreetly engraved "M."

M for Olivia!

Shocked, she exclaimed, "Isabella, don't tell me everything here is made just for me!"

"Yes," he replied calmly.

Olivia was speechless. "You... you..."

This was true extravagance!

She glanced around the mall, suddenly feeling the pinch of extravagance.

So much money wasted on this!

Fuming, she shouted, "Isabella, you spendthrift!"

Isabella's smile froze.

What did she mean by that?

He'd given her a mall, and she called him a spendthrift?

How was that wasteful?

There was no harm in pampering the woman he loved!

Isabella's expression darkened as the staff and security tried to shrink from view.

Olivia saw his pouty, frustrated look and stomped her foot. "Look at this! How could I possibly want something so tacky?"

"What if you picked it?" Isabella replied, matter-of-factly. "I had to ensure anything you picked would be special!"

What a grand gesture!

Olivia didn't know what to say. "But making all these things just for me is wasteful!"

"Waste doesn't matter," Isabella retorted confidently. "My woman deserves the best!"

Olivia was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, the heavy gold chain didn't seem so tacky. Its weight felt reassuring in her hand.

Turning her head slightly, she blinked away tears.

Isabella gently pulled her into him, pressing her head against his chest.

"You're allowed to feel moved for a minute. But if you're gonna cry, it has to be in my arms!"

His authoritative voice echoed above her, and Olivia buried her face in his chest, her tears soaking his shirt.

"You're so bad!" she murmured, rubbing her cheek against him like a cat. When she looked up, her face was full of bashful, affectionate smiles.

"Alright, alright, let's pick something!" Isabella stroked her hair, his voice tender and warm.
