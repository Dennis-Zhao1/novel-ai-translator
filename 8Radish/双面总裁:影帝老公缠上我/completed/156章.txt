Isabella glanced out the window, "Yeah, okay."

Olivia let out a sigh of relief. "We'll go tomorrow then!"

Wait, what?

Olivia's heart, which had just settled back into place, shot up into her throat again.

"Isabella, actually, the thing is..." Olivia began, playfully shaking Isabella's arm, her voice soft and pleading, "I didn't really see a bee. I was just too eager while eating lobster and accidentally poked my lip with the claw. I was afraid you'd call me clumsy, so I..."

Still spinning tales, huh? Keep going, let's see how far you get!

Isabella listened silently, his deep eyes focused on his own arm, where Olivia was absentmindedly leaning against him. A familiar sweet scent wafted from her, subtly teasing his senses.

The warmth from Olivia's touch spread from his elbow like electric currents, racing through his body, filling every bone with a sweet, pleasant excitement.

Isabella's gaze deepened, a tender emotion hidden in his dark eyes. Although he was thoroughly enjoying himself, his face remained aloof and proud.

He looked down at Olivia, quickly masking any emotion with a look of disdain. "You think a story about getting stung by a bee while eating an apple is clever? Olivia, what kind of intelligence do you have? You've been with me for so long, haven't you improved at all?"

Isabella's finger lightly tapped Olivia's forehead, not hard but enough to make her tilt back slightly, covering her forehead in embarrassment. "It's genetic, nothing I can do about it."

"So, our future kids better not take after you, or they'll be hopeless!"

Olivia's heart skipped a beat. Why were they talking about kids all of a sudden?

But as long as she could get past this hurdle, it was all good. Olivia quickly put on a flattering smile, "They should take after you, then!"

Isabella couldn't help but be pleased, the corners of his lips curling up slightly. A simple comment, yet it hit the mark perfectly!

"So, Isabella, are you hungry? How about I check the kitchen and whip up a little something for you?" Olivia asked sweetly, trying to change the subject and end this interrogation. But just as she was about to leave, Isabella's voice came from behind, "And what's the third excuse?"

Olivia's legs almost gave way. The calmer Isabella's tone, the less patience he had left. This was the calm before the storm!

Knowing she couldn't escape, Olivia obediently stood back against the wall.

Isabella pulled over a chair, straddling it with his long legs, leaning his arms on the backrest as he coolly regarded Olivia. He'd been entangled in this little act for so long, he wondered if this girl had any feelings for the suave persona he had carefully crafted.

Olivia felt a chill run down her spine under Isabella's gaze and couldn't help but hunch her shoulders. She hated it when Isabella looked at her like that, his sharp eyes feeling like arrows, threatening to unravel her carefully constructed facade and leave her exposed.

Sigh, if only she had just told the truth from the start and saved herself the trouble.

"I'll tell the truth, but you can't blame me!" Olivia blurted out, closing her eyes tightly as if bracing herself for the worst.

"Go on," Isabella's voice was calm, his expression unreadable.

Olivia cleared her throat, "Actually, it wasn't a bee sting or a lobster claw. It was... it was during the shoot, and Tianyi bit me!"

As soon as she confessed, she quickly added, "You insisted I take the role, and you promised you wouldn't get jealous or angry. A promise is a promise!"

Olivia shut her eyes tight, waiting for the storm to hit. But after a while, there was nothing.

Huh, nothing happened?

That didn't seem right.

She cautiously peeked out of one eye, catching Isabella's sharp, cold gaze.

Yikes!

Olivia's face turned bright red, both embarrassed and flustered.

Since she'd been caught, there was no point hiding anymore. She opened her eyes and boldly looked at Isabella.

He still had that cool, indifferent look. Was he mad or not?

A moment of eye contact felt like a bolt of electricity shooting through Olivia, leaving her trembling slightly.

Geez!

His gaze was so cold, yet it made her heart race like crazy.

Olivia took a deep breath, glancing at Isabella's handsome face. She couldn't help but notice how much better-looking he had become. Despite being surrounded by good-looking guys on set, none compared to himâ€”not even Tianyi.

While Tianyi had great features, he lacked a certain masculine charm.

Simply put, Isabella had way more charisma!

She admired his thick eyebrows, the shape of his brows like drawn swords, adding a touch of allure to his cold demeanor. His eyes were large, with perfect natural double eyelids and dark pupils that seemed to pull you in, making it impossible to look away.

His nose was perfectly angled, better than any "Eiffel nose" in beauty ads. His lips were well-formed, thin yet defined, with a hint of aloofness that was incredibly sexy when pressed into a straight line like now.

Olivia stared at Isabella's lips, feeling her throat go dry. She didn't even realize how mesmerized her gaze had become, just like those fans who went crazy for Tianyi's autograph or got upset over their intimate scenes.

Suddenly, those lips moved, curling into a smile that was both charming and intoxicating.

Olivia remembered a cheesy line: "Your dimples don't have wine, but I get drunk like a fool!"

She never imagined she'd be so captivated just by looking at Isabella's lips!

"Had enough of staring?" His deep voice broke through, as seductive and magnetic as ever, like a cello playing a long, trembling note on her heartstrings.

Still out of it, Olivia absentmindedly replied, "Huh?"

Isabella's smile grew wider, "Want me to come closer so you can get a better look?"

"Sure... oh, no, no!" Olivia blurted out before catching herself, shaking her head quickly, her face flushing with embarrassment.

She awkwardly patted her cheeks, then stood straight against the wall, trying not to look at Isabella but focusing instead on her shoes, determined not to glance anywhere else.

Isabella, in good spirits, got up and walked over, gently lifting Olivia's chin with his finger.

What should have been a cheeky gesture seemed anything but mischievous when he did it, instead carrying a wicked charm.

He looked down at her, his proud face full of arrogant confidence, asking with satisfaction, "Am I that good-looking, huh?"

"Y-Yeah, pretty good-looking," Olivia mumbled, avoiding his gaze.

"Then have you ever thought about me, huh?"

What the heck!!

Why would you fantasize about your own guy?

If anything, you'd think about him openly!

Olivia thought to herself, though her face betrayed her with a blush. She mumbled, "N-No..."

Isabella wasn't satisfied, applying a bit more pressure with his fingers, "Your eyes were practically eating me up, and you say you haven't thought about it, huh?"

Olivia broke into a cold sweat.

Geez, he's saying it like I'm some dog drooling over a bone. Is it that bad?

"Uh, maybe... just a tiny bit," she admitted, her voice as small as a whisper, quickly lowering her head as if she could hide her blushing face.

Oh man, admitting to fantasizing about a guy is so embarrassing!

Even though, at the time, she did have a little bit of a crush.
