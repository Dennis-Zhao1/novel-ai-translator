The Uninvited Fiancée

Olivia Stewart could feel the redness creeping up her wrist as she struggled to break free, but Isabella Peterson reluctantly let go to avoid hurting her. Olivia made a dash for the door and almost collided with Lucas Wright, who was huffing and puffing as he made it to the top of the stairs.

"What's got you so flustered?" Isabella chided coldly, as Lucas tried to catch his breath.

"Ma'am, Ma'am... Miss Bai Miaomiao is here!" Lucas managed to stammer out.

Olivia was momentarily confused. "Who is Bai Miaomiao?"

Lucas nervously wiped the sweat off his forehead and mumbled, "Uh, Miss Bai Miaomiao..."

As Olivia racked her brain trying to remember when she had ever met someone named Bai Miaomiao, a sweet, almost sickly voice echoed from downstairs, "Darling—"

The voice was enough to make anyone's skin crawl. Olivia peered down and saw a young woman elegantly strutting up the spiral staircase. She was decked out in a trendy fur coat and tight leather pants that accentuated her curvy figure. Her wavy, wine-red hair and striking makeup highlighted her sharp features. A pretty woman, Olivia thought, though lacking a certain air of sophistication.

Isabella's face was already a stormy black, her voice icy, "Who gave you permission to come here? Get out!"

Bai Miaomiao's face blanched but quickly recovered with a brilliant smile. "Isabella, you've been working so hard, as your fiancée, shouldn’t I come and show some concern?"

"Fiancée?" Olivia suddenly remembered, during the confusion at the wedding hall, Isabella was supposed to be engaged to this Bai Miaomiao. But hadn’t they called it off?

Olivia turned to Isabella, "You didn't break off your engagement with her?"

"What nonsense are you spouting?" Bai Miaomiao exclaimed indignantly. "We're about to get married, how could the engagement be off? Isabella, you told me to learn proper etiquette before the wedding. Look, aren’t you satisfied now?"

So that’s how it was! Olivia realized she had unintentionally become the third wheel in someone else's relationship. Clutching the hem of her shirt, she bit her lip and turned to leave.

"Olivia!" Isabella grabbed her. "Let me explain!"

Olivia shook off Isabella’s hand, her voice frigid, "There's nothing to explain. I despise being the other woman!"

Isabella was left speechless. The whole noble etiquette thing was just a ruse to keep her family from pressuring Olivia. Who knew it would backfire so spectacularly?

Watching Olivia's determined back retreating down the stairs, Isabella wanted to call her back, but he felt powerless.

To humble himself and beg a woman to stay was something he couldn't bring himself to do. Especially when he hadn’t sorted out his own mess.

His gaze turned to Bai Miaomiao, sharp as a knife, filled with a towering rage that made the veins on his temples stand out.

This was all her fault!

Bai Miaomiao staggered back in fear, "Isabella, your parents ordered me to come and build our relationship. You can’t blame me!"

"Get out!" Isabella roared furiously. "There’s no room for another woman here! Whoever let Bai Miaomiao in, deal with it yourself!"

The servants quickly dragged Bai Miaomiao away, her protests growing fainter. Isabella angrily rubbed his temples, retreating into the study.

After leaving Isabella's place, Olivia headed straight back to the cozy apartment Ethan King had left for her. No matter how hurt she was, she was grateful to have a place to cry in peace, like a snail with a shell to hide its soft spots.

Ethan had been taken back to Australia by his family after his accident recovery. To help him move on, Olivia hadn’t dared contact him.

Thinking about the carefree days they spent together, she smiled wistfully. If only she hadn’t met Isabella, if only she hadn’t fallen for his domineering yet gentle charm, if only...

But there are no ifs in life.

Olivia wiped her face, startled to find it wet with cold tears. Remembering her anger when Emily Young stole her boyfriend, she was mortified to realize she had become the very thing she hated—a homewrecker!

She resolved never to be the other woman, no matter how deep her feelings. That was her line in the sand.

If Isabella couldn’t accept her past, then it was better to part ways.

She forced a smile, though it was more of a grimace, and steeled herself. "Olivia Stewart, you have to be strong!"

Her phone chimed with a message. It was from Isabella. She tossed it aside, but curiosity got the better of her and she picked it back up, hesitating between opening or deleting it.

In a moment of carelessness, her finger brushed the open button. Isabella’s message popped up: "Olivia Stewart, stop overthinking! No running away! I’ll handle this! Wait for me!"

Short and sharp, with a string of exclamation marks, typical of his audacious style.

Olivia bit her lip, annoyed but oddly comforted. How could he demand she stop thinking and running when his fiancée was already at the door?

She reread the message, imagining Isabella's fierce look as he typed it, and couldn't help but smile despite herself.

Realizing her own foolishness, she quickly tossed the phone aside.

What am I even thinking? His fiancée's here, get a grip!

The phone rang again. Olivia stubbornly ignored it, but it kept ringing and ringing.

Finally, she grabbed it, barely glancing before answering with a sharp, "Your mess, your problem. Leave me out of it! Call me again, and I'll block you!"

"Uh..."

On the other end, Director Wang was taken aback by the outburst. Why were both these young stars so fiery today?

After a moment, he found his words, "Olivia..."

"Director Wang!" Olivia exclaimed, smacking her forehead. "Sorry, I thought you were someone else. What's up?"

"Well, Tianyi is back, so we’ll resume filming tomorrow. Be sure to be on set."

Olivia agreed quickly, "Of course, I'll be there early!"

The next day, Olivia returned to the set of "Send an Angel to Love You." In the story, Gu Qianyi successfully undergoes surgery, leaving his wheelchair behind for a loving romance with Bai Yike.

The sweet scenes should have been easy, especially with the nation's heartthrob as her co-star. But acting out her own story while thinking about her situation with Isabella left her distracted and adrift.

After multiple takes, Tianyi, frustrated with her distracted performance, skipped to a kissing scene.

Olivia initially resisted, but Tianyi's skillful approach, so reminiscent of Isabella, left her flustered and she quickly succumbed, melting into his arms.

Tianyi felt so much like Isabella; with her eyes closed, they could have been the same person!

A mischievous thought crossed Olivia's mind: if Isabella had Bai Miaomiao, maybe she should pursue something with Tianyi.

Seized by the idea, she wrapped her arms around Tianyi's neck and began to return his kiss with enthusiasm.

Tianyi’s eyes flashed with surprise, then darkened with intent, drawing out the scene with exquisite tenderness.

"Cut!" Director Wang's voice broke the moment, announcing the end of the scene.

Olivia snapped back, hastily pulling away from Tianyi, her cheeks flushed with a shy, alluring pink.

Tianyi suppressed the urge to kiss her again, gently straightening her hair.

Director Wang approached, teasing, "Olivia, congrats on finally nailing the scene! Seems it takes Tianyi pulling out all the stops to get you in character. Tianyi, if Olivia gets stuck again, just kiss her!"

Tianyi chuckled, a smile spreading across his face, his eyes filled with a warmth that could melt hearts.

Olivia felt her heart skip a beat, using all her willpower to tear her gaze away and flee.

Why do I feel this flutter just looking into Tianyi's eyes? Is this what they call being fickle?

Oh, heavens!

In the following days, Tianyi indeed used the same tactic, often leaving Olivia breathless and off-kilter.

She found herself increasingly confused, sometimes unable to distinguish between Tianyi and Isabella, but the more she thought about her lost chance with Isabella, the more she enjoyed her time with Tianyi.

If fate meant she and Isabella were not to be, then finding someone similar might be the next best thing.

Olivia cherished her moments with Tianyi. After filming wrapped, she accepted his invitation for coffee. As they stepped out, a shrill, haughty voice called out behind them, "Olivia Stewart, stop right there!"
