Title: Longing for Mom

Ethan King couldn't help but feel a wave of frustration wash over him. Watching Olivia Stewart quietly mold clay with a serene expression, he sometimes thought that if she remained like this, spending a lifetime by her side could be a kind of happiness. But he knew he couldn't be that selfish because this wasn't the life Olivia wanted.

After some hesitation, Ethan decided to share his new discovery with Isabella Peterson and suggested that she bring the twins to see Olivia. On the other end of the line, Isabella fell silent. The thought of his beloved woman being with someone else was hard enough, and now the kids too? What would he have left? But could he really just watch Olivia live without emotions or desires?

As Ethan waited impatiently, ready to hang up, Isabella's soft voice finally came through, "Okay."

The next day, Isabella, with the twins in tow, flew over on a private jet. Under the vast blue sky, standing by the edge of the pasture, was Olivia. Isabella's heart fluttered uncontrollably at the sight.

He wanted to approach her, but his feet wouldn't move. The scene was so peaceful and beautiful that he feared his presence might disrupt it. Standing at a safe distance, he watched Olivia with a mix of longing and caution, afraid to miss any subtle change in her expression and equally afraid to disturb the dreamlike moment.

A soft, childlike voice broke the stillness behind him, "Look at all the sheep!"

Turning around, Isabella saw Guoguo, dressed in a snow-white princess dress, toddling over like a little lamb. Following closely behind was Keke, with a serious expression, correcting her, "Silly! Those are horses!"

Watching the little ones, Isabella couldn't help but smile with relief. In the month since Olivia left, he had thrown himself into work and the twins' upbringing. He had hired the best early childhood educators, and the twins, naturally bright, had already picked up quite a bit of language, expressing most of their needs and emotions despite being just over a year old.

"Guoguo, slow down!" he gently reminded.

"Daddy!" Guoguo squealed joyfully when she spotted him, running over.

With a thud, she tripped and fell, sitting on the ground with a pout, on the verge of tears. Keke hurried over, scolding her with a stern face, "The grass here is soft, just like the carpet at home. How could you get hurt?"

Embarrassed, Guoguo pushed Keke's hand away, pouting, "Bad brother!"

This little incident caught Olivia's attention. She turned her head, and slowly, a smile spread across her face. It wasn't just a faint grinâ€”it was a bright, genuine smile that lit up her entire face, making her look like a fairy, breathtakingly beautiful.

Isabella was about to scoop up Guoguo but froze at Olivia's smile, standing there with his hands suspended in mid-air, completely forgetting what he was doing.

Guoguo, rubbing her eyes, tugged at Keke's sleeve, "Brother, pretty lady!"

Keke gave a cool snort. Sure, that lady was pretty, even Daddy was mesmerized!

Isabella snapped out of his daze at Guoguo's innocent comment and walked over, ruffling Guoguo's hair with a smile, "Silly girl, that's your mommy!"

"My mommy is that pretty? Oh my gosh!" Guoguo exclaimed with a newly learned phrase from Uncle Ethan, turning and running toward Olivia before Isabella could say more.

"Guoguo..." Isabella called, but it was too late. He could only smile wryly and pat Keke's shoulder, "Didn't you want to see Mommy? Go on too!"

"Okay," Keke nodded, his serious face betraying his eagerness as he hurried after his sister. What child doesn't long for their mother's affection? Let them go, he thought. Hopefully, Olivia can accept them.

As Isabella watched them run towards Olivia, he could only hope for the best. Guoguo ran with abandon, her childish voice ringing like a string of silver bells across the grass, "Mommy! Mommy..."

Olivia stood there, not reaching out for a warm embrace, but her face was graced with a gentle smile. Whether or not she recognized Guoguo and Keke, it was clear she liked them.

Guoguo barreled into Olivia, hugging her leg and looking up with a pout, "Mommy, I missed you so much!"

Olivia didn't move, just looked down at Guoguo. A short distance away, Isabella watched nervously. He suddenly realized his decision might have been too impulsive. What if Olivia pushed Guoguo away? What kind of scar would that leave on the child's heart?

As he started to move toward them, Guoguo looked up at Olivia, tears welling up in her big, dark eyes, "Mommy, why don't you talk to me? Don't you like me?"

Slowly, Olivia reached out and gently grasped Guoguo's arm. Isabella, who had just gotten close enough, urgently called out, "Don't..."

If Olivia threw Guoguo aside, it would be over. But to his relief, Olivia crouched down, wiping away Guoguo's tears with a soft smile. She didn't say a word but her face was full of warmth, and her movements were gentle.

Isabella breathed a huge sigh of relief. Thank goodness! Whether it was the allure of the kids or some natural motherly instinct, Olivia had accepted Guoguo. With such adorable children around, she would surely find her way back.

After drying Guoguo's tears, Olivia held her close. Keke stood by, watching silently. Being the understanding brother, he never competed with his sister, though his dark eyes showed his own yearning.

Guoguo, after snuggling against Olivia for a bit, turned and waved at Keke, "Brother, come too!"

Keke took a small step forward, his face flushed with shy anticipation. Olivia extended her arm, pulling Keke into her embrace as well. The twins nestled on either side of her, softly calling, "Mommy! Mommy..."

Isabella stood nearby, watching this tender scene with moist eyes. If he could, he'd wrap them all up in his arms, cherishing them dearly. 

After a while, Olivia let go of the twins, standing up and gently handing them back to Isabella. She might not have said anything, but she knew Isabella was their dad. As soon as he took them, she turned and walked away without a word.

The twins looked puzzled, Guoguo blinking up at Isabella, "Daddy, what's wrong with Mommy? Doesn't she like me anymore?"

Isabella sighed, explaining softly, "Your mommy has an illness. She can't talk or recognize you right now. So, don't be upset with her if she seems to ignore you or does something that makes you sad, because it's not what she really wants."

Guoguo nodded, half understanding, while Keke's serious little face remained unchanged. Isabella ruffled their hair affectionately. "I brought you here to help Mommy. Hopefully, with your company, she'll start talking again and get better soon."

"I know how to cheer people up!" Guoguo beamed, wriggling out of Isabella's arms. "I'm gonna play with Mommy!"

Isabella set down Keke too, patting his shoulder, "Go on, take care of your sister."

The little ones toddled after Olivia, their small figures full of determination. Isabella watched them go, feeling both proud and a bit heartbroken.

"Don't worry, I'll take care of them," Ethan King's voice came from behind, a bit cold but still unmistakably flamboyant.

Isabella turned to him, sincerity in his voice, "Thank you."

Ethan, usually on the receiving end of Isabella's sharp tongue or ridicule, felt a bit awkward seeing him so sincere.

He shrugged nonchalantly, smirking, "Afraid I'll run off with your wife and kids?"

"If it means Olivia can be happy and carefree, I'd let her go," Isabella's voice was tinged with sadness, wafting away like a whisper in the wind.

"Oh, since when did the always proud and jealous Mr. Peterson become so magnanimous?" Ethan teased, his devilish face full of mockery.

Thinking of how Olivia had changed under Isabella's care, Ethan felt a surge of anger. Just over a year, and she'd fallen into depression and withdrawn from the world. The urge to punch Isabella flared up again.
