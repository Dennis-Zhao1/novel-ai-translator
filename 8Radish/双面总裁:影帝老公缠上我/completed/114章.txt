"Hey, it's about to start, let's go!"

"Uh, I..."

Olivia Stewart was in a mild panic, trying to shake off Ty's hand but realizing it would be rude, so she let him hold it. Her mind was a whirlwind of confusion. Sure, she used to have a crush on Ty, but now she was sort of "taken," thanks to that possessive Isabella Peterson. If he popped out from some corner and saw them, she'd be in big trouble.

Ty suddenly glanced at her, his ocean-blue eyes carrying a gentle warmth. "Your hand's all sweaty. Are you nervous?"

"Uh, a little, I guess!"

"Don't be nervous. I'm here with you," Ty said, squeezing her hand tighter and pulling her closer. Then he leaned down, whispering into her ear, "Did I mention you look stunning today?"

Boom—

Olivia Stewart froze, her cheeks flushing red. Wow, being complimented by your idol is quite the experience!

But then she had a sudden thought—did any reporters catch that moment? Would the crew gossip to Isabella Peterson about it?

Her anxiety spiked again. "What, afraid your boyfriend will get jealous?" Ty teased.

"No, no, it's not that!" Olivia shook her head vigorously.

"Still single, huh?"

"I, I, I..." Olivia stammered, unsure how to describe her complicated relationship with Isabella Peterson.

"Good!" Ty smiled, pulling her petite frame into a gentle embrace, his long arm conveniently covering her bare shoulder.

Feeling awkward, Olivia tried to resist a little. "Mr. Ty, you, you..."

Ty looked at her seriously. "Olivia Stewart, we're going to be playing a couple soon. It's important to build chemistry both on and off-screen. Plus, for the new drama's promotion, we need to appear close. You'll have to get used to it."

"Oh!" Olivia nodded obediently, like an attentive student. "No wonder Mr. Ty is such a top actor; you're so dedicated!"

Amy Green stifled a laugh, only to be nudged by Isabella Peterson, who silently reminded her to be quiet. The bodyguards and assistants behind them quietly observed Olivia and Ty's interaction, each with a different expression.

Ty and Olivia made their way to the launch ceremony, instantly capturing everyone's attention as they appeared. Eyes widened in awe.

Wow! They look perfect together!

Who would've thought Ty could switch from playing a cool, aloof CEO to a sunny, young heartthrob with such ease? And Olivia, no wonder she was chosen by the top producers—she was like a fresh jasmine after rain, exuding charm.

And to think, the ever-so-picky Ty, who never let any female co-star near him, actually had his arm around Olivia!

A second later, the reporters snapped out of their daze, frantically capturing shots from every angle as Olivia and Ty made their entrance.

Blinded by the flashing lights, Olivia instinctively turned her head. Ty noticed and shifted, using his broad frame to shield her from the cameras. Such a thoughtful gentleman!

Olivia whispered her thanks, and Ty playfully replied, "How are you going to thank me?"

His tone carried a hint of Isabella Peterson's mischievousness, leaving Olivia puzzled. She glanced up at him, but Ty had already returned to his gentle demeanor. "Just kidding, Olivia. Don't take it to heart."

Even if she wanted to mind, Olivia couldn't bring herself to.

They reached the main venue where the entire crew of "Send an Angel to Love You" had gathered. Sophie Cook, dressed in all her finery, looked like a peacock showing off her feathers. Despite being youthful, her attempt at high-end sophistication backfired, adding an unwanted air of age.

Seeing Olivia and Ty arrive together, jealousy flashed in Sophie Cook's eyes. Olivia must've had some tricks up her sleeve to win Ty over right at the start!

Sophie Cook conveniently forgot that they were the main actors, and this was a promotional event. Of course, they were supposed to appear close.

Seeing Ty, many stars tried to get close to him. Sophie Cook wanted to flaunt her charms too but found herself stuck in the back, unable to get near Ty, enduring glares from other actresses.

Soon, security ushered the crowd away from Ty, leaving many disappointed. Witnessing Ty with Olivia made them think he had changed, but he remained distant and aloof, as always.

Except, it seemed, with Olivia.

Was this just a promotional tactic, or had Ty's heart been captured by this pure and beautiful girl?

Despite the curiosity and disappointment, everyone maintained a friendly facade, as expected in showbiz.

The launch ceremony began, led by the company's vice president. It was a simple affair, with the VP giving a brief speech before unveiling the camera to announce the start of filming.

Next, the crew would shoot a few scenes for promotional posters. After a brief introduction, everyone changed into their costumes.

For a modern romance drama, the wardrobe change wasn't complex. Olivia and Ty, guided by their assistants, donned their character outfits.

Reappearing, Olivia wore a pink princess dress, her hair in a high ponytail, looking fresh and radiant. Her delicate face, with bright eyes like black onyx set in white jade, was both lively and pure.

Ty emerged in a perfectly tailored white suit, highlighting his tall figure. His elegant and aristocratic aura was unmistakable, with fair skin, deep features hinting at mixed heritage, and blue eyes as captivating as the sea. His slightly curly sandy hair added a touch of rebellious charm.

What a striking heir he made!

Their appearance sparked another round of cheers and camera flashes. It wasn't time for interviews yet, so the reporters took as many photos as they could.

After all, Olivia and Ty together were a sight to behold!

Sophie Cook, in her maid's outfit, stood in a corner, her scarlet-painted nails scratching the tray in her hand with a piercing sound, drawing annoyed looks from the crew. To her, the minor role Olivia had secured for Sophie was a deliberate insult.

On stage, the curtain rose for the photo shoot. Instead of filming on location, they used a 3D backdrop.

Seeing the backdrop, Olivia gasped, her hand covering her mouth, her eyes brimming with excitement.

The backdrop was Peach Blossom Town!

Her childhood home, where she grew up!

Hadn't Peach Blossom Town been developed into a business district? How did the crew recreate such a vivid image?

Gazing at the old buildings, Olivia felt a wave of nostalgia.

Ty noticed her eyes glistening with joy, a doting smile in his blue eyes.

Under the director's guidance, Olivia and Ty posed for the cameras, promoting the new drama.

Olivia was in a daze, but Ty's guidance prevented any major blunders. When they filmed a scene where they gazed into each other's eyes, Olivia's entranced stare was mistaken for deep affection, earning praise from the photographers.

For the final shot, they stood close, with Peach Blossom Town as the backdrop. Olivia tiptoed, face upturned, shyly waiting for a kiss. Ty leaned in, smiling tenderly, as if ready to kiss her.

Their proximity was almost palpable, breaths mingling.

Such an intimate scene was nerve-wracking!

But they had to hold the pose for a minute, as the director instructed!

Olivia felt both anxious and embarrassed, closing her eyes, her long lashes trembling.

Ty was tempted to close the distance, but restrained himself at the last moment.

Patience, he'd have plenty of time to win her over!

Finally, the director's voice cut in, "That's a wrap!"

Olivia eased, exhaling softly.

Standing on tiptoe for so long had left her feet prickling with pins and needles. She staggered, nearly falling.

Ty caught her waist, concern evident in his voice. "Are you okay?"

Olivia nodded, feeling a strange sense of déjà vu. 

This was a feeling she couldn't quite describe, almost like hearing Isabella Peterson's voice in her mind.
