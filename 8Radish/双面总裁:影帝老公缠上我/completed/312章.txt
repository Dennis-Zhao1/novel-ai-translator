Unspeakable Discomfort

"Business meeting? How is Oliver White planning to revive the White Corporation? Didn't it go bankrupt ages ago? Where did he get the money to make a comeback?" Olivia Stewart wondered aloud, staring curiously at the shiny, red-gold invitation card in her hand.

Isabella Peterson smirked sarcastically. "The Martin family has a wide network. Years ago, one of Grace Martin's uncles went abroad to start a business and disappeared. Just a few months ago, a lawyer showed up with his will. That uncle had no heirs, so he left a hefty inheritance to Grace Martin. Oliver White, who had ignored Grace Martin and her daughter for years, suddenly became her devoted attendant as soon as he saw the inheritance. He even sent her to the best hospital for cosmetic surgery."

Olivia Stewart shook her head in disbelief. Her so-called biological father was truly motivated only by profit!

With a dismissive gesture, Olivia tossed the invitation aside. "Well, since he's already using Grace Martin's inheritance to revive the White Corporation, I guess he won't bother me anymore."

Isabella raised an eyebrow. "Quite the opposite. Before, when the White Corporation was in shambles, Oliver didn't dare approach you. Now that he thinks he has something to stand on again, he'll definitely try to reconnect with you. After all, if the White Corporation wants to establish itself in Gold City, it still depends on whether I agree or not!"

Olivia looked at Isabella. "So, will you agree?"

Isabella leaned in, giving Olivia a soft kiss on the forehead. "The decision is yours. If you want them to live comfortably, I'll turn a blind eye. But if you feel that wiping out the White Corporation is the only way to ease your anger, then no amount of inheritance will be enough to stop me."

Isabella spoke casually, but there was an undeniable confidence in her tone, as if she already held all the cards.

Olivia lowered her gaze, sighing softly. "Forget it. As long as they don't trouble me anymore, I'll pretend I never knew them."

She longed to remain the daughter of the Stewart family, without a scandalous background, greedy foster parents, and a self-serving father.

That suffocating feeling of distress rose within Olivia again, and she couldn't help but clutch at her shirt, trying to breathe.

Isabella immediately frowned, pulling Olivia into a comforting embrace. "What's wrong?"

Olivia shook her head lightly. "Nothing, I'm just... feeling a bit off."

It was an indescribable discomfort.

Inside Olivia's heart, all her negative emotions accumulated like a snowball, growing larger until they formed a dark cloud that weighed her down.

Sometimes, even the smallest things amplified her inner turmoil. She was aware of her growing depression, even having thoughts that life was meaningless.

This state was dangerous, but Olivia couldn't bring herself to tell Isabella.

The greatest pressure came from her guilt towards Isabella.

She couldn't abandon Tommy, yet she couldn't accept the fact that Tommy was Alexander Peterson's child!

Breaking free from Isabella's embrace, Olivia forced a smile. "I'm going to check on the kids."

Whenever Olivia felt her mood slipping, she would go see the twins to alleviate her low spirits. Unbeknownst to her, her attention towards Tommy was dwindling.

It wasn't that she didn't love Tommy, but the guilt felt like a mountain crushing her whenever she saw him.

Olivia's depression deepened, unaware that Tommy was becoming more withdrawn.

Tommy had become quite self-sufficient, handling many tasks without the help of the staff. But the little guy was increasingly silent, lacking the liveliness typical for his age.

In the garden, the nanny was exercising with the twins, while Tommy was engrossed in something in the bushes.

Olivia approached him.

"Tommy!"

She always called him first.

Tommy turned around, his dark eyes lighting up at Olivia's gentle smile.

Olivia ruffled Tommy's hair before turning to the twins, picking one up with a playful sigh. "Wow, you're getting heavy, little one!"

The six-month-old twins were growing quickly, and Olivia could no longer hold both at once. When the other one clamored for attention, she quickly swapped the baby in her arms with the nanny, keeping her hands full.

The nannies, seeing Olivia's playful struggle with the twins, couldn't help but laugh.

Coco and Gogo laughed joyfully too, their giggles like silver bells, lifting everyone's spirits.

Playing with the twins, Olivia felt her mood improve, as if the negative emotions were being gradually pushed back.

In the corner, Tommy watched the heartwarming scene, a trace of envy in his eyes.

He wished Aunt Grace would hold him too!

But he didn't dare ask.

Since Isabella threatened to throw him out if he tired Olivia again, Tommy had suddenly matured.

Unaware of his true parentage, the staff at the mansion thought Tommy was simply an orphan Olivia had adopted. While they cared for him, there was an underlying lack of respect, replaced by sympathy.

Tommy, a sensitive child, was acutely aware of his place. He became obedient, quiet, and well-behaved.

His compliance masked the shadows within his heart that no child his age should bear.

An ant crawled from the bushes, and Tommy glared at it fiercely before crushing it without hesitation.

"What are you all playing that’s making you laugh so much?" A deep, resonant voice asked.

Everyone turned to see Isabella Peterson approaching in a casual gray outfit. Even in relaxed attire, his tall, athletic frame exuded a lazy, effortless charm.

The two nannies blushed, greeting him with a respectful nod. "Sir!"

Olivia was used to this scene.

At the mansion, any young woman—whether a staff member or gardener, even the children's nannies and nutritionists—couldn't help but blush around Isabella.

If Isabella were the type to attract unwanted attention, the mansion would be overflowing with admirers!

Usually, Olivia brushed off such things with a smile, but today, a strange irritation bubbled up inside her, like she wanted to lash out.

Olivia knew her emotions were off-kilter and tried to suppress the rising anger, but it wouldn't be contained. She quickly turned back to the twins.

Isabella took a few strides forward, lifting Gogo from the nanny's arms. With Olivia holding Coco, she was no longer overwhelmed.

"Tired?" Isabella asked gently. "Why don't you let me hold Coco too?"

He reached for the child in Olivia's arms, effortlessly balancing one on each side.

Olivia, momentarily dazed, only realized what Isabella had said when his hand stretched toward her child. "Oh? What did you say?"

"You're spacing out again?" Isabella sighed playfully. "Let me take the kids. You've been holding them for too long."

Before Olivia could hand over the baby, Coco, upon seeing Isabella's large hand, placed his chubby little one on it, giving it a playful slap and sticking out his tongue at Isabella, turning to stick his diapered bottom in his direction.

What a cheeky little guy!

"Hahaha..." Isabella burst into a hearty laugh, not offended at all.

Gogo, in Isabella's other arm, tugged at his handsome face, laughing gleefully.

Interestingly, Gogo preferred to be with Isabella, while Coco liked to cling to Olivia. One for each of them worked out well; otherwise, they'd be exhausted.

Seeing Isabella and the twins laughing so happily, Olivia felt the gloom in her heart ease a bit.

Isabella would never have guessed that when he took the child from the nanny's arms, his hand had lightly brushed against her. Watching this, Olivia had an impulse to deliver a swift slap!

She fought to suppress her absurd emotions, glancing over at Tommy playing alone, and wondered if, given her jealousy toward a woman who admired Isabella, Isabella felt similarly about Tommy, who was always under their watchful eyes...

Thankfully, the children's laughter once again smothered her dark thoughts before she acted on them.

Olivia playfully patted Coco's little bottom, watching Gogo tug at her dad's handsome face, giggling merrily, and couldn't help but smile herself.

A child's innocent laughter was truly infectious!

Seeing Olivia's face light up with a smile, Isabella's eyes softened with deep affection. If not for the presence of the nannies and children, he would have pulled Olivia into his arms for a loving embrace.

The weather was perfect.

Isabella had planned to head to the office, but holding his adorable little princess and seeing the woman he adored smile, he found himself reluctant to leave.

"I have the whole day to spend with you. Where do you want to go?" Isabella, the ever-busy executive, announced warmly.

Olivia glanced at Tommy, still playing quietly with bugs, and suggested, "Let's go to the children's amusement park!"

The twins were still young, more suited to a baby center, but seeing Tommy's solitary figure tugged at Olivia's heartstrings.

She couldn't show too much attention to Tommy, fearing it would upset Isabella, but leaving Tommy out made her feel guilty.

That overwhelming frustration surged back.

Olivia hurriedly picked up Coco and headed for the door.

But it was only when they reached the amusement park that she realized how wrong her decision had been...
