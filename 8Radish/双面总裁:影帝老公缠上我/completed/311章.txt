Olivia Stewart was lounging in her cozy living room, watching her twins, Coco and Koko, play with their toys. Coco, with her tiny hands, clutched at the button on Olivia’s shirt, her little fingers wiggling with determination until she finally grasped it and giggled triumphantly.

Olivia was taken aback, holding her breath as if the slightest sound might scare Coco away. To her surprise, Coco looked up at her, stretched out her other hand, and with a soft little body, leaned in for a cuddle. It was a clear plea for a hug!

Overjoyed, Olivia carefully took Coco from the nanny, cradling her soft little body, feeling a rush of happiness that felt almost surreal. Even if Coco was initially drawn by the button, Olivia was content.

After a little while, Olivia handed Coco back to the nanny. They were heading to the garden for a stroll with the twins. Olivia turned to head toward Isabella Peterson's study.

The study was at the corner of the hallway, its deep red mahogany door shut tight. Each step Olivia took felt heavier than the last. She had already decided that she couldn't abandon Tutu, a child who needed love. If Isabella couldn't accept this, then perhaps she would leave with Tutu.

But after seeing the twins, Olivia realized that in trying to make up for Tutu, she was also shortchanging the twins. She couldn't split herself in two. What was she to do?

Standing before Isabella's study, Olivia hesitated, unable to muster the courage to knock even though she knew Isabella was inside. Maybe she could pretend everything was fine and just go on as usual?

Thinking of Isabella's patient demeanor made Olivia feel as if a needle had pierced her heart. The idea of taking all three children crossed her mind, but could Isabella ever agree to that?

Olivia stood outside the study door, hesitating for what seemed like ages, her hand raised to knock but retreating each time. She regretted ever asking Isabella for an explanation when she was told to let things go.

Why did Tutu have to be Alexander Peterson's child?

Inside, there seemed to be footsteps approaching. Olivia quickly turned and fled. A moment later, Isabella opened the door, only to glimpse a fleeting shadow.

Determined not to separate from the children, Olivia chose to ignore the situation, pretending not to notice. Past events couldn't be changed, but the future was in her hands. Perhaps more love for Isabella could somehow make up for it.

Dinner brought the family together. Tutu, ever the polite child, climbed onto his little chair without help, reaching out to grab his favorite dishes with impressive dexterity.

Olivia smiled, watching him. Tutu was quite capable when he wanted to be, a testament to his upbringing in an orphanage, where self-reliance was necessary.

Thinking of the orphanage, Olivia's gaze softened. She reached out to give Tutu a piece of his favorite crispy ribs. "Thank you, Auntie Olivia!" Tutu exclaimed, his voice sweet and soft, before diving into his meal with gusto.

Olivia chuckled, glancing back at her plate, now graced with her favorite sweet and sour fish. Isabella, sitting across from her, met her gaze with deep, affectionate eyes. “Eat up while it’s warm. It’s delicious!” Isabella said gently, as though all past disagreements had never happened.

“Okay,” Olivia replied, obediently taking a bite, savoring the taste.

Coco and Koko, unable to eat solids yet, each held a small bottle, their tiny legs kicking in their strollers as they babbled songs, entertaining the nearby staff who chuckled quietly.

Olivia laughed along with them, unable to resist picking up both children, hugging them close. Isabella watched, her eyes sparkling with joy, resisting the urge to join in the fun. Instead, she focused on serving Olivia her favorite dishes, one by one.

Olivia stole a glance at Tutu, prompting Isabella to serve him a portion of silverfish. “These are great for kids, full of zinc and calcium!” Isabella announced.

Tutu, surprised and delighted, thanked Isabella. “Thank you, Uncle Isabella!”

Olivia shot Isabella a grateful look, her eyes glistening slightly.

“Here, have some soup,” Isabella said understandingly, offering a bowl to Olivia, allowing the steam to mask her tears.

Both chose to ignore past unpleasantness, and dinner passed with love and warmth.

Happy, the butler, stood by with hands clasped, maintaining a professional stance. Witnessing the family’s harmony, he turned away to discreetly wipe away an emotional tear.

If only the master and mistress could always be this happy!

Life gradually returned to normal. Isabella arranged for a tutor for Tutu, freeing Olivia to spend more time with the twins.

Haunted by guilt, Olivia devoted herself to Isabella, offering him everything she could. Isabella, enjoying the attention, felt his hidden worries slowly fade away, enveloped in Olivia's affection. Yet, he was unaware of Olivia's private torment, her eyes growing darker and more troubled.

When the twins were six months old, Olivia secretly cut some of their hair and Tutu’s, sending it off for a DNA test.

She couldn't rest without seeing Tutu's results. As for the twins, she was unsure why she doubted.

The timeline matched the period when she was held captive by the Peterson Group, rescued by Alexander. Though Alexander assured her nothing happened, uncertainty lingered.

If the twins were Alexander's, she would lose it.

Waiting for the results felt like living under a guillotine, ready to drop at any moment. Olivia felt disoriented and off-kilter.

When Isabella asked, she claimed exhaustion, which was partly true. Caring for three kids was tiring, and Isabella, a greedy “big baby,” made it harder.

Isabella, assuming he’d overworked her at night, resolved to be more considerate, behaving for a few days.

Finally, a week later, the results came: the twins belonged to Isabella, but Tutu was Alexander’s!

Relieved yet pained, Olivia spent the day in silence, unable to muster smiles, even for the twins.

With Isabella away on a business trip, the staff left her undisturbed. Olivia shut herself in her room.

Tutu really was Alexander’s son! It was hard to accept, even for her.

That night, Isabella returned, rushing in. “I heard you weren’t well? Why didn’t you call a doctor?”

Seeing Isabella’s worried face, Olivia’s heart ached. She reached out, wrapping her arms around him, holding tight.

Isabella, alarmed, gently patted her back. “Sweetheart, what’s wrong? Where does it hurt?”

My heart hurts! I’m sorry and guilty, like acid eating away at me, wishing I could undo it all.

Olivia shook her head. Could she voice this? It would only cause more pain.

Isabella sensed her melancholy, his brow furrowing. “Olivia, is something bothering you?”

“No, no! I just missed you!” Olivia insisted, shaking her head like a drum. Before Isabella could respond, she pulled him down, pressing her lips to his.

A spark ignited in Isabella, and he deepened the kiss, the room heating up…

Afterward, Olivia fell into a deep sleep. Isabella, brushing her damp hair, thought about love and forgiveness. He had chosen right with Tutu.

But he didn’t know Olivia hadn’t let go, but rather etched it deeper into her heart, leading to future sorrow.

After that night, Olivia seemed brighter, smiling sweetly at the kids. But once they slept, she’d stand on the balcony for hours, her silhouette lonely.

Isabella, thinking she needed a break, suggested outings, but Olivia declined.

The wedding dress, ready and waiting, was sent back to their estate. Isabella wanted to set a date, but Olivia always delayed, until he stopped asking.

Life settled into routine, but Olivia grew more melancholic.

One day, Olivia received an invitation from the White family…
