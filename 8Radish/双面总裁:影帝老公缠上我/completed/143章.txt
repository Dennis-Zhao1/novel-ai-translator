Isabella Peterson was definitely pushing Olivia Stewart’s buttons. "You’re like a wild cat, with no manners at all!" she scolded, while simultaneously grabbing a napkin and wiping away the sauce smeared at the corner of Olivia’s mouth.

Olivia pouted and thought to herself, “Yeah, you say that, but you love it.”

Isabella scooped Olivia up from the dining table and carried her to the living room, plopping her down on the couch. With an air of authority, she asked, “Alright, spill it. What do you want from me?”

Uh-oh, busted! But Olivia figured she might as well go for it. She cozied up to Isabella, clinging to her arm, and with a hint of charm, she asked, “So, about that thing with Sophie Cook, could you maybe…?”

Before Olivia could finish her plea, Isabella cut her off coldly, “I’ve already sent her away.”

“What?!” Olivia huffed, releasing Isabella's arm and scooting to the other end of the couch, turning her back in defiance.

Isabella looked at her now-empty arm and frowned. “This girl, always so one-track-minded,” he thought. If he could, he would crack open her head and remove the part that made her so fiercely loyal to Sophie Cook.

After a moment of sulking, Olivia couldn’t resist asking, “Isabella, what did you do to her? I told you, the accident was just that—an accident! The scar on her face is my fault. Are you trying to make me feel guilty forever?”

A mysterious glint flashed in Isabella’s eyes. He picked up the tablet from the coffee table, tapped in some code, and soon a surveillance video appeared. He handed it to Olivia without a word.

Olivia watched as the video showed Michael Wright rowing Sophie Cook away across a serene lake. Sophie looked peaceful, even happy, gazing at the water.

Seeing Sophie was alright, Olivia breathed a sigh of relief. “Okay, fine. If you didn’t want her here, sending her away is okay. But please, can you find a specialist to help with her scar?”

Isabella raised an eyebrow, looking at Olivia who was now sitting far away. “Is that how you ask for a favor?” he questioned.

Ugh, this guy! He’s back to being his usual arrogant self after a good meal.

Olivia scooted back over and gave Isabella a quick peck on his cheek. He still wasn’t satisfied. “Is that all?” he asked, unimpressed.

“What else do you want?” Olivia retorted, rolling her eyes. “You want more?”

“Of course!” Isabella’s mood lifted instantly. He picked Olivia up and started heading upstairs.

“Hey! Put me down!” Olivia protested, pounding her fists against Isabella’s chest. “You’ve gone too far!”

“Never enough!” Isabella’s voice was low and magnetic, sending shivers down Olivia’s spine as he nuzzled her hair with his chin, his eyes filled with an indulgent affection.

Olivia’s heart skipped a beat as she nestled against him, her cheeks flushed. “But… my back still hurts,” she murmured.

Isabella chuckled, a sound that was both teasing and warm, making Olivia huff in embarrassment.

“Stop laughing! Or I’ll bite you!” Olivia threatened playfully, covering Isabella’s mouth with her hand.

Isabella kissed her palm lightly, speaking against it, “Seems like you need more exercise, darling. I’ll have to be more diligent!”

“Shameless!” Olivia scoffed, her face even redder. She used both hands to pinch Isabella’s lips, pulling them into a Donald Duck shape.

Isabella didn’t mind her antics, his eyes twinkling with amusement, letting her do as she pleased.

Lucas Wright watched them from downstairs, a smile spreading across his face. It was rare to see the usually stoic Isabella so happy, all thanks to Olivia Stewart.

Once they reached the bedroom, Isabella tossed Olivia onto the soft bed. She bounced and landed buried in the plush covers.

Pulling herself up with a pillow in her arms, Olivia glared at Isabella. “You’re too much!”

He pinned her down gently, careful of her injuries, and said, “Shh… Just checking your bandages.”

Olivia realized that Isabella’s intentions had been purely to care for her, and she felt her cheeks heat up with embarrassment over her earlier assumptions. Once he finished tending to her wounds, Isabella stroked her hair lovingly. “Get some rest, sweetheart. I have some work to do.”

Olivia tilted her head, concern evident in her voice. “You didn’t sleep much last night, aren’t you tired?”

She blushed at her own words and buried her face in the pillow like an ostrich.

Isabella chuckled, pulling her head back out. “Are you worried about me?”

“…”

“Don’t worry, I’m perfectly fine. If I wasn’t concerned about exhausting you…”

“Go on, go on, work is important!” Olivia cut him off, pulling the covers over her head.

“Rest well, then,” Isabella said softly, leaving the room with a rare show of tenderness.

Once she heard the door close, Olivia peeked out from under the blanket. Grabbing her phone, she quickly called Sophie Cook.

“Sophie, where are you? Are you okay?”

“I’m fine!” came Sophie’s sweet, almost too sweet, reply.

Relieved, Olivia continued, “I’m glad Isabella didn’t give you a hard time. I’ve asked him to find the best specialist for your scar. I’ll send you some money to rent a place. Take care!”

“Thanks, sis. Don’t worry about me!” Sophie replied with a sugary tone that Olivia didn’t catch as insincere. She sent Sophie the money, unaware of the cold smile on Sophie’s face as she received it.

Olivia Stewart, ever naive, had no idea Sophie had changed. She was no longer the innocent sister but someone who had ventured far down a darker path.

As Olivia spent a week recovering in comfort, thanks to Isabella’s care and affection, her wounds healed quickly. A week later, she was ready to return to work.

On Monday, as Olivia prepared for the day, she was surprised to find Isabella already up. “Wow, up early, are we? Off on another business trip?” she teased.

Isabella glanced at her while adjusting his tie, “Hmm?”

“Every time I go back to work, you jet off somewhere. You’re not secretly meeting some other woman, are you?”

Isabella’s interest piqued, his eyebrows arching playfully. “Jealous? Want to check up on me?”

“I’m not!” Olivia protested, though her heart raced.

Isabella tapped her on the forehead with his finger, “I’d rather stay right here.”

Olivia’s face turned crimson, and she jumped back, flustered.

“Time to go, or you’ll be late for work,” Isabella said, putting on his sunglasses, ready to drive her.

Olivia grabbed her bag and dashed out, with Isabella following, both of them soon speeding off in his sleek car.

When they reached the set, Isabella ordered, “Out.”

Olivia grinned mischievously. “You know, you’ve never visited me on set. Now that you’re here, why not come in?”

Isabella, unruffled, tapped his fingers on the steering wheel and simply said…
