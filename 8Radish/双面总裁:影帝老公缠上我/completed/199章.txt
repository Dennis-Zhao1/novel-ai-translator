Once Olivia Stewart arrived on set, she was feeling pretty down, almost like a deflated balloon. She plopped herself down in a chair, not really in the mood to chat with anyone. It wasn’t long before Ethan, a co-star, showed up. He walked straight over to Olivia with a bag in hand.

"What’s this?" she asked, taking the bag from him. It felt warm to the touch. As she opened it, a familiar, mouth-watering aroma hit her nose, making her stomach rumble with anticipation.

"Mini pizza rolls!" Olivia squealed, her eyes lighting up like twinkling stars as she looked up at Ethan. "How did you know I skipped breakfast? And how did you know I love these?"

Ethan gave a casual shrug, a mischievous smile playing at his lips. "Just a lucky guess."

Putting on some disposable gloves, Olivia eagerly picked up a pizza roll and popped it into her mouth. She chewed happily, her words coming out in a muffled jumble, "Mmm, these are amazing! You got them from that famous place in Northside, right? They taste just like I remember!"

With a delicious breakfast now in her belly, Olivia's mood lifted considerably. She devoured the mini pizza rolls, each one disappearing in just a couple of bites, leaving her lips glistening with a buttery sheen, making them look even more kissable.

Ethan couldn’t help but notice her lips and quickly averted his gaze, his Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed hard. This was definitely not the time to make a move; he had to keep his cool.

"Look at you, all covered in grease!" Ethan teased, grabbing a napkin to wipe the corners of Olivia's mouth. His eyes lingered on her glossy lips, his mind wandering to places it shouldn’t.

"Uh, I can do it myself," Olivia said hastily, her cheeks turning a shade of pink as she took the napkin from him and wiped her mouth.

Even though they played lovers on screen, Olivia made sure to keep a professional distance offscreen. Ethan noticed her slight withdrawal, her smile a tad more reserved, but he didn’t mind. He knew how to play the game.

Just then, Amy Green, Ethan's assistant, appeared, waving a phone at him. "Boss, urgent call!" she said, sounding a bit frantic.

Ethan shot her a sharp look, causing her to almost drop the phone in her hurry. But Amy was insistent; the call was from Michael Wright, and it was one that Ethan had instructed her to interrupt him for, no matter what.

With a resigned sigh, Ethan took the call and walked off to a quieter corner, Amy trailing behind him. The two of them looked quite striking together, both tall and handsome, and as they walked away, Olivia couldn't help but let her imagination run wild.

Could Ethan's constant affection be a cover for something else? Maybe he had a secret crush on Amy, or was he perhaps just really good at hiding his true self? Either way, Olivia thought she’d rather see Amy end up with someone she trusted, like her good friend Lucas Wright.

Taking advantage of the downtime, Olivia found her own secluded spot to make a phone call to Ethan King, her longtime friend. Meanwhile, Ethan was getting the lowdown from Michael Wright about some mysterious happenings back at Peach Town.

Michael’s voice crackled over the line, sounding exhausted. "Sorry, boss, nothing suspicious on the surveillance cameras and the manager doesn’t seem to know anything. But Sophie Cook did leave town with Olivia’s crew. I’m not sure if she’s aware of it."

"Sophie Cook?" Ethan’s eyes darkened momentarily. If it weren’t for Olivia's feelings, he would’ve dealt with Sophie long ago. "Stay in Peach Town and dig into the past. Don’t come back until you’ve got answers."

After hanging up, Ethan tossed the phone back to Amy, who quickly dashed off, eager to stay out of trouble. Ethan’s blue eyes narrowed, a glint of determination passing through them before he masked his emotions with a calm demeanor.

A few moments later, Ethan strolled back, hands casually tucked into his pockets. He didn’t head straight for Olivia but instead meandered along the edge of the set, looking like a prince from a storybook taking a leisurely walk.

From afar, Sophie Cook watched him, mesmerized by his presence. He was every bit as captivating as Isabella Peterson, though his charm was more of a quiet, aristocratic elegance, making him a standout even among the actors.

Feeling a gaze on him, Ethan looked up, catching Sophie Cook’s starstruck expression, and couldn't help but smile faintly.

"He smiled at me!" Sophie Cook practically pinched herself, trying to play it cool as she flashed a bright smile back at him.

Ethan’s amusement was short-lived as he turned his attention back to the set. They had a scene together, just a brief one, but Sophie had rehearsed it a million times in her head, especially after Ethan’s earlier encouragement.

Sophie took her chance during the scene, whispering shyly, "Coffee later?"

Ethan nodded, lifting his cup as if to say yes, making Sophie’s heart skip a beat. Her reaction was spot on, earning praise even from the notoriously picky director.

Returning from her own call, Olivia noticed Sophie and Ethan’s exchange, feeling a bit better about the whole situation. Whatever Ethan’s preferences might be, if Sophie was interested, maybe she should have a shot.

After the shoot, Olivia called Lucas Wright and quickly left the set. She had teased Ethan King earlier, suggesting he and Ethan would make a cute couple, and it had set Ethan King off. He insisted they meet at the Peninsula Pearl Café to discuss something important.

With their recent lack of communication, partly due to Isabella Peterson’s influence, Olivia was worried Ethan King might be dealing with something serious. Her concern overshadowed her earlier annoyance, and she hurried along, barely noticing Ethan as she passed by.

Ethan watched her go, his gaze cooling as he processed her swift departure. He signaled Amy, who immediately called Olivia’s driver, David Wright, to find out where she was headed.

"Peninsula Pearl Café," Amy reported back with a thumbs-up.

"Is that your favorite café, Ethan? Let’s go there!" Sophie Cook chimed in, having overheard. Her voice was sweet and playful, with a hint of innocence that was hard to resist.

Amy shivered slightly, imagining how captivating Sophie’s voice could be in more intimate settings. But Ethan seemed unfazed, his brow furrowing in mild irritation at her suggestion.

Feeling a bit slighted, Sophie pouted, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "You promised we’d have coffee, remember?"

Her expression was an uncanny imitation of Olivia Stewart’s, but Ethan wasn’t fooled.
