Isabella Peterson's voice had this deep, velvety quality that was downright hypnotic. Olivia Stewart found herself utterly captivated, her mind going blank, only able to register how incredibly mesmerizing his voice was.

But then, without warning, Isabella leaned in, caught a whiff of her subtle perfume, and suddenly, like a switch flipped, he couldn't resist. He bit her neck.

"Ow! Isabella, are you part wolf or something?" Olivia snapped out of her trance, trying to shove him away.

But Isabella was quick. He caught her flailing hands with one of his, pinning them to the side, and turned his attention to her shirt buttons, popping them open one by one with his teeth.

Flustered, Olivia's mind flashed back to the awkward scene she'd witnessed in the wine cellar earlier. She felt a wave of nausea and turned her head away. "Let go of me, Isabella! You're filthy!"

"No way! I'm gonna show you some love!"

"Love my foot!" Olivia was furious. She brought her knee up with a swift kick, catching Isabella off guard and sending him toppling backward onto the floor with a thud.

"Olivia, you kicked me!" Isabella sat there, looking both shocked and affronted.

Olivia quickly buttoned her shirt back up, giving him a cold look. Seriously, did this guy have to be in the mood all the time? Didn't he see she wasn't up for it?

Still sprawled on the carpet, Isabella watched as Olivia shot him a glance and turned to leave. He wasn’t having it. "Olivia, stop right there!"

She paused, brows furrowing in annoyance. "What now, Isabella?"

"Help me up!"

"Get up yourself!" Olivia wasn't about to indulge him.

He was perfectly capable of climbing those long stairs earlier; he definitely wasn't so drunk that he couldn't get off the floor.

"I'm not moving until you help me!" he declared, stubbornly.

"Suit yourself," Olivia said, turning to leave. She really didn't have the patience for his antics.

"Is that how you treat your man?" Isabella suddenly sprang up, blocking her path, demanding an explanation.

Olivia rubbed her temples, feeling a headache coming on. Who knew a drunk Isabella would be such a handful?

She softened her tone with a sigh, "Isabella, please, can you stop? I'm really tired today and don't want to deal with this."

The incident in the wine cellar was the last thing she wanted to argue about now.

"Tired? Let's go to bed, I'll join you!" Isabella suggested with a gleam in his eye that made Olivia wary.

Wasn't he the one who respected her boundaries before? Why was he being so persistent now?

Olivia pushed away his wandering hands with a grimace. "Go away! You're filthy!"

Isabella pondered for a moment, then nodded. "Right, I did get touched by that woman. I need a shower. You're coming with me to help."

Before Olivia could protest, Isabella was already dragging her upstairs. This man... was definitely drunk!

Olivia couldn't fight back, practically lifted off her feet as Isabella carried her to the second floor. She clung to the railing, yelling toward the kitchen, "Mrs. Wang, quickly, make some strong coffee for your young master to sober him up, ASAP!"

By the time Mrs. Wang hurriedly prepared the coffee and brought it upstairs, the bedroom door was shut tight.

Mrs. Wang stood there with the tray, unsure what to do, until Lucas Wright came up, pulling her aside. "What are you doing? The door's closed, right?"

"But Olivia asked for it," Mrs. Wang said hesitantly.

Lucas glanced at the closed door, then the curtains, and whispered, "They're both in there?"

"I saw Isabella dragging Olivia upstairs," Mrs. Wang replied.

"Then that's settled. Just keep the coffee warm downstairs and make sure nobody comes up," Lucas instructed, eager for Isabella to make the most of this opportunity.

Inside, Isabella had pulled Olivia into the bathroom, locking the door behind them.

"Isabella, what are you doing?" Olivia exclaimed, trying to comprehend the situation.

"You said I was dirty, so you're gonna help clean me up," Isabella replied lazily, unbuttoning his shirt.

"No way!" Olivia blushed at the thought, feeling both embarrassed and flustered.

Isabella's shirt was off, revealing a well-toned chest that seemed to ripple with strength. Olivia quickly averted her eyes, stammering, "Isabella, you're such a... a jerk!"

Isabella raised an eyebrow, mischief in his dark eyes. "You've got two choices, Olivia. You wash me, or I wash you."

"Can I choose neither?" Olivia asked, almost pleading.

"If you don't choose, then it's both," Isabella smirked.

"Both?" Olivia echoed, confused.

"Together," Isabella clarified with a grin.

Oh, come on!

"Isabella, you can't just bully me like this!" Olivia was on the verge of tears. After everything with Sophie Cook, she was already feeling down, and now Isabella wouldn't leave her alone for a second.

Isabella's eyes flickered with something unrecognizable before he resumed his playful drunken antics, wrapping his arms around Olivia. "Baby, I'm not bullying you; I just want to love you properly."

Yeah, right.

Olivia took a deep breath, forcing a smile as she tried to reason with him. "How about this—put your shirt back on, and wait for the coffee to sober you up, okay?"

Isabella chuckled. "I bet Mrs. Wang won't bring that coffee up here for at least two hours."

"..." Olivia was speechless.

"Let's make a bet: if I'm right, I get to decide whether I'm on top or you're warming the bed," Isabella teased.

"I'm not betting!" Olivia refused outright. No matter what, she'd end up on the losing side.

But how was she going to get away from this amorous man?

As if sensing her plan, Isabella lifted her chin with a gentle finger, "You're not escaping this time."

His earnest expression showed no signs of intoxication.

Panic set in for Olivia as she pressed against his chest. "No, Isabella! Remember, I have issues with being touched!"

Isabella didn't let up, slowly guiding her toward the bathtub. "Tonight, I'm curing your issues."

Did he mean business?

Was he really that desperate, or had his feelings for White Yi reached a point where he could overlook his own compulsions?

A wave of conflicting emotions swept through Olivia, dimming her eyes.

While she was distracted, Isabella nudged her into the tub with a splash.

"Ah, Isabella—" Olivia spluttered as water filled her mouth, choking her.

"Olivia, don't be such a wimp! If you drown in the tub, everyone will laugh their heads off!" Isabella teased, rushing over to pull her out.

Olivia emerged like a drenched cat, soaked to the skin and dripping water everywhere.

Jerk! If you hadn't pushed me, I wouldn't be in this mess!

She caught her breath and glared up at Isabella, who gazed back with an intensity that reminded her of a predator.

Startled, Olivia looked down to see her wet clothes clinging to her body, nearly transparent.

Oh no!

"Isabella, you jerk!" Olivia swiped at his face in panic.

Caught off guard, Isabella barely dodged her nails, allowing Olivia to slip free and dive back into the tub, hiding beneath the water with only her head peeking out.

"Olivia! You scratched my face! Who do you think you are?" Isabella barked, realizing he'd been tricked.

"Serves you right!" Olivia retorted, sinking deeper into the water.

Isabella looked at her, a hint of a smirk on his lips. "Jealous, are we?"

Olivia blushed, her silence speaking volumes.

"Don't worry, I'll make it up to you," Isabella promised, stepping closer.

Panicking, Olivia splashed water at him. 

"Isabella!" she shouted, drenching him in her attempt to keep him at bay.

Isabella stood there, soaked and surprised, his hair dripping into his eyes. For a moment, he looked wild and untamed, a far cry from his usual composed self.
