Title: The Star's Fury

"You lunatic!"

Olivia Stewart shrieked, ready to charge forward, but found her wrist firmly held by Skyler. Her temper flared instantly, eyebrows shooting up and eyes blazing. She didn't care if he was some award-winning actor or a heartthrob—she let loose. "You're crazy! Why are you hitting people? Let me go!"

Why? Because I'm your guy!

Skyler's icy blue eyes glowed with a chilling light. His lips were pressed into a tight line, silent but piercing as he stared at Olivia.

Olivia was taken aback by his fury. It was like seeing another side of Isabella Peterson, a person she never imagined could be so similar.

How could it be?

They were two distinct men, with completely different backgrounds and appearances!

This feeling was just too weird!

Olivia frowned, shaking her head slightly. She looked down at Skyler's hand gripping her wrist and asked, "Can you please let go of me?"

Skyler realized he had no right to interfere in Olivia's affairs, but the thought of her cozying up to that flamboyant guy made him want to tear him apart and stake his claim on Olivia right there.

He loosened his grip on Olivia's wrist slightly but didn't let go.

Meanwhile, Lisa maneuvered her electric wheelchair up to Ethan King, asking with concern, "Ethan, are you okay?"

Ethan ignored her, spat blood on the ground, wiped his cheek, and gave Skyler a cold glance. He strode over, his voice calm and commanding, "Let her go!"

It was one of the rare moments Olivia saw Ethan exude true masculinity. He seemed different, less flamboyant, more manly. He'd changed over the months. And he seemed quite familiar with Lisa.

Olivia's questioning gaze fell on Ethan's face, silently asking for an explanation.

But Ethan wasn't ready to explain. He glanced at Skyler's hand on Olivia's wrist, his eyes cold and unwavering, clearly insisting—let her go!

Skyler stood tall and unyielding, exuding a cold aura. His handsome face showed no emotion, his blue eyes laced with disdain.

Clearly, asking him to let go of Olivia was a pipe dream!

Two men locked in a standoff over one woman, right on the set!

And one of them was their idol—Skyler!

Everyone on set was dumbfounded, eyes wide in disbelief.

Rumor had it that Skyler was best friends with the entertainment mogul, but here he was, acting like a jealous lover over a woman!

Could it be that Skyler was so powerful he could charm both genders?

The director, Mr. Wang, noticed the tension and hurried over with a megaphone, glancing between the imposing Skyler and the defiant Ethan, before looking at the conflicted Olivia. He scolded, "It's not break time yet, why are you running around? You can't even get a scene right after so many takes, and you still dare to wander off?"

No sooner had he finished than he felt a chill down his spine. Undoubtedly, the two tall men on either side of him were glaring daggers at him.

Thankfully, Olivia was a sensible girl. She gave Mr. Wang an apologetic smile and turned to Ethan, saying, "Ethan, take a break and let the doctor check your face. I still have a few scenes to finish today, I'll come find you later!"

With that, Olivia turned to Skyler, gently shaking his hand, "Sorry, I shouldn't have left mid-scene. Please don't be mad! Let's get back and finish it, okay?"

Skyler's grip on her wrist relaxed a bit, and he walked her back to the set.

Ethan was stung by Olivia's compromising stance. Watching her leave with Skyler, he wanted to call out but stopped, his hand slowly clenching into a fist.

Olivia Stewart, I won't let you be troubled for long!

In the middle of the set, Sophie Cook had just picked herself up from the ground. Witnessing Skyler's punch in defense of Olivia, she felt her heart shatter.

Olivia Stewart!

Why do the best men flock to you?

This scene wasn't just to get close to Skyler, was it? It was a setup to humiliate me!

I'll remember this!

Sophie dug her sharp nails into her palm, her teeth biting into her lip until it bled.

Back on set, Olivia looked at Sophie with guilt and concern. "Sophie..."

Honestly, she hadn't expected things to get this bad. Even though Skyler's anger was inexplicable, bringing up Sophie as a stand-in now would only add fuel to the fire.

If Skyler lost it during the scene, Sophie might end up getting hurt.

Olivia let out a silent sigh, offering a helpless smile. "Sophie, I'm sorry! I'll do the scene myself. You take a break."

Heh, humiliated and then cast aside, Olivia, you really outdid yourself!

Sophie forced a slightly aggrieved yet obedient smile, nodding. "Okay, sis, don't be like this. It's my fault for not playing the role well, making you suffer too!"

Skyler watched the sisterly interaction coldly, his blue eyes reflecting a mysterious light.

Where did he rank in this girl's heart?

She'd rush to that flamboyant guy without a second thought, worry about Sophie, her deceitful sister, but him?

The man who always had her back, she wouldn't even spare a glance!

She hadn't questioned why he was so furious, only called him "crazy!"

Skyler's blue eyes were like ice, his grip on Olivia's wrist tightening unconsciously...

"Ow..."

Olivia winced, tears welling up in her eyes.

Skyler snapped out of it, releasing her, noticing the red marks on her wrist.

A flicker of regret and tenderness crossed his eyes, and he almost reached out to soothe her but stopped himself, his fingers curling into a half-fist.

Olivia looked up, teary-eyed, and asked, "Skyler, can you tell me what I did wrong?"

Her simple question made any sympathy he had evaporate instantly.

Throwing yourself at other men, and you don't know what's wrong?

Skyler's eyebrows furrowed in displeasure, a fiery blue gaze simmering beneath them.

Noticing the tension, Mr. Wang quickly intervened, "Are you both ready? Let's try to get this scene right in one take!"

Olivia nodded eagerly.

Skyler had been so inexplicably strange today. Being around him made her feel suffocated, and she just wanted to finish her scenes and leave quietly.

Skyler glanced at Olivia, seeing her eagerness to escape, and his face darkened further.

In such a hurry? So eager to see that flamboyant guy?

Hmph! I'll make this scene drag on with retakes, even if it takes all night. Let's see how you find time to meet him!

Skyler's blue eyes flashed with a cold calculation, nodding slightly to Mr. Wang.

Finally getting the nod from the two stars, Mr. Wang happily raised his megaphone, standing on a small stool, "Attention everyone—"

The background music started, soft and mesmerizing.

Gentle candlelight flickered, casting perfect silhouettes as the two drew closer.

Quinn gently held Ava's head, his blue eyes filled with warmth as he leaned down toward her...

Ava, shy and demure, closed her eyes, her long lashes trembling like butterfly wings on a delicate petal.

The scene was romantic, beautiful, heartwarming.

Feeling the warmth on her face, Olivia couldn't help but clutch her shirt nervously.

She was tense, involuntarily so.

Though she tried to appear shy and endearing, she couldn't immerse herself in the role. She didn't share Ava's anticipation for the male lead.

Especially now, with Skyler's masculine presence so close, a familiar sense of déjà vu reminded her of Isabella Peterson, making her even more anxious.

Olivia's lashes trembled violently, lips pressed in a line, a hint of restraint on her face.

That trace of restraint utterly infuriated Skyler.

His blue eyes cooled as he leaned in, nearing Olivia's lips...
