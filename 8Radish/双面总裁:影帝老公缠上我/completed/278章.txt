In a swirl of drama and tension, the grand dinner party was starting to feel more like a soap opera than a social gathering. Alexander Peterson, with his sharp glasses and somewhat delicate features, stood in stark contrast next to his more imposing sister, Isabella Peterson. Even if he didn't have the same commanding presence, his resoluteness left a mark on the guests.

Whispers filled the room as the onlookers commented on the situation. Some criticized Olivia Stewart for playing with emotions, while others noted Isabella's aggressive demeanor. Meanwhile, Olivia seemed unfazed, swirling her juice with a mischievous smirk. She was more than happy to let the siblings fight it out.

As tensions simmered, White Pines, the party's host, attempted to calm the storm. "Olivia, quit joking around with the Petersons," he scolded, trying to play peacemaker.

Isabella's icy stare could freeze a room, while Alexander's gaze was more subtle but equally chilling. White Pines, feeling the heat from both sides, knew he had to tread carefully.

In an awkward attempt to change the topic, White Pines suggested, "Olivia, maybe it's time to change your last name. How about White Olivia Stewart?"

Olivia snorted, unimpressed. "Sounds like some kind of herbal remedy. No thanks!"

White Pines had hoped to rename her to something more palatable, but with the Peterson siblings involved, he decided it was best to drop the matter.

"Well, what do you think then?" he asked Olivia.

"I like Olivia Stewart just fine," she replied coolly. "After all, the Stewart family may not have treated me well, but they did raise me."

The party guests were still watching, eager for more drama. White Pines, trying to salvage the evening, suggested, "Why don't you find a quiet spot for the Petersons to sit, Olivia?"

Olivia couldn't help but smirk at the thinly veiled attempt to make her handle the situation. Isabella suddenly turned and walked out, clearly upset. Olivia rolled her eyes at her brother's retreat.

Alexander, mistaking his sister's departure for victory, followed Olivia to their table. As the party officially kicked off, guests kept stealing glances at their table, eager for more gossip.

The two sat in silence, Olivia focused on her drink, while Alexander attempted small talk. His phone rang, interrupting his efforts.

"Sorry, I need to take this," he said, answering the call in front of her.

"WHAT?" His voice broke the relative quiet, drawing all eyes as he stood abruptly, knocking over his chair. "I have to go," he excused himself, leaving in a hurry.

The crowd's attention returned to Olivia, now the center of speculations. The two Peterson siblings vying for her attention, only to leave mysteriously, was too juicy a story to ignore.

White Pines, noticing the disruption, quickly approached Olivia. "Why did Alexander leave?"

Olivia shrugged. "No idea."

White Pines was frustrated. "Do you realize how many people wish they could be in your positionâ€”two Petersons interested in you, and you just let them go!"

Olivia stood, her smile dazzling yet sharp. "White Pines, you only wanted me back in the family to climb the Peterson ladder. Well, I've ruined that for you. Feel free to focus on your real daughter, Mia White."

White Pines was taken aback. "But..."

Olivia wasn't finished. "You wanted to sell me off to the highest bidder, two in this case. I won't be part of that."

The room grew silent as Olivia's words cut through the air. The harsh reality of high-society matchmaking was laid bare, and White Pines was left red-faced.

"I won't accept you as my daughter!" he spat.

"Works for me," Olivia replied. "Don't call me for any more family reunions." With that, she left.

Outside, Olivia bumped into Isabella.

"Olivia!" Isabella called.

Olivia ignored her, trying to walk past.

But Isabella grabbed her arm. "Come home with me."

Olivia scoffed. "You think you can just demand things from me?"

Isabella, without thinking, pulled Olivia into a fierce embrace, silencing her protest with a kiss.

Olivia struggled, her face flushed. "Breathe, silly," Isabella murmured, releasing her slightly.

Despite herself, Olivia's glare softened. Isabella's laughter was deep and infectious, making Olivia's heart race.

"Let's go," Isabella said, lifting Olivia onto her shoulder.

It was a scene reminiscent of their first meeting, and Olivia couldn't help but yell, "Hey, put me down!"

As the night unfolded, Olivia realized she was caught in a whirlwind of emotions and drama, but maybe, just maybe, it was exactly where she was meant to be.
