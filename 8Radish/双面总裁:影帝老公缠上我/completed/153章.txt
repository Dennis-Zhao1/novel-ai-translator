“Wait, you have a sister?” Ethan King asked, raising an eyebrow at Olivia Stewart.

“Yeah, her name's Sophie Cook. She's acting in the same crew as me. I didn't tell you before because she was worried that having a sister working as a tea lady might hurt her career. She didn't want people to know we're related.”

Ethan scratched his head, momentarily lost for words. “Your sister is something else…”

Olivia shrugged it off with a forgiving smile. “It's all in the past. She was just a kid, bound to make mistakes. Besides, I kept things from you too, so we're even. No need to feel guilty.”

Ethan felt a warmth spread through his chest. “Olivia, you really have a way of comforting people.”

“Touched, aren't you?” Olivia teased, grinning. “I wasn't comforting you! Honestly, if I'd known you were loaded, I wouldn't have been eating street food. I'd have insisted on lobster at this fancy hotel every week!”

Ethan chuckled, affectionately ruffling Olivia's hair. “Silly girl! Now that you know, you can come and mooch off me anytime. I promise 24/7 service!”

“Is that a promise?” Olivia extended her pinky.

Ethan linked his finger with hers, looking more serious than ever. “Olivia, whether I'm Ethan King or anyone else, whether I'm a farmer's son or a model, I'm just a guy who'll play, laugh, cry, and be crazy with you. I'll always stand by your side, right or wrong.”

“Even if I asked you to rob a bank with me?” Olivia joked, breaking the heartfelt moment.

“Of course!” Ethan replied without hesitation.

Just then, a deep voice interrupted them. “Olivia Stewart!”

Both Olivia and Ethan turned to see Michael Wright at the door of the luxurious hotel suite.

“Finally found you, Olivia! The boss wants you back now!”

Michael looked relieved, like he'd just found his savior.

“Oh no! Isabella Peterson!” Olivia exclaimed, pulling out her phone. “My phone's dead! I forgot to call Isabella, and if I'm not home by now, he'll go nuts. I'm doomed!”

She looked like a deer caught in headlights, her panic palpable.

Ethan frowned, gently pulling her back. “Why freak out? It's just a late night after work. Chill out!”

“I can't chill!” Olivia said, scrunching her face. “You don't understand. Isabella is possessive, controlling, and petty. If he finds out I was with you tonight, I'm done for!”

“He actually mistreats you?” Ethan’s voice rose, sharp with concern.

Olivia blushed, fumbling for words. “It's not really mistreatment, more like… well, anyway…”

Seeing her embarrassment, Ethan understood, and his heart sank. He clenched his fists, his expression turning somber.

“Sorry, Ethan. I can't stay. Let's catch up another time!” Olivia said hastily before running off.

Ethan reached out but let his hand drop, watching her leave.

“Oh, wait!” Olivia suddenly stopped, turned back, and ran to Ethan.

His face lit up with hope like a comet shooting through the night sky.

“Is my lip still swollen?” she asked, pointing to her mouth.

Ethan blinked, focusing on her lips, their rosy tint mesmerizing. “Uh… it looks fine.”

“Really?” Olivia touched her lips, unconvinced. “I feel like it’s still swollen. It’s all because of that jerk Benjamin Murphy. He had the nerve to kiss me on set and bit my lip! How am I supposed to explain this to Isabella?”

Ethan was too entranced by her voice to hear her words clearly, captivated by the way her lips moved.

His throat felt dry as if it were on fire. This was the first time he felt such a strange sensation for a woman, different from his past with Lisa.

“Stay here tonight if you're afraid of Isabella,” Ethan suggested impulsively.

Olivia rolled her eyes. “Are you kidding? I don't have a death wish! If I don't leave now, Isabella will definitely lose it. We'll meet up another time!”

She waved, turning to leave again, but Ethan grabbed her wrist.

“Whoa!” She spun around, crashing into his chest.

“Ow… Ethan, you look so delicate, but your chest is rock-hard!”

“Did it hurt?” he asked, concerned. “Let me rub it for you.”

“Get out of here!” she laughed, pushing him away. “What's with you today?”

Ethan held her tighter. “Olivia, would you ever leave Isabella?”

She looked up, startled. “What are you saying?”

“Would you leave him?” Ethan asked, eyes boring into hers.

“I… I have a contract with him. I can't just leave. Plus, my mom's bracelet is still with him. He won't give it back if I just up and leave.”

“Don't worry about any of that!” Ethan insisted. “Just tell me if you want to leave him. I'll handle the rest. Trust me!”

Olivia felt a change in Ethan tonight; his eyes were shining with an intensity that was hard to face. Even with her usually oblivious nature, she sensed something different.

“Ethan!” She clung to his shirt, her voice small and uncertain.

“Just one word, Olivia. Yes or no?” Ethan pressed, desperate for an answer.

Olivia hesitated, her brow furrowing. “Ethan, you're hurting me! You're acting really strange today.”

He loosened his grip slightly but didn’t let go. “Tell me!”

“Ethan, don’t force me.”

“I need to know!” he shouted, his voice cracking, sounding odd yet vulnerable.

He didn’t want to push her, but he couldn’t stop himself. Her silence was enough, but he needed to hear it. Better a quick, sharp pain than dragging it out.

Olivia bit her lip, lowering her head.

Silence. Damned silence.

Ethan held her shoulders, eyes wide, waiting.
