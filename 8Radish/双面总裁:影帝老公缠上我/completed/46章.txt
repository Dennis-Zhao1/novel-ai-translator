In the bustling underground passage filled with people going about their day, Isabella Peterson’s eyes caught sight of a small figure clutching a white electric bass. It was a scene you might overlook if you weren’t paying attention, but for Isabella, the sight was magnetic.

It was Olivia Stewart.

It all clicked for Isabella. The supposed emergency at the West End Bridge was just a ruse by Lucas Wright to get her to see Olivia singing under the overpass. Her grip on the steering wheel tightened as she processed this realization.

Lucas, sitting nervously beside her, was doing his best to make himself invisible. He knew the risk he took by tricking Isabella. A servant deceiving their employer? It was a move that could cost him his job, or worse. But watching his boss struggle between pride and longing was unbearable. Lucas just wanted to help, even if it meant bending the truth.

With a sudden press of the pedal, Isabella’s car surged forward, catching Lucas off guard. He was thrown forward, only saved by his seatbelt from hitting the windshield. His face went pale with shock as he clung to the seatbelt for dear life. When he finally steadied himself and looked up, Isabella had already driven past the bridge.

Surely, she didn’t really plan to leave without seeing Olivia, right? He wondered quietly, regretting his failed attempt to help as he sat there in silence.

As Isabella sped down the road, Lucas, a man not young by any means, felt his heart race with every vehicle that zoomed by in the opposite direction. Closing his eyes, he surrendered to the inevitable thrill ride.

After a few intense minutes, the car finally slowed. Lucas opened his eyes to find they had circled back and were now closer to the underpass where Olivia was performing. So, Isabella wasn’t really ready to let go of Olivia after all.

A soft smile crept into the wrinkles of Lucas’s face as Isabella pulled over, just a few feet away from Olivia. With an air of casual nonchalance, Isabella slipped on her sunglasses and lowered the window.

Olivia stood outside the crowd, strumming her bass and singing softly. Her outfit was simple—a t-shirt and jeans—but she wore it with the kind of youthful vibrancy that could make her look like an eighteen-year-old. Isabella’s gaze fixated on Olivia’s face, entranced by its simplicity and grace.

That familiar innocent beauty, still unchanged after five years, tugged at Isabella’s heartstrings. It wasn’t about being strikingly beautiful; it was about leaving an impression that was impossible to shake.

Olivia seemed oblivious to the car nearby, lost in her own world as she sang, “Every time, standing strong in loneliness, every time, though hurt, I never shed a tear…” The song was an old one but brimming with positive energy, a longtime favorite of Olivia’s.

As she sang, passersby would occasionally stop to listen, some even dropping some cash into her basket. Olivia would acknowledge them with a polite nod, her smile sincere and pure.

Isabella watched Olivia’s every move, feeling her own burdens lighten with each note Olivia sang. Her fingers tapped a rhythm on the steering wheel, following the melody.

“Has she been doing well these days?” Isabella suddenly asked, breaking the silence.

Lucas, caught off guard, realized Isabella was inquiring about Olivia. He quickly nodded, “Since Olivia returned to the Meadow Lane neighborhood, I've had people keeping an eye on her. Her lifestyle hasn’t changed much. She still works at the gym, sometimes visits the food street, and occasionally sings here.”

So, she was doing just fine without him. The only one struggling was Isabella herself.

“She still works at the gym?” Isabella queried.

“Yes, sir. After returning, she told the gym she was let go due to a lack of professional fitness knowledge, so she’s back to serving drinks.”

“And that flamboyant guy still drives her to work?”

“...Yes.”

A shadow crossed Isabella’s eyes, and her grip on the steering wheel tightened, knuckles turning white. “Look into his background and find a way to get rid of him,” Isabella ordered with a chilling calmness.

Lucas shivered involuntarily but nodded, “Yes, sir.”

Isabella went silent again, eyes glued to Olivia, listening to her song, and tapping along to the beat on the steering wheel. Time slipped by, turning into hours.

As the crowd thinned out, Olivia stopped singing and began packing up. She collected her basket from a nearby post and started counting the money—tens, twenties, and occasionally a fifty or a hundred-dollar bill.

Each time she found a larger bill, Olivia’s eyes lit up, and she’d pretend to kiss it playfully. Isabella couldn’t help but wish she were one of those bills, feeling irrational jealousy over a piece of paper.

“Is she short on money?” Isabella asked, breaking the silence.

“Well, she’s not exactly rolling in it. Living expenses in Gold City are pretty high. Most people with regular jobs like Olivia don’t have much left by month’s end,” Lucas explained.

“Tomorrow, deliver her salary to her.”

“Huh?”

“I hired her as my personal trainer but never paid her. Do it tomorrow, as an annual salary.”

“Um, she might not accept it, given her personality.”

“That’s your problem.”

“Yes, sir.”

As Olivia finished counting and packing her things, she suddenly glanced in their direction. Isabella, in a panic, quickly rolled up the window, a rare expression of embarrassment and surprise flashing across her face.

Almost got caught!

If Olivia found out she’d been watching her for two hours, Isabella wouldn’t know where to hide her face. Just as Isabella thought about leaving, Olivia, bass in tow, started jogging towards them.

Busted!

What did she want? To confront or tease? Or maybe she was coming to reconcile?

Isabella secretly hoped Olivia was coming to make peace. If she did, Isabella might just graciously forgive her.

As Olivia neared the car, Isabella assumed a lofty, aloof expression, ready to step out when suddenly an electric scooter zipped past, nearly hitting the door.

Anger flared in Isabella’s eyes, ready to honk when the scooter gracefully swerved around her car, parking right in front of her, blocking her view of Olivia.

Seeing the flashy young man on the scooter, Isabella punched the steering wheel in frustration.

The flamboyant nuisance!

“Hey there, Ethan! You finally made it!” Olivia’s cheerful voice was filled with unmistakable joy as she unceremoniously dumped her belongings on Ethan King and climbed onto the scooter, hugging his waist.

She had run over not to see Isabella but to greet Ethan!

Isabella’s foot hit the gas, and she swerved the car around, determined to follow them.

Lucas glanced nervously at Isabella’s stormy expression, cautiously saying, “Sir, it’s not really Olivia’s fault. You’re driving a security vehicle today, and with so many similar black cars around, it’s understandable she didn’t recognize you.”

Isabella turned the wheel sharply, grumbling internally. The urgency of the bridge incident had him grabbing the first car he found, and now it was somehow his fault?

“Not recognizing me isn’t her fault, but getting on some other guy’s scooter and hugging him? What about that?” Isabella retorted, eyes fixed on the road.

Lucas had no answer, realizing jealousy had taken the wheel.

The plan to lift Isabella’s spirits by seeing Olivia had backfired with Ethan’s unexpected arrival, turning the whole effort into a flop.

Minutes later, they caught up with Ethan and Olivia. Through the window, Isabella watched Olivia’s hair fluttering in the wind, her arms around Ethan’s waist as they laughed together.

Isabella’s gaze darkened, hands gripping the wheel tightly. With a sudden push of the pedal, he sped towards them…
