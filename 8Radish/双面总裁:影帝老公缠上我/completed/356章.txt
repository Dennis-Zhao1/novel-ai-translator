When Gogo was whisked away by the mysterious figures in black, it was supposed to be just another ordinary day for the trio of kids. They climbed into the car, with the twins sitting together on one side and Tongtong and the family helper on the other. Two bodyguards were on high alert, one driving and the other vigilantly scanning the surroundings from the passenger seat.

“Hey, big bro, second bro, let me tell you…” Gogo was in her usual chatterbox mode.

Ever since Olivia Stewart told the twins that Tongtong was their big brother, Gogo had been referring to Coco as her second brother. She’d call them affectionately every day, and whenever she saw Tongtong, she’d greet him with a warm smile.

Tongtong watched Gogo animatedly recount her stories, complete with dramatic hand gestures. He had to admit, his little sister was undeniably adorable—so innocent and pure that it almost made him want to destroy that innocence.

Instinctively, Tongtong tightened his grip on the toy airplane hidden in his backpack. He knew Gogo, with her curious and mischievous nature, would definitely fall for the trick he’d set up. But then…

“Big bro, what are you thinking about?” Gogo had finished her tale but didn’t receive the applause and encouragement she expected from Tongtong. Surprised, she climbed over to him, waving her hand in front of his eyes with a pout of dissatisfaction.

Tongtong snapped out of his thoughts, blurting out, “Oh, I was just thinking about how adorable my little sister is!”

“Hee hee!” Gogo giggled, her eyes curving into crescent moons, her mouth wide with a smile, revealing a set of pearly whites.

Such a bright, innocent smile!

Tongtong suddenly couldn’t bear to look and turned his face awkwardly away. Since Olivia Stewart had brought them together and sternly instructed, “You’re siblings, you must love and take care of each other,” his relationship with the twins had become much more harmonious. Especially with Gogo, who always beamed sweetly whenever she called him big brother.

But she didn’t know that the kindness from her “big brother” was just an act! Whenever he saw her light up with joy over the smallest compliment, he’d secretly snicker at her: Silly little girl!

But today, Tongtong couldn’t bring himself to laugh.

After Gogo had her fill of excitement, she noticed her brothers weren’t in a particularly high mood and eventually quieted down, laying across the seat, fidgeting out of boredom.

“Whoosh—” The smoothly moving car suddenly jolted violently, followed by the screech of the brakes: “Screech—”

“Master, Miss! Are you all right?” The family helper sitting opposite them immediately spread his arms, protecting the twins from lurching forward.

Tongtong, sitting nearby, turned pale at the sound of the brakes. This was the signal he’d been waiting for. While hesitating, he saw the helper’s instinctive move and made up his mind.

In his eyes, the helper rushing to the twins and not to him was a clear sign of favoritism. After all, he wasn’t Isabella Peterson’s biological child! But the truth was, the helper’s first instinct was to protect the twins simply because they were right in front of him, and the sudden stop had sent them tumbling forward. At five years older, Tongtong was capable of handling such situations himself.

But in Tongtong’s self-conscious heart, every detail was twisted and magnified. In his mind, he was the unwanted one, and only if something happened to the twins would Olivia Stewart love him wholeheartedly.

What twisted logic! After the car’s abrupt stop, the bodyguards quickly scanned their surroundings. Given their thorough checks before each trip, a breakdown midway seemed impossible!

The area was quiet with no signs of danger. This was a rural road leading to Watercloud Estate, where traffic was typically sparse.

“Sir, Miss, the car seems to have a problem. Please wait a moment while I check it out!” The driver explained briefly before jumping out of the car. The bodyguard in the passenger seat stayed with the kids.

Soon, a relieved voice came from outside: “No big deal, I accidentally ran over a nail, and we’ve got a flat tire!”

“Oh no! There’s another one!” Hearing this, the guard in the passenger seat joined him outside. One tire was manageable with the spare in the trunk, but with two blown, they’d need to call for help. Fortunately, Watercloud Estate wasn’t far, so reinforcements wouldn’t take long.

The guards quickly relayed the situation to the kids inside, asking them to stay in the car while they called for support and started changing the tire.

Inside, everyone sat quietly. Gogo, feeling restless, peeked out the window. “Why don’t we get out and help?”

Help, or more accurately, just get in the way! Coco shot her a knowing look, clearly uninterested in her suggestion. Gogo, undeterred, turned her puppy-dog eyes on Tongtong, resting her chin on her hands, pleading softly, “Big bro, could you come with me?”

Tongtong, seemingly resigned, adjusted his backpack. “If you’re really that bored, I’ll go with you for a bit of fresh air.”

“Yay! Big bro, you’re the best!” Gogo cheered, hopping out of the car. She was ready to watch the bodyguards change the tire when she noticed Tongtong still clutching his backpack and couldn’t help but tease, “Big bro, you’re such a bookworm! Why are you lugging that backpack everywhere? No one’s going to snatch it from you! I’m not interested in your stuff, anyway!”

“Oh, I forgot,” Tongtong replied sheepishly, pretending to toss the bag back when the zipper slipped, revealing the toy airplane.

Gogo’s sharp eyes caught it immediately. “Oh! What’s this?”

Tongtong quickly covered the backpack, accidentally leaving the toy’s tip exposed.

“Wow! What a cool airplane!” Gogo exclaimed, unceremoniously pulling the toy from Tongtong’s grasp.

Tongtong, feigning panic, reached for it. “Don’t mess with it; it’s just borrowed from a friend!”

Gogo tucked the plane behind her back, grinning mischievously. “Well, let me play with it a bit since it’s already in my hands!”

Tongtong, feigning resignation, sighed. “Just for a little while, then.”

Gogo, delighted, examined the plane, pressing a button with her chubby fingers. The toy suddenly soared into the sky, twirling before heading toward the woods.

“Oh no! My plane!” Gogo cried, sprinting after it.

Tongtong followed closely behind. The bodyguards, busy with the tire, didn’t notice the small mishap. The family helper in the car considered helping but decided against it, seeing Coco still inside and Tongtong chasing after Gogo. After all, the toy couldn’t have gone far, and with Tongtong accompanying Gogo, there shouldn’t be any problems.

In the woods, Gogo ran after the plane, getting farther from the road. Tongtong’s expression darkened as he followed. He knew Gogo would never catch the plane because someone else was controlling it remotely!

Watching Gogo move further from the road, Tongtong fought the urge to call out, “Sister, let’s just go back!” But each time, the words caught in his throat, and he swallowed them.

He was terrified of that sinister man with the snake-like gaze! He never wanted to feel the sting of that little gold knife again!

Ahead, the plane disappeared into a dense forest. “The plane! My plane!” Gogo yelled, pushing through the underbrush.

Tongtong stopped, calling out to her, “Gogo, let’s just leave it. I’ll buy a new one to replace it!”

“But…” Gogo started to argue, her expression suddenly shifting to shock.

Tongtong glanced around, noticing several masked figures in black silently surrounding them. His heart sank, a chilling realization washing over him.

Gogo’s hand clutched his shirt, trembling. Despite her age, she understood the gravity of the situation due to the constant warnings about kidnappings given her status as Isabella Peterson’s child. Even though she had never experienced it firsthand, the simulated scenarios from their security drills flashed through her mind, making everything clear.

Tongtong hesitated, contemplating whether to pry her fingers loose, when Gogo suddenly released him, pushing him away with all her might. “Big bro! Run!”

Tongtong felt his ears ringing with her words. This little sister, whom he often mocked for her naivety, was terrified yet still urged him to escape first!

Why? Didn’t she know he didn’t truly care for her? That all his compliments were just to appease her?

Gogo, you silly girl! It was I who led you here! I’m not in any danger! You are!

Tongtong stood frozen for a moment, then realized the silence behind him. He turned back, but there was no sign of Gogo or the black-clad figures. It was as if their presence had been an illusion.

Panic-stricken, Tongtong began searching frantically. He dared not call out her name, instead combing through the undergrowth, trying to discern which way the kidnappers had taken her.

But the dense forest, swaying in the wind, quickly erased any trace of their passage.
