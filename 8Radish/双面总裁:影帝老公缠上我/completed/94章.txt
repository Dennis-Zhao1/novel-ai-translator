Title: The Uncovered Old News

Olivia Stewart couldn’t believe her eyes. Standing in front of her, a girl with a round face was visibly shaking, clutching her pocket as if her life depended on it. The girl took a couple of steps back, shaking her head, trying to deny what was obvious.

Olivia, her expression stern and her voice icy, said, "I don't like repeating myself."

Hesitant, the round-faced girl slowly extracted a crumpled piece of paper from her pocket and handed it to Olivia. Unfolding it, Olivia saw it was a small cutout from a newspaper, dated about a week ago.

There were several clippings, each with bold, sensational headlines: "Heartless Leading Lady Forces Her Sister to Kneel in Public," "The Fake Innocence of Olivia Stewart Exposed," "Olivia Stewart’s Academy Bullying Scandal," "Disfigured Olivia Stewart Misses Lead Role," and "Grassroots Girl is Actually a Billionaire's Adopted Daughter."

Since her first day at the film academy, the media had painted Olivia as a hypocritical villain, wearing a mask of innocence while being vain and ruthless at heart. Olivia clenched the paper cutouts tightly, crumpling them into a ball.

"Someone really went through the trouble to cut these out and keep them," Olivia remarked, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

"It wasn't us!" The round-faced girl’s legs gave way, and she fell to her knees again, trembling. "I don't know who leaked those stories. They were everywhere, blowing up online, but then they all disappeared overnight."

Olivia's expression darkened as she listened, her fists clenched in anger. How had she missed all this chaos when she had gone home? There was only one person with enough power to erase all traces of the scandal: Isabella Peterson. Yet, Isabella had never mentioned a word to Olivia, quietly dealing with everything behind the scenes.

A warmth spread through Olivia's chest—a realization of Isabella’s silent support. Even the sharp words Isabella often threw her way seemed less biting now. However, the two girls in front of her were not off the hook.

Olivia looked down at the round-faced girl, her gaze piercing. "Why keep these clippings if they’ve disappeared online?"

"Not me! It was Sophie Cook…" the round-faced girl blurted, her voice breaking.

Sophie Cook! Olivia felt like she'd been hit over the head, her mind reeling. Her heart ached as if stabbed, leaving her breathless. The girl glanced nervously at something behind Olivia, muttering, "Sophie Cook asked me to destroy them."

Olivia almost roared in frustration, "Explain!"

The girl stammered through her explanation, "We found them on Sarah Moore's bed, and Sophie Cook told me to destroy them, but you caught me, and I—"

"Enough," Olivia interrupted coldly, feeling the weight on her chest lift slightly. These clippings covered everything that had happened since she entered the film academy, including events after Sarah Moore’s injury. Clearly, it wasn’t all Sarah’s doing. But as long as Sophie Cook wasn’t involved, Olivia could breathe easier.

"Olivia!" Sophie Cook’s timid voice broke through Olivia's thoughts.

Turning, Olivia saw Sophie standing a short distance away. Forcing a smile, Olivia asked, "Sophie, when did you get here?"

"I heard you were back at the academy, so I rushed over. What's this?" Sophie’s eyes landed on the stack of clippings in Olivia’s hand. "Oh no, Olivia, don’t look at those!"

Before Olivia could respond that she’d already seen them, Sophie darted forward, snatching the papers and tearing them apart, scattering the pieces like confetti.

Watching Sophie’s frantic efforts, Olivia felt a part of her heart being filled. Sophie had changed; she cared for her sister now, and that was good. From the moment Sophie had kneeled at the school gate, Olivia had let go of her reservations and distrust.

Now, seeing Sophie’s eagerness to protect her, Olivia felt even more confident in her sister. She moved to grab Sophie’s hands, "Stop tearing them up! You’re making a mess. Someone’s going to get mad at us for littering! Besides, I’ve already seen them. It’s no big deal."

"You… you saw them?" Sophie stomped her foot, frustrated, turning to scold the round-faced girl. "I told you to burn them quietly! What happened?"

The round-faced girl looked like she wanted to disappear, mumbling, "I, I…"

"Alright, it’s just a little misunderstanding. Both of you, keep your lips sealed and go about your business."

"Yes, yes!" The two girls scurried away, relieved to escape.

Sophie turned back to Olivia, concern etched on her face as she examined Olivia closely. "How’s your recovery going, Olivia? It’s been so long, why hasn’t…"

Sophie covered her mouth, eyes welling with tears that shimmered, ready to fall. 

Olivia hurried to reassure her, "It’s fine. I’ve actually recovered. Just a little something I’m hiding for now, using makeup."

"Oh, that’s a relief!" Sophie’s words seemed sincere, but her tone betrayed a hint of disappointment.

Olivia assumed Sophie was upset at being tricked, so she didn’t think much of it. "Sophie, I have to go to class now. I’ll catch up with you later."

Since the incident, Isabella had insisted Olivia take private lessons, so her schedule was tailored specifically for her.

"Okay, see you later, Olivia!" Sophie waved sweetly.

As soon as Olivia turned away, Sophie’s smile froze, twisting into a snarl, her eyes flashing with undisguised malice. How could Olivia be so lucky? How could she possibly heal from those scars?

Sophie stood there, biting her lip, her sharp nails digging into her palm. She seethed with hatred.

"Sophie!" The round-faced girl reappeared, peeking nervously in the direction Olivia had gone. "Thank goodness you showed up in time. I was so scared!"

Sophie turned coldly, "A Chanel set, as promised. But remember, if you can’t keep quiet, don’t blame me for being ruthless."

"I won’t, I swear! You can count on me!"

"Count on you? What if I hadn’t shown up? Would you have sold me out?"

Sophie leaned in, her voice low, "My friend mentioned he’s thinking of selling some videos."

"No, no!" The round-faced girl paled, "I promise, never again! Never!"

Sophie straightened, looking down at the girl, exuding the arrogance of a swan. She reveled in the power she held over others, the way they groveled before her.

When would Olivia Stewart beg her like this?

Sophie smirked, a sinister smile, and walked away with her head held high. Since the "Director Adams" incident, she’d lost her innocence and joy. Henry Adams called her regularly to that dingy apartment to vent his frustrations, and she had to comply, or who knew what a thug like him might do?

Though humiliated, Sophie was smart. She struck a deal with Henry, helping him find other girls to use, acting as middlemen. She could quickly identify girls who were vain and materialistic, like the round-faced girl.

Sophie began running with Henry, maintaining her image at the academy as the sister of the leading lady, always dressed in the finest clothes. To keep up appearances and fund her secret activities, she needed money for high-end cosmetics, dresses, and bags. Olivia’s allowance just wasn’t enough.

Unable to ask Olivia for more money without raising suspicion, Sophie turned to a quick and unusual loan—one that ensnared her further into darkness.

Yet, determined to dethrone Olivia and take her place, Sophie had no intention of turning back. A wicked plan was taking shape in her mind.

News of Olivia’s return to the academy spread like wildfire. Rumors swirled about the two girls caught badmouthing her, forced to kneel and slap themselves.

Olivia brushed off the gossip with a smile. She believed in the truth prevailing and knew she couldn’t please everyone.

Sophie was the only one who could get close to Olivia. Her acts of loyalty and protection had earned Olivia’s complete trust.

After observing Olivia for a few days, Sophie noticed she liked to send her bodyguards away once she arrived at the academy. What a perfect opportunity!

Olivia, let’s see how lucky you really are!

Sophie discreetly called Henry Adams, "Henry, I’ve got a big job for you. If you pull it off, you’ll never have to worry about money again…"
