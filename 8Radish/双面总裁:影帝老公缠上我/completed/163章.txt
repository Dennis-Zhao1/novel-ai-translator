In the bustling world of showbiz, there was never a dull moment, especially when Tianyi was involved. Picture this: Tianyi, all fired up, unleashing his frustration at Amy Green, his assistant, for barging in too soon after the paparazzi had just dispersed. “What if they caught you?” he snapped, his voice rising like a summer storm.

Amy, trying to calm the situation, nudged him with her elbow. “Boss! Boss!” she whispered urgently, pointing outside the trailer.

Tianyi’s annoyance was momentarily forgotten as he followed her gaze. There, not too far away, stood Olivia Stewart, her eyes twinkling with mischief and a smile that could light up a room. Tianyi's demeanor shifted instantly, his long legs carrying him out of the trailer with a grace that seemed almost otherworldly. “Hey, Olivia, I hope I didn’t scare you back there.”

Olivia chuckled, recalling a phone call that had left her a bit confused. “Nah, not at all! I actually got to watch a pretty entertaining show,” she teased, her laughter bubbling up. “You were amazing out there, scaring off those reporters. It was hilarious!”

Tianyi couldn’t help but grin at her unrestrained joy. He loved seeing her like this—happy, carefree, and just a little bit cheeky. Once her laughter subsided, his expression turned serious as he ruffled the top of her head gently. “You’ve got guts, I’ll give you that. But you shouldn’t have come over during all that chaos. What if the paparazzi had noticed and turned on you?”

Olivia rolled her eyes playfully. “Oh, please! I’m not that reckless. I slipped in through the side entrance while you had them all distracted. Pretty smart, right?”

Tianyi’s lips curled into an amused smile. This clever little troublemaker sure knew how to navigate her way around things. But just as he was about to bask in her antics, Olivia bowed solemnly, catching him off guard.

“Uh, what are you doing?” Tianyi asked, raising an eyebrow.

Olivia straightened up, her face serious. “Thank you for standing up for me earlier. I really appreciate it.”

Tianyi frowned slightly, not liking the distance her formality seemed to create between them. Didn’t she know he enjoyed doing things for her, seeing her happy?

Seemingly sensing his thoughts, Olivia bowed again. “And I’m also sorry about yesterday.”

“Sorry?” Tianyi was puzzled, recalling how she had accidentally pushed him into the mud. “You mean for that?”

“Yeah…” Olivia’s cheeks flushed with embarrassment. “I didn’t mean to! I just stood up too quickly and didn’t realize you were right there. I know you don’t like getting dirty, so I panicked and ran.”

Tianyi’s blue eyes flickered with an unreadable emotion. Her explanation today seemed more genuine compared to last night’s cheeky claim that she did it on purpose. He couldn’t help but feel amused at her honesty.

Seeing his silence, Olivia’s face scrunched up adorably in distress. “Look, I’ve thanked you and I’ve apologized. What more do you want? If anything, yesterday’s drama with the photographers was because you kissed me! We’re even now, right? And about the mud… let’s just drop it, okay?”

Tianyi’s eyes sparkled with mischief. “And if I don’t want to drop it?”

Olivia huffed, giving him a playful glare. “Then I’ll tell my boyfriend, and he’ll beat you up!”

Behind them, Amy Green stifled a laugh but quickly scurried away when Tianyi shot her a warning look.

Turning back to Olivia, Tianyi’s face softened with amusement. “Fine, let’s call it even.”

“Great!” Olivia beamed, relieved. “From now on, no more sneaky revenge from me, and no more surprise kisses from you!”

Tianyi chuckled softly, thinking to himself, *Well, no more surprise kisses, sure. But who said anything about not kissing you at all?*

As Olivia waved and turned to leave, Tianyi reached out, catching her wrist. “Hey, Olivia…”

She looked back, surprised. “What’s up?”

Tianyi’s voice lowered, gentle and probing. “How did you know about that hidden path yesterday? Did you remember something?”

Olivia hesitated, a bit thrown by his question. “I… I didn’t really know what I was doing. It just felt like the right place to go. When I saw the mud, I couldn’t resist playing in it.”

She glanced at him, sheepishly hoping he hadn’t noticed the little mud figurine she had crafted in his likeness.

Tianyi’s expression darkened slightly, deep in thought. “Alright, go get ready.”

“Okay…” Olivia nodded, heading off to her dressing room, still puzzled by his behavior. Was he just acting, or was there more to it?

Sophie Cook, her assistant, suddenly appeared, pulling Olivia aside with concern written all over her face. “Are you okay?”

Olivia laughed it off. “I’m fine! You’re a bit late to the rescue, though.”

“Hey!” Sophie shook her head, exasperated. “I rushed over as soon as you called, worried you’d be mobbed by those reporters. Look!”

Sophie rolled up her sleeve, revealing bruises on her arm, evidence of the crowd’s chaos.

Olivia gasped, tenderly blowing on Sophie’s arm. “Oh no! How did this happen?”

“They shoved me while I was trying to find you!” Sophie pouted.

“Next time, just find a safe spot and stay put, okay? I can handle myself.”

“I won’t!” Sophie insisted stubbornly. “If you’re ever in trouble, I’ll be there.”

Olivia was touched, feeling gratitude swell within her. She gently tended to Sophie’s arm, unaware of the cunning smile that briefly crossed Sophie’s face. 

In reality, Sophie had indeed gotten caught in the crowd, but her intent was more sinister. She had tried to stir things up to draw attention to Olivia, hoping the chaos would lead to Olivia being swarmed. Yet, seeing Olivia unscathed and chatting with Tianyi left her fuming inside.

But Sophie had learned patience. She played her role well, using her injuries to gain Olivia’s trust. Once alone, Sophie slipped into the restroom, pulling out her phone to post a malicious rumor online: Olivia Stewart, backed by a wealthy patron, had used her connections to land the lead role, seducing both the director and producer, and now their beloved Tianyi.

Sophie’s fingers danced over the screen with malicious glee. Once the rumor spread, she was sure Olivia would be buried under a tidal wave of public outrage.

Feeling satisfied, Sophie deleted any trace of the message from her phone, her smile triumphant and unyielding.
