还给我那个文件！

So, it was one of those nights where Sophie Cook found herself in a dingy part of town that most people would avoid after dark. As she watched the lights fade and the buildings get shabbier from the backseat of the cab, her anxiety grew.

The cab driver, a friendly-looking middle-aged guy, gave Sophie a concerned glance through the rear-view mirror. "You sure you want to be here alone, miss? This area can get a bit sketchy at night," he said, sounding genuinely worried. "It's not exactly safe for a young woman to be wandering around here by herself."

Sophie forced a smile, "I've got some urgent business to take care of."

When the cab finally stopped at the edge of a rundown neighborhood, the driver turned and shrugged apologetically. "This is as far as I can take you, miss."

Sophie handed him the fare. "Thanks," she said, trying to sound braver than she felt.

The driver hesitated, looking down the dark alley. "Tell you what, I'll wait here for you. It's tough to find a cab around here at night, and I’d hate to leave you stranded."

This unexpected kindness made Sophie think of her dad, James Cook. He used to bring her little treats home, even when he’d had a bit too much to drink. She blinked back the memories and the sting in her eyes. "No need," she said, "I might be a while. But how about giving me your number? I'll call you when I'm done."

"Sure thing!" The driver scribbled his number on a piece of paper. "I’ve got a daughter about your age away at college. I always hope she meets good people too. Just trying to do my bit."

Sophie took the paper, tucked it into her bag, and stepped out of the cab. The driver kindly turned his headlights to illuminate the alley, and Sophie followed the beam of light deeper into the neighborhood.

She knocked on the door of a shabby little house. It creaked open to reveal Henry Adams, balding and grinning like a Cheshire cat. "Sophie! Come on in," he said with a sleazy charm.

Sophie shivered inwardly but knew she had no choice. She needed that video back, no matter what. Swallowing her reluctance, she stepped inside. As soon as she did, she heard the door slam and lock behind her.

"What are you doing?" she stammered.

Henry's smile grew even more unsettling. "Now that you're here, why rush off? Stay a while, have some fun with us."

Sophie recoiled but found herself trapped in the embrace of another man. "You just walked right into my arms, sweetie," he laughed as others joined in, their laughter bouncing off the walls.

The room was filled with men, some familiar from a previous encounter, others not. They were all part of Henry's ploy to trap her, and she realized too late that she had been naive, desperate to climb the social ladder.

Outnumbered and exhausted, Sophie slumped against a worn-out sofa, her breath coming in gasps. She knew there was no escape, and her thoughts turned bitterly towards Olivia Stewart, her sister. If only Olivia had helped her, introduced her to her influential contacts, maybe she wouldn't be in this mess.

As the night dragged on, filled with dread and loathing, Sophie clung to one thing: her hatred, not for herself but for Olivia—Olivia, who had always taken what should have been hers.

By the time it was over, dawn was just breaking. The men left, satisfied, while Henry counted his earnings, savoring the sound of bills rustling like sweet music.

Sophie lay motionless, a husk of her former self. When Henry finally approached, grinning with his crooked teeth, he taunted, "Had enough? Want some breakfast?"

"Get lost!" she spat, summoning whatever energy she had left.

Henry shrugged and sauntered off, humming to himself. But Sophie wasn't done. "Wait!" she called after him, struggling to sit up. "The video! Give it back!"

Henry feigned ignorance, but Sophie wasn't fooled. She lunged at him, fueled by desperation, and knocked him to the floor.

"Okay, okay," he gasped, handing over a USB drive. Sophie snatched it, smashed it to bits, and ground it under her heel.

"Feisty, aren’t you?" Henry chuckled, unfazed as he dusted himself off. "I gave you the video, didn't I?"

"What about backups?" Sophie demanded.

Henry spread his hands innocently. "That's it. I'm not a tech guy. Deleted everything else."

Sophie didn't trust him but saw no evidence of computers or gadgets. She finished dressing, picked up her bag, and headed for the door. Just before leaving, she spun around. "Your phone. Hand it over!"

With a resigned shrug, Henry passed it to her. Digging through it, she found a copy of the incriminating video and deleted it. Satisfied, she tossed the phone back.

Henry feigned a pout. "I was saving that for later, you know."

"Disgusting," Sophie muttered, spitting on the floor before storming out.

Stumbling out into the cold morning air, she felt the chill seep into her bones. But at least now she was free, the nightmare behind her, for now.

At the alley's end, the cab from last night still waited. Sophie climbed in without a word, eager to leave this place behind.

"Are you alright, miss?" the driver asked gently.

Sophie was surprised to see it was the same kind-hearted man from earlier. "You’re still here?"
