**The Old Man's Tactics**

"Olivia Stewart, you're awake?"

A stern old man's face appeared above Olivia Stewart. He seemed about the same age as the butler she knew, but his expression was far more severe and rigid.

Realizing she wasn't tied up, Olivia sat up, shook her groggy head, and looked warily at the old man. "Who are you? Why did you bring me here? Where are you taking me?"

"Our master wishes to meet you," he replied, answering all her questions with that single sentence.

It took Olivia a couple of seconds to process this. The 'master' must be Isabella Peterson's father.

"Does Isabella know?" Olivia regretted the question as soon as it left her lips. If they wanted Isabella to know, they wouldn't have gone about it this way.

"I believe the young master will return to the manor soon. Please, Olivia Stewart, be patient," said the old man, handing her a cup of warm milk.

"No, thank you!" Olivia turned her head away coldly. "Who knows what you've put in it?"

The old man lowered his gaze, a glint of something sharp passing through his eyes. When he looked up again, his face was calm. "If my master wanted to harm you, there are a thousand ways to make you disappear without a trace. There's no need for such elaborate measures. He merely wants to meet you. You left with the young master last time in quite a hurry."

"If you wish to starve yourself before seeing the young master, that's your choice," he added, walking away with the milk, his demeanor haughty and indifferent.

But he hadn't gone far when Olivia called out, "Wait!"

A flicker of satisfaction passed through his eyes. This young girl was indeed still naive.

He turned back, "What can I do for you, Olivia Stewart?"

Olivia rolled her eyes. "Bring back the milk!" Since the master just wanted to keep her here rather than harm her, why not drink it? The old man's argument made sense; if she ended up hidden away for a year or more, by the time Isabella found her, she'd be nothing but a skeleton.

Olivia gulped down the milk defiantly, missing the calculating look in the old man's eyes.

After finishing, she set the glass down heavily and sized up the old man. "Are you a butler too?"

"Yes," he replied with a formal bow. "I'm the butler, Alaric, serving the master. If you need anything, Olivia Stewart, just let me know."

"Alaric, Lucas Wright..." Olivia murmured softly, piecing it together. "Are you guys a team?"

A rare, faint smile appeared on Alaric's stern face. "Olivia Stewart, you're quite clever!"

"And where's the other one?"

"He's the butler for the eldest young master."

"Oh." Olivia nodded. Isabella had mentioned a half-brother left by her uncle.

"Uh, Butler Alaric, I'm really bored here. Could you give me my phone to play some games?"

Alaric shook his head gently. "Olivia Stewart, you should rest now."

Strangely, as soon as he spoke, Olivia's eyelids grew heavy. She pointed at Alaric, "You, you..."

Before she could finish, her arm fell limp, her head tilted to the side, and she fell into a deep sleep again.

...

Heat. Overwhelming heat. In a daze, Olivia felt like she was on a grill, turning over and over in agony. Instinctively, she reached for her clothes.

The sudden coolness made her sigh in relief. From the corner of her eye, a flash of light caught her attention.

Olivia's eyes snapped open, her blurred vision taking in the sight of burly bodyguards standing shirtless a few steps away, watching her with detached indifference.

What am I doing?

Panic cleared her mind, and she quickly covered herself. But the burning sensation inside her flared up again, making her want to tear off all her clothes.

She realized she had been set up! The master of Group Peterson was as vile as she had feared.

Do they all want to ruin me?

Olivia bit down hard on her tongue, the sharp taste of blood flooding her mouth and dripping from her lips like a dark flower.

The bodyguards watched her like hungry wolves, their breathing heavy, but none of them moved. They were waiting. Waiting for her to succumb to the torment and shame herself.

As her consciousness began to fade, she bit down on her tongue again. The piercing pain brought her a moment of clarity.

Whoever said biting your tongue could end your life was lying! It just hurt—a lot.

With a pale face, disheveled hair, and bloodied lips and tongue, she looked like a ghastly specter. Yet she couldn't stop her hands from tearing at her clothes.

No, if this continues, I'll be ruined!

Olivia pinched her leg hard, then clawed at her skin, trying to stay awake.

Taking advantage of another moment of clarity, she dashed toward the door.

A bodyguard blocked her path. As soon as she touched his solid frame, she lost control, grabbing and tearing at his clothes in desperation.

Another flash of light caught her eye. She turned to see a high-definition camera set up in the corner.

Shame washed over her, and she broke away from the bodyguard, charging at the camera.

With a loud crash, the heavy camera toppled to the ground, its lens smashing into her foot with a jolt of pain.

Olivia took off her high heel and smashed it onto the lens, shattering it into pieces.

Grabbing a shard of glass, she aimed it at her neck—

A strong force yanked her arm away, the sharp glass cutting into her rescuer's arm, blood flowing freely.

Olivia looked up, her vision blurred, seeing only a shadowy figure. Not one of the bodyguards, but a stranger.

With her remaining strength, she whispered weakly, "Don't touch me... let me... die..."

...

A sharp pain jolted through her body, waking Olivia once more.

She couldn't remember how many times she'd passed out and come to again.

Above her, a high ceiling stretched far away, adorned with intricate Western mythological carvings.

Am I... in heaven?

How could a defiled, filthy woman like her deserve heaven?

Her heart ached, sharper than any physical pain.

Gingerly, Olivia moved.

"You're awake?"

A gentle male voice. Above her, a face as warm as polished jade.

Christopher Davis?

Olivia's eyes widened in shock.

"Where am I?" she tried to ask, but no sound came out. Her throat felt scorched, her tongue swollen and numb like a piece of wood lodged in her mouth.

"You can't talk yet! Why would you bite your tongue, silly?" Christopher Davis gently stroked her hair, his eyes behind his glasses soft and kind. "Don't worry, you're safe here in my little house."

Olivia glanced at her clothes, checking if they were intact.

Christopher Davis patted her head reassuringly. "Relax! No one touched you. You're still the pure, untainted girl you always were."

Her tense body finally relaxed, and she looked at Christopher with gratitude.

A soft knock interrupted them.

"Young master!" A servant entered with a bowl of light, fragrant porridge, handing it to Christopher before leaving quietly.

Christopher lifted Olivia's head, helping her sit up slightly, and blew on a spoonful of porridge before bringing it to her lips.

His gentle eyes watched her as she hesitated.

"Oh, I forgot to tell you," he smiled, "I've changed my name to Alexander Peterson. I'm the eldest son of Group Peterson."

Group Peterson's eldest son? Isabella's uncle's illegitimate child?

That explains it! Olivia blinked, noting his new name: Alexander Peterson.

And what about Isabella? Where is he now?

Olivia looked at Alexander urgently.

"Want to know about Isabella?" Alexander seemed to read her mind. "Finish the porridge, and I'll tell you."

Olivia eagerly gulped down the porridge, choking in her haste, coughing violently. "Slow down, don't rush!" Alexander chided gently, patting her back.

Once she calmed down, she signaled for him to continue feeding her.

Does he mean that much to you? Alexander's eyes darkened as he fed her the last spoonful.

The moment the bowl was empty, Olivia looked at him expectantly, her eyes pleading.

Alexander adjusted his glasses, meeting her gaze. "Olivia, I can tell you, but don't be alarmed."

"Isabella has returned to the manor. However..." Alexander hesitated, like he was about to reveal something difficult.

"The footage of you in the room with the bodyguards—it was shown to him!"
