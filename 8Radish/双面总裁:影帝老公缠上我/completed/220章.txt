Olivia Stewart bit her lip, her eyes filled with worry. She had just left the hospital and was scanning the surroundings, hoping to find a part-time job that would allow her to care for her mom during the summer.

A job advertisement on a large electronic billboard caught her attention: "Urgently hiring a full-time personal caregiver. Applicants must be between 18-25 years old, with pleasant features and a pure demeanor. Excellent pay. Interested parties, please call for details!" A phone number followed.

The words "Excellent pay" were like a beacon of hope for Olivia, and despite her nerves, she dialed the number.

After a brief phone interview, Olivia was asked to meet at a nearby coffee shop.

Feeling a glimmer of hope, Olivia calculated her mom's schedule and realized she could make it in time. She hurried to the coffee shop, the only one in the small town of Meadowville, nestled in the western corner.

At the coffee shop, Olivia spotted a sophisticated and elegant woman seated, her expression one of disdain as she stared at her coffee cup. This must be the woman behind the ad. Probably rolling in money to afford personal care!

Olivia approached with a shy smile, "Excuse me, are you Mrs. Chu?"

The woman looked up, "You must be Olivia Stewart, the applicant?"

Olivia nodded, "Yes."

Mrs. Chu raised an eyebrow, scrutinizing Olivia from head to toe, a slow smile spreading across her perfectly made-up face.

"Sit," she gestured.

Olivia sat down, "Mrs. Chu..."

Mrs. Chu frowned, "Call me Mrs. Chen from now on."

Olivia nodded, "Okay, Mrs. Chen."

"I'm quite satisfied with you. Name your price." Mrs. Chen said bluntly.

"Uh..." Olivia hesitated, slowly raising one finger. She thought, a regular caregiver earns about $120 a day. As a student yet to graduate, would asking for $100 be too much?

Before Olivia could speak, Mrs. Chen declared, "How about $10,000 a month, for you to take care of my son for a year?"

Ten thousand?

Olivia almost fell off her chair in shock. Either this lady was off her rocker, or Olivia had misheard.

"But there's a condition—you have to be my son's girlfriend."

No wonder the pay was so high!

Olivia felt like she'd been slapped across the face, her cheeks flushed. She stood up abruptly, "I'm sorry, Mrs. Chen, I have a boyfriend. As much as I want this job, I trade in labor, not emotions!"

Mrs. Chen looked at Olivia with dissatisfaction, "You have a boyfriend? Why didn't you say so earlier?"

"I... didn't think it would matter for a caregiver job!" Olivia retorted.

"Are you living together?"

Such a direct question!

Olivia's face turned crimson, her anger twisting her features, "What are you talking about? We're not married yet! We've only held hands at most!"

Seeing Olivia's embarrassment, Mrs. Chen smiled, reassured.

"Good to know." Mrs. Chen leaned back, resuming her composed demeanor. "I've looked into your situation. If it wasn't for your pure appearance, I wouldn't consider an ungraduated student. Don't reject me too quickly. Your mom has a serious kidney condition, and just the weekly treatments are beyond what you can afford, not to mention a transplant."

Olivia sank back into her chair, unable to deny the truth in Mrs. Chen's words.

Mrs. Chen continued, "Just be my son's girlfriend for a year. Not only will your mom's medical expenses be covered, but there will also be enough left over for a secure future."

"But I already have a boyfriend," Olivia grasped her clothing tightly, "and I can't pretend to be someone's girlfriend."

"You know why I chose you? Because you're genuine." Mrs. Chen sighed, her polished facade slipping to reveal genuine sorrow. "My son was born with a heart condition. Doctors said he wouldn't live past eighteen. I've kept him alive with the best care, and now he's twenty. Recently, his doctor said he only has a year left. Surgery might offer a slim chance, but only a ten percent success rate."

Olivia covered her mouth in shock. A young man with only a year left to live—how tragic.

Mrs. Chen dabbed her eyes with a handkerchief. "My son has always been different, isolated, with few friends. But he's exceptionally bright, coding software and learning languages from a young age."

Speaking of her son, pride shone through Mrs. Chen's words.

"He wants the surgery, even with the odds. I couldn't refuse him. The doctors insist he must be in peak condition, so I brought him here to recuperate."

Mrs. Chen suddenly grasped Olivia's hand, desperation in her eyes. "Do you know what it's like to have just a year left? My son is so talented. Why does fate want to take him away? He's never experienced love. His life is incomplete. Why?"

Olivia felt the pain in Mrs. Chen's grip, sharing the sorrow of a mother about to lose her child. She didn't pull away, instead biting her lip in empathy.

"Olivia, please, be his girlfriend. Even if the surgery fails, at least he won't have the regret of never having loved."

Gently, Olivia withdrew her hand, "I'm sorry, Mrs. Chen. I told you, I have a boyfriend. If this is for a caregiving position, I’m interested, but not as a girlfriend."

"My son can't do anything to you with his condition! Just give him emotional support. Pretend, if that's all it takes. I know my son will like you, Olivia. I'm begging you."

"Sorry, but feelings can't be forced. I can't pretend. My boyfriend wouldn't understand, even if it's just an act."

"Alright," Mrs. Chen sighed, releasing Olivia's hand, wiping her tears. "I hope you can understand a mother's plea and think of your own mother as well."

The mention of her mom hit Olivia like a needle to the heart. Afraid of betraying her emotions for money, she quickly said, "I think my mom is waking up. Goodbye!"

Olivia fled the coffee shop, feeling as if she'd just escaped a surreal dream. She ran back to the hospital, still in shock.

Before she could catch her breath, she heard her mom, Sophia Allen, shouting from the hospital room, "Where is everyone? Do you all want me dead?"

Olivia rushed in, "Mom!"

"Where have you been? Even you are abandoning me now?"

"No, Mom, don't think that way!" Olivia helped Sophia Allen sit up, "I just went out while you were napping to find a part-time job to earn some money."

Sophia Allen calmed down, looking at Olivia with a mix of emotions.

Olivia hesitantly suggested, "Mom, maybe I should find a job. While it's still summer break, we can bring Sophie Cook back to help take care of you..."

"How dare you!" Sophia Allen erupted again, pounding the bed, "You're just being lazy! You're the older sister, you should do more! Your sister needs to study, what if her studies get disrupted? What if she can't get into a good college? I told you to take care of her after I'm gone, and now you want to ruin her future! Get out! I don't want to see you!"

Sophia Allen pushed Olivia away.

Tears welled up in Olivia's eyes.

She never understood why she was never favored by her parents. Sophie Cook was the apple of their eye, while Olivia was expected to yield as the older sister—it was just natural!

No matter how much Olivia did, it went unnoticed. Her parents focused all their attention on Sophie Cook, giving her the best of everything. When Olivia got into a good school, they couldn't afford it, but they borrowed money for Sophie Cook's tuition even though she didn't make the cut.

Their hearts had long since tilted northward.

Despite feeling hurt, Olivia cared for her mom without complaint, thinking of Sophie Cook as her sister, young and in need of guidance. But today, even after all her efforts, her mother still couldn't see her sacrifices, instead yelling and pushing her away!

Was this the mother she was willing to sacrifice her love for?

The weight of responsibility had finally reached a breaking point, her mother's harsh words the last straw for Olivia. She ran out, tears streaming down her face.

Olivia sat on a cold bench outside the hospital, sobbing. Suddenly, she heard commotion from above, a voice shouting, "Someone help! There's a suicide attempt happening!"
