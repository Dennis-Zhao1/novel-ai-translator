Title: The Biggest Decision

Tommy had searched all around the area, but there were no signs of anything. Frustrated, he plopped down onto the ground, feeling defeated. 

Earlier, he couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy when he saw Gigi's lively and adorable personality, charming everyone around her. He secretly wished he could ruin her happiness. But when Gigi pushed him away and screamed, "Run, big brother!" it was like a wake-up call for his long-buried conscience.

Just hearing her call him "big brother" struck a chord deep within Tommy. He couldn't shake the image of Gigi being captured by that sinister guy with the gold knife, imagining her delicate skin being cut, and her big, innocent eyes filled with despair. His heart ached as if someone was jabbing it with a needle.

The thought of Gigi ending up like him someday sent shivers down his spine. He couldn't bear it. Determined, Tommy grabbed a handful of grass and got back on his feet, stumbling forward with renewed purpose.

The underbrush was dense, and Tommy, near the brink of a breakdown, wandered aimlessly. Suddenly, he tripped over something, almost falling again. Annoyed, he kicked it with all his might, sending a small stone flying and rustling the surrounding grass and leaves.

A bright red object caught his eye. Bending down, he found an ordinary glass marble with a flower-like pattern in the center. Something clicked in his mind. He picked it up, feeling a sharp edge with his thumb. His eyes widened in realization.

This was the marble he had once given to Gigi! He remembered how ecstatic she was when he handed it to her, secretly mocking her in his mind. He had only given it to her because it was chipped, and he no longer wanted it. Yet, that little fool was over the moon with joy!

Clutching the marble tightly, Tommy hurried forward. The thought of his past behavior toward Gigi filled him with such regret that he wanted to slap himself.

The forest was thick with dried grass and thorns, but Tommy didn't care. He ran, focused only on his goal. Soon, he noticed trampled grass ahead, a bit chaotic but indicating the direction the men in black had taken.

Tommy increased his pace, ignoring the scratches on his ankles. At the edge of the woods was a dirt road. Parked there was an inconspicuous black convertible, with the men in black barely visible through the trees.

Tommy crouched down, using the grass as cover, and cautiously crept closer. He held his breath, parting the grass just enough to see.

Through the blurry shadows, he saw the man with the golden hand handing over a wad of cash to the men in black, who then left quietly.

The Snake Man!

Seeing that metallic hand made Tommy instinctively shrink back, nearly collapsing into the grass. The Snake Man seemed pleased, glancing at the car's trunk with a sinister smile.

Was Gigi locked inside? Where was he taking her? The thought of that damp, snake-infested cave he once knew made Tommy's skin crawl. But if Gigi was taken there too...

Tommy stealthily moved toward the rear of the convertible. Though he often wanted to teach Gigi a lesson for being so innocently cheerful, he found he couldn't just stand by when she was in danger.

He quickly approached the back of the car. The Snake Man seemed lost in thought, standing still for a while before suddenly getting into the car.

Just as the Snake Man got in, Tommy emerged from the grass, grabbed the edge of the trunk, and climbed up swiftly.

The convertible's trunk was covered with thick black tarpaulin, concealing everything inside. Tommy crouched in a corner, adjusting to the dim light before he could make out Gigi lying motionless in a corner.

What had they done to her? Panicked, Tommy hurried over, turning her face towards him, only to be hit by a strong, unpleasant smell. He quickly turned his face away, feeling dizzy despite holding his breath.

Realizing they must have used something to make her faint silently, Tommy moved to the edge of the trunk, gently lifting the tarp to let in the cool breeze, hoping to wake her up. But even after several minutes, she didn't stir.

The rustling of branches on the car's trunk made a sharp sound. Tommy quickly lowered the tarp, fearing the Snake Man might notice.

The trunk returned to its stifling darkness. Sitting next to Gigi, Tommy felt the car's bumpy ride on the country road. Fear crept in as he wondered why he had climbed in without thinking.

If Gigi hadn't been unconscious, she might have screamed upon seeing him, alerting the Snake Man. They both would've been doomed!

Even now, sitting helplessly beside her, Tommy knew they were heading for danger. He shivered, hugging himself for warmth.

The bumpy ride shifted him closer to Gigi, her warm body calming his restless heart. She had the courage to push him away and tell him to run. Could he be less brave than a little kid?

Tommy resolved to take a risk. The security team would notice their absence soon and come looking for them. He clenched his fists, bolstering his courage.

For someone who had endured such torment, facing it again required a lot of bravery. The car rattled along a winding road, slowing down due to rough terrain. It clattered like an old man with asthma.

The dimming light made it hard to see, perhaps because of the thick forest or the late hour. Tommy sat in the trunk, biting his lip and contemplating an escape plan. A bold idea flashed in his mind.

He stood, lifting Gigi to the edge. The car's jostling made him stumble, both of them falling with a thud.

Instinctively, Tommy shielded Gigi, taking the brunt of the fall on his arm.

A dull thud echoed. Tommy felt a sharp pain in the back of his head, but he gritted his teeth, refusing to make a sound.

Gigi lay on his chest, still unconscious. Holding her tightly, he lay there, barely daring to breathe. The noise was loud enough to draw attention. If the Snake Man discovered them, it would all be over.

Time seemed to crawl by. After a long wait, the car continued its bumpy journey, the Snake Man apparently unaware of the commotion.

Relieved, Tommy gingerly sat up, determined to get Gigi out before they were discovered.

He carefully dragged her inch by inch, mindful of her delicate skin. As he moved, Gigi began to wake, her long lashes fluttering. But in the dim light, Tommy didn't notice.

He slowly pulled her to the edge of the trunk, finally reaching it.

Tommy carefully peeked outside, looking for a dense part of the forest to push her out safely. It was a risky move, but it was their best shot at escape.
