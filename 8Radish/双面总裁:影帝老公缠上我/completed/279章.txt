Olivia Stewart was a whirlwind of emotions, her fists pounding against Isabella Peterson's chest in a flurry of frustration and fear. But she knew better than to continue when Isabella, with that infuriatingly magnetic voice of hers, warned, "Olivia, if you keep this up, I might just have to take you right here."

Instantly, Olivia froze, memories of their past encounters racing through her mind. She knew Isabella wasn't kidding, and the thought sent a shiver down her spine.

Then, like a bolt of lightning, a terrifying thought struck Olivia. "Isabella, you jerk! Let me down!" Her voice trembled with urgency.

Isabella quickly set Olivia down, her sharp intuition picking up on Olivia's distress. "What's wrong?" she asked, concern etched across her features.

"My baby..." Olivia's voice was barely a whisper, her face drained of color.

Baby! Oh no, how did they forget about that little detail? Isabella's face paled as she fumbled for words, "Olivia, are you okay? How do you feel?"

Taking a deep breath to steady herself, Olivia replied, "I'm fine, no unusual feelings."

"No chances, we're going to the hospital!" Isabella declared, sweeping Olivia up in a gentle but firm embrace.

As they made their way through the hotel corridor, a wave of guests appeared, their eyes widening in recognition and surprise. Wasn't that Isabella Peterson, the elusive heir of Group Peterson, carrying Olivia Stewart?

Olivia, blushing furiously, buried her face in Isabella's shoulder, gripping her shirt tightly. "Put me down!" she whispered urgently.

"Stay still," Isabella commanded softly yet firmly, ignoring the curious stares as she hurriedly carried Olivia out to their car.

Once inside, Isabella carefully placed Olivia in the passenger seat, her touch as gentle as if handling a newborn. Olivia couldn't help but giggle at the tension in Isabella's muscles, reaching over to pat her arm. "Really, I'm okay. No need to panic!"

Isabella, lips pressed into a thin line, leaned in to buckle Olivia's seatbelt, a rare seriousness settling over him. He made sure the belt was comfortable, his focus unwavering.

Watching him, Olivia felt a warmth spreading through her, a sweetness that she couldn't quite contain. Isabella's care was a balm, soothing past misunderstandings and hurts.

With Olivia secure, Isabella slid into the driver's seat, glancing back at her with a reassuring nod. "We're moving."

Olivia chuckled at his overprotectiveness. This man...

The drive to the hospital was tense yet steady, Isabella's brow furrowed with concentration. He wanted to get there swiftly but was cautious not to jostle Olivia.

As they arrived, Isabella wasted no time, scooping Olivia up despite her protests about the onlookers. "No way! What if something happens?" Isabella's tone brooked no argument.

Olivia sighed inwardly, leaning into his embrace as he carried her inside. Lucas Wright, already in position, had arranged for the hospital's top specialist to be ready.

Isabella didn't slow, racing to the specialist's office with Olivia cradled in his arms. Olivia felt a pang of concern for him. "You're sweating, let me walk!"

Isabella's brow furrowed, "You're complaining about me?"

Not wanting to argue, Olivia stayed quiet, knowing they'd soon be inside and Isabella would have no choice but to put her down. Yet, once in the office, Isabella surprised her by taking a seat and placing Olivia on his lap, glaring at the specialist. "Check her now!"

The specialist, slightly taken aback, gestured to the examination room. "Please, place her on the bed."

"Right." Isabella, reluctantly, complied, carefully setting Olivia down.

The specialist started the examination, while Isabella hovered protectively. "Isabella, could you wait outside, please?"

Isabella's expression hardened, "Why should I?"

The specialist pointed to the "No Entry" sign for men, his meaning clear.

Realizing but unwilling to leave, Isabella insisted, "She's my partner. Just do your job!"

"Get out of here!" Olivia's voice was a mix of embarrassment and irritation.

Isabella, seeing her frustration, backed down. "Fine, I'll wait outside. Call if you need me!"

As he left, Olivia found herself smiling despite everything. This man...

The specialist, resuming the check, chatted lightly with Olivia. "Isabella seems very attentive."

"He's alright," Olivia replied modestly, a blush creeping up her cheeks.

"It's rare to see someone with his status so involved," the specialist noted, his tone appreciative.

Olivia's smile faltered slightly. Isabella wasn't officially her husband, after all.

Suddenly, Isabella's voice boomed from outside, "What's taking so long?"

"We're doing an ultrasound," the specialist explained before letting out a startled exclamation.

"What is it?" Isabella burst back in, eyes wide with concern.

Olivia's heart raced, "Is something wrong with the baby?"

"No, no, everything's fine," the specialist assured them. "In fact, Olivia, you're expecting twins!"

Twins?

Olivia's tension evaporated, a bright smile breaking across her face.

Isabella, however, remained a picture of calm, turning to the specialist with a warning edge in his voice. "Next time, don't scare us like that."

"Yes, of course," the specialist replied hastily, focusing back on his task.

Olivia watched Isabella, a mix of emotions swirling inside her. Why wasn't he happier about the twins?

But then she noticed his tightly clenched fists, the lines of his face drawn taut with worry, his eyes fixed on the ultrasound screen.

He was worriedâ€”intensely so.

"Will she have a tougher time with twins?" Isabella asked, voice low.

"Yes," the specialist replied. "Twins mean more strain on the mother's body and a higher risk of complications."

"And giving birth? Is there a danger?"

"There are risks, yes," the specialist continued, unaware of Isabella's growing concern. "Blood clots, placental issues, even hemorrhaging."

Isabella's hands clenched tighter, his mind clearly wrestling with difficult thoughts.

"But don't worry," the specialist started to reassure.

But Isabella cut him off, voice urgent, "Can we... can we terminate them now?"

"What?" Both Olivia and the specialist were stunned.

Olivia's eyes filled with tears, anger and disbelief in her voice. "Isabella, how could you?"

"I can't lose you for the sake of two unborn children," Isabella's voice was raw, like something fragile and precious was breaking inside him.

Olivia's heart skipped a beat, seeing the fear in his eyes, the vulnerability he rarely showed.

She realized then, he was terrified of losing her, willing to make any sacrifice.

"You idiot," she thought, a mixture of frustration and tenderness welling up inside her.

"Isabella, it's not as bad as you fear," the specialist explained, working hard to assuage his fears.

As Isabella's tension slowly eased, another wave of challenges awaited them...
