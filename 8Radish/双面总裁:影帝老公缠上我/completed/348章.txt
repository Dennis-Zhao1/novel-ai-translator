“Why don't you like him?” Olivia Stewart asked, noticing her daughter's hesitation.

Coco glanced at her sister, Gogo, who was beaming with pride. "This whole castle was my work, and she's taking credit?" Coco thought, but decided to keep it to himself. Gogo loved to boast, and it was harmless.

Olivia and Isabella Peterson had watched the whole scene unfold from outside, understanding the real situation but choosing to play along. They exchanged knowing smiles and gave Coco a nod of approval.

Olivia walked over, inspecting the castle closely. "Wow, the design is impressive, everything is so detailed. You've really improved, Coco!"

Isabella nodded in agreement. "It truly is great!"

Hearing their praise, Coco couldn't help but let a shy smile slip through his normally cool demeanor. Gogo, on the other hand, was over the moon, as if she had been the one praised.

She leaned close to Coco, practically yelling, "Big brother, they think you're amazing! And I do too!"

Olivia chuckled, shaking her head at Gogo's innocent antics. Just moments ago, Gogo had claimed she helped build the castle, yet now she was quick to reveal the truth.

Olivia ran her fingers through her daughter's hair. "My little joy, you're amazing too! You and your brother make us so proud."

Isabella simply scooped Gogo up, giving her a playful nuzzle with his stubbly chin, showing his affection.

Gogo giggled with delight, wriggling out of his arms and grabbing a lump of clay from the table. She dashed over to Coco and held it up triumphantly. "Big brother, this is my mushroom! Put it in the castle!"

Coco eyed the lump skeptically. If Gogo hadn't named it, he would've thought it was a pancake.

Coco hesitated, "Gogo, our castle doesn't have a garden, maybe you can make something else?"

"No problem!" Gogo replied confidently, placing her "mushroom" on the second-floor balcony. "Mushrooms don't need a garden, right?"

Coco sighed, "Alright."

"Yay!" Gogo cheered, carefully adding her creation to the castle. Coco studied the castle, his eyes landing on the "pancake mushroom" with a mix of pride and reluctance.

Olivia and Isabella hid their laughter.

After making sure everything was in order, Coco turned to Olivia, "Mom, this is a gift from me and Gogo to you."

Olivia's eyes lit up, "For me?"

Coco nodded. "Yes."

Gogo chimed in, "Mommy, do you like our gift?"

Despite only making a single mushroom, Gogo was used to sharing in Coco's accomplishments, claiming it was all about sharing joy.

Olivia chuckled, "I love it, of course!"

Isabella, feeling a bit left out, asked, "What about a gift for Dad? Without my hard work, where would you two be?"

Gogo, not catching the underlying meaning, hugged Isabella. "Don't worry, Dad! We'll make you a castle too, with an even bigger mushroom!"

Isabella laughed, "Sounds great!"

Gogo tugged on Coco's sleeve, "Let's get started!"

Coco glanced at Isabella, his expression unchanged, "What does a grown man need with a gift?"

"Hey!" Isabella protested, feigning outrage.

"I'll sculpt you a horse instead," Coco said casually, already diving back into his work.

Olivia couldn't help but laugh, whispering to Isabella, "See, he's just like you, stubborn and proud!"

Isabella grinned, "Of course, he's my son!"

Meanwhile, Gogo happily joined Coco, eager to help.

Olivia watched her kids, amused by Coco's patient indulgence of his sister. "Where's your older brother? Why didn't you invite him to join?"

"He doesn't like playing with us," Gogo replied bluntly, adding, "And we don't like playing with him!"

Olivia frowned, "Why not?"

Though her eldest, Torin, was a bit reserved, Olivia had hoped he'd bond with his younger siblings. But Gogo's tone suggested something deeper.

Gogo sensed Olivia's concern and explained, "He started it. He doesn't like us."

Olivia felt a pang of guilt. Torin's upbringing was different, and she realized she needed to bridge the gap between him and the twins.

She knelt next to Gogo, "Your brother had a tough childhood. Can you try to befriend him?"

Gogo hesitated but nodded under Olivia's hopeful gaze.

Coco, however, abruptly stopped his work, "I don't want Gogo to have to do that!"

Olivia was surprised. Coco was always the mature one, and his reaction indicated something serious.

"What happened, Coco? Can you tell me?" Olivia asked gently.

Coco stood firm, "I just don't agree."

It was rare for Coco to speak so defiantly. Olivia turned to Gogo for answers.

Gogo, more straightforward, recounted a breakfast incident where Torin's cold demeanor had nearly led to conflict. Coco had stepped in to protect her, but the tension had remained.

Olivia rubbed her temples, realizing Torin's aloofness was affecting the twins. She needed to address this before it escalated.

"Your brother... he's like I was once, not great at making friends," Olivia explained. "If he does something that upsets you, try not to take it to heart, okay?"

Gogo pondered this, then nodded, "Is he sick too? Okay, we'll be nice to him."

Coco shrugged, "As long as he doesn't upset Gogo, I'm fine."

Olivia kissed her children's foreheads, grateful for their understanding. "Alright, go have fun!"

"Yay, let's make Dad's gift!" Gogo exclaimed, returning to Coco's side with renewed energy.
