Olivia Stewart pressed her ear against the door, listening intently for a moment before cautiously sliding back the bolt. She nudged the door open, inch by inch, just enough to poke her head through, like a young deer sipping water at a stream with all the wariness it could muster.

Barely had Olivia Stewart peeked her head out when a hand shot through the narrow opening, grabbing her arm and yanking her out as if she were a kitten. Suspended mid-air, she found herself staring into the mischievously cold eyes of Isabella Peterson. She let out a wail, "Oh no, I’m doomed!"

“Hey, let’s talk this out,” Olivia pleaded.

Isabella’s lips curved into a slight smirk. That smile was infinitely scarier than her scowl, sending chills down Olivia's spine.

“Isabella…” Olivia tried again.

“What are you hiding from?”

“I’m not hiding! Just, uh, went to the bathroom.”

“All done?”

“Yep, all done.”

With a swift move, Isabella pinned Olivia against the door, leaning in to steal a kiss. Olivia barely had time to process the sting on her lips before Isabella took the opportunity to deepen the kiss. When it finally ended, Olivia was left breathless, leaning against Isabella's arm for support, while Isabella looked completely unruffled—except for the large vinegar stain marring her otherwise pristine shirt.

Olivia’s senses were overwhelmed by a mix of Isabella’s familiar scent, the sharp tang of vinegar, the faint odor of bathroom air freshener, and a hint of jasmine. This kiss was, without a doubt, the most flavorful one they’d ever shared.

As they parted, Olivia noticed her white dress was now stained with the same inky blotches of vinegar. She shrieked in dismay, “My white dress!”

Isabella surveyed her handiwork, satisfied. “Now we’re even,” she declared.

“You…” Olivia began, but Isabella swiftly scooped her up by the waist.

“Let’s go home,” Isabella said.

“Dressed like this? Aren’t you worried about the mess? Maybe we should wait for the bodyguards to bring us some clothes,” Olivia suggested.

“No need. We’ll strut out just like this. We’re rocking the ‘vinegar chic’ couple look!” Isabella declared with a grin.

Olivia rolled her eyes internally. Really, this man couldn’t handle a drop of water on his clothes, and now here he was, parading around in a vinegar-soaked outfit and calling it fashion!

They made their way out, Isabella striding confidently while Olivia kept her head down, trying to make herself invisible. The lobby buzzed with evening chatter, and Olivia knew they were the center of attention. With Isabella’s commanding presence, it was impossible to go unnoticed.

A girl’s voice cut through the noise, “Look at their unique couple’s outfit! Is that some kind of watercolor design? Where did they get that? I want one too, for a romantic stroll with my boyfriend!”

Olivia couldn’t help but mentally roll her eyes. Watercolor design? More like vinegar-dyed! Couldn’t people smell it?

They headed home, and the first order of business was to rid themselves of the sour smell. Olivia luxuriated in a bubble bath, reflecting on how Isabella had promised her a ticket after dinner. But with all the vinegar drama, it seemed like the promise had slipped through the cracks.

Freshly cleaned and dressed in comfy pajamas, Olivia emerged with the ticket still on her mind. She was tempted to go ask Isabella about it, but then thought better of it. She decided to lock her doors and windows, turning in for the night instead.

Meanwhile, Isabella was leaning against the hallway railing in a dark gray robe. Seeing Olivia’s lights go out, his expression darkened. He’d expected her to come begging for the ticket, but she was surprisingly patient.

Isabella tested her door and window, both securely locked, and kicked the wall in frustration. “Olivia, you’ll come to me eventually,” he muttered.

The next day, Olivia confronted Isabella. “Where’s the ticket?”

“What ticket?” Isabella feigned ignorance.

“Seriously? You’re forgetting things now? The ticket for the concert you promised me in exchange for dinner last night!”

“I don’t recall saying that,” Isabella said, rubbing his temples.

Olivia shot him a piercing look. “You did!”

“Maybe I didn’t sleep well and forgot,” he shrugged.

“There’s still time to remember. Don’t tell me you’re jealous and don’t want me to go?”

Isabella gave an exaggerated eye roll. “Do you think I’d do that?”

“Yes! Isabella, you even made a fuss when someone else peeled shrimp for me. Of course, I suspect you’re worried you’re not as handsome as the singer and don’t want me to see him.”

“So what if I don’t?”

“Isabella, you can’t go back on your word!”

“Little one, that tactic won’t work on me. Just wait.”

Wait? What did that mean? Was he giving her the ticket or not? Or was there some kind of catch involved? Surely he wouldn’t make her do something in return for it, would he?

Olivia decided she wouldn’t compromise, not even for a ticket. If she was going to do anything with Isabella, it would be because she wanted to, not for any ulterior motive.

Two days passed with no mention of the ticket from Isabella. Olivia’s initial disappointment turned to despair.

Friday came, the day of the concert. Olivia rose early, clinging to a sliver of hope. She decided to ask Isabella one last time, even if it meant enduring some playful teasing.

“Knock, knock…” She rapped on his door, but there was no answer.

Had he stayed up late and was now sleeping in? But time was running out!

Olivia knocked harder. “Isabella, are you there?”

“Olivia!” came the voice of Lucas Wright, the family’s butler. Olivia turned, flashing him a sweet smile. “Morning, Lucas!”

“Good morning! Are you looking for the young master?”

“Yes, I needed to ask him something. Did he stay up late last night?”

Lucas looked puzzled. “The young master left for a business trip early this morning. Didn’t he tell you?”

“Oh, I see.” Olivia’s hopes plummeted. So the ticket was a lost cause.

“Is there anything I can help with?” Lucas offered.

“No, it’s nothing major.” Olivia figured Lucas probably wasn’t into concerts, and even if he could get tickets, they’d be long sold out by now. She trudged back to her room, feeling as wilted as a sunburned lettuce leaf.

“By the way, Olivia!” Lucas called after her. “The young master left something for you. I nearly forgot.”

Olivia spun around, eyes lighting up as Lucas produced a colorful piece of paper from his pocket. She snatched it eagerly, eyes widening in disbelief.

A concert ticket!

Overjoyed, Olivia leapt up and hugged Lucas tightly. “Lucas, you’re the best!”

Lucas, though used to youthful exuberance, blushed at her enthusiasm, shaking his head with a smile. Kids these days!

He was about to mention the car Isabella had arranged for her when he realized Olivia had already disappeared.

With the ticket in hand, Olivia flitted back to her room, slipping into her favorite pink dress. The soft silk highlighted her rosy complexion, making her look like a picture-perfect princess. She twirled in front of the mirror, satisfied with the effect, then perched at her vanity to put on a touch of makeup. Her natural beauty needed little enhancement, but a hint of color added a fresh allure.

Humming to herself, Olivia grabbed her bag and slipped on matching crystal heels, feeling like a butterfly ready to take flight. Isabella was away, so she could dress up and enjoy the concert without any concerns.

The bodyguards drove Olivia to the city’s grand theater. The entrance was packed, fans clutching tickets and those without hoping for a chance to get in.

“Olivia, I’ll take you through the VIP entrance. No need to queue,” offered one of the guards.

“Really? Awesome!”

Just as Olivia stepped out of the car, she heard a familiar, heart-wrenching sob. Recognizing the voice, she rushed over.

“Sophie Cook?”
