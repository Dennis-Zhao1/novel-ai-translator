title: The Sweetest Fruit

Olivia Stewart was floating in the pool, her eyes wide with mischief as she glanced up at Isabella Peterson. "Don't come any closer!" she squeaked, trying to sound intimidating but failing miserably. Her big doe eyes were a dead giveaway, like a little lamb trying to reason with a big bad wolf.

Isabella, with a smirk that could melt hearts, wiped the water from her face. "Olivia, if you wanted us to hang out in the water together, you could've just said so," she teased, slowly unbuttoning her soaked shirt with deliberate flair.

"Stop right there!" Olivia's voice was trembling, but she held her ground, pointing an accusing finger at Isabella, who was now standing just a pace away. "You have some explaining to do about tonight!"

"Alright," Isabella said, her voice carrying an edge of playfulness. She leapt into the tub, wrapping her arms around Olivia's waist, pulling her close. "I'll explain everything with actions," she whispered into Olivia's ear, her voice a sultry promise.

"No, Isabella, I haven't..." Olivia's protest was cut off as Isabella claimed her lips, the intensity of the moment sweeping her away like driftwood in a stormy sea.

As the night unfolded, Olivia found herself surrendering, her defenses crumbling under Isabella's relentless charm. The hesitance, the shyness—it added a spark that ignited something deep within Isabella.

"Isabella, please..." Olivia's voice was soft, almost pleading, as she grasped Isabella's hand.

"Do you really think I'd give you a chance to escape?" Isabella murmured, her lips brushing against Olivia's cheek. "I care about what you think, always."

Olivia's heart fluttered at the confession, nestling deeper into Isabella's embrace. It's not that she didn't want this—it's just that Isabella had a way of making everything feel like an exhilarating ride.

Isabella's gaze softened as she watched Olivia, her heart swelling with affection. "You have no idea how many times I've thought of you, Olivia," she confessed, her voice a blend of embarrassment and honesty.

"Oh?" Olivia looked up, her eyes wide with curiosity.

"Yeah, it's a normal guy thing," Isabella grumbled, trying to maintain her cool exterior. "I've been holding back for you, Olivia. So don't you dare think of leaving me."

And with that, Isabella silenced any further protest with another searing kiss, leaving Olivia breathless and overwhelmed.

Hours later, Isabella carried a completely worn-out Olivia back to the bedroom. As Olivia drifted into a deep sleep, Isabella couldn't help but feel a pang of regret at her earlier intensity. But Olivia was too exhausted to worry about her sister or anything else.

Isabella brushed a tender kiss across Olivia's forehead, tucking her in with care. "Sweet dreams, my love," she whispered, her eyes filled with fondness.

Downstairs, Lucas Wright stood vigilantly at the staircase. Isabella approached him with a satisfied air, "Give yourself a raise, Lucas. Whatever amount you want."

"Thank you, sir!" Lucas beamed, his wrinkled face lighting up with joy. He was genuinely happy for Isabella and Olivia, especially after everything they'd been through.

Isabella glanced at him, amused by his enthusiasm. "Just don't let it go to your head."

As Lucas chuckled, his thoughts wandered back to the past. When Olivia had been injured, he had considered resigning, only for Isabella to toss his resignation letter back at him. "You're not abandoning ship, old man," she had scolded. "You're sticking around."

Now, watching Isabella and Olivia together, Lucas felt a sense of peace. The storm had passed, and all was well.

"Sophie Cook's situation?" Isabella inquired, his tone shifted to one of authority.

"She's been sent back to the dorms," Lucas replied. "But I'm convinced she's faking her injury."

"Let her be. Olivia doesn't need to worry about her," Isabella declared, a steely edge to his voice. "But make sure Olivia only hears the good news."

"Understood, sir."

As Isabella turned to head back upstairs, Lucas called after him, "Thank you, sir."

Isabella paused, a rare smile on his lips. "Get some rest, Lucas. You're not a spring chicken anymore."

Back in the bedroom, Isabella watched Olivia sleep, his heart swelling with a love that was both fierce and tender. "I promised you the world, Olivia," she whispered, gently tracing her fingers across her cheek. "And I'll keep that promise."

Olivia mumbled something in her sleep, turning into Isabella's embrace. Isabella chuckled softly, wrapping his arms around her as he settled in beside her.

The next morning, Olivia awoke to find Isabella watching her, those dark eyes twinkling with amusement. "Isabella! What are you doing?" she squeaked, embarrassed.

"Good morning, sleepyhead," Isabella teased, tapping her nose. "It's already noon."

"Noon?" Olivia gasped, her face flushing a deep red as memories of the night before flooded back.

Isabella laughed, pulling her closer. "Relax, Olivia. We've got all the time in the world."
