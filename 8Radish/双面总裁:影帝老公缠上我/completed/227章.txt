What’s Going On?

While waiting for Michael Wright to report back, Isabella Peterson sat with an old, yellowed consent form, mentally reliving scenes from the past as she calculated the dates over and over. She couldn’t help but wonder why she believed Sophie Cook’s casual remark without even confirming it with Olivia Stewart. Given Sophie’s personality, it was likely she was stirring trouble on purpose, trying to drive a wedge between them.

A flash of regret crossed Isabella’s firm face, her jaw tightening as her handsome features became even more stern. Just then, Michael Wright entered the room. His eyes flicked to the paper in Isabella’s hand before he dropped to his knees with a thud, back ramrod straight, head bowed in silent submission.

“Got anything to say?” Isabella asked, her voice icy.

Michael glanced up at her, then quickly looked back down, mumbling a dry, “I’m sorry, sir.”

With a swift motion, Isabella grabbed a hefty book off the desk and hurled it at Michael. “What good is your sorry to me?” she shouted. Michael took the hit without flinching, staying silent and keeping his head low.

Isabella kicked him in frustration, looking down at him with a mix of anger and disappointment. “What did my mom use to threaten you?”

Michael’s eyes darted up, surprise mingling with a complex emotion. Isabella had used the word “threaten” instead of order or command—did that mean she still valued his integrity?

Michael, who had resigned himself to his fate, felt a flicker of hope. Isabella’s voice cut through his thoughts, demanding, “Speak!”

Michael suddenly bowed his head to the floor, confessing, “I’m sorry, sir. You asked me to investigate Olivia Stewart’s past, but your mother ordered me to erase all traces, so I didn’t do anything to harm Olivia. I just kept all the findings hidden. That was my mistake, but please, spare my family. They’re locked in the basement by your mother.”

So, it was his mother after all! Isabella clenched her fists, struggling to contain her anger, with a pained expression flashing in her eyes. Why did it have to be his own mother, the person he respected most, who targeted the woman he loved?

With a tense expression, Isabella asked, “Where’s the child? Whose is it?”

“Child?” Michael looked confused, stammering, “Sir, your mother only instructed me to hide your past relationship with Olivia. As for the child, I don’t know anything about that.”

Seeing Isabella’s cold demeanor, Michael quickly added, “I swear, sir, I’m not hiding anything else. Every word is true!”

It seemed Isabella would have to go back and ask his mother directly. Disappointment washed over him. “Was the development of Peach Blossom Town into a new economic zone a plan by the Peterson Group?” Isabella asked tiredly.

Michael nodded, “Yes.”

“Go back to where you came from,” Isabella said with exhaustion.

Michael hesitated, his face a mix of emotions. Without saying another word, he bowed deeply to Isabella three times before leaving. The rules of the Peterson Group were strict; betrayal was unforgivable. Letting him return home was already a mercy.

Isabella lingered in the study for a while longer, letting the smell of smoke dissipate before heading to her room. The soft moonlight streamed in through the window, casting a gentle glow over the room.

On the large, luxurious bed, a small, curled-up figure lay under the silky sheets. Isabella approached quietly, seeing Olivia Stewart nestled under the covers, her hair tousled, with just a hint of her serene face peeking out—a picture of peaceful slumber.

Isabella’s heart softened as she leaned in closer. Their breaths mingled in the stillness of the night. Just as Isabella was about to brush her lips against Olivia’s, Olivia’s eyes fluttered open, clear and bright as they stared up at him.

“You waiting for me?” Isabella asked, not at all embarrassed at being caught, leaning closer still.

Olivia leaned back, a flicker of hesitation in her eyes, which made Isabella pause, his expression darkening.

Olivia hugged the sheet to her, scooting back as she sat up, eyeing Isabella warily. Anger flared in Isabella’s eyes. “Olivia, what’s going on?”

As if things weren’t messy enough, what was she trying to do now?

“Isabella, I’m sorry, I…” Olivia bit her lip, struggling internally before blurting out with the determination of someone facing the gallows, “I might as well confess! You have a severe case of OCD, so it’s better you know now than be grossed out later!”

Olivia glanced at Isabella nervously, unsure of how he’d react. To her surprise, he remained calm, simply waiting for her to continue.

“Before I met you, I had a boyfriend,” Olivia admitted quietly, clutching the sheets tightly. “I needed money for my mom’s medical bills, so I agreed to your mom’s offer to be a rental girlfriend. Then we… At the hospital, Christopher Davis found me and humiliated me, and we broke up for good.”

She glanced at Isabella again, unnerved by his unusual calmness. Normally, he’d lose it if she even had lunch with Ethan King, yet now he was unfazed. Was this the calm before the storm?

She steeled herself, deciding to lay it all out. “Although I was dating Christopher, we never even held hands. But recently, I remembered being pregnant once, and I… I don’t know whose it was!”

Olivia’s face contorted with pain, but Isabella suddenly pulled her into a hug. She broke free, looking at him in shock. “You’re not angry?”

She had been ready to be thrown out, yet here he was, not angry at all. Isabella tapped her nose playfully. “Silly! It’s my kid; why would I be mad?”

“But…” Olivia started, remembering Sophie’s words.

Isabella silenced her, pulling her close. “Enough thinking. Sleep!”

But Olivia was stubborn, needing answers before she could rest. She looked at him with hopeful eyes. “Did you investigate? Is it true? Where is the child now?”

The thought of that old abortion consent form darkened Isabella’s eyes. “I’m still looking into it. Back then, you were just a college kid. The baby might have…” He trailed off, preparing her for the worst.

Olivia nodded, “It was such a wild time. I still can’t believe I couldn’t say no to you that night.”

Isabella wasn’t thrilled by her words. “It’s because I was too charming for you to resist,” he said, his usual arrogance slipping through.

Olivia rolled her eyes internally. Sure, now he was irresistible, but back then, he had been more like a sick puppy anyone would want to take care of. But she wisely kept that thought to herself, not wanting to spark a morning argument.

“Enough,” Isabella coaxed, “sleep now.” He ruffled her hair gently, his voice softening.

Relieved, Olivia let out a breath. “As long as it’s yours, I’ll be fine. But why can’t I remember what happened? Do you think I was hypnotized?”

A cold gleam appeared in Isabella’s eyes, the temperature in the room dropping noticeably. Exhausted, Olivia snuggled against his arm, falling into a deep sleep, leaving him to ponder her unsettling question.

A soft knock at the door broke the silence. Only an urgent matter would bring Lucas Wright to disturb them at this hour. Isabella carefully shifted away from Olivia, ensuring she remained undisturbed, and went to see Lucas.

“Sir, your father called. He wants you back immediately,” Lucas reported, standing respectfully.

Isabella’s gaze turned frosty. It was typical of his father to disregard time differences, calling whenever he pleased. The issue must have been about using the Peterson Group’s medical team, which meant they knew about Olivia too.

“Book a flight for the morning,” Isabella instructed. After a pause, he added, “Make arrangements with the film crew. Olivia comes with us.”

Lucas hesitated, concern etching his features. “Isn’t it a bit early to bring Olivia to the family estate?”
