Three days flew by, and the final selection day was finally here. Sophie Cook, along with nine other contestants, was ushered into a photography studio for the last round of auditions. Dressed in an elegant cream-colored dress, Sophie looked as radiant as ever, her skin glowing like fresh snow.

As the other girls huddled together, discussing the script with nervous excitement, Sophie sat alone, her aloof gaze fixed on them with a hint of disdain. Her lips curled into a subtle smirk. "Hmph! These fools," she thought. "No matter how well they perform, nothing beats having the right connections."

One girl, feeling the heat of Sophie’s stare, muttered under her breath, "Who does she think she is? Walking around like she already has the lead role in the bag!"

Her friend nudged her, "Oh, come on, ignore her. She's just a backup; she's only here for the ride."

Sophie wasn't one to let it slide. She sauntered over and slapped the girl, chin held high. "Who’s just here for the ride?"

"You, obviously!" The girl shot back, her cheeks flushed with anger. A scuffle almost broke out, but the others quickly intervened, pulling them apart.

"Hey, cut it out! I've heard the studio is super strict. If we mess around, we're all getting disqualified!" someone warned, causing the group to scatter, leaving Sophie standing in the middle, unfazed.

Sophie tilted her head, maintaining a haughty expression that shattered the sweet, innocent image she tried to project. "You think you can compare to me?" she scoffed internally. In acting, Sophie knew she had talent and confidence to match. Plus, she had Olivia Stewart pulling strings for her, and she herself had cozied up to the director and producer. The lead role was practically hers.

As the auditions began, the others were a bundle of nerves, but Sophie remained composed, sipping her coffee leisurely. Her confidence was unshakable.

Suddenly, she spotted a familiar figure at the door—Olivia Stewart. Olivia gave her an encouraging thumbs-up, and Sophie returned it with a victory sign. It was one of those rare moments of understanding between them, a sisterly bond rekindling.

Finally, it was Sophie’s turn. She followed the staff into the setup, which was designed to look like a café. Her role was to portray a girl struggling to pay for her mother's medical expenses, meeting the male lead's mother who then offers her a deal to be a rented girlfriend.

Sophie slipped into character effortlessly, her expressions natural, her performance convincing. The director, Mr. Wang, nodded approvingly from the observation room. "This girl has potential. She's only a freshman but already shows promise as an actress."

Isabella Peterson, sitting in a large chair with oversized sunglasses obscuring most of their face, seemed pleased as well, indicated by the slight upward curve of their lips. However, Isabella's mind was elsewhere, reminiscing about Olivia Stewart’s request the previous night.

As Sophie neared the end of her scene, she was supposed to tearfully accept a check from the male lead’s mother. But the moment she glanced at the check, her eyes lit up, and she blurted out, "So much money! All for me?"

Her face screamed one thing: greed.

The actress opposite her chuckled and gently reminded her, "It’s just acting, darling!"

Sophie snapped back to reality, her face flushed with embarrassment as laughter filled the room.

In the observation room, Mr. Wang shook his head. "What a shame. A girl like that can't possibly play the lead in our new drama."

Isabella sighed, noting the difference between Sophie and Olivia. Despite their similar looks, their inner nature was worlds apart.

After a moment of contemplation, Isabella instructed, "Give her another try with a different scene."

Mr. Wang quickly relayed the order, and Sophie was given a second chance, this time playing a nurse caring for the male lead.

As Sophie rushed to prepare, her time was running short, and she was frantic. She pulled Olivia aside. "Sis, I need to play a nurse next. You studied that, right? Help me out!"

"Sure thing! Come on." Olivia grabbed a chair and had Sophie sit down. "Now, you’re the patient, and I’m the nurse. Watch carefully."

Upstairs, Isabella watched the remaining contestants with growing disinterest. Though they all fit the image of the drama's lead, none possessed a certain something—a genuine kindness and calmness—that the role required.

Feeling restless, Isabella wandered to the window and caught sight of Olivia practicing with Sophie. The sight took Isabella back five years.

Mr. Wang joined Isabella by the window and remarked, "That girl is quite good. Why isn't she auditioning?"

A light bulb went off in Isabella's mind. Of course, Olivia should play the lead! The drama was designed to awaken her memories and help her heal. It would be perfect for her to relive those moments.

Isabella's fingers trembled slightly as they adjusted their sunglasses. "Bring her in for an audition."

"The girl playing the nurse?" Mr. Wang asked, then quickly agreed when he sensed the change in atmosphere. "Right away!"

Isabella settled back into the chair, sipping coffee with a satisfied smile. "Show me what you've got, Olivia."

Downstairs, Olivia finished demonstrating to Sophie. "Now, it's your turn to be the nurse."

"Alright," Sophie said, fumbling with the thermometer.

Olivia shook her head fondly and corrected her. "The metal end goes under the arm."

"Oh, right! I forgot. Where did I put it?" Sophie said, flustered, as she searched the tray.

Olivia chuckled, "You already put it under my arm. Just flip it around."

"Right, right!" Sophie said, switching the thermometer clumsily.

As they practiced, a staff member entered with a nurse's uniform in hand. "Olivia Stewart, please come with me."

Sophie stood, ready to take the uniform, but the staff member stepped back apologetically. "Sorry, this is for Olivia Stewart."

Sophie’s face fell, and Olivia looked puzzled. "Are you sure? Isn’t there a mistake?"
