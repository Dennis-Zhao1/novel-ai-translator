Olivia Stewart was dealing with depression. The moment Isabella Peterson heard those words, it felt like she'd been stung by a wasp. How could Olivia be suffering from depression? It didn't make sense.

Isabella, eyes ablaze with anger, grabbed the doctor's collar. "Explain this to me!"

The doctor trembled, avoiding Isabella's fierce gaze as he stammered out his explanation. "A while back, Olivia came to me asking for some sedatives. I thought she was just having trouble sleeping, so I didn't think much of it. Then, a few days later, she asked for an entire bottle, saying it was inconvenient to keep coming back. I warned her to be careful with the dosage, but she finished the whole bottle quickly and came back for more. At that point, I refused to give her any more."

Isabella's grip tightened as she yelled, "Why didn't you tell me something so important?"

The doctor blushed, shaking even more. "Olivia told me not to tell you. She said if I did, she’d fire me."

Isabella seethed, but her anger was mixed with worry as she looked around. "Where is he?"

No one dared to answer. The household staff all kept their heads low, wishing they could disappear.

Lucas Wright stepped forward cautiously. "Tulip almost threw little Gigi into the pond earlier. Olivia was furious and slapped him, and then he ran off. I've already sent people to find him."

Isabella's fists clenched tightly. No wonder Olivia fainted from anger!

"Send more people to find that boy! And as for the staff supposed to be watching Gigi..." Isabella's voice was icy. "Handle it as you see fit."

The nanny responsible for Gigi fell to her knees, trembling. She had been distracted, gossiping in the hall, and hadn't watched Gigi. Thankfully, the little girl was okay; otherwise, she knew she couldn't make amends.

Ignoring the nanny, Isabella turned her attention to Olivia, who lay pale and unconscious. Her expression softened slightly. "Why isn't she waking up? Get that useless doctor back here!"

Lucas quickly sent someone to fetch the doctor. While they waited, he quietly told Isabella about the shocking revelation from a recent DNA test.

"What did you say? Grace Martin is Olivia's biological mother? And she was swapped at birth by her adoptive mother?" Isabella's eyebrows shot up in disbelief.

The weight of it all—Olivia's adoptive parents using her, her real parents plotting against her—was too much. It was no wonder she was depressed.

Isabella hugged Olivia tightly, guilt washing over him. "Olivia, it's my fault. I didn't protect you."

Thinking about how Olivia had struggled with depression before, Isabella felt a pang of fear. He instinctively tightened his embrace.

Suddenly, Olivia let out a faint whimper, and Isabella's heart leapt with hope. "Olivia, you're awake?"

Olivia opened her eyes, blinking blankly. Her expression was innocent and cute, not at all what Isabella expected from someone who’d been through so much.

A sense of dread filled Isabella as he gently called her name. "Olivia, don't scare me."

Olivia looked at Isabella, her big eyes still filled with confusion. She seemed to see him, yet her gaze was distant.

"Olivia!" Isabella held her face, trying to make her focus on him. "It's me, Isabella!"

But Olivia's face remained expressionless.

Isabella let go, feeling defeated. How had she become like this? Was her depression back? Why did she forget him?

He wanted to punch the nearby sofa in frustration but refrained, worried he might scare her.

The doctor hurried over, taking in the scene and sighing. "We should get her to the hospital."

Soon, Olivia was in the best psychiatric clinic in Gold City, where the most renowned therapist awaited her.

Isabella accompanied Olivia into the consultation room, where she sat quietly, behaving like a doll.

The therapist tried various methods—asking questions, showing pictures, playing music. But Olivia remained unresponsive, like a ghost detached from the world.

Isabella watched helplessly as the expert finally spoke. "Her symptoms are typical of someone retreating into themselves after a severe shock. She's protecting herself by not engaging with the outside world."

Isabella's heart sank. "Is there anything we can do? Money, resources, anything—I’ll provide it."

The therapist shook his head. "It's not about money. It's about time. Only a safe and stress-free environment, with someone she trusts completely, might help her come back to us."

"What if she never comes back?" Isabella's voice trembled.

The therapist didn't answer, but the implication was clear.

Isabella's mind raced. Could he be the person Olivia needed? He asked the therapist, "How do I know if I'm the right person to help her?"

The therapist replied carefully, "We'll need to go through everything about her to find out what affects her. Then we can see how she responds and make a judgment."

"Okay," Isabella agreed, immediately writing down Olivia's experiences, including his own doubts about Tulip and Olivia's family history.

The therapist reviewed the notes, impressed by Isabella's honesty about the complicated family dynamics. "Rest assured, everything will be kept confidential."

Isabella waved it off. "Just find the right person to help her."

The therapist considered. "Besides you, is there anyone else Olivia might trust?"

Isabella thought for a moment and wrote down two names: Ethan King and Alexander Peterson.

Yes, he even included Alexander Peterson, Olivia's first love, despite their complicated past. If Alexander could be the one to help Olivia, Isabella was willing to track him down.

The therapist soon organized the notes and led them to another room. Isabella held Olivia's hand gently. "Olivia, let's go see another room, okay?"

Olivia remained unresponsive, trailing along like a puppet.

The therapist took them to a room with high-tech recording equipment, explaining that it was to capture subtle reactions from patients.

Isabella frowned, but the therapist reassured him, "This helps us understand their mental state."

With that, Isabella led Olivia inside, asking, "She just sits here?"

"Yes," the therapist replied. "And she needs to be alone."

Isabella hesitated but nodded, stepping back to let the process begin.
