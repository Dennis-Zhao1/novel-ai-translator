Chapter 1: The Unlikely Star

Scene shift: We're in the cozy corner of a bustling coffee shop. Olivia Stewart, still in her pink nurse's uniform, didn't even have time to change before arriving here. The background music is playing something melancholic, a tune that seems to whisper its own story. 

Though Olivia's acting experience is virtually non-existent, her sensitivity to music is profound. The soft strains tug at her emotions, reminding her of when her mother was gravely ill. Tears threaten to spill from her eyes, but she stubbornly holds them back.

"Perfect!" Director Wang can't help but clap as he watches Olivia's tear-filled eyes through the camera lens. Realizing he's next to the intimidating executive producer, he quickly retracts his enthusiasm.

The scene unfolds with the male lead's mother sliding a check across the table to Olivia. "Agree to be my son's girlfriend, and this money will save your mother," she proposes.

"No, I won't sell my love!" Olivia blurts out, pushing the check back. Then, hesitating, she pulls it back with a pained expression. "But I can't lose my mother either!"

"Cut!" The assistant director calls it. The scene ends.

The actress playing opposite Olivia pats her on the shoulder. "Not bad, kid! Your natural expressions are spot-on, even better than some seasoned actors."

Olivia stands there, stunned, forgetting to even say thank you.

The assistant director chuckles, "Look at her, so thrilled she's speechless!"

Suddenly, a deep, authoritative voice booms through the studio speakers, "The lead actress for the new show is her!"

"Did you hear that, Olivia? You've been chosen as the lead! Our boss just announced it!" The assistant director, a burly man nearing forty with a scruffy beard, bounces excitedly in front of her like a kid.

Olivia takes a step back, trying to process what's happening. She forces a smile, "Thank you! Thank you all!"

The assistant director looks at her incredulously, "You're not happy? Excited? Thrilled?"

Well, she is surprised, but as for joy…

Olivia shifts uncomfortably, avoiding his gaze, "Sorry, I just need a moment."

"Take your time, just don't go zoning out!" 

Olivia slumps into a chair, pressing her fingertips to her forehead, trying to make sense of it all. During the scene, she had brief flashes, like she had lived that moment before. The words, actions, and emotions flowed naturally from her.

She tries to remember more, but the images were fleeting, impossible to grasp. And then, the assistant director's interruption snapped her out of it. 

Ugh, that chatterbox!

After a futile struggle with her thoughts, Olivia gives up, lightly slapping her forehead. Maybe it was just first-time nerves, filling in too many blanks with her imagination.

"Feeling better?" The assistant director grins at her. "If you're ready, you need to head upstairs to sign the contract."

Olivia blinks, "Sign what?"

"The contract, of course! You didn't hear? You've been cast as the lead! You seemed sharp, but you’re not catching on. I'm worried for you!"

The assistant director paces back and forth, his beard wagging with impatience.

Olivia still feels like she's walking on clouds. "The lead? But I don't know anything about acting. Why me?"

She's never even been in a school play, but now she's the lead? Did the directors lose their minds?

"You're not completely clueless! Don't underestimate yourself!" The assistant director shifts to a more serious tone. "Sure, your acting can't match seasoned actors, but you've got something they don't—a unique aura."

"…"

"Your look and demeanor fit our new show perfectly. It's basically typecasting, so don't worry. The company will probably send you for some acting training, so you’ll be fine!"

Olivia feels a bit swayed. Who wouldn't want to be a star? Especially if it means working alongside the renowned actor, Liam Drake.

But if she takes the lead role, what about her sister, Sophie Cook? And how would her boyfriend, Alex, react to her being in the spotlight?

Caught in a whirlwind of doubts, Olivia twists her clothes anxiously.

The assistant director, misinterpreting her hesitation, raises his voice, "What? You're not interested? Many would kill for this chance! Others would be over the moon, while you're here sulking."

"No, I know it's a unique opportunity. I just…"

Olivia bites her lip, struggling to explain.

"Alright, you were picked by the boss himself. Let's go upstairs and see him. You can discuss any concerns directly with him."

The assistant director adds, "Our boss never handpicks anyone. You should feel lucky!"

With no other choice, Olivia follows him upstairs. The short walk feels like a marathon, each step heavy with the weight of her decision. 

In those brief moments, she makes an important choice, one that leaves her uneasy.

They reach the VIP room, where the assistant director knocks politely. "Tap, tap…"

Director Wang opens the door, stepping aside to let them in.

"Come in! The boss had to leave for other matters."

"The boss left?" The assistant director relaxes visibly, stealing a glance inside before inviting Olivia in. "This is our head director, Wang."

"Hello, Director Wang."

"Nice to meet you, Olivia."

After the introductions, Olivia sits down, feeling awkward.

Director Wang slides a contract across the table, his tone formal, "This is the contract for our new show. Review it and, if everything's okay, sign it. If you have any requests, feel free to ask. We'll accommodate as much as possible."

Olivia clenches and unclenches her fists, struggling with her decision. Finally, she speaks, "Can I give this opportunity to my sister?"

"Your sister?"

"Yes, contestant number nine, Sophie Cook!" Olivia insists. "She's studying acting, looks the part, and I can teach her any medical knowledge she needs!"

"You're quite a generous sister, willing to give up a chance like this."

Director Wang regards Olivia with a curious gaze. The boss had a good eye for talent, indeed.

Olivia smiles faintly, staring at her shoes, "I've always looked out for her. It's a habit."

Her voice carries a hint of bitterness.

"Are you sure you want to give it up?"

"I'm sure!" Olivia decides firmly.

"In that case, I regret to inform you that both you and your sister are out." Director Wang pauses Olivia with a gesture.

"What?"

Olivia's head snaps up.

The assistant director looks nervously at Wang, whispering, "She's the boss's choice. Are you sure about this?"

Wang gives him a sidelong glance, "It's the boss's order."

"Well, if that's the case, I have nothing more to add," the assistant director sighs dramatically.

Olivia pleads, "Directors, I don't mind being out, but can't you give my sister a chance? Being a star is her lifelong dream!"

"Is that so?"

Wang perches on a stool, exuding an air of superiority as he scrutinizes Olivia.

"We were considering giving her a minor role, like a maid, since she's just a freshman. It's still a chance to appear on screen. Our productions are always hits, even small roles can lead to fame. But you seem uninterested, so we can't help but cut ties with her too. Imagine how she'd feel knowing you jeopardized her career?" Wang suggests slyly.

"I'll sign!"

Olivia blurts out, grabbing the pen and signing the contract without reading it.

Sophie loves acting; she can't ruin her sister's dreams!

Her mother’s dying wish was for her to take care of Sophie, and she can't let her mother down or let Sophie resent her.

Watching Olivia hurriedly sign, Director Wang muses, "The boss sure knows how to play his cards. Look at her, so desperate to sign, as if we might change our minds if she delayed!"
