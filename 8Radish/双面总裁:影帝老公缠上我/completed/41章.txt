Olivia Stewart carried a tray of dessert as she rode the elevator to the top floor of the castle. The sweet aroma wafted around her, teasing her senses, and she had to resist the urge to snag a bite. After all, she was on a mission of apology, and sincerity was key, especially when dealing with Isabella Peterson, her boss and someone she couldn't afford to upset.

The castle's rooftop was spacious, divided into different sections by lush vines and potted plants. There were coffee tables, lounge chairs, and even a massive aquarium. The night breeze brought with it a refreshing scent, a mix of flowers and grass, soothing and invigorating.

Isabella Peterson stood by a coffee table, casually leaning against a white lounge chair. The breeze tousled his short hair, adding a touch of allure to his otherwise lonely silhouette. Olivia approached quietly, setting the dessert down beside him.

"Uh, you didn't eat enough tonight, right? The housekeeper asked me to bring you some dessert," she offered tentatively.

Isabella didn't turn around; his stance remained unchanged. This guy, with his fragile ego and petty nature! Olivia took a small step closer. "Isabella..."

Suddenly, he turned, and she almost bumped into his chest, quickly stepping back. He looked at her, a mix of irritation in his eyes.

"If you're here to appease me, why act like I'm going to eat you alive?"

"I just... It's instinct to avoid a collision," Olivia stammered.

He raised an eyebrow, a hint of smugness in his voice. "I'll give you a chance to correct that."

Yeah right, like throwing herself at him would help. Olivia's eyes darted around before she quickly offered, "Here, have some dessert. It won't taste as good once it cools."

Isabella remained motionless, a sarcastic smile tugging at his lips. "You're trying hard to win me over. Is it so I'll let you help that fussy guy?"

Olivia paused, putting down the spoon. "Isabella, I'm sorry for misunderstanding you."

"Sorry?" His finger lightly tapped her chest. "Where's the sincerity?"

"I mean, isn't bringing you dessert a gesture of sincerity?" she said, flashing an ingratiating smile.

Glancing at the dessert, Isabella's gaze returned to Olivia's face, his eyes deep and intense. "Honestly, I'd prefer you to be my dessert."

Olivia's jaw dropped. "You... You're incorrigible, Isabella!"

She clenched her fists, cheeks flushing. "Were you a wolf in a past life?"

Isabella's eyes darkened with amusement as he watched her pout. This little firecracker was infuriatingly charming. Olivia quickly covered her mouth, wary of his intentions.

He chuckled silently, settling into the chair, long legs crossed, exuding an effortless allure. "Don't forget, you still owe me one hundred and ninety-nine kisses."

"Can we please not keep bringing that up?" Olivia groaned, exasperated.

Reading her mind, Isabella added, "Of course, I wouldn't mind if you decided to convert them."

"Convert them how?" Olivia asked, a glimmer of hope in her voice.

"Into a little... bedtime fun," he suggested, feigning generosity.

Olivia's face turned crimson. "Yeah, no thanks. I'll keep the debt."

She turned to leave, muttering apologies and leaving him to count stars alone. But as she moved, Isabella's foot caught hers, sending her tumbling into his arms.

"This time, you came to me," he smirked, capturing her lips with a kiss that was commanding and unyielding. Olivia's resistance crumbled as she melted against him, her heart racing.

"Isabella," she gasped between breaths, "could you please stop doing this?"

"Doing what?" he asked, feigning innocence.

"You know exactly what!" She huffed, punching his chest lightly.

He laughed softly, teasingly. "You're adorable when you're shy."

His voice low and intimate, he blew a breath near her ear, causing her to shiver. "Besides, you clearly enjoy it."

"You wish," she retorted reflexively.

"Oh, I do enjoy it. Very much," he admitted unabashedly.

Blushing, Olivia struggled to pull away, but he gently held her chin, directing her gaze upwards. "Look."

Her eyes widened at the sight of the starry sky. "Wow, it's beautiful!"

She hadn't expected such a breathtaking view in the city. Isabella wrapped an arm around her, his voice wistful. "Do you remember how we used to watch the stars together?"

Olivia froze. He was reminiscing about someone else—the woman named White Echo. She knew the name but not the person.

"It was summer then, the stars bright and clear, just like now. I chose this spot for the castle because it's the best place in the city to see stars."

Olivia stayed silent, her heart a mix of jealousy and contentment. Right now, sharing this moment with him, that was her.

As Isabella reminisced about a place called Peach Blossom Town, a memory sparked in Olivia. She grew up there, but no one named White Echo existed among her peers. Could she possibly be this White Echo? It seemed absurd.

Lost in thought, she flinched when Isabella flicked her forehead. "Ow!"

"Thinking about another man?" he teased.

"You..." she began, exasperated.

"Thought so," he smirked.

Olivia rolled her eyes. This guy was impossible. He poked her side playfully, causing her to squirm. "What's your deal?"

"Didn't you say you were thinking about me? Show me," he challenged.

"Ugh, can we just enjoy the stars?" she sighed, pointing upwards. "Look, a shooting star!"

Isabella followed her finger, but there was nothing. "Very clever, Olivia," he said, seeing through her trick yet finding her sparkling eyes enchanting.

"Who says I didn't see a shooting star?" he countered.

"Huh?"

"In your eyes," he replied smoothly.

Her eyes sparkled, touched by his unique compliment. Blushing slightly, she closed her eyes, savoring the gentle kiss he placed on her eyelids—a pure, tender gesture that sent tingles through her.

This man, like an addictive drug, was breaking down her defenses. She felt a warmth spread through her as Isabella continued to kiss her softly, his voice a gentle murmur in the night. "With such a beautiful view, shouldn't we do something special?"

Olivia leaned into him, feeling a sense of peace despite the bittersweet memories. For now, this moment was theirs.
