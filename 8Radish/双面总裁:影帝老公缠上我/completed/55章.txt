Olivia Stewart wasn't feeling too great. Out of nowhere, Isabella Peterson enveloped her in a fierce hug, like she wanted to merge Olivia into her very being. It was so tight that Olivia could hardly breathe, her face squished against Isabella's chest. Olivia could hear Isabella's heart pounding like a drum, and she wondered if Isabella was trembling a bit. Was Isabella scared? Afraid of losing her?

Olivia felt a sudden wave of emotion swell inside her, and she wrapped her arms around Isabella's waist. It was the first time she had embraced someone so passionately in front of others. Isabella gently brushed Olivia's hair, her fingers weaving through the strands before pulling Olivia in for another kiss. It was deep and consuming, and though Olivia felt shy, she responded with equal warmth.

From the moment Isabella reached out to her, Olivia had been captivated, unable to resist. The staff, sensing the intimacy of the moment, discreetly turned away, leaving the pair to their privacy. When they finally pulled apart, Olivia was breathless, her eyes dreamy, and her body felt like jelly.

Without hesitation, Isabella scooped Olivia into her arms and strode into the castle. Olivia clung to Isabella's shirt, burying her flushed face into Isabella's chest, too embarrassed to meet anyone's eyes. Her clothes were soaked with cold sweat from the earlier scare.

Isabella carried her to an upstairs bathroom, where the staff had prepared a warm bath. Testing the water, Isabella gently lowered Olivia in, and her thin clothes clung to her skin as they got wet. Isabella's eyes darkened with a mix of emotions, and he leaned down, nuzzling her nose with his.

"Need a hand?" Isabella asked with a teasing smile.

Olivia shrank back, crossing her arms protectively over her chest. "You should go clean up too! As if you could stand being dirty for this long!"

She remembered how once, she'd barely touched his suit, and he'd had a bodyguard clean it with a white cloth. Isabella read the resistance in Olivia's eyes and nodded. "Alright, I'll check on you later."

After a relaxing bath, Olivia felt refreshed. She slipped into a pink silk nightgown and dried her hair. Alisa, one of the staff, offered to help dry her hair, to which Olivia agreed with a grateful smile.

"You're so lucky, Olivia," Alisa remarked as she worked. "The young master is really good to you."

"You'll find someone good too, Alisa," Olivia replied sincerely.

Alisa looked down, a bit embarrassed. "I'm just a servant. Who would want me?"

Olivia saw the flicker of hope in Alisa's eyes and felt a pang of guilt. She knew about Alisa's feelings for Isabella and had once used them to call for help. Now, she was caught in her own feelings and couldn't say much.

Alisa, meanwhile, was becoming more resentful. Why should Olivia get all the attention while she had to serve her? If Olivia hadn't shown up, Isabella might still be hers to pursue.

As Alisa's thoughts grew darker, her hand slipped, pulling Olivia's hair. "Ouch!"

"I'm so sorry, Olivia!" Alisa apologized quickly. Olivia waved it off, telling her to be more careful next time.

When a knock came at the door, Olivia saw Isabella, looking effortlessly handsome in a light grey robe. His hair was damp, and he leaned casually against the doorframe, exuding charm.

"Isabella," Olivia started, but Alisa interrupted with a polite greeting, clearly flustered.

"Out," Isabella commanded, and Alisa left, looking like she might cry.

"Don't be so cold, Isabella," Olivia teased. "I think Alisa likes you."

"You're not jealous?" Isabella raised an eyebrow.

"Why would I be? It's not me she likes," Olivia shrugged.

"Not even a little? Maybe I'll have her keep me company tonight."

"No!" Olivia blurted out, and Isabella chuckled, seeing through her.

Outside, Alisa clenched her fists in frustration, overhearing the conversation. "Olivia Stewart, you wicked woman!"

Lucas Wright, another staff member, caught Alisa eavesdropping. "Alisa, what are you doing here?"

Alisa stood straight, flustered. "I was just... avoiding being in the room with the young master and Olivia Stewart."

"Be more careful next time," Lucas advised, understanding too well the temptation to eavesdrop.

He listened at the door briefly, then knocked. "The late-night snack is ready, Mr. Peterson, Olivia."

"Coming," Isabella answered, and soon he emerged, arm around Olivia, looking at her with such tenderness it was almost tangible.

"You drank a lot at dinner. Come eat something," Isabella suggested.

"Okay," Olivia agreed, leaning into Isabella like a content cat.

"Are you hungry?" he asked.

"Yeah."

"I'll feed you," he teased.

"What?"

Isabella laughed, tapping her nose playfully. "Silly, don't say you're hungry in front of other men."

"You're terrible, Isabella!" Olivia retorted with a playful pout.

As they descended the stairs, Alisa watched them with a mix of jealousy and determination. She couldn't let Olivia win. 

Meanwhile, Olivia stopped, feeling something itchy at her neck. Isabella noticed her discomfort. "What's wrong?"

"This dress feels uncomfortable."

"Want me to help take it off?"

"Go away!"

Olivia went back to her room to change and found Alisa rummaging through her wardrobe. "Alisa!"

"Oh, Olivia, you're back already?" Alisa said, hiding something behind her.

Olivia didn't notice, distracted by her itch. "This dress is uncomfortable. Can you get me another?"

After changing, Olivia rejoined Isabella but found the itch spreading. She tried to act normal, but it was a struggle.

"Is everything alright?" Isabella asked, concerned.

"Yeah, I'm fine," Olivia lied, determined to endure until the end of their late-night snack.

The meal was torture, and Olivia felt like ants were crawling all over her. She couldn't scratch without drawing attention.

"Iâ€™m done, Isabella. Enjoy your meal," she said, trying to leave.

"You ate fast. You must have been hungry," Isabella noted.

"Uh, yes, and tired. I'm heading to bed."

"After that scare today, won't you have nightmares?"

"No, I'm tougher than that," Olivia insisted, eager to escape.

As she hurried off, Isabella called out, "Want me to keep you company?"

"Why would I want that?" Olivia replied, rolling her eyes before dashing away like a mischievous sprite.
