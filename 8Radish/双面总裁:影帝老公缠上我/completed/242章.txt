Isabella Peterson's Secret

Isabella Peterson furrowed her brows, her voice sharp, "What kind of medicine is this?"

"I-I'm sorry! M-Miss!"

The young maid trembled in fear under Isabella's intense glare, her face flushing with embarrassment. Many house staff admired the gentle and refined Alexander Peterson, but she found herself drawn to the more rugged and serious Isabella.

Her heart had been stolen long ago. So, when Isabella angrily knocked over the glass of milk, she panicked and accidentally spilled the beans on a huge secret!

But as soon as the words escaped her lips, she regretted it deeply.

Breaking the Peterson family rules could have dire consequences, ones she couldn't afford to face!

Isabella's eyes were as cold as ice as she stared at the maid huddled at her feet. "What illness is it treating? Speak!"

"It's... it's..." The maid stole a quick glance at Isabella before dropping her gaze again. "Miss, please forgive me, I can't say! It's for your own good! Your mother insisted you take it, she wouldn't harm you, right?"

Wouldn't she, though?

Who was it that tore her away from Olivia Stewart back then?

Isabella's leather shoe pressed down on the maid's hand, slowly grinding against it.

"Ah! M-Miss, please let go! I'll talk! I'll talk!"

The maid cried out in pain, her body trembling like a leaf.

Isabella lifted her foot slightly, allowing the maid to pull her hand away, taking a deep breath before bowing her head repeatedly. "Thank you, Miss!"

"The medicine... it's for treating infertility. Madam feared you wouldn't take it if you knew, so she's been secretly mixing it into your nightly milk."

A shadow passed over Isabella's face.

No wonder her mother insisted on this nightly milk ritual even after her surgery recovery!

Isabella's cold gaze bore into the young maid's face.

The maid shivered, quickly holding up two fingers, earnestly promising, "Miss, rest assured, I haven't told anyone about this! And I never will! I swear, if I lie, may I be struck down!"

The maid swore, tears streaming down her face as she looked at Isabella.

Isabella remained unmoved, tapping her fingers lightly on the table.

Her lips moved slightly, "How did you find out?"

Considering the Peterson family's pride, how could such an embarrassing matter be known to a maid?

The maid hung her head low. "I... I overheard Madam talking to Alexander Peterson about it once."

"Alexander Peterson?"

"Yes, it was him who gave your medical records to your parents. Since he's a doctor, Madam asked him to secretly prepare the medicine for you."

Alexander Peterson, dreaming of taking over the family, would he be so kind-hearted?

Isabella clenched her fists tightly.

"Bring me the pills!"

The maid hesitated, "The pills are with Madam. She always mixes them into the milk before giving it to me. It'd be difficult to get them!"

Isabella rubbed her temples, her voice cold, "You may go now."

The maid hastily gathered the tray, bowing as she retreated.

After a few steps, she turned back. "Miss, please wait a few minutes. I spilled your milk, so I'll get another glass. Alexander Peterson insisted the medicine must be taken on time. You can't miss a single day now that you're back!"

Isabella's eyes flickered, "Fine, bring it over."

The maid hurried off to find Mrs. Peterson, but the lights in her room were already off. Not daring to disturb her, the maid feared Mrs. Peterson's wrath for spilling the milk, so she headed to Alexander Peterson's quarters.

"Alexander, can you help me?"

Alexander adjusted his glasses, seeing the young maid from Isabella’s side, a gentle smile playing on his lips, "What's the matter? Did Isabella bully you and you want me to stand up for you?"

"Of course not!" The maid stomped her foot in embarrassment. "I just spilled Isabella's milk. Mrs. Peterson is asleep, so I came to ask if you could give me more of that medicine, or else I'll get scolded!"

Alexander, always kind to others, listened to her request without hesitation.

His eyes darkened momentarily before regaining their warmth. "Wait a moment."

A few minutes later, Alexander handed the maid a glass of milk, his tone gentle, "Take this to your Miss."

"Thank you, Alexander!"

Relieved, the maid hurried away with the milk.

"Hey, Alexander..."

Olivia Stewart walked in, nearly colliding with the maid who was rushing out.

"Ah!"

Olivia yelped as she stumbled backward.

"Olivia!"

The maid reached out to steady her, inadvertently spilling the milk and shattering the glass beside Olivia.

"Olivia!"

Alexander rushed over, pulling Olivia away swiftly.

"How careless can you be?" Alexander scolded the maid sharply.

"I'm sorry, Alexander, Olivia, I didn't mean to!"

Ignoring the cuts on her hand, the maid frantically cleaned up the shattered glass.

"It's not your fault, I wasn't watching where I was going," Olivia said, releasing Alexander's hand to help clean up the fragments.

"No need, Olivia!"

Startled by her kindness, the maid tried to stop Olivia, inadvertently pressing her hand onto a shard.

"Smack!"

Alexander slapped the maid without hesitation. "Get out!"

Who said Alexander was always gentle?

The maid held her cheek, not daring to utter a word, and hurried away without finishing the cleanup.

Olivia stared at Alexander in surprise. "I always thought you were the gentle type. Didn't expect you to have such a fierce side."

Alexander looked a bit embarrassed. "Seeing you hurt, I just got worried."

Olivia averted her eyes, pretending not to notice his gaze.

The past was gone, and except for Isabella, no one else could occupy her heart.

But had Isabella already given up on her?

Thinking of the man she both loved and resented, Olivia felt a pang of heartache, silently cleaning up the milk and glass shards.

"Wait, are you sick?"

Olivia suddenly wrinkled her nose, surprised.

Alexander's eyes flickered.

He awkwardly adjusted his glasses, smiling, "No, I'm perfectly healthy."

"But I smell medicine in here!" Olivia sniffed the air again, nodding confidently. "Yeah, there's definitely medicine in this milk, and quite a bit!"

Alexander felt a chill run down his spine.

Isabella rarely stayed at the estate, and he had been looking for a chance to increase the dosage. Tonight, the maid came asking, so he added more than usual. He hadn't expected Olivia to notice!

"Olivia, did you study pharmacology? I remember you were in the nursing program?"

"Yes!" Olivia replied, a bit sheepishly. "To save money, I worked in the pharmacology lab during my first year, got pretty familiar with the smells."

"Can you tell what kind of medicine it is?"

Alexander looked at her, like a senior quizzing a junior.

Olivia laughed, "I'm not that skilled! The smell is usually faint, mixed in milk, it's hard to detect. I only noticed because of the extra dose and my sharp nose."

Alexander secretly sighed with relief.

But then—

"Hey, Alexander, why are you being so secretive about medicine? You don't have some embarrassing condition, do you?"

Olivia teased, her eyes sparkling mischievously.

Despite the past with Christopher Davis, Alexander had helped her without taking advantage, earning her trust.

Olivia's casual remark hit Alexander like a bolt of lightning.

If Olivia thought he was... incompetent...

Alexander's dark eyes shifted, and he sighed.

"To be honest, someone in our family does have an embarrassing issue. But it's not me, it's..."

"Isabella?"

Olivia was taken aback, stepping back in disbelief.

"No... no way! How could that be?"

Seeing her shock, Alexander's jealousy flared, but he maintained a concerned façade.

"He doesn't like it mentioned, so don't bring it up with him."

Olivia shook her head, "No, it can't be. We... had a child together!"

"You mean the person you were involved with back then was Isabella?"

Alexander grabbed Olivia's shoulders, his gentle mask slipping.

Olivia stared at him, unfeeling the pain in her shoulders. "So, the person back then... was you?"
