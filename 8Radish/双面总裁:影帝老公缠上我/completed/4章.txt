You Just Really Don't Want To

"Aaah!" Olivia Stewart let out a scream as she plunged into the soft embrace of her comforter. She was about to roll away when Isabella Peterson was already on top of her, pinning her down with a surprising strength. Olivia's arms were held above her head, rendering her completely helpless.

"Isabella Peterson, are you serious?" Olivia exclaimed, eyes wide with shock.

Isabella's eyes were a dark, intense red, filled with an emotion that was both mysterious and overwhelming. Her voice was low and husky, making Olivia's heart race. "I've vowed for five years that the first thing I'd do when I saw you again was prove to you that I can, Olivia."

Olivia's mind was spinning. The proximity of Isabella's face made it hard to think straight. She felt herself being pulled into the depths of those eyes, like she was willingly drowning in a turbulent sea. She involuntarily closed her eyes.

"Olivia... Olivia..." Isabella's words seemed distant, almost like a melody she couldn't quite grasp.

Suddenly, Olivia snapped back to reality and her eyes flew open. Oh my gosh, was she seriously about to get swept away by this guy who kept calling out another woman's name? Nope, she wasn't that kind of girl. No matter how handsome he was, she had to get him to let her go.

Olivia licked her dry lips and carefully pushed at Isabella. "Uh, maybe you could move a little? I get it, you can do it, no need to prove anything."

What kind of logic was that? It sounded more like encouragement than reassurance. Her cheeks flushed a deep red as she sneaked a glance at Isabella.

That glance was all it took to ignite a spark. Isabella seized the moment and captured Olivia's lips in a sudden kiss.

The taste was sweet and faintly fragrant, familiar in a way that tugged at memories.

"Mmm... mmm..." Olivia struggled and protested, but Isabella's eyes were blazing with a storm.

Why didn't she understand? In the presence of a ravenous wolf, resistance was futile. Didn't she know she was only adding fuel to the fire?

Defeated, Olivia's face turned red from the lack of air. Isabella finally released her, his lips trailing gently across her brow and downwards, murmuring affectionately, "Olivia... Olivia..."

A sudden salty taste invaded the kiss. Isabella froze, lifting his gaze to her tear-streaked face, a flicker of fire in his eyes. "Do you really not want this?"

Barely able to see through her tear-blurred eyes, Olivia sighed, resigned. "I can't fight you off, so do what you want. But I have to remind you seriously—my name is Olivia Stewart, not this 'Olivia' you're calling."

It was like a bucket of ice water had been dumped over his head. Isabella felt the thrill vanish instantly. He stepped back, standing at the edge of the bed, looking down at her with a sarcastic smile. "It's only been a few years, and you've already forgotten me?"

Olivia sat up, wiping the tears away. "I never forgot because I never knew! If I'd met someone as unfairly handsome as you before, there's no way I could forget."

Isabella wanted to be angry, but looking at her earnest face, he only felt a tug at his heart—a mix of pain and longing.

"You're really not Olivia?"

"Absolutely not!"

Isabella scrutinized her face closely, searching for any hint of the "Olivia" he remembered. The same gentle features, the same clear eyes—but something was different.

The Olivia he remembered had eyes as pure as a mountain spring, gentle and untainted. But this girl's eyes, though seemingly soft, held a stubbornness and a hint of mischief, and when she looked at him, there was nothing but unfamiliarity.

Maybe she really wasn't Olivia.

Slowly, Isabella's eyes turned cold, like a layer of ice had settled over them. Disappointment crept through him, a thorny vine wrapping around his heart, squeezing the breath from his chest. The woman he'd spent five years searching for, the one he wanted to consume whole, wasn't her.

Isabella pressed a hand to his heart, stepping back with a wave of his hand. "Go."

Olivia couldn't believe her ears. She jumped up, ready to run. But when she saw Isabella's unsteady stance, she hesitated, concerned. "Hey, are you okay?"

How could he be okay? Her face made his heart race, but the unfamiliarity in her eyes tore at him.

"Pissed off" didn't begin to describe his feelings.

Isabella turned away, growling, "Before I change my mind, get out."

Olivia, feeling a surge of relief, quickly made her way out, taking care not to look back. Just as she reached the door, Isabella's voice stopped her again. "Wait!"

She nearly collided with the door, turning back with a nervous bite on her lip. "You promised to let me go!"

Isabella had intended to offer her financial compensation out of guilt but seeing her nervous habit renewed his determination. How could she not be Olivia?

Regret washed over him for letting her go so easily. He reached out to grab her.

Olivia jumped back, slapped his hand away, and dashed out, kicking the door shut behind her.

Isabella barely dodged in time, the door slamming into him with a force that left him seeing stars. His sharp features almost flattened, his nose stinging.

This girl...

He took a moment to recover, and when he did, Olivia was long gone.

Just as he was about to chase after her, his foot hit something—Olivia's bracelet, which had slipped off in their scuffle. Picking it up, he clenched it tightly, a cold smile playing on his lips.

You might think you can escape, Olivia, but if you've really forgotten me, I'll make sure you remember.

Isabella pocketed the bracelet and strode out.

Meanwhile, Olivia had run down three hallways before stopping to catch her breath, leaning against a corner wall. That was way too close, like something straight out of a movie!

The fact that Isabella hadn't chased after her was a relief. She glanced back nervously, relieved to see the empty hallway. If her lips weren't still swollen, she might have thought she'd imagined the whole thing.

Isabella was too used to getting anything he wanted, including women. She shook her head at her own paranoia.

Still, it was safer to leave before Group Peterson's bodyguards found her!

The best plan was to get out while she could.

Just as she turned, a hand in a floral shirt grabbed her.

"Jerk! Perv!" Olivia reacted instantly, swinging her fists wildly.

"Ouch, Olivia! Why are you hitting me?" came the familiar voice of Ethan King.

Recognizing the distinctively dramatic voice, Olivia paused her assault. "Ethan? Where were you?"

Ethan, rubbing his face, struck a dramatic pose. "I've told you, never hit the face. It's my moneymaker!"

Olivia fumed, "Where have you been?"

"I've been looking for you! And why aren't you dressed yet? Daniel Johnson's wedding is almost over..." Ethan's eyes widened at Olivia's swollen lips, his voice dropping to a masculine growl. "You got kissed? Are you still hung up on Daniel Johnson?"

"It wasn't him!"

"Another guy?" Ethan shrieked, "Olivia, are you serious? If you want to let loose, just tell me! You look like you've been—"

"I was almost attacked!"

Ethan froze, his voice trembling, "What... Olivia!"

Olivia rolled her eyes. "Kidding. Almost."

Ethan clutched his chest, returning to his usual dramatic flair. "Oh, Olivia, you naughty little thing!"

Then the realization hit him, his voice rising again. "Almost isn't okay! Who did it? I'll take care of him!"

Olivia quickly covered his mouth. "Quiet down! You're going to give me a heart attack. Let's go!"

She tugged Ethan along, but just then, several security guards appeared at the other end of the hallway.

Uh-oh!
