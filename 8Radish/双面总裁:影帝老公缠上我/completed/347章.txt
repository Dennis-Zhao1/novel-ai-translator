The Little Prince and the Little Princess

Olivia Stewart was entranced. The melody playing was the theme song she wrote for the movie "Send an Angel to Love You," which she starred in alongside Isabella Peterson. It was a song she had composed herself, titled "Secretly Falling for You."

In her memories, Isabella Peterson was mostly a stern and serious guy; she hardly ever heard him sing. But here he was, singing beautifully, and it was utterly captivating!

What started as a playful prank on her part had unearthed a superstar singer in Isabella Peterson. As he softly hummed the tune, Olivia couldn't help but gaze at him with stars in her eyes, and for a rare moment, a blush crept across his cheeks.

Singing a love song to a girl was something he'd never done before, and it made him feel like a bashful teen. He averted his eyes slightly, a hint of shyness on his otherwise striking face.

Olivia, unable to resist, wrapped her arms around his lean waist, gently leaning into his embrace. This boy-next-door version of Isabella made her want to giggle and treasure him even more.

As he continued to hum, he reached out to gently stroke her hair, and a warm, tender feeling spread through the air, enveloping them both...

When the song ended, they remained in their cozy embrace, neither wanting to move, simply enjoying the serene happiness that was theirs alone.

After a while, Isabella gently lifted her head, planting a soft kiss on her forehead, and asked, "Feeling better now?"

So, this man had set aside all his pride to sing just to cheer her up? A swell of warmth filled her heart, spreading through her whole being.

Olivia sniffed, a touch of emotion in her voice, and nodded, "Yeah."

Isabella took her hand, a doting smile playing on his lips. "You're a mom to a bunch of kids now; you can't just burst into tears all the time! Come on, the twins are playing with clay at the studio. Let's join them!"

Olivia's face lit up with a smile, "Alright!"

As they entered the clay studio, they found Coco and Gogo engrossed in their play. Coco was meticulously sculpting a grand castle, bending over with a tiny carving knife, his little face serious and focused, like a young artist perfecting his masterpiece.

Gogo, with her lively and carefree nature, was full of curiosity and excitement but couldn't sit still. She'd been trying to make a doll but gave up, tossing the clay aside in frustration.

Seeing Coco's castle taking shape, she felt a pang of envy and sidled over, her big eyes gleaming with mischief.

"Brother..." she said sweetly, trying to win him over.

But Coco was absorbed in his work, not even glancing up.

Gogo pouted, tugging at his arm, pleading, "Brother—"

"Don't move!" Coco said sternly, a rare reprimand. He frowned at the small decorative piece she'd made him slip and damage.

Carefully, he fixed it with more clay, his concentration unwavering, more meticulous than a scientist at work.

Feeling snubbed and chided, Gogo's mouth quivered, her eyes welling up, ready to cry. She was the adorable, cherished little princess, not used to being ignored!

Coco, usually doting and protective, had a strict rule: he didn't like interruptions while working. Gogo, determined to get his attention, let out a dramatic wail and plopped herself onto the floor.

"Wow—" she cried loudly, tears rolling down her cheeks.

It was meant to be a performance, but the fall hurt more than expected, making her tears genuine.

Coco finally looked up, helplessly sighing. He put down his tool, went over, and helped her up, brushing the dust off her dress like a little adult. "Silly, why'd you sit on the floor on purpose? Did it hurt?"

Caught in her act, Gogo didn't feel embarrassed. Instead, she continued to pout and cry, "Why didn't you pay attention to me? You're a meanie!"

From beloved brother to "meanie," Coco had clearly upset the little drama queen!

Coco's usually calm face showed rare distress, his brows knitting together. "What do you want?"

A hint of compromise?

Gogo instantly brightened, wiping her tears with her sleeve. "I want to build the castle with you!"

Coco's mouth twitched, instinctively refusing, "No way!"

Letting this little troublemaker join him? Just imagining it was a nightmare!

But Gogo wasn't deterred. She widened her eyes, preparing to cry again if needed.

Coco sighed, offering a reluctant compromise, "How about I make a new model for you to decorate?"

"No! I want to do it with you!" Gogo declared, adding boldly, "It'll look better with both of us!"

Coco silently stared at her, internally surrendering.

Gogo, ever the charmer, saw his displeasure and sweetly swayed his arm, coaxing, "Brother, please? My dear brother..."

Coco, out of options, grimaced. "Okay, I'll carve, and you decorate?"

"Deal! I'll make it beautiful!" Gogo promised enthusiastically, hugging him and giving a cheeky kiss on his cheek.

Coco's eyes sparkled, though he feigned annoyance, wiping his cheek and scolding, "Girls shouldn't just kiss people!"

Gogo beamed, her innocence shining, "You're not people; you're my brother!"

"Yeah," Coco replied softly, his serious little face gradually breaking into a smile.

Outside the studio, Olivia Stewart and Isabella Peterson watched their kids interact. Olivia turned to Isabella with a teasing grin, "Your son is hopelessly whipped by his little sister, a true sister complex!"

Isabella shrugged, "What's wrong with that? A brother doting on his sister is natural! When they're older, he can protect Gogo."

While Isabella hoped Coco would always protect his sister, Olivia worried about him being burdened with too many responsibilities.

"I just hope he won't be the same with a wife," Olivia sighed. "I wouldn't want him to be a pushover."

Isabella raised an eyebrow, mischievous, "And what's wrong with that? I'm a pushover for my wife, and I'm perfectly happy!"

Olivia playfully swatted him, averting her gaze. "Stop talking nonsense. Who's your wife?"

It was a sore point for her—after all, the twins were over three, and they still hadn't had a wedding!

Though it seemed trivial with kids involved, marriage was still a cherished memory she wanted. She didn't want to live in ambiguity forever.

Initially, wedding plans were postponed due to a series of events, including her battle with depression. Now, healthy and happy, Isabella hadn't mentioned marriage again. Was he waiting for her to bring it up?

But asking herself felt too desperate!

As these thoughts swirled, Olivia shot Isabella a frustrated glance, only to find him watching her, eyes filled with an unreadable mix of emotions, and a hint of amusement.

It was as if he saw through all her frustrations.

Flustered, Olivia broke away, heading into the studio.

"Mommy! Daddy!" Gogo spotted them, waving energetically, like a cheerful little magpie. "We're building a castle together! Isn't it beautiful?"

And there they were, a family, amidst clay and castles, finding joy in the little things, while the future promised more shared moments and memories.
