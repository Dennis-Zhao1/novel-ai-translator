Henry Adams quickly regained his composure, adding two cubes of sugar to his coffee with a gentlemanly flair. Olivia Stewart glanced at him, her earlier doubts starting to fade. After all, even someone like Isabella Peterson often forgets small tasks like adding sugar to coffee at home.

Thinking of Isabella Peterson brought a smile to Olivia's face, a small, happy curve at the corners of her mouth. Sophie Cook nudged Henry Adams, "Director Adams, what brings someone as busy as you here today? You mentioned something beforeâ€¦?"

"Oh, my memory!" Henry Adams chuckled, tapping his forehead. "I get forgetful when I'm around such beautiful women, forgive me!"

Pushing his coffee aside, Henry leaned forward conspiratorially. "To be honest, I got wind of some not-so-great news about Olivia Stewart from inside Billion Films, and I came to warn her."

Olivia and Sophie exchanged worried glances. "What news? Tell us, Director Adams!"

Henry sighed dramatically. "I've always believed in Olivia Stewart, but the folks at Billion Films are fools! Recently, they signed Lisa, the hottest international actress, for the second female lead. You must have heard?"

Olivia nodded. It was big news when Billion Films signed Lisa for the movie "Send an Angel to Love You." The entire town was buzzing about it.

Henry tapped his fingers on the table, feigning seriousness. "You know Lisa is a big deal internationally. Always winning Best Actress. Why would she settle for a second lead?"

"Is she taking the lead role?" Sophie gasped, clutching Olivia's hand in concern. "What about my sister?"

Henry looked at Olivia with sympathy. Olivia furrowed her brows. "What are you trying to say? Be clear!"

Henry cleared his throat. "Olivia, my sources say, due to your recent negative press, Billion Films plans to announce your dismissal and give Lisa the lead role."

"How can they do that? That's outrageous!" Sophie exclaimed, gripping Olivia's hand tightly.

Olivia patted Sophie, urging her to stay calm.

"Honestly, their talk of casting a newcomer was just a stunt for publicity. Even without any negative press, they would have found some excuse to replace you before the premiere."

"Let's confront them!" Sophie suggested passionately.

"Don't rush in," Henry advised, holding Sophie back. "In this industry, actors have little power against big companies. Causing a scene could backfire."

"So, what do we do?" Sophie asked, sounding desperate.

"I have a better solution," Henry said, looking at Olivia with admiration. "New Horizons Films sees your potential, Olivia. We have a project in the works, with prospects just as promising as 'Send an Angel to Love You.' If you sign with us now, when Billion Films announces your dismissal, you can present a new contract and show them you have better options!"

"That's a great idea!" Sophie cheered, clapping her hands.

Olivia stirred her coffee quietly, not responding immediately. Her silence made Henry and Sophie uneasy, exchanging nervous glances.

Sophie hugged Olivia's arm, urging her, "Sis, there's nothing to hesitate about. They backed out on you, not the other way around! Director Adams is offering you the best solution. Don't miss this chance!"

"I understand," Olivia replied softly, sipping her coffee. She wasn't too attached to the lead role anyway, suspecting it was Isabella who orchestrated it. If it wasn't, she wasn't keen on acting in the first place. Losing the role wasn't a big deal.

But seeing Sophie's eagerness, Olivia thought if she could help her, it would be worth it.

"Is New Horizons Films bigger than Billion?" Olivia asked, looking at Henry.

"Absolutely!" Henry assured.

"And your new project will be more successful than 'Send an Angel to Love You'?"

"I guarantee it!" Henry pounded his chest confidently.

"And I can have the lead role?"

"Definitely!" Henry thought Olivia was convinced.

"But I want to give the lead role to my sister," Olivia said, catching both Henry and Sophie off guard.

"What?" they exclaimed in unison.

Sophie protested, "No! Sis, I won't allow it!"

Olivia reassured her, "Sophie, I'm sorry about the last audition. I owe you a lead role. Please accept it, for my sake, okay?"

Sophie was internally screaming. The original lead was snatched by you, and now you're pushing me into a trap!

Henry knocked on the table, looking seriously at Olivia. "We want you, Olivia, not Sophie."

"My sister is more talented. She's a top student at the City Film Academy. Her acting skills are impeccable. And she's younger and more innocent-looking," Olivia insisted earnestly.

Innocent-looking? Henry almost laughed.

"Director Adams, to be honest, I took this lead role to help my sister get a part. I'm not suited for acting. If I'm dismissed, it's no big deal. But my sister is truly talented. You won't regret signing her!"

Olivia's sincerity was evident, making it hard to dismiss her plea.

Sophie wasn't moved, feeling more trapped.

"How about this, sis? You don't have to sign right away. Just visit New Horizons' set with Director Adams," Sophie suggested, trying to lure Olivia into the trap.

"No actor visits a set without signing," Sophie thought, trying to get Olivia into Henry's car.

But Olivia, unfamiliar with the industry and trusting Sophie, saw her urgency as concern and smiled warmly.

"Sophie, I think you'd be better. Show them your talent. They might choose you for the lead on the spot!"

Sophie almost dropped to her knees. How can I go? I'd blow the whole plan!

Sophie and Henry exchanged defeated glances. Olivia was tougher than they thought.

Henry stood with his briefcase, "Excuse me, I need to use the restroom."

"Of course, Director Adams!"

Sophie quickly stood, making a gesture, accidentally knocking over her coffee. The dark liquid spilled, dripping onto her skirt.

"Oh no!" Sophie stepped back, shaking her skirt. "Sis, wait for me. I'll be right back."

What will Sophie and Henry try next to ensnare Olivia? And will Olivia fall for it?
