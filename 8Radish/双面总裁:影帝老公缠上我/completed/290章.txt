Olivia Stewart stood frozen, her heart pounding against her chest. The realization hit her like a ton of bricks—that painting was more than just an art piece; it was a cleverly disguised doorway. The button on the door in the painting seemed to beckon her. Could it really be this easy?

She hesitated for a moment, the fear of a trap gnawing at her insides. But the thought of remaining in this underground maze forever, under Alexander Peterson's watchful eye, was even more terrifying.

With a deep breath, she reached out and pressed the button. The click echoed through the silent corridor, and the painting began to shift, revealing a narrow passageway behind it. Olivia's heart soared with a mix of hope and disbelief. This was it—her way out.

She glanced back, half expecting Alexander Peterson to appear out of nowhere and drag her back. But the corridor was empty, filled only with the faint scent of freedom. Gathering her courage, Olivia slipped through the opening and into the unknown.

The passage was dark and claustrophobic, but Olivia pressed on, driven by the thought of reuniting with Isabella Peterson and ensuring her child’s safety. Her footsteps echoed softly as she navigated the winding path, her mind racing with possibilities.

Finally, a faint light appeared in the distance, growing brighter with each step. Olivia quickened her pace, her heart fluttering with anticipation. She emerged into an open space—a small, dimly lit room, with a heavy wooden door on the far side.

Her hands trembled as she reached for the door handle, pausing only for a moment to steady herself. With a firm twist, the door creaked open, revealing the night sky and the cool, fresh air of freedom.

Olivia stepped out, her senses overwhelmed by the sheer relief of being out in the open. She took a deep breath, savoring the crisp air, and looked around. The underground palace had been cleverly hidden beneath what seemed like an ordinary countryside landscape.

For the first time in days, she felt a flicker of hope. Isabella Peterson was out there somewhere, probably worried sick. But Olivia knew she could count on Isabella to find her, to bring her back to safety.

She had managed to escape Alexander Peterson's clutches, but she knew it wasn't over yet. There would be challenges ahead, but Olivia was determined to face them head-on, for herself and for her child.

With renewed resolve, she set off into the night, ready to find her way back to the life she had been so cruelly torn from.
