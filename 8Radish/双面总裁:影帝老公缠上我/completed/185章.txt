Olivia Stewart found herself caught in a whirlwind of emotions after the intense scene. The line "If you live, I live with you. If you die, I die with you!" echoed in her mind long after the director, Mr. Wang, yelled cut. It felt as if she had been living the life of her character, White Yike, not just acting it.

Her co-star, Ethan Sky, noticed Olivia's moodiness as she stared silently at the flowers and plants around them. He assumed it was just another case of an actor being too immersed in their role, a common occurrence. Olivia was new to the acting scene, so it might take her longer to shake it off.

Gently patting her back, Ethan reassured her, "It's just acting, Olivia. Don't be too hard on yourself. Even if you're sad for the characters, remember, their ending is bound to be happy. On and off the screen, we'll be fine!"

Olivia nodded absent-mindedly, still lost in her thoughts. Ethan checked his watch and said, "I've got some things to handle, so we're done for today. I'll have someone take you home for a break."

"No need, I have my driver. I'll be fine," Olivia replied with a faint smile.

"Alright then!" Ethan chuckled, playfully ruffling her hair before leaving with his stylist, Amy Green. His many roles kept him on his toes, and Amy's fashion magic was indispensable.

Once Olivia returned to her apartment, she was still in a daze, replaying the recent scenes in her mind as if they were real memories. She was beginning to question if Isabella Peterson's claim was true—was she actually White Yike?

The thought startled her. Her heart raced uncontrollably, and she couldn't believe she was even considering such a wild idea. If she really was White Yike, why couldn't she remember anything? No one, not even Sophie Cook, had ever called her that.

Determined to figure things out, Olivia decided she needed to visit her hometown, Peaceful Springs, to uncover the truth. After a quick, distracted lunch, she informed Lucas Wright of her plans and set out alone, foregoing the security detail Isabella had provided.

The bus ride to Peaceful Springs took about two hours, and when Olivia arrived, she was struck by how much the place had changed. The quaint little town had transformed into a bustling development zone, with high-rises replacing the old streets and buildings. The familiar tranquility was gone.

As she wandered through the unfamiliar surroundings, a deep sense of loss washed over her. The town she grew up in was unrecognizable, and so was the home she once knew.

Eventually, Olivia found the spot where her childhood home stood, now replaced by a modern apartment complex. Her father had sold their home for the redevelopment, only to lose the money in a matter of days. After her mother's death, Olivia had left with Sophie to start anew in the city, never looking back.

Standing in the complex's garden, Olivia was overwhelmed by nostalgia and sadness. Everything had changed so quickly—people and places alike.

But then, she saw it—a giant, ancient tree, still standing tall amidst the new buildings. It was the same tree that had been beside her childhood home. Overcome with emotion, Olivia circled the tree, tears of joy streaming down her face.

"This tree, it’s still here!" she whispered, touching its rough bark with reverence.

Remembering how she used to bury little treasures beneath this tree, Olivia wondered if she might find some evidence of her lost past here. With renewed determination, she bought a small spade and began to dig around the tree's roots.

Unbeknownst to her, a pair of watchful eyes followed her every move from a distance, waiting for the right moment to strike.

Olivia dug meticulously despite the hard soil, sweat beading on her forehead. She was certain this trip would uncover something significant.

After some time, her spade struck something solid. Carefully, Olivia unearthed a small wooden box from between two large roots. The box was old and worn, its lock rusted.

With a laugh, Olivia broke the lock with her spade and opened the box, her heart pounding with anticipation. Inside, she found a small clay figurine and some papers and notebooks that looked like sketches and journals.

Holding the figurine, Olivia was taken aback.

How could it be?
