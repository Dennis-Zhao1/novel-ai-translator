Olivia Stewart, are you out of your mind?

"The inheritance went to Chloe Wright, and everything's in her hands now. The White family is relying on that money to get by, and with her being sick..."

No wonder, it's all about the money!

Olivia Stewart was utterly disappointed with James White, completely speechless.

But perhaps it's for the best; people like him are easy to deal with as long as there's something in it for them.

Olivia lifted her chin defiantly. "I'll agree to go for the compatibility test! But..."

"No way! Whether it matches or not, I won't allow it!" Isabella Peterson interjected, decisively cutting Olivia off.

Olivia gently squeezed Isabella's hand, signaling her to stay calm.

It's just a compatibility test, right? If James could help in finding Tommy, she was willing to give it a shot!

Olivia turned to James. "Answer me one question first!"

The despair in James's eyes was instantly replaced with a glimmer of hope. "Ask away!"

"The caves out in the Golden Valley suburb, who was responsible for developing the interior back then? Do you know?"

"The caves..." James pondered for a moment. "I did take on part of that contract."

Olivia's eyes lit up at once, urgently asking, "Do you remember the layout inside?"

James shook his head. "It's been years, I've forgotten."

Olivia's face fell in disappointment, like someone who had painstakingly climbed out of a well only to be kicked back down.

"But..."

James's tone shifted, reigniting the spark in Olivia's eyes, like someone dangling off a cliff who suddenly found a vine to hold onto.

"But I have the blueprints. There was a whole section of caves left undeveloped. I hid the maps, thinking I'd develop it myself someday for profit!"

"Why didn't you say so earlier?" Olivia glared at him, not surprised by his persistent greed.

James looked puzzled. "What do you need those maps for?"

Of course, to save someone!

Olivia swallowed the words before they left her mouth and said coldly, "That's none of your concern!"

If James knew it was for saving a life, he'd probably jack up the price and hold her to ransom!

"Alright, dig up those maps for me, and I'll head to the hospital for the test right away!"

"Deal! Deal!" James nodded, grateful.

Isabella's face was stormy, on the brink of protesting several times, only to be stared down by Olivia, who kept a firm grip on her.

Once James was gone, Isabella exploded, "Olivia, do you even know what you're doing? Are you really going to donate a kidney for some map?"

Olivia shot him a glance, "It's not that serious, it's just a test!"

"And if it's a match? Are you going to donate a kidney because that old man begged you to? He never took care of you for a single day, and you want to give his woman a kidney? Olivia, are you nuts?" Isabella practically shouted, his eyes wide with disbelief.

"I'm not nuts!"

Olivia shouted back at him.

"Isabella, you're the one who's crazy! I only agreed to the test, not to donate a kidney. The chances of a match are slimmer than winning the lottery. We won’t match anyway!"

"And if we do, like you said, would I really donate a kidney to his woman? Isabella, you're insulting my intelligence!"

Seeing Olivia's clear-headed determination, Isabella finally relaxed a bit, albeit still worried, "Even if it's just a test, you'll have to go through blood tests and all sorts of things. It's a lot to go through!"

Olivia gave him a helpless look, her voice softening, "Isabella, I know you're worried about me! Don't worry, I know what's important. With the map, we can find Tommy as quickly as possible. A little discomfort is worth it!"

Isabella had nothing more to say, so he gently stroked her back, murmuring, "Thank you for going through this."

After a brief rest, they both headed to the study to plot out possible hiding spots for Alexander Peterson.

As they worked, Olivia felt a wave of intense restlessness rising within her.

Fearing Isabella might notice, she suppressed it as best she could.

After examining several potential locations, Isabella left to personally oversee the search and gather manpower.

Olivia returned to her room, gulping down water and taking deep breaths.

Her hand instinctively reached for the nightstand drawer. Inside was a bottle of sedatives she had gotten from a doctor, and she had already consumed more than half in just a few days.

She tipped two pills into her palm, hesitated, then added a third.

Since James left, her nerves had been on edge, and her usual dose seemed ineffective.

She was about to swallow them with some lukewarm water when she stopped.

If James came back with the map, she'd have to go for the compatibility test. If her blood showed high levels of sedatives, not only would Isabella find out her secret, but James might get angry over a failed test and retract the map.

Thinking this, Olivia dared not take the pills.

She quietly returned the medication, screwing the cap tightly and stashing it in the corner of the drawer.

James should have been home by now, right? Why hadn't he called? Had he found the map? Was he messing with her?

Olivia's mind was tangled with worry, pacing anxiously around the room.

She knew her emotions were off-kilter. Having suppressed them for so long, she was nearing a breaking point. If anything pushed her over the edge, she feared her depression might fully erupt.

But with the search for Tommy at such a crucial stage, she couldn't burden Isabella with her troubles.

As she tried to calm herself, she drank water and took deep breaths.

But the inner turmoil refused to subside.

Olivia checked her phone every minute, tempted to rush to James's house.

The anxiety dragged on until evening when Isabella returned, reporting that all other locations had been searched, leaving the caves as the prime suspect.

Olivia felt no relief, only more urgency. "Let's just go to James's place and ask him directly!"

Isabella, seeing her anxious and worn-out appearance, pulled her close, soothingly. "Olivia, don't worry! I've sent most of our team to the caves and hired local guides. We'll have news soon, even without the map!"

"Let's hope so!"

Though she said this, Olivia's heart remained tense.

That night, Olivia found herself tossing and turning, eyes wide open, unable to sleep. Isabella, at a loss, resorted to the most direct method, exhausting her until she drifted into sleep.

The next day, James brought a yellowed map.

"You wouldn't believe how long it took to find this thing! It wasn't anywhere at home. I finally found it in the old brick house I used during the construction contract!"

James chattered on, a hint of pride in his voice.

Isabella unfolded the map, scanning it with sharp eyes, then nodded slightly to Olivia.

He had researched the caves, and this map seemed genuine.

James looked eagerly at Olivia, clearly expecting her to keep her promise and go for the test.

Olivia, understanding his look, turned to Isabella, "Take the map and start the search, I'll head to the hospital with James!"

In the urgency of the situation, Isabella knew that even if he wanted to accompany Olivia, she wouldn't agree. So he nodded, "Alright, I'll go right away! Let Lucas Wright go with you."

Olivia shook her head. "No, Lucas needs to stay here and coordinate. I can handle it alone! You go!"

James, sensing something between them, asked, "Olivia, is something going on?"

Olivia replied coolly, "Nothing, let's go!"

"Okay!"

James followed Olivia, all the while speculating: Are they onto some huge business opportunity or treasure in those caves? After Olivia's test, I need to get that map back!

James's imagination was running wild!

But for now, the map was with Isabella, and though James was anxious, he showed no sign of it.

At the hospital, Olivia went through the blood tests and other procedures.

The results would take a few days. Once the tests were done, Olivia returned home.

The first thing she did was pull out her sedatives, swallowing several, before collapsing onto her bed, falling into a deep, dreamless sleep, and finally finding peace from the oppressive emotions.

In the suburban caves.

Alexander Peterson, during Tommy’s nap, went out for supplies and ran into a couple of adventurers. If he hadn’t known the terrain so well, he might have bumped right into them.

After a few twists and turns, he spotted another pair of explorers.

These folks, equipped with searchlights, weren’t there for a leisurely hike; they were looking for something.

Alexander quickly realized that his hideout had been guessed by Isabella. Still, with the cave's complex layout, even if they knew he was there, it wouldn’t be easy to catch him!

With a sly grin, Alexander slipped through another passage back to his hideout...
