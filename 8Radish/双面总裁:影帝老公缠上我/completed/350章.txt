Picking the Dress

Life was looking up for Olivia Stewart, except for one nagging issue—Isabella Peterson still hadn't shown any signs of wanting to tie the knot. What was he up to? One evening, while walking hand in hand with Isabella near a dreamy lakeside, Olivia noticed a castle across the way, glowing like a million little stars. Curiosity piqued, she asked, "What's that place?"

Isabella just smiled mysteriously. "Why don't we go see?"

Olivia shot him a skeptical look. Was he planning something special? She tugged at Isabella's hand, quickening their pace toward the enchanting castle. As they approached, fields of vibrant tulips greeted them with their sweet fragrance. Olivia was astonished—how had she missed this magical spot all the years she'd lived nearby? Maybe Isabella had crafted it while she was away at the ranch?

Eagerly, Olivia pushed open the castle doors. Inside, the grandeur was breathtaking. The high ceilings adorned with massive chandeliers cast a sparkling glow over everything. Olivia stood frozen at the entrance, her jaw dropping in awe.

What did she see? A paradise of wedding dresses! Whites as pure as snow, princess pinks, dreamy purples—there were crystal-studded, diamond-encrusted, and delicate lace gowns. Every style imaginable was there.

"See anything you like? Want to pick one?" Isabella's voice came from above, teasing yet full of affection.

Olivia turned to him, her eyes sparkling with joy. "When did you prepare all this, Isabella?"

Isabella feigned deep thought, brow furrowing. "Hmm... seems like it was... a long time ago!"

Gathering so many exquisite dresses couldn't have been a quick affair. Olivia's eyes roved over Isabella's handsome face. "Did you start this the day you proposed?"

Caught off guard, Isabella's face flushed slightly before he cockily denied it. "Not at all! Back then, I just wanted to marry you quickly. I didn't have time to prepare so many for you to choose from."

Giggling, Olivia poked Isabella's chest playfully. "So when did you actually start?"

Embarrassed, Isabella scratched his nose. "After you left for the ranch, I was bored alone. I'd see a beautiful dress and just collect it, never realizing I'd end up with so many!"

Olivia moved closer to inspect a dress, noticing a small tag on the back stand with details about the designer and its uniqueness. These were the masterpieces of world-renowned bridal fashion maestros. To have "casually" collected them was quite something!

With a mischievous grin, Olivia asked, "Isabella, are you planning to marry multiple wives with all these dresses?"

What? Was she really jealous over wedding dresses?

Isabella raised an eyebrow, declaring dramatically, "They're all for you! If you want, you can wear a new one every day and be a bride every single day!"

Imagining that scenario—being a bride daily—Olivia couldn't help but chuckle internally. She wanted to tell him to quit being so lavish, but Isabella's next words wiped the smile off her face.

"You can be my bride every day, and I'll be the groom every day, and we'll have a wedding night every night!"

All these dresses, just for nightly celebrations? This man!

Despite feeling a twinge of guilt over Isabella's extravagant spending spree, Olivia couldn't help but feel overjoyed at his thoughtful gesture. Each dress was so stunning that choosing one seemed impossible!

Isabella hadn't forgotten about marriage; he'd been preparing all along. Happiness bubbled up inside her like a fizzy drink. Olivia asked softly, "When are you planning to marry me, Isabella?"

As soon as the words left her lips, a strong arm wrapped around her waist. Isabella pulled her close, his warm breath tickling her ear. "So eager to get married?"

Olivia pouted. "What do you mean? You ask me to pick a wedding dress; of course, it means you want to marry me! Unless... you want me to model them for fun?"

Isabella chuckled, the sound rumbling through his chest and into Olivia's ears. After a pause, he nibbled playfully on her ear. "Are you mad, little one?"

She turned her head away with a soft "hmph."

Teasing her with wedding dresses without proposing—what a trick!

Isabella tightened his hold around her, his voice dropping to a serious whisper. "Olivia, I've wanted you to be my wife for so, so long. I've prepared everything for our wedding, even down to the smallest detail in my mind."

"I haven't told you because I know family means a lot to you. I wanted you to have your family's blessings, for everyone to be happy together. I wanted to wait until you were ready to embrace everything and marry me without any worries."

"But I can't wait any longer!"

"This dream castle was built just for you. We've walked past it so many times, yet you never noticed. If you hadn't spotted it soon, I would've had to find another way to show you!"

Feeling a bit shy, Isabella looked away. Doing all this quietly was fine, but saying it out loud was... well, awkward!

"Thank you, Isabella! Thank you for thinking of everything for me," Olivia whispered as she hugged him, resting her cheek against his warm chest.

Isabella gave a cheeky grin. "So how do you plan to thank me?"

Olivia looked up, her earlier warmth fading at his sudden mischievousness. She playfully punched his chest before declaring, "I'm already yours! What more do you want? Shall I wrap myself up as a gift?"

"That sounds perfect!" Isabella laughed, spinning her around until they were both dizzy with joy.

"Whoa, put me down, you rascal!" Olivia squealed, though her laughter betrayed her delight.

As he set her down, Isabella whispered against her hair, "Give me everything—your heart, your life. Will you?"

Olivia leaned against him, teasing, "That's quite a lot! What do you offer in return?"

"Myself," Isabella answered simply.

He added, "My body, my heart, my life—for yours. Deal?"

Olivia responded by tiptoeing to press a sweet kiss on Isabella's lips, intending just a quick peck. But Isabella had other plans, deepening the kiss with a hand gently cradling her head.

As the kiss grew more intense, the air around them seemed to crackle with electricity. Breathless, Olivia finally pushed away, gasping, "Wait... we haven't picked a dress yet!"

Isabella, enjoying her flushed face, lightly licked her lip. "Afraid I'll devour you right here? It might be fun!"

Olivia jumped back, stammering, "I-I'll go pick a dress!"

Though tempted, Isabella knew they had business to attend to. Tonight was for dress shopping, after all. Plenty of time for other things later.

As Olivia wandered among the gowns, her mind settled, and she became captivated by the beauty around her. She found herself in front of a massive glass case, utterly entranced.
