Sophie Cook's Dramatic Gesture

Olivia Stewart was taken aback, eyes wide with disbelief, as her younger sister, Sophie Cook, suddenly dropped to her knees in front of her. The bustling noise of the college campus came to a halt, and curious onlookers quickly whipped out their smartphones to capture the drama unfolding before them.

Olivia Stewart had become quite the talk of the college. The moment she arrived, her sister Sophie knelt down before her—instant headline material!

It took Olivia a few seconds to snap out of her daze. She bent over to help Sophie up. "What are you doing? Get up. Whatever it is, we can talk it out."

"No, sis! I'm here to apologize!" Sophie insisted, her voice trembling with emotion.

Sophie knelt there, back straight, staring up at Olivia with eyes brimming with tears. She looked utterly pitiful, and the scene tugged at the heartstrings of everyone around. People cast puzzled glances at the two sisters, trying to piece together the story.

Olivia sighed and tried again to lift Sophie. "Let's talk this over. No matter what happened, it's not worth this. Everyone's watching. Come on, get up!"

"I won't! Not until you forgive me!" Sophie declared stubbornly, tears rolling down her cheeks and splashing onto her shirt.

Sophie crawled forward a bit on her knees, clutching Olivia's hand. Her voice was a mix of sobs and pleas. "Sis, I went too far during the auditions. I shouldn't have accused you of using my image to get selected. I was just upset about not landing the lead role. Your slap woke me up. I was wrong, truly! Please forgive me! You're my only sister. I won't compete with you anymore. I'll take any small role, even a maid, just don't ignore me!"

Sophie's naturally soft and childlike voice made her tearful confession even more heart-wrenching. To the bystanders, it seemed like Olivia had taken advantage of Sophie’s image, and when Sophie spoke out, she got slapped. Now, to keep her only sister, she was publicly apologizing!

Sympathy and admiration for Sophie filled the crowd, while Olivia received looks of disapproval and disdain. This kind of sister was just too much!

Olivia felt trapped, unable to explain the whole story. What Sophie said was true, but it wasn't the entire truth, leading to misunderstandings. Yet, seeing Sophie's remorse, Olivia was just relieved. Her heart ached seeing Sophie kneeling there, tears streaming down her face.

Olivia bent over again, trying to lift Sophie from the ground. But Sophie clung to her hands, pulling Olivia down, making it appear as if Sophie was desperately begging while Olivia remained unmoved.

With no other option, Olivia sighed, "Alright, alright, I forgive you. Now get up."

"Thank you, sis!" Sophie instantly brightened, standing up with Olivia's help, though she almost stumbled.

Olivia quickly steadied her, and Sophie collapsed into her arms, crying softly, "Sis, sis..."

Hearing the soft, tearful cries of "sis," Olivia's heart shattered. Despite past disappointments, she couldn't help but feel a surge of affection for the sister she had raised for years.

"It's my fault. I was too harsh on you. You're still just a kid," Olivia murmured, her eyes moist with tears, comforting Sophie with gentle pats on her back.

The two sisters reconciled, embracing each other as they cried. The crowd whispered among themselves, their perception of Olivia shifting after her words of forgiveness, seemingly confirming Sophie's earlier accusations.

For Olivia, the slap from the auditions had been a source of guilt and conflict, but Sophie's kneeling had washed away her resentment, leaving only self-reproach. "I neglected your feelings," Olivia repeated to herself.

Sophie leaned against Olivia's shoulder, tears flowing, but a cold smile played at the corners of her lips, hidden from view.

After the emotional sibling showdown, Olivia and Sophie appeared to mend their relationship. Olivia was placed in Sophie's class as a temporary student. Sophie returned to her innocent demeanor, introducing Olivia to classmates, sharing acting tips, stage positions, and character expressions.

Olivia had only attended college for a year before dropping out due to family tragedies, taking on the responsibility to support Sophie’s education. Now, given a chance to return to academia, albeit briefly, Olivia cherished every moment, diving into her studies with fervor, often spending her time in the library catching up on academic subjects.

Sophie took on the task of bringing Olivia meals, diligently delivering food to the library. One day, as she approached, a group of friends stopped her.

"Sophie, what are you doing? You've been ignoring us for days, hanging with that snake of a sister. Is it fun?"

Sophie looked seriously at her old friends. "Don't talk about my sister like that, or I'll get mad!"

"Wow, still defending her? She took your lead role and slapped you, yet you're bringing her food?"

Sophie looked around nervously as more people gathered, stamping her foot in frustration. "Shh! Lower your voice! She's my only sister. What's wrong with bringing her food? I don't want to lose her!"

Her friends rolled their eyes. "You're hopeless! Let us help you get back at her!"

"No! I won't let you hurt my sister! Or we're done!"

Someone in the crowd couldn't hold back, shouting, "Sophie, you're too kind! Sisters like her deserve a lesson! We used to admire her when the results came out, but she's not who we thought. If you can't stand up to her, let us handle it!"

"Yeah! Let's deal with her!"

"Don't, I've gotten used to it," Sophie replied, lowering her head, hiding the victorious smile in her eyes.

"Fine, fine, you stay out of it. We'll handle it discreetly!"

"Just... don't go too far, okay?"

"We won't, don't worry!"

Everyone exchanged knowing smirks.

Sophie bowed slightly. "Thank you all. Even if I'm just a minor character in the new drama, I'll remember you if I ever catch the eye of the star, Sky."

Her words made everyone's eyes light up.

Olivia, being new to the college scene, was either studying or with Sophie, making it hard for others to get close. Besides, if she could slap her own sister, others wouldn't stand a chance. It was better to stick with Sophie.

Having achieved her goal, Sophie smiled and bid them farewell before heading into the library to find Olivia.

Unaware of the brewing plans, Olivia soon noticed something was off. Wandering the campus, she felt the cold stares and heard the whispers. Students looked at her with disdain, murmured insults, and even outright ignored her.

Olivia understood, in a way. She had swooped in and snagged a lead role in a new film, something those studying drama had been vying for. Their resentment was understandable.

But understanding didn’t mean she was wrong.

Olivia tried greeting a few classmates, but after receiving cold responses, she stopped trying.

Sophie, always by her side, reassured her. "They're just jealous. Ignore them!"

Olivia beamed at Sophie. "You're the best. I wish I could give you this opportunity, but I tried and failed. You're talented and have potential. Shine in this role, and I'm sure you'll get the lead next time!"

"Of course!" Sophie nodded, eyes bright, though inwardly she cursed: hypocrite!

Two days later, Olivia had grown used to the cold shoulders, but new troubles arose. Walking on campus, she was often bumped into, and skateboarders seemed to aim for her at intersections.

These incidents happened repeatedly. Often, Olivia nearly fell, only for Sophie to rush in and shield her, shouting at the offenders.

Sometimes, Olivia felt grateful for her sister's support.

Soon, theoretical classes ended, and practical performance sessions began. Olivia had no idea the challenges awaiting her...
