Title: Romance on the Rope Ladder

Uh-oh! Things just got messy!

Some paparazzi got bold and tried to sneak away, but the bodyguards outside kicked them back in. Isabella Peterson scanned the room with a cold, piercing gaze. "What? You think you can mess with my girl and just leave?"

"Please, Isabella, spare us!" The paparazzi were in chaos, and one of them, unable to hold back, protested, "But the photos online really look like Olivia Stewart, we were just..."

"You blind fools!" Isabella's voice cut through the noise, and the protesting paparazzo received two quick slaps.

"Look closely," Isabella said, pulling Olivia Stewart over and brushing back her bangs to reveal a floral-shaped birthmark on her forehead. "My girl's got a birthmark, see? Those fake photos don't."

Everyone strained to see Olivia's face, cameras zoomed in on her forehead, and the image was broadcast on a nearby big screen for all to see. Sure enough, Olivia's forehead had a delicate pink flower-shaped birthmark that complemented her big eyes and small face perfectly.

Isabella glanced at the amazed expressions around her, but she wasn't happy. She quickly covered Olivia's forehead again. Honestly, Olivia looked even more stunning with her birthmark showing, but Isabella had always insisted on keeping it hidden with bangs. Even Olivia herself hadn't noticed it much since makeup artists covered it up for her roles, on Isabella's instructions.

Why let others admire the most beautiful side of your girl?

Isabella's icy gaze swept through the room, her presence commanding and intimidating. "Now, do you see clearly?"

"Yes, yes!" Everyone nodded frantically.

Rumor-mongering was the paparazzi's natural instinct, but this time, they had genuinely wronged Olivia Stewart, and she happened to be Isabella's woman!

Some were already kneeling, begging for forgiveness. "Olivia Stewart, we're sorry! Isabella, spare us!"

Olivia leaned obediently against Isabella, coldly watching the groveling crowd. Hmph, now you realize you were wrong? Where was all that energy when you were slandering me?

Why should a simple apology make everything okay? I'm not as forgiving as you think!

Olivia remained silent, and thus, so did Isabella. More people dropped to their knees, the ground now covered with a sea of bowing heads, pleading like chickens pecking at rice. "Olivia Stewart, we're sorry! Olivia Stewart, we're sorry..."

Eventually, Olivia couldn't stand it anymore. She turned her face away. "Enough!"

The saying goes that a man's knees are worth gold, but look at them kneeling and whining like this!

If people knew Olivia's disdain, they'd definitely joke: Olivia, that's because you don't know how powerful your man is! All his gentleness is reserved for you; the rest is all iron and blood.

Isabella spoke coldly, "My girl told you to stop. Didn't you hear?"

The paparazzi froze, instantly falling silent. Even the ones who had been crying stifled their sobs.

Olivia gently tugged on Isabella's sleeve, whispering, "Tell them to get up."

Isabella immediately relayed, "Get up! Your kneeling is ugly, sullying my girl's eyes and ruining her mood!"

Olivia wanted to scream. You're making me sound like some bossy crab! How am I supposed to face people now?

Isabella chuckled, glancing at Olivia. "You're getting cheeky, aren't you?"

Olivia's mind was racing, but she kept quiet. I'm not flirting; I'm just giving you a little reminder!

Seeing Olivia's embarrassment, Isabella couldn't help but smile. She leaned in and pecked her cheek. Then, turning back to the crowd, she asked, "Now that we know these photos have nothing to do with my girl, who do they belong to?"

"Isabella..." Olivia tried to speak, but it was too late. The crowd chorused, "Sophie Cook!"

Everyone knew Sophie Cook was Olivia's sister. They looked similar, and with Sophie trying to mimic Olivia, the resemblance was even stronger. Once the photos hit the internet, with a little push from those with an agenda, they were bound to go viral.

These paparazzi were savvy enough to connect the dots quickly.

At the mention of Sophie Cook, everyone seethed with resentment.

Olivia was panicking, her brows knitted in worry. "Isabella!"

Isabella looked at Olivia, his dark eyes serious and intense. "How long are you going to cover for her?"

Olivia bit her lip. It wasn't that she wanted to take the blame. What girl doesn't care about her reputation? But in that situation, if she didn't step in, Sophie might have done something drastic. Could she really watch her only sister jump?

Olivia looked up, meeting Isabella's gaze with determination. "I don't care what it takes, you have to settle this. If anything happens to Sophie Cook, I'll never forgive you!"

Isabella's brows furrowed, frustration mixed with a hint of affection in his voice. "You fool! Sometimes I just want to shake some sense into you!"

Olivia stubbornly held his gaze. Go ahead and try!

Isabella glared at her before turning to the paparazzi. "The person in the photos is indeed Sophie Cook. But the images were doctored by someone trying to tarnish my company's reputation."

"Yes, yes, I knew it was Photoshop!" the crowd echoed eagerly.

Isabella waved them off. "You can all go now."

"Thank you, Isabella! Thank you, Olivia!" The crowd scattered, fleeing like rats, leaving chaos in their wake.

Watching them scramble, Olivia couldn't help but smile, her teeth shining brightly in the sunlight as she remembered their earlier arrogance.

Isabella watched Olivia's lively face, pulled her close, and, without warning, kissed her deeply. This little troublemaker! Did she not know how worried he was when those explosive photos surfaced, when he couldn't reach her, when she stood on the balcony?

The more Isabella thought about it, the more intense his kisses became, as if he wanted to devour Olivia whole.

Olivia struggled against him, pushing at his chest. "Mmm, mmm..."

"Move again, and I'll have you right here," Isabella growled, his voice thick with desire.

Olivia froze, recognizing the wolfish glint in his eyes. She knew this rhythm all too well.

Isabella's kiss softened, becoming gentle and tender. Olivia relaxed against him, her tension melting away.

The bodyguards had discreetly turned their backs, and the ever-thoughtful butler, Lucas Wright, directed someone to hold a large parasol over the couple.

Olivia, using the last of her strength, pushed Isabella away, whispering, "Not here..."

A deep, amused chuckle rumbled from Isabella's chest. He tapped her nose playfully. "Silly girl!"

He wasn't planning on doing anything here; his woman deserved privacy, not an audience.

"Let's go!" Isabella wrapped an arm around Olivia's waist, grabbed the rope ladder, and with a graceful leap, lifted them both. As they swung through the air, Olivia clung tightly to him, her face pressed against his chest.

"Look up," Isabella whispered.

"Hmm?" Olivia looked up, catching only the sharp line of his jaw before his face closed in on hers.

"Isabella, mmm..."

He kissed her again, right there on the swinging rope ladder!

Olivia's heart pounded wildly, unsure if it was fear or excitement.

The helicopter rose, carrying the kissing couple over the city, past buildings and gardens, toward the shimmering lake at the center of a lush fairy-tale landscape.

By the time Isabella reluctantly released Olivia's lips, they were flying over a picturesque scene of castles and greenery. Olivia, amazed, exclaimed, "It's beautiful!"

Isabella's voice rumbled above her, "It'd be even more beautiful if I could devour you right now."

"You..." Was he always this cheeky?

Olivia wanted to smack him, but the moment she let go, she felt a rush of fear, quickly clinging back to him.

Isabella watched her, amused. "Silly girl, there's no need to worry. I'd never let go of you."

Would he? But he had already let go once before. Olivia's mood dimmed, biting her lip, she stayed silent.
