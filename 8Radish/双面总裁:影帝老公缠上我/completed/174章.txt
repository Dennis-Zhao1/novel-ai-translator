The Pinnacle of Happiness

"I won't allow anything to happen to you!"

This was, without a doubt, the most touching and assertive declaration of love Isabella Peterson had ever heard in her life!

Isabella’s eyes lit up like stars in the night sky. In a swift motion, she pulled Olivia Stewart close, one hand gently threading through her silky hair as she tucked Olivia's head into her shoulder. With a soft, determined tilt, Isabella found Olivia's lips, capturing them with her own.

"Isabella, no, stop..." Olivia protested, trying to wriggle away.

How did a simple conversation turn into this? The shift in atmosphere was so sudden!

"Sweetheart, just for saying that, you deserve a reward," Isabella teased.

"What reward? You're just making an excuse..." Olivia tried to argue, but her words were swallowed by Isabella’s eager kiss.

The air between them was electric, a chemistry that seemed to warm the room. While Isabella continued to savor Olivia's sweetness, she tenderly guided her down onto the carpet.

"Wait!" Olivia finally broke free, managing to speak up.

Isabella looked momentarily frustrated, "You do realize that stopping now is like a crime against love, right?"

Olivia wasn't swayed by Isabella's teasing. She quickly rolled away and sat up at a safe distance.

"I haven't finished asking my question!"

"Go on, ask away," Isabella replied, clearly impatient.

"Why were you at that place?" Olivia asked, immediately regretting it. A club like that was designed for high-profile men like Isabella—how could she not expect him to go there? It would be more surprising if he hadn't.

"Uh..." Isabella was caught off guard, a rare blush coloring her cheeks.

Olivia's expression darkened, deciding not to press further. Asking more would only trouble her heart further.

In one swift motion, Isabella closed the gap between them, drawing Olivia back into her embrace.

Olivia didn’t resist, but her downcast eyes and pouting lips showed she wasn't happy.

Isabella gently lifted her face, gazing into her eyes with sincerity, "Olivia, I was wrong! Actually, after that one slip-up, I never went back. I've been feeling guilty ever since. But when I found out the truth, I was relieved! Do you know how happy I was that night when I realized it was you? I've never betrayed you."

The way Isabella said her name melted Olivia’s heart, warming her from the inside out. A sweet sensation, like honey, spread through her.

The ice that had been lodged in Olivia’s heart finally melted, and a smile crept onto her lips. She couldn’t help but hug Isabella’s waist. "Isabella, I’m glad too! Thank goodness it was you that night!"

Thanking Daniel Johnson for his betrayal, she thought, for it led her to give her purest self to Isabella.

Isabella, hearing her words, wrapped Olivia in a tight embrace, kissing her hair with deep affection. "I never lost you, and that's wonderful!"

Olivia silently echoed in her heart, "Having you is wonderful!"

With newfound warmth, Isabella tenderly captured Olivia’s lips again. This time, Olivia didn’t shy away; she stood on her tiptoes, wrapped her arms around Isabella’s neck, and returned the kiss with all her passion.

Olivia’s bold response was like a spark, igniting all of Isabella’s emotions. No longer needing restraint, Isabella showered Olivia with all the love and warmth she could muster.

As the moonlight shifted and a gentle breeze stirred the curtains, the room was enveloped in a cozy, romantic atmosphere.

That night, with their hearts open and their pasts reconciled, Isabella and Olivia found themselves repeatedly reaching the pinnacle of happiness and joy.

Olivia basked in the glittering world around her, and as she felt herself drifting into a blissful daze, a smile bloomed on her face.

Giving her whole heart to a man felt truly wonderful.

Meanwhile, Lucas Wright, the ever-watchful steward, stood downstairs, having dismissed all the castle’s staff to maintain privacy. As he listened to the distant sounds upstairs gradually quiet down, his face wrinkled with age broke into a satisfied smile, his white hair fluttering gently like a content old sage.

Suddenly, Lucas stepped outside into the courtyard, clasped his hands together under the moonlight, and prayed sincerely, "It's so good to see my young master find happiness and joy. May Isabella and Olivia always be so in love and happy!"

Lucas Wright, whose family had served the Petersons for generations, bore the family’s loyalty and traditions deeply ingrained in his heart. Never marrying, he dedicated his life to caring for Isabella as if she were his own grandchild. Despite the social divide, his affection and concern were genuine and unwavering.

As he finished his prayer, tears glistened in Lucas's eyes.

The serene atmosphere of the estate was a testament to a peaceful, harmonious night.

The night stretched on, destined to bring joy to some and sorrow to others.

At the Nightshade Bar, Ethan King sat in a dim corner, drinking one glass after another.

Since that drunken phone call to Olivia Stewart, he found solace in the haze of alcohol.

"Being drunk is great, Olivia. When I'm drunk, I can think about you without restraint, declare my love without holding back, and I don’t have to control myself. If I want to see you, I can just go see you..." Ethan mumbled to himself, lost in his thoughts as he continued to drink.

He lifted his glass again, but it was empty.

Ethan glanced at his empty hand in confusion before shouting, "Where's my drink? Who took my drink?"

No one answered.

Ethan reached for another bottle nearby, only for a pale hand to snatch it away.

"Finally, you notice me?" Lisa, holding the bottle and a glass, looked down at Ethan, her expression equally displeased.

Ethan frowned, "Who do you think you are? Why should you care? Give me that bottle!"

Lisa slammed the bottle and glass down in front of him, her voice icy, "Drink! Drink yourself to death!"

Ethan grabbed the bottle and drank straight from it, "Gulp, gulp..."

Watching him, Lisa felt both anger and hurt, "Ethan, do you have any self-respect? What good is drinking yourself to death? Will Olivia care about you? She's probably with her guy right now, having the time of her life!"

Ethan's face twisted in anger, and he hurled the bottle at Lisa, "Get lost!"

Lisa barely dodged as the bottle shattered at her feet, spraying glass and wine like a blood-red flower in bloom.

Unable to dodge completely, Lisa felt the sting of glass and wine on her leg. Red streaks of blood mingled with the wine, staining her pale skin.

Lisa winced, her eyes brimming with tears as she looked pitifully at Ethan.

Ethan didn’t offer a word of concern, didn’t even raise his head. He acted as if Lisa wasn’t there, waving over a server, "Another bottle of wine!"

Lisa, abandoning her pride, sat opposite Ethan, reaching out to hold his hand, her voice softening, "Ethan, don’t do this to yourself. You weren’t always like this."

Ethan immediately withdrew his hand, looking at her with cold disdain, "You weren’t always like this either."

Lisa’s face turned pale.

Yes, she used to be as proud as a swan, never lowering herself to plead with Ethan. But now, realizing there was no place for her in Ethan's heart, she panicked.

Seeing him drink himself into misery over another woman, indifferent to her pain, she realized how much she cared for him.

The man she once dismissed and trampled on his pride was now exacting his revenge.

Lisa felt more pain in her heart than in her leg.

Desperately, she reached for Ethan’s warm hand again, using every bit of her pride to plead, "Ethan, please, let’s start over. Can we?"

Ethan pulled his hand away, his gaze icy, "Yes, we should start over. So from now on, you do you, and I do me. Stop bothering me."

"Ethan!" Lisa cried, unwilling to give up, "Is this all because of Olivia? She doesn’t even love you!"

Ethan’s eyes flashed coldly, "That’s my business. Now leave!"

Lisa’s carefully crafted facade broke, her expression twisted with anger, "No, I refuse to leave! Ethan, you’re mine, you’ll always be mine. Olivia, she’s…"
