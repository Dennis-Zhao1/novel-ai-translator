**I Won't Give Up on Isabella Peterson**

"Biological son? Ha! Hahaha..."

Alexander Peterson let out a strange, mocking laugh, followed by a burst of hearty laughter, as if he'd just heard the funniest joke ever.

"How could I possibly have a son? Impossible! Hahaha... it's just too funny!"

Perhaps Olivia Stewart's words, "I hate you," had struck Alexander Peterson a bit too hard. He seemed almost manic, shouting incoherently while mocking himself with a laugh that was both sharp and bitterly ironic.

Olivia Stewart quickly sensed that something was seriously off with Alexander Peterson. She bit her lip and exchanged a glance with Isabella Peterson.

Isabella Peterson pulled Olivia Stewart into a tight hug, keeping her away from Alexander Peterson, and gave her a reassuring look.

Some people only reveal their deepest secrets when they're at their most unhinged.

Regarding the child from back then, Alexander Peterson was the only one who knew the truth!

Sure enough, after Alexander Peterson finished laughing, he saw Olivia Stewart and Isabella Peterson standing there, looking utterly bewildered. A proud expression crossed his already colorless face.

"You all fell for it, didn't you? Haha! Isabella Peterson, did you know that when you went for the paternity test, the doctor was already on my payroll? He was my man! How does it feel to have been deceived for so many years?"

Isabella Peterson calmly looked at Alexander Peterson and said, "The doctor may have been bought, but the test result was real."

Alexander Peterson paused for a second, then quickly shook his head, "Impossible! No! There's no way! How could Tommy be my child?"

Olivia Stewart suddenly fixed a sharp gaze on Alexander Peterson's eyes, "Are you so sure he's not your son because you have some infertility issues?"

A flicker of gray flashed through Alexander Peterson's eyes, followed by a layer of anger.

His bloodshot eyes glared at Olivia Stewart, but he said nothing in his defense.

"Did I hit the nail on the head?" Olivia Stewart confidently challenged Alexander Peterson, "Back then, you gave Isabella Peterson a false infertility diagnosis, almost tearing us apart. Now I see, that diagnosis wasn't fake; the names were switched. The one who's truly infertile is you!"

Alexander Peterson's lips twitched into a slight smile of admiration, ignoring Isabella Peterson's expression, and he praised without hesitation, "My Olivia Stewart is indeed smart!"

Isabella Peterson lifted a foot and sent Alexander Peterson flying several feet away like a sack of potatoes, landing with a thud in another corner.

He regretted not finishing off Alexander Peterson back at the old house, considering some twisted sense of brotherhood, which allowed him to come back time and again to hurt Olivia Stewart and the kids!

But now, with Alexander Peterson in his grasp, there would be no more opportunity for him to commit evil!

After Alexander Peterson hit the ground, he remained silent for a long time.

Olivia Stewart covered her mouth with her hand, "Isabella Peterson, do you think he might be..."

"I know my limits!"

Isabella Peterson tightened his grip around Olivia Stewart's waist and signaled to the nearby bodyguards with a glance.

The bodyguard immediately went over, picked Alexander Peterson up, and dragged him back in front of Isabella Peterson.

Isabella Peterson's voice was icy, "Stop playing dead! I have more questions for you! Otherwise, I'll make sure you can't wake up even if you want to!"

Alexander Peterson remained motionless, his head drooped, curled up on the ground as if he hadn't heard a thing.

David Wright stepped forward, "Sir, should I get a bucket of ice water?"

Isabella Peterson nodded slightly.

Olivia Stewart furrowed her delicate brows.

"Alexander Peterson, if you're still conscious, I suggest you answer our questions properly. It'll save you some pain!"

As soon as she finished speaking, Alexander Peterson lifted his head and looked at Olivia Stewart, his eyes unusually clear.

"What do you want to ask?" His voice was unexpectedly gentle.

He knew that falling into Isabella Peterson's hands this time meant there was no escape. The only comfort was that he could talk to Olivia Stewart a bit more, see this woman he both loved and hated a bit longer.

Isabella Peterson glared at the tender emotions flowing from Alexander Peterson's eyes, feeling an urge to punch him again!

Olivia Stewart quickly pulled him back, signaling him to stay calm.

Olivia Stewart took a small step forward, staring at Alexander Peterson, "Are you really... infertile?"

It was quite embarrassing for her, as a sister-in-law, to ask her brother-in-law such a question, but without clarity, things could get really complicated!

Alexander Peterson averted his gaze and didn't answer.

In that brief moment when he turned his face away, Olivia Stewart clearly saw a flash of pain in his eyes.

That kind of pain when you love someone but can't have them!

Alexander Peterson thought that Olivia Stewart was despising him for not being a complete man!

Olivia Stewart bit her lower lip, frowned while thinking, then shook her head, muttering to herself, "But from the way Asha acted, it didn't seem like she was lying at all!"

Alexander Peterson's expression shifted, and he turned back to face her, "Who are you talking about?"

"A woman named Asha, do you remember her?"

Alexander Peterson's eyes darkened, cold as ice, "No memory of her!"

Olivia Stewart was furious and couldn't help but raise her voice, "Asha loved you so much, she even struggled to have your child alone. Did you know that?"

Alexander Peterson glanced at her, his smile carrying a hint of nonchalance, "Then did you know that I loved you so much I went crazy for you?"

Isabella Peterson suddenly pulled Olivia Stewart aside, blocking her behind his broad back, and tossed a manila envelope in front of Alexander Peterson, his voice as cold as if it had been soaked in icy water, "See for yourself!"

Alexander Peterson, somewhat puzzled, opened the envelope and pulled out the documents inside. The first page was the paternity test between him and Tommy.

Holding the test in his hand, Alexander Peterson quickly flipped to the last page, read the results, then went back and meticulously read every word several times. Slowly, his fingers began to tremble, and he murmured in disbelief, "How can this be? It can't be..."

"Why not?" Olivia Stewart interrupted him unceremoniously, "If Isabella Peterson's diagnosis was indeed yours, it only mentioned a very low survival rate for the little swimmers, not impossibility. This child is a blessing from above! Possibly the only child you'll ever have!"

"But what did you do? You left scars on his young body and mind, nearly taking his life!"

Alexander Peterson read the results again and again, finally lifting his gaze from Olivia Stewart's serene face to Isabella Peterson's cold and composed face, and suddenly he laughed.

"I got tired of this trick years ago. Do you really think that using it on me after you've suffered enough will work?"

Even though Alexander Peterson pretended to be indifferent, the defiant undertone in his voice was evident, showing that he was already shaken.

Isabella Peterson watched him with cold eyes, sharp as knives.

"This test was done at my request. Believe it or not! What matters to me now is, where is the child Olivia Stewart and I had back then?"

"Yeah, where's the child? For the sake of how I've taken care of Tommy all these years, just tell me!" Olivia Stewart's voice carried a hint of pleading, which made Isabella Peterson feel particularly uncomfortable!

Isabella Peterson held Olivia Stewart's hand tighter.

Alexander Peterson looked at Olivia Stewart, his narrow, gentle eyes showing a dreamy look.

He slightly curled his lips, "Olivia Stewart, if you come with me, I'll tell you!"

Olivia Stewart took a deep breath and quickly refused, "No way!"

Alexander Peterson chuckled sarcastically, "What? Don't you love that child? When Tommy was sent to you, you even considered leaving Isabella Peterson for him. Now you don't want the child?"

Olivia Stewart gave Alexander Peterson a cold look, "Back then, I wanted to take Tommy and leave because I thought he was your child, a testament to my betrayal of Isabella Peterson! Being around him made me feel guilty! But now that I know there was nothing between you and me, you have no idea how happy I am!"

"Alexander Peterson, even if you were a god on earth, I wouldn't give up on Isabella Peterson! You better give up on this fantasy!"

Isabella Peterson turned to look at Olivia Stewart, a gleam in his eyes.

Now, that's what I like to hear!

Girl, that's the spirit!

Compared to Isabella Peterson's exuberance, Alexander Peterson's face was ashen.

He finally realized that some people, some feelings, once missed, no amount of effort could retrieve or restore them.

Alexander Peterson looked at Olivia Stewart's delicate face.

Her features were still so exquisite, and with age, she'd gained a certain grace and allure.

But sadly, that warmth and liveliness in her eyes were no longer his to cherish!

"Do you really not care about that child? Whether he's alive or dead, you don't care?" Alexander Peterson roared in frustration.

"I do care!" Olivia Stewart answered frankly.

"But I also care about Isabella Peterson! Thanks to you, through all the back-and-forth torment about the child, I've learned that you can't neglect someone else who needs your care for the sake of one person you care about. If that child is still out there, I'll pray for his well-being! If he's not, I'll wish him peace and joy in heaven!"

After finishing, Olivia Stewart sniffled hard, turned around, and pulled Isabella Peterson's hand, "Let's go!"

Isabella Peterson, feeling overjoyed, let Olivia Stewart lead him out like a kid!

Just as they stepped onto the stairs, about to leave the basement, Alexander Peterson's low voice came from the corner, "The child... is no longer alive."

Olivia Stewart stopped in her tracks and, in the next second, quickly ran back to Alexander Peterson's side, "What did you say? Say it again!"

"I'm sorry, Olivia Stewart. That child... is gone."
