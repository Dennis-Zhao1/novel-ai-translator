Under the vast blue sky, the sandy beach was a canvas of tranquility, with only two young figures breaking the solitude amidst a massive heart-shaped cluster of roses. To ensure the filming went smoothly, the entire beach had been cleared, save for a few hidden cameras nestled within the flowers and drones disguised as floating balloons capturing the scene from above.

The shoot hadn't commenced yet, and Olivia Stewart stood at the center of the rose heart, her expression far from happy. Instead, she wore a pout, clearly annoyed. "Who on earth decided to wrap up filming on Valentine's Day?" she muttered under her breath. To top it off, Isabella Peterson hadn't even called her! It was their first Valentine's Day together since they'd become a couple, and Olivia had envisioned something more personal than a film set.

She contemplated stomping on the roses out of frustration but decided against it. After all, someone was proposing to her soon—even if it was just for the movie. But her thoughts wandered to when Isabella Peterson might actually propose to her. "Stop it, Olivia," she told herself, shaking her head to clear away the thoughts.

Just then, Tianyi, her co-star, approached her with a playful smile curling on his lips. His eyes, a captivating shade of deep blue, were like magnets pulling her in. Despite knowing it was all just an act, Olivia found herself swept up in the moment, her cheeks turning a soft pink with pretend bashfulness.

Tianyi took a step closer, flicked open a small, elegant box, and revealed a dazzling pink diamond ring that caught Olivia's breath. "Olivia, will you marry me?" he asked, his voice rich with emotion. He gracefully knelt on one knee, eyes filled with warmth and sincerity.

For a fleeting moment, Olivia could have sworn she saw Isabella in those blue eyes. "Yes, I will," she replied, her voice a whisper as her hand reached out, trembling slightly.

The scene was supposed to culminate with Tianyi lifting her up and spinning her around as flower petals rained down from the sky. But something unexpected happened. Instead of following the script, Tianyi removed the necklace he always wore and called out, "Olivia Stewart!"

The familiar voice startled her. Before she could react, his eyes, once filled with warmth, turned cold and dangerous as he lunged at her. Everything happened so fast. She found herself spinning, wrapped protectively in his arms, just as a sharp whistling sound cut through the air near her ear.

The realization hit her—if not for Tianyi's quick action, she might have been struck. Her heart raced with gratitude and lingering fear.

Then, more whistling sounds filled the air. A pained grunt and the splatter of something warm and sticky on her face brought a metallic tang to the breeze. "Tianyi!" she cried out, trying to see his face, but he held her tightly, shielding her.

A thud followed as the two of them hit the sandy ground, Tianyi's back soaking the roses with a deep crimson hue. "Tianyi, are you alright?" Olivia asked, panic rising in her voice. She lifted her head only to see his face, marred with blood, his eyes wounded.

"Help! Somebody, help us!" Olivia screamed, her voice breaking. In her frantic attempts to help, she accidentally pulled off Tianyi's wig, revealing his true identity beneath—Isabella Peterson.

Stunned, Olivia stared at the short black hair in disbelief. "No, it can't be..." she whispered, the realization dawning on her.

The crew rushed over, whisking Isabella away for emergency care, leaving Olivia shaken and covered in blood. Lucas Wright, a close friend, steadied her. "Olivia, you need to stay strong," he urged.

"Lucas, tell me, who is Tianyi really?" she demanded, clutching his shirt desperately. "He can't be Isabella Peterson, right? He was just playing a role. Tell me it isn't true!"

Before Lucas could respond, a doctor emerged from the operating room. "Isabella Peterson's eyes have been severely injured. We need to operate immediately, or he could lose his sight."

Lucas wasted no time, issuing orders for a medical team from Group Peterson to prepare for an airlift to a specialized facility. "We need to act fast," he told them, turning to Olivia. "Take care of her," he instructed Amy Green.

Olivia, though shaken, insisted on staying with Isabella. "I'm going with him," she declared, her determination unwavering.

Amy Green, another close friend, tried to reassure her. "Olivia, listen carefully. Everything that happened was part of a plan Isabella had to rekindle your memories. This proposal wasn't just a scene; it was real."

The revelation left Olivia reeling. She glanced at the ring on her finger, her heart aching. "All of this, it was for me... And he got hurt because of it."

Amy explained further, "The attack was aimed at him. The first shot was a diversion. Isabella knew it was coming but chose to protect you instead."

As the gravity of the situation sank in, Olivia's mind raced to identify who could be behind such an attack. A face flashed in her mind, and she knew.

"I'm going to see this through," Olivia said, her voice steady. "I'll stay by Isabella's side, no matter what."

With Amy's reassurance and the support of her friends, Olivia boarded the plane, ready to face whatever lay ahead with Isabella Peterson—her love, her partner, and the man who had risked everything for her.

As the plane took off, Olivia sat beside Isabella's unconscious form, holding his hand tightly. "You really fooled me, you know," she whispered, a mix of love and frustration in her voice. "But we'll get through this together."
