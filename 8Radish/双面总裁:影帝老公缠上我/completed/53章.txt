So, should we give him a wedding gift?

"Actually, I want to get back that bracelet. It's the only thing my mom left me. I'll be with you for a year, and in return, you give me Ethan King's information and that bracelet. Deal?" Olivia Stewart proposed, leaning forward with determination.

Isabella Peterson pondered for a moment, resting her chin on her hands, and then agreed, "Alright."

Olivia immediately stretched out her hand, "Then hand it over!"

"After the year is up," Isabella replied smoothly.

"What? Isabella, you are a real businesswoman, always shrewd and calculating. If something happens to Ethan King and you wait a year to give me the info, it'll be too late!"

"You really are still hung up on that guy, huh?"

"He helped me when I was at my lowest, and I can't just stand by and watch him get into trouble now," Olivia argued passionately.

Isabella chuckled, "You're getting all worked up over there, but maybe he's just enjoying his wedding night!"

"Wedding night? Isabella, what do you mean?" Olivia demanded, her eyes narrowing.

"See for yourself!" Isabella tossed a stack of documents towards Olivia, her voice laced with sarcasm. "You don't even know his real name, yet you call him a friend! If you ask me, he's just a big fraud!"

Olivia's eyes widened as she skimmed through the documents, shock written all over her face.

Oh my goodness! How did I end up surrounded by rich heirs?

Isabella Peterson is one, and even Ethan King, or rather, Gu Feng, is one!

"Ethan King, real name Gu Feng, is the sole heir of the Gu family, a prominent family in Australia with large livestock and dairy businesses in multiple countries. He's been model material since he was a kid and grew up to be a famous model."

Olivia's eyes grew even wider. So, the guy she thought was just a wannabe is actually the world-renowned model Gu Feng!

He had always claimed to be a Gu Feng impersonator, and she never doubted him. She even teased him about being worlds apart, only to find out he was the real deal, living under the same roof as her!

And they were supposed to be friends!

Olivia continued reading.

"After his first girlfriend cheated on him, Ethan King lost interest in women."

Ethan King had a girlfriend once? Olivia thought, slightly surprised but also understanding. People sometimes change after a heartbreak.

"Mr. Gu wants Gu Feng to marry and take over the family business. Gu Feng ran away to Golden City, living under an alias and taking small modeling gigs to get by. The Gu family has been searching for him worldwide, offering a huge reward..."

So, Ethan King was just taken back by his dad.

Olivia felt a mixture of relief and heaviness in her heart. Ethan King might not be in danger, but he certainly wouldn't be happy.

Unfortunately, there was nothing she could do to help. He's in Australia, and interfering in a forced marriage is not something one should do, right?

"So, are you going to prepare a wedding gift? I can deliver it for you!" Isabella's voice was teasing, filled with schadenfreude.

Olivia sighed, "Isabella, you know how awful being forced into marriage feels. Why make snide remarks? Besides, you know Ethan King isn't interested in women."

"Hmph, that guy might seem uninterested, but he's just putting on an act to make you lower your guard. He's got some cunning ideas in that head of his!"

Olivia didn't want to argue with Isabella anymore. She looked up from the documents and extended her hand, "My bracelet?"

"After the year is up!" Isabella insisted.

"You! Isabella!" Olivia exclaimed in frustration.

"What if you take it and leave, backing out of the deal? I need some guarantee, don't I?"

"Fine, a year it is, but during that time, you can't force me into anything!"

Isabella's expression shifted, "Don't worry, I have my standards. I wouldn't touch someone with a history like you."

He really minded!

Olivia felt like someone had stabbed her in the chest, the pain making her speechless.

Olivia wanted to ask, "Isabella, if you mind so much, why do you want me to be with you?"

But in the end, she said nothing, turning away silently.

Isabella watched her retreating figure, his hand clenching tightly by his side.

When Olivia rejected the idea of being forced, his pride kicked in, and he retorted without thinking.

Yet as soon as he spoke, he realized how harsh he sounded.

Olivia looked so hurt, like a wounded deer, but he couldn't bring himself to apologize.

Proud Isabella never apologizes.

For the next two days, they ignored each other entirely.

But this silence was driving Lucas Wright crazy.

He had worked so hard to bring Olivia into Isabella's life, and now their relationship seemed colder than ever.

This can't go on!

Lucas paced around, instructing the staff to prepare a candlelit dinner in the dining room with the flower garden and fish pond that Olivia loved.

Silver candlesticks held smokeless candles, casting a romantic glow.

A large bouquet of roses graced the table, surrounded by exquisite dishes and a stylish wine rack holding vintage wine.

Lucas had all the extra chairs removed, leaving just two white high-backed chairs close together.

When Olivia and Isabella walked in, Olivia couldn't help but feel a little surprised.

"Lucas, is today special or something?"

"Uh..." Lucas, though old, was quick-witted, and he smiled broadly before speaking.

"Today is the day the celestial lovers meet on the bridge of magpies."

After saying this, Lucas nervously glanced at Isabella, worried his initiative might upset his master.

Isabella casually took a seat, and Lucas's heart settled.

Lucas quickly pulled out the other chair for Olivia, "Olivia, please, have a seat!"

Olivia glanced at Isabella and then sat down, her eyes fixed on the roses, her cheeks slowly turning red.

Lucas had arranged everything with a clear intention.

Lucas gestured, and all the other servants quietly left the room. He was the last to leave, thoughtfully closing the curved glass door behind him.

Now, only Isabella and Olivia remained in the vast dining room.

Despite sitting close, they were silent, neither looking at the other nor speaking.

The room was quiet, filled with a faint floral scent, while colorful fish swam below their feet.

It was a romantic setting, perfect for nurturing feelings.

Olivia felt increasingly uncomfortable, her heart pounding, breath quickening.

Her hands clutched her dress, palms sweaty.

For some reason, being alone with Isabella made her anxious, as if the air itself thinned in his presence.

Isabella suddenly glanced at her, reaching for the wine bottle. He poured himself half a glass, then elegantly sipped, his movements exuding a refined grace.

But after two days of cold silence, Olivia was still upset, turning away, refusing to acknowledge him.

Isabella glanced at her again, his eyes deep and unreadable.

As Olivia reached for the wine bottle, she hesitated, pulling back.

Isabella silently poured her half a glass too.

Olivia stared at his hand holding the bottle, mesmerized.

A handsome guy is handsome in every respect, even his hands look good, she thought.

After pouring, Isabella continued sipping his wine, lost in thought.

Olivia took a sip, finding the wine sweet with a hint of bitterness, much like her current mood.

She understood Isabella's feelings. Who wouldn't want their beloved to be pure and perfect?

Just like her own conflict, accepting her role as a stand-in, yet a thorn of doubt always remained, occasionally pricking her heart.

Olivia took another sip, enjoying the bittersweet taste more and more.

Soon, her glass was empty, and she boldly filled it again, sipping eagerly.

Isabella watched her rosy cheeks with a hint of helpless indulgence.

She really thinks wine is juice. Too bad about her alcohol tolerance...

Recalling the first time he saw her drunk, Isabella shook his head.

"Sir..." Lucas's voice interrupted, his white-haired head peeking into the dining room, looking awkward and hesitant.

Isabella's expression cooled, "What is it?"

"Your father called."

Lucas wouldn't dare interrupt otherwise!

Isabella stood to take the call, Lucas following him out, leaving Olivia alone, happily sipping her wine.

Mr. Peterson was a traditional, stern man. He rarely meddled in Isabella's affairs but expected obedience in matters he deemed important.

The failed engagement with White Mia had already displeased him. Now, hearing about Isabella's new companion, he was quick to scold.

His message was clear: with a marriage contract in place, Isabella should keep his affairs discreet.

Flings were tolerable, but bringing someone home was unacceptable!

After hanging up, Isabella's mood was sour.

Returning to the dining room, he found the table empty, his brow furrowing in confusion. Where did she go?

Just then, a servant's panicked voice echoed from outside, "Someone's trying to jump!"
