"The Heartthrob Likes to Play with Hair"

"What did you just say?" Skylar asked, arching an eyebrow.

"Um, I was just wondering if you... you know, fell for Olivia Stewart at first sight?"

"What do you think?" Skylar replied, tossing the question back to the reporter with a nonchalant smile.

The reporter, usually quick with words, found himself at a loss. Who would dare speculate on the heartthrob's personal feelings?

The other journalists exchanged glances, unsure how to pen tomorrow's headlines from such a vague answer. Skylar was notoriously private, never a subject of gossip. But holding Olivia Stewart's hand was newsworthy on its own. Still, if they spun the story wrong and upset him, their careers in entertainment journalism could be over.

Rumors had whispered that Skylar might be in a relationship with the powerful film mogul, Mr. Billion, but this was never accepted by his female fan base. Yet, as journalists, they had to consider Mr. Billion's feelings.

While the reporters mulled over their predicament, another one stood up, shifting focus to Olivia Stewart. "Olivia, what do you think of your co-star Skylar?"

All eyes turned to Olivia, hoping she would offer more than Skylar's elusive replies. She tensed up, feeling the pressure.

This time, Skylar didn't jump in to help; he seemed amused by her predicament.

Faced with the microphone, Olivia took a deep breath. "I think he's great!"

"Could you be more specific?" The reporter pressed on.

"Uh... he's kind and really looks out for newcomers. As a seasoned actor..."

Skylar's expression darkened slightly. When did he become 'seasoned'?

"In short, getting to act with Skylar is a real win for me!" Olivia finished, flashing a sweet smile.

Her candidness earned applause from the audience. Skylar couldn't help but smile.

"Olivia Stewart!"

"Olivia Stewart..."

"Please, tell us more, Olivia Stewart..."

The reporters were relentless, eager to dig deeper into her thoughts.

Skylar glanced at the host, who quickly caught his cue. "Alright, everyone, let's focus on our upcoming show, 'Send an Angel to Love You.' With such a stellar cast, don't you want to hear more about their perspectives?"

Understanding the deflection, the journalists turned their attention to other cast members, hoping to find some juicy tidbits elsewhere.

Relieved, Olivia exhaled deeply. These reporters could turn white into black with just a pen and a voice. Her past scandals from film school were proof enough of that. Thankfully, she had Skylar to shield her now.

Olivia had worried Skylar might look down on her as a rookie, but he had been surprisingly supportive. She turned and gave him a grateful smile.

Skylar's lips twitched into a smile, but he quickly remembered he wasn't himself right now; he was the actor "Skylar." Why was he pleased about another man making her smile?

"Skylar, what's up?" Olivia asked, noticing his odd expression.

"Nothing," he said, forcing a smile. "Let's grab a seat over there and watch the fun."

"Okay."

As they settled into the guest seats, Olivia watched the actors skillfully handle the reporters. Skylar, meanwhile, absentmindedly played with Olivia's long hair, wrapping it around his fingers and releasing it to watch it unfurl.

"Skylar, look at that..." Olivia started, but winced as her scalp tugged. "Ow!"

She looked down to see her hair tangled around Skylar's fingers. "Hey, what are you doing?"

Caught, Skylar's face flashed with embarrassment. "Just bored."

"Bored enough to use my hair as a toy? You're like..."

"Like who?" Skylar paused, intrigued.

"Just... never mind," Olivia mumbled, her cheeks flushing.

Skylar's eyes twinkled with teasing curiosity. "A boyfriend?"

Olivia looked down shyly. "Sort of."

This little rascal!

"A boyfriend is a boyfriend. What's 'sort of'?"

"Well, in my heart, he's my boyfriend. But I don't know if he sees me as his girlfriend. I'm just a shadow of the woman he truly loves."

Skylar's fingers paused at her words.

"Ouch! You're pulling my hair again!"

"Sorry!" Skylar quickly released her hair.

It seemed Olivia still didn't recognize his true identity. She saw him as a rival in love, unaware of their shared past. What had happened to make her forget? Even Michael Wright's exhaustive investigations had turned up nothing. Who could have covered it up so thoroughly?

Seeing Skylar's silence, Olivia thought he felt guilty for hurting her. She smiled, patting his shoulder. "It's okay, it doesn't hurt anymore."

Skylar chuckled, reaching for her hair again.

Olivia playfully pulled her hair away. "Stop it! If my boyfriend sees you, he'll get jealous. This is his thing!"

Honestly, Skylar wasn't too worried about Olivia's boyfriend, but if Isabella Peterson was lurking somewhere, he didn't want to end up in trouble. If he couldn't even show up on set because of some silly drama... now that would be embarrassing.

Skylar watched Olivia focus back on the stage, her admiration for the actors evident. He couldn't help but find her endearing, even if she was clueless about the backstage envy she stirred.

On stage, the journalists were interviewing Lisa, the second female lead. Despite being a celebrated actress, Lisa had taken a secondary role in this project. A bitter pill to swallow, especially when the lead was a newbie like Olivia.

But Lisa maintained her composure, answering with grace untilâ€”

"Lisa, you're about the same age as Olivia, yet you're playing her mother-in-law. How do you feel about taking on a role that's so much older?"

The question was a bit of a low blow. Lisa's smile nearly faltered.

Yet, being a seasoned pro, Lisa quipped, "I guess I'll be the most charming mother-in-law in film history!"

The audience erupted in laughter and applause.

Olivia admired her poise. "Wow, she's amazing! I need to learn from her."

Skylar couldn't help but chuckle at Olivia's naive admiration. Little did she know, Lisa probably wanted to strangle her.

Sure enough, Lisa shifted the focus back to Olivia and Skylar, teasingly lamenting, "No matter how charming I am, my future daughter-in-law steals the show, winning over my aloof son while leaving me alone on stage."

The audience laughed again, but the spotlight was back on Olivia and Skylar.

Suddenly, a reporter stood up, eager to ask, "Skylar, do you plan to use a body double for your scenes in this movie?"

"No body double," Skylar replied calmly, his words echoing through the room.

The reporters exchanged surprised looks. Everyone knew Skylar was a germaphobe, especially avoiding contact with actresses. He had used body doubles for intimate scenes in the past. But this time, he said no body double. Did that mean Skylar was doing all the scenes himself?

This revelation sent the room buzzing with excitement.

"Skylar, do you mean you haven't found a suitable double, or are you not planning to use one at all?" a female reporter asked, her voice trembling with anticipation.

Skylar took Olivia's hand and stood up...
