Title: Chasing Olivia

Ethan King flashed a playful grin, clearly not taking life too seriously. "Hey, if my face doesn't do the trick, I'll just rely on my charm."

Olivia Stewart rolled her eyes internally. Sometimes Ethan talked like he was planning a career as a gigolo.

"If you really feel bad, just give me a kiss," Ethan teased.

"Get lost!" Olivia retorted, her guilt evaporating in the face of his cheeky smile.

As they strolled out of the dense woods, Ethan kept sneaking glances at Olivia, like he had something on his mind but couldn't quite bring himself to say it.

Olivia finally stopped, exasperated. "Quit being all secretive and just ask me already!"

Ethan hesitated, trying to muster the courage. "Did... did anything happen to you? I mean, were you hurt?"

Olivia snorted. "What do you think?"

"Olivia, remember what they say—if you can't escape a situation, try to enjoy it. In today's world, that kind of thing isn't as big a deal as it used to be."

"You've watched too many movies," Olivia snapped, cutting him off. "Nothing happened, okay?"

"So, it was all voluntary, then?" Ethan's voice had a hint of bitterness. "I mean, Isabella Peterson is quite the catch. Who wouldn't be interested?"

"You're such a drama queen!" Olivia exclaimed, grabbing Ethan's ear and shaking it. "Do I look like someone who'd just throw herself at any attractive person?"

"No, no!" Ethan protested, trying to escape her grip. "But you did agree to room with me because you thought I was handsome."

Olivia felt a little embarrassed being called out. She released his ear with a twist. "Sure, I appreciate a good-looking face, but have I ever done anything to you?"

"I'd kind of like it if you did!" Ethan joked.

Olivia shot him a puzzled look. "I think you're actually acting more normal lately."

"I've always been normal! Anyway, did anything happen with Isabella or not?"

"Nothing happened between us, alright?"

"That's a relief!" Ethan's mood brightened instantly.

"Surprised he didn't make a move," Ethan mused aloud. "Is he some kind of saint?"

"Isabella has a serious issue with germs—both physically and mentally. He thinks I'm gross," Olivia said, turning away with a touch of sadness.

Ethan smacked himself on the forehead and hurried after her. "Olivia, wait up!"

They continued on their way, Ethan helping Olivia avoid the occasional thorn or branch in the path.

Once they reached the highway leading back to the Gold City, Olivia looked back at the forest. It was a restricted nature reserve, no wonder it was so pristine. Isabella must have wanted to teach her a lesson by leaving her there, she mused.

That peculiar, stubborn man! Olivia and Ethan caught a ride back to the city, leaving the forest—and any lingering melancholy—behind them.

For Olivia, it felt like waking up from a surreal, beautiful dream. A brief pang of regret, then back to reality.

Meanwhile, back at the castle, Isabella Peterson was in a foul mood. Anyone who crossed his path faced his wrath, from his personal staff to the gardeners and stablehands. Isabella was like a storm cloud ready to burst.

Lucas Wright returned to find the staff fleeing the castle as if it were on fire. Sighing, he braced himself for a tense meeting with Isabella.

He searched the entire estate, finally finding Isabella in the wine cellar, surrounded by empty bottles and nursing a fresh one. A tablet nearby played footage of Olivia and Ethan leaving the forest.

Lucas felt a deep concern etched on his face. "Sir, you should slow down. Your health is important."

"Health? What good is health?" Isabella downed another swig. "If I were sick, at least she might take care of me."

Lucas gently took the bottle from Isabella. "Sir, the doctors advised against drinking post-surgery. I've served the Peterson family all my life, and I can't bear to see you suffer."

Isabella glared at him. "So, you think I'm a wreck too? I spent five years rebuilding myself, just to show her. And now she's gone, off with another guy."

Isabella, normally reserved, couldn't stop once he started talking. He slapped Lucas on the back, a sloppy camaraderie in his gesture. "Old man, when I first saw her, all I could think was how much I wanted her. But I couldn't force her. And knowing she had other boyfriends just... it bothers me."

Lucas knew Isabella's perfectionist tendencies and tried to console him. "Sir, maybe it's time to let the past go."

"Five years, and it's still here," Isabella tapped his chest. "I can't stand the thought of being forgotten by her."

"You don't understand what she means to me," Isabella's eyes were distant, reflecting on a past Lucas couldn't fully grasp.

"When you're told you have a year left to live during the prime of your life, the world goes dark. Then she came, a light in the darkness. She was my light, and she left me."

His voice softened, vulnerability seeping through his usual stoic facade.

"Was I not good enough? She wanted wealth, I made enough for ten lifetimes. She wanted a castle, I built her a kingdom. This place, isn't it beautiful? I even tried to become the kind of romantic hero she liked in stories. But she forgot me."

"She disliked my frail health back then. I became stronger, ready to give her everything, but she wouldn't give me a chance."

Isabella's frustration boiled over, a stark contrast to his usual calm demeanor.

Lucas watched, heart heavy. Isabella had never been so despondent, not even right after Olivia—then known as White—left.

Back then, he focused on becoming everything she valued, waiting for her to return and reconcile. But five years passed, and she never came.

"Maybe we should forget the past too?" Lucas suggested hesitantly.

"Forget the past? Just because she did?" Isabella asked incredulously.

"No, sir. I mean, Olivia doesn't remember. So perhaps you could meet her as she is now, as Olivia Stewart. Win her over anew, and maybe she'll remember."

"You want me to chase her?" Isabella asked, bewildered.

Lucas felt the weight of his advice. "Chasing someone isn't shameful."

"What did you say? Repeat that!"

"Uh, pursuing someone is natural. Throughout history, men have pursued women. It's as normal as eating or drinking, unrelated to pride."

"Fine, I'll chase her. And when I win her over, I'll make her pay for forgetting me!"

Lucas couldn't help but worry for Olivia, seeing the determination in Isabella's eyes.

"Do you even know how to chase someone?" Isabella asked, suddenly looking at Lucas for advice.

Lucas, a lifelong bachelor with little experience, wondered what he could possibly teach Isabella about romance.
