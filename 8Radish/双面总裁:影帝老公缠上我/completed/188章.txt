Once upon a time, Isabella Peterson was having a day that could only be described as "not great." The whole ordeal started with Olivia Stewart and a little misunderstanding involving Lucas Wright, Isabella's loyal but occasionally bumbling old butler. Lucas had been caught by Olivia sending a video, which she took entirely the wrong way. Olivia thought Lucas was trying to flirt with some older woman, and things just spiraled from there. Isabella was left waiting, and waiting, and waiting for an update from Lucas that never came, which left him in a mood foul enough to cut off the long-winded report from manager Wu.

Wu, poor guy, had no idea what he'd done to deserve the CEO's impatience. He stuttered and stammered, trying to find his footing as Isabella dismissed him with a wave. Isabella commanded the assistant department to take notes and stomped out of the meeting, leaving the board members in a collective state of shock. This was unprecedented—Isabella Peterson walking out of such an important meeting!

Once outside, Isabella hopped into his sleek Aston Martin and drove like a bat out of hell back to his estate. He parked the car with little ceremony and made a beeline for the sunroom, where Lucas Wright stood waiting. Upon seeing Isabella's approach, Lucas made a hasty bow, but Isabella silenced him with a gesture.

Inside, Olivia Stewart was deep in concentration, sculpting a small clay figure on a marble table. Isabella's heart settled at the sight of her, and he couldn't help but slow his pace, taking in the peaceful scene.

Passing Lucas, Isabella leaned in, whispering, "What's going on, old man?"

Lucas, looking sheepish, confessed, "Olivia caught me with the video. She thought I was flirting with an older woman, so I had to stop."

Isabella's face was a kaleidoscope of emotions before finally landing on amusement. He clapped a hand on Lucas's shoulder, nearly knocking him over. "Old man, go ahead and give yourself a raise!"

Lucas, rubbing his shoulder, was secretly pleased. He didn't need more money, but it was nice to know his efforts were appreciated. Little did he know, the video he'd sent was exactly what had Isabella's heart all aflutter.

Meanwhile, Olivia was putting the final touches on her clay masterpiece, a miniature version of Isabella himself. Isabella recognized the figure immediately, and a grin spread across his face. This was a far cry from Olivia's last attempt, which had been so ugly it was almost endearing. This one, though, was a spitting image of him, captured in all his aloof glory.

Olivia, stretching her arms with a satisfied smile, didn't notice Isabella's approach until he was right beside her, examining the clay figure with faux disdain. "This ugly thing? I wouldn't take it if you paid me."

Despite his words, Isabella held the clay figure tightly, clearly not intending to let it go. Olivia, sensing a game, responded with playful sarcasm, "Yeah, it's hideous. Absolutely unwatchable."

Isabella's face darkened at her cheeky comment, and he squeezed the clay figure a bit too hard, prompting Olivia to shout, "Hey, careful! It's fragile!"

Realizing his mistake, Isabella eased his grip, feigning indifference. "It's just clay. Why so worked up?"

Taking advantage of his distraction, Olivia snatched the figure back. "If you don't like it, I might as well make something fun like a cat or a dog!"

Isabella finally caught on. "Wait, you made this for me?"

"Who said I did?" Olivia retorted, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "This ugly thing isn't fit for someone as high and mighty as you."

Isabella, taken aback by his own earlier arrogance, found himself speechless. Olivia was relentless, and Isabella realized he'd dug himself into a hole with his earlier bravado.

But admitting defeat was not in Isabella's nature. "Hand it over," he demanded, reaching for the sculpture.

Olivia backed away, guarding her creation. "Why should I?"

"It's a gift for me, isn't it? So give it here."

"You'd love that, wouldn't you? But I'm not giving it to someone who doesn't appreciate my work."

"Come on, Olivia, you know how I feel about it." Isabella's voice softened, but his posture remained firm.

Before he could make another move, Olivia blurted out, "I was going to let it dry and fire it before giving it to you…"

She trailed off, her cheeks turning a shade of red that even the setting sun couldn't match. She'd revealed more than she'd intended, and Isabella caught onto her slip instantly.

"You were going to what?"

Caught in her own words, Olivia couldn't help but smile sheepishly, "Well, I wanted it to be perfect, okay?"

Isabella's expression shifted from smugness to a softer, warmer look. "Perfect, huh? For me?"

Olivia nodded, her earlier bravado melting away under Isabella's gaze.

"Then I promise to treat it like the masterpiece it is," Isabella said, his smile genuine now, "but only if I can take it home once it's ready."

Olivia laughed, her earlier tension dissipating like morning mist. "Okay, it's a deal. But just remember, it's still my little creation until it's ready."

With that, the two shared a moment of understanding, surrounded by the gentle glow of the sunroom's lights, as the evening settled around them like a comfortable old blanket.
