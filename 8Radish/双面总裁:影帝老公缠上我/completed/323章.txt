Grace Martin was pacing back and forth, her anxiety levels skyrocketing. The moment White Jin Song returned with Olivia Stewart's hair sample, she rushed to have it tested, secretly including a sample from Bai Miaomiao for good measure. The next afternoon, Grace received the results of the expedited DNA test. 

The moment her eyes scanned the paper, the world seemed to spin, and she blacked out, collapsing to the floor. The test revealed that Olivia Stewart was indeed her biological daughter, while Bai Miaomiao had no blood relation to her whatsoever. 

It was evident that during that fateful trip back to the countryside, Sophia Allen hadn't just swiped her bracelet—she had swapped their children! 

Upon regaining consciousness after emergency medical attention, Grace Martin was inconsolable, crying uncontrollably. White Jin Song was equally stunned, standing there dumbfounded, as if struck by lightning. 

Grace lunged at him, grabbing his hair and hitting him while cursing hoarsely, “This is all your fault! You old fool! Our real daughter ended up suffering because of that vile woman, Sophia Allen! Meanwhile, her brat got to live in luxury as the heiress of the White family!”

She lamented, “Oh, what have I done? For that vile woman's daughter, I almost had my own daughter harmed! I tried to run her over, and even considered more horrible things. I... I...” Grace was so overwhelmed with rage and sorrow that she passed out again.

“Chloe Wright! Chloe Wright! Don’t scare me like this!” White Jin Song desperately tried to revive her.

After a while, Grace slowly opened her eyes, tears streaming down her face as she stared at the ceiling. “What’s the point of living after committing such sins?” she murmured.

Initially, she had hoped Olivia Stewart was her daughter to convince her to donate a kidney. But faced with the harsh truth, she found herself lacking the courage to continue living. How could she possibly face her own daughter after all the harm she had done?

White Jin Song, noticing the despair in Grace's eyes, panicked and tried to reason with her. “You can’t give up like this! We haven’t gotten to the bottom of things yet. Besides, our child is alive and well. She’s married to a remarkable man and has given you two adorable grandchildren, twins!”

His words sparked a glimmer of hope in Grace. She realized she couldn't just give up without at least trying to reconnect with her daughter.

Grace Martin, known for never backing down, decided it was time to find the maid who had been in charge of Bai Miaomiao all those years ago. “We need to find out what really happened,” she declared.

White Jin Song assured her, “You should rest. Let me handle the search.”

Grace gave him a stern look. “Be quick about it! We need to have all the facts before approaching our daughter. We have to prove ourselves; otherwise, Olivia Stewart might think we're lying.”

It turned out that the maid had resigned shortly after returning to the White family and had since vanished without a trace. White Jin Song tracked down the old records and discovered a faded address, but upon reaching the remote village, found that the family had long since moved away. 

It was evident that the maid must have known about the child swap but, fearing retribution from Grace, had fled. 

Left with no other options, Grace decided to take the DNA test results and personally visit Olivia Stewart. Even if her daughter refused to donate a kidney, at least hearing her call her "Mom" would be something.

Meanwhile, at home, Olivia Stewart was playing with her son, Tommy, who was growing increasingly withdrawn, spending more time alone with his building blocks. Olivia could only offer her silent companionship, hoping to comfort him.

Suddenly, the sound of crying echoed through the garden. Olivia looked up to see her daughter, Gigi, struggling in the nanny’s arms, her little face scrunched up in tears. Gigi had a cold and was refusing her medicine, crying so much that her voice was hoarse.

Olivia’s heart ached at the sight. She gently touched Tommy's head, reassuring him, “Your sister is sick. I’ll be right back, okay?”

Tommy continued to build his blocks, seemingly oblivious to her words. 

Olivia hurried outside, taking her daughter into her arms. “Oh, my little one, why are you crying so much?” she cooed softly. 

Gigi snuggled into her mother’s embrace, her cries soon turning into sniffles. Olivia took the medicine and coaxed her gently, “You need to take your medicine to get better. After that, I’ll take you to see the flowers, okay?”

Understanding only the promise of flowers, Gigi nodded and took the medicine. 

“Wow, you’re amazing, Olivia!” the nanny sighed in relief. 

With Gigi snuggled in her arms, Olivia felt a warm wave of love and promised, “Let’s go see the flowers.” 

Her daughter’s laughter filled the garden, a sweet sound that Olivia cherished. Tommy watched from inside, his face a mix of his father's features, showing a hint of cold detachment.

Just then, Lucas Wright approached Olivia with a concerned expression. “Olivia, we have a situation. Your parents, the Whites, are asking to see you.”

Olivia frowned, “I told you I don’t want to see them.”

“I know,” Lucas replied. “But they’re at the gate, begging for your forgiveness. They’re claiming you’re their biological daughter, switched at birth.”

Startled, Olivia raised an eyebrow. “Switched at birth?”

“Yes,” Lucas confirmed. “They say you’re Grace Martin’s real daughter. That’s why I didn’t make a decision without consulting you.”

Sensing there might be more to the story, Olivia handed Gigi to the nanny and instructed Lucas, “Bring them in. Let’s see what nonsense they’re up to now.”

Inside the living room, Olivia awaited the arrival of White Jin Song and Grace Martin, who were soon escorted in by the staff.

“Olivia, I’m your mother!” Grace cried, rushing towards her.

Olivia recoiled, “My mother died a long time ago, Mrs. White. Did you forget your meds today?”

Grace, visibly pained, struggled to speak. White Jin Song quickly intervened, “Chloe, calm down. You’re scaring her.”

Grace retreated, wiping her tears, and took a moment to really look at Olivia. The girl was beautiful, her features delicate and pure, so much like her younger self. She had always detested Olivia, believing her to be Sophia Allen’s daughter, but now she regretted not taking a closer look.

Grace Martin was filled with remorse, wondering how she could possibly make amends for past mistakes.
