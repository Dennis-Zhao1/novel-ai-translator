Title: A Farewell to the Past

---

"Wait for me to grow up and marry you, okay?" Those were the innocent words spoken by young Faye years ago, her big eyes full of hope and dreams.

Fast forward two years, and the scene is set with Faye chirping excitedly, "Finally, we're going home to see Dad! It's been so long, I bet he's gotten even more handsome!" She buzzed around like a little hummingbird, her excitement infectious, as she twirled in the fresh country air.

Behind her trailed her twin brother, Kyle, dutifully dragging along two small suitcases. He was the practical one, always reminding, "Watch out for rocks!"

Bringing up the rear was Olivia Stewart, deep in conversation with Ethan King. They walked a little slower, lost in their own world of adult responsibilities and unspoken emotions.

Faye sprinted up a small hill, turning back to shout, "Hurry up, you grown-ups are so slow!" Her impatience was met with a gentle smile from Olivia, who quickened her pace at the little girl's urging.

After spending almost three years at the ranch, Olivia had finally emerged from the shadows of her past. But now, as she prepared to leave, she realized how much she had grown attached to the place — and especially to the man by her side, Ethan. Despite everything, she felt she had nothing to offer him, a realization that filled her with guilt.

These complicated feelings were beyond the understanding of the three-year-old Faye. Her mind was set on giving her handsome dad a big surprise.

Kyle, standing at the bottom of the hill, watched Olivia and Ethan walking closely together. A flicker of displeasure crossed his serious little face. He had inherited his mother Isabella's deep, soulful eyes, and even at his young age, there was a striking resemblance in demeanor. His cool, aloof nature was like a mirror of hers.

For three years, Isabella might have been away, but with mini-Isabella around, Olivia could never truly forget him.

Reaching the edge of the ranch, they saw the helipad ahead, with the private jet sent by Isabella waiting patiently. Olivia paused, turning to face Ethan, her eyes misty as she offered him a soft smile. "Ethan, thank you for everything."

Ethan raised an eyebrow, a playful grin on his face. "As long as you're still calling me 'Ethan,' it means our friendship hasn't changed. I'm your best friend, no need for thanks."

Olivia blinked away her tears, trying to maintain her composure. "Still, these past three years..."

Her voice choked up, unable to continue.

Ethan watched her, his expression gentle. "If you're so moved, why not stay?"

Olivia's eyes widened in surprise. "I'm sorry, Ethan, you know I..."

He cut her off with a wry smile. "I'm just joking. Look at you, all tense!"

Relieved, Olivia wiped her eyes, returning his smile with a small one of her own.

Ethan reached out, smoothing her wind-tousled hair, his voice low and sincere. "Olivia, whether you go back to be with Isabella or not, whether you spend your life with him or someone else, I won't stop you. Don't feel like you owe me anything."

"But," he added, a teasing glint in his eye, "if you ever want to return, the ranch doors are always open. And if Isabella ever treats you poorly, just kick him to the curb — my arms are always open for you!"

He continued, "If you need me for a moment, I'll be there for a moment. If you need me for a lifetime, I'll be there for a lifetime. Remember that, okay?"

"Okay," Olivia nodded, giving him a quick, tight hug before stepping back.

Ethan looked at the empty space where she had been, feeling a pang of emptiness within himself.

"Olivia," he said, meeting her eyes, "if I could've chosen back then, I would rather have remained withdrawn than come to you. Because I knew once I got better, I would leave. It's unfair to you! I hope you find your own happiness and someone to share your life with, but I know that person isn't me."

Ethan's smile was bittersweet. "Olivia, you're harsh! I understand that too, but did you have to say it out loud? Let me tell you my choice then: even if Isabella hadn't found me, I would have found a way to take you away. For me, having you so close but out of reach, spending years together only to watch you leave without a backward glance, is cruel."

"But I have no regrets. Even if I never have you, at least I have these years to remember."

"Olivia, boldly pursue your happiness and live the life you want! Just like I can't force your choices, you can't stop my hopes. You live your life, and I'll hold onto my dreams. Who says waiting for happiness isn't a form of happiness?"

Olivia turned slightly, a single tear escaping to be caught by the wind. This man, who found happiness in waiting, left her with a debt she felt she could never repay.

Ethan, not wanting to dwell on the melancholy, turned his attention to the two children.

He crouched down, ready to give Kyle a hug, but Kyle coolly sidestepped, extending a polite hand for a handshake instead. Ethan chuckled, amused by the boy's cautious demeanor. "Just like his dad, always on guard!"

Faye, meanwhile, was pure innocence, happily bounding into Ethan's arms. "Uncle Ethan, I'll miss you!"

Ethan kissed her forehead with a smile. "I'll miss you too, sweetheart."

Faye looked up at him, curiosity in her eyes. "Uncle Ethan, do you like my mom?"

Olivia blushed at the unexpected question, while Ethan tousled Faye's hair, laughing openly. "You little rascal! What if I do? Would you convince your mom to stay?"

Faye tilted her head, thinking hard. "No, I already have a dad, and he's way more handsome than you! But you always say I look like my mom, so how about you wait for me to grow up and marry you?"

"Sure, sure!" Ethan laughed heartily.

Kyle quickly pulled Faye away, scolding her seriously, "Dummy! By the time you grow up, he'll be old!"

Faye pouted defiantly, "So what if he's old?"

Kyle's expression was a mix of amusement and exasperation as he replied, "When he's old, his handsome face will be all wrinkly, like a prune!"

"Ew!" Faye imagined it, shaking her head vigorously. "Maybe not then!"

The children's innocent banter lightened the mood considerably, drawing a shared, helpless smile from Olivia and Ethan.

"You should stop here," Olivia said to Ethan.

Even if you accompany someone a thousand miles, there comes a point to part ways.

No matter how much you give, all you see is their back.

For Ethan, this was indeed a painful truth.

"Alright! Take good care of yourself when you get back. And when you and Isabella finally tie the knot, don't forget to send me an invite! I want one of those fancy, gold-embossed VIP ones!"

Ethan's exaggerated gestures helped mask the bitterness he felt inside.

"Of course, I promise!"

With a determined heart, Olivia turned and walked away.

The twins spotted the plane and were already dashing toward it with excited cheers.

The housekeeper followed closely, carrying Olivia's luggage.

Even as they walked further away, Olivia could still feel Ethan's intense gaze on her back.

Suddenly, the housekeeper spoke up, "Olivia, may I ask you to stay for the young master?"

"Hmm?"

Olivia stopped, turning back to look at the housekeeper in confusion.

The housekeeper hesitated for a moment before speaking, "Olivia, you may have noticed that our young master is not only good-looking but also has a somewhat gentle demeanor. Because of this, he's struggled with his identity in the past, and everyone assumed he'd never be interested in women. Even he probably thought so."

"His father was very worried, trying repeatedly to force him into marriage, but it only pushed him further away. The young master kept running away from home, leaving his father at a loss, until he reluctantly accepted the situation. These past few years, the young master returned to the ranch, seriously learning the family business. His father was overjoyed to discover the reason for this change was you!"

"Olivia, you don't know how happy it made his father to learn his son liked you. He was so excited he couldn't sleep all night. You might not understand that kind of joy. But his father is a traditional man, and he never minded that you already had two children. He's never disturbed your time at the ranch because he hoped you and the young master would develop a strong bond."

The mention of Ethan's father caught Olivia off guard, and she felt a wave of guilt wash over her. "I'm sorry! I know my time at the ranch has caused Ethan a lot of trouble, and I appreciate his father's understanding. But matters of the heart can't be forced. Ethan holds a special place in my heart, but he can't replace the children's father. I'm truly sorry."

Faced with Olivia's honest gaze, the housekeeper had nothing more to say, a look of disappointment on his face.

Olivia sighed deeply. "I understand your concern for Ethan. In my family, there's also a kind-hearted housekeeper like you. But I want you to know that Ethan is clear about his feelings. If I were to stay and force myself to be with him, it would be the most unfair thing to do to him."

With that, Olivia turned back toward the waiting plane, her mind set on the path ahead.

The twins were already climbing aboard, their excitement palpable as they waved back at Ethan.

Ethan watched them go, his heart heavy yet filled with a bittersweet contentment.

He had given his blessing for Olivia to pursue her happiness, even if it meant letting go of his own.

As the plane took off, he stood there, a solitary figure against the vast sky, holding onto the hope that one day, she might find her way back to the ranch, where his heart would always be open for her.

The End.
