Who Snuck the Snack?

“I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, Olivia Stewart, I didn't mean it!” 

The maid was trembling, falling to her knees with a thud, desperately trying to clean up the mess on the floor. A pool of dark sauce spread out, filling the room with a foul, sour smell. She didn’t mind the grime or the stench, using her sleeve to wipe it up.

Olivia Stewart stepped forward, placing her foot on the maid’s hand, a fierce glint in her eyes. That smell was all too familiar to her, having grown up in a rough neighborhood. It was spicy noodles! Though they were long expired and the smell was nauseating, she recognized it instantly.

The maid, trapped under Olivia's foot, was both scared and in pain. She tried to pull her hand back but didn’t dare move, lying there trembling and repeatedly begging for mercy. “Olivia Stewart, I'm sorry! I was wrong, please forgive me!”

Olivia applied a bit of pressure before stepping back and taking a seat, looking down at the maid with cold eyes. “Tell me the truth.”

“Yes, yes! I promise, not a word of a lie!” 

The maid stood up shakily, tears streaming down her face as she stared at the mess on the floor. 

“It’s…it’s the spicy noodles I sneaked a few days ago. Afraid of being caught, I hid the leftover box and sauce under my bed. But today, the smell got too strong, and I was worried it would cause trouble, so I tried to sneak them out to throw them away tonight!”

“You...you…Xia, what did I tell you before? Did you forget everything I said? Can’t you remember anything?” 

Lucas Wright pointed at Xia, the maid, with a look of utter disappointment, his fingers trembling with rage.

“I’m sorry!”

Xia sobbed, dropping to her knees again, her forehead hitting the ground with a thud, leaving a red mark. 

Olivia Stewart, feeling a bit of pity, waved her hand. “Xia, right? Stand up and talk properly.”

“I…I’m guilty, I don’t dare!”

Xia shook her head, staying on her knees, looking pitifully at the ground.

Olivia glanced curiously at Lucas Wright.

Lucas sighed, “Ah, this child! It’s my oversight.”

He took a step forward and knelt before Olivia. 

Olivia was startled, quickly reaching out to grab his arm. “Lucas, what are you doing? Get up and talk.”

“Olivia Stewart, I feel guilty! Let me kneel and finish.”

Lucas knelt with a straight back, guilt written all over his face. 

“When Sophie Cook moved into the castle recently, to strictly control dietary hygiene and eliminate any potential irritants or colored foods, I ordered the staff to eat the same food as Sophie while she recovered.”

“Xia grew up in Spicetown and loves spicy food. She must have sneaked into the kitchen to get those noodles. It's my failure to manage, my dereliction as a butler!”

Olivia looked at the white hair on Lucas Wright’s head, feeling a pang of sympathy. “Lucas, are you done?”

“I…”

Lucas lowered his head, silent.

“If you’re done, then get up.”

Lucas wobbly stood up, surprised to find Olivia Stewart helping him. 

“Lucas!” Olivia held his arm with sincerity, “Though you always call yourself a servant, I’ve treated you as family since I first came here. Whatever happens, let’s talk it out. I hope this doesn’t happen again.”

Lucas was moved by her words, tears welling up. He quickly turned away, wiping them, nodding vigorously. “Okay, okay! This old man is getting more useless with age!”

Olivia led him to a chair. “Lucas, with Isabella Peterson away, there are fewer rules. Sit down, I have questions for Xia.”

“No, no, as the butler, I must uphold my duties. Ask away! Xia is a poor child. I brought her in, and by the Peterson Group's rules, stealing should lead to immediate expulsion. But she’s all alone…”

“Don’t kick me out! Lucas, please! I see you as my father!”

Xia crawled over, clutching Lucas’s pants like a lifeline.

“Sigh—” Lucas sighed heavily. “I’ve said all I can. Xia, listen to Olivia Stewart. If you’re expelled, you’re on your own.”

Lucas said no more, shaking her off and standing respectfully behind Olivia’s chair, returning to a proper butler’s stance.

Seeing no help from Lucas, Xia turned to Olivia, grabbing her pants and pleading, “Olivia Stewart, please don’t kick me out. I’ll never steal again, please don’t!”

Olivia frowned. “Is stealing all you did?”

Xia paused, her face paling, eyes darting nervously. “Yes.”

Olivia immediately sensed something was off. 

With her studies in film school, she had a knack for reading people’s expressions. Spotting Xia’s guilt was easy.

Olivia pressed on, “Stealing a bowl of noodles is minor. Why are you so scared?”

“I…”

Xia collapsed to the floor, glancing at Olivia before quickly lowering her head.

She felt as if Olivia’s sharp gaze could see right through her.

Xia slowly raised three fingers, her voice barely a whisper, “It was…three bowls.”

Olivia glanced at the containers on the floor, a bad feeling stirring inside.

She looked at Xia, her eyes cold. “Where are the other two bowls?”

“They…they were…”

Xia glanced nervously toward Sophie Cook’s room, hesitating.

“Speak!”

“They were eaten by Sophie Cook!”

Olivia was furious, kicking Xia away before rushing over, grabbing her collar, and pushing her into a corner, shouting, “How could you let her eat that stuff? Do you know her scars are now deep red, maybe permanent? You’ve ruined her!”

“No, cough…it wasn’t me…it was her!”

Xia gasped, tears streaming. “She took them herself!”

Olivia released her, glaring. “Explain!”

Xia, rubbing her neck in fear, avoided Olivia’s piercing gaze, speaking quietly, “After I stole the noodles and left them in my room, I went to the bathroom. When I came back, I saw Sophie Cook sneak in, taking the bowls out.”

“I followed her and saw her take them to her room, closing the door and eating them quickly. Afraid she’d notice, I pretended not to see and hurried back.”

“You!”

Olivia shoved Xia against the wall, demanding, “You knew she couldn’t eat spicy, colored food. Why didn’t you stop her?”

“I…I…was afraid she’d report me!”

“Idiot!”

Olivia grabbed Xia’s collar, pain shooting through her back, but she ignored it, throwing Xia aside.

“Olivia Stewart!”

Lucas rushed over, grabbing her wrist, his wrinkled face stern. 

“Forgive my rudeness, but your wound has opened again. You’ll ruin yourself!”

“I don’t care! Move! I need to confront her!”

“You don’t care, but Isabella Peterson does! Have you thought about his feelings while you harm yourself? Do you know the pressure he faces? Yet he’d drop everything to rush back if you needed him. And you?”

Olivia stood stunned. Amidst the chaos with Sophie Cook, she’d been so consumed with guilt and worry she’d neglected Isabella Peterson. He’d been gone for days, and she hadn't even called him!

Seeing his harsh tone, Lucas softened, trying to comfort her. 

“Olivia Stewart, I know you’re upset, but it’s done. Anger won’t help. Xia was wrong to sneak the noodles, and it’s maddening she didn’t stop Sophie Cook, but Sophie made her own choice.”

“She’s not a child. It’s not entirely Xia’s fault.”

Olivia slumped against the wall, closing her eyes as tears slipped down her cheeks.

After a long pause, she sighed, “No matter what, Sophie Cook is like this because of me. I’m responsible. If she doesn’t recover, I’ll carry this guilt forever.”

Lucas shook his head, thinking Olivia was wonderful in every way, except when it came to emotions, where she was as stubborn as ever.
