My recent breakup with Isabella Peterson had me feeling all sorts of unexpected emotions.

White Jinsong's face fell when he saw Olivia Stewart's fiery expression, realizing he'd said the wrong thing. Quickly, he pretended to slap himself, mumbling, "Look at this mouth of mine! Always saying the wrong things! But Olivia, what I meant was, these things might not be much to you, but they're the best our family can offer. Dad sincerely wants you to come home!"

Olivia, unimpressed by his fake sincerity, waved him off, barely containing her anger. "Enough, just stop talking! No matter how you found out I’m your daughter, I’ve already told you—I just want a peaceful life, and I have no intention of recognizing you!"

"No recognition?" White Jinsong panicked. "But I've already held a press conference! There's a welcome banquet for you at the Golden City Hotel in a week!"

Olivia replied coldly, "That's your problem."

White's voice turned sharp, "Olivia, are you deliberately trying to embarrass your father?"

Olivia, feeling nauseous, turned away. "Mr. White, stop calling yourself my dad. It's not something I'm used to! And don't say I'm trying to ruin your plans. Did you inform me when you decided to claim me as your daughter? Did you consult me about the banquet? Did you just assume I'd be eager to acknowledge you?"

White Jinsong was speechless. He hadn't considered her feelings at all, assuming she'd jump at the chance to join a wealthy family. He never imagined Olivia would refuse.

Quickly, he put on a smile again, trying to be gentle, "Olivia, it's your father's fault for being hasty. I was just so excited about having a daughter that I got carried away!"

"A daughter? Or do you have more than one?" Olivia caught the slip in his words.

White Jinsong wiped his forehead, "Uh... not too many. You have an older sister and a younger brother at home."

Olivia felt a chill run down her spine. After what happened with Sophie Cook, she had a strong aversion to sibling relationships.

"Your sister, Mia White, is about your age. She's into makeup and fashion shows. When you come home, she can show you a good time!" White tried to coax her.

He assumed, given Olivia's age and her involvement in the entertainment industry, she'd be interested in such things. Little did he know, Olivia was more intrigued by her sister's name.

"Mia White?" Olivia squinted, thinking aloud. "Mia White... the one who got dumped by Isabella Peterson?"

White Jinsong's face turned red with embarrassment as he nodded, "Yes."

No wonder he's in such a hurry to claim his daughter. If the alliance with Mia failed, why not try another daughter to latch onto the Peterson Group? Clearly, White Jinsong wasn't interested in familial love but rather in Olivia's connection with Isabella Peterson.

Olivia saw right through him, giving him a look filled with a mix of mockery and amusement.

White Jinsong, feeling both ashamed and annoyed, couldn't lash out, so he kept up the facade with a forced smile.

Being a father like this was truly pathetic.

Olivia sipped on the fresh juice Ethan King handed her, speaking slowly, "Hearing all this, I might be interested."

White Jinsong was overjoyed.

"But you might be out of the loop, Mr. White. I recently broke up with Isabella Peterson."

The smile that had just appeared on White Jinsong's face froze awkwardly. "What did you say? Broke up? That's nonsense! Olivia, how could you let go of such an outstanding man?"

"Wasn't Mia White his official fiancée? She couldn't hold onto him either."

Olivia's dismissive retort left White Jinsong speechless and visibly uncomfortable.

Olivia placed her hand on her still-flat stomach, coolly saying, "As you can see, I'm pregnant, and this child has nothing to do with Isabella Peterson!"

This girl, pregnant by another man? What man would want to be the fool in this situation? They're probably completely over now! And if Isabella Peterson ends up despising Olivia, recognizing her might bring trouble to the White family too!

In a flash, White Jinsong's mind raced with thoughts and fears, his forehead breaking into a cold sweat.

Olivia watched his changing expressions with a hint of sarcasm in her smile.

After much deliberation, White Jinsong decided he absolutely couldn't acknowledge this daughter! Not even if it meant slapping himself!

He stood up abruptly, ready to leave, but out of the corner of his eye, he noticed the cunning glint in Olivia's eyes.

As a businessman, White Jinsong's ability to read people and think on his feet was top-notch.

In an instant, he realized Olivia's words were merely a test!

She might actually be pregnant with Isabella Peterson's child!

White quickly retracted his steps, his face shifting to one of affection, saying with a pained expression, "Child, it's your father's fault for not taking care of you. You've suffered out there alone! Come back with me, and I promise you won't suffer any more!"

His ability to change his demeanor was even more impressive than Olivia's acting skills!

Olivia was speechless, her forehead resting in her hand.

She looked up at White Jinsong, "Mr. White still intends to take me home?"

"Of course! You're my daughter, and you should enjoy the prestige of the White family. You must come home! Don't worry, no matter whose child this is, you can stay at home and take good care of yourself!" White spoke confidently, playing the role of a loving father.

Olivia was thoroughly defeated by his performance, smiling, "Alright, then Mr. White, you should head back. I'll attend the welcome banquet in a week!"

"Great, great, you're truly my good daughter!" White Jinsong sighed in relief, almost shedding tears of gratitude.

"And don't worry about the dress and jewelry for the banquet; I'll send them to you!"

Olivia didn't refuse, smiling sweetly, "Thank you, Mr. White!"

White Jinsong winced at being called "Mr. White," wanting Olivia to call him "Dad," but fearing it would upset her, he let it go.

After exchanging a few more polite words, White Jinsong left with his butler and bodyguards.

Outside, he felt a huge weight lifted off his shoulders after playing the humble and subservient father role.

Ethan King found his relieved demeanor amusing.

After closing the door, Ethan asked Olivia, "Are you really going back to the White family? Seeing Mia White every day doesn't make you sick?"

Ethan wasn't aware that Mia and Grace Martin nearly cost Olivia her life; otherwise, he wouldn't have used such a mild word as "sick."

Olivia's eyes flashed with coldness, letting out a soft laugh, "Who said I was going to live with them? If White Jinsong wants to acknowledge me as his daughter, I'll let him. Imagine how Mia would feel if he starts giving me what she cherishes?"

Ethan understood, playfully poking Olivia's forehead, "You little devil!"

Olivia laughed heartily, quickly masking the hint of darkness in her eyes.

...

Over at the Peterson Group estate, Isabella Peterson sat at his desk, staring at the items laid out.

There was a beautifully crafted ring box with a custom engagement diamond ring inside.

And a gilded invitation from the White family for a banquet celebrating their daughter's return.

Olivia Stewart was White Jinsong's daughter!

The news caught him off guard.

The day he left the Golden City Theater, he rushed back to the estate without stopping.

Knowing Olivia was with Ethan King was both a relief and a concern. Ethan had the capability to protect Olivia, even if it meant risking his life.

At this point, any additional bodyguards or attention from him could lead to Alexander Peterson's schemes, which could harm Olivia instead.

After sending Isabella a message, Alexander Peterson followed up with a photo of a child with a heart condition, named Tongtong, whom Isabella had seen at the Angel Orphanage.

Worried about harming the child, Isabella didn't dare make a move, quietly searching for the child while negotiating with Alexander.

Alexander, previously confined with his mother for reflection, resorted to self-harm, cutting his arms, legs, and body.

His mother, unable to bear seeing him hurt himself, pleaded with the family patriarch to release him.

Upon release, Alexander sent Isabella a message as his trump card, along with a paternity test and a pharmacological analysis proving Isabella's infertility, matching Olivia's conclusions.

As dusk fell, Isabella tapped his fingers rhythmically on the desk.

Finally, he locked the ring away in a safe, picked up the phone, and dialed the intercom, "Tell the eldest young master I invite him for coffee at the Oasis Café!"

Half an hour later, Isabella and Alexander met at the Oasis.

After the maids served coffee, they quietly retreated to a distance with the bodyguards.

Isabella and Alexander sat across from each other.

Both were strikingly handsome men, bearing a resemblance to each other, but their temperaments were worlds apart.

Isabella exuded an aura of dominance and boldness, with sharp, commanding features that demanded attention and respect.

Alexander, on the other hand, was more refined and gentle, wearing gold-rimmed glasses. His features seemed harmless and delicate, with a soft, elusive smile. At first glance, he appeared gentle and jade-like, but spending more time with him revealed...
