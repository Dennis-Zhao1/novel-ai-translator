At the bridge leading to the serene retreat of Misty Waters, Jack White explained their purpose to the guards. Holding Grace Martin's hand, they prepared for a long wait to see Olivia Stewart, even bringing along sleeping bags just in case. To their surprise, only a few minutes after the guard reported their arrival, they were invited inside.

Exchanging an excited glance, Jack and Grace were taken by the estate's shuttle to the main castle. As they entered the grand hall, Grace was about to call out for Olivia when she instead saw Isabella Peterson sitting sternly on the couch.

"Uh, hi, Isabella Peterson!" Grace greeted with a bow, despite being his elder. There was something about Isabella's presence that commanded respect.

Jack also greeted Isabella with evident humility. Isabella accepted their greetings with an air of arrogance, not even bothering to acknowledge them with a nod. It was clear he wasn't fond of them, but their connection to Olivia allowed them this meeting.

An awkward silence stretched as Isabella remained silent. Grace nudged Jack, prompting him to speak. After a quick glance to gauge Isabella's mood, Jack cautiously asked, "Is Olivia Stewart around?"

Isabella responded coolly, "Whatever you need to say, you can say to me. Are you here to ask her for a kidney or a liver this time?"

Jack flushed with shame, while Grace waved her hands frantically. "No, no, we don't want anything from her! I swear, I wouldn't take her kidney even if I were dying!"

Isabella merely glanced at Grace, "That's for the best."

"You should pack up and leave for good. It's best if you never show up in Gold City again," Isabella's cold voice declared, leaving Grace and Jack stunned. This was the real reason Isabella agreed to see themâ€”to ensure they disappeared from Olivia's life. It was the greatest mercy they could expect, but if they left, how could they ever reunite with their daughter?

Overcome with desperation, Grace fell to her knees, pleading, "Please, Isabella, don't make us leave! I promise we won't cause Olivia any trouble. I just want to watch her be happy from a distance."

"Yes, yes, we just want to make amends, not harm her anymore," Jack quickly joined Grace on the floor.

"Happiness?" Isabella scoffed. "With you around, how could she ever be happy?"

Grace and Jack were filled with regret. Jack produced a letter from Sophia Allen's grave and handed it to Isabella. "Please, give this to Olivia. She's our biological daughter. We made mistakes, thinking we were protecting our own, but we were manipulated by Sophia Allen's schemes. We're victims too!"

Jack finished with a solemn vow, raising two fingers and swearing never to harm Olivia again.

Isabella scanned the letter, her expression darkening as she read about Olivia's hardships. These people had all played a part in her suffering.

As Grace and Jack knelt in silence, Isabella's anger was palpable. Yet after a long silence, Isabella spoke, "This letter stays with me. Whether you want to repent or reconnect, it's too late. Olivia has severe depression. She won't recognize you, or even me."

"What?" Jack and Grace looked up, shocked beyond words.

"You fools! If you'd continued hurting her, perhaps she could have coped. But you finished all your vile deeds and then revealed you're her parents, which is more painful than stabbing her with a knife!"

"The day you showed her the DNA results, she collapsed and has been unresponsive since," Isabella's voice carried a deep sadness.

Jack, realizing Isabella wasn't lying, asked, "Where is she now?"

"I had a friend take her away to recover. Staying away from her is the best thing you can do," Isabella said, turning to leave, her figure a silhouette of solitary resolve.

Grace and Jack sat on the floor, tears flowing freely as they lamented their lost chance with Olivia.

"Olivia, my Olivia..." Grace sobbed, hitting herself in grief.

Jack, maintaining some composure, consoled her, "Grace, we need to be strong for Olivia. Once you recover, we'll find her. We'll do whatever it takes to make things right."

Inspired by Jack's words, Grace found a glimmer of hope. "Let's go back to the hospital."

Grace's illness was partly due to her own fear. With Olivia as her motivation, she cooperated with the doctors and improved remarkably, defying the odds.

Meanwhile, Jack searched tirelessly for Olivia's whereabouts, learning she might be in Australia. Once Grace was well, they packed up and headed to the ranch to find her.

As for Mia White, Sophia's daughter, they cut ties with her, leaving her to fend for herself.

A month passed since Ethan King took Olivia to the ranch. Surrounded by blue skies and grazing cattle, Olivia seemed brighter, though she still didn't speak or acknowledge others. Yet, under the sun, her expression was often serene.

Ethan stayed by her side, sometimes murmuring, "You always loved it here. I knew you would," reflecting on her choice to follow Isabella instead of joining him earlier.

Isabella frequently called for updates, but Ethan, perhaps punishing Isabella, never revealed much, refusing even video calls when Olivia was nearby.

Olivia found solace in crafting clay figures, and Ethan built a studio reminiscent of her old one, shipping in all the supplies she needed. Her focus shifted from watching the pastures to spending hours sculpting. The studio soon filled with twin figures, a testament to her memories.

Ethan, sensing a breakthrough, requested current photos of the twins. When he showed them to Olivia, she briefly smiled, a glimmer of recognition.

"Olivia, you smiled! You remember them, right?" Ethan asked, hopeful.

But Olivia's smile faded as she returned to her clay, leaving Ethan longing for more of that fleeting joy.
