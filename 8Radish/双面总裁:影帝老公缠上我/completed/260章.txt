It was a late night when Lucas Wright returned to the Wind Whisper Cottage, only to find Isabella Peterson staring intently at the overwhelming network of traffic cameras, her eyes bloodshot from searching.

"Oh man, if only I'd known," Isabella thought to herself, feeling a pang of regret.

Lucas handed a document to Isabella. "Here, Miss Peterson, Olivia Stewart's medical report."

Isabella hesitated for a moment before taking it and flipping it open. It was a lab report, with a glaring red plus sign that seemed almost blindingly obvious.

Isabella skimmed through the symbols, not really grasping them, until her eyes landed on the diagnosis section. Just two simple words: "Early Pregnancy."

Early pregnancy!

The memory of her own infertility diagnosis hit Isabella like a ton of bricks. One infertile, one pregnant—it was a cruel irony.

Her fingers clenched tightly, crumpling the diagnosis sheet into a ball.

"Miss Peterson!" Lucas exclaimed in shock.

"Miss Peterson, please don't act impulsively! You know what kind of person Olivia Stewart is, right? Don't fall into Mr. Alexander Peterson's trap! That psychologist might have been working for him all along!"

A complex emotion flitted through Isabella's dark eyes. Psychological suggestions can amplify your deepest fears until you lose yourself in them. But once you wake up to the truth, everything becomes clear.

Isabella finally understood why her conversations with Professor Zhang had only made her paranoia worse. She had to admit, Alexander's plan was clever. He was using her to make Olivia give up completely.

Realizing this, Isabella felt a deep, painful ache, but faced with Olivia's pregnancy report...

Even if all her suspicions were just misunderstandings, how could Olivia's pregnancy be explained?

The doctor had said her chances of getting someone pregnant were one in a million. Was Olivia really that one in a million?

What about trust? Where had it gone?

Isabella shut her eyes tightly, and when she opened them again, they were calm. She flattened the crumpled paper carefully, smoothing out every crease.

No matter who the child was, it would always be Olivia's.

As Isabella unfolded the paper, a familiar handwriting appeared on the back of the diagnosis sheet:

When there’s no trust between two people, even the strongest emotions can fade away. Before we become strangers, let's part peacefully, leaving something beautiful behind. Isabella Peterson, let's part ways—don't look for me.

Isabella's deep gaze lingered on those final words, reading them over and over.

Olivia had written her farewell on the back of a pregnancy diagnosis, a silent testament to her grievances.

Isabella's face was already pale with shock.

Why had she doubted Olivia's past? Why hadn't she believed in that one-in-a-million chance?

Etching those few lines into her heart, Isabella carefully folded the diagnosis sheet and gave a low order: "Let Alexander Peterson know about Olivia's departure."

Lucas was taken aback but bowed his head. "Yes, Miss Peterson."

Logically, since this was Alexander's territory, having him join the search could be beneficial. But for Isabella to swallow her pride and ask Alexander for help—that was something else entirely.

Hopefully, this time, she had truly woken up!

Lucas quickly left, leaving Isabella alone by the window, lost in thought. Memories of the past, filled with guilt and regret, ate away at her like acid.

Alexander had already received news of Olivia's departure. He was waiting for the moment when Olivia could no longer bear it and severed all ties with Isabella.

On the bustling street, Olivia was about to hail a cab when a luxurious Rolls Royce slowly pulled up beside her.

The window rolled down, revealing Alexander's sharp profile.

He adjusted his glasses and turned to Olivia. "Get in."

Olivia stood still, her face guarded.

Alexander forced a smile. "Olivia, you know that no matter how I fight with Isabella, I've never harmed you. If I hadn't barged in to rescue you back then, following the old man's wishes, the Peterson Group would have been mine without all this hassle!"

"Thank you," Olivia replied in a cool, detached tone.

"I used to be grateful to you, but that gratitude faded with all your scheming."

A shadow crossed Alexander's face. "Is it wrong for me to want to win your heart? If Isabella's love for you was unconditional and he trusted you completely, my schemes would be useless, wouldn’t they?"

His words struck a nerve with Olivia.

She bit her lip. "Thank you for helping me see the truth. If there's nothing else, Mr. Peterson, please go."

"Olivia!"

Alexander's voice was heavy with suppressed anger.

"Do you really want to cut all ties with me?"

"What else?" Olivia scoffed. "We never had any ties! I've felt guilty about what happened back then, but you destroyed the last remnants of our friendship. We can't even be friends—the best outcome is to become strangers!"

"So heartless?" Alexander growled, like a wounded beast.

Olivia was done with this conversation. She turned and walked away.

"Olivia!"

Alexander got out of the car and caught up to her, grabbing her wrist.

"Olivia, listen to me!"

He softened his tone deliberately.

"I'm sorry for earlier! I sincerely apologize! All I want to say is, now that you're leaving Isabella, if you’re willing, I'll go wherever you want to go."

"I’m not interested!"

Olivia yanked her arm free from his grip.

"Alexander, if you wanted to avenge my betrayal, you've succeeded. There's nothing left between us!"

Alexander’s face turned a sickly shade of green, more disgusting than if he'd eaten something foul.

Even picking up Isabella's leftovers, he'd humbled himself to the ground, yet Olivia still wasn't interested!

Overwhelmed by a mix of pride and deep-seated inferiority, Alexander clenched his fists, turned, and slammed the car door. The Rolls Royce zoomed away into the traffic.

Olivia flagged down a cab and left shortly after.

As Alexander drove, resentment gnawed at him. He knew Olivia too well—once she made up her mind, she was unlikely to change it. If he let this opportunity slip, there might never be another chance to win her back.

The Rolls Royce slowed, eventually turning back towards where he’d first seen Olivia.

But she was nowhere to be found.

"Bang!"

Alexander slammed a fist on the steering wheel, cursing himself for his missed opportunity.

Meanwhile, Lucas had informed Alexander of Olivia's departure, but by then, Alexander had already searched the entire city. Olivia seemed to have vanished without a trace.

When Lucas returned to report, Isabella was in Olivia's room, staring at the bottles and jars Olivia had left behind. Hearing there was still no news of Olivia, he swept his arm across the table in frustration.

In his mind, he could see Olivia diligently analyzing the contents of those bottles every day.

His hand stopped just short of the bottle, clenched tightly, and withdrew.

Even if she hadn’t found the cause of his condition, at least she had tried.

But what about him? What had he done?

Apart from endless suspicion, what else was there?

"Bang!"

Isabella punched herself in the head.

"Miss Peterson!"

Lucas was startled by Isabella's self-destructive behavior and rushed forward to stop her.

Isabella's eyes were bloodshot as she coldly ordered, "Don't bother looking for her."

"Don't look for her?"

Was Miss Peterson giving up on Olivia?

"But Olivia is pregnant!" Lucas blurted out, then wished he could bite his tongue off.

He knew this was the thing Isabella cared about the most, and yet he mentioned the child.

Isabella's expression didn't change; her deep black eyes were unreadable.

Her lips moved slightly, "Inform the movie studio to speed up the post-production of the new film. I want to see the premiere in a month."

Lucas blinked, then his face lit up with understanding.

Miss Peterson was playing it smart!

No matter where Olivia went, as the lead actress of the new movie, she would have to attend the premiere. If she still had any feelings for Isabella, she would definitely show up!

Lucas eagerly set about making arrangements.

Isabella walked towards her study, her steps heavy.

Olivia, I'll give you a month to clear your head. If you don't show up by then, I'll find you no matter where you are!

Isabella locked herself in the study for an entire day and night. When she emerged, aside from her red eyes and pale face, she showed no other emotion.

Lucas noticed her pallor. "Miss Peterson! Is your stomach acting up again?"

Isabella waved it off. "I'm fine."

Lucas handed her a bowl of warm soup. "You haven’t eaten in a day and a night. This will help."

Isabella drank the soup without a word and headed downstairs.

Lucas noticed she was heading towards the wine cellar and panicked. "Miss Peterson, Olivia just went out to clear her mind. You have to stay strong!"

The last time there was a misunderstanding with Olivia, Miss Peterson had drunk herself into a bleeding ulcer. This time...

Oh man, what could he do now?

Lucas followed her anxiously into the wine cellar.

Isabella picked up a bottle of strong liquor, uncorked it, and before Lucas could stop her, poured the entire bottle over herself...
