The Big Day

Isabella Peterson, with a mischievous grin, explained earnestly, "Back in the day, right here, your mom, with a big belly, shouted like a boss, 'Give me back my man!' And then, she snatched Dad away from another woman!"

Recalling the embarrassing memory, Olivia Stewart wished she could dig a hole and hide. Just as she was about to turn away, little Gigi tugged at her, asking, "Really? Was my brother and I in your belly then? Wait a minute! You and Dad weren't married yet, so how did we get there?"

Olivia Stewart blushed, feeling both embarrassed and flustered, shooting a sharp look at Isabella Peterson, "You explain this to the kids!"

Isabella Peterson's handsome face showed a hint of discomfort, and he quickly changed the subject, "Uh, the ceremony is about to start, let's talk about this later!"

As the sweet sounds of the wedding march filled the air, Olivia Stewart and Isabella Peterson walked slowly toward the altar at the front of the hall. In front of the priest, they made solemn vows.

The priest, with a serious expression, looked at Isabella Peterson and asked, "Mr. Isabella Peterson, do you take Miss Olivia Stewart as your wife? To love her, cherish her, and remain faithful to her, in good times and bad, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, for as long as you both shall live?"

Isabella Peterson squeezed Olivia Stewart's hand a little tighter, gazing at her with such affection and tenderness that it seemed almost tangible.

"I do!" he answered in a deep, resonant voice.

The priest nodded slightly and turned to Olivia Stewart, asking, "Miss Olivia Stewart, do you take Mr. Isabella Peterson as your husband? To love him, cherish him, and remain faithful to him, in good times and bad, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, for as long as you both shall live?"

Olivia Stewart glanced shyly at Isabella Peterson and answered loudly, "I do!"

The priest adjusted his glasses, "Now, the bride and groom will exchange rings!"

As they exchanged rings, Isabella Peterson leaned down to place the ring on Olivia Stewart's finger and whispered playfully in her ear, "Sweetheart, how about a kiss?"

Olivia Stewart's cheeks turned a rosy red, and she was about to remind Isabella Peterson that everyone was watching. But as she looked up, she found herself touching his warm, soft lips!

The spark between them was electric, and Isabella Peterson gently cupped the back of her head, claiming her lips with a passionate kiss...

The priest, a bit late to the party, announced, "Now, the groom may kiss the bride..."

Too late!

In the audience, little Gigi suddenly squealed, "Oh my gosh! So embarrassing! Brother, cover your eyes!"

But Tommy just reached over and covered Gigi's eyes without hesitation.

Gigi stomped her foot and slapped his hand away, "Hey, what are you doing? Cover your own eyes!"

Tommy replied coolly, "Dad said I should watch and learn."

Gigi protested, "Then I want to learn too!"

Nearby, Ethan King knelt down and teased Gigi, "Little darling, want Uncle Ethan to teach you?"

Gigi tilted her head, scrutinizing him for a moment before decisively refusing, "Nope! You might be handsome, but you're not as cool as my dad! So, you can't kiss me!"

Ethan King feigned a look of hurt.

Not only had he been dumped by big Olivia Stewart, but now even little Olivia Stewart was rejecting him. How tragic could his life get?

Ethan King glanced up at the couple on stage, hiding his disappointment behind a faint smile.

Wishing you happiness, Olivia Stewart!

...

After the wedding, back at their home, Olivia Stewart changed into something comfortable and stood at the top of their castle, gazing at the beautiful lake reflection in the distance.

Isabella Peterson came out and embraced her from behind, resting his chin on her shoulder, gently rubbing, "What are you thinking about? Tired?"

"No," Olivia Stewart smiled, "I'm finally the officially recognized lady of the house, and I'm happy!"

"Well, my dear wife, should we head to the honeymoon suite now?"

Olivia Stewart giggled shyly, playfully hitting Isabella Peterson's chest, "You're so naughty!"

Isabella Peterson scooped her up in his arms, raising an eyebrow mischievously, "You know what they sayâ€”bad boys get the girls! Tonight, let your husband show you just how 'bad' he can be!"

Olivia Stewart was gently placed on silk sheets, and the look in Isabella Peterson's eyes seemed to set her ablaze!

Even though they were intimately familiar with each other, Olivia Stewart still blushed like a new bride, closing her eyes in shyness.

The temperature in the room was rising steadily!

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door: "Knock, knock..."

Who the heck would be so inconsiderate?

Isabella Peterson looked up, visibly annoyed, just about to scold when Gigi's soft voice called from outside, "Daddy, Mommy, are you already asleep? Let me in!"

Then came Tommy's cool voice, "What do you want to go in for?"

"I heard crashing the honeymoon suite is fun, I want to join in! Daddy, Mommy! Open the door!"

Olivia Stewart covered her face in embarrassment.

Oh, being crashed by their own kids on their honeymoon night, what a scenario!

Isabella Peterson looked equally frustrated.

Darn it!

Lucas Wright had sent all the servants away but somehow forgot about these little troublemakers!

"Daddy, Mommy! Knock, knock, knock..."

Seeing no response from inside for a while, Gigi got anxious, shouting and knocking.

Olivia Stewart chuckled helplessly and nudged Isabella Peterson.

Isabella Peterson, arms braced on either side of Olivia Stewart, looked at her sulkily like a child, refusing to budge.

Outside, the kids' voices could be heard again, this time Tommy suggesting, "Gigi, today Mom and Dad received loads of gifts. Why don't we go open them?"

"Open gifts? Yes, yes, I love that!"

Gigi's joyful voice gradually faded away.

Isabella Peterson let out a sigh of relief.

His son truly understood when to back off, allowing them some peace finally!

...

On the third day, Olivia Stewart and Isabella Peterson woke up late. Just as they finished breakfast, Ethan King arrived.

Seeing him with a suitcase, Olivia Stewart frowned slightly, "Leaving already?"

Ethan King tossed aside his suitcase, slouched on the sofa, and raised an eyebrow at Isabella Peterson, "What else can I do? Stay here and watch you two lovebirds all day?"

Olivia Stewart lowered her eyes slightly, "It's good to venture out!"

"Yeah, I'm going on an adventure! This time, I've decided to find the next girl who makes my heart race! If I can't, I'm not coming back ever!"

Olivia Stewart smiled, "Crazy as ever, but it's the best decision for you!"

What she couldn't give Ethan King, she hoped a wonderful girl could.

"Yeah."

Ethan King smiled charmingly, masking his sadness deep within.

The search for another girl was just an excuse to leave gracefully.

Only he knew that in his lifetime, he would never find another Olivia Stewart.

She was irreplaceable.

But aside from offering blessings, he said nothing more.

"Uncle Crazy!"

Gigi bounced down the stairs, happily greeting Ethan King, then snuggled next to Isabella Peterson, innocently saying, "Yesterday, when you were kissing Mommy, Uncle Crazy said he could teach me!"

Isabella Peterson's expression darkened, "Stay away from my daughter!"

Ethan King chuckled helplessly, "It was just a joke! By the time she's grown, I'll be old!"

Ethan King stood up, grabbed his suitcase, and whistled as he waved to the Stewart family, "I'm off! Wishing you happiness!"

Olivia Stewart watched his figure grow distant, feeling touched as she called out, "Crazy, you find happiness too!"

"Auntie!"

Tommy's cheerful voice echoed.

Olivia Stewart turned to see Aunt Sarah pushing Tommy from the side hall, his face beaming with joy, a stark contrast to his previous somber demeanor.

"Tommy's here? Had breakfast?"

Olivia Stewart stood up, giving Tommy a big hug, asking gently.

"Already had it. It's just you and Uncle who got up the latest!"

Tommy's words carried a hint of teasing, making Olivia Stewart blush lightly.

Previously, Olivia Stewart had worried about Tommy's thoughts, but since he had opened up, he always seemed cheerful, calling her "Auntie" with enthusiasm.

Especially after he admitted to his part in Gigi's kidnapping and received Olivia Stewart's forgiveness, he seemed much more positive.

He said he was happy to see Olivia Stewart finally having a family after staying with her for so long.

The reason he was willing to acknowledge his roots with the Peterson family was because Olivia Stewart had become his Aunt, his family!

Aunt Sarah, pushing Tommy's wheelchair, was smiling, though her eyes couldn't hide the sense of regret.

She knew she had missed nine years of Tommy's life and had a long way to go to win his heart back.

After breakfast, Isabella Peterson and Olivia Stewart walked hand in hand in the garden, digesting their meal. Olivia Stewart suddenly asked, "How are you going to deal with Alexander Peterson's situation?"

Considering his abusive behavior towards Tommy, it was already a criminal matter, yet he was still Tommy's biological father!

Isabella Peterson's expression darkened, and after a pause, he said, "David Wright reported late yesterday, but fearing it would upset you, I didn't mention it. Alexander Peterson... during our wedding, when the guards weren't paying attention, he slammed his head against the wall, causing severe concussion. He's still unconscious, and the doctors say it might affect his memory and motor skills."

Olivia Stewart sighed softly, "Perhaps it's for the best. If he can forget the past, let go of his obsessions, and reunite with Tommy and Aunt Sarah as a family, that would be the best outcome."

Isabella Peterson lifted Olivia Stewart's hand to his lips, kissing it gently, with a sense of gratitude, "I'm so glad I didn't let go of your hand. I'm so lucky you didn't abandon me when I was lost! Olivia Stewart, how fortunate I am to have you!"

Olivia Stewart's eyes sparkled, "Isabella Peterson, I feel the same! I'm so glad I met you and gave you the best years of my life!"

Isabella Peterson tilted Olivia Stewart's chin, leaning down to capture her lips in a familiar embrace...

There was a long road ahead, but with love by their side, they would walk it together.
