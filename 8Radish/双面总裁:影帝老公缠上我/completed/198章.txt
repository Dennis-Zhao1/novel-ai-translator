Title: Lost Memories

Olivia Stewart sat there, looking like she had something to say but couldn't quite get it out. Isabella Peterson, with an air of nonchalance, casually flicked her gaze up from examining Olivia's delicate fingers and let out a soft, "Hmm?"

"Isabella, can you please take this seriously?" Olivia finally burst out.

"Alright, alright," Isabella responded, her demeanor shifting as she pulled Olivia into her personal space, her eyes glancing sideways with a teasing grin. "So, tell me, aside from wanting to find some wild guy, what do you want? Whatever it is, I've got you covered. Even if you want to start a revolution, I've got your back!"

Olivia rolled her eyes in exasperation. "You once claimed I was your long-lost love, just because I looked like her. Was that just an excuse to keep me around, or...?"

"What do you mean 'excuse'? You are her!" Isabella's voice rose, sounding genuinely wounded. She was as stubborn about this as a nail hammered into a board.

Olivia pouted slightly. "Can we have a normal conversation, Isabella?"

Isabella looked up to see Olivia's face, filled with frustration and seriousness, her small nose and mouth scrunched up, eyes glaring with dissatisfaction. Clearly, Olivia was invested in this subject!

But was this jealousy, or was she trying to trick Isabella into revealing something?

"What exactly do you want to know? Want me to jog your memory about the good old days?" Isabella suggested, leaning in closer, her warm breath brushing against Olivia's face.

"Get your mind out of the gutter!" Olivia retorted, pinching Isabella's side. The teasing had eased her tension a bit, and she finally asked, "Isabella, back then when you said I was your past love, did all that stuff between us actually happen?"

Seeing Olivia's serious expression, Isabella sensed something unusual and immediately became focused. She grasped Olivia's shoulders, staring intently into her eyes. "Olivia, are you starting to remember something?"

Olivia shook her head.

The spark of hope in Isabella's eyes flickered out like a shooting star. She gently patted Olivia's back, offering comfort. "It's okay if you can't remember. You can be Olivia if that's what you like. As long as you don't get upset over nothing, I'm happy. Whatever happiness I couldn't give you back then, I'll make up for it tenfold now."

"But..." Olivia hesitated, staring at a nodding bobblehead on the shelf. "Last Friday, while I was acting, the lines felt so familiar, like I'd lived them before."

Isabella's heart skipped a beat, eyes trained anxiously on Olivia's face.

"But when I tried to think harder, I couldn't recall anything. It felt like a part of my mind was just empty, like someone had taken those memories away."

"Try to remember!" Isabella urged, her voice filled with a mix of hope and anxiety.

Olivia glanced apologetically at Isabella, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "I'm sorry, Isabella. I really want to remember, but it feels like a part of my brain is missing, and no matter how hard I think, there's nothing there."

Isabella leaned down, placing a gentle kiss on Olivia's furrowed brow. "It's okay, take your time."

Back when Isabella had sent Michael Wright to investigate, it seemed like everything about Olivia from five years ago had been erased. Even her old town had been transformed into a new development, wiping away all traces of the past.

Michael's team hadn't given up, but months later, they still had no leads. Who had the power to make Olivia forget? And why did it matter so much?

Isabella clenched her fist, a cold determination flashing in her eyes, but when she looked back at Olivia, her gaze softened. "Don't worry about it, Olivia. Just stay by my side. I'll handle everything else."

"Isabella!" Olivia grasped Isabella's hand, looking at her urgently. "If, and I'm just saying if, I lost something really important, would you be mad at me?"

"Don't be silly," Isabella smiled, her finger tapping Olivia's nose. "What's more important than you? Just don't lose yourself."

"I actually found something from our past, but then I lost it!" Olivia confessed, her voice breaking as she buried her face in Isabella's chest.

"What did you say?" Isabella's voice was barely more than a whisper, as if struck by lightning, his body tense and still.

"Last Friday, I couldn't shake this uneasy feeling after the morning's shoot, so in the afternoon, while you were out, I snuck back to the old town. Everything had changed, but the ancient tree was still there."

Isabella knew about the tree—it was protected and couldn't be removed even when the town was redeveloped. He'd tried to buy it, but it was a no-go, so they had to settle for a replica in the new film set.

"My old home was near that tree, and I used to bury things there as a kid. I thought maybe I could find something, and I did—a small wooden box."

As Olivia recounted finding and then losing the box, Isabella's grip on her hand tightened, his palms slick with sweat. He hadn't been this nervous since his first big international deal.

"You mean that box and its contents are gone?" Isabella's voice rose, his hands squeezing Olivia's shoulders, eyes wide with disbelief.

Olivia nodded quietly.

"Olivia!" Isabella's shout was like a thunderclap, making her wince.

She knew he'd be angry, but not this furious!

Isabella tilted her chin up, glaring at her as if she were his worst enemy. "This happened on Friday, and you're only telling me now?"

Two days had passed, and any trace was likely lost—how could they investigate now?

"I..." Olivia's long lashes fluttered as she looked down. "I didn't know how to tell you, and then..." she trailed off, remembering how Isabella had kept her up all night.

"Do you not trust me at all? Where do you even place me in your heart? You ungrateful little wolf!" Isabella shouted, not sparing Olivia another glance before storming out.

Watching his angry retreat, Olivia felt her heart sink, tears finally spilling over.

Why did he have to be so mean?

Did it really matter if she remembered the past, whether she was his lost love or not?

Isabella rushed to his office, ordering Michael Wright to drop everything else and focus solely on Olivia's case. Once done, he pulled out the initial investigation, staring at the sparse words for what felt like an eternity.

Olivia's lost memories seemed intentionally hidden, and the thought of someone familiar with the situation deliberately keeping it from him...

Isabella couldn't bear the thought, lighting a cigarette despite having quit since Olivia came into his life. He didn't smoke it, just let it burn between his fingers, the lonely smoke curling up around him.

He eventually turned off the office lights, standing by the window, lost in thought. The only light was the glowing tip of his cigarette, flickering in the dark.

The night wind stirred the curtains, moonlight spilling into the room, stretching Isabella's shadow long and lonely across the floor.

The next morning, Olivia got up unusually early, skipping breakfast to head straight to the film set. Isabella's harshness from the night before left her feeling disappointed. Did her past really matter more than her present self standing right in front of him? Why did he react so intensely?

Or was it that Isabella's heart still yearned for the gentle, caring version of her from five years ago?

That thought left Olivia feeling unsettled. People are indeed greedy creatures.

When she had been his stand-in, she had secretly cherished every moment of Isabella's attention, fearing the real one would show up and end her charade.

Now, even with some glimpse of being the original, it seemed Isabella's feelings were stuck in the past. How could she not be frustrated?

And just because she lost that box, losing their past clues, Isabella hadn't returned to their room all night!

Isabella, you jerk! Jerk, jerk, jerk!
