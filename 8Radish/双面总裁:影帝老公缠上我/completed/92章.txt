Lucas Wright always seemed like the kind of guy who preferred coding over crunching numbers in real estate meetings. Despite his family's massive empire, Group Peterson, his interests lay elsewhere. But right now, he was breaking his own rules, pulling some serious strings to make sure Olivia Stewart got the best of everything. He was even using the company's top-notch architects for a project in Peach Town. All this to build a movie set for a film just to impress Olivia! The real kicker? He wasn’t even worried about his family finding out and raising a ruckus.

Meanwhile, Olivia was having her own moment in the bathroom, scrutinizing her reflection in the mirror. Thanks to some serious skincare, the scratches on her face were nearly gone. Just a hint of pink remained, which only stood out because of her porcelain skin. A few more days, and she'd be as good as new. But as she thought about Isabella Peterson's hawk-like gaze, she found herself reaching for a light pink lip liner. Carefully, she traced over the remnants of the scratches, adding a bit more drama to them. Why? Maybe to test if Isabella would still care if her face wasn’t flawless.

As if on cue, there came a pounding on the bathroom door coupled with Isabella's grumbling voice. "Olivia, are you hiding in there crying again? You better not be, or you'll regret it when I get in there!"

Olivia's heart skipped a beat, and her hand slipped, smudging the line. Panicked, she tried to fix it with a makeup wipe. "I just wanted to take a shower!" she called out, trying to sound nonchalant.

"Your face is off-limits to water, remember? Open up! I'm coming in to help."

Rolling her eyes at Isabella’s persistence, Olivia ignored him, finishing the touch-ups on her face. A few light pink lines later, and she was satisfied with the not-too-obvious but noticeable effect.

The banging resumed. "Olivia! Open this door or I'm kicking it down!"

With a smirk at her handiwork, Olivia finally opened the door. Isabella stood there, one foot poised to kick, looking both relieved and frustrated to see her unharmed. He quickly regained his composure, slipping into his usual bossy demeanor. "I told you to step aside!"

"I was just trying to save you from hurting your foot," Olivia retorted with a smirk.

Isabella's eyes lit up with a mix of pride and amusement. "Worried about me, are you? That's more like it!"

Olivia just shook her head. Seriously, was this tech genius too dense to catch the sarcasm? She decided not to push it, not wanting to deal with his tantrum.

But Isabella wasn’t letting it go, eyeing her skeptically. "Didn’t you say you wanted a shower?"

"Changed my mind," she replied casually.

"Afraid I’d join you?" Isabella teased, completely unfazed.

Olivia sighed at his bluntness. "I’m going out," she declared, trying to sidestep him.

Isabella didn’t budge. "You sure you don't need a shower first? You know, hygiene and all?"

Olivia huffed, "I showered this morning, thank you very much!"

"Really? Let me check," Isabella said, leaning in as if to sniff her.

She shoved him away, laughing despite herself. But then he stopped, his gaze zeroing in on her face. "Hold on, your scars look worse."

Olivia panicked internally. How did he notice such a tiny change?

"Call the doctor!" Isabella barked, already reaching for his phone.

"No need!" Olivia grabbed his arm. "I think it's just the cold water I used last night."

"Cold water? Are you trying to make it worse?" Isabella scolded, but his touch was gentle as he scooped her up, determined to get her checked out.

This was bad. If the doctor had a close look, he’d notice her little makeup trick. Trying to keep him calm, Olivia wrapped her arms around Isabella's neck. "Seriously, it’s nothing. You’re overreacting."

"Quiet," he snapped. "You’re not staying like this!"

Once downstairs, Isabella sat with Olivia nestled against him on a couch, waiting for the family doctor. When he finally arrived, his examination was meticulous. "This isn’t right," he muttered, squinting at her face.

"What’s wrong?" Isabella demanded, glaring at the doctor.

The doctor stammered an explanation, trying to appease Isabella’s impatience. "I’ve been using the best care products, but this shouldn’t happen."

"I told you, she used cold water!" Isabella growled.

"That would slow healing, but it shouldn’t cause this," the doctor said, glancing at Olivia. Her eyes silently pleaded with him, and he quickly looked away, continuing his examination.

"Well, it doesn’t require more than time. A bit longer than expected, but nothing serious," the doctor concluded, carefully avoiding Olivia’s gaze.

Olivia exhaled in relief, trying to soothe Isabella. "See? Nothing major. No need to stress."

"Olivia, did you do this on purpose? You think I won't do something about it?" Isabella threatened, half-heartedly.

Olivia bit back a smile. He was all bark and no bite when it came to her face. Until she was fully healed, she knew she was safe.

"Alright, Isabella, I promise I won’t do it again."

"Promises, promises,” Isabella grumbled. “From now on, I’m handling all your care. Everything. No arguments."

Olivia was speechless. Had she dug her own grave here?

Once upstairs, Olivia slipped away to find the doctor. She needed to make sure he stayed quiet. "Remember, keep this to yourself or I'll say you tried something inappropriate."

"Never! I swear, I won’t breathe a word," the doctor promised, visibly relieved.

Satisfied, Olivia nodded and made her exit, ready to face whatever Isabella threw her way next.
